0904.4252	resolved stellar mass maps of galaxies. i: method and implications for  global mass estimates	(abridged) we introduce a novel technique to construct spatially resolvedmaps of stellar mass surface density in galaxies based on optical and near irimaging. we use optical/nir colour(s) to infer effective stellar mass-to-lightratios (m/l) at each pixel, which are then multiplied by the surface brightnessto obtain the local stellar surface mass density. we build look-up tables toexpress m/l as a function of colour(s) by marginalizing over a monte carlolibrary of 50,000 stellar population synthesis (sps) models by charlot &amp;bruzual (2007), which include a revised prescription for the tp-agb stellarevolutionary phase, with a wide range of dust exinctions. in order to extractreliable flux and colour information at any position in the galaxy, we performa median adaptive smoothing of the images that preserves the highest possiblespatial resolution. as the most practical and robust, and hence fiducialmethod, we express the m/l in the h band as a function of (g-i) and (i-h).stellar mass maps computed in this way have a typical accuracy of 30 per centor less at any given pixel, determined from the scatter in the models. wecompare maps obtained with our fiducial method with those derived using othercombinations of bandpasses and the old bc03 tp-agb prescription. finally, wecompare total stellar mass estimates obtained by integrating resolved mass mapswith those obtained with unresolved photometry. in galaxies with evident dustlanes, unresolved estimates may miss up to 40 per cent of the total stellarmass because dusty regions are strongly under-represented in the luminousfluxes.

0706.3424	keck/deimos spectroscopy of a galex uv selecte sample from the medium  imaging survey	we report results from a pilot program to obtain spectroscopy for objectsdetected in the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) medium imaging survey (mis).our study examines the properties of galaxies detected by galex fainter thanthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) spectroscopic survey. this is the firststudy to extend the techinques of salim et al. 2005 to estimate stellar masses,star formation rates (sfr) and the b (star formation history) parameter forstar-forming galaxies out to z~0.7. we obtain redshifts for 50 galex missources reaching nuv=23.9 (ab mag), having counterparts in the sdss datarelease 4 (dr4). of our sample, 43 are starforming galaxies with z&lt;0.7, 3 haveemission line ratios indicative of agn with z&lt;0.7, and 4 objects with z~1 areqsos, 3 of which are not previously cataloged. we compare our sample to a muchlarger sample of ~50,000 matched galex/sdss galaxies with sdss spectroscopy;while our survey is shallow, the optical counterparts to our sources reach ~3magnitudes fainter in sdss r magnitude than the sdss spectroscopic sample. weuse emission line diagnostics for the galaxies to determine that the samplecontains mostly star-forming galaxies. the galaxies in the sample populate theblue sequence in the nuv-r vs m_r color-magnitude diagram. our sample has sfrs,luminosities, and velocity dispersions that are similar to the samples of faintcompact blue galaxies studied previously in the same redshift range by koo et.al 1995, guzman et. al 1996 &amp; phillips et. al 1997. however, our sample is ~2mag fainter in surface brightness than the compact blue galaxies. we find thatthe star-formation histories for a majority of the galaxies are consistent witha recent starburst within the last 100 myr.

0905.0162	mid-ir luminosities and uv/optical star formation rates at z&lt;1.4	uv continuum and mid-ir emission constitute two widely used star formationindicators at intermediate and high redshifts. we study 2430 galaxies withz&lt;1.4 in the extended groth strip with mips 24 mic observations from fidel,spectroscopy from deep2, and uv, optical, and near-ir photometry from aegis.the data are coupled with stellar population models and bayesian sed fitting toestimate dust-corrected sfrs. in order to probe the dust heating from stellarpopulations of various ages, the derived sfrs were averaged over varioustimescales--from 100 myr for "current" sfr to 1--3 gyr for long-timescale sfrs.these sed-based uv/optical sfrs are compared to total infrared luminositiesextrapolated from 24 mic observations. we find that for the blue, actively starforming galaxies the correlation between the ir luminosity and the uv/opticalsfr shows a decrease in scatter when going from shorter to longer sfr-averagingtimescales. we interpret this as the greater role of intermediate age stellarpopulations in heating the dust than what is typically assumed. this holds overthe entire redshift range. many so-called green valley galaxies are simplydust-obscured actively star-forming galaxies. however, there exist 24mic-detected galaxies, some with l&gt;10^11 l_sun, yet with little current starformation. for them a reasonable amount of dust absorption of stellar light issufficient to produce the observed levels of ir. in our sample optical andx-ray agns do not contribute on average more than ~50% to the mid-irluminosity, and we see no evidence for a large population of "ir excess"galaxies (abridged).

0908.4133	tracers of stellar mass-loss. i. optical and near-ir colours and surface  brightness fluctuations	we present optical and ir integrated colours and sbf magnitudes, computedfrom stellar population synthesis models that include emission from the dustyenvelopes surrounding tp-agb stars undergoing mass-loss. we explore the effectsof varying the mass-loss rate by one order of magnitude around the fiducialvalue, modifying accordingly both the stellar parameters and the output spectraof the tp-agb stars plus their dusty envelopes. the models are single burst,and range in age from a few myr to 14 gyr, and in metallicity between $z$ =0.0001 and $z$ = 0.07; they combine new calculations for the evolution of starsin the tp-agb phase, with star plus envelope seds produced with the radiativetransfer code dusty. we compare these models to optical and near-ir data ofsingle agb stars and magellanic star clusters. this comparison validates thecurrent understanding of the role of mass-loss in determining stellarparameters and spectra in the tp-agb. however, neither broad-band colours norsbf measurements in the optical or the near-ir can discern global changes inthe mass-loss rate of a stellar population. we predict that mid-ir sbfmeasurements can pick out such changes, and actually resolve whether a relationbetween metallicity and mass-loss exists.

0910.4975	resolved maps of stellar mass and sed of galaxies from optical/nir  imaging and sps models	we report on the method developed by zibetti, charlot and rix (2009) toconstruct resolved stellar mass maps of galaxies from optical and nir imaging.accurate pixel-by-pixel colour information (specifically g-i and i-h) isconverted into stellar mass-to-light ratios with typical accuracy of 30%, basedon median likelihoods derived from a monte carlo library of 50,000 stellarpopulation synthesis models that include dust and updated tp-agb phaseprescriptions. hence, surface mass densities are computed. in a pilot study, weanalyze 9 galaxies spanning a broad range of morphologies. among the mainresults, we find that: i) galaxies appear much smoother in stellar mass mapsthan at any optical or nir wavelength; ii) total stellar mass estimates basedon unresolved photometry are biased low with respect to the integral ofresolved stellar mass maps, by up to 40%, due to dust obscured regions beingunder-represented in global colours; iii) within a galaxy, on local scalescolours correlate with surface stellar mass density; iv) the slope andtightness of this correlation reflect/depend on the morphology of the galaxy.

0912.0528	a simple model to interpret the ultraviolet, optical and infrared seds  of galaxies	we present a simple, largely empirical but physically motivated model, whichis designed to interpret consistently multi-wavelength observations from largesamples of galaxies in terms of physical parameters, such as star formationrate, stellar mass and dust content. our model is both simple and versatileenough to allow the derivation of statistical constraints on the star formationhistories and dust contents of large samples of galaxies using a wide range ofultraviolet, optical and infrared observations. we illustrate this by derivingmedian-likelihood estimates of a set of physical parameters describing thestellar and dust contents of local star-forming galaxies from the spitzerinfrared nearby galaxy sample (sings) and from a newly-matched sample of sdssgalaxies observed with galex, 2mass, and iras. the model reproduces well theobserved spectral energy distributions of these galaxies across the entirewavelength range from the far-ultraviolet to the far-infrared. we findimportant correlations between the physical parameters of galaxies which areuseful to investigate the star formation activity and dust properties ofgalaxies. our model can be straightforwardly applied to interpret observedultraviolet-to-infrared spectral energy distributions (seds) from any galaxysample.

1001.2309	new insight into the relation between star formation activity and dust  content in galaxies	(abridged) we assemble a sample of 3258 low-redshift galaxies from the sdssdr6 with complementary photometric observations by galex, 2mass and iras atfar-ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths. we use a recent, simple butphysically motivated model to interpret the observed spectral energydistributions of the galaxies in this sample in terms of statisticalconstraints on physical parameters describing the star formation history anddust content. the focus on a subsample of 1658 galaxies with highest s/nobservations enables us to investigate most clearly several strong correlationsbetween various derived physical properties of galaxies. we find that thetypical dust mass of a star-forming correlates remarkably well with the starformation rate (sfr). we also find that the dust-to-stellar mass ratio, theratio of dust mass to star formation rate and the fraction of dust luminositycontributed by the diffuse interstellar medium all correlate strongly withspecific sfr. a comparison with recent models of chemical and dust evolution ofgalaxies suggests that these correlations could arise, at least in part, froman evolutionary sequence. as galaxies form stars, their ism becomes enriched indust, while the drop in gas supply makes the specific sfr decrease.interestingly, as a result, a young, actively star-forming galaxy with lowdust-to-gas ratio may still be highly dusty because it contains large amountsof interstellar gas. this may be important for the interpretation of theinfrared emission from young, gas-rich star-forming galaxies at high redshift.our study provides a useful local reference for future statistical studies ofthe star formation and dust properties of galaxies at high redshifts.

1002.3156	timing the starburst-agn connection	the mass of super massive black holes at the centre of galaxies is tightlycorrelated with the mass of the galaxy bulges which host them. this observedcorrelation implies a mechanism of joint growth, but the precise physicalprocesses responsible are a matter of some debate. here we report on the growthof black holes in 400 local galactic bulges which have experienced a strongburst of star formation in the past 600myr. the black holes in our sample havetypical masses of 10^6.5-10^7.5 solar masses, and the active nuclei havebolometric luminosities of order 10^42-10^44erg/s. we combine stellar continuumindices with h-alpha luminosities to measure a decay timescale of ~300myr forthe decline in star formation after a starburst. during the first 600myr aftera starburst, the black holes in our sample increase their mass by on-average 5%and the total mass of stars formed is about 1000 times the total mass accretedonto the black hole. this ratio is similar to the ratio of stellar to blackhole mass observed in present-day bulges. we find that the average rate ofaccretion of matter onto the black hole rises steeply roughly 250myr after theonset of the starburst. we show that our results are consistent with a simplemodel in which 0.5% of the mass lost by intermediate mass stars in the bulge isaccreted by the black hole, but with a suppression in the efficiency of blackhole growth at early times plausibly caused by supernova feedback, which isstronger at earlier times. we suggest this picture may be more generallyapplicable to black hole growth, and could help explain the strong correlationbetween bulge and black hole mass.

0708.0533	a census of metals and baryons in stars in the local universe	we combine stellar metallicity and stellar mass estimates for a large sampleof galaxies drawn from the sdss dr2 spanning wide ranges in physicalproperties, in order to derive an inventory of the total mass of metals andbaryons locked up in stars today. physical parameter estimates are derived fromgalaxy spectra with high s/n (&gt;20). coadded spectra of galaxies with similarvelocity dispersions, absolute r-band magnitudes and 4000\aa-break values areused for those regions of parameter space where individual spectra have lowers/n. we estimate the total density of metals and of baryons in stars and, fromthese two quantities, we obtain a mass- and volume-averaged stellar metallicityof &lt;z_star&gt;=1.04+-0.14 z_sun, i.e. consistent with solar. we also study howmetals are distributed in galaxies according to their mass, morphology and age,and we then compare these distributions with the corresponding distributions ofstellar mass. we find that the bulk of metals locked up in stars in the localuniverse reside in massive, bulge-dominated galaxies, with red colours and high4000\aa-break values corresponding to old stellar populations. bulge-dominatedand disc-dominated galaxies contribute similar amounts to the total stellarmass density, but have different fractional contributions to the mass densityof metals in stars, in agreement with the mass-metallicity relation.bulge-dominated galaxies contain roughly 40% of the total amount of metals instars, while disc-dominated galaxies less than 25%. finally, at a given galaxystellar mass, we define two characteristic ages as the median of thedistributions of mass and metals as a function of age. these characteristicages decrease progressively from high-mass to low-mass galaxies, consistentwith the high formation epochs of stars in massive galaxies.

0709.3304	hst morphologies of local lyman break galaxy analogs i: evidence for  starbursts triggered by merging	heckman et al. (2005) used the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) uv imagingsurvey to show that there exists a rare population of nearby compactuv-luminous galaxies (uvlgs) that closely resembles high redshift lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs). we present hst images in the uv, optical, and ha, andresimulate them at the depth and resolution of the goods/udf fields to showthat the morphologies of uvlgs are also similar to those of lbgs. our sample of8 lbg analogs thus provides detailed insight into the connection between starformation and lbg morphology. faint tidal features or companions can be seen inall of the rest-frame optical images, suggesting that the starbursts are theresult of a merger or interaction. the uv/optical light is dominated byunresolved (~100-300 pc) super starburst regions (ssbs). a detailed comparisonwith the galaxies haro 11 and vv 114 at z=0.02 indicates that the ssbsthemselves consist of diffuse stars and (super) star clusters. the structuralfeatures revealed by the new hst images occur on very small physical scales andare thus not detectable in images of high redshift lbgs, except in a few caseswhere they are magnified by gravitational lensing. we propose, therefore, thatlbgs are mergers of gas-rich, relatively low-mass (~10^10 msun) systems, andthat the mergers trigger the formation of ssbs. if galaxies at high redshiftsare dominated by ssbs, then the faint end slope of the luminosity function ispredicted to have slope alpha~2. our results are the most direct confirmationto date of models that predict that the main mode of star formation in theearly universe was highly collisional.

1106.1646	empirical determination of the shape of dust attenuation curves in  star-forming galaxies	we present a systematic study of the shape of the dust attenuation curve instar-forming galaxies from the far ultraviolet to the near infrared(0.15-2microns), as a function of specific star formation rate (ssfr) and axisratio (b/a), for galaxies with and without a significant bulge. our samplecomprises 23,000 (15,000) galaxies with a median redshift of 0.07, withphotometric entries in the sdss, ukidss-las (and galex-ais) survey cataloguesand emission line measurements from the sdss spectroscopic survey. we develop anew pair-matching technique to isolate the dust attenuation curves from thestellar continuum emission. the main results are: (i) the slope of theattenuation curve in the optical varies weakly with ssfr, strongly with b/a,and is significantly steeper than the milky way extinction law inbulge-dominated galaxies; (ii) the nir slope is constant, and matches the slopeof the milky way extinction law; (iii) the uv has a slope change consistentwith a dust bump at 2175aa which is evident in all samples and varies stronglyin strength with b/a in the bulge-dominated sample; (iv) there is a strongincrease in emission line-to-continuum dust attenuation with both decreasingssfr and increasing b/a; (v) radial gradients in dust attenuation increasestrongly with increasing ssfr, and the presence of a bulge does not alter thestrength of the gradients. these results are consistent with the picture inwhich young stars are surrounded by dense `birth clouds' with low coveringfactor which disperse on timescales of ~1e7 years and the diffuse interstellardust is distributed in a centrally concentrated disk with a smaller scaleheightthan the older stars that contribute the majority of the red and nir light.[abridged]

1201.0780	relative merits of different types of rest-frame optical observations to  constrain galaxy physical parameters	we present a new approach to constrain galaxy physical parameters from thecombined interpretation of stellar and nebular emission in wide ranges ofobservations. this approach relies on the bayesian analysis of any type ofgalaxy spectral energy distribution using a comprehensive library of syntheticspectra assembled using state-of-the-art models of star formation and chemicalenrichment histories, stellar population synthesis, nebular emission andattenuation by dust. we focus on the constraints set by 5-band photometry andlow- and medium-resolution spectroscopy at optical rest wavelengths on a set ofphysical parameters characterizing the stars and the interstellar medium. sincethese parameters cannot be known a priori for any galaxy sample, we assess theaccuracy to which they can be retrieved by simulating `pseudo-observations'using models with known parameters. assuming that these models are goodapproximations of true galaxies, we find that the combined analysis of stellarand nebular emission in low-resolution galaxy spectra provides valuableconstraints on all physical parameters. at higher resolution, the analysis ofthe combined stellar and nebular emission in 12,660 sdss star-forming galaxiesusing our approach yields likelihood distributions of stellar mass, gas-phaseoxygen abundance, optical depth of the dust and specific star formation ratesimilar to those obtained in previous separate analyses of the stellar andnebular emission at the original (twice higher) sdss spectral resolution. weshow that the constraints derived on galaxy physical parameters from thesedifferent types of observations depend sensitively on signal-to-noise ratio.our approach can be extended to the analysis of any type of observation acrossthe wavelength range covered by spectral evolution models.

1205.4717	near infrared spectroscopy of post-starburst galaxies: a limited impact  of tp-agb stars on galaxy seds	we present vlt-isaac nir spectro-photometric observations of 16post-starburst (psb) galaxies aimed at constraining the debated influence oftp-agb stars on the sed of galaxies with stellar ages of 0.5-2 gyr, criticalfor high-redshift studies. psb galaxies have negligible on-going star formationand a sed dominated by the stars formed in a recent (&lt;2 gyr) burst. byspectroscopically selecting psb galaxies with mean luminosity-weighted agesbetween 0.5 and 1.5 gyr and a broad range of metallicities, we explore theparameter space around the peak of the relative energy output of tp-agb stars.crucially, we target galaxies at z~0.2, so that two main spectral features oftp-agb stars (c-molecule band-head drops at 1.41 and 1.77mum), which areheavily absorbed by our atmosphere for targets at z~0, move inside the h and katmospheric windows and can be constrained for the first time to high accuracy.our findings provide key constraints to stellar population synthesis models: i)the nir regions around 1.41 and 1.77mum (rest-frame) are featureless for allgalaxies in our sample over the whole range of relevant ages and metallicitiesat variance with the maraston (2005) tp-agb heavy models, which exhibit markeddrops there; ii) no flux boosting is observed in the nir. the optical-nir sedsof most of our psb galaxies can be consistently reproduced with bruzual &amp;charlot (2003) models, using either simple stellar populations of correspondinglight-weighted ages and metallicities, or a more realistic burst plus an oldpopulation containing &lt;~60% of the total stellar mass. in contrast, allcombinations of this kind based on the maraston (2005) models are unable tosimultaneously reproduce the smoothness of the nir spectra and the relativelyblue optical-nir colours in the observations. the data collected in this studyappear to disfavour tp-agb heavy models with respect to tp-agb light ones.

1212.3869	evolution of the sizes of galaxies over 7&lt;z&lt;12 revealed by the 2012  hubble ultra deep field campaign	we analyze the redshift- and luminosity-dependent sizes of dropout galaxycandidates in the redshift range z~7-12 using deep images from the udf12campaign, data which offers two distinct advantages over that used in earlierwork. firstly, we utilize the increased s/n ratio offered by the udf12 imagingto provide improved size measurements for known galaxies at z=6.5-8 in thehudf. specifically, we stack the new deep f140w image with the existing f125wdata in order to provide improved measurements of the half-light radii ofz-dropouts. similarly we stack this image with the new deep udf12 f160w imageto obtain new size measurements for a sample of y-dropouts. secondly, becausethe udf12 data have allowed the construction of the first robust galaxy samplein the hudf at z&gt;8, we have been able to extend the measurement of averagegalaxy size out to significantly higher redshifts. restricting our sizemeasurements to sources which are now detected at &gt;15sigma, we confirm earlierindications that the average half-light radii of z~7-12 galaxies are extremelysmall, 0.3-0.4 kpc, comparable to the sizes of giant molecular associations inlocal star-forming galaxies. we also confirm that there is a clear trend ofdecreasing half-light radius with increasing redshift, and provide the firstevidence that this trend continues beyond z~8. modeling the evolution of theaverage half-light radius as a power-law (1+z)^s, we obtain a best-fit index ofs=-1.28+/-0.13 over the redshift range z~4-12, mid-way between the physicallyexpected evolution for baryons embedded in dark halos of constant mass (s=-1)and constant velocity (s=-1.5). a clear size-luminosity relation, such as thatfound at lower redshift, is also evident in both our z- and y-dropout sample.this relation can be interpreted in terms of a constant surface density of starformation over a range in luminosity of 0.05-1.0l*_z=3.(abridged)

1303.6631	insights into the content and spatial distribution of dust from the  integrated spectral properties of galaxies	[abridged] we present a new approach to investigate the content and spatialdistribution of dust in structurally unresolved star-forming galaxies from theobserved dependence of integrated spectral properties on galaxy inclination. wedevelop an innovative combination of generic models of radiative transfer (rt)in dusty media with a prescription for the spectral evolution of galaxies, viathe association of different geometric components of galaxies with stars indifferent age ranges. we show that a wide range of rt models all predict aquasi-universal relation between slope of the attenuation curve at anywavelength and v-band attenuation optical depth in the diffuse interstellarmedium (ism), at all galaxy inclinations. this relation predicts steeper(shallower) dust attenuation curves than both the calzetti and mw curves atsmall (large) attenuation optical depths, which implies that geometry andorientation effects have a stronger influence on the shape of the attenuationcurve than changes in the optical properties of dust grains. we use ourcombined rt and spectral evolution model to interpret the observed dependenceof the h\alpha/h\beta\ ratio and ugrizyjh attenuation curve on inclination in asample of ~23 000 nearby star-forming galaxies. from a bayesian mcmc fit, wemeasure the central face-on b-band optical depth of this sample to betau_b\perp~1.8\pm0.2. we also quantify the enhanced optical depth towards newlyformed stars in their birth clouds, finding this to be significantly larger ingalaxies with bulges than in disc-dominated galaxies, while tau_b\perp isroughly similar in both cases. finally, we show that neglecting the effect ofgeometry and orientation on attenuation can severely bias the interpretation ofgalaxy spectral energy distributions, as the impact on broadband colours canreach up to 0.3-0.4 mag at optical wavelengths and 0.1 mag at near-infraredones.

0801.1678	new insights into the stellar content and physical conditions of  star-forming galaxies at z = 2-3 from spectral modelling	we have used extensive libraries of model and empirical galaxy spectra(assembled respectively from the population synthesis code of bruzual andcharlot and the fourth data release of the sloan digital sky survey) tointerpret some puzzling features seen in the spectra of high redshiftstar-forming galaxies. we show that a stellar he ii 1640 emission line,produced in the expanding atmospheres of of and wolf-rayet stars, should bedetectable with an equivalent width of 0.5-1.5aa in the integrated spectra ofstar-forming galaxies, provided the metallicity is greater than about halfsolar. our models reproduce the strength of the he ii 1640 line measured in thespectra of lyman break galaxies for established values of their metallicities.with better empirical calibrations in local galaxies, this spectral feature hasthe potential of becoming a useful diagnostic of massive star winds at high, aswell as low, redshifts.  we also uncover a relationship in sdss galaxies between their location in the[o iii]/hb vs. [n ii]/ha diagnostic diagram (the bpt diagram) and their excessspecific star formation rate relative to galaxies of similar mass. we inferthat an elevated ionisation parameter u is at the root of this effect, andpropose that this is also the cause of the offset of high redshift star-forminggalaxies in the bpt diagram compared to local ones. we further speculate thathigher electron densities and escape fractions of hydrogen ionising photons maybe the factors responsible for the systematically higher values of u in the hii regions of high redshift galaxies. the impact of such differences onabundance determinations from strong nebular lines are considered and found tobe relatively minor.

1406.4132	hubble space telescope grism spectroscopy of extreme starbursts across  cosmic time: the role of dwarf galaxies in the star formation history of the  universe	near infrared slitless spectroscopy with the wide field camera 3, onboard thehubble space telescope, offers a unique opportunity to study low-mass galaxypopulations at high-redshift ($z\sim$1-2). while most high$-z$ surveys arebiased towards massive galaxies, we are able to select sources via theiremission lines that have very-faint continua. we investigate the star formationrate (sfr)-stellar mass ($m_{\star}$) relation for about 1000 emission-linegalaxies identified over a wide redshift range of $0.3 \lesssim z \lesssim2.3$. we use the h$_{\alpha}$ emission as an accurate sfr indicator and correctthe broadband photometry for the strong nebular contribution to derive accuratestellar masses down to $m_{\star} \sim 10^{7} m_{\odot}$. we focus here on asubsample of galaxies that show extremely strong emission lines (eelgs) withrest-frame equivalent widths ranging from 200 to 1500 \aa. this populationconsists of outliers to the normal sfr-$m_{\star}$ sequence with much higherspecific sfrs ($&gt; 10$ gyr$^{-1}$). while on-sequence galaxies follow acontinuous star formation process, eelgs are thought to be caught during anextreme burst of star formation that can double their stellar mass in less than$100$ myr. the contribution of starbursts to the total star formation densityappears to be larger than what has been reported for more massive galaxies inprevious studies. in the complete mass range $8.2 &lt;$ log($m_{\star}/m_{\odot}$)$&lt; 10$ and a sfr lower completeness limit of about 2 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (10$m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) at $z\sim1$ ($z \sim 2$), we find that starbursts havingew$_{rest}$(h$_{\alpha}$)$&gt;$ 300, 200, and 100 a contribute up to $\sim13$, 18,and 34 %, respectively, to the total sfr of emission-line selected sample at$z\sim1-2$. the comparison with samples of massive galaxies shows an increasein the contribution of starbursts towards lower masses.

1408.3649	spectroscopic detections of ciii]1909 at z~6-7: a new probe of early  star forming galaxies and cosmic reionisation	deep spectroscopic observations of z~6.5 galaxies have revealed a markeddecline with increasing redshift in the detectability of lyman-alpha emission.while this may offer valuable insight into the end of the reionisation process,it presents a fundamental challenge to the detailed spectroscopic study of themany hundreds of photometrically-selected distant sources now being found viadeep hst imaging, and particularly those bright sources viewed throughforeground lensing clusters. in this paper we demonstrate the validity of a newway forward via the convincing detection of an alternative diagnostic line,ciii]1909, seen in spectroscopic exposures of two star forming galaxies atz=6.029 and 7.213. the former detection is based on a 3.5 hour x-shooterspectrum of a bright (j=25.2) gravitationally-lensed galaxy behind the clusterabell 383. the latter detection is based on a 4.2 hour mosfire spectra of oneof the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxies, gn-108036, withj=25.2. both targets were chosen for their continuum brightness andpreviously-known redshift (based on lyman-alpha), ensuring that any ciii]emission would be located in a favorable portion of the near-infrared skyspectrum. we compare our ciii] and lyman-alpha equivalent widths in the contextof those found at z~2 from earlier work and discuss the motivation for usinglines other than lyman-alpha to study galaxies in the reionisation era.

1501.04726	the science case for multi-object spectroscopy on the european elt	this white paper presents the scientific motivations for a multi-objectspectrograph (mos) on the european extremely large telescope (e-elt). the moscase draws on all fields of contemporary astronomy, from extra-solar planets,to the study of the halo of the milky way and its satellites, and from resolvedstellar populations in nearby galaxies out to observations of the earliest'first-light' structures in the partially-reionised universe. the materialpresented here results from thorough discussions within the community over thepast four years, building on the past competitive studies to agree a commonstrategy toward realising a mos capability on the e-elt. the cases have beendistilled to a set of common requirements which will be used to define themosaic instrument, entailing two observational modes ('high multiplex' and'high definition'). when combined with the unprecedented sensitivity of thee-elt, mosaic will be the world's leading mos facility. in analysing therequirements we also identify a high-multiplex mos for the longer-term plansfor the e-elt, with an even greater multiplex (&gt;1000 targets) to enable studiesof large-scale structures in the high-redshift universe. following the greenlight for the construction of the e-elt the mos community, structured throughthe mosaic consortium, is eager to realise a mos on the e-elt as soon aspossible. we argue that several of the most compelling cases for elt science,in highly competitive areas of modern astronomy, demand such a capability. forexample, mos observations in the early stages of e-elt operations will beessential for follow-up of sources identified by the james webb space telescope(jwst). in particular, multi-object adaptive optics and accurate skysubtraction with fibres have both recently been demonstrated on sky, makingfast-track development of mosaic feasible.

0804.3091	the cosmic evolution of metallicity from the sdss fossil record	we present the time evolution of the stellar metallicity for sdss galaxies, asample that spans five orders of magnitude in stellar mass (10^7 - 10^{12}msun). assuming the bc03 stellar population models, we find that more massivegalaxies are more metal-rich than less massive ones at all redshifts; themass-metallicity relation is imprinted in galaxies from the epoch of formation.for galaxies with present stellar masses &gt; 10^{10} msun, the time evolution ofstellar metallicity is very weak, with at most 0.2-0.3 dex over a hubble time-for this reason the mass-metallicity relation evolves little with redshift.however, for galaxies with present stellar masses &lt; 10^{10} msun, the evolutionis significant, with metallicity increasing by more than a decade from redshift3 to the present. by being able to recover the metallicity history, we havemanaged to identify the origin of a recent discrepancy between the metallicityrecovered from nebular lines and absorption lines. as expected, we show thatthe young population dominates the former while the old population the latter.we have investigated the dependence on the stellar models used and find thatolder stellar population synthesis codes do not produce a clear result.finally, we have explored the relationship between cluster environment andmetallicity, and find a strong correlation in the sense that galaxies in highdensity regions have high metallicity.

1504.06881	spectroscopic detection of civ in a galaxy at z=7.045: implications for  the ionizing spectra of reionization-era galaxies	we present keck/mosfire observations of uv metal lines in four brightgravitationally-lensed z~6-8 galaxies behind the cluster abell 1703. thespectrum of a1703-zd6, a highly-magnified star forming galaxy with alyman-alpha redshift of z=7.045, reveals a confident detection of the nebularciv emission line (unresolved with fwhm &lt; 125 km/s). uv metal lines are notdetected in the three other galaxies. at z~2-3, nebular civ emission isobserved in just 1% of uv-selected galaxies. the presence of strong civemission in one of the small sample of galaxies targeted in this paper mayindicate hard ionizing spectra are more common at z~7. the total estimatedequivalent width of the civ doublet (38 a) and civ/lyman-alpha flux ratio (0.3)are comparable to measurements of narrow-lined agns. photoionization modelsshow that the nebular civ line can also be reproduced by a young stellarpopulation, with very hot metal poor stars dominating the photon fluxresponsible for triply ionizing carbon. regardless of the origin of the civ, weshow that the ionizing spectrum of a1703-zd6 is different from that of typicalgalaxies at z~2, producing more h ionizing photons per unit 1500a luminosityand a larger flux density at 30-50 ev. if such extreme radiation fields aretypical in uv-selected systems at z&gt;7, it would indicate that reionization-eragalaxies are more efficient ionizing agents than previously thought.alternatively, we suggest that the small sample of lyman-alpha emitters at z&gt;7may trace a rare population with intense radiation fields capable of ionizingtheir surrounding hydrogen distribution. additional constraints on highionization emission lines in galaxies with and without lyman-alpha detectionswill help clarify whether hard ionizing spectra are common in the reionizationera.

1507.07939	shards: a global view of the star formation activity at z~0.84 and  z~1.23	in this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of star-forming galaxies(sfgs) at intermediate redshifts (z~1). we combine the ultra-deep opticalspectro-photometric data from the survey for high-z absorption red and deadsources (shards) with deep uv-to-fir observations in the goods-n field.exploiting two of the 25 shards medium-band filters, f687w17 and f823w17, weselect [oii] emission line galaxies at z~0.84 and z~1.23 and characterize theirphysical properties. their rest-frame equivalent widths(ew$_{\mathrm{rf}}$([oii])), line fluxes, luminosities, star formation rates(sfrs) and dust attenuation properties are investigated. the evolution of theew$_{\mathrm{rf}}$([oii]) closely follows the sfr density evolution of theuniverse, with a trend of ew$_{\mathrm{rf}}$([oii])$\propto$(1+z)$^3$ up toredshift z~1, followed by a possible flattening. the sf properties of thegalaxies selected on the basis of their [oii] emission are compared withcomplementary samples of sfgs selected by their mir and fir emission, and alsowith a general mass-selected sample of galaxies at the same redshifts. wedemonstrate observationally that the uvj diagram (or, similarly, a cut in thespecific sfr) is only partially able to distinguish the quiescent galaxies fromthe sfgs. the sfr-m$_*$ relation is investigated for the different samples,yelding a logarithmic slope ~1, in good agreement with previous results. thedust attenuations derived from different sfr indicators (uv(1600), uv(2800),[oii], ir) are compared and show clear trends with respect to both the stellarmass and total sfr, with more massive and highly star-forming galaxies beingaffected by stronger dust attenuation.

0806.1020	a simple model to interpret the ultraviolet, optical and infrared  emission from galaxies	we present a simple, largely empirical but physically motivated model tointerpret the mid- and far-infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxiesconsistently with the emission at ultraviolet, optical and near-infraredwavelengths. our model relies on an existing angle-averaged prescription tocompute the absorption of starlight by dust in stellar birth clouds and in theambient ism in galaxies. we compute the spectral energy distribution of thepower reradiated by dust in stellar birth clouds as the sum of threecomponents: a component of pahs; a mid-ir continuum characterising the emissionfrom hot grains; and a component of warm grains in thermal equilibrium withadjustable temperature. in the ambient ism, we fix for simplicity the relativeproportions of these three components to reproduce the spectral shape ofdiffuse cirrus emission in the milky way, and we include a component of coldgrains in thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature. our model can beused to derive statistical constraints on the star formation histories and dustcontents of large samples of galaxies using uv, optical and ir observations. weillustrate this by deriving median-likelihood estimates of the star formationrates, stellar masses, effective dust optical depths, dust masses, and relativestrengths of different dust components of 66 well-studied nearby star- forminggalaxies from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxy survey (sings). from thisanalysis, we conclude that the mid- and far-ir colours of galaxies correlatestrongly with the specific star formation rate, as well as with othergalaxy-wide quantities connected to this parameter. our model can bestraightforwardly applied to interpret uv, optical and ir spectral energydistributions from any galaxy sample.

1511.08217	nuclear activity versus star formation: emission-line diagnostics at  ultraviolet and optical wavelengths	in the context of observations of the rest-frame ultraviolet and opticalemission from distant galaxies, we explore the emission-line properties ofphotoionization models of active and inactive galaxies. our aim is to identifynew line-ratio diagnostics to discriminate between gas photoionization byactive galactic nuclei (agn) and star formation. we use a standardphotoionization code to compute the emission from agn narrow-line regions andcompare this with calculations of the nebular emission from star-forminggalaxies achieved using the same code. we confirm the appropriateness of widelyused optical spectral diagnostics of nuclear activity versus star formation andexplore new diagnostics at ultraviolet wavelengths. we find that combinationsof a collisionally excited metal line or line multiplet, such as civ 1548,1551,oiii]1661,1666, niii]1750, [siiii]1883+[siiii]1892 and [ciii]1907+ciii]1909,with the heii 1640 recombination line are individually good discriminants ofthe nature of the ionizing source. diagrams involving at least 3 of these linesallow an even more stringent distinction between active and inactive galaxies,as well as valuable constraints on interstellar gas parameters and the shape ofthe ionizing radiation. several line ratios involving ne-based emission lines,such as [neiv]2424, [neiii]3343 and [nev]3426, are also good diagnostics ofnuclear activity. our results provide a comprehensive framework to identify thesources of photoionization and physical conditions of the ionized gas from theultraviolet and optical nebular emission from galaxies. this will beparticularly useful to interpret observations of high-redshift galaxies withfuture facilities, such as the james webb space telescope and extremely largeground-based telescopes.

astro-ph;0004367	theoretical predictions for surface brightness fluctuations and  implications for stellar populations of elliptical galaxies	(abridged) we present new theoretical predictions for surface brightnessfluctuations (sbfs) using models optimized for this purpose. our predictionsagree well with sbf data for globular clusters and elliptical galaxies. weprovide refined theoretical calibrations and k-corrections needed to use sbfsas standard candles. we suggest that sbf distance measurements can be improvedby using a filter around 1 micron and calibrating i-band sbfs with theintegrated v-k galaxy color. we also show that current sbf data provide usefulconstraints on population synthesis models, and we suggest sbf-based tests forfuture models. the data favor specific choices of evolutionary tracks andspectra in the models among the several choices allowed by comparisons based ononly integrated light. in addition, the tightness of the empirical i-band sbfcalibration suggests that model uncertainties in post-main sequence lifetimesare less than +/-50% and that the imf in ellipticals is not much steeper thanthat in the solar neighborhood. finally, we analyze the potential of sbfs forprobing unresolved stellar populations. we find that optical/near-ir sbfs aremuch more sensitive to metallicity than to age. therefore, sbf magnitudes andcolors are a valuable tool to break the age/metallicity degeneracy. our initialresults suggest that the most luminous stellar populations of bright clustergalaxies have roughly solar metallicities and about a factor of three spread inage.

(1996) to a 50% completeness magnitude limit of[f160w]=23.8. this field is located at a distance of 08'50" (~9 kpc) south ofthe center of the galaxy. the luminosity function (lf) shows a markeddiscontinuity at [f160w]=20.0. this is 1-2 mag above the tip of the red giantbranch (trgb) expected for an old population (~12 gyr) at the distance modulusof ngc 5128. we propose that the majority of stars above the trgb haveintermediate ages (~2 gyr), in agreement with the wfpc2 observations of soriaet al. (1996). five stars with magnitudes brighter than the lf discontinuityare most probably due to galactic contamination. the weighted average of themean giant branch color above our 50% completeness limit is[f110w]-[f160w]=1.22+-0.08 with a dispersion of 0.19 mag. from ourartificial-star experiments we determine that the observed spread in color isreal, suggesting a real spread in metallicity. we estimate the lower and upperbounds of the stellar metallicity range by comparisons with observations ofgalactic star clusters and theoretical isochrones. assuming an old population,we find that, in the halo field of ngc 5128 we surveyed, stars havemetallicities ranging from roughly 1% of solar at the blue end of the colorspread to roughly solar at the red end, with a mean of [fe/h]=-0.76 and adispersion of 0.44 dex.

astro-ph;0107357	surface brightness fluctuations of fornax cluster galaxies: calibration  of infrared sbfs and evidence for recent star formation	we have measured k-band surface brightness fluctuations (sbfs) of 19early-type galaxies in the fornax cluster. combining our results with publisheddata, we find the absolute sbf magnitude mbar_k = (-5.84)+(3.6)*[(v-i)-1.15].the intrinsic cosmic scatter of mbar_k appears to be larger than that of i-bandsbfs. the discovery of a correlation between k-band sbfs and v-i color is a newclue into the star formation histories of early-type galaxies. this relationnaturally accounts for galaxies previously claimed to have anomalously brightk-band sbfs, namely m32 and ngc 4489. models indicate that the stellarpopulations dominating the sbf signal have a significant range in age; somescatter in metallicity may also be present. the youngest ages imply somegalaxies have very luminous giant branches, akin to those in intermediate-age(few gyr) magellanic cloud clusters. a few fornax galaxies have unusuallybright k-band sbfs, perhaps originating from a high metallicity burst of starformation in the last few gyr. the increased spread and brightening of thek-band sbfs with bluer (v-i) colors suggest that the lower mass clustergalaxies may have had more extended and more heterogeneous star formationhistories than those of the more massive galaxies.

astro-ph;0402030	the environmental dependence of the relations between stellar mass,  structure, star formation and nuclear activity in galaxies	we use a complete sample of galaxies drawn from the sdss to study howstructure, star formation and nuclear activity depend on local density and onstellar mass. local density is estimated by counting galaxies above a fixedabsolute magnitude limit within cylinders 2 mpc in projected radius and +-500km/s in depth. the stellar mass distribution of galaxies shifts by nearly afactor of two towards higher masses between low and high density regions. atfixed stellar mass, both star formation and nuclear activity depend strongly onlocal density, while structural parameters such as size and concentration arealmost independent of it. the galaxy property most sensitive to environment isspecific star formation rate. for galaxies with stellar masses less than 3 x10^10 m_sun, the median sfr/m* decreases by more than a factor of 10 from lowto high densities. this decrease is less marked for massive galaxies. at fixedstellar mass, twice as many galaxies host agn with strong [oiii] emission inlow density regions as in high. massive galaxies in low-density environmentsalso contain more dust. we have analyzed correlations between spectroscopicindicators that probe sfh on different timescales (d4000, hdelta_a and sfr/m*).the correlations do not depend on environment, suggesting that the decrease instar formation has ocurred over long (&gt;1 gyr) timescales. since structure doesnot depend on environment for more massive galaxies, trends in recent sfh, dustand agn for these systems cannot be driven by processes that alter structure,e.g. mergers. the sfh-density correlation is strongest for small scale (&lt; 1mpc) estimates of local density. finally, we highlight a striking similaritybetween changes in the galaxy population as a function of density and as afunction of redshift and we interpret this using n-body simulations.

astro-ph;0406218	present-day growth of black holes and bulges: the sdss perspective	we investigate the accretion-driven growth of supermassive black holes in thelow-redshift universe using 23,000 ``type 2'' agn and the complete sample of123,000 galaxies in the sdss from which they were drawn. we use the stellarvelocity dispersions of the early type galaxies and agn hosts to estimate theirblack hole masses and we use the agn [oiii]5007 emission line luminosities toestimate black hole accretion rates. we find that most present-day accretionoccurs onto black holes with masses &lt; 10e8 msun that reside in moderatelymassive galaxies (m ~ 10e10 to 10e11.5 msun) with high stellar densities(~10e8.5 to 10e9.5 msun/kpc^2) and young stellar populations. thevolume-averaged accretion rates of low mass black holes (&lt;10e7.5 msun) implythat this population is growing on a timescale that is comparable to the age ofthe universe. around half this growth takes place in agn that are radiatingwithin a factor of five of the eddington luminosity. such systems are rare,making up only 0.2% of the low mass black hole population at the present day.the rest of the growth occurs in lower luminosity agn. the growth timescale ismore than two orders of magnitude longer for the population of the most massiveblack holes in our sample. the volume averaged ratio of star formation to blackhole accretion in bulge-dominated galaxies is ~1000, in remarkable agreementwith the observed ratio of stellar mass to black hole mass in nearby galaxybulges. we conclude: a) that bulge formation and black hole formation aretightly coupled, even in present-day galaxies; and b) that the evolution of theagn luminosity function documented in recent optical and x-ray surveys isdriven by a decrease in the characteristic mass scale of accreting black holes.

astro-ph;0411354	new constraints on the star formation histories and dust attenuation of  galaxies in the local universe from galex	we derive a variety of physical parameters including star formation rates(sfrs), dust attenuation and burst mass fractions for 6472 galaxies observed bythe galaxy evolution explorer (galex) and present in the sdss dr1 mainspectroscopic sample. parameters are estimated in a statistical way bycomparing each observed broad-band sed (two galex and five sdss bands) with anextensive library of model galaxy seds, which cover a wide range of starformation histories and include stochastic starbursts. we compare theconstraints derived using sdss bands only with those derived using thecombination of sdss and galex photometry. we find that the addition of thegalex bands leads to significant improvement in the estimation of both the dustoptical depth and the star formation rate over timescales of 100 myr to 1 gyrin a galaxy. we are sensitive to sfrs as low as 10^{-3} m_sun/yr, and we findthat low levels of star formation (sf) are mostly associated with early-type,red galaxies. the least massive galaxies have ratios of current topast-averaged sf rates (b-parameter) consistent with constant sf over a hubbletime. for late-type galaxies, this ratio on average decreases with mass. wefind that b correlates tightly with nuv-r color, implying that the sf historyof a galaxy can be constrained on the basis of the nuv-r color alone. thefraction of galaxies that have undergone a significant starburst episode withinthe last 1 gyr steeply declines with mass-from ~20% for galaxies with ~10^8m_sun to ~5% for ~10^11 m_sun galaxies.

astro-ph;0412577	the properties of ultraviolet-luminous galaxies at the current epoch	we have used the first matched set of galex and sdss data to investigate theproperties of a sample of 74 nearby galaxies with far-ultraviolet luminositieschosen to overlap the luminosity range of typical high-z lyman break galaxies(lbgs). galex deep surveys have shown that ultraviolet-luminous galaxies(uvlgs) similar to these are the fastest evolving component of the uv galaxypopulation. model fits to the combined galex and sdss photometry yield typicalfuv extinctions similar to lbgs. the implied star formation rates are sfr ~ 3to 30 solar mass per year. this overlaps the range of sfrs for lbgs. we find astrong inverse correlation between galaxy mass and far-ultraviolet surfacebrightness, and on this basis divide the sample into ``large'' and ``compact''uvlgs. the compact uvlgs have half-light radii of a few kpc or less (similar tolbgs). they are relatively low mass galaxies (~10 billion solar masses) withtypical velocity dispersions of 60 to 150 km/s. they span a range inmetallicity from 0.3 to 1 times solar, have blue optical-uv colors, and areforming stars at a rate sufficient to build the present galaxy in ~a gigayear.in all these respects they appear similar to the lbg population. these ``livingfossils'' may therefore provide an opportunity for detailed investigation ofthe physical processes occurring in typical star forming galaxies in the earlyuniverse.

astro-ph;0506539	the ages and metallicities of galaxies in the local universe	we derive stellar metallicities, light-weighted ages and stellar masses for amagnitude-limited sample of 175,128 galaxies drawn from the sloan digital skysurvey data release two (sdss dr2). we compute median-likelihood estimates ofthese parameters using a large library of model spectra at medium-highresolution, covering a comprehensive range of star formation histories. theconstraints we derive are set by the simultaneous fit of five spectralabsorption features, which are well reproduced by our population synthesismodels. by design, these constraints depend only weakly on the alpha/fe elementabundance ratio. our sample includes galaxies of all types spanning the fullrange in star formation activity, from dormant early-type to activelystar-forming galaxies. we show that, in the mean, galaxies follow a sequence ofincreasing stellar metallicity, age and stellar mass at increasing 4000aa-breakstrength (d4000). for galaxies of intermediate mass, stronger balmer absorptionat fixed d4000 is associated with higher metallicity and younger age. weinvestigate how stellar metallicity and age depend on total galaxy stellarmass. low-mass galaxies are typically young and metal-poor, massive galaxiesold and metal-rich, with a rapid transition between these regimes over thestellar mass range 3x10^9&lt;m/msun&lt;3x10^10. both high- and low-concentrationgalaxies follow these relations, but there is a large dispersion in stellarmetallicity at fixed stellar mass, especially for low-concentration galaxies ofintermediate mass. despite the large scatter, the relation between stellarmetallicity and stellar mass is similar to the correlation between gas-phaseoxygen abundance and stellar mass for star-forming galaxies.

astro-ph;0510405	gas infall and stochastic star formation in galaxies in the local  universe	we study the recent star formation histories of local galaxies by analyzingthe scatter in their colours and spectral properties. we present evidence thatthe distribution of star formation histories changes qualitatively above acharacteristic stellar surface mass density of 3x10^8 m_sol kpc^-2,corresponding to the transition between disk-dominated and bulge-dominatedgalaxies. when we average over subpopulations of galaxies with densities belowthis value, we find that subpopulations of all masses form their stars at thesame average rate per unit stellar mass. however, the scatter in galaxy coloursand emission line strengths is larger for more compact galaxies of a givenmass. this suggests that star formation occurs in shorter, higher amplitudeevents in galaxies with smaller sizes. above the characteristic density, galaxygrowth through star formation shuts down. we propose that star formation eventsare triggered when cold gas is accreted onto a galaxy. we have used the newhigh resolution millennium simulation of structure formation in a concordancelcdm universe to quantify the incidence of these accretion events and we showthat the observational data are well fit by a model in which the consumptiontime of accreted gas decreases with the surface density of the galaxy as t_cons\propto mu*^-1. the dark matter halos hosting massive galaxies with highdensities are also expected to grow through accretion, but the observationsindicate that star formation in bulge- dominated galaxies is no longer coupledto the hierarchical build-up of their surrounding dark matter halos.

astro-ph;0511203	extracting star formation histories from medium-resolution galaxy  spectra	we adapt an existing data compression algorithm, moped, to the extraction ofmedian-likelihood star formation (sf) histories from medium-resolution galaxyspectra. by focusing on the high-pass components of galaxy spectra, we minimizepotential uncertainties arising from the spectro-photometric calibration andintrinsic attenuation by dust. we validate our approach using model high-passspectra of galaxies with different sf histories covering the wavelength range3650-8500 a at a resolving power of about 2000. we show that the method canrecover the full sf histories of these models, without prior knowledge of themetallicity, to within an accuracy that depends sensitively on signal-to-noiseratio. the investigation of the sensitivity of the flux at each wavelength tothe mass fraction of stars of different ages allows us to identify newage-sensitive features in galaxy spectra. we also highlight a fundamentallimitation in the recovery of the sf histories of galaxies for which theoptical signatures of intermediate-age stars are masked by those of younger andolder stars. we apply this method to derive average sf histories from thehighest-quality spectra of morphologically identified early- and late-typegalaxies in the sdss edr [...]. we also investigate the constraints set by thehigh-pass signal in the stacked spectra of a magnitude-limited sample ofsdss-edr galaxies on the global sf history of the universe. we confirm that thestellar populations in the most massive galaxies today appear to have formed onaverage earlier than those in the least massive ones. our results do notsupport the recent suggestion of a statistically significant peak in the sfactivity of the universe at redshifts below unity, although such a peak is notruled out [abridged].

astro-ph;0604138	stellar populations in the nuclei of late-type spiral galaxies	(abridged) as part of an ongoing effort to study the stellar nuclei of verylate-type, bulge-less spirals, we present results from a high-resolutionspectroscopic survey of nine such nuclear star clusters, undertaken withvlt/uves. we fit the spectra with population synthesis models and measurelick-type indices to determine mean luminosity-weighted ages, which range from4.1*10^7 to 1.1*10^10 years and are insensitive to assumed metallicity orinternal extinction. the average metallicity of nuclear clusters in late-typespirals is slightly sub-solar (&lt;z&gt; = 0.015) but shows significant scatter. thefits also show that the nuclear cluster spectra are best described by a mix ofseveral generations of stars. this is supported by the fact that only modelswith composite stellar populations yield mass-to-light ratios that match thoseobtained from dynamical measurements. the last star formation episode was onaverage 34 myr ago, while all clusters experienced some star formation in thelast 100 myr. we thus conclude that the nuclear clusters undergo repeatedepisodes of star formation. the robustness with respect to possiblecontamination from the underlying galaxy disk is demonstrated by comparison tospectra obtained with hst/stis. combining these results with those from walcheret al. (2005), we have thus shown that the stellar nuclei of these bulge-lessgalaxies are massive and dense star clusters that form stars recurrently untilthe present day. this unique set of properties is likely due to the centrallocation of these clusters in their host galaxies.

astro-ph;0608531	the star formation histories of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey	we present the results of a moped analysis of ~3 x 10^5 galaxy spectra fromthe sloan digital sky survey data release three (sdss dr3), with a number ofimprovements in data, modelling and analysis compared with our previousanalysis of dr1. the improvements include: modelling the galaxies withtheoretical models at a higher spectral resolution of 3\aa; better calibrateddata; an extended list of excluded emission lines, and a wider range of dustmodels. we present new estimates of the cosmic star formation rate, theevolution of stellar mass density and the stellar mass function from the fossilrecord. in contrast to our earlier work the results show no conclusive peak inthe star formation rate out to a redshift around 2 but continue to showconclusive evidence for `downsizing' in the sdss fossil record. the starformation history is now in good agreement with more traditional instantaneousmeasures. the galaxy stellar mass function is determined over five decades ofmass, and an updated estimate of the current stellar mass density is presented.we also investigate the systematic effects of changes in the stellar populationmodelling, the spectral resolution, dust modelling, sky lines, spectralresolution and the change of data set. we find that the main changes in theresults are due to the improvements in the calibration of the sdss data,changes in the initial mass function and the theoretical models used.

astro-ph;0608594	galex uv color relations for nearby early-type galaxies	we use galex/optical photometry to construct color-color relationships forearly-type galaxies sorted by morphological type. we have matched objects inthe galex gr1 public release and the first ir1.1 internal release, with the rc3early-type galaxies having a morphological type -5.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5 with mean error int&lt;1.5, and mean error on (b-v)t&lt;0.05. after visual inspection of each match, weare left with 130 galaxies with a reliable galex pipeline photometry in thefar-uv and near-uv bands. this sample is divided into ellipticals (-5.5&lt;t&lt;-3.5)and lenticulars (-3.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5). after correction for the galactic extinction,the color-color diagrams fuv-nuv vs. (b-v)_{tc} are plotted for the twosubsamples. we find a tight anti-correlation between the fuv-nuv and (b-v)_{tc}colors for ellipticals, the uv color getting bluer when the (b-v)_{tc} getredder. this relationship very likely is an extension of the color-metallicityrelationship into the galex nuv band. we suspect that the main source of thecorrelation is metal line blanketing in the nuv band. the fuv-nuv vs b-vcorrelation has larger scatter for lenticular galaxies; we speculate thisreflects the presence of low level star formation. if the latter objects (i.e.those that are blue both in fuv-nuv and b-v) are interpreted as harboringrecent star formation activity, this would be the case for a few percent (~4%)of ellipticals and ~15% of lenticulars; this would make about 10% of early-typegalaxies with residual star formation in our full sample of 130 early-typegalaxies. we also plot fuv-nuv vs. the mg_2 index and central velocitydispersion. we find a tight anti-correlation between fuv-nuv and the mg_2index(...).

astro-ph;0609415	the diverse properties of the most ultraviolet luminous galaxies  discovered by the galaxy evolution explorer	we report on the properties of a sample of ultraviolet luminous galaxies(uvlgs) selected by matching the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) surveys withthe sloan digital sky survey third data release. out of 25362 galaxies between0.0&lt;z&lt;0.3 detected by galex, there are 215 galaxies with l&gt;2x10^10 l_solar at1530 angstroms (observed wavelength). the properties of this population arewell correlated with ultraviolet surface brightness. we find that the galaxieswith low uv surface brightness are primarily large spiral systems with amixture of old and young stellar populations, while the high surface brightnessgalaxies consist primarily of compact starburst systems. in terms of thebehavior of surface brightness with luminosity, size with luminosity, themass-metallicity relation, and other parameters, the compact uvlgs clearlydepart from the trends established by the full sample of galaxies. the subsetof compact uvlgs with the highest surface brightness (``supercompact uvlgs'')have characteristics that are remarkably similar to lyman break galaxies athigher redshift. they are much more luminous than typical localultraviolet-bright starburst galaxies and blue compact dwarf galaxies. theyhave metallicities that are systematically lower than normal galaxies of thesame stellar mass, indicating that they are less chemically evolved. in allthese respects, they are the best local analogs for lyman break galaxies.

astro-ph;0609436	ongoing formation of bulges and black holes in the local universe: new  insights from galex	we analyze a volume-limited sample of massive bulge-dominated galaxies withdata from both the sloan digital sky survey and the galaxy evolution explorer(galex) satellite. the galaxies have central velocity dispersions greater than100 km/s and stellar surface mass densities that lie above the value wheregalaxies transition from actively star forming to passive systems. the sampleis limited to redshifts 0.03&lt;z&lt;0.07. at these distances, the sdss spectrasample the light from the bulge-dominated central regions of the galaxies. thegalex nuv data provide high sensitivity to low rates of global star formationin these systems. our sample of bulge-dominated galaxies exhibits a much largerdispersion in nuv-r colour than in optical g-r colour. nearly all of thegalaxies with bluer nuv-r colours are agn. both galex images and sdss colourprofiles demonstrate that the excess uv light is associated with an extendeddisk. we find that galaxies with red outer regions almost never have a youngbulge or a strong agn. galaxies with blue outer regions have bulges and blackholes that span a wide range in age and accretion rate. galaxies with youngbulges and strongly accreting black holes almost always have blue outer disks.our suggested scenario is one in which the source of gas that builds the bulgeand black hole is a low mass reservoir of cold gas in the disk.the presence ofthis gas is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for bulge and black holegrowth. some mechanism must transport this gas inwards in a time variable way.as the gas in the disk is converted into stars, the galaxies will turn red, butfurther gas infall can bring them back into the blue nuv-r sequence.(abridged)

astro-ph;9605136	detection of strong evolution in the population of early-type galaxies	the standard picture holds that giant elliptical galaxies formed in a singleburst at high redshift. aging of their stellar populations subsequently causedthem to fade and become redder. the canada-france redshift survey provides asample of about 125 galaxies with the luminosities and colours of passivelyevolving giant ellipticals and with 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1. this sample is inconsistentwith the standard evolutionary picture with better than 99.9% confidence. thestandard schmidt test gives &lt;v/v_{max}&gt; = 0.398 when restricted to objects withno detected star formation, and &lt;v/v_{max}&gt; = 0.410 when objects with emissionlines are also included. a smaller sample of early-type galaxies selected fromtha hawaii deep survey gives equally significant results. with increasingredshift a larger and larger fraction of the nearby elliptical and s0population must drop out of of the sample, either because the galaxies are nolonger single units or because star formation alters their colours. if theremaining fraction is modelled as f=(1+z)^{-\gamma}, the data imply gamma = 1.5+- 0.3. at z=1 only about one third of bright e and s0 galaxies were alreadyassembled and had the colours of old passively evolving systems. we discuss thesensitivity of these results to the incompleteness corrections and stellarpopulation models we have adopted. we conclude that neither is uncertain enoughto reconcile the observations with the standard picture. hierarchical galaxyformation models suggest that both merging and recent star formation play arole in the strong evolution we have detected.

astro-ph;9704148	chemical enrichment and the origin of the colour-magnitude relation of  elliptical galaxies in a hierarchical merger model	in this paper, we present a model of the formation and chemical enrichment ofelliptical galaxies that differs from the conventional picture in two ways:1)ellipticals do not form in a single monolithic collapse and burst of starformation at high redshift. instead, most of their stars form at modest ratesin disk galaxies, which then merge to form the ellipticals. 2)galaxies do notundergo closed-box chemical evolution. instead, metals can be transferredbetween the stars, cold gas and the hot gas halos of the galaxies. it isassumed that metals are ejected out of disk galaxies during supernovaexplosions and these metals enter the hot gas component. the fact that metalsare more easily ejected from small galaxies leads to the establishment of amass-metallicity relation for the disk systems. big ellipticals are more metalrich because they are formed from the mergers of bigger disks. we usesemi-analytic techniques to follow the formation, evolution, and chemicalenrichment of cluster ellipticals in a merging hierarchy of dark matter halos.the inclusion of the new metallicity-dependent spectral synthesis models ofbruzual &amp; charlot allow us to compute the colours, line indices and mass-to-light ratios of these galaxies. if feedback is assumed to be efficient, we areable to reproduce the slope and scatter of the colour-magnitude and themg2-sigma relations. we also study the evolution of these relations to highredshift. we show that the luminosity-metallicity relation remains fixed, butthe mean stellar ages of the galaxies scale with the age of the universe.finally, we study the enrichment history of the intracluster gas. we find that80% of the metals were ejected by low-mass galaxies at redshifts greater than1. the metallicity of the icm thus evolves very little out to z &gt; 1.

astro-ph;9802233	the k-band luminosity function at z=1: a powerful constraint on galaxy  formation theory	there are two major approaches to modelling galaxy evolution. the traditionalview is that the most massive galaxies were assembled early and have evolvedwith steeply declining star formation rates since a redshift of 2 or higher.according to hierarchical theories, massive galaxies were assembled much morerecently from mergers of smaller subunits. here we present a simpleobservational test designed to differentiate between the two. the observedk-band flux from a galaxy is a good measure of its stellar mass even at highredshift. it is probably only weakly affected by dust extinction. we computethe evolution of the observed k-band luminosity function for traditional, pureluminosity evolution (ple) models and for hierarchical models. at z=0, bothmodels can fit the observed local k-band luminosity function. by redshift 1,they differ greatly in the predicted abundance of bright galaxies. we calculatethe redshift distributions of k-band selected galaxies and compare these withavailable data. we show that the number of k&lt;19 galaxies with redshifts greaterthan 1 is well below the numbers predicted by the ple models. in the songailaet al (1994) redshift sample of 118 galaxies with 16&lt;k&lt;18, 33 galaxies arepredicted to lie at z&gt;1. only 2 are observed. in the cowie et al. (1996)redshift sample of 52 galaxies with 18&lt;k&lt;19, 28 galaxies are predicted to lieat at z&gt;1. only 5 are observed. both these samples are more than 90% complete.we conclude that there is already strong evidence that the abundance of massivegalaxies at z=1 is well below the local value. this is inconsistent with thetraditional model, but similar to the expectations of hierarchical models.

astro-ph;9810031	evolution of elliptical galaxies in a hierarchical universe	in hierarchical models of galaxy formation, ellipticals form from the mergingof disk galaxies drawn together by gravity as their surrounding dark haloscoalesce. using semi-analytic techniques, we are able to follow the merging,star formation and chemical enrichment histories of galaxies for a given choiceof cosmological parameters. we calculate the ages and metallicities ofelliptical galaxies in a standard cdm cosmology and show that we can reproducethe observed correlation between magnitude and colour, and the scatter aboutthis relation. we also study the evolution of ellipticals to high redshift. inrich clusters, the models predict a substantial population of "evolved"ellipticals at z&gt;1. however, the average number density of bright ellipticalsmust decrease at high redshift. the rate of decrease is sensitive tocosmological parameters. in a high-density model, the abundance of brightellipticals declines by factor of 3 by z=1. in a low-density model (omega=0.3,lambda=0.7), the abundance drops by 30% at z=1, but is down by a factor 3 atz=2

0810.5122	post-starburst galaxies: more than just an interesting curiosity	from the vimos vlt deep survey (vvds) we select a sample of 16 galaxies withspectra which identify them as having recently undergone a strong starburst andsubsequent fast quenching of star formation. these post-starburst galaxies liein the redshift range 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.0 with masses &gt;10^9.75msun. they have a numberdensity of 1x10^-4 per mpc^3, almost two orders of magnitude sparser than thefull galaxy population with the same mass limit. we compare with simulations toshow that the galaxies are consistent with being the descendants of gas richmajor mergers. starburst mass fractions must be larger than ~5-10% and decaytimes shorter than ~10^8 years for post-starburst spectral signatures to beobserved in the simulations. we find that the presence of black hole feedbackdoes not greatly affect the evolution of the simulated merger remnants throughthe post-starburst phase. the multiwavelength spectral energy distributions ofthe post-starburst galaxies show that 5/16 have completely ceased the formationof new stars. these 5 galaxies correspond to a mass flux entering thered-sequence of rhodot(a-&gt;q, psb) = 0.0038msun/mpc^3/yr, assuming the definingspectroscopic features are detectable for 0.35gyr. if the galaxies subsequentlyremain on the red sequence, this accounts for 38(+4/-11)% of the growth rate ofthe red sequence. finally, we compare our high redshift results with a sampleof galaxies with 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1 observed in the sdss and ukidss surveys. we find avery strong redshift evolution: the mass density of strong post-starburstgalaxies is 230 times lower at z~0.07 than at z~0.7.
