hep-ph;9603210	$r_b$ and $r_c$ in the two higgs doublet model with flavor changing  neutral currents	a study of $r_b$ and $r_c$ is presented in the context of a two higgs doubletmodel (2hdm) with flavor changing scalar currents (fcsc). implications of themodel for the $\rho$-parameter and for $b\to s\gamma$ are also considered. theexperimental data on $r_b$ places stringent constraints on the modelparameters. the configuration of the model needed to account for $r_b$ is foundto be irreconcilable with constraints from $b\to s\gamma$ and $\rho$. inparticular, if $r^{\rm exp}_b&gt;r^{\sss{\rm sm}}_b$ persists then this version of2hdm will be ruled out or require significant modifications. noting thataspects of the experimental analysis for $r_b$ and $r_c$ may be of someconcern, we also disregard $r^{\rm exp}_b$ and $r^{\rm exp}_c$ and givepredictions for these using constraints from $b\to s\gamma$ and $\rho$parameter only. we emphasize the theoretical and experimental advantages of theobservable $r_{b+c}\equiv \gamma(z\to b\bar b\mbox{ or } c\barc)/\gamma(z\to\mbox{hadrons})$. we also stress the role of $r_\ell\equiv\gamma(z\to\mbox{hadrons})/\gamma(z\to \ell^+\ell^-)$ in testing the standardmodel (sm) despite its dependence on qcd corrections. noting that in modelswith fcnc the amplitude for $z\to c\bar c$ receives a contribution which growswith $m^2_t$, the importance and uniqueness of precision $z\to c\bar c$measurements for constraining flavor changing $t\bar c$ currents isunderscored.

hep-ph;9706337	improving constraints on tan(beta)/m_h using b \to d tau \bar{nu}	we study the q^2 dependence of the exclusive decay mode b \to d tau \bar{nu}in type ii two higgs doublet models and show that this mode may be used to putstringent bounds on tan(beta)/m_h. there are currently rather large theoreticaluncertainties in the q^2 distribution, but these may be significantly reducedby future measurements of the analogous distribution for b \to d(e,mu)\bar{nu}.we estimate that this reduction in the theoretical uncertainties wouldeventually (i.e., with sufficient data) allow one to push the upper bound ontan(beta)/m_h down to about 0.06 gev^{-1}. this would represent an improvementon the current bound by about a factor of 7. we then apply the method ofoptimized observables which allows us to estimate the reach of an experimentwith a given number of events. we thus find that an experiment with, forexample, 10^3 events could set a 2\sigma upper bound on tan(beta)/m_h of 0.07gev^{-1} or could differentiate at the 4.6\sigma level between a 2hdm withtan(beta)/m_h = 0.1 gev^{-1} and the sm.

hep-ph;9712287	the possibility of large direct cp violation in b to k pi-like modes due  to long distance rescattering effects and implications for the angle gamma	we consider the strong rescattering effects that can occur in the decays suchas b -&gt; k pi, k* pi, k rho... and their impact on direct cp violation in thesemodes. first we discuss, in general, how the cpt theorem constrains theresulting pattern of partial rate asymmetries leading to different brands ofdirect cp. traditional discussions have centered around the absorptive part ofthe penguin graph which has delta i=0 in b -&gt; s transitions and as a resultcauses ``simple'' cp violation; long-distance final state rescattering effects,in general, will lead to a different pattern of cp: ``compound'' cp violation.predictions of simple cp are quite distinct from that of compound cp. finalstates rescattering phases in b decays are unlikely to be small possiblycausing large compound cp violating partial rate asymmetries in these modes.cpt theorem requires a cancellation of pra due to compound cp amongst the$k\pi$ states themselves; thus there can be no net cancellation with otherstates such as k*\pi, k\rho etc. therefore, each class of such modes, namely kpi, k rho, k^*pi, k a_1 etc. can have large direct cp emanating fromrescattering effects. various repercussions for the angle $\gamma$ are alsodiscussed.

0904.1341	extended friedberg lee hidden symmetries, quark masses and cp-violation  with four generations	motivated in part by the several observed anomalies involving cp asymmetriesof b and b_s decays, we consider the standard model with a 4th sequentialfamily (sm4) which seems to offer a rather simple resolution. we initiallyassume t-invariance by taking the up and down-quark 4x4 mass matrix to be real.following friedberg and lee (fl), we then impose a "hidden" symmetry on theunobserved ("hidden") up and down-quark su(2) states. the hidden symmetry forfour generations ensures the existence of two zero-mass eigenstates, which wetake to be the (u,c) and (d,s) states in the up and down-quark sectors,respectively. then, we simultaneously break t-invariance and the hiddensymmetry by introducing two phase factors in each sector. this breakingmechanism generates the small quark masses m_u, m_c and m_d, m_s which, alongwith the orientation of the hidden symmetry, determine the size of cp-violationin the sm4. for illustration we choose a specific physical picture for thehidden symmetry and the breaking mechanism that reproduces the observed quarkmasses, mixing angles and cp-violation, and at the same time allows us tofurther obtain very interesting relations/predictions for the mixing angles oft and t'. for example, with this choice we get v_{td} ~ (v_{cb}/v_{cd} -v_{ts}/v_{us}) + o(\lambda^2) and v_{t'b} ~ v_{t'd}x(v_{cb}/v_{cd}), v_{tb'} ~v_{t'd}x(v_{ts}/v_{us}), implying that v_{t'd} &gt; v_{t'b},v_{tb'}. wefurthermore find that the cabibbo angle is related to the orientation of thehidden symmetry and that the key cp-violating quantity of our model athigh-energies, j_{sm4} = im[v_{tb} v_{t'b}^* v_{t'b'} v_{tb'}^*], which is thehigh-energy analogue of the jarlskog invariant of the sm, is proportional tothe light-quark masses and the measured ckm angles.

0707.0212	footprints of the beyond in flavor physics: possible role of the top two  higgs doublet model	the b-factories results provide an impressive confirmation of the standardmodel (sm) description of flavor and cp violation. nevertheless, as more datawere accumulated, deviations in the 2.5-3.5 sigma range have emerged pointingto the exciting possibility of new cp-odd phase(s) and flavor violatingparameters in b-decays. primarily this seems to be the case in the timedependent cp asymmetries in penguin dominated modes (e.g. b -&gt; phi (eta') ks).  we discuss these and other deviations from the sm and, as an illustration ofpossible new physics scenarios, we examine the role of the top two higgsdoublet model. this is a simple extension of the sm obtained by adding secondhiggs doublet in which the yukawa interactions of the two higgs doublets areassigned in order to naturally account for the large top-quark mass.  of course, many other extensions of the standard model could also account forthese experimental deviations. clearly if one takes these deviations seriouslythen some new particles in the 300 gev to few tev with associated new cp-oddphase(s) are needed.

0907.2057	the "4th generation", b-cp anomalies &amp; the lhc	attention is drawn to the several 2-3 $\sigma$ "anomalies" in b, $b_s$mixings and decays involving cp-observables. perhaps the most interestingtheoretical scenario that could cause such effects is based on warpedextra-dimensional models and indeed some of the effects were predicted there.however, a rather simple explanation is that based on a fourth family of quarkswith masses in the range of(400 - 600) gev. the built-in hierarchy of the4$\times$4 mixing matrix is such that the $t'$ readily provides a needed {\itperturbation} ($\approx 15%$) to $\sin 2 \beta$ as measured in $b \to \psi k_s$and simultaneously is the dominant source of cp asymmetry in $b_s \to \psi\phi$. the latter mode is theoretically very clean (unlike the others) andtherefore it would be extremely desirable that fermilab gives a very highpriority to clarify this anomaly at the earliest. 4th family explanationallows, with relative ease, to accomodate the stringent flavor changingconstraints which usually can be quite challenging for new physicsscenarios.implications for the lhc are briefly discussed; $t'$ and $b'$ lead tohigh $p_t$ multilepton events, in particular $b'$ decays produce ratherdistinctive same sign leptons with asymmetric energies.

0910.0260	measuring bs width difference at the upsilon(5s) using quantum  entanglement	about 90% of bs-bar bs pairs produced at the upsilon(5s) resonance areinitially bs*-bar bs* pairs which decay radiatively to bs-bar bs. this impliesthat the bs pair will then be in an eigenstate of charge conjugation (i.e.c=-1) and therefore in an entangled state. this allows for a determination ofdelta gamma/gamma and the cp phase using a number of possible correlationsbetween the decays of the two bs mesons. in particular, we consider the timeintegrated correlation; the time ordering asymmetry and the timeordering-charge asymmetry, which in addition to time ordering distinguishes bsfrom bs-bar, for various combinations of final states. with the statistics ofabout o(10^7-10^8) upsilon(5s) events available at b factories, we find thatthe time ordering asymmetry between suitably defined hadronic and flavorspecific (tagging) decays offers a promising method for determining the widthdifference. the corresponding time ordering-charge asymmetry can also bound themixing phase. similar observables involving exclusive decays are alsoconsidered. at the super b factories with o(50) times greater luminosity timeordering and time ordering-charge asymmetries between inclusive and exclusivemodes may also provide additional bounds on the phases in those decays;

1001.0569	collider signals of a composite higgs in the standard model with four  generations	recent fits of electroweak precision data to the standard model (sm) with a4th sequential family (sm4) point to a possible "three-prong compositesolution": (1) the higgs mass is at the tev-scale, (2) the masses of the 4thfamily quarks t',b' are of o(500) gev and (3) the mixing angle between the 4thand 3rd generation quarks is of the order of the cabibbo angle, \theta_{34} ~o(0.1). such a manifestation of the sm4 is of particular interest as it maysuggest that the higgs is a composite state, predominantly of the 4thgeneration heavy quarks. motivated by the above, we show that the three-prongcomposite solution to the sm4 can have interesting new implications for higgsphenomenology. for example, the higgs can decay to a single heavy 4thgeneration quark via the 3-body decays (through an off-shell t' or b') h -&gt;t'(bar) t'* -&gt; t'(bar) b w+ and h -&gt; b'(bar) b'* -&gt; b'(bar) t w-. these flavordiagonal decays can be dramatically enhanced at the lhc (by several orders ofmagnitudes) due to the large width effects of the resonating heavy higgs in theprocesses gg -&gt; h -&gt; t'(bar) t'* -&gt; t'(bar) b w+ and gg -&gt; h -&gt; b'(bar) b'* -&gt;b'(bar) t w-, thus yielding a viable signal above the corresponding continuumqcd production rates. in addition, the higgs can decay to a single t' and b' inthe loop-generated flavor changing (fc) channels h -&gt; b' b(bar), t' t(bar).these fc decays are essentially "gim-free" and can, therefore, have branchingratios as large as 10^{-4} - 10^{-3}.

1001.2023	neutral b-meson mixing from unquenched lattice qcd with domain-wall  light quarks and static b-quarks	we demonstrate a method for calculating the neutral b-meson decay constantsand mixing matrix elements in unquenched lattice qcd with domain-wall lightquarks and static b-quarks. our computation is performed on the "2+1" flavorgauge configurations generated by the rbc and ukqcd collaborations with alattice spacing of a approx 0.11 fm (a^-1 = 1.729 gev) and a lattice spatialvolume of approximately (1.8 fm)^3. we simulate at three different light seaquark masses with pion masses down to approximately 430 mev, and extrapolate tothe physical quark masses using a phenomenologically-motivated fit functionbased on next-to-leading order heavy-light meson su(2) chiral perturbationtheory. for the b-quarks, we use an improved formulation of the eichten-hillaction with static link-smearing to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. we alsoimprove the heavy-light axial current used to compute the b-meson decayconstant to o(alpha_s p a) using one-loop lattice perturbation theory. wepresent initial results for the su(3)-breaking ratios f_{b_s}/f_{b_d} and xi =f_{b_s} sqrt{b_{b_s}}/f_{b_d} sqrt{b_{b_d}}, thereby demonstrating theviability of the method. for the ratio of decay constants, we findf_{b_s}/f_{b_d} = 1.15(12) and for the ratio of mixing matrix elements, we findxi = 1.13(12), where in both cases the errors reflect the combined statisticaland systematic uncertainties, including an estimate of the size of neglectedo(1/m_b) effects.

0709.0007	lhc signals for warped electroweak neutral gauge bosons	we study signals at the large hadron collider (lhc) for kaluza-klein (kk)excitations of the electroweak gauge bosons in the framework with the standardmodel (sm) gauge and fermion fields propagating in a warped extra dimension.such a framework addresses both the planck-weak and flavor hierarchy problemsof the sm. unlike the often studied z' cases, in this framework, there arethree neutral gauge bosons due to the underlying su(2)_l x su(2)_r x u(1)_xgauge group in the bulk. furthermore, couplings of these kk states to lightquarks and leptons are suppressed, whereas those to top and bottom quarks areenhanced compared to the sm gauge couplings. therefore, the production of lightquark and lepton states is suppressed relative to other beyond the smconstructions, and the fermionic decays of these states are dominated by thetop and bottom quarks, which are, though, overwhelmed by kk gluons dominantlydecaying into them. however, as we emphasize in this paper, decays of thesestates to longitudinal w, z and higgs are also enhanced similarly to the caseof top and bottom quarks. we show that the w, z and higgs final states can givesignificant sensitivity at the lhc to 2 (3) tev kk scale with an integratedluminosity of 100 invfb (1 invab). since current theoretical framework(s) favorkk masses greater than about 3 tev, luminosity upgrade of lhc is likely to becrucial in observing these states.

1206.4062	the radion as a harbinger of deca-tev physics	precision data generally require the threshold for physics beyond thestandard model to be at the deca-tev (10 tev) scale or higher. this raises thequestion of whether there are interesting deca-tev models for which the lhc mayfind direct clues. a possible scenario for such physics is a 5d warped model offermion masses and mixing, with kaluza-klein masses m_kk ~ 10 tev, allowing itto avoid tension with stringent constraints, especially from flavor data.discovery of a standard-model-like higgs boson, for which there are some hintsat ~125 gev at the lhc, would also require the kk masses to be at or above 10tev. these warped models generically predict the appearance of a much lighterradion scalar. we find that, in viable warped models of flavor, a radion with amass of a few hundred gev and an inverse coupling of order m_kk ~ 10 tev couldtypically be accessible to the lhc experiments -- with sqrt(s) = 14 tev and 100fb^-1 of data. the above statements can be applied, mutatis mutandis, to 4ddual models, where conformal dynamics and a dilaton replace warping and theradion, respectively. detection of such a light and narrow scalar could thusherald the proximity of a new physical threshold and motivate experiments thatwould directly probe the deca-tev mass scale.

0711.3175	search for rs gravitons via $w_l w_l$ decays	the original randall-sundrum (rs) model with a warped extra dimension alongwith extensions provides the possibility for a simultaneous solution toplanck-weak hierarchy problem as well as the flavor puzzle in the standardmodel (sm). the most distinctive feature of this scenario is the existence ofkaluza-klein (kk) gravitons whose masses and couplings to the sm fields are setby the tev scale. in some realistic versions of this framework, the largestcoupling of the gravitons to the observed particles is to the top quark andunphysical higgses ($w^{\pm}_l$ and $z_l$) with the kk graviton (g) massespredicted to be $\gsim$ 4 tev. we extend earlier works on the kk gravitondecays to the $t\bar{t}$ final state and to the ``gold-plated'' $z_l z_l$ modes(with each z decaying to $e^+ e^-$ or to $\mu^+ \mu^-$) by studying theresonant production of the gravitons and their subsequent decay to $w_l w_l$pair. we find that with 300 $fb^{-1}$ integrated luminosity of data thesemileptonic $g \to w (\to l \nu_l) w(\to 2 jets)$ mode offers a goodopportunity to search for the rs kk graviton mode with mass lighter than $\sim$3-3.5 tev at the cern lhc. efficient ww mass reconstruction in the semileptonicmode combined with an analysis of dilepton mass distribution in the purelyleptonic channel, $pp \to w (\to l \nu_l) w(\to l^\prime \nu_{l^\prime})$ mayhelp to observe kk $z^\prime$ and kk graviton separately. suitably definedaverage energy of the charged lepton in the semileptonic mode may be used todistinguish decays from longitudinal versus transverse w-bosons.

1209.4081	the 125 gev higgs in the context of four generations with 2 higgs  doublets	we interpret the recent discovery of a 125 gev higgs-like state in thecontext of a two higgs doublets model with a heavy 4th sequential generation offermions, in which one higgs doublet couples only to the 4th generationfermions, while the second doublet couples to the lighter fermions of the1st-3rd families. this model is designed to accommodate the apparent heavinessof the 4th generation fermions and to effectively address the low-energyphenomenology of a dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking scenario. thephysical higgs states of the model are, therefore, viewed as compositesprimarily of the 4th generation fermions. we find that the lightest higgs, h,is a good candidate for the recently discovered 125 gev spin-zero particle,when tan\beta ~ o(1), for typical 4th generation fermion masses of m_{4g} = 400-600 gev, and with a large t - t' mixing in the right-handed quarks sector.this, in turn, leads to br(t' -&gt; t h) ~ o(1), which drastically changes the t'decay pattern. we also find that, based on the current higgs data, this twohiggs doublet model generically predicts an enhanced production rate (comparedto the sm) in the pp -&gt; h -&gt; tau tau channel and a reduced vv -&gt; h -&gt; gammagamma and pp -&gt; v -&gt; vh -&gt; vbb ones. finally, the heavier cp-even higgs isexcluded by the current data up to m_h ~ 500 gev, while the pseudoscalar state,a, can be as light as 130 gev. these heavier higgs states and the expecteddeviations from the sm in some of the higgs production channels can be furtherexcluded or discovered with more data.

1211.1026	searching for the origin of cp violation in cabibbo suppressed d-meson  decays	the recent evidence of large direct cp violation in d0 decay at lhcb suggeststhat such cp studies may become an important avenue for understanding cp. inthis paper, we make several suggestions to try to clarify the role of newphysics in these results. we propose that the enhancement needed in thestandard model to attribute the observed cp violation in d to two pseudoscalarmodes may not operate for inclusive final states where asymmetries will likelyapproximate the quark level expectation. experimentally testing this principlerequires a search for cp asymmetries in final states containing k and k-barwith a total energy of less than m_d. we also propose that cp asymmetries maybe enhanced in modes where the tree is color suppressed. in particular, thefinal state rho0 rho0 is of special interest; similarly ds-&gt; rho0 k+ and rho0k*+ likewise appear interesting. we discuss how isospin symmetry yieldsobservables sensitive to certain classes of new physics and suppressed in thestandard model. some modes considered in this context are d-&gt; pi pi, rho pi,rho rho as well as ds-&gt; k* pi. we also consider how such analysis mayeventually be supplemented by information about the weak phases in d0 decay. inorder to obtain this information experimentally, we consider various methodsfor preparing an initial state which is a quantum mechanical mixture of d0 andd0-bar. this may be done through the use of natural d0 d0-bar oscillations;observing d0-mesons which arise from bd or bs mesons which themselves areoscillating or from quantum correlations in d0 pairs which arise from eitherpsi" decay or b-meson decay. observing cp violation in the magnitudes of decayamplitudes should be within the capability of experiments in the near futurehowever obtaining the weak phases through the methods we discuss will likelyrequire future generations of machines.

1302.2915	hybrid dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking with heavy quarks and the  125 gev higgs	existing models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking (ewsb) find itvery difficult to get a higgs of mass lighter than $m_t$. consequently, inlight of the lhc discovery of the ~125 gev higgs, such models face asignificant obstacle. moreover, with three generations those models have asuperheavy cut-off around $10^{17}$ gev, requiring a significant fine-tuning.to overcome these twin difficulties, we propose a hybrid framework for ewsb, inwhich the higgs mechanism is combined with a nambu-jona-lasinio mechanism. themodel introduces a strongly coupled doublet of heavy quarks with a mass around500 gev, which forms a condensate at a compositeness scale $\lambda$ about afew tev, and an additional unconstrained scalar doublet which behaves as a"fundamental" doublet at $\lambda$. this "fundamental"-like doublet has avanishing quartic term at $\lambda$ and is, therefore, not the sm doublet, butshould rather be viewed as a pseudo-goldstone boson of the underlying strongdynamics. this setup is matched at the compositeness scale $\lambda$ to atightly constrained hybrid two higgs doublet model, where both the compositeand unconstrained scalars participate in ewsb. this allows us to get a goodcandidate for the recently observed 125 gev scalar which has properties verysimilar to the standard model higgs. the heavier (mostly composite) cp-evenscalar has a mass around 500 gev, while the pseudoscalar and the charged higgsparticles have masses in the range 200 -300 gev.

hep-ph;0701186	warped gravitons at the lhc and beyond	we study the production and decay of kaluza-klein (kk) gravitons at the largehadron collider (lhc), in the framework of a warped extra dimension in whichthe standard model (sm) fields propagate. such a scenario can provide solutionsto both the planck-weak hierarchy problem and the flavor puzzle of the sm. inthis scenario, the production via $q \bar{q}$ annihilation and decays to theconventional photon and lepton channels are highly suppressed. however, we showthat graviton production via gluon fusion followed by decay to longitudinal$z/w$ can be significant; vector boson fusion is found to be a sub-dominantproduction mode. in particular, the ``golden'' $zz$ decay mode offers adistinctive 4-lepton signal that could lead to the observation at the lhc with300 fb$^{-1}$ (slhc with 3 ab$^{-1}$) of a kk graviton with a mass up to $\sim2$ ($\sim 3$) tev for the ratio of the ads$_5$ curvature to the planck scalemodestly above unity. we argue that (contrary to the lore) such a size of thecurvature scale can still be within the regime of validity of the framework.upgrades beyond the slhc luminosity are required to discover gravitons heavierthan $\sim 4$ tev, as favored by the electroweak and flavor precision tests inthe simplest such models.
