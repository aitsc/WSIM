0706.1500	x-ray flares in orion low mass stars	context. x-ray flares are common phenomena in pre-main sequence stars. theiranalysis gives insights into the physics at work in young stellar coronae. theorion nebula cluster offers a unique opportunity to study large samples ofyoung low mass stars. this work is part of the chandra orion ultradeep project(coup), an ~10 day long x-ray observation of the orion nebula cluster (onc).aims. our main goal is to statistically characterize the flare-like variabilityof 165 low mass (0.1-0.3 m_sun) onc members in order to test and constrain thephysical scenario in which flares explain all the observed emission. methods.we adopt a maximum likelihood piece-wise representation of the observed x-raylight curves and detect flares by taking into account both the amplitude andtime derivative of the count-rate. we then derive the frequency and energydistribution of the flares. results. the high energy tail of the energydistribution of flares is well described by a power-law with index 2.2. we testthe hypothesis that light curves are built entirely by overlapping flares witha single power law energy distribution. we constrain the parameters of thissimple model for every single light curve. the analysis of synthetic lightcurves obtained from the model indicates a good agreement with the observeddata. comparing low mass stars with stars in the mass interval (0.9-1.2m_sun),we establish that, at ~1 myr, low mass and solar mass stars of similar x-rayluminosity have very similar flare frequencies. conclusions. our observationalresults are consistent with the following model/scenario: the light curves areentirely built by over- lapping flares with a power-law intensity distribution;the intense flares are individually detected, while the weak ones merge andform a pseudo-quiescent level, which we indicate as the characteristic level.

0706.3332	x-ray flares on the uv ceti-type star cc eridani: a "peculiar"  time-evolution of spectral parameters	context: weak flares are supposed to be an important heating agent of theouter layers of stellar atmospheres. however, due to instrumental limitations,only large x-ray flares have been studied in detail until now.  aims: we used an xmm-newton observation of the very active by-dra type binarystar cc eri in order to investigate the properties of two flares that areweaker than those typically studied in the literature.  methods: we performed time-resolved spectroscopy of the data taken with theepic-pn ccd camera. a multi-temperature model was used to fit the spectra. weinferred the size of the flaring loops using the density-temperature diagram.the loop scaling laws were applied for deriving physical parameters of theflaring plasma. we also estimated the number of loops involved in the observedflares.  results: a large x-ray variability was found. spectral analysis showed thatall the regions in the light curve, including the flare segments, arewell-described by a 3-t model with variable emission measures but,surprisingly, with constant temperatures (values of 3, 10 and 22 mk). theanalysed flares lasted ~ 3.4 and 7.1 ks, with flux increases of factors1.5-1.9. they occurred in arcades made of a few tens of similar coronal loops.the size of the flaring loops is much smaller than the distance between thestellar surfaces in the binary system, and even smaller than the radius of eachof the stars. the obtained results are consistent with the following ideas: (i)the whole x-ray light curve of cc eri could be the result of a superposition ofmultiple low-energy flares, and (ii) stellar flares can be scaled-up versionsof solar flares.

0912.1799	x-ray emitting mhd accretion shocks in classical t tauri stars. case for  moderate to high plasma-beta values	aims. we investigate the stability and dynamics of accretion shocks in cttss,considering the case of beta &gt;= 1 in the post-shock region. in these cases the1d approximation is not valid and a multi-dimensional mhd approach isnecessary.  methods. we model an accretion stream propagating through the atmosphere of actts and impacting onto its chromosphere, by performing 2d axisymmetric mhdsimulations. the model takes into account the stellar magnetic field, thegravity, the radiative cooling, and the thermal conduction (including theeffects of heat flux saturation).  results. the dynamics and stability of the accretion shock strongly dependson the plasma beta. in the case of shocks with beta &gt; 10, violent outflows ofshock-heated material (and possibly mhd waves) are generated at the base of theaccretion column and strongly perturb the surrounding stellar atmosphere andthe accretion column itself (modifying, therefore, the dynamics of the shock).in shocks with beta ~ 1, the post-shock region is efficiently confined by themagnetic field. the shock oscillations induced by cooling instability arestrongly influenced by beta: for beta &gt; 10, the oscillations may be rapidlydumped by the magnetic field, approaching a quasi-stationary state, or may bechaotic with no obvious periodicity due to perturbation of the stream inducedby the post-shock plasma itself; for beta ~ 1 the oscillations arequasi-periodic, although their amplitude is smaller and the frequency higherthan those predicted by 1d models.

1002.2121	on the importance of background subtraction in the analysis of coronal  loops observed with trace	in the framework of trace coronal observations, we compare the analysis anddiagnostics of a loop after subtracting the background with two different andindependent methods. the dataset includes sequences of images in the 171 a, 195a filter bands of trace. one background subtraction method consists in takingas background values those obtained from interpolation between concentricstrips around the analyzed loop. the other method is a pixel-to-pixelsubtraction of the final image when the loop had completely faded out, alreadyused by reale &amp; ciaravella 2006. we compare the emission distributions alongthe loop obtained with the two methods and find that they are considerablydifferent. we find differences as well in the related derive filter ratio andtemperature profiles. in particular, the pixel-to-pixel subtraction leads tocoherent diagnostics of a cooling loop. with the other subtraction thediagnostics are much less clear. the background subtraction is a delicate issuein the analysis of a loop. the pixel-to-pixel subtraction appears to be morereliable, but its application is not always possible. subtraction frominterpolation between surrounding regions can produce higher systematic errors,because of intersecting structures and of the large amount of subtractedemission in trace observations.

1004.1604	spatial identification of the overionized plasma in w49b	recent suzaku x-ray observations of the ejecta-dominated supernova remnantw49b have shown that in the global spectrum there is a clear indication for thepresence of overionized plasma whose physical origin is still under debate. inorder to ascertain the physical origin of such a rapidly cooling plasma, wefocus on the study of its spatial localization within the x-ray emittingejecta. we confirm the presence of a saw-edged excess (interpreted as a strongradiative recombination continuum) in the global spectrum above 8 kev, emergingabove the ionization-equilibrium model. we produce a hardness ratio map todetermine where the plasma is overionized and we perform a spectral analysis ofthe regions with and without strong overionization. we find that theoverionized plasma is localized in the center of the remnant and in its westernjet, while it is not detected in the bright eastern jet, where the expansion ofthe ejecta is hampered by their interaction with a dense interstellar cloud.the location of overionized plasma suggests that the inner ejecta are rapidlycooling by expansion, unlike the outer ejecta, for which expansion is hamperedby interstellar clouds seen in h2

1007.2423	on the observability of t tauri accretion shocks in the x-ray band	context. high resolution x-ray observations of classical t tauri stars(cttss) show a soft x-ray excess due to high density plasma (n_e=10^11-10^13cm^-3). this emission has been attributed to shock-heated accreting materialimpacting onto the stellar surface. aims. we investigate the observability ofthe shock-heated accreting material in the x-ray band as a function of theaccretion stream properties (velocity, density, and metal abundance) in thecase of plasma-beta&lt;&lt;1 in the post-shock zone. methods. we use a 1-dhydrodynamic model describing the impact of an accretion stream onto thechromosphere, including the effects of radiative cooling, gravity and thermalconduction. we explore the space of relevant parameters and synthesize from themodel results the x-ray emission in the [0.5-8.0] kev band and in the resonancelines of o vii (21.60 ang) and ne ix (13.45 ang), taking into account theabsorption from the chromosphere. results. the accretion stream propertiesinfluence the temperature and the stand-off height of the shocked slab and itssinking in the chromosphere, determining the observability of the shockedplasma. our model predicts that x-ray observations preferentially detectemission from low density and high velocity shocked accretion streams due tothe large absorption of dense post-shock plasma. in all the cases examined, thepost-shock zone exhibits quasi-periodic oscillations due to thermalinstabilities, but in the case of inhomogeneous streams and beta&lt;&lt;1, the shockoscillations are hardly detectable. conclusions. we suggest that, if accretionstreams are inhomogeneous, the selection effect introduced by the absorption onobservable plasma components may explain the discrepancy between the accretionrate measured by optical and x-ray data as well as the different densitiesmeasured using different he-like triplets in the x-ray band.

1011.5915	multi-wavelength diagnostics of accretion in an x-ray selected sample of  cttss	high resolution x-ray spectroscopy has revealed soft x-rays from high densityplasma in classical t-tauri stars (cttss), probably arising from the accretionshock region. however, the mass accretion rates derived from the x-rayobservations are consistently lower than those derived from uv/optical/nirstudies. we aim to test the hypothesis that the high density soft x-rayemission is from accretion by analysing optical accretion tracers from an x-rayselected sample of cttss in a homogeneous manner. we analyse optical spectra ofa sample of cttss and calculate the accretion rates based on measuring opticalemission lines. these are then compared to the accretion rates derived from thex-ray spectroscopy. we find that, for each ctts in our sample, the differentoptical tracers predict mass accretion rates that agree within the errors,albeit with a spread of ~1 order of magnitude. typically, mass accretion ratesderived from halpha and hei 5876 ang are larger than those derived from hbeta,hgamma and oi. when comparisons of the optical mass accretion rates are made tothe x-ray derived mass accretion rates, we find that: a) the latter are alwayslower (but by varying amounts); b) the latter range within a factor of ~2around 2x10^{-10} m_odot yr^{-1}, despite the fact that the former span a rangeof ~3 orders of magnitude. we suggest that the systematic underestimation ofthe x-ray derived mass accretion rates could depend on the density distributioninside the accretion streams, where the densest part of the stream is notvisible in the x-ray band because of the absorption by the stellar atmosphere.we also suggest that a non-negligible optical depth of x-ray emission linesproduced by post-shock accreting plasma may explain the almost constant massaccretion rates derived in x-rays if the effect is larger in stars with largeroptical mass accretion rates.

1104.5107	mass accretion to young stars triggered by flaring activity in  circumstellar disks	young low-mass stars are characterized by ejection of collimated outflows andby circumstellar disks which they interact with through accretion of mass. theaccretion builds up the star to its final mass and is also believed to powerthe mass outflows, which may in turn remove the excess angular momentum fromthe star-disk system. however, although the process of mass accretion is acritical aspect of star formation, some of its mechanisms are still to be fullyunderstood. a point not considered to date and relevant for the accretionprocess is the evidence of very energetic and frequent flaring events in thesestars. flares may easily perturb the stability of the disks, thus influencingthe transport of mass and angular momentum. here we report on three-dimensionalmagnetohydrodynamic modeling of the evolution of a flare with an idealizednon--equilibrium initial condition occurring near the disk around a rotatingmagnetized star. the model takes into account the stellar magnetic field, thegravitational force, the viscosity of the disk, the magnetic-field-orientedthermal conduction (including the effects of heat flux saturation), theradiative losses from optically thin plasma, and the coronal heating. we showthat, during its first stage of evolution, the flare gives rise to a hotmagnetic loop linking the disk to the star. the disk is strongly perturbed bythe flare: disk material evaporates under the effect of the thermal conductionand an overpressure wave propagates through the disk. when the overpressurereaches the opposite side of the disk, a funnel flow starts to develop there,accreting substantial disk material onto the young star from the side of thedisk opposite to the flare.

1205.4553	the role of radiative losses in the late evolution of pulse-heated  coronal loops/strands	radiative losses from optically thin plasma are an important ingredient formodeling plasma confined in the solar corona. spectral models are continuouslyupdated to include the emission from more spectral lines, with significanteffects on radiative losses, especially around 1 mk. we investigate the effectof changing the radiative losses temperature dependence due to upgrading ofspectral codes on predictions obtained from modeling plasma confined in thesolar corona. the hydrodynamic simulation of a pulse-heated loop strand isrevisited comparing results using an old and a recent radiative lossesfunction. we find significant changes in the plasma evolution during the latephases of plasma cooling: when the recent radiative loss curve is used, theplasma cooling rate increases significantly when temperatures reach 1-2 mk.such more rapid cooling occurs when the plasma density is larger than athreshold value, and therefore in impulsive heating models that cause the loopplasma to become overdense. the fast cooling has the effect of steepening theslope of the emission measure distribution of coronal plasmas with temperatureat temperatures lower than ~2 mk. the effects of changes in the radiativelosses curves can be important for modeling the late phases of the evolution ofpulse-heated coronal loops, and, more in general, of thermally unstableoptically thin plasmas.

1207.4665	x-raying hot plasma in solar active regions with the sphinx spectrometer	the detection of very hot plasma in the quiescent corona is important fordiagnosing heating mechanisms. the presence and the amount of such hot plasmais currently debated. the sphinx instrument on-board coronas-photon mission issensitive to x-ray emission well above 1 kev and provides the opportunity todetect the hot plasma component. we analyzed the x-ray spectra of the solarcorona collected by the sphinx spectrometer in may 2009 (when two activeregions were present). we modelled the spectrum extracted from the whole sunover a time window of 17 days in the 1.34-7 kev energy band by adopting thelatest release of the aped database. the sphinx broadband spectrum cannot bemodelled by a single isothermal component of optically thin plasma and twocomponents are necessary. in particular, the high statistics and the accuratecalibration of the spectrometer allowed us to detect a very hot component at ~7million k with an emission measure of ~2.7 x 10^44 cm^-3. the x-ray emissionfrom the hot plasma dominates the solar x-ray spectrum above 4 kev. we checkedthat this hot component is invariably present both at high and low emissionregimes, i.e. even excluding resolvable microflares. we also present anddiscuss a possible non-thermal origin (compatible with a weak contribution fromthick-target bremsstrahlung) for this hard emission component. our resultssupport the nanoflare scenario and might confirm that a minor flaring activityis ever-present in the quiescent corona, as also inferred for the coronae ofother stars.

0801.3857	geometry diagnostics of a stellar flare from fluorescent x-rays	we present evidence of fe fluorescent emission in the chandra hetgs spectrumof the single g-type giant hr 9024 during a large flare. in analogy to solarx-ray observations, we interpret the observed fe k$\alpha$ line as beingproduced by illumination of the photosphere by ionizing coronal x-rays, inwhich case, for a given fe photospheric abundance, its intensity depends on theheight of the x-ray source. the hetgs observations, together with 3d montecarlo calculations to model the fluorescence emission, are used to obtain adirect geometric constraint on the scale height of the flaring coronal plasma.we compute the fe fluorescent emission induced by the emission of a singleflaring coronal loop which well reproduces the observed x-ray temporal andspectral properties according to a detailed hydrodynamic modeling. thepredicted fe fluorescent emission is in good agreement with the observed valuewithin observational uncertainties, pointing to a scale height $\lesssim0.3$\rstar. comparison of the hr 9024 flare with that recently observed on iipeg by swift indicates the latter is consistent with excitation by x-rayphotoionization.

1309.5038	radiative accretion shocks along nonuniform stellar magnetic fields in  classical t tauri stars	(abridged) aims. we investigate the dynamics and stability of post-shockplasma streaming along nonuniform stellar magnetic fields at the impact regionof accretion columns. we study how the magnetic field configuration andstrength determine the structure, geometry, and location of the shock-heatedplasma. methods. we model the impact of an accretion stream onto thechromosphere of a ctts by 2d axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations. ourmodel takes into account the gravity, the radiative cooling, and themagnetic-field-oriented thermal conduction. results. the structure, stability,and location of the shocked plasma strongly depend on the configuration andstrength of the magnetic field. for weak magnetic fields, a large component ofb may develop perpendicular to the stream at the base of the accretion column,limiting the sinking of the shocked plasma into the chromosphere. an envelopeof dense and cold chromospheric material may also develop around the shockedcolumn. for strong magnetic fields, the field configuration determines theposition of the shock and its stand-off height. if the field is stronglytapered close to the chromosphere, an oblique shock may form well above thestellar surface. in general, a nonuniform magnetic field makes the distributionof emission measure vs. temperature of the shocked plasma lower than in thecase of uniform magnetic field. conclusions. the initial strength andconfiguration of the magnetic field in the impact region of the stream areexpected to influence the chromospheric absorption and, therefore, theobservability of the shock-heated plasma in the x-ray band. the field strengthand configuration influence also the energy balance of the shocked plasma, itsemission measure at t &gt; 1 mk being lower than expected for a uniform field. theabove effects contribute in underestimating the mass accretion rates derived inthe x-ray band.

1401.0408	mass accretion processes in young stellar objects: role of intense  flaring activity	according to the magnetospheric accretion scenario, young low-mass stars aresurrounded by circumstellar disks which they interact with through accretion ofmass. the accretion builds up the star to its final mass and is also believedto power the mass outflows, which may in turn have a significant role inremoving the excess angular momentum from the star-disk system. although theprocess of mass accretion is a critical aspect of star formation, some of itsmechanisms are still to be fully understood. on the other hand, strong flaringactivity is a common feature of young stellar objects (ysos). in the sun, suchevents give rise to perturbations of the interplanetary medium. similar butmore energetic phenomena occur in ysos and may influence the circumstellarenvironment. in fact, a recent study has shown that an intense flaring activityclose to the disk may strongly perturb the stability of circumstellar disks,thus inducing mass accretion episodes (orlando et al. 2011). here we review themain results obtained in the field and the future perspectives.

1402.6554	thermal structure of hot non-flaring corona from hinode/eis	in previous studies a very hot plasma component has been diagnosed in solaractive regions through the images in three different narrow-band channels ofsdo/aia. this diagnostic from euv imaging data has also been supported by thematching morphology of the emission in the hot ca xvii line, as observed withhinode/eis. this evidence is debated because of unknown distribution of theemission measure along the line of sight. here we investigate in detail thethermal distribution of one of such regions using euv spectroscopic data. in anactive region observed with sdo/aia, hinode/eis and xrt, we select a subregionwith a very hot plasma component and another cooler one for comparison. theaverage spectrum is extracted for both, and 14 intense lines are selected foranalysis, that probe the 5.5 &lt; log t &lt; 7 temperature range uniformly. fromthese lines the emission measure distributions are reconstructed with the mcmcmethod. results are cross-checked with comparison of the two subregions, with adifferent inversion method, with the morphology of the images, and with theaddition of fluxes measured with from narrow and broad-band imagers. we findthat, whereas the cool region has a flat and featureless distribution thatdrops at temperature log t &gt;= 6.3, the distribution of the hot region shows awell-defined peak at log t = 6.6 and gradually decreasing trends on both sides,thus supporting the very hot nature of the hot component diagnosed withimagers. the other cross-checks are consistent with this result. this studyprovides a completion of the analysis of active region components, and theresulting scenario supports the presence of a minor very hot plasma componentin the core, with temperatures log t &gt; 6.6.

1405.2198	mhd modeling of coronal loops: injection of high-speed chromospheric  flows	observations reveal a correspondence between chromospheric type ii spiculesand bright upwardly moving fronts in the corona observed in the euv band.however, theoretical considerations suggest that these flows are unlikely to bethe main source of heating in coronal magnetic loops. we investigate thepropagation of high-speed chromospheric flows into coronal magnetic flux tubes,and the possible production of emission in the euv band. we simulate thepropagation of a dense $10^4$ k chromospheric jet upwards along a coronal loop,by means of a 2-d cylindrical mhd model, including gravity, radiative losses,thermal conduction and magnetic induction. the jet propagates in a completeatmosphere including the chromosphere and a tenuous cool ($\sim 0.8$ mk)corona, linked through a steep transition region. in our reference model, thejet's initial speed is 70 km/s, its initial density is $10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$, andthe ambient uniform magnetic field is 10 g. we explore also other values of jetspeed and density in 1-d, and of magnetic field in 2-d, and the jet propagationin a hotter ($\sim 1.5$ mk) background loop. while the initial speed of the jetdoes not allow it to reach the loop apex, a hot shock front develops ahead ofit and travels to the other extreme of the loop. the shock front compresses thecoronal plasma and heats it to about $10^6$ k. as a result, a bright movingfront becomes visible in the 171 \aa\ channel of the sdo/aia mission. thisresult generally applies to all the other explored cases, except for thepropagation in the hotter loop. for a cool, low-density initial coronal loop,the post-shock plasma ahead of upward chromospheric flows might explain atleast part of the observed correspondence between type ii spicules and euvemission excess.

1410.7193	bright hot impacts by erupted fragments falling back on the sun: uv  redshifts in stellar accretion	a solar eruption after a flare on 7 jun 2011 produced euv-bright impacts offallbacks far from the eruption site, observed with the solar dynamicsobservatory. these impacts can be taken as a template for the impact of stellaraccretion flows. broad red-shifted uv lines have been commonly observed inyoung accreting stars. here we study the emission from the impacts in theatmospheric imaging assembly's uv channels and compare the inferred velocitydistribution to stellar observations. we model the impacts with 2d hydrodynamicsimulations. we find that the localised uv 1600a emission and its timing withrespect to the euv emission can be explained by the impact of a cloud offragments. the first impacts produce strong initial upflows. the followingfragments are hit and shocked by these upflows. the uv emission comes mostlyfrom the shocked front shell of the fragments while they are still falling, andis therefore redshifted when observed from above. the euv emission insteadcontinues from the hot surface layer that is fed by the impacts. fragmentedaccretion can therefore explain broad redshifted uv lines (e.g. c iv 1550a) tospeeds around 400 km/s observed in accreting young stellar objects.

0805.2685	the flaring and quiescent components of the solar corona	the solar corona is a template to understand stellar activity. the sun is amoderately active star, and its corona differs from active stars: activestellar coronae have a double-peaked em(t) with the hot peak at 8-20 mk, whilethe non flaring solar corona has one peak at 1-2 mk. we study the averagecontribution of flares to the solar em(t) to investigate indirectly thehypothesis that the hot peak of the em(t) of active stellar coronae is due to alarge number of unresolved solar-like flares, and to infer properties on theflare distribution from nano- to macro-flares. we measure the disk-integratedtime-averaged emission measure, em_f(t), of an unbiased sample of solar flaresanalyzing uninterrupted goes/xrs light curves over time intervals of one month.we obtain the em_q(t) of quiescent corona for the same time intervals from theyohkoh/sxt data. to investigate how em_f(t) and em_q(t) vary with the solarcycle, we evaluate them at different phases of the cycle (from dec. 1991 toapr. 1998). irrespective of the solar cycle phase, em_f(t) appears like a peakof the distribution significantly larger than the values of em_q(t) for t~5-10mk. as a result the time-averaged em(t) of the whole solar corona isdouble-peaked, with the hot peak, due to time-averaged flares, located attemperature similar of that of active stars, but less enhanced. the em_f(t)shape supports the hypothesis that the hot em(t) peak of active coronae is dueto unresolved solar-like flares. if this is the case, quiescent and flarecomponents should follow different scaling laws for increasing stellaractivity. in the assumption that the heating of the corona is entirely due toflares, from nano- to macro-flares, then either the flare distribution or theconfined plasma response to flares, or both, are bimodal.

1510.07524	time-resolved emission from bright hot pixels of an active region  observed in the euv band with sdo/aia and multi-stranded loop modeling	evidence for small amounts of very hot plasma has been found in activeregions and might be the indication of an impulsive heating, released atspatial scales smaller than the cross section of a single loop. we investigatethe heating and substructure of coronal loops in the core of one such activeregion by analyzing the light curves in the smallest resolution elements ofsolar observations in two euv channels (94 a and 335 a) from the atmosphericimaging assembly on-board the solar dynamics observatory. we model theevolution of a bundle of strands heated by a storm of nanoflares by means of ahydrodynamic 0d loop model (ebtel). the light curves obtained from the randomcombination of those of single strands are compared to the observed lightcurves either in a single pixel or in a row of pixels, simultaneously in thetwo channels and using two independent methods: an artificial intelligentsystem (probabilistic neural network, pnn) and a simple cross-correlationtechnique. we explore the space of the parameters to constrain the distributionof the heat pulses, their duration and their spatial size, and, as a feedbackon the data, their signatures on the light curves. from both methods the bestagreement is obtained for a relatively large population of events (1000) with ashort duration (less than 1 min) and a relatively shallow distribution (powerlaw with index 1.5) in a limited energy range (1.5 decades). the feedback onthe data indicates that bumps in the light curves, especially in the 94 achannel, are signatures of a heating excess that occurred a few minutes before.

0705.3254	diagnostics of stellar flares from x-ray observations: from the decay to  the rise phase	the diagnostics of stellar flaring coronal loops have been so far largelybased on the analysis of the decay phase. we derive new diagnostics from theanalysis of the rise and peak phase of stellar flares. we release theassumption of full equilibrium of the flaring loop at the flare peak, accordingto the frequently observed delay between the temperature and the densitymaximum. from scaling laws and hydrodynamic simulations we derive diagnosticformulas as a function of observable quantities and times. we obtain adiagnostic toolset related to the rise phase, including the loop length,density and aspect ratio. we discuss the limitations of this approach and findthat the assumption of loop equilibrium in the analysis of the decay leads to amoderate overestimate of the loop length. a few relevant applications topreviously analyzed stellar flares are shown. the analysis of the flare riseand peak phase complements and completes the analysis of the decay phase.

astro-ph;0104021	the sun as an x-ray star: iii. flares	in previous works we have developed a method to convert solar x-ray data,collected with the yohkoh/sxt, into templates of stellar coronal observations.here we apply the method to several solar flares, for comparison with stellarx-ray flares. eight flares, from weak (goes class c5.8) to very intense ones(x9) are selected as representative of the flaring sun. the emission measuredistribution vs. temperature, em(t), of the flaring regions is derived fromyohkoh/sxt observations in the rise, peak and decay of the flares. the em(t) israther peaked and centered around $t \approx 10^7$ k for most of the time.typically, it grows during the rise phase of the flare, and then it decreasesand shifts toward lower temperatures during the decay, more slowly if there issustained heating. the most intense flare we studied shows emission measureeven at very high temperature ($t \approx 10^8$ k). time-resolved x-ray spectraboth unfiltered and filtered through the instrumental responses of thenon-solar instruments asca/sis and rosat/pspc are then derived. synthesizedasca/sis and rosat/pspc spectra are generally well fitted with single thermalcomponents at temperatures close to that of the em(t) maximum, albeit twothermal components are needed to fit some flare decays. rosat/pspc spectra showthat solar flares are in a two-orders of magnitude flux range ($10^6 - 10^8$erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) and a narrow pspc hardness ratio range, however higherthan that of typical non-flaring solar-like stars.

astro-ph;0104318	coronal structure geometries on pre-main sequence stars	we have re-analyzed using a hydrodynamic model large flaring events on threedifferent categories of pre-main sequence (pms) stars: the young stellar object(yso) ylw 15, the classical t tauri star (ctts) lkhalpha92, the weak-line ttauri star (wtts) v773 tau, and the wtts hd 283572 (the first three objectswere observed by asca, the last by rosat; all have been previously reported inthe literature). the first three flares were previously analyzed on the basisof the quasi-static model mostly used up to now, consistently yielding largeloops (l &gt;= r*) and no evidence of sustained heating. our hydrodynamic modelingapproach, however, shows that the size of the flaring regions must be muchsmaller (l &lt;=r*) and moreover this method shows in all cases evidence ofvigorous sustained heating during the flare decay, so that the decay of theobserved light curve actually reflects the temporal profile of the heatingrather than that of the free decay of the heated loop(s). the events on theprotostar ylw 15 have durations comparable to the stellar rotation period, sothat their limited size and their lack of self-eclipses give evidence of apolar location on the star. this is in contrast with the recently advancedhypothesis that these flares are due to long loops spanning the region betweenthe star and the accretion disk. in general, the present analysis shows thatflaring coronae on pms stars have a structure similar to the coronae on olderactive stars.

astro-ph;0112333	modeling non-confined coronal flares: dynamics and x-ray diagnostics	long-lasting, intense, stellar x-ray flares may approach conditions ofbreaking magnetic confinement and evolving in open space. we explore thishypothesis with hydrodynamic simulations of flares occurring in a non-confinedcorona: model flares are triggered by a transient impulsive heating injected ina plane-parallel stratified corona. the plasma evolution is described by meansof a numerical 2-d model in cylindrical geometry r,z. we explore the space offundamental parameters. as a reference model, we consider a flare triggered bya heating pulse that would cause a 20 mk flare if delivered in a 40000 km longclosed loop. the modeled plasma evolution is described. the x-ray emission,spectra and light curves at the asca/sis focal plan, and in two intense x-raylines (mg xi at 9.169 a and fe xxi at 128.752 a), have been synthesized fromthe models. the results are discussed and compared to features of confinedevents, and scaling laws are derived. the light curves invariably show a veryrapid rise, a constant phase as long as the constant heating is on, and then avery fast decay, on time scales of few seconds, followed by a more gradual one(few minutes). we show that this evolution of the emission, and especially thefast decay, together with other potentially observable effects, are intrinsicto the assumption of non-confinement. their lack indicates that observedlong-lasting stellar x-ray flares should involve plasma strongly confined bymagnetic fields.

astro-ph;0207550	more on the determination of the coronal heating function from yohkoh  data	two recent works have analyzed a solar large and steady coronal loop observedwith yohkoh/sxt in two filter passbands to infer the distribution of theheating along it. priest et al. (2000) modelled the distribution of thetemperature obtained from filter ratio method with an analytical approach, andconcluded that the heating was uniform along the loop. aschwanden (2001) foundthat a uniform heating led to an unreasonably large plasma column depth alongthe line of sight, and, using a two component loop model, that afootpoint-heated model loop (with a minor cool component) yields moreacceptable physical solutions. we revisit the analysis of the same loop system,considering conventional hydrostatic single loop models with uniformlydistributed heating, and with heating localized at the footpoints and at theapex, and an unstructured background contribution extrapolated from the regionbelow the analyzed loop. the flux profiles synthesized from the loop modelshave been compared in detail with those observed in both filter passbands withand without background subtraction; we find that background-subtracted data arefitted with acceptable statistical significance by a model of relatively hotloop (~3.7 mk) heated at the apex, with a column depth ~1/10 of the looplength. in discussing our results, we put warnings on the importance of aspectsof data analysis and modeling, such as considering diffuse background emissionin complex loop regions.

astro-ph;0310355	a large x-ray flare from the herbig ae star v892 tau	we report the xmm-newton observation of a large x-ray flare from the herbigae star v892 tau. the apparent low mass companion of v892 tau, v892 tau ne, isunresolved by xmm-newton. nevertheless there is compelling evidence fromcombined xmm-newton and chandra data that the origin of the flare is the herbigae star v892 tau. during the flare the x-ray luminosity of v892 tau increasesby a factor of ~15, while the temperature of the plasma increases from kt ~ 1.5kev to kt ~ 8 kev. from the scaling of the flare event, based on hydrodynamicmodeling, we conclude that a 500 g magnetic field is needed in order to confinethe plasma. under the assumptions that a dynamo mechanism is required togenerate such a confining magnetic field and that surface convection is anecessary ingredient for a dynamo, our findings provide indirect evidence forthe existence of a significant convection zone in the stellar envelope ofherbig ae stars.

astro-ph;0312297	flares from small to large: x-ray spectroscopy of proxima centauri with  xmm-newton	(abridged) we report results from a comprehensive study of the nearby m dwarfproxima centauri with the xmm-newton satellite. we find strongly variablecoronal x-ray emission, with flares ranging over a factor of 100 in peak flux.the low-level emission is found to be continuously variable. several weakflares are characteristically preceded by an optical burst, compatible withpredictions from standard solar flare models. we propose that the u band burstsare proxies for the elusive stellar non-thermal hard x-ray bursts suggestedfrom solar observations. a very large x-ray flare was observed in its entirety,with a peak luminosity of 3.9e28 erg/s [0.15-10 kev] and a total x-ray energyof 1.5e32 erg. this flare has allowed to measure significant density variationsfrom x-ray spectroscopy of the ovii he-like triplet; we find peak densitiesreaching up to 4e11 cm^-3 for plasma of about 1-5 mk. abundance ratios showlittle variability in time, with a tendency of elements with a high firstionization potential to be overabundant relative to solar photospheric values.we do not find significant effects due to opacity during the flare, indicatingthat large opacity increases are not the rule even in extreme flares. we modelthe large flare in terms of an analytic 2-ribbon flare model and find that theflaring loop system should have large characteristic sizes (~1r*). theseresults are supported by full hydrodynamic simulations. comparing the largeflare to flares of similar size occurring much more frequently on more activestars, we propose that the x-ray properties of active stars are a consequenceof superimposed flares such as the example analyzed in this paper. such a modelalso explains why, during episodes of low-level emission, more active starsshow hotter plasma than less active stars.

astro-ph;0405281	are coronae of late type stars made of solar-like structures? the fx-hr  diagram and the pressure-temperature correlation	we show that stellar coronae can be composed of x-ray emitting structureslike those in the solar corona, using a large set of rosat/pspc observations oflate-type-stars, and a large set of solar x-ray data collected with yohkoh/sxt.we have considered data on the solar corona at various phases of the cycle andvarious kinds of x-ray coronal structures, from flares to the backgroundcorona. the surface flux (f_x) vs. spectral hardness ratio (hr) diagram is afundamental tool for our study. we find that $f_x$ is strongly correlated to hrin stellar coronae, in the solar corona at all phases of the cycle, and in theindividual solar coronal structures; all follow the same law. we thereforeclaim that coronae of late type stars are formed with x-ray structures verysimilar to the solar ones. in this scenario, the fraction of the stellarsurface covered with active regions and with their bright cores increases withactivity; the most active stars are brighter and hotter than if they wereentirely covered with active regions so they can be explained only with theadditional presence of several flares (or flare-like structures) at any time.using the f_x vs. hr correlation (f_x ~ t^6) we derive new laws relating thetemperature, pressure, volumetric heating and characteristic loop length of thecoronal plasma, on all the late type stars individual solar coronal structuresand the whole solar corona, follow the same laws. we claim that the strongcorrelation between surface flux and temperature and the laws mentioned aboveare just the effect of more fundamental physical mechanisms driving the coronalstructures of all the late-type stars from the emergence of new magneticstructures to their dissipation.

astro-ph;0608063	shock-cloud interaction in the vela snr ii. hydrodynamic model	in the framework of the study of the x-ray and optical emission in supernovaremnants we focus on an isolated x-ray knot in the northern rim of the vela snr(vela fild), whose x-ray emission has been studied and discussed in paper i. weaim at understanding the physical origin of the x-ray and optical emission infild, at understanding the role of the different physical processes at work,and at obtaining a key for the interpretation of future x-ray observations ofsnrs. to this end we have pursued an accurate ``forward'' modeling of theinteraction of the vela snr shock with an ism cloud. we perform hydrodynamicsimulations and we directly compare the observables synthesized from thesimulations with the data. we explore four different model setups, choosing thevalues of the physical parameters on the basis of our preliminary analysis ofthe x-ray data. we synthesize x-ray emission maps and spectra filtered throughthe xmm-newton epic-mos instrumental response. the impact of a shock front at 6million kelvin on an elliptical cloud 30 times denser than the ambient mediumdescribes well the shock-cloud interaction processes in the vela fild region interms of spectral properties and morphology of the x-ray and optical emission.the bulk of the x-ray emission in the fild knot originates in the cloudmaterial heated by the transmitted shock front, but significant x-ray emissionis also associated to the cloud material, which evaporates, as an effect ofthermal conduction, in the intercloud medium. the physical origin of the fildoptical emission is associated to thermal instabilities. in the fild knot thex-ray emission associated to the reflected shock front is negligible.

astro-ph;9909491	an extreme x-ray flare observed on ev lac by asca in july 1998	we present a long (150 ks elapsed time) asca x-ray observation of the dm3.5estar ev lac, during which an exceptionally intense flaring event (lastingapproximately 12 ks) was observed: at the flare's peak, the x-ray count rate inthe asca gis detectors was approx. 300 times the quiescent value. the physicalparameters of the flaring region have been derived by analyzing the decay,using both a quasi-static approach and an approach based on hydrodynamicsimulations of decaying flaring loops. this second method shows that theflare's decay is compatible with its being produced in a relatively compactregion of semi-length l approx. 0.5 stellar radii), large but not exceptionaleven by solar standards. the flare decays is fast (with a e-folding time forthe light curve of &lt;= 2 ks), but nevertheless the hydrodynamic-based analysisshows strong evidence for sustained heating, with the shape of the light curvedominated by the time evolution of the heating rather than by the naturalcooling of the flaring plasma. the quasi-static method yields a much largerestimate of the loop's length (l approx. 2 stellar radii). the event shows alight curve characterized by two separate decay time constants (with theinitial decay being faster) and a significant enhancement in the plasma metalabundance at the peak of the flare. the energetics of the event areexceptional, with the peak x-ray luminosity of the event reaching up to approx.25% of the bolometric luminosity of the star, making this one of the largestx-ray flare (in relative terms) observed to date on a main-sequence star.

astro-ph;9912462	the corona of the dme flare star ad leo	we have studied the x-ray emission (both the quiescent component and theflares) of the dm3e star ad leo, analyzing the einstein ipc, rosat pspc andasca sis observations. using a consistent method which explicitly considerssustained heating we have analyzed six flares with sufficient statistics,deriving constraints on the physical parameters of the flaring regions. in allcases the flaring loops are likely compact (l approx 0.3 r*), and confined to arather narrow range of sizes, incompatible with the large (l &gt;= r*) tenuousloops claimed by previous analyses of flares on ad leo and other similar stars.the flaring loops appear to have a larger cross section (beta = r/l approx.0.3) than customarily assumed (e.g. beta 0.1). all flares show evidence ofsignificant heating during the decay phase. although the derived peak pressuresare high (up to p approx. 10^4 dyne/cm^2) with a peak temperature of approx. 50mk, the magnetic fields required to confine such loops and to produce theobserved flare luminosity are relatively modest (b approx. 1 to 2 kg) and fullycompatible with the photospheric magnetic fields measured in several flarestars. if the narrow range of loop sizes obtained is extrapolated to thequiescent structures responsible for the active corona, the latter can benaturally scaled up from the solar case through a modest (a factor of 10)increase in pressure in otherwise solar-like active structures with a smallsurface filling factor (approx 5%). the quiescent component of the corona showsno evidence for abundance peculiarities with respect to the photosphere, andthe quiescent coronal luminosity is remarkably constant (with variations ofless than a factor of 2) across the almost 20 yr span of the observationsdiscussed here.

0810.0192	x-ray emission from dense plasma in cttss: hydrodynamic modeling of the  accretion shock	high spectral resolution x-ray observations of cttss demonstrate the presenceof plasma at t~2-3x10^6 k and n_e~10^11-10^13 cm^-3, unobserved innon-accreting stars. stationary models suggest that this emission is due toshock-heated accreting material, but they do not allow to analyze the stabilityof such material and its position in the stellar atmosphere. we investigate thedynamics and the stability of shock-heated accreting material in cttss and therole of the stellar chromosphere in determining the position and the thicknessof the shocked region. we perform 1-d hd simulations of the impact of theaccretion flow onto chromosphere of a ctts, including the effects of gravity,radiative losses from optically thin plasma, thermal conduction and a welltested detailed model of the stellar chromosphere. here we present the resultsof a simulation based on the parameters of the ctts mp mus. we find that theaccretion shock generates an hot slab of material above the chromosphere with amaximum thickness of 1.8x10^9 cm, density n_e~10^11-10^2 cm^-3, temperaturet~3x10^6 k and uniform pressure equal to the ram pressure of the accretion flow(~450 dyn cm^-2). the base of the shocked region penetrates the chromosphereand stays where the ram pressure is equal to the thermal pressure. the systemevolves with quasi-periodic instabilities of the material in the slab leadingto cyclic disappearance and re-formation of the slab. for an accretion rate of~10^-10 m_sun yr^-1, the shocked region emits a time-averaged x-ray luminosityl_x~7x10^29 erg s^-1, which is comparable to the x-ray luminosity observed incttss of the same mass. furthermore, the x-ray spectrum synthesized from thesimulation matches in detail all the main features of the o viii and o viilines of the star mp mus.
