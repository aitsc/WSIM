0901.3553	the impact of inhomogeneous reionization on the satellite galaxy  population of the milky way	we use the publicly available subhalo catalogs from the via lactea simulationalong with a gpc-scale n-body simulation to understand the impact ofinhomogeneous reionization on the satellite galaxy population of the milky way.the large-volume simulation is combined with a model for reionization thatallows us to predict the distribution of reionization times for milky way masshalos. motivated by this distribution, we identify candidate satellite galaxiesin the simulation by requiring that any subhalo must grow above a specifiedmass threshold before it is reionized; after this time the photoionizingbackground will suppress both the formation of stars and the accretion of gas.we show that varying the reionization time over the range expected for milkyway mass halos can change the number of satellite galaxies by roughly twoorders of magnitude. this conclusion is in contradiction with a number ofstudies in the literature, and we conclude that this is a result ofinconsistent application of the results of gnedin (2000). we compare oursatellite galaxies to observations using both abundance matching and stellarpopulation synthesis methods to assign luminosities to our subhalos and accountfor observational completeness effects. additionally, if we assume that themass threshold is set by the virial temperature tvir = 8e3k we find that ourmodel accurately matches the vmax distribution, radial distribution, andluminosity function of observed milky way satellites for a reionization timezreion = 9.6^{1.0}_{-2.1}, assuming that the via lacteasubhalo distribution isrepresentative of the milky way. this results in the presence of119^{+202}_{-50} satellite galaxies.

0901.4336	gas-rich mergers in lcdm: disk survivability and the baryonic assembly  of galaxies	we use n-body simulations and observationally-normalized relations betweendark matter halo mass, stellar mass, and cold gas mass to derive robust,arguably inevitable expectations about the baryonic content of major mergersout to redshift z~2. first, we find that the majority of major mergers (m/m &gt;0.3) experienced by milky way size dark matter halos should have been gas-rich,and that gas-rich mergers are increasingly common at high redshift. though thefrequency of major mergers into galaxy halos in our simulations greatly exceedsthe observed late-type galaxy fraction, the frequency of gas-poor major mergersis consistent with the observed fraction of spheroid-dominated galaxies acrossthe halo mass range m_dm ~ 10^11-10^13 msun. these results lend support to theconjecture that mergers with high baryonic gas fractions play an important rolein building and/or preserving disk galaxies in the universe. also, we find thatthe overall fraction of a galaxy's cold baryons deposited directly via majormergers is substantial. approximately ~30% of the cold baryonic material inm_star ~ 10^10 msun$ (m_dm ~ 10^11.5 msun) galaxies is accreted as cold gas inmajor mergers. for more massive galaxies with m_star ~ 10^11 msun (m_dm ~ 10^13msun) the fraction of baryons amassed in mergers is even higher, ~50%, but mostof these accreted baryons are delivered directly in the form of stars. thisbaryonic mass deposition is almost unavoidable, and provides a limit on thefraction of a galaxy's cold baryons that can originate in cold flows or fromhot halo cooling.

0902.1748	interpreting the clustering of distant red galaxies	we analyze the angular clustering of z~2.3 distant red galaxies (drgs)measured by quadri et al 2008. we find that, with robust estimates of themeasurement errors and realistic halo occupation distribution modeling, themeasured clustering can be well fit within standard halo occupation models, incontrast to previous results. however, in order to fit the strong break inw(theta) at theta=10 arcsec, nearly all satellite galaxies in the drgluminosity range are required to be drgs. within this luminosity-thresholdsample, the fraction of galaxies that are drgs is ~44%, implying that theformation of drgs is more efficient for satellite galaxies than for centralgalaxies. despite the evolved stellar populations contained within drgs atz=2.3, 90% of satellite galaxies in the drg luminosity range have been accretedwithin 500 myr. thus, satellite drgs must have known they would becomesatellites well before the time of their accretion. this implies that theformation of drgs correlates with large-scale environment at fixed halo mass,although the large-scale bias of drgs can be well fit without such assumptions.further data are required to resolve this issue. using the observationalestimate that ~30% of drgs have no ongoing star formation, we infer a timescalefor star formation quenching for satellite galaxies of 450 myr, although theuncertainty on this number is large. however, unless all non-star formingsatellite drgs were quenched before accretion, the quenching timescale issignificantly shorter than z~0 estimates. down to the completeness limit of thequadri et al sample, we find that the halo masses of central drgs are ~50%higher than non-drgs in the same luminosity range, but at the highest halomasses the central galaxies are drgs only ~2/3 of the time.

0902.3702	cosmological constraints from the sdss maxbcg cluster catalog	we use the abundance and weak lensing mass measurements of the sdss maxbcgcluster catalog to simultaneously constrain cosmology and the richness--massrelation of the clusters. assuming a flat \lambdacdm cosmology, we find\sigma_8(\omega_m/0.25)^{0.41} = 0.832\pm 0.033 after marginalization over allsystematics. in common with previous studies, our error budget is dominated bysystematic uncertainties, the primary two being the absolute mass scale of theweak lensing masses of the maxbcg clusters, and uncertainty in the scatter ofthe richness--mass relation. our constraints are fully consistent with the wmapfive-year data, and in a joint analysis we find \sigma_8=0.807\pm 0.020 and\omega_m=0.265\pm 0.016, an improvement of nearly a factor of two relative towmap5 alone. our results are also in excellent agreement with and comparable inprecision to the latest cosmological constraints from x-ray cluster abundances.the remarkable consistency among these results demonstrates that clusterabundance constraints are not only tight but also robust, and highlight thepower of optically-selected cluster samples to produce precision constraints oncosmological parameters.

0907.2690	annealing a follow-up program: improvement of the dark energy figure of  merit for optical galaxy cluster surveys	the precision of cosmological parameters derived from galaxy cluster surveysis limited by uncertainty in relating observable signals to cluster mass. wedemonstrate that a small mass-calibration follow-up program can significantlyreduce this uncertainty and improve parameter constraints, particularly whenthe follow-up targets are judiciously chosen. to this end, we apply a simulatedannealing algorithm to maximize the dark energy information at fixedobservational cost, and find that optimal follow-up strategies can reduce theobservational cost required to achieve a specified precision by up to an orderof magnitude. considering clusters selected from optical imaging in the darkenergy survey, we find that approximately 200 low-redshift x-ray clusters ormassive sunyaev-zel'dovich clusters can improve the dark energy figure of meritby 50%, provided that the follow-up mass measurements involve no systematicerror. in practice, the actual improvement depends on (1) the uncertainty inthe systematic error in follow-up mass measurements, which needs to becontrolled at the 5% level to avoid severe degradation of the results; and (2)the scatter in the optical richness-mass distribution, which needs to be madeas tight as possible to improve the efficacy of follow-up observations.

0907.4383	precision measurements of the cluster red sequence using an error  corrected gaussian mixture model	the red sequence is an important feature of galaxy clusters and plays acrucial role in optical cluster detection. measurement of the slope and scatterof the red sequence are affected both by selection of red sequence galaxies andmeasurement errors. in this paper, we describe a new error corrected gaussianmixture model for red sequence galaxy identification. using this technique, wecan remove the effects of measurement error and extract unbiased informationabout the intrinsic properties of the red sequence. we use this method toselect red sequence galaxies in each of the 13,823 clusters in the maxbcgcatalog, and measure the red sequence ridgeline location and scatter of each.these measurements provide precise constraints on the variation of the averagered galaxy populations in the observed frame with redshift. we find that thescatter of the red sequence ridgeline increases mildly with redshift, and thatthe slope decreases with redshift. we also observe that the slope does notstrongly depend on cluster richness. using similar methods, we show that thisbehavior is mirrored in a spectroscopic sample of field galaxies, furtheremphasizing that ridgeline properties are independent of environment.

0910.3668	the impact of theoretical uncertainties in the halo mass function and  halo bias on precision cosmology	we study the impact of theoretical uncertainty in the dark matter halo massfunction and halo bias on dark energy constraints from imminent galaxy clustersurveys. we find that for an optical cluster survey like the dark energysurvey, the accuracy required on the predicted halo mass function to make it aninsignificant source of error on dark energy parameters is ~ 1%. the analogousrequirement on the predicted halo bias is less stringent (~ 5%), particularlyif the observable-mass distribution can be well constrained by other means.these requirements depend upon survey area but are relatively insensitive tosurvey depth. the most stringent requirements are likely to come from a surveyover a significant fraction of the sky that aims to observe clusters down torelatively low mass, mth ~ 10^13.7 msun/h; for such a survey, the mass functionand halo bias must be predicted to accuracies of ~ 0.5% and ~ 1%, respectively.these accuracies represent a limit on the practical need to calibrate ever moreaccurate halo mass and bias functions. we find that improving predictions forthe mass function in the low-redshift and low-mass regimes is the mosteffective way to improve dark energy constraints.

1001.0015	a comprehensive analysis of uncertainties affecting the stellar mass -  halo mass relation for 0&lt;z&lt;4	we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between centralgalaxies and their host dark matter halos, as characterized by the stellarmass-halo mass (sm-hm) relation, with rigorous consideration of uncertainties.our analysis focuses on results from the abundance matching technique, whichassumes that every dark matter halo or subhalo above a specific mass thresholdhosts one galaxy. we discuss the quantitative effects of uncertainties inobserved galaxy stellar mass functions (gsmfs) (including stellar massestimates and counting uncertainties), halo mass functions (including cosmologyand uncertainties from substructure), and the abundance matching technique usedto link galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). our analysisresults in a robust estimate of the sm-hm relation and its evolution from z=0to z=4. the shape and evolution are well constrained for z &lt; 1. the largestuncertainties at these redshifts are due to stellar mass estimates; however,failure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can lead toerrors of similar magnitude in the sm-hm relation for central galaxies inmassive halos. we also investigate the sm-hm relation to z=4, although theshape of the relation at higher redshifts remains fairly unconstrained whenuncertainties are taken into account. these results will provide a powerfultool to inform galaxy evolution models.

0708.0004	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: color and luminosity dependence of  galaxy clustering at z~1	we present measurements of the color and luminosity dependence of galaxyclustering at z~1 in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey. using volume-limitedsubsamples in bins of both color and luminosity, we find that: 1) theclustering dependence is much stronger with color than with luminosity and isas strong with color at z~1 as is found locally. we find no dependence of theclustering amplitude on color for galaxies on the red sequence, but asignificant dependence on color for galaxies within the blue cloud. 2) forgalaxies in the range l/l*~0.7-2, a stronger large-scale luminosity dependenceis seen for all galaxies than for red and blue galaxies separately. thesmall-scale clustering amplitude depends significantly on luminosity for bluegalaxies, with brighter samples having a stronger rise on scales r_p&lt;0.5 mpc/h.3) redder galaxies exhibit stronger small-scale redshift-space distortions("fingers of god"), and both red and blue populations show large-scaledistortions in xi(r_p,pi) due to coherent infall. 4) while the clusteringlength, r_0, increases smoothly with galaxy color (in narrow bins), itspower-law exponent, gamma, exhibits a sharp jump from the blue cloud to the redsequence. the intermediate color `green' galaxy population likely includestransitional galaxies moving from the blue cloud to the red sequence; on largescales green galaxies are as clustered as red galaxies but show infallkinematics and a small-scale correlation slope akin to the blue galaxypopulation. 5) we compare our results to a semi-analytic galaxy formation modelapplied to the millenium run simulation. differences between the data and themodel suggest that in the model star formation is shut down too efficiently insatellite galaxies.

0708.2912	isolating triggered star formation	galaxy pairs provide a potentially powerful means of studying triggered starformation from galaxy interactions. we use a large cosmological n-bodysimulation coupled with a well-tested semi-analytic substructure model todemonstrate that the majority of galaxies in close pairs reside within clusteror group-size halos and therefore represent a biased population, poorly suitedfor direct comparison to ``field'' galaxies. thus, the frequent observationthat some types of galaxies in pairs have redder colors than ``field'' galaxiesis primarily a selection effect. we select galaxy pairs that are isolated intheir dark matter halos with respect to other massive subhalos (n=2 halos) anda control sample of isolated galaxies (n=1 halos) for comparison. we then applythese selection criteria to a volume-limited subset of the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey with m_bj &lt;= -19 and obtain the first clean measure of the typicalfraction of galaxies affected by triggered star formation and the averageelevation in the star formation rate. we find that 24% (30.5%) of these l^\starand sub-l^{\star} galaxies in isolated 50 (30) kpc/h pairs exhibit starformation that is boosted by a factor of &gt;~ 5 above their average past value,while only 10% of isolated galaxies in the control sample show this level ofenhancement. thus, 14% (20 %) of the galaxies in these close pairs show cleartriggered star formation. the isolation criteria we develop provide a means toconstrain star formation and feedback prescriptions in hydrodynamic simulationsand a very general method of understanding the importance of triggered starformation in a cosmological context.

1010.5518	counts-in-cylinders in the sloan digital sky survey with comparisons to  n-body simulations	environmental statistics provide a necessary means of comparing theproperties of galaxies in different environments and a vital test of models ofgalaxy formation within the prevailing, hierarchical cosmological model. weexplore counts-in-cylinders, a common statistic defined as the number ofcompanions of a particular galaxy found within a given projected radius andredshift interval. galaxy distributions with the same two-point correlationfunctions do not necessarily have the same companion count distributions. weuse this statistic to examine the environments of galaxies in the sloan digitalsky survey, data release 4. we also make preliminary comparisons to four modelsfor the spatial distributions of galaxies, based on n-body simulations, anddata from sdss dr4 to study the utility of the counts-in-cylinders statistic.there is a very large scatter between the number of companions a galaxy has andthe mass of its parent dark matter halo and the halo occupation, limiting theutility of this statistic for certain kinds of environmental studies. we alsoshow that prevalent, empirical models of galaxy clustering that match observedtwo- and three-point clustering statistics well fail to reproduce some aspectsof the observed distribution of counts-in-cylinders on 1, 3 and 6-mpc/h scales.all models that we explore underpredict the fraction of galaxies with few or nocompanions in 3 and 6-mpc/h cylinders. roughly 7% of galaxies in the realuniverse are significantly more isolated within a 6 mpc/h cylinder than thegalaxies in any of the models we use. simple, phenomenological models that mapgalaxies to dark matter halos fail to reproduce high-order clusteringstatistics in low-density environments.

1011.2203	the mass distribution and assembly of the milky way from the properties  of the magellanic clouds	we present a new measurement of the mass of the milky way (mw) based onobserved properties of its largest satellite galaxies, the magellanic clouds(mcs), and an assumed prior of a {\lambda}cdm universe. the large,high-resolution bolshoi cosmological simulation of this universe provides ameans to statistically sample the dynamical properties of bright satellitegalaxies in a large population of dark matter halos. the observed properties ofthe mcs, including their circular velocity, distance from the center of the mw,and velocity within the mw halo, are used to evaluate the likelihood that agiven halo would have each or all of these properties; the posterior pdf forany property of the mw system can thus be constructed. this method provides aconstraint on the mw virial mass, 1.2 +0.7 -0.3(stat.) +0.3 -0.4 (sys.) x 10^12m\odot (68% confidence), which is consistent with recent determinations thatinvolve very different assumptions. in addition, we calculate the posterior pdffor the density profile of the mw and its satellite accretion history. althoughtypical satellites of 10^12 m\odot halos are accreted over a wide range ofepochs over the last 10 gyr, we find a \sim72% probability that the magellanicclouds were accreted within the last gyr, and a 50% probability that they wereaccreted together.

1011.2255	how common are the magellanic clouds?	we introduce a probabilistic approach to the problem of counting dwarfsatellites around host galaxies in databases with limited redshift information.this technique is used to investigate the occurrence of satellites withluminosities similar to the magellanic clouds around hosts with propertiessimilar to the milky way in the object catalog of the sloan digital sky survey.our analysis uses data from sdss data release 7, selecting candidatemilky-way-like hosts from the spectroscopic catalog and candidate analogs ofthe magellanic clouds from the photometric catalog. our principal result is theprobability for a milky-way-like galaxy to host n_{sat} close satellites withluminosities similar to the magellanic clouds. we find that 81 percent ofgalaxies like the milky way are have no such satellites within a radius of 150kpc, 11 percent have one, and only 3.5 percent of hosts have two. theprobabilities are robust to changes in host and satellite selection criteria,background-estimation technique, and survey depth. these results demonstratethat the milky way has significantly more satellites than a typical galaxy ofits luminosity; this fact is useful for understanding the larger cosmologicalcontext of our home galaxy.

1011.3458	the voronoi tessellation cluster finder in 2+1 dimensions	we present a detailed description of the voronoi tessellation (vt) clusterfinder algorithm in 2+1 dimensions, which improves on past implementations ofthis technique. the need for cluster finder algorithms able to produce reliablecluster catalogs up to redshift 1 or beyond and down to $10^{13.5}$ solarmasses is paramount especially in light of upcoming surveys aiming atcosmological constraints from galaxy cluster number counts. we build the vt inphotometric redshift shells and use the two-point correlation function of thegalaxies in the field to both determine the density threshold for detection ofcluster candidates and to establish their significance. this allows us todetect clusters in a self consistent way without any assumptions about theirastrophysical properties. we apply the vt to mock catalogs which extend toredshift 1.4 reproducing the $\lambda$cdm cosmology and the clusteringproperties observed in the sdss data. an objective estimate of the clusterselection function in terms of the completeness and purity as a function ofmass and redshift is as important as having a reliable cluster finder. wemeasure these quantities by matching the vt cluster catalog with the mock truthtable. we show that the vt can produce a cluster catalog with completeness andpurity $&gt;80%$ for the redshift range up to $\sim 1$ and mass range down to$\sim 10^{13.5}$ solar masses.

1011.6373	statistics of satellite galaxies around milky way-like hosts	we calculate the probability that a milky-way-like halo in the standardcosmological model has the observed number of magellanic clouds (mcs). thestatistics of the number of mcs in the lcdm model are in good agreement withobservations of a large sample of sdss galaxies. under the sub-halo abundancematching assumption of a relationship with small scatter between galaxy r-bandluminosities and halo internal velocities v_max, we make detailed comparisonsto similar measurements using sdss dr7 data by liu et al. (2010). models andobservational data give very similar probabilities for having zero, one, andtwo mc-like satellites. in both cases, milky way-luminosity hosts have just a\sim 10% chance of hosting two satellites similar to the magellanic clouds. inaddition, we present a prediction for the probability for a host galaxy to havensats satellite galaxies as a function of the magnitudes of both the host andsatellite. this probability and its scaling with host properties issignificantly different from that of mass-selected objects because of scatterin the mass- luminosity relation and because of variations in the starformation efficiency with halo mass.

0709.0759	optical cluster-finding with an adaptive matched-filter technique:  algorithm and comparison with simulations	we present a modified adaptive matched filter algorithm designed to identifyclusters of galaxies in wide-field imaging surveys such as the sloan digitalsky survey. the cluster-finding technique is fully adaptive to imaging surveyswith spectroscopic coverage, multicolor photometric redshifts, no redshiftinformation at all, and any combination of these within one survey. it workswith high efficiency in multi-band imaging surveys where photometric redshiftscan be estimated with well-understood error distributions. tests of thealgorithm on realistic mock sdss catalogs suggest that the detected sample is~85% complete and over 90% pure for clusters with masses above 1.0*10^{14}h^{-1} m_solar and redshifts up to z=0.45. the errors of estimated clusterredshifts from maximum likelihood method are shown to be small (typically lessthat 0.01) over the whole redshift range with photometric redshift errorstypical of those found in the sloan survey. inside the spherical radiuscorresponding to a galaxy overdensity of delta=200, we find the derived clusterrichness lambda_{200} a roughly linear indicator of its virial mass m_{200},which well recovers the relation between total luminosity and cluster mass ofthe input simulation.

0709.1153	cross-correlation weak lensing of sdss galaxy clusters i: measurements	this is the first in a series of papers on the weak lensing effect caused byclusters of galaxies in sloan digital sky survey. the photometrically selectedcluster sample, known as maxbcg, includes ~130,000 objects between redshift 0.1and 0.3, ranging in size from small groups to massive clusters. we split theclusters into bins of richness and luminosity and stack the surface densitycontrast to produce mean radial profiles. the mean profiles are detected over arange of scales, from the inner halo (25 kpc/h) well into the surrounding largescale structure (30 mpc/h), with a significance of 15 to 20 in each bin. thesignal over this large range of scales is best interpreted in terms of thecluster-mass cross-correlation function. we pay careful attention to sources ofsystematic error, correcting for them where possible. the resulting signals arecalibrated to the ~10% level, with the dominant remaining uncertainty being theredshift distribution of the background sources. we find that the profilesscale strongly with richness and luminosity. we find the signal within a givenrichness bin depends upon luminosity, suggesting that luminosity is moreclosely correlated with mass than galaxy counts. we split the samples byredshift but detect no significant evolution. the profiles are not welldescribed by power laws. in a subsequent series of papers we invert theprofiles to three-dimensional mass profiles, show that they are well fit by ahalo model description, measure mass-to-light ratios and provide a cosmologicalinterpretation.

1104.0928	new constraints on the evolution of the stellar-to-dark matter  connection: a combined analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing, clustering, and  stellar mass functions from z=0.2 to z=1	using data from the cosmos survey, we perform the first joint analysis ofgalaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy numberdensities. carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter betweenstellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using anovel and self-consistent theoretical framework. our results provide strongconstraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo massrelation (shmr) from z=0.2 to z=1. at low stellar mass, we find that halo massscales as mh m*^0.46 and that this scaling does not evolve significantly withredshift to z=1. we show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, mh/m*, varies from lowto high masses, reaching a minimum of mh/m*~27 at m*=4.5x10^10 msun andmh=1.2x10^12 msun. this minimum is important for models of galaxy formationbecause it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of thecentral galaxy has been the most efficient. we describe the shmr at thisminimum in terms of the "pivot stellar mass", m*piv, the "pivot halo mass",mhpiv, and the "pivot ratio", (mh/m*)piv. thanks to a homogeneous analysis of asingle data set, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends forboth mhpiv and m*piv. the pivot stellar mass decreases fromm*piv=5.75+-0.13x10^10 msun at z=0.88 to m*piv=3.55+-0.17x10^10 msun at z=0.37.intriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of mhpiv leaves the pivotratio constant with redshift at (mh/m*)piv~27. we use simple arguments to showhow this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching mayultimately depend on mh/m* and not simply mh, as is commonly assumed. we showthat simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in thesites of star formation. finally, we discuss the implications of our results inthe context of popular quenching models, including disk instabilities and agnfeedback.

1104.1635	cosmological constraints from galaxy clustering and the mass-to-number  ratio of galaxy clusters	we place constraints on the average density (omega_m) and clusteringamplitude (sigma_8) of matter using a combination of two measurements from thesloan digital sky survey: the galaxy two-point correlation function, w_p, andthe mass-to-galaxy-number ratio within galaxy clusters, m/n, analogous tocluster m/l ratios. our w_p measurements are obtained from dr7 while the sampleof clusters is the maxbcg sample, with cluster masses derived from weakgravitational lensing. we construct non-linear galaxy bias models using thehalo occupation distribution (hod) to fit both w_p and m/n for differentcosmological parameters. hod models that match the same two-point clusteringpredict different numbers of galaxies in massive halos when omega_m or sigma_8is varied, thereby breaking the degeneracy between cosmology and bias. wedemonstrate that this technique yields constraints that are consistent andcompetitive with current results from cluster abundance studies, even thoughthis technique does not use abundance information. using w_p and m/n alone, wefind omega_m^0.5*sigma_8=0.465+/-0.026, with individual constraints ofomega_m=0.29+/-0.03 and sigma_8=0.85+/-0.06. combined with current cmb data,these constraints are omega_m=0.290+/-0.016 and sigma_8=0.826+/-0.020. allerrors are 1-sigma. the systematic uncertainties that the m/n technique aremost sensitive to are the amplitude of the bias function of dark matter halosand the possibility of redshift evolution between the sdss main sample and themaxbcg sample. our derived constraints are insensitive to the current level ofuncertainties in the halo mass function and in the mass-richness relation ofclusters and its scatter, making the m/n technique complementary to clusterabundances as a method for constraining cosmology with future galaxy surveys.

1109.0010	the integrated stellar content of dark matter halos	measurements of the total amount of stars locked up in galaxies as a functionof host halo mass contain key clues about the efficiency of processes thatregulate star formation. we derive the total stellar mass fraction f_star as afunction of halo mass m500c from z=0.2 to z=1 using two complementary methods.first, we derive f_star using a statistical halo occupation distribution modeljointly constrained by data from lensing, clustering, and the stellar massfunction. this method enables us to probe f_star over a much wider halo massrange than with group or cluster catalogs. second, we derive f_star at groupscales using a cosmos x-ray group catalog and we show that the two methodsagree to within 30%. we quantify the systematic uncertainty on f_star usingabundance matching methods and we show that the statistical uncertainty onf_star (~10%) is dwarfed by systematic uncertainties associated with stellarmass measurements (~45% excluding imf uncertainties). assuming a chabrier imf,we find 0.012&lt;f_star&lt;0.025 at m500c=10^13 msun and 0.0057&lt;f_star&lt;0.015 atm500c=10^14 msun. these values are significantly lower than previouslypublished estimates. we investigate the cause of this difference and find thatprevious work has overestimated f_star due to a combination of inaccuratestellar mass estimators and/or because they have assumed that all galaxies ingroups are early type galaxies with a constant mass-to-light ratio. contrary toprevious claims, our results suggest that the mean value of f_star is alwayssignificantly lower than f_gas for halos above 10^13 msun. combining ourresults with recently published gas mas fractions, we find a shortfall inf_star+f_gas at r500c compared to the cosmic mean. this shortfall varies withhalo mass and becomes larger towards lower halos masses.

1109.5691	sample variance in photometric redshift calibration: cosmological biases  and survey requirements	we use n-body/photometric galaxy simulations to examine the impact of samplevariance of spectroscopic redshift samples on the accuracy of photometricredshift (photo-z) determination and calibration of photo-z errors. we estimatethe biases in the cosmological parameter constraints from weak lensing andderive requirements on the spectroscopic follow-up for three different photo-zalgorithms chosen to broadly span the range of algorithms available. we findthat sample variance is much more relevant for the photo-z error calibrationthan for photo-z training, implying that follow-up requirements are similar fordifferent algorithms. we demonstrate that the spectroscopic sample can be usedfor training of photo-zs and error calibration without incurring additionalbias in the cosmological parameters. we provide a guide for observing proposalsfor the spectroscopic follow-up to ensure that redshift calibration biases donot dominate the cosmological parameter error budget. for example, assumingoptimistically (pessimistically) that the weak lensing shear measurements fromthe dark energy survey could obtain 1-sigma constraints on the dark energyequation of state w of 0.035 (0.055), implies a follow-up requirement of 150(40) patches of sky with a telescope such as magellan, assuming a 1/8^2 degeffective field of view and 400 galaxies per patch. assuming (optimistically) avvds-like spectroscopic completeness with purely random failures, this could beaccomplished with about 75 (20) nights of observation. for more realisticassumptions regarding spectroscopic completeness, or in the presence of othersources of systematics not considered here, further degradations to dark energyconstraints are possible. we test several approaches for reducing therequirements. abridged

1109.6040	galaxies in x-ray groups i: robust membership assignment and the impact  of group environments on quenching	understanding the mechanisms that lead dense environments to host galaxieswith redder colors, more spheroidal morphologies, and lower star formationrates than field populations remains an important problem. as most candidateprocesses ultimately depend on host halo mass, accurate characterizations ofthe local environment, ideally tied to halo mass estimates and spanning a rangein halo mass and redshift are needed. in this work, we present and test arigorous, probabalistic method for assigning galaxies to groups based onprecise photometric redshifts and x-ray selected groups drawn from the cosmosfield. the groups have masses in the range 10^13 &lt; m_200c/m_sun &lt; 10^14 andspan redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1. we characterize our selection algorithm via tests onspectroscopic subsamples, including new data obtained at the vlt, and byapplying our method to detailed mock catalogs. we find that our group membergalaxy sample has a purity of 84% and completeness of 92% within 0.5 r200c. wemeasure the impact of uncertainties in redshifts and group centering on thequality of the member selection with simulations based on current data as wellas future imaging and spectroscopic surveys. as a first application of our newgroup member catalog which will be made publicly available, we show that membergalaxies exhibit a higher quenched fraction compared to the field at fixedstellar mass out to z~1, indicating a significant relationship between starformation and environment at group scales. we also address the suggestion thatdusty star forming galaxies in such groups may impact the high-l power spectrumof the cosmic microwave background and find that such a population cannotexplain the low power seen in recent sz measurements.

1110.4370	gravitationally consistent halo catalogs and merger trees for precision  cosmology	we present a new algorithm for generating merger trees and halo catalogswhich explicitly ensures consistency of halo properties (mass, position, andvelocity) across timesteps. our algorithm has demonstrated the ability toimprove both the completeness (through detecting and inserting otherwisemissing halos) and purity (through detecting and removing spurious objects) ofboth merger trees and halo catalogs. in addition, our method is able torobustly measure the self-consistency of halo finders; it is the first todirectly measure the uncertainties in halo positions, halo velocities, and thehalo mass function for a given halo finder based on consistency betweensnapshots in cosmological simulations. we use this algorithm to generate mergertrees for two large simulations (bolshoi and consuelo) and evaluate two halofinders (rockstar and bdm). we find that both the rockstar and bdm halo finderstrack halos extremely well; in both, the number of halos which do not havephysically consistent progenitors is at the 1-2% level across all halo masses.our code is publicly available at http://code.google.com/p/consistent-trees .our trees and catalogs are publicly available athttp://hipacc.ucsc.edu/bolshoi/ .

1110.4372	the rockstar phase-space temporal halo finder and the velocity offsets  of cluster cores	we present a new algorithm for identifying dark matter halos, substructure,and tidal features. the approach is based on adaptive hierarchical refinementof friends-of-friends groups in six phase-space dimensions and one timedimension, which allows for robust (grid-independent, shape-independent, andnoise-resilient) tracking of substructure; as such, it is named rockstar(robust overdensity calculation using k-space topologically adaptiverefinement). our method is massively parallel (up to 10^5 cpus) and runs on thelargest current simulations (&gt;10^10 particles) with high efficiency (10 cpuhours and 60 gigabytes of memory required per billion particles analyzed). aprevious paper (knebe et al 2011) has shown rockstar to have class-leadingrecovery of halo properties; we expand on these comparisons with more tests andhigher-resolution simulations. we show a significant improvement insubstructure recovery as compared to several other halo finders and discuss thetheoretical and practical limits of simulations in this regard. finally, wepresent results which demonstrate conclusively that dark matter halo cores arenot at rest relative to the halo bulk or satellite average velocities and havecoherent velocity offsets across a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. formassive clusters, these offsets can be up to 350 km/s at z=0 and even higher athigh redshifts. our implementation is publicly available athttp://code.google.com/p/rockstar .

1111.2611	the cosmic abundance of classical milky way satellites	we study the abundance of satellites akin to the brightest, classical dwarfspheroidals around galaxies similar in magnitude and isolation to the milky wayand m31 in the sloan digital sky survey. from a combination of photometric andspectroscopic redshifts, we bound the mean and the intrinsic scatter in thenumber of satellites down to ten magnitudes fainter than the milky way.restricting to magnitudes brighter than sagittarius, we show that the milky wayis not a significant statistical outlier in its population of classical dwarfspheroidals. at fainter magnitudes, we find an upper limit of 13 on the meannumber of satellites brighter than the fornax dwarf spheroidal. methods toimprove these limits that utilize full photometric redshift distributions holdpromise, but are currently limited by incompleteness at the very lowestredshifts. theoretical models are left to explain why the majority of darkmatter subhalos that orbit milky way-like galaxies are inefficient at makinggalaxies at the luminosity scale of the brightest dwarf spheroidals, or whythese subhalos predicted by lambda-cdm do not exist.

0710.3780	the galaxy content of sdss clusters and groups	imaging data from the sloan digital sky survey are used to characterize thepopulation of galaxies in groups and clusters detected with the maxbcgalgorithm. we investigate the dependence of brightest cluster galaxy (bcg)luminosity, and the distributions of satellite galaxy luminosity and satellitecolor, on cluster properties over the redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.3. the size ofthe dataset allows us to make measurements in many bins of cluster richness,radius and redshift. we find that, within r_200 of clusters with mass above3e13 h-1 m_sun, the luminosity function of both red and blue satellites is onlyweakly dependent on richness. we further find that the shape of the satelliteluminosity function does not depend on cluster-centric distance for magnitudesbrighter than ^{0.25}m_i - 5log(h) &lt; -19. however, the mix of faint red andblue galaxies changes dramatically. the satellite red fraction is dependent oncluster-centric distance, galaxy luminosity and cluster mass, and alsoincreases by ~5% between redshifts 0.28 and 0.2, independent of richness. wefind that bcg luminosity is tightly correlated with cluster richness, scalingas l_{bcg} ~ m_{200}^{0.3}, and has a gaussian distribution at fixed richness,with sigma_{log l} ~ 0.17 for massive clusters. the ratios of bcg luminosity tototal cluster luminosity and characteristic satellite luminosity scale stronglywith cluster richness: in richer systems, bcgs contribute a smaller fraction ofthe total light, but are brighter compared to typical satellites. this studydemonstrates the power of cross-correlation techniques for measuring galaxypopulations in purely photometric data.

1205.4245	the correlated formation histories of massive galaxies and their dark  matter halos	using observations in the cosmos field, we report an intriguing correlationbetween the star formation activity of massive (~10^{11.4}\msol) centralgalaxies, their stellar masses, and the large-scale (~10 mpc) environments oftheir group-mass (~10^{13.6}\msol) dark matter halos. probing the redshiftrange z=[0.2,1.0], our measurements come from two independent sources: an x-raydetected group catalog and constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relationderived from a combination of clustering and weak lensing statistics. at z=1,we find that the stellar mass in star-forming centrals is a factor of two lessthan in passive centrals at the same halo mass. this implies that the presenceor lack of star formation in group-scale centrals cannot be a stochasticprocess. by z=0, the offset reverses, probably as a result of the differentgrowth rates of these objects. a similar but weaker trend is observed whendividing the sample by morphology rather than star formation. remarkably, wefind that star-forming centrals at z~1 live in groups that are significantlymore clustered on 10 mpc scales than similar mass groups hosting passivecentrals. we discuss this signal in the context of halo assembly and recentsimulations, suggesting that star-forming centrals prefer halos with higherangular momentum and/or formation histories with more recent growth; such halosare known to evolve in denser large-scale environments. if confirmed, thiswould be evidence of an early established link between the assembly history ofhalos on large scales and the future properties of the galaxies that forminside them.

1205.4262	galaxies in x-ray groups. ii. a weak lensing study of halo centering	locating the centers of dark matter halos is critical for understanding themass profiles of halos as well as the formation and evolution of the massivegalaxies that they host. the task is observationally challenging because wecannot observe halos directly, and tracers such as bright galaxies or x-rayemission from hot plasma are imperfect. in this paper we quantify theconsequences of miscentering on the weak lensing signal from a sample of 129x-ray selected galaxy groups in the cosmos field with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1 and halomasses in the range 10^13 - 10^14 m_sun. by measuring the stacked lensingsignal around eight different candidate centers (such as the brightest membergalaxy, the mean position of all member galaxies, or the x-ray centroid), wedetermine which candidates best trace the center of mass in halos. in thissample of groups, we find that massive galaxies near the x-ray centroids tracethe center of mass to &lt;~75 kpc, while the x-ray position and centroids based onthe mean position of member galaxies have larger offsets primarily due to thestatistical uncertainties in their positions (typically ~50-150 kpc).approximately 30% of groups in our sample have ambiguous centers with multiplebright or massive galaxies, and these groups show disturbed mass profiles thatare not well fit by standard models, suggesting that they are merging systems.we find that halo mass estimates from stacked weak lensing can be biased low by5-30% if inaccurate centers are used and the issue of miscentering is notaddressed.

1207.2160	the connection between galaxies and dark matter structures in the local  universe	we provide new constraints on the connection between galaxies in the localuniverse, identified by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), and dark matterhalos and their constituent substructures in the $\lambda$cdm model using wmap7cosmological parameters. predictions for the abundance and clusteringproperties of dark matter halos, and the relationship between dark matter hostsand substructures, are based on a high-resolution cosmological simulation, thebolshoi simulation. we associate galaxies with halos and subhalos using subhaloabundance matching, performing a comprehensive analysis which investigates theunderlying assumptions of this technique including (a) which halo property ismost closely associated with galaxy stellar masses and luminosities, (b) howmuch scatter is in this relationship, and (c) how much subhalos can be strippedbefore their galaxies are destroyed. the models are jointly constrained by newmeasurements of the projected two-point galaxy clustering and the observedconditional stellar mass function of galaxies in groups. the data put tightconstraints on the satellite fraction of galaxies as a function of galaxystellar mass, on the scatter between halo and galaxy properties, and on theunderlying conditional stellar mass function. these data rule out several haloproperties commonly used in abundance matching, largely because the satellitefractions in the models disagree with those data. we show that an abundancematching model that associates galaxies with the peak circular velocity oftheir halos is in good agreement with the data, when scatter of $0.20 \pm 0.03$dex in stellar mass at a given peak velocity is included. this will yieldimportant constraints for galaxy formation models, and also providesencouraging indications that the galaxy--halo connection can be modeled withsufficient fidelity for future precision studies of the dark universe.

1207.2214	improved mock galaxy catalogs for the deep2 galaxy redshift survey from  subhalo abundance and environment matching	we develop empirical methods for modeling the galaxy population andpopulating cosmological n-body simulations with mock galaxies according to theobserved properties of galaxies in survey data. we use these techniques toproduce a new set of mock catalogs for the deep2 galaxy redshift survey basedon the output of the high-resolution bolshoi simulation, as well as two othersimulations with different cosmological parameters, all of which we release forpublic use. the mock-catalog creation technique uses subhalo abundance matchingto assign galaxy luminosities to simulated dark-matter halos. it then addscolor information to the resulting mock galaxies in a manner that depends onthe local galaxy density, in order to reproduce the measured color-environmentrelation in the data. in the course of constructing the catalogs, we testvarious models for including scatter in the relation between halo mass andgalaxy luminosity, within the abundance-matching framework. we find that thereis no constant-scatter model that can simultaneously reproduce both theluminosity function and the autocorrelation function of deep2. this result hasimplications for galaxy-formation theory, and it restricts the range ofcontexts in which the mocks can be usefully applied. nevertheless, carefulcomparisons show that our new mocks accurately reproduce a wide range of theother properties of the deep2 catalog, suggesting that they can be used to gaina detailed understanding of various selection effects in deep2.

1207.3347	spectroscopic failures in photometric redshift calibration: cosmological  biases and survey requirements	we use n-body-spectro-photometric simulations to investigate the impact ofincompleteness and incorrect redshifts in spectroscopic surveys to photometricredshift training and calibration and the resulting effects on cosmologicalparameter estimation from weak lensing shear-shear correlations. the photometryof the simulations is modeled after the upcoming dark energy survey and thespectroscopy is based on a low/intermediate resolution spectrograph withwavelength coverage of 5500{\aa} &lt; {\lambda} &lt; 9500{\aa}. the principalsystematic errors that such a spectroscopic follow-up encounters areincompleteness (inability to obtain spectroscopic redshifts for certaingalaxies) and wrong redshifts. encouragingly, we find that a neuralnetwork-based approach can effectively describe the spectroscopicincompleteness in terms of the galaxies' colors, so that the spectroscopicselection can be applied to the photometric sample. hence, we find thatspectroscopic incompleteness yields no appreciable biases to cosmology,although the statistical constraints degrade somewhat because the photometricsurvey has to be culled to match the spectroscopic selection. unfortunately,wrong redshifts have a more severe impact: the cosmological biases areintolerable if more than a percent of the spectroscopic redshifts areincorrect. moreover, we find that incorrect redshifts can also substantiallydegrade the accuracy of training set based photo-z estimators. the main problemis the difficulty of obtaining redshifts, either spectroscopically orphotometrically, for objects at z &gt; 1.3. we discuss several approaches forreducing the cosmological biases, in particular finding that photo-z errorestimators can reduce biases appreciably.

1207.6105	the average star formation histories of galaxies in dark matter halos  from z=0-8	we present a robust method to constrain average galaxy star formation rates,star formation histories, and the intracluster light as a function of halomass. our results are consistent with observed galaxy stellar mass functions,specific star formation rates, and cosmic star formation rates from z=0 to z=8.we consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results,including those affecting stellar masses, star formation rates, and the halomass function at the heart of our analysis. as they are relevant to our method,we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halomass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z=8. we alsoprovide new compilations of cosmic and specific star formation rates; morerecent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellarmass density at all redshifts. implications of our work include: halos near10^12 msun are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryonconversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z ~ 2.5 (consistentwith theories of cold-mode accretion), the icl for massive galaxies is expectedto be significant out to at least z ~ 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at lowredshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previousexpectations and form later than in most theoretical models. finally, weprovide new fitting formulae for star formation histories that are moreaccurate than the standard declining tau model. our approach places a widevariety of observations relating to the star formation history of galaxies intoa self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structureformation in lcdm. constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relationship andstar formation rates are available for download athttp://www.peterbehroozi.com/data.html .

1209.3013	on the lack of evolution in galaxy star formation efficiency	using reconstructed galaxy star formation histories, we calculate theinstantaneous efficiency of galaxy star formation (i.e., the star formationrate divided by the baryon accretion rate) from $z=8$ to the present day. thisefficiency exhibits a clear peak near a characteristic halo mass of 10^11.7msun, which coincides with longstanding theoretical predictions for the massscale relevant to virial shock heating of accreted gas. above thecharacteristic halo mass, the efficiency falls off as the mass to the minusfour-thirds power; below the characteristic mass, the efficiency falls off atan average scaling of mass to the two-thirds power. by comparison, the shapeand normalization of the efficiency change very little since z=4. we show thata time-independent star formation efficiency simply explains the shape of thecosmic star formation rate since z=4 in terms of dark matter accretion rates.the rise in the cosmic star formation from early times until z=2 is especiallysensitive to galaxy formation efficiency. the mass dependence of the efficiencystrongly limits where most star formation occurs, with the result thattwo-thirds of all star formation has occurred inside halos within a factor ofthree of the characteristic mass, a range that includes the mass of the milkyway.

0711.5027	merger histories of galaxy halos and implications for disk survival	we study the merger histories of galaxy dark matter halos using a highresolution lcdm n-body simulation. our merger trees follow ~17,000 halos withmasses m_0 = (10^11--10^13) msun at z=0 and track accretion events involvingobjects as small as m = 10^10 msun. we find that mass assembly is remarkablyself-similar in m/m_0, and dominated by mergers that are ~10% of the final halomass. while very large mergers, m &gt; 0.4 m_0, are quite rare, sizeable accretionevents, m ~ 0.1 m_0, are common. over the last 10 gyr, an overwhelming majority(~95%) of milky way-sized halos with m_0 = 10^12 msun have accreted at leastone object with greater total mass than the milky way disk (m &gt; 5x10^10 msun),and approximately 70% have accreted an object with more than twice that mass (m&gt; 10^11 msun). our results raise serious concerns about the survival ofthin-disk dominated galaxies within the current paradigm for galaxy formationin a cdm universe. in order to achieve a ~70% disk-dominated fraction in milkyway-sized cdm halos, mergers involving m ~ 2x10^11 msun objects must notdestroy disks. considering that most thick disks and bulges contain old stellarpopulations, the situation is even more restrictive: these mergers must notheat disks or drive gas into their centers to create young bulges.

1210.6358	rhapsody. ii. subhalo properties and the impact of tidal stripping from  a statistical sample of cluster-size halos	we discuss the properties of subhalos in cluster-size halos, using ahigh-resolution statistical sample: the rhapsody simulations introduced in wuet al. (2012). we demonstrate that the criteria applied to select subhalos havesignificant impact on the inferred properties of the sample, including thescatter in the number of subhalos, the correlation between the subhalo numberand formation time, and the shape of subhalos' spatial distribution andvelocity structure. we find that the number of subhalos, when selected usingthe peak maximum circular velocity in their histories (a property expected tobe closely related to the galaxy luminosity), is uncorrelated with theformation time of the main halo. this is in contrast to the previously reportedcorrelation from studies where subhalos are selected by the current maximumcircular velocity; we show that this difference is a result of the tidalstripping of the subhalos. we also find that the dominance of the main halo andthe subhalo mass fraction are strongly correlated with halo concentration andformation history. these correlations are important to take into account wheninterpreting results from cluster samples selected with different criteria. oursample also includes a fossil cluster, which is presented separately and placedin the context of the rest of the sample.

1301.5870	groups of two galaxies in sdss: implications of colours on star  formation quenching time-scales	we have devised a method to select galaxies that are isolated in their darkmatter halo (n=1 systems) and galaxies that reside in a group of exactly two(n=2 systems). our n=2 systems are widely-separated (up to$\sim$\,200\,$h^{-1}$\,kpc), where close galaxy-galaxy interactions are notdominant. we apply our selection criteria to two volume-limited samples ofgalaxies from sdss dr6 with $m_{r}-5 \log_{10} h \leq$ -19 and -20 to study theeffects of the environment of very sparse groups on galaxy colour. forsatellite galaxies in a group of two, we find a red excess attributed to starformation quenching of 0.15\,$\pm$\,0.01 and 0.14\,$\pm$\,0.01 for the -19 and-20 samples, respectively, relative to isolated galaxies of the same stellarmass. assuming n=1 systems are the progenitors of n=2 systems, animmediate-rapid star formation quenching scenario is inconsistent with theseobservations. a delayed-then-rapid star formation quenching scenario with adelay time of 3.3 and 3.7\,gyr for the -19 and -20 samples, respectively,yields a red excess prediction in agreement with the observations. theobservations also reveal that central galaxies in a group of two have a slightblue excess of 0.06\,$\pm$\,0.02 and 0.02\,$\pm$\,0.01 for the -19 and -20samples, respectively, relative to n=1 populations of the same stellar mass.our results demonstrate that even the environment of very sparse groups ofluminous galaxies influence galaxy evolution and in-depth studies of thesesimple systems are an essential step towards understanding galaxy evolution ingeneral.

1302.6620	galaxies in x-ray groups. iii. satellite color and morphology  transformations	while the star formation rates and morphologies of galaxies have long beenknown to correlate with their local environment, the process by which thesecorrelations are generated is not well understood. galaxy groups are thought toplay an important role in shaping the physical properties of galaxies beforeentering massive clusters at low redshift, and transformations of satellitegalaxies likely dominate the buildup of local environmental correlations. toilluminate the physical processes that shape galaxy evolution in denseenvironments, we study a sample of 116 x-ray selected galaxy groups at z=0.2-1with halo masses of 10^13-10^14 m_sun and centroids determined with weaklensing. we analyze morphologies based on hst imaging and colors determinedfrom 31 photometric bands for a stellar mass-limited population of 923satellite galaxies and a comparison sample of 16644 field galaxies. controllingfor variations in stellar mass across environments, we find significant trendsin the colors and morphologies of satellite galaxies with group-centricdistance and across cosmic time. specifically at low stellar mass(log(m_stellar/m_sun) = 9.8-10.3), the fraction of disk-dominated star-forminggalaxies declines from &gt;50% among field galaxies to &lt;20% among satellites nearthe centers of groups. this decline is accompanied by a rise in quenchedgalaxies with intermediate bulge+disk morphologies, and only a weak increase inred bulge-dominated systems. these results show that both color and morphologyare influenced by a galaxy's location within a group halo. we suggest thatstrangulation and disk fading alone are insufficient to explain the observedmorphological dependence on environment, and that galaxy mergers or close tidalencounters must play a role in building up the population of quenched galaxieswith bulges seen in dense environments at low redshift.

1304.4933	spatially unassociated galaxies contribute significantly to the blended  submillimetre galaxy population: predictions for follow-up observations of  alma sources	there is anecdotal evidence that spatially and physically unassociatedgalaxies blended into a single submillimetre (submm) source contribute to thesubmm galaxy (smg) population. this work is the first to theoretically predictthe number counts of such sources. we generate mock smg catalogues usinglightcones derived from the bolshoi cosmological simulation; to assign submmflux densities to the mock galaxies, we use a fitting function previouslyderived from the results of dust radiative transfer performed on hydrodynamicalsimulations of isolated disc and merging galaxies. we then calculate submmnumber counts for different beam sizes and without blending. we predict that &gt;~50 per cent of blended smgs have at least one spatially unassociated componentwith s_850 &gt; 1 mjy. for a 15-arcsec beam, blends of &gt;2 galaxies in which atleast one component is spatially unassociated dominate the blended sources withtotal s_850 &gt; ~3 mjy. the distribution of the redshift separations amongst thecomponents is strongly bimodal. the typical redshift separation of spatiallyunassociated blended sources is ~1. our predictions for the contributions ofspatially unassociated components and the distribution of redshift separationsare not testable with currently available data, but they will be easily testedonce sufficiently accurate redshifts for the individual subcomponents (resolvedby, e.g., alma) of a sufficient number of single-dish-detected blended smgs areavailable.

1305.0607	candels observations of the environmental dependence of the  color-mass-morphology relation at z = 1.6	we study the environmental dependence of color, stellar mass, and morphologyby comparing galaxies in a forming cluster to those in the field at z = 1:6with hubble space telescope near-infrared imaging in the candels/uds field. wequantify the morphology of the galaxies using the effective radius, reff, ands\'ersic index, n. in both the cluster and field, approximately half of thebulge-dominated galaxies (n &gt; 2) reside on the red sequence of thecolor-magnitude diagram, and most disk-dominated galaxies (n &lt; 2) have colorsexpected for star-forming galaxies. there is weak evidence that clustergalaxies have redder rest-frame u - b colors and higher stellar masses comparedto the field. star-forming galaxies in both the cluster and field show nosignificant differences in their morphologies. in contrast, there is evidencethat quiescent galaxies in the cluster have larger median effective radii andsmaller s\'ersic indices compared to the field with a significance of 2?. thesedifferences are most pronounced for galaxies at clustercentric distances 1 mpc&lt; rproj &lt; 1.5 mpc, which have low s\'ersic indices and possibly largereffective radii, more consistent with star-forming galaxies at this epoch andin contrast to other quiescent galaxies. we argue that star-forming galaxiesare processed under the influence of the cluster environment at distancesgreater than the cluster-halo virial radius. our results are consistent withmodels where gas accretion onto these galaxies is suppressed from processesassociated with the cluster environment.

1306.2971	reionization histories of milky way mass halos	we investigate the connection between the epoch of reionization and thepresent day universe, by examining the extended mass reionization histories ofdark matter halos identified at z=0. we combine an n-body dark mattersimulation of a 600 mpc volume with a three-dimensional, seminumericalreionization model. this provides reionization redshifts for each particle,which can then be connected with the properties of their halos at the presenttime. we find that the vast majority of present-day halos with masses largerthan ~ few x 10^11 msun reionize earlier than the rest of the universe. we alsofind significant halo-to-halo diversity in mass reionization histories, andfind that in realistic inhomogenous models, the material within a given halo isnot expected to reionize at the same time. in particular, the scatter inreionization times within individual halos is typically larger than the scatteramong halos. from our fiducial reionization model, we find that the typical 68%scatter in reionization times within halos is ~ 115 myr for 10^(12 \pm 0.25)msun halos, decreasing slightly to ~ 95 myr for 10^(15 \pm 0.25) msun halos. wefind a mild correlation between reionization history and environment: haloswith shorter reionization histories are typically in more clusteredenvironments, with the strongest trend on a scale of ~ 20 mpc. material inmilky way mass halos with short reionization histories is preferentiallyreionized in relatively large hii regions, implying reionization mostly bysources external to the progenitors of the present-day halo. we investigate theimpact on our results of varying the reionization model parameters, which spana range of reionization scenarios with varying timing and morphology.

1307.0011	virial scaling of galaxies in clusters: bright to faint is cool to hot	by combining galaxy tracers from high-resolution n-body and hydrodynamicalsimulations, we present a consistent picture of the behaviour of galaxyvelocities in massive clusters. in haloes above ~ 10^14 msun, the brightestsatellite galaxies are slightly cooler compared to the dark matter, whilefainter satellites are hotter. within the virial radius of a cluster, the meanvelocity dispersion based on the 100 brightest galaxies is a factor of 1.065+/- 0.005 (stat) +/- 0.027 (sys) higher than that of the dark matter(corresponding to a ~10-15 per cent bias in the dynamical mass estimate) whilethat based on only the five brightest galaxies is 0.868 +/- 0.039 (stat) +/-0.035 (sys). these trends are approximately independent of redshift. thevelocity structure is sensitive to the modelling of galaxies in clusters,indicative of the complex interplay of tidal stripping, dynamical friction, andmerging. velocity dispersions derived from instantaneous subhalo properties arelarger than those employing either peak subhalo properties or hydrodynamicalgalaxy tracers. the latter two methods are consistent, implying that stackedspectroscopic analysis of cluster samples should, after correction forprojection, show a trend towards slightly higher velocities when faintergalaxies are included, with an unbiased measure of dark matter velocitydispersion coming from approximately 30 galaxies per cluster. we show evidencethat the velocity distribution function of bright galaxies near the clustercentre has a low-velocity tail due to strong dynamical friction.

1310.2239	mergers and mass accretion for infalling halos both end well outside  cluster virial radii	we find that infalling dark matter halos (i.e., the progenitors of satellitehalos) begin losing mass well outside the virial radius of their eventual hosthalos. the peak mass occurs at a range of clustercentric distances, with medianand 68th percentile range of 1.8 +2.3/-1.0 r_(vir,host) for progenitors of z=0satellites. the peak circular velocity for infalling halos occurs atsignificantly larger distances (3.7 +3.3/-2.2 r_(vir,host) at z=0). thisdifference arises because different physical processes set peak circularvelocity (typically, ~1:5 and larger mergers which cause transient circularvelocity spikes) and peak mass (typically, smooth accretion) for infallinghalos. we find that infalling halos also stop having significant mergers wellbefore they enter the virial radius of their eventual hosts. mergers largerthan a 1:40 ratio in halo mass end for infalling halos at similarclustercentric distances (~ 1.9 r_(vir,host)) as the end of overall massaccretion. however, mergers larger than 1:3 typically end for infalling halosat more than 4 virial radial away from their eventual hosts. this limits theability of mergers to affect quenching and morphology changes in clusters. wealso note that the transient spikes which set peak circular velocity may leadto issues with abundance matching on that parameter, including unphysicalgalaxy stellar mass growth profiles near clusters; we propose a simpleobservational test to check if a better halo proxy for galaxy stellar massexists.

1312.3233	a comparison between semi-analytic model predictions for the candels  survey	we compare the predictions of three independently developed semi-analyticgalaxy formation models that are being used to aid in the interpretation ofresults from the candels survey. these models are each applied to the same setof halo merger trees extracted from the "bolshoi" simulation and are carefullytuned to match the local galaxy stellar mass function using the powerful methodof bayesian inference coupled with mcmc or by hand. the comparisons reveal thatin spite of the significantly different parameterizations for star formationand feedback processes, the three models yield qualitatively similarpredictions for the assembly histories of galaxy stellar mass and starformation over cosmic time. we show that the sams generally require strongoutflows to suppress star formation in low-mass halos to match the present daystellar mass function. however, all of the models considered producepredictions for the star formation rates and metallicities of low-mass galaxiesthat are inconsistent with existing data and diverge between the models. wesuggest that large differences in the metallicity relations and smalldifferences in the stellar mass assembly histories of model galaxies stem fromdifferent assumptions for the outflow mass-loading factor. importantly, whilemore accurate observational measurements for stellar mass, sfr and metallicityof galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;5 will discriminate between models, the discrepanciesbetween the models and existing data of these observables have already revealedchallenging problems in understanding star formation and its feedback in galaxyformation. the three sets of models are being used to construct catalogs ofmock galaxies on light cones that have the same geometry as the candels survey,which should be particularly useful for quantifying the biases anduncertainties on measurements and inferences from the real observations.-abridged

1402.2036	formation of disk galaxies in preheated media: a preventative feedback  model	we introduce a semi-analytic galaxy formation model implementing aself-consistent treatment for the hot halo gas configuration and the assemblyof central disks. using the model, we explore a preventative feedback model, inwhich the circum-halo medium is assumed to be preheated up to a certain entropylevel by early starbursts or other processes, and compare it with an ejectivefeedback model, in which baryons are first accreted into dark matter halos andsubsequently ejected out by feedback. the model demonstrates that when themedium is preheated to an entropy comparable to the halo virial entropy thebaryon accretion can be largely reduced and delayed. in addition, the preheatedmedium can establish an extended low density gaseous halo when it accretes intothe dark matter halos, and result in a specific angular momentum of the coolinggas large enough to form central disks as extended as those observed. combinedwith simulated halo assembly histories, the preventative feedback model canreproduce remarkably well a number of observational scaling relations. theseinclude the cold baryon (stellar plus cold gas) mass fraction-halo massrelations, star formation histories, disk size-stellar mass relation and itsevolution, and the number density of low-mass galaxies as a function ofredshift. in contrast, the conventional ejective feedback model fails toreproduce these observational trends. using the model, we demonstrate that theproperties of disk galaxies are closely tied to the thermal state of hot halogas and even possibly the circum-halo medium, which suggests that observationaldata for the disk properties and circum-galactic hot/warm medium may jointlyprovide interesting constraints for galaxy formation models.

0803.1491	the effects of halo assembly bias on self-calibration in galaxy cluster  surveys	self-calibration techniques for analyzing galaxy cluster counts utilize theabundance and the clustering amplitude of dark matter halos. these propertiessimultaneously constrain cosmological parameters and the clusterobservable-mass relation. it was recently discovered that the clusteringamplitude of halos depends not only on the halo mass, but also on varioussecondary variables, such as the halo formation time and the concentration;these dependences are collectively termed assembly bias. applying modifiedfisher matrix formalism, we explore whether these secondary variables have asignificant impact on the study of dark energy properties using theself-calibration technique in current (sdss) and the near future (des, spt, andlsst) cluster surveys. the impact of the secondary dependence is determined by(1) the scatter in the observable-mass relation and (2) the correlation betweenobservable and secondary variables. we find that for optical surveys, thesecondary dependence does not significantly influence an sdss-like survey;however, it may affect a des-like survey (given the high scatter currentlyexpected from optical clusters) and an lsst-like survey (even for low scattervalues and low correlations). for an sz survey such as spt, the impact ofsecondary dependence is insignificant if the scatter is 20% or lower but can beenhanced by the potential high scatter values introduced by a highly correlatedbackground. accurate modeling of the assembly bias is necessary for clusterself-calibration in the era of precision cosmology.

1407.6012	the relation between sfr and stellar mass for galaxies at 3.5 $\le z\le$  6.5 in candels	distant star-forming galaxies show a correlation between their star formationrates (sfr) and stellar masses, and this has deep implications for galaxyformation. here, we present a study on the evolution of the slope and scatterof the sfr-stellar mass relation for galaxies at $3.5\leq z\leq 6.5$ usingmulti-wavelength photometry in goods-s from the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels) and spitzer extended deep survey. wedescribe an updated, bayesian spectral-energy distribution fitting method thatincorporates effects of nebular line emission, star formation histories thatare constant or rising with time, and different dust attenuation prescriptions(starburst and small magellanic cloud). from $z$=6.5 to $z$=3.5 star-forminggalaxies in candels follow a nearly unevolving correlation between stellar massand sfr that follows sfr $\sim$ $m_\star^a$ with $a = 0.54 \pm 0.16$ at $z\sim6$ and $0.70 \pm 0.21$ at $z\sim 4$. this evolution requires a star formationhistory that increases with decreasing redshift (on average, the sfrs ofindividual galaxies rise with time). the observed scatter in the sfr-stellarmass relation is tight, $\sigma(\log \mathrm{sfr}/\mathrm{m}_\odot$ yr$^{-1})&lt;0.3\ - $ 0.4 dex, for galaxies with $\log m_\star/\mathrm{m}_\odot &gt; 9$ dex.assuming that the sfr is tied to the net gas inflow rate (sfr $\sim$$\dot{m}_\mathrm{gas}$), then the scatter in the gas inflow rate is alsosmaller than 0.3$-$0.4 dex for star-forming galaxies in these stellar mass andredshift ranges, at least when averaged over the timescale of star formation.we further show that the implied star formation history of objects selected onthe basis of their co-moving number densities is consistent with the evolutionin the sfr-stellar mass relation.

1410.1193	redmapper iv: photometric membership identification of cluster galaxies  with 1% precision	in order to study the galaxy population of galaxy clusters with photometricdata one must be able to accurately discriminate between cluster members andnon-members. the redmapper cluster finding algorithm treats this problemprobabilistically. here, we utilize sdss and gama spectroscopic membershiprates to validate the redmapper membership probability estimates for clusterswith $z\in[0.1,0.3]$. we find small - but correctable - biases, sourced bythree different systematics. the first two were expected a priori, namely bluecluster galaxies and correlated structure along the line of sight. the thirdsystematic is new: the redmapper template fitting exhibits a non-trivialdependence on photometric noise, which biases the original redmapperprobabilities when utilizing noisy data. after correcting for these effects, wefind exquisite agreement ($\approx 1\%$) between the photometric probabilityestimates and the spectroscopic membership rates, demonstrating that we canrobustly recover cluster membership estimates from photometric data alone. as abyproduct of our analysis we find that on average unavoidable projectioneffects from correlated structure contribute $\approx 6\%$ of the richness of aredmapper galaxy cluster. this work also marks the second public release of thesdss redmapper cluster catalog.

0804.0426	the assembly of galaxy clusters	we study the formation of fifty-three galaxy cluster-size dark matter halosformed within a pair of cosmological lcdm n-body simulations, and track theaccretion histories of cluster subhalos with masses large enough to host 0.1l*galaxies. by associating subhalos with cluster galaxies, we find the majorityof galaxies in clusters experience no pre-processing in the group environmentprior to their accretion into the cluster. on average, ~70% of cluster galaxiesfall into the cluster potential directly from the field, with no luminouscompanions in their host halos at the time of accretion; and less than ~12% areaccreted as members of groups with five or more galaxies. moreover, we findthat cluster galaxies are significantly less likely to have experienced amerger in the recent past (~6 gyr) than a field halo of the same mass. theseresults suggest that local, cluster processes like ram-pressure stripping,galaxy harassment, or strangulation play the dominant role in explaining thedifference between cluster and field populations at a fixed stellar mass; andthat pre-evolution or past merging in the group environment is of secondaryimportance for setting cluster galaxy properties for most clusters. theaccretion times for z = 0 cluster members are quite extended, with ~20%incorporated into the cluster halo more than 7 gyr ago and ~20% within the last2 gyr. by comparing the observed morphological fractions in cluster and fieldpopulations, we estimate an approximate timescale for late-type to early-typetransformation within the cluster environment to be ~6 gyr.

1503.02637	the dependence of subhalo abundance on halo concentration	hierarchical structure formation implies that the number of subhalos within adark matter halo depends not only on halo mass, but also on the formationhistory of the halo. this dependence on the formation history, which is highlycorrelated with halo concentration, can account for the super-poissonianscatter in subhalo occupation at a fixed halo mass that has been previouslymeasured in simulations. here we propose a model to predict the subhaloabundance function for individual host halos, that incorporates both halo massand concentration. we combine results of cosmological simulations with a newsuite of zoom-in simulations of milky way-mass halos to calibrate our model. weshow the model can successfully reproduce the mean and the scatter of subhalooccupation in these simulations. the implications of this correlation betweensubhalo abundance and halo concentration are further investigated. we alsodiscuss cases in which inferences about halo properties can be affected if thiscorrelation between subhalo abundance and halo concentration is ignored; inthese cases our model would give a more accurate inference. we propose thatwith future deep surveys, satellite occupation in the low-mass regime can beused to verify the existence of halo assembly bias.

1503.03924	rhapsody-g simulations: galaxy clusters as baryonic closed boxes and the  covariance between hot gas and galaxies	within a sufficiently large cosmic volume, conservation of baryons implies asimple `closed box' view in which the sum of the baryonic components must equala constant fraction of the total enclosed mass. we present evidence fromrhapsody-g hydrodynamic simulations of massive galaxy clusters that theclosed-box expectation may hold to a surprising degree within the interior,non-linear regions of haloes. at a fixed halo mass, we find a significantanti-correlation between hot gas mass fraction and galaxy mass fraction (coldgas + stars), with a rank correlation coefficient of -0.69 within $r_{500c}$.because of this anti-correlation, the total baryon mass serves as a low-scatterproxy for total cluster mass. the fractional scatter of total baryon fractionscales approximately as $0.02 (\delta_c/100)^{0.6}$, while the scatter ofeither gas mass or stellar mass is larger in magnitude and declines more slowlywith increasing radius. we discuss potential observational tests using clustersamples selected by optical and hot gas properties; the simulations suggestthat joint selection on stellar and hot gas has potential to achieve 5% scatterin total halo mass.

1505.01501	a critical assessment of stellar mass measurement methods	in this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the main sources of randomand systematic errors in stellar mass measurement for galaxies using theirspectral energy distributions (seds). we use mock galaxy catalogs withsimulated multi-waveband photometry (from u-band to mid-infrared) and knownredshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. givendifferent parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric s/nratios, sed fitting errors, systematic effects, the inherent degeneracies andcorrelated errors), we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs toquantify these effects individually. we studied the sensitivity of stellar massestimates to the codes/methods used, population synthesis models, starformation histories, nebular emission line contributions, photometricuncertainties, extinction and age. for each simulated galaxy, the differencebetween the input stellar masses and those estimated using different simulationcatalogs, $\delta\log(m)$, was calculated and used to identify the mostfundamental parameters affecting stellar masses. we measured differentcomponents of the error budget, with the results listed as follows: (1). nosignificant bias was found among different codes/methods, with all havingcomparable scatter; (2). a source of error is found to be due to photometricuncertainties and low resolution in age and extinction grids; (3). the medianof stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the massassociated with any given galaxy; (4). the deviations in stellar mass stronglycorrelate with those in age, with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5).the scatter in the stellar masses due to free parameters are quantified, withthe sensitivity of the stellar mass to both the population synthesis codes andinclusion of nebular emission lines studied.

1506.00169	the tully-fisher and mass-size relations from halo abundance matching	the tully-fisher relation (tfr) expresses the connection between rotatinggalaxies and the dark matter haloes they inhabit, and therefore contains awealth of information about galaxy formation. we construct a general frameworkto investigate whether models based on halo abundance matching are able toreproduce the observed stellar mass tfr and mass-size relation (msr), and usethe data to constrain galaxy formation parameters. our model tests a range ofplausible scenarios, differing in the response of haloes to disc formation, therelative angular momentum of baryons and dark matter, the impact of selectioneffects, and the abundance matching parameters. we show that agreement with theobserved tfr puts an upper limit on the scatter between galaxy and haloproperties, requires weak or reversed halo contraction, and favours selectioneffects that preferentially eliminate fast-rotating galaxies. the msrconstrains the ratio of the disc to halo specific angular momentum to beapproximately in the range 0.6-1.2. we identify and quantify two problems thatmodels of this nature face. (1) they predict too large an intrinsic scatter forthe msr, and (2) they predict too strong an anticorrelation between the tfr andmsr residuals. we argue that resolving these problems requires introducing acorrelation between stellar surface density and enclosed dark matter mass.finally, we explore the expected difference between the tfrs of central andsatellite galaxies, finding that in the favoured models this difference shouldbe detectable in a sample of ~700 galaxies.

0805.3346	connecting galaxies, halos, and star formation rates across cosmic time	a simple, observationally-motivated model is presented for understanding howhalo masses, galaxy stellar masses, and star formation rates are related, andhow these relations evolve with time. the relation between halo mass and galaxystellar mass is determined by matching the observed spatial abundance ofgalaxies to the expected spatial abundance of halos at multiple epochs -- i.e.more massive galaxies are assigned to more massive halos at each epoch. halosat different epochs are connected by halo mass accretion histories estimatedfrom n-body simulations. the halo--galaxy connection at fixed epochs inconjunction with the connection between halos across time provides a connectionbetween observed galaxies across time. with approximations for the impact ofmerging and accretion on the growth of galaxies, one can then directly inferthe star formation histories of galaxies as a function of stellar and halomass. this model is tuned to match both the observed evolution of the stellarmass function and the normalization of the observed star formation rate --stellar mass relation to z~1. the data demands, for example, that the starformation rate density is dominated by galaxies with mstar~10^{10.0-10.5} msunfrom 0&lt;z&lt;1, and that such galaxies over these epochs reside in halos withm~10^{11.5-12.5} msun. the star formation rate -- halo mass relation isapproximately gaussian over the range 0&lt;z&lt;1 with a mildly evolving mean andnormalization. this model is then used to shed light on a number of issues,including 1) a clarification of ``downsizing'', 2) the lack of a sharpcharacteristic halo mass at which star formation is truncated, and 3) thedominance of star formation over merging to the stellar build-up of galaxieswith mstar&lt;10^11 msun at z&lt;1.

astro-ph;0011261	galaxy formation at z~3: constraints from spatial clustering	we use n-body simulations combined with semi-analytic models to compute theclustering properties of modeled galaxies at z~3, and confront thesepredictions with the clustering properties of the observed population oflyman-break galaxies (lbgs). several scenarios for the nature of lbgs areexplored, which may be broadly categorized into models in which high-redshiftstar formation is driven by collisional starbursts and those in which quiescentstar formation dominates. for each model, we make predictions for the lbgoverdensity distribution, the variance of counts-in-cells, the correlationlength, and close pair statistics. models which assume a one-to-onerelationship between massive dark-matter halos and galaxies are disfavored byclose pair statistics, as are models in which colliding halos are associatedwith galaxies in a simplified way. however, when modeling of gas consumptionand star formation is included using a semi-analytic treatment, the quiescentand collisional starburst models predict similar clustering properties and noneof these models can be ruled out based on the available clustering data. noneof the ``realistic'' models predict a strong dependence of clustering amplitudeon the luminosity threshold of the sample, in apparent conflict with someobservational results.

astro-ph;0106293	galaxy halo occupation at high redshift	we discuss how current and future data on the clustering and number densityof z~3 lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) can be used to constrain their relationshipto dark matter haloes. we explore a three-parameter model in which the numberof lbgs per dark halo scales like a power-law in the halo mass: n(m) =(m/m_1)^s for m&gt;m_m. here, m_m is the minimum mass halo that can host an lbg,m_1 is a normalization parameter, associated with the mass above which haloeshost more than one observed lbg, and s determines the strength of the massdependence. we show how these three parameters are constrained by threeobservable properties of lbgs: the number density, the large-scale bias, andthe fraction of objects in close pairs. given these three quantities, the threeunknown model parameters may be estimated analytically, allowing a fullexploration of parameter space. as an example, we assume an lcdm cosmology andconsider the observed properties of a recent sample of spectroscopicallyconfirmed lbgs. we find that the favored range for our model parameters is m_m= (0.4-8)x10^10 msun/h, m_1 = (6-10)x10^12 msun/h, and 0.9 &lt; s &lt; 1.1. thepreferred region in m_m expands by an order of magnitude and slightly shallowerslopes are acceptable if the allowed range of bias is permitted to span allrecent observational estimates. we also discuss how the observed clustering oflbgs as a function of luminosity can be used to constrain halo occupation,although due to current observational uncertainties we are unable to reach anystrong conclusions. our methods and results can be used to constrain morerealistic models that aim to derive the occupation function n(m) from firstprinciples, and offer insight into how basic physical properties affect theobserved properties of lbgs.

astro-ph;0108151	concentrations of dark halos from their assembly histories	(abridged) we study the relation between the density profiles of dark matterhalos and their mass assembly histories, using a statistical sample of halos ina high-resolution n-body simulation of the lcdm cosmology. for each halo atz=0, we identify its merger-history tree, and determine concentrationparameters c_vir for all progenitors, thus providing a structural merger treefor each halo. we fit the mass accretion histories by a universal function withone parameter, the formation epoch a_c, defined when the log mass accretionrate dlogm/dloga falls below a critical value s. we find that late forminggalaxies tend to be less concentrated, such that c_vir ``observed'' at anyepoch a_o is strongly correlated with a_c via c_vir=c_1*a_o/a_c. scatter aboutthis relation is mostly due to measurement errors in c_v and a_c, implying thatthe actual spread in c_vir for halos of a given mass can be mostly attributedto scatter in a_c. we demonstrate that this relation can also be used topredict the mass and redshift dependence of c_v, and the scatter about themedian c_vir(m,z), using accretion histories derived from the extendedpress-schechter (eps) formalism, after adjusting for a constant offset betweenthe formation times as predicted by eps and as measured in the simulations;thisnew ingredient can thus be easily incorporated into semi-analytic models ofgalaxy formation. the correlation found between halo concentration and massaccretion rate suggests a physical interpretation: for high mass infall ratesthe central density is related to the background density; when the mass infallrate slows, the central density stays approximately constant and the haloconcentration just grows as r_vir. the tight correlation demonstrated hereprovides an essential new ingredient for galaxy formation modeling.

astro-ph;0112504	the masses of lyman break galaxies	data on galaxies at high redshift, identified by the lyman-break photometrictechnique, can teach us about how galaxies form and evolve. the stellar massesand other properties of such lyman break galaxies (lbgs) depend sensitively onthe details of star formation. in this paper we consider three different starformation prescriptions, and use semi-analytic methods applied to thenow-standard $\lambda$cdm theory of hierarchical structure formation to showhow these assumptions about star formation affect the predicted masses of thestars in these galaxies and the masses of the dark matter halos that host them.we find that, within the rather large uncertainties, recent estimates of thestellar masses of lbgs from multi-color photometry are consistent with thepredictions of all three models. however, the estimated stellar masses are moreconsistent with the predictions of two of the models in which star formation isaccelerated at high redshifts $z\gsim3$, and of these models the one in whichmany of the lbgs are merger-driven starbursts is also more consistent withindications that many high redshift galaxies are gas rich. the clusteringproperties of lbgs have put some constraints on the masses of their host halos,but due to similarities in the halo occupation of the three models we considerand degeneracies between model parameters, current constraints are not yetsufficient to distinguish between realistic models.

astro-ph;0308519	the dark side of the halo occupation distribution	we analyze the halo occupation distribution (hod), the probability for a haloof mass m to host a number of subhalos n, and two-point correlation function ofgalaxy-size dark matter halos using high-resolution dissipationless simulationsof the concordance flat lcdm model. the halo samples include both the hosthalos and the subhalos, distinct gravitationally-bound halos within thevirialized regions of larger host systems. we find that the first moment of thehod, &lt;n&gt;(m), has a complicated shape consisting of a step, a shoulder, and apower law high-mass tail. the hod can be described by a poisson statistics athigh halo masses but becomes sub-poisson for &lt;n&gt;&lt;4. we show that the hod can beunderstood as a combination of the probability for a halo of mass m to host acentral galaxy and the probability to host a given number ns of satellitegalaxies. the former can be approximated by a step-like function, while thelatter can be well approximated by a poisson distribution, fully specified byits first moment &lt;ns&gt;(m). we find that &lt;ns&gt;~m^b with b~1 for a wide range ofnumber densities, redshifts, and different power spectrum normalizations. thisformulation provides a simple but accurate model for the halo occupationdistribution found in simulations. at z=0, the two-point correlation function(cf) of galactic halos can be well fit by a power law down to ~100/h kpc withan amplitude and slope similar to those of observed galaxies. at redshiftsz&gt;~1, we find significant departures from the power-law shape of the cf atsmall scales. if the deviations are as strong as indicated by our results, theassumption of the single power law often used in observational analyses ofhigh-redshift clustering is likely to bias the estimates of the correlationlength and slope of the correlation function.

astro-ph;0404168	modeling galaxy-mass correlations in dissipationless simulations	we use high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance flatlcdm model to make predictions for the galaxy--mass (gm) correlations andcompare them to the recent sdss weak lensing measurements.we use a simpleobservationally motivated scheme to assign luminosities and colors to thehalos.this allows us to closely match the selection criteria used to defineobservational samples.the simulations reproduce the observed gm correlationfunction and its observed dependencies on luminosity and color.the luminositydependence of the correlation function is primarily determined by the changingrelative contribution of central and satellite galaxies at differentluminosities. the color dependence of the gm correlations reflects thedifference in the typical environments of blue and red galaxies. we also findagreement between the predicted and observed cross-bias, b_x=b/r,at all probedscales.the gm correlation coefficient, r, is close to unity on scales &gt;1/hmpc.the cross bias is thus expected to measure the actual bias of galaxyclustering on these scales.the aperture mass-to-light ratio is independent ofgalaxy color.the aperture mass scales approximately linearly with luminosity atl_r&gt;10^{10}h^{-2} lsun, while at lower luminosities the scaling is shallower:l_r^{0.5}. we show that most of the luminous galaxies (m_r&lt;-21) are near thecenters of their halos and their gm correlation function at r&lt;100/h kpc cantherefore be interpreted as the average dark matter density profile of thesegalaxies. we find that for galaxies in a given narrow luminosity range, thereis a broad and possibly non-gaussian distribution of halo virial masses.therefore, the average relation between mass and luminosity derived from theweak lensing analyses should be interpreted with caution.

astro-ph;0410467	measurement of galaxy cluster sizes, radial profiles, and luminosity  functions from sdss photometric data	imaging data from the sloan digital sky survey is used to measure theempirical size-richness relation for a large sample of galaxy clusters. usingpopulation subtraction methods, we determine the radius at which the clustergalaxy number density is 200/omega_m times the mean galaxy density, withoutassuming a model for the radial distribution of galaxies in clusters. if thesegalaxies are unbiased on mpc scales, this galaxy-density-based r_200 reflectsthe characteristic radii of clusters. we measure the scaling of thischaracteristic radius with richness over an order of magnitude in clusterrichness, from rich clusters to poor groups. we use this information to examinethe radial profiles of galaxies in clusters as a function of cluster richness,finding that the concentration of the galaxy distribution decreases withrichness and is systematically lower than the concentrations measured for darkmatter profiles in n-body simulations. using these scaled radii, we investigatethe behavior of the cluster luminosity function, and find that it is wellmatched by a schechter function for galaxies brighter than m_r = -18 only afterthe central galaxy has been removed. we find that the luminosity functionvaries with richness and with distance from the cluster center, underscoringthe importance of using an aperture that scales with cluster mass to comparephysically equivalent regions of these different systems. we note that thelowest richness systems in our catalog have properties consistent with thoseexpected of the earliest-forming halos; our cluster-finding algorithm, inaddition to reliably finding clusters, may be efficient at finding fossilgroups.

astro-ph;0410711	galaxy-galaxy lensing: dissipationless simulations versus the halo model	galaxy-galaxy lensing is a powerful probe of the relation between galaxiesand dark matter halos, but its theoretical interpretation requires a carefulmodeling of various contributions, such as the contribution from central andsatellite galaxies. for this purpose, a phenomenological approach based on thehalo model has been developed, allowing for fast exploration of the parameterspace of models. in this paper, we investigate the ability of the halo model toextract information from the g-g weak lensing signal by comparing it tohigh-resolution dissipationless simulations that resolve subhalos. we find thatthe halo model reliably determines parameters such as the host halo mass ofcentral galaxies, the fraction of galaxies that are satellites, and theirradial distribution inside larger halos. if there is a significant scatterpresent in the central galaxy host halo mass distribution, then the mean andmedian mass of that distribution can differ significantly from one another, andthe halo model mass determination lies between the two. this result suggeststhat when analyzing the data, galaxy subsamples with a narrow central galaxyhalo mass distribution, such as those based on stellar mass, should be chosenfor a simpler interpretation of the results.

astro-ph;0411586	the physics of galaxy clustering i: a model for subhalo populations	(abridged) we present a semi-analytic model for cold dark matter halosubstructure that can be used as a framework for studying galaxy formation andan ingredient in halo models of galaxy clustering. we perform a comprehensivecomparison of the model to the results of a suite of high-resolutioncosmological simulations. the comparisons reveal that subhalo statistics, suchas velocity and mass functions, radial distributions, and the halo occupationdistributions, agree well over three orders of magnitude in host halo mass atvarious redshifts. both in the simulations and in our model, the radialdistributions of subhalos are significantly shallower than that of the darkmatter density. the abundance of subhalos in a host is set by competitionbetween destruction and new accretion. high mass halos and halos at highredshift tend to host more subhalos because the subhalos have, on average, beenaccreted more recently. similarly, at fixed mass, halos that formed morerecently host more subhalos. observed "fossil groups" may represent an extremetail of this correlation. we find a related correlation between host haloconcentration and subhalo abundance at fixed host mass, nsat ~ c^-a, where achanges with redshift and host-to-subhalo mass ratio. lastly, we use our modelto populate host halos in one of our high-resolution cosmological simulations,replacing the subhalos resolved in the simulation with subhalos computedaccording to our model. we show that the resulting 2pt correlation function ofsuch a "hybrid" halo ensemble is indistinguishable from that measured directlyin the simulation. this supports one of the key tenets of the standard halomodel -- the assumption that the halo occupation distribution is statisticallyindependent of host halo environment.

astro-ph;0412161	the ultimate halo mass in a lcdm universe	in the far future of an accelerating lcdm cosmology, the cosmic web oflarge-scale structure consists of a set of increasingly isolated halos indynamical equilibrium. we examine the approach of collisionless dark matter tohydrostatic equilibrium using a large n-body simulation evolved to scale factora = 100, well beyond the vacuum--matter equality epoch, a_eq ~ 0.75, and 53/hgyr into the future for a concordance model universe (omega_m ~ 0.3,omega_lambda ~ 0.7). the radial phase-space structure of halos -- characterizedat a &lt; a_eq by a pair of zero-velocity surfaces that bracket a dynamicallyactive accretion region -- simplifies at a &gt; 10 a_eq when these surfaces mergeto create a single zero-velocity surface, clearly defining the halo outerboundary, rhalo, and its enclosed mass, mhalo. this boundary approaches a fixedphysical size encompassing a mean interior density ~ 5 times the criticaldensity, similar to the turnaround value in a classical einstein-desittermodel. we relate mhalo to other scales currently used to define halo mass(m200, mvir, m180b) and find that m200 is approximately half of the totalasymptotic cluster mass, while m180b follows the evolution of the inner zerovelocity surface for a &lt; 2 but becomes much larger than the total bound massfor a &gt; 3. the radial density profile of all bound halo material is well fit bya truncated hernquist profile. an nfw profile provides a somewhat better fitinterior to r200 but is much too shallow in the range r200 &lt; r &lt; rhalo.

astro-ph;0508497	the shape of dark matter halos: dependence on mass, redshift, radius,  and formation	using six high resolution dissipationless simulations with a varying box sizein a flat lcdm universe, we study the mass and redshift dependence of darkmatter halo shapes for m_vir = 9.0e11 - 2.0e14, over the redshift range z=0-3,and for two values of sigma_8=0.75 and 0.9. remarkably, we find that theredshift, mass, and sigma_8 dependence of the mean smallest-to-largest axisratio of halos is well described by the simple power-law relation &lt;s&gt; = (0.54+- 0.02)(m_vir/m_*)^(-0.050 +- 0.003), where s is measured at 0.3 r_vir and thez and sigma_8 dependences are governed by the characteristic nonlinear mass,m_*=m_*(z,sigma_8). we find that the scatter about the mean s is well describedby a gaussian with sigma ~ 0.1, for all masses and redshifts. we compare ourresults to a variety of previous works on halo shapes and find that reporteddifferences between studies are primarily explained by differences in theirmethodologies. we address the evolutionary aspects of individual halo shapes byfollowing the shapes of the halos through ~100 snapshots in time. we determinethe formation scalefactor a_c as defined by wechsler et al.

astro-ph;0512234	modeling luminosity-dependent galaxy clustering through cosmic time	we employ high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance lcdmcosmology to model the observed luminosity dependence and evolution of galaxyclustering through most of the age of the universe, from z~5 to z~0. we use asimple, non-parametric model which monotonically relates galaxy luminosities tothe maximum circular velocity of dark matter halos (v_max) by preserving theobserved galaxy luminosity function in order to match the halos in simulationswith observed galaxies. the novel feature of the model is the use of themaximum circular velocity at the time of accretion, v_max,acc, for subhalos,the halos located within virial regions of larger halos. we argue that forsubhalos in dissipationless simulations, v_max,acc reflects the luminosity andstellar mass of the associated galaxies better than the circular velocity atthe epoch of observation, v_max,now. the simulations and our model l-v_maxrelation predict the shape, amplitude, and luminosity dependence of thetwo-point correlation function in excellent agreement with the observed galaxyclustering in the sdss data at z~0 and in the deep2 samples at z~1 over theentire probed range of projected separations, 0.1&lt;r_p/(mpc/h)&lt;10.0. inparticular, the small-scale upturn of the correlation function from thepower-law form in the sdss and deep2 luminosity-selected samples is reproducedvery well. at z~3-5, our predictions also match the observed shape andamplitude of the angular two-point correlation function of lyman-break galaxies(lbgs) on both large and small scales, including the small-scale upturn.

astro-ph;0512416	the dependence of halo clustering on halo formation history,  concentration, and occupation	we investigate the dependence of dark matter halo clustering on haloformation time, density profile concentration, and subhalo occupation number,using high-resolution numerical simulations of a lcdm cosmology. we confirmresults that halo clustering is a function of halo formation time, and thatthis trend depends on halo mass. for the first time, we show unequivocally thathalo clustering is a function of halo concentration and show that thedependence of halo bias on concentration, mass, and redshift can be accuratelyparameterized in a simple way: b(c,m|z) = b(m|z) b(c|m/m*). the scaling betweenbias and concentration changes sign with the value of m/m*: high concentration(early forming) objects cluster more strongly for m &lt;~ m* while lowconcentration (late forming) objects cluster more strongly for rare high-masshalos, m &gt;~ m*. we show the first explicit demonstration that host dark haloclustering depends on the halo occupation number (of dark matter subhalos) anddiscuss implications for halo model calculations of dark matter power spectraand galaxy clustering statistics. the effect of these halo properties onclustering is strongest for early-forming dwarf-mass halos, which aresignificantly more clustered than typical halos of their mass. our resultssuggest that isolated low-mass galaxies (e.g. low surface-brightness dwarfs)should have more slowly-rising rotation curves than their clusteredcounterparts, and may have consequences for the dearth of dwarf galaxies invoids. they also imply that self calibrating richness-selected cluster sampleswith their clustering properties might overestimate cluster masses and biascosmological parameter estimation.

astro-ph;0604506	close galaxy counts as a probe of hierarchical structure formation	standard lcdm predicts that the major merger rate of galaxy-size dark matterhalos rises rapidly with redshift. the average number of close companions pergalaxy, nc, is often used to infer the galaxy merger rate, however, recentobservational studies suggest that nc evolves very little with redshift. herewe use a "hybrid" n- body simulation plus analytic substructure model topredict nc directly. we identify dark matter subhalos with galaxies and showthat the observed lack of close pair count evolution arises because the highmerger rate per halo at early times is counteracted by a decrease in the numberof halos massive enough to host a galaxy pair. we compare our results to datacompiled from the deep2, ssrs2, and the uzc redshift surveys. observed paircounts match our predictions if we assume a monotonic mapping between galaxyluminosity and the maximum circular velocity that each subhalo had when it wasfirst accreted onto its host halo. this suggests that satellite galaxies aresignificantly more resilient to destruction than are dissipationless darkmatter subhalos. we argue that while nc does not provide a direct measure ofthe halo merger rate, it offers a powerful means to constrain the halooccupation distribution and the spatial distribution of galaxies within halos.interpreted in this way, close pair counts provide a useful test of galaxyformation processes on &lt; 100 kpc scales.

astro-ph;9806263	the nature of lyman-break galaxies	using semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, we investigate the propertiesof $z\sim3$ galaxies and compare them with the observed population oflyman-break galaxies (lbgs). in addition to the usual quiescent mode of starformation, we introduce a physical model for starbursts triggered bygalaxy-galaxy interactions. we find that with the merger rate that arisesnaturally in the cdm-based merging hierarchy, a significant fraction of brightgalaxies identified at high redshift ($z \ga 2$) are likely to be low-mass,bursting satellite galaxies. the abundance of lbgs as a function of redshiftand the luminosity function of lbgs both appear to be in better agreement withthe data when the starburst mode is included, especially when effects of dustextinction are considered. the objects that we identify as lbgs have observableproperties including low velocity dispersions that are in good agreement withthe available data. in this ``bursting satellite'' scenario, quiescent starformation at $z\ga2$ is relatively inefficient and most of the observed lbgsare starbursts triggered by satellite mergers within massive halos. inhigh-resolution n-body simulations, we find that the most massive dark matterhalos cluster at redshift $z\sim 3$ much as the lbgs are observed to do. thisis true for both the $\omega=1$ chdm model and low-$\omega$ \lcdm and ocdmmodels, all of which have fluctuation power spectra $p(k)$ consistent with thedistribution of low-redshift galaxies. the bursting satellite scenario canresolve the apparent paradox of lbgs that cluster like massive dark matterhalos but have narrow linewidths and small stellar masses.

0812.3405	connecting reionization to the local universe	we present results of combined n-body and three-dimensional reionizationcalculations to determine the relationship between reionization history andlocal environment in a volume 1 gpc/h across and a resolution of about 1 mpc.we resolve the formation of about 2x10^6 halos of mass greater than ~10^12 msunat z=0, allowing us to determine the relationship between halo mass andreionization epoch for galaxies and clusters. for our fiducial reionizationmodel, in which reionization begins at z~15 and ends by z~6, we find a strongbias for cluster-size halos to be in the regions which reionized first, atredshifts 10&lt;z&lt;15. consequently, material in clusters was reionized withinrelatively small regions, on the order of a few mpc, implying that all clustersin our calculation were reionized by their own progenitors. milky way masshalos were on average reionized later and by larger regions, with adistribution similar to the global one, indicating that low mass halos arerelatively uncorrelated with reionization when only their mass is taken as aprior. on average, we find that most halos with mass less than 10^13 msun werereionized internally, while almost all halos with masses greater than 10^14msun were reionized by their own progenitors. we briefly discuss theimplications of this work in light of the "missing satellites" problem and howthis new approach may be extended further.
