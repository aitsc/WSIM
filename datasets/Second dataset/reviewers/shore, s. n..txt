0903.2049	sub-surface convection zones in hot massive stars and their observable  consequences	we study the convection zones in the outer envelope of hot massive starswhich are caused by opacity peaks associated with iron and helium ionization.we determine the occurrence and properties of these convection zones asfunction of the stellar parameters. we then confront our results withobservations of ob stars. a stellar evolution code is used to compute a grid ofmassive star models at different metallicities. in these models, the mixinglength theory is used to characterize the envelope convection zones. we findthe iron convection zone (fecz) to be more prominent for lower surface gravity,higher luminosity and higher initial metallicity. it is absent for luminositiesbelow about $10^{3.2}\lsun$, $10^{3.9}\lsun$, and $10^{4.2}$\lsun$ for thegalaxy, lmc and smc, respectively. we map the strength of the fecz on thehertzsprung-russell diagram for three metallicities, and compare this with theoccurrence of observational phenomena in o stars: microturbulence, non-radialpulsations, wind clumping, and line profile variability. the confirmation ofall three trends for the fecz as function of stellar parameters by empiricalmicroturbulent velocities argues for a physical connection betweensub-photospheric convective motions and small scale stochastic velocities inthe photosphere of o- and b-type stars. we further suggest that clumping in theinner parts of the winds of ob stars could be caused by the same mechanism, andthat magnetic fields produced in the fecz could appear at the surface of obstars as diagnosed by discrete absorption components in ultraviolet absorptionlines.

0909.3267	magic gamma-ray telescope observation of the perseus cluster of  galaxies: implications for cosmic rays, dark matter, and ngc1275	the perseus galaxy cluster was observed by the magic cherenkov telescope fora total effective time of 24.4 hr during 2008 november and december. theresulting upper limits on the gamma-ray emission above 100 gev are in the rangeof 4.6 to 7.5 x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} for spectral indices from -1.5 to -2.5,thereby constraining the emission produced by cosmic rays, dark matterannihilations, and the central radio galaxy ngc1275. results are compatiblewith cosmological cluster simulations for the cosmic-ray-induced gamma-rayemission, constraining the average cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure to &lt;4% forthe cluster core region (&lt;8% for the entire cluster). using simplifiedassumptions adopted in earlier work (a power-law spectrum with an index of-2.1, constant cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure for the peripheral clusterregions while accounting for the adiabatic contraction during the cooling flowformation), we would limit the ratio of cosmic ray-to-thermal energy toe_cr/e_th&lt;3%. the upper limit also translates into a level of gamma-rayemission from possible annihilations of the cluster dark matter (the dominantmass component) that is consistent with boost factors of ~10^4 for thetypically expected dark matter annihilation-induced emission. finally, theupper limits obtained for the gamma-ray emission of the central radio galaxyngc1275 are consistent with the recent detection by the fermi-lat satellite.due to the extremely large doppler factors required for the jet, a one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model is implausible in this case. we reproduce theobserved spectral energy density by using the structured jet (spine-layer)model which has previously been adopted to explain the high-energy emission ofradio galaxies.

0910.4381	correlated x-ray and very high energy emission in the gamma-ray binary  ls i +61 303	the discovery of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emitting x-ray binaries hastriggered an intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration,absorption, and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems, which providevariable conditions along eccentric orbits. despite this, the nature of some ofthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the vhe emission, isunclear. to answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelengthcampaign of the vhe gamma-ray emitting x-ray binary ls i +61 303 including themagic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007september. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and vhe bands, with thepeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linear fit to thesimultaneous x-ray/vhe pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlationcoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs providesr=0.81. since a variable absorption of the vhe emission towards the observer isnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates asimultaneity in the emission processes. assuming that they are dominated by asingle particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the x-ray/vhe fluxratio favors leptonic models. this fact, together with the detected photonindices, suggests that in ls i +61 303 the x-rays are the result of synchrotronradiation of the same electrons that produce vhe emission as a result ofinverse compton scattering of stellar photons.

1004.1093	search for an extended vhe gamma-ray emission from mrk 421 and mrk 501  with the magic telescope	context: part of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray radiation coming fromextragalactic sources is absorbed through the pair production process on theextragalactic background light photons. extragalactic magnetic fields alter thetrajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic backgroundphotons to gamma-ray energies by inverse compton scattering. these secondaryphotons can form an extended halo around bright vhe sources.  aims: we searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars mrk 421and mrk 501 using the magic telescope data.  methods: if extended emission is present, the angular distribution ofreconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader thanfor a point-like source. in the analysis of a few tens of hours ofobservational data taken from mrk 421 and mrk 501 we used a newly developedmethod that provides better angular resolution. this method is based on theusage of multidimensional decision trees. comparing the measured shapes ofangular distributions with those expected from a point-like source one candetect or constrain possible extended emission around the source. we alsostudied the influence of different types of systematic errors on the shape ofthe distribution of reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions for a pointsource.  results: we present upper limits for an extended emission calculated for bothsources for various source extensions and emission profiles. we discusspossible constraints on the extragalactic magnetic fields strength. we obtainupper limits on the extended emission around the mrk~421 (mrk~501) on the levelof &lt; 5% (&lt; 4%) of the crab nebula flux above the energy threshold of 300 gev.using these results we discuss possible constraints on the extragalacticmagnetic fields strength around a few times $10^{-15}$~g.

1004.3665	magic observation of the grb080430 afterglow	context: gamma-ray bursts are cosmological sources emitting radiation fromthe gamma-rays to the radio band. substantial observational efforts have beendevoted to the study of gamma-ray bursts during the prompt phase, i.e. theinitial burst of high-energy radiation, and during the long-lasting afterglows.in spite of many successes in interpreting these phenomena, there are stillseveral open key questions about the fundamental emission processes, theirenergetics and the environment. aim: independently of specific gamma-ray bursttheoretical recipes, spectra in the gev/tev range are predicted to beremarkably simple, being satisfactorily modeled with power-laws, and thereforeoffer a very valuable tool to probe the extragalactic background lightdistribution. furthermore, the simple detection of a component at very-highenergies, i.e. at $\sim 100$\,gev, would solve the ambiguity about theimportance of various possible emission processes, which provide barelydistinguishable scenarios at lower energies. methods: we used the results ofthe magic telescope observation of the moderate resdhift ($z\sim0.76$)\object{grb\,080430} at energies above about 80\,gev, to evaluate theperspective for late-afterglow observations with ground based gev/tevtelescopes. results: we obtained an upper limit of $f_{\rm 95%\,cl} = 5.5\times 10^{-11}$\,erg\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$ for the very-high energy emission of\object{grb\,080430}, which cannot set further constraints on the theoreticalscenarios proposed for this object also due to the difficulties in modeling thelow-energy afterglow. nonetheless, our observations show that cherenkovtelescopes have already reached the required sensitivity to detect the gev/tevemission of grbs at moderate redshift ($z \lesssim 0.8$), provided theobservations are carried out at early times, close to the onset of theirafterglow phase.

1005.0740	magic constraints on gamma-ray emission from cygnus x-3	cygnus x-3 is a microquasar consisting of an accreting compact objectorbiting around a wolf-rayet star. it has been detected at radio frequenciesand up to high-energy gamma rays (above 100 mev). however, many models alsopredict a very high energy (vhe) emission (above hundreds of gev) when thesource displays relativistic persistent jets or transient ejections. therefore,detecting such emission would improve the understanding of the jet physics. theimaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope magic observed cygnus x-3 for about 70hours between 2006 march and 2009 august in different x-ray/radio spectralstates and also during a period of enhanced gamma-ray emission. magic found noevidence for a vhe signal from the direction of the microquasar. an upper limitto the integral flux for energies higher than 250 gev has been set to 2.2 x10-12 photons cm-2 s-1 (95% confidence level). this is the best limit so far tothe vhe emission from this source. the non-detection of a vhe signal during theperiod of activity in the high-energy band sheds light on the location of thepossible vhe radiation favoring the emission from the innermost region of thejets, where absorption is significant. the current and future generations ofcherenkov telescopes may detect a signal under precise spectral conditions.

1108.5391	observations of the crab pulsar between 25 gev and 100 gev with the  magic i telescope	we report on the observation of $\gamma$-rays above 25\,gev from the crabpulsar (psr b0532+21) using the magic i telescope. two data sets fromobservations during the winter period 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 are used. inorder to discuss the spectral shape from 100\,mev to 100\,gev, one year ofpublic {\it fermi} large area telescope ({\it fermi}-lat) data are alsoanalyzed to complement the magic data. the extrapolation of the exponentialcutoff spectrum determined with the fermi-lat data is inconsistent with magicmeasurements, which requires a modification of the standard pulsar emissionmodels. in the energy region between 25 and 100\,gev, the emission in the p1phase (from -0.06 to 0.04, location of the main pulse) and the p2 phase (from0.32 to 0.43, location of the interpulse) can be described by power laws withspectral indices of $-3.1 \pm 1.0_{stat} \pm 0.3_{syst}$ and $-3.5 \pm0.5_{stat} \pm 0.3_{syst}$, respectively. assuming an asymmetric lorentzian forthe pulse shape, the peak positions of the main pulse and the interpulse areestimated to be at phases $-0.009 \pm 0.007$ and $0.393 \pm 0.009$, while thefull widths at half maximum are $0.025 \pm 0.008$ and $0.053 \pm 0.015$,respectively.

1111.5544	constraining cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the perseus galaxy  cluster with tev observations by the magic telescopes	galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase ofhierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks thatcontribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (crs). hence,clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act asenergy reservoirs for additional cr sources, such as active galactic nuclei andsupernova-driven galactic winds. to detect the gamma-ray emission from crinteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to dateobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energygamma-rays and observed the perseus cluster with the magic cherenkov telescopesfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. this campaign resulted inthe detection of the central radio galaxy ngc 1275 at energies e &gt; 100 gev witha very steep energy spectrum. here, we restrict our analysis to energies e &gt;630 gev and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. this constrains the averagecr-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and themodel for cr emission. comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictionsfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include crs constrains the maximumcr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible cr transport processes such ascr streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. finally, we derivelower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the perseus radiomini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created inhadronic cr interactions: assuming a spectrum of e^-2.2 around tev energies asimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9microg, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength towardlarger radii.

1305.5147	rapid and multi-band variability of the tev-bright active nucleus of the  galaxy ic 310	context. the radio galaxy ic 310 has recently been identified as a gamma-rayemitter based on observations at gev energies with fermi-lat and at very highenergies (vhe, e&gt;100gev) with the magic telescopes. originally classified as ahead-tail radio galaxy, the nature of this object is subject of controversysince its nucleus shows blazar-like behavior. aims. in order to understand thenature of ic 310 and the origin of the vhe emission we studied the spectral andflux variability of ic 310 from the x-ray band to the vhe gamma-ray regime.methods. the light curve of ic 310 above 300gev has been measured with themagic telescopes from oct. 2009 to feb. 2010. fermi-lat data (2008-2011) in the10-500gev energy range were also analyzed. in x-ray, archival observations from2003 to 2007 with xmm, chandra, and swift-xrt in the 0.5-10kev band werestudied. results. the vhe light curve reveals several high-amplitude andshort-duration flares. day-to-day flux variability is clearly present. thephoton index between 120gev and 8tev remains at the value $\gamma\sim2.0$during both low and high flux states. the vhe spectral shape does not showsignificant variability, whereas the flux at 1tev changes by a factor of$\sim7$. fermi-lat detected only eight gamma-ray events in the energy range10gev-500gev in three years of observation. the measured photon index of$\gamma=1.3\pm0.5$ in the fermi-lat range is very hard. the x-ray measurementsshow strong variability in flux and photon index. the latter varied from$1.76\pm0.07$ to $2.55\pm0.07$. conclusion. the rapid variability measuredconfirms the blazar-like behavior of ic 310. the tev emission seems tooriginate from scales of less than 80 schwarzschild radii within the compactcore of its fri radio jet with orientation angle 10deg-38deg. the sed resemblesthat of an extreme blazar, albeit the luminosity is more than two orders ofmagnitude lower.

0705.0701	the early spectrophotometric evolution of v1186 scorpii (nova scorpii  2004 #1)	we report optical photometry and optical through mid-infrared spectroscopy ofthe classical nova v1186 sco. this slowly developing nova had an complex lightcurve with multiple secondary peaks similar to those seen in pw vul. the timeto decline 2 magnitudes, t$_2$, was 20 days but the erratic nature of the lightcurve makes determination of intrinsic properties based on the decline time(e.g., luminosity) problematic, and the often cited mmrd relationship of dellavalle and livio (1995) fails to yield a plausible distance. spectra covering0.35 to 35 $\mu$m were obtained in two separate epochs during the first year ofoutburst. the first set of spectra, taken about 2 months after visible maximum,are typical of a co-type nova with narrow line emission from \ion{h}{1},\ion{fe}{2}, \ion{o}{1} and \ion{he}{1}. later data, obtained between 260 and380 days after maximum, reveal an emerging nebular spectrum. \textit{spitzer}spectra show weakening hydrogen recombination emission with the emergence of[\ion{ne}{2}] (12.81 $\mu$m) as the strongest line. strong emission from[\ion{ne}{3}] (15.56 $\mu$m) is also detected. photoionization models with loweffective temperature sources and only marginal neon enhancement (ne $\sim$ 1.3ne$_{\odot}$) are consistent with these ir fine-structure neon lines indicatingthat v1186 sco did not occur on a onemg white dwarf. in contrast, the slow anderratic light curve evolution, spectral development, and photoionizationanalysis of the ejecta imply the outburst occurred on a low mass co whitedwarf. we note that this is the first time strong [\ion{ne}{2}] lines have beendetected so early in the outburst of a co nova and suggests that the presenceof mid-infrared neon lines is not directly indicative of a onemg nova event.

1310.8500	contemporaneous observations of the radio galaxy ngc 1275 from radio to  very high energy gamma-rays	the radio galaxy ngc 1275, recently identified as a very high energy (vhe,&gt;100 gev) gamma-ray emitter by magic, is one of the few non-blazar agn detectedin the vhe regime. in order to better understand the origin of the gamma-rayemission and locate it within the galaxy, we studied contemporaneousmulti-frequency observations of ngc 1275 and modeled the overall spectralenergy distribution (sed). we analyzed unpublished magic observations carriedout between oct. 2009 and feb. 2010, and the previously published ones takenbetween aug. 2010 and feb. 2011. we studied the multi-band variability andcorrelations by analyzing data of fermi-lat (0.1-100 gev), as well as chandra(x-ray), kva (optical) and mojave (radio) data taken during the same period.using customized monte carlo simulations corresponding to early magic stereodata, we detect ngc 1275 also in the earlier campaign. the flux level andenergy spectra are similar to the results of the second campaign. the monthlylight curve &gt;100 gev shows a hint of variability at the 3.6 sigma level. in thefermi-lat band, both flux and spectral shape variabilities are reported. theoptical light curve is variable and shows a clear correlation with thegamma-ray flux &gt;100 mev. in radio, 3 compact components are resolved in theinnermost part of the jet. one of them shows a similar trend as the lat and kvalight curves. the 0.1-650 gev spectra measured simultaneously with magic andfermi-lat can be well fitted either by a log-parabola or by a power-law with asub-exponential cutoff for both campaigns. a single-zonesynchrotron-self-compton model, with an electron spectrum following a power-lawwith an exponential cutoff, can explain the broadband sed and the multi-bandbehavior of the source. however, this model suggests an untypical lowbulk-lorentz factor or a velocity alignment closer to the line of sight thanthe pc-scale radio jet.

1311.2833	magic observations and multifrequency properties of the flat spectrum  radio quasar 3c 279 in 2011	we study the multifrequency emission and spectral properties of the quasar 3c279. we observed 3c 279 in very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) gamma rays, withthe magic telescopes during 2011, for the first time in stereoscopic mode. wecombine these measurements with observations at other energy bands: in highenergy (he, e&gt;100mev) gamma rays from fermi-lat, in x-rays from rxte, in theoptical from the kva telescope and in the radio at 43ghz, 37ghz and 15ghz fromthe vlba, mets\"ahovi and ovro radio telescopes and optical polarisationmeasurements from the kva and liverpool telescopes. during the magicobservations (february to april 2011) 3c 279 was in a low state in optical,x-ray and gamma rays. the magic observations did not yield a significantdetection. these upper limits are in agreement with the extrapolation of the hegamma-ray spectrum, corrected for extragalactic background light absorption,from fermi-lat. the second part of the magic observations in 2011 was triggeredby a high activity state in the optical and gamma-ray bands. during the opticaloutburst the optical electric vector position angle rotatated of about 180degrees. there was no simultaneous rotation of the 43ghz radio polarisationangle. no vhe gamma rays were detected by magic, and the derived upper limitssuggest the presence of a spectral break or curvature between the fermi-lat andmagic bands. the combined upper limits are the strongest derived to date forthe source at vhe and below the level of the previously detected flux by afactor 2. radiation models that include synchrotron and inverse comptonemissions match the optical to gamma-ray data, assuming an emission componentinside the broad line region (blr) responsible for the high-energy emission andone outside the blr and the infrared torus causing optical and low-energyemission. we interpreted the optical polarisation with a bent trajectory model.

1311.3637	magic upper limits on the grb 090102 afterglow	indications of a gev component in the emission from grbs are known since theegret observations during the 1990's and they have been confirmed by the dataof the fermi satellite. these results have, however, shown that ourunderstanding of grb physics is still unsatisfactory. the new generation ofcherenkov observatories and in particular the magic telescope, allow for thefirst time the possibility to extend the measurement of grbs from several tensup to hundreds of gev energy range. both leptonic and hadronic processes havebeen suggested to explain the possible gev/tev counterpart of grbs.observations with ground-based telescopes of very high energy photons (e&gt;30gev) from these sources are going to play a key role in discriminating amongthe different proposed emission mechanisms, which are barely distinguishable atlower energies. magic telescope observations of the grb 090102 (z=1.547) fieldand fermi large area telescope (lat) data in the same time interval areanalysed to derive upper limits of the gev/tev emission. we compare theseresults to the expected emissions evaluated for different processes in theframework of a relativistic blast wave model for the afterglow. simultaneousupper limits with fermi and a cherenkov telescope have been derived for thisgrb observation. the results we obtained are compatible with the expectedemission although the difficulties in predicting the he and vhe emission forthe afterglow of this event makes it difficult to draw firmer conclusions.nonetheless, magic sensitivity in the energy range of overlap with space-basedinstruments (above about 40 gev) is about one order of magnitude better withrespect to fermi. this makes evident the constraining power of ground-basedobservations and shows that the magic telescope has reached the requiredperformance to make possible grb multiwavelength studies in the very highenergy range.

1401.0464	magic long-term study of the distant tev blazar pks 1424+240 in a  multiwavelength context	we present a study of the very high energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-rayemission of the blazar pks 1424+240 observed with the magic telescopes. theprimary aim of this paper is the multiwavelength spectral characterization andmodeling of this blazar, which is made particularly interesting by the recentdiscovery of a lower limit of its redshift of z &gt; 0.6 and makes it a promisingcandidate to be the most distant vhe source. the source has been observed withthe magic telescopes in vhe gamma rays for a total observation time of ~33.6 hfrom 2009 to 2011. the source was marginally detected in vhe gamma rays during2009 and 2010, and later, the detection was confirmed during an opticaloutburst in 2011. the combined significance of the stacked sample is ~7.2sigma. the differential spectra measured during the different campaigns can bedescribed by steep power laws with the indices ranging from 3.5 +/- 1.2 to 5.0+/- 1.7. the magic spectra corrected for the absorption due to theextragalactic background light connect smoothly, within systematic errors, withthe mean spectrum in 2009-2011 observed at lower energies by the fermi-lat. theabsorption-corrected magic spectrum is flat with no apparent turn down up to400 gev. the multiwavelength light curve shows increasing flux in radio andoptical bands that could point to a common origin from the same region of thejet. the large separation between the two peaks of the constructednon-simultaneous spectral energy distribution also requires an extremely highdoppler factor if an one zone synchrotron self-compton model is applied. wefind that a two-component synchrotron self-compton model describes the spectralenergy distribution of the source well, if the source is located at z~0.6.

1401.5646	magic gamma-ray and multifrequency observations of flat spectrum radio  quasar pks 1510-089 in early 2012	among more than fifty blazars detected in very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev)gamma-rays, only three belong to the subclass of flat spectrum radio quasars(fsrqs). magic observed fsrq pks 1510-089 in february-april 2012 during a highactivity state in the high energy (he, e&gt;100 mev) gamma-ray band observed byagile and fermi. magic observations result in the detection of a source withsignificance of 6.0 sigma. in agreement with the previous vhe observations ofthe source, we find no statistically significant variability during the magicobservations in daily, weekly or monthly time scales. the other two known vhefsrqs have shown daily scale to sub-hour variability.  we study the multifrequency behaviour of the source at the epoch of magicobservation, collecting quasi-simultaneous data at radio and optical (gasp-webtand f-gamma collaborations, rem, steward, perkins, liverpool, ovro and vlbatelescopes), x-ray (swift satellite) and he gamma-ray frequencies. thegamma-ray sed combining agile, fermi and magic data joins smoothly and shows nohint of a break. the multifrequency light curves suggest a common origin forthe millimeter radio and he gamma-ray emission and the he gamma-ray flaringstarts when the new component is ejected from the 43ghz vlba core. thequasi-simultaneous multifrequency sed is modelled with a one-zone inversecompton model. we study two different origins of the seed photons for theinverse compton scattering, namely the infra-red torus and a slow sheathsurrounding the jet around the vlba core. both models fit the data well.however, the fast he gamma-ray variability requires that within the modelledlarge emitting region, there must exist more compact regions. we suggest thatthese observed signatures would be most naturally explained by a turbulentplasma flowing at a relativistic speed down the jet and crossing a standingconical shock.

1405.6074	discovery of tev gamma-ray emission from the pulsar wind nebula 3c 58 by  magic	the pulsar wind nebula (pwn) 3c 58 is one of the historical very-high-energy(vhe; e&gt;100 gev) gamma-ray source candidates. it is energized by one of thehighest spin-down power pulsars known (5% of crab pulsar) and it has beencompared to the crab nebula due to their morphological similarities. thisobject was previously observed by imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes(whipple, veritas and magic), although not detected, with an upper limit of2.4% crab unit (c.u.) at vhe. it was detected by fermi-lat with a spectrumextending beyond 100 gev. we analyzed 81 hours of 3c 58 data taken with themagic telescopes and we detected vhe gamma-ray emission with a significance of5.7 sigma and an integral flux of 0.65% c.u. above 1 tev. the differentialenergy spectrum between 400 gev and 10 tev is well described by a power-lawfunction d\phi/de=f_0(e/1tev)^{-gamma} withf_0=(2.0\pm0.4_{stat}\pm0.6_{sys})\times10^{-13}cm^{-2}s^{-1}tev^{-1} andgamma=2.4\pm0.2_{stat}\pm0.2_{sys}. the skymap is compatible with an unresolvedsource. we report the first significant detection of pwn 3c 58 at tev energies.according to our results 3c 58 is the least luminous vhe gamma-ray pwn everdetected at vhe and the one with the lowest flux at vhe to date. we compare ourresults with the expectations of time-dependent models in which electronsup-scatter photon fields. the best representation favors a distance to the pwnof 2 kpc and far infrared (fir) comparable to cmb photon fields. if we consideran unexpectedly high fir density, the data can also be reproduced by modelsassuming a 3.2 kpc distance. a low magnetic field, far from equipartition, isrequired to explain the vhe data. hadronic contribution from the hostingsupernova remnant (snr) requires unrealistic energy budget given the density ofthe medium, disfavoring cosmic ray acceleration in the snr as origin of the vhegamma-ray emission.

1406.6892	measurement of the crab nebula spectrum over three decades in energy  with the magic telescopes	the magic stereoscopic system collected 69 hours of crab nebula data betweenoctober 2009 and april 2011. analysis of this data sample using the latestimprovements in the magic stereoscopic software provided an unprecedentedprecision of spectral and night-by-night light curve determination at gammarays. we derived a differential spectrum with a single instrument from 50 gevup to almost 30 tev with 5 bins per energy decade. at low energies, magicresults, combined with fermi-lat data, show a flat and broad inverse comptonpeak. the overall fit to the data between 1 gev and 30 tev is not welldescribed by a log-parabola function. we find that a modified log-parabolafunction with an exponent of 2.5 instead of 2 provides a good description ofthe data ($\chi^2=35/26$). using systematic uncertainties of red the magic andfermi-lat measurements we determine the position of the inverse compton peak tobe at (53 $\pm$ 3stat + 31syst -13syst) gev, which is the most preciseestimation up to date and is dominated by the systematic effects. there is nohint of the integral flux variability on daily scales at energies above 300 gevwhen systematic uncertainties are included in the flux measurement. we considerthree state- of-the-art theoretical models to describe the overall spectralenergy distribution of the crab nebula. the constant b-field model cannotsatisfactorily reproduce the vhe spectral measurements presented in this work,having particular difficulty reproducing the broadness of the observed ic peak.most probably this implies that the assumption of the homogeneity of themagnetic field inside the nebula is incorrect. on the other hand, thetime-dependent 1d spectral model provides a good fit of the new vhe resultswhen considering a 80 {\mu}g magnetic field. however, it fails to match thedata when including the morphology of the nebula at lower wavelengths.

1410.7059	discovery of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the blazar 1es  0033+595 by the magic telescopes	the number of known very high energy (vhe) blazars is $\sim\,50$, which isvery small in comparison to the number of blazars detected in otherfrequencies. this situation is a handicap for population studies of blazars,which emit about half of their luminosity in the $\gamma$-ray domain. moreover,vhe blazars, if distant, allow for the study of the environment that thehigh-energy $\gamma$-rays traverse in their path towards the earth, like theextragalactic background light (ebl) and the intergalactic magnetic field(igmf), and hence they have a special interest for the astrophysics community.we present the first vhe detection of 1es\,0033+595 with a statisticalsignificance of 5.5\,$\sigma$. the vhe emission of this object is constantthroughout the magic observations (2009 august and october), and can beparameterized with a power law with an integral flux above 150 gev of$(7.1\pm1.3)\times 10^{-12} {\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}}$ and a photon indexof ($3.8\pm0.7$). we model its spectral energy distribution (sed) as the resultof inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons. for the study of the sedwe used simultaneous optical r-band data from the kva telescope, archival x-raydata by \textit{swift} as well as \textit{integral}, and simultaneous highenergy (he, $300$\,mev~--~$10$\,gev) $\gamma$-ray data from the \textit{fermi}lat observatory. using the empirical approach of prandini et al.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1504.06115	magic detection of short-term variability of the high-peaked bl lac  object 1es 0806+524	the high-frequency-peaked bl lac (hbl) 1es 0806+524 (z = 0.138) wasdiscovered in vhe $\gamma$ rays in 2008. until now, the broad-band spectrum of1es 0806+524 has been only poorly characterized, in particular at highenergies. we analysed multiwavelength observations from $\gamma$ rays to radioperformed from 2011 january to march, which were triggered by the high activitydetected at optical frequencies. these observations constitute the most precisedetermination of the broad-band emission of 1es 0806+524 to date. thestereoscopic magic observations yielded a $\gamma$-ray signal above 250 gev of$(3.7 \pm 0.7)$ per cent of the crab nebula flux with a statisticalsignificance of 9.9 $\sigma$. the multiwavelength observations showedsignificant variability in essentially all energy bands, including a vhe$\gamma$-ray flare that lasted less than one night, which providedunprecedented evidence for short-term variability in 1es 0806+524. the spectrumof this flare is well described by a power law with a photon index of $2.97 \pm0.29$ between $\sim$150 gev and 1 tev and an integral flux of $(9.3 \pm 1.9)$per cent of the crab nebula flux above 250 gev. the spectrum during thenon-flaring vhe activity is compatible with the only available vhe observationperformed in 2008 with veritas when the source was in a low optical state. thebroad-band spectral energy distribution can be described with a one-zonesynchrotron self compton model with parameters typical for hbls, indicatingthat 1es 0806+524 is not substantially different from the hbls previouslydetected.

1509.04004	swift detection of the super-swift switch-on of the super-soft phase in  nova v745 sco (2014)	v745 sco is a recurrent nova, with the most recent eruption occurring infebruary 2014. v745 sco was first observed by swift a mere 3.7 hr after theannouncement of the optical discovery, with the super-soft x-ray emission beingdetected around four days later and lasting for only ~two days, making it boththe fastest follow-up of a nova by swift and the earliest switch-on ofsuper-soft emission yet detected. such an early switch-on time suggests acombination of a very high velocity outflow and low ejected mass and, togetherwith the high effective temperature reached by the super-soft emission, a highmass white dwarf (&gt;1.3 m_sun). the x-ray spectral evolution was followed froman early epoch where shocked emission was evident, through the entirety of thesuper-soft phase, showing evolving column density, emission lines, absorptionedges and thermal continuum temperature. uv grism data were also obtainedthroughout the super-soft interval, with the spectra showing mainly emissionlines from lower ionization transitions and the balmer continuum in emission.v745 sco is compared with both v2491 cyg (another nova with a very shortsuper-soft phase) and m31n 2008-12a (the most rapidly recurring nova yetdiscovered). the longer recurrence time compared to m31n 2008-12a could be dueto a lower mass accretion rate, although inclination of the system may alsoplay a part. nova v745 sco (2014) revealed the fastest evolving super-softsource phase yet discovered, providing a detailed and informative dataset forstudy.

1509.04936	first nustar observations of mrk 501 within a radio to tev  multi-instrument campaign	we report on simultaneous broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazarmarkarian 501 between 1 april and 10 august 2013, including the first detailedcharacterization of the synchrotron peak with swift and nustar. during thecampaign, the nearby bl lac object was observed in both a quiescent and anelevated state. the broadband campaign includes observations with nustar,magic, veritas, the fermi large area telescope (lat), swift x-ray telescope anduv optical telescope, various ground-based optical instruments, including thegasp-webt program, as well as radio observations by ovro, mets\"ahovi and thef-gamma consortium. some of the magic observations were affected by a sandlayer from the saharan desert, and had to be corrected using event-by-eventcorrections derived with a lidar (light detection and ranging) facility. thisis the first time that lidar information is used to produce a physics resultwith cherenkov telescope data taken during adverse atmospheric conditions, andhence sets a precedent for the current and future ground-based gamma-rayinstruments. the nustar instrument provides unprecedented sensitivity in hardx-rays, showing the source to display a spectral energy distribution between 3and 79 kev consistent with a log-parabolic spectrum and hard x-ray variabilityon hour timescales. none (of the four extended nustar observations) showsevidence of the onset of inverse-compton emission at hard x-ray energies. weapply a single-zone equilibrium synchrotron self-compton model to fivesimultaneous broadband spectral energy distributions. we find that thesynchrotron self-compton model can reproduce the observed broadband statesthrough a decrease in the magnetic field strength coinciding with an increasein the luminosity and hardness of the relativistic leptons responsible for thehigh-energy emission.

1510.07048	teraelectronvolt pulsed emission from the crab pulsar detected by magic	aims: to investigate the extension of the very-high-energy spectral tail ofthe crab pulsar at energies above 400 gev. methods: we analyzed $\sim$320 hoursof good quality data of crab with the magic telescope, obtained from february2007 until april 2014. results: we report the most energetic pulsed emissionever detected from the crab pulsar reaching up to 1.5 tev. the pulse profileshows two narrow peaks synchronized with the ones measured in the gev energyrange. the spectra of the two peaks follow two different power-law functionsfrom 70 gev up to 1.5 tev and connect smoothly with the spectra measured above10 gev by the large area telescope (lat) on board of the fermi satellite. whenmaking a joint fit of the lat and magic data, above 10 gev, the photon indicesof the spectra differ by 0.5$\pm$0.1. conclusions: we measured with the magictelescopes the most energetic pulsed photons from a pulsar to date. such tevpulsed photons require a parent population of electrons with a lorentz factorof at least $5\times 10^6$. these results strongly suggest ic scattering offlow energy photons as the emission mechanism and a gamma-ray production regionin the vicinity of the light cylinder.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.

astro-ph;0301415	the early ultraviolet evolution of the onemg nova v382 velorum 1999	we present a multiwavelength study of the onemg galactic nova v382 velorum1999 using hst/stis and fuse ultraviolet spectra and comparisons with publishedgroundbased optical spectra. we find a close match to the basic phenomenologyof another well-studied onemg nova, v1974 cygni (nova cygni 1992), inparticular to the spectral development through the start of the nebular phase.following an ``iron curtain'' phase, the nova proceeded through a stage of pcygni line profiles on all important resonance lines, as in many onemg novaeand unlike the co class. emergent emission lines displayed considerablestructure, as seen in v1974 cyg, indicating fragmentation of the ejecta at theearliest stages of the outburst. analysis and modeling of our ultravioletspectra suggest that 4 - 5 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$m$_{\odot}$ of material wasejected and that the distance to the nova is $\simeq 2.5$ kpc. relative tosolar values, we find the following abundances: he = 1.0, c = 0.6$\pm$0.3, n =17$\pm$4, o = 3.4$\pm$0.3, ne = 17$\pm$3, mg = 2.6$\pm$0.1, al = 21$\pm$2, andsi = 0.5$\pm$0.3. finally, we briefly draw comparisons with nova lmc 2000,another onemg nova, for which similar data were obtained with hst and fuse.

astro-ph;0502221	stochastic processes, galactic star formation, and chemical evolution.  effects of accretion, stripping, and collisions in multiphase multi-zone  models	this paper reports simulations allowing for stochastic accretion and massloss within closed and open systems modeled using a previously developedmulti-population, multi-zone (halo, thick disk, thin disk) treatment. the starformation rate is computed as a function of time directly from the modelequations and all chemical evolution is followed without instantaneousrecycling. several types of simulations are presented here: (1) a closed systemwith bursty mass loss from the halo to the thick disk, and from the thick tothe thin disk, in separate events to the thin disk; (2) open systems withrandom environmental (extragalactic) accretion, e.g. by infall of high velocityclouds directly to the thin disk; (3) schematic open system single and multiplecollision events and intracluster stripping. for the open models, the mass ofthe galaxy has been explicitly tracked with time. we present the evolution ofthe star formation rate, metallicity histories, and concentrate on the lightelements. we find a wide range of possible outcomes, including an explanationfor variations in the galactic d/h ratio, and highlight the problems foruniquely reconstructing star forming histories from contemporary abundancemeasurements.

astro-ph;0505244	evidence for a weak galactic center magnetic field from diffuse low  frequency nonthermal radio emission	new low-frequency 74 and 330 mhz observations of the galactic center (gc)region reveal the presence of a large-scale ($6\arcdeg\times 2\arcdeg$) diffusesource of nonthermal synchrotron emission. a minimum energy analysis of thisemission yields a total energy of $\sim (\phi^{4/7}f^{3/7})\times 10^{52}$ ergsand a magnetic field strength of $\sim 6(\phi/f)^{2/7}$ \mug (where $\phi$ isthe proton to electron energy ratio and $f$ is the filling factor of thesynchrotron emitting gas). the equipartition particle energy density is$1.2(\phi/f)^{2/7}$ \evcm, a value consistent with cosmic-ray data. however,the derived magnetic field is several orders of magnitude below the 1 mg fieldcommonly invoked for the gc. with this field the source can be maintained withthe sn rate inferred from the gc star formation. furthermore, a strong magneticfield implies an abnormally low gc cosmic-ray energy density. we conclude thatthe mean magnetic field in the gc region must be weak, of order 10 \mug (atleast on size scales $\ga 125\arcsec$).

astro-ph;0608654	recovering the star formation rate in the solar neighborhood	this paper develops a method for obtaining the star formation histories of amixed, resolved population through the use of color-magnitude diagrams (cmds).the method provides insight into the local star formation rate, analyzing theobservations of the hipparcos satellite through a comparison with syntheticcmds computed for different histories with an updated stellar evolutionlibrary. parallax and photometric uncertainties are included explicitly andcorrected using the bayesian richardson-lucy algorithm. we first describe ourverification studies using artificial data sets. from this sensitivity study,the critical factors determining the success of a recovery for a known starformation rate are a partial knowledge of the imf and the age-metallicityrelation, and sample contamination by clusters and moving groups (specialpopulations whose histories are different than that of the whole sample).unresolved binaries are less important impediments. we highlight how theselimit the method. for the real field sample, complete to mv &lt; 3.5, we find thatthe solar neighborhood star formation rate has a characteristic timescale forvariation of about 6 gyr, with a maximum activity close to 3 gyr ago. thesimilarity of this finding with column integrated star formation rates mayindicate a global origin, possibly a collision with a satellite galaxy. we alsodiscuss applications of this technique to general photometric surveys of othercomplex systems (e.g. local group dwarf galaxies) where the distances are wellknown.

astro-ph;9802031	a spherical non-lte line-blanketed stellar atmosphere model of the early  b giant epsilon cma	we use a spherical non-lte fully line blanketed model atmosphere to fit thefull multi-wavelength spectrum, including the extreme ultraviolet (euv)continuum observed by the {\it extreme ultraviolet explorer}, of the b2 ii star\epscma. the available spectrophotometry of \epscma\ from 350 \aa\ to 25\micron\ is best fit with model parameters \teff = 21750\,k, \logg = 3.5, andan angular diameter of 0.77 mas. the close agreement between the model and themeasured euv flux from \epscma\ is a result of the higher temperatures at theformation depths of the \ion{h}{1} and \ion{he}{1} lyman continua compared toother models. the realistic model treatment of early b giants with sphericalgeometry and nlte metal line blanketing results in the prediction ofsignificantly larger euv fluxes compared with plane-parallel models. we findthat our metal line blanketed spherical models show significantly warmertemperature structures, 1-3 kk at the formation depth of the lyman continua,and predict stronger euv fluxes, up to a factor of 5 in the \ion{h}{1} lymancontinuum, compared with plane-parallel atmospheres that have identical modelparameters. in contrast, we find spherical and plane-parallel models that donot include metal line blanketing are nearly identical. our \teff = 21000 k,\logg = 3.2, spherical nlte model predicts more than twice as many hydrogenionizing photons and over 200 times more neutral helium ionizing photons than astandard hydrostatic plane-parallel lte model with the same stellar parameters.

0811.4311	early evolution of newly born magnetars with a strong toroidal field	we present a state-of-the-art scenario for newly born magnetars as strongsources of gravitational waves (gws)in the early days after formation. weaddress several aspects of the astrophysics of rapidly rotating,ultramagnetized neutron stars (nss), including early cooling before transitionto superfluidity, the effects of the magnetic field on the equilibrium shape ofnss, the internal dynamical state of a fully degenerate, oblique rotator andthe strength of the electromagnetic torque on the newly born ns. we show thatour scenario is consistent with recent studies of snrs surrounding axps andsgrs in the galaxy that constrain the electromagnetic energy input from thecentral ns to be &lt;= 10^51 erg. we further show that if this condition is met,then the gw signal from such sources is potentially detectable with theforthcoming generation of gw detectors up to virgo cluster distances where anevent rate &lt;= 1/yr can be estimated. finally, we point out that the decay of aninternal magnetic field in the 10^16 g range couples strongly to the ns coolingat very early stages, thus significantly slowing down both processes: the fieldcan remain this strong for at least 10^3 yrs, during which the core temperaturestays higher than several times 10^8 k.
