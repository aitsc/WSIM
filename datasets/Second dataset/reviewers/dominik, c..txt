0902.3092	radiative transfer in very optically thick circumstellar disks	in this paper we present two efficient implementations of the diffusionapproximation to be employed in monte carlo computations of radiative transferin dusty media of massive circumstellar disks. the aim is to improve theaccuracy of the computed temperature structure and to decrease the computationtime. the accuracy, efficiency and applicability of the methods in variouscorners of parameter space are investigated. the effects of using these methodson the vertical structure of the circumstellar disk as obtained fromhydrostatic equilibrium computations are also addressed. two methods arepresented. first, an energy diffusion approximation is used to improve theaccuracy of the temperature structure in highly obscured regions of the disk,where photon counts are low. second, a modified random walk approximation isemployed to decrease the computation time. this modified random walk ensuresthat the photons that end up in the high-density regions can quickly escape tothe lower density regions, while the energy deposited by these photons in thedisk is still computed accurately. a new radiative transfer code, mcmax, ispresented in which both these diffusion approximations are implemented. thesecan be used simultaneously to increase both computational speed and decreasestatistical noise. we conclude that the diffusion approximations allow for fastand accurate computations of the temperature structure, vertical disk structureand observables of very optically thick circumstellar disks.

0906.1770	dust coagulation and fragmentation in molecular clouds. i. how  collisions between dust aggregates alter the dust size distribution	in dense molecular clouds collisions between dust grains alter the ism-dustsize distribution. we study this process by inserting the results from detailednumerical simulations of two colliding dust aggregates into a coagulation modelthat computes the dust size distribution with time. all collisional outcomes --sticking, fragmentation (shattering, breakage, and erosion) -- are included andthe effects on the internal structure of the aggregates are also tabulated. thedust aggregate evolution model is applied to an homogeneous and static cloud oftemperature 10 k and gas densities between 10^3 and 10^7 cm^-3. the coagulationis followed locally on timescales of ~10^7 yr. we find that the growth can bedivided into two stages: a growth dominated phase and a fragmentation dominatedphase. initially, the mass distribution is relatively narrow and shifts tolarger sizes with time. at a certain point, dependent on the materialproperties of the grains as well as on the gas density, collision velocitieswill become sufficiently energetic to fragment particles, halting the growthand replenishing particles of lower mass. eventually, a steady state isreached, where the mass distribution is characterized by a mass spectrum ofapproximately equal amount of mass per logarithmic size bin. the amount ofgrowth that is achieved depends on the cloud's lifetime. if clouds exist onfree-fall timescales the effects of coagulation on the dust size distributionare very minor. on the other hand, if clouds have long-term support mechanisms,the impact of coagulation is important, resulting in a significant decrease ofthe opacity on timescales longer than the initial collision timescale betweenbig grains.

0906.4718	analysis of the infrared spectra of the peculiar post-agb stars eplyr  and hd52961	aim: we aim to study in detail the peculiar mineralogy and structure of thecircumstellar environment of two binary post-agb stars, eplyr and hd52961. bothstars were selected from a larger sample of evolved disc sources observed withspitzer and show unique solid-state and gas features in their infrared spectra.moreover, they show a very small infrared excess in comparison with the othersample stars. methods: the different dust and gas species are identified on thebasis of high-resolution spitzer-irs spectra. we fit the full spectrum toconstrain grain sizes and temperature distributions in the discs. this,combined with our broad-band spectral energy distribution and interferometricmeasurements, allows us to study the physical structure of the disc, using aself-consistent 2d radiative-transfer disc model. results: we find that bothstars have strong emission features due to co_2 gas, dominated by^{12}c^{16}o_2, but with clear ^{13}c^{16}o_2 and even ^{16}o^{12}c^{18}oisotopic signatures. crystalline silicates are apparent in both sources butproved very hard to model. ep lyr also shows evidence of mixed chemistry, withemission features of the rare class-c pahs. whether these pahs reside in theoxygen-rich disc or in a carbon-rich outflow is still unclear. with thestrongly processed silicates, the mixed chemistry and the low ^{12}c/^{13}cratio, ep lyr resembles some silicate j-type stars, although the depletedphotosphere makes nucleosynthetic signatures difficult to probe. we find thatthe disc environment of both sources is, to a first approximation, wellmodelled with a passive disc, but additional physics such as grain settling,radial dust distributions, and an outflow component must be included to explainthe details of the observed spectral energy distributions in both stars.

0707.0489	an unbiased survey of 500 nearby stars for debris disks: a jcmt legacy  program	we present the scientific motivation and observing plan for an upcomingdetection survey for debris disks using the james clerk maxwell telescope. thescuba-2 unbiased nearby stars (suns) survey will observe 500 nearby mainsequence and sub-giant stars (100 of each of the a, f, g, k and m spectralclasses) to the 850 micron extragalactic confusion limit to search for evidenceof submillimeter excess, an indication of circumstellar material. the surveydistance boundaries are 8.6, 16.5, 22, 25 and 45 pc for m, k, g, f and a stars,respectively, and all targets lie between the declinations of -40 deg to 80deg. in this survey, no star will be rejected based on its inherent properties:binarity, presence of planetary companions, spectral type or age. this will bethe first unbiased survey for debris disks since iras. we expect to detect ~125debris disks, including ~50 cold disks not detectable in current shorterwavelength surveys. a substantial amount of complementary data will be requiredto constrain the temperatures and masses of discovered disks. high resolutionstudies will likely be required to resolve many of the disks. therefore, thesesystems will be the focus of future observational studies using a variety ofobservatories to characterize their physical properties. for non-detectedsystems, this survey will set constraints (upper limits) on the amount ofcircumstellar dust, of typically 200 times the kuiper belt mass, but as low as10 times the kuiper belt mass for the nearest stars in the sample(approximately 2 pc).

0909.3168	collisional evolution of dust aggregates. from compaction to  catastrophic destruction	the coagulation of dust aggregates occurs in various astrophysicalenvironments. each one is characterized by different conditions that influencethe growth, e.g. relative velocities, composition, and size of the smallestconstituents (monomers). here we study the microphysics of collisions of dustaggregates in a four-dimensional parameter space. the parameters are thecollision energy, the initial compactness of agglomerates, the mass ratio ofcollision partners, and the impact parameter. for this purpose we employ astate of the art molecular dynamics type of model that has been extensively andsuccessfully tested against laboratory experiments. it simulates the motion ofindividual monomers interacting dynamically via van der waals surface forces.the structure of aggregates is quantified by the filling factor that providesinformation about the internal structure, the packing density of monomers, andthe projected surface area of aggregates. our results show the importance ofthe impact parameter that causes formation of elongated particles, due totensile forces acting in offset collisions. we also describe in detail theinternal structure of the resulting aggregates.  our findings are summarized in the form of a simple collision recipe. therecipe specifies the outcome of a collision, averaged over the impactparameter. it is provided in tabular form for a range of physical parameterssuch as impact energy and pre-collision filling factor. the dependence on themass ratio of impactor and target is taken into account by providing both alocal and a global branch of the recipe.

1001.0516	the lunar phases of dust grains orbiting fomalhaut	optical images of the nearby star fomalhaut show a ring of dust orbiting thecentral star. this dust is in many respects expected to be similar to thezodiacal dust in the solar system. the ring displays a clear brightnessasymmetry, attributed to asymmetric scattering of the central starlight by thecircumstellar dust grains. recent measurements show that the bright side of thefomalhaut ring is oriented away from us. this implies that the grains in thissystem scatter most of the light in the backward direction, in sharp contrastto the forward-scattering nature of the grains in the solar system. in thisletter, we show that grains considerably larger than those dominating the solarsystem zodiacal dust cloud provide a natural explanation for the apparentbackward scattering behavior. in fact, we see the phases of the dust grains inthe same way as we can observe the phases of the moon and other large solarsystem bodies. we outline how the theory of the scattering behavior ofplanetesimals can be used to explain the fomalhaut dust properties. thisindicates that the fomalhaut dust ring is dominated by very large grains. thematerial orbiting fomalhaut, which is at the transition between dust andplanetesimals, can, with respect to their optical behavior, best be describedas micro-asteroids.

1004.2822	chemical study of intermediate-mass (im) class 0 protostars. co  depletion and n2h+ deuteration	we are carrying out a physical and chemical study of the protostellarenvelopes in a representative sample of im class 0 protostars. in our firstpaper (crimier et al. 2010), we determined the physical structure(density-temperature radial profiles) of the protostellar envelopes. here, westudy the co depletion and n2h+ deuteration. we observed the millimeter linesof c18o, c17o, n2h+ and n2d+ toward the protostars using the iram 30mtelescope. based on these observations, we derived the c18o, n2h+ and n2d+radial abundance profiles across their envelopes using a radiative transfercode. in addition, we modeled the chemistry of the protostellar envelopes. allthe c18o 1-0 maps are well fit assuming that the c18o abundance decreasesinwards within the protostellar envelope until the gas and dust reach the coevaporation temperature, 20-25k, where the co is released back to the gasphase. the n2h+ deuterium fractionation in class 0 ims is[n2d+]/[n2h+]=0.005-0.014, two orders of magnitude higher than the elemental[d/h] value in the interstellar medium, but a factor of 10 lower than inpre-stellar clumps. chemical models account for the c18o and n2h+ observationsif we assume the co abundance is 2 times lower than the canonical value in theinner envelope. this could be the consequence of the co being converted intoch3oh on the grain surfaces prior to the evaporation and/or thephotodissociation of co by the stellar uv radiation. the deuteriumfractionation is not fitted by chemical models. this discrepancy is very likelycaused by the simplicity of our model that assumes spherical geometry andneglects important phenomena like the effect of bipolar outflows and uvradiation from the star. more important, the deuterium fractionation isdependent on the ortho-to-para h2 ratio, which is not likely to reach thesteady-state value in the dynamical time scales of these protostars.

1005.4517	water cooling of shocks in protostellar outflows: herschel-pacs map of  l1157	in the framework of the water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish)key program, maps in water lines of several outflows from young stars are beingobtained, to study the water production in shocks and its role in the outflowcooling. this paper reports the first results of this program, presenting apacs map of the o-h2o 179 um transition obtained toward the young outflowl1157. the 179 um map is compared with those of other important shock tracers,and with previous single-pointing iso, swas, and odin water observations of thesame source that allow us to constrain the water abundance and total cooling.strong h2o peaks are localized on both shocked emission knots and the centralsource position. the h2o 179 um emission is spatially correlated with emissionfrom h2 rotational lines, excited in shocks leading to a significantenhancement of the water abundance. water emission peaks along the outflow alsocorrelate with peaks of other shock-produced molecular species, such as sio andnh3. a strong h2o peak is also observed at the location of the proto-star,where none of the other molecules have significant emission. the absolute 179um intensity and its intensity ratio to the h2o 557 ghz line previouslyobserved with odin/swas indicate that the water emission originates in warmcompact clumps, spatially unresolved by pacs, having a h2o abundance of theorder of 10^-4. this testifies that the clumps have been heated for a time longenough to allow the conversion of almost all the available gas-phase oxygeninto water. the total water cooling is ~10^-1 lo, about 40% of the cooling dueto h2 and 23% of the total energy released in shocks along the l1157 outflow.

1007.1235	discovery of water vapour in the carbon star v cygni from observations  with herschel/hifi	we report the discovery of water vapour toward the carbon star v cygni. wehave used herschel's hifi instrument, in dual beam switch mode, to observe the1(11) - 0(00) para-water transition at 1113.3430 ghz in the upper sideband ofthe band 4b receiver. the observed spectral line profile is nearly parabolic,but with a slight asymmetry associated with blueshifted absorption, and theintegrated antenna temperature is 1.69 \pm 0.17 k km/s. this detection ofthermal water vapour emission, carried out as part of a small survey of waterin carbon-rich stars, is only the second such detection toward a carbon-richagb star, the first having been obtained by the submillimeter wave astronomysatellite toward irc+10216. for an assumed ortho-to-para ratio of 3 for water,the observed line intensity implies a water outflow rate ~ (3 - 6) e-5 earthmasses per year and a water abundance relative to h2 of ~ (2-5) e-6. this valueis a factor of at least 1e+4 larger than the expected photospheric abundance ina carbon-rich environment, and - as in irc+10216 - raises the intriguingpossibility that the observed water is produced by the vapourisation oforbiting comets or dwarf planets. however, observations of the single lineobserved to date do not permit us to place strong constraints upon the spatialdistribution or origin of the observed water, but future observations ofadditional transitions will allow us to determine the inner radius of theh2o-emitting zone, and the h2o ortho-to-para ratio, and thereby to placeimportant constraints upon the origin of the observed water emission.

1007.1536	a hifi preview of warm molecular gas around chi cyg : first detection of  h2o emission toward an s-type agb star	a set of new, sensitive, and spectrally resolved, sub-millimeter lineobservations are used to probe the warm circumstellar gas around the s-type agbstar chi cyg. the observed lines involve high rotational quantum numbers,which, combined with previously obtained lower-frequency data, make it possibleto study in detail the chemical and physical properties of, essentially, theentire circumstellar envelope of chi cyg. the data were obtained using the hifiinstrument aboard herschel, whose high spectral resolution provides valuableinformation about the line profiles. detailed, non-lte, radiative transfermodelling, including dust radiative transfer coupled with a dynamical model,has been performed to derive the temperature, density, and velocity structureof the circumstellar envelope. we report the first detection of circumstellarh2o rotational emission lines in an s-star. using the high-j co lines to derivethe parameters for the circumstellar envelope, we modelled both the ortho- andpara-h2o lines. our modelling results are consistent with the velocitystructure expected for a dust-driven wind. the derived total h2o abundance(relative to h2) is (1.1 +/- 0.2)e-5, much lower than that in o-rich stars. thederived ortho-to-para ratio of 2.1 +/- 0.6 is close to the high-temperatureequilibrium limit, consistent with h2o being formed in the photosphere.

1106.3265	coagulation and fragmentation in molecular clouds. ii. the opacity of  the dust aggregate size distribution	the dust size distribution in molecular clouds can be strongly affected byice-mantle formation and (subsequent) grain coagulation. following previouswork where the dust size distribution has been calculated from a state-of-theart collision model for dust aggregates that involves both coagulation andfragmentation (paper i), the corresponding opacities are presented in thisstudy. the opacities are calculated by applying the effective medium theoryassuming that the dust aggregates are a mix of 0.1{\mu}m silicate and graphitegrains and vacuum. in particular, we explore how the coagulation affects thenear-ir opacities and the opacity in the 9.7{\mu}m silicate feature. we findthat as dust aggregates grow to {\mu}m-sizes both the near-ir color excess andthe opacity in the 9.7 {\mu}m feature increases. despite their coagulation,porous aggregates help to prolong the presence of the 9.7{\mu}m feature. wefind that the ratio between the opacity in the silicate feature and the near-ircolor excess becomes lower with respect to the ism, in accordance with manyobservations of dark clouds. however, this trend is primarily a result of icemantle formation and the mixed material composition of the aggregates, ratherthan being driven by coagulation. with stronger growth, when most of the dustmass resides in particles of size 10{\mu}m or larger, both the near-ir colorexcess and the 9.7{\mu}m silicate feature significantly diminish. observationsat additional wavelengths, in particular in the sub-mm range, are essential toprovide quantitative constraints on the dust size distribution within densecores. our results indicate that the sub-mm index {\beta} will increaseappreciably, if aggregates grow to ~100{\mu}m in size.

1304.1736	asymmetric transition disks: vorticity or eccentricity?	context. transition disks typically appear in resolved millimeterobservations as giant dust rings surrounding their young host stars. moreaccurate observations with alma have shown several of these rings to be in factasymmetric: they have lopsided shapes. it has been speculated that these ringsact as dust traps, which would make them important laboratories for studyingplanet formation. it has been shown that an elongated giant vortex produced ina disk with a strong viscosity jump strikingly resembles the observedasymmetric rings.  aims. we aim to study a similar behavior for a disk in which a giant planetis embedded. however, a giant planet can induce two kinds of asymmetries: (1) agiant vortex, and (2) an eccentric disk. we studied under which conditions eachof these can appear, and how one can observationally distinguish between them.this is important because only a vortex can trap particles both radially andazimuthally, while the eccentric ring can only trap particles in radialdirection.  methods. we used the fargo code to conduct the hydro-simulations. we set up adisk with an embedded giant planet and took a radial grid spanning from 0.1 to7 times the planet semi-major axis. we ran the simulations with variousviscosity values and planet masses for 1000 planet orbits to allow a fullydeveloped vortex or disk eccentricity. afterwards, we compared the dustdistribution in a vortex-holding disk with an eccentric disk using dustsimulations.  results. we find that vorticity and eccentricity are distinguishable bylooking at the azimuthal contrast of the dust density. while vortices, asparticle traps, produce very pronounced azimuthal asymmetries, eccentricfeatures are not able to accumulate millimeter dust particles in azimuthaldirection, and therefore the asymmetries are expected to be modest.

1304.6638	explaining millimeter-sized particles in brown dwarf disks	planets have been detected around a variety of stars, including low-massobjects, such as brown dwarfs. however, such extreme cases are challenging forplanet formation models. recent sub-millimeter observations of disks aroundbrown dwarf measured low spectral indices of the continuum emission thatsuggest that dust grains grow to mm-sizes even in these very low massenvironments. to understand the first steps of planet formation in scaled-downversions of t-tauri disks, we investigate the physical conditions that cantheoretically explain the growth from interstellar dust to millimeter-sizedgrains in disks around brown dwarf. we modeled the evolution of dust particlesunder conditions of low-mass disks around brown dwarfs. we used coagulation,fragmentation and disk-structure models to simulate the evolution of dust, withzero and non-zero radial drift. for the non-zero radial drift, we consideredstrong inhomogeneities in the gas surface density profile that mimic long-livedpressure bumps in the disk. we studied different scenarios that could lead toan agreement between theoretical models and the spectral slope found bymillimeter observations. we find that fragmentation is less likely and rapidinward drift is more significant for particles in brown dwarf disks than int-tauri disks. we present different scenarios that can nevertheless explainmillimeter-sized grains. as an example, a model that combines the followingparameters can fit the millimeter fluxes measured for brown dwarf disks: strongpressure inhomogeneities of $\sim$ 40% of amplitude, a small radial extent$\sim$ 15 au, a moderate turbulence strength $\alpha_{\mathrm{turb}}= 10^{-3}$,and average fragmentation velocities for ices $v_f = 10 m s^{-1}$.

1309.1039	imaging diagnostics for transitional discs	transitional discs are a special type of protoplanetary discs where planetformation is thought to be taking place. these objects feature characteristicinner cavities and/or gaps of a few tens of aus in the sub-millimitre images ofthe disc. this signature suggests a localised depletion of matter in the discthat could be caused by planet formation processes. however, recentobservations have revealed differences in the structures imaged at differentwavelengths in some of these discs. in this paper, we aim to explain theseobservational differences using self-consistent physical 2-d hydrodynamical anddust evolution models of such objects, assuming their morphology is indeedgenerated by the presence of a planet. we use these models to derive thedistribution of gas and dust in a theoretical planet-hosting disc, for variousplanet masses and orbital separations. we then simulate observations of theemitted and scattered light from these models with vlt/sphere zimpol,subaru/hiciao, vlt/visir and alma. we do this by first computing the fullresolution images of the models at different wavelengths, and then simulatingthe observations accounting for the characteristics of each particularinstrument. the presence of the planet generates pressure bumps in the gasdistribution of the disc whose characteristics strongly depend on the planetmass and position. these bumps cause large grains to accumulate while smallgrains are allowed into inner regions. this spatial differentiation of thegrain sizes explains the differences in the observations since differentwavelengths and observing techniques trace different parts of the dust sizedistribution. based on this effect, we conclude that the combination ofvisible/near-infrared polarimetric and sub-mm images is the best strategy toconstrain the properties of the unseen planet responsible for the discstructure.

0803.3897	probing the early evolution of young high-mass stars	near-infrared imaging surveys of high-mass star-forming regions reveal anamazingly complex interplay between star formation and the environment(churchwell et al. 2006; alvarez et al. 2004). by means of near-ir spectroscopythe embedded massive young stars can be characterized and placed in the contextof their birth site. however, so far spectroscopic surveys have been hopelesslyincomplete, hampering any systematic study of these very young massive stars.new integral field instrumentation available at eso has opened the possibilityto take a huge step forward by obtaining a full spectral inventory of theyoungest massive stellar populations in star-forming regions currentlyaccessible. simultaneously, the analysis of the extended emission allows thecharacterization of the environmental conditions. the formation and earlyevolution of massive stars (fems) collaboration aims at setting up a largeobserving campaign to obtain a full census of the stellar content, ionizedmaterial, outflows and pdr's over a sample of regions that covers a largeparameter space. complementary radio, mm and infrared observations will be usedfor the characterization of the deeply embedded population. for the first eightregions we have obtained 40 hours of sinfoni observations. in thiscontribution, we present the first results on three regions that illustrate thepotential of this strategy.

1410.3494	dusty tails of evaporating exoplanets. i. constraints on the dust  composition	recently, two exoplanet candidates have been discovered, kic 12557548b andkoi-2700b, whose transit profiles show evidence for a comet-like tail of dusttrailing the planet, thought to be fed by the evaporation of the planet'ssurface. we aim to put constraints on the composition of the dust ejected bythese objects from the shape of their transit light curves. we derive asemi-analytical expression for the attenuation of dust cross-section in thetail, incorporating the sublimation of dust grains as well as their drift awayfrom the planet. this expression shows that the length of the tail is highlysensitive to the sublimation properties of the dust material. we compute taillengths for several possible dust compositions, and compare these toobservational estimates of the tail lengths of kic 12557548b and koi-2700b,inferred from their light curves. the observed tail lengths are consistent withdust grains composed of corundum (al2o3) or iron-rich silicate minerals (e.g.,fayalite, fe2sio4). pure iron and carbonaceous compositions are disfavoured. inaddition, we estimate dust mass loss rates of 1.7 +/- 0.5 m_earth/gyr for kic12557548b, and &gt; 0.007 m_earth/gyr (1-sigma lower limit) for koi-2700b.

1505.05325	asymmetric features in the protoplanetary disk mwc758	the study of dynamical processes in protoplanetary disks is essential tounderstand planet formation. in this context, transition disks are primetargets because they are at an advanced stage of disk clearing and may harbordirect signatures of disk evolution. in this paper, we aim to derive newconstraints on the structure of the transition disk mwc 758, to detectnon-axisymmetric features and understand their origin. we obtained infraredpolarized intensity observations of the protoplanetary disk mwc 758 withsphere/vlt at 1.04 microns to resolve scattered light at a smaller innerworking angle (0.093") and a higher angular resolution (0.027") than previouslyachieved. we observe polarized scattered light within 0.53" (148 au) down tothe inner working angle (26 au) and detect distinct non-axisymmetric featuresbut no fully depleted cavity. the two small-scale spiral features that werepreviously detected with hiciao are resolved more clearly, and new features areidentified, including two that are located at previously inaccessible radiiclose to the star. we present a model based on the spiral density wave theorywith two planetary companions in circular orbits. the best model requires ahigh disk aspect ratio (h/r~0.20 at the planet locations) to account for thelarge pitch angles which implies a very warm disk. our observations reveal thecomplex morphology of the disk mwc758. to understand the origin of the detectedfeatures, the combination of high-resolution observations in the submillimeterwith alma and detailed modeling is needed.

1510.05426	multiwavelength optical properties of compact dust aggregates in  protoplanetary disks	in protoplanetary disks micron-size dust grains coagulate to form largerstructures with complex shapes and compositions. the coagulation processchanges the absorption and scattering properties of particles in the disk insignificant ways. to properly interpret observations of protoplanetary disksand to place these observations in the context of the first steps of planetformation, it is crucial to understand the optical properties of these complexstructures. we derive the optical properties of dust aggregates using detailedcomputations of aggregate structures and compare these computa- tionallydemanding results with approximate methods that are cheaper to compute inpractice. in this way we wish to understand the merits and problems ofapproximate methods and define the context in which they can or cannot be usedto analyze observations of objects where significant grain growth is takingplace. for the detailed computations we used the discrete dipole approximation(dda), a method able to compute the interaction of light with a complexlyshaped, inhomogeneous particle. we compared the results to those obtained usingspherical and irregular, homogeneous and inhomogeneous particles. while noapproximate method properly reproduces all characteristics of large dustaggregates, the thermal properties of dust can be analyzed using irregularlyshaped, porous, inhomogeneous grains. the asymmetry of the scattering phasefunction is a good indicator of aggregate size, while the degree ofpolarization is probably determined by the size of the constituent particles.optical properties derived from aggregates significantly differ from the mostfrequently used standard ("astronomical silicate" in spherical grains). weoutline a computationally fast and relatively accurate method that can be usedfor a multiwavelength analysis of aggregate dust in protoplanetary disks.

astro-ph;0106470	passive irradiated circumstellar disks with an inner hole	a model for irradiated dust disks around herbig ae stars is proposed. themodel is based on the flaring disk model of chiang &amp; goldreich (1997), but withthe central regions of the disk removed. the inner rim of the disk is puffed upand is much hotter than the rest of the disk, because it is directly exposed tothe stellar flux. if located at the dust evaporation radius, its reemitted fluxproduces a conspicuous bump in the sed which peaks at 2-3 micron. we proposethat this emission is the explanation for the near-infrared bump observed inthe seds of herbig ae stars. we study for which stellar parameters this bumpwould be observable, and find that it is the case for herbig ae stellarparameters but not for t-tauri stars, confirming what is found from theobservations. we also study the effects of the shadow cast by the inner rimover the rest of the flaring disk. the shadowed region can be quite large, andunder some circumstances the entire disk may lie in the shadow. this shadowedregion will be much cooler than an unshadowed flaring disk, since its onlyheating sources are radial radiative diffusion and possible indirect sources ofirradiation. under certain special circumstances the shadowing effect cansuppress, or even completely eliminate, the 10 micron emission feature from thespectrum, which might explain the anomalous seds of some isolated herbig aestars in the sample of meeus et al. (2001). at much larger radii the diskemerges from the shadow, and continues as a flaring disk towards the outeredge. the complete model, including structure of the inner edge, shadowedregion and the flared outer part, is described in detail in this paper, and weshow examples of the general behavior of the model for varying parameters.

(1998), the infrared spectrum of hd 100546 is very similar tothat of c/1995 o1 hale-bopp (crovisier et al. 1997). using an identicalmethodology, we have therefore also studied this solar system comet. bothobjects have an almost identical grain composition, but with the importantdifference that the individual dust species in hale-bopp are in thermal contactwith each other, while this is not the case in hd 100546. this suggests that ifsimilar processes leading to the dust composition as seen in hd 100546 alsooccurred in our own solar system, that hale-bopp formed after the formation ofone or more proto-gas giants.

astro-ph;0301569	water ice growth around evolved stars	we present a model of the growth of water ice on silicate grains in thecircumstellar envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and red supergiants. we consider the growth of ice by gas grain collisions, the thermalevaporation of ice from a grain, and sputtering. our model contains severalimprovements compared to earlier models, including a detailed treatment of theeffects of sputtering, a detailed calculation of the radiation pressure on thegrain, and the treatment of subsonic drift velocities. in terms of driftvelocity between the grains and gas in the envelope, we find that the iceformation process can be divided into three regimes: (i) a sputtering dominatedregime where ice growth is heavily suppressed, (ii) an intermediate regime withmoderately efficient condensation and (iii) a thermally dominated regime whereice formation is highly efficient. sputtering is the critical factor whichdetermines if ice formation can occur at all. we find that in red supergiants,ice formation is suppressed, while the winds of oh/ir stars allow for efficientcondensation and can convert significant fractions of the available water vapor(tens of percent) into ice mantles on grains. population ii agb stars hardlyform ice due to their low dust to gas ratios. we also modify an analyticalequation describing condensation and depletion (jura and morris, 1985) in orderto give reasonable results for high and low drift velocities. initially, icewill condense in crystalline form, but continuing condensation at lowtemperatures, and damage caused by interstellar uv photons favor the productionof amorphous ice as well. we predict that a significant fraction of the iceformed will be amorphous.

astro-ph;0302164	the mineralogy, geometry and mass-loss history of iras 16342-3814	we present the 2-200 um infrared space observatory (iso) spectrum and 3.8-20um isaac and timmi2 images of the extreme oh/ir star iras 16342-3814. amorphoussilicate absorption features are seen, together with crystalline silicateabsorption features up to almost 45 um. no other oh/ir star is known to havecrystalline silicate features in absorption up to these wavelengths. thissuggests that iras 16342-3814 must have, or recently had, an extremely highmass-loss rate. preliminary radiative transfer calculations suggest that themass-loss rate may be as large as 10^{-3} msun/yr. the 3.8 um isaac image showsa bipolar reflection nebula with a dark equatorial waist or torus, similar tothat seen in optical hubble space telescope (hst) images. the position angle ofthe nebula decreases significantly with increasing wavelength, suggesting thatthe dominant source of emission changes from scattering to thermal emission.still, even up to 20 um the nebula is oriented approximately along the majoraxis of the nebula seen in the hst and isaac images, suggesting that the torusmust be very cold, in agreement with the very red iso spectrum. the 20 um imageshows a roughly spherically symmetric extended halo, approximately 6'' indiameter, which is probably due to a previous phase of mass-loss on the agb,suggesting a transition from a (more) spherically symmetric to a (more) axialsymmetric form of mass-loss at the end of the agb. we estimate the maximum dustparticle sizes in the torus and in the reflection nebula to be 1.3 and 0.09 umrespectively. the size of the particles in the torus is large compared totypical ism values, but in agreement with high mass-loss rate objects like afgl4106 and hd161796. we discuss the possible reason for the difference inparticle size between the torus and the reflection nebula.

astro-ph;0308364	age dependence of the vega phenomenon: theory	in a separate paper (decin et al 2003), we have re-examined the observationsof ir excess obtained with the iso satellite and discussed the ages of starswith excess. the amount of dust (measured by the luminosity fraction\fdust=l_\mathrm{ir}/l_{\star}) seen around main-sequence stars of differentages shows several interesting trends. to discuss these results in the contextof a physical model, we develop in this paper an analytical model for the dustproduction in vega-type systems. previously it has been claimed that a powerlawslope of about -2 in the diagram plotting amount of dust versus time could beexplained by a simple collisional cascade. we show that such a cascade in factresults in a powerlaw \fdust\propto t^{-1} if the dust removal processes aredominated by collisions. a powerlaw \fdust\propto t^{-2} only results when thedust removal processes become dominated by pointing-robertson drag. this may bethe case in the kuiper belt of our own solar system, but it is certainly notthe case in any of the observed disks. a steeper slope can, however, be createdby including continuous stirring into the models. we show that the existence ofboth young and old vega-like systems with large amounts of dust (\fdust\simeq10^{-3}) can be explained qualitatively by kuiper-belt-like structures with\emph{delayed stirring}. finally, the absence of young stars with intermediateamounts of dust may be due to the fact that stirring due to planet formationmay not be active in young low-mass disks. the considerations in this papersupport the picture of simultaneous stirring and dust production proposed bykenyon and bromley (2002).

astro-ph;0401495	flaring vs. self-shadowed disks: the seds of herbig ae/be stars	isolated herbig ae stars can be divided into two groups (meeus et al. 2001):those with an almost flat spectral energy distribution in the mid-infrared(`group i'), and those with a strong decline towards the far-infrared (`groupii'). in this paper we show that the group i vs. ii distinction can beunderstood as arising from flaring vs. self-shadowed disks. we show that thesetwo types of disks are natural solutions of the 2-d radiation-hydrostaticstructure equations. disks with high optical depth turn out to be flaring andhave a strong far-ir emission, while disks with an optical depth below acertain threshold drop into the shadow of their own puffed-up inner rim and areweak in the far-ir. in spite of not having a directly irradiated surface layer,self-shadowed disks still display dust features in emission, in agreement withobservations of group ii sources. we propose an evolutionary scenario in whicha disk starts out with a flaring shape (group i source), and then goes throughthe process of grain growth, causing the optical depth of the disk to drop andthe disk to become self-shadowed (group ii source). we show that this scenariopredicts that the (sub-)millimeter slope of the disk changes from steep (smallgrains) to rayleigh-jeans-like (large grains) in the early stages of evolution,so that all group ii sources are expected to have rayleigh-jeans-like slopes,while some group i sources may still have steep (sub-)millimeter slopes.

astro-ph;0405226	the effect of dust settling on the appearance of protoplanetary disks	we analyze how the process of dust settling affects the spectral energydistribution and optical appearance of protoplanetary disks. using simpleanalytic estimates on the one hand, and detailed 1+1-d models on the otherhand, we show that, while the time scale for settling down to the equator mayexceed the life time of the disk, it takes much less time for even small grainsof 0.1 micron to settle down to a few pressure scale heights. this is oftenwell below the original location of the disk's photosphere, and the disktherefore becomes effectively 'flatter'. if turbulent stirring is included, asteady state solution can be found, which is typically reached after a fewtimes 1e5 years. dependent on the strength of the turbulence, the shape of thedisk in such a steady state can be either fully flaring, or flaring only up toa certain radius and self-shadowed beyond that radius. we show that thesepartly self-shadowed disks have a much weaker mid- to far-infrared flux thanthe fully flaring ones. we also show that these self-shadowed regions of thedisk are very weak in resolved images of scattered light, in contrast to thefully flaring disks. from the calculations with compact grains it follows that,after about 1e6 years, most disks should be self-shadowed. the fact that someolder disks are still observed with the characteristics of flaring diskstherefore seems somewhat inconsistent with the time scales predicted by thesettling model based on compact grains. this suggests that perhaps even thesmall grains (lesssim 0.1 micron) have a porous or fractal structure, or thatthe different geometries of observed disks is merely a reflection of theturbulent state of these disks.

astro-ph;0412117	dust coagulation in protoplanetary disks: a rapid depletion of small  grains	we model the process of dust coagulation in protoplanetary disks andcalculate how it affects their observational appearance. our model involves thedetailed solution of the coagulation equation at every location in the disk. atregular time intervals we feed the resulting 3-d dust distribution functionsinto a continuum radiative transfer code to obtain spectral energydistributions. we find that, even if only the very basic -- and well understood-- coagulation mechanisms are included, the process of grain growth is much tooquick to be consistent with infrared observations of t tauri disks. smallgrains are removed so efficiently that, long before the disk reaches an age of1e6 years typical of t tauri stars, the sed shows only very weak infraredexcess. this is inconsistent with observed seds of most classical t tauristars. small grains somehow need to be replenished, for instance by aggregatefragmentation through high-speed collisions. a very simplified calculationshows that when aggregate fragmentation is included, a quasi-stationary grainsize distribution is obtained in which growth and fragmentation are inequilibrium. this quasi-stationary state may last 1e6 years or even longer,dependent on the circumstances in the disk, and may bring the time scales intothe right regime. we conclude that a simple evolutionary scenario in whichgrains slowly grow from pristine 0.1 micron grains to larger grains over aperiod of a few myr is most likely incorrect.

astro-ph;0503507	a 10 micron spectroscopic survey of herbig ae star disks: grain growth  and crystallization	we present spectroscopic observations of a large sample of herbig ae stars inthe 10 micrometer spectral region. we perform compositional fits of the spectrabased on properties of homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous sphericalparticles, and derive the mineralogy and typical grain sizes of the dustresponsible for the 10 $\mu$m emission. several trends are reported that canconstrain theoretical models of dust processing in these systems: i) none ofthe sources consists of fully pristine dust comparable to that found in theinterstellar medium, ii) all sources with a high fraction of crystallinesilicates are dominated by large grains, iii) the disks around more massivestars (m &gt;~ 2.5 m_sun, l &gt;~ 60 l_sun) have a higher fraction of crystallinesilicates than those around lower mass stars, iv) in the subset of lower massstars (m &lt;~ 2.5 m_sun) there is no correlation between stellar parameters andthe derived crystallinity of the dust. the correlation between the shape andstrength of the 10 micron silicate feature reported by van boekel et al. (2003)is reconfirmed with this larger sample. the evidence presented in this paper iscombined with that of other studies to present a likely scenario of dustprocessing in herbig ae systems. we conclude that the present data favour ascenario in which the crystalline silicates are produced in the innermostregions of the disk, close to the star, and transported outward to the regionswhere they can be detected by means of 10 micron spectroscopy. additionally, weconclude that the final crystallinity of these disks is reached very soon afteractive accretion has stopped.

astro-ph;0504067	absorption and scattering properties of arbitrarily shaped particles in  the rayleigh domain: a rapid computational method and a theoretical  foundation for the statistical approach	we provide a theoretical foundation for the statistical approach forcomputing the absorption properties of particles in the rayleigh domain. wepresent a general method based on the discrete dipole approximation (dda) tocompute the absorption and scattering properties of particles in the rayleighdomain. the method allows to separate the geometrical aspects of a particlefrom its material properties. doing the computation of the optical propertiesof a particle once, provides them for any set of refractive indices,wavelengths and orientations. this allows for fast computations of e.g.absorption spectra of arbitrarily shaped particles. other practicalapplications of the method are in the interpretation of atmospheric and radarmeasurements as well as computations of the scattering matrix of smallparticles as a function of the scattering angle. in the statistical approach,the optical properties of irregularly shaped particles are represented by theaverage properties of an ensemble of particles with simple shapes. we show thatthe absorption cross section of an ensemble of arbitrarily shaped particleswith arbitrary orientations can always be uniquely represented by the averageabsorption cross section of an ensemble of spheroidal particles with the samecomposition and fixed orientation. this proves for the first time that thestatistical approach is generally viable in the rayleigh domain.

astro-ph;0505603	the composition and size distribution of the dust in the coma of comet  hale-bopp	we discuss the composition and size distribution of the dust in the coma ofcomet hale-bopp. we do this by fitting simultaneously the infrared emissionspectrum measured by the infrared space observatory (iso) and the measureddegree of linear polarization of scattered light at various phase angles and 12different wavelengths. the effects of particle shape on the modeled opticalproperties of the dust grains are taken into account. we constrain our fit byforcing the abundances of the major rock forming chemical elements to be solar.the infrared spectrum at long wavelengths reveals that large grains are neededin order to fit the spectral slope. the size and shape distribution we employallows us to estimate the sizes of the crystalline silicates. the ratios of thestrength of various forsterite features show that the crystalline silicategrains in hale-bopp must be submicron sized. we exclude the presence of largecrystalline silicate grains in the coma. because of this lack of largecrystalline grains combined with the fact that we do need large amorphousgrains to fit the emission spectrum at long wavelengths, we need onlyapproximately 4% of crystalline silicates by mass. after correcting forpossible hidden crystalline material included in large amorphous grains, ourbest estimate of the total mass fraction of crystalline material isapproximately 7.5%, significantly lower than deduced in previous studies inwhich the typical derived crystallinity is 20-30%. the implications of this onthe possible origin and evolution of the comet are discussed. the crystallinitywe observe in hale-bopp is consistent with the production of crystallinesilicates in the inner solar system by thermal annealing and subsequent radialmixing to the comet forming region.

astro-ph;0508256	discovery of deuterated water in a young proto-planetary disk	we report the first detection of the ground transition of the deuteratedwater at 464 ghz in the young proto-planetary disk surrounding the solar typeprotostar dm tau. the line is observed in absorption against the continuum fromthe cold dust in the disk midplane, with a line to continuum ratio close tounity. the observation implies that deuterated gaseous water is present, with arelatively large abundance ($\sim 3\times10^{-9}$), in the outer disk above themidplane, where the density is, within a factor ten, $\sim 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ andthe temperature is lower than about 25 k. in these conditions, the h$_2$ocondensation timescale is much smaller than the dm tau disk age, and,therefore, water should be fully frozen onto the grain mantles. we suggest thatuv photons and/or x-rays sublimate part of the mantles re-injecting the icesinto the gas phase. even though there is currently no measurement of h$_2$o, weprovide arguments that the hdo/h$_2$o ratio should be about 0.01 or larger,which would be hundreds of times larger than the values measured in solarsystem objects. this suggests the need of strong caution in comparing andlinking the hdo/h$_2$o in solar system and star forming environments.

astro-ph;0509376	the 10 micron amorphous silicate feature of fractal aggregates and  compact particles with complex shapes	we model the 10 micron absorption spectra of nonspherical particles composedof amorphous silicate. we consider two classes of particles, compact ones andfractal aggregates composed of homogeneous spheres. for the compact particleswe consider gaussian random spheres with various degrees of non-sphericity. forthe fractal aggregates we compute the absorption spectra for various fractaldimensions. the 10 micron spectra are computed for ensembles of these particlesin random orientation using the well-known discrete dipole approximation. wecompare our results to spectra obtained when using volume equivalenthomogeneous spheres and to those computed using a porous sphere approximation.we conclude that, in general, nonspherical particles show a spectral signaturethat is similar to that of homogeneous spheres with a smaller material volume.this effect is overestimated when approximating the particles by porous sphereswith the same volume filling fraction. for aggregates with fractal dimensionstypically predicted for cosmic dust, we show that the spectral signaturecharacteristic of very small homogeneous spheres (with a volume equivalentradius r_v&lt;0.5 micron) can be detected even in very large particles. weconclude that particle sizes are underestimated when using homogeneous spheresto model the emission spectra of astronomical sources. in contrast, theparticle sizes are severely overestimated when using equivalent porous spheresto fit observations of 10 micron silicate emission.

astro-ph;0510635	gas phase water in the surface layer of protoplanetary disks	recent observations of the ground state transition of hdo at 464 ghz towardsthe protoplanetary disk of dm tau have detected the presence of water vapor inthe regions just above the outer disk midplane (ceccarelli et al 2005). in theabsence of non-thermal desorption processes, water should be almost entirelyfrozen onto the grain mantles and hdo undetectable. in this letter we present achemical model that explores the possibility that the icy mantles arephoto-desorbed by fuv (6ev &lt; h nu &lt; 13.6ev) photons. we show that the averageinterstellar fuv field is enough to create a layer of water vapor above thedisk midplane over the entire disk. assuming a photo-desorption yield of10^{-3}, the water abundance in this layer is predicted to be ~ 3 x 10^{-7} andthe average h2o column density is ~ 1.6x 10^{15} cm^{-2}. the predictions arevery weakly dependent on the details of the model, like the incident fuvradiation field, and the gas density in the disk. based on this model, wepredict a gaseous hdo/h2o ratio in dm tau of ~1%. in addition, we predict theground state transition of water at 557 ghz to be undetectable with odin and/orhso-hifi.

astro-ph;0602617	growth of dust as the initial step toward planet formation	we discuss the results of laboratory measurements and theoretical modelsconcerning the aggregation of dust in protoplanetary disks, as the initial steptoward planet formation. small particles easily stick when they collide andform aggregates with an open, often fractal structure, depending on the growthprocess. larger particles are still expected to grow at collision velocities ofabout 1m/s. experiments also show that, after an intermezzo of destructivevelocities, high collision velocities above 10m/s on porous materials againlead to net growth of the target. considerations of dust-gas interactions showthat collision velocities for particles not too different in surface-to-massratio remain limited up to sizes about 1m, and growth seems to be guaranteed toreach these sizes quickly and easily. for meter sizes, coupling to nebulaturbulence makes destructive processes more likely. global aggregation modelsshow that in a turbulent nebula, small particles are swept up too fast to beconsistent with observations of disks. an extended phase may therefore exist inthe nebula during which the small particle component is kept alive throughcollisions driven by turbulence which frustrates growth to planetesimals untilconditions are more favorable for one or more reasons.

astro-ph;0610853	binarity as a key factor in protoplanetary disk evolution: spitzer disk  census of the eta chamaeleontis cluster	the formation of planets is directly linked to the evolution of thecircumstellar (cs) disk from which they are born. the dissipation timescales ofcs disks are, therefore, of direct astrophysical importance in evaluating thetime available for planet formation. we employ spitzer space telescope spectrato complete the cs disk census for the late-type members of the ~8 myr-old etachamaeleontis star cluster. of the 15 k- and m-type members, eight show excessemission. we find that the presence of a cs disk is anti-correlated withbinarity, with all but one disk associated with single stars. with nine singlestars in total, about 80% retain a cs disk. of the six known or suspected closebinaries the only cs disk is associated with the primary of recx 9. nocircumbinary disks have been detected. we also find that stars with disks areslow rotators with surface values of specific angular momentum j = 2-15 j_sun.all high specific angular momentum systems with j = 20-30 j_sun are confined tothe primary stars of binaries. this provides novel empirical evidence forrotational disk locking and again demonstrates the much shorter disk lifetimesin close binary systems compared to single star systems. we estimate thecharacteristic mean disk dissipation timescale to be ~5 myr and ~9 myr for thebinary and single star systems, respectively.

0809.3916	coagulation of small grains in disks: the influence of residual infall  and initial small-grain content	turbulent coagulation in protoplanetary disks is known to operate ontimescale far shorter than the lifetime of the disk. in the absence ofmechanisms that replenish the small dust grain population, protoplanetary diskswould rapidly lose their continuum opacity-bearing dust. this is inconsistentwith infrared observations of disks around t tauri stars and herbig ae/bestars, which are usually optically thick at visual wavelengths and showsignatures of small (a&lt;~ 3um) grains. a plausible replenishing mechanism ofsmall grains is collisional fragmentation or erosion of large dust aggregates,which model calculations predict to play an important role in protoplanetarydisks. if optically thick disks are to be seen as proof for ongoingfragmentation or erosion, then alternative explanations for the existence ofoptically thick disks must be studied carefully. in this study we explore twoscenarios. first, we study the effect of residual, low-level infall of matteronto the disk surface. we find that infall rates as low as 10^{-11} msun/yrcan, in principle, replenish the small grain population to a level that keepsthe disk marginally optically thick. however, it remains to be seen if theassumption of such inflow is realistic for star+disk systems at the age ofseveral myrs, at which winds and jets are expected to have removed any residualenvelope. in summary, fragmentation or erosion still appear to be the mostpromising processes to explain the abundant presence of small grains in olddisks.

0811.0915	a parameter study of self-consistent disk models around herbig aebe  stars	we present a parameter study of self-consistent models of protoplanetarydisks around herbig aebe stars. we use the code developed by dullemond anddominik, which solves the 2d radiative transfer problem including an iterationfor the vertical hydrostatic structure of the disk. this grid of models will beused for several studies on disk emission and mineralogy in followup papers. inthis paper we take a first look on the new models, compare them with previousmodeling attempts and focus on the effects of various parameters on the overallstructure of the sed that leads to the classification of herbig aebe stars intotwo groups, with a flaring (group i) or self-shadowed (group ii) sed. we findthat the parameter of overriding importance to the sed is the total mass ingrains smaller than 25um, confirming the earlier results by dullemond anddominik. all other parameters studied have only minor influences, and willalter the sed type only in borderline cases. we find that there is no naturaldichotomy between group i and ii. from a modeling point of view, the transitionis a continuous function of the small dust mass. we also show that moderategrain growth produces spectra with weak or no 1um feature, both for flaring(group i) and non-flaring (group ii) sources. the fact that sources with weakfeatures have been found mostly in group i sources is therefore surprising andmust be due to observational biases or evolutionary effects.
