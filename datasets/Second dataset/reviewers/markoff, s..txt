0904.2128	constraining jet/disk geometry and radiative processes in stellar black  holes xte j1118+480 and gx 339-4	we present results from modeling of quasi-simultaneous broad band (radiothrough x-ray) observations of the galactic stellar black hole (bh) transientx-ray binary (xrb) systems xte j1118+480 and gx 339-4 using an irradiated disc+ compact jet model. in addition to quantifying the physical properties of thejet, we have developed a new irradiated disc model which also constrains thegeometry and temperature of the outer accretion disc by assuming a disc heatedby viscous energy release and x-ray irradiation from the inner regions. for thesource xte j1118+480, which has better spectral coverage of the two in opticaland near-ir (oir) wavelengths, we show that the entire broad band continuum canbe well described by an outflow-dominated model + an irradiated disc. thebest-fit radius of the outer edge of the disc is consistent with the roche lobegeometry of the system, and the temperature of the outer edge of the accretiondisc is similar to those found for other xrbs. irradiation of the disc by thejet is found to be negligible for this source. for gx 339-4, the entirecontinuum is well described by the jet-dominated model only, with no disccomponent required. for the two xrbs, which have very different physical andorbital parameters and were in different accretion states during theobservations, the sizes of the jet base are similar and both seem to prefer ahigh fraction of non-thermal electrons in the acceleration/shock region and amagnetically dominated plasma in the jet. these results, along with recentsimilar results from modeling other galactic xrbs and agns, may suggest aninherent unity in diversity in the geometric and radiative properties ofcompact jets from accreting black holes.

0707.0028	the spectral energy distribution of quiescent black hole x-ray binaries:  new constraints from spitzer	(abridged) among the various issues that remain open in the field ofaccretion onto black hole x-ray binaries (bhbs) is the way the gas accretes atvery low eddington ratios, in the so-called quiescent regime. while there isgeneral agreement that the x-rays are produced by a population of high-energyelectrons near to the bh, the controversy comes about in modeling thecontribution from inflowing vs. outflowing particles, and their relative energybudget. recent spitzer observations of three quiescent bhbs have shown evidencefor excess emission with respect to the tail of the companion star between 8-24micron. we suggest that synchrotron emission from a partially self-absorbedoutflow might be responsible for the observed mid-ir excess, in place of, or inaddition to, thermal emission from circumbinary material. if so, then the jetsynchrotron luminosity exceeds the measured 2-10 kev luminosity by a factor ofa few in these systems. in turn, the mechanical power stored in the jet exceedsthe bolometric x-ray luminosity at least by 4 orders of magnitude. we thencompile the broadband spectral energy distribution (sed) of a0620-00, thelowest eddington-ratio stellar mass bh with a known radio counterpart, by meansof simultaneous radio, optical and x-ray observations, and the archival spitzerdata. we are able to fit the sed of a0620-00 with a `maximally jet-dominated'model in which the radio through the soft x-rays are dominated by synchrotronemission, while the hard x-rays are dominated by inverse compton at the jetbase. the fitted parameters land in a range of values that is reminiscent ofthe galactic center super-massive bh sgr a*. most notably, the inferred ratioof the jet acceleration rate to local cooling rates is two orders of magnitudeweaker with respect to higher luminosity, hard state sources.

0909.2574	from multiwavelength to mass scaling: accretion and ejection in  microquasars and agn	a solid theoretical understanding of how inflowing, accreting plasma aroundblack holes and other compact objects gives rise to outflowing winds and jetsis still lacking, despite decades of observations. the fact that similarprocesses and morphologies are observed in both x-ray binaries as well asactive galactic nuclei has led to suggestions that the underlying physics couldscale with black hole mass, which could provide a new handle on the problem. inthe last decade, simultaneous broadband campaigns of the fast-varying x-raybinaries particularly in their microquasar state have driven the developmentof, and in some cases altered, our ideas about the inflow/outflow connection inaccreting black holes. specifically the discovery of correlations between theradio, infrared and x-ray bands has revealed a remarkable connectivity betweenthe various emission regions, and argued for a more holistic approach totackling questions about accretion. this article reviews the recent majorobservational and theoretical advances that focus specifically on the relationbetween the two "sides" of the accretion process in black holes, with anemphasis on how new tools can be derived for comparisons across the mass scale.

0909.2632	following the 2008 outburst decay of the black hole candidate h1743-322  in x-ray and radio	in this paper we report on radio (vla and atca) and x-ray (rxte, chandra andswift) observations of the outburst decay of the transient black hole candidateh1743-322 in early 2008. we find that the x-ray light curve followed anexponential decay, leveling off towards its quiescent level. the exponentialdecay timescale is ~4 days and the quiescent flux corresponds to a luminosityof 3x10^32 (d/7.5 kpc)^2 erg/s. this together with the relation betweenquiescent x-ray luminosity and orbital period reported in the literaturesuggests that h1743-322 has an orbital period longer than ~10 hours. both theradio and x-ray light curve show evidence for flares. the radio - x-raycorrelation can be well described by a power-law with index ~0.18. this is muchlower than the index of 0.6-0.7 found for the decay of several black holetransients before. the radio spectral index measured during one of the radioflares while the source is in the low-hard state, is -0.5+-0.15, whichindicates that the radio emission is optically thin. this is unlike what hasbeen found before in black hole sources in the low-hard state. we attribute theradio flares and the low index for the radio - x-ray correlation to thepresence of shocks downstream the jet flow, triggered by ejection eventsearlier in the outburst. we find no evidence for a change in x-ray power lawspectral index during the decay, although the relatively high extinction of n_h=2.3x10^22 cm^-2 limits the detected number of soft photons and thus theaccuracy of the spectral fits.

1104.1577	observing pulsars and fast transients with lofar	low frequency radio waves, while challenging to observe, are a rich source ofinformation about pulsars. the low frequency array (lofar) is a new radiointerferometer operating in the lowest 4 octaves of the ionospheric "radiowindow": 10-240mhz, that will greatly facilitate observing pulsars at low radiofrequencies. through the huge collecting area, long baselines, and flexibledigital hardware, it is expected that lofar will revolutionize radio astronomyat the lowest frequencies visible from earth. lofar is a next-generation radiotelescope and a pathfinder to the square kilometre array (ska), in that itincorporates advanced multi-beaming techniques between thousands of individualelements. we discuss the motivation for low-frequency pulsar observations ingeneral and the potential of lofar in addressing these science goals. wepresent lofar as it is designed to perform high-time-resolution observations ofpulsars and other fast transients, and outline the various relevant observingmodes and data reduction pipelines that are already or will soon be implementedto facilitate these observations. a number of results obtained fromcommissioning observations are presented to demonstrate the exciting potentialof the telescope. this paper outlines the case for low frequency pulsarobservations and is also intended to serve as a reference for upcomingpulsar/fast transient science papers with lofar.

1109.1813	multiwavelength observations of a0620-00 in quiescence	[abridged.] we present multiwavelength observations of the black hole binarysystem, a0620-00. using the cosmic origins spectrograph on the hubble spacetelescope, we have obtained the first fuv spectrum of a0620-00. the observedspectrum is flat in the fuv and very faint (with continuum fluxes \simeq 1e -17 ergs/cm^2/s/a). we compiled the dereddened, broadband spectral energydistribution of a0620-00 and compared it to previous seds as well astheoretical models. the seds show that the source varies at all wavelengths forwhich we have multiple samples. contrary to previous observations, theoptical-uv spectrum does not continue to drop to shorter wavelengths, butinstead shows a recovery and an increasingly blue spectrum in the fuv. wecreated an optical-uv spectrum of a0620-00 with the donor star contributionremoved. the non-stellar spectrum peaks at \simeq3000 {\deg}a. the peak can befit with a t=10,000 k blackbody with a small emitting area, probablyoriginating in the hot spot where the accretion stream impacts the outer disk.however, one or more components in addition to the blackbody are needed to fitthe fuv upturn and the red optical fluxes in the optical-uv spectrum. bycomparing the mass accretion rate determined from the hot spot luminosity tothe mean accretion rate inferred from the outburst history, we find that thelatter is an order of magnitude smaller than the former, indicating that\sim90% of the accreted mass must be lost from the system if the predictions ofthe disk instability model and the estimated interoutburst interval arecorrect. the mass accretion rate at the hot spot is 10^5 the accretion rate atthe black hole inferred from the x-ray luminosity. to reconcile these requiresthat outflows carry away virtually all of the accreted mass, a very low rate ofmass transfer from the outer cold disk into the inner hot region, and/orradiatively inefficient accretion.

1211.1655	jet spectral breaks in black hole x-ray binaries	in x-ray binaries, compact jets are known to commonly radiate at radio toinfrared frequencies, whereas at optical to gamma-ray energies, thecontribution of the jet is debated. the total luminosity, and hence power ofthe jet is critically dependent on the position of the break in its spectrum,between optically thick (self-absorbed) and optically thin synchrotronemission. this break, or turnover, has been reported in just one black holex-ray binary (bhxb) thus far, gx 339-4, and inferred via spectral fitting intwo others, a0620-00 and cyg x-1. here, we collect a wealth of multiwavelengthdata from the outbursts of bhxbs during hard x-ray states, in order to searchfor jet breaks as yet unidentified in their spectral energy distributions. inparticular, we report the direct detection of the jet break in the spectrum ofv404 cyg during its 1989 outburst, at nu_b = (1.8 +- 0.3) x 10^14 hz (1.7 +-0.2 microns). we increase the number of bhxbs with measured jet breaks fromthree to eight. jet breaks are found at frequencies spanning more than twoorders of magnitude, from nu_b = (4.5 +- 0.8) x 10^12 hz for xte j1118+480during its 2005 outburst, to nu_b &gt; 4.7 x 10^14 hz for v4641 sgr in outburst. apositive correlation between jet break frequency and luminosity is expectedtheoretically; nu_b \propto l_nu,jet^~0.5 if other parameters are constant.with constraints on the jet break in a total of 12 bhxbs including twoquiescent systems, we find a large range of jet break frequencies at similarluminosities and no obvious global relation (but such a relation cannot beruled out for individual sources). we speculate that different magnetic fieldstrengths and/or different radii of the acceleration zone in the inner regionsof the jet are likely to be responsible for the observed scatter betweensources.

1304.3510	an evolving compact jet in the black hole x-ray binary maxi j1836-194	we report striking changes in the broadband spectrum of the compact jet ofthe black hole transient maxi j1836-194 over state transitions during itsdiscovery outburst in 2011. a fading of the optical-infrared (ir) flux occurredas the source entered the hard-intermediate state, followed by a brightening asit returned to the hard state. the optical-ir spectrum was consistent with apower law from optically thin synchrotron emission, except when the x-rayspectrum was softest. by fitting the radio to optical spectra with a brokenpower law, we constrain the frequency and flux of the optically thick/thinbreak in the jet synchrotron spectrum. the break gradually shifted to higherfrequencies as the source hardened at x-ray energies, from ~ 10^11 to ~ 4 x10^13 hz. the radiative jet luminosity integrated over the spectrum appeared tobe greatest when the source entered the hard state during the outburst decay(although this is dependent on the high energy cooling break, which is not seendirectly), even though the radio flux was fading at the time. the physicalprocess responsible for suppressing and reactivating the jet (neither of whichare instantaneous but occur on timescales of weeks) is uncertain, but couldarise from the varying inner accretion disk radius regulating the fraction ofaccreting matter that is channeled into the jet. this provides an unprecedentedinsight into the connection between inflow and outflow, and has implicationsfor the conditions required for jets to be produced, and hence their launchingprocess.

1305.2157	relativistic agn jets i. the delicate interplay between jet structure,  cocoon morphology and jet-head propagation	current observations have shown that astrophysical jets reveal strong signsof radial structure. they suggest that the inner region of the jet, the jetspine, consists of a low-density, fast-moving gas, while the outer region ofthe jet consists of a more dense and slower moving gas, called the jet sheath.moreover, if jets carry angular momentum, the resultant centrifugal forces leadto a radial stratification. current observations are not able to fully resolvethe radial structure, so little is known about its actual profile. we presentthree agn jet models in $2.5d$ of which two have been given a radial structure.the first model is a homogeneous jet, the only model that doesn't carry angularmomentum; the second model is a spine-sheath jet with an isothermal equation ofstate; and the third jet model is a (piecewise) isochoric spine-sheath jet,with constant but different densities for jet spine and jet sheath. in thispaper, we look at the effects of radial stratification on jet integrity, mixingbetween the different jet components and global morphology of the jet-head andsurrounding cocoon.

1309.4926	the evolving polarised jet of black hole candidate swift j1745-26	swift j1745-26 is an x-ray binary towards the galactic centre that wasdetected when it went into outburst in september 2012. this source is thoughtto be one of a growing number of sources that display "failed outbursts", inwhich the self-absorbed radio jets of the transient source are never fullyquenched and the thermal emission from the geometrically-thin inner accretiondisk never fully dominates the x-ray flux. we present multifrequency data fromthe very large array, australia telescope compact array and karoo arraytelescope (kat- 7) radio arrays, spanning the entire period of the outburst.our rich data set exposes radio emission that displays a high level of largescale variability compared to the x-ray emission and deviations from thestandard radio--x-ray correlation that are indicative of an unstable jet andconfirm the outburst's transition from the canonical hard state to anintermediate state. we also observe steepening of the spectral index and anincrease of the linear polarization to a large fraction (~50%) of the totalflux, as well as a rotation of the electric vector position angle. these areconsistent with a transformation from a self-absorbed compact jet tooptically-thin ejecta -- the first time such a discrete ejection has beenobserved in a failed outburst -- and may imply a complex magnetic fieldgeometry.

1312.5822	the accretion-ejection coupling in the black hole candidate x-ray binary  maxi j1836-194	we present the results of our quasi-simultaneous radio, sub-mm, infrared,optical and x-ray study of the galactic black hole candidate x-ray binary maxij1836-194 during its 2011 outburst. we consider the full multi-wavelengthspectral evolution of the outburst, investigating whether the evolution of thejet spectral break (the transition between optically-thick and optically-thinsynchrotron emission) is caused by any specific properties of the accretionflow. our observations show that the break does not scale with the x-rayluminosity or with the inner radius of the accretion disk, and is insteadlikely to be set by much more complex processes. we find that the radius of theacceleration zone at the base of the jet decreases from ~10$^6$ gravitationalradii during the hard intermediate state to ~10$^3$ gravitational radii as theoutburst fades (assuming a black hole mass of 8 m$_{\odot}$), demonstratingthat the electrons are accelerated on much larger scales than the radius of theinner accretion disk and that the jet properties change significantly duringoutburst. from our broadband modelling and high-resolution optical spectra, weargue that early in the outburst, the high-energy synchrotron cooling break waslocated in the optical band, between $\approx 3.2 \times 10^{14}$ hz and $4.5\times 10^{14}$ hz. we calculate that the jet has a total radiative power of$\approx 3.1 \times 10^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$, which is ~6% of the bolometricradiative luminosity at this time. we discuss how this cooling break may evolveduring the outburst, and how that evolution dictates the total jet radiativepower. assuming the source is a stellar-mass black hole with canonical statetransitions, from the measured flux and peak temperature of the disk componentwe constrain the source distance to be 4-10 kpc.

1406.7242	lofar sparse image reconstruction	context. the low frequency array (lofar) radio telescope is a giant digitalphased array interferometer with multiple antennas distributed in europe. itprovides discrete sets of fourier components of the sky brightness. recoveringthe original brightness distribution with aperture synthesis forms an inverseproblem that can be solved by various deconvolution and minimization methodsaims. recent papers have established a clear link between the discrete natureof radio interferometry measurement and the "compressed sensing" (cs) theory,which supports sparse reconstruction methods to form an image from the measuredvisibilities. empowered by proximal theory, cs offers a sound framework forefficient global minimization and sparse data representation using fastalgorithms. combined with instrumental direction-dependent effects (dde) in thescope of a real instrument, we developed and validated a new method based onthis framework methods. we implemented a sparse reconstruction method in thestandard lofar imaging tool and compared the photometric and resolutionperformance of this new imager with that of clean-based methods (clean andms-clean) with simulated and real lofar data results. we show that i) sparsereconstruction performs as well as clean in recovering the flux of pointsources; ii) performs much better on extended objects (the root mean squareerror is reduced by a factor of up to 10); and iii) provides a solution with aneffective angular resolution 2-3 times better than the clean images.conclusions. sparse recovery gives a correct photometry on high dynamic andwide-field images and improved realistic structures of extended sources (ofsimulated and real lofar datasets). this sparse reconstruction method iscompatible with modern interferometric imagers that handle dde corrections (a-and w-projections) required for current and future instruments such as lofarand ska

1407.4385	lofar tied-array imaging of type iii solar radio bursts	the sun is an active source of radio emission which is often associated withenergetic phenomena such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (cmes). atlow radio frequencies (&lt;100 mhz), the sun has not been imaged extensivelybecause of the instrumental limitations of previous radio telescopes. here, thecombined high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution of the low frequencyarray (lofar) was used to study solar type iii radio bursts at 30-90 mhz andtheir association with cmes. the sun was imaged with 126 simultaneoustied-array beams within 5 solar radii of the solar centre. this method offersbenefits over standard interferometric imaging since each beam produces hightemporal (83 ms) and spectral resolution (12.5 khz) dynamic spectra at an arrayof spatial locations centred on the sun. lofar's standard interferometricoutput is currently limited to one image per second. over a period of 30minutes, multiple type iii radio bursts were observed, a number of which werefound to be located at high altitudes (4 solar radii from the solar center at30 mhz) and to have non-radial trajectories. these bursts occurred at altitudesin excess of values predicted by 1d radial electron density models. thenon-radial high altitude type iii bursts were found to be associated with theexpanding flank of a cme. the cme may have compressed neighbouring streamerplasma producing larger electron densities at high altitudes, while thenon-radial burst trajectories can be explained by the deflection of radialmagnetic fields as the cme expanded in the low corona.

1412.3106	the x-ray flux distribution of sagittarius a* as seen by chandra	we present a statistical analysis of the x-ray flux distribution of sgr a*from the chandra x-ray observatory's 3 ms sgr a* x-ray visionary project (xvp)in 2012. our analysis indicates that the observed x-ray flux distribution canbe decomposed into a steady quiescent component, represented by a poissonprocess with rate $q=(5.24\pm0.08)\times10^{-3}$ cts s$^{-1},$ and a variablecomponent, represented by a power law process ($dn/df\propto f^{-\xi},$$\xi=1.92_{-0.02}^{+0.03}$). this slope matches our recently-reporteddistribution of flare luminosities. the variability may also be described by alog-normal process with a median unabsorbed 2-8 kev flux of$1.8^{+0.9}_{-0.6}\times10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a shape parameter$\sigma=2.4\pm0.2,$ but the power law provides a superior description of thedata. in this decomposition of the flux distribution, all of the intrinsicx-ray variability of sgr a* (spanning at least three orders of magnitude influx) can be attributed to flaring activity, likely in the inner accretionflow. we confirm that at the faint end, the variable component contributes ~10%of the apparent quiescent flux, as previously indicated by our statisticalanalysis of x-ray flares in these chandra observations. our flux distributionprovides a new and important observational constraint on theoretical models ofsgr a*, and we use simple radiation models to explore the extent to which astatistical comparison of the x-ray and infrared can provide insights into thephysics of the x-ray emission mechanism.

1505.03064	lofar discovery of a quiet emission mode in psr b0823+26	psr b0823+26, a 0.53-s radio pulsar, displays a host of emission phenomenaover timescales of seconds to (at least) hours, including nulling, subpulsedrifting, and mode-changing. studying pulsars like psr b0823+26 providesfurther insight into the relationship between these various emission phenomenaand what they might teach us about pulsar magnetospheres. here we report on thelofar discovery that psr b0823+26 has a weak and sporadically emitting 'quiet'(q) emission mode that is over 100 times weaker (on average) and has a nullingfraction forty-times greater than that of the more regularly-emitting 'bright'(b) mode. previously, the pulsar has been undetected in the q-mode, and wasassumed to be nulling continuously. psr b0823+26 shows a further decrease inaverage flux just before the transition into the b-mode, and perhaps trulyturns off completely at these times. furthermore, simultaneous observationstaken with the lofar, westerbork, lovell, and effelsberg telescopes between 110mhz and 2.7 ghz demonstrate that the transition between the q-mode and b-modeoccurs within one single rotation of the neutron star, and that it isconcurrent across the range of frequencies observed.

1506.01141	radio polarimetry as a probe of unresolved jets: the 2013 outburst of  xte j1908+094	xte j1908+094 is an x-ray transient black hole candidate in the galacticplane that was observed in outburst in 2002 and 2013. here we presentmulti-frequency radio and x-ray data, including radio polarimetry, spanning theentire period of the 2013 outburst. we find that the x-ray behaviour of xtej1908+094 traces the standard black hole hardness-intensity path, evolving froma hard state, through a soft state, before returning to a hard state andquiescence. its radio behaviour is typical of a compact jet that becomesquenched before discrete ejecta are launched during the late stages of x-raysoftening. the radio and x-ray fluxes, as well as the light curve morphologies,are consistent with those observed during the 2002 outburst of this source. thepolarisation angle during the rise of the outburst infers a jet orientation inagreement with resolved observations but also displays a gradual drift, whichwe associate with observed changes in the structure of the discrete ejecta. wealso observe an unexpected 90deg rotation of the polarisation angle associatedwith a second component.

1509.06396	wide-band, low-frequency pulse profiles of 100 radio pulsars with lofar	lofar offers the unique capability of observing pulsars across the 10-240 mhzfrequency range with a fractional bandwidth of roughly 50%. this spectral rangeis well-suited for studying the frequency evolution of pulse profile morphologycaused by both intrinsic and extrinsic effects: such as changing emissionaltitude in the pulsar magnetosphere or scatter broadening by the interstellarmedium, respectively. the magnitude of most of these effects increases rapidlytowards low frequencies. lofar can thus address a number of open questionsabout the nature of radio pulsar emission and its propagation through theinterstellar medium. we present the average pulse profiles of 100 pulsarsobserved in the two lofar frequency bands: high band (120-167 mhz, 100profiles) and low band (15-62 mhz, 26 profiles). we compare them withwesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) and lovell telescope observationsat higher frequencies (350 and1400 mhz) in order to study the profileevolution. the profiles are aligned in absolute phase by folding with a new setof timing solutions from the lovell telescope, which we present along withprecise dispersion measures obtained with lofar. we find that the profileevolution with decreasing radio frequency does not follow a specific trend but,depending on the geometry of the pulsar, new components can enter into, or behidden from, view. nonetheless, in general our observations confirm thewidening of pulsar profiles at low frequencies, as expected fromradius-to-frequency mapping or birefringence theories. we offer this catalog oflow-frequency pulsar profiles in a user friendly way via the epn database ofpulsar profiles (http://www.epta.eu.org/epndb/).

1510.08122	a connection between plasma conditions near black hole event horizons  and outflow properties	accreting black holes are responsible for producing the fastest, mostpowerful outflows of matter in the universe. the formation process of powerfuljets close to black holes is poorly understood, and the conditions leading tojet formation are currently hotly debated. in this paper, we report anunambiguous empirical correlation between the properties of the plasma close tothe black hole and the particle acceleration properties within jets launchedfrom the central regions of accreting stellar-mass and supermassive blackholes. in these sources the emission of the plasma near the black hole ischaracterized by a power law at x-ray energies during times when the jets areproduced. we find that the photon index of this power law, which givesinformation on the underlying particle distribution, correlates with thecharacteristic break frequency in the jet spectrum, which is dependent onmagnetohydrodynamical processes in the outflow. the observed range in breakfrequencies varies by five orders of magnitude, in sources that span nineorders of magnitude in black hole mass, revealing a similarity of jetproperties over a large range of black hole masses powering these jets. thiscorrelation demonstrates that the internal properties of the jet rely mostcritically on the conditions of the plasma close to the black hole, rather thanother parameters such as the black hole mass or spin, and will provide abenchmark that should be reproduced by the jet formation models.

astro-ph;0210439	exploring the role of jets in the radio/x-ray correlations of gx339-4	the galactic black hole candidate x-ray binary gx339-4 spends most of itstime in the low/hard state, making it an ideal candidate for modeling theassumedly low accretion phase. the radio emission correlates very tightly withthe x-rays over more than two orders of magnitude in x-ray flux density,suggesting that the jet plasma also plays a role at higher frequencies. wecompare the predictions of our jet model, with and without acceleration, tothirteen broadband simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous spectra over thischanging flux history. in addition, we consider a simple standard thin diskwhich transitions to an optically thin accretion flow, in order to account forthe assumedly thermal optical data seen in some observations. a solutionwithout acceleration cannot describe the data without unrealistic energyrequirements. but because of the low disk luminosity, and possibly the assumeddisk geometry, acceleration in the jet is limited only by synchrotron coolingand can extend easily into the x-rays. we present a model which can account forall the broadband spectra included here, by changing only two parameters in thejet model: the input power and the location of the first acceleration zone.however, the model is most sensitive to changes in the jet power, the varyingof which can also account for the slope of the observed radio/x-ray correlationanalytically. at the highest low/hard state luminosities, the synchrotronself-compton emission from the jet could be detectable with missions such as{\em glast}, providing a way to test the extent of the synchrotroncontribution. we conclude that jet synchrotron is a possible way to explain thebroadband features and this correlation, and discuss ways of incorporating thiscomponent into the ``standard'' corona picture.

astro-ph;0301479	modeling the x-ray contribution of x-ray binary jets	astrophysical jets exist in both xrbs and agn, and seem to share commonfeatures, particularly in the radio. while agn jets are known to emit x-rays,the situation for xrb jets is not so clear. radio jets have been resolved inseveral xrbs in the low/hard state, establishing that some form of outflow isroutinely present in this state. interestingly, the flat-to-inverted radiosynchrotron emission associated with these outflows strongly correlates withthe x-ray emission in several sources, suggesting that the jet plasma plays arole at higher frequencies. in this same state, there is increasing evidencefor a turnover in the ir/optical where the flat-to-inverted spectrum seems toconnect to an optically thin component extending into the x-rays. we discusshow jet synchrotron emission is likely to contribute to the x-rays, in additionto inverse compton up-scattering, providing a natural explanation for thesecorrelations and the turnover in the ir/optical band. we present modelparameters for fits to several sources, and address some common misconceptionsabout the jet model.

astro-ph;9708068	on the nature of the egret source at the galactic center	the recent detection of a gamma-ray flux from the direction of the galacticcenter by egret on the compton gro raises the question of whether this is apoint source (possibly coincident with the massive black hole candidate sgr a*)or a diffuse emitter. using the latest experimental particle physics data andtheoretical models, we examine in detail the gamma-ray spectrum produced bysynchrotron, inverse compton scattering and mesonic decay resulting from theinteraction of relativistic protons with hydrogen accreting onto a point-likeobject. such a distribution of high-energy baryons may be expected to formwithin an accretion shock as the inflowing gas becomes supersonic. thisscenario is motivated by hydrodynamic studies of bondi-hoyle accretion onto sgra*, which indicate that many of its radiative characteristics may ultimately beassociated with energy liberated as this plasma descends down into the deeppotential well. earlier attempts at analyzing this process concluded that theegret data are inconsistent with a massive point-like object. here, wedemonstrate that a more careful treatment of the physics of p-p scatteringsuggests that a ~10^6 solar mass black hole may be contributing to thishigh-energy emission.
