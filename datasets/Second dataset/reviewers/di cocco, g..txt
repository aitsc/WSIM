0902.2959	first agile catalog of high confidence gamma-ray sources	we present the first catalog of high-confidence gamma-ray sources detected bythe agile satellite during observations performed from july 9, 2007 to june 30,2008. catalogued sources are detected by merging all the available data overthe entire time period. agile, launched in april 2007, is an asi missiondevoted to gamma-ray observations in the 30 mev - 50 gev energy range, withsimultaneous x-ray imaging capability in the 18-60 kev band. this catalog isbased on gamma-ray imaging detector (grid) data for energies greater than 100mev. for the first agile catalog we adopted a conservative analysis, with ahigh-quality event filter optimized to select gamma-ray events within thecentral zone of the instrument field of view (radius of 40 degrees). this is asignificance-limited (4 sigma) catalog, and it is not a complete flux-limitedsample due to the non-uniform first year agile sky coverage. the catalogincludes 47 sources, 21 of which are associated with confirmed or candidatepulsars, 13 with blazars (7 fsrq, 4 bl lacs, 2 unknown type), 2 with hmxrbs, 2with snrs, 1 with a colliding-wind binary system, 8 with unidentified sources.

0909.3484	agile detection of a rapid gamma-ray flare from the blazar pks 1510-089  during the gasp-webt monitoring	we report the detection by the agile satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flarefrom the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089, during a pointing centered onthe galactic center region from 1 march to 30 march 2008. this source has beencontinuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the glast-agile supportprogram (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). moreover, thegamma-ray flaring episode triggered three too observations by the swiftsatellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 march 2008. in the period1-16 march 2008, agile detected gamma-ray emission from pks 1510-089 at asignificance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 mev.after a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 march 2008, agiledetected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux(e &gt; 100 mev) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak levelof (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. duringthe observing period january-april 2008, the source also showed an intense andvariable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significantincrease of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. moreover, in thex-ray band the swift/xrt observations seem to show an harder-when-brighterbehaviour of the source spectrum. the spectral energy distribution of mid-march2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton emissionplus contributions from inverse compton scattering of external photons fromboth the accretion disc and the broad line region. indeed, some features in theoptical-uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert-like components,such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

0910.5344	discovery of extreme particle acceleration in the microquasar cygnus x-3	the study of relativistic particle acceleration is a major topic ofhigh-energy astrophysics. it is well known that massive black holes in activegalaxies can release a substantial fraction of their accretion power intoenergetic particles, producing gamma-rays and relativistic jets. galacticmicroquasars (hosting a compact star of 1-10 solar masses which accretes matterfrom a binary companion) also produce relativistic jets. however, no directevidence of particle acceleration above gev energies has ever been obtained inmicroquasar ejections, leaving open the issue of the occurrence and timing ofextreme matter energization during jet formation. here we report the detectionof transient gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from the microquasar cygnus x-3,an exceptional x-ray binary which sporadically produces powerful radio jets.four gamma-ray flares (each lasting 1-2 days) were detected by the agilesatellite simultaneously with special spectral states of cygnus x-3 during theperiod mid-2007/mid-2009. our observations show that very efficient particleacceleration and gamma-ray propagation out of the inner disk of a microquasarusually occur a few days before major relativistic jet ejections. flaringparticle energies can be thousands of times larger than previously detectedmaximum values (with lorentz factors of 105 and 102 for electrons and protons,respectively). we show that the transitional nature of gamma-ray flares andparticle acceleration above gev energies in cygnus x-3 is clearly linked tospecial radio/x-ray states preceding strong radio flares. thus gamma-raysprovide unique insight into the nature of physical processes in microquasars.

1001.5150	direct evidence for hadronic cosmic-ray acceleration in the supernova  renmant ic 443	the supernova remnant (snr) ic 443 is an intermediate-age remnant well knownfor its radio, optical, x-ray and gamma-ray energy emissions. in this letter westudy the gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from ic 443 as obtained by the agilesatellite. a distinct pattern of diffuse emission in the energy range 100 mev-3gev is detected across the snr with its prominent maximum (source "a")localized in the northeastern shell with a flux f = (47 \pm 10) 10^{-8} photonscm^{-2} s^{-1} above 100 mev. this location is the site of the strongest shockinteraction between the snr blast wave and the dense circumstellar medium.source "a" is not coincident with the tev source located 0.4 degree away andassociated with a dense molecular cloud complex in the snr central region. fromour observations, and from the lack of detectable diffuse tev emission from itsnortheastern rim, we demonstrate that electrons cannot be the main emitters ofgamma-rays in the range 0.1-10 gev at the site of the strongest snr shock. theintensity, spectral characteristics, and location of the most prominentgamma-ray emission together with the absence of co-spatial detectable tevemission are consistent only with a hadronic model of cosmic-ray accelerationin the snr. a high-density molecular cloud (cloud "e") provides a remarkable"target" for nucleonic interactions of accelerated hadrons: our results showenhanced gamma-ray production near the molecular cloud/shocked shellinteraction site. ic 443 provides the first unambiguous evidence of cosmic-rayacceleration by snrs.

1005.0784	agile detection of gev gamma-ray emission from the snr w28	supernova remnants (snrs) are believed to be the main sources of galacticcosmic rays. molecular clouds associated with snrs can produce gamma-rayemission through the interaction of accelerated particles with the concentratedgas. the middle aged snr w28, for its associated system of dense molecularclouds, provides an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis. we presentthe agile/grid observations of snr w28, and compare them with observations atother wavelengths (tev and 12co j=1--&gt;0 molecular line emission). the gamma-rayflux detected by agile from the dominant source associated with w28 is (14 +-5) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for e &gt; 400 mev. this source is positionally wellcorrelated with the tev emission observed by the hess telescope. the localvariations of the gev to tev flux ratio suggest a difference between the crspectra of the north-west and south molecular cloud complexes. a model based ona hadronic-induced interaction and diffusion with two molecular clouds atdifferent distances from the w28 shell can explain both the morphological andspectral features observed by agile in the mev-gev energy range and by the hesstelescope in the tev energy range. the combined set of agile and h.e.s.s. datastrongly support a hadronic model for the gamma-ray production in w28.

1111.4960	agile detection of cygnus x-3 {\gamma}-ray active states during the  period mid-2009/mid-2010	cygnus x-3 (cyg x-3) is a well-known microquasar producing variable emissionat all wavelengths. cyg x-3 is a prominent x-ray binary producing relativisticjets, and studying its high energy emission is crucial for the understanding ofthe fundamental acceleration processes in accreting compact objects. aims. ourgoal is to study extreme particle acceleration and {\gamma}-ray productionabove 100 mev during special spectral states of cyg x- 3 usually characterizedby a low hard x-ray flux and enhanced soft x-ray states. we observed cyg x-3with the agile satellite in extended time intervals from 2009 jun.-jul., and2009 nov.-2010 jul. we report here the results of the agile {\gamma}-raymonitoring of cyg x-3 as well as the results from extensive multiwavelengthcampaigns involving radio (ratan-600, ami-la and mets\"{a}hovi radioobservatories) and x-ray monitoring data (xte and swift). we detect a series ofrepeated {\gamma}-ray flaring activity from cyg x-3 that correlate with thesoft x-ray states and episodes of decreasing or non-detectable hard x-rayemission. furthermore, we detect {\gamma}-ray enhanced emission that tends tobe associated with radio flares greater than 1 jy at 15 ghz, confirming a trendalready detected in previous observations. the source remained active above 100mev for an extended period of time (almost 1.5 months in 2009 jun.-jul. and 1month in 2010 may). we study in detail the short timescale {\gamma}-ray flaresthat occurred before or near the radio peaks. our results confirm the transientnature of the extreme particle acceleration from the microquasar cyg x-3. aseries of repeated {\gamma}-ray flares shows correlations with radio and x-rayemission confirming a well established trend of emission. we compare ourresults with fermi-lat and magic tev observations of cyg x-3.

astro-ph;0007392	multiple bepposax observations of ic 4329a to probe the origin of the  compton reflection component in seyfert 1 galaxies	ic 4329a is the brightest known seyfert galaxy in hard (~2-30 kev) x-rays andis likely to be representative of seyfert 1 galaxies as a class. a recent 100ks bepposax observation (perola et al. 1999) clearly confirmed the presence ofa warm absorber, a reflection component (r~0.6), and a high-energy cut-off inthe power law at ec~270 kev. its richness in spectral features, combined withits large flux (~1.6 x 10**-10 erg/cm2s between 2-10 kev), make this targetideal for multiple observations (in particular with bepposax) to search forspectral variations. results obtained from 3 follow-up observations (40 kseach) are presented here. the first and most important goal of this study wasto probe the origin of the compton reflection component observed in seyfertgalaxies by monitoring the variability of the reflection continuum and fek linein response to primary continuum variations. the second goal was to search forvariability in the high energy cutoff. we obtain however no conclusive resultson any of these issues. in fact, all four observations unfortunately caught thesource at almost the same flux, showing only little, and marginal, spectralchanges between different observations.

astro-ph;0101324	on the origin of the fek$\alpha$ line in the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 7172	the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 7172 was observed twice by bepposax narrow fieldinstruments approximately one year apart. as found in previous observations,the source is variable on short time scales (hours) by a factor of $\sim$30%,confirming the presence of a type 1 nucleus at the center. a strong fluxvariability (by a factor of 2) on a longer time scale was observed between thetwo observations. indeed, in november 1997, the lowest flux ever recorded wasdetected by bepposax. the broad band spectra obtained with the bepposax narrowfield instruments show marginal evidence of a reflection component. thisstructure could explain the very flat spectra previously observed in the 2-10kev band. an fek$\alpha$ line was also detected in both observations. the lineintensity appears to remain almost constant between the two observations evenif the associated large errors cannot exclude some variability. in order tounderstand the problem of the origin of the line, data from previousobservations, performed with other satellites, were also used. the scenariofavored is one where the line is produced at a distance of approximatively 8light years from the continuum source region, rather than having its origin inthe accretion disk. in the framework of the standard unified models for agn,this suggests that its origin is located in the molecular torus.

astro-ph;0110140	bepposax view of ngc 526a: a seyfert 1.9 galaxy with a flat spectrum	in the present work we report the bepposax observation of the seyfert 1.9galaxy ngc 526a in the band 0.1-150 kev. the high energy instrument onboard,pds, has succeeded in measuring for the first time the spectrum of this sourcein the 13-150 kev range. the combined analysis of all narrow field instrumentsprovides a power law spectral index of ~ 1.6 and confirms the flat spectralnature of this source. although ngc 526a varies strongly in the 2-10 kev overperiod of months/years, its spectral shape remains constant over thesetimescales. an fe k-alpha line, characterized by a complex structure, has beendetected in the 6-7 kev range. the line, which has an equivalent width of 120ev, is not compatible with being produced in an absorbing torus with n_h ~10^22 cm^-2, but most likely originates by reflection in an accretion diskviewed at an intermediate inclination angle of ~ 42 deg. the reflectioncomponent is however small (r &lt; 0.7) and so it is not sufficient to steepen thespectrum to photon index values more typical of agns. instead, we find that thedata are more consistent with a flat power law spectrum cut-off at around 100kev plus a small reflection component which could explain the observed ironline. thus ngc 526a is the only bona-fide seyfert 2 galaxy which maintains a"flat spectrum" even when broad band data are considered: in this sense itsproperties, with respect to the general class of seyfert 2's, are analogous tothose of ngc 4151 with respect to the vast majority of seyfert 1's.

astro-ph;0509010	active and passive shielding design optimization and technical solutions  for deep sensitivity hard x-ray focusing telescopes	the 10-100 kev region of the electromagnetic spectrum contains the potentialfor a dramatic improvement in our understanding of a number of key problems inhigh energy astrophysics. a deep inspection of the universe in this band is onthe other hand still lacking because of the demanding sensitivity (fraction ofmicrocrab in the 20-40 kev for 1 ms integration time) and imaging (~15" angularresolution) requirements. the mission ideas currently being proposed are basedon long focal length, grazing incidence, multi-layer optics, coupled with focalplane detectors with few hundreds microns spatial resolution capability. therequired large focal lengths, ranging between 8 and 50 m, can be realized bymeans of extendable optical benches (as foreseen e.g. for the hexit-sat, nextand nustar missions) or formation flight scenarios (e.g. simbol-x and xeus).while the final telescope design will require a detailed trade-off analysisbetween all the relevant parameters (focal length, plate scale value, angularresolution, field of view, detector size, and sensitivity degradation due todetector dead area and telescope vignetting), extreme attention must bededicated to the background minimization. in this respect, key issues arerepresented by the passive baffling system, which in case of large focallengths requires particular design assessments, and by the active/passiveshielding geometries and materials. in this work, the result of a study of theexpected background for a hard x-ray telescope is presented, and itsimplication on the required sensitivity, together with the possibleimplementation design concepts for active and passive shielding in theframework of future satellite missions, are discussed.

astro-ph;0509706	gaw, gamma air watch - a large field of view imaging atmospheric  cherenkov	gaw, acronym for gamma air watch, is a path-finder experiment to test thefeasibility of a new generation of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesthat join high flux sensitivity with large field of view capability. gaw isconceived as an array of three identical imaging telescopes disposed at thevertexes of an equilateral triangle, about 80 m side. two main featurescharacterize gaw with respect to all the existing and presently plannedground-based cherenkov telescopes. the first difference concerns the opticssystem: gaw uses a fresnel refractive lens (2.13 m diameter) as light collectorinstead of classical reflective mirror. the second main difference is thedetection working mode used: the detector at the focal surface operates insingle photoelectron counting mode instead of the usual charge integration one.the gaw array is planned to be located at the calar alto observatory site,spain, 2150 m a.s.l. during its first phase, only 6x6 degrees of the focalplane detector will be implemented; moving it along the field of view, thesensitivity of the telescopes will be tested observing the crab nebula withon-axis and off-axis pointing up to 20 deg and with energy threshold of 300 gevand energy peak of 700 gev. as path-finder, gaw will also monitor the very highenergy activity of some flaring blazars as well as will follow-up glastdetections at high energies. in a second phase, the focal plane will beenlarged to cover a field of view of 24 deg (full); pointing along differentnorth-south directions, gaw would reach a survey of 360x60 degrees region ofthe sky. gaw is a collaboration effort of research institutes in italy,portugal and spain.

astro-ph;0511429	integral and xmm-newton observations of the x-ray pulsar igr  j16320-4751/ax j1631.9-4752	we report on observations of the x-ray pulsar igr j16320-4751 (a.k.a. axj1631.9-4752) performed simultaneously with integral and xmm-newton. we refinethe source position and identify the most likely infrared counterpart. oursimultaneous coverage allows us to confirm the presence of x-ray pulsations at~1300 s, that we detect above 20 kev with integral for the first time. thepulse fraction is consistent with being constant with energy, which iscompatible with a model of polar accretion by a pulsar. we study the spectralproperties of igr j16320-4751 during two major periods occurring during thesimultaneous coverage with both satellites, namely a flare and a non-flareperiod. we detect the presence of a narrow 6.4 kev iron line in both periods.the presence of such a feature is typical of supergiant wind accretors such asvela x-1 or gx 301-2. we inspect the spectral variations with respect to thepulse phase during the non-flare period, and show that the pulse is solely dueto variations of the x-ray flux emitted by the source and not to variations ofthe spectral parameters.  our results are therefore compatible with the source being a pulsar in a highmass x-ray binary. we detect a soft excess appearing in the spectra as ablackbody with a temperature of ~0.07 kev. we discuss the origin of the x-rayemission in igr j16320-4751: while the hard x-rays are likely the result ofcompton emission produced in the close vicinity of the pulsar, based on energyargument we suggest that the soft excess is likely the emission by acollisionally energised cloud in which the compact object is embedded.

astro-ph;0603268	xmm-newton observations of a sample of gamma-ray loud active galactic  nuclei	(abridged) we performed a homogeneous and systematic analysis of simultaneousx-ray and optical/uv properties of a group of 15 gamma-ray loud agn, usingobservations performed with xmm-newton. the sample is composed of 13 blazars (6bl lac and 7 flat-spectrum radio quasar) and 2 radio galaxies, that areassociated with detections at energies &gt;100 mev. the data for 7 of them areanalyzed here for the first time, including the first x-ray observation of pks1406-706. then, the spectral characteristics of the sources in the presentsample have been compared with those in previous catalogs of blazars and otheragn, in order to search for any difference or long term change. all theselected sources appear to follow the classic "blazar sequence" and thespectral energy distributions (sed) built with the present x-ray and optical/uvdata and completed with historical data, confirm the findings of previousstudies on this type of sources. some sources display interesting featuresworth noting: four of them, namely ao 0235+164, pks 1127-145, s5 0836+710 andpks 1830-211 show the presence of an intervening absorption system along theline of sight, but only the latter is known to be surely gravitationallylensed. ao 0235+164 was detected during an outburst and its sed shows a clearshift of the synchrotron peak. 3c 273 shows a change in the state with respectto the previous bepposax observations, that can be interpreted as an increaseof the seyfert-like component and a corresponding decline of the jet emission.this is consistent with the monitoring at radio wavelengths performed duringthe same years. pks 1406-706 is detected with a flux higher than in the past,but with a corresponding low optical flux. moreover, although it is classifiedas fsrq, the sed can be modelled with a simple synchrotron self-compton model.

0809.1230	agile detection of delayed gamma-ray emission from grb 080514b	grb 080514b is the first gamma ray burst (grb), since the time of egret, forwhich individual photons of energy above several tens of mev have been detectedwith a pair-conversion tracker telescope. this burst was discovered with theitalian agile gamma-ray satellite. the grb was localized with a cooperation byagile and the interplanetary network (ipn). the gamma-ray imager (grid)estimate of the position, obtained before the superagile-ipn localization, isfound to be consistent with the burst position. the hard x-ray emissionobserved by superagile lasted about 7 s, while there is evidence that theemission above 30 mev extends for a longer duration (at least ~13 s). similarbehavior was seen in the past from a few other grbs observed with egret.however, the latter measurements were affected, during the brightest phases, byinstrumental dead time effects, resulting in only lower limits to the burstintensity. thanks to the small dead time of the agile/grid we could assess thatin the case of grb 080514b the gamma-ray to x-ray flux ratio changessignificantly between the prompt and extended emission phase.

astro-ph;0604600	simultaneous x-ray and optical observations of s5 0716+714 after the  outburst of march 2004	at the end of march 2004, the blazar s5 0716+714 underwent an opticaloutburst that prompted for quasi-simultaneous target-of-opportunityobservations with the integral and xmm-newton satellites. in this paper, wereport the results of the xmm-newton and integral omc data analysis. the x-rayspectrum is well-represented by a concave broken power-law model, with thebreak at about 2 kev. in the framework of the synchrotron self-compton model,the softer part of the spectrum, which is described by a power law of index$\alpha \simeq 1.8$ ($f_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$), is probably due tosynchrotron emission, while the harder part of the spectrum, which has $\alpha\simeq 1$, is due to inverse compton emission. the blazar shows the long andshort-term variability typical of low-frequency peaked bl lac (lbl): the formeris manifested by a gradual decrease in the optical flux from the peak asobserved by ground telescopes at the end of march 2004, while the latter ischaracterized by soft x-ray and optical flares on time scales from a fewthousand seconds to few hours. we can follow spectral variations on sub-hourtime scales and study their correlation with the flux variability. we findevidence that the peak energy of the time-resolved spectra is increasing withflux. the modeling of the spectral energy distribution compared with archivalobservations suggests that the long-term variability (from outburst toquiescence or viceversa) could be due to a change in the injected power, whilethe short-term variability (flares) could be explained with changes in theslope of the distribution of the electrons.

0809.1737	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3. i. the agile 2007 november  campaign on the "crazy diamond"	[abridged] we report on a multiwavelength observation of the blazar 3c 454.3(which we dubbed "crazy diamond") carried out on november 2007 by means of theastrophysical satellites agile, integral, swift, the webt consortium, and theoptical-nir telescope rem. 3c 454.3 is detected at a $\sim 19-\sigma$ levelduring the 3-week observing period, with an average flux above 100 mev of$f_{\rm e&gt;100mev} = (170 \pm 13) \times 10^{-8}$ \phcmsec. the gamma-rayspectrum can be fit with a single power-law with photon index $\gamma_{\rmgrid} = 1.73 \pm 0.16$ between 100 mev and 1 gev. we detect significantday-by-day variability of the gamma-ray emission during our observations, andwe can exclude that the fluxes are constant at the 99.6% ($\sim 2.9 \sigma$)level. the source was detected typically around 40 degrees off-axis, and it wassubstantially off--axis in the field of view of the agile hard x-ray imager.however, a 5-day long too observation by integral detected 3c 454.3 at anaverage flux of about $f_{\rm 20-200 kev} = 1.49 \times 10^{-3}$ \phcmsec withan average photon index of $\gamma_{\rm ibis} = 1.75 \pm 0.24$ between 20--200kev. swift also detected 3c 454.3 with a flux in the 0.3--10 kev energy band inthe range $(1.23-1.40) \times 10^{-2}$ \phcmsec{} and a photon index in therange $\gamma_{\rm xrt} = 1.56-1.73$. in the optical band, both webt and remshow an extremely variable behavior in the $r$ band. a correlation analysisbased on the entire data set is consistent with no time-lags between thegamma-ray and the optical flux variations. our simultaneous multifrequencyobservations strongly indicate that the dominant emission mechanism between 30mev and 30 gev is dominated by inverse compton scattering of relativisticelectrons in the jet on the external photons from the broad line region.

astro-ph;9902022	bepposax observations of mkn 3: piercing through the torus of a seyfert  2 galaxy	a new bepposax broad-band (0.6-150 kev) spectrum of the seyfert 2 galaxy mkn3 is presented. the spectrum provides a direct measurement of a large, neutralcolumn of gas with nh~10**24 cm**-2 in the source direction. the source, asbright as 3c 273 above 10 kev, has a steep (gamma~1.8) spectrum without anyevidence of a high-energy cutoff up to at least 150 kev. at lower energies, thedata are best modeled with the addition of an unabsorbed reflection component.combining these data with previous ginga and asca observations, the fek$_{\alpha}$ and reflection continuum indicate that the reprocessed emission isresponding slower than the intrinsic continuum variations suggesting a size ofthe reprocessor &gt;= 2 pc. identifying such a reprocessor with a (close toedge-on) obscuring torus, the overall result fits well into unified modelssince, presumably, one can interpret the strong absorption as due totransmission through the rim of the torus and the unabsorbed (directly viewed)reflection component as due to reprocessing from the torus inner surface.
