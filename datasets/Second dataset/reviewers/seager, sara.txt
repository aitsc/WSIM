0907.2931	on the emergent spectra of hot protoplanet collision afterglows	we explore the appearance of terrestrial planets in formation by studying theemergent spectra of hot molten protoplanets during their collisional formation.while such collisions are rare, the surfaces of these bodies may remain hot attemperatures of 1000-3000 k for up to millions of years during the epoch oftheir formation. these object are luminous enough in the thermal infrared to beobservable with current and next generation optical/ir telescopes, providedthat the atmosphere of the forming planet permits astronomers to observebrightness temperatures approaching that of the molten surface. detectabilityof a collisional afterglow depends on properties of the planet's atmosphere --primarily on the mass of the atmosphere. a planet with a thin atmosphere ismore readily detected, because there is little atmosphere to obscure the hotsurface. paradoxically, a more massive atmosphere prevents one from easilyseeing the hot surface, but also keeps the planet hot for a longer time. interms of planetary mass, more massive planets are also easier to detect thansmaller ones because of their larger emitting surface areas. we presentpreliminary calculations assuming a range of protoplanet masses (1-10$m_\earth$), surface pressures (1-1000 bar), and atmospheric compositions, formolten planets with surface temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1800 k, in orderto explore the diversity of emergent spectra that are detectable. while current8- to 10-m class ground-based telescopes may detect hot protoplanets at wideorbital separations beyond 30 au (if they exist), we will likely have to waitfor next-generation extremely large telescopes or improved diffractionsuppression techniques to find terrestrial planets in formation within severalau of their host stars.

0909.3073	detection of planetary emission from the exoplanet tres-2 using spitzer  /irac	we present here the results of our observations of tres-2 using the infraredarray camera on spitzer. we monitored this transiting system during twosecondary eclipses, when the planetary emission is blocked by the star. theresulting decrease in flux is 0.127%+-0.021%, 0.230%+-0.024%, 0.199%+-0.054%,and 0.359%+-0.060%, at 3.6 microns, 4.5 microns, 5.8 microns, and 8.0 microns,respectively. we show that three of these flux contrasts are well fit by ablack body spectrum with t_{eff}=1500 k, as well as by a more detailed modelspectrum of a planetary atmosphere. the observed planet-to-star flux ratios inall four irac channels can be explained by models with and without a thermalinversion in the atmosphere of tres-2, although with different atmosphericchemistry. based on the assumption of thermochemical equilibrium, the chemicalcomposition of the inversion model seems more plausible, making it a morefavorable scenario. tres-2 also falls in the category of highly irradiatedplanets which have been theoretically predicted to exhibit thermal inversions.however, more observations at infrared and visible wavelengths would be neededto confirm a thermal inversion in this system. furthermore, we find that thetimes of the secondary eclipses are consistent with previously published timesof transit and the expectation from a circular orbit. this implies that tres-2most likely has a circular orbit, and thus does not obtain additional thermalenergy from tidal dissipation of a non-zero orbital eccentricity, a proposedexplanation for the large radius of this planet.

0912.2132	studying the atmosphere of the exoplanet hat-p-7b via secondary eclipse  measurements with epoxi, spitzer and kepler	the highly irradiated transiting exoplanet, hat-p-7b, currently provides oneof the best opportunities for studying planetary emission in the optical andinfrared wavelengths. we observe six near-consecutive secondary eclipses ofhat-p-7b at optical wavelengths with the epoxi spacecraft. we place an upperlimit on the relative eclipse depth of 0.055% (95% confidence). we also analyzespitzer observations of the same target in the infrared, obtaining secondaryeclipse depths of 0.098+/-0.017%, 0.159+/-0.022%, 0.245+/-0.031% and0.225+/-0.052% in the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 micron irac bands respectively. wecombine these measurements with the recently published kepler secondary eclipsemeasurement, and generate atmospheric models for the day-side of the planetthat are consistent with both the optical and infrared measurements. the dataare best fit by models with a temperature inversion, as expected from the highincident flux. the models predict a low optical albedo of ~&lt; 0.13, withsubsolar abundances of na, k, tio and vo. we also find that the best fittingmodels predict that 10% of the absorbed stellar flux is redistributed to thenight side of the planet, which is qualitatively consistent with theinefficient day-night redistribution apparent in the kepler phase curve. modelswithout thermal inversions fit the data only at the 1.25 sigma level, and alsorequire an overabundance of methane, which is not expected in the very hotatmosphere of hat-p-7b. we also analyze the eight transits of hat-p-7b presentin the epoxi dataset and improve the constraints on the system parameters,finding a period of p = 2.2047308+/-0.0000025 days, a stellar radius of r* =1.824+/-0.089rsun, a planetary radius of rp = 1.342+/-0.068rjup and aninclination of i = 85.7+3.5-2.2 deg.

1002.3168	transit probabilities for stars with stellar inclination constraints	the probability that an exoplanet transits its host star is high for planetsin close orbits, but drops off rapidly for increasing semimajor axes. thismakes transit surveys for planets with large semimajor axes orbiting brightstars impractical, since one would need to continuously observe hundreds ofstars that are spread out over the entire sky. one way to make such a surveytractable is to constrain the inclination of the stellar rotation axes inadvance, and thereby enhance the transit probabilities. we derive transitprobabilities for stars with stellar inclination constraints, considering areasonable range of planetary system inclinations. we find that stellarinclination constraints can improve the transit probability by almost an orderof magnitude for habitable-zone planets. when applied to an ensemble of stars,such constraints dramatically lower the number of stars that need to beobserved in a targeted transit survey. we also consider multiplanet systemswhere only one planet has an identified transit, and derive the transitprobabilities for the second planet assuming a range of mutual planetaryinclinations.

1102.4345	rotational variability of earth's polar regions: implications for  detecting snowball planets	we have obtained the first time-resolved, disc-integrated observations ofearth's poles with the deep impact spacecraft as part of the epoxi mission ofopportunity. these data mimic what we will see when we point next-generationspace telescopes at nearby exoplanets. we use principal component analysis(pca) and rotational lightcurve inversion to characterize color inhomogeneitiesand map their spatial distribution from these unusual vantage points, as acomplement to the equatorial views presented in cowan et al. (2009). we alsoperform the same pca on a suite of simulated rotational multi-band lightcurvesfrom nasa's virtual planetary laboratory 3d spectral earth model. thisnumerical experiment allows us to understand what sorts of surface features pcacan robustly identify. we find that the epoxi polar observations have similarbroadband colors as the equatorial earth, but with 20-30% greater apparentalbedo. this is because the polar observations are most sensitive tomid-latitudes, which tend to be more cloudy than the equatorial latitudesemphasized by the original epoxi earth observations. the cloudiness of themid-latitudes also manifests itself in the form of increased variability atshort wavelengths in the polar observations, and as a dominant gray eigencolorin the south polar observation. we construct a simple reflectance model for asnowball earth. by construction, our model has a higher bond albedo than themodern earth; its surface albedo is so high that rayleigh scattering does notnoticeably affect its spectrum. the rotational color variations occur at shortwavelengths due to the large contrast between glacier ice and bare land inthose wavebands. thus we find that both the broadband colors and diurnal colorvariations of such a planet would be easily distinguishable from the modern-dayearth, regardless of viewing angle.

1105.5143	the high albedo of the hot jupiter kepler-7b	hot jupiters are expected to be dark from both observations (albedo upperlimits) and theory (alkali metals and/or tio and vo absorption). however, onlya handful of hot jupiters have been observed with high enough photometricprecision at visible wavelengths to investigate these expectations. the nasakepler mission provides a means to widen the sample and to assess the extent towhich hot jupiter albedos are low. we present a global analysis of kepler-7bbased on q0-q4 data, published radial velocities, and asteroseismologyconstraints. we measure an occultation depth in the kepler bandpass of 44+-5ppm. if directly related to the albedo, this translates to a kepler geometricalbedo of 0.32+-0.03, the most precise value measured so far for an exoplanet.we also characterize the planetary orbital phase lightcurve with an amplitudeof 42+-4 ppm. using atmospheric models, we find it unlikely that the highalbedo is due to a dominant thermal component and propose two solutions toexplain the observed planetary flux. firstly, we interpret the kepler-7b albedoas resulting from an excess reflection over what can be explained solely byrayleigh scattering, along with a nominal thermal component. this excessreflection might indicate the presence of a cloud or haze layer in theatmosphere, motivating new modeling and observational efforts. alternatively,the albedo can be explained by rayleigh scattering alone if na and k aredepleted in the atmosphere by a factor of 10-100 below solar abundances.

1106.2807	formation and structure of low density exo-neptunes	kepler has found hundreds of neptune-size (2-6 r_earth) planet candidateswithin 0.5 au of their stars. the nature of the vast majority of these planetsis not known because their masses have not been measured. using theoreticalmodels of planet formation, evolution and structure, we explore the range ofminimum plausible masses for low-density exo-neptunes. we focus on highlyirradiated planets with t_eq&gt;=500k. we consider two separate formation pathwaysfor low-mass planets with voluminous atmospheres of light gases: core nucleatedaccretion and outgassing of hydrogen from dissociated ices. we show thatneptune-size planets at t_eq=500k with masses as small as a few times that ofearth can plausibly be formed core nucleated accretion coupled with subsequentinward migration. we also derive a limiting low-density mass-radius relationfor rocky planets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes but no surface water. rockyplanets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes typically have computed radii wellbelow 3 r_earth. for both planets with h/he envelopes from core nucleatedaccretion and planets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes, we employ planetinterior models to map the range of planet mass--envelope mass--equilibriumtemperature parameter space that is consistent with neptune-size planet radii.atmospheric mass loss mediates which corners of this parameter space arepopulated by actual planets and ultimately governs the minimum plausible massat a specified transit radius. we find that kepler's 2-6 r_earth planetcandidates at t_eq=500--1000k could potentially have masses less than ~4m_earth. although our quantitative results depend on several assumptions, ourqualitative finding that warm neptune-size planets can have massessubstantially smaller than those given by interpolating the masses and radii ofplanets within our solar system is robust.

1107.5750	the hot-jupiter kepler-17b: discovery, obliquity from stroboscopic  starspots, and atmospheric characterization	this paper reports the discovery and characterization of the transiting hotgiant exoplanet kepler-17b. the planet has an orbital period of 1.486 days, andradial velocity measurements from the hobby-eberly telescope (het) show adoppler signal of 420+/-15 m.s-1. from a transit-based estimate of the hoststar's mean density, combined with an estimate of the stellar effectivetemperature t_eff=5630+/-100 k from high-resolution spectra, we infer a stellarhost mass of 1.061+/-0.067 m_sun and a stellar radius of 1.019+/-0.033 r_jup.we estimate the planet mass and radius to be mp=2.450+/-0.114 m_jup andrp=1.312+/-0.018 r_jup and a planet density near 1.35 g.cm-3. the host star isactive, with dark spots that are frequently occulted by the planet. thecontinuous monitoring of the star reveals a stellar rotation period of 11.89days, 8 times the the planet's orbital period; this period ratio producesstroboscopic effects on the occulted starspots. the temporal pattern of thesespot-crossing events shows that the planet's orbit is prograde and the star'sobliquity is smaller than 15 deg. we detected planetary occultations ofkepler-17b with both the kepler and spitzer space telescopes. we use theseobservations to constrain the eccentricity, e, and find that it is consistentwith a circular orbit (e&lt;0.0011). the brightness temperatures of the planet theinfrared bandpasses are t_3.6um=1880+/-100 k and t4.5um=1770+/-150 k. wemeasure the optical geometric albedo a_g in the kepler bandpass and find a_g =0.10+/-0.02. the observations are best described by atmospheric models forwhich most of the incident energy is re-radiated away from the day side.

1109.0582	the optical and near-infrared transmission spectrum of the super-earth  gj1214b: further evidence for a metal-rich atmosphere	we present an investigation of the transmission spectrum of the 6.5 m_earthplanet gj1214b based on new ground-based observations of transits of the planetin the optical and near-infrared, and on previously published data.observations with the vlt+fors and magellan+mmirs using the technique ofmulti-object spectroscopy with wide slits yielded new measurements of theplanet's transmission spectrum from 0.61 to 0.85 micron, and in the j, h, and katmospheric windows. we also present a new measurement based on narrow-bandphotometry centered at 2.09 micron with the vlt+hawki. we combined these datawith results from a re-analysis of previously published fors data from 0.78 to1.00 micron using an improved data reduction algorithm, and previously reportedvalues based on spitzer data at 3.6 and 4.5 micron. all of the data areconsistent with a featureless transmission spectrum for the planet. our k-banddata are inconsistent with the detection of spectral features at thesewavelengths reported by croll and collaborators at the level of 4.1 sigma. theplanet's atmosphere must either have at least 70% water by mass or opticallythick high-altitude clouds or haze to be consistent with the data.

1109.1611	discovery and atmospheric characterization of giant planet kepler-12b:  an inflated radius outlier	we report the discovery of planet kepler-12b (koi-20), which at 1.695\pm0.030rj is among the handful of planets with super-inflated radii above 1.65 rj.orbiting its slightly evolved g0 host with a 4.438-day period, this0.431\pm0.041 mj planet is the least-irradiated within thislargest-planet-radius group, which has important implications for planetaryphysics. the planet's inflated radius and low mass lead to a very low densityof 0.111\pm0.010 g cm-3. we detect the occultation of the planet at asignificance of 3.7{\sigma} in the kepler bandpass. this yields a geometricalbedo of 0.14\pm0.04; the planetary flux is due to a combination of scatteredlight and emitted thermal flux. we use multiple observations with warm spitzerto detect the occultation at 7{\sigma} and 4{\sigma} in the 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}mbandpasses, respectively. the occultation photometry timing is consistent witha circular orbit, at e &lt; 0.01 (1{\sigma}), and e &lt; 0.09 (3{\sigma}). theoccultation detections across the three bands favor an atmospheric model withno dayside temperature inversion. the kepler occultation detection providessignificant leverage, but conclusions regarding temperature structure arepreliminary, given our ignorance of opacity sources at optical wavelengths inhot jupiter atmospheres. if kepler-12b and hd 209458b, which intercept similarincident stellar fluxes, have the same heavy element masses, the interiorenergy source needed to explain the large radius of kepler-12b is three timeslarger than that of hd 209458b. this may suggest that more than oneradius-inflation mechanism is at work for kepler-12b, or that it is lessheavy-element rich than other transiting planets.

1110.6180	lack of inflated radii for kepler giant planet candidates receiving  modest stellar irradiation	the most irradiated transiting hot jupiters are characterized by anomalouslyinflated radii, sometimes exceeding jupiter's size by more than 60%. whiledifferent theoretical explanations have been applied, none of them provide auniversal resolution to this observation, despite significant progress in thepast years. we refine the photometric transit light curve analysis of 115kepler giant planet candidates based on public q0-q2 photometry. we find that14% of them are likely false positives, based on their secondary eclipse depth.we report on planet radii vs. stellar flux. we find an increase in planet radiiwith increased stellar irradiation for the kepler giant planet candidates, ingood agreement with existing hot jupiter systems. we find that in the case ofmodest irradiation received from the stellar host, giant planets do not haveinflated radii, and appear to have radii independent of the host star incidentflux. this finding suggests that the physical mechanisms inflating hot jupitersbecome ineffective below a given orbit-averaged stellar irradiation level of ~210^8 erg s^-1 cm^-2.

1112.4514	kepler-20: a sun-like star with three sub-neptune exoplanets and two  earth-size candidates	we present the discovery of the kepler-20 planetary system, which weinitially identified through the detection of five distinct periodic transitsignals in the kepler light curve of the host star 2massj19104752+4220194. wefind a stellar effective temperature teff=5455+-100k, a metallicity of[fe/h]=0.01+-0.04, and a surface gravity of log(g)=4.4+-0.1. combined with anestimate of the stellar density from the transit light curves we deduce astellar mass of mstar=0.912+-0.034 msun and a stellar radius ofrstar=0.944^{+0.060}_{-0.095} rsun. for three of the transit signals, ourresults strongly disfavor the possibility that these result from astrophysicalfalse positives. we conclude that the planetary scenario is more likely thanthat of an astrophysical false positive by a factor of 2e5 (kepler-20b), 1e5(kepler-20c), and 1.1e3 (kepler-20d), sufficient to validate these objects asplanetary companions. for kepler-20c and kepler-20d, the blend scenario isindependently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: from spitzer datagathered at 4.5um, we infer a ratio of the planetary to stellar radii of0.075+-0.015 (kepler-20c) and 0.065+-0.011 (kepler-20d), consistent with eachof the depths measured in the kepler optical bandpass. we determine the orbitalperiods and physical radii of the three confirmed planets to be 3.70d and1.91^{+0.12}_{-0.21} rearth for kepler-20b, 10.85 d and 3.07^{+0.20}_{-0.31}rearth for kepelr-20c, and 77.61 d and 2.75^{+0.17}_{-0.30} rearth forkepler-20d. from multi-epoch radial velocities, we determine the masses ofkepler-20b and kepler-20c to be 8.7\+-2.2 mearth and 16.1+-3.5 mearth,respectively, and we place an upper limit on the mass of kepler-20d of 20.1mearth (2 sigma).

1112.4550	two earth-sized planets orbiting kepler-20	since the discovery of the first extrasolar giant planets around sun-likestars, evolving observational capabilities have brought us closer to thedetection of true earth analogues. the size of an exoplanet can be determinedwhen it periodically passes in front of (transits) its parent star, causing adecrease in starlight proportional to its radius. the smallest exoplanethitherto discovered has a radius 1.42 times that of the earth's radius (rearth), and hence has 2.9 times its volume. here we report the discovery of twoplanets, one earth-sized (1.03r earth) and the other smaller than the earth(0.87r earth), orbiting the star kepler-20, which is already known to hostthree other, larger, transiting planets. the gravitational pull of the newplanets on the parent star is too small to measure with currentinstrumentation. we apply a statistical method to show that the likelihood ofthe planetary interpretation of the transit signals is more than three ordersof magnitude larger than that of the alternative hypothesis that the signalsresult from an eclipsing binary star. theoretical considerations imply thatthese planets are rocky, with a composition of iron and silicate. the outerplanet could have developed a thick water vapour atmosphere.

1202.3829	towards consistent mapping of distant worlds: secondary-eclipse scanning  of the exoplanet hd189733b	mapping distant worlds is the next frontier for exoplanet infrared photometrystudies. ultimately, constraining spatial and temporal properties of anexoplanet atmosphere will provide further insight into its physics. fortidally-locked hot jupiters that transit and are eclipsed by their host star,the first steps are now possible.  our aim is to constrain an exoplanet's shape, brightness distribution (bd)and system parameters from its light curve. notably, we rely on the eclipsescanning.  we use archived spitzer 8-{\mu}m data of hd189733 (6 transits, 8 secondaryeclipses, and a phase curve) in a global mcmc procedure for mitigatingsystematics. we also include hd189733's out-of-transit radial velocitymeasurements.  we find a 6-{\sigma} deviation from the expected occultation of auniformly-bright disk. this deviation emerges mainly from hd189733b's thermalpattern, not from its shape. we indicate that the correlation of the orbitaleccentricity, e, and bd (uniform time offset) does also depend on the stellardensity, \rho*, and the impact parameter, b (e-b-\rho*-bd correlation). forhd189733b, we find that relaxing the e-constraint and using more complex bdslead to lower stellar/planetary densities and a more localized andlatitudinally-shifted hot spot. we obtain an improved constraint on the upperlimit of hd189733b's orbital eccentricity, e&lt;0.011 (95%), when including the rvmeasurements.  our study provides new insights into the analysis of exoplanet light curvesand a proper framework for future eclipse-scanning observations. observationsof the same exoplanet at different wavelengths will improve the constraints onits system parameters while ultimately yielding a large-scale time-dependent 3dmap of its atmosphere. finally, we discuss the perspective of extending ourmethod to observations in the visible, in particular to better understandexoplanet albedos.

1203.4018	atmospheric retrieval for super-earths: uniquely constraining the  atmospheric composition with transmission spectroscopy	we present a retrieval method based on bayesian analysis to infer theatmospheric compositions and surface or cloud-top pressures from transmissionspectra of exoplanets with general compositions. in this study, we identifywhat can unambiguously be determined about the atmospheres of exoplanets fromtheir transmission spectra by applying the retrieval method to syntheticobservations of the super-earth gj 1214b. our approach to infer constraints onatmospheric parameters is to compute their joint and marginal posteriorprobability distributions using the mcmc technique in a parallel temperingscheme. a new atmospheric parameterization is introduced that is applicable togeneral atmospheres in which the main constituent is not known a priori andclouds may be present. our main finding is that a unique constraint of themixing ratios of the absorbers and up to two spectrally inactive gases (such asn2 and primordial h2+he) is possible if the observations are sufficient toquantify both (1) the broadband transit depths in at least one absorptionfeature for each absorber and (2) the slope and strength of the molecularrayleigh scattering signature. the surface or cloud-top pressure can bequantified if a surface or cloud deck is present. the mean molecular mass canbe constrained from the rayleigh slope or the shapes of absorption features,thus enabling to distinguish between cloudy hydrogen-rich atmospheres and highmean molecular mass atmospheres. we conclude, however, that without thesignature of rayleigh scattering--even with robustly detected infraredabsorption features--there is no reliable way to tell if the absorber is themain constituent of the atmosphere or just a minor species with a mixing ratioof &lt;0.1%. the retrieval method leads us to a conceptual picture of whichdetails in transmission spectra are essential for unique characterizations ofwell-mixed atmospheres.

1204.1544	theoretical spectra of terrestrial exoplanet surfaces	we investigate spectra of airless rocky exoplanets with a theoreticalframework that self-consistently treats reflection and thermal emission. wefind that a silicate surface on an exoplanet is spectroscopically detectablevia prominent si-o features in the thermal emission bands of 7 - 13 \mu m and15 - 25 \mu m. the variation of brightness temperature due to the silicatefeatures can be up to 20 k for an airless earth analog, and the silicatefeatures are wide enough to be distinguished from atmospheric features withrelatively high-resolution spectra. the surface characterization thus providesa method to unambiguously identify a rocky exoplanet. furthermore,identification of specific rocky surface types is possible with the planet'sreflectance spectrum in near-infrared broad bands. a key parameter to observeis the difference between k band and j band geometric albedos (a_g (k)-a_g(j)): a_g (k)-a_g (j) &gt; 0.2 indicates that more than half of the planet'ssurface has abundant mafic minerals, such as olivine and pyroxene, in otherwords primary crust from a magma ocean or high-temperature lavas; a_g (k)-a_g(j) &lt; -0.09 indicates that more than half of the planet's surface is covered orpartially covered by water ice or hydrated silicates, implying extant or pastwater on its surface. also, surface water ice can be specifically distinguishedby an h-band geometric albedo lower than the j-band geometric albedo. thesurface features can be distinguished from possible atmospheric features withmolecule identification of atmospheric species by transmission spectroscopy. wetherefore propose that mid-infrared spectroscopy of exoplanets may detect rockysurfaces, and near-infrared spectrophotometry may identify ultramafic surfaces,hydrated surfaces and water ice.

1205.1766	detection of thermal emission from a super-earth	we report on the detection of infrared light from the super-earth 55 cnc e,based on four occultations obtained with warm spitzer at 4.5 microns. our dataanalysis consists of a two-part process. in a first step, we perform individualanalyses of each dataset and compare several baseline models to optimallyaccount for the systematics affecting each lightcurve. we apply independentphotometric correction techniques, including polynomial detrending andpixel-mapping, that yield consistent results at the 1-sigma level. in a secondstep, we perform a global mcmc analysis including all four datasets, thatyields an occultation depth of 131+-28ppm, translating to a brightnesstemperature of 2360+-300 k in the irac-4.5 micron channel. this occultationdepth suggests a low bond albedo coupled to an inefficient heat transport fromthe planetary dayside to the nightside, or else possibly that the 4.5-micronobservations probe atmospheric layers that are hotter than the maximumequilibrium temperature (i.e., a thermal inversion layer or a deep hot layer).the measured occultation phase and duration are consistent with a circularorbit and improves the 3-sigma upper limit on 55 cnc e's orbital eccentricityfrom 0.25 to 0.06.

1210.6885	photochemistry in terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres i: photochemistry  model and benchmark cases	we present a comprehensive photochemistry model for exploration of thechemical composition of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres. the photochemistrymodel is designed from the ground up to have the capacity to treat all types ofterrestrial planet atmospheres, ranging from oxidizing through reducing, whichmakes the code suitable for applications for the wide range of anticipatedterrestrial exoplanet compositions. the one-dimensional chemical transportmodel treats up to 800 chemical reactions, photochemical processes, dry and wetdeposition, surface emission and thermal escape of o, h, c, n and s bearingspecies, as well as formation and deposition of elemental sulfur and sulfuricacid aerosols. we validate the model by computing the atmospheric compositionof current earth and mars and find agreement with observations of major tracegases in earth's and mars' atmospheres. we simulate several plausibleatmospheric scenarios of terrestrial exoplanets, and choose three benchmarkcases for atmospheres from reducing to oxidizing. the most interesting findingis that atomic hydrogen is always a more abundant reactive radical than thehydroxyl radical in anoxic atmospheres. whether atomic hydrogen is the mostimportant removal path for a molecule of interest also depends on the relevantreaction rates. we also find that volcanic carbon compounds (i.e., ch4 and co2)are chemically long-lived and tend to be well mixed in both reducing andoxidizing atmospheres, and their dry deposition velocities to the surfacecontrol the atmospheric oxidation states. furthermore, we revisit whetherphotochemically produced oxygen can cause false positives for detectingoxygenic photosynthesis, and find that in 1-bar co2-rich atmospheres oxygen andozone may build up to levels that have been previously considered uniquesignatures of life, if there is no surface emission of reducing gases...

1302.1141	infrared transmission spectroscopy of the exoplanets hd209458b and xo-1b  using the wide field camera-3 on the hubble space telescope	exoplanetary transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared usinghubble/nicmos is currently ambiguous because different observational groupsclaim different results from the same data, depending on their analysismethodologies. spatial scanning with hubble/wfc3 provides an opportunity toresolve this ambiguity. we here report wfc3 spectroscopy of the giant planetshd209458b and xo-1b in transit, using spatial scanning mode for maximumphoton-collecting efficiency. we introduce an analysis technique that derivesthe exoplanetary transmission spectrum without the necessity of explicitlydecorrelating instrumental effects, and achieves nearly photon-limitedprecision even at the high flux levels collected in spatial scan mode. ourerrors are within 6-percent (xo-1) and 26-percent (hd209458b) of thephoton-limit at a spectral resolving power of 70, and are better than0.01-percent per spectral channel. both planets exhibit water absorption ofapproximately 200 ppm at the water peak near 1.38 microns. our result for xo-1bcontradicts the much larger absorption derived from nicmos spectroscopy. theweak water absorption we measure for hd209458b is reminiscent of the weaknessof sodium absorption in the first transmission spectroscopy of an exoplanetatmosphere by charbonneau et al. (2002). model atmospheres havinguniformly-distributed extra opacity of 0.012 cm^2 per gram accountapproximately for both our water measurement and the sodium absorption in thisplanet. our results for hd209458b support the picture advocated by pont et al.(2013) in which weak molecular absorptions are superposed on a transmissionspectrum that is dominated by continuous opacity due to haze and/or dust.however, the extra opacity needed for hd209458b is grayer than for hd189733b,with a weaker rayleigh component.

1302.6603	photochemistry in terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres ii: h2s and so2  photochemistry in anoxic atmospheres	sulfur gases are common components in the volcanic and biological emission onearth, and are expected to be important input gases for atmospheres onterrestrial exoplanets. we study the atmospheric composition and the spectra ofterrestrial exoplanets with sulfur compounds (i.e., h2s and so2) emitted fromtheir surfaces. we use a comprehensive one-dimensional photochemistry model andradiative transfer model to investigate the sulfur chemistry in atmospheresranging from reducing to oxidizing. the most important finding is that both h2sand so2 are chemically short-lived in virtually all types of atmospheres onterrestrial exoplanets, based on models of h2, n2, and co2 atmospheres. thisimplies that direct detection of surface sulfur emission is unlikely, as theirsurface emission rates need to be extremely high (&gt;1000 times earth's volcanicsulfur emission) for these gases to build up to a detectable level. we alsofind that sulfur compounds emitted from the surface lead to photochemicalformation of elemental sulfur and sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, which wouldcondense to form aerosols if saturated. for terrestrial exoplanets in thehabitable zone of sun-like stars or m stars, earth-like sulfur emission ratesresult in optically thick haze composed of elemental sulfur in reducingh2-dominated atmospheres for a wide range of particle diameters (0.1-1 micron),which is assumed as a free parameter in our simulations. in oxidizedatmospheres composed of n2 and co2, optically thick haze, composed of elementalsulfur aerosols (s8) or sulfuric acid aerosols (h2so4), will form if thesurface sulfur emission is 2 orders of magnitude more than the volcanic sulfuremission of earth. although direct detection of h2s and so2 by their spectralfeatures is unlikely, their emission might be inferred by observingaerosol-related features in reflected light with future generation spacetelescopes.

1303.2150	the mass of koi-94d and a relation for planet radius, mass, and incident  flux	we measure the mass of a modestly irradiated giant planet, koi-94d. we wishto determine whether this planet, which is in a 22-day orbit and receives 2700times as much incident flux as jupiter, is as dense as jupiter or rarefied likeinflated hot jupiters. koi-94 also hosts 3 smaller transiting planets, all ofwhich were detected by the kepler mission. with 26 radial velocities of koi-94from the w. m. keck observatory and a simultaneous fit to the kepler lightcurve, we measure the mass of the giant planet and determine that it is notinflated. support for the planetary interpretation of the other threecandidates comes from gravitational interactions through transit timingvariations, the statistical robustness of multi-planet systems against falsepositives, and several lines of evidence that no other star resides within thephotometric aperture. the radial velocity analyses of koi-94b and koi-94e offermarginal (&gt;2\sigma) mass detections, whereas the observations of koi-94c offeronly an upper limit to its mass. using the koi-94 system and other planets withpublished values for both mass and radius (138 exoplanets total, including 35with m &lt; 150 earth masses), we establish two fundamental planes for exoplanetsthat relate their mass, incident flux, and radius from a few earth masses up toten jupiter masses. these equations can be used to predict the radius or massof a planet.

1304.3714	towards the minimum inner edge distance of the habitable zone	we explore the minimum distance from a host star where an exoplanet couldpotentially be habitable in order not to discard close-in rocky exoplanets forfollow-up observations. we find that the inner edge of the habitable zone forhot desert worlds can be as close as 0.38 au around a solar-like star, if thegreenhouse effect is reduced ($\sim$ 1% relative humidity) and the surfacealbedo is increased. we consider a wide range of atmospheric and planetaryparameters such as the mixing ratios of greenhouse gases (water vapor andco$_2$), surface albedo, pressure and gravity. intermediate surface pressure($\sim$1-10 bars) is necessary to limit water loss and to simultaneouslysustain an active water cycle. we additionally find that the water losstimescale is influenced by the atmospheric co$_2$ level, because it indirectlyinfluences the stratospheric water mixing ratio. if the co$_2$ mixing ratio ofdry planets at the inner edge is smaller than 10$^{-4}$, the water losstimescale is $\sim$1 billion years, which is considered here too short for lifeto evolve. we also show that the expected transmission spectra of hot desertworlds are similar to an earth-like planet. therefore, an instrument designedto identify biosignature gases in an earth-like atmosphere can also identifysimilarly abundant gases in the atmospheres of dry planets. our inner edgelimit is closer to the host star than previous estimates. as a consequence, theoccurrence rate of potentially habitable planets is larger than previouslythought.

1306.6325	how to distinguish between cloudy mini-neptunes and  water/volatile-dominated super-earths	one of the most profound questions about the newly discovered class oflow-density super-earths is whether these exoplanets are predominatelyh2-dominated mini-neptunes or volatile-rich worlds with gas envelopes dominatedby h2o, co2, co, ch4, or n2. transit observations of the super-earth gj 1214brule out a cloud-free h2-dominated atmosphere, but are not able to determinewhether the lack of deep spectral features is due to high-altitude clouds orthe presence of a high mean molecular mass atmosphere. here, we demonstratethat one can unambiguously distinguish between cloudy mini-neptunes andvolatile-dominated worlds based on the differences in the wing steepness andrelative depths of water absorption features in moderate-resolution nirtransmission spectra (r~100). in a numerical retrieval study, we show for gj1214b that an unambiguous distinction between a cloudy h2-dominated atmosphereand cloud-free h2 atmosphere will be possible if the uncertainties in thespectral transit depth measurements can be reduced by a factor of ~3 comparedto the published hst wfc3 and vlt transit observations. we argue that therequired precision for the distinction may be achievable with currentlyavailable instrumentation by stacking 10-15 transit observations. we provide ascaling law that scales our quantitative results to other transitingsuper-earths and neptunes such as hd 97658b, 55 cnc e, and gj 436b. theanalysis is performed using an improved version of our bayesian atmosphericretrieval framework. the new framework not only constrains the gas compositionand cloud/haze parameters, but also determines our confidence in havingdetected molecules and cloud/haze species through bayesian model comparison.using the bayesian tool, we demonstrate quantitatively that the subtle transitdepth variation in the berta et al.

1309.7894	inference of inhomogeneous clouds in an exoplanet atmosphere	we present new visible and infrared observations of the hot jupiter kepler-7bto determine its atmospheric properties. our analysis allows us to 1) refinekepler-7b's relatively large geometric albedo of ag=0.35+-0.02, 2) place upperlimits on kepler-7b thermal emission that remains undetected in both spitzerbandpasses and 3) report a westward shift in the kepler optical phase curve. weargue that kepler-7b's visible flux cannot be due to thermal emission orrayleigh scattering from h2 molecules. we therefore conclude that highaltitude, optically reflective clouds located west from the substellar pointare present in its atmosphere. we find that a silicate-based cloud compositionis a possible candidate. kepler-7b exhibits several properties that may make itparticularly amenable to cloud formation in its upper atmosphere. these includea hot deep atmosphere that avoids a cloud cold trap, very low surface gravityto suppress cloud sedimentation, and a planetary equilibrium temperature in arange that allows for silicate clouds to potentially form in the visibleatmosphere probed by kepler. our analysis does not only present evidence ofoptically thick clouds on kepler-7b but also yields the first map of clouds inan exoplanet atmosphere.

1401.0022	clouds in the atmosphere of the super-earth exoplanet gj 1214b	recent surveys have revealed that planets intermediate in size between earthand neptune ("super-earths") are among the most common planets in the galaxy.atmospheric studies are the next step toward developing a comprehensiveunderstanding of this new class of object. much effort has been focused onusing transmission spectroscopy to characterize the atmosphere of thesuper-earth archetype gj 1214b, but previous observations did not havesufficient precision to distinguish between two interpretations for theatmosphere. the planet's atmosphere could be dominated by relatively heavymolecules, such as water (e.g., a 100% water vapor composition), or it couldcontain high-altitude clouds that obscure its lower layers. here we report ameasurement of the transmission spectrum of gj 1214b at near-infraredwavelengths that definitively resolves this ambiguity. these data, obtainedwith the hubble space telescope, are sufficiently precise to detect absorptionfeatures from a high mean molecular mass atmosphere. the observed spectrum,however, is featureless. we rule out cloud-free atmospheric models with water-,methane-, carbon monoxide-, nitrogen-, or carbon dioxide-dominated compositionsat greater than 5$\sigma$ confidence. the planet's atmosphere must containclouds to be consistent with the data.

1401.0948	photochemistry in terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres iii: photochemistry  and thermochemistry in thick atmospheres on super earths and mini neptunes	some super earths and mini neptunes will likely have thick atmospheres thatare not h2-dominated. we have developed a photochemistry-thermochemistrykinetic-transport model for exploring the compositions of thick atmospheres onsuper earths and mini neptunes, applicable for both h2-dominated atmospheresand non-h2-dominated atmospheres. using this model to study thick atmospheresfor wide ranges of temperatures and elemental abundances, we classify them intohydrogen-rich atmospheres, water-rich atmospheres, oxygen-rich atmospheres, andhydrocarbon-rich atmospheres. we find that carbon has to be in the form of co2rather than ch4 or co in a h2-depleted water-dominated thick atmosphere, andthat the preferred loss of light elements from an oxygen-poor carbon-richatmosphere leads to formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons (c2h2 and c2h4). weapply our self-consistent atmosphere models to compute spectra and diagnosticfeatures for known transiting low-mass exoplanets gj 1214 b, hd 97658 b, and 55cnc e. for gj 1214 b like planets we find that (1) c2h2 features at 1.0 and 1.5micron in transmission and c2h2 and c2h4 features at 9-14 micron in thermalemission are diagnostic for hydrocarbon-rich atmospheres; (2) a detection ofwater-vapor features and a confirmation of nonexistence of methane featureswould provide sufficient evidence for a water-dominated atmosphere. in general,our simulations show that chemical stability has to be taken into account wheninterpreting the spectrum of a super earth/mini neptune. water-dominatedatmospheres only exist for carbon to oxygen ratios much lower than the solarratio, suggesting that this kind of atmospheres could be rare.

1410.2255	a precise water abundance measurement for the hot jupiter wasp-43b	the water abundance in a planetary atmosphere provides a key constraint onthe planet's primordial origins because water ice is expected to play animportant role in the core accretion model of planet formation. however, thewater content of the solar system giant planets is not well known because wateris sequestered in clouds deep in their atmospheres. by contrast, short-periodexoplanets have such high temperatures that their atmospheres have water in thegas phase, making it possible to measure the water abundance for these objects.we present a precise determination of the water abundance in the atmosphere ofthe 2 $m_\mathrm{jup}$ short-period exoplanet wasp-43b based on thermalemission and transmission spectroscopy measurements obtained with the hubblespace telescope. we find the water content is consistent with the valueexpected in a solar composition gas at planetary temperatures (0.4-3.5x solarat 1 $\sigma$ confidence). the metallicity of wasp-43b's atmosphere suggestedby this result extends the trend observed in the solar system of lower metalenrichment for higher planet masses.

1503.03173	low false-positive rate of kepler candidates estimated from a  combination of spitzer and follow-up observations	(abridged) nasa's kepler mission has provided several thousand transitingplanet candidates, yet only a small subset have been confirmed as true planets.therefore, the most fundamental question about these candidates is the fractionof bona fide planets. estimating the rate of false positives of the overallkepler sample is necessary to derive the planet occurrence rate. we present theresults from two large observational campaigns that were conducted with thespitzer telescope during the the kepler mission. these observations arededicated to estimating the false positive rate (fpr) amongst the keplercandidates. we select a sub-sample of 51 candidates, spanning wide ranges instellar, orbital and planetary parameter space, and we observe their transitswith spitzer at 4.5 microns. we use these observations to measures thecandidate's transit depths and infrared magnitudes. a bandpass-dependent depthalerts us to the potential presence of a blending star that could be the sourceof the observed eclipse: a false-positive scenario. for most of the candidates(85%), the transit depths measured with kepler are consistent with the depthsmeasured with spitzer as expected for planetary objects, while we find that themost discrepant measurements are due to the presence of unresolved stars thatdilute the photometry. the spitzer constraints on their own yield fprs between5-40%, depending on the kois. by considering the population of the kepler fieldstars, and by combining follow-up observations (imaging) when available, wefind that the overall fpr of our sample is low. the measured upper limit on thefpr of our sample is 8.8% at a confidence level of 3 sigma. this observationalresult, which uses the achromatic property of planetary transit signals that isnot investigated by the kepler observations, provides an independent indicationthat kepler's false positive rate is low.

astro-ph;0103329	atmospheric lensing and oblateness effects during an extrasolar  planetary transit	future high precision photometric measurements of transiting extrasolarplanets promise to tell us much about the nature of these systems. we examinehow atmospheric lensing and (projected) planet oblateness/ellipticity modifytransit light curves. the large density gradients expected in planetatmospheres can offset the unfavorably large observer-lens to source-lensdistance ratio, and allow the existence of caustics. under such conditions,starlight from all points in the planet's shadow is refracted into viewproducing a characteristic slowing down of the dimming at ingress (vice versafor egress). a search over several parameters, the planet radius etc., cannotproduce a nonlensed transit light curve that can mimic a lensed light curve.the fractional change in the diminution of starlight is approximately the ratioof atmospheric scale height to planet radius, expected to be 1 % or less.planet oblateness induces an asymmetry to the transit light curve about thepoint of minimum flux, depending on the planet orientation. the fractionalasymmetry is around 0.5 % for a projected ellipticity of 10 %, independent oflensing. for favorable ratios of planet to star radius, the above effects arepotentially observable with future space-based missions. this will allow us toconstrain the planet shape, and its atmospheric scale height, density andrefractive coefficient, providing information on its rotation, temperature andcomposition. for hd 209458b, the only currently known transiting extrasolarplanet, caustics are absent because of the very small lens-source separation.finally, we provide estimates of other variations to transit light curves thatcould be of comparable importance, including rings, satellites, stellaroscillations, star spots, and weather.

astro-ph;0309209	scattered light from close-in extrasolar planets: prospects of detection  with the most satellite	the ultra-precise photometric space satellite most (microvariability andoscillations of stars) will provide the first opportunity to measure thealbedos and scattered light curves from known short-period extrasolar planets.due to the changing phases of an extrasolar planet as it orbits its parentstar, the combined light of the planet-star system will vary on the order oftens of micromagnitudes. the amplitude and shape of the resulting light curveis sensitive to the planet's radius and orbital inclination, as well as thecomposition and size distribution of the scattering particles in the planet'satmosphere.  to predict the capabilities of most and other planned space missions, we haveconstructed a series of models of such light curves, improving upon earlierwork by incorporating more realistic details such as: limb darkening of thestar, intrinsic granulation noise in the star itself, tidal distortion andback-heating, higher angular resolution of the light scattering from theplanet, and exploration of the significance of the angular size of the star asseen from the planet. we use photometric performance simulations of the mostsatellite, with the light curve models as inputs, for one of the mission'sprimary targets, $\tau$ bo\"otis. these simulations demonstrate that, evenadopting a very conservative signal detection limit of 4.2 $\mu$mag inamplitude (not power), we will be able to either detect the $\tau$ bo\"otisplanet light curve or put severe constraints on possible extrasolar planetatmospheric models.

astro-ph;0309361	detection of close-in extrasolar giant planets using the fourier-kelvin  stellar interferometer	we evaluate the direct detection of extrasolar giant planets with atwo-aperture nulling infrared interferometer, working at angles${\theta}&lt;{\lambda}/2b$, and using a new `ratio-of-two-wavelengths' technique.simple arguments suggest that interferometric detection and characterizationshould be quite possible for planets much closer than the conventional innerworking angle, or angular resolution limit. we show that the peak signal from anulling infrared interferometer of baseline ($\lesssim 40$ meters) will oftenoccur `inside the null', and that the signal variations from path-differencefluctuations will cancel to first order in the ratio of two wavelengths. usinga new interferometer simulation code, we evaluate the detectability of all theknown extrasolar planets as observed using this two-color method with theproposed {\it fourier kelvin stellar interferometer (fksi)}. in its minimumconfiguration {\it fksi} uses two 0.5-meter apertures on a 12.5-meter baseline,and a $\pm 20^{\circ}$ field-of-regard. we predict that $\sim 7$ knownextrasolar planets are directly detectable using {\it fksi}, withlow-resolution spectroscopy ($r \sim 20$) being possible in the most favorablecases. spaceborne direct detection of extrasolar giant planets is possible with$\sim 12$ meter baselines, and does not require the much longer baselinesprovided by formation flying.

astro-ph;0402601	on the insignificance of photochemical hydrocarbon aerosols in the  atmospheres of close-in extrasolar giant planets	the close-in extrasolar giant planets (cegps) reside in irradiatedenvironments much more intense than that of the giant planets in our solarsystem. the high uv irradiance strongly influences their photochemistry and thegeneral current view believed that this high uv flux will greatly enhancephotochemical production of hydrocarbon aerosols. in this letter, weinvestigate hydrocarbon aerosol formation in the atmospheres of cegps. we findthat the abundances of hydrocarbons in the atmospheres of cegps aresignificantly less than that of jupiter except for models in which the ch$_4$abundance is unreasonably high (as high as co) for the hot (effectivetemperatures $\gtrsim 1000$ k) atmospheres. moreover, the hydrocarbons will becondensed out to form aerosols only when the temperature-pressure profiles ofthe species intersect with the saturation profiles--a case almost certainly notrealized in the hot cegps atmospheres. hence our models show that photochemicalhydrocarbon aerosols are insignificant in the atmospheres of cegps. incontrast, jupiter and saturn have a much higher abundance of hydrocarbonaerosols in their atmospheres which are responsible for strong absorptionshortward of 600 nm. thus the insignificance of photochemical hydrocarbonaerosols in the atmospheres of cegps rules out one class of models with lowalbedos and featureless spectra shortward of 600 nm.

astro-ph;0406390	phase light curves for extrasolar jupiters and saturns	we predict how a remote observer would see the brightness variations of giantplanets similar to jupiter and saturn as they orbit their central stars. wemodel the geometry of jupiter, saturn and saturn's rings for varying orbitaland viewing parameters. scattering properties for the planets and rings atwavelenghts 0.6-0.7 microns follow pioneer and voyager observations, namely,planets are forward scattering and rings are backward scattering. images of theplanet with or without rings are simulated and used to calculate thedisk-averaged luminosity varying along the orbit, that is, a light curve isgenerated. we find that the different scattering properties of jupiter andsaturn (without rings) make a substantial difference in the shape of theirlight curves. saturn-size rings increase the apparent luminosity of the planetby a factor of 2-3 for a wide range of geometries. rings produce asymmetriclight curves that are distinct from the light curve of the planet withoutrings. if radial velocity data are available for the planet, the effect of thering on the light curve can be distinguished from effects due to orbitaleccentricity. non-ringed planets on eccentric orbits produce light curves withmaxima shifted relative to the position of the maximum planet's phase. givenradial velocity data, the amount of the shift restricts the planet's unknownorbital inclination and therefore its mass. combination of radial velocity dataand a light curve for a non-ringed planet on an eccentric orbit can also beused to constrain the surface scattering properties of the planet. to summarizeour results for the detectability of exoplanets in reflected light, we presenta chart of light curve amplitudes of non-ringed planets for differenteccentricities, inclinations, and the viewing azimuthal angles of the observer.

astro-ph;0409443	on the period distribution of close-in extrasolar giant planets	transit (tr) surveys for extrasolar planets have recently uncovered apopulation of ``very hot jupiters,'' planets with orbital periods of p&lt; 3 d. atfirst sight this may seem surprising, given that radial velocity (rv) surveyshave found a dearth of such planets, despite the fact that their sensitivityincreases with decreasing p. we examine the confrontation between rv and trsurvey results, paying particular attention to selection biases that favorshort-period planets in transit surveys. we demonstrate that, when such biasesand small-number statistics are properly taken into account, the perioddistribution of planets found by rv and tr surveys are consistent at betterthan the 1-sigma level. this consistency holds for a large range of reasonableassumptions. in other words, there are not enough planets detected to robustlyconclude that the rv and tr short-period planet results are inconsistent.assuming a logarithmic distribution of periods, we find that the relativefrequency of very hot jupiters (vhj: p=1-3 d) to hot jupiters (hj: p=3-9 d) is10-20%. given an absolute frequency of hj of ~1%, this implies thatapproximately one star in ~500-1000 has a vhj. we also note that vhj and hjappear to be distinct in terms of their upper mass limit. we discuss theimplications of our results for planetary migration theories, as well aspresent and future tr and rv surveys.

astro-ph;0503302	vegetation's red edge: a possible spectroscopic biosignature of  extraterrestrial plants	earth's deciduous plants have a sharp order-of-magnitude increase in leafreflectance between approximately 700 and 750 nm wavelength. this strongreflectance of earth's vegetation suggests that surface biosignatures withsharp spectral features might be detectable in the spectrum of scattered lightfrom a spatially unresolved extrasolar terrestrial planet. we assess thepotential of earth's step-function-like spectroscopic feature, referred to asthe "red edge", as a tool for astrobiology. we review the basic characteristicsand physical origin of the red edge and summarize its use in astronomy: earlyspectroscopic efforts to search for vegetation on mars and recent reports ofdetection of the red edge in the spectrum of earthshine (i.e., the spatiallyintegrated scattered light spectrum of earth). we present earthshineobservations from apache point observatory to emphasize that time variabilityis key to detecting weak surface biosignatures such as the vegetation red edge.we briefly discuss the evolutionary advantages of vegetation's red edgereflectance, and speculate that while extraterrestrial "light harvestingorganisms" have no compelling reason to display the exact same red edge featureas terrestrial vegetation, they might have similar spectroscopic features atdifferent wavelengths than terrestrial vegetation. this implies that futureterrestrial-planet-characterizing space missions should obtain data that allowtime-varying, sharp spectral features at unknown wavelengths to be identified.we caution that some mineral reflectance edges are similar in slope andstrength to vegetation's red edge (albeit at different wavelengths); if anextrasolar planet reflectance edge is detected care must be taken with itsinterpretation.

astro-ph;0503554	infrared radiation from an extrasolar planet	a class of extrasolar giant planets - the so-called `hot jupiters' - orbitwithin 0.05 au of their primary stars. these planets should be hot and so emitdetectable infrared radiation. the planet hd 209458b is an ideal candidate forthe detection and characterization of this infrared light because it iseclipsed by the star. this planet has an anomalously large radius (1.35 timesthat of jupiter), which may be the result of ongoing tidal dissipation, butthis explanation requires a non-zero orbital eccentricity (~0.03), maintainedby interaction with a hypothetical second planet. here we report detection ofinfrared (24 micron) radiation from hd 209458b, by observing the decrement influx during secondary eclipse, when the planet passes behind the star. theplanet's 24 micron flux is 55 +/- 10 micro-jy (1 sigma), with a brightnesstemperature of 1130 +/- 150 kelvins, confirming the predicted heating bystellar irradiation. the secondary eclipse occurs at the midpoint betweentransits of the planet in front of the star (to within +/- 7 min, 1 sigma),which means that a dynamically significant orbital eccentricity is unlikely.

astro-ph;0510634	spectral distortions to the cosmic microwave background from the  recombination of hydrogen and helium	the recombination of hydrogen and helium at z~1000-7000 gives unavoidabledistortions to the cosmic microwave background (cmb) spectrum. we present adetailed calculation of the line intensities arising from the ly-alpha (2p-1s)and two-photon (2s-1s) transitions for the recombination of hydrogen, as wellas the corresponding lines from helium. we give an approximate formula for thestrength of the main recombination line distortion on the cmb in differentcosmologies, this peak occurring at about 170 microns. we also find apreviously undescribed long wavelength peak (which we call thepre-recombination peak) from the lines of the 2p-1s transitions, which areformed before significant recombination of the corresponding atoms occurred.detailed calculations of the two-photon emission line shapes are presented herefor the first time. the frequencies of the photons emitted from the two-photontransition have a wide spectrum and this causes the location of the peak of thetwo-photon line of hydrogen to be located almost at the same wavelength as themain ly-alpha peak. the helium lines also give distortions at similarwavelengths, so that the combined distortion has a complex shape. the detectionof this distortion would provide direct supporting evidence that the universewas indeed once a plasma. moreover, the distortions are a sensitive probe ofphysics during the time of recombination. although the spectral distortion isoverwhelmed by dust emission from the galaxy, and is maximum at wavelengthsroughly where the cosmic far-infrared background peaks, it may be able totailor an experiment to detect its non-trivial shape.

astro-ph;0601469	comparative planetology and the search for life beyond the solar system	the study of planets beyond the solar system and the search for otherhabitable planets and life is just beginning. ground-based (radial velocity andtransits) and space-based surveys (transits and astrometry) will identifyplanets spanning a wide range of size and orbital location, from earth-sizedobjects within 1 au to giant planets beyond 5 au, orbiting stars as near as afew parsec and as far as a kiloparsec. after this initial reconnaissance, thenext generation of space observatories will directly detect photons fromplanets in the habitable zones of nearby stars. the synergistic combination ofmeasurements of mass from astrometry and radial velocity, of radius andcomposition from transits, and the wealth of information from the directdetection of visible and mid-ir photons will create a rich field of comparativeplanetology. information on proto-planetary and debris disks will complete ourunderstanding of the evolution of habitable environments from the earlieststages of planet-formation through to the transport into the inner solar systemof the volatiles necessary for life.  the suite of missions necessary to carry out the search for nearby, habitableplanets and life requires a ``great observatories'' program for planet finding(sim planetquest, terrestrial planet finder-coronagraph, and terrestrial planetfinder-interferometer/darwin), analogous to the highly successful ``greatobservatories program'' for astrophysics. with these new great observatories,plus the james webb space telescope, we will extend planetology far beyond thesolar system, and possibly even begin the new field of comparative evolutionarybiology with the discovery of life itself in different astronomical settings.

astro-ph;0602443	strong infrared emission from the extrasolar planet hd189733b	we report detection of strong infrared thermal emission from the nearby (d=19pc) transiting extrasolar planet hd189733b, by measuring the flux decrementduring its prominent secondary eclipse. a 6-hour photometric sequence usingspitzer's infrared spectrograph in peak-up imaging mode at 16-microns shows thesecondary eclipse depth to be 0.551 +/-0.030%, with accuracy limited byinstrumental baseline uncertainties, but with 32-sigma precision (0.017%) onthe detection. the 16-micron brightness temperature of this planet (1117+/-42k)is very similar to the spitzer detections of tres-1 and hd209458b, but theobserved planetary flux (660 micro-jy) is an order of magnitude greater. thislarge signal will allow a detailed characterization of this planet in theinfrared. our photometry has sufficient signal-to-noise (~400 per point) tomotivate a search for structure in the ingress/egress portions of the eclipsecurve, caused by putative thermal structure on the disk of the planet. we showthat by binning our 6-second sampling down to 6-minute resolution, we detectthe modulation in the intensity derivative during ingress/egress due to theoverall shape of the planet, but our sensitivity is not yet sufficient todistinguish between realistic models of the temperature distribution across theplanet's disk. we point out the potential for extending spitzer secondaryeclipse detections down to the regime of transiting hot neptunes, if suchsystems are discovered among nearby lower main sequence stars.

astro-ph;0606096	a spitzer infrared radius for the transiting extrasolar planet hd209458b	we have measured the infrared transit of the extrasolar planet hd209458busing the spitzer space telescope. we observed two primary eclipse events (onepartial and one complete transit) using the 24 micron array of the multibandimaging photometer for spitzer (mips). we analyzed a total of 2392 individualimages (10-second integrations) of the planetary system, recorded before,during, and after transit. we perform optimal photometry on the images and usethe local zodiacal light as a short-term flux reference. at this longwavelength, the transit curve has a simple box-like shape, allowing robustsolutions for the stellar and planetary radii independent of stellar limbdarkening, which is negligible at 24 microns. we derive a stellar radius ofr$_*$ = 1.06 $\pm$ 0.07 r$_\sun$, a planetary radius of r$_p$ = 1.26 $\pm$ 0.08r$_j$, and a stellar mass of 1.17 m$_\sun$. within the errors, our resultsagree with the measurements at visible wavelengths. the 24-micron radius of theplanet therefore does not differ significantly compared to the visible result.we point out the potential for deriving extrasolar transiting planet radii tohigh accuracy using transit photometry at slightly shorter ir wavelengths wheregreater photometric precision is possible.

astro-ph;0607338	atmospheric circulation of close-in extrasolar giant planets: i. global,  barotropic, adiabatic simulations	we present results from a set of over 300 pseudospectral simulations ofatmospheric circulation on extrasolar giant planets with circular orbits. thesimulations are of high enough resolution (up to 341 total and sectoral modes)to resolve small-scale eddies and waves, required for reasonable physicalaccuracy. in this work, we focus on the global circulation pattern that emergesin a shallow, ``equivalent-barotropic'', turbulent atmosphere on both tidallysynchronized and unsynchronized planets. a full exploration of the largephysical and numerical parameter-space is performed to identify robust featuresof the circulation. for some validation, the model is first applied to solarsystem giant planets. for extrasolar giant planets with physical parameterssimilar to hd209458b--a presumably synchronized extrasolar giant planet,representative in many dynamical respects--the circulation is characterized bythe following features: 1) a coherent polar vortex that revolves around thepole in each hemisphere; 2) a low number--typically two or three--ofslowly-varying, broad zonal (east-west) jets that form when the maximum jetspeed is comparable to, or somewhat stronger than, those observed on theplanets in the solar system; and, 3) motion-associated temperature field, whosedetectability and variability depend on the strength of the net heating rateand the global root mean square wind speed in the atmosphere. in many ways, theglobal circulation is earth-like, rather than jupiter-like. however, ifextrasolar giant planets rotate faster and are not close-in (therefore notsynchronized), their circulations become more jupiter-like, for jupiter-likerotation rates.

astro-ph;0702507	a spectrum of an extrasolar planet	of the over 200 known extrasolar planets, 14 exhibit transits in front oftheir parent stars as seen from earth. spectroscopic observations of thetransiting planets can probe the physical conditions of their atmospheres. onesuch technique can be used to derive the planetary spectrum by subtracting thestellar spectrum measured during eclipse (planet hidden behind star) from thecombined-light spectrum measured outside eclipse (star + planet). althoughseveral attempts have been made from earth-based observatories, no spectrum hasyet been measured for any of the established extrasolar planets. here we reporta measurement of the infrared spectrum (7.5--13.2 micron) of the transitingextrasolar planet hd209458b. our observations reveal a hot thermal continuumfor the planetary spectrum, with approximately constant ratio to the stellarflux over this wavelength range. superposed on this continuum is a broademission peak centered near 9.65 micron that we attribute to emission bysilicate clouds. we also find a narrow, unidentified emission feature at 7.78micron. models of these ``hot jupiter'' planets predict a flux peak near 10micron, where thermal emission from the deep atmosphere emerges relativelyunimpeded by water absorption, but models dominated by water fit the observedspectrum poorly.

astro-ph;9912182	how exactly did the universe become neutral?	we present a refined treatment of h, he i, and he ii recombination in theearly universe. the difference from previous calculations is that we usemulti-level atoms and evolve the population of each level with redshift byincluding all bound-bound and bound-free transitions. in this framework wefollow several hundred atomic energy levels for h, he i, and he ii combined.the main improvements of this method over previous recombination calculationsare: (1) allowing excited atomic level populations to depart from anequilibrium distribution; (2) replacing the total recombination coefficientwith recombination to and photoionization from each level directly at eachredshift step; and (3) correct treatment of the he i atom, including thetriplet and singlet states. we find that the ionization fraction x_e = n_e/n_his approximately 10% smaller at redshifts &lt;~800 than in previous calculations,due to the non-equilibrium of the excited states of h, which is caused by thestrong but cool radiation field at those redshifts. in addition we find that hei recombination is delayed compared with previous calculations, and occurs onlyjust before h recombination. these changes in turn can affect the predictedpower spectrum of microwave anisotropies at the few percent level. otherimprovements such as including molecular and ionic species of h, includingcomplete heating and cooling terms for the evolution of the matter temperature,including collisional rates, and including feedback of the secondary spectraldistortions on the radiation field, produce negligible change to x_e. the lowerx_e at low z found in this work affects the abundances of h molecular and ionicspecies by 10-25%. however this difference is probably not larger than otheruncertainties in the reaction rates.
