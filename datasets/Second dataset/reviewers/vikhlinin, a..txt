0902.3709	diffuse baryonic matter beyond 2020	the hot, diffuse gas that fills the largest overdense structures in theuniverse -- clusters of galaxies and a web of giant filaments connecting them-- provides us with tools to address a wide array of fundamental astrophysicaland cosmological questions via observations in the x-ray band. clusters aresensitive cosmological probes. to utilize their full potential for precisioncosmology in the following decades, we must precisely understand their physics-- from their cool cores stirred by jets produced by the central supermassiveblack hole (itself fed by inflow of intracluster gas), to their outskirts,where the infall of intergalactic medium (igm) drives shocks and acceleratescosmic rays. beyond the cluster confines lies the virtually unexplored warmigm, believed to contain most of the baryonic matter in the present-dayuniverse. as a depository of all the matter ever ejected from galaxies, itcarries unique information on the history of energy and metal production in theuniverse. currently planned major observatories, such as astro-h and ixo, willmake deep inroads into these areas, but to see the most interesting parts ofthe picture will require an almost science-fiction-grade facility with tens ofm^2 of effective area, subarcsecond angular resolution, a matching imagingcalorimeter and a super high-dispersion spectrograph, such as generation-x.

0902.4857	galaxy clusters and the cosmic cycle of baryons across cosmic times	we discuss the central role played by the x-ray study of hot baryons withingalaxy clusters to reconstruct the assembly of cosmic structures and to tracethe past history of star formation and accretion onto supermassive black holes(bhs). we shortly review the progress in this field contributed by the currentgeneration of x-ray telescopes. then, we focus on the outstanding scientificquestions that have been opened by observations carried out in the last yearsand that represent the legacy of chandra and xmm: (a) when and how is entropyinjected into the inter-galactic medium (igm)? (b) what is the history of metalenrichment of the igm? (c) what physical mechanisms determine the presence ofcool cores in galaxy clusters? (d) how is the appearance of proto-clusters atz~2 related to the peak of star formation activity and bh accretion? we showthat a highly efficient observational strategy to address these questions is tocarry out a large-area x-ray survey, reaching a sensitivity comparable to thatof deep chandra and xmm pointings, but extending over several thousands ofsquare degrees. a similar survey can only be carried out with a wide-fieldx-ray telescope (wfxt), which combines a high survey speed with a sharp psfacross the entire fov. we emphasize the important synergies that wfxt will havewith a number of future ground-based and space telescopes, covering from theradio to the x-ray bands. finally, we discuss the immense legacy value thatsuch a mission will have for extragalactic astronomy at large.

0903.0388	towards the 2020 vision of the baryon content of galaxy groups and  clusters	groups and clusters of galaxies occupy a special position in the hierarchy oflarge-scale cosmic structures because they are the largest and the most massive(from ~10^13 msun to over 10^15 msun) objects in the universe that have hadtime to undergo gravitational collapse. the large masses of clusters imply thattheir contents have been accreted from regions of ~8-40 comoving mpc in sizeand should thus be representative of the mean matter content of the universe.during the next decade sensitive multi-wavelength observations should be ableto map the radial distributions of all main mass components (stars, cold, warm,and hot gas and total mass) at z&lt;~ 1 out to the virial radius. at the sametime, comparative studies of real and simulated cluster samples sould allow usto use clusters as veritable astrophysical laboratories for studying galaxyformation, as well as testing our theoretical models of structure formation andunderlying assumptions about fundamental physics governing the universe.

1006.3068	x-ray properties of the first sze-selected galaxy cluster sample from  the south pole telescope	we present results of x-ray observations of a sample of 15 clusters selectedvia their imprint on the cosmic microwave background (cmb) from the thermalsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. these clusters are a subset of the firstsz-selected cluster catalog, obtained from observations of 178 deg^2 of skysurveyed by the south pole telescope. using x-ray observations with chandra andxmm-newton, we estimate the temperature, t_x, and mass, m_g, of theintracluster medium (icm) within r_500 for each cluster. from these, wecalculate y_x=m_g t_x and estimate the total cluster mass using a m_500-y_xscaling relation measured from previous x-ray studies. the integratedcomptonization, y_sz, is derived from the sz measurements, using additionalinformation from the x-ray measured gas density profiles and a universaltemperature profile. we calculate scaling relations between the x-ray and szobservables, and find results generally consistent with other measurements andthe expectations from simple self-similar behavior. specifically, we fit ay_sz-y_x relation and find a normalization of 0.82 +- 0.07, marginallyconsistent with the predicted ratio of y_sz/y_x=0.91+-0.01 that would beexpected from the density and temperature models used in this work. using they_x derived mass estimates, we fit a y_sz-m_500 relation and find a slopeconsistent with the self-similar expectation of y_sz ~ m^5/3 with anormalization consistent with predictions from other x-ray studies. we comparethe x-ray mass estimates to previously published sz mass estimates derived fromcosmological simulations of the spt survey. we find that the sz mass estimatesare lower by a factor of 0.89+-0.06, which is within the ~15% systematicuncertainty quoted for the simulation-based sz masses.

1008.2393	model-independent x-ray mass determinations	a new method is introduced for making x-ray mass determinations of sphericalclusters of galaxies. treating the distribution of gravitating matter aspiecewise constant and the cluster atmosphere as piecewise isothermal, x-rayspectra of a hydrostatic atmosphere are determined up to a single overallnormalizing factor. in contrast to more conventional approaches, this methodrelies on the minimum of assumptions, apart from the conditions of hydrostaticequilibrium and spherical symmetry. the method has been implemented as an xspecmixing model called clmass, which was used to determine masses for a sample ofnine relaxed x-ray clusters. compared to conventional mass determinations,clmass provides weak constraints on values of m_500, reflecting the quality ofcurrent x-ray data for cluster regions beyond r_500. at smaller radii, wherethere are high quality x-ray spectra inside and outside the radius of interestto constrain the mass, clmass gives confidence ranges for m_2500 that are onlymoderately less restrictive than those from more familiar mass determinationmethods. the clmass model provides some advantages over other methods andshould prove useful for mass determinations in regions where there are highquality x-ray data.

1010.1577	constraining halo occupation properties of x-ray agns using clustering  of chandra sources in the bootes survey region	we present one of the most precise measurement to date of the spatialclustering of x-ray selected agns using a sample derived from the chandra x-rayobservatory survey in the bootes field. the real-space two-point correlationfunction over a redshift interval from z=0.17 to z~3 is well described by thepower law, xi(r)=(r/r0)^-gamma, for comoving separations r&lt;~20h^-1 mpc. we findgamma=1.84+-0.12 and r0 consistent with no redshift trend within the sample(varying between r0=5.5+-0.6 h^-1 mpc for &lt;z&gt;=0.37 and r0=6.9+-1.0 h^-1 mpc for&lt;z&gt;=1.28). further, we are able to measure the projections of the two-pointcorrelation function both on the sky plane and in the line of sight. we usethese measurements to show that the chandra/bootes agns are predominantlylocated at the centers of dark matter halos with the circular velocity vmax&gt;320km/s or m_200 &gt; 4.1e12 h^-1 msun, and tend to avoid satellite galaxies in halosof this or higher mass. the halo occupation properties inferred from theclustering properties of chandra/bootes agns --- the mass scale of the parentdark matter halos, the lack of significant redshift evolution of the clusteringlength, and the low satellite fraction --- are broadly consistent with thehopkins et al. scenario of quasar activity triggered by mergers ofsimilarly-sized galaxies.

1101.1286	discovery and cosmological implications of spt-cl j2106-5844, the most  massive known cluster at z &gt; 1	using the south pole telescope (spt), we have discovered the most massiveknown galaxy cluster at z &gt; 1, spt-cl j2106-5844. in addition to producing astrong sunyaev-zel'dovich effect signal, this system is a luminous x-ray sourceand its numerous constituent galaxies display spatial and color clustering, allindicating the presence of a massive galaxy cluster. vlt and magellanspectroscopy of 18 member galaxies shows that the cluster is at z =1.132^+0.002_-0.003. chandra observations obtained through a combined hrc-acisgto program reveal an x-ray spectrum with an fe k line redshifted by z = 1.18+/- 0.03. these redshifts are consistent with galaxy colors in extensiveoptical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared imaging. spt-cl j2106-5844 displaysextreme x-ray properties for a cluster, having a core-excluded temperature ofkt = 11.0^+2.6_-1.9 kev and a luminosity (within r_500) of l_x (0.5 - 2.0 kev)= (13.9 +/- 1.0) x 10^44 erg/s. the combined mass estimate from measurements ofthe sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and x-ray data is m_200 = (1.27 +/- 0.21) x 10^15m_sun. the discovery of such a massive gravitationally collapsed system at highredshift provides an interesting laboratory for galaxy formation and evolution,and is a powerful probe of extreme perturbations of the primordial matterdensity field. we discuss the latter, determining that, under the assumption oflambdacdm cosmology with only gaussian perturbations, there is only a 7% chanceof finding a galaxy cluster similar to spt-cl j2106-5844 in the 2500 deg^2 sptsurvey region, and that only one such galaxy cluster is expected in the entiresky.

1101.1290	an sz-selected sample of the most massive galaxy clusters in the  2500-square-degree south pole telescope survey	the south pole telescope (spt) is currently surveying 2500 deg^2 of thesouthern sky to detect massive galaxy clusters out to the epoch of theirformation using the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. this paper presents acatalog of the 26 most significant sz cluster detections in the full surveyregion. the catalog includes 14 clusters which have been previously identifiedand 12 that are new discoveries. these clusters were identified in fieldsobserved to two differing noise depths: 1500 deg^2 at the final spt surveydepth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz, and 1000 deg^2 at a depth of 54 uk-arcmin.clusters were selected on the basis of their sz signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) inspt maps, a quantity which has been demonstrated to correlate tightly withcluster mass. the s/n thresholds were chosen to achieve a comparable massselection across survey fields of both depths. cluster redshifts were obtainedwith optical and infrared imaging and spectroscopy from a variety of ground-and space-based facilities. the redshifts range from 0.098 \leq z \leq 1.132with a median of z_med = 0.40. the measured sz s/n and redshifts lead tounbiased mass estimates ranging from 9.8 \times 10^14 m_sun/h_70 \leqm_200(rho_mean) \leq 3.1 \times 10^15 m_sun/h_70. based on the sz massestimates, we find that none of the clusters are individually in significanttension with the lambdacdm cosmological model. we also test for evidence ofnon-gaussianity based on the cluster sample and find the data show nopreference for non-gaussian perturbations.

1101.4966	evidence for rapid redshift evolution of strong cluster cooling flows	we present equivalent widths of the [oii] and ha nebular emission lines for77 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) selected from the 160 square degree$rosat$ x-ray survey. we find no [oii] or ha emission stronger than -15angstroms or -5 angstroms, respectively, in any bcg. the corresponding emissionline luminosities lie below 6e40 erg/s, which is a factor of 30 below that ofngc1275 in the perseus cluster. a comparison to the detection frequency ofnebular emission in bcgs lying at redshifts above z = 0.35 drawn from thebrightest cluster survey (crawford et al. 1999) indicates that we should havedetected roughly one dozen emission-line galaxies, assuming the two surveys areselecting similar clusters in the x-ray luminosity range 10e42 erg/s to 10e45erg/s. the absence of luminous nebular emission (ie., perseus-like systems) inour sample is consistent with an increase in the number density of {\it strong}cooling flow (cooling core) clusters between $\rm z=0.5$ and today. the declinein their numbers at higher redshift could be due to cluster mergers and agnheating.

1107.2946	average heating rate of hot atmospheres in distant clusters by radio  agn: evidence for continuous agn heating	we examine atmospheric heating by radio active galactic nuclei (agn) indistant x-ray clusters by cross correlating clusters selected from the 400square degree (400sd) x-ray cluster survey with radio sources in the nrao vlasky survey. roughly 30% of the clusters show radio emission above a fluxthreshold of 3 mjy within a projected radius of 250 kpc. the radio emission ispresumably associated with the brightest cluster galaxy. the mechanical jetpower for each radio source was determined using scaling relations betweenradio power and cavity (mechanical) power determined for nearby clusters,groups, and galaxies with hot atmospheres containing x-ray cavities. theaverage jet power of the central radio agn is approximately $2\times10^{44}$\ergs. we find no significant correlation between radio power, hencemechanical jet power, and the x-ray luminosities of clusters in the redshiftrange 0.1 -- 0.6. this implies that the mechanical heating rate per particle ishigher in lower mass, lower x-ray luminosity clusters. the jet power averagedover the sample corresponds to an atmospheric heating of approximately 0.2 kevper particle within r$_{500}$. assuming the current agn heating rate does notevolve but remains constant to redshifts of 2, the heating rate per particlewould rise by a factor of two. we find that the energy injected from radio agncontribute substantially to the excess entropy in hot atmospheres needed tobreak self-similarity in cluster scaling relations. the detection frequency ofradio agn is inconsistent with the presence of strong cooling flows in 400sdclusters, but does not exclude weak cooling flows. it is unclear whethercentral agn in 400sd clusters are maintained by feedback at the base of acooling flow. atmospheric heating by radio agn may retard the development ofstrong cooling flows at early epochs.

1112.5435	cosmological constraints from sunyaev-zel'dovich-selected clusters with  x-ray observations in the first 178 square degrees of the south pole  telescope survey	we use measurements from the south pole telescope (spt) sunyaev zel'dovich(sz) cluster survey in combination with x-ray measurements to constraincosmological parameters. we present a statistical method that fits for thescaling relations of the sz and x-ray cluster observables with mass whilejointly fitting for cosmology. the method is generalizable to multiple clusterobservables, and self-consistently accounts for the effects of the clusterselection and uncertainties in cluster mass calibration on the derivedcosmological constraints. we apply this method to a data set consisting of ansz-selected catalog of 18 galaxy clusters at z &gt; 0.3 from the first 178 deg2 ofthe 2500 deg2 spt-sz survey, with 14 clusters having x-ray observations fromeither chandra or xmm. assuming a spatially flat lcdm cosmological model, wefind the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 (omega_m/0.25)^0.30 = 0.785 +-0.037. in combination with measurements of the cmb power spectrum from the sptand the seven-year wmap data, the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 = 0.795+- 0.016 and omega_m = 0.255 +- 0.016, a factor of 1.5 improvement on eachparameter over the cmb data alone. we consider several extensions beyond thelcdm model by including the following as free parameters: the dark energyequation of state (w), the sum of the neutrino masses (sum mnu), the effectivenumber of relativistic species (neff), and a primordial non-gaussianity (fnl).we find that adding the spt cluster data significantly improves the constraintson w and sum mnu beyond those found when using measurements of the cmb,supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the hubble constant. consideringeach extension independently, we best constrain w=-0.973 +- 0.063 and the sumof neutrino masses sum mnu &lt; 0.28 ev at 95% confidence, a factor of 1.25 and1.4 improvement, respectively, over the constraints without clusters.

1208.1612	contribution of the accretion disk, hot corona, and obscuring torus to  the luminosity of seyfert galaxies: integral and spitzer observations	we estimate the relative contributions of the supermassive black hole (smbh)accretion disk, corona, and obscuring torus to the bolometric luminosity ofseyfert galaxies, using spizter mid-infrared (mir) observations of a completesample of 68 nearby active galactic nuclei from the integral all-sky hard x-ray(hx) survey. this is the first hx-selected (above 15 kev) sample of agns withcomplementary high angular resolution, high signal to noise, mir data.correcting for the host galaxy contribution, we find a correlation between hxand mir luminosities: l_mir l_hx^(0.74+/-0.06). assuming that the observed miremission is radiation from an accretion disk reprocessed in a surrounding dustytorus that subtends a solid angle decreasing with increasing luminosity (asinferred from the declining fraction of obscured agns), the intrinsic diskluminosity, l_d, is approximately proportional to the luminosity of the coronain the 2-300 kev energy band, l_c, with the l_d/l_c ratio varying by a factorof 2.1 around a mean value of 1.6. this ratio is a factor of ~2 smaller thanfor typical quasars producing the cosmic x-ray background (cxb). therefore,over three orders of magnitude in luminosity, hx radiation carries a large, androughly comparable, fraction of the bolometric output of agns. we estimate thecumulative bolometric luminosity density of local agns at ~(1-3)x10^40erg/s/mpc^3. finally, the compton temperature ranges between kt_c~2 and ~6 kevfor nearby agns, compared to kt_c~2 kev for typical quasars, confirming thatradiative heating of interstellar gas can play an important role in regulatingsmbh growth.

1208.2962	a massive, cooling-flow-induced starburst in the core of a highly  luminous galaxy cluster	in the cores of some galaxy clusters the hot intracluster plasma is denseenough that it should cool radiatively in the cluster's lifetime, leading tocontinuous "cooling flows" of gas sinking towards the cluster center, yet nosuch cooling flow has been observed. the low observed star formation rates andcool gas masses for these "cool core" clusters suggest that much of the coolingmust be offset by astrophysical feedback to prevent the formation of a runawaycooling flow. here we report x-ray, optical, and infrared observations of thegalaxy cluster spt-clj2344-4243 at z = 0.596. these observations reveal anexceptionally luminous (l_2-10 kev = 8.2 x 10^45 erg/s) galaxy cluster whichhosts an extremely strong cooling flow (dm/dt = 3820 +/- 530 msun/yr). further,the central galaxy in this cluster appears to be experiencing a massivestarburst (740 +/- 160 msun/yr), which suggests that the feedback sourceresponsible for preventing runaway cooling in nearby cool core clusters may notyet be fully established in spt-clj2344-4243. this large star formation rateimplies that a significant fraction of the stars in the central galaxy of thiscluster may form via accretion of the intracluster medium, rather than thecurrent picture of central galaxies assembling entirely via mergers.

1208.3368	high-redshift cool-core galaxy clusters detected via the  sunyaev--zel'dovich effect in the south pole telescope survey	we report the first investigation of cool-core properties of galaxy clustersselected via their sunyaev--zel'dovich (sz) effect. we use 13 galaxy clustersuniformly selected from 178 deg^2 observed with the south pole telescope (spt)and followed up by the chandra x-ray observatory. they form an approximatelymass-limited sample (&gt; 3 x 10^14 m_sun h^-1_70) spanning redshifts 0.3 &lt; z &lt;1.1. using previously published x-ray-selected cluster samples, we compare twoproxies of cool-core strength: surface brightness concentration (csb) andcuspiness ({\alpha}). we find that csb is better constrained. we measure csbfor the spt sample and find several new z &gt; 0.5 cool-core clusters, includingtwo strong cool cores. this rules out the hypothesis that there are no z &gt; 0.5clusters that qualify as strong cool cores at the 5.4{\sigma} level. thefraction of strong cool-core clusters in the spt sample in this redshift regimeis between 7% and 56% (95% confidence). although the spt selection function issignificantly different from the x-ray samples, the high-z csb distribution forthe spt sample is statistically consistent with that of x-ray-selected samplesat both low and high redshifts. the cool-core strength is inversely correlatedwith the offset between the brightest cluster galaxy and the x-ray centroid,providing evidence that the dynamical state affects the cool-core strength ofthe cluster. larger sz-selected samples will be crucial in understanding theevolution of cluster cool cores over cosmic time.

0711.4686	measuring the non-thermal pressure in early type galaxy atmospheres: a  comparison of x-ray and optical potential profiles in m87 and ngc1399	we compare the gravitational potential profiles of the elliptical galaxiesngc 4486 (m87) and ngc 1399 (the central galaxy in the fornax cluster) derivedfrom x-ray and optical data. this comparison suggests that the combinedcontribution of cosmic rays, magnetic fields and micro-turbulence to thepressure is ~10% of the gas thermal pressure in the cores of ngc 1399 and m87,although the uncertainties in our model assumptions (e.g., spherical symmetry)are sufficiently large that the contribution could be consistent with zero. inthe absence of any other form of non-thermal pressure support, these upperbounds translate into upper limits on the magnetic field of ~10-20 mug at adistance of 1'-2' from the centers of ngc1399 and m87. we show that theseresults are consistent with the current paradigm of cool cluster cores, basedon the assumption that agn activity regulates the thermal state of the gas byinjecting energy into the intra-cluster medium. the limit of ~10-20% on theenergy density in the form of relativistic protons applies not only to thecurrent state of the gas, but essentially to the entire history of theintra-cluster medium, provided that cosmic ray protons evolve adiabatically andthat their spatial diffusion is suppressed.

1309.7044	robust quantification of galaxy cluster morphology using asymmetry and  central concentration	we present a novel quantitative scheme of cluster classification based on themorphological properties that are manifested in x-ray images. we use aconventional radial surface brightness concentration parameter (c_{sb}) asdefined previously by others, and a new asymmetry parameter, which we define inthis paper. our asymmetry parameter, which we refer to as photon asymmetry($a_{phot}), was developed as a robust substructure statistic for clusterobservations with only a few thousand counts. to demonstrate that photonasymmetry exhibits better stability than currently popular power ratios andcentroid shifts, we artificially degrade the x-ray image quality by: (a) addingextra background counts, (b) eliminating a fraction of the counts, (c)increasing the width of the smoothing kernel, and (d) simulating clusterobservations at higher redshift. the asymmetry statistic presented here has asmaller statistical uncertainty than competing substructure parameters,allowing for low levels of substructure to be measured with confidence.a_{phot} is less sensitive to the total number of counts than competingsubstructure statistics, making it an ideal candidate for quantifyingsubstructure in samples of distant clusters covering wide range ofobservational s/n. additionally, we show that the asymmetry-concentrationclassification separates relaxed, cool core clusters frommorphologically-disturbed mergers, in agreement with by-eye classifications.our algorithms, freely available as python scripts(https://github.com/ndaniyar/aphot) are completely automatic and can be used torapidly classify galaxy cluster morphology for large numbers of clusterswithout human intervention.

1312.2462	constraints on the cmb temperature evolution using multi-band  measurements of the sunyaev zel'dovich effect with the south pole telescope	the adiabatic evolution of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) is a key prediction of standard cosmology. we study deviations from theexpected adiabatic evolution of the cmb temperature of the form $t(z)=t_0(1+z)^{1-\alpha}$ using measurements of the spectrum of the sunyaevzel'dovich effect with the south pole telescope (spt). we present a method forusing the ratio of the sunyaev zel'dovich signal measured at 95 and 150 ghz inthe spt data to constrain the temperature of the cmb. we demonstrate that thisapproach provides unbiased results using mock observations of clusters from anew set of hydrodynamical simulations. we apply this method to a sample of 158spt-selected clusters, spanning the redshift range $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 1.35$, andmeasure $\alpha = 0.017^{+0.030}_{-0.028}$, consistent with the standard modelprediction of $\alpha=0$. in combination with other published results, weconstrain $\alpha = 0.011 \pm 0.016$, an improvement of $\sim 20\%$ overpublished constraints. this measurement also provides a strong constraint onthe effective equation of state in models of decaying dark energy$w_\mathrm{eff} = -0.987^{+0.016}_{-0.017}$.

0802.3742	x-ray observations of the coma cluster in a broad energy band with  integral, rxte, and rosat observatories	we present results of x-ray observations of the coma cluster with multipleinstruments over a broad energy band. using the data from integral, rxte androsat observatories, we find that the coma spectrum in the 0.5-107 kev energyband can be well approximated by a thermal plasma emission model with atemperature of t=8.2 kev. integral was used to image the cluster emission inthe hard energy band. the cluster is only marginally detectable ~1.6sigma inthe 44-107 kev energy band; however, the raw flux in this band is consistentwith the previous results from beppo-sax and rxte observatories. we can excludewith high significance that the hard-band flux reported by beppo-sax and rxtecould be produced by a single point source. the 20-80 kev flux of a possiblenon-thermal component in the cluster spectrum is (6.0+-8.8)*10**-12ergs/cm^2/s. it is unlikely that the ic scattering of cmb photons is able toproduce hard x-ray flux at these levels, unless the magnetic field strength isas low as 0.2mug. the latter value can be considered as a lower limit on thefield strength in coma. we also present a temperature map of the central partof the cluster, which shows significant variations and in particular, a hot,~11.5 kev, region in the extension towards the subcluster infalling from thesouth-west.

1404.6250	the redshift evolution of the mean temperature, pressure, and entropy  profiles in 80 spt-selected galaxy clusters	(abridged) we present the results of an x-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clustersselected in the 2500 deg^2 south pole telescope survey and observed with thechandra x-ray observatory. we divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20clusters based on redshift and central density, performing an x-ray fit to allclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of thetemperature profile. this approach allows us to constrain the shape of thetemperature profile over 0&lt;r&lt;1.5r500, which would be impossible on aper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, onaverage, 2000 x-ray counts. the results presented here represent the firstconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 toz=1.2. we find that high-z (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler bothin the inner (r&lt;0.1r500) and outer (r&gt;r500) regions than their low-z(0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6) counterparts. combining the average temperature profile withmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the averagepressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. overall, our observedpressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of thecore. we find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile atr&lt;0.7r500. we observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r&gt;r500 inour high-z subsample. this flattening is consistent with a temperature bias dueto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 kev) halos, which would goundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. thiswork demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved clusterproperties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but thenumber of observed clusters is high.

1410.0025	x-ray cavities in a sample of 83 spt-selected clusters of galaxies:  tracing the evolution of agn feedback in clusters of galaxies out to z=1.2	x-ray cavities are key tracers of mechanical (or radio mode) heating arisingfrom the active galactic nuclei (agn) in brightest cluster galaxies. we reporton a survey for x-ray cavities in 83 massive, high-redshift (0.4&lt;z&lt;1.2)clusters of galaxies selected by their sunyaev-zel'dovich signature in thesouth pole telescope data. based on chandra x-ray images, we find a total of 6clusters having symmetric pairs of surface brightness depressions consistentwith the picture of radio jets inflating x-ray cavities in the intraclustermedium. the majority of these detections are of relatively low significance andrequire deeper follow-up data in order to be confirmed. further, due to thelimitations of chandra at high redshift, this search misses small (&lt;10 kpc),unresolved x-ray cavities at high (z&gt;0.5) redshift. despite these limitations,our results suggest that the power generated by agn feedback in brightestcluster galaxies has remained unchanged for over half of the age of theuniverse (&gt;7 gyrs at z=0.8). on average, the detected x-ray cavities havepowers of 0.8-5*10^45 erg/s, enthalpies of 3-6*10^59 erg, and radii of 17 kpc.integrating over 7 gyrs, we find that the supermassive black holes in thebrightest cluster galaxies may have accreted 10^8 to several 10^9m_sun ofmaterial to power these outflows. this level of accretion indicates thatsignificant supermassive black hole growth may occur not only at early times,in the quasar era, but at late times as well. we also find that x-ray cavitiesat high-redshift may inject an excess heat of 0.1-1.0 kev per particle into thehot intracluster medium above and beyond the energy needed to offset cooling.this value is similar to the energy needed to preheat clusters, breakself-similarity, and explain the excess entropy in hot atmospheres.

1410.6485	turbulent heating in galaxy clusters brightest in x-rays	the hot, x-ray-emitting intracluster medium (icm) is the dominant baryonicconstituent of clusters of galaxies. in the cores of many clusters, radiativeenergy losses from the icm occur on timescales significantly shorter than theage of the system. unchecked, this cooling would lead to massive accumulationsof cold gas and vigorous star formation, in contradiction to observations.various sources of energy capable of compensating these cooling losses havebeen proposed, the most promising being heating by the supermassive black holesin the central galaxies through inflation of bubbles of relativistic plasma.regardless of the original source of energy, the question of how this energy istransferred to the icm has remained open. here we present a plausible solutionto this question based on deep chandra x-ray observatory data and a newdata-analysis method that enables us to evaluate directly the icm heating ratedue to the dissipation of turbulence. we find that turbulent heating issufficient to offset radiative cooling and indeed appears to balance it locallyat each radius - it might therefore be the key element in resolving the gascooling problem in cluster cores and, more universally, in atmospheres of x-raygas-rich systems.

1412.7521	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave  background by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope	clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the cmb onarcminute scales. measurements of this effect can be used to constrain themasses of galaxy clusters with cmb data alone. here we present a measurement oflensing of the cmb by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope(spt). we develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the cmb clusterlensing signal and validate the method on mock data. we quantify the effects onour analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find thatthey generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. it is estimated thatthis bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of thestatistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upperlimit. we apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected viatheir sz signatures in spt data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensingat $3.1\sigma$. the lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sampleis consistent with that inferred from the sz flux: $m_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =0.83_{-0.37}^{+0.38}\, m_{200,\mathrm{sz}}$ (68% c.l., statistical error only).

1502.03269	(no) dimming of x-ray clusters beyond z~1 at fixed mass: crude  redhshifts and masses from raw x-ray and sz data	scaling relations in the lcdm cosmology predict that for a given mass theclusters formed at larger redshift are hotter, denser and therefore moreluminous in x-rays than their local z~0 counterparts. this effect overturns thedecrease in the observable x-ray flux so that it does not decrease at z &gt; 1,similar to the sz signal. provided that scaling relations remain valid atlarger redshifts, x-ray surveys will not miss massive clusters at any redshift,no matter how far they are. at the same time, the difference in scaling withmass and distance of the observable sz and x-ray signals from galaxy clustersat redshifts $z\lesssim 2$ offers a possibility to crudely estimate theredshift and the mass of a cluster. this might be especially useful forpreselection of massive high-redshift clusters and planning of opticalfollow-up for overlapping surveys in x-ray (e.g., by srg/erosita) and sz (e.g.planck, spt and act).

0805.2320	chandra studies of the x-ray gas properties of galaxy groups	we present a systematic analysis of 43 galaxy groups (kt_500=0.7-2.7 kev orm_500=10^13-10^14 h^-1 m_solar, 0.012&lt;z&lt;0.12), based on chandra archival data.with robust background subtraction and modeling, we trace gas properties to&gt;r_2500 for all 43 groups. for 23 groups, gas properties can be robustlyderived to or extrapolated to r_500. we show that in spite of the largevariation in t profiles inside 0.15 r_500, the t profiles of these groups aresimilar at &gt;0.15 r_500 and are consistent with a "universal temperatureprofile". we present the entropy-t relations at six characteristics radii (30kpc - r_500), for 43 groups from this work and 14 clusters from vikhlinin etal. (2008). despite large scatter in the entropy values at &lt;0.15 r_500, theintrinsic scatter from r_2500 is much smaller and remains the same (~10%) tor_500. we also present scaling relations for the gas fraction. it appears thatthe average gas fraction between r_2500 and r_500 has no temperaturedependence, ~ 0.12 for 1 - 10 kev systems. the group gas fractions withinr_2500 are generally low and have large scatter. this work shows that thedifference of groups from hotter clusters stems from the difficulty ofcompressing group gas to inside r_2500. the large scatter of the group gasfraction within r_2500 causes large scatter in the group entropy around thecenter and may be responsible for the large scatter of the luminosities.nevertheless, the groups appear more regular and more like clusters beyondr_2500, from the results on gas fraction and entropy. therefore, mass proxiescan be extended into low mass systems. the m-t and m-y relations derived inthis work are indeed well behaved down to at least 2e13 h^-1 m_solar.

0807.3338	in-depth chandra study of the agn feedback in virgo elliptical galaxy  m84	using deep chandra observations of m84 we study the energetics of theinteraction between the black hole and the interstellar medium of thisearly-type galaxy. we perform a detailed two dimensional reconstruction of theproperties of the x-ray emitting gas using a constrained voronoi tessellationmethod, identifying the mean trends and carrying out the fluctuation analysisof the thermodynamical properties of the hot ism. in addition to the pv workassociated with the bubble expansion, we identify and measure the wave energyassociated with the mildly supersonic bubble expansion. we show that, dependingon the age of the cavity and the associated wave, the waves can have asubstantial contribution to the total energy release from the agn. the energydissipated in the waves tends to be concentrated near the center of m84 and inthe direction perpendicular to the bubble outflow, possibly due to theinterference of the waves generated by the expansion of northern and southernbubbles. we also find direct evidence for the escape of radio plasma from theism of the host galaxy into the intergalactic medium.

astro-ph;0001402	chandra x-ray observations of the hydra a cluster: an interaction  between the radio source and the x-ray-emitting gas	we present chandra x-ray observations of the hydra a cluster of galaxies, andwe report the discovery of structure in the central 80 kpc of the cluster'sx-ray-emitting gas. the most remarkable structures are depressions in the x-raysurface brightness, $\sim 25-35$ kpc diameter, that are coincident with hydraa's radio lobes. the depressions are nearly devoid of x-ray-emitting gas, andthere is no evidence for shock-heated gas surrounding the radio lobes. wesuggest the gas within the surface brightness depressions was displaced as theradio lobes expanded subsonically, leaving cavities in the hot atmosphere. thegas temperature declines from 4 kev at 70 kpc to 3 kev in the inner 20 kpc ofthe brightest cluster galaxy (bcg), and the cooling time of the gas is $\sim600$ myr in the inner 10 kpc. these properties are consistent with the presenceof a $\sim 34 \msunyr$ cooling flow within a 70 kpc radius. bright x-rayemission is present in the bcg surrounding a recently-accreted disk of nebularemission and young stars. the star formation rate is commensurate with thecooling rate of the hot gas within the volume of the disk, although the sinkfor the material cooling at larger radii remains elusive.

astro-ph;0008496	a moving cold front in the intergalactic medium of a3667	we present results from a chandra observation of the central region of thegalaxy cluster a3667, with emphasis on the prominent sharp x-ray brightnessedge spanning 0.5 mpc near the cluster core. our temperature map showslarge-scale nonuniformities characteristic of the ongoing merger, in agreementwith earlier asca results. the brightness edge turns out to be a boundary of alarge cool gas cloud moving through the hot ambient gas, very similar to the"cold fronts" discovered by chandra in a2142. the higher quality of the a3667data allows the direct determination of the cloud velocity. at the leading edgeof the cloud, the gas density abruptly increases by a factor of 3.9+-0.8, whilethe temperature decreases by a factor of 1.9+-0.2 (from 7.7 kev to 4.1 kev).the ratio of the gas pressures inside and outside the front shows that thecloud moves through the ambient gas at near-sonic velocity, m=1+-0.2 orv=1400+-300 km/s. in front of the cloud, we observe the compression of theambient gas with an amplitude expected for such a velocity. a smaller surfacebrightness discontinuity is observed further ahead, ~350 kpc in front of thecloud. we suggest that it corresponds to a weak bow shock, implying that thecloud velocity may be slightly supersonic. given all the evidence, the coldfront appears to delineate the remnant of a cool subcluster that recently hasmerged with a3667. the cold front is remarkably sharp. the upper limit on itswidth, 3.5 arcsec or 5 kpc, is several times smaller than the coulomb mean freepath. this is a direct observation of suppression of the transport processes inthe intergalactic medium, most likely by magnetic fields.

astro-ph;0008499	chandra estimate of the magnetic field strength near the cold front in  a3667	we use the chandra observation of the cold front in the intracluster gas ofa3667 to estimate the magnetic field strength near the front. the front is seenin the chandra data as a sharp discontinuity in the gas density whichdelineates a large body of dense cool gas moving with the near-sonic velocitythrough the less dense, hotter gas. without a magnetic field, the front shouldbe quickly disturbed by the kelvin-helmholtz instability arising fromtangential motion of gas layers. however, chandra image shows that the front isstable within a +-30deg sector in the direction of the cloud motion, beyondwhich it gradually disappears. we suggest that the kelvin-helmholtz instabilitywithin the +-30deg sector is suppressed by surface tension of the magneticfield whose field lines are parallel to the front. the required field strengthis b ~ 10 mug. magnetic field near the front is expected to be stronger andhave very different structure compared to the bulk of the intergalactic medium,because the field lines are stretched by the tangential gas motions. such amagnetic configuration, once formed, would effectively stop the plasmadiffusion and heat conduction across the front, and may inhibit gas mixingduring the subcluster merger. we note that even the increased magnetic fieldnear the front contributes only 10-20% to the total gas pressure, and thereforemagnetic pressure is unimportant for hydrostatic cluster mass estimates.

astro-ph;0009199	chandra study of an overdensity of x-ray sources around two distant  (z~0.5) clusters	we present results from a chandra x-ray observatory study of the field x-raysource populations in 4 different observations: two high-redshift (z~0.5)clusters of galaxies 3c295 and rxj003033.2+261819; and two non-cluster fieldswith similar exposure time. surprisingly, the 0.5-2 kev source surfacedensities (~900-1200 sources deg**-2 at a flux limit of 1.5x10**-15 ergcm**-2s**-1) measured in an ~8'x8' area surrounding each cluster exceed by afactor of ~2 the value expected on the basis of the rosat and chandralogn-logs, with a significance of ~2 sigma each, or ~3.5 sigma when the 2fields are combined (i.e. a probability to be a statistical fluctuation of &lt;1%and &lt;0.04%, respectively). the same analysis performed on the non-clusterfields and on the outer chips of the cluster fields does not show evidence ofsuch an excess. in both cluster fields, the summed 0.5-10 kev spectrum of thedetected objects is well fitted by a power-law with gamma~1.7 similar to agnsand shows no sign of intrinsic absorption. the few (~10 out of 35) opticalidentifications available to date confirm that most of them are, as expected,agns but the number of redshifts available is too small to allow conclusions ontheir nature. we discuss possible interpretations of the overdensity in termsof: a statistical variation of cosmic background sources; a concentration ofagns and/or powerful starburst galaxies associated with the clusters; and gravitational lensing of background qso's by the galaxy clusters. allexplanations are however difficult to reconcile with the large number of excesssources detected. deeper x-ray observations and more redshifts measurements areclearly required to settle the issue.

astro-ph;0102291	chandra observation of rxj1720.1+2638: a nearly relaxed cluster with a  fast moving core?	we have analyzed the chandra observation of the distant (z=0.164) galaxycluster rxj1720.1+2638 in which we find sharp features in the x-ray surfacebrightness on opposite sides of the x-ray peak: an edge at about 250 h_50^{-1}kpc to the south-east and a plateau at about 130 h_50^{-1} kpc to thenorth-west. the surface brightness edge and the plateau can be modeled as a gasdensity discontinuity (jump) and a slope change (break). the temperatureprofiles suggest that the jump and the break are the boundaries of a central,group-size (d=380h_50^{-1} kpc), dense, cold (t=4 kev) gas cloud, embedded in adiffuse hot (t=10 kev) intracluster medium. the density jump and thetemperature change across the discontinuity are similar to the ``cold fronts''discovered by chandra in a2142 and a3667, and suggest subsonic motion of thiscentral gas cloud with respect to the cluster itself. the most naturalexplanation is that we are observing a merger in the very last stage before thecluster becomes fully relaxed. however, the data are also consistent with analternative scenario in which rxj1720.1+2638 is the result of the collapse oftwo co-located density perturbations, the first a group-scale perturbationcollapse followed by a second cluster-scale perturbation collapse thatsurrounded, but did not destroy, the first one. we also show that, because ofthe core motion, the total mass inside the cluster core, derived under theassumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, may underestimate the true cluster mass.if widespread, such motion may partially explain the discrepancy between x-rayand the strong lensing mass determinations found in some clusters.

astro-ph;0103103	chandra observtaion of a2256 - a cluster at the early stage of merging	we present here \chandra observations of the rich cluster of galaxies a2256.in addition to the known cool subcluster, a new structure was resolved 2$'$east of the peak of the main cluster. its position is roughtly at the center ofa low-brightness radio halo. spectral analysis shows that the "shoulder" hashigh iron abundance ($\sim$ 1). we suggest that this structure is eitheranother merging component or an internal structure of the main cluster. thex-ray redshifts of several regions were measured. the results agree with theoptical ones and suggest that the main cluster, the subcluster and the"shoulder" are physically associated and interacting. the subcluster has lowtemperature ($\sim$ 4.5 kev) and high iron abundance ($\sim$ 0.6) in thecentral 150 kpc. the \chandra image shows a relatively sharp brightnessgradient at the south of the subcluster peak running south-south-east (sse). atemperature jump was found across the edge, with higher temperature ahead ofthe edge in the low density region. this phenomenon is qualitatively similar tothe "cold fronts" found in a2142 and a3667. if the "shoulder" is ignored, thetemperature map resembles those simulations at the early stage of merging whilethe subcluster approached the main cluster from somewhere west. this fact andthe observed edge, in combination with the clear iron abundance contrastbetween the center of the subcluster ($\sim$ 0.6) and the main cluster ($\sim$0.2), all imply that the ongoing merger is still at the early stage. at leastthree member galaxies, including a radio head-tail galaxy, were found to havecorresponding x-ray emission.

astro-ph;0105224	a richness study of 14 distant x-ray clusters from the 160 square degree  survey	we have measured the surface density of galaxies toward 14 x-ray-selectedcluster candidates at redshifts greater than z=0.46, and we show that they areassociated with rich galaxy concentrations. we find that the clusters rangebetween abell richness classes 0-2, and have a most probable richness class ofone. we compare the richness distribution of our distant clusters to those forthree samples of nearby clusters with similar x-ray luminosities. we find thatthe nearby and distant samples have similar richness distributions, which showsthat clusters have apparently not evolved substantially in richness sinceredshift z =0.5. we compare the distribution of distant x-ray clusters in thel_x--richness plane to the distribution of optically-selected clusters from thepalomar distant cluster survey. the optically-selected clusters appear overlyrich for their x-ray luminosities when compared to x-ray-selected clusters.apparently, x-ray and optical surveys do not necessarily sample identical massconcentrations at large redshifts. this may indicate the existence of apopulation of optically rich clusters with anomalously low x-ray emission. morelikely, however, it reflects the tendency for optical surveys to selectunvirialized mass concentrations, as might be expected when peering alonglarge-scale filaments.

astro-ph;0108476	chandra observation of ms 1455.0+2232: cold fronts in a massive cooling  flow cluster?	we present the chandra observation of the cluster of galaxies ms 1455.0+2232.  from previous asca and rosat observations, this cluster was identified as a``relaxed'' cluster that hosts one of the most massive cooling flows detected.with higher angular resolution, the chandra x-ray image shows the presence oftwo surface brightness edges on opposite sides of the x-ray peak: the first at190 kpc to the north and the second at 450 kpc to the south. even though thelow exposure of this observation limits our ability to constrain thetemperature jump across both edges, we show that the northern edge is likely tobe a ``cold front'' similar to others observed recently by chandra in theclusters a2142, a3667, rx j1720.1+2638, and a2256. the observed cold front ismost likely produced by the motion, from south to north, of a group-size darkmatter halo. the most natural explanation for the presence of this observedmoving subclump is that ms 1455.0+2232 is a merger cluster in the very laststage before it becomes fully relaxed. this scenario, however, appears to beunlikely as the cluster shows no further sign of ongoing merger. moreover, itis not clear if a massive cooling flow could have survived this kind of merger.we propose an alternative scenario in which, as for rx j1720.1+2638, ms1455.0+2232 is the result of the hierarchical collapse of two co-locateddensity perturbations, the first a group-scale perturbation collapse followedby a second cluster-scale perturbation collapse that surrounded, but did notdestroy, the first. we suggest that a cooling flow may have begun inside thealready collapsed group-scale perturbation and may have been later amplified bythe gas compression induced by the infall of the overlying main cluster mass.

astro-ph;0108520	non-hydrostatic gas in the core of the relaxed galaxy cluster a1795	chandra data on a1795 reveal a mild edge-shaped discontinuity in the gasdensity and temperature in the southern sector of the cluster at r=60/h kpc.the gas inside the edge is 1.3-1.5 times denser and cooler than outside, whilethe pressure is continuous, indicating that this is a "cold front", the surfaceof contact between two moving gases. the continuity of the pressure indicatesthat the current relative velocity of the gases is near zero, making the edgeappear to be in hydrostatic equilibrium. however, a total mass profile derivedfrom the data in this sector under the equilibrium assumption, exhibits anunphysical jump by a factor of 2, with the mass inside the edge being lower. wepropose that the cooler gas is "sloshing" in the cluster gravitationalpotential well and is now near the point of maximum displacement, where it haszero velocity but nonzero centripetal acceleration. the distribution of thisnon-hydrostatic gas should reflect the reduced gravity force in theaccelerating reference frame, resulting in the apparent mass discontinuity.assuming that the gas outside the edge is hydrostatic, the acceleration of themoving gas can be estimated from the mass jump, a ~ 800 h km/s/(10^8 yr). thegravitational potential energy of this gas that is available for dissipation isabout half of its current thermal energy. the length of the cool filamentextending from the cd galaxy (fabian et al.) may give the amplitude of the gassloshing, 30-40/h kpc. such gas bulk motion might be caused by a disturbance ofthe central gravitational potential by past subcluster infall.

astro-ph;0109420	chandra observations of cold fronts in cluster of galaxies	high-resolution chandra images of several clusters of galaxies reveal sharp,edge-like discontinuities in their gas density. the gas temperature is higherin front of the edge where the density is low, corresponding to approximatelycontinuous pressure across the edge. this new phenomenon was called ``coldfronts'', to contrast it to shock fronts that should look similar in x-rayimages but where the temperature should jump in the opposite direction. thefirst cold fronts were discovered in merging clusters, where they appear todelineate the boundaries of dense cool subcluster remnants moving through andbeing stripped by the surrounding shock-heated gas. later, chandra revealedcold fronts in the central regions of several apparently relaxed clusters. toexplain the gas bulk motion in these clusters, we propose either a peculiarcluster formation history that resulted in an oscillating core, or gas sloshing(without the involvement of the underlying dark matter peak) caused by pastsubcluster infall or central agn activity. we review these observations anddiscuss their implications for the x-ray cluster mass estimates.

astro-ph;0110468	a textbook example of a bow shock in the merging galaxy cluster  1e0657-56	the chandra image of the merging, hot galaxy cluster 1e0657-56 reveals a bowshock propagating in front of a bullet-like gas cloud just exiting thedisrupted cluster core. this is the first clear example of a shock front in acluster. from the jumps in the gas density and temperature at the shock, themach number of the bullet-like cloud is 2-3. this corresponds to a velocity of3000-4000 km/s relative to the main cluster, which means that the cloudtraversed the core just 0.1-0.2 gyr ago. the 6-7 kev "bullet" appears to be aremnant of a dense cooling flow region once located at the center of a mergingsubcluster whose outer gas has been stripped by ram pressure. the bullet'sshape indicates that it is near the final stage of being destroyed by rampressure and gas dynamic instabilities, as the subcluster galaxies move wellahead of the cool gas. the unique simplicity of the shock front and bulletgeometry in 1e0657-56 may allow a number of interesting future measurements.the cluster's average temperature is 14-15 kev but shows large spatialvariations. the hottest gas (t&gt;20 kev) lies in the region of the radio haloenhancement and extensive merging activity involving subclusters other than thebullet.

astro-ph;0208208	a high resolution picture of the intracluster gas	chandra has significantly advanced our knowledge of the processes in theintracluster gas. the discovery of remarkably regular ``cold fronts'', orcontact discontinuities, in merging clusters showed that gas dynamicinstabilities at the boundaries between the moving gases are often suppressed,most likely by specially structured magnetic fields.  cold fronts are not limited to mergers -- chandra observed them in the coresof more than 2/3 of the cooling flow clusters, where they often divide the coolcentral and the hotter ambient gas phases. the natural state of the low-entropycentral gas in clusters thus appears to be to slosh subsonically in the centralpotential well, with several interesting implications. hydrostatic equilibriumis not reached and the hydrostatic total mass estimates cannot be valid atsmall radii (r&lt;100 kpc). the kinetic energy dissipated by the sloshing gas maybe sufficient to compensate for radiative cooling. in the absence of a recentmerger, the cause of such sloshing is unclear. it might be related to themechanical energy generated by the central agn, evidence of which (the bubbles)is also observed by chandra in a large fraction of the cooling flow clusters.  heat conduction across cold fronts is suppressed completely. in the bulk ofthe gas, it is reduced by a factor of ~10 or more relative to the classicvalue, as shown by merger temperature maps. a spatial correlation between thegas temperature maps and the radio halo maps is observed in several mergers,which may provide clues for the relativistic particle acceleration mechanisms.

astro-ph;0301367	chandra temperature map of abell 754 and constraints on thermal  conduction	we use chandra data to derive a detailed gas temperature map of the nearby,hot, merging galaxy cluster a754. combined with the x-ray and optical images,the map reveals a more complex merger geometry than previously thought,possibly involving more than two subclusters or a cool gas cloud sloshingindependently from its former host subcluster. in the cluster central region,we detect spatial variations of the gas temperature on all linear scales, from100 kpc (the map resolution) and up, which likely remain from a merger shockpassage. these variations are used to derive an upper limit on effectivethermal conductivity on a 100 kpc scale, which is at least an order ofmagnitude lower than the spitzer value. this constraint pertains to the bulk ofthe intracluster gas, as compared to the previously reported estimates for coldfronts (which are rather peculiar sites). if the conductivity in a tangledmagnetic field is at the recently predicted higher values (i.e., about 1/5 ofthe spitzer value), the observed suppression can be achieved, for example, ifthe intracluster gas consists of magnetically isolated domains.

astro-ph;0305549	constraining amplitude and slope of the mass fluctuation spectrum using  cluster baryon mass function	we derive the baryon mass function for a complete sample of low-redshiftclusters and argue that it is an excellent proxy for the total mass function ifthe ratio f_b=m_b/m_tot in all clusters is close to its universal value,omega_b/omega_m. under this assumption, the baryon mass function can be used toconstrain the amplitude and slope of the density fluctuations power spectrum oncluster scales. this method does not use observational determinations of thetotal mass and thus bypasses major uncertainties in the traditional analysesbased on the x-ray temperature function. however, it is sensitive to possiblesystematic variations of the baryon fraction as a function of cluster mass.adapting a weak dependence f_b(m) suggested by observations and numericalsimulations by bialek et al., we derive sigma_8=0.72+-0.04 and the shapeparameter omega_m*h=0.13+-0.07, in good agreement with a number of independentmethods. we discuss the sensitivity of these values to other cosmologicalparameters and to different assumptions about variations in f_b.

astro-ph;0308037	chandra observations of the ngc 1550 galaxy group -- implication for the  temperature and entropy profiles of 1 kev galaxy groups	we present a detailed \chandra study of the galaxy group ngc 1550. for itstemperature (1.37$\pm$0.01 kev) and velocity dispersion ($\sim$ 300 kms$^{-1}$), the ngc 1550 group is one of the most luminous known galaxy groups(l$_{\rm bol}$ = 1.65$\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ within 200 kpc, or 0.2 \rv).we find that within $\sim 60$ kpc, where the gas cooling time is less than ahubble time, the gas temperature decreases continuously toward the center,implying the existence of a cooling core. the temperature also declines beyond$\sim$ 100 kpc (or 0.1 \rv). there is a remarkable similarity of thetemperature profile of ngc 1550 with those of two other 1 kev groups withaccurate temperature determination. the temperature begins to decline at 0.07 -0.1 \rv, while in hot clusters the decline begins at or beyond 0.2 \rv. thus,there are at least some 1 kev groups that have significantly differenttemperature profiles from those of hot clusters, which may reflect the role ofnon-gravitational processes in icm/igm evolution. ngc 1550 has no isentropiccore in its entropy profile, in contrast to the predictions of `entropy-floor'simulations. we compare the scaled entropy profiles of three 1 kev groups(including ngc 1550) and three 2 - 3 kev groups. the scaled entropy profiles of1 kev groups show much larger scatter than those of hotter systems, whichimplies varied pre-heating levels. we also discuss the mass content of the ngc1550 group and the abundance profile of heavy elements.

astro-ph;0309303	direct constraints on the dark matter self-interaction cross-section  from the merging galaxy cluster 1e0657-56	we compare new maps of the hot gas, dark matter, and galaxies for 1e0657-56,a cluster with a rare, high-velocity merger occurring nearly in the plane ofthe sky. the x-ray observations reveal a bullet-like gas subcluster justexiting the collision site. a prominent bow shock gives an estimate of thesubcluster velocity, 4500 km/s, which lies mostly in the plane of the sky. theoptical image shows that the gas lags behind the subcluster galaxies. theweak-lensing mass map reveals a dark matter clump lying ahead of thecollisional gas bullet, but coincident with the effectively collisionlessgalaxies. from these observations, one can directly estimate the cross-sectionof the dark matter self-interaction. that the dark matter is not fluid-like isseen directly in the x-ray -- lensing mass overlay; more quantitative limitscan be derived from three simple independent arguments. the most sensitiveconstraint, sigma/m&lt;1 cm^2/g, comes from the consistency of the subclustermass-to-light ratio with the main cluster (and universal) value, which rulesout a significant mass loss due to dark matter particle collisions. this limitexcludes most of the 0.5-5 cm^2/g interval proposed to explain the flat massprofiles in galaxies. our result is only an order-of-magnitude estimate whichinvolves a number of simplifying, but always conservative, assumptions;stronger constraints may be derived using hydrodynamic simulations of thiscluster.

astro-ph;0312576	reflections of agn outbursts in the gaseous atmosphere of m87	we combined deep chandra, rosat hri, and xmm-newton observations of m87 tostudy the impact of agn outbursts on its gaseous atmosphere. many x-rayfeatures appear to be a direct result of repetitive agn outbursts. inparticular, the x-ray cavities around the jet and counter jet are likely due tothe expansion of radio plasma, while rings of enhanced emission at 14 and 17kpc are probably shock fronts associated with outbursts that began1-2\times10^7 years ago. the effects of these shocks are also seen inbrightenings within the prominent x-ray arms. on larger scales, ~50 kpc fromthe nucleus, depressions in the surface brightness may be remnants of earlieroutbursts. as suggested for the perseus cluster (fabian et al.), our analysisof the energetics of the m87 outbursts argues that shocks may be the mostsignificant channel for agn energy input into the cooling flow atmospheres ofgalaxies, groups, and clusters. for m87, the mean power driving the shockoutburst, 2.4\times 10^{43} ergs/sec, is three times greater than the radiativelosses from the entire ``cooling flow''. thus, even in the absence of otherenergy inputs, outbursts every 3\times10^7 years are sufficient to quench theflow.

astro-ph;0405511	eso 3060170 -- a massive fossil galaxy group with a heated gas core?	we present a detailed study of the eso 3060170 galaxy group combiningchandra, xmm and optical observations. the system is found to be a fossilgalaxy group. the group x-ray emission is composed of a central dense cool core(10 kpc in radius) and an isothermal medium beyond the central 10 kpc. theregion between 10 and 50 kpc (the cooling radius) has the same temperature asthe gas from 50 kpc to 400 kpc although the gas cooling time between 10 and 50kpc (2 - 6 gyr) is shorter than the hubble time. thus, the eso 3060170 groupdoes not have a group-sized cooling core. we suggest that the group coolingcore may have been heated by a central agn outburst in the past and the smalldense cool core is the truncated relic of a previous cooling core. the chandraobservations also reveal a variety of x-ray features in the central region,including a ``finger'', an edge-like feature and a small ``tail'', all alignedalong a north-south axis, as are the galaxy light and group galaxydistribution. the proposed agn outburst may cause gas ``sloshing'' around thecenter and produce these asymmetric features. the observed flat temperatureprofile to 1/3 r_vir is not consistent with the predicted temperature profilein recent numerical simulations. we compare the entropy profile of the eso3060170 group with those of three other groups and find a flatter relation thanthat predicted by simulations involving only shock heating, s $\propto$ r$^{~0.85}$. this is direct evidence for the importance of non-gravitationalprocesses in group centers. we derive the mass profiles within 1/3 r_vir andfind the eso 3060170 group is the most massive fossil group known (1 - 2 x10$^{14}$ m$_{\odot}$). the m/l ratio of the system, ~ 150 at 0.3 r_vir, isnormal.

astro-ph;0408159	infall of the elliptical galaxy ngc 1404 into the fornax cluster	we use three chandra observations, totalling 134.3 ks, to constrain thedynamical motion of ngc1404 falling towards the dominant elliptical ngc1399through the fornax icm. ngc1404's surface brightness profile shows a sharp edge\~8 kpc from its center in the direction of ngc 1399, characteristic ofjump-like temperature and density discontinuities from ram-pressure strippingof the galaxy gas. we find the temperature of the galaxy gas inside the edge is\~2.8 times cooler (kt=0.55^{+0.01}_{-0.02} kev; abundance a =0.73^{+0.65}_{-0.16} solar) than the cluster gas (kt,a = 1.53^{+0.10}_{-0.13}kev, 0.42^{+0.2}_{-0.13} solar). we use the shape of the surface brightnessprofile to fit the edge position, power law index of the density distributioninside the edge, and density discontinuity at the edge. the electron densityinside the edge (3.9-4.3 x 10^{-3} cm^{-3}) depends strongly on the gasabundance; while the density of the icm (7-8 x10^{-4} cm^{-3}) depends stronglyon the assumed relative distance between ngc1404 and ngc1399. the pressure jump(1.7-2.1) across the edge and the cluster free-stream region implies a machnumber 0.83-1.03 and velocity 531-657 km/s for ngc1404 relative to the icm. theinclination angle of the motion inferred using the relative radial velocitybetween ngc1404 and ngc1399 as representative of that between ngc1404 and theicm, is uncomfortably large (&gt;40 deg.) given the sharpness of the edge,suggesting either a non-zero impact parameter between the galaxies, or thatngc1399 is moving radially with respect to the cluster icm.

astro-ph;0703553	the representative xmm-newton cluster structure survey (rexcess) of an  x-ray luminosity selected galaxy cluster sample	the largest uncertainty for cosmological studies using clusters of galaxiesis introduced by our limited knowledge of the statistics of galaxy clusterstructure, and of the scaling relations between observables and cluster mass.to improve on this situation we have started an xmm-newton large programme forthe in-depth study of a representative sample of 33 galaxy clusters, selectedin the redshift range z=0.055 to 0.183 from the reflex cluster survey, havingx-ray luminosities above 0.4 x 10^44 h_70^-2 erg s^-1 in the 0.1 - 2.4 kevband. this paper introduces the sample, compiles properties of the clusters,and provides detailed information on the sample selection function. we describethe selection of a nearby galaxy cluster sample that makes optimal use of thexmm-newton field-of-view, and provides nearly homogeneous x-ray luminositycoverage for the full range from poor clusters to the most massive objects inthe universe. for the clusters in the sample, x-ray fluxes are derived andcompared to the previously obtained fluxes from the rosat all-sky survey. wefind that the fluxes and the flux errors have been reliably determined in therosat all-sky survey analysis used for the reflex survey. we use the sampleselection function documented in detail in this paper to determine the x-rayluminosity function, and compare it with the luminosity function of the entirereflex sample. we also discuss morphological peculiarities of some of thesample members. the sample and some of the background data given in thisintroductory paper will be important for the application of these data in thedetailed studies of cluster structure, to appear in forthcoming publications.

astro-ph;9603118	two distinct modes in the low (hard) state of cyg x-1 and 1e1740-294	the entire dataset of the granat/sigma observations of cyg x-1 and1e1740.7-294 in 1990-1994 was analyzed in order to search for correlationsbetween primary observational characteristics of the hard x-ray emission - hardx-ray luminosity l_x, hardness of the spectrum (quantified in terms of the bestfit thermal bremsstrahlung temperature kt) and the rms of short term fluxvariations. two distinct modes of the kt vs. l_x dependence were found for bothsources. at low luminosity - below the level corresponding approximately to thegamma_1 state of cyg x-1 - the kt increases as the l_x increases. above theluminosity level of ~1.2l_gamma_1 the spectrum hardness is nearly constant (kt~150 kev) and does not depend on the luminosity. in the case of cyg x-1 thecorrelation of similar kind was found between the spectrum hardness and rms ofthe short term flux variations. the increase of the kt, corresponding to theincreasing branch on the kt vs. l_x diagram, is accompanied with increase ofthe rms from few percent level to ~10-15%. further increase of the rms is notaccompanied with change of the kt and does not correlate with changes in theluminosity.

astro-ph;9705145	dark matter and baryon fraction at the virial radius in abell 2256	we combine asca and rosat x-ray data to constrain the radial dark matterdistribution in the primary cluster of a2256, free from the isothermalityassumption. both instruments indicate that the temperature declines withradius. the region including the central galaxy has a multicomponent spectrum,which results in a wide range of allowed central temperatures. we find that thesecondary subcluster has a temperature and luminosity typical of a richcluster; however, the asca temperature map shows no signs of an advancedmerger. it is therefore assumed that the primary cluster is in hydrostaticequilibrium. the data then require dark matter density profiles steeper thanrho ~ r^-2.5 in its outer part. acceptable models have a total mass withinr=1.5 mpc (the virial radius) of 6.0+-1.5 10^14 msun at the 90% confidence,about 1.6 times smaller than the mass derived assuming isothermality. near thecenter, dark matter profiles with and without central cusps are consistent withthe data. total mass inside the x-ray core (r=0.26 mpc) is 1.28+-0.08 10^14msun, which exceeds the isothermal value by a factor of 1.4. although theconfidence intervals above may be underestimates since they do not includepossible asymmetry and departures from hydrostatic equilibrium, the behavior ofthe mass distribution, if applicable to other clusters, can bring into betteragreement x-ray and lensing mass estimates, but aggravate the ``baryoncatastrophe''. the observed considerable increase in the gas content withradius, not anticipated by simulations, may imply that a significant fractionof thermal gas energy comes from sources other than gravity and merger shocks.

astro-ph;9711289	the temperature structure of 30 nearby clusters observed with asca.  similarity of temperature profiles	we present asca temperature profiles and, when possible, crude temperaturemaps for a sample of bright clusters with 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.09. together with severalpreviously published clusters, the sample includes a85, a119, a399, a401, a478,a644, a754, a780, a1650, a1651, a1795, a2029, a2065, a2142, a2256, a2319,a2597, a2657, a3112, a3266, a3376, a3391, a3395, a3558, a3571, a3667, a4059,cygnus a, mkw3s, and triangulum australis. nearly all clusters show asignificant radial temperature decline. for a typical 7 kev cluster, thetemperature decline between 1 and 6 x-ray core radii (0.15 and 0.9/h mpc) canbe approximately quantified by a polytropic index of 1.2-1.3. assuming such apolytropic temperature profile, the gravitating mass within 1 and within 6 coreradii is approximately 1.35 and 0.7 times the isothermal beta-model estimates,respectively.  most interestingly, we find that temperature profiles, excluding those forthe most asymmetric clusters, appear remarkably similar when plotted againstradius in units of the estimated virial radius. we compare the compositetemperature profile to the published hydrodynamic simulations. the observedprofiles appear steeper than those in most lagrangian simulations (evrard etal1996; eke etal 1997). the predictions for omega=1 models are most discrepant,while models with low omega are closer to our data. we note, however, that atleast one omega=1 lagrangian simulation (katz &amp; white 1993) and the recenthigh-resolution eulerian simulation (bryan &amp; norman 1997) produced clusterswith temperature profiles similar to or steeper than those observed. ourresults thus provide a new constraint for adjusting numerical simulations and,potentially, discriminating among models of cluster formation.

astro-ph;9802183	the rich cluster of galaxies abcg 85. iii. analyzing the abcg 85/87/89  complex	we present a combined x-ray and optical analysis of the abcg 85/87/89 complexof clusters of galaxies, based on the rosat pspc image, optical photometriccatalogues (slezak et al. 1998), and an optical redshift catalogue (durret etal. 1998). from this combined data set, we find striking alignments at allscales at pa$\simeq$160\deg. at small scales, the cd galaxy in abcg 85 and thebrightest galaxies in the cluster are aligned along this pa. at a larger scale,x-ray emission defines a comparable pa south-southeast of abcg 85 towards abcg87, with a patchy x-ray structure very different from the regular shape of theoptical galaxy distribution in abcg 87. the galaxy velocities in the abcg 87region show the existence of subgroups, which all have an x-ray counterpart,and seem to be falling onto abcg 85 along a filament almost perpendicular tothe plane of the sky. to the west of abcg 85, abcg 89 appears as a significantgalaxy density enhancement, but is barely detected at x-ray wavelengths. thegalaxy velocities reveal that in fact this is not a cluster but two groups withvery different velocities superimposed along the line of sight. these twogroups appear to be located in intersecting sheets on opposite sides of a largebubble. these data and their interpretation reinforce the cosmological scenarioin which matter, including galaxies, groups and gas, falls onto the clusteralong a filament.

astro-ph;9803101	evolution of cluster x-ray luminosities and radii: results from the 160  square degree rosat survey	we searched for cluster x-ray luminosity and radius evolution using oursample of 200 galaxy clusters detected in the 160 deg^2 survey with the rosatpspc (vikhlinin et al. 1998, astro-ph/9803099). with such a large area survey,it is possible, for the first time with rosat, to test the evolution ofluminous clusters, lx &gt; 3x10^44 erg/s, in the 0.5-2 kev band. we detect afactor of 3-4 deficit of such luminous clusters at z&gt;0.3 compared to thepresent. the evolution is much weaker or absent at modestly lower luminosities,1-3x10^44 erg/s. at still lower luminosities, we find no evolution from theanalysis of the log n - log s relation. the results in the two upper lx binsare in agreement with the einstein emss evolution result (gioia et al. 1990a,henry et al. 1992) while being obtained using a completely independent clustersample. the low-lx results are in agreement with other rosat surveys (e.g.rosati et al. 1998, jones et al. 1998).  we also compare the distribution of core radii of nearby and distant (z&gt;0.4)luminous (with equivalent temperatures 4-7 kev) clusters, and detect noevolution. the ratio of average core radius for z~0.5 and z&lt;0.1 clusters is0.9+/-0.1, and the core radius distributions are remarkably similar. a decreaseof cluster sizes incompatible with our data is predicted by self-similarevolution models for high-omega universe.

astro-ph;9812005	physics of the merging clusters cygnus a, a3667, and a2065	we present asca gas temperature maps of the nearby merging galaxy clusterscygnus a, a3667, and a2065. cygnus a appears to have a particularly simplemerger geometry that allows an estimate of the subcluster collision velocityfrom the observed temperature variations. we estimate it to be ~2000 km/s.interestingly, this is similar to the free-fall velocity that the two cygnus asubclusters should have achieved at the observed separation, suggesting thatmerger has been effective in dissipating the kinetic energy of gas halos intothermal energy, without channeling its major fraction elsewhere (e.g., intoturbulence). in a3667, we may be observing a spatial lag between the shockfront seen in the x-ray image and the corresponding rise of the electrontemperature. a lag of the order of hundreds of kiloparsecs is possible due tothe combination of thermal conduction and a finite electron-ion equilibrationtime. forthcoming better spatial resolution data will allow a directmeasurement of these phenomena using such lags. a2065 has gas density peakscoincident with two central galaxies. a merger with the collision velocityestimated from the temperature map should have swept away such peaks if thesubcluster total mass distributions had flat cores in the centers. the factthat the peaks have survived (or quickly reemerged) suggests that thegravitational potential also is strongly peaked. finally, the observed specificentropy variations in a3667 and cygnus a indicate that energy injection from asingle major merger may be of the order of the full thermal energy of the gas.we hope that these order of magnitude estimates will encourage further work onhydrodynamic simulations, as well as more quantitative representation of thesimulation results.

astro-ph;9903052	x-ray over-luminous elliptical galaxies: a new class of mass  concentrations in the universe?	we detect four isolated, x-ray over-luminous (lx&gt;2e43 [h/0.5]**-2 erg/s)elliptical galaxies (olegs) in our 160 square degree rosat pspc survey. theextent of their x-ray emission, total x-ray luminosity, total mass, and mass ofthe hot gas in these systems correspond to poor clusters, and the opticalluminosity of the central galaxies (m_r&lt;-22.5 + 5 lg h) is comparable to thatof cluster cds. however, there are no detectable fainter galaxy concentrationsaround the central elliptical. the mass-to-light ratio within the radius ofdetectable x-ray emission is in the range 250-450 msun/lsun, which is 2-3 timeshigher than typically found in clusters or groups. these objects can be theresult of galaxy merging within a group. however, their high m/l values aredifficult to explain in this scenario. olegs must have been undisturbed for avery long time, which makes them the ultimate examples of systmes inhydrostatic equilibrium. the number density of olegs is n=2.4(+3.1-1.2}x10**-7(h/0.5)**-3 mpc**-3 at the 90% confidence. they comprise 20% of all clustersand groups of comparable x-ray luminosity, and nearly all galaxies brighterthan m_r=-22.5. the estimated contirubution of olegs to the total mass densityin the universe is close to that of t&gt;7 kev clusters.

astro-ph;9904382	mass profiles of the typical relaxed galaxy clusters a2199 and a496	we present maps and radial profiles of the gas temperature in the nearbygalaxy clusters a2199 and a496, which have the most accurate asca spectral datafor all hot clusters. these clusters are relaxed and can provide reliable x-raymass measurements under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. the clusteraverage temperatures corrected for the presence of cooling flows are 4.8+-0.2kev and 4.7+-0.2 kev (90% errors), respectively. outside the central coolingflow regions, the radial temperature profiles are similar to those of themajority of nearby relaxed clusters. they are accurately described bypolytropic models with gamma=1.17+-0.07 for a2199 and gamma=1.24+-0.09 fora496. we use these polytropic models to derive accurate total mass profiles.within r=0.5/h mpc, which corresponds to a radius of overdensity 1000, thetotal mass values are 1.45+-0.15 10^14 /h msun and 1.55+-0.15 10^14 /h msun.these values are 10% lower than those obtained assuming constant temperature.the values inside a gas core radius (0.07-0.13/h mpc) are a factor of &gt;1.5higher than the isothermal values. the gas mass fraction increases with radius(by a factor of 3 between the x-ray core radius and r_1000) and at r_1000reaches values of 0.057+-0.005 and 0.056+-0.006 h^-3/2 for the two clusters,respectively. our mass profiles within r_1000 are remarkably well approximatedby the nfw "universal" profile. since a2199 and a496 are typical relaxedclusters, the above findings should be relevant for most such systems. inparticular, the similarity of the temperature profiles in nearby clustersappears to reflect the underlying "universal" dark matter profile. the upwardrevision of mass at small radii will resolve most of the discrepancy betweenthe x-ray and strong lensing mass estimates.

astro-ph;9905200	outer regions of the cluster gaseous atmospheres	we present a systematic study of the hot gas distribution in the outerregions of regular clusters using rosat pspc data. outside the cooling flowregion, the beta-model describes the observed surface brightness closely, butnot precisely. between 0.3 and 1 virial radii, the profiles are characterizedby a power law with slope, expressed in terms of the beta parameter, in therange beta=0.65 to 0.85. the values of beta in this range of radii aretypically larger by ~0.05 than those derived from the global fit. there is amild trend for the slope to increase with temperature, from &lt;beta&gt;~0.68 for 3kev clusters to ~0.8 for 10 kev clusters; however, even at high temperaturesthere are clusters with flat gas profiles, 0.7. our values of beta at largeradius are systematically higher, and the trend of beta with temperature isweaker than was previously found; the most likely explanation is that earlierstudies were affected by an incomplete exclusion of the central cooling flowregions. for our regular clusters, the gas distribution at large radii is quiteclose to spherically symmetric and this is shown not to be an artifact of thesample selection. the gas density profiles are very similar when compared inthe units of cluster virial radius. the radius of fixed mean gas overdensity1000 (corresponding to the dark matter overdensity 200 for omega=0.2) shows atight correlation with temperature, r~t**0.5, as expected from the virialtheorem for clusters with the universal gas fraction. at a given temperature,the rms scatter of the gas overdensity radius is only ~7% which translates intoa 20% scatter of the gas mass fraction, including statistical scatter due tomeasurement uncertainties.

astro-ph;9906170	a method of mass measurement in black hole binaries using timing and  high resolution x-ray spectroscopy	in x-ray binaries, several percent of the compact object luminosity isintercepted by the surface of the normal companion and re-radiated throughcompton reflection and the k-fluorescence. this reflected emission follows thevariability of the compact object with a delay approximately equal to theorbital radius divided by the speed of light. this provides the possibility ofmeasuring the orbital radius and thus substantially refining the compact objectmass determination compared to using optical data alone. we demonstrate that itmay be feasible to measure the time delay between the direct and reflectedemission using cross-correlation of the light curves observed near the kalphaline and above the k-edge of neutral iron. in the case of cyg x-1, the timedelay measurement is feasible with a 300--1000 ksec observation by a telescopewith a 1000 cm^2 effective area near 6.4 kev and with a ~5ev energy resolution.with longer exposures, it may be possible to obtain mass constraints even if anx-ray source in the binary system lacks an optical counterpart.
