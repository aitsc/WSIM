0903.0183	what is driving the hi velocity dispersion?	we explore what dominant physical mechanism sets the kinetic energy containedin neutral, atomic (hi) gas. we compare the hi line widths predicted fromturbulence driven by supernova (sn) explosions and magneto-rotationalinstability (mri) to direct observations in 11 disk galaxies. we usehigh-quality maps of the hi mass surface density and line width, obtained bythe things survey. we show that all sample galaxies exhibit a systematic radialdecline in the hi line width, which appears to be a generic property of hidisks and also implies a radial decline in kinetic energy density of hi. at agalactocentric radius of r25 there is a characteristic value of the hi velocitydispersion of $10\pm2$ \kms. inside this radius, galaxies show hi line widthsabove the thermal value expected from a warm hi component, implying thatturbulence drivers must be responsible for maintaining this line width.therefore, we compare maps of hi kinetic energy to maps of the star formationrate (sfr) and to predictions for energy generated by mri. we find a positivecorrelation between kinetic energy of hi and sfr. for a given turbulencedissipation timescale we can estimate the energy input required to maintain theobserved kinetic energy. the sn rate implied by the observed recent sfr issufficient to maintain the observed velocity dispersion, if the sn feedbackefficiency is at least \epsilon_sn\simeq0.1. beyond r25, this efficiency wouldhave to increase to unrealistic values, $\epsilon&gt;1$, suggesting thatmechanical energy from young stars does not supply most energy in outer disks.on the other hand, both thermal broadening and turbulence driven by mri canproduce the velocity dispersions and kinetic energies that we observe in thisregime.

0905.4742	heracles: the hera co-line extragalactic survey	we present the hera co-line extragalactic survey (heracles), an atlas of coemission from 18 nearby galaxies that are also part of the hi nearby galaxysurvey (things) and the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings). weused the hera multi-pixel receiver on the iram 30-m telescope to map the coj=2-1 line over the full optical disk (defined by the isophotal radius r_25) ofeach target, at 13" angular resolution and 2.6 km/s velocity resolution. herewe describe the observations and reduction of the data and show channel maps,azimuthally averaged profiles, integrated intensity maps, and peak intensitymaps. the implied h2 masses range from 7 \times 10^6 to 6 \times 10^9 m_sun,with four low metallicity dwarf irregular galaxies yielding only upper limits.in the cases where co is detected, the integrated h2-to-hi ratios range from0.02 - 1.13 and h2-to-stellar mass ratios from 0.01 to 0.25. exponential scalelengths of the co emission for our targets are in the range 0.8 - 3.2 kpc, or0.2 \pm 0.05 r_25. the intensity-weighted mean velocity of co matches that ofhi very well, with a 1\sigma scatter of only 6 km/s. the co j=2-1 / j=1-0 lineratio varies over a range similar to that found in the milky way and othernearby galaxies, \sim 0.6 - 1.0, with higher values found in the centers ofgalaxies. the typical line ratio, \sim 0.8, could be produced by opticallythick gas with an excitation temperature of \sim 10 k.

0907.5533	the baryonic tully-fisher relation and its implication for dark matter  halos	the baryonic tully-fisher relation (btf) is a fundamental relation betweenbaryonic mass and maximum rotation velocity. it can be used to estimatedistances, as well as to constrain the properties of dark matter and itsrelation with the visible matter. in this paper, we explore if extremelylow-mass dwarf galaxies follow the same btf relation as high-mass galaxies. wequantify the scatter in the btf relation and use this to constrain the allowedelongations of dark matter halo potentials. we obtained hi synthesis data of 11dwarf galaxies and derive several independent estimates for the maximumrotation velocity. constructing a btf relation using data from the literaturefor the high-mass end, and galaxies with detected rotation from our sample forthe low-mass end results in a btf with a scatter of 0.33 mag. this scatterconstrains the ellipticities of the potentials in the plane of the disks of thegalaxies to an upper limit of 0-0.06 indicating that dwarf galaxies are at mostonly mildly tri-axial. our results indicate that the btf relation is afundamental relation which all rotationally dominated galaxies seem to follow.

0908.0693	quantified morphology of hi disks in the universe	he upcoming new perspective of the high redshift universe in the 21 cm lineof atomic hydrogen opens possibilities to explore topics of spiral diskevolution, hitherto reserved for the optical regime. the growth of spiral gasdisks over cosmic time can be explored with the new generation of radiotelescopes, notably the ska, and its precursors, as accurately as with thehubble space telescope for stellar disks. since the atomic hydrogen gas is thebuilding block of these disks, it should trace their formation accurately.morphology of hi disks can now equally be quantified over cosmic time. instudies of hst deep fields, the optical or uv morphology of high-redshiftgalaxy disks have been characterized using a few quantities: concentration (c),asymmetry (a), smoothness (s), second-order-moment (m20), the gini coefficient(g), and ellipticity (e). we have applied these parameters across wavelengthsand compared them to the hi morphology over the things sample. ngc 3184, anunperturbed disk, and ngc 5194, the canonical 3:1 interaction, serve asexamples for quantified morphology. we find that morphology parametersdetermined in hi are as good or better a tracer of interaction compared tothose in any other wavelength, notably in asymmetry, gini and m20. this opensthe possibility of using them in the parameterization pipeline for skaprecursor catalogues to select interacting or harassed galaxies from their himorphology. asymmetry, gini and m20 may be redefined for use on data-cubesrather than hi column density image.

1007.3498	extremely inefficient star formation in the outer disks of nearby  galaxies	(abridged) we combine data from the hi nearby galaxy survey and the galexnearby galaxy survey to study the relationship between atomic hydrogen (hi) andfar-ultraviolet (fuv) emission outside the optical radius (r25) in 17 spiraland 5 dwarf galaxies. in this regime, hi is likely to represent most of the ismand fuv emission to trace recent star formation with little bias due toextinction, so that the two quantities closely trace the underlyingrelationship between gas and star formation rate (sfr). the azimuthallyaveraged hi and fuv intensities both decline with increasing radius in thisregime, with the scale length of the fuv profile typically half that of the hiprofile. despite the mismatch in profiles, there is a significant spatialcorrelation (at 15" resolution) between local fuv and hi intensities; near r25this correlation is quite strong, in fact stronger than anywhere inside r25,and shows a decline towards larger radii. the star formation efficiency (sfe) -defined as the ratio of fuv/hi and thus the inverse of the gas depletion time -decreases with galactocentric radius across the outer disks, though muchshallower than across the optical disks. on average, we find the gas depletiontimes to be well above a hubble time (~10^11 yr). we observe a clearrelationship between fuv/hi and hi column in the outer disks, with the sfeincreasing with increasing hi column. despite observing systematic variationsin fuv/hi, we find no clear evidence for step-function type star formationthresholds. when compared with results from inside r25, we find outer disk starformation to be distinct in several ways: it is extremely inefficient(depletion times of many hubble times) with column densities and sfrs lowerthan found anywhere inside the optical disks. it appears that the hi column isone of, perhaps even the key environmental factor in setting the sfr in outergalaxy disks.

1008.1845	the fine-scale structure of the neutral interstellar medium in nearby  galaxies	we present an analysis of the properties of hi holes detected in 20 galaxiesthat are part of "the hi nearby galaxy survey" (things). we detected more than1000 holes in total in the sampled galaxies. where they can be measured, theirsizes range from about 100 pc (our resolution limit) to about 2 kpc, theirexpansion velocities range from 4 to 36 km/s, and their ages are estimated torange between 3 and 150 myr. the holes are found throughout the disks of thegalaxies, out to the edge of the hi; 23% of the holes fall outside r25. we findthat shear limits the age of holes in spirals (shear is less important in dwarfgalaxies) which explains why hi holes in dwarfs are rounder, on average than inspirals. shear, which is particularly strong in the inner part of spiralgalaxies, also explains why we find that holes outside r25 are larger andolder. we derive the scale height of the hi disk as a function ofgalactocentric radius and find that the disk flares up in all galaxies. weproceed to derive the surface and volume porosity (q2d and q3d) and find thatthis correlates with the type of the host galaxy: later hubble types tend to bemore porous. the size distribution of the holes in our sample follows a powerlaw with a slope of a ~ -2.9. assuming that the holes are the result of massivestar formation, we derive values for the supernova rate (snr) and starformation rate (sfr) which scales with the sfr derived based on other tracers.if we extrapolate the observed number of holes to include those that fall belowour resolution limit, down to holes created by a single supernova, we find thatour results are compatible with the hypothesis that hi holes result from starformation.

1009.1753	a search for non-circular flows in the extended hi disc of ngc 2915	ngc 2915 is a nearby blue compact dwarf with a differentially rotating hidisc extending out to ~ 5 r-band r_{25} radii. this disc serves as an idealtracer of the system's gravitational potential in regions of the galaxy thatare dominated by dark matter. we use new hi synthesis observations of ngc 2915,obtained with the australia telescope compact array, to search for non-circularflows within the outer hi disc. two independent methods are used, and theresults of each interpreted in the context of relevant axisymmetric andnon-axisymmetric perturbations of the potential. we find evidence for: (1)elliptical streaming associated with the spiral structure of the hi disc andthe central bar-like feature in the mass distribution, (2) a spherical darkmatter halo, and (3) an axisymmetric radial outflow of ~ 5-17 km/s (~ 6-20percent of the circular speed). a possible bar-like perturbation of thepotential hinders attempts to unambiguously detect kinematic signatures ofradial flows in the hi velocity field. the radial outflows are inconsistentwith the plausible disc formation scenario in which gas from the surroundinginter-galactic medium is deposited on the outer hi disc and then transportedtowards the centre of the galaxy. they are, however, consistent with thepossibility of some material being re-distributed towards the outer disc inorder to conserve angular momentum as material flows inwards along a bar.

1010.1940	hierarchical stellar structures in the local group dwarf galaxy ngc 6822	we present a comprehensive study of the star cluster population and thehierarchical structure in the clustering of blue stars with ages &lt;~ 500 myr inthe local group dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 6822. our observational materialcomprises the most complete optical stellar catalog of the galaxy from imagingwith the suprime-cam at the 8.2-m subaru telescope. we identify 47 distinctstar clusters with the application of the nearest-neighbor density method tothis catalog for a detection threshold of 3sigma above the average stellardensity. the size distribution of the detected clusters can be very wellapproximated by a gaussian with a peak at ~ 68 pc. their cluster mass functionis fitted very well by a power-law with index alpha ~ 1.5 +/- 0.7, consistentwith other local group galaxies and the cluster initial mass function. theapplication of the nearest-neighbor density method for various densitythresholds, other than 3sigma, enabled the identification of stellarconcentrations in various length-scales. the stellar density maps constructedwith this technique provide a direct proof of hierarchically structured stellarconcentrations in ngc 6822. we illustrate this hierarchy by the so-called"dendrogram" of the detected stellar structures, which demonstrates that mostof the detected structures split up into several substructures over at leastthree levels. we quantify the hierarchy of these structures with the use of theminimum spanning tree method. the morphological hierarchy in stellarclustering, which we observe in ngc 6822 resembles that of the turbulentinterstellar matter, suggesting that turbulence on pc- and kpc-scales has beenprobably the major agent that regulated clustered star formation in ngc 6822.

1011.0899	dark and luminous matter in things dwarf galaxies	we present mass models for the dark matter component of seven dwarf galaxiestaken from "the hi nearby galaxy survey" (things) and compare these with thosefrom numerical lambda cold dark matter (lcdm) simulations. the thingshigh-resolution data significantly reduce observational uncertainties and thusallow us to derive accurate dark matter distributions in these systems. we hereuse the bulk velocity fields when deriving the rotation curves of the galaxies.compared to other types of velocity fields, the bulk velocity field minimizesthe effect of small-scale random motions more effectively and traces theunderlying kinematics of a galaxy more properly. the "spitzer infrared nearbygalaxies survey" (sings) 3.6 micron and ancillary optical data are used forseparating the baryons from their total matter content in the galaxies. thesample dwarf galaxies are found to be dark matter dominated over most radii. wefind discrepancies between the derived dark matter distributions of thegalaxies and those of lcdm simulations, even after corrections for non-circularmotions have been applied. the observed solid body-like rotation curves of thegalaxies rise too slowly to reflect the cusp-like dark matter distribution incdm halos. instead, they are better described by core-like models such aspseudo-isothermal halo models dominated by a central constant-density core. themean value of the logarithmic inner slopes of the mass density profiles isalpha = -0.29 +- 0.07. they are significantly different from the steep slope of~ -1.0 inferred from previous dark-matter-only simulations, and are moreconsistent with shallower slopes found in recent lcdm simulations of dwarfgalaxies in which the effects of baryonic feedback processes are included.

1011.2777	the central slope of dark matter cores in dwarf galaxies: simulations  vs. things	we make a direct comparison of the derived dark matter (dm) distributionsbetween hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies assuming a lcdm cosmologyand the observed dwarf galaxies sample from the things survey in terms of (1)the rotation curve shape and (2) the logarithmic inner density slope alpha ofmass density profiles. the simulations, which include the effect of baryonicfeedback processes, such as gas cooling, star formation, cosmic uv backgroundheating and most importantly physically motivated gas outflows driven bysupernovae (sne), form bulgeless galaxies with dm cores. we show that thestellar and baryonic mass is similar to that inferred from photometric andkinematic methods for galaxies of similar circular velocity. analyzing thesimulations in exactly the same way as the observational sample allows us toaddress directly the so-called "cusp/core" problem in the lcdm model. we showthat the rotation curves of the simulated dwarf galaxies rise less steeply thancdm rotation curves and are consistent with those of the things dwarf galaxies.the mean value of the logarithmic inner density slopes alpha of the simulatedgalaxies' dark matter density profiles is ~ -0.4 +- 0.1, which shows goodagreement with \alpha = -0.29 +- 0.07 of the things dwarf galaxies. the effectof non-circular motions is not significant enough to affect the results. thisconfirms that the baryonic feedback processes included in the simulations areefficiently able to make the initial cusps with \alpha ~ -1.0 to -1.5 predictedby dark-matter-only simulations shallower, and induce dm halos with a centralmass distribution similar to that observed in nearby dwarf galaxies.

1011.4148	things about mond	we present the analysis of 12 high-resolution galactic rotation curves fromthe hi nearby galaxy survey (things) in the context of modified newtoniandynamics (mond). these rotation curves were selected to be the most reliablefor mass modelling, and they are the highest quality rotation curves currentlyavailable for a sample of galaxies spanning a wide range of luminosities. wefit the rotation curves with the "simple" and "standard" interpolatingfunctions of mond, and we find that the "simple" function yields betterresults. we also redetermine the value of a0, and find a median value veryclose to the one determined in previous studies, a0 = (1.22 +- 0.33) x 10^{-8}cm/s^2. leaving the distance as a free parameter within the uncertainty of itsbest independently determined value leads to excellent quality fits for 75% ofthe sample. among the three exceptions, two are also known to give relativelypoor fits also in newtonian dynamics plus dark matter. the remaining case (ngc3198), presents some tension between the observations and the mond fit, whichmight however be explained by the presence of non-circular motions, by a smalldistance, or by a value of a0 at the lower end of our best-fit interval, 0.9 x10^{-8} cm/s^2. the best-fit stellar m/l ratios are generally in remarkableagreement with the predictions of stellar population synthesis models. we alsoshow that the narrow range of gravitational accelerations found to be generatedby dark matter in galaxies is consistent with the narrow range of additionalgravity predicted by mond.

1104.3291	quantified hi morphology i: multi-wavelengths analysis of the things  galaxies	galaxy evolution is driven to a large extent by interactions and mergers withother galaxies and the gas in galaxies is extremely sensitive to theinteractions. one method to measure such interactions uses the quantifiedmorphology of galaxy images. well-established parameters are concentration,asymmetry, smoothness, gini, and m20 of a galaxy image. thus far, theapplication of this technique has mostly been restricted to restframeultra-violet and optical images. however, with the new radio observatoriesbeing commissioned (meerkat, askap, evla, wsrt/apertif, and ultimately ska), anew window on the neutral atomic hydrogen gas (hi) morphology of a largenumbers of galaxies will open up. the quantified morphology of gas disks ofspirals can be an alternative indicator of the level and frequency ofinteraction. the hi in galaxies is typically spatially more extended and moresensitive to low-mass or weak interactions. in this paper, we explore sixmorphological parameters calculated over the extent of the stellar (optical)disk and the extent of the gas disk for a range of wavelengths spanning uv,optical, near- and far-infrared and 21 cm (hi) of 28 galaxies from the hinearby galaxy survey (things). though the things sample is small and containsonly a single ongoing interaction, it spans both non-interacting andpost-interacting galaxies with a wealth of multi-wavelength data. we find thatthe choice of area for the computation of the morphological parameters is lessof an issue than the wavelength at which they are measured. the signal ofinteraction is as good in the hi as in any of the other wavelengths in whichmorphology has been used to trace the interaction rate to date, mostlystar-formation dominated ones (near- and far-ultraviolet). the asymmetry andm20 parameters are the ones which show the most promise as tracers ofinteraction in 21 cm line observations.

1104.3292	quantified hi morphology ii : lopsidedness and interaction in whisp  column density maps	lopsidedness of the gaseous disk of spiral galaxies is a common phenomenon indisk morphology, profile and kinematics. simultaneously, the asymmetry of agalaxy's stellar disk, in combination with other morphological parameters, hasseen extensive use as an indication of recent merger or interaction in galaxysamples. quantified morphology of stellar spiral disks is one avenue todetermine the merger rate over much of the age of the universe. in this paper,we measure the quantitative morphology parameters for the hi column densitymaps from the westerbork observations of neutral hydrogen in irregular andspiral galaxies (whisp). these are concentration, asymmetry, smoothness, gini,m20, and one addition of our own, the gini parameter of the second order moment(gm). our aim is to determine if lopsided or interacting disks can beidentified with these parameters. our sample of 141 hi maps have all previousclassifications on their lopsidedness and interaction. we find that theasymmetry, m20, and our new gm parameter correlate only weakly with theprevious morphological lopsidedness quantification. these three parameters maybe used to compute a probability that an hi disk is morphologically lopsidedbut not unequivocally to determine it. however, we do find that that thequestion whether or not an hi disk is interacting can be settled well usingmorphological parameters. parameter cuts from the literature do not translatefrom ultraviolet to hi directly but new selection criteria using combinationsof asymmetry and m20 or concentration and m20, work very well. we suggest thatfuture all-sky hi surveys may use these parameters of the column density mapsto determine the merger fraction and hence rate in the local universe with ahigh degree of accuracy.

1104.3297	quantified hi morphology iv: the merger fraction and rate in whisp	the morphology of the atomic hydrogen (hi) disk of a spiral galaxy is thefirst component to be disturbed by a gravitational interaction such as a mergerbetween two galaxies. we use a simple parametrisation of the morphology of hicolumn density maps of westerbork hi spiral project (whisp) to select thosegalaxies that are likely undergoing a significant interaction. merging galaxiesoccupy a particular part of parameter space defined by asymmetry (a), therelative contribution of the 20% brightest pixels to the second order moment ofthe column density map (m20) and the distribution of the second order momentover all the pixels (gm). based on their hi morphology, we find that 13% of thewhisp galaxies are in an interaction (concentration-m20) and only 7% based onclose companions in the data-cube. this apparent discrepancy can be attributedto the difference in visibility time scales: mergers are identifiable as closepairs for 0.5 gyr but ~1 gyr by their disturbed hi morphology. expressed asvolume merger rates, the two estimates agree very well: 7 and 6.8 x 10^-3mergers gyr^-1 mpc^-3 for paired and morphologically disturbed hi disksrespectively. the consistency of our merger fractions to those published forbigger surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey, shows that hi morphologycan be a very viable way to identify mergers in a large hi survey. therelatively high value for the volume merger rate may be a bias in the selectionor whisp volume. the expected boon in high-resolution hi data by the plannedmeerkat, askap and wsrt/apertif radio observatories will reveal the importanceof mergers in the local universe and, with the advent of ska, over cosmictimes.

1104.3305	quantified hi morphology v: hi disks in the virgo cluster	we explore the quantified morphology of atomic hydrogen (hi) disks in thevirgo cluster. these galaxies display a wealth of phenomena in their himorphology, e.g., tails, truncation and warps. these morphological disturbancesare related to the ram-pressure stripping and tidal interaction that galaxiesundergo in this dense cluster environment. to quantify the morphologicaltransformation of the hi disks, we compute the morphological parameters of cas,gini, and m20 and our own gm for 51 galaxies in 48 hi column density maps fromthe viva project. some morphological phenomena can be identified in this spaceof relatively low resolution hi data. truncation of the hi disk can be cleanlyidentified via the concentration parameter (c&lt;1) and concentration can also beused to identify hi deficient disks (1&lt;c&lt;5). tidal interaction is typicallyidentified using combinations of these morphological parameters, applied to(optical) images of galaxies. we find that some selection criteria (gini-m20,asymmetry, and a modified concentration-m20) are still applicable for thecoarse (~15" fwhm) viva hi data. the phenomena of tidal tails can be reasonablywell identified using the gini-m20 criterion (60% of galaxies with tailsidentified but with as many contaminants). ram-pressure does move hi disks intoand out of most of our interaction criteria: the ram-pressure sequenceidentified by vollmer et al. (2009) tracks into and out of some of thesecriteria (asymmetry based and the gini-m20 selections, but not theconcentration-m20 or the gm based ones). therefore, future searches forinteraction using hi morphologies should take ram-pressure into account as amechanism to disturb hi disks enough to make them appear as gravitationallyinteracting. one mechanism would be to remove all the hi deficient (c&lt;5) disksfrom the sample, as these have undergone more than one hi removal mechanism.

1104.3306	quantified hi morphology iii: merger visibility times from hi in galaxy  simulations	major mergers of disk galaxies are thought to be a substantial driver ingalaxy evolution. to trace the fraction and the rate galaxies are in mergersover cosmic times, several observational techniques, including morphologicalselection criteria, have been developed over the last decade. we apply thismorphological selection of mergers to 21 cm radio emission line (hi) columndensity images of spiral galaxies in nearby surveys. in this paper, weinvestigate how long a 1:1 merger is visible in hi from n-body simulations. weevaluate the merger visibility times for selection criteria based on fourparameters: concentration, asymmetry, m20, and the gini parameter of secondorder moment of the flux distribution (gm). of three selection criteria used inthe literature, one based on concentration and m20 works well for the hiperspective with a merger time scale of 0.4 gyr. of the three selectioncriteria defined in our previous paper, the gm performs well and cleanlyselects mergers for 0.69 gyr. the other two criteria (a-m20 and c-m20), selectisolated disks as well, but perform best for face-on, gas-rich disks (t(merger)~ 1 gyr). the different visibility scales can be combined with the selectedfractions of galaxies in any large hi survey to obtain merger rates in thenearby universe. all-sky surveys such as wallaby with askap and the medium deepsurvey with the apetif instrument on westerbork are set to revolutionize ourperspective on neutral hydrogen and will provide an accurate measure of themerger fraction and rate of the present epoch.

1109.4247	improved modeling of the mass distribution of disk galaxies by the  einasto halo model	(abridged) the analysis of the rotation curves (rcs) of spiral galaxiesprovides an efficient diagnostic for studying the properties of dark matterhalos and their relations with the baryonic material. we have modeled the rcsof galaxies from the hi nearby galaxy survey (things) with the einasto halomodel, which has emerged as the best-fitting model of the halos arising indissipationless cosmological n-body simulations. we find that the rcs aresignificantly better fit with the einasto halo than with either apseudo-isothermal sphere (iso) or navarro-frenk-white (nfw) halo models. in ourbest-fit models, the radius of density slope -2 and the density at this radiusare highly correlated. the einasto index, which controls the overall shape ofthe density profile, is near unity on average for intermediate and low masshalos. this is not in agreement with the predictions from lcdm simulations. theindices of the most massive halos are in rough agreement with those ofcosmological simulations and appear correlated with the halo virial mass. wefind that a typical einasto density profile declines more strongly in itsoutermost parts than any of the iso or nfw models whereas it is relativelyshallow in its innermost regions. the core nature of those regions of halosthus extends the cusp-core controversy found for the nfw model with low surfacedensity galaxies to the einasto halo with more massive galaxies like those ofthings. we thus find that the einasto halo model provides, so far, the bestmatch to the observed rcs, and can therefore be considered as a new standardmodel for dark matter halos.

1201.3149	on the origin of the supergiant hi shell and putative companion in ngc  6822	we present new hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys imaging ofsix positions spanning 5.8 kpc of the hi major axis of the local group dirr ngc6822, including both the putative companion galaxy and the large hi hole. theresulting deep color magnitude diagrams show that ngc 6822 has formed &gt;50% ofits stars in the last ~5 gyr. the star formation histories of all six positionsare similar over the most recent 500 myr, including low-level star formationthroughout this interval and a weak increase in star formation rate during themost recent 50 myr. stellar feedback can create the giant hi hole, assumingthat the lifetime of the structure is longer than 500 myr; such long-livedstructures have now been observed in multiple systems and may be the norm ingalaxies with solid-body rotation. the old stellar populations (red giants andred clump stars) of the putative companion are consistent with those of theextended halo of ngc 6822; this argues against the interpretation of thisstructure as a bona fide interacting companion galaxy and against its beinglinked to the formation of the hi hole via an interaction. since there is noevidence in the stellar population of a companion galaxy, the most likelyexplanation of the extended hi structure in ngc 6822 is a warped disk inclinedto the line of sight.

1201.3185	a qumond galactic n-body code i: poisson solver and rotation curve  fitting	here we present a new particle-mesh galactic n-body code that uses the fullmultigrid algorithm for solving the modified poisson equation of the quasilinear formulation of modified newtonian dynamics (qumond). a novel approachfor handling the boundary conditions using a refinement strategy is implementedand the accuracy of the code is compared with analytical solutions of kuzmindisks. we then employ the code to compute the predicted rotation curves for asample of five spiral galaxies from the things sample. we generated staticn-body realisations of the galaxies according to their stellar and gaseoussurface densities and allowed their distances, mass-to-light ratios (m/l) andboth the stellar and gas scale-heights to vary in order to estimate the bestfit parameters. we found that ngc 3621, ngc 3521 and ddo 154 are well fit bymond using expected values of the distance and m/l. ngc 2403 required amoderately larger $m/l$ than expected and ngc 2903 required a substantiallylarger value. the surprising result was that the scale-height of the dominantbaryonic component was well constrained by the rotation curves: the gasscale-height for ddo 154 and the stellar scale-height for the others. in fact,if the suggested stellar scale-height (one-fifth the stellar scale-length) wasused in the case of ngc 3621 and ngc 3521 it would not be possible to produce agood fit to the inner rotation curve. for each of the four stellar dominatedgalaxies, we calculated the vertical velocity dispersions which we found to be,on the whole, quite typical compared with observed stellar vertical velocitydispersions of face on spirals. we conclude that modelling the gasscale-heights of the gas rich dwarf spiral galaxies will be vital in order tomake precise conclusions about mond.

1202.2873	estimating the star formation rate at 1 kpc scales in nearby galaxies	using combinations of h\alpha, ultraviolet (uv), and infrared (ir) emission,we estimate the star formation rate (sfr) surface density, \sigma_sfr, at 1 kpcresolution for 30 disk galaxies that are targets of the iram heracles cosurvey. we present a new physically-motivated ir spectral energydistribution-based approach to account for possible contributions to 24\mumemission not associated with recent star formation. considering a variety of"reference" sfrs from the literature, we revisit the calibration of the 24\mumterm in hybrid (uv+ir or h\alpha+ir) tracers. we show that the overallcalibration of this term remains uncertain at the factor of two level becauseof the lack of wide-field, robust reference sfr estimates. within thisuncertainty, published calibrations represent a reasonable starting point for 1kpc-wide areas of star-forming disk galaxies but we re-derive and refine thecalibration of the ir term in these tracers to match our resolution andapproach to 24\mum emission. we compare a large suite of \sigma_sfr estimatesand find that above \sigma_sfr \sim 10^-3 m_\odot yr^-1 kpc^-2 the systematicdifferences among tracers are less than a factor of two across two orders ofmagnitude dynamic range. we caution that methodology and data both becomeserious issues below this level. we note from simple model considerations thatfocusing on a part of a galaxy dominated by a single stellar population theintrinsic uncertainty in h\alpha and fuv-based sfrs are \sim 0.3 and \sim 0.5dex.

1203.4231	low co luminosities in dwarf galaxies	[abridged] we present maps of co 2-1 emission covering the entirestar-forming disks of 16 nearby dwarf galaxies observed by the iram heraclessurvey. the data have 13 arcsec angular resolution, ~250 pc at our averagedistance of 4 mpc, and sample the galaxies by 10-1000 resolution elements. weapply stacking techniques to perform the first sensitive search for co emissionin dwarfs outside the local group ranging from single lines-of-sight, stackedover ir-bright regions of embedded star formation, and stacked over the entiregalaxy. we detect 5 dwarfs in co with total luminosities of l_co = 3-28 1e6kkmspc2. the other 11 dwarfs remain undetected in co even in the stacked dataand have l_co &lt; 0.4-8 1e6 kkmspc2. we combine our sample of dwarfs with a largeliterature sample of spirals to study scaling relations of l_co with m_b andmetallicity. we find that dwarfs with metallicities of z ~ 1/2-1/10 z_sun havel_co about 1e2-1e4x smaller than spirals and that their l_co per unit l_b is10-100x smaller. a comparison with tracers of star formation (fuv and 24micron) shows that l_co per unit sfr is 10-100x smaller in dwarfs. one possibleinterpretation is that dwarfs form stars much more efficiently, however weargue that the low l_co/sfr ratio is due to significant changes of the co-to-h2conversion factor, alpha_co, in low metallicity environments. assuming aconstant h2 depletion time of 1.8 gyr (as found for nearby spirals) impliesalpha_co values for dwarfs with z ~ 1/2-1/10 z_sun that are more than 10xhigher than those found in solar metallicity spirals. this significant increaseof alpha_co at low metallicity is consistent with previous studies, inparticular those which model dust emission to constrain h2 masses. even thoughit is difficult to parameterize the metallicity dependence of alpha_co, ourresults suggest that co is increasingly difficult to detect at lowermetallicities.

1207.5041	the shapes of the hi velocity profiles of the things galaxies	we analyze the shapes of the hi velocity profiles of the hi nearby galaxysurvey (things) to study the phase structure of the neutral interstellar medium(ism) and its relation to global galaxy properties. we use a method analogousto the stacking method sometimes used in high redshift hi observations toconstruct high signal-to-noise (s/n) profiles. we call these high s/n profilessuper profiles. we analyze and discuss possible systematics that may change theobserved shapes of the super profiles. after quantifying these effects andselecting a sub-sample of unaffected galaxies, we find that the super profilesare best described by a narrow and a broad gaussian component, which areevidence of the presence of the cold neutral medium (cnm) and the warm neutralmedium (wnm). the velocity dispersion of the narrow component range from ~3.4to ~8.6 km/s with an average of 6.5+/-1.5 km/s, whereas that of the broadcomponent range from ~10.1 to ~24.3 km/s with an average of 16.8+/-4.3 km/s. wefind that the super profile parameters correlate with star formation indicatorssuch as metallicity, fuv-nuv colors and h_alpha luminosities. the flux ratiobetween the narrow and broad components tends to be highest for highmetallicity, high star formation rate (sfr) galaxies. we show that the narrowcomponent identified in the super profiles is associated with the presence ofstar formation, and possibly with molecular hydrogen.

1209.0306	the opacity of spiral galaxy disks ix; dust and gas surface densities	our aim is to explore the relation between gas, atomic and molecular, anddust in spiral galaxies. gas surface densities are from atomic hydrogen and coline emission maps. to estimate the dust content, we use the disk opacity asinferred from the number of distant galaxies identified in twelve hst/wfpc2fields of ten nearby spiral galaxies. the observed number of distant galaxiesis calibrated for source confusion and crowding with artificial galaxy countsand here we verify our results with sub-mm surface brightnesses from archivalherschel-spire data. we find that the opacity of the spiral disk does notcorrelate well with the surface density of atomic (hi) or molecular hydrogen(h2) alone implying that dust is not only associated with the molecular cloudsbut also the diffuse atomic disk in these galaxies. our result is a typicaldust-to-gas ratio of 0.04, with some evidence that this ratio declines withgalactocentric radius, consistent with recent herschel results. we discuss thepossible causes of this high dust-to-gas ratio; an over-estimate of the dustsurface-density, an under-estimate of the molecular hydrogen density from comaps or a combination of both. we note that while our value of the meandust-to-gas ratio is high, it is consistent with the metallicity at themeasured radii if one assumes the pilyugin &amp; thuan calibration of gasmetallicity.

0712.0860	mass models for low surface brightness galaxies with high resolution  optical velocity fields	we present high-resolution optical velocity fields from densepak integralfield spectroscopy, along with derived rotation curves, for a sample of lowsurface brightness galaxies. in the limit of no baryons, we fit the nfw andpseudoisothermal halo models to the data and find the rotation curve shapes andhalo central densities to be better described by the isothermal halo. for thosegalaxies with photometry, we present halo fits for three assumptions of thestellar mass-to-light ratio. we find that the velocity contribution from thebaryons is significant enough in the maximum disk case that maximum disk andthe nfw halo are mutually exclusive. we find a substantial cusp mass excess atthe centers of the galaxies, with at least two times more mass expected in thecuspy cdm halo than is allowed by the data. we also find that to reconcile thedata with lcdm, ~20 km/s noncircular motions are needed and/or the powerspectrum has a lower amplitude on the scales we probe.

1212.1460	disk stability and neutral hydrogen as a tracer of dark matter	we derive the projected surface mass distribution sigma_m for sphericallysymmetric mass distributions having an arbitrary rotation curve. for a galaxywith a flat rotation curve and an ism disk having a constant toomre stabilityparameter, q, the ism surface mass density sigma_g as well as sigma_m both falloff as 1/r. we use published data on a sample of 20 well studied galaxies toshow that ism disks do maintain a constant q over radii usually encompassingmore than 50% of the hi mass. the power law slope in sigma_g covers a range ofexponents and is well correlated with the slope in the epicyclic frequency.this implies that the ism disk is responding to the potential, and hence thatsecular evolution is important for setting the structure of ism disks. we showthat the gas to total mass ratio should be anti-correlated with the maximumrotational velocity, and that the sample falls on the expected relationship. avery steep fall off in sigma_g is required at the outermost radii to keep themass and angular momentum content finite for typical rotation curve shapes, andis observed. the observation that hi traces dark matter over a significantrange of radii in galaxies is thus due to the disks stabilising themselves in anormal dark matter dominated potential. this explanation is consistent with thecold dark matter paradigm.

1301.2328	molecular gas and star formation in nearby disk galaxies	we compare molecular gas traced by 12co(2-1) maps from the heracles survey,with tracers of the recent star formation rate (sfr) across 30 nearby diskgalaxies. we demonstrate a first-order linear correspondence between sig_moland sig_sfr but also find important second-order systematic variations in theapparent molecular gas depletion time, t_dep^mol = sig_mol / sig_sfr. at our 1kpc common resolution, co correlates closely with many tracers of the recentsfr. weighting each line of sight equally and using a fixed, milky wayalpha_co, our data yield a molecular gas depletion time,t_dep^mol=sig_mol/sig_sfr ~ 2.2 gyr with 0.3 dex scatter, in good agreementwith literature data. we apply a forward-modeling approach to constrain thepower-law index, n, that relates the sfr surface density and the molecular gassurface density and find n=1+/-0.15 for our full data set with some variationfrom galaxy to galaxy. however, we caution that a power law treatmentoversimplifies the topic given that we observe correlations between t_dep^moland other local and global quantities. the strongest of these are a decreasedt_dep^mol in low-mass, low-metallicity galaxies and a correlation of thekpc-scale t_dep^mol with dust-to-gas ratio, d/g. these correlations can beexplained by a co-to-h2 conversion factor that depends on d/g in thetheoretically expected way. this is not a unique interpretation, but externalevidence of conversion factor variations makes it a conservative one. afterapplying a d/g-dependent alpha_co, some weak correlations between t_dep^mol andlocal conditions persist. in particular, we observe lower t_dep^mol andenhanced co excitation associated with some nuclear gas concentrations. theseappear to reflect real enhancements in the sfr/h2 and t_dep appears multivaluedat fixed sig_mol, supporting the the idea of "disk" and "starburst" modesdriven by environmental factors.

1306.5312	halogas observations of ngc 5023 and ugc 2082: modeling of  non-cylindrically symmetric gas distributions in edge-on galaxies	in recent years it has become clear that the vertical structure of diskgalaxies is a key ingredient for understanding galaxy evolution. in particular,the presence and structure of extra-planar gas has been a focus of research.the hydrogen accretion in local galaxies (halogas) survey aims to provide acensus on the rate of cold neutral gas accretion in nearby galaxies as well asa statistically significant set of galaxies that can be investigated for theirextra-planar gas properties.  in order to better understand the the vertical structure of the neutralhydrogen in the two edge-on halogas galaxies ngc 5023 and ugc 2082 we constructdetailed tilted ring models. the addition of distortions resembling arcs orspiral arms significantly improves the fit of the models to these galaxies. inthe case of ugc 2082 no vertical gradient in rotational velocity is required ineither symmetric models nor non-symmetric models to match the observations. thebest fitting model features two arcs of large vertical extent that may be dueto accretion. in the case of ngc 5023 a vertical gradient is required insymmetric models (dv/dz =$-14.9\pm3.8$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$) and itsmagnitude is significantly lowered when non-symmetric models are considered(dv/dz =$-9.4\pm3.8$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$). additionally it is shown that theunderlying disk of ngc 5023 can be made symmetric, in all parameters except thewarp, in non-symmetric models. in comparison to the "classical" modeling thesemodels fit the data significantly better with a limited addition of freeparameters.

1306.6148	is gbt 1355+5439 a dark galaxy?	we present hi imaging of gbt 1355+5439 performed with the westerborksynthesis radio telescope. this is a dark hi object recently discovered closeto the nearby galaxy m101. we find gbt 1355+5439 to be an hi cloud 5x3 arcminin size. the total hi image and the kinematics show that the cloud consists ofcondensations that have small (~10 km/s) motions with respect to each other.the column densities of the hi are low; the observed peak value is 7.1x10^{19}cm^{-2}. the velocity field shows a mild velocity gradient over the body of gbt1355+5439, possibly due to rotation, but it may also indicate large-scaleradial motions. although our data are limited in sensitivity, at all positionsthe hi velocity dispersion is higher than 5 km/s and no narrow, cold, hicomponent is seen. because its distance is not known, we considered variouspossibilities for the nature of gbt 1355+5439. both the scenarios that it is atidal remnant near m101 and that it is a dark dwarf companion of m101 meetdifficulties. neither do the data fit the properties of known compacthigh-velocity clouds in the galactic halo exactly, but we cannot entirelyexclude this option and deeper observations are required. we also consideredthe possibility that gbt 1355+5439 is a gas-rich dark minihalo in the outerregions of the local group. interestingly, it would then have similarproperties as the clouds of a proposed local group population recently found inthe alfalfa survey. in this case, the hi mass of gbt 1355+5439 would be about afew times 10^5 msol, its size about 1 kpc, and the dynamical mass m_dyn &gt;5x10^7 msol. however, if gbt 1355+5439 is a dark local group object, theinternal kinematics of the hi appears to be different from that ofgas-dominated, almost dark galaxies of similar size.

1309.6324	a high-dispersion molecular gas component in nearby galaxies	we present a comprehensive study of the velocity dispersion of the atomic(hi) and molecular (h2) gas components in the disks (r &lt; r25) of a sample of 12nearby spiral galaxies with moderate inclinations. our analysis is based onsensitive high resolution data from the things (atomic gas) and heracles(molecular gas) surveys. to obtain reliable measurements of the velocitydispersion, we stack regions several kilo-parsecs in size, after accounting forintrinsic velocity shifts due to galactic rotation and large-scale motions. westack using various parameters: the galacto-centric distance, star formationrate surface density, hi surface density, h2 surface density, and total gassurface density. we fit single gaussian components to the stacked spectra andmeasure median velocity dispersions for hi of 11.9 +/- 3.1 km/s and for h2 of12.0 +/- 3.9 km/s. the co velocity dispersions are thus, surprisingly, verysimilar to the corresponding ones of hi, with an average ratio ofsigma(hi)/sigma(co) = 1.0 +/- 0.2 irrespective of the stacking parameter. themeasured co velocity dispersions are significantly higher (factor 2) than thetraditional picture of a cold molecular gas disk associated with starformation. the high dispersion implies an additional thick molecular gas disk(possibly as thick as the hi disk). our finding is in agreement with recentsensitive measurements in individual edge-on and face-on galaxies and pointstowards the general existence of a thick disk of molecular gas, in addition tothe well-known thin disk in nearby spiral galaxies.

1401.2622	the formation of spiral galaxies: adiabatic compression with young's  algorithm and the relation of dark matter haloes to their primordial  antecedents	we utilize young's algorithm to model the adiabatic compression of the darkmatter haloes of galaxies in the things survey to determine the relationshipbetween the halo fit to the rotation curve and the corresponding primordialhalo prior to compression. young's algorithm conserves radial action andangular momentum, resulting in less halo compression than more widely utilizedapproximations. we find that estimates of the parameters of the nfw haloes fitto the current dark matter distribution systematically overestimate theconcentration and underestimate the virial velocity of the correspondingprimordial halo. it is the latter that is predicted by dark matter simulations;so accounting for compression is a necessary step for evaluating whethermassive galaxies are consistent with dark matter-only simulations. the inferredprimordial haloes broadly follow the c-v200 relation expected in a lcdmcosmogony, but often scatter to lower concentrations. we are unable to obtainfits at all for those galaxies whose current dark matter haloes are poorlydescribed by the nfw form. we thus find a mixed bag: some galaxies arereasonably well described by adiabatic compression within a primordial nfwhalo, while others require additional mechanisms that reduce the density ofdark matter below the primordial initial condition.

1401.8158	the impact of the gas distribution on the determination of dynamical  masses of galaxies using unresolved observations	the dynamical mass (m_dyn) is a key property of any galaxy, yet adetermination of m_dyn is not straight-forward if spatially resolvedmeasurements are not available. this situation occurs in single-dish hiobservations of the local universe, but also frequently in high-redshiftobservations. m_dyn-measurements in high-redshift galaxies are commonlyobtained through observations of the co line, the most abundant tracer of themolecular medium. even though the co linewidth can in most cases be determinedwith reasonable accuracy, a measurement of the size of the emitting region istypically challenging given current facilities. we show how the integratedspectra (`global profiles') of a variety of galaxy models depend on the spatialdistribution of the tracer gas as well as its velocity dispersion. wedemonstrate that the choice of tracer emission line significantly affects theshape of the global profiles. in particular, in the case of high (~50 kms-1)velocity dispersions, compact tracers (such as co) result in gaussian-like(non-double-horned) profiles, as is indeed frequently seen in high-redshiftobservations. we determine at which radii the rotation curve reaches therotation velocity corresponding to the velocity width, and find that for eachtracer this happens at a well-defined radius: hi velocity widths typicallyoriginate at ~5 optical scale lengths, while co velocity widths trace therotation velocity at ~2 scale lengths. we additionally explore otherdistributions to take into account that co distributions at high redshiftlikely differ from those at low redshift. our models, while not trying toreproduce individual galaxies, define characteristic radii that can be used inconjunction with the measured velocity widths in order to define dynamicalmasses consistent with the assumed gas distribution.

1407.3648	a low hi column density filament in ngc 2403: signature of interaction  or accretion	observed hi accretion around nearby galaxies can only account for a fractionof the gas supply needed to sustain the currently observed star formationrates. it is possible that additional accretion happens in the form of lowcolumn density cold flows, as predicted by numerical simulations of galaxyformation. to contrain the presence and properties of such flows, we presentdeep hi observations obtained with the nrao green bank telescope of an areameasuring 4 by 4 degrees around ngc 2403. these observations, with a 5 sigmadetection limit of 2.4 x 10^18 cm^-2 over a 20 km/s linewidth, reveal thepresence of a low-column density, extended cloud outside the main hi disk,about 17' (~16 kpc or ~2r25) to the nw of the center of the galaxy. the totalhi mass of the cloud is 6.3 x 10^6 msun, or 0.15 percent of the total hi massof ngc 2403. the cloud is associated with an 8-kpc anomalous-velocity hifilament in the inner disk, previously observed in deep vla observations byfraternali et al.

1407.5479	local group dsph radio survey with atca (i): observations and background  sources	dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxies are key objects in near-field cosmology,especially in connection to the study of galaxy formation and evolution atsmall scales. in addition, dsphs are optimal targets to investigate the natureof dark matter. however, while we begin to have deep optical photometricobservations of the stellar population in these objects, little is known so farabout their diffuse emission at any observing frequency, and hence on thermaland non-thermal plasma possibly residing within dsphs. in this paper, wepresent deep radio observations of six local dsphs performed with the australiatelescope compact array at 16 cm wavelength. we mosaiced a region of radius ofabout one degree around three "classical" dsphs, carina, fornax, and sculptor,and of about half of degree around three "ultra-faint" dsphs, bootesii, segue2,and hercules. the rms noise level is below 0.05 mjy for all the maps. therestoring beams fwhm ranged from 4.2 x 2.5 arcseconds to 30.0 x 2.1 arcsecondsin the most elongated case. a catalogue including the 1392 sources detected inthe six dsph fields is reported. the main properties of the background sourcesare discussed, with positions and fluxes of brightest objects compared with thefirst, nvss, and sumss observations of the same fields. the observed populationof radio emitters in these fields is dominated by synchrotron sources. wecompute the associated source number counts at 2 ghz down to fluxes of 0.25mjy, which prove to be in agreement with agn count models.

1407.5482	local group dsph radio survey with atca (ii): non-thermal diffuse  emission	our closest neighbours, the local group dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxies, areextremely quiescent and dim objects, where thermal and non-thermal diffuseemissions lack, so far, of detection. in order to possibly study the dsphinterstellar medium, deep observations are required. they could revealnon-thermal emissions associated with the very-low level of star formation, orto particle dark matter annihilating or decaying in the dsph halo. in thiswork, we employ radio observations of six dsphs, conducted with the australiatelescope compact array in the frequency band 1.1-3.1 ghz, to test the presenceof a diffuse component over typical scales of few arcmin and at an rmssensitivity below 0.05 mjy/beam. we observed the dsph fields with both acompact array and long baselines. short spacings led to a synthesized beam ofabout 1 arcmin and were used for the extended emission search. thehigh-resolution data mapped background sources, which in turn were subtractedin the short-baseline maps, to reduce their confusion limit. we found nosignificant detection of a diffuse radio continuum component. after a detaileddiscussion on the modelling of the cosmic-ray (cr) electron distribution and onthe dsph magnetic properties, we present bounds on several physical quantitiesrelated to the dsphs, such that the total radio flux, the angular shape of theradio emissivity, the equipartition magnetic field, and the injection andequilibrium distributions of cr electrons. finally, we discuss the connectionto far-infrared and x-ray observations.

1501.00408	magnetic field tomography in nearby galaxies with the square kilometre  array	magnetic fields play an important role in shaping the structure and evolutionof the interstellar medium (ism) of galaxies, but the details of thisrelationship remain unclear. with ska1, the 3d structure of galactic magneticfields and its connection to star formation will be revealed. a highlysensitive probe of the internal structure of the magnetoionized ism is thepartial depolarization of synchrotron radiation from inside the volume.different configurations of magnetic field and ionized gas within theresolution element of the telescope lead to frequency-dependent changes in theobserved degree of polarization. the results of spectro-polarimetricobservations are tied to physical structure in the ism through comparison withdetailed modeling, supplemented with the use of new analysis techniques thatare being actively developed and studied within the community such as rotationmeasure synthesis. the ska will enable this field to come into its own andbegin the study of the detailed structure of the magnetized ism in a sample ofnearby galaxies, thanks to its extraordinary wideband capabilities coupled withthe combination of excellent surface brightness sensitivity and angularresolution.

1506.00703	variations in the star formation efficiency of the dense molecular gas  across the disks of star-forming galaxies	we present a new survey of hcn(1-0) emission, a tracer of dense moleculargas, focused on the little-explored regime of normal star-forming galaxy disks.combining hcn, co, and infrared (ir) emission, we investigate the role of densegas in star formation (sf), finding systematic variations in both the apparentdense gas fraction and the apparent sf efficiency (sfe) of dense gas. thelatter may be unexpected, given the popularity of gas density threshold modelsto explain sf scaling relations. we used the iram 30-m telescope to observehcn(1-0) across 29 nearby disk galaxies whose co(2-1) emission has previouslybeen mapped by the heracles survey. because our observations span a range ofgalactocentric radii, we are able to investigate the properties of the densegas as a function of local conditions. we focus on how the ir/co, hcn/co, andir/hcn ratios (observational cognates of the sfe, dense gas fraction, and densegas sfe) depend on the stellar surface density and the molecular/atomic ratio.the hcn/co ratio correlates tightly with these two parameters across a range of2.1 dex and increases in the high surface density parts of galaxies.simultaneously, the ir/hcn ratio decreases systematically with these sameparameters and is ~6-8 times lower near galaxy centers than in the outerregions. for fixed line-mass conversion factors, these results are incompatiblewith a simple model in which sf depends only on the gas mass above some densitythreshold. only a specific set of environment-dependent conversion factors canrender our observations compatible with such a model. whole cloud models, suchas the theory of turbulence regulated sf, do a better job of matching our data.we explore one such model in which variations in the mach number and in themean density would respectively drive the trends within galaxy disks and thedifferences between disk and merging galaxies (abridged).

1506.04156	the radial variation of hi velocity dispersions in dwarfs and spirals	gas velocity dispersions provide important diagnostics of the forcescounteracting gravity to prevent collapse of the gas. we use the 21 cm line ofneutral atomic hydrogen (hi) to study hi velocity dispersion and hi phases as afunction of galaxy morphology in 22 galaxies from the hi nearby galaxy survey(things). we stack individual hi velocity profiles and decompose them intobroad and narrow gaussian components. we study the hi velocity dispersion andthe hi surface density, as a function of radius. for spirals, the velocitydispersions of the narrow and broad components decline with radius and theirradial profiles are well described by an exponential function. for dwarfs,however, the profiles are much flatter. the single gaussian dispersion profilesare, in general, flatter than those of the narrow and broad components. in mostcases, the dispersion profiles in the outer disks do not drop as fast as thestar formation profiles, derived in the literature. this indicates theimportance of other energy sources in driving hi velocity dispersion in theouter disks. the radial surface density profiles of spirals and dwarfs aresimilar. the surface density profiles of the narrow component decline moresteeply than those of the broad component, but not as steep as what was foundpreviously for the molecular component. as a consequence, the surface densityratio between the narrow and broad components, an estimate of the mass ratiobetween cold hi and warm hi, tends to decrease with radius. on average, thisratio is lower in dwarfs than in spirals. this lack of a narrow, cold hicomponent in dwarfs may explain their low star formation activity.

1512.01367	the impact of molecular gas on mass models of nearby galaxies	we present co velocity fields and rotation curves for a sample of nearbygalaxies, based on data from the heracles survey. we combine our data withliterature things, sings and kingfish results to provide a comprehensive sampleof mass models of disk galaxies inclusive of molecular gas. we compare thekinematics of the molecular (co from heracles) and atomic (${\rm h{\scriptstylei}}$ from things) gas distributions to determine the extent to which co may beused to probe the dynamics in the inner part of galaxies. in general, we findgood agreement between the co and ${\rm h{\scriptstyle i}}$ kinematics withsmall differences in the inner part of some galaxies. we add the contributionof the molecular gas to the mass models in our galaxies by using two differentconversion factors $\mathrm{\alpha_{co}}$ to convert co luminosity to moleculargas mass surface density - the constant milky way value and the radiallyvarying profiles determined in recent work based on things, heracles andkingfish data. we study the relative effect that the addition of the moleculargas has upon the halo rotation curves for navarro-frenk-white (nfw) and theobservationally motivated pseudo-isothermal halos. the contribution of themolecular gas varies for galaxies in our sample - for those galaxies wherethere is a substantial molecular gas content, using different values of$\mathrm{\alpha_{co}}$ can result in significant differences to the relativecontribution of the molecular gas and, hence, the shape of the dark matter halorotation curves in the central regions of galaxies.

astro-ph;0003224	the evolution of the stellar populations in low surface brightness  galaxies	we investigate the star formation history and chemical evolution of lowsurface brightness (lsb) disk galaxies by modelling their observedspectro-photometric and chemical properties using a galactic chemical andphotometric evolution model incorporating a detailed metallicity depen dent setof stellar input data. for a large fraction of the lsb galaxies in our sample,observed properties are best explained by models incorporating an exponentiallydecreasing global star formation rate (sfr) ending at a present-day gasfraction (m_{gas}/(m_{gas}+m_{stars}) = 0.5 for a galaxy age of 14 gyr. forsome galaxies small amplitude star formation bursts are required to explain thecontribution of the young (5-50 myr old) stellar population to the galaxyintegrated luminosity. this suggests that star formation has proceeded in astochastic manner.  the presence of an old stellar population in many late-type lsb galaxiessuggests that lsb galaxies roughly follow the same evolutionary history as hsbgalaxies, except at a much lower rate. in particular, our results imply thatlsb galaxies do not form late, nor have a delayed onset of star formation, butsimply evolve slowly.

astro-ph;0005267	an extragalactic hi cloud with no optical counterpart?	we report the discovery, from the hi parkes all-sky survey (hipass), of anisolated cloud of neutral hydrogen which we believe to be extragalactic. the himass of the cloud (hipass j1712-64) is very low, 1.7 x 10^7 msun, using anestimated distance of ~3.2 mpc. most significantly, we have found no opticalcompanion to this object to very faint limits (mu(b)~ 27 mag arcsec^-2). hipassj1712-64 appears to be a binary system similar to, but much less massive than,hi 1225+01 (the virgo hi cloud) and has a size of at least 15 kpc. the meanvelocity dispersion, measured with the australia telescope compact array(atca), is only 4 km/s for the main component and because of the weak ornon-existent star-formation, possibly reflects the thermal linewidth (t&lt;2000 k)rather than bulk motion or turbulence. the peak column density for hipassj1712-64, from the combined parkes and atca data, is only 3.5 x 10^19 cm^-2,which is estimated to be a factor of two below the critical threshold for starformation. apart from its significantly higher velocity, the properties ofhipass j1712-64 are similar to the recently recognised class of compact highvelocity clouds. we therefore consider the evidence for a local group orgalactic origin, although a more plausible alternative is that hipass j1712-64was ejected from the interacting magellanic cloud/galaxy system atperigalacticon ~ 2 x 10^8 yr ago.

astro-ph;0005473	evidence for tidal interaction and a supergiant hi shell in the local  group dwarf galaxy ngc 6822	we present a wide-field, high spatial and velocity resolution map of theentire extended hi distribution of the local group dwarf galaxy ngc 6822. theobservations were obtained with the australia telescope compact array inmosaicing mode. the interstellar medium of ngc 6822 is shaped by the presenceof numerous h{\sc i} holes and shells, including a supergiant shell, and theeffects of tidal interaction, in the form of a tidal arm and an infalling orinteracting hi complex. the hi shell is situated outside the optical galaxy andoccupies roughly a quarter of the area of the main hi disk. it measures 2.0times 1.4 kpc, making it one of the largest supergiant hi shells ever found.the giant hole shows no signs of expansion and no obvious creation mechanism isevident from our data. if star formation was the cause, an energy equivalent of\~100 supernovae (10^53 erg) is needed to create the hole. we derive an upperlimit for the age of order 100 myr. the presence of a possible tidal armindicates that ngc 6822 may recently have undergone some interaction. an hicomplex located in the north-west of the galaxy may be the interaction partner.we argue that it is likely that these features were created about 100 myr agoin an event that also enhanced the star formation rate

astro-ph;0103102	mass density profiles of lsb galaxies	we derive the mass density profiles of dark matter halos that are implied byhigh spatial resolution rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies. wefind that at small radii, the mass density distribution is dominated by anearly constant density core with a core radius of a few kpc. for rho(r) ~ r^a,the distribution of inner slopes a is strongly peaked around a = -0.2. this issignificantly shallower than the cuspy a &lt; -1 halos found in cdm simulations.while the observed distribution of alpha does have a tail towards such extremevalues, the derived value of alpha is found to depend on the spatial resolutionof the rotation curves: a ~ -1 is found only for the least well resolvedgalaxies. even for these galaxies, our data are also consistent with constantdensity cores (a = 0) of modest (~ 1 kpc) core radius, which can give theillusion of steep cusps when insufficiently resolved. consequently, there is noclear evidence for a cuspy halo in any of the low surface brightness galaxiesobserved.

astro-ph;0103405	a morphological-type dependence in the mu_0-log(h) plane of spiral  galaxy disks	we present observational evidence for a galaxy `type' dependence to thelocation of a spiral galaxy's disk parameters in the mu_0-log(h) (central disksurface-brightness - disk scale-length) plane. with a sample of ~40 low surfacebrightness galaxies (both bulge- and disk-dominated) and ~80 high surfacebrightness galaxies, the early-type disk galaxies (&lt;=sc) tend to define abright envelope in the mu_0-log(h) plane, while the late-type (&gt;=scd) spiralgalaxies have, in general, smaller and fainter disks. below the definingsurface brightness threshold for a low surface brightness galaxy (i.e. morethan 1 mag fainter than the 21.65 b-mag arcsec^(-2) freeman value), theearly-type spiral galaxies have scale-lengths greater than 8-9 kpc, while thelate-type spiral galaxies have smaller scale-lengths. all galaxies have beenmodelled with a seeing-convolved sersic r^(1/n) bulge and exponential diskmodel. we show that the trend of decreasing bulge shape parameter (n) withincreasing hubble type and decreasing bulge-to-disk luminosity ratio, which hasbeen observed amongst the high surface brightness galaxies, extends to the lowsurface brightness galaxies, revealing a continuous range of structuralparameters.

astro-ph;0109087	gas rich galaxies and the hi mass function	we have developed an automated cross-correlation technique to detect 21cmemission in sample spectra obtained from the hi parkes all sky survey.  the initial sample selection was the nearest spectra to 2435 low surfacebrightness galaxies in the catalogue of morshidi-esslinger et al. (1999).  the galaxies were originally selected to have properties similar to fornaxcluster de galaxies. as de galaxies are generally gas poor it is not surprisingthat there were only 26 secure detections. all of the detected galaxies havevery high values of $(m_{h}/l_{b})_{\odot}$. thus the hi selection of faintoptical sources leads to the detection of predominately gas rich galaxies. thegas rich galaxies tend to reside on the outskirts of the large scale structuredelineated by optically selected galaxies, but they do appear to be associatedwith it. these objects appear to have similar relative dark matter content tooptically selected galaxies. the hi column densities are lower than the'critical density' necessary for sustainable star formation and they appear,relatively, rather isolated from companion galaxies. these two factors mayexplain their high relative gas content. we have considered the hi massfunction by looking at the distribution of velocities of hi detections inrandom spectra on the sky.  the inferred hi mass function is steep though confirmation of this resultsawaits a detailed study of the noise characteristics of the hi survey.

astro-ph;0206447	the 1000 brightest hipass galaxies: newly cataloged galaxies	the hi parkes all-sky survey (hipass) is a blind 21-cm survey forextragalactic neutral hydrogen, covering the whole southern sky. the hipassbright galaxy catalog (bgc; koribalski et al. 2002) is a subset of hipass andcontains the 1000 hi-brightest (peak flux density) galaxies. here we presentthe 138 hipass bgc galaxies, which had no redshift measured prior to the parkesmultibeam hi surveys. of the 138 galaxies, 87 are newly cataloged. newlycataloged is defined as no optical (or infrared) counterpart in the nasa/ipacextragalactic database. using the digitized sky survey we identify opticalcounterparts for almost half of the newly cataloged galaxies, which aretypically of irregular or magellanic morphological type. several hi sourcesappear to be associated with compact groups or pairs of galaxies rather than anindividual galaxy. the majority (57) of the newly cataloged galaxies lie withinten degrees of the galactic plane and are missing from optical surveys due toconfusion with stars or dust extinction. this sample also includes newlycataloged galaxies first discovered in the hi shallow survey of thezone-of-avoidance (henning et al. 2000). the other 30 newly cataloged galaxiesescaped detection due to their low surface brightness or optical compactness.only one of these, hipass j0546-68, has no obvious optical counterpart as it isobscured by the large magellanic cloud. we find that the newly catalogedgalaxies with |b| &gt; 10 are generally lower in hi mass and narrower in velocitywidth compared with the total hipass bgc. in contrast, newly cataloged galaxiesbehind the milky way are found to be statistically similar to the entire hipassbgc. in addition to these galaxies, the hipass bgc contains four previouslyunknown hi clouds.

astro-ph;0212102	simulating observations of dark matter dominated galaxies: towards the  optimal halo profile	low surface brightness (lsb) galaxies are dominated by dark matter, and theirrotation curves thus reflect their dark matter distribution. recenthigh-resolution rotation curves suggest that their dark matter mass-densitydistributions are dominated by a constant-density core. this seems inconsistentwith the predictions of cold dark matter (cdm) models which produce halos withcompact density cusps and steep mass-density profiles. however, theobservationally determined mass profiles may be affected by non-circularmotions, asymmetries and offsets between optical and dynamical centres, all ofwhich tend to lower the observed slopes. here we determine the impact of eachof these effects on a variety of halo models, and compare the results withobserved mass-density profiles. our simulations suggest that no singlesystematic effect can reconcile the data with the cuspy cdm halos. the data arebest described by a model with a soft core with an inner power-law mass-densityslope alpha = -0.2 +/- 0.2. however, no single universal halo profile providesa completely adequate description of the data.

astro-ph;0304501	radiative transfer in disc galaxies -- iii. the observed kinematics of  dusty disc galaxies	we present skirt (stellar kinematics including radiative transfer), a newmonte carlo radiative transfer code that allows the calculation of the observedstellar kinematics of a dusty galaxy. the code incorporates the effects of bothabsorption and scattering by interstellar dust grains, and calculates thedoppler shift of the emerging radiation exactly by taking into account thevelocities of the emitting stars and the individual scattering dust grains. thecode supports arbitrary distributions of dust through a cellular approach,whereby the integration through the dust is optimized by means of a novelefficient trilinear interpolation technique.  we apply our modelling technique to calculate the observed kinematics ofrealistic models for dusty disc galaxies. we find that the effects of dust onthe mean projected velocity and projected velocity dispersion are severe foredge-on galaxies. for galaxies which deviate more than a few degrees fromexactly edge-on, the effects are already strongly reduced. as a consequence,dust attenuation cannot serve as a possible way to reconcile the discrepancybetween the observed shallow slopes of the inner rotation curves of lsbgalaxies and the predictions of cdm cosmological models. for face-on galaxies,the velocity dispersion increases with increasing dust mass due to scattering,but the effects are limited, even for extended dust distributions. finally, weshow that serious errors can be made when the individual velocities of the dustgrains are neglected in the calculations.

astro-ph;0406317	star formation in hi selected galaxies i: sample characteristics	a sample of 69 galaxies with radial velocities less than 2500 km/s wasselected from the hi parkes all sky survey (hipass) and imaged in broad band band r and narrow band h-alpha to deduce details about star formation in nearbydisk galaxies while avoiding surface brightness selection effects. the sampleis dominated by late-type, dwarf disks (mostly sc and sm galaxies) withexponential disk scale lengths of about 1 to 5 kpc. the hipass galaxies onaverage have lower star formation rates (sfrs) and are bluer and lower surfacebrightness than an optically selected sample. hii regions were detected in allbut one of the galaxies. many galaxies had as few as two to five hii regions.the galaxies' h-alpha equivalent widths, colors, and sfrs per unit hi mass arebest explained by young mean ages (about 3 to 5 gyr according to schmidt lawmodels) with star formation histories where the sfrs were higher in the past.comparison of the surface brightness coverage of the hipass galaxies with thatof an optically selected sample shows that such a sample may miss about 10% ofthe local galaxy number density and could possibly miss as much as 3 to 4% ofthe sfr density. the amount lower surface brightness galaxies contribute to thetotal luminosity density may be insignificant, but this conclusion is somewhatdependent on how the fluxes of these objects are determined.

astro-ph;0409628	the cosmological significance of low surface brightness galaxies found  in a deep blind neutral-hydrogen survey	we have placed limits on the cosmological significance of gas-rich lowsurface-brightness (lsb) galaxies as a proportion of the total population ofgas-rich galaxies by carrying out a very deep survey (hideep) for neutralhydrogen (hi) with the parkes multibeam system. such a survey avoids thesurface-brightness selection effects that limit the usefulness of opticalsurveys for finding lsb galaxies. to complement the hideep survey we havedigitally stacked eight 1-hour r-band tech pan films from the uk schmidttelescope covering 36 square degrees of the survey area to reach a very deepisophotal limit of 26.5 r mag/sq. arcsec. at this level, we find that all ofthe 129 hi sources within this area have optical counterparts and that 107 ofthem can be identified with individual galaxies. we have used the properties ofthe galaxies identified as the optical counterparts of the hi sources toestimate the significance of lsb galaxies (defined to be those at least 1.5magnitudes dimmer in effective surface-brightness than the peak in the observeddistribution seen in optical surveys). we calculate the contribution of lsbgalaxies to the total number, neutral hydrogen density, luminosity density,baryonic mass density, dynamical mass density and cross-sectional area ofgas-rich galaxies. we do not find any `crouching giant' lsb galaxies such asmalin 1, nor do we find a population of extremely low surface-brightnessgalaxies not previously found by optical surveys. such objects must either berare, gas-poor or outside the survey detection limits.

astro-ph;0506753	halo mass profiles and low surface brightness galaxies rotation curves	a recent study has claimed that the rotation curve shapes and mass densitiesof low surface brightness (lsb) galaxies are largely consistent with$\lambda$cdm predictions, in contrast to a large body of observational work. idemonstrate that the method used to derive this conclusion is incapable ofdistinguishing the characteristic steep cdm mass-density distribution from thecore-dominated mass-density distributions found observationally: evencore-dominated pseudo-isothermal haloes would be inferred to be consistent withcdm. this method can therefore make no definitive statements on the(dis)agreement between the data and cdm simulations. after introducing anadditional criterion that does take the slope of the mass-distribution intoaccount i find that only about a quarter of the lsb galaxies investigated arepossibly consistent with cdm. however, for most of these the fit parameters areso weakly constrained that this is not a strong conclusion. only 3 out of 52galaxies have tightly constrained solutions consistent with $\lambda$cdm. twoof these galaxies are likely dominated by stars, leaving only one possible darkmatter dominated, cdm-consistent candidate, forming a mere 2 per cent of thetotal sample. these conclusions are based on comparison of data and simulationsat identical radii and fits to the entire rotation curves. lsb galaxies thatare consistent with cdm simulations, if they exist, seem to be rare indeed.

astro-ph;0608249	the nature of infrared emission in the local group dwarf galaxy ngc 6822  as revealed by spitzer	we present spitzer imaging of the metal-deficient (z ~30% z_sun) local groupdwarf galaxy ngc 6822. on spatial scales of ~130 pc, we study the nature of ir,h alpha, hi, and radio continuum emission. nebular emission strength correlateswith ir surface brightness; however, roughly half of the ir emission isassociated with diffuse regions not luminous at h alpha (as found in previousstudies). the global ratio of dust to hi gas in the ism, while uncertain at thefactor of ~2 level, is ~25 times lower than the global values derived forspiral galaxies using similar modeling techniques; localized ratios of dust tohi gas are about a factor of five higher than the global value in ngc 6822.there are strong variations (factors of ~10) in the relative ratios of h alphaand ir flux throughout the central disk; the low dust content of ngc 6822 islikely responsible for the different h alpha/ir ratios compared to those foundin more metal-rich environments. the h alpha and ir emission is associated withhigh-column density (&gt; ~1e21 cm^-2) neutral gas. increases in ir surfacebrightness appear to be affected by both increased radiation field strength andincreased local gas density. individual regions and the galaxy as a whole fallwithin the observed scatter of recent high-resolution studies of the radio-farir correlation in nearby spiral galaxies; this is likely the result of depletedradio and far-ir emission strengths in the ism of this dwarf galaxy.

astro-ph;0701668	the hi content of star-forming galaxies at z = 0.24	we use observations from the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt) tomeasure the atomic hydrogen gas content of star-forming galaxies at z = 0.24(i.e. a look-backtime of ~3 gyr). the sample of galaxies studied were selectedfrom halpha-emitting field galaxies detected in a narrow-band imaging surveywith the subaru telescope. the anglo-australian telescope was used to obtainprecise optical redshifts for these galaxies. we then coadded the hi 21 cmemission signal for all the galaxies within the gmrt spectral line data cube.  from the coadded signal of 121 galaxies, we measure an average atomichydrogen gas mass of (2.26 +- 0.90)*10^9 solar masses. we translate this hisignal into a cosmic density of neutral gas at z = 0.24 of omega_gas = (0.91 +-0.42)*10^-3. this is the current highest redshift at which omega_gas has beenconstrained from 21 cm emission and our value is consistent with that estimatedfrom damped lyman-alpha systems around this redshift. we also find that thecorrelations between the halpha luminosity and the radio continuum luminosityand between the star formation rate and the hi gas content in star-forminggalaxies at z = 0.24 are consistent with the correlations found at z = 0. thesetwo results suggest that the star formation mechanisms in field galaxies ~3 gyrago were not substantially different from the present, even though the starformation rate is 3 times higher.

astro-ph;0702378	dust and atomic gas in dwarf irregular galaxies of the m81 group: the  sings and things view	[abridged] we present observations of the dust and atomic gas phase in sevendwarf irregular galaxies of the m81 group from the sings and things surveys.the spitzer observations provide a first glimpse of the nature of thenon-atomic ism in these metal-poor (z~0.1 z_sun), quiescent (sfr~0.001-0.1m_sun/yr) dwarf galaxies. dust emission is detected in five out of the seventargets. most detected dust emission is restricted to hi column densities&gt;1x10^21 cm^-2. spitzer spectroscopy of two regions in the brightest galaxies(ic 2574 and holmberg ii) show distinctly different spectral shapes. thespectrum of ic 2574 shows aromatic features that are less luminous (relative tothe fir luminosity) compared to an average sings spiral galaxy by a factor of\~7 . the aromatic features in holmberg~ii (which has only a slightly lowergas-phase metallicity) are fainter than in ic 2574 by an order of magnitude.this result emphazises that the strength of the aromatic features is not asimple linear function of metallicity. we estimate dust masses of ~10^4-10^6m_sun for the m81 dwarf galaxies, resulting in an average dust--to--gas ratio(m_dust/m_hi) of ~3x10^-4 (1.5x10^-3 if only the hi that is associated withdust emission is considered); this is an order of magnitude lower than thetypical value derived for the sings spirals. the dwarf galaxies areunderluminous per unit star formation rate at 70um as compared to the moremassive galaxies in sings by a factor of ~2. however, the average 70um/160umratio in the sample dwarf galaxies is higher than what is found in the othergalaxies of the sings sample. this can be explained by a combination of a lowerdust content in conjunction with a higher dust temperature in the dwarfs.

astro-ph;9605069	hi observations of low surface brightness galaxies: probing low-density  galaxies	we present very large array ({\sc vla}) and westerbork synthesis radiotelescope ({\sc wsrt}) 21-cm h{\sc i} observations of 19 late-type low surfacebrightness (lsb) galaxies. our main findings are that these galaxies, as wellas having low surface brightnesses, have low h{\sc i} surface densities, abouta factor of $\sim 3$ lower than in normal late-type galaxies. we show that lsbgalaxies in some respects resemble the outer parts of late-type normalgalaxies, but may be less evolved. lsb galaxies are more gas-rich than theirhigh surface brightness counterparts. the rotation curves of lsb galaxies risemore slowly than those of hsb galaxies of the same luminosity, with amplitudesbetween 50 and 120~km~s$^{-1}$, and are often still increasing at the outermostmeasured point. the shape of the rotation curves suggests that lsb galaxieshave low matter surface densities. we use the average total mass surfacedensity of a galaxy as a measure for the evolutionary state, and show that lsbgalaxies are among the least compact, least evolved galaxies. we show that both$m_{\rm hi}/l_b$ and $m_{\rm dyn}/l_b$ depend strongly on central surfacebrightness, consistent with the surface brightness--mass-to-light ratiorelation required by the tully-fisher relation. lsb galaxies are thereforeslowly evolving galaxies, and may well be low surface density systems in allrespects.

astro-ph;9704274	the dark and baryonic matter content of low surface brightness disk  galaxies	we present mass models of a sample of 19 low surface brightness (lsb)galaxies and compare the properties of their constituent mass components withthose of a sample of high surface brightness (hsb) galaxies.we find that lsbgalaxies are dark matter dominated. their halo parameters are only slightlyaffected by assumptions on stellar mass-to-light ratios. comparing lsb and hsbgalaxies we find that mass models derived using the maximum disk hypothesisresult in the disks of lsb galaxies having systematically higher stellarmass-to-light ratios than hsb galaxies of similar rotation velocity. this isinconsistent with all other available evidence on the evolution of lsbgalaxies. we argue therefore that the maximum disk hypothesis does not providea representative description of the lsb galaxies and their evolution. massmodels with stellar mass-to-light ratios determined by the colors and stellarvelocity dispersions of galactic disks imply that lsb galaxies have dark matterhalos that are more extended and less dense than those of hsb galaxies. surfacebrightness is thus related to the halo properties. lsb galaxies are slowlyevolving, low density and dark matter dominated galaxies.

astro-ph;9810096	star formation and the interstellar medium in low surface brightness  galaxies. iii. why they are blue, thin and poor in molecular gas	we present n-body simulations of low surface brightness (lsb) galaxies andtheir interstellar medium to investigate the cause for their low star formationrates (sfr).due to their massive halos, stellar disks of lsb galaxies are verystable and thin. lack of dust makes the projected edge-on surface brightness oflsb galaxies comparable to the projected edge-on surface brightness ofdust-rich high surface brightness (hsb) galaxies of similar size.  we show that the low surface densities found in lsb galaxies are bythemselves not enough to explain the slow evolution of lsb galaxies. a lowmetal content of the gas is essential. as a consequence the gas coolsinefficiently, resulting in an almost negligible cold gas fraction. we showthat lsb galaxies must have molecular gas fractions of less than 5 percent.  our best model has a sfr which is on average low but fluctuates strongly.this causes the large spread in colors of lsb galaxies. from a distribution ofbirthrate parameters we conclude that the presently-known and modeled gas-richblue lsb galaxies constitute the majority of the total population of gas-richlsb disk galaxies. we deduce the existence of an additional red, quiescent andgas-rich population which constitutes less than 20 percent of the totalpopulation. this does not rule out the existence of a large number of gas-poorlsb galaxies. these must however have had an evolutionary history dramaticallydifferent from that of the gas-rich galaxies.

0810.2119	high-resolution dark matter density profiles of things dwarf galaxies:  correcting for non-circular motions	we present a new method to remove the impact of random and small-scalenon-circular motions from hi velocity fields in galaxies in order to betterconstrain the dark matter properties for these objects. this method extractsthe circularly rotating velocity components from the hi data cube and condensesthem into a so-called bulk velocity field. we derive high-resolution rotationcurves of ic 2574 and ngc 2366 based on bulk velocity fields derived from thehi nearby galaxy survey (things) obtained at the vla. the bulk velocity fieldrotation curves are significantly less affected by non-circular motions andconstrain the dark matter distribution in our galaxies, allowing us to addressthe discrepancy between the inferred and predicted dark matter distribution ingalaxies (the "cusp/core" problem). spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings) 3.6 micron data as well as ancillary optical information, are used toseparate the baryons from the total matter content. using stellar populationsynthesis models, assuming various sets of metallicity and star formationhistories, we compute stellar mass-to-light ratios for the 3.6 and 4.5 micronbands. using our predicted value for the 3.6 micron stellar mass-to-lightratio, we find that the observed dark matter distributions of ic 2574 and ngc2366 are inconsistent with the cuspy dark matter halo predicted by lcdm models,even after corrections for non-circular motions. this result also holds forother assumptions about the stellar mass-to-light ratio. the distribution ofdark matter within our sample galaxies is best described by models with akpc-sized constant-density core.

0810.2304	are the kinematics of dlas in agreement with their arising in the gas  disks of galaxies?	we demonstrate in this paper that the velocity widths of the neutral gas indamped ly alpha (dla) systems are inconsistent with these systems originatingin gas disks of galaxies similar to those seen in the local universe. weexamine the gas kinematics of local galaxies using the high quality hi 21-cmdata from the hi nearby galaxies survey (things) and make a comparison with thevelocity profiles measured in the low-ionization metal lines observed in dlasat high redshifts. the median velocity width of z=0 hi gas above the dla columndensity limit of n=2x10^20 cm-2 is approximately 30 km/s, whereas the typicalvalue in dlas is a factor of two higher. we argue that the gas kinematics athigher redshifts are increasingly influenced by gas that is not participatingin ordered rotation in cold disks, but is more likely associated with tidal gasrelated to galaxy interactions or processes such as superwinds and outflows. ananalysis of the hi in the local interacting star-burst galaxy m82 shows thatthe velocity widths in this galaxy are indeed similar to what is seen in dlas.

0810.2391	geometrically derived timescales for star formation in spiral galaxies	we estimate a characteristic timescale for star formation in the spiral armsof disk galaxies, going from atomic hydrogen (hi) to dust-enshrouded massivestars. drawing on high-resolution hi data from the hi nearby galaxy survey and24$\mu$m images from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey we measure theaverage angular offset between the hi and 24$\mu$m emissivity peaks as afunction of radius, for a sample of 14 nearby disk galaxies. we model theseoffsets assuming an instantaneous kinematic pattern speed, $\omega_p$, and atimescale, t(hi--&gt;24$\mu$m), for the characteristic time span between the dense\hi phase and the formation of massive stars that heat the surrounding dust.fitting for $\omega_p$ and t(hi--&gt;24$\mu$m), we find that the radial dependenceof the observed angular offset (of the \hi and 24$\mu$m emission) is consistentwith this simple prescription; the resulting corotation radii of the spiralpatterns are typically $r_{cor}\simeq 2.7 r_{s}$, consistent with independentestimates. the resulting values of t(hi--&gt;24$\mu$m) for the sample are in therange 1--4 myr. we have explored the possible impact of non-circular gasmotions on the estimate of t(hi--&gt;24$\mu$m) and have found it to besubstantially less than a factor of 2. this implies that a short timescale forthe most intense phase of the ensuing star formation in spiral arms, andimplies a considerable fraction of molecular clouds exist only for a few myrbefore forming stars. however, our analysis does not preclude that somemolecular clouds persist considerably longer. if much of the star formation inspiral arms occurs within this short interval t(hi--&gt;24$\mu$m), then starformation must be inefficient, in order to avoid the short-term depletion ofthe gas reservoir.

0810.2541	the star formation law in nearby galaxies on sub-kpc scales	(abridged) we present a comprehensive analysis of the relationship betweenstar formation rate surface density (sfr sd) and gas surface density (gas sd)at sub-kpc resolution in a sample of 18 nearby galaxies. we use high resolutionhi data from things, co data from heracles and bima song, 24 micron data fromthe spitzer space telescope, and uv data from galex. we target 7 spiralgalaxies and 11 late-type/dwarf galaxies and investigate how the star formationlaw differs between the h2-dominated centers of spiral galaxies, theirhi-dominated outskirts and the hi-rich late-type/dwarf galaxies.  we find that a schmidt-type power law with index n=1.0+-0.2 relates the sfrsd and the h2 sd across our sample of spiral galaxies, i.e., that h2 formsstars at a constant efficiency in spirals. the average molecular gas depletiontime is ~2*10^9 yrs. we interpret the linear relation and constant depletiontime as evidence that stars are forming in gmcs with approximately uniformproperties and that the h2 sd may be more a measure of the filling fraction ofgiant molecular clouds than changing conditions in the molecular gas.  the relationship between total gas sd and sfr sd varies dramatically amongand within spiral galaxies. most galaxies show little or no correlation betweenthe hi sd and the sfr sd. as a result, the star formation efficiency (sfe = sfrsd / gas sd) varies strongly across our sample and within individual galaxies.we show that in spirals the sfe is a clear function of radius, while the dwarfgalaxies in our sample display sfes similar to those found in the outer opticaldisks of the spirals. another general feature of our sample is a sharpsaturation of the hi sd at ~9 m_sol/pc^2 in both the spiral and dwarf galaxies.

0810.2825	multi-scale clean: a comparison of its performance against classical  clean in galaxies using things	a practical evaluation of the multi-scale clean algorithm is presented. thedata used in the comparisons are taken from the hi nearby galaxy survey(things). the implementation of multi-scale clean in the casa software packageis used, although comparisons are made against the very similarmulti-resolution clean algorithm implemented in aips. both are compared againstthe classical clean algorithm (as implemented in aips). the results of thiscomparison show that several of the well-known characteristics and issues ofusing classical clean are significantly lessened (or eliminated completely)when using the multi-scale clean algorithm. importantly, multi-scale cleanreduces significantly the effects of the clean `bowl' caused by missingshort-spacings, and the `pedestal' of low-level un-cleaned flux (which affectsflux scales and resolution). multi-scale clean can clean down to the noiselevel without the divergence suffered by classical clean. we discuss practicalapplications of the added contrast provided by multi-scale clean using twoselected astronomical examples: hi holes in the interstellar medium andanomalous gas structures outside the main galactic disk.
