0906.1186	delay-induced multiple stochastic resonances on scale-free neuronal  networks	we study the effects of periodic subthreshold pacemaker activity andtime-delayed coupling on stochastic resonance over scale-free neuronalnetworks. as the two extreme options, we introduce the pacemaker respectivelyto the neuron with the highest degree and to one of the neurons with the lowestdegree within the network, but we also consider the case when all neurons areexposed to the periodic forcing. in the absence of delay, we show that anintermediate intensity of noise is able to optimally assist the pacemaker inimposing its rhythm on the whole ensemble, irrespective to its placing, thusproviding evidences for stochastic resonance on the scale-free neuronalnetworks. interestingly thereby, if the forcing in form of a periodic pulsetrain is introduced to all neurons forming the network, the stochasticresonance decreases as compared to the case when only a single neuron is paced.moreover, we show that finite delays in coupling can significantly affect thestochastic resonance on scale-free neuronal networks. in particular,appropriately tuned delays can induce multiple stochastic resonancesindependently of the placing of the pacemaker, but they can also altogetherdestroy stochastic resonance. delay-induced multiple stochastic resonancesmanifest as well-expressed maxima of the correlation measure, appearing atevery multiple of the pacemaker period. we argue that fine-tuned delays andlocally active pacemakers are vital for assuring optimal conditions forstochastic resonance on complex neuronal networks.

0907.2233	impact of aging on the evolution of cooperation in the spatial  prisoner's dilemma game	aging is always present, tailoring our interactions with others andpostulating a finite lifespan during which we are able to exercise them. weconsider the prisoner's dilemma game on a square lattice, and examine howquenched age distributions and different aging protocols influence theevolution of cooperation when taking the life experience and knowledgeaccumulation into account as time passes. in agreement with previous studies,we find that a quenched assignment of age to players, introducing heterogeneityto the game, substantially promotes cooperative behavior. introduction of agingand subsequent death as a coevolutionary process may act detrimental oncooperation but enhances it efficiently if the offspring of individuals thathave successfully passed their strategy is considered newborn. we studyresulting age distributions of players, and show that the heterogeneity isvital yet insufficient for explaining the observed differences in cooperatorabundance on the spatial grid. the unexpected increment of cooperation levelscan be explained by a dynamical effect that has a highly selective impact onthe propagation of cooperator and defector states.

0907.4961	synchronization transitions on scale-free neuronal networks due to  finite information transmission delays	we investigate front propagation and synchronization transitions independence on the information transmission delay and coupling strength overscale-free neuronal networks with different average degrees and scalingexponents. as the underlying model of neuronal dynamics, we use the efficientrulkov map with additive noise. we show that increasing the coupling strengthenhances synchronization monotonously, whereas delay plays a more subtle role.in particular, we found that depending on the inherent oscillation frequency ofindividual neurons, regions of irregular and regular propagating excitatoryfronts appear intermittently as the delay increases. these delay-inducedsynchronization transitions manifest as well-expressed minima in the measurefor spatial synchrony, appearing at every multiple of the oscillationfrequency. larger coupling strengths or average degrees can broaden the regionof regular propagating fronts by a given information transmission delay andfurther improve synchronization. these results are robust against variations insystem size, intensity of additive noise and the scaling exponent of theunderlying scale-free topology. we argue that fine-tuned informationtransmission delays are vital for assuring optimally synchronized excitatoryfronts on complex neuronal networks, and indeed, they should be seen asimportant as the coupling strength or the overall density of interneuronalconnections. we finally discuss some biological implications of the presentedresults.

0908.0563	emergence of target waves in paced populations of cyclically competing  species	we investigate the emergence of target waves in a cyclic predator-prey modelincorporating a periodic current of the three competing species in a small areasituated at the center of the square lattice. the periodic current acts as apacemaker, trying to impose its rhythm on the overall spatiotemporal evolutionof the three species. we show that the pacemaker is able to nucleate targetwaves that eventually spread across the whole population, whereby three routesleading to this phenomenon can be distinguished depending on the mobility ofthe three species and the oscillation period of the localized current. first,target waves can emerge due to the synchronization between the periodic currentand oscillations of the density of the three species on the spatial grid. thesecond route is similar to the first, the difference being that thesynchronization sets in only intermittently. finally, the third route towardstarget waves is realized when the frequency of the pacemaker is much higherthan that characterizing the oscillations of the overall density of the threespecies. by considering mobility and the frequency of the current as variableparameters, we thus provide insights into the mechanisms of pattern formationresulting from the interplay between local and global dynamics in systemsgoverned by cyclically competing species.

0908.3763	topology independent impact of noise on cooperation in spatial public  goods games	we study the evolution of cooperation in public goods games on differentregular graphs as a function of the noise level underlying strategy adoptions.we focus on the effects that are brought about by different group sizes ofpublic goods games in which individuals participate, revealing that largergroups of players may induce qualitatively different behavior when approachingthe deterministic limit of strategy adoption. while by pairwise interactions anintermediate uncertainty by strategy adoptions may ensure optimal conditionsfor the survival of cooperators at a specific graph topology, larger groupswarrant this only in the vicinity of the deterministic limit independently fromthe underlying graph. these discrepancies are attributed to the indirectlinkage of otherwise not directly connected players, which is brought about byjoint memberships within the larger groups. thus, we show that increasing thegroup size may introduce an effective transition of the interaction topology,and that the latter shapes the noise dependence of the evolution of cooperationin case of pairwise interactions only.

0909.4019	emergence of multilevel selection in the prisoner's dilemma game on  coevolving random networks	we study the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game, wherebya coevolutionary rule is introduced that molds the random topology of theinteraction network in two ways. first, existing links are deleted whenever aplayer adopts a new strategy or its degree exceeds a threshold value, andsecond, new links are added randomly after a given number of game iterations.these coevolutionary processes correspond to the generic formation of new anddeletion of existing links that, especially in human societies, appearfrequently as a consequence of ongoing socialization, change of lifestyle ordeath. due to the counteraction of deletions and additions of links the initialheterogeneity of the interaction network is qualitatively preserved, and thuscannot be held responsible for the observed promotion of cooperation. indeed,the coevolutionary rule evokes the spontaneous emergence of a powerfulmultilevel selection mechanism, which despite of the sustained random topologyof the evolving network, maintains cooperation across the whole span ofdefection temptation values.

0910.0826	coevolutionary games - a mini review	prevalence of cooperation within groups of selfish individuals is puzzling inthat it contradicts with the basic premise of natural selection. favoringplayers with higher fitness, the latter is key for understanding the challengesfaced by cooperators when competing with defectors. evolutionary game theoryprovides a competent theoretical framework for addressing the subtleties ofcooperation in such situations, which are known as social dilemmas. recentadvances point towards the fact that the evolution of strategies alone may beinsufficient to fully exploit the benefits offered by cooperative behavior.indeed, while spatial structure and heterogeneity, for example, have beenrecognized as potent promoters of cooperation, coevolutionary rules can extendthe potentials of such entities further, and even more importantly, lead to theunderstanding of their emergence. the introduction of coevolutionary rules toevolutionary games implies, that besides the evolution of strategies, anotherproperty may simultaneously be subject to evolution as well. coevolutionaryrules may affect the interaction network, the reproduction capability ofplayers, their reputation, mobility or age. here we review recent works onevolutionary games incorporating coevolutionary rules, as well as give adidactic description of potential pitfalls and misconceptions associated withthe subject. in addition, we briefly outline directions for future researchthat we feel are promising, thereby particularly focusing on dynamical effectsof coevolutionary rules on the evolution of cooperation, which are still widelyopen to research and thus hold promise of exciting new discoveries.

0910.4150	phase diagrams for three-strategy evolutionary prisoner's dilemma games  on regular graphs	evolutionary prisoner's dilemma games are studied with players located onsquare lattice and random regular graphs defining four neighbors for each one.the players follow one of the three strategies: tit-for-tat, unconditionalcooperation, and defection. the simplified payoff matrix is characterized bytwo parameters: the temptation $b$ to choose defection, and the cost $c$ ofinspection reducing the income of tit-for-tat. the strategy imitation from oneof the neighbors is controlled by pairwise comparison at a fixed level ofnoise. using monte carlo simulations and the extended versions of pairapproximation we have evaluated the $b-c$ phase diagrams indicating a richplethora of phase transitions between stationary coexistence, absorbing andoscillatory states, including continuous and discontinuous phase transitions.by reasonable costs the tit-for-tat strategy prevents extinction of cooperatorsacross the whole span of $b$ values determining the prisoner's dilemma game,irrespective of the interaction graph structure. we also demonstrate that thesystem can exhibit a repetitive succession of oscillatory and stationary statesupon changing a single payoff value, which highlights the remarkablesensitivity of cyclical interactions on parameters that define the strength ofdominance.

1003.0473	the dynamics of laser droplet generation	we propose an experimental setup allowing for the characterization of laserdroplet generation in terms of the underlying dynamics, primarily showing thatthe latter is deterministically chaotic by means of nonlinear time seriesanalysis methods. in particular, we use a laser pulse to melt the end of aproperly fed vertically placed metal wire. due to the interplay of surfacetension, gravity force and light-metal interaction, undulating pendant dropletsare formed at the molten end, which eventually completely detach from the wireas a consequence of their increasing mass. we capture the dynamics of thisprocess by employing a high-speed infrared camera, thereby indirectly measuringthe temperature of the wire end and the pendant droplets. the time series issubsequently generated as the mean value over the pixel intensity of everyinfrared snapshot. finally, we employ methods of nonlinear time series analysisto reconstruct the phase space from the observed variable and test it againstdeterminism and stationarity. after establishing that the observed laserdroplet generation is a deterministic and dynamically stationary process, wecalculate the spectra of lyapunov exponents. we obtain a positive largestlyapunov exponent and a negative divergence, i.e., sum of all the exponents,thus indicating that the observed dynamics is deterministically chaotic with anattractor as solution in the phase space. in addition to characterizing thedynamics of laser droplet generation, we outline industrial applications of theprocess and point out the significance of our findings for future attempts atmathematical modeling.

1003.3165	evolutionary establishment of moral and double moral standards through  spatial interactions	situations where individuals have to contribute to joint efforts or sharescarce resources are ubiquitous. yet, without proper mechanisms to ensurecooperation, the evolutionary pressure to maximize individual success tends tocreate a tragedy of the commons (such as over-fishing or the destruction of ourenvironment). this contribution addresses a number of related puzzles of humanbehavior with an evolutionary game theoretical approach as it has beensuccessfully used to explain the behavior of other biological species manytimes, from bacteria to vertebrates. our agent-based model distinguishesindividuals applying four different behavioral strategies: non-cooperativeindividuals ("defectors"), cooperative individuals abstaining from punishmentefforts (called "cooperators" or "second-order free-riders"), cooperators whopunish non-cooperative behavior ("moralists"), and defectors, who punish otherdefectors despite being non-cooperative themselves ("immoralists"). byconsidering spatial interactions with neighboring individuals, our modelreveals several interesting effects: first, moralists can fully eliminatecooperators. this spreading of punishing behavior requires a segregation ofbehavioral strategies and solves the "second-order free-rider problem". second,the system behavior changes its character significantly even after very longtimes ("who laughs last laughs best effect"). third, the presence of a numberof defectors can largely accelerate the victory of moralists over non-punishingcooperators. forth, in order to succeed, moralists may profit from immoralistsin a way that appears like an "unholy collaboration". our findings suggest thatthe consideration of punishment strategies allows to understand theestablishment and spreading of "moral behavior" by means of game-theoreticalconcepts. this demonstrates that quantitative biological modeling approachesare powerful even in domains that have been addressed with non-mathematicalconcepts so far. the complex dynamics of certain social behaviors becomesunderstandable as result of an evolutionary competition between differentbehavioral strategies.

1004.4824	growth and structure of slovenia's scientific collaboration network	we study the evolution of slovenia's scientific collaboration network from1960 till present with a yearly resolution. for each year the network wasconstructed from publication records of slovene scientists, whereby two wereconnected if, up to the given year inclusive, they have coauthored at least onepaper together. starting with no more than 30 scientists with an average of 1.5collaborators in the year 1960, the network to date consists of 7380individuals that, on average, have 10.7 collaborators. we show that, in spiteof the broad myriad of research fields covered, the networks form "smallworlds" and that indeed the average path between any pair of scientists scaleslogarithmically with size after the largest component becomes large enough.moreover, we show that the network growth is governed by near-linerpreferential attachment, giving rise to a log-normal distribution ofcollaborators per author, and that the average starting year is roughlyinversely proportional to the number of collaborators eventually acquired.understandably, not all that became active early have till now gathered manycollaborators. we also give results for the clustering coefficient and thediameter of the network over time, and compare our conclusions with thosereported previously.

0708.1746	social diversity and promotion of cooperation in the spatial prisoner's  dilemma game	the diversity in wealth and social status is present not only among humans,but throughout the animal world. we account for this observation by generatingrandom variables that determ ine the social diversity of players engaging inthe prisoner's dilemma game. here the term social diversity is used to addressextrinsic factors that determine the mapping of game pay offs to individualfitness. these factors may increase or decrease the fitness of a playerdepending on its location on the spatial grid. we consider differentdistributions of extrin sic factors that determine the social diversity ofplayers, and find that the power-law distribution enables the best promotion ofcooperation. the facilitation of the cooperative str ategy relies mostly on theinhomogeneous social state of players, resulting in the formation ofcooperative clusters which are ruled by socially high-ranking players that areable to prevail against the defectors even when there is a large temptation todefect. to confirm this, we also study the impact of spatially correlatedsocial diversity and find that coopera tion deteriorates as the spatialcorrelation length increases. our results suggest that the distribution ofwealth and social status might have played a crucial role by the evolution ofcooperation amongst egoistic individuals.

1007.0431	punish, but not too hard: how costly punishment spreads in the spatial  public goods game	we study the evolution of cooperation in spatial public goods games where,besides the classical strategies of cooperation (c) and defection (d), weconsider punishing cooperators (pc) or punishing defectors (pd) as anadditional strategy. using a minimalist modeling approach, our goal is toseparately clarify and identify the consequences of the two punishingstrategies. since punishment is costly, punishing strategies loose theevolutionary competition in case of well-mixed interactions. when spatialinteractions are taken into account, however, the outcome can be strikinglydifferent, and cooperation may spread. the underlying mechanism depends on thecharacter of the punishment strategy. in case of cooperating punishers,increasing the fine results in a rising cooperation level. in contrast, in thepresence of the pd strategy, the phase diagram exhibits a reentrant transitionas the fine is increased. accordingly, the level of cooperation shows anon-monotonous dependence on the fine. remarkably, punishing strategies canspread in both cases, but based on largely different mechanisms, which dependon the cooperativeness (or not) of punishers.

1007.4113	aspiring to the fittest and promotion of cooperation in the prisoner's  dilemma game	strategy changes are an essential part of evolutionary games. here weintroduce a simple rule that, depending on the value of a single parameter $w$,influences the selection of players that are considered as potential sources ofthe new strategy. for positive $w$ players with high payoffs will be consideredmore likely, while for negative $w$ the opposite holds. setting $w$ equal tozero returns the frequently adopted random selection of the opponent. we findthat increasing the probability of adopting the strategy from the fittestplayer within reach, i.e. setting $w$ positive, promotes the evolution ofcooperation. the robustness of this observation is tested against differentlevels of uncertainty in the strategy adoption process and for differentinteraction network. since the evolution to widespread defection is tightlyassociated with cooperators having a lower fitness than defectors, the factthat positive values of $w$ facilitate cooperation is quite surprising. we showthat the results can be explained by means of a negative feedback effect thatincreases the vulnerability of defectors although initially increasing theirsurvivability. moreover, we demonstrate that the introduction of $w$effectively alters the interaction network and thus also the impact ofuncertainty by strategy adoptions on the evolution of cooperation.

1008.0604	experimental observation of a chaos-to-chaos transition in laser droplet  generation	we examine the dynamics of laser droplet generation in dependence on thedetachment pulse power. in the absence of the detachment pulse, undulatingpendant droplets are formed at the end of a properly fed metal wire due to theimpact of the primary laser pulse that induces melting. eventually, thesedroplets detach, i.e. overcome the surface tension, because of their increasingmass. we show that this spontaneous dripping is deterministically chaotic bymeans of a positive largest lyapunov exponent and a negative divergence. in thepresence of the detachment pulse, however, the generation of droplets isfastened depending on the pulse power. at high powers, the spontaneity ofdripping is completely overshadowed by the impact of the detachment pulse.still, amplitude chaos can be detected, which similarly as the spontaneousdripping, is characterized by a positive largest lyapunov exponent and anegative divergence, thus indicating that the observed dynamics isdeterministically chaotic with an attractor as solution in the phase space. inthe intermediate regime, i.e. for low and medium detachment pulse powers, thetwo chaotic states compete for supremacy, yielding an intermittentperiod-doubling to amplitude chaos transition, which we characterize by meansof recurrence plots and their properties. altogether, the transition fromspontaneous to triggered laser droplet generation is characterized by achaos-to-chaos transition with an intermediate dynamically nonstationary phasein-between. since metal droplets can be used in various industrialapplications, we hope that the accurate determination of the dynamicalproperties underlying their formation will facilitate their use and guidefuture attempts at mathematical modeling.

1011.5132	heterogeneous aspirations promote cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma  game	to be the fittest is central to proliferation in evolutionary games.individuals thus adopt the strategies of better performing players in the hopeof successful reproduction. in structured populations the array of those thatare eligible to act as strategy sources is bounded to the immediate neighborsof each individual. but which one of these strategy sources should potentiallybe copied? previous research dealt with this question either by selecting thefittest or by selecting one player uniformly at random. here we introduce aparameter $u$ that interpolates between these two extreme options. setting $u$equal to zero returns the random selection of the opponent, while positive $u$favor the fitter players. in addition, we divide the population into twogroups. players from group $a$ select their opponents as dictated by theparameter $u$, while players from group $b$ do so randomly irrespective of $u$.we denote the fraction of players contained in groups $a$ and $b$ by $v$ and$1-v$, respectively. the two parameters $u$ and $v$ allow us to analyze indetail how aspirations in the context of the prisoner's dilemma game influencethe evolution of cooperation. we find that for sufficiently positive values of$u$ there exist a robust intermediate $v \approx 0.5$ for which cooperationthrives best. the robustness of this observation is tested against differentlevels of uncertainty in the strategy adoption process $k$ and for differentinteraction networks. we also provide complete phase diagrams depicting thedependence of the impact of $u$ and $v$ for different values of $k$, andcontrast the validity of our conclusions by means of an alternative model whereindividual aspiration levels are subject to evolution as well. our studyindicates that heterogeneity in aspirations may be key for the sustainabilityof cooperation in structured populations.

1102.4570	coveting thy neighbors fitness as a means to resolve social dilemmas	in spatial evolutionary games the fitness of each individual is traditionallydetermined by the payoffs it obtains upon playing the game with its neighbors.since defection yields the highest individual benefits, the outlook forcooperators is gloomy. while network reciprocity promotes collaborativeefforts, chances of averting the impending social decline are slim if thetemptation to defect is strong. it is therefore of interest to identify viablemechanisms that provide additional support for the evolution of cooperation.inspired by the fact that the environment may be just as important asinheritance for individual development, we introduce a simple switch thatallows a player to either keep its original payoff or use the average payoff ofall its neighbors. depending on which payoff is higher, the influence of eitheroption can be tuned by means of a single parameter. we show that, in general,taking into account the environment promotes cooperation. yet coveting thefitness of one's neighbors too strongly is not optimal. in fact, cooperationthrives best only if the influence of payoffs obtained in the traditional wayis equal to that of the average payoff of the neighborhood. we present resultsfor the prisoner's dilemma and the snowdrift game, for different levels ofuncertainty governing the strategy adoption process, and for differentneighborhood sizes. our approach outlines a viable route to increased levels ofcooperative behavior in structured populations, but one that requires athoughtful implementation.

1108.1790	effects of competition on pattern formation in the rock-paper-scissors  game	we investigate the impact of cyclic competition on pattern formation in therock-paper-scissors game. by separately considering random and prepared initialconditions, we observe a critical influence of the competition rate $p$ on thestability of spiral waves and on the emergence of biodiversity. in particular,while increasing values of $p$ promote biodiversity, they may act detrimentalon spatial pattern formation. for random initial conditions, we observe a phasetransition from biodiversity to an absorbing phase, whereby the critical valueof mobility grows linearly with increasing values of $p$ on a log-log scale,but then saturates as $p$ becomes large. for prepared initial conditions, weobserve the formation of single-armed spirals, but only for values of $p$ thatare below a critical value. once above, the spirals break up and formdisordered spatial structures, mainly because of the percolation of vacantsites. thus, there exists a critical value of the competition rate $p_{c}$ forstable single-armed spirals in finite populations. importantly though, $p_{c}$increases with increasing system size, because noise reinforces thedisintegration of ordered patterns. in addition, we also find that $p_{c}$increases with the mobility. these phenomena are reproduced by a deterministicmodel that is based on nonlinear partial differential equations. our findingsindicate that competition is vital for the sustenance of biodiversity andemergence of pattern formation in ecosystems governed by cyclical interactions.

1112.3025	group-size effects on the evolution of cooperation in the spatial public  goods game	we study the evolution of cooperation in public goods games on the squarelattice, focusing on the effects that are brought about by different sizes ofgroups where individuals collect their payoffs and search for potentialstrategy donors. we find that increasing the group size does not necessarilylead to mean-field behavior, as is traditionally observed for games governed bypairwise interactions, but rather that public cooperation may be additionallypromoted by means of enhanced spatial reciprocity that sets in for very largegroups. our results highlight that the promotion of cooperation due to spatialinteractions is not rooted solely in having restricted connections amongstplayers, but also in individuals having the opportunity to collect payoffsseparately from their direct opponents. moreover, in large groups the presenceof a small number of defectors is bearable, which makes the mixed phase regionexpand with increasing group size. having a chance of exploiting distantplayers, however, offers defectors a new way to break the phalanx ofcooperators, and even to resurrect from small numbers to eventually completelyinvade the population.

1112.6417	resolution of the stochastic strategy spatial prisoner's dilemma by  means of particle swarm optimization	we study the evolution of cooperation among selfish individuals in thestochastic strategy spatial prisoner's dilemma game. we equip players with theparticle swarm optimization technique, and find that it may lead to highlycooperative states even if the temptations to defect are strong. the concept ofparticle swarm optimization was originally introduced within a simple model ofsocial dynamics that can describe the formation of a swarm, i.e., analogous toa swarm of bees searching for a food source. essentially, particle swarmoptimization foresees changes in the velocity profile of each player, such thatthe best locations are targeted and eventually occupied. in our case, eachplayer keeps track of the highest payoff attained within a local topologicalneighborhood and its individual highest payoff. thus, players make use of theirown memory that keeps score of the most profitable strategy in previousactions, as well as use of the knowledge gained by the swarm as a whole, tofind the best available strategy for themselves and the society. followingextensive simulations of this setup, we find a significant increase in thelevel of cooperation for a wide range of parameters, and also a full resolutionof the prisoner's dilemma. we also demonstrate extreme efficiency of theoptimization algorithm when dealing with environments that strongly favor theproliferation of defection, which in turn suggests that swarming could be animportant phenomenon by means of which cooperation can be sustained even underhighly unfavorable conditions. we thus present an alternative way ofunderstanding the evolution of cooperative behavior and its ubiquitous presencein nature, and we hope that this study will be inspirational for future effortsaimed in this direction.

1201.1900	evolution of public cooperation on interdependent networks: the impact  of biased utility functions	we study the evolution of public cooperation on two interdependent networksthat are connected by means of a utility function, which determines to whatextent payoffs in one network influence the success of players in the othernetwork. we find that the stronger the bias in the utility function, the higherthe level of public cooperation. yet the benefits of enhanced publiccooperation on the two networks are just as biased as the utility functionsthemselves. while cooperation may thrive on one network, the other may still beplagued by defectors. nevertheless, the aggregate level of cooperation on bothnetworks is higher than the one attainable on an isolated network. thispositive effect of biased utility functions is due to the suppressed feedbackof individual success, which leads to a spontaneous separation ofcharacteristic time scales of the evolutionary process on the twointerdependent networks. as a result, cooperation is promoted because theaggressive invasion of defectors is more sensitive to the slowing down than thebuild-up of collective efforts in sizable groups.

1201.5626	conditional strategies and the evolution of cooperation in spatial  public goods games	the fact that individuals will most likely behave differently in differentsituations begets the introduction of conditional strategies. inspired by this,we study the evolution of cooperation in the spatial public goods game, wherebesides unconditional cooperators and defectors, also different types ofconditional cooperators compete for space. conditional cooperators willcontribute to the public good only if other players within the group are likelyto cooperate as well, but will withhold their contribution otherwise. dependingon the number of other cooperators that are required to elicit cooperation of aconditional cooperator, the latter can be classified in as many types as thereare players within each group. we find that the most cautious cooperators, suchthat require all other players within a group to be conditional cooperators,are the undisputed victors of the evolutionary process, even at very lowsynergy factors. we show that the remarkable promotion of cooperation is dueprimarily to the spontaneous emergence of quarantining of defectors, whichbecome surrounded by conditional cooperators and are forced into isolatedconvex "bubbles" from where they are unable to exploit the public good. thisphenomenon can be observed only in structured populations, thus adding to therelevance of pattern formation for the successful evolution of cooperation.

1202.3539	multiple firing coherence resonances in excitatory and inhibitory  coupled neurons	the impact of inhibitory and excitatory synapses in delay-coupledhodgkin--huxley neurons that are driven by noise is studied. if both synaptictypes are used for coupling, appropriately tuned delays in the inhibitionfeedback induce multiple firing coherence resonances at sufficiently strongcoupling strengths, thus giving rise to tongues of coherency in thecorresponding delay-strength parameter plane. if only inhibitory synapses areused, however, appropriately tuned delays also give rise to multiresonantresponses, yet the successive delays warranting an optimal coherence ofexcitations obey different relations with regards to the inherent time scalesof neuronal dynamics. this leads to denser coherence resonance patterns in thedelay-strength parameter plane. the robustness of these findings to theintroduction of delay in the excitatory feedback, to noise, and to the numberof coupled neurons is determined. mechanisms underlying our observations arerevealed, and it is suggested that the regularity of spiking across neuronalnetworks can be optimized in an unexpectedly rich variety of ways, depending onthe type of coupling and the duration of delays.

1203.6900	self-organization of punishment in structured populations	cooperation is crucial for the remarkable evolutionary success of the humanspecies. not surprisingly, some individuals are willing to bare additionalcosts in order to punish defectors. current models assume that, once set, thefine and cost of punishment do not change over time. here we show that relaxingthis assumption by allowing players to adapt their sanctioning efforts independence on the success of cooperation can explain both, the spontaneousemergence of punishment, as well as its ability to deter defectors and thoseunwilling to punish them with globally negligible investments. by means ofphase diagrams and the analysis of emerging spatial patterns, we demonstratethat adaptive punishment promotes public cooperation either through theinvigoration of spatial reciprocity, the prevention of the emergence of cyclicdominance, or through the provision of competitive advantages to those thatsanction antisocial behavior. presented results indicate that the process ofself-organization significantly elevates the effectiveness of punishment, andthey reveal new mechanisms by means of which this fascinating and widespreadsocial behavior could have evolved.

1205.1499	different reactions to adverse neighborhoods in games of cooperation	in social dilemmas, cooperation among randomly interacting individuals isoften difficult to achieve. the situation changes if interactions take place ina network where the network structure jointly evolves with the behavioralstrategies of the interacting individuals. in particular, cooperation can bestabilized if individuals tend to cut interaction links when facing adverseneighborhoods. here we consider two different types of reaction to adverseneighborhoods, and all possible mixtures between these reactions. when facedwith a gloomy outlook, players can either choose to cut and rewire some oftheir links to other individuals, or they can migrate to another location andestablish new links in the new local neighborhood. we find that in generallocal rewiring is more favorable for the evolution of cooperation thanemigration from adverse neighborhoods. rewiring helps to maintain the diversityin the degree distribution of players and favors the spontaneous emergence ofcooperative clusters. both properties are known to favor the evolution ofcooperation on networks. interestingly, a mixture of migration and rewiring iseven more favorable for the evolution of cooperation than rewiring on its own.while most models only consider a single type of reaction to adverseneighborhoods, the coexistence of several such reactions may actually be anoptimal setting for the evolution of cooperation.

1206.7119	impact of generalized benefit functions on the evolution of cooperation  in spatial public goods games with continuous strategies	cooperation and defection may be considered as two extreme responses to asocial dilemma. yet the reality is much less clear-cut. between the twoextremes lies an interval of ambivalent choices, which may be capturedtheoretically by means of continuous strategies defining the extent of thecontributions of each individual player to the common pool. if strategies arechosen from the unit interval, where 0 corresponds to pure defection and 1corresponds to the maximal contribution, the question is what is thecharacteristic level of individual investments to the common pool that emergesif the evolution is guided by different benefit functions. here we consider thesteepness and the threshold as two parameters defining an array of generalizedbenefit functions, and we show that in a structured population there existintermediate values of both at which the collective contributions are maximal.however, as the cost-to-benefit ratio of cooperation increases thecharacteristic threshold decreases, while the corresponding steepnessincreases. our observations remain valid if more complex sigmoid functions areused, thus reenforcing the importance of carefully adjusted benefits for highlevels of public cooperation.

1208.3457	evolutionary advantages of adaptive rewarding	our wellbeing depends as much on our personal success, as it does on thesuccess of our society. the realization of this fact makes cooperation a verymuch needed trait. experiments have shown that rewards can elevate ourreadiness to cooperate, but since giving a reward inevitably entails paying acost for it, the emergence and stability of such behavior remain elusive. herewe show that allowing for the act of rewarding to self-organize in dependenceon the success of cooperation creates several evolutionary advantages thatinstill new ways through which collaborative efforts are promoted. ranging fromindirect territorial battle to the spontaneous emergence and destruction ofcoexistence, phase diagrams and the underlying spatial patterns revealfascinatingly reach social dynamics that explains why this costly behavior hasevolved and persevered. comparisons with adaptive punishment, however, uncoveran achilles heel of adaptive rewarding that is due to over-aggression, which inturn hinders optimal utilization of network reciprocity. this may explain why,despite of its success, rewarding is not as firmly weaved into our societalorganization as punishment.

1210.3354	averting group failures in collective-risk social dilemmas	free-riding on a joint venture bears the risk of losing personal endowment asthe group may fail to reach the collective target due to insufficientcontributions. a collective-risk social dilemma emerges, which we here study inthe realm of the spatial public goods game with group-performance-dependentrisk levels. instead of using an overall fixed value, we update the risk levelin each group based on the difference between the actual contributions and thedeclared target. a single parameter interpolates between a step-like riskfunction and virtual irrelevance of the group's performance in averting thefailure, thus bridging the two extremes constituting maximal and minimalfeedback. we show that stronger feedback between group performance and risklevel is in general more favorable for the successful evolution of publiccooperation, yet only if the collective target to be reached is moderate.paradoxically, if the goals are overambitious, intermediate feedback strengthsyield optimal conditions for cooperation. this can be explained by thepropagation of players that employ identical strategies but experiencedifferent individual success while trying to cope with the collective-risksocial dilemma.

1210.6631	risk-driven migration and the collective-risk social dilemma	a collective-risk social dilemma implies that personal endowments will belost if contributions to the common pool within a group are too small. failureto reach the collective target thus has dire consequences for all groupmembers, independently of their strategies. wanting to move away fromunfavorable locations is therefore all but surprising. inspired by theseobservations, we here propose and study a collective-risk social dilemma whereplayers are allowed to move if the collective failure becomes too probable.more precisely, this so-called risk-driven migration is launched depending onthe difference between the actual contributions and the declared target.mobility therefore becomes an inherent property that is utilized in an entirelyself-organizing manner. we show that under these assumptions cooperation ispromoted much more effectively than under the action of manually determinedmigration rates. for the latter, we in fact identify parameter regions wherethe evolution of cooperation is incredibly inhibited. moreover, we findunexpected spatial patterns where cooperators that do not form compact clustersoutperform those that do, and where defectors are able to utilize strikinglydifferent ways of invasion. the presented results support the recently revealedimportance of percolation for the successful evolution of public cooperation,while at the same time revealing surprisingly simple ways of self-organizationtowards socially desirable states.

1210.6949	adaptive and bounded investment returns promote cooperation in spatial  public goods games	the public goods game is one of the most famous models for studying theevolution of cooperation in sizable groups. the multiplication factor in thisgame can characterize the investment return from the public good, which may bevariable depending on the interactive environment in realistic situations.instead of using the same universal value, here we consider that themultiplication factor in each group is updated based on the differences betweenthe local and global interactive environments in the spatial public goods game,but meanwhile limited to within a certain range. we find that the adaptive andbounded investment returns can significantly promote cooperation. inparticular, full cooperation can be achieved for high feedback strength whenappropriate limitation is set for the investment return. also, we show that thefraction of cooperators in the whole population can become larger if the lowerand upper limits of the multiplication factor are increased. furthermore, incomparison to the traditionally spatial public goods game where themultiplication factor in each group is identical and fixed, we find thatcooperation can be better promoted if the multiplication factor is constrainedto adjust between one and the group size in our model. our results highlightthe importance of the locally adaptive and bounded investment returns for theemergence and dominance of cooperative behavior in structured populations.

1302.3546	effectiveness of conditional punishment for the evolution of public  cooperation	collective actions, from city marathons to labor strikes, are oftenmass-driven and subject to the snowball effect. motivated by this, we studyevolutionary advantages of conditional punishment in the spatial public goodsgame. unlike unconditional punishers who always impose the same fines ondefectors, conditional punishers do so proportionally with the number of otherpunishers in the group. phase diagrams in dependence on the punishment fine andcost reveal that the two types of punishers cannot coexist. spontaneouscoarsening of the two strategies leads to an indirect territorial competitionwith the defectors, which is won by unconditional punishers only if thesanctioning is inexpensive. otherwise conditional punishers are the victors ofthe indirect competition, indicating that under more realistic conditions theyare indeed the more effective strategy. both continuous and discontinuous phasetransitions as well as tricritical points characterize the complex evolutionarydynamics, which is due to multipoint interactions that are introduced byconditional punishment. we propose indirect territorial competition as agenerally applicable mechanism relying on pattern formation, by means of whichspatial structure can be utilized by seemingly subordinate strategies to avoidevolutionary extinction.

1303.7225	evolution of emotions on networks leads to the evolution of cooperation  in social dilemmas	we show that the resolution of social dilemmas on random graphs andscale-free networks is facilitated by imitating not the strategy of betterperforming players but rather their emotions. we assume sympathy and envy asthe two emotions that determine the strategy of each player by any giveninteraction, and we define them as probabilities to cooperate with playershaving a lower and higher payoff, respectively. starting with a populationwhere all possible combinations of the two emotions are available, theevolutionary process leads to a spontaneous fixation to a single emotionalprofile that is eventually adopted by all players. however, this emotionalprofile depends not only on the payoffs but also on the heterogeneity of theinteraction network. homogeneous networks, such as lattices and regular randomgraphs, lead to fixations that are characterized by high sympathy and highenvy, while heterogeneous networks lead to low or modest sympathy but also lowenvy. our results thus suggest that public emotions and the propensity tocooperate at large depend, and are in fact determined by the properties of theinteraction network.

1304.4928	if cooperation is likely punish mildly: insights from economic  experiments based on the snowdrift game	punishment may deter antisocial behavior. yet to punish is costly, and thecosts often do not offset the gains that are due to elevated levels ofcooperation. however, the effectiveness of punishment depends not only on howcostly it is, but also on the circumstances defining the social dilemma. usingthe snowdrift game as the basis, we have conducted a series of economicexperiments to determine whether severe punishment is more effective than mildpunishment. we have observed that severe punishment is not necessarily moreeffective, even if the cost of punishment is identical in both cases. thebenefits of severe punishment become evident only under extremely adverseconditions, when to cooperate is highly improbable in the absence of sanctions.if cooperation is likely, mild punishment is not less effective and leads tohigher average payoffs, and is thus the much preferred alternative. presentedresults suggest that the positive effects of punishment stem not only fromimposed fines, but may also have a psychological background. small fines can dowonders in motivating us to chose cooperation over defection, but without theparalyzing effect that may be brought about by large fines. the later should beutilized only when absolutely necessary.

1305.1288	decelerated invasion and waning moon patterns in public goods games with  delayed distribution	we study the evolution of cooperation in the spatial public goods game,focusing on the effects that are brought about by the delayed distribution ofgoods that accumulate in groups due to the continuous investments ofcooperators. we find that intermediate delays enhance network reciprocitybecause of a decelerated invasion of defectors, who are unable to reap the samehigh short-term benefits as they do in the absence of delayed distribution.long delays, however, introduce a risk because the large accumulated wealthmight fall into the wrong hands. indeed, as soon as the curvature of acooperative cluster turns negative, the engulfed defectors can collect theheritage of many generations of cooperators, and by doing so start a waningmoon pattern that nullifies the benefits of decelerated invasion. accidentalmeeting points of growing cooperative clusters may also act as triggers for thewaning moon effect, thus linking the success of cooperators with theirpropensity to fail in a rather bizarre way. our results highlight that"investing into the future" is a good idea only if that future is sufficientlynear and not likely to be burdened by inflation.

1308.4398	understanding recurrent crime as system-immanent collective behavior	containing the spreading of crime is a major challenge for society. yet,since thousands of years, no effective strategy has been found to overcomecrime. to the contrary, empirical evidence shows that crime is recurrent, afact that is not captured well by rational choice theories of crime. accordingto these, strong enough punishment should prevent crime from happening. to gaina better understanding of the relationship between crime and punishment, weconsider that the latter requires prior discovery of illicit behavior and studya spatial version of the inspection game. simulations reveal the spontaneousemergence of cyclic dominance between ''criminals'', ''inspectors'', and''ordinary people'' as a consequence of spatial interactions. such cyclesdominate the evolutionary process, in particular when the temptation to commitcrime or the cost of inspection are low or moderate. yet, there are alsocritical parameter values beyond which cycles cease to exist and the populationis dominated either by a stable mixture of criminals and inspectors or one ofthese two strategies alone. both continuous and discontinuous phase transitionsto different final states are possible, indicating that successful strategiesto contain crime can be very much counter-intuitive and complex. our resultsdemonstrate that spatial interactions are crucial for the evolutionary outcomeof the inspection game, and they also reveal why criminal behavior is likely tobe recurrent rather than evolving towards an equilibrium with monotonousparameter dependencies.

1310.5139	correlation of positive and negative reciprocity fails to confer an  evolutionary advantage: phase transitions to elementary strategies	economic experiments reveal that humans value cooperation and fairness.punishing unfair behavior is therefore common, and according to the theory ofstrong reciprocity, it is also directly related to rewarding cooperativebehavior. however, empirical data fail to confirm that positive and negativereciprocity are correlated. inspired by this disagreement, we determine whetherthe combined application of reward and punishment is evolutionary advantageous.we study a spatial public goods game, where in addition to the three elementarystrategies of defection, rewarding and punishment, a fourth strategy combiningthe later two competes for space. we find rich dynamical behavior that givesrise to intricate phase diagrams where continuous and discontinuous phasetransitions occur in succession. indirect territorial competition, spontaneousemergence of cyclic dominance, as well as divergent fluctuations ofoscillations that terminate in an absorbing phase are observed. yet despite thehigh complexity of solutions, the combined strategy can survive only in verynarrow and unrealistic parameter regions. elementary strategies, either in pureor mixed phases, are much more common and likely to prevail. our resultshighlight the importance of patterns and structure in human cooperation, whichshould be considered in future experiments.

1403.6663	can scale-freeness offset delayed signal detection in neuronal networks?	first spike latency following stimulus onset is of significant physiologicalrelevance. neurons transmit information about their inputs by transforming theminto spike trains, and the timing of these spike trains is in turn crucial foreffectively encoding that information. random processes and uncertainty thatunderly neuronal dynamics have been shown to prolong the time towards the firstresponse in a phenomenon dubbed noise-delayed decay. here we study whetherhodgkin-huxley neurons with a tunable intensity of intrinsic noise might haveshorter response times to external stimuli just above threshold if placed on ascale-free network. we show that the heterogeneity of the interaction networkmay indeed eradicate slow responsiveness, but only if the coupling betweenindividual neurons is sufficiently strong. increasing the average degree alsofavors a fast response, but it is less effective than increasing the couplingstrength. we also show that noise-delayed decay can be offset further byadjusting the frequency of the external signal, as well as by blocking afraction of voltage-gated sodium or potassium ion channels. for certainconditions, we observe a double peak in the response time depending on theintensity of intrinsic noise, indicating competition between local and globaleffects on the neuronal dynamics.

1404.0367	facilitators on networks reveal the optimal interplay between  information exchange and reciprocity	reciprocity is firmly established as an important mechanism that promotescooperation. an efficient information exchange is likewise important,especially on structured populations, where interactions between players arelimited. motivated by these two facts, we explore the role of facilitators insocial dilemmas on networks. facilitators are here mirrors to their neighbors-- they cooperate with cooperators and defect with defectors -- but they do notparticipate in the exchange of strategies. as such, in addition to introducingdirect reciprocity, they also obstruct information exchange. in well-mixedpopulations, facilitators favor the replacement and invasion of defection bycooperation as long as their number exceeds a critical value. in structuredpopulations, on the other hand, there exists a delicate balance between thebenefits of reciprocity and the deterioration of information exchange.extensive monte carlo simulations of social dilemmas on various interactionnetworks reveal that there exists an optimal interplay between reciprocity andinformation exchange, which sets in only when a small number of facilitatorsoccupies the main hubs of the scale-free network. the drawbacks of missingcooperative hubs are more than compensated by reciprocity and, at the sametime, the compromised information exchange is routed via the auxiliary hubswith only marginal losses in effectivity. these results indicate that it is notalways optimal for the main hubs to become ''leaders of the masses'', butrather to exploit their highly connected state to promote tit-for-tat-likebehavior.

1404.1069	rewarding evolutionary fitness with links between populations promotes  cooperation	evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma and the public goods gameis studied, where initially players belong to two independent structuredpopulations. simultaneously with the strategy evolution, players whose currentutility exceeds a threshold are rewarded by an external link to a playerbelonging to the other population. yet as soon as the utility drops below thethreshold, the external link is terminated. the rewarding of currentevolutionary fitness thus introduces a time-varying interdependence between thetwo populations. we show that, regardless of the details of the evolutionarygame and the interaction structure, the self-organization of fitness and rewardgives rise to distinguished players that act as strong catalysts of cooperativebehavior. however, there also exist critical utility thresholds beyond whichdistinguished players are no longer able to percolate. the interdependencebetween the two populations then vanishes, and cooperators are forced to relyon traditional network reciprocity alone. we thus demonstrate that a simplestrategy-independent form of rewarding may significantly expand the scope ofcooperation on structured populations. the formation of links outside theimmediate community seems particularly applicable in human societies, where anindividual is typically member in many different social networks.

1404.2923	self-organization towards optimally interdependent networks by means of  coevolution	coevolution between strategy and network structure is established as a meansto arrive at optimal conditions for resolving social dilemmas. yet recentresearch highlights that the interdependence between networks may be just asimportant as the structure of an individual network. we therefore introducecoevolution of strategy and network interdependence to study whether it cangive rise to elevated levels of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game. weshow that the interdependence between networks self-organizes so as to yieldoptimal conditions for the evolution of cooperation. even under extremelyadverse conditions cooperators can prevail where on isolated networks theywould perish. this is due to the spontaneous emergence of a two-class society,with only the upper class being allowed to control and take advantage of theinterdependence. spatial patterns reveal that cooperators, once arriving to theupper class, are much more competent than defectors in sustaining compactclusters of followers. indeed, the asymmetric exploitation of interdependenceconfers to them a strong evolutionary advantage that may resolve even thetoughest of social dilemmas.

0803.0070	spatial coherence resonance on diffusive and small-world networks of  hodgkin-huxley neurons	spatial coherence resonance in a spatially extended system that is locallymodeled by hodgkin-huxley (hh) neurons is studied in this paper. we focus onthe ability of additive temporally and spatially uncorrelated gaussian noise toextract a particular spatial frequency of excitatory waves in the medium,whereby examining also the impact of diffusive and small-world network topologydetermining the interactions amongst coupled hh neurons. we show that thereexists an intermediate noise intensity that is able to extract a characteristicspatial frequency of the system in a resonant manner provided the latter isdiffusively coupled, thus indicating the existence of spatial coherenceresonance. however, as the diffusive topology of the medium is relaxed via theintroduction of shortcut links introducing small-world properties amongstcoupled hh neurons, the ability of additive gaussian noise to evoke orderedexcitatory waves deteriorates rather spectacularly, leading to the decoherenceof the spatial dynamics and with it related absence of spatial coherenceresonance. in particular, already a minute fraction of shortcut links sufficesto substantially disrupt coherent pattern formation in the examined system.

1406.1784	degree mixing in multilayer networks impedes the evolution of  cooperation	traditionally, the evolution of cooperation has been studied on single,isolated networks. yet a player, especially in human societies, will typicallybe a member of many different networks, and those networks will play adifferent role in the evolutionary process. multilayer networks are thereforerapidly gaining on popularity as the more apt description of a networkedsociety. with this motivation, we here consider 2-layer scale-free networkswith all possible combinations of degree mixing, wherein one network layer isused for the accumulation of payoffs and the other is used for strategyupdating. we find that breaking the symmetry through assortative mixing in onelayer and/or disassortative mixing in the other layer, as well as preservingthe symmetry by means of assortative mixing in both layers, impedes theevolution of cooperation. we use degree-dependent distributions of strategiesand cluster-size analysis to explain these results, which highlight theimportance of hubs and the preservation of symmetry between multilayer networksfor the successful resolution of social dilemmas.

1406.3340	from pairwise to group interactions in games of cyclic dominance	we study the rock-paper-scissors game in structured populations, where theinvasion rates determine individual payoffs that govern the process of strategychange. the traditional version of the game is recovered if the payoffs foreach potential invasion stem from a single pairwise interaction. however, thetransformation of invasion rates to payoffs also allows the usage of largerinteraction ranges. in addition to the traditional pairwise interaction, wetherefore consider simultaneous interactions with all nearest neighbors, aswell as with all nearest and next-nearest neighbors, thus effectively goingfrom single pair to group interactions in games of cyclic dominance. we showthat differences in the interaction range affect not only the stationaryfractions of strategies, but also their relations of dominance. the transitionfrom pairwise to group interactions can thus decelerate and even revert thedirection of the invasion between the competing strategies. like inevolutionary social dilemmas, in games of cyclic dominance too the indirectmultipoint interactions that are due to group interactions hence play a pivotalrole. our results indicate that, in addition to the invasion rates, theinteraction range is at least as important for the maintenance of biodiversityamong cyclically competing strategies.

1409.1560	optimal distribution of incentives for public cooperation in  heterogeneous interaction environments	in the framework of evolutionary games with institutional reciprocity,limited incentives are at disposal for rewarding cooperators and punishingdefectors. in the simplest case, it can be assumed that, depending on theirstrategies, all players receive equal incentives from the common pool. thequestion arises, however, what is the optimal distribution of institutionalincentives? how should we best reward and punish individuals for cooperation tothrive? we study this problem for the public goods game on a scale-freenetwork. we show that if the synergetic effects of group interactions are weak,the level of cooperation in the population can be maximized simply by adoptingthe simplest "equal distribution" scheme. if synergetic effects are strong,however, it is best to reward high-degree nodes more than low-degree nodes.these distribution schemes for institutional rewards are independent of payoffnormalization. for institutional punishment, however, the same optimizationproblem is more complex, and its solution depends on whether absolute ordegree-normalized payoffs are used. we find that degree-normalized payoffsrequire high-degree nodes be punished more lenient than low-degree nodes.conversely, if absolute payoffs count, then high-degree nodes should bepunished stronger than low-degree nodes.

1410.1863	costly hide and seek pays: unexpected consequences of deceit in a social  dilemma	deliberate deceptiveness intended to gain an advantage is commonplace inhuman and animal societies. in a social dilemma, an individual may only pretendto be a cooperator to elicit cooperation from others, while in reality he is adefector. with this as motivation, we study a simple variant of theevolutionary prisoner's dilemma game entailing deceitful defectors andconditional cooperators that lifts the veil on the impact of such two-facedbehavior. defectors are able to hide their true intentions at a personal cost,while conditional cooperators are probabilistically successful at identifyingdefectors and act accordingly. by focusing on the evolutionary outcomes instructured populations, we observe a number of unexpected and counterintuitivephenomena. we show that deceitful behavior may fare better if it is costly, andthat a higher success rate of identifying defectors does not necessarily favorcooperative behavior. these results are rooted in the spontaneous emergence ofcycling dominance and spatial patterns that give rise to fascinating phasetransitions, which in turn reveal the hidden complexity behind the evolution ofdeception.

1410.2598	different perceptions of social dilemmas: evolutionary multigames in  structured populations	motivated by the fact that the same social dilemma can be perceiveddifferently by different players, we here study evolutionary multigames instructured populations. while the core game is the weak prisoner's dilemma, afraction of the population adopts either a positive or a negative value of thesucker's payoff, thus playing either the traditional prisoner's dilemma or thesnowdrift game. we show that the higher the fraction of the population adoptinga different payoff matrix, the more the evolution of cooperation is promoted.the microscopic mechanism responsible for this outcome is unique to structuredpopulations, and it is due to the payoff heterogeneity, which spontaneouslyintroduces strong cooperative leaders that give rise to an asymmetric strategyimitation flow in favor of cooperation. we demonstrate that the reportedevolutionary outcomes are robust against variations of the interaction network,and they also remain valid if players are allowed to vary which game they playover time. these results corroborate existing evidence in favor ofheterogeneity-enhanced network reciprocity, and they reveal how differentperceptions of social dilemmas may contribute to their resolution.

1410.4546	coevolutionary success-driven multigames	wealthy individuals may be less tempted to defect than those withcomparatively low payoffs. to take this into consideration, we introducecoevolutionary success-driven multigames in structured populations. while thecore game is always the weak prisoner's dilemma, players whose payoffs from theprevious round exceed a threshold adopt only a minimally low temptation todefect in the next round. along with the strategies, the perceived strength ofthe social dilemma thus coevolves with the success of each individual player.we show that the lower the threshold for using the small temptation to defect,the more the evolution of cooperation is promoted. importantly, the promotionof cooperation is not simply due to a lower average temptation to defect, butrather due to a dynamically reversed direction of invasion along the interfacesthat separate cooperators and defectors on regular networks. conversely, onirregular networks, in the absence of clear invasion fronts, the promotion ofcooperation is due to intermediate-degree players. at sufficiently lowthreshold values, these players accelerate the erosion of defectors andsignificantly shorten the fixation time towards more cooperative stationarystates. coevolutionary multigames could thus be the new frontier for the swiftresolution of social dilemmas.

1411.3708	solving the collective-risk social dilemma with risky assets in  well-mixed and structured populations	in the collective-risk social dilemma, players lose their personal endowmentsif contributions to the common pool are too small. this fact alone, however,does not always deter selfish individuals from defecting. the temptations tofree-ride on the prosocial efforts of others are strong because we arehardwired to maximize our own fitness regardless of the consequences this mighthave for the public good. here we show that the addition of risky assets to thepersonal endowments, both of which are lost if the collective target is notreached, can contribute to solving the collective-risk social dilemma. ininfinite well-mixed populations risky assets introduce new stable and unstablemixed steady states, whereby the stable mixed steady state converges to fullcooperation as either the risk of collective failure or the amount of riskyassets increases. similarly, in finite well-mixed populations the introductionof risky assets enforces configurations where cooperative behavior thrives. instructured populations cooperation is promoted as well, but the distribution ofassets amongst the groups is crucial. surprisingly, we find that the completelyrational allocation of assets only to the most successful groups is notoptimal, and this regardless of whether the risk of collective failure is highor low. instead, in low-risk situations bounded rational allocation of assetsworks best, while in high-risk situations the simplest uniform distribution ofassets among all the groups is optimal. these results indicate that prosocialbehavior depends sensitively on the potential losses individuals are likely toendure if they fail to cooperate.

1412.4113	conformity enhances network reciprocity in evolutionary social dilemmas	the pursuit of highest payoffs in evolutionary social dilemmas is risky andsometimes inferior to conformity. choosing the most common strategy within theinteraction range is safer because it ensures that the payoff of an individualwill not be much lower than average. herding instincts and crowd behavior inhumans and social animals also compel to conformity on their own right.motivated by these facts, we here study the impact of conformity on theevolution of cooperation in social dilemmas. we show that an appropriatefraction of conformists within the population introduces an effective surfacetension around cooperative clusters and ensures smooth interfaces betweendifferent strategy domains. payoff-driven players brake the symmetry in favorof cooperation and enable an expansion of clusters past the boundaries imposedby traditional network reciprocity. this mechanism works even under the mosttesting conditions, and it is robust against variations of the interactionnetwork as long as degree-normalized payoffs are applied. conformity may thusbe beneficial for the resolution of social dilemmas.

1501.04348	the cost of attack in competing networks	real-world attacks can be interpreted as the result of competitiveinteractions between networks, ranging from predator-prey networks to networksof countries under economic sanctions. although the purpose of an attack is todamage a target network, it also curtails the ability of the attacker, whichmust choose the duration and magnitude of an attack to avoid negative impactson its own functioning. nevertheless, despite the large number of studies oninterconnected networks, the consequences of initiating an attack have neverbeen studied. here, we address this issue by introducing a model of networkcompetition where a resilient network is willing to partially weaken its ownresilience in order to more severely damage a less resilient competitor. theattacking network can take over the competitor nodes after their longinactivity. however, due to a feedback mechanism the takeovers weaken theresilience of the attacking network. we define a conservation law that relatesthe feedback mechanism to the resilience dynamics for two competing networks.within this formalism, we determine the cost and optimal duration of an attack,allowing a network to evaluate the risk of initiating hostilities.

1501.06558	directional learning and the provisioning of public goods	we consider an environment where players are involved in a public goods gameand must decide repeatedly whether to make an individual contribution or not.however, players lack strategically relevant information about the game andabout the other players in the population. the resulting behavior of players iscompletely uncoupled from such information, and the individual strategyadjustment dynamics are driven only by reinforcement feedbacks from eachplayer's own past. we show that the resulting "directional learning" issufficient to explain cooperative deviations away from the nash equilibrium. weintroduce the concept of k-strong equilibria, which nest both the nashequilibrium and the aumann-strong equilibrium as two special cases, and we showthat, together with the parameters of the learning model, the maximalk-strength of equilibrium determines the stationary distribution. theprovisioning of public goods can be secured even under adverse conditions, aslong as players are sufficiently responsive to the changes in their own payoffsand adjust their actions accordingly. substantial levels of public cooperationcan thus be explained without arguments involving selflessness or socialpreferences, solely on the basis of uncoordinated directional (mis)learning.

1502.07724	dynamic instability of cooperation due to diverse activity patterns in  evolutionary social dilemmas	individuals might abstain from participating in an instance of anevolutionary game for various reasons, ranging from lack of interest to riskaversion. in order to understand the consequences of such diverse activitypatterns on the evolution of cooperation, we study a weak prisoner's dilemmawhere each player's participation is probabilistic rather than certain. playersthat do not participate get a null payoff and are unable to replicate. we showthat inactivity introduces cascading failures of cooperation, which areparticularly severe on scale-free networks with frequently inactive hubs. thedrops in the fraction of cooperators are sudden, while the spatiotemporalreorganization of compact cooperative clusters, and thus the recovery, takestime. nevertheless, if the activity of players is directly proportional totheir degree, or if the interaction network is not strongly heterogeneous, theoverall evolution of cooperation is not impaired. this is because inactivitynegatively affects the potency of low-degree defectors, who are hence unable toutilize on their inherent evolutionary advantage. between cascading failures,the fraction of cooperators is therefore higher than usual, which lastlybalances out the asymmetric dynamic instabilities that emerge due tointermittent blackouts of cooperative hubs.

1504.04359	evolutionary games on multilayer networks: a colloquium	networks form the backbone of many complex systems, ranging from the internetto human societies. accordingly, not only is the range of our interactionslimited and thus best described and modeled by networks, it is also a fact thatthe networks that are an integral part of such models are often interdependentor even interconnected. networks of networks or multilayer networks aretherefore a more apt description of social systems. this colloquium is devotedto evolutionary games on multilayer networks, and in particular to theevolution of cooperation as one of the main pillars of modern human societies.we first give an overview of the most significant conceptual differencesbetween single-layer and multilayer networks, and we provide basic definitionsand a classification of the most commonly used terms. subsequently, we reviewfascinating and counterintuitive evolutionary outcomes that emerge due todifferent types of interdependencies between otherwise independent populations.the focus is on coupling through the utilities of players, through the flow ofinformation, as well as through the popularity of different strategies ondifferent network layers. the colloquium highlights the importance of patternformation and collective behavior for the promotion of cooperation underadverse conditions, as well as the synergies between network science andevolutionary game theory.

1505.03853	a double-edged sword: benefits and pitfalls of heterogeneous punishment  in evolutionary inspection games	as a simple model for criminal behavior, the traditional two-strategyinspection game yields counterintuitive results that fail to describe empiricaldata. the latter shows that crime is often recurrent, and that crime rates donot respond linearly to mitigation attempts. a more apt model entails ordinarypeople who neither commit nor sanction crime as the third strategy besides thecriminals and punishers. since ordinary people free-ride on the sanctioningefforts of punishers, they may introduce cyclic dominance that enables thecoexistence of all three competing strategies. in this setup ordinaryindividuals become the biggest impediment to crime abatement. we therefore alsoconsider heterogeneous punisher strategies, which seek to reduce theirinvestment into fighting crime in order to attain a more competitive payoff. weshow that this diversity of punishment leads to an explosion of complexity inthe system, where the benefits and pitfalls of criminal behavior are revealedin the most unexpected ways. due to the raise and fall of different alliancesno less than six consecutive phase transitions occur in dependence on solelythe temptation to succumb to criminal behavior, leading the population fromordinary people-dominated across punisher-dominated to crime-dominated phases,yet always failing to abolish crime completely.

1507.00717	stability of cooperation under image scoring in group interactions	image scoring sustains cooperation in the repeated two-player prisoner'sdilemma through indirect reciprocity, even though defection is the uniquelydominant selfish behaviour in the one-shot game. many real-world dilemmasituations, however, firstly, take place in groups and, secondly, lack thenecessary transparency to inform subjects reliably of others' individual pastactions. instead, there is revelation of information regarding groups, whichallows for `group scoring' but not for image scoring. here, we study howsensitive the positive results related to image scoring are to informationbased on group scoring. we combine analytic results and computer simulations tospecify the conditions for the emergence of cooperation. we show that underpure group scoring, that is, under the complete absence of image-scoringinformation, cooperation is unsustainable. away from this extreme case,however, the necessary degree of image scoring relative to group scoringdepends on the population size and is generally very small. we thus concludethat the positive results based on image scoring apply to a much broader rangeof informational settings that are relevant in the real world than previouslyassumed.

0805.2759	stochastic resonance in soft matter systems: combined effects of static  and dynamic disorder	we study the impact of static and dynamic disorder on the phenomenon ofstochastic resonance (sr) in a representative soft matter system. due to theirextreme susceptibility to weak perturbations soft matter systems appear to beexcellent candidates for the observation of sr. indeed, we derive generic srequations from a polymer stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal (lc) cell,which is a typical soft matter representative constituting one of the basiccomponents in several electro-optic applications. we generalize these equationsfurther in order to study an even broader class of qualitatively differentsystems, especially disclosing the influence of different types of staticdisorder and interaction ranges amongst lc molecules on the sr response. wedetermine the required conditions for the observation of sr in the examinedsystem, and moreover, reveal that a random field type static disorder yieldsqualitatively different responses with respect to random dilution, random bondand spin glass universality classes. in particular, while the latter threedecrease the level of dynamic disorder (gaussian noise) warranting the optimalresponse, the former evokes exactly the opposite effect, hence increasing theoptimal noise level that is needed to resonantly fine-tune the system'sresponse in accordance with the weak deterministic electric field. theseobservations are shown to be independent of the system size and range ofinteractions, thus implying their general validity and potentially wideapplicability also within other similar settings. we argue that soft mattersystems might be particularly adequate as a base for different sr-basedsensitive detectors and thus potent candidates for additional theoretical aswell as experimental research in the presently outlined direction.

1507.03254	activation process in excitable systems with multiple noise sources:  large number of units	we study the activation process in large assemblies of type ii excitableunits whose dynamics is influenced by two independent noise terms. themean-field approach is applied to explicitly demonstrate that the assembly ofexcitable units can itself exhibit macroscopic excitable behavior. in order tofacilitate the comparison between the excitable dynamics of a single unit andan assembly, we introduce three distinct formulations of the assemblyactivation event. each formulation treats different aspects of the relevantphenomena, including the threshold-like behavior and the role of coherence ofindividual spikes. statistical properties of the assembly activation process,such as the mean time-to-first pulse and the associated coefficient ofvariation, are found to be qualitatively analogous for all three formulations,as well as to resemble the results for a single unit. these analogies are shownto derive from the fact that global variables undergo a stochastic bifurcationfrom the stochastically stable fixed point to continuous oscillations. localactivation processes are analyzed in the light of the competition between thenoise-led and the relaxation-driven dynamics. we also briefly report on asystem-size anti-resonant effect displayed by the mean time-to-first pulse.

1508.03325	competition and cooperation among different punishing strategies in the  spatial public goods game	inspired by the fact that people have diverse propensities to punishwrongdoers, we study a spatial public goods game with defectors and differenttypes of punishing cooperators. during the game, cooperators punish defectorswith class-specific probabilities and subsequently share the associated costsof sanctioning. we show that in the presence of different punishing cooperatorsthe highest level of public cooperation is always attainable through aselection mechanism. interestingly, the selection not necessarily favors theevolution of punishers who would be able to prevail on their own against thedefectors, nor does it always hinder the evolution of punishers who would beunable to prevail on their own. instead, the evolutionary success of punishingstrategies depends sensitively on their invasion velocities, which in turnreveals fascinating examples of both competition and cooperation among them.furthermore, we show that under favorable conditions, when punishment is notstrictly necessary for the maintenance of public cooperation, the lessaggressive, mild form of sanctioning is the sole victor of selection process.our work reveals that natural strategy selection can not only promote, butsometimes also hinder competition among prosocial strategies.

1510.08831	antisocial pool rewarding does not deter public cooperation	rewarding cooperation is in many ways expected behaviour from social players.however, strategies that promote antisocial behaviour are also surprisinglycommon, not just in human societies, but also among eusocial insects andbacteria. examples include sanctioning of individuals who behave prosocially,or rewarding of freeriders who do not contribute to collective enterprises. wetherefore study the public goods game with antisocial and prosocial poolrewarding in order to determine the potential negative consequences on theeffectiveness of positive incentives to promote cooperation. contrary to anaive expectation, we show that the ability of defectors to distribute rewardsto their like does not deter public cooperation as long as cooperators are ableto do the same. even in the presence of antisocial rewarding the spatialselection for cooperation in evolutionary social dilemmas is enhanced. sincethe administration of rewards to either strategy requires a considerable degreeof aggregation, cooperators can enjoy the benefits of their prosocialcontributions as well as the corresponding rewards. defectors when aggregated,on the other hand, can enjoy antisocial rewards, but due to their lack ofcontributions to the public good they ultimately succumb to their inherentinability to secure a sustainable future. strategies that facilitate theaggregation of akin players, even if they seek to promote antisocial behaviour,thus always enhance the long-term benefits of cooperation.

1511.01891	vortices determine the dynamics of biodiversity in cyclical interactions  with protection spillovers	if rock beats scissors and scissors beat paper, one might assume that rockbeats paper too. but this is not the case for intransitive relationships thatmake up the famous rock-paper-scissors game. however, the sole presence ofpaper might prevent rock from beating scissors, simply because paper beatsrock. this is the blueprint for the rock-paper-scissors game with protectionspillovers, which has recently been introduced as a new paradigm forbiodiversity in well-mixed microbial populations. here we study the game instructured populations, demonstrating that protection spillovers give rise tospatial patterns that are impossible to observe in the classicalrock-paper-scissors game. we show that the spatiotemporal dynamics of thesystem is determined by the density of stable vortices, which may ultimatelytransform to frozen states, to propagating waves, or to target waves withreversed propagation direction, depending further on the degree and type ofrandomness in the interactions among the species. if vortices are rare, thefixation to waves and complex oscillatory solutions is likelier. moreover,annealed randomness in interactions favors the emergence of target waves, whilequenched randomness favors collective synchronization. our results demonstratethat protection spillovers may fundamentally change the dynamics of cyclicdominance in structured populations, and they outline the possibility ofprogramming pattern formation in microbial populations.

0812.1122	promoting cooperation in social dilemmas via simple coevolutionary rules	we study the evolution of cooperation in structured populations withinpopular models of social dilemmas, whereby simple coevolutionary rules areintroduced that may enhance players abilities to enforce their strategy on theopponent. coevolution thus here refers to an evolutionary process affecting theteaching activity of players that accompanies the evolution of theirstrategies. particularly, we increase the teaching activity of a player afterit has successfully reproduced, yet we do so depending on the disseminatedstrategy. we separately consider coevolution affecting either only thecooperators or only the defectors, and show that both options promotecooperation irrespective of the applied game. opposite to intuitive reasoning,however, we reveal that the coevolutionary promotion of players spreadingdefection is, in the long run, more beneficial for cooperation than thelikewise promotion of cooperators. we explain the contradictory impact of thetwo considered coevolutionary rules by examining the differences betweenresulting heterogeneities that segregate participating players, andfurthermore, demonstrate that the influential individuals completely determinethe final outcome of the games. our findings are immune to changes defining thetype of considered social dilemmas and highlight that the heterogeneity ofplayers, resulting in a positive feedback mechanism, is a fundamental propertypromoting cooperation in groups of selfish individuals.
