0901.1238	low frequency qpo spectra and lense-thirring precession	we show that the low frequency qpo seen in the power density spectra of blackhole binaries (and neutron stars) can be explained by lense-thirringprecession. this has been proposed many times in the past, and simple, singleradius models can qualitatively match the observed increase in qpo frequency bydecreasing a characteristic radius, as predicted by the truncated disc models.however, this also predicts that the frequency is strongly dependent on spin,and gives a maximum frequency at the last stable orbit which is generally muchhigher than the remarkably constant maximum frequency at ~10hz observed in allblack hole binaries. the key aspect of our model which makes it match theseobservations is that the precession is of a radially extended region of the hotinner flow. the outer radius is set by the truncation radius of the disc asabove, but the inner radius lies well outside of the last stable orbit at thepoint where numerical simulations show that the density drops off sharply for amisaligned flow. physically motivated analytic estimates for this inner radiusshow that it increases with a_*, decreasing the expected frequency in a waywhich almost completely cancels the expected increase with spin. this ties themaximum predicted frequency to around 10hz irrespective of a_*, as observed.this is the first qpo model which explains both frequencies and spectrum in thecontext of a well established geometry for the accretion flow.

0905.4076	the ultraluminous state	(abridged) we revisit the question of the nature of ulxs through a detailedinvestigation of their spectral shape, using the highest quality x-ray dataavailable in the xmm-newton public archives. we confirm that simple spectralmodels commonly used for the analysis and interpretation of ulxs (power-lawcontinuum and multi-colour disc blackbody models) are inadequate in the face ofsuch high quality data. instead we find two near ubiquitous features in thespectrum: a soft excess and a roll-over in the spectrum at energies above 3kev.we investigate a range of more physical models to describe these data. we findthat disc plus comptonised corona models fit the data well, but the derivedcorona is cool, and optically thick (tau ~ 5-30). we argue that these observeddisc temperatures are not a good indicator of the black hole mass as thepowerful, optically thick corona drains energy from the inner disc, andobscures it. we estimate the intrinsic (corona-less) disc temperature, anddemonstrate that in most cases it lies in the regime of stellar mass blackholes. these objects have spectra which range from those similar to the highestmass accretion rate states in galactic binaries, to those which clearly havetwo peaks, one at energies below 1 kev (from the outer, uncomptonised disc) andone above 3 kev (from the comptonised, inner disc). however, a few ulxs have asignificantly cooler corrected disc temperature; we suggest that these are themost extreme stellar mass black hole accretors, in which a massive windcompletely envelopes the inner disc regions, creating a cool photosphere. weconclude that ulxs provide us with an observational template for the transitionbetween eddington and super-eddington accretion flows, with the latteroccupying a new ultraluminous accretion state.

0907.5485	a physical interpretation of the variability power spectral components  in accreting neutron stars	we propose a physical framework for interpreting the characteristicfrequencies seen in the broad band power spectra from black hole and neutronstar binaries. we use the truncated disc/hot inner flow geometry, and assumethat the hot flow is generically turbulent. each radius in the hot flowproduces fluctuations, and we further assume that these are damped on theviscous frequency. integrating over radii gives broad band continuum noisepower between low and high frequency breaks which are set by the viscoustimescale at the outer and inner edge of the hot flow, respectively.lense-thirring (vertical) precession of the entire hot flow superimposes thelow frequency qpo on this continuum power.  we test this model on the power spectra seen in the neutron star systems(atolls) as these have the key advantage that the (upper) khz qpo most likelyindependently tracks the truncation radius. these show that this model can givea consistent solution, with the truncation radius decreasing from 20-8 rg whilethe inner radius of the flow remains approximately constant at ~4.5 rg i.e. 9.2km. we use this very constrained geometry to predict the low frequency qpo fromlense-thirring precession of the entire hot flow from r_o to r_i. the simplestassumption of a constant surface density in the hot flow matches the observedqpo frequency to within 25 per cent. this match can be made even better byconsidering that the surface density should become increasingly centrallyconcentrated as the flow collapses into an optically thick boundary layerduring the spectral transition. the success of the model opens up the way touse the broad band power spectra as a diagnostic of accretion flows in stronggravity.

0911.0287	an additional soft x-ray component in the dim low/hard state of black  hole binaries	we test the truncated disc models using multiwavelength (optical/uv/x-ray)data from the 2005 hard state outburst of the black hole swift j1753.5-0127.this system is both fairly bright and has fairly low interstellar absorption,so gives one of the best datasets to study the weak, cool disc emission in thisstate. we fit these data using models of an x-ray illuminated disc to constrainthe inner disc radius throughout the outburst. close to the peak, the observedsoft x-ray component is consistent with being produced by the inner disc, withits intrinsic emission enhanced in temperature and luminosity by reprocessingof hard x-ray illumination in an overlap region between the disc and corona.this disc emission provides the seed photons for compton scattering to producethe hard x-ray spectrum, and these hard x-rays also illuminate the outer disc,producing the optical emission by reprocessing.  however, the situation is very different as the outburst declines. theoptical is probably cyclo-synchrotron radiation, self-generated by the flow,rather than tracing the outer disc. similarly, limits from reprocessing make itunlikely that the soft x-rays are directly tracing the inner disc radius. thisis seen more clearly in a similarly dim low/hard state spectrum from xtej1118+480. the very small emitting area implied by the relatively hightemperature soft x-ray component is completely inconsistent with the muchlarger, cooler, uv component which is well fit by a truncated disc. wespeculate on the origin of this component, but its existence as a clearlyseparate spectral component from the truncated disc in xte j1118+480 shows thatit does not simply trace the inner disc radius, so cannot constrain thetruncated disc models.

0911.3281	limits on spin determination from disc spectral fitting in gx 339-4	we attempt to constrain the black hole spin in gx 339-4 from spectral fittingof disc dominated data using rxte spectra from the three most recent outbursts.we use the best current models for the disc emission, including full radiativetransfer through the photosphere rather than assuming that the intrinsicemission from each radius has a (colour temperature corrected) blackbodyspectrum. the results strongly depend on the poorly known binary systemparameters, but we find a strict upper limit of a&lt;0.9 for any distance greaterthan 6 kpc, assuming that the orbital inclination is the same as that of theinner disc. by contrast, the higher spin of 0.935 +/- 0.01 (statistical)+/-0.01 (systematic) claimed from fitting the iron line profile in this objectrequires that the inner disc is misaligned by over 20 degrees from the orbitalinclination. while some of these datasets are distorted by instrumental pileup,the same spin/inclination constraints are derived from data which are not piledup, so there is a real conflict between the two techniques to measure spin. weargue that the disc spectral fits are more likely to be robust hence that thereare still issues to be understood in the iron line profile.

0708.0148	modelling the behaviour of accretion flows in x-ray binaries	(abridged) we review how the recent increase in x-ray and radio data fromblack hole and neutron star binaries can be merged together with theoreticaladvances to give a coherent picture of the physics of the accretion flow instrong gravity. both long term x-ray light curves, x-ray spectra, the rapidx-ray variability and the radio jet behaviour are consistent with a model wherea standard outer accretion disc is truncated at low luminosities, beingreplaced by a hot, inner flow which also acts as the launching site of the jet.decreasing the disc truncation radius leads to softer spectra, as well ashigher frequencies (including qpo's) in the power spectra, and a faster jet.the collapse of the hot flow when the disc reaches the last stable orbittriggers the dramatic decrease in radio flux, as well as giving a qualitative(and often quantitative) explanation for the major hard--soft spectraltransition seen in black holes and neutron stars.  after collapse of the hot inner flow, the spectrum in black hole systems canbe dominated by the disc emission. its behaviour is consistent with theexistence of a last stable orbit, and such data can be used to estimate theblack hole spin. these systems can also show very different spectra at thesehigh luminosities, in which the disc spectrum is strongly distorted bycomptonization. the structure of the accretion flow becomes increasinglyuncertain as the luminosity approaches (and exceeds) the eddington luminosity,though there is growing evidence that winds play an important role. we stressthat these high eddington fraction flows are key to understanding manydisparate and currently very active fields such as ulx, narrow line seyfert1's, and the growth of the first black holes in the early universe.

1003.3350	testing accretion disk structure with suzaku data of lmc x-3	the suzaku observation of lmc x-3 gives the best data to date on the shape ofthe accretion disk spectrum. this is due to the combination of very lowabsorbing column density along this line of sight which allows the shape of thedisk emisison to be constrained at low energies by the ccd's, while the tailcan be simultaneously determined up to 30 kev by the high energy detectors.these data clearly demonstrate that the observed disk spectrum is broader thana simple 'sum of blackbodies', and relativistic smearing of the emission isstrongly required. however, the intrinsic emission should be more complex thana (color-corrected) sum of blackbodies as it should also contain photo-electricabsorption edges from the partially ionised disk photosphere. these arebroadened by the relativistic smearing, but the models predict ~ 3-5 per centdeviations for 1/3- 1 solar abundance around the edge energies, significantlystronger than observed. this indicate that the models need to include morephysical processes such as self-irradiation, bound-bound (line) absorption,and/or emission from recombination continuua and/or lines. alternatively, ifnone of these match the data, it may instead require that the accretion diskdensity and/or emissivity profile with height is different to that assumed.thus these data demonstrate the feasibility of observational tests of ourfundamental understanding of the vertical structure of accretion disks.

1103.1256	modelling the high mass accretion rate spectra of gx 339-4: black hole  spin from reflection?	we extract all the xmm-newton epic pn burst mode spectra of gx 339-4,together with simultaneous/contemporaneous rxte data. these include three discdominated and two soft intermediate spectra, and the combination of broadbandpass/moderate spectral resolution gives some of the best data on thesebright soft states in black hole binaries. the disc dominated spectra span afactor three in luminosity, and all show that the disc emission is broader thanthe simplest multicolour disc model. this is consistent with the expectedrelativistic smearing and changing colour temperature correction produced byatomic features in the newest disc models. however, these models do not matchthe data at the 5 per cent level as the predicted atomic features are notpresent in the data, perhaps indicating that irradiation is important even whenthe high energy tail is weak. whatever the reason, this means that the datahave smaller errors than the best physical disc models, forcing use of morephenomenological models for the disc emission. we use these for the softintermediate state data, where previous analysis using a simple disc continuumfound an extremely broad residual, identified as the red wing of the iron linefrom reflection around a highly spinning black hole. however, the iron lineenergy is close to where the disc and tail have equal fluxes, so using abroader disc continuum changes the residual 'iron line' profile dramatically.with a broader disc continuum model, the inferred line is formed outside of 30${\rm{r_g}}$, so cannot constrain black hole spin. we caution that a robustdetermination of black hole spin from the iron line profile is very difficultwhere the disc makes a significant contribution at the iron line energy i.e. inmost bright black hole states.

1106.1294	searching for the trigger of the agn qpo: 8 years of re j1034+396	re j1034+396 is one of the most extreme narrow-line seyfert 1s detected thusfar, showing the only quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) reliably detected in anactive galactic nucleus (agn). comparison with similar spectral and timingproperties observed in the black hole x-ray binary (bhb) grs 1915+105 suggeststhat re j1034+396 is a super-eddington accretor. a more complete understandingof the behaviour of re j1034+396 can therefore lead to a unification of theaccretion physics between such extreme agn and super-eddington bhbs. here wereport on our latest xmm-newton observations of re j1034+396, which no longershow the qpo, indicating that this source shows a non-stationarypower-spectrum. we use spectral and temporal analysis across all fivexmm-newton observations of the source to probe the evolution of the object. thecombination of the shape of the fractional variability with energy and theinferred velocity of absorbing material in the line-of-sight rules out anabsorption-only method of creating the qpo. instead the periodically changingabsorption may be produced by the qpo causing a change in ionization state. weextend our analysis by including the covariance spectra which give much bettersignal to noise than an rms spectrum. these reveal a new aspect of the qpo,which is that there is also a small contribution from a soft component which ishotter than the soft excess seen in the mean spectrum. folding the lightcurveon the qpo period shows that this component lags behind the hard x-rays. ifthis is due to re-processing then the lag corresponding to a light travel timeacross 30 r_g. some of the remaining observations have similar energy spectraand covariance spectra, but none of them show a significant qpo, so we concludethat none of these features are the trigger for the appearance of the qpo inthis object.

1107.5429	intrinsic disc emission and the soft x-ray excess in agn	(abridged) narrow line seyfert 1 (nls1) galaxies have low mass black holesand mass accretion rates close to (or exceeding) eddington, so a standardblackbody accretion disc should peak in the euv. however, the lack of trueabsorption opacity in the disc means that the emission is better approximatedby a colour temperature corrected blackbody, and this colour temperaturecorrection is large enough ($\sim 2.4$) that the bare disc emission from a zerospin black hole can extend into the soft x-ray bandpass. part of the soft x-rayexcess seen in these objects must be intrinsic emission from the disc unlessthe vertical structure is very different to that predicted.  however, the soft excess is much broader than predicted by a bare discspectrum, indicating some compton upscattering by cool, optically thickmaterial. we associate this with the disc itself, so it must ultimately bepowered by mass accretion. we build an energetically self consistent modelassuming that the emission thermalises at large radii, but that at smallerradii the gravitational energy is split between powering optically thickcomptonised disc emission (forming the soft x-ray excess) and an optically thincorona above the disc (forming the tail to higher energies). we show examplesof this model fit to the extreme nls1 rej1034+396, and to the much lowereddington fraction broad line seyfert 1 pg1048+231. we use these to guide ourfits and interpretations of three template spectra made from co-adding multiplesources to track out a sequence of agn spectra as a function of $l/l_{edd}$.  the new model is publically available within the {\sc xspec} spectral fittingpackage.

1108.0789	modelling variability in black hole binaries: linking simulations to  observations	black hole accretion flows show rapid x-ray variability. the power spectraldensity (psd) of this is typically fit by a phenomenological model of multiplelorentzians for both the broad band noise and quasi-periodic oscillations(qpos). our previous paper (ingram &amp; done 2011) developed the first physicalmodel for the psd and fit this to observational data. this was based on thesame truncated disc/hot inner flow geometry which can explain the correlatedproperties of the energy spectra. this assumes that the broad band noise isfrom propagating fluctuations in mass accretion rate within the hot flow, whilethe qpo is produced by global lense-thirring precession of the same hot flow.  here we develop this model, making some significant improvements. firstly wespecify that the viscous frequency (equivalently, surface density) in the hotflow has the same form as that measured from numerical simulations ofprecessing, tilted accretion flows. secondly, we refine the statisticaltechniques which we use to fit the model to the data. we re-analyse the psdfrom the 1998 rise to outburst of xte j1550-564 with our new model in order toassess the impact of these changes. we find that the derived outer radii of thehot flow (set by the inner radius of the truncated disc) are rather similar,changing from ~68-13 rg throughout the outburst rise. however, the morephysical assumptions of our new model also allow us to constrain the scaleheight of the flow. this decreases as the outer radius of the flow decreases,as expected from the spectral evolution. the spectrum steepens in response tothe increased cooling as the as the truncation radius sweeps in, so gaspressure support for the flow decreases.  the new model, propfluc, is publically available within the xspec spectralfitting package.

1111.1188	the missing link: a low mass x-ray binary in m31 seen as an  ultraluminous x-ray source	a new, transient ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx) was recently discovered bychandra in m31 with a luminosity at ~ 5 x 10^39 erg/s. here we analyse a seriesof five subsequent xmm-newton observations. the steady decline in x-rayluminosity over 1.5 months gives an observed e-fold timescale of ~40 days;similar to the decay timescales seen in soft x-ray transients in our owngalaxy. this supports the interpretation of this ulx as a stellar mass blackhole in a low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb), accreting at super eddington rates.this is further supported by the lack of detection of an o/b star in quiescenceand the xmm-newton spectral data being dominated by a disc-like componentrather than the power-law expected from a sub-eddington intermediate-mass blackhole.  these data give the best sequence of high eddington fraction spectra everassembled due to the combination of low absorption column to m31 and wellcalibrated bandpass down to 0.3 kev of xmm-newton. the spectra can be roughlydescribed by our best current disc model, bhspec, assuming a 10 m_solar blackhole with best fit spin of ~0.4. however, the data are better described by atwo component model, where the disc emission is significantly affected byadvection, and with an additional low temperature comptonisation component athigh energies. this could simply indicate the limitations of current discmodels, though the energy-dependent variability also weakly supports a twocomponent interpretation of the data.  irrespective of the detailed interpretation of the spectral properties, thesedata support the presence of accretion onto a stellar mass black hole in a lmxbaccreting in the eddington-regime. this allows an unambiguous connection ofthis object, and, by extension, similar low luminosity ulxs, to `standard'x-ray binaries.

1205.0599	the truncated disk from suzaku data of gx 339-4 in the extreme very high  state	we report on the geometry of accretion disk and high energy coronae in thestrong comptonization state (the very high/steep power law/hard intermediatestate) based on a suzaku observation of the famous galactic black hole gx339-4. these data were taken just before the peak of the 2006-2007 outburst,and the average x-ray luminosity in the 0.7-200 kev band is estimated to be2.9e38 erg/s for a distance of 8 kpc. we fit the spectrum with both simple(independent disk and corona) and sophisticated (energetically coupled disk andcorona) models, but all fits imply that the underlying optically thick disk istruncated significantly before the innermost stable circular orbit around theblack hole. we show this directly by a comparison with similarly broadband datafrom a disk dominated spectrum at almost the same luminosity observed byxmm-newton and rxte 3 days after the suzaku observation.  during the suzaku observation, the qpo frequency changes from 4.3 hz to 5.5hz, while the spectrum softens. the energetically coupled model gives acorresponding 5+/- 8 % decrease in derived inner radius of the disk. while thisis not significant, it is consistent with the predicted change in qpo frequencyfrom lense-thirring precession of the hot flow interior to the disk and/or adeformation mode of this flow, as a higher qpo frequency implies a smaller sizescale for the corona. this is consistent with the truncated disk extendingfurther inwards towards the black hole.

1207.6984	jets and the accretion flow in low luminosity black holes	the x-ray spectra of black hole binaries in the low/hard state first hardenas the flux decreases, then soften. this change in behaviour has been variouslyattributed to either the x-rays switching from being produced in the flow tobeing dominated by the jet, or to the flow switching seed photons from the discto self generated seed photons from cyclo-synchrotron. here we build a simpletruncated disc, hot inner flow, plus standard conical synchrotron jet model toexplore what this predicts for the x-ray emission mechanism as a function ofmass accretion rate.  we find that the change in x-ray spectral index can be quantitatively (notjust qualitatively) explained by the seed photon switch in the hot flow i.e.this supports models where the x-rays are always produced by the hot flow. bycontrast, standard conical jet models are as radiatively inefficient as the hotflow so there is no transition in x-ray production mechanism with $\dot{m}$.including the effects of electron cooling allows the jet x-rays to drop moreslowly with accretion rate and hence overtake the x-rays from the hot flow,however this produces a corresponding change in the radio-x-ray correlation,which is not observed. we argue that the unbroken radio-x-ray correlation downto quiescence rules out the jet transition model as an explanation for thetrend in x-ray spectral index.  our favoured model is then a truncated disc with an inner, hot, radiativelyinefficient flow which always dominates the hard x-rays, coupled to a conicalsynchrotron jet which produces the radio emission. however, even this hasissues at low $\dot{m}$ as the low optical depth and high temperature of theflow means that the compton spectrum is not well approximated by a power law.this shows the need for a more sophisticated model for the electrondistribution in the hot flow.

1208.0728	the effect of frame dragging on the iron k alpha line in x-ray binaries	the clear characteristic timescale picked out by the low frequencyquasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) seen in many black hole and neutron starbinaries has the potential to provide a very powerful diagnostic of the innerregions of the accretion flow. however, this potential cannot be realisedwithout a quantitative model for the qpo. we have recently shown that the sametruncated disc/hot inner flow geometry which is used to interpret the spectraltransitions can also directly produce the qpo from lense-thirring (vertical)precession of the hot inner flow. this correctly predicts both the frequencyand spectrum of the qpo, and the tight correlation of these properties with thetotal spectrum of the source via a changing truncation radius between the discand hot flow. this model predicts a unique iron line signature as a verticallytilted flow illuminates different azimuths of the disc as it precesses. theiron line arising from this rotating illumination is blue shifted when the flowirradiates the approaching region of the spinning disc and red shifted when theflow irradiates the receding region of the disc. this gives rise to acharacteristic rocking of the iron line on the qpo frequency which is anecessary (and probably sufficient) test of a lense-thirring origin. this isalso an independent test of disc truncation models for the low/hard state, asvertical precession cannot occur if there is a disc in the midplane.  we show that it may be possible to observe this effect using archival datafrom the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) or xmm newton. however, a cleantest requires a combination of moderate resolution and good statistics, such aswould be available from a long xmm-newton observation or with data from theproposed esa mission loft.

1212.4698	bright radio emission from an ultraluminous stellar-mass microquasar in  m31	a subset of ultraluminous x-ray sources (those with luminosities &lt; 10^40erg/s) are thought to be powered by the accretion of gas onto black holes withmasses of ~5-20 m_solar, probably via an accretion disc. the x-ray and radioemission are coupled in such galactic sources, with the radio emissionoriginating in a relativistic jet thought to be launched from the innermostregions near the black hole, with the most powerful emission occurring when therate of infalling matter approaches a theoretical maximum (the eddingtonlimit). only four such maximal sources are known in the milky way, and theabsorption of soft x-rays in the interstellar medium precludes determining thecausal sequence of events that leads to the ejection of the jet. here we reportradio and x-ray observations of a bright new x-ray source whose peak luminositycan exceed 10^39 erg/s in the nearby galaxy, m31. the radio luminosity isextremely high and shows variability on a timescale of tens of minutes, arguingthat the source is highly compact and powered by accretion close to theeddington limit onto a stellar mass black hole. continued radio and x-raymonitoring of such sources should reveal the causal relationship between theaccretion flow and the powerful jet emission.

1304.1968	evidence for a cool disk and inhomogeneous coronae from wide-band  temporal spectroscopy of cygnus x-1 with suzaku	unified x-ray spectral and timing studies of cygnus x-1 in the low/hard andhard intermediate state were conducted in a model-independent manner, usingbroadband suzaku data acquired on 25 occasions from 2005 to 2009 with a totalexposure of ~ 450 ks. the unabsorbed 0.1--500 kev source luminosity changedover 0.8--2.8% of the eddington limit for 14.8 solar masses. variations onshort (1--2 seconds) and long (days to months) time scales require at leastthree separate components: a constant component localized below ~2 kev, a broadsoft one dominating in the 2--10 kev range, and a hard one mostly seen in10--300 kev range. in view of the truncated disk/hot inner flow picture, theseare respectively interpreted as emission from the truncated cool disk, a softcompton component, and a hard compton component. long-term spectral evolutioncan be produced by the constant disk increasing in temperature and luminosityas the truncation radius decreases. the soft compton component likewiseincreases, but the hard compton does not, so that the spectrum in the hardintermediate state is dominated by the soft compton component; on the otherhand, the hard compton component dominates the spectrum in the dim low/hardstate, probably associated with a variable soft emission providing seed photonsfor the comptonization.

1306.2307	the hot and energetic universe: a white paper presenting the science  theme motivating the athena+ mission	this white paper, submitted to the recent esa call for science themes todefine its future large missions, advocates the need for a transformationalleap in our understanding of two key questions in astrophysics: 1) how doesordinary matter assemble into the large scale structures that we see today? 2)how do black holes grow and shape the universe? hot gas in clusters, groups andthe intergalactic medium dominates the baryonic content of the local universe.to understand the astrophysical processes responsible for the formation andassembly of these large structures, it is necessary to measure their physicalproperties and evolution. this requires spatially resolved x-ray spectroscopywith a factor 10 increase in both telescope throughput and spatial resolvingpower compared to currently planned facilities. feedback from supermassiveblack holes is an essential ingredient in this process and in most galaxyevolution models, but it is not well understood. x-ray observations canuniquely reveal the mechanisms launching winds close to black holes anddetermine the coupling of the energy and matter flows on larger scales. due tothe effects of feedback, a complete understanding of galaxy evolution requiresknowledge of the obscured growth of supermassive black holes through cosmictime, out to the redshifts where the first galaxies form. x-ray emission is themost reliable way to reveal accreting black holes, but deep survey speed mustimprove by a factor ~100 over current facilities to perform a full census intothe early universe. the advanced telescope for high energy astrophysics(athena+) mission provides the necessary performance (e.g. angular resolution,spectral resolution, survey grasp) to address these questions and revolutionizeour understanding of the hot and energetic universe. these capabilities willalso provide a powerful observatory to be used in all areas of astrophysics.

0801.1587	on why the iron k-shell absorption in agn is not a signature of the  local warm/hot intergalactic medium	we present a comparison between the 2001 xmm-newton and 2005 suzakuobservations of the quasar, pg1211+143 at z=0.0809. variability is observed inthe 7 kev iron k-shell absorption line (at 7.6 kev in the quasar frame), whichis significantly weaker in 2005 than during the 2001 xmm-newton observation.from a recombination timescale of &lt;4 years, this implies an absorber densityn&gt;0.004 particles/cm3, while the absorber column is 5e22&lt;n_h &lt;1 1e24particles/cm2. thus the sizescale of the absorber is too compact (pc scale) andthe surface brightness of the dense gas too high (by 9-10 orders of magnitude)to arise from local hot gas, such as the local bubble, group or warm/hotintergalactic medium (whim), as suggested by mckernan et al. (2004, 2005).instead the iron k-shell absorption must be associated with an agn outflow withmildly relativistic velocities. finally we show that the the association of theabsorption in pg1211+143 with local hot gas is simply a coincidence, thecomparison between the recession and iron k absorber outflow velocities inother agn does not reveal a one to one kinematic correlation.

1306.4786	a new way to measure supermassive black hole spin in accretion disc  dominated active galaxies	we show that disc continuum fitting can be used to constrain black hole spinin a subclass of narrow line seyfert 1 (nls1) agn as their low mass and highmass accretion rate means that the disc peaks at energies just below the softx-ray bandpass. we apply the technique to the nls1 pg1244+026, where theoptical/uv/x-ray spectrum is consistent with being dominated by a standard disccomponent. this gives a best estimate for black hole spin which is low, with afirm upper limit of $a_*&lt;0.86$. this contrasts with the recent x-raydeterminations of (close to) maximal black hole spin in other nls1 based onrelativistic smearing of the iron profile. while our data on pg1244+026 doesnot have sufficient statistics at high energy to give a good measure of blackhole spin from the iron line profile, cosmological simulations predict thatblack holes with similar masses have similar growth histories and so shouldhave similar spins. this suggests that there is a problem either in ourunderstanding of disc spectra, or/and x-ray reflection or/and the evolution ofblack hole spin.

1307.4396	an imperfect double: probing the physical origin of the low-frequency  qpo and its harmonic in black hole binaries	we extract the spectra of the strong low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation(qpo) and its harmonic during the rising phase of an outburst in the black-holebinary xte j1550-564. we compare these frequency resolved spectra to thetime-averaged spectrum and the spectrum of the rapid (&lt;0.1s) variability. thespectrum of the time averaged emission can be described by a disc, a comptonupscattered tail, and its reflection. the qpo spectrum contains no detectabledisc, and the compton spectrum is generally harder than in the time averagedemission, and shows less reflection, making it very similar to the spectrum ofthe rapid variability. the harmonic likewise contains no detectable disccomponent, but has a compton spectrum which is systematically softer than theqpo, softer even than the compton tail in the time averaged emission. weinterpret these results in the context of the lense-thirring model for the qpo,where a precessing hot flow replaces the inner disc, and the harmonic isproduced by the angular dependence of compton scattering within the hot flow.we extend these models to include stratification of the hot flow, so that it issofter (lower optical depth) at larger radii closer to the truncated disc, andharder (higher optical depth) in the innermost parts of the flow where therapid variability is produced. the different optical depth with radius givesrise to different angular dependence of the comptonised emission, weighting thefundamental to the inner parts of the hot flow, and the harmonic to the outer.this is the first model which can explain both the spectrum of the qpo and itsharmonic in a self consistent geometry.

0801.2382	a deep 0.3-10 kev spectrum of the h$_{2}$o maser galaxy ic 2560	we present a new xmm-newton spectrum of the seyfert 2 nucleus of ic 2560,which hosts h$_{2}$o maser emission from an inclined keplerian accretion disk.the x-ray spectrum shows soft excess due to multi-temperature ionized plasma, ahard continuum and strong emission features, from mg, si, s, ca, fe and ni,mainly due to fluorescence. it is consistent with reflection of the continuumfrom a mostly neutral medium and obscuration due to a high column density, $&gt;$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. the amplitude of the reflected component may exceed 10% ofthe central unobscured luminosity. this is higher than the reflected fraction,of a few percent, observed in other seyfert 2 sources like ngc 4945. we observean emission line at 6.7 kev, possibly due to fexxv, undetected in previouschandra observations. the absorption column density associated with this lineis less than 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, lower than the obscuration of the centralsource. we hypothesize that this highly ionized fe line emission originates inwarm gas, also responsible for a scattered component of continuum emission thatmay dominate the spectrum between 1 and 3 kev. we compare x-ray and maseremission characteristics of ic 2560 and other agn that exhibit water maseremission originating in disk structures around central engines. the temperaturefor the region of the disk associated with maser action is consistent with theexpected 400-1000k range. the clumpiness of disk structures (inferred from themaser distribution) may depend on the unobscured luminosities of the centralengines.

0801.3315	suzaku results on cygnus x-1 in the low/hard state	the black-hole binary cygnus x-1 was observed for 17 ks with the suzaku x-rayobservatory in 2005 october, while it was in a low/hard state with a 0.7-300kev luminosity of 4.6 x 10^37 erg/s. the xis and hxd spectra, spanning 0.7-400kev, were reproduced successfully incorporating a cool accretion disk and a hotcomptonizing corona. the corona is characterized by an electron temperature of~100 kev, and two optical depths of ~0.4 and ~1.5 which account for the harderand softer continua, respectively. the disk has the innermost temperature of~0.2 kev, and is thought to protrude half way into the corona. the disk notonly provides seed photons to the compton cloud, but also produces a softspectral excess, a mild reflection hump, and a weakly broadened iron line. acomparison with the suzaku data on gro j1655-40 reveals several interestingspectral differences, which can mostly be attributed to inclination effectsassuming that the disk has a flat geometry while the corona is grosslyspherical. an intensity-sorted spectroscopy indicates that the continuumbecomes less comptonized when the source flares up on times scales of 1-200 s,while the underlying disk remains unchanged.

1309.5875	a long xmm-newton observation of an extreme narrow line seyfert 1: pg  1244+026	we explore the origin of the strong soft x-ray excess in narrow line seyfert1 galaxies using spectral-timing information from a 120ks {\it xmm-newton}observation of pg 1244+026. spectral fitting alone cannot distinguish between atrue additional soft x-ray continuum component and strongly relativisticallysmeared reflection, but both models also require a separate soft blackbodycomponent. this is most likely intrinsic emission from the disc extending intothe lowest energy x-ray bandpass. the {\it rms} spectra on short timescales(200-5000s) contain both (non-disk) soft excess and power law emission.however, the spectrum of the variability on these timescales correlated withthe 4-10 kev lightcurve contains only the power law. together these show thatthere is fast variability of the soft excess which is independent of the 4-10kev variability. this is inconsistent with a single reflection component makingthe soft x-ray excess as this necessarily produces correlated variability inthe 4-10 kev bandpass. instead, the {\it rms} and covariance spectra areconsistent with an additional cool comptonisation component which does notcontribute to the spectrum above 2 kev.

1311.4320	what powers the most relativistic jets? i: bl lacs	the dramatic relativistic jets pointing directly at us in bl lac objects canbe well modelled by bulk motion beaming of synchrotron self-compton emissionpowered by a low eddington fraction accretion flow. nearly 500 of these agn areseen in the 2nd fermi large area telescope catalogue of agn. we combine the jetmodels which describe individual spectra with the expected jet parameterscalings with mass and mass accretion rate to predict the expected number offermi detected sources given the number densities of agn from cosmologicalsimulations. we select only sources with eddington scaled mass accretion rate$&lt; 0.01$ (i.e. radiatively inefficient flows), and include cooling, orientationeffects, and the effects of absorption from pair production on theextragalactic ir background.  these models overpredict the number of fermi detected bl lacs by a factor of1000! this clearly shows that one of the underlying assumptions is incorrect,almost certainly that jets do not scale simply with mass and accretion rate.the most plausible additional parameter which can affect the region producingthe fermi emission is black hole spin. we can reproduce the observed numbers ofbl lacs if such relativistic jets are only produced by the highest spin($a_*&gt;0.8$) black holes, in agreement with the longstanding spin-jet paradigm.this also requires that high spins are intrinsically rare, as predicted by thecosmological simulations for growing black hole mass via chaotic (randomlyaligned) accretion episodes, where only the most massive black holes have highspin due to black hole-black hole mergers.

1311.5165	x-ray time delays in the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy pg 1244+026	we analyse the x-ray time-lags in the narrow line seyfert 1 (nls1) galaxy pg1244+026 ($m_{\rm bh}\sim 10^7 m_{\rm sun}$, $l/l_{\rm edd}\sim 1$). the timedelay between the soft (0.3--0.7~kev) and harder (1.2--4.0~kev) variationsshows shows the well established switch from hard lags at low frequencies tosoft lags at high frequencies. the low frequency hard lags are qualitativelyconsistent with the propagation of fluctuations model, with some long-timescaleresponse of the reflection component. the high frequency soft lag appears toextend over a wide frequency band, that we divide this into two narrowfrequency ranges, and examine the lag as a function of energy for each ofthese. at high frequencies the soft excess emission is delayed with respect tothe harder energy bands, without any corresponding strong, hard x-rayreflection signature. at even higher frequencies a soft lag is seen at thesoftest energies, as well as tentative evidence for an iron k$\alpha$reverberation signal. these results point to the importance of reprocessing aswell as reflection in determining the lags in nls1s.

1403.2929	a physical model for the x-ray time lags of narrow line seyfert type 1  active galactic nuclei	we study the origin of the soft x-ray excess seen in the 'simple' narrow lineseyfert 1 galaxy pg1244+026 using all available spectral-timing information.this object shows the standard switch between soft leading the hard band onlong timescales, to the opposite behaviour on short timescales. this isinterpreted as a combination of intrinsic fluctuations propagating down throughthe accretion flow giving the soft lead, together with reflection of the hardx-rays giving the soft lag. we build a full model of the spectral and timevariability including both propagation and reflection, and compare our modelwith the observed power spectra, coherence, covariance, lag-frequency andlag-energy spectra. we compare models based on a separate soft excess componentwith those based on reflection dominated soft emission.  reflection dominated spectra have difficulty reproducing the soft lead at lowfrequency since reflection will always lag. they also suffer from highcoherence and nearly identical hard and soft band power spectra in disagreementwith the observations. this is a direct result of the power law and reflectioncomponents both contributing to the hard and soft energy bands, and the smallradii over which the relativistically smeared reflection is producedtransmitting too much high frequency power into the soft band.  conversely, we find the separate soft excess models (where the inner discradius is $&gt;6r_g$) have difficulty reproducing the soft lag at high frequency,as reflected flux does not contribute enough signal to overwhelm the soft lead.however, reflection should also be accompanied by reprocessing and this shouldadd to the soft excess at low energies. this model can quantitatively reproducethe switch from soft lead to soft lag seen in the data and reproduces well theobserved power spectra and other timing features which reflection dominatedmodels cannot.

0803.0584	angular momentum transport in accretion disks and its implications for  spin estimates in black hole binaries	the accretion flow in the disk dominated state of black hole binaries haspeak temperature and luminosity which vary together in such a way as toindicate an approximately constant emitting area. the association of this withthe last stable orbit gives one of the few ways to estimate spin when the massof the black hole is known. however, deriving this radius requires knowledge ofhow the disk spectrum is modified by radiative transfer through the verticalstructure of the disk, as well as special and general relativistic effects onthe propagation of this radiation. here we investigate the extent to whichdifferences in vertical structure change the derived disk spectra bycalculating these for a range of different stress prescriptions. we find thatat a given mass accretion rate the spectra are almost identical for accretionrates of l/l_edd &lt;~ 0.1. the spectra are remarkably similar even up to thehighest luminosities considered (l/l_edd ~ 0.6) as long as the stresses do notdissipate more than about 10 per cent of the gravitational energy above theeffective photosphere. this is exceeded only by classic alpha disks with alpha&gt;~ 0.1, but these models give spectral variation which is incompatible withexisting data. therefore, we conclude that disk spectral modelling can placeinteresting constraints on angular momentum transport, but still provide arobust estimate of the spin of the black hole.

1405.2762	scaling accretion flow models from bhb to agn - why doesn't it work?	black holes depend only on mass and spin, while what we see from theaccretion flow in steady state depends also on mass accretion rate and (weakly)inclination. hence we should be able to scale the accretion flow propertiesfrom the stellar to the supermassive black holes. but the data show significantdifferences between these two types of systems, suggesting that we are missingsome crucial physics in agn. one of these differences is the soft x-ray excesswhich is seen ubiquitously in bright agn, but only occasionally in bhb. anotheris the much faster variability seen in the high energy tail of high massaccretion rate agn compared to that seen in the tail of bhb. we show that whilethis variability is not understood, it can be used via the new spectral-timingtechniques to constrain the nature of the soft x-ray excess. the coherence,lag-frequency and lag-energy results strongly support this being an additionallow temperature comptonisation component rather than extreme relativisticallysmeared reflection in the 'simple' narrow line seyfert 1 pg1244+026.

1410.1640	the origin of ultra-fast outflows in agn: monte-carlo simulations of the  wind in pds 456	ultra-fast outflows (ufos) are seen in many agn, giving a possible mode foragn feedback onto the host galaxy. however, the mechanism(s) for the launch andacceleration of these outflows are currently unknown, with uv line drivingapparently strongly disfavoured as the material along the line of sight is sohighly ionised that it has no uv transitions. we revisit this issue using thesuzaku x-ray data from pds 456, an agn with the most powerful ufo seen in thelocal universe. we explore conditions in the wind by developing a new 3-dmonte-carlo code for radiation transport. the code only handles highly ionisedions, but the data show the ionisation state of the wind is high enough thatthis is appropriate, and this restriction makes it fast enough to exploreparameter space. we reproduce the results of earlier work, confirming that themass loss rate in the wind is around 30% of the inferred inflow rate throughthe outer disc. we show for the first time that uv line driving is likely to bea major contribution to the wind acceleration. the mass loss rate in the windmatches that predicted from a purely line driven system, and this uv absorptioncan take place out of the line of sight. continuum driving should also play arole as the source is close to eddington. this predicts that the most extremeoutflows will be produced from the highest mass accretion rate flows onto highmass black holes, as observed.

1411.6425	complex narrow line seyfert 1s: high spin or high inclination?	complex narrow line seyfert 1s (nls1s), such as 1h0707-495, differ fromsimple nls1s like pg1244+026 by showing stronger broad spectral features at fek and larger amplitude flux variability. these are correlated: the strongest fek features are seen during deep dips in the light curves of complex nls1s.there are two competing explanations for these features, one where a compactx-ray source on the spin axis of a highly spinning black hole approaches thehorizon and the consequent strong relativistic effects focus the intrinsic fluxonto the inner edge of a thin disc, giving a dim, reflection dominatedspectrum. the other is that the deep dips are caused by complex absorption byclumps close to the hard x-ray source. the reflection dominated model is ableto reproduce the very short 30s soft lag from reverberation seen in the complexnls1 1h0707-495. however, it does not explain the characteristic switch to hardlags on longer timescales. instead, a full model of propagating fluctuationscoupled to reverberation can explain the switch in the simple nls1 pg1244+026using a low spin black hole. however pg1244+026 has a longer reverberation lagof $\sim 200$s.  here we extend the successful propagation-reverberation model for the simplenls1 pg1244+026 to include the effect of absorption from clumps in a turbulentregion above the disk. the resulting occultations of the inner accretion flowcan introduce additional hard lags when relativistic effects are taken intoaccount. this dilutes the soft lag from reverberation and shifts it to higherfrequencies, making a smooth transition between the 200s lags seen in simplenls1s to the 30s lags in complex nls1s. these two classes of nls1 could then bedetermined by inclination angle with respect to a clumpy, probably turbulent,failed wind structure on the disc.

1504.06190	the best constraints on a super-eddington accretion flow: xmm-newton  observations of an intermediate-mass black hole	rx j1140.1+0307 (hereafter rx1140) is a narrow line seyfert 1 (nls1) with oneof the lowest black hole masses known in an agn (m ${\le} 10^6$ m$_{\odot}$).we show results from two new {\it xmm-newton} observations, showing soft2-10~kev spectra, a strong excess at lower energies, and fast x-ray variabilityas is typical of this class. the soft excess can be equally well fit by eitherlow temperature comptonisation or highly smeared, ionised reflection models,but we use a covariance analysis of the fast x-ray variability as well as lagand coherence spectra to show that the low temperature comptonisation modelgives a better description of the break in variability properties between softand hard x-rays. both models also require an additional component at thesoftest energies, as expected from the accretion disc. however, this inner discspectrum does not join smoothly onto the variable optical and far uv emission(which should be produced in the outer disc) unless the mass is underestimatedby an order of magnitude. the variable optical and far uv emission insteadsuggests that $l/l_{edd}\sim 10$ through the outer disc, in which caseadvection and/or wind losses are required to explain the observed broadbandspectral energy distribution. however, the similarity of the x-ray propertiesof rx1140 to other simple nls1 such as pg 1244+026, re j1034+396 and rx~j0136means it is likely that these are also super-eddington sources. this meanstheir spectral energy distribution cannot be used to determine black hole spindespite appearing to be disc dominated. it also means that the accretiongeometry close to the black hole is unlikely to be a flat disc as assumed inthe new x-ray reverberation mapping techniques.

1507.05564	minimum x-ray source size for a lamp-post corona in light-bending models  for agn	the lamppost model is often used to describe the x-ray source geometry inagn, where an infinitesimal point source is located on the black hole spinaxis. this is especially invoked for narrow line seyfert 1 (nls1) galaxies,where an extremely broad iron line seen in episodes of low x-ray flux can bothbe explained by extremely strong relativistic effects as the source approachesthe black hole horizon. the most extreme spectrum seen from the nls1 1h0707-495requires that the source is less than 1rg above the event horizon in thisgeometry. however, the source must also be large enough to intercept sufficientseed photons from the disk to make the hard x-ray compton continuum whichproduces the observed iron line/reflected spectrum. we use a fully relativisticray tracing code to show that this implies that the source must besubstantially larger than 1rg in 1h0707-495 if the disk is the source of seedphotons. hence the source cannot fit as close as 1rg to the horizon, so theobserved spectrum and variability are not formed purely by effects of stronggravity but probably also by changes in corona and inner accretion flowgeometry.

0807.1899	a ~1-hour x-ray periodicity in an active galaxy re j1034+396	active galactic nuclei and quasars are thought to be scaled up versions ofgalactic black hole binaries, powered by accretion onto supermassive blackholes with masses of 10^6-10^9 m_sun, as opposed to the ~10 m_sun in binaries.one example of the similarities between these two types of systems is thecharacteristic rapid x-ray variability seen from the accretion flow. the powerspectrum of this variability in black hole binaries consists of a broad,band-limited noise with multiple quasi-periodic oscillations superimposed,where power is concentrated over a narrow range of frequencies. although thebroad noise component has been observed in many active galactic nuclei, thereare no significant detections of quasi-periodic oscillations. here we reportthe discovery of a ~1h x-ray periodicity in a bright active galaxy rej1034+396. the signal is highly statistically significant (at the 5.6 sigmalevel) and very coherent, with quality factor q &gt; 16. this reinforces the linkbetween stellar and supermassive black holes, emphasizing the universalproperties of accretion onto objects with very different masses. the x-raymodulation arises from the direct vicinity of the black hole, so this providesa new tool for studying active galactic nuclei.

astro-ph;0102167	mapping the inner accretion disk of the galactic black hole j1550-564  through its rise to outburst	we study the spectral properties of the first 14 observations of the rise tooutburst phase of the x-ray transient j1550-564. using the pca and hexteinstruments, we find that the 3-200 kev spectra smoothly pass from a standardlow/hard state to a very high state. the classic high state is neverencountered possibly indicating that it is not a phenomenon of the rise phase.we find that the individual pca spectra can be fitted adequately by a diskblack body and a thermal comptonization model which includes reflection. oncethe very high state is reached there is clear spectral curvature of thecontinuum which possibly indicates the presence of a compositethermal/non-thermal plasma. detailed modelling of the reflection parametersshows a sharp increase in mean ionization at the onset of the transitionbetween the low state and very high state. there is a related variability inthe reflected fraction but its exact value depends on the continuum model used.we can constrain the inner radius using relativistic smearing and while thereare large uncertainties, the data are incompatible with a disk extending to thelast stable orbit in either state. since the system is on the rise to outburst,the disk instability models strongly imply that there is no standard inner diskat the time the low state spectrum is observed. this is compatible with atruncated disk, filled by an x-ray hot, advection dominated accretion flow.however, magnetic flares above the outbursting disk can also match the observedspectra once the effects of either outflow and/or strong photoionization of thesurface of the disk are included.

astro-ph;0111310	phase-resolved x-ray spectroscopy of the millisecond pulsar sax  j1808.4-3658	we present new results based on rxte observations of sax j1808.4-3658. thex-ray spectrum can be fitted by a two-component model. we interpret the softcomponent as blackbody emission from a heated spot on the neutron star, and thehard component as coming from comptonization in plasma heated by the accretionshock as the material collimated by the magnetic field impacts onto the neutronstar surface. the hotspot is probably the source of seed photons forcomptonization. the hard component illuminates the disc, giving rise to areflected spectrum. the inferred evolution of the inner radius is notconsistent with the magnetic field truncating the disc. instead it seems morelikely that the inner disc radius is set by some much longer time-scaleprocess, most probably connected to the overall evolution of the accretiondisc. this disc truncation mechanism would then have to be generic in all lowmass accretion rate flows both in disc accreting neutron stars and black holesystems. the phase resolved spectra show clearly that the blackbody and hardcomptonized spectra pulse independently. this obviously gives an energydependent phase lag. full general relativistic effects are not required toexplain this. we do not detect compton reflection from the neutron starsurface, though we predict that it should be present in the x-ray spectrum.this would give an unambiguous observational measure of m/r if there is anyiron on the neutron star surface which is not completely ionized.

astro-ph;0111378	a comment on the colour-colour diagrams of low mass x-ray binaries	disc accreting neutron stars come in two distinct varieties, atolls and zsources, named after their differently shaped tracks on a colour-colour diagramas the source luminosity changes. here we present analysis of three transientatoll sources showing that there is an additional branch in the colour-colourdiagram of atoll sources which appears at very low luminosities. this newbranch connects to the top of previously known c-shaped (atoll) path, forming ahorizontal track where the average source flux decrease from right to left.this turns the c-shape into a z. thus both atolls and z sources share the sametopology on the colour-colour diagram, and evolve in similar way as a functionof increasing averaged mass accretion rate. this strongly favours models inwhich the underlying geometry of these sources changes in similar ways. apossible scenario is one where the truncated disc approaches the neutron starwhen the accretion rate increases, but that in the atolls the disc is truncatedby evaporation (similarly to black holes) whereas in the z sources it istruncated by the magnetic field.

astro-ph;0209113	another interpretation of the power-law type spectrum of an  ultraluminous compact x-ray source in ic 342	the ultraluminous compact x-ray sources (ulxs) generally show a curvingspectrum in the 0.7--10 kev asca bandpass, which looks like a high temperatureanalogue of the disk dominated high/soft state spectra seen in galactic blackhole binaries (bhbs) at high mass accretion rates. several ulxs have been seento vary, and to make a transition at their lowest luminosity to a spectrumwhich looks more like a power law. these have been previously interpreted asthe analogue of the power law dominated low/hard state in galactic bhbs.however, the ulx luminosity at which the transition occurs must be at least10--50 per cent of the eddington limit assuming that their highest luminosityphase corresponds to the eddington limit, while for the galactic bhbs thehigh/soft--low/hard transition occurs at a few per cent of the eddington limit.here we show that the apparently power law spectrum in a ulx in ic342 can beequally well fit over the asca bandpass by a strongly comptonised opticallythick accretion disk with the maximum temperature of ~1 kev. recent work on thegalactic bhbs has increasingly shown that such components are common at highmass accretion rates, and that this often characterises the very high (oranomalous) state. thus we propose that the power law type ulx spectra are notto be identified with the low/hard state, but rather represent thecomptonisation dominated very high/anomalous state in the galactic bhbs.

astro-ph;0301383	simultaneous chandra and rxte observations of the nearby bright seyfert  2 galaxy ngc4945	we analyze recent simultaneous chandra/rxte observations of the seyfert 2galaxy ngc 4945. the unprecedented spatial resolution of chandra means we areable to separate the spectra of the nucleus, starburst and superwind regions,while the rxte data extend the spectrum to higher energies. the extremeabsorbing column of $n_h\sim 4\times 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ means that the nucleusis only seen directly above 8--10 kev, while the lower energy spectrum from thenuclear region in chandra is dominated by reflection. by contrast, thesuperwind is dominated by emission from hot plasma, but the starburst regioncontains both hot plasma and reflection signatures. to form a reflectedspectrum requires that the starburst region contains clumps of cool, opticallythick material, perhaps star forming cores, which are irradiated by 7--10 kevphotons from the nucleus. since photons of this energy are obscured along theline sight then this confirms the result of madejski et al. (2000) that theextreme absorbtion material is disk-like rather than a torus. however, their/optical limits on the lack of high excitation emission lines show that bycontrast the lower energy photons from the nucleus are obscured in alldirections. we discuss the complex absorption structure revealed by theseobservations, and propose an an overall source geometry in which the nucleus iscompletely embedded in material with $n_h\sim 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$

0808.4064	reprocessing of x-rays in the outer accretion disc of the black hole  binary xte j1817--330	we build a simple model of the optical/uv emission from irradiation of theouter disc by the inner disc and coronal emission in black hole binaries. weapply this to the broadband swift data from the outburst of the black holebinary xte j1817--330 to confirm previous results that the optical/uv emissionin the soft state is consistent with a reprocessing a constant fraction of thebolometric x-ray luminosity. however, this is very surprising as the disctemperature drops by more than a factor 3 in the soft state, which shouldproduce a marked change in the reprocessing efficiency. the easiest way tomatch the observed constant reprocessed fraction is for the disc skin to behighly ionized (as suggested 30 years ago by van paradijs), so that the bulk ofthe disc flux is reflected and only the hardest x-rays heat the disc. theconstant reprocessed fraction also favours direct illumination of the disc overa scattering origin as the optical depth/solid angle of any scattering material(wind/corona) over the disc should decrease as the source luminosity declines.by contrast, the reprocessed fraction increases very significantly (by a factor~6) as the source enters the hard state. this dramatic change is not evidentfrom x-ray/uv flux correlations as it is masked by bandpass effects. however,it does not necessarily signal a change in emission e.g. the emergence of thejet dominating the optical/uv flux as the reflection albedo must change withthe dramatic change in spectral shape.

astro-ph;0411339	extreme gravitational lensing near rotating black holes	we describe a new approach to calculating photon trajectories andgravitational lensing effects in the strong gravitational field of the kerrblack hole. these techniques are applied to explore both the imaging andspectral properties of photons that perform multiple orbits of the central massbefore escaping to infinity. viewed at large inclinations, these higher orderphotons contribute $\sim 20 %$ of the total luminosity of the system for aschwarzschild hole, whilst for an extreme kerr black hole this fraction risesto $\sim 60 %$. in more realistic models these photons will be re-absorbed bythe disc at large distances from the hole, but this returning radiation couldprovide a physical mechanism to resolve the discrepancy between the predictedand observed optical/uv colours in agn. conversely, at low inclinations, higherorder images re-intercept the disc plane close to the black hole, so need notbe absorbed by the disc if this is within the plunging region. these photonsform a bright ring carrying approximately 10% of the total disc luminosity fora schwarzchild black hole. the spatial separation between the inner edge of thedisc and the ring is similar to the size of the event horizon. this isresolvable for supermassive black holes with proposed x-ray interferometerymissions such as maxim, so has the potential to provide an observational testof strong field gravity.

astro-ph;0505183	scaling variability from stellar to supermassive black holes	we investigate the correspondence between the variability seen in the stellarand supermassive black holes. galactic black hole (gbh) power density spectra(pds) are generally complex, and dependent on spectral state. in the low/hardstate the high-frequency rollover in the pds moves in a way which is not simplyrelated to luminosity. hence this feature can only be used as an approximateindicator rather than as an accurate tracer of black hole mass in agn. thex-ray spectrum in the high/soft state is dominated by the disc in gbh, which israther stable. we show that the pds of the comptonized tail in gbh can be muchmore variable, and that it is this which should be compared to agn due to theirmuch lower disc temperature. this bandpass effect removes a problem ininterpreting the (often highly variable) narrow line seyfert 1 (nls1) galaxiesas the counterparts of the high mass accretion rate gbh. additionally, wespeculate that some nls1 (e.g. akn 564) are counterparts of the very highstate. the comptonized tail in this state is also highly variable, but with pdswhich can be roughly described as band-limited noise. this shape is similar tothat seen in the low/hard state, so merely seeing such band-limited noise inthe power spectrum of an agn does not necessarily imply low luminosity. we alsostress that cyg x-1, often used for comparison with agn, is not a typical blackhole system due to its persistent nature. in particular, the shape of its powerspectrum in the high/soft state is markedly different from that of other(transient) gbh systems in this state. the fact that the nls1s ngc 4051 andmcg-6-30-15 do appear to show a power spectrum similar to that of the high/softstate of cyg x-1 may lend observational support to theoretical speculation thatthe hydrogen ionization disc instability does not operate in agn.

astro-ph;0603126	analysing the atolls: x-ray spectral transitions of accreting neutron  stars	we systematically analyze all the available x-ray spectra of disc accretingneutron stars (atolls and millisecond pulsars) from the rxte database. we showthat while these all have similar spectral evolution as a function of massaccretion rate, there are also subtle differences. there are two differenttypes of hard/soft transition, those where the spectrum softens at allenergies, leading to a diagonal track on a colour-colour diagram, and thosewhere only the higher energy spectrum softens, giving a vertical track. theluminosity at which the transition occurs is correlated with this spectralbehaviour, with the vertical transition at l/l_edd ~0.02 while the diagonal oneis at ~0.1. superimposed on this is the well known hysteresis effect, but weshow that classic, large scale hysteresis occurs only in the outburstingsources, indicating that its origin is in the dramatic rate of change of massaccretion rate during the disc instability. we show that the long term massaccretion rate correlates with the transition behaviour, and speculate thatthis is due to the magnetic field being able to emerge from the neutron starsurface for low average mass accretion rates. while this is not strong enoughto collimate the flow except in the millisecond pulsars, its presence mayaffect the inner accretion flow by changing the properties of the jet.

astro-ph;0605129	energy-dependent variability and the origin of the soft x-ray excess in  agn	the origin of the soft excess seen in many agn below ~1 kev is still anunsolved problem. it is unlikely to represent a true continuum component as itscharacteristic 'temperature' shows a remarkable constancy over a wide range ofagn luminosity and black hole mass. this instead favours an association withatomic processes, in particular with the increase in opacity between 0.7-2 kevassociated with partially ionized o and fe. the opacity jump can give rise to asoft excess either through reflection or transmission, and both scenarios canfit the spectra equally well as long as there is strong velocity shear to smearout the characteristic narrow atomic features. here we use orthogonalconstraints from the energy-dependent variability. the rms spectra seen inxmm-newton agn data often show a broad peak between 0.7-2 kev. we show that theabsorption model can explain the data well if the ionization state of thesmeared absorption responds to luminosity changes in the continuum.

astro-ph;0610496	suzaku discovery of iron absorption lines in outburst spectra of the  x-ray transient 4u 1630-472	we present the results of six suzaku observations of the recurrent black holetransient 4u1630-472 during its decline from outburst from february 8 to march23 in 2006. all observations show the typical high/soft state spectral shape inthe 2-50kev band, roughly described by an optically thick disk spectrum in thesoft energy band plus a weak power-law tail that becomes dominant only above\~20kev. the disk temperature decreases from 1.4kev to 1.2kev as the fluxdecreases by a factor 2, consistent with a constant radius as expected fordisk-dominated spectra. all the observations reveal significant absorptionlines from highly ionized (h-like and he-like) iron ka at 7.0kev and 6.7kev.the brightest datasets also show significant but weaker absorption structuresbetween 7.8kev and 8.2kev, which we identify as a blend of iron kb and nickelka absorption lines. the energies of these absorption lines suggest a blueshift with an outflow velocity of ~1000km/s.. the h-like iron ka equivalentwidth remains approximately constant at ~30 ev over all the observations, whilethat of the he-like ka line increases from 7 ev to 20 ev. thus the ionizationstate of the material decreases, as expected from the decline in flux. we fitthe profiles with voigt functions (curve of growth) to derive absorbingcolumns, then use these together with detailed photo-ionization calculations toderive physical parameters of the absorbing material. the data then constrainthe velocity dispersion of the absorber to 200-2000 km/s, and the size of theplasma as ~1e10 cm assuming a source distance of 10 kpc.

astro-ph;0701410	can the soft excess in agn originate from disc reflection?	the soft excess seen in many agn is most probably due to partially ionizedmaterial moving at relativistic speeds close to the black hole. there arecurrently two potential geometries for this material, one where it is out ofthe line of sight, seen via reflection, e.g. the accretion disc, the otherwhere it is in the line of sight, seen in absorption e.g. a wind above thedisc. both models require apparent fine tuning of the ionization parameter ofthis material in order to produce the large jump in opacity at $\sim 0.7$ kevassociated with ovii/viii, as required to make the soft excess. however,chevalier et al (2006) show that these states rather naturally dominate theabsorption spectrum for soft x-ray spectra if the illuminated material is (atleast approximately) in pressure balance. here we explore whether hydrostaticpressure equilibrium in a disc can likewise naturally select the requiredionization states in reflection. we find the opposite. the soft excess x-rayexcess is much weaker in the hydrostatic models than it is in the constantdensity models. since even the constant density models cannot fit the largestsoft excesses seen without the intrinsic continuum being hidden from view, thismeans that reflection from a hydrostatic disc cannot realistically match thedata. even if the disc structure is instead more like a constant densityatmosphere, the required fine--tuning of the ionization parameter still remainsa problem for reflection models.

astro-ph;9610156	simultaneous x-ray and gamma-ray observations of cyg x-1 in the hard  state by ginga and osse	we present four x-ray/gamma-ray spectra of cyg x-1 observed in the hard('low') state simultaneously by ginga and gro/osse on 1991 july 6. the 3-30 kevginga spectra are well represented by power laws with an energy spectral indexof alpha~0.6 and a compton reflection component including a fluorescent fek-alpha corresponding to the solid angle of the reflector of ~0.3 times 2 pi.the overall ginga/osse spectra can be modelled by repeated compton scatteringin a mildly-relativistic, tau ~1, plasma. however, the high-energy cutoff issteeper than that due to single-temperature thermal comptonisation. it can bedescribed by a superposition of dominant optically-thin, thermal emission atkt~140 kev and a wien-like component from an optically-thick plasma at kt~50kev. the x-ray spectra do not show the presence of an anisotropy break requiredif thermal compton scattering takes place in a corona above a cold disc. also,the flat spectral index shows that the plasma is soft-photon starved, i.e., theluminosity in incident soft x-ray seed photons is very much less than that inthe hard x-rays. furthermore, the observed solid angle of the reflector issignificantly less than 2 pi. these facts taken together strongly rule out adisc-corona geometry. rather, the observed spectra are consistent with ageometry in which the cold accretion disc (which both supplies the seed softx-rays and reflects hard x-rays) only exists at large radii, while thecomptonising hot plasma is located in an inner region with no cold disc. thishot plasma consists of either pure electron-positron pairs if the source sizeis ~5 schwarzschild radii or it contains also protons if the size is larger.
