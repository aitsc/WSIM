0903.2238	near-infrared spectra of galactic stellar clusters detected on  spitzer/glimpse images	we present near-infrared spectroscopic observations of massive stars in threestellar clusters located in the direction of the inner galaxy. one of them, thequartet, is a new discovery while the other two were previously reported ascandidate clusters identified on mid-infrared spitzer images (glimpse20 andglimpse13). using medium-resolution (r=900-1320) h and k spectroscopy, wefirmly establish the nature of the brightest stars in these clusters, yieldingnew identifications of an early wc and two ofpe/wn9 stars in the quartet and anearly wc star in glimpse20. we combine this information with the availablephotometric measurements from 2mass, to estimate cluster masses, ages, anddistances. the presence of several massive stars places the quartet andglimpse20 among the small sample of known galactic stellar clusters with massesof a few 10^3 msun, and ages from 3 to 8 myr. we estimate a distance of about3.5 kpc for glimpse 20, and 6.0 kpc for quartet. the large number of giantstars identified in glimpse13 indicates that it is another massive (~ 6500msun) cluster, but older, with an age between 30 and 100 myr, at a distance ofabout 3 kpc.

0905.0691	radio and x-ray properties of submillimeter galaxies in the a2125 field	we present the radio and x-ray properties of 1.2 mm mambo source candidatesin a 1600 sq. arcmin field centered on the abell 2125 galaxy cluster atz=0.247. the brightest, non-synchrotron mm source candidate in the field has aphotometric redshift, z = 3.93^+1.11_-0.80, and is not detected in a 31 kschandra x-ray exposure. these findings are consistent with this object being anextremely dusty and luminous starburst galaxy at high-redshift, possibly themost luminous yet identified in any blank-field mm survey. the deep 1.4 ghz vlaimaging identifies counterparts for 83% of the 29 mm source candidatesidentified at &gt;=4-sigma s(1.2mm) = 2.7 - 52.1 mjy, implying that the majorityof these objects are likely to lie at z &lt;~ 3.5. the median mm-to-radiowavelength photometric redshift of this radio-detected sample is z~2.2 (firstand third quartiles of 1.7 and 3.0), consistent with the median redshiftderived from optical spectroscopic surveys of the radio-detected subsample ofbright submm galaxies (s(850um) &gt; 5 mjy). three mm-selected quasars areconfirmed to be x-ray luminous in the high resolution chandra imaging, whileanother mm source candidate with potential multiple radio counterparts is alsodetected in the x-ray regime. both of these radio counterparts are positionallyconsistent with the mm source candidate. one counterpart is associated with anelliptical galaxy at z = 0.2425, but we believe that a second counterpartassociated with a fainter optical source likely gives rise to the mm emissionat z~1.

0908.0018	imaging atomic and highly excited molecular gas in a z=6.42 quasar host  galaxy: copious fuel for an eddington-limited starburst at the end of cosmic  reionization	we have imaged co(j=7-6) and ci(3p2-3p1) emission in the host galaxy of thez=6.42 quasar sdss j114816.64+525150.3 (hereafter: j1148+5251) throughobservations with the plateau de bure interferometer. the region showingco(j=7-6) emission is spatially resolved, and its size of 5 kpc is in goodagreement with earlier co(j=3-2) observations. in combination with a revisedmodel of the collisional line excitation in this source, this indicates thatthe highly excited molecular gas traced by the co j=7-6 line is subthermallyexcited (showing only 58+/-8% of the co j=3-2 luminosity), but not morecentrally concentrated. we also detect ci(3p2-3p1) emission in the host galaxyof j1148+5251, but the line is too faint to enable a reliable size measurement.  from the ci(3p2-3p1) line flux, we derive a total atomic carbon mass ofm_ci=1.1x10^7 m_sun, which corresponds to ~5x10^-4 times the total moleculargas mass. we also searched for h2o(j_kakc=2_12-1_01) emission, and obtained asensitive line luminosity limit of l'_h2o&lt;4.4x10^9 k kms pc^2, i.e., &lt;15% ofthe co(j=3-2) luminosity. the warm, highly excited molecular gas, atomic gasand dust in this quasar host at the end of cosmic reionization maintain anintense starburst that reaches surface densities as high as predicted by (dustopacity) eddington limited star formation over kiloparsec scales.

1002.1561	molecular gas in redshift 6 quasar host galaxies	we report our new observations of redshifted carbon monoxide emission fromsix z~6 quasars, using the pdbi. co (6-5) or (5-4) line emission was detectedin all six sources. together with two other previous co detections, theseobservations provide unique constraints on the molecular gas emissionproperties in these quasar systems close to the end of the cosmic reionization.complementary results are also presented for low-j co lines observed at the gbtand the vla, and dust continuum from five of these sources with the sharc-iibolometer camera at the cso. we then present a study of the molecular gasproperties in our combined sample of eight co-detected quasars at z~6. thedetections of high-order co line emission in these objects indicates thepresence of highly excited molecular gas, with estimated masses on the order of10^10 m_sun within the quasar host galaxies. no significant difference is foundin the gas mass and co line width distributions between our z~6 quasars andsamples of co-detected $1.4\leq z\leq5$ quasars and submillimeter galaxies.most of the co-detected quasars at z~6 follow the far infrared-co luminosityrelationship defined by actively star-forming galaxies at low and highredshifts. this suggests that ongoing star formation in their hosts contributessignificantly to the dust heating at fir wavelengths. the result is consistentwith the picture of galaxy formation co-eval with supermassive black hole(smbh) accretion in the earliest quasar-host systems. we investigate the blackhole--bulge relationships of our quasar sample, using the co dynamics as atracer for the dynamical mass of the quasar host. the results place importantconstraints on the formation and evolution of the most massive smbh-spheroidalhost systems at the highest redshift.

1004.2029	circumstellar molecular composition of the oxygen-rich agb star ik tau:  i. observations and lte chemical abundance analysis	the aim of this paper is to study the molecular composition in thecircumstellar envelope around the oxygen-rich star ik tau. we observed ik tauin several (sub)millimeter bands using the apex telescope during threeobserving periods. to determine the spatial distribution of the$\mathrm{^{12}co(3-2)}$ emission, mapping observations were performed. toconstrain the physical conditions in the circumstellar envelope, multiplerotational co emission lines were modeled using a non local thermodynamicequilibrium radiative transfer code. the rotational temperatures and theabundances of the other molecules were obtained assuming local thermodynamicequilibrium. an oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch star has been surveyed inthe submillimeter wavelength range. thirty four transitions of twelve molecularspecies, including maser lines, were detected. the kinetic temperature of theenvelope was determined and the molecular abundance fractions of the moleculeswere estimated. the deduced molecular abundances were compared withobservations and modeling from the literature and agree within a factor of 10,except for so$_2$, which is found to be almost a factor 100 stronger thanpredicted by chemical models. from this study, we found that ik tau is a goodlaboratory to study the conditions in circumstellar envelopes aroundoxygen-rich stars with (sub)millimeter-wavelength molecular lines. we couldalso expect from this study that the molecules in the circumstellar envelopecan be explained more faithful by non-lte analysis with lower and highertransition lines than by simple lte analysis with only lower transition lines.in particular, the observed co line profiles could be well reproduced by asimple expanding envelope model with a power law structure.

1009.1426	orion kl: the hot core that is not a "hot core"	we present sensitive high angular resolution submillimeter and millimeterobservations of torsionally/vibrationally highly excited lines of the ch$_3$oh,hc$_3$n, so$_2$, and ch$_3$cn molecules and of the continuum emission at 870and 1300 $\mu$m from the orion kl region, made with the submillimeter array(sma). these observations plus recent sma co j=3-2 and j=2-1 imaging of theexplosive flow originating in this region, which is related to thenon-hierarchical disintegration of a massive young stellar system, suggest thatthe molecular orion "hot core" is a pre-existing density enhancement heatedfrom the outside by the explosive event -- unlike in other hot cores we do notfind any self-luminous submillimeter, radio or infrared source embedded in thehot molecular gas. indeed, we do not observe filamentary co flow structures or"fingers" in the shadow of the hot core pointing away from the explosioncenter. the low-excitation ch$_3$cn emission shows the typical molecularheart-shaped structure, traditionally named the hot core, and is centered closeto the dynamical origin of the explosion. the highest excitation ch$_3$cn linesare all arising from the northeast lobe of the heart-shaped structure, {\it i.e.} from the densest and most highly obscured parts of the extended ridge. thetorsionally excited ch$_3$oh and vibrationally excited hc$_3$n lines appear toform a shell around the strongest submillimeter continuum source. surprisinglythe kinematics of the hot core and compact ridge regions as traced by ch$_3$cnand hc$_3$n also reveal filament-like structures that emerge from the dynamicalorigin. all of these observations suggest the southeast and southwest sectorsof the explosive flow to have impinged on a pre-existing very dense part of theextended ridge, thus creating the bright orion kl hot core.

1011.0991	dense molecular gas excitation at high redshift: detection of  hco+(j=4-3) emission in the cloverleaf quasar	we report the detection of hco+(j=4-3) emission in the cloverleaf quasar atz=2.56, using the iram plateau de bure interferometer. hco+ emission is a starformation indicator similar to hcn, tracing dense molecular hydrogen gas (n(h2)~= 10^5 cm^-3) within star-forming molecular clouds. we derive alensing-corrected hco+(j=4-3) line luminosity of l'(hco+(4-3)) = (1.6+/-0.3) x10^9 (mu_l/11)^-1 k km/s pc^2, which corresponds to only 48% of the hco+(j=1=0)luminosity, and &lt;~4% of the co(j=3-2) luminosity. the hco+ excitation thus isclearly subthermal in the j=4-3 transition. modeling of the hco+ line radiativetransfer suggests that the hco+ emission emerges from a region with physicalproperties comparable to that exhibiting the co line emission, but 2x highergas density. this suggests that both hco+ and co lines trace the warm, densemolecular gas where star formation actively takes place. the hco+ lines haveonly ~2/3 the width of the co lines, which may suggest that the densest gas ismore spatially concentrated. in contrast to the z=3.91 quasar apm08279+5255,the dense gas excitation in the cloverleaf is consistent with being purelycollisional, rather than being enhanced by radiative processes. thus, thephysical properties of the dense gas component in the cloverleaf are consistentwith those in the nuclei of nearby starburst galaxies. this suggests that theconditions in the dense, star-forming gas in active galactic nucleus-starburstsystems at early cosmic times like the cloverleaf are primarily affected by thestarburst itself, rather than the central active black hole.

1011.2904	a deep wide-field sub-mm survey of the carina nebula complex	the great nebula in carina is a superb location in which to study the physicsof violent massive star-formation and the resulting feedback effects, includingcloud dispersal and triggered star-formation. in order to reveal the cold dustyclouds in the carina nebula complex, we used the large apex bolometer cameralaboca at the apex telescope to map a 1.25 deg x 1.25 deg (= 50 x 50 pc^2)region at 870 micrometer. from a comparison to halpha images we infer thatabout 6% of the 870 micrometer flux in the observed area is likely free-freeemission from the hii region, while about 94% of the flux is very likelythermal dust emission. the total (dust + gas) mass of all clouds for which ourmap is sensitive is ~ 60 000 msun, in good agreement with the mass of thecompact clouds in this region derived from 13co line observations. we generallyfind good agreement in the cloud morphology seen at 870 micrometer and thespitzer 8 micrometer emission maps, but also identify a prominent infrared darkcloud. finally, we construct a radiative transfer model for the carina nebulacomplex that reproduces the observed integrated spectral energy distributionreasonably well. our analysis suggests a total gas + dust mass of about 200000msun in the investigated area; most of this material is in the form ofmolecular clouds, but a widely distributed component of (partly) atomic gas,containing up to ~ 50% of the total mass, may also be present. currently, onlysome 10% of the gas is in sufficiently dense clouds to be immediately availablefor future star formation, but this fraction may increase with time owing tothe ongoing compression of the strongly irradiated clouds and the expectedshockwaves of the imminent supernova explosions.

1102.1395	densitometry and thermometry of starburst galaxies	with a goal toward deriving the physical conditions in external galaxies, wepresent a survey of formaldehyde (h2co) and ammonia (nh3) emission andabsorption in a sample of starburst galaxies using the green bank telescope. byextending well-established techniques used to derive the spatial density instar formation regions in our own galaxy, we show how the relative intensity ofthe 1(10)-1(11) and 2(11)-2(12) k-doublet transitions of h2co can provide anaccurate densitometer for the active star formation environments found instarburst galaxies (c.f. mangum et al. 2008). similarly, we employ thewell-established technique of using the relative intensities of the (1,1),(2,2), and (4,4) transitions of nh3 to derive the kinetic temperature instarburst galaxies. our measurements of the kinetic temperature constrainedspatial density in our starburst galaxy sample represent the first mean densitymeasurements made toward starburst galaxies. we note a disparity betweenkinetic temperature measurements derived assuming direct coupling to dust andthose derived from our nh3 measurements which points to the absolute need fordirect gas kinetic temperature measurements using an appropriate molecularprobe. finally, our spatial density measurements point to a rough constancy tothe spatial density (10^{4.5} to 10^{5.5} cm^{-3}) in our starburst galaxysample. this implies that the schmidt-kennicutt relation between l_{ir} andm_{dense}: (1) is a measure of the dense gas mass reservoir available to formstars, and (2) is not directly dependent upon a higher average density drivingthe star formation process in the most luminous starburst galaxies.

1103.2088	hot hcn around young massive stars at 0.1" resolution	massive stars form deeply embedded in dense molecular gas, which they stirand heat up and ionize. during an early phase, the ionization is confined tohypercompact hii regions, and the stellar radiation is entirely absorbed bydust, giving rise to a hot molecular core. to investigate the innermoststructure of such high-mass star-forming regions, we observed vibrationallyexcited hcn (via the direct $\ell$-type transition of v2=1, $\delta j$=0, j=13,which lies 1400 k above ground) toward the massive hot molecular coresg10.47+0.03, sgrb2-n, and sgrb2-m with the very large array (vla) at 7 mm,reaching a resolution of about 1000 au (0.1"). we detect the line both inemission and in absorption against hii regions. the latter allows to derivelower limits on the column densities of hot hcn, which are several times$10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$. we see indication of expansion motions in g10.47+0.03 anddetect velocity components in sgrb2-m at 50, 60, and 70 km/s relative to thelocal standard of rest. the emission originates in regions of less than 0.1 pcdiameter around the hypercompact hii regions g10.47+0.03 b1 and sgrb2-n k2, andreaches brightness temperatures of more than 200 k. using the three-dimensionalradiative transfer code radmc-3d, we model the sources as dense dust coresheated by stars in the hii regions, and derive masses of hot (&gt;300 k) moleculargas of more than 100 solar masses (for an hcn fractional abundance of10$^{-5}$), challenging current simulations of massive star formation. heatingonly by the stars in the hii regions is sufficient to produce such largequantities of hot molecular gas, provided that dust is optically thick to itsown radiation, leading to high temperatures through diffusion of radiation.

1106.1173	volume density thresholds for overall star formation imply mass-size  thresholds for massive star formation	we aim at understanding the massive star formation (msf) limit $m(r) = 870m_{\odot} (r/pc)^{1.33}$ in the mass-size space of molecular structuresrecently proposed by kauffmann &amp; pillai (2010). as a first step, we build onthe hypothesis of a volume density threshold for overall star formation and themodel of parmentier (2011) to establish the mass-radius relations of molecularclumps containing given masses of star-forming gas. specifically, we relate themass $m_{clump}$, radius $r_{clump}$ and density profile slope $-p$ ofmolecular clumps which contain a mass $m_{th}$ of gas denser than a volumedensity threshold $\rho_{th}$. in a second step, we use the relation betweenthe mass of embedded-clusters and the mass of their most-massive star toestimate the minimum mass of star-forming gas needed to form a $10\,m_{\odot}$star. assuming a star formation efficiency of $sfe \simeq 0.30$, this gives$m_{th,crit} \simeq 150 m_{\odot}$. in a third step, we demonstrate that, forsensible choices of the clump density index ($p \simeq 1.7$) and of the clusterformation density threshold ($n_{th} \simeq 10^4\,cm^{-3}$), the line ofconstant $m_{th,crit} \simeq 150 m_{\odot}$ in the mass-radius space ofmolecular structures equates with the msf limit for spatial scales larger than0.3\,pc. hence, the observationally inferred msf limit of kauffmann &amp; pillai isconsistent with a threshold in star-forming gas mass beyond which thestar-forming gas reservoir is large enough to allow the formation of massivestars. for radii smaller than 0.3\,pc, the msf limit is shown to be consistentwith the formation of a $10\,m_{\odot}$ star out of its individual pre-stellarcore of density threshold $n_{th} \simeq 10^5\,cm^{-3}$. the inferred densitythresholds for the formation of star clusters and individual stars within starclusters match those previously suggested in the literature.

1107.5065	far-infrared and molecular co emission from the host galaxies of faint  quasars at z~6	we present new millimeter and radio observations of nine z~6 quasarsdiscovered in deep optical and near-infrared surveys. we observed the 250 ghzcontinuum in eight of the nine objects and detected three of them. new 1.4 ghzradio continuum data have been obtained for four sources, and one has beendetected. we searched for molecular co (6-5) line emission in the three 250 ghzdetections and detected two of them. we study the fir and radio emission andquasar-host galaxy evolution with a sample of 18 z~6 quasars that are faint atuv/optical wavelengths (rest-frame 1450a magnitudes of m_1450\ge20.2). theaverage fir-to-agn uv luminosity ratio of this faint quasar sample is about twotimes higher than that of the bright quasars at z~6 (m_1450&lt;20.2). a fit to theaverage fir and agn bolometric luminosities of both the uv/optically faint andbright z~6 quasars, and the average luminosities of samples of submillimeter/millimeter-observed quasars at z~2 to 5, yields a relationship of l_{fir}{l_{bol}}^{0.62}. five of the 18 faint z~6 quasars have been detected at 250ghz. these 250 ghz detections, as well as most of the millimeter-detectedoptically bright z~6 quasars, follow a shallower trend of l_{fir}{l_{bol}}^{0.45} defined by the starburst-agn systems in local and high-zuniverse. the millimeter continuum detections in the five objects and molecularco detections in three of them reveal a few x10^8 m_sun of fir-emitting warmdust and 10^10 m_sun of molecular gas in the quasar host galaxies. all theseresults argue for massive star formation in the quasar host galaxies, withestimated star formation rates of a few hundred m_sun yr^{-1}. additionally,the higher fir-to-agn luminosity ratio found in these 250 ghz-detected faintquasars also suggests a higher ratio between star formation rate andsupermassive black hole accretion rate than the uv/optically most luminousquasars at z~6.

0710.2115	formaldehyde densitometry of starburst galaxies	with a goal toward deriving the physical conditions in external galaxies, wepresent a survey of the formaldehyde emission in a sample of starburst systems.by extending a technique used to derive the spatial density in star formationregions in our own galaxy, we show how the relative intensity of the1(10)-1(11) and 2(11)-2(12) k-doublet transitions of h2co can provide anaccurate densitometer for the active star formation environments found instarburst galaxies. relying upon an assumed kinetic temperature and co-spatialemission and absorption from both h2co transitions, our technique is applied toa sample of nineteen ir-bright galaxies which exhibit various forms ofstarburst activity. in the five galaxies of our sample where both h2cotransitions were detected we have derived spatial densities. we also use h2coto estimate the dense gas mass in our starburst galaxy sample, finding similarmass estimates for the dense gas forming stars in these objects as derivedusing other dense gas tracers. a related trend can be seen when one comparesl_ir to our derived n(h2) for the five galaxies within which we have derivedspatial densities. even though our number statistics are small, there appearsto be a trend toward higher spatial density for galaxies with higher infraredluminosity. this is likely another representation of the l_ir-m_densecorrelation.

1302.3526	formaldehyde densitometry of starburst galaxies: density-independent  global star formation	accurate techniques which allow for the derivation of the spatial density instar formation regions are rare. a technique which has found application forthe derivation of spatial densities in galactic star formation regions utilizesthe density-sensitive properties of the k-doublet transitions of formaldehyde(h2co). in this paper, we present an extension of our survey of theformaldehyde 1(10)-1(11) (lambda = 6.2 cm) and 2(11)-2(12) (lambda = 2.1 cm)k-doublet transitions of h2co in a sample of 56 starburst systems (mangum etal.2008). we have extended the number of galaxies in which both transitions havebeen detected from 5 to 13. we have improved our spatial density measurementsby incorporating kinetic temperatures based upon nh3 measurements of 11 of thegalaxies with a total of 14 velocity components in our sample (mangum etal.2013). our spatial density measurements lie in a relatively narrow range offrom 10^(4.5) to 10^(5.5) cm^(-3). this implies that the schmidt-kennicuttrelation between l_(ir) and m_(dense): (1) is an indication of the dense gasmass reservoir available to form stars, and (2) is not directly dependent upona higher average density driving the star formation process in the mostluminous starburst galaxies. we have also used our h2co measurements to derivetwo separate measures of the dense gas mass which are generally smaller, inmany cases by a factor of 10^2-10^3, than those derived using hcn. thisdisparity suggests that h2co traces a denser, more compact, component of thegiant molecular clouds in our starburst galaxy sample.  we also report measurements of the rotationally-excited lambda = 6.3 cm2p_(1/2) j=1/2 state of oh and the h111alpha radio recombination line takenconcurrently with our h2co 1(10)-1(11) measurements.

1408.5100	submillimeter polarimetry with polka, a reflection-type modulator for  the apex telescope	imaging polarimetry is an important tool for the study of cosmic magneticfields. in our galaxy, polarization levels of a few up to $\sim$10\% aremeasured in the submillimeter dust emission from molecular clouds and in thesynchrotron emission from supernova remnants. only few techniques exist toimage the distribution of polarization angles, as a means of tracing theplane-of-sky projection of the magnetic field orientation. at submillimeterwavelengths, polarization is either measured as the differential total power ofpolarization-sensitive bolometer elements, or by modulating the polarization ofthe signal. bolometer arrays such as laboca at the apex telescope are used toobserve the continuum emission from fields as large as $\sim0\fdg2$ indiameter. %here we present the results from the commissioning of polka, apolarimeter for here we present polka, a polarimeter for laboca with areflection-type waveplate of at least 90\% efficiency. the modulationefficiency depends mainly on the sampling and on the angular velocity of thewaveplate. for the data analysis the concept of generalized synchronousdemodulation is introduced. the instrumental polarization towards a pointsource is at the level of $\sim0.1$\%, increasing to a few percent at the$-10$db contour of the main beam. a method to correct for its effect inobservations of extended sources is presented. our map of the polarizedsynchrotron emission from the crab nebula is in agreement with structuresobserved at radio and optical wavelengths. the linear polarization measured inomc1 agrees with results from previous studies, while the high sensitivity oflaboca enables us to also map the polarized emission of the orion bar, aprototypical photon-dominated region.

1410.7390	magnetic fields in high-mass infrared dark clouds	high-mass stars are cosmic engines known to dominate the energetics in themilky way and other galaxies. however, their formation is still not wellunderstood. massive, cold, dense clouds, often appearing as infrared darkclouds (irdcs), are the nurseries of massive stars. no measurements of magneticfields in irdcs in a state prior to the onset of high-mass star formation(hmsf) have previously been available, and prevailing hmsf theories do notconsider strong magnetic fields. here, we report observations of magneticfields in two of the most massive irdcs in the milky way. we show that irdcsg11.11-0.12 and g0.253+0.016 are strongly magnetized and that the strongmagnetic field is as important as turbulence and gravity for hmsf. the maindense filament in g11.11-0.12 is perpendicular to the magnetic field, while thelower density filament merging onto the main filament is parallel to themagnetic field. the implied magnetic field is strong enough to suppressfragmentation sufficiently to allow hmsf. other mechanisms reducingfragmentation, such as the entrapment of heating from young stars via high masssurface densities, are not required to facilitate hmsf.

astro-ph;0510622	high mass star formation in the infrared dark cloud g11.11-0.12	we report detection of moderate to high-mass star formation in an infrareddark cloud (g11.11-0.12) where we discovered class ii methanol and water maseremissions at 6.7 ghz and 22.2 ghz, respectively. we also observed the object inammonia inversion transitions. strong emission from the (3,3) line indicates ahot (~60 k) compact component associated with the maser emission. the linewidth of the hot component (4 km/s), as well as the methanol maser detection,are indicative of high mass star formation. to further constrain the physicalparameters of the source, we derived the spectral energy distribution (sed) ofthe dust continuum by analysing data from the 2mass survey, hiras, msx, thespitzer space telescope, and interferometric 3mm observations. the sed wasmodelled in a radiative transfer program: a) the stellar luminosity equals 1200l_sun corresponding to a zams star of 8 m_sun; b) the bulk of the envelope hasa temperature of 19 k; c) the mass of the remnant protostellar cloud in an area8x10^17 cm or 15 arcsec across amounts to 500m_sun, if assuming standard dustof the diffuse medium, and to about 60 m_sun, should the grains be fluffy andhave ice mantles; d) the corresponding visual extinction towards the star is afew hundred magnitudes. the near ir data can be explained by scattering fromtenuous material above a hypothetical disk. the class ii methanol maser linesare spread out in velocity over 11 km/s. to explain the kinematics of themasing spots, we propose that they are located in a kepler disk at a distanceof about 250 au. the dust temperatures there are around 150 k, high enough toevaporate methanol--containing ice mantles.

astro-ph;0601078	ammonia in infrared dark clouds	infrared dark clouds appear to be the long sought population of cold anddense aggregations with the potential of harbouring the earliest stages ofmassive star formation. up to now there has been no systematic study on thetemperature distribution, velocity fields, chemical and physical state towardthis new cloud population. knowing these properties is crucial forunderstanding the presence, absence and the very potential of star formation.the present paper aims at addressing these questions. we analyse temperaturestructures and velocity fields and gain information on their chemicalevolution. the gas emission is remarkably coextensive with the extinction seenat infrared wavelengths and with the submillimeter dust emission. our resultsshow that irdcs are on average cold (t &lt; 20 k) and have variations among thedifferent cores. irdc cores are in virial equilibrium, are massive (m &gt; 100m_sun), highly turbulent (1 -- 3 km/s) and exhibit significant velocitystructure (variations around 1 -- 2 km/s over the cloud). we find an increasingtrend in temperature from irdcs with high ammonia column density to high massprotostellar objects and hot core/ultracompact hii regions stages of early warmhigh-mass star formation while linewidths of irdcs are smaller. on the basis ofthis sample, we infer that while active star formation is not yet pervasive inmost irdcs, local condensations might collapse in the future or have alreadybegun forming stars.

astro-ph;0605437	first detection of hco+ emission at high redshift	we report the detection of hco+(1-0) emission towards the cloverleaf quasar(z=2.56) through observations with the very large array. this is the firstdetection of ionized molecular gas emission at high redshift (z&gt;2). hco+emission is a star formation indicator similar to hcn, tracing dense molecularhydrogen gas (n(h_2) ~= 10^5 cm^{-3}) within star-forming molecular clouds. wederive a lensing-corrected hco+ line luminosity of l'(hco+) = 3.5 x 10^9 k km/spc^2. combining our new results with co and hcn measurements from theliterature, we find a hco+/co luminosity ratio of 0.08 and a hco+/hcnluminosity ratio of 0.8. these ratios fall within the scatter of the samerelationships found for low-z star-forming galaxies. however, a hco+/hcnluminosity ratio close to unity would not be expected for the cloverleaf if therecently suggested relation between this ratio and the far-infrared luminositywere to hold. we conclude that a ratio between hco+ and hcn luminosity close to1 is likely due to the fact that the emission from both lines is opticallythick and thermalized and emerges from dense regions of similar volumes. theco, hcn and hco+ luminosities suggest that the cloverleaf is a compositeagn--starburst system, in agreement with the previous finding that about 20% ofthe total infrared luminosity in this system results from dust heated by starformation rather than heating by the agn. we conclude that hco+ is potentiallya good tracer for dense molecular gas at high redshift.

astro-ph;0606422	co(1-0) in z &gt;/~ 4 quasar host galaxies: no evidence for extended  molecular gas reservoirs	we present co(1-0) observations of the high-redshift quasi-stellar objects(qsos) br 1202-0725 (z=4.69), pss j2322+1944 (z=4.12), and apm 08279+5255(z=3.91) using the nrao green bank telescope (gbt) and the mpifr effelsberg100m telescope. we detect, for the first time, the co ground-level transitionin br 1202-0725. for pss j2322+1944 and apm 08279+5255, our observations resultin line fluxes that are consistent with previous nrao very large array (vla)observations, but they reveal the full line profiles. we report a typicallensing-corrected velocity-integrated intrinsic co(1-0) line luminosity ofl'(co) = 5 x 10^10 k km/s pc^2 and a typical total h_2 mass of m(h2) = 4 x10^10 m_sun for the sources in our sample. the co/fir luminosity ratios ofthese high-z sources follow the same trend as seen for low-z galaxies, leadingto a combined solution of log(l_fir) = (1.39 +/- 0.05) x log(l(co))-1.76. ithas previously been suggested that the molecular gas reservoirs in some quasarhost galaxies may exhibit luminous, extended co(1-0) components that are notobserved in the higher-j co transitions. utilizing the line profiles and thetotal intensities of our observations and large velocity gradient (lvg) modelsbased on previous results for higher-j co transitions, we derive that emissionfrom all co transitions is described well by a single gas component where allmolecular gas is concentrated in a compact nuclear region. thus, ourobservations and models show no indication of a luminous extended, low surfacebrightness molecular gas component in any of the high-redshift qsos in oursample. if such extended components exist, their contribution to the overallluminosity is limited to at most 30%.

0809.2337	properties of the molecular gas in a starbursting qso at z=1.83 in the  cosmos field	using the iram 30m telescope, we have detected the co j=2-1, 4-3, 5-4, and6-5 emission lines in the millimeter-bright, blank-field selected agn cosmosj100038+020822 at redshift z=1.8275. the sub-local thermodynamic equilibrium(lte) excitation of the j=4 level implies that the gas is less excited thanthat in typical nearby starburst galaxies such as ngc253, and in thehigh-redshift quasars studied to date, such as j1148+5251 or br1202-0725. largevelocity gradient (lvg) modeling of the co line spectral energy distribution(co sed; flux density vs. rotational quantum number) yields h2 densities in therange 10^{3.5}--10^{4.0} cm-3, and kinetic temperatures between 50 k and 200 k.the h2 mass of (3.6 - 5.4) x 10^{10} m_sun implied by the line intensitiescompares well with our estimate of the dynamical mass within the inner 1.5 kpcof the object. fitting a two-component gray body spectrum, we find a dust massof 1.2 x 10^{9} m_sun, and cold and hot dust temperatures of 42+/-5 k and160+/-25 k, respectively. the broad mgii line allows us to estimate the mass ofthe central black hole as 1.7 x 10^{9} m_sun. although the optical spectrum andmulti-wavelength sed matches those of an average qso, the molecular gas contentand dust properties resemble those of known submillimeter galaxies (smgs). theoptical morphology of this source shows tidal tails that suggest a recentinteraction or merger. since it shares properties of both starburst and agn,this object appears to be in a transition from a strongly starformingsubmillimeter galaxy to a qso.

astro-ph;9610073	neutral hydrogen 21cm absorption at redshift 0.673 towards 1504+377	we detect the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen in absorption at a redshift of0.673 towards the 1 jy radio source 1504+377. the 1504+377 radio source islocated toward the center of what appears to be an inclined disk galaxy at z =0.674. the 21 cm absorption line shows multiple velocity components over avelocity range of about 100 km sec$^{-1}$, with a total hi column density:n(hi) = $3.8\times10^{19}\times({{t_s}\over{f}})$ cm$^{-2}$. thevelocity-integrated optical depth of this system is the largest yet seen forredshifted hi 21 cm absorption line systems (carilli 1995). the 21 cmabsorption line is coincident in redshift with a previously detected broadmolecular absorption line system (wiklind and combes 1996). we do not detect hi21 cm absorption associated with the narrow molecular absorption line system atz = 0.67150, nor do we detect absorption at these redshifts by the 18 cm linesof oh, nor by the 2 cm transition of h$_2$co. there is no evidence for a brightoptical agn in 1504+377, suggesting significant obscuration through the disk --a hypothesis supported by the strong absorption observed. the 1504+377 systemresembles the ``red quasar'' pks 1413+135, which has been modeled as aoptically obscured agn with a very young radio jet in the center of a gas richdisk galaxy (perlman et al. 1996). the presence of very bright radio jets atthe centers of these two disk galaxies presents a challenge to unificationschemes for extragalactic radio sources and to models for the formation ofradio loud agn.

astro-ph;9802326	plans for a 10-m submillimeter-wave telescope at the south pole	a 10 meter diameter submillimeter-wave telescope has been proposed for thensf amundsen-scott south pole station. current evidence indicates that thesouth pole is the best submillimeter-wave telescope site among all existing orproposed ground-based observatories. proposed scientific programs placestringent requirements on the optical quality of the telescope design. inparticular, reduction of the thermal background and offsets requires anoff-axis, unblocked aperture, and the large field of view needed for surveyobservations requires shaped optics. this mix of design elements is well-suitedfor large scale (square degree) mapping of line and continuum radiation fromsubmillimeter-wave sources at moderate spatial resolutions (4 to 60 arcsecondbeam size) and high sensitivity (millijansky flux density levels). thetelescope will make arcminute angular scale, high frequency cosmic microwavebackground measurements from the best possible ground-based site, using anaperture which is larger than is currently possible on orbital or airborneplatforms. effective use of this telescope will require development of large(1000 element) arrays of submillimeter detectors which are background-limitedwhen illuminated by antenna temperatures near 50 k.

astro-ph;9812179	high redshift hi 21cm absorption toward red quasars	we have searched for redshifted absorption in the 21 cm line of neutralhydrogen toward `red quasars', which are extragalactic radio sources with asteep spectral drop between optical and infrared wavelengths. the success ratefor detecting hi 21cm absorption toward a representative sample of such sourcesis 80%. this compares to the much lower success rate of 11% for detecting hi21cm absorption associated with optically selected mg ii absorption linesystems. the large neutral hydrogen column densities seen toward red quasarssupports the hypothesis that these sources are reddened by dust, as opposed tohaving an intrinsically red spectrum due to the agn emission mechanism. thelower limits to the spin temperatures for the neutral hydrogen are between 50 kand 1000 k, assuming a galactic dust-to-gas ratio. we consider the question ofbiases in optically selected samples of quasars due to dust obscuration. thedata on the red quasar sub-sample support the models of fall and pei for dustobscuration by damped ly alpha absorption line systems, and suggest that: (i)there may be a significant, but not dominant, population of quasars missingfrom optically selected samples due to dust obscuration, perhaps as high as 20%at the poss limit for an optical sample with a redshift distribution similar tothe 1 jy, flat spectrum quasar sample, and (ii) optically selected samples maymiss about half the high column density quasar absorption line systems.

0809.5048	a multi-wavelength study of a double intermediate-mass protostar - from  large-scale structure to collimated jets	(abridged) we study a previously discovered protostellar source that isdeeply embedded and drives an energetic molecular outflow. the source, uyso1,is located close to iras 07029-1215 at a distance of ~1 kpc. themulti-wavelength observations resulted in the detection of a doubleintermediate-mass protostar at the location of uyso1. in addition to theassociated molecular outflow, with a projected size of 0.25 pc, twointersecting near-infrared jets with projected sizes of 0.4 pc and 0.2 pc werefound. however, no infrared counterparts to the driving sources could bedetected in sensitive near- to far-infrared observations. in interferometricmillimeter observations, uyso1 was resolved into two continuum sources withhigh column densities and gas masses of 3.5 mo and 1.2 mo, with a linearseparation of 4200 au. we report the discovery of a h2o maser toward one of thetwo sources. the total luminosity is roughly estimated to be ~50 lo, shared bythe two components, one of which is driving the molecular outflow that has adynamical timescale of less than a few thousand years. the jets of the twoindividual components are not aligned. submillimeter observations show that theregion lacks typical hot-core chemistry. we thus find two protostellar objects,whose associated circumstellar and parent core masses are high enough tosuggest that they may evolve into intermediate-mass stars. this is corroboratedby their association with a very massive and energetic co outflow, suggestinghigh protostellar accretion rates. the short dynamical timescale of theoutflow, the pristine chemical composition of the cloud core and absence of hotcore tracers, the absence of detectable radio continuum emission, and the verylow protostellar luminosity argue for an extremely early evolutionary stage.

0810.2844	observations of the goldreich-kylafis effect in star-forming regions  with xpol at the iram 30m telescope	the goldreich-kylafis (gk) effect causes certain molecular line emission tobe weakly linearly polarized, e.g., in the presence of a magnetic field.compared to polarized dust emission, the gk effect has the potential to yieldadditional information along the line of sight through its dependence onvelocity in the line profile. our goal was to detect polarized molecular lineemission toward the dr21(oh), w3oh/h2o, g34.3+0.2, and uyso1 dense molecularcloud cores in transitions of rare co isotopologues and cs. the feasibility ofsuch observations had to be established by studying the influence of polarizedsidelobes, e.g., in the presence of extended emission in the surroundings ofcompact sources. the observations were carried out with the iram 30m telescopeemploying the correlation polarimeter xpol and using two orthogonally polarizedreceivers. we produced beam maps to investigate instrumental polarization.while in nearly all transitions toward all sources a polarized signal is found,its degree of polarization only in one case surpasses the polarization that canbe expected due to instrumental effects. it is shown that any emission in thepolarized sidelobes of the system can produce instrumental polarization, evenif the source is unpolarized. tentative evidence for astronomically polarizedline emission with pl&lt;~1.5% was found in the cs(2-1) line toward g34.3+0.2.
