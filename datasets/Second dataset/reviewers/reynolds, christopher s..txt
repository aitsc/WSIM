0812.4874	reaction of accretion disks to abrupt mass loss during binary black hole  merger	the association of an electromagnetic signal with the merger of a pair ofsupermassive black holes would have many important implications. for example,it would provide new information about gas and magnetic field interactions indynamical spacetimes as well as a combination of redshift and luminositydistance that would enable precise cosmological tests. a proposal first made bybode &amp; phinney (2007) is that because radiation of gravitational waves duringthe final inspiral and merger of the holes is abrupt and decreases the mass ofthe central object by a few percent, there will be waves in the disk that cansteepen into shocks and thus increase the disk luminosity in a characteristicway. we evaluate this process analytically and numerically. we find that shocksonly occur when the fractional mass loss exceeds the half-thickness (h/r) ofthe disk, hence significant energy release only occurs for geometrically thindisks which are thus at low eddington ratios. this strongly limits theeffective energy release, and in fact our simulations show that the naturalvariations in disk luminosity are likely to obscure this effect entirely.however, we demonstrate that the reduction of luminosity caused by the retreatof the inner edge of the disk following mass loss is potentially detectable.this decrease occurs even if the disk is geometrically thick, and lasts for aduration on the order of the viscous time of the modified disk.observationally, the best prospect for detection would be a sensitive futurex-ray instrument with a field of view of on the order of a square degree, orpossibly a wide-field radio array such as the square kilometer array, if thedisk changes produce or interrupt radio emission from a jet.

0905.4508	simulations of mhd instabilities in intracluster medium including  anisotropic thermal conduction	we perform a suite of simulations of cooling cores in clusters of galaxies inorder to investigate the effect of the recently discovered heat flux buoyancyinstability (hbi) on the evolution of cores. our models follow the3-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics (mhd) of cooling cluster cores and capturethe effects of anisotropic heat conduction along the lines of magnetic field,but do not account for the cosmological setting of clusters or the presence ofagn. our model clusters can be divided into three groups according to theirfinal thermodynamical state: catastrophically collapsing cores, isothermalcores, and an intermediate group whose final state is determined by the initialconfiguration of magnetic field. modeled cores that are reminiscent of realcluster cores show evolution towards thermal collapse on a time scale which isprolonged by a factor of ~2-10 compared with the zero-conduction cases. theprincipal effect of the hbi is to re-orient field lines to be perpendicular tothe temperature gradient. once the field has been wrapped up onto sphericalsurfaces surrounding the core, the core is insulated from further conductiveheating (with the effective thermal conduction suppressed to less than 1/100thof the spitzer value) and proceeds to collapse. we speculate that, in realclusters, the central agn and possibly mergers play the role of "stirrers,"periodically disrupting the azimuthal field structure and allowing thermalconduction to sporadically heat the core.

0908.0023	modeling flows around merging black hole binaries	coalescing massive black hole binaries are produced by the mergers ofgalaxies. the final stages of the black hole coalescence produce stronggravitational radiation that can be detected by the space-borne lisa. in caseswhere the black hole merger takes place in the presence of gas and magneticfields, various types of electromagnetic signals may also be produced. modelingsuch electromagnetic counterparts of the final merger requires evolving thebehavior of both gas and fields in the strong-field regions around the blackholes. we have taken a step towards solving this problem by mapping the flow ofpressureless matter in the dynamic, 3-d general relativistic spacetime aroundthe merging black holes. we find qualitative differences in collision andoutflow speeds, including a signature of the merger when the net angularmomentum of the matter is low, between the results from single and binary blackholes, and between nonrotating and rotating holes in binaries. if futuremagnetohydrodynamic results confirm these differences, it may allow assessmentof the properties of the binaries as well as yielding an identifiableelectromagnetic counterpart to the attendant gravitational wave signal.

1002.3611	connections between local and global turbulence in accretion disks	we analyze a suite of global magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) accretion disksimulations in order to determine whether scaling laws for turbulence driven bythe magnetorotational instability, discovered via local shearing box studies,are globally robust. the simulations model geometrically-thin disks with zeronet magnetic flux and no explicit resistivity or viscosity. we show that thelocal maxwell stress is correlated with the self-generated local verticalmagnetic field in a manner that is similar to that found in local simulations.moreover, local patches of vertical field are strong enough to stimulate andcontrol the strength of angular momentum transport across much of the disk. wedemonstrate the importance of magnetic linkages (through the low-densitycorona) between different regions of the disk in determining the local field,and suggest a new convergence requirement for global simulations -- thevertical extent of the corona must be fully captured and resolved. finally, weexamine the temporal convergence of the average stress, and show that aninitial long-term secular drift in the local flux-stress relation dies away ona time scale that is consistent with turbulent mixing of the initial magneticfield.

1009.1882	low-frequency oscillations in global simulations of black hole accretion	we have identified the presence of large-scale, low-frequency dynamo cyclesin a long-duration, global, magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) simulation of black holeaccretion. such cycles had been seen previously in local shearing boxsimulations, but we discuss their evolution over 1,500 inner disk orbits of aglobal pi/4 disk wedge spanning two orders of magnitude in radius and sevenscale heights in elevation above/below the disk midplane. the observed cyclesmanifest themselves as oscillations in azimuthal magnetic field occupying aregion that extends into a low-density corona several scale heights above thedisk. the cycle frequencies are ten to twenty times lower than the localorbital frequency, making them potentially interesting sources of low-frequencyvariability when scaled to real astrophysical systems. furthermore, powerspectra derived from the full time series reveal that the cycles manifestthemselves at discrete, narrow-band frequencies that often share power acrossbroad radial ranges. we explore possible connections between these simulatedcycles and observed low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (lfqpos) ingalactic black hole binary systems, finding that dynamo cycles have theappropriate frequencies and are located in a spatial region associated withx-ray emission in real systems. derived observational proxies, however, fail tofeature peaks with rms amplitudes comparable to lfqpo observations, suggestingthat further theoretical work and more sophisticated simulations will berequired to form a complete theory of dynamo-driven lfqpos. nonetheless, thiswork clearly illustrates that global mhd dynamos exhibit quasi-periodicbehavior on timescales much longer than those derived from test particleconsiderations.

1103.4863	hydrodynamic models of radio galaxy morphology: winged and x-shaped  sources	we present three-dimensional hydrodynamic models of radio galaxiesinteracting with initially relaxed hot atmospheres and explore the significantoff-axis radio lobe structures which result under certain conditions. with afocus on the "winged" and "x-shaped" radio galaxy population, we confirm theimportance of observed trends such as the connection of wing formation withjets co-aligned with the major axis of the surrounding atmosphere. these wingsare formed substantially by the deflection of lobe plasma flowing back from thehot spots (backflow) and develop in two stages: supersonic expansion of anoverpressured cocoon at early times followed by buoyant expansion at latertimes. we explore a limited parameter space of jet and atmosphere propertiesand find that the most prominent wings are produced when a decaying jet isinjected into a small, dense, highly elliptical atmosphere. on the basis ofthis search, we argue that the deflection of backflow by gradients in the hotatmosphere is a strong candidate for forming observed wings but must work intandem with some other mechanism for forming the initial wing channels. ourmodels indicate that lobe interaction with the hot atmosphere may play adominant role in shaping the morphology of radio galaxies.

1106.4019	global simulations of accretion disks i: convergence and comparisons  with local models	grid-based magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) simulations have proven invaluable forthe study of astrophysical accretion disks. however, the fact that angularmomentum transport in disks is mediated by mhd turbulence (with structure downto very small scales) raises the concern that the properties of the modeledaccretion disks are affected by the finite numerical resolution of thesimulation. by implementing an orbital advection algorithm into the athena codein cylindrical geometry, we have performed a set of global (but unstratified)newtonian disk simulations extending up to resolutions previously unattained.we study the convergence of these models as a function of spatial resolutionand initial magnetic field geometry. the usual viscosity parameter ($\alpha$)or the ratio of thermal-to-magnetic pressure ($\beta$) are found to be poordiagnostics of convergence, whereas the average tilt angle of the magneticfield in the $(r,\phi)$-plane is a very good diagnostic of convergence. wesuggest that this is related to the saturation of the mhd turbulence viaparasitic modes of the magnetorotational instability. even in the case ofzero-net magnetic flux, we conclude that our highest resolution simulations(with 32-zones and 64-zones per vertical scale height) have achievedconvergence.  our global simulations reach resolutions comparable to those used in local,shearing box models of mhd disk turbulence. we find that the saturationpredictors derived from local simulations correspond well to the instantaneouscorrelations between local flux and stress found in our global simulations.however, the conservation of magnetic flux implicit in local models is notrealized in our global disks. thus, the magnetic connectivity of an accretiondisk represents physics that is truly global and cannot be captured in anyab-initio local model.

1202.3442	buoyancy instabilities in a weakly collisional intracluster medium	the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters is a weakly collisional, high-betaplasma in which the transport of heat and momentum occurs primarily alongmagnetic-field lines. anisotropic heat conduction allows convectiveinstabilities to be driven by temperature gradients of either sign, themagnetothermal instability (mti) in the outskirts of non-isothermal clustersand the heat-flux buoyancy-driven instability (hbi) in their cooling cores. weemploy the athena mhd code to investigate the nonlinear evolution of theseinstabilities, self-consistently including the effects of anisotropic viscosity(i.e. braginskii pressure anisotropy), anisotropic conduction, and radiativecooling. we highlight the importance of the microscale instabilities thatinevitably accompany and regulate the pressure anisotropies generated by thehbi and mti. we find that, in all but the innermost regions of cool-coreclusters, anisotropic viscosity significantly impairs the ability of the hbi toreorient magnetic-field lines orthogonal to the temperature gradient. thus,while radio-mode feedback appears necessary in the central few tens of kpc,conduction may be capable of offsetting radiative losses throughout most of acool core over a significant fraction of the hubble time. magnetically-alignedcold filaments are then able to form by local thermal instability. viscousdissipation during the formation of a cold filament produces accompanying hotfilaments, which can be searched for in deep chandra observations of nearbycool-core clusters. in the case of the mti, anisotropic viscosity maintains thecoherence of magnetic-field lines over larger distances than in the inviscidcase, providing a natural lower limit for the scale on which the field canfluctuate freely. in the nonlinear state, the magnetic field exhibits a foldedstructure in which the field-line curvature and field strength areanti-correlated.

0711.4158	broad iron k-alpha emission lines as a diagnostic of black hole spin	we address the ability of broad iron emission lines from black hole accretiondisks to diagnose the spin of the black hole. using a high-resolution3-dimensional mhd simulation of a geometrically-thin accretion disk in apseudo-newtonian potential, we show that both the midplane density and thevertical column density of the accretion flow drop dramatically over a narrowrange of radii close to the innermost stable circular orbit (isco). we arguethat this drop of density is accompanied by a sharp increase in the ionizationparameter of the x-ray photosphere, and that the resulting imprint of the iscoon the x-ray reflection spectrum can be used to constrain spin. motivated bythis simulation, we construct a simplified toy-model of the accretion flowwithin the isco of a kerr black hole, and use this model to estimate thesystematic error on inferred black hole spin that may result from slightbleeding of the iron line emission to the region inside of the isco. we findthat these systematic errors can be significant for slowly spinning black holesbut become appreciably smaller as one considers more rapidly rotating blackholes.

1209.5748	isotropic heating of galaxy cluster cores via rapidly reorienting agn  jets	agn jets carry more than sufficient energy to stave off catastrophic coolingof the intracluster medium (icm) in the cores of cool-core clusters. however,in order to prevent catastrophic cooling, the icm must be heated in anear-isotropic fashion and narrow bipolar jets with $p_{\rm jet}=10^{44-45}$ergs/s, typical of radio agns at cluster centres, are inefficient at heatingthe gas in the transverse direction to the jets. we argue that due to existentconditions in cluster cores, the smbhs will, in addition to accreting gas viaradiatively inefficient flows, experience short stochastic episodes of enhancedaccretion via thin discs. in general, the orientation of these accretion discswill be misaligned with the spin axis of the black holes and the ensuingtorques will cause the black hole's spin axis (and therefore, the jet axis) toslew and rapidly change direction. this model not only explains recentobservations showing successive generations of jet-lobes-bubbles in individualcool-core clusters that are offset from each other in the angular directionwith respect to the cluster center, but also shows that agn jets {\it can} heatthe cluster core nearly isotropically on the gas cooling timescale. our model{\it does} require that the smbhs at the centers of cool-core clusters bespinning relatively slowly. torques from individual misaligned discs areineffective at tilting rapidly spinning black holes by more than a few degrees.additionally, since smbhs that host thin accretion discs will manifest asquasars, we predict that roughly 1--2 rich clusters within $z&lt;0.5$ should havequasars at their centers.

1210.3029	constraints on compton-thick winds from black hole accretion disks: can  we see the inner disk?	strong evidence is emerging that winds can be driven from the central regionsof accretion disks in both active galactic nuclei (agn) and galactic black holebinaries (gbhbs). direct evidence for highly-ionized, compton-thin inner-diskwinds comes from observations of blueshifted (v~0.05-0.1c) iron-k x-rayabsorption lines. however, it has been suggested that the inner regions ofblack hole accretion disks can also drive compton-thick winds --- such windswould enshroud the inner disk, preventing us from seeing direct signatures ofthe accretion disk (i.e. the photospheric thermal emission, or thedoppler/gravitationally broadened iron k-alpha line). here, we show that,provided the source is sub-eddington, the well-established wind drivingmechanisms fail to launch a compton-thick wind from the inner disk. for theaccelerated region of the wind to be compton-thick, the momentum carried in thewind must exceed the available photon momentum by a factor of at least2/lambda, where lambda is the eddington ratio of the source, ruling outradiative acceleration unless the source is very close to the eddington limit.compton-thick winds also carry large mass-fluxes, and a consideration of theconnections between the wind and the disk show this to be incompatible withmagneto-centrifugal driving. finally, thermal driving of the wind is ruled outon the basis of the large compton-radii that typify black hole systems. in theabsence of some new acceleration mechanism, we conclude that the inner regionsof sub-eddington accretion disks around black holes are indeed naked.

1212.5267	prompt emission from tidal disruptions of white dwarfs by intermediate  mass black holes	we present a qualitative picture of prompt emission from tidal disruptions ofwhite dwarfs (wd) by intermediate mass black holes (imbh). the smaller size ofan imbh compared to a supermassive black hole and a smaller tidal radius of awd disruption lead to a very fast event with high peak luminosity. magneticfield is generated in situ following the tidal disruption, which leads toeffective accretion. since large-scale magnetic field is also produced,geometrically thick super-eddington inflow leads to a relativistic jet. thedense jet possesses a photosphere, which emits quasi-thermal radiation in softx-rays. the source can be classified as a long low-luminosity gamma-ray burst(ll-grb). tidal compression of a wd causes nuclear ignition, which isobservable as an accompanying supernova. we suggest that grb060218 and sn2006ajis such a pair of ll-grb and supernova. we argue that in a flux-limited samplethe disruptions of wds by imbhs are more frequent then the disruptions of otherstars by imbhs.

1302.3260	measuring black hole spin using x-ray reflection spectroscopy	i review the current status of x-ray reflection (a.k.a. broad iron line)based black hole spin measurements. this is a powerful technique that allows usto measure robust black hole spins across the mass range, from the stellar-massblack holes in x-ray binaries to the supermassive black holes in activegalactic nuclei. after describing the basic assumptions of this approach, i layout the detailed methodology focusing on "best practices" that have been foundnecessary to obtain robust results. reflecting my own biases, this review isslanted towards a discussion of supermassive black hole (smbh) spin in activegalactic nuclei (agn). pulling together all of the available xmm-newton andsuzaku results from the literature that satisfy objective quality controlcriteria, it is clear that a large fraction of smbhs are rapidly-spinning,although there are tentative hints of a more slowly spinning population at high(m&gt;5*10^7msun) and low (m&lt;2*10^6msun) mass. i also engage in a brief review ofthe spins of stellar-mass black holes in x-ray binaries. in general,reflection-based and continuum-fitting based spin measures are in agreement,although there remain two objects (groj1655-40 and 4u1543-475) for which thatis not true. i end this review by discussing the exciting frontier ofrelativistic reverberation, particularly the discovery of broad iron linereverberation in xmm-newton data for the seyfert galaxies ngc4151, ngc7314 andmcg-5-23-16. as well as confirming the basic paradigm of relativistic diskreflection, this detection of reverberation demonstrates that future large-areax-ray observatories such as loft will make tremendous progress in studies ofstrong gravity using relativistic reverberation in agn.

1305.3230	what is on tap? the role of spin in compact objects and relativistic  jets	we examine the role of spin in launching jets from compact objects across themass scale. our work includes a total of 37 seyferts, 11 stellar-mass blackholes, and 13 neutron stars. we find that when the seyfert reflection lines aremodeled with gaussian line features (a crude proxy for inner disk radius andtherefore spin), only a slight inverse correlation is found between thedoppler-corrected radio luminosity at 5 ghz (a proxy for jet power) and linewidth. when the seyfert reflection features are fit withrelativistically-blurred disk reflection models that measure spin, there is atentative positive correlation between the doppler-corrected radio luminosityand the spin measurement. further, when we include stellar-mass black holes inthe sample, to examine the effects across the mass scale, we find a slightlystronger correlation with radio luminosity per unit mass and spin, at amarginal significance (2.3 sigma confidence level). finally, when we includeneutron stars, in order to probe lower spin values, we find a positivecorrelation (3.3 sigma confidence level) between radio luminosity per unit massand spin. although tentative, these results suggest that spin may have a rolein determining the jet luminosity. in addition, we find a slightly moresignificant correlation (4.4 sigma confidence level) between radio luminosityper bolometric luminosity and spin, using our entire sample of black holes andneutrons stars. again, although tentative, these relations point to thepossibility that the mass accretion rate, i.e. bolometric luminosity, is alsoimportant in determining the jet luminosity, in addition to spin. our analysissuggests that mass accretion rate and disk or coronal magnetic field strengthmay be the "throttle" in these compact systems, to which the eddington limitand spin may set the maximum jet luminosity that can be achieved.

1305.4937	an x-ray view of the jet-cycle in the radio loud agn 3c120	we present a study of the central engine in the broad-line radio galaxy 3c120using a multi-epoch analysis of a deep xmm-newton observation and two deepsuzaku pointings (in 2012). in order to place our spectral data into thecontext of the disk-disruption/jet-ejection cycles displayed by this object, wemonitor the source in the uv/x-ray bands, and in the radio band. we find threestatistically acceptable spectral models, a disk-reflection model, a jet-modeland a jet+disk model. despite being good descriptions of the data, thedisk-reflection model violates the radio constraints on the inclination, andthe jet-model has a fine-tuning problem, requiring a jet contribution exceedingthat expected. thus, we argue for a composite jet+disk model. within thecontext of this model, we verify the basic predictions of the jet-cycleparadigm, finding a truncated/refilling disk during the suzaku observations anda complete disk extending down to the innermost stable circular orbit (isco)during the xmm-newton observation. the idea of a refilling disk is furthersupported by the detection of the ejection of a new jet knot approximately onemonth after the suzaku pointings. we also discover a step-like event in one ofthe suzaku pointings in which the soft band lags the hard band. we suggest thatwe are witnessing the propagation of a disturbance from the disk into the jeton a timescale set by the magnetic field.

1307.3246	the spin of supermassive black holes	black hole spin is a quantity of great interest to both physicists andastrophysicists. we review the current status of spin measurements insupermassive black holes (smbh). to date, every robust smbh spin measurementuses x-ray reflection spectroscopy, so we focus almost exclusively on thistechnique as applied to moderately-luminous active galactic nuclei (agn). afterdescribing the foundations and uncertainties of the method, we summarize thecurrent status of the field. at the time of writing, observations byxmm-newton, suzaku and nustar have given robust spin constraints on 22 smbhs.we find a significant number of rapidly-rotating smbhs (with dimensionless spinparameters a&gt;0.9) although, especially at the higher masses (m&gt;4*10^7msun),there are also some smbhs with intermediate spin parameters. this may be givingus our first hint at a mass-dependent spin distribution which would, in turn,provide interesting constraints on models for smbh growth. we also discuss therecent discovery of relativistic x-ray reverberation which we can use to "echomap" the innermost regions of the accretion disk. the ultimate development ofthese reverberation techniques, when applied to data from futurehigh-throughput x-ray observatories such as loft, athena+, and axsio, willpermit the measurement of black hole spin by a characterization of strong-fieldshapiro delays. we conclude with a brief discussion of other electromagneticmethods that have been attempted or are being developed to constrain smbh spin.

1308.4133	modeling hot gas flow in the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus of  ngc3115	based on the dynamical black hole (bh) mass estimates, ngc3115 hosts theclosest billion solar mass bh. deep studies of the center revealed a veryunderluminous active galactic nucleus (agn) immersed in an old massive nuclearstar cluster. recent $1$~ms \textit{chandra} x-ray visionary projectobservations of the ngc3115 nucleus resolved hot tenuous gas, which fuels theagn. in this paper we connect the processes in the nuclear star cluster withthe feeding of the supermassive bh. we model the hot gas flow sustained by theinjection of matter and energy from the stars and supernova explosions. weincorporate electron heat conduction as the small-scale feedback mechanism, thegravitational pull of the stellar mass, cooling, and coulomb collisions.fitting simulated x-ray emission to the spatially and spectrally resolvedobserved data, we find the best-fitting solutions with $\chi^2/dof=1.00$ for$dof=236$ both with and without conduction. the radial modeling favors a low bhmass $&lt;1.3\times10^{9}m_\odot$. the best-fitting supernova rate and thebest-fitting mass injection rate are consistent with their expected values. thestagnation point is at $r_{\rm st}\lesssim1$arcsec, so that most of gas,including the gas at a bondi radius $r_b=2-4$arcsec, outflows from the region.we put an upper limit on the accretion rate at $2\times10^{-3}m_\odot{\rmyr}^{-1}$. we find a shallow density profile $n\propto r^{-\beta}$ with$\beta\approx1$ over a large dynamic range. this density profile is determinedin the feeding region $0.5-10$arcsec as an interplay of four processes andeffects: (1) the radius-dependent mass injection, (2) the effect of thegalactic gravitational potential, (3) the accretion flow onset at$r\lesssim1$arcsec, and (4) the outflow at $r\gtrsim1$arcsec. the gastemperature is close to the virial temperature $t_v$ at any radius.

0802.0499	a deep chandra observation of abell 4059: a new face to radio-mode agn  feedback?	a deep chandra observation of the cooling core cluster abell 4059 (a4059) ispresented. previous studies have found two x-ray cavities in the centralregions of a4059 together with a ridge of x-ray emission 20kpc south-west ofthe cluster center. these features are clearly related to the radio galaxypks2354-35 which resides in the cd galaxy. our new data confirm these previousfindings and strengthen previous suggestions that the south-western ridge iscolder and denser than, but in approximate pressure equilibrium with, thesurrounding icm atmosphere. in addition, we find evidence for a weak shock thatwraps around the north and east sides of the cavity structure. our data allowus to map the 2-dimensional distribution of metals in the icm of a4059 for thefirst time. we find that the sw ridge possesses an anomalously high(super-solar) metalicity. the unusual morphology, temperature structure andmetal distribution all point to significant asymmetry in the icm atmosphereprior to the onset of radio-galaxy activity. motivated by the very highmetalicity of the sw ridge, we hypothesize that the icm asymmetry was caused bythe extremely rapid stripping of metal enriched gas from a starburst galaxythat plunged through the core of a4059. furthermore, we suggest that the onsetof powerful radio-galaxy activity in the cd galaxy may have been initiated bythis starburst/stripping event, either via the tidal-shocking of cold gasnative to the cd galaxy, or the accretion of cold gas that had been strippedfrom the starburst galaxy.

1402.3591	the hard x-ray perspective on the soft x-ray excess	the x-ray spectra of many active galactic nuclei (agn) exhibit a `softexcess' below 1kev, whose physical origin remains unclear. diverse models havebeen suggested to account for it, including ionised reflection of x-rays fromthe inner part of the accretion disc, ionised winds/absorbers, andcomptonisation. the ionised reflection model suggests a natural link betweenthe prominence of the soft excess and the compton reflection hump strengthabove 10kev, but it has not been clear what hard x-ray signatures, if any, areexpected from the other soft x-ray candidate models. additionally, it has notbeen possible up until recently to obtain high-quality simultaneousmeasurements of both soft and hard x-ray emission necessary to distinguishthese models, but upcoming joint xmm-nustar programmes provide precisely thisopportunity. in this paper, we present an extensive analysis of simulations ofxmm+nustar observations, using two candidate soft excess models as inputs, todetermine whether such campaigns can disambiguate between them by using hardand soft x-ray observations in tandem. the simulated spectra are fit with thesimplest "observer's model" of a black body and neutral reflection tocharacterise the strength of the soft and hard excesses. a plot of the strengthof the hard excess against the soft excess strength provides a diagnostic plotwhich allows the soft excess production mechanism to be determined inindividual sources and samples using current state-of-the-art and nextgeneration hard x-ray enabled observatories. this approach can bestraightforwardly extended to other candidate models for the soft excess.

1408.1696	the role of compton heating in radiation-regulated accretion on to black  holes	we investigate the role of compton heating in radiation-regulated accretionon to black holes from a neutral dense medium using 1d radiation-hydrodynamicsimulations. we focus on the relative effects of compton-heating andphoto-heating as a function of the spectral slope {\alpha}, assuming apower-law spectrum in the energy range of 13.6 ev--100 kev. while comptonheating is dominant only close to the black hole, it can reduce the accretionrate to 0.1 % ($l \propto \dot{m}^2$ model)--0.01 % ($l \propto \dot{m}$ model)of the bondi accretion rate when the bh radiation is hard ({\alpha} ~ 1), where$l$ and $\dot{m}$ are the luminosity and accretion rate normalised by eddingtonrates, respectively. the oscillatory behaviour otherwise typically seen insimulations with {\alpha} &gt; 1, become suppressed when {\alpha} ~ 1 only for the$l \propto \dot{m}$ model. the relative importance of the compton heating overphoto-heating decreases and the oscillatory behaviour becomes stronger as thespectrum softens. when the spectrum is soft ({\alpha} &gt; 1.5), photo-heatingprevails regardless of models making the effect of compton heating negligible.on the scale of the ionization front, where the gas supply into the str\"omgrensphere from large scale is regulated, photo-heating dominates. our simulationsshow consistent results with the advection-dominated accretion flow ($l \propto\dot{m}^2$) where the accretion is inefficient and the spectrum is hard({\alpha} ~ 1).

1408.4803	the x-ray spectrum of the cooling-flow quasar h1821+643 : a massive  black hole feeding off the intracluster medium	we present a deep suzaku observation of h1821+643, an extremely rare exampleof a powerful quasar hosted by the central massive galaxy of a richcooling-core cluster of galaxies. informed by previous chandra studies of thecluster, we achieve a spectral separation of emission from the active galacticnucleus (agn) and the intracluster medium (icm). with a high degree ofconfidence, we identify the signatures of x-ray reflection/reprocessing by coldand slowly moving material in the agn's immediate environment. the ironabundance of this matter is found to be significantly sub-solar (z~0.4zsun), anunusual finding for powerful agn but in line with the idea that this quasar isfeeding from the icm via a compton-induced cooling flow. we also find a subtlesoft excess that can be described phenomenologically (with an additional blackbody component) or as ionized x-ray reflection from the inner regions of a highinclination (i=57 degrees) accretion disk around a spinning (a&gt;0.4) black hole.we describe how the ionization state of the accretion disk can be used toconstrain the eddington fraction of the source. applying these arguments to ourspectrum implies an eddington fraction of 0.25-0.5, with an associated blackhole mass of 3-6x10^9msun.

1506.07175	nustar observations of the powerful radio-galaxy cygnus a	we present nustar observations of the powerful radio galaxy cygnus a,focusing on the central absorbed active galactic nucleus (agn). cygnus a isembedded in a cool-core galaxy cluster, and hence we also examine archivalxmm-newton data to facilitate the decomposition of the spectrum into the agnand intracluster medium (icm) components. nustar gives a source-dominatedspectrum of the agn out to &gt;70kev. in gross terms, the nustar spectrum of theagn has the form of a power law (gamma~1.6-1.7) absorbed by a neutral columndensity of n_h~1.6x10^23 cm^-2. however, we also detect curvature in the hard(&gt;10kev) spectrum resulting from reflection by compton-thick matter out of ourline-of-sight to the x-ray source. compton reflection, possibly from the outeraccretion disk or obscuring torus, is required even permitting a high-energycutoff in the continuum source; the limit on the cutoff energy is e_cut&gt;111kev(90% confidence). interestingly, the absorbed power-law plus reflection modelleaves residuals suggesting the absorption/emission from a fast(15,000-26,000km/s), high column-density (n_w&gt;3x10^23 cm^-2), highly ionized(xi~2,500 erg cm/s) wind. a second, even faster ionized wind component is alsosuggested by these data. we show that the ionized wind likely carries asignificant mass and momentum flux, and may carry sufficient kinetic energy toexercise feedback on the host galaxy. if confirmed, the simultaneous presenceof a strong wind and powerful jets in cygnus a demonstrates that feedback fromradio-jets and sub-relativistic winds are not mutually exclusive phases of agnactivity but can occur simultaneously.

0805.2950	on the time variability of geometrically-thin black hole accretion disks  i : the search for modes in simulated disks	we present a detailed temporal analysis of a set of hydrodynamic andmagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) simulations of geometrically-thin (h/r~0.05) blackhole accretion disks. the black hole potential is approximated by thepaczynski-wiita pseudo-newtonian potential. in particular, we use oursimulations to critically assess two widely discussed models for high-frequencyquasi-periodic oscillations, global oscillation modes (diskoseismology) andparametric resonance instabilities. we find that initially disturbedhydrodynamic disks clearly display the trapped global g-mode oscillationpredicted by linear perturbation theory. in contrast, the sustained turbulenceproduced in the simulated mhd disks by the magneto-rotational instability doesnot excite these trapped g-modes. we cannot say at present whether the mhdturbulence actively damps the hydrodynamic g-mode. our simulated mhd disks alsofail to display any indications of a parametric resonance instability betweenthe vertical and radial epicyclic frequencies. on the other hand, we do seecharacteristic frequencies at any given radius in the disk corresponding tolocal acoustic waves. we also conduct a blind search for any quasi-periodicoscillation in a proxy lightcurve based on the instantaneous mass accretionrate of the black hole, and place an upper limit of 2% on the total power inany such feature. we highlight the importance of correcting for secular changesin the simulated accretion disk when performing temporal analyses.

1507.03996	accretion disk dynamo as the trigger for x-ray binary state transitions	magnetohydrodynamic accretion disk simulations suggest that much of theenergy liberated by the magnetorotational instability (mri) can be channeledinto large-scale toroidal magnetic fields through dynamo action. under certainconditions, this field can dominate over gas and radiation pressure inproviding vertical support against gravity, even close to the midplane. using asimple model for the creation of this field, its buoyant rise, and its couplingto the gas, we show how disks could be driven into this magnetically dominatedstate and deduce the resulting vertical pressure and density profiles. applyingan established criterion for mri to operate in the presence of a toroidalfield, we show that magnetically supported disks can have two distinctmri-active regions, separated by a "dead zone" where local mri is suppressed,but where magnetic energy continues to flow upward from the dynamo regionbelow. we suggest that the relative strengths of the mri zones, and the localpoloidal flux, determine the spectral states of x-ray binaries. specifically,"intermediate" and "hard" accretion states occur when mri is triggered in thehot, upper zone of the corona, while disks in "soft" states do not develop theupper mri zone. we discuss the conditions under which various transitionsshould take place and speculate on the relationship of dynamo activity to thevarious types of quasi-periodic oscillations that sometimes appear in the hardspectral components. the model also explains why luminous accretion disks inthe "soft" state show no signs of the thermal/viscous instability predicted bystandard alpha models.

1510.07638	unwrapping the x-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei	active galactic nuclei (agn) are complex phenomena. at the heart of an agn isa relativistic accretion disk around a spinning supermassive black hole (smbh)with an x-ray emitting corona and, sometimes, a relativistic jet. on largerscales, the outer accretion disk and molecular torus act as the reservoirs ofgas for the continuing agn activity. and on all scales from the black holeoutwards, powerful winds are seen that probably affect the evolution of thehost galaxy as well as regulate the feeding of the agn itself. in this reviewarticle, we discuss how x-ray spectroscopy can be used to study each of thesecomponents. we highlight how recent measurements of the high-energy cutoff inthe x-ray continuum by nustar are pushing us to conclude that x-ray coronae areradiatively-compact and have electron temperatures regulated byelectron-positron pair production. we show that the predominance ofrapidly-rotating objects in current surveys of smbh spin is entirelyunsurprising once one accounts for the observational selection bias resultingfrom the spin-dependence of the radiative efficiency. we review recent progressin our understanding of fast (v~0.1-0.3c), highly-ionized (mainly visible infexxv and fexxvi lines), high-column density winds that may dominatequasar-mode galactic feedback. finally, we end with a brief look forward to thepromise of astro-h and future x-ray spectropolarimeters.

1511.03271	inefficient driving of bulk turbulence by active galactic nuclei in a  hydrodynamic model of the intracluster medium	central jetted active galactic nuclei (agn) appear to heat the core regionsof the intracluster medium (icm) in cooling-core galaxy clusters and groups,thereby preventing a cooling catastrophe. however, the physical mechanism(s) bywhich the directed flow of kinetic energy is thermalized throughout the icmcore remains unclear. we examine one widely discussed mechanism whereby the agninduces subsonic turbulence in the ambient medium, the dissipation of whichprovides the icm heat source. through controlled inviscid 3-d hydrodynamicsimulations, we verify that explosive agn-like events can launch gravity waves(g-modes) into the ambient icm which in turn decay to volume-fillingturbulence. in our model, however, this process is found to be inefficient,with less than 1% of the energy injected by the agn activity actually ending upin the turbulence of the ambient icm. this efficiency is an order of magnitudeor more too small to explain the observations of agn-feedback in galaxyclusters and groups with short central cooling times. atmospheres in which theg-modes are strongly trapped/confined have an even lower efficiency since, inthese models, excitation of turbulence relies on the g-modes' ability to escapefrom the center of the cluster into the bulk icm. our results suggest that, ifagn-induced turbulence is indeed the mechanism by which the agn heats the icmcore, its driving may rely on physics beyond that captured in our idealhydrodynamic model.

astro-ph;0010125	asca observation of an x-ray-luminous active nucleus in markarian 231	we have obtained a moderately long (100 kilosecond) asca observation of theseyfert 1 galaxy markarian 231, the most luminous of the local ultraluminousinfrared galaxy (ulirg) population. in the best-fitting model we do not see thex-ray source directly; the spectrum consists of a scattered power-law componentand a reflection component, both of which have been absorbed by a column n_h\approx 3 x 10^(22)/cm^2. about 3/4 of the observed hard x-rays arise from thescattered component, reducing the equivalent width of the iron k alpha line.the implied ratio of 1-10 kev x-ray luminosity to bolometric luminosity,l_x/l_bol \sim 2%, is typical of sy 1 galaxies and radio-quiet qsos ofcomparable bolometric luminosities, and indicates that the bolometricluminosity is dominated by the agn. our estimate of the x-ray luminosity alsomoves mrk 231 in line with the correlations found for agn with extremely strongfe ii emission. a second source separated by about 2 arcminutes is also clearlydetected, and contributes about 25% of the total flux.

astro-ph;0110028	a variable efficiency for thin disk black hole accretion	we explore the presence of torques at the inner edges of geometrically-thinblack hole accretion disks using 3-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (mhd)simulations in a pseudo-newtonian potential. by varying the saturation level ofthe magnetorotational instability that leads to angular momentum transport, weshow that the dynamics of gas inside the radius of marginal stability variesdepending upon the magnetic field strength just outside that radius. weakfields are unable to causally connect material within the plunging region tothe rest of the disk, and zero torque is an approximately correct boundarycondition at the radius of marginal stability. stronger fields, which we obtainartificially but which may occur physically within more complete disk models,are able to couple at least some parts of the plunging region to the rest ofthe disk. in this case, angular momentum (and implicitly energy) is extractedfrom the material in the plunging region. furthermore, the magnetic coupling tothe plunging region can be highly time dependent with large fluctuations in thetorque at the radius of marginal stability. this implies varying accretionefficiencies, both across systems and within a given system at different times.the results suggest a possible link between changes in x-ray and outflowactivity, with both being driven by transitions between weak and strong fieldstates.

astro-ph;0302271	the variability of accretion onto schwarzschild black holes from  turbulent magnetized discs	we use global magnetohydrodynamic simulations, in a pseudo-newtonianpotential, to investigate the temporal variability of accretion discs aroundschwarzschild black holes. we use the vertically-averaged magnetic stress inthe simulated disc as a proxy for the rest-frame dissipation, and compute theobserved emission by folding this through the transfer function describing therelativistic beaming, light bending and time delays near a non-rotating blackhole. the temporal power spectrum of the predicted emission from individualannuli in the disc is described by a broken power law, with indices of -3.5 athigh frequency and 0 to -1 at low frequency. integrated over the disc, thepower spectrum is approximated by a single power law with an index of -2.increasing inclination boosts the relative power at frequencies of around 0.3times the orbital frequency at the marginally stable orbit, but no evidence isfound for sharp quasi-periodic oscillations in the lightcurve. assuming thatfluorescent iron line emission locally tracks the continuum flux, we computesimulated broad iron line profiles. we find that relativistic beaming of thenon-axisymmetric emission profile, induced by turbulence, produceshigh-amplitude variability in the iron line profile. we show that thissubstructure within the broad iron line profile can survive averaging over anumber of orbital periods, and discuss the origin of the anomalous x-rayspectral features, recently reported by turner et al.

astro-ph;0402632	buoyant radio-lobes in a viscous intracluster medium	(abridged) ideal hydrodynamic models of the intracluster medium (icm) in thecore regions of galaxy clusters fail to explain both the observed temperaturestructure of this gas, and the observed morphology of radio-galaxy/icminteractions. it has recently been suggested that, even in the presence ofreasonable magnetic fields, thermal conduction in the icm may be crucial forreproducing the temperature floor seen in many systems. if this is indeedcorrect, it raises the possibility that other transport processes may beimportant. with this motivation, we present a numerical investigation of thebuoyant evolution of agn-blown cavities in icm that has a non-negligible shearviscosity. we use the zeus-mp code to follow the 3-d evolution of an initiallystatic, hot bubble in a beta-model icm atmosphere with varying degrees of shearviscosity. with no explicit viscosity, it is found that the combined action ofrayleigh-taylor and kelvin-helmholtz instabilities shred the icm cavity and onedoes not reproduce the intact and detached ``ghost cavities'' observed insystems such as perseus-a. on the other hand, even a modest level of shearviscosity can be important in quenching the fluid instabilities and maintainingthe integrity of the bubble. in particular, we show that the morphology of thenw ghost cavity found in perseus-a can be reproduced, as can the flow patterninferred from the morphology of h-alpha filaments. finally, we discuss thepossible relevance of icm viscosity to the fact that many of the active icmcavities are not bounded by strong shocks.

astro-ph;0411764	the interaction of 3c401 with the surrounding intracluster medium	we present an observation of the radio-galaxy 3c401 and the surroundingintracluster medium (icm) of its host galaxy cluster by the chandra x-rayobservatory. this luminous radio-galaxy is notable in that it hascharacteristics intermediate between the fri and frii morphologies. we clearlydetect point-like emission coincident with the radio-core of 3c401, althoughthe spatial resolution of even chandra is only 2kpc at the distance of 3c401(z=0.201) and so the possibility remains that this is a dense (and rapidlycooling) thermal gaseous core in the center of the icm atmosphere. strongdepartures from spherical symmetry in the central 10-20kpc of the icm clearlysuggest interaction between the icm and the radio-lobes of 3c401. a centralx-ray bar probably results from the evacuation of two icm cavities by theexpanding radio lobes. beyond these central regions, the cluster possesses aflatter profile than many clusters of comparable mass suggesting the importanceof icm heating and entropy injection by 3c401. we detect an interestingcross-like structure in the icm on 100kpc scales. we speculate that this couldbe a radio-galaxy induced disturbance corresponding to a time when 3c401 wassubstantially more powerful. a particularly exciting possibility is that thiscross-like structure corresponds to a large scale global g-mode oscillationexcited by a past outburst of 3c401.

astro-ph;0501455	sporadically torqued accretion disks around black holes	the assumption that black hole accretion disks possess an untorqued innerboundary, the so-called zero torque boundary condition, has been employed bymodels of black hole disks for many years. however, recent theoretical andobservational work suggests that magnetic forces may appreciably torque theinner disk. this raises the question of the effect that a time-changingmagnetic torque may have on the evolution of such a disk. in particular, weexplore the suggestion that the ``deep minimum state'' of the seyfert galaxymcg--6-30-15 can be identified as a sporadic inner disk torquing event. thissuggestion is motivated by detailed analyses of changes in the profile of thebroad fluorescence iron line in xmm-newton spectra. we find that the responseof such a disk to a torquing event has two phases; an initial damming of theaccretion flow together with a partial draining of the disk interior to thetorque location, followed by a replenishment of the inner disk as the systemachieves a new (torqued) steady-state. if the deep minimum state ofmcg--6-30-15 is indeed due to a sporadic torquing event, we show that thefraction of the dissipated energy going into x-rays must be smaller in thetorqued state. we propose one such scenario in which compton cooling of thedisk corona by ``returning radiation'' accompanying a central-torquing eventsuppresses the 0.5-10 kev x-ray flux coming from all but the innermost regionsof the disk.

astro-ph;0511501	agn feedback and cooling flows: problems with simple hydrodynamical  models	in recent years it has become increasingly clear that active galactic nuclei,and radio-galaxies in particular, have an impact on large scale structure andgalaxy formation. in principle, radio-galaxies are energetic enough to halt thecooling of the virialized intracluster medium (icm) in the inner regions ofgalaxy clusters, solving the cooling flow problem and explaining the high-masstruncation of the galaxy luminosity function. we explore this process through aseries of high resolution, three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of jettedactive galaxies that act in response to cooling-mediated accretion of an icmatmosphere. we find that our models are incapable of producing a long termbalance of heating and cooling; catastrophic cooling can be delayed by the jetaction but inevitably takes hold. at the heart of the failure of these modelsis the formation of a low density channel through which the jet can freelyflow, carrying its energy out of the cooling core. it is possible that thisfailure is due to an over-simplified treatment of the fast jet (which mayunderestimate the ``dentist drill'' effect). however, it seems likely thatadditional complexity (large-angle jet precession or icm turbulence) oradditional physics (magnetohydrodynamic effects and plasma transport processes)is required to produce a spatial distribution of jet heating that can preventcatastrophic cooling. this work also underscores the importance of includingjet dynamics in any feedback model as opposed to the isotropically inflatedbubble approach taken in some previous works.

astro-ph;0602165	the influence of radio-galaxy activity on x-ray absorption lines from  the intracluster medium	we present an investigation of the x-ray absorption features predicted byhydrodynamic simulations of radio galaxies interacting with the intraclustermedium (icm) of their host galaxy clusters. we show how these absorption linescan be used as a new diagnostic for the radio-galaxy/icm interactions. suchinteractions have been observed in numerous systems by rosat, chandra andxmm-newton, and understanding them has implications for agn feedback and galaxyformation. starting from the hydrodynamic simulations of reynolds, heinz &amp;begelman, we calculate the properties of the highly ionized iron and oxygenlines (seen in absorption against the central active galactic nucleus; agn),predicting line shapes, equivalent widths, column densities and velocityshifts. the main effect of the jet on the absorption lines is a reduction ofthe line strength from that of the quiescent icm and the introduction of somevelocity structure in the line profile. we investigate whether these featuresare detectable with current as well as future high-resolution x-rayspectrometers. we conclude that the chandra transmission gratings haveinsufficient sensitivity to detect these features with high significance, andcertainly would not allow a study of the dynamics of the interaction viaabsorption signatures. constellation-x, on the other hand, will allow superbconstraints to be derived. we can also use this analysis to assess the ideathat radio-galaxy induced icm outflows give rise to the resonant oxygen x-rayabsorption lines that have been claimed as evidence for the warm-hotintergalactic medium (whim). we show that these detached, high-velocity oxygenabsorption lines cannot result from a radio-galaxy/icm interaction, therebystrengthening the whim interpretation.

astro-ph;0607381	trapping of magnetic flux by the plunge region of a black hole accretion  disk	the existence of the radius of marginal stability means that accretion flowsaround black holes invariably undergo a transition from a mhd turbulentdisk-like flow to an inward plunging flow. we argue that the plunging inflowcan greatly enhance the trapping of large scale magnetic field on the blackhole, and therefore may increase the importance of the blandford-znajek (bz)effect relative to previous estimates that ignore the plunge region. we supportthis hypothesis by constructing and analyzing a toy-model of the dragging andtrapping of a large scale field by a black hole disk, revealing a strongdependence of this effect on the effective magnetic prandtl number of the mhdturbulent disk. furthermore, we show that the enhancement of the bz effectdepends on the geometric thickness of the accretion disk. this may be, at leastin part, the physical underpinnings of the empirical relation between theinferred geometric thickness of a black hole disk and the presence of a radiojet.

astro-ph;0608502	constraining black hole spin via x-ray spectroscopy	we present an analysis of the observed broad iron line feature and putativewarm absorber in the long 2001 xmm-newton observation of the seyfert-1.2 galaxymcg-6-30-15. the new "kerrdisk" model we have designed for simulating lineemission from accretion disk systems allows black hole spin to be a freeparameter in the fit, enabling the user to formally constrain the angularmomentum of a black hole, among other physical parameters of the system. in animportant extension of previous work, we derive constraints on the black holespin in mcg-6-30-15 using a self-consistent model for x-ray reflection from thesurface of the accretion disk while simultaneously accounting for absorption bydusty photoionized material along the line of sight (the warm absorber). evenincluding these complications, the xmm-newton/epic-pn data require extremerelativistic broadening of the x-ray reflection spectrum; assuming no emissionfrom within the radius of marginal stability, we derive a formal constraint onthe dimensionless black hole spin parameter of a &gt; 0.987 at 90% confidence. theprincipal unmodeled effect that can significantly reduce the inferred blackhole spin is powerful emission from within the radius of marginal stability.although significant theoretical developments are required to fully understandthis region, we argue that the need for a rapidly spinning black hole is robustto physically plausible levels of emission from within the radius of marginalstability. in particular, we show that a non-rotating black hole is stronglyruled out.

astro-ph;0610369	elemental abundances of nearby galaxies through high signal-to-noise  xmm-newton observations of ulxs	(abridged) in this paper, we examined xmm newton epic spectra of 14ultra-luminous x-ray sources (ulxs)in addition to the xmm rgs spectra of twosources (holmberg ii x-1 and holmberg ix x-1). we determined oxygen and ironabundances of the host galaxy's interstellar medium (ism) using k-shell (o) andl-shell (fe) x-ray photo-ionization edges towards these ulxs. we found that theoxygen abundances closely matched recent solar abundances for all of oursources, implying that ulxs live in similar local environments despite the widerange of galaxy host properties. also, we compare the x-ray hydrogen columndensities (n_h) for 8 ulx sources with column densities obtained from radio h iobservations. the x-ray model n_h values are in good agreement with the h i n_hvalues, implying that the hydrogen absorption towards the ulxs is not local tothe source (with the exception of the source m81 xmm1). in order to obtain thecolumn density and abundance values, we fit the x-ray spectra of the ulxs witha combined power law and one of several accretion disk models. we tested theabundances obtained from the xspec models bbody, diskbb, grad, and diskpn alongwith a power law, finding that the abundances were independent of the thermalmodel used. we comment on the physical implications of these different modelfits. we also note that very deep observations allow a breaking of thedegeneracy noted by stobbart et al. (2006) favoring a high mass solution forthe absorbed grad + power law model.

0809.2090	suzaku observations of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we report the results from our analysis of {\it suzaku} xis (0.5-10 kev) andhxd/pin (15-40 kev) observations of five well-known local ulirgs: {\em iras}f05189-2524, {\em iras} f08572+3915, mrk 273, pks 1345+12, and arp 220. the xisobservations of f05189-2524 and mrk 273 reveal strong iron lines consistentwith fe k$\alpha$ and changes in spectral shapes with respect to previous {\itchandra} and {\it xmm-newton} observations. mrk 273 is also detected by thehxd/pin at $\sim$1.8-$\sigma$. for f05189-2524, modeling of the data from thedifferent epochs suggests that the change in spectral shape is likely due tothe central source switching off, leaving behind a residual reflectionspectrum, or an increase in the absorbing column. an increase in the coveringfraction of the absorber can describe the spectral variations seen in mrk 273,although a reduction in the intrinsic agn luminosity cannot be formally ruledout. the {\it suzaku} spectra of mrk 273 are well fit by a ~94% coveringfraction model with a column density of $\sim10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. theabsorption-corrected log[$l_{\rm 2-10 kev}$ / $l_{\rm ir}$] ratio is consistentwith those found in pg quasars. the 0.5-10 kev spectrum of pks 1345+12 and arp220 seem unchanged from previous observations and their hard x-ray emission isnot convincingly detected by the hxd/pin. the large column density derived fromco observations and the large equivalent width of an ionized fe line in arp 220can be reconciled by an ionized reflection model. f08572+3915 is undetected inboth the xis and hxd/pin, but the analysis of unpublished {\em chandra} dataprovides a new measurement at low energies.

astro-ph;9705136	iron fluorescence from within the innermost stable orbit of black hole  accretion disks	the fluorescent iron ka line is a powerful observational probe of the innerregions of black holes accretion disks. previous studies have assumed that onlymaterial outside the radius of marginal stability can contribute to theobserved line emission. here, we show that fluorescence by material inside theradius of marginal stability, which is in the process of spiralling towards theevent horizon, can have a observable influence on the iron line profile andequivalent width. for concreteness, we consider the case of a geometricallythin accretion disk, around a schwarzschild black hole, in which fluorescenceis excited by an x-ray source placed at some height above the disk and on theaxis of the disk. fully relativistic line profiles are presented for varioussource heights and efficiencies. it is found that the extra line flux generallyemerges in the extreme red wing of the iron line, due to the largegravitational redshift experienced by photons from the region within the radiusof marginal stability. we apply our models to the variable iron line seen inthe asca spectrum of the seyfert nucleus mcg-6-30-15. it is found that thechange in the line profile, equivalent width, and continuum normalization, canbe well explained as being due to a change in the height of the source abovethe disk. we discuss the implications of these results for distinguishingrapidly-rotating black holes from slowly rotating holes using iron linediagnostics.

0810.2543	probing the accretion disk and central engine structure of ngc4258 with  suzaku and xmm-newton observations	[abridged] we present an x-ray study of the low-luminosity active galacticnucleus (agn) in ngc4258 using data from suzaku, xmm-newton, and the swift/batsurvey. we find that signatures of x-ray reprocessing by cold gas are very weakin the spectrum of this seyfert-2 galaxy; a weak, narrow fluorescent-kalphaemission line of cold iron is robustly detected in both the suzaku andxmm-newton spectra but at a level much below that of most other seyfert-2galaxies. we conclude that the circumnuclear environment of this agn is very"clean" and lacks the compton-thick obscuring torus of unified seyfert schemes.  from the narrowness of the iron line, together with evidence for line fluxvariability between the suzaku and xmm-newton observations, we constrain theline emitting region to be between $3\times 10^3r_g$ and $4\times 10^4r_g$ fromthe black hole. we show that the observed properties of the iron line can beexplained if the line originates from the surface layers of a warped accretiondisk. in particular, we present explicit calculations of the expected iron linefrom a disk warped by lens-thirring precession from a misaligned central blackhole. finally, the suzaku data reveal clear evidence for large amplitude2-10kev variability on timescales of 50ksec as well as smaller amplitude flareson timescales as short as 5-10ksec. if associated with accretion diskprocesses, such rapid variability requires an origin in the innermost regionsof the disk ($r\approx 10r_g$ or less).

0812.0365	on the time variability of geometrically-thin black hole accretion disks  ii: viscosity-induced global oscillation modes in simulated disks	we examine the evolution and influence of viscosity-induced diskoseismicmodes in simulated black hole accretion disks. understanding the origin andbehavior of such oscillations will help us to evaluate their potential role inproducing astronomically observed high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations inaccreting black hole binary systems.  our simulated disks are geometrically-thin with a constant half-thickness offive percent the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit. apseudo-newtonian potential reproduces the relevant effects of generalrelativity, and an alpha-model viscosity achieves angular momentum transportand the coupling of orthogonal velocity components in an otherwise idealhydrodynamic numerical treatment.  we find that our simulated viscous disks characteristically develop andmaintain trapped global mode oscillations with properties similar to thoseexpected of trapped g-modes and inner p-modes in a narrow range of frequenciesjust below the maximum radial epicyclic frequency. although the modes aredriven in the inner portion of the disk, they generate waves that propagate atthe trapped mode frequencies out to larger disk radii. this finding iscontrasted with the results of global magnetohydrodynamic disk simulations, inwhich such oscillations are not easily identified. such examples underscorefundamental physical differences between accretion systems driven by themagneto-rotational instability and those for which alpha viscosity serves as aproxy for the physical processes that drive accretion, and we explore potentialapproaches to the search for diskoseismic modes in full magnetohydrodynamicdisks.
