0706.2566	an anomaly detector with immediate feedback to hunt for planets of earth  mass and below by microlensing	(abridged) the discovery of ogle 2005-blg-390lb, the first cool rocky/icyexoplanet, impressively demonstrated the sensitivity of the microlensingtechnique to extra-solar planets below 10 m_earth. a planet of 1 m_earth in thesame spot would have provided a detectable deviation with an amplitude of ~ 3 %and a duration of ~ 12 h. an early detection of a deviation could triggerhigher-cadence sampling which would have allowed the discovery of an earth-massplanet in this case. here, we describe the implementation of an automatedanomaly detector, embedded into the estar system, that profits from immediatefeedback provided by the robotic telescopes that form the robonet-1.0 network.it went into operation for the 2007 microlensing observing season. as part ofour discussion about an optimal strategy for planet detection, we shed some newlight on whether concentrating on highly-magnified events is promising andplanets in the 'resonant' angular separation equal to the angular einsteinradius are revealed most easily. given that sub-neptune mass planets can beconsidered being common around the host stars probed by microlensing(preferentially m- and k-dwarfs), the higher number of events that can bemonitored with a network of 2m telescopes and the increased detectionefficiency for planets below 5 m_earth arising from an optimized strategy givesa common effort of current microlensing campaigns a fair chance to detect anearth-mass planet (from the ground) ahead of the corot or kepler missions. thedetection limit of gravitational microlensing extends even below 0.1 m_earth,but such planets are not very likely to be detected from current campaigns.however, these will be within the reach of high-cadence monitoring with anetwork of wide-field telescopes or a space-based telescope.

0903.2139	high-precision photometry by telescope defocussing. i. the transiting  planetary system wasp-5	we present high-precision photometry of two transit events of the extrasolarplanetary system wasp-5, obtained with the danish 1.54m telescope at eso lasilla. in order to minimise both random and flat-fielding errors, we defocussedthe telescope so its point spread function approximated an annulus of diameter40 pixels (16 arcsec). data reduction was undertaken using standard aperturephotometry plus an algorithm for optimally combining the ensemble of comparisonstars. the resulting light curves have point-to-point scatters of 0.50 mmag forthe first transit and 0.59 mmag for the second. we construct detailed signal tonoise calculations for defocussed photometry, and apply them to ourobservations. we model the light curves with the jktebop code and combine theresults with tabulated predictions from theoretical stellar evolutionary modelsto derive the physical properties of the wasp-5 system. we find that the planethas a mass of m_b = 1.637 +/- 0.075 +/- 0.033 mjup, a radius of r_b = 1.171 +/-0.056 +/- 0.012 rjup, a large surface gravity of g_b = 29.6 +/- 2.8 m/s2 and adensity of rho_b = 1.02 +/- 0.14 +/- 0.01 rhojup (statistical and systematicuncertainties). the planet's high equilibrium temperature of t_eq = 1732 +/- 80k makes it a good candidate for detecting secondary eclipses.

0907.3471	mass measurement of a single unseen star and planetary detection  efficiency for ogle 2007-blg-050	we analyze ogle-2007-blg-050, a high magnification microlensing event (a ~432) whose peak occurred on 2 may, 2007, with pronounced finite-source andparallax effects. we compute planet detection efficiencies for this event inorder to determine its sensitivity to the presence of planets around the lensstar. both finite-source and parallax effects permit a measurement of theangular einstein radius \theta_e = 0.48 +/- 0.01 mas and the parallax \pi_e =0.12 +/- 0.03, leading to an estimate of the lens mass m = 0.50 +/- 0.14 m_sunand its distance to the observer d_l = 5.5 +/- 0.4 kpc. this is only the seconddetermination of a reasonably precise (&lt;30%) mass estimate for an isolatedunseen object, using any method. this allows us to calculate the planetarydetection efficiency in physical units (r_\perp, m_p), where r_\perp is theprojected planet-star separation and m_p is the planet mass. when computingplanet detection efficiency, we did not find any planetary signature and ourdetection efficiency results reveal significant sensitivity to neptune-massplanets, and to a lesser extent earth-mass planets in some configurations.indeed, jupiter and neptune-mass planets are excluded with a high confidencefor a large projected separation range between the planet and the lens star,respectively [0.6 - 10] and [1.4 - 4] au, and earth-mass planets are excludedwith a 10% confidence in the lensing zone, i.e. [1.8 - 3.1] au.

0911.5581	interpretation of strong short-term central perturbations in the light  curves of moderate-magnification microlensing events	to improve the planet detection efficiency, current planetary microlensingexperiments are focused on high-magnification events searching for planetarysignals near the peak of lensing light curves. however, it is known thatcentral perturbations can also be produced by binary companions and thus it isimportant to distinguish planetary signals from those induced by binarycompanions. in this paper, we analyze the light curves of microlensing eventsogle-2007-blg-137/moa-2007-blg-091, ogle-2007-blg-355/moa-2007-blg-278, andmoa-2007-blg-199/ogle-2007-blg-419, for all of which exhibit short-termperturbations near the peaks of the light curves. from detailed modeling of thelight curves, we find that the perturbations of the events are caused by binarycompanions rather than planets. from close examination of the light curvescombined with the underlying physical geometry of the lens system obtained frommodeling, we find that the short time-scale caustic-crossing feature occurringat a low or a moderate base magnification with an additional secondaryperturbation is a typical feature of binary-lens events and thus can be usedfor the discrimination between the binary and planetary interpretations.

1004.0386	the effect of metallicity on the detection prospects for gravitational  waves	data from the sdss (300,000 galaxies) indicates that recent star formation(within the last 1 billion years) is bimodal: half the stars form from gas withhigh amounts of metals (solar metallicity), and the other half form with smallcontribution of elements heavier than helium (10-30% solar). theoreticalstudies of mass loss from the brightest stars derive significantly higherstellar-origin bh masses (30-80 msun) than previously estimated for sub-solarcompositions. we combine these findings to estimate the probability ofdetecting gravitational waves (gws) arising from the inspiral of double compactobjects. our results show that a low metallicity environment significantlyboosts the formation of double compact object binaries with at least one bh. inparticular, we find the gw detection rate is increased by a factor of 20 if themetallicity is decreased from solar (as in all previous estimates) to a 50-50mixture of solar and 10% solar metallicity. the current sensitivity of the twolargest instruments to ns-ns binary inspirals (virgo: 9 mpc; ligo: 18) is nothigh enough to ensure a first detection. however, our results indicate that ifa future instrument increased the sensitivity to 50-100 mpc, a detection of gwswould be expected within the first year of observation. it was previouslythought that ns-ns inspirals were the most likely source for gw detection. ourresults indicate that bh-bh binaries are 25-times more likely sources thanns-ns systems and that we are on the cusp of gw detection.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

1008.1033	compact object detection in self-lensing binary systems with a  main-sequence star	detecting compact objects by means of their gravitational lensing effect onan observed companion in a binary system has already been suggested almost fourdecades ago. however, these predictions were made even before the firstobservations of gravitational lensing, whereas nowadays gravitationalmicrolensing surveys towards the galactic bulge yield almost 1000 events peryear where one star magnifies the light of a more distant one. with a specificview on those experiments, we therefore carry out simulations to assess theprospects for detection of the transient periodic magnification of thecompanion star, which lasts typically only a few hours binaries involving amain-sequence star. we find that detectability is given by the achievability ofdense monitoring with the required photometric accuracy. in sharp contrast toearlier expectations by other authors, we find that main-sequence stars are notsubstantially less favourable targets to observe this effect than white dwarfs.the requirement of an almost edge-on orbit leads to a probability of the orderof $3 \times 10^{-4}$ for spotting the signature of an existing compact objectin a binary system with this technique. assuming an abundance of such systemsabout 0.4 per cent, a high-cadence monitoring every 15~min with 5 per centphotometric accuracy would deliver a signal rate per target star of $\gamma\sim 4 \times 10^{-7}~\mbox{yr}^{-1}$ at a recurrence period of about 6 months.with microlensing surveys having demonstrated the capability to monitor about$2 \times 10^{8}$ stars, one is therefore provided with the chance to detectroughly semi-annually recurring self-lensing signals from several compactcompacts in a binary system. if the photometric accuracy was pushed down to 0.3per cent, 10 times as many signals would become detectable.

1104.5094	ogle-2005-blg-018: characterization of full physical and orbital  parameters of a gravitational binary lens	we present the analysis result of a gravitational binary-lensing eventogle-2005-blg-018. the light curve of the event is characterized by 2 adjacentstrong features and a single weak feature separated from the strong features.the light curve exhibits noticeable deviations from the best-fit model based onstandard binary parameters. to explain the deviation, we test models includingvarious higher-order effects of the motions of the observer, source, and lens.from this, we find that it is necessary to account for the orbital motion ofthe lens in describing the light curve. from modeling of the light curveconsidering the parallax effect and keplerian orbital motion, we are able tomeasure not only the physical parameters but also a complete orbital solutionof the lens system. it is found that the event was produced by a binary lenslocated in the galactic bulge with a distance $6.7\pm 0.3$ kpc from the earth.the individual lens components with masses $0.9\pm 0.3\ m_\odot$ and $0.5\pm0.1\ m_\odot$ are separated with a semi-major axis of $a=2.5 \pm 1.0$ au andorbiting each other with a period $p=3.1 \pm 1.3$ yr. the event demonstratesthat it is possible to extract detailed information about binary lens systemsfrom well-resolved lensing light curves.

1204.2869	characterizing low-mass binaries from observation of long time-scale  caustic-crossing gravitational microlensing events	despite astrophysical importance of binary star systems, detections arelimited to those located in small ranges of separations, distances, and massesand thus it is necessary to use a variety of observational techniques for acomplete view of stellar multiplicity across a broad range of physicalparameters. in this paper, we report the detections and measurements of 2binaries discovered from observations of microlensing events moa-2011-blg-090and ogle-2011-blg-0417. determinations of the binary masses are possible bysimultaneously measuring the einstein radius and the lens parallax. themeasured masses of the binary components are 0.43 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.39$m_{\odot}$ for moa-2011-blg-090 and 0.57 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.17 $m_{\odot}$ forogle-2011-blg-0417 and thus both lens components of moa-2011-blg-090 and onecomponent of ogle-2011-blg-0417 are m dwarfs, demonstrating the usefulness ofmicrolensing in detecting binaries composed of low-mass components. frommodeling of the light curves considering full keplerian motion of the lens, wealso measure the orbital parameters of the binaries. the blended light ofogle-2011-blg-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself, making it possibleto check the microlensing orbital solution by follow-up radial-velocityobservation. for both events, the caustic-crossing parts of the light curves,which are critical for determining the physical lens parameters, were resolvedby high-cadence survey observations and thus it is expected that the number ofmicrolensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase in thefuture.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1205.6323	moa-2010-blg-477lb: constraining the mass of a microlensing planet from  microlensing parallax, orbital motion and detection of blended light	microlensing detections of cool planets are important for the construction ofan unbiased sample to estimate the frequency of planets beyond the snow line,which is where giant planets are thought to form according to the coreaccretion theory of planet formation. in this paper, we report the discovery ofa giant planet detected from the analysis of the light curve of ahigh-magnification microlensing event moa-2010-blg-477. the measuredplanet-star mass ratio is $q=(2.181\pm0.004)\times 10^{-3}$ and the projectedseparation is $s=1.1228\pm0.0006$ in units of the einstein radius. the angulareinstein radius is unusually large $\theta_{\rm e}=1.38\pm 0.11$ mas. combiningthis measurement with constraints on the "microlens parallax" and the lensflux, we can only limit the host mass to the range $0.13&lt;m/m_\odot&lt;1.0$. inthis particular case, the strong degeneracy between microlensing parallax andplanet orbital motion prevents us from measuring more accurate host and planetmasses. however, we find that adding bayesian priors from two effects (galacticmodel and keplerian orbit) each independently favors the upper end of this massrange, yielding star and planet masses of $m_*=0.67^{+0.33}_{-0.13}\ m_\odot$and $m_p=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}\ m_{\rm jup}$ at a distance of $d=2.3\pm0.6$ kpc,and with a semi-major axis of $a=2^{+3}_{-1}$ au. finally, we show that thelens mass can be determined from future high-resolution near-ir adaptive opticsobservations independently from two effects, photometric and astrometric.

0801.2162	artemis (automated robotic terrestrial exoplanet microlensing search) -  a possible expert-system based cooperative effort to hunt for planets of  earth mass and below	(abridged) the technique of gravitational microlensing is currently unique inits ability to provide a sample of terrestrial exoplanets around both galacticdisk and bulge stars, allowing to measure their abundance and determine theirdistribution with respect to mass and orbital separation. in order to achievethese goals in reasonable time, a well-coordinated effort involving a networkof either 2m or 4 x 1m telescopes at each site is required. it could lead tothe first detection of an earth-mass planet outside the solar system, and evenplanets less massive than earth could be discovered. from april 2008, artemis(automated robotic terrestrial exoplanet microlensing search) is planned toprovide a platform for a three-step strategy of survey, follow-up, and anomalymonitoring. as an expert system embedded in estar (e-science telescopes forastronomical research), artemis will give advice on the optimal targets to beobserved at any given time, and will also alert on deviations from ordinarymicrolensing light curves by means of the signalmen anomaly detector. while theuse of the voevent (virtual observatory event) protocol allows a directinteraction with the telescopes that are part of the htn (heterogeneoustelescope networks) consortium, additional interfaces provide means ofcommunication with all existing microlensing campaigns that rely on humanobservers. the success of discovering a planet by microlensing criticallydepends on the availability of a telescope in a suitable location at the righttime, which can mean within 10 min. real-time modelling offers the opportunityof live discovery of extra-solar planets, thereby providing ''science live toyour home''.

1401.2989	m31 pixel lensing plan campaign: macho lensing and self lensing signals	we present the final analysis of the observational campaign carried out bythe plan (pixel lensing andromeda) collaboration to detect a dark matter signalin form of machos through the microlensing effect. the campaign consists ofabout 1 month/year observations carried out during 4 years (2007-2010) at the1.5m cassini telescope in loiano ("astronomical observatory of bologna", oab)plus 10 days of data taken in 2010 at the 2m himalayan chandra telescope (hct)monitoring the central part of m31 (two fields of about 13'x12.6'). weestablish a fully automated pipeline for the search and the characterization ofmicrolensing flux variations: as a result we detect 3 microlensing candidates.we evaluate the expected signal through a full monte carlo simulation of theexperiment completed by an analysis of the detection efficiency of ourpipeline. we consider both "self lensing" and "macho lensing" lens populations,given by m31 stars and dark matter halo machos, in the m31 and the milky way(mw), respectively. the total number of events is compatible with the expectedself-lensing rate. specifically, we evaluate an expected signal of about 2self-lensing events. as for macho lensing, for full 0.5 (0.01) solar mass machohalos, our prediction is for about 4 (7) events. the comparatively small numberof expected macho versus self lensing events, together with the small numberstatistics at disposal, do not enable us to put strong constraints on thatpopulation. rather, the hypothesis, suggested by a previous analysis, on themacho nature of oab-07-n2, one of the microlensing candidates, translates intoa sizeable lower limit for the halo mass fraction in form of the would be machopopulation, f, of about 15% for 0.5 solar mass machos.

1403.3092	candidate gravitational microlensing events for future direct lens  imaging	the mass of the lenses giving rise to galactic microlensing events can beconstrained by measuring the relative lens-source proper motion and lens flux.the flux of the lens can be separated from that of the source, companions tothe source, and unrelated nearby stars with high-resolution images taken whenthe lens and source are spatially resolved. for typical ground-based adaptiveoptics (ao) or space-based observations, this requires either inordinately longtime baselines or high relative proper motions. we provide a list ofmicrolensing events toward the galactic bulge with high relative lens-sourceproper motion that are therefore good candidates for constraining the lens masswith future high-resolution imaging. we investigate all events from 2004 --2013 that display detectable finite-source effects, a feature that allows us tomeasure the proper motion. in total, we present 20 events with mu &gt;~ 8 mas/yr.of these, 14 were culled from previous analyses while 6 are new, includingogle-2004-blg-368, moa-2005-blg-36, ogle-2012-blg-0211, ogle-2012-blg-0456,moa-2012-blg-532, and moa-2013-blg-029. in &lt;~12 years the lens and source ofeach event will be sufficiently separated for ground-based telescopes with aosystems or space telescopes to resolve each component and further characterizethe lens system. furthermore, for the most recent events, comparison of thelens flux estimates from images taken immediately to those estimated fromimages taken when the lens and source are resolved can be used to empiricallycheck the robustness of the single-epoch method currently being used toestimate lens masses for many events.

1405.7016	double compact objects iii: gravitational wave detection rates	the unprecedented range of second-generation gravitational-wave (gw)observatories calls for refining the predictions of potential sources anddetection rates. the coalescence of double compact objects (dcos)---i.e.,neutron star-neutron star (ns-ns), black hole-neutron star (bh-ns), and blackhole-black hole (bh-bh) binary systems---is the most promising source of gwsfor these detectors. we compute detection rates of coalescing dcos insecond-generation gw detectors using the latest models for their cosmologicalevolution, and implementing inspiral-merger-ringdown (imr) gravitationalwaveform models in our signal-to-noise ratio calculations. we find that: (1)the inclusion of the merger/ringdown portion of the signal does notsignificantly affect rates for ns-ns and bh-ns systems, but it boosts rates bya factor $\sim 1.5$ for bh-bh systems; (2) in almost all of our models bh-bhsystems yield by far the largest rates, followed by ns-ns and bh-ns systems,respectively, and (3) a majority of the detectable bh-bh systems were formed inthe early universe in low-metallicity environments. we make predictions for thedistributions of detected binaries and discuss what the first gw detectionswill teach us about the astrophysics underlying binary formation and evolution.

astro-ph;0004243	planet observations of microlensing event ogle-1999-bul-23: limb  darkening measurement of the source star	we present planet observations of ogle-1999-bul-23, a binary-lensmicrolensing event towards the galactic bulge. planet observations in the i andv bands cover the event from just before the first caustic crossing until theend of the event. in particular, a densely-sampled second caustic crossingenables us to derive the linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source star;c_v = 0.786^{+0.080}_{-0.078} and c_i = 0.632^{+0.047}_{-0.037}. combinedanalysis of the light curve and the color-magnitude diagram suggests that thesource star is a g/k subgiant in the galactic bulge (t_eff = 4800 k). theresulting linear limb-darkening coefficient of the source is consistent withtheoretical predictions, although it is likely that non-linearity of thestellar surface brightness profile complicates the interpretation, especiallyfor the i band. the global light curve fit to the data indicates that the eventis due to a binary lens of a mass ratio q = 0.39 and a projected separation d =2.42. the lens/source relative proper motion is (22.8 +_ 1.5) km/s/kpc, typicalof bulge/bulge or bulge/disk events.

astro-ph;0309581	theory and practice of microlensing lightcurves around fold  singularities	among all galactic microlensing events, those involving a passage of theobserved source star over the caustic created by a binary lens are particularlyuseful in providing information about stellar atmospheres, the dynamics ofstellar populations in our own and neighbouring galaxies, and the statisticalproperties of stellar and sub-stellar binaries. this paper presents acomprehensive guide for modelling and interpreting the lightcurves obtained inevents involving fold-caustic crossings. a new general, consistent, and optimalchoice of parameters provides a deep understanding of the involved features,avoids numerical difficulties and minimizes correlations between modelparameters. while the photometric data of a microlensing event around a causticcrossing itself do not provide constraints on the characteristics of theunderlying binary lens and does not allow predictions of the behaviour of otherregions of the lightcurve, vital constraints can be obtained in an efficientway if these are combined with a few simple characteristics of data outside thecaustic crossings. a corresponding algorithm containing some improvements overan earlier approach which takes into account multi-site observations ispresented and discussed in detail together with the arising parameterconstraints paying special attention to the role of source and backgroundfluxes.

astro-ph;0402564	revealing stellar brightness profiles by means of microlensing fold  caustics	with a handful of measurements of limb-darkening coefficients, galacticmicrolensing has already proven to be a powerful technique for studyingatmospheres of distant stars. survey campaigns such as ogle-iii are capable ofproviding ~ 10 suitable target stars per year that undergo microlensing eventsinvolving passages over the caustic created by a binary lens which last from afew hours to a few days and allow to resolve the stellar atmosphere by frequentbroadband photometry. for a caustic exit lasting 12 h and a photometricprecision of 1.5%, a moderate sampling interval of 30 min (corresponding to ~25-30 data points) is sufficient for providing a reliable measurement of thelinear limb-darkening coefficient gamma with an uncertainty of ~ 8% whichreduces to ~ 3% for a reduced sampling interval of 6 min for the surroundingsof the end of the caustic exit. while some additional points over the remainingparts of the lightcurve are highly valuable, a denser sampling in these regionsprovides little improvements. unless a high-precision measurement is desired,limb-darkening coefficients for several filters can be obtained or observingtime can be spent on other targets during the same night. the adoption of aninappropriate stellar intensity profile yields characteristic systematics inthe model residuals which can be distinguished from those arising from effectscausing an acceleration between source and caustic which are however unlikelyto affect the lightcurve significantly for most events, although a freeacceleration parameter blurs the limb-darkening measurement if the passageduration cannot be accurately determined.

astro-ph;0404394	ogle-2003-blg-238: microlensing mass estimate of an isolated star	microlensing is the only known direct method to measure the masses of starsthat lack visible companions. in terms of microlensing observables, the mass isgiven by m=(c^2/4g)\tilde r_e \theta_e and so requires the measurement of boththe angular einstein radius, \theta_e, and the projected einstein radius,\tilde r_e. simultaneous measurement of these two parameters is extremely rare.here we analyze ogle-2003-blg-238, a spectacularly bright (i_min=10.3),high-magnification (a_max = 170) microlensing event. pronounced finite sourceeffects permit a measurement of \theta_e = 650 uas. although the timescale ofthe event is only t_e = 38 days, one can still obtain weak constraints on themicrolens parallax: 4.4 au &lt; \tilde r_e &lt; 18 au at the 1 \sigma level. togetherthese two parameter measurements yield a range for the lens mass of 0.36 m_sun&lt; m &lt; 1.48 m_sun. as was the case for macho-lmc-5, the only other single star(apart from the sun) whose mass has been determined from its gravitationaleffects, this estimate is rather crude. it does, however, demonstrate theviability of the technique. we also discuss future prospects for single-lensmass measurements.

astro-ph;0410411	lens binarity vs limb darkening in close-impact galactic microlensing  events	although point caustics harbour a larger potential for measuring thebrightness profile of stars during the course of a microlensing event than(line-shaped) fold caustics, the effect of lens binarity significantly limitsthe achievable accuracy. therefore, corresponding close-impact events make aless favourable case for limb-darkening measurements than those events thatinvolve fold-caustic passages, from which precision measurements can easily androutinely be obtained. examples involving later bulge giants indicate that a ~10 % misestimate on the limb-darkening coefficient can result with theassumption of a single-lens model that looks acceptable, unless the precisionof the photometric measurements is pushed below the 1 %-level even for thesefavourable targets. in contrast, measurement uncertainties on the proper motionbetween lens and source are dominated by the assessment of the angular radiusof the source star and remain practically unaffected by lens binarity. ratherthan judging the goodness-of-fit by means of a chi^2 test only, run testsprovide useful additional information that can lead to the rejection of modelsand the detection of lens binarity in close-impact microlensing events.

astro-ph;0507540	stochastical distributions of lens and source properties for observed  galactic microlensing events	a comprehensive new approach is presented for deriving probability densitiesof physical properties characterizing lens or source that constitute anobserved galactic microlensing event. while previously encountered problems areovercome, constraints from event anomalies and model parameter uncertaintiescan be incorporated into the estimate. probability densities for given eventsneed to be carefully distinguished from the statistical distribution of thesame parameters among the underlying population from which the actual lensesand sources are drawn. using given model distributions of the mass spectrum,the mass density, and the velocity distribution of galactic disk and bulgeconstituents, probability densities of lens mass, distance, and the effectivelens-source velocities are derived, where the effect on the distribution thatarises from additional observations of annual parallax or finite-sourceeffects, or the absence of significant effects, is shown. the presentedformalism can also be used to calculate probabilities for the lens to belong toone or another population and to estimate parameters that characterizeanomalies. finally, it is shown how detection efficiency maps for binary-lenscompanions in the physical parameters companion mass and orbital semi-majoraxis arise from values determined for the mass ratio and dimensionlessprojected separation parameter, including the deprojection of the orbitalmotion for elliptical orbits. compared to the naive estimate based on 'typicalvalues', the detection efficiency for low-mass companions is increased bymixing in higher detection efficiencies for smaller mass ratios (i.e. smallermasses of the primary).

0810.3915	planetary microlensing signals from the orbital motion of the source  star around the common barycentre	with several detections, the technique of gravitational microlensing hasproven useful for studying planets that orbit stars at galactic distances, andit can even be applied to detect planets in neighbouring galaxies. so far,planet detections by microlensing have been considered to result from a changein the bending of light and the resulting magnification caused by a planetaround the foreground lens star. however, in complete analogy to the annualparallax effect caused by the revolution of the earth around the sun, themotion of the source star around the common barycentre with an orbiting planetcan also lead to observable deviations in microlensing light curves that canprovide evidence for the unseen companion. we discuss this effect in somedetail and study the prospects of microlensing observations for revealingplanets through this alternative detection channel. given that small distancesbetween lens and source star are favoured, and that the effect becomes nearlyindependent of the source distance, planets would remain detectable even iftheir host star is located outside the milky way with a sufficiently goodphotometry (exceeding present-day technology) being possible. from syntheticlight curves arising from a monte-carlo simulation, we find that the chancesfor such detections are not overwhelming and appear practically limited to themost massive planets (at least with current observational set-ups), but theyare large enough for leaving the possibility that one or the other signal hasalready been observed. however, it may remain undetermined whether the planetactually orbits the source star or rather the lens star, which leaves us withan ambiguity not only with respect to its location, but also to its properties.

0811.4173	parameter degeneracies and (un)predictability of gravitational  microlensing events	(abridged) some difficulties in determining the physical properties that leadto observed anomalies in microlensing light curves, such as the mass andseparation of extra-solar planets orbiting the lens star, or the relativesource-lens parallax, are already anchored in factors that limit the amount ofinformation available from ordinary events and in the adopted parametrization.moreover, a real-time detection of deviations from an ordinary light curvewhile these are still in progress can only be done against a known model of thelatter, and such is also required for properly prioritizing ongoing events formonitoring in order to maximize scientific returns. despite the fact thatordinary microlensing light curves are described by an analytic function thatonly involves a handful of parameters, modelling these is far less trivial thanone might be tempted to think. a well-known degeneracy for small impacts, andanother one for the initial rise of an event, makes an interprediction ofdifferent phases impossible, while determining a complete set of modelparameters requires the assessment of the fundamental characteristics of allthese phases. while the wing of the light curve provides valuable informationabout the time-scale that absorbs the physical properties, the peak flux of theevent can be meaningfully predicted only after about a third of the totalmagnification has been reached. parametrizations based on observable featuresnot only ease modelling by bringing the covariance matrix close to diagonalform, but also allow good predictions of the measured flux without the need todetermine all parameters accurately. campaigns intending to infer planetpopulations from observed microlensing events need to invest some time intoacquiring data that allows to properly determine the magnification function.
