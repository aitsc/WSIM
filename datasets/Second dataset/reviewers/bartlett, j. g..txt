0902.2963	dark matter structures in the universe: prospects for optical astronomy  in the next decade	the cold dark matter theory of gravitationally-driven hierarchical structureformation has earned its status as a paradigm by explaining the distribution ofmatter over large spans of cosmic distance and time. however, its centraltenet, that most of the matter in the universe is dark and exotic, is stillunproven; the dark matter hypothesis is sufficiently audacious as to continueto warrant a diverse battery of tests. while local searches for dark matterparticles or their annihilation signals could prove the existence of thesubstance itself, studies of cosmological dark matter in situ are vital tofully understand its role in structure formation and evolution. we argue thatgravitational lensing provides the cleanest and farthest-reaching probe of darkmatter in the universe, which can be combined with other observationaltechniques to answer the most challenging and exciting questions that willdrive the subject in the next decade: what is the distribution of mass onsub-galactic scales? how do galaxy disks form and bulges grow in dark matterhalos? how accurate are cdm predictions of halo structure? can we distinguishbetween a need for a new substance (dark matter) and a need for new physics(departures from general relativity)? what is the dark matter made of anyway?we propose that the central tool in this program should be a wide-field opticalimaging survey, whose true value is realized with support in the form ofhigh-resolution, cadenced optical/infra-red imaging, and massive-throughputoptical spectroscopy.

0906.0175	residual noise covariance for planck low-resolution data analysis	aims: develop and validate tools to estimate residual noise covariance inplanck frequency maps. quantify signal error effects and compare differenttechniques to produce low-resolution maps.  methods: we derive analytical estimates of covariance of the residual noisecontained in low-resolution maps produced using a number of map-makingapproaches. we test these analytical predictions using monte carlo simulationsand their impact on angular power spectrum estimation. we use simulations toquantify the level of signal errors incurred in different resolutiondowngrading schemes considered in this work.  results: we find an excellent agreement between the optimal residual noisecovariance matrices and monte carlo noise maps. for destriping map-makers, theextent of agreement is dictated by the knee frequency of the correlated noisecomponent and the chosen baseline offset length. the significance of signalstriping is shown to be insignificant when properly dealt with. in mapresolution downgrading, we find that a carefully selected window function isrequired to reduce aliasing to the sub-percent level at multipoles, ell &gt;2nside, where nside is the healpix resolution parameter. we show thatsufficient characterization of the residual noise is unavoidable if one is todraw reliable contraints on large scale anisotropy.  conclusions: we have described how to compute the low-resolution maps, with acontrolled sky signal level, and a reliable estimate of covariance of theresidual noise. we have also presented a method to smooth the residual noisecovariance matrices to describe the noise correlations in smoothed, bandwidthlimited maps.

1001.0871	the galaxy cluster ysz-lx and ysz-m relations from the wmap 5-yr data	we use multifrequency matched filters to estimate, in the wmap 5-year data,the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) fluxes of 893 rosat noras/reflex clusters spanningthe luminosity range lx,[0.1-2.4]kev = 2 10^{41} - 3.5 10^{45} erg s^{-1}. thefilters are spatially optimised by using the universal pressure profilerecently obtained from combining xmm-newton observations of the rexcess sampleand numerical simulations. although the clusters are individually onlymarginally detected, we are able to firmly measure the sz signal (&gt;10 sigma)when averaging the data in luminosity/mass bins. the comparison between thebin-averaged sz signal versus luminosity and x-ray model predictions showsexcellent agreement, implying that there is no deficit in sz signal strengthrelative to expectations from the x-ray properties of clusters. using theindividual cluster sz flux measurements, we directly constrain the y500-lx andy500-m500 relations, where y500 is the compton y-parameter integrated over asphere of radius r500. the y500-m500 relation, derived for the first time insuch a wide mass range, has a normalisation y*500=[1.60 pm 0.19] 10^{-3}arcmin^2 at m500=3 10^{14} h^{1} msun, in excellent agreement with the x-rayprediction of 1.54 10^{-3} arcmin^2, and a mass exponent of alpha=1.79 pm 0.17,consistent with the self-similar expectation of 5/3. constraints on theredshift exponent are weak due to the limited redshift range of the sample,although they are compatible with self-similar evolution.

1007.3193	the planck sz cluster catalog: expected x-ray properties	surveys based on the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect provide a fresh view ofthe galaxy cluster population, one that is complementary to x-ray surveys. tobetter understand the relation between these two kinds of survey, we constructan empirical cluster model using scaling relations constrained by current x-rayand sz data. we apply our model to predict the x-ray properties of the plancksz cluster catalog (pcc) and compare them to existing x-ray cluster catalogs.we find that planck should significantly extend the depth of the previousall-sky cluster survey, performed in the early 1990s by the rosat satellite,and should be particularly effective at finding hot, massive clusters (t &gt; 6kev) out to redshift unity. these are rare objects, and our findings suggestthat planck could increase the observational sample at z &gt; 0.6 by an order ofmagnitude. this would open the way for detailed studies of massive clusters outto these higher redshifts. specifically, we find that the majority ofnewly-detected planck clusters should have x-ray fluxes 10^{-13} ergs/s/cm^2 &lt;f_x[0.5-2 kev] &lt; 10^{-12} ergs/s/cm^2, i.e., distributed over the decade influx just below the rosat all sky survey limit. this is sufficiently bright forextensive x-ray follow-up campaigns. once planck finds these objects,xmm-newton and \textit{chandra} could measure temperatures to 10% for a sampleof ~ 100 clusters in the range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1, a valuable increase in the numberof massive clusters studied over this range.

1101.2027	planck early results: cluster sunyaev-zeldovich optical scaling  relations	we present the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal-to-richness scaling relation(y500-n200) for the maxbcg cluster catalogue. employing a multi-frequencymatched filter on the planck sky maps, we measure the sz signal for eachcluster by adapting the filter according to weak-lensing calibratedmass-richness relations (n200-m500). we bin our individual measurements anddetect the sz signal down to the lowest richness systems (n200=10) with highsignificance, achieving a detection of the sz signal in systems with mass aslow as m500~5e13 msolar. the observed y500-n200 relation is well modeled by apower law over the full richness range. it has a lower normalisation at givenn200 than predicted based on x-ray models and published mass-richnessrelations. an x-ray subsample, however, does conform to the predicted scaling,and model predictions do reproduce the relation between our measuredbin-average sz signal and measured bin-average x-ray luminosities. at fixedrichness, we find an intrinsic dispersion in the y500-n200 relation of 60%rising to of order 100% at low richness. thanks to its all-sky coverage, planckprovides observations for more than 13,000 maxbcg clusters and an unprecedentedsz/optical data set, extending the list of known cluster scaling laws toinclude sz-optical properties. the data set offers essential clues for modelsof galaxy formation. moreover, the lower normalisation of the sz-mass relationimplied by the observed sz-richness scaling has important consequences forcluster physics and cosmological studies with sz clusters.

1101.2028	planck early results xviii: the power spectrum of cosmic infrared  background anisotropies	using planck maps of six regions of low galactic dust emission with a totalarea of about 140 square degrees, we determine the angular power spectra ofcosmic infrared background (cib) anisotropies from multipole l = 200 to l =2000 at 217, 353, 545 and 857 ghz. we use 21-cm observations of hi as a tracerof thermal dust emission to reduce the already low level of galactic dustemission and use the 143 ghz planck maps in these fields to clean out cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies. both of these cleaning processes arenecessary to avoid significant contamination of the cib signal. we measurecorrelated cib structure across frequencies. as expected, the correlationdecreases with increasing frequency separation, because the contribution ofhigh-redshift galaxies to cib anisotropies increases with wavelengths. we findno significant difference between the frequency spectrum of the cibanisotropies and the cib mean, with delta i/i=15% from 217 to 857 ghz. in termsof clustering properties, the planck data alone rule out the linear scale- andredshift-independent bias model. non-linear corrections are significant.consequently, we develop an alternative model that couples a dusty galaxy,parametric evolution model with a simple halo-model approach. it provides anexcellent fit to the measured anisotropy angular power spectra and suggeststhat a different halo occupation distribution is required at each frequency,which is consistent with our expectation that each frequency is dominated bycontributions from different redshifts. in our best-fit model, half of theanisotropy power at l=2000 comes from redshifts z&lt;0.8 at 857 ghz and z&lt;1.5 at545 ghz, while about 90% come from redshifts z&gt;2 at 353 and 217 ghz,respectively.

1101.2031	planck early results. xx. new light on anomalous microwave emission from  spinning dust grains	anomalous microwave emission (ame) has been observed by numerous experimentsin the frequency range ~10-60 ghz. using planck maps and multi-frequencyancillary data, we have constructed spectra for two known ame regions: theperseus and rho ophiuchi molecular clouds. the spectra are well fitted by acombination of free-free radiation, cosmic microwave background, thermal dust,and electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. the spinningdust spectra are the most precisely measured to date, and show the highfrequency side clearly for the first time. the spectra have a peak in the range20-40 ghz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for perseus and8.4 sigma for rho ophiuchi. in perseus, spinning dust in the dense moleculargas can account for most of the ame; the low density atomic gas appears to playa minor role. in rho ophiuchi, the ~30 ghz peak is dominated by dense moleculargas, but there is an indication of an extended tail at frequencies 50-100 ghz,which can be accounted for by irradiated low density atomic gas. the dustparameters are consistent with those derived from other measurements. we havealso searched the planck map at 28.5 ghz for candidate ame regions, bysubtracting a simple model of the synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust. wepresent spectra for two of the candidates; s140 and s235 are bright hii regionsthat show evidence for ame, and are well fitted by spinning dust models.

1101.2032	planck early results. xxi. properties of the interstellar medium in the  galactic plane	(abridged) planck has observed the entire sky from 30 ghz to 857ghz. theobserved foreground emission contains contributions from different phases ofthe interstellar medium (ism). we have separated the observed galactic emissioninto the different gaseous components (atomic, molecular and ionised) in eachof a number of galactocentric rings. templates are created for variousgalactocentric radii using velocity information from atomic (neutral hydrogen)and molecular (12co) observations. the ionised template is assumed to be tracedby free-free emission as observed by wmap, while 408 mhz emission is used totrace the synchrotron component. gas emission not traced by the abovetemplates, namely "ark gas", as evidenced using planck data, is included as anadditional template, the first time such a component has been used in this way.these templates are then correlated with each of the planck frequency bands, aswell as other ancillary data. the emission per column density of the gastemplates allows us to create distinct spectral energy distributions (seds) pergalactocentric ring and in each of the gaseous tracers from 1.4 ghz to 25 thz(12\mu m). apart from the thermal dust and free-free emission, we have probedthe galaxy for anomalous (e.g., spinning) dust as well as synchrotron emission.we show that anomalous dust emission is present in the atomic, molecular anddark gas phases throughout the galactic disk. the derived dust propetiesassociated with the dark gas phase are derived but do not allow us to revealthe nature of this phase. for all environments, the anomalous emission isconsistent with rotation from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and,according to our simple model, accounts for $(25\pm5)%$ (statistical) of thetotal emission at 30 ghz.

1101.2036	planck early results xxiv: dust in the diffuse interstellar medium and  the galactic halo	this paper presents the first results of comparison of planck along with irasdata with green bank telescope 21-cm observations in 14 fields covering morethan 800 square degrees at high galactic latitude. galactic dust emission forfields with average hi column density lower than 2 x 10^20 cm^-2 is wellcorrelated with 21-cm emission. the residual emission in these fields, once thehi-correlated emission is removed, is consistent with the expected statisticalproperties of the cosmic infrared background fluctuations. fields with largercolumn densities show significant excess dust emission compared to the hicolumn density. regions of excess lie in organized structures that suggest thepresence of hydrogen in molecular form, though they are not always correlatedwith co emission. dust emission from intermediate-velocity clouds is detectedwith high significance. its spectral properties are consistent with, comparedto the local ism values, significantly hotter dust (t~20 k), lowersub-millimeter dust opacity, and a relative abundance of very small grains tolarge grains about four times higher. these results are compatible withexpectations for clouds that are part of the galactic fountain in which thereis dust shattering and fragmentation. correlated dust emission in hvcs is notdetected; the average of the 99.9% confidence upper limits to the emissivity is0.15 times the local ism value at 857 and 3000 ghz, in accordance with gasphase evidence for lower metallicity and depletion in these clouds. unexpectedanti-correlated variations of the dust temperature and emission cross-sectionper h atom are identified in the local ism and ivcs, a trend that continuesinto molecular environments. this suggests that dust growth throughaggregation, seen in molecular clouds, is active much earlier in the cloudcondensation and star formation processes.

1101.2037	planck early results: thermal dust in nearby molecular clouds	planck allows unbiased mapping of galactic sub-millimetre and millimetreemission from the most diffuse regions to the densest parts of molecularclouds. we present an early analysis of the taurus molecular complex, online-of-sight-averaged data and without component separation. the emissionspectrum measured by planck and iras can be fitted pixel by pixel using asingle modified blackbody. some systematic residuals are detected at 353 ghzand 143 ghz, with amplitudes around -7 % and +13 %, respectively, indicatingthat the measured spectra are likely more complex than a simple modifiedblackbody. significant positive residuals are also detected in the molecularregions and in the 217 ghz and 100 ghz bands, mainly caused by to thecontribution of the j=2-1 and j=1-0 12co and 13co emission lines. we derivemaps of the dust temperature t, the dust spectral emissivity index beta, andthe dust optical depth at 250 microns tau. the temperature map illustrates thecooling of the dust particles in thermal equilibrium with the incidentradiation field, from 16-17 k in the diffuse regions to 13-14 k in the denseparts. the distribution of spectral indices is centred at 1.78, with a standarddeviation of 0.08 and a systematic error of 0.07. we detect a significantt-beta anti-correlation. the dust optical depth map reveals the spatialdistribution of the column density of the molecular complex from the densestmolecular regions to the faint diffuse regions. we use near-infrared extinctionand hi data at 21-cm to perform a quantitative analysis of the spatialvariations of the measured dust optical depth at 250 microns per hydrogen atomtau/nh. we report an increase of tau/nh by a factor of about 2 between theatomic phase and the molecular phase, which has a strong impact on theequilibrium temperature of the dust particles.

1101.2044	planck early results: statistical properties of extragalactic radio  sources in the planck early release compact source catalogue	the data reported in planck's early release compact source catalogue (ercsc)are exploited to measure the number counts (dn/ds) of extragalactic radiosources at 30, 44, 70, 100, 143 and 217 ghz. due to the full-sky nature of thecatalogue, this measurement extends to the rarest and brightest sources in thesky. at lower frequencies (30, 44, and 70 ghz) our counts are in very goodagreement with estimates based on wmap data, being somewhat deeper at 30 and 70ghz, and somewhat shallower at 44 ghz. planck's source counts at 143 and 217ghz join smoothly with the fainter ones provided by the spt and act surveysover small fractions of the sky. an analysis of source spectra, exploitingplanck's uniquely broad spectral coverage, finds clear evidence of a steepeningof the mean spectral index above about 70 ghz. this implies that, at thesefrequencies, the contamination of the cmb power spectrum by radio sources belowthe detection limit is significantly lower than previously estimated.

1101.2045	planck early results: the planck view of nearby galaxies	the all-sky coverage of the planck early release compact source catalogue(ercsc) provides an unsurpassed survey of galaxies at submillimetre (submm)wavelengths, representing a major improvement in the numbers of galaxiesdetected, as well as the range of far-ir/submm wavelengths over which they havebeen observed. we here present the first results on the properties of nearbygalaxies using these data. we match the ercsc catalogue to iras-detectedgalaxies in the imperial iras faint source redshift catalogue (iifscz), so thatwe can measure the spectral energy distributions (seds) of these objects from60 to 850 microns. this produces a list of 1717 galaxies with reliableassociations between planck and iras, from which we select a subset of 468 forsed studies, namely those with strong detections in the three highest frequencyplanck bands and no evidence of cirrus contamination. the seds are fitted usingparametric dust models to determine the range of dust temperatures andemissivities. we find evidence for colder dust than has previously been foundin external galaxies, with t&lt;20k. such cold temperatures are found using boththe standard single temperature dust model with variable emissivity beta, or atwo dust temperature model with beta fixed at 2. we also compare our results tostudies of distant submm galaxies (smgs) which have been claimed to containcooler dust than their local counterparts. we find that including our sample of468 galaxies significantly reduces the distinction between the two populations.fits to seds of selected objects using more sophisticated templates derivedfrom radiative transfer models confirm the presence of the colder dust foundthrough parameteric fitting. we thus conclude that cold (t&lt;20k) dust is asignificant and largely unexplored component of many nearby galaxies.

1101.2046	planck early results: origin of the submm excess dust emission in the  magellanic clouds	the integrated spectral energy distributions of the large and smallmagellanic cloud appear significantly flatter than expected from dust modelsbased on their fir and radio emission. the origin of this millimetre excess isstill unexplained, and is here investigated using the planck data. thebackground cmb contribution is subtracted using an ilc method performed locallyaround the galaxies. the foreground emission from the milky way is subtracted.after subtraction, the emission of both galaxies correlates closely with thegas emission of the lmc and smc. the millimetre excess in the lmc can beexplained by cmb fluctuations, but a significant excess is still present in thesmc sed. the planck and iris data at 100 micron are combined to produce thermaldust temperature and optical depth maps of the two galaxies. the lmctemperature map shows the presence of a warm inner arm already found with thespitzer data, but also shows the existence of a previously unidentified coldouter arm. several cold regions are found along this arm, some of which areassociated with known molecular clouds. the average emissivity spectral indexis found to be consistent with beta=1.5 and beta=1.2 below 500 microns for thelmc and smc respectively, significantly flatter than the values observed in themilky way. furthermore, there is evidence in the smc for a further flatteningof the sed in the sub-mm. the spatial distribution of the millimetre dustexcess in the smc follows the gas and thermal dust distribution. differentmodels are explored in order to fit the dust emission in the smc. it isconcluded that the millimetre excess is unlikely to be caused by very cold dustemission and that it could be due to a combination of spinning dust. emissionand thermal dust emission by more amorphous dust grains than those present inour galaxy.

1101.2048	planck early results. vi. the high frequency instrument data processing	we describe the processing of the 336 billion raw data samples from the highfrequency instrument (hfi) which we performed to produce six temperature mapsfrom the first 295 days of planck-hfi survey data. these maps provide anaccurate rendition of the sky emission at 100, 143, 217, 353, 545 and 857 ghzwith an angular resolution ranging from 9.9 to 4.4^2. the white noise level isaround 1.5 {\mu}k degree or less in the 3 main cmb channels (100--217ghz). thephotometric accuracy is better than 2% at frequencies between 100 and 353 ghzand around 7% at the two highest frequencies. the maps created by the hfi dataprocessing centre reach our goals in terms of sensitivity, resolution, andphotometric accuracy. they are already sufficiently accurate andwell-characterised to allow scientific analyses which are presented in anaccompanying series of early papers. at this stage, hfi data appears to be ofhigh quality and we expect that with further refinements of the data processingwe should be able to achieve, or exceed, the science goals of the planckproject.

1106.1376	planck early results xxvi: detection with planck and confirmation by  xmm-newton of plck g266.6-27.3, an exceptionally x-ray luminous and massive  galaxy cluster at z~1	we present first results on plck g266.6-27.3, a galaxy cluster candidatedetected at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 in the planck all sky survey. anxmm-newton validation observation has allowed us to confirm that the candidateis a bona fide galaxy cluster. with these x-ray data we measure an accurateredshift, z = 0.94 +/- 0.02, and estimate the cluster mass to be m_500 = (7.8+/- 0.8)e+14 solar masses. plck g266.6-27.3 is an exceptional system: itsluminosity of l_x(0.5-2.0 kev)=(1.4 +/- 0.05)e+45 erg/s, equals that of the twomost luminous known clusters in the z &gt; 0.5 universe, and it is one of the mostmassive clusters at z~1. moreover, unlike the majority of high-redshiftclusters, plck g266.6-27.3 appears to be highly relaxed. this observationconfirms planck's capability of detecting high-redshift, high-mass clusters,and opens the way to the systematic study of population evolution in theexponential tail of the mass function.

1112.5595	planck intermediate results. i. further validation of new planck  clusters with xmm-newton	we present further results from the ongoing xmm-newton validation follow-upof planck cluster candidates, detailing x-ray observations of eleven candidatesdetected at a signal-to-noise ratio of 4.5&lt;s/n&lt;5.3 in the same 10-month surveymaps used in the construction of the early sz sample. the sample was selectedin order to test internal sz quality flags, and the pertinence of these flagsis discussed in light of the validation results. ten of the candidates arefound to be bona fide clusters lying below the rass flux limit. redshiftestimates are available for all confirmed systems via x-ray fe-linespectroscopy. they lie in the redshift range 0.19&lt;z&lt;0.94, demonstratingplanck's capability to detect clusters up to high z. the x-ray properties ofthe new clusters appear to be similar to previous new detections by planck atlower z and higher sz flux: the majority are x-ray underluminous for theirmass, estimated using y_x as mass proxy, and many have a disturbed morphology.we find tentative indication for malmquist bias in the y_sz-y_x relation, witha turnover at y_sz \sim 4 e-4 arcmin^2. we present additional new opticalredshift determinations with eno and eso telescopes of candidates previouslyconfirmed with xmm-newton. the x-ray and optical redshifts for a total of 20clusters are found to be in excellent agreement. we also show that useful lowerlimits can be put on cluster redshifts using x-ray data only via the use of they_x vs. y_sz and x-ray flux f_x vs. y_sz relations.

1204.2743	planck intermediate results. iii. the relation between galaxy cluster  mass and sunyaev-zeldovich signal	we examine the relation between the galaxy cluster mass m andsunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect signal d_a^2 y for a sample of 19 objects forwhich weak lensing (wl) mass measurements obtained from subaru telescope dataare available in the literature. hydrostatic x-ray masses are derived fromxmm-newton archive data and the sz effect signal is measured from planckall-sky survey data. we find an m_wl-d_a^2 y relation that is consistent inslope and normalisation with previous determinations using weak lensing masses;however, there is a normalisation offset with respect to previous measuresbased on hydrostatic x-ray mass-proxy relations. we verify that our sz effectmeasurements are in excellent agreement with previous determinations fromplanck data. for the present sample, the hydrostatic x-ray masses at r_500 areon average ~ 20 per cent larger than the corresponding weak lensing masses, atodds with expectations. we show that the mass discrepancy is driven by adifference in mass concentration as measured by the two methods, and, for thepresent sample, the mass discrepancy and difference in mass concentration isespecially large for disturbed systems. the mass discrepancy is also linked tothe offset in centres used by the x-ray and weak lensing analyses, which againis most important in disturbed systems. we outline several approaches that areneeded to help achieve convergence in cluster mass measurement with x-ray andweak lensing observations.

1207.4009	planck intermediate results. vi: the dynamical structure of  plckg214.6+37.0, a planck discovered triple system of galaxy clusters	the survey of galaxy clusters performed by planck through thesunyaev-zeldovich effect has already discovered many interesting objects,thanks to the whole coverage of the sky. one of the sz candidates detected inthe early months of the mission near to the signal to noise threshold,plckg214.6+37.0, was later revealed by xmm-newton to be a triple system ofgalaxy clusters. we have further investigated this puzzling system with amulti-wavelength approach and we present here the results from a deepxmm-newton re-observation. the characterisation of the physical properties ofthe three components has allowed us to build a template model to extract thetotal sz signal of this system with planck data. we partly reconciled thediscrepancy between the expected sz signal from x-rays and the observed one,which are now consistent at less than 1.2 sigma. we measured the redshift ofthe three components with the iron lines in the x-ray spectrum, and confirmedthat the three clumps are likely part of the same supercluster structure. theanalysis of the dynamical state of the three components, as well as the absenceof detectable excess x-ray emission, suggest that we are witnessing theformation of a massive cluster at an early phase of interaction.

1207.4061	planck intermediate results. v. pressure profiles of galaxy clusters  from the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	taking advantage of the all-sky coverage and broad frequency range of theplanck satellite, we study the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) and pressure profiles of62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-monthnominal survey. careful reconstruction of the sz signal indicates that mostclusters are individually detected at least out to r500. by stacking the radialprofiles, we have statistically detected the radial sz signal out to 3 x r500,i.e., at a density contrast of about 50-100, though the dispersion about themean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range.our measurement is fully consistent with previous planck results on integratedsz fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between sz and x-raymeasurements inside r500. correcting for the effects of the planck beam, wehave calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. this new constraint fromsz measurements is consistent with the x-ray constraints from xmm-newton in theregion in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1-1]r500), and is in fairly goodagreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. atlarger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than mostpredictions from numerical simulations. combining the sz and x-ray observedprofiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fitparameters [p0, c500, gamma, alpha, beta] = [6.41, 1.81, 0.31, 1.33, 4.13].using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirtswe reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profileout to 3 x r500. within the temperature driven uncertainties, our planckconstraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gasfraction in halos.

1208.3611	planck intermediate results. x. physics of the hot gas in the coma  cluster	we present an analysis of planck satellite data on the coma cluster observedvia the sunyaev-zeldovich effect. planck is able, for the first time, to detectsz emission up to r ~ 3 x r_500. we test previously proposed models for thepressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. wefind that the arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit coma, andthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the dataonly at r&lt;r_500: by r=2xr_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by afactor of ~2. this may indicate that at these larger radii either i) thecluster sz emission is contaminated by unresolved sz sources along the line ofsight or ii) the pressure profile of coma is higher at r&gt;r_500 than the meanpressure profile predicted by the simulations. the planck image showssignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half adegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. these featuresare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed thewestern feature was previously noticed in the rosat pspc mosaic as well as inthe radio. using planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we findpressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,respectively. assuming rankine-hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deducethat the shock waves should propagate with mach number m_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 andm_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the west and southeast, respectively. finally, we findthat the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on mpcscales with small intrinsic scatter. this implies either that the energydensity of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster,or that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius thanpreviously thought.

1208.5483	planck intermediate results. ix. detection of the galactic haze with  planck	using precise full-sky observations from planck, and applying several methodsof component separation, we identify and characterize the emission from thegalactic "haze" at microwave wavelengths. the haze is a distinct component ofdiffuse galactic emission, roughly centered on the galactic centre, and extendsto |b| ~35 deg in galactic latitude and |l| ~15 deg in longitude. by combiningthe planck data with observations from the wmap we are able to determine thespectrum of this emission to high accuracy, unhindered by the large systematicbiases present in previous analyses. the derived spectrum is consistent withpower-law emission with a spectral index of -2.55 +/- 0.05, thus excludingfree-free emission as the source and instead favouring hard-spectrumsynchrotron radiation from an electron population with a spectrum (numberdensity per energy) dn/de ~ e^-2.1. at galactic latitudes |b|&lt;30 deg, themicrowave haze morphology is consistent with that of the fermi gamma-ray "haze"or "bubbles," indicating that we have a multi-wavelength view of a distinctcomponent of our galaxy. given both the very hard spectrum and the extendednature of the emission, it is highly unlikely that the haze electrons resultfrom supernova shocks in the galactic disk. instead, a new mechanism forcosmic-ray acceleration in the centre of our galaxy is implied.

1208.5911	planck intermediate results. viii. filaments between interacting  clusters	about half of the baryons of the universe are expected to be in the form offilaments of hot and low density intergalactic medium. most of these baryonsremain undetected even by the most advanced x-ray observatories which arelimited in sensitivity to the diffuse low density medium. the planck satellitehas provided hundreds of detections of the hot gas in clusters of galaxies viathe thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich (tsz) effect and is an ideal instrument forstudying extended low density media through the tsz effect. in this paper weuse the planck data to search for signatures of a fraction of these missingbaryons between pairs of galaxy clusters. cluster pairs are good candidates forsearching for the hotter and denser phase of the intergalactic medium (which ismore easily observed through the sz effect). using an x-ray catalogue ofclusters and the planck data, we select physical pairs of clusters ascandidates. using the planck data we construct a local map of the tsz effectcentered on each pair of galaxy clusters. rosat data is used to construct x-raymaps of these pairs. after having modelled and subtracted the tsz effect andx-ray emission for each cluster in the pair we study the residuals on both thesz and x-ray maps. for the merging cluster pair a399-a401 we observe asignificant tsz effect signal in the intercluster region beyond the virialradii of the clusters. a joint x-ray sz analysis allows us to constrain thetemperature and density of this intercluster medium. we obtain a temperature ofkt = 7.1 +- 0.9, kev (consistent with previous estimates) and a baryon densityof (3.7 +- 0.2)x10^-4, cm^-3. the planck satellite mission has provided thefirst sz detection of the hot and diffuse intercluster gas.

1212.4131	planck intermediate results. xi: the gas content of dark matter halos:  the sunyaev-zeldovich-stellar mass relation for locally brightest galaxies	we present the scaling relation between sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal andstellar mass for almost 260,000 locally brightest galaxies (lbgs) selected fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). these are predominantly the centralgalaxies of their dark matter halos. we calibrate the stellar-to-halo massconversion using realistic mock catalogues based on the millennium simulation.applying a multi-frequency matched filter to the planck data for each lbg, andaveraging the results in bins of stellar mass, we measure the mean sz signaldown to $m_\ast\sim 2\times 10^{11} \msolar$, with a clear indication of signalat even lower stellar mass. we derive the scaling relation between sz signaland halo mass by assigning halo properties from our mock catalogues to the reallbgs and simulating the planck observation process. this relation shows noevidence for deviation from a power law over a halo mass range extending fromrich clusters down to $m_{500}\sim 2\times 10^{13} \msolar$, and there is aclear indication of signal down to $m_{500}\sim 4\times 10^{12} \msolar$.planck's sz detections in such low-mass halos imply that about a quarter of allbaryons have now been seen in the form of hot halo gas, and that this gas mustbe less concentrated than the dark matter in such halos in order to remainconsistent with x-ray observations. at the high-mass end, the measured szsignal is 20% lower than found from observations of x-ray clusters, adifference consistent with malmquist bias effects in the x-ray sample.

1301.5839	planck intermediate results. xii: diffuse galactic components in the  gould belt system	we perform an analysis of the diffuse low-frequency galactic components inthe southern part of the gould belt system (130^\circ\leq l\leq 230^\circ and-50^\circ\leq b\leq -10^\circ). strong ultra-violet (uv) flux coming from thegould belt super-association is responsible for bright diffuse foregrounds thatwe observe from our position inside the system and that can help us improve ourknowledge of the galactic emission. free-free emission and anomalous microwaveemission (ame) are the dominant components at low frequencies (\nu &lt; 40 ghz),while synchrotron emission is very smooth and faint. we separate diffusefree-free emission and ame from synchrotron emission and thermal dust emissionby using planck data, complemented by ancillary data, using the "correlatedcomponent analysis" (cca) component separation method and we compare with theresults of cross-correlation of foreground templates with the frequency maps.we estimate the electron temperature t_e from h$\alpha$ and free-free emissionusing two methods (temperature-temperature plot and cross-correlation) and weobtain t_e ranging from 3100 to 5200 k, for an effective fraction of absorbingdust along the line of sight of 30% (f_d=0.3). we estimate the frequencyspectrum of the diffuse ame and we recover a peak frequency (in flux densityunits) of 25.5 \pm 1.5 ghz. we verify the reliability of this result withrealistic simulations that include the presence of biases in the spectral modelfor the ame and in the free-free template. by combining physical models forvibrational and rotational dust emission and adding the constraints from thethermal dust spectrum from planck and iras we are able to get a gooddescription of the frequency spectrum of the ame for plausible values of thelocal density and radiation field.

1303.5062	planck 2013 results. i. overview of products and scientific results	the esa's planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early universe and itssubsequent evolution, was launched 14 may 2009 and has been scanning themicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 august 2009. this papergives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis,and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science dataproducts and papers in the release. the science products include maps of thecmb and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact galactic andextragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the sz effect.the likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the planck dataand a lensing likelihood are described. scientific results include robustsupport for the standard six-parameter lcdm model of cosmology and improvedmeasurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation fromscale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. the planck values for theseparameters and others derived from them are significantly different from thosepreviously determined. several large-scale anomalies in the temperaturedistribution of the cmb, first detected by wmap, are confirmed with higherconfidence. planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and hasmeasured gravitational lensing of cmb anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma.planck finds no evidence for non-gaussianity in the cmb. planck's results agreewell with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. planckfinds a lower hubble constant than found in some more local measures. sometension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derivedfrom cmb data and that derived from sz data. the planck and wmap power spectraare offset from each other by an average level of about 2% around the firstacoustic peak.

1303.5072	planck 2013 results. xii. component separation	planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bandsbetween 30 and 857 ghz. these observations allow robust reconstruction of theprimordial cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations overnearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on galactic foregrounds. thispaper describes the component separation framework adopted by planck. we testfour foreground-cleaned cmb maps derived using qualitatively differentcomponent separation algorithms. the quality of our reconstructions isevaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shownthrough various tests to be internally consistent and robust for cmb powerspectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. the parameterconstraints on lambdacdm cosmologies derived from these maps are consistentwith those presented in the cross-spectrum based planck likelihood analysis. wechoose two of the cmb maps for specific scientific goals. we also present mapsand frequency spectra of the galactic low-frequency, co, and thermal dustemission. the component maps are found to provide a faithful representation ofthe sky, as evaluated by simulations. for the low-frequency component, thespectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta &lt;-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinningdust spectrum peaking below 20 ghz, a flat index of beta &gt; -2.3 with strongfree-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.

1303.5073	planck 2013 results. xiii. galactic co emission	rotational transition lines of co play a major role in molecular radioastronomy and in particular in the study of star formation and the galacticstructure. although a wealth of data exists in the galactic plane and somewell-known molecular clouds, there is no available co high sensitivity all-skysurvey to date.  such all-sky surveys can be constructed using the \planck\ hfi data becausethe three lowest co rotational transition lines at 115, 230 and 345 ghzsignificantly contribute to the signal of the 100, 217 and 353 ghz hfi channelsrespectively. two different component separation methods are used to extractthe co maps from planck hfi data. the maps obtained are then compared to oneanother and to existing external co surveys. from these quality checks the bestco maps in terms of signal to noise and/or residual foreground contaminationare selected. three sets of velocity-integrated co emission maps are produced:type 1 maps of the co (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions with lowforeground contamination but moderate signal-to-noise ratio; type 2 maps forthe (1-0) and (2-1) transitions with a better signal-to-noise ratio; and onetype 3 map, a line composite map with the best signal-to-noise ratio in orderto locate the faintest molecular regions. the maps are described in detail.they are shown to be fully compatible with previous surveys of parts of thegalactic plane and also of fainter regions out of the galactic plane. theplanck hfi velocity-integrated co maps for the (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2)rotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky co view of the galaxy.these maps are also of great interest to monitor potential co contamination oncmb \planck\ studies.

1303.5074	planck 2013 results. xiv. zodiacal emission	the planck satellite provides a set of all-sky maps at nine frequencies from30 ghz to 857 ghz. planets, minor bodies, and diffuse interplanetary dustemission (ipd) are all observed. the ipd can be separated from galactic andother emissions because planck views a given point on the celestial spheremultiple times, through different columns of ipd. we use the planck data toinvestigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky atsub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. we fit the planck data to find theemissivities of the various components of the cobe zodiacal model -- a diffusecloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an earth-trailingfeature. the emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasingwavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. the emissivities of the dustbands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of thegrains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. we fit thesmall amount of galactic emission seen through the telescope's far sidelobes,and place limits on possible contamination of the cmb results from bothzodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. when necessary, the results are used in theplanck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed.we show that the zodiacal correction to the cmb maps is small compared to theplanck cmb temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities forsmall solar system bodies.

1303.5075	planck 2013 results. xv. cmb power spectra and likelihood	we present the planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of thetwo-point correlation function of the cmb temperature fluctuations. we use thislikelihood to derive the planck cmb power spectrum over three decades in l,covering 2 &lt;= l &lt;= 2500. the main source of error at l &lt;= 1500 is cosmicvariance. uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumentalnoise dominate the error budget at higher l's. for l &lt; 50, our likelihoodexploits all planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 ghz through a physicallymotivated bayesian component separation technique. at l &gt;= 50, we employ acorrelated gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectraderived from the 100, 143 and 217 ghz channels. we validate our likelihoodthrough an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact ofresidual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.we find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residualsof a few uk^2 at l &lt;= 1000. we compare our results with foreground-cleaned cmbmaps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 ghz planck map, and find broadagreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. thebest-fit lcdm cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary planckpolarisation spectra. the standard lcdm cosmology is well constrained by planckby l &lt;= 1500. for example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indicationof significant departures from the lcdm framework. finally, we report a tensionbetween the best-fit lcdm model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a powerdeficit of 5-10% at l &lt;~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. we do not elaboratefurther on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our mostpuzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset.

1303.5076	planck 2013 results. xvi. cosmological parameters	we present the first results based on planck measurements of the cmbtemperature and lensing-potential power spectra. the planck spectra at highmultipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flatsix-parameter lcdm cosmology. in this model planck data determine thecosmological parameters to high precision. we find a low value of the hubbleconstant, h0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/mpc and a high value of the matter densityparameter, omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreementwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) surveys. includingcurvature, we find that the universe is consistent with spatial flatness topercent-level precision using planck cmb data alone. we present results from ananalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data setsin addition to planck and high-resolution cmb data. none of these models arefavoured significantly over standard lcdm. the deviation of the scalar spectralindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changesin the matter content of the universe. we find a 95% upper limit of r&lt;0.11 onthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. there is no evidence for additional neutrino-likerelativistic particles. using bao and cmb data, we find n_eff=3.30+/-0.27 forthe effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of0.23 ev for the summed neutrino mass. our results are in excellent agreementwith big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of n_eff=3.046. we find noevidence for dynamical dark energy. despite the success of the standard lcdmmodel, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the cmb power spectrum atlow multipoles, as noted previously by the wmap team. while not of decisivesignificance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis ofthe planck temperature data.

1303.5077	planck 2013 results. xvii. gravitational lensing by large-scale  structure	on the arcminute angular scales probed by planck, the cmb anisotropies aregently perturbed by gravitational lensing. here we present a detailed study ofthis effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217ghzfrequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. we usethe temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a(noisy) map of the cmb lensing potential, which provides an integrated measureof the mass distribution back to the cmb last-scattering surface. our lensingpotential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a factwhich we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scalestructure. we estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, findinggenerally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting lcdm model forthe planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structureswhich source the lensing potential. when combined with the temperature powerspectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameterconstraints; it improves cmb-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of twoand also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordialperturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing ameasurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent oflarge-scale polarization data. discarding scale information, our measurementcorresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential powerspectrum, or a 2% constraint on the rms amplitude of matter fluctuations atz~2.

1303.5078	planck 2013 results. xviii. gravitational lensing-infrared background  correlation	the multi-frequency capability of the planck satellite provides informationboth on the integrated history of star formation (via the cosmic infraredbackground, or cib) and on the distribution of dark matter (via the lensingeffect on the cosmic microwave background, or cmb). the conjunction of thesetwo unique probes allows us to measure directly the connection between dark andluminous matter in the high redshift (1 &lt; z &lt;3) universe. we use a three-pointstatistic optimized to detect the correlation between these two tracers.following a thorough discussion of possible contaminants and a suite ofconsistency tests, using lens reconstructions at 100, 143 and 217 ghz and cibmeasurements at 100-857 ghz, we report the first detection of the correlationbetween the cib and cmb lensing. the well matched redshift distribution ofthese two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42\sigma at 545 ghz and a correlation as high as 80% across these two tracers.our full set of multi-frequency measurements (both cib auto- and cib-lensingcross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with acharacteristic mass scale for the halos hosting cib sources oflog_{10}(m/m_sun) = 10.5 \pm 0.6. leveraging the frequency dependence of oursignal, we isolate the high redshift contribution to the cib, and constrain thestar formation rate (sfr) density at z&gt;1. we measure directly the sfr densitywith around 2 sigma significance for three redshift bins between z=1 and 7,thus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at earlytimes.

(i) correlation of the cmb with theplanck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). thisdetection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation betweenlensing and the isw effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma. (ii)cross-correlation with tracers of lss, yielding around 3 sigma significance,based on a combination of radio (nvss) and optical (sdss) data. (iii) aperturephotometry on stacked cmb fields at the locations of known large-scalestructures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously exploredcatalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared toexpectations. more recent catalogues give more moderate results, ranging fromnegligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent scale andamplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected fromnumerical simulations within lcmd. where they can be compared, thesemeasurements are compatible with previous work using data from wmap, which hadalready mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance. planck's broaderfrequency coverage confirms that the signal is achromatic, bolstering the casefor isw detection. as a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure tofilter the cmb data, presenting maps of the isw temperature perturbation. theseresults provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of adark energy component that governs the current accelerated expansion of theuniverse.

1303.5080	planck 2013 results. xx. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster counts	we present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as afunction of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the planck sz(psz) catalogue. the psz is selected through the signature of thesunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect, and the sub-sample used here has asignal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster andall but one with a redshift estimate. we discuss the completeness of the sampleand our construction of a likelihood analysis. using a relation between mass$m$ and sz signal $y$ calibrated to x-ray measurements, we derive constraintson the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter$\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\lambda$cdm model. we test the robustness ofour estimates and find that possible biases in the $y$--$m$ relation and thehalo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from thecluster sample. assuming the x-ray determined mass to be biased low relative tothe true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observedmass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we findthat $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm 0.02$, and$\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. the value of$\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a valueof 20% we find $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm 0.01$ and atighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. we find that the largervalues of $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by planck'smeasurements of the primary cmb anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass biasof about 40%. alternatively, consistency with the primary cmb constraints canbe achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scalesrelative to the $\lambda$cdm model, such as a component of massive neutrinos(abridged).

1303.5082	planck 2013 results. xxii. constraints on inflation	we analyse the implications of the planck data for cosmic inflation. theplanck nominal mission temperature anisotropy measurements, combined with thewmap large-angle polarization, constrain the scalar spectral index to $n_s =0.9603 \pm 0.0073$, ruling out exact scale invariance at over 5 $\sigma$.planck establishes an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r &lt; 0.11(95% cl). the planck data thus shrink the space of allowed standardinflationary models, preferring potentials with v" &lt; 0. exponential potentialmodels, the simplest hybrid inflationary models, and monomial potential modelsof degree n &gt; 2 do not provide a good fit to the data. planck does not findstatistically significant running of the scalar spectral index, obtaining $dn_s/d ln k = -0.0134 \pm 0.0090$. several analyses dropping the slow-rollapproximation are carried out, including detailed model comparison andinflationary potential reconstruction. we also investigate whether theprimordial power spectrum contains any features. we find that models with aparameterized oscillatory feature improve the fit $\chi^2$ by ~ 10; however,bayesian evidence does not prefer these models. we constrain severalsingle-field inflation models with generalized lagrangians by combining powerspectrum data with bounds on $f_\mathrm{nl}$ measured by planck. the fractionalprimordial contribution of cdm isocurvature modes in the curvaton and axionscenarios has upper bounds of 0.25% or 3.9% (95% cl), respectively. in modelswith arbitrarily correlated cdm or neutrino isocurvature modes, ananticorrelation can improve $\chi^2$ by approximatively 4 as a result ofslightly lowering the theoretical prediction for the $\ell&lt;40$ multipolesrelative to the higher multipoles. nonetheless, the data are consistent withadiabatic initial conditions.

1303.5083	planck 2013 results. xxiii. isotropy and statistics of the cmb	the two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that theinitial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and gaussian - are rigorouslytested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy from theplanck satellite. deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated tobe robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequencydependence. many of these anomalies were previously observed in the wmap data,and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma).however, we find little evidence for non-gaussianity, with the exception of afew statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies.in particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connectedto a low observed variance of the cmb signal. a power asymmetry is now found topersist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in thelow-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. however, anyprimordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend toarbitrarily small angular scales. finally, it is plausible that some of thesefeatures may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, whichshows a deficit of power on similar scales. indeed, when the power spectra oftwo hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, oneshows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillationsbetween odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation andphase correlations also detected in the data. although these analyses representa step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactoryexplanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.

1303.5085	planck 2013 results. xxv. searches for cosmic strings and other  topological defects	planck data have been used to provide stringent new constraints on cosmicstrings and other defects. we describe forecasts of the cmb power spectruminduced by cosmic strings, calculating these from network models andsimulations using line-of-sight boltzmann solvers. we have studied nambu-gotocosmic strings, as well as field theory strings for which radiative effects areimportant, thus spanning the range of theoretical uncertainty in stringsmodels. we have added the angular power spectrum from strings to that for asimple adiabatic model, with the extra fraction defined as $f_{10}$ atmultipole $\ell=10$. this parameter has been added to the standard sixparameter fit using cosmomc with flat priors. for the nambu-goto string model,we have obtained a constraint on the string tension of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.5 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.015$ at 95% confidence that can be improved to$g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.3 x 10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.010$ on inclusion of high-$\ell$ cmbdata. for the abelian-higgs field theory model we find, $g\mu_{ah}/c^2 &lt; 3.2 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.028$. the marginalized likelihoods for $f_{10}$ and inthe $f_{10}$--$\omega_b h^2$ plane are also presented. we have also obtainedconstraints on $f_{10}$ for models with semi-local strings and global texturesfor which $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.1 x 10^{-6}$. we have made complementarity searches forthe specific non-gaussian signatures of cosmic strings, calibrating withall-sky planck resolution cmb maps generated from networks ofpost-recombination strings. we have obtained upper limits on the string tensionat 95% confidence of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 8.8 x 10^{-7}$ using modal bispectrumestimation and $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 7.8 x 10^{-7}$ for real space searches withminkowski functionals. these are conservative upper bounds because onlypost-recombination string contributions have been included in the non-gaussiananalysis.

1303.5086	planck 2013 results. xxvi. background geometry and topology of the  universe	planck cmb temperature maps allow detection of large-scale departures fromhomogeneity and isotropy. we search for topology with a fundamental domainnearly intersecting the last scattering surface (comoving distance $\chi_r$).for most topologies studied the likelihood maximized over orientation showssome preference for multi-connected models just larger than $\chi_r$. thiseffect is also present in simulated realizations of isotropic maps and weinterpret it as the alignment of mild anisotropic correlations with chancefeatures in a single realization; such a feature can also exist, in milderform, when the likelihood is marginalized over orientations. thus marginalized,the limits on the radius $r_i$ of the largest sphere inscribed in a topologicaldomain (at log-likelihood-ratio -5) are: in a flat universe, $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$for the cubic torus (cf. $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ at 99% cl for a matched-circlessearch); $r_i&gt;0.7\chi_r$ for the chimney; $r_i&gt;0.5\chi_r$ for the slab; in apositively curved universe, $r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the dodecahedron;$r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the truncated cube; $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ for the octahedron.similar limits apply to alternate topologies. we perform a bayesian search foran anisotropic bianchi vii$_h$ geometry. in a non-physical setting where thebianchi parameters are decoupled from cosmology, planck data favour a bianchicomponent with a bayes factor of at least 1.5 units of log-evidence: a bianchipattern is efficient at accounting for some large-scale anomalies in planckdata. however, the cosmological parameters are in strong disagreement withthose found from cmb anisotropy data alone. in the physically motivated settingwhere the bianchi parameters are fitted simultaneously with standardcosmological parameters, we find no evidence for a bianchi vii$_h$ cosmologyand constrain the vorticity of such models: $(\omega/h)_0&lt;8\times10^{-10}$ (95%cl).

1307.6815	planck intermediate results. xiv. dust emission at millimetre  wavelengths in the galactic plane	we use planck hfi data combined with ancillary radio data to study theemissivity index of the interstellar dust emission in the frequency range 10 -353 ghz, or 3 - 0.8 mm, in the galactic plane. we analyse the region l=20 degr- 44 degr and |b| \leq 4 degr where the free-free emission can be estimatedfrom radio recombination line data. we fit the spectra at each sky pixel with amodified blackbody model and two spectral indices, beta_mm and beta_fir, belowand above 353 ghz respectively. we find that beta_mm is smaller than beta_firand we detect a correlation between this low frequency power-law index and thedust optical depth at 353 ghz, tau_353. the opacity spectral index beta_mmincreases from about 1.54 in the more diffuse regions of the galactic disk, |b|= 3 degr - 4 degr and tau_353 ~ 5 x 10^{-5}, to about 1.66 in the densestregions with an optical depth of more than one order of magnitude higher. weassociate this correlation with an evolution of the dust emissivity related tothe fraction of molecular gas along the line of sight. this translates intobeta_mm ~ 1.54 for a medium that is mostly atomic and beta_mm ~ 1.66 when themedium is dominated by molecular gas. we find that both the two-level systemmodel and the emission by ferromagnetic particles can explain the results. theresults improve our understanding of the physics of interstellar dust and leadtowards a complete model of the dust spectrum of the milky way fromfar-infrared to millimetre wavelengths.

1308.0201	the spitzer-south pole telescope deep field: survey design and irac  catalogs	the spitzer-south pole telescope deep field (ssdf) is a wide-area surveyusing spitzer's infrared array camera (irac) to cover 94 square degrees ofextragalactic sky, making it the largest irac survey completed to date outsidethe milky way midplane. the ssdf is centered at 23:30,-55:00, in a region thatcombines observations spanning a broad wavelength range from numerousfacilities. these include millimeter imaging from the south pole telescope,far-infrared observations from herschel/spire, x-ray observations from the xmmxxl survey, near-infrared observations from the vista hemisphere survey, andradio-wavelength imaging from the australia telescope compact array, in apanchromatic project designed to address major outstanding questionssurrounding galaxy clusters and the baryon budget. here we describe thespitzer/irac observations of the ssdf, including the survey design,observations, processing, source extraction, and publicly available dataproducts. in particular, we present two band-merged catalogs, one for each ofthe two warm irac selection bands. they contain roughly 5.5 and 3.7 milliondistinct sources, the vast majority of which are galaxies, down to the ssdf5-sigma sensitivity limits of 19.0 and 18.2 vega mag (7.0 and 9.4 microjy) at3.6 and 4.5 microns, respectively.

1309.0382	planck 2013 results. xxx. cosmic infrared background measurements and  implications for star formation	we present new measurements of cib anisotropies using planck. combining hfidata with iras, the angular auto- and cross frequency power spectrum ismeasured from 143 to 3000 ghz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545 ghz. thetotal areas used to compute the cib power spectrum and bispectrum are about2240 and 4400 deg^2, respectively. after careful removal of the contaminants,and a complete study of systematics, the cib power spectrum and bispectrum aremeasured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipolesell~150 to 2500, and ell~130 to 1100, respectively. two approaches aredeveloped for modelling cib power spectrum anisotropies. the first approachtakes advantage of the unique measurements by planck at large angular scales,and models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of darkmatter halos hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by theircontribution to the emissivities. the second approach is based on a model thatassociates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos,using a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosityand (sub-)halo mass. the two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-power spectra very well. we find that the star formation history is wellconstrained up to z~2. however, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the starformation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in thespectral energy distribution of cib galaxies. we also find that cib galaxieshave warmer temperatures as redshift increases. the cib bispectrum is steeperthan that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a powerlaw; this gives some information about the contribution of massive halos to thecib bispectrum.

1312.1300	planck 2013 results. xi. all-sky model of thermal dust emission	this paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the planck 857,545 and 353 ghz, and iras 100 micron data. using a modified black-body fit tothe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, andspectral index over the 353-3000 ghz range. this model is a tightrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. it shows variations of the order of 30% compared with the widely-used model of finkbeiner, davis, and schlegel. theplanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the wholesky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared toprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. anincrease of the dust opacity at 353 ghz, tau_353/n_h, from the diffuse to thedenser interstellar medium (ism) is reported. it is associated with a decreasein the observed dust temperature, t_obs, that could be due at least in part tothe increased dust opacity. we also report an excess of dust emission at hicolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust inthe warm ionized medium. in the diffuse ism at high galactic latitude, wereport an anti-correlation between tau_353/n_h and t_obs while the dustspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. the implication is thatin the diffuse high-latitude ism tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dustcolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlationof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements onstars is strong. to estimate galactic e(b-v) in extragalactic fields at highlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead ofthe dust optical depth, calibrated to e(b-v) using reddening measurements ofquasars deduced from sloan digital sky survey data.

1312.5446	planck intermediate results. xvii. emission of dust in the diffuse  interstellar medium from the far-infrared to microwave frequencies	the dust-hi correlation is used to characterize the emission properties ofdust in the diffuse interstellar medium. we cross-correlate sky maps fromplanck, wmap, and dirbe, at 17 frequencies from 23 to 3000 ghz, with the parkessurvey of the 21-cm line emission of neutral atomic hydrogen, over a contiguousarea of 7500 deg$^2$ centred on the southern galactic pole. our analysis yieldsfour specific results. (1) the dust temperature is observed to beanti-correlated with the dust emissivity and opacity. we interpret this resultas evidence for dust evolution within the diffuse ism. the mean dust opacity ismeasured to be $(7.1 \pm 0.6) 10^{-27} cm^2/h \times (\nu/353\,ghz)^{1.53\pm0.03}$ for $100 &lt; \nu &lt;353$ghz. (2) we map the spectral index ofdust emission at millimetre wavelengths, which is remarkably constant at$\beta_{mm} = 1.51\pm 0.13$. we compare it with the far infrared spectral indexbeta_fir derived from greybody fits at higher frequencies, and find asystematic difference, $\beta_{mm}-\beta_{fir} = -0.15$, which suggests thatthe dust sed flattens at $\nu &lt; 353\,$ghz. (3) we present spectral fits of themicrowave emission correlated with hi from 23 to 353 ghz, which separate dustand anomalous microwave emission. the flattening of the dust sed can beaccounted for with an additional component with a blackbody spectrum, whichaccounts for $(26 \pm 6)$% of the dust emission at 100 ghz and could representmagnetic dipole emission. alternatively, it could account for an increasingcontribution of carbon dust, or a flattening of the emissivity of amorphoussilicates, at millimetre wavelengths. these interpretations make differentpredictions for the dust polarization sed. (4) we identify a galacticcontribution to the residuals of the dust-hi correlation, which we model withvariations of the dust emissivity on angular scales smaller than that of ourcorrelation analysis.

1502.00612	a joint analysis of bicep2/keck array and planck data	we report the results of a joint analysis of data from bicep2/keck array andplanck. bicep2 and keck array have observed the same approximately 400 deg$^2$patch of sky centered on ra 0h, dec. $-57.5\deg$. the combined maps reach adepth of 57 nk deg in stokes $q$ and $u$ in a band centered at 150 ghz. planckhas observed the full sky in polarization at seven frequencies from 30 to 353ghz, but much less deeply in any given region (1.2 $\mu$k deg in $q$ and $u$ at143 ghz). we detect 150$\times$353 cross-correlation in $b$-modes at highsignificance. we fit the single- and cross-frequency power spectra atfrequencies $\geq 150$ ghz to a lensed-$\lambda$cdm model that includes dustand a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves (asparameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$), using a prior on thefrequency spectral behavior of polarized dust emission from previous \planck\analysis of other regions of the sky. we find strong evidence for dust and nostatistically significant evidence for tensor modes. we probe various modelvariations and extensions, including adding a synchrotron component incombination with lower frequency data, and find that these make littledifference to the $r$ constraint. finally we present an alternative analysiswhich is similar to a map-based cleaning of the dust contribution, and showthat this gives similar constraints. the final result is expressed as alikelihood curve for $r$, and yields an upper limit $r_{0.05}&lt;0.12$ at 95%confidence. marginalizing over dust and $r$, lensing $b$-modes are detected at$7.0\,\sigma$ significance.

1502.01588	planck 2015 results. x. diffuse component separation: foreground maps	planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and857 ghz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 ghz in polarization.in this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical componentseparation, and process these maps within a bayesian framework to derive aconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. for the temperatureanalysis, we combine the planck observations with the 9-year wmap sky maps andthe haslam et al. 408 mhz map to derive a joint model of cmb, synchrotron,free-free, spinning dust, co, line emission in the 94 and 100 ghz channels, andthermal dust emission. full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutionsvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the skymodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. for polarization, the model includescmb, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. these models provide excellentfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 ukover 93% of the sky for all planck frequencies up to 353 ghz, and fractionalerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. the main limitations ofthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among thespinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observationsfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. themain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies areuncertainties in the 545 and 857 ghz calibration and zero-points. forpolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the100-353 ghz bands on large angular scales in the form oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digitalconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expectedto improve in the near future.

1502.01597	planck 2015 results. xxiv. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster  counts	we present cluster counts and corresponding cosmological constraints from theplanck full mission data set. our catalogue consists of 439 clusters detectedvia their sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal down to a signal-to-noise of six, andis more than a factor of two larger than the 2013 planck cluster cosmologysample. the counts are consistent with those from 2013 and yield compatibleconstraints under the same modelling assumptions. taking advantage of thelarger catalogue, we extend our analysis to the two-dimensional distribution inredshift and signal-to-noise. we use mass estimates from two recent studies ofgravitational lensing of background galaxies by planck clusters to providepriors on the hydrostatic bias parameter, $1-b$. in addition, we use lensing ofcosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations by planck clustersas a third independent constraint on this parameter. these various calibrationsimply constraints on the present-day amplitude of matter fluctuations invarying degrees of tension with those coming from planck analysis of primaryfluctuations in the cmb; for the lowest estimated values of $1-b$ the tensionis mild, only a little over one standard deviation, while for the largestestimated value it remains substantial. we also examine constraints onextensions to the base flat $\lambda cdm$ model by combining the cluster andcmb constraints. the combination appears to favour non-minimal neutrino masses,but this possibility does little to relieve the overall tension because itsimultaneously lowers the implied value of the hubble parameter, therebyexacerbating the discrepancy with most current astrophysical estimates.improving the precision of cluster mass calibrations from the current 10%-levelto 1% would significantly strengthen these combined analyses and provide astringent test of the base $\lambda cdm$ model.

1502.05956	planck 2015 results. ix. diffuse component separation: cmb maps	we present foreground-reduced cmb maps derived from the full planck data setin both temperature and polarization. compared to the corresponding planck 2013temperature sky maps, the total data volume is larger by a factor of 3.2 forfrequencies between 30 and 70 ghz, and by 1.9 for frequencies between 100 and857 ghz. in addition, systematic errors in the forms oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, analogue-to-digital conversionuncertainties, and very long time constant errors have been dramaticallyreduced, to the extent that the cosmological polarization signal may now berobustly recovered on angular scales $\ell\gtrsim40$. on the very largestscales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared tothe expected cosmological signal, and modes with $\ell &lt; 20$ are accordinglysuppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering. as in 2013,four different cmb component separation algorithms are applied to theseobservations, providing a measure of stability with respect to algorithmic andmodelling choices. the resulting polarization maps have rms instrumental noiseranging between 0.21 and 0.27$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 55 arcmin pixels,and between 4.5 and 6.1$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 3.4 arcmin pixels. thecosmological parameters derived from the analysis of temperature power spectraare in agreement at the $1\sigma$ level with the planck 2015 likelihood.unresolved mismatches between the noise properties of the data and simulationsprevent a satisfactory description of the higher-order statistical propertiesof the polarization maps. thus, the primary applications of these polarizationmaps are those that do not require massive simulations for accurate estimationof uncertainties, for instance estimation of cross-spectra andcross-correlations, or stacking analyses.

1505.02165	next generation cosmology: constraints from the euclid galaxy cluster  survey	we study the characteristics of the galaxy cluster samples expected from theeuropean space agency's euclid satellite and forecast constraints oncosmological parameters describing a variety of cosmological models. the methodused in this paper, based on the fisher matrix approach, is the same one usedto provide the constraints presented in the euclid red book (laureijs etal.2011). we describe the analytical approach to compute the selection functionof the photometric and spectroscopic cluster surveys. based on the photometricselection function, we forecast the constraints on a number of cosmologicalparameter sets corresponding to different extensions of the standard lambdacdmmodel. the dynamical evolution of dark energy will be constrained to deltaw_0=0.03 and delta w_a=0.2 with free curvature omega_k, resulting in a(w_0,w_a) figure of merit (fom) of 291. including the planck cmb covariancematrix improves the constraints to delta w_0=0.02, delta w_a=0.07 and afom=802. the amplitude of primordial non-gaussianity, parametrised by f_nl,will be constrained to \delta f_nl ~ 6.6 for the local shape scenario, fromeuclid clusters alone. using only euclid clusters, the growth factor parameter\gamma, which signals deviations from gr, will be constrained to delta\gamma=0.02, and the neutrino density parameter to delta omega_\nu=0.0013 (ordelta \sum m_\nu=0.01). we emphasise that knowledge of the observable--massscaling relation will be crucial to constrain cosmological parameters from acluster catalogue. the euclid mission will have a clear advantage in thisrespect, thanks to its imaging and spectroscopic capabilities that will enableinternal mass calibration from weak lensing and the dynamics of clustergalaxies. this information will be further complemented by wide-areamulti-wavelength external cluster surveys that will already be available wheneuclid flies.

1509.06555	planck 2015 results. xxiii. the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich effect--cosmic  infrared background correlation	we use planck data to detect the cross-correlation between the thermalsunyaev-zeldovich (tsz) effect and the infrared emission from the galaxies thatmake up the the cosmic infrared background (cib). we first perform a stackinganalysis towards planck-confirmed galaxy clusters. we detect infrared emissionproduced by dusty galaxies inside these clusters and demonstrate that theinfrared emission is about 50% more extended than the tsz effect. modelling theemission with a navarro--frenk--white profile, we find that the radial profileconcentration parameter is $c_{500} = 1.00^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$. this indicatesthat infrared galaxies in the outskirts of clusters have higher infrared fluxthan cluster-core galaxies. we also study the cross-correlation between tsz andcib anisotropies, following three alternative approaches based on powerspectrum analyses: (i) using a catalogue of confirmed clusters detected inplanck data; (ii) using an all-sky tsz map built from planck frequency maps;and (iii) using cross-spectra between planck frequency maps. with the threedifferent methods, we detect the tsz-cib cross-power spectrum at significancelevels of (i) 6 $\sigma$, (ii) 3 $\sigma$, and (iii) 4 $\sigma$. we model thetsz-cib cross-correlation signature and compare predictions with themeasurements. the amplitude of the cross-correlation relative to the fiducialmodel is $a_{\rm tsz-cib}= 1.2\pm0.3$. this result is consistent withpredictions for the tsz-cib cross-correlation assuming the best-fitcosmological model from planck 2015 results along with the tsz and cib scalingrelations.

0806.3167	making maps from planck lfi 30ghz data with asymmetric beams and cooler  noise	the planck satellite will observe the full sky at nine frequencies from 30 to857 ghz. the goal of this paper is to examine the effects of four realisticinstrument systematics in the 30 ghz frequency maps: non-axially-symmetricbeams, sample integration, sorption cooler noise, and pointing errors. wesimulated one year long observations of four 30 ghz detectors. the simulatedtimestreams contained cmb, foreground components (both galactic andextra-galactic), instrument noise (correlated and white), and the fourinstrument systematic effects. we made maps from the timelines and examined themagnitudes of the systematics effects in the maps and their angular powerspectra. we also compared the maps of different mapmaking codes to see how theyperformed. we used five mapmaking codes (two destripers and three optimalcodes). none of our mapmaking codes makes an attempt to deconvolve the beamfrom its output map. therefore all our maps had similar smoothing due to beamsand sample integration. temperature to polarization cross-coupling due to beammismatch causes a detectable bias in the te spectrum of the cmb map. theeffects of cooler noise and pointing errors did not appear to be major concernsfor the 30 ghz channel. the only essential difference found so far betweenmapmaking codes that affects accuracy (in terms of residual rms) is baselinelength. all optimal codes give essentially indistinguishable results. adestriper gives the same result as the optimal codes when the baseline is setshort enough. for longer baselines destripers require less computing resourcesbut deliver a noisier map.

astro-ph;0004282	cosmological constraints from the cosmic microwave background	using an approximate likelihood method adapted to band--power estimates, weanalyze the ensemble of first generation cosmic microwave background anisotropyexperiments to deduce constraints over a six--dimensional parameter spacedescribing inflation--generated adiabatic, scalar fluctuations. the basicpreferences of simple inflation scenarios are consistent with the data set:flat geometries $(\omt \equiv 1-\omk \sim 1)$ and a scale--invariant primevalspectrum ($n\sim 1$) are favored. models with significant negative curvature($\omt &lt; 0.7$) are eliminated, while constraints on postive curvature are lessstringent. degeneracies among the parameters prevent independent determinationsof the matter density $\omm$ and the cosmological constant $\lambda$, and thehubble constant $\ho$ remains relatively unconstrained. we also find that theheight of the first doppler peak relative to the amplitude suggested by data atlarger $l$ indicates a high baryon content ($\omb h^2$), almost independentlyof the other parameters. besides the overall qualitative advance expected ofthe next generation experiments, their improved dipole calibrations will beparticularly useful for constraining the peak height. our analysis includes a{\em goodness--of--fit} statistic applicable to power estimates and whichindicates that the maximum likelihood model provides an acceptable fit to thedata set.

astro-ph;0104366	concerning parameter estimation using the cosmic microwave background	most parameter constraints obtained from cosmic microwave background (cmb)anisotropy data are based on power estimates and rely on approximate likelihoodfunctions; computational difficulties generally preclude an exact analysisbased on pixel values. with the specific goal of testing this kind of approach,we have performed a complete (un-approximated) likelihood analysis combiningthe cobe, saskatoon and max data sets. we examine in detail the ability ofcertain approximate techniques based on band-power estimates to recover thefull likelihood constraints. the traditional $\chi^2$-method does not alwaysfind the same best-fit model as the likelihood analysis (a bias), due mainly tothe false assumption of gaussian likelihoods that makes the method overlysensitive to data outliers. although an improvement, other approaches employingnon-gaussian flat-band likelihoods do not always faithfully reproduce thecomplete likelihood constraints either; not even when using the exact flat-bandlikelihood curves. we trace this to the neglect of spectral information bysimple flat band-power estimates. a straightforward extension incorporating alocal effective slope (of the power spectrum, $c_l$) provides a faithfulrepresentation of the likelihood surfaces without significantly increasingcomputing cost. finally, we also demonstrate that the best-fit model to thisparticular data set is a {\em good fit}, or that the observations areconsistent with gaussian sky fluctuations, according to our statistic.

astro-ph;0105129	cosmology from cosmic microwave background and galaxy clusters	we present the results of analysis of constraints on cosmological parametersfrom cosmic microwave background (cmb) alone and in combination with galaxycluster baryon fraction assuming inflation--generated adiabatic scalarfluctuations. the cmb constraints are obtained using our likelihoodapproximation method (bartlett et al., 2000, douspis et al., 2001). in thepresent analysis we use the new data coming from maxima and boomerang balloonborne experiments, the first results of the dasi interferometer together withthe cobe/dmr data. the quality of these independent data sets implies that the$c_\ell$ are rather well known, and allow reliable constraints. we found thatthe constraints in the $\omega-h_0$ plane are very tightened, favouring a flatuniverse, that the index of the primordial fluctuations is very close to one,that the primordial baryon density is now in good agreement with primordialnucleosynthesis. nevertheless degeneracies between several parameters stillexist, and for instance the constraint on the cosmological constant or thehubble constant are very weak, preferred values being low. a way to break thesedegeneracies is to ``cross-constrain'' the parameters by combining withconstraints from other independent data. we use the baryon fractiondetermination from x-ray clusters of galaxies as an additional constraint andshow that the combined analysis leads to strong constraints on all cosmologicalparameters. using a high baryon fraction ($\sim 15%$ for $h = 0.5$) we found arather low hubble constant, values around 80 km/s/mpc being ruled out. using arecent and low baryon fraction estimation ($\sim 10%$ for $h = 0.5$) we found apreferred model with a low hubble constant and a high density content($\omega_m$), an einstein--de sitter model being only weakly ruled out.

astro-ph;0210305	the cosmic microwave background anisotropy power spectrum measured by  archeops	we present a determination by the archeops experiment of the angular powerspectrum of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy in 16 bins over themultipole range l=15-350. archeops was conceived as a precursor of the planckhfi instrument by using the same optical design and the same technology for thedetectors and their cooling. archeops is a balloon-borne instrument consistingof a 1.5 m aperture diameter telescope and an array of 21 photometersmaintained at ~100 mk that are operating in 4 frequency bands centered at 143,217, 353 and 545 ghz. the data were taken during the arctic night of february7, 2002 after the instrument was launched by cnes from esrange base (sweden).the entire data cover ~ 30% of the sky.this first analysis was obtained with asmall subset of the dataset using the most sensitive photometer in each cmbband (143 and 217 ghz) and 12.6% of the sky at galactic latitudes above 30degrees where the foreground contamination is measured to be negligible. thelarge sky coverage and medium resolution (better than 15 arcminutes) providefor the first time a high signal-to-noise ratio determination of the powerspectrum over angular scales that include both the first acoustic peak andscales probed by cobe/dmr. with a binning of delta(l)=7 to 25 the error barsare dominated by sample variance for l below 200. a companion paper details thecosmological implications.

astro-ph;0210306	cosmological constraints from archeops	we analyze the cosmological constraints that archeops places on adiabaticcold dark matter models with passive power-law initial fluctuations. becauseits angular power spectrum has small bins in l and large l coverage down tocobe scales, archeops provides a precise determination of the first acousticpeak in terms of position at multipole l_peak=220 +- 6, height and width. ananalysis of archeops data in combination with other cmb datasets constrains thebaryon content of the universe, omega(b)h^2 = 0.022 (+0.003,-0.004), compatiblewith big-bang nucleosynthesis and with a similar accuracy. using cosmologicalpriors obtainedfrom recent non-cmb data leads to yet tighter constraints on thetotal density, e.g. omega(tot)=1.00 (+0.03,-0.02) using the hst determinationof the hubble constant. an excellent absolute calibration consistency is foundbetween archeops and other cmb experiments, as well as with the previouslyquoted best fit model.the spectral index n is measured to be 1.04 (+0.10,-0.12)when the optical depth to reionization, tau, is allowed to vary as a freeparameter, and 0.96 (+0.03,-0.04) when tau is fixed to zero, both in goodagreement with inflation.

astro-ph;0311381	the xmm--newton omega project: ii.cosmological implications from the  high redshift l-t relation of x-ray clusters	the evolution with redshift of the temperature-luminosity relation of x-raygalaxy clusters is a key ingredient to break degeneracies in the interpretationof x-ray clusters redshift number counts. we therefore take advantage of therecent measurements of the temperature-luminosity relation of distant clustersobserved with xmm-newton and chandra satellites to examine theoretical numbercounts expected for different available x-rays cluster samples, namely therdcs, emss, sharc, 160deg^2 and the macs at redshift greater than 0.3. wederive these counts without any adjustment, using models previously normalizedto the local temperature distribution function and to the high-z (z = 0.33)tdf. we find that these models having omega_m in the range [0.85-1.] predictcounts in remarkable agreement with the observed counts in the differentsamples. we illustrate that this conclusion is weakly sensitive to the variousingredients of the modeling. therefore number counts provide a robust evidenceof an evolving population. a realistic flat low density model (omega_m = 0.3),normalized to the local abundance of clusters is found to overproduce clusterabundance at high redshift (above z = 0.5) by nearly an order of magnitude.this result is in conflict with the popular concordance model. the conflictcould indicate a deviation from the expected scaling of the m-t relation withredshift.

astro-ph;0602424	catalog extraction in sz cluster surveys: a matched filter approach	we present a method based on matched multifrequency filters for extractingcluster catalogs from sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) surveys. we evaluate itsperformance in terms of completeness, contamination rate and photometricrecovery for three representative types of sz survey: a high resolution singlefrequency radio survey (ami), a high resolution ground-based multiband survey(spt), and the planck all-sky survey. these surveys are not purely fluxlimited, and they loose completeness significantly before their point-sourcedetection thresholds. contamination remains relatively low at &lt;5% (less than30%) for a detection threshold set at s/n=5 (s/n=3). we identify photometricrecovery as an important source of catalog uncertainty: dispersion in recoveredflux from multiband surveys is larger than the intrinsic scatter in the y-mrelation predicted from hydrodynamical simulations, while photometry in thesingle frequency survey is seriously compromised by confusion with primarycosmic microwave background anisotropy. the latter effect implies thatfollow-up observations in other wavebands (e.g., 90 ghz, x-ray) of singlefrequency surveys will be required. cluster morphology can cause a bias in therecovered y-m relation, but has little effect on the scatter; the bias would beremoved during calibration of the relation. point source confusion onlyslightly decreases multiband survey completeness; single frequency surveycompleteness could be significantly reduced by radio point source confusion,but this remains highly uncertain because we do not know the radio counts atthe relevant flux levels.

astro-ph;0702483	making maps from planck lfi 30ghz data	this paper is one of a series describing the performance and accuracy ofmap-making codes as assessed by the planck ctp working group. we compare theperformance of multiple codes written by different groups for making polarizedmaps from planck-sized, all-sky cosmic microwave background (cmb) data. threeof the codes are based on destriping algorithm, whereas the other three areimplementations of a maximum-likelihood algorithm. previous papers in theseries described simulations at 100 ghz (poutanen et al. 2006) and 217 ghz(ashdown et al. 2006). in this paper we make maps (temperature andpolarisation) from the simulated one-year observations of four 30 ghz detectorsof planck low frequency instrument (lfi). we used planck level s simulationpipeline to produce the observed time-ordered-data streams (tod). our previousstudies considered polarisation observations for the cmb only. for this paperwe increased the realism of the simulations and included polarized galacticforegrounds to our sky model. our simulated tods comprised of dipole, cmb,diffuse galactic emissions, extragalactic radio sources, and detector noise.the strong subpixel signal gradients arising from the foreground signals coupleto the output map through the map-making and cause an error (signal error) inthe maps. destriping codes have smaller signal error than themaximum-likelihood codes. we examined a number of schemes to reduce this error.on the other hand, the maximum-likelihood map-making codes can produce mapswith lower residual noise than destriping codes.

astro-ph;9407061	the case for a hubble constant of 30 km/s/mpc	although cosmologists have been trying to determine the value of the hubbleconstant for nearly 65 years, they have only succeeded in limiting the range ofpossibilities: most of the current observational determinations place thehubble constant between 50 km/s/mpc and 90 km/s/mpc. the uncertainty isunfortunate because this fundamental parameter of cosmology determines both thedistance scale and the time scale, and thereby affects almost all aspects ofcosmology. here we make the case for a hubble constant that is even smallerthan the lower bound of the accepted range, arguing on the basis of the greatadvantages, all theoretical in nature, of a hubble constant of around 30km/s/mpc. those advantages are: (1) a comfortable expansion age that avoids thecurrent age crisis; (2) a cold dark matter power spectrum whose shape is ingood agreement with the observational data and (3) which predicts an abundanceof clusters in close agreement with that of x-ray selected galaxy clusters; (4)a nonbaryonic to baryonic mass ratio that is in better agreement with recentdeterminations based upon cluster x-ray studies. in short, such a value for thehubble constant cures almost all the ills of the current theoretical orthodoxy,a flat universe comprised predominantly of cold dark matter.

astro-ph;9511084	the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and the value of omega	we consider the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect as a probe of omega_o: using aself-consistent modeling of x-ray clusters, we examine the dependence of boththe mean compton y parameter and the sz source counts on omega_o. thesequantities increase with decreasing omega_o due to the earlier epoch ofstructure formation in low-density cosmogonies; the results depend only on thequantity of gas heated to the virial temperature of collapsed objects and areindependent of the spatial distribution of the gas in the potential wells.specifically, we compare two models which reproduce the present-day abundanceof clusters - a biased, critical universe and an unbiased, open model withomega_o=0.3. we find that the mean y parameter approaches the current firaslimit of y&lt;2.5 10^{-5} for the open model, demonstrating the importance ofimproving this limit on spectral distortions, and that the sz source counts andcorresponding redshift distribution differ significantly between the twocosmogonies; millimeter surveys covering a large area should thus provideinteresting constraints on the density parameter of the universe and on theevolution of the heated gas fraction in virialized objects.

astro-ph;9611089	x-ray galaxy clusters: constraints on models of galaxy formation	we present a self-consistent approach to the modeling of x-ray clusters ofgalaxies in a flat universe. employing the press and schechter (1974) formalismto derive the mass function and relating the observable properties of clustersto their virial mass allows us to study the cluster x-ray distributionfunctions and their evolution with redshift. this approach differs from someresults based on the x-ray luminosity function, which we argue is subject tomodeling uncertainties. we obtain stringent constraints on the power spectrumof the initial density perturbations assumed to seed galaxy formation bycomparing the theoretical temperature function with available data: theamplitude $\sigma_8$ is found to be $0.57 \pm 0.05$, while the local spectralindex $n$ is falling in the range $-2.4 \leq n \leq -1.5$ on scales between 5and 15 $h^{-1}$ mpc: the standard cdm model is clearly ruled out, independentlyof the normalization. we further examine the evolutionary properties of x-rayclusters. our approach greatly clarifies the situation: contrary to someprevious claims, we find that flat models are in reasonable agreement with theobserved number of clusters at high redshif ts. we also examine thecontribution of clusters to the x-ray counts and to the soft x-ray backgroundand compare the expected values in the case of the $\omega_0=1$ and$\omega_0=0.2$ universes. the number counts are in agreement with theobservations, further confirming the relevance of our modeling. we concludethat although clusters are not the primary source of the soft x-ray background,their contribution is nevertheless non-negligible. this is particularlyimportant for they could escape the constraints imposed on possible pointsources contributing to the background. finally, we briefly

astro-ph;9712078	what does cluster redshift evolution reveal ?	evolution of the cluster population has been recognized as a powerfulcosmological tool. while the present--day abundance of x-ray clusters isdegenerate in $\sigma_8$, $n$ and $\omega_0$, oukbir and blanchard (1992, 1997)have pointed out that the number density evolution of x-ray clusters withredshift can be used to determine $\omega_0$. here, we clarify the origin ofthis statement by identifying those parameters to which the evolution ofcluster number density is most sensitive. we find that the evolution iscontrolled by only two parameters: the amplitude of fluctuations, $\sigma_m$,on the scale associated with the mass under consideration, $r = 9.5h^{1/3}\omega_0^{-1/3}$ $ m_{15}^{1/3} h^{-1}$mpc, and the cosmological backgrounddensity, $\omega_0$. in contrast, evolution is remarkably insensitive to theslope of the power spectrum. we verify that the number density evolution ofclusters is a powerful probe of the mean density of the universe, under thecondition that $\sigma_m$ is chosen to reproduce current-day abundances.comparison of the cluster abundance at $z \sim 0.5-0.6$, from the emss, to thepresent-day abundance, from the rosat bcs sample, unambiguously reveals theexistence of significant negative evolution. this number evolution, inconjunction with the absence of any negative evolution in theluminosity-temperature relation, provides robust evidence in favor of acritical density universe ($\omega_0=1$), in agreement with the analysis bysadat et al. (1998).

astro-ph;9802079	a tale of two sz sources	the recent discovery of two flux decrements in deep radio maps obtained bythe vla and the ryle telescope can have powerful implications for the densityparameter of the universe, $\omo$. we outline these implications by modelingthe decrements as the thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect from two clustersassuming their properties are similar to those of the low redshift population.in this case, the absence of any optical or x-ray counterparts argues that theclusters must be at large redshifts. we highlight the difficulty this poses fora critical cosmology by a comparison with a fiducial open model with $\omo=0.2$($\lamo=0$). applying the phenomenological x-ray luminosity-temperaturerelation needed to explain the emss cluster redshift distribution, as inferredby oukbir and blanchard (1997), we convert the x-ray band upper limits to lowerlimits on the clusters' redshifts. comparison of the counts implied by thesetwo sz detections with model predictions, for clusters with redshifts largerthan these lower limits, illustrates quantitatively the inability of thecritical cosmology to account for such high-redshift clusters. on the otherhand, the open model with $\omo=0.2$ remains consistent with the existence ofthe two objects; it possibly has, however, difficulties with current limits onspectral distortions and temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwavebackground. the discussion demonstrates the value of sz cluster searches fortesting cosmological models and theories of structure formation.

astro-ph;9810173	real and redshift-space clustering in the esp galaxy redshift survey	we discuss the two-point correlation properties of galaxies in the eso sliceproject (esp) redshift survey, both in redshift and real space. theredshift-space correlation function xi(s) for the whole magnitude-limitedsurvey is well described by a power law with \gamma ~ 1.55 between 3 and ~40/hmpc, where it smoothly breaks down, crossing the zero value on scales as largeas ~80/h mpc. on smaller scales (0.2-2/h mpc), the slope is shallower, mostlydue to redshift-space depression by virialized structures. this effect is foundto be enhanced by the j3 optimal-weighting estimator for xi. we explicitlyevidence these effects by computing xi(r_p,pi) and the projected functionw_p(r_p). in this way we recover the real-space correlation function xi(r),which we fit below 10/h mpc with a power-law model. this gives a reasonablefit, with r_o=4.15^{+0.20}_{-0.21} /h mpc and \gamma=1.67^{+0.07}_{-0.09}. thisresults on xi(r) and xi(s), and the comparison with other surveys, clearlyconfirm how the shape of spatial correlations above ~3/h mpc is characterisedby a significant `shoulder' with respect to the small-scale ~ -1.8 power law,corresponding to a steepening of p(k) near the turnover.

astro-ph;9901378	the eso slice project (esp) galaxy redshift survey. vii. the redshift  and real-space correlation functions	we present analyses of the two-point correlation properties of the esp galaxyredshift survey. from the redshift-space correlation function xi(s), we seepositive clustering out to separations ~50/h mpc, with a smooth break on largerscales and zero-crossing between 60 and 80/h mpc. xi(s) is reasonably welldescribed by a shallow power law with \gamma~1.5 between 3 and 50/h mpc, whileon smaller scales (0.2-2/h mpc) it has a shallower slope (\gamma~ 1). weexamine the full effect of redshift-space distortions through thetwo-dimensional correlation function xi(rp,pi), from which we project out thereal-space xi(r) below 10/h mpc. this function is well described by a power-lawmodel (r/r_o)^{-\gamma}, with r_o=4.15^{+0.20}_{-0.21} h^{-1} mpc and\gamma=1.67^{+0.07}_{-0.09}. comparison to other redshift surveys shows aconsistent picture in which clustering remains positive out to separations of50/h mpc or larger, in substantial agreement with the results obtained fromangular surveys like the apm and edsgc. also the shape of the two-pointcorrelation function is remarkably unanimous among these data sets, in allcases requiring more power above 5/h mpc (a `shoulder'), than a simpleextrapolation of the canonical xi(r)=(r/5)^{-1.8}. xi(s) for volume-limitedsubsamples shows evidence of luminosity segregation only for the most luminoussample with m_{b_j}\le -20.5. when redshift-space distortions are removedthrough projection of xi(rp,pi), however, a weak dependence on luminosity isseen at small separations also at fainter magnitudes. this effect is masked inredshift space, as the mean pairwise velocity dispersion experiences a parallelincrease, basically erasing the effect of the clustering growth on xi(s).

astro-ph;9908037	a new local temperature distribution function for x-ray clusters:  cosmological applications	(abridged) we present a new determination of the local temperature functionof x-ray clusters. we use a new sample comprising fifty clusters for whichtemperature information is now available, making it the largest complete sampleof its kind. it is therefore expected to significantly improve the estimationof the temperature distribution function of moderately hot clusters. we findthat the resulting temperature function is higher than previous estimations,but agrees well with the temperature distribution function inferred from thebcs and rass luminosity function. we have used this sample to constrain theamplitude of the matter fluctuations on cluster's scale of$8\sqrt[3]{\omega_0}^{-1}h^{-1}$mpc, assuming a mass-temperature relation basedon recent numerical simulations. we find $\sigma_8 = 0.6\pm 0.02$ for an$\omega_0 = 1$ model. our sample provides an ideal reference at $z \sim 0$ touse in the application of the cosmological test based on the evolution of x-raycluster abundance (oukbir &amp; blanchard 1992, 1997). using henry's sample, wefind that the abundance of clusters at $z = 0.33$ is significantly smaller, bya factor larger than 2, which shows that the emss sample provides strongevidence for evolution of the cluster abundance. a likelihood analysis leads toa rather high value of the mean density parameter of the universe: $\omega=0.92 \pm 0.22$ (open case) and $\omega =0.86 \pm 0.25$ (flat case), which isconsistent with a previous, independent estimation based on the full emsssample by sadat et al.(1998). some systematic uncertainties which could alterthis result are briefly discussed.
