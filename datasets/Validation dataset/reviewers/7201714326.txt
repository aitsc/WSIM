34047194634	Substation optimization planning based on the weighted Voronoi diagram	Substation optimization planning plays an important role in urban network planning. This paper presents a novel method for substation planning based on the weighted Voronoi diagram, which can optimize the number, capacity, location, size and power supply area of substations. First, a mathematical model is proposed to obtain the capacity combination of the new substations, in which the optimum solution and sub-optimal solutions can be obtained simultaneously by integer programming. Then, two methods are adopted to get the initial locations in terms of the existence of substations. One is the ordinary Voronoi diagram method and the other is the geometric method that takes the local topographic characteristics, the area of the planning district and load distribution into consideration. The uneven load distribution, the different rated capacities and the load rates of each substation can seriously affect the power supply area. In view of these effects, a substation optimization method based on the weighted Voronoi diagram is proposed to automatically decide the power supply area of each substation and optimize the locations of the new substations. Actual examples show that the method proposed is effective.

84920174981	Substation planning method based on the weighted voronoi diagram using an intelligent optimisation algorithm	Distribution network planning is a very complicated, non-linear, large scale multi-objective and multi-constraint combinatorial optimisation problem. The capacity, location and power supply range of the substation and the distribution network are optimised based on the load forecasting. In previous studies, this problem usually decomposes into two subproblems, one is substation planning and the other is distribution network planning. The authors propose a method based on the self-adjustment weighted Voronoi diagram (WVD) using genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimisation for planning substations, which can optimise the location and power range of the substations when both the number and capacity of the substations are known. The weight is calculated according to the substation capacity and load distribution, and then the authors form the self-adjusted WVD whose weight can be adaptively adjusted. This method ensures the convergence of the algorithm and also makes the location and power supply range of the substations more reasonable. On this basis, the self-adjusted WVD based on the elitist selection genetic algorithm (ESGA-WVD) or the particle swarm optimisation algorithm (PSO-WVD) is achieved using the global search feature of the ESGA or the PSO. Numerical results show that ESGA-WVD and PSO-WVD are more reliable and reasonable than single ESGA, PSO or WVD; both in the determination of substation location and in the division of the substation power supply range. Compared with ESGA-WVD, PSO-WVD is better in terms of running time, convergence rate and investment costs.

10844249490	An improved Tabu search for reconfiguration of distribution systems	To deal with distribution network reconfiguration, an improved Tabu search method is presented and applied to the optimization of distribution network. In this method, considering the features of distribution network, i.e., interconnected meshed network in design and radial tree structure in operation, the optimal encoding method in genetic algorithm (GA) is led into the Tabu search algorithm and the minimization of active power loss is used as the objective function. The optimization calculations of three typical IEEE testing systems by the presented method are conducted and the calculation results are compared with those by annealing algorithm (SA) and GA respectively. The comparison results show that the improved Tabu research algorithm possesses better search efficiency than GA and SA.

13244249765	Design and application of a multi-attribute decision-making system for power system planning	To improve the insufficiency of multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) ability of existing power system planning software in processing the factors with multi-indeterminacy, an interval analytical hierarchy process (IAHP) based visualized MADM system for power system planning, in which both advantages of machine calculation and human experience can be combined, is developed. By means of friendly man-machine interaction and integrating with experts' experience, the interval-based AHP models can carry out comprehensive evaluation and decision-making on the superiority of alternatives, in the decision-making process the quantitative or qualitative factors can be comprehensively taken into account and the indeterminacy of the factors and vague of experts' judgement can also be dealt with. This system is designed especially for the power system planning decision-making problem, which integrates some hierarchy templates (e.g. substation sites, network alternatives comparison) commonly used in planning. The software is developed under Visual Studio.Net environment, in which VB is adopted to develop visual interfaces and VC++ is used to implement background algorithms. Ultimately, it is integrated with a widely applied package for urban power system planning. The practical case shows that this software is an effective tool for solving MADM problem in power system planning.
