0903.1636	minor mergers and the size evolution of elliptical galaxies	using a high resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation of theformation of a massive spheroidal galaxy we show that elliptical galaxies canbe very compact and massive at high redshift in agreement with recentobservations. accretion of stripped in-falling stellar material increases thesize of the system with time and the central concentration is reduced bydynamical friction of the surviving stellar cores. in a specific case of aspheroidal galaxy with a final stellar mass of $1.5 \times 10^{11} m_{\odot}$we find that the effective radius $r_e$ increases from $0.7 \pm 0.2 \rm kpc$ atz = 3 to $r_e = 2.4 \pm 0.4 \rm kpc$ at z = 0 with a concomitant decrease inthe effective density of an order of magnitude and a decrease of the centralvelocity dispersion by approximately 20% over this time interval. a simpleargument based on the virial theorem shows that during the accretion of weaklybound material (minor mergers) the radius can increase as the square of themass in contrast to the usual linear rate of increase for major mergers. byundergoing minor mergers compact high redshift spheroids can evolve intopresent-day systems with sizes and concentrations similar to observed localellipticals. this indicates that minor mergers may be the main driver for thelate evolution of sizes and densities of early-type galaxies.

0903.2840	gravitational heating helps make massive galaxies red and dead	we study the thermal formation history of four simulated galaxies that wereshown in naab et al. (2007) to reproduce a number of observed properties ofelliptical galaxies. the temperature of the gas in the galaxies is steadilyincreasing with decreasing redshift, although much of the gas has a coolingtime shorter than the hubble time. the gas is being heated and kept hot bygravitational heating processes through the release of potential energy frominfalling stellar clumps. the energy is dissipated in supersonic collisions ofinfalling gas lumps with the ambient gas and through the dynamical capturing ofsatellite systems causing gravitational wakes that transfer energy to thesurrounding gas. furthermore dynamical friction from the infalling clumpspushes out dark matter, lowering the central dark matter density by up to afactor of two from z=3 to z=0. in galaxies in which the late formation history(z&lt;2) is dominated by minor merging and accretion the energy released(e~5x10^{59} ergs) from gravitational feedback is sufficient to form red anddead elliptical galaxies by z~1 even in the absence of supernova and agnfeedback.

0903.4682	constraints on the relationship between stellar mass and halo mass at  low and high redshift	we use a statistical approach to determine the relationship between thestellar masses of galaxies and the masses of the dark matter halos in whichthey reside. we obtain a parameterized stellar-to-halo mass (shm) relation bypopulating halos and subhalos in an n-body simulation with galaxies andrequiring that the observed stellar mass function be reproduced. we find goodagreement with constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and predictions ofsemi-analytic models. using this mapping, and the positions of the halos andsubhalos obtained from the simulation, we find that our model predictions forthe galaxy two-point correlation function (cf) as a function of stellar massare in excellent agreement with the observed clustering properties in the sdssat z=0. we show that the clustering data do not provide additional strongconstraints on the shm function and conclude that our model can thereforepredict clustering as a function of stellar mass. we compute the conditionalmass function, which yields the average number of galaxies with stellar massesin the range [m, m+dm] that reside in a halo of mass m. we study the redshiftdependence of the shm relation and show that, for low mass halos, the shm ratiois lower at higher redshift. the derived shm relation is used to predict thestellar mass dependent galaxy cf and bias at high redshift. our model predictsthat not only are massive galaxies more biased than low mass ones at allredshifts, but the bias increases more rapidly with increasing redshift formassive galaxies than for low mass ones. we present convenient fittingfunctions for the shm relation as a function of redshift, the conditional massfunction, and the bias as a function of stellar mass and redshift.

0906.0764	can gas prevent the destruction of thin stellar discs by minor mergers?	we study the effect of dissipational gas physics on the vertical heating andthickening of disc galaxies during minor mergers. we produce a suite of minormerger simulations for milky way-like galaxies. this suite consists ofcollisionless simulations as well as hydrodynamical runs including a gaseouscomponent in the galactic disc. we find that in dissipationless simulationsminor mergers cause the scale height of the disc to increase by up to a factorof ~2. when the presence of gas in the disc is taken into account thisthickening is reduced by 25% (50%) for an initial disc gas fraction of 20%(40%), leading to a final scale height z0 between 0.6 and 0.7 kpc, regardlessof the initial scale height. we argue that the presence of gas reduces discheating via two mechanisms: absorption of kinetic impact energy by the gasand/or formation of a new thin stellar disc that can cause heated stars torecontract towards the disc plane. we show that in our simulations most of thegas is consumed during the merger and thus the regrowth of a new thin disc hasa negligible impact on the z0 of the post merger galaxy. final disc scaleheights found in our simulations are in good agreement with studies of thevertical structure of spiral galaxies where the majority of the systems arefound to have scale heights of 0.4 kpc &lt; z0 &lt; 0.8 kpc. we also found no tensionbetween recent measurements of the scale height of the milky way thin disc andresults coming from our hydrodynamical simulations. we conclude that theexistence of a thin disc in the milky way and in external galaxies is not inobvious conflict with the predictions of the cdm model.

0909.0276	the effects of the ionizing radiation background on galaxy evolution	we find that the amount and nature of the assumed ionizing background canstrongly affect galaxy formation and evolution. galaxy evolution simulationstypically incorporate an ultraviolet background which falls off rapidly abovez=3; e.g., that of haardt &amp; madau (1996). however, this decline may be toosteep to fit the wmap constraints on electron scattering optical depth orobservations of intermediate redshift (z ~ 2-4) ly-alpha forest transmission.as an alternative, we present simulations of the cosmological formation ofindividual galaxies with uv backgrounds that decline more slowly at highredshift: both a simple intensity rescaling and the background recently derivedby faucher-giguere (2009), which softens the spectrum at higher redshifts. wealso test an approximation of the x-ray background with a similar z-dependence.we find for the test galaxies that an increase in either the intensity orhardness of ionizing radiation generically pushes star formation towards lowerredshifts: although overall star formation in the simulation boxes is reducedby 10-25%, the galaxies show a factor of ~2 increase in the fraction of starswithin a 30 kpc radius that are formed after z=1. other effects include lategas inflows enhanced up to 30 times, stellar half-mass radii decreased by up to30%, central velocity dispersions increased up to 40%, and a strong reductionin substructure. the magnitude of the effects depends on theenvironmental/accretion properties of the particular galaxy.

0910.0196	fully compressive tides in galaxy mergers	the disruptive effect of galactic tides is a textbook example ofgravitational dynamics. however, depending on the shape of the potential, tidescan also become fully compressive. when that is the case, they might trigger orstrengthen the formation of galactic substructures (star clusters, tidal dwarfgalaxies), instead of destroying them. we perform n-body simulations ofinteracting galaxies to quantify this effect. we demonstrate that tidalcompression occurs repeatedly during a galaxy merger, independently of thespecific choice of parameterization. with a model tailored to the antennaegalaxies, we show that the distribution of compressive tides matches thelocations and timescales of observed substructures. after extending our studyto a broad range of parameters, we conclude that neither the importance of thecompressive tides (~15% of the stellar mass) nor their duration (~ 10 myr) arestrongly affected by changes in the progenitors' configurations and orbits.moreover, we show that individual clumps of matter can enter compressiveregions several times in the course of a simulation. we speculate that this mayspawn multiple star formation episodes in some star clusters, through e.g.,enhanced gas retention.

0910.2232	the evolution of black hole scaling relations in galaxy mergers	we study the evolution of black holes (bhs) on the m_bh-sigma andm_bh-m_bulge planes as a function of time in disk galaxies undergoing mergers.we begin the simulations with the progenitor black hole masses being initiallybelow (delta log m_bh=-2), on (delta log m_bh=0) and above (delta log m_bh=0.5)the observed local relations. the final relations are rapidly established afterthe final coalescense of the galaxies and their bhs. progenitors with lowinitial gas fractions (f_gas=0.2) starting below the relations evolve onto therelations (delta log m_bh=-0.18), progenitors on the relations stay there(delta log m_bh=0) and finally progenitors above the relations evolve towardsthe relations, but still remaining above them (delta log m_bh=0.35). mergers inwhich the progenitors have high initial gas fractions (f_gas=0.8) evolve abovethe relations in all cases (delta log m_bh=0.5). we find that the initial gasfraction is the prime source of scatter in the observed relations, dominatingover the scatter arising from the evolutionary stage of the merger remnants.the fact that bhs starting above the relations do not evolve onto therelations, indicates that our simulations rule out the scenario in whichovermassive bhs evolve onto the relations through gas-rich mergers. byimplication our simulations thus disfavor the picture in which supermassive bhsdevelop significantly before their parent bulges.

1003.0685	one moment in time - modeling star formation in the antennae	we present a new high-resolution n-body/sph simulation of an encounter of twogas-rich disk galaxies which closely matches the morphology and kinematics ofthe interacting antennae galaxies (ngc 4038/39). the simulation includesradiative cooling, star formation and feedback from snii. the large-scalemorphology and kinematics are determined by the internal structure and theorbit of the progenitor disks. the properties of the central region, inparticular the starburst in the overlap region, only match the observations fora very short time interval of ~20 myr after the second encounter. thisindicates that the antennae galaxies are in a special phase only about 40 myrafter the second encounter and 50 myr before their final collision. this is theonly phase in the simulation when a gas-rich overlap region between the nucleiis forming accompanied by enhanced star formation. the star formation rate aswell as the recent star formation history in the central region agree well withobservational estimates. for the first time this new model explains thedistributed extra-nuclear star formation in the antennae galaxies as aconsequence of the recent second encounter. the proposed model predicts thatthe antennae are in a later merger stage than the mice (ngc 4676) and wouldtherefore lose their first place in the classical toomre sequence.

1005.4058	the growth of dark matter halos: evidence for significant smooth  accretion	we study the growth of dark matter halos in the concordance lcdm cosmologyusing several n-body simulations of large cosmological volumes. we build mergertrees from the millennium and millennium-ii simulations, covering a range10^9-10^15 msun in halo mass and 1-10^5 in merger mass ratio. our algorithmtakes special care of halo fragmentation and ensures that the mass contributionof each merger to halo growth is only counted once. this way the integratedmerger rate converges and we can consistently determine the contribution ofmergers of different mass ratios to halo growth. we find that all resolvedmergers, up to mass ratios of 10^5, contribute only ~60% of the total halo massgrowth, while major mergers are subdominant, e.g. mergers with mass ratiossmaller than 3:1 (10:1) contribute only ~20% (~30%). this is verified with ananalysis of two additional simulation boxes, where we follow all particlesindividually throughout cosmic time. our results are also robust against usingseveral halo definitions. under the assumption that the power-law behaviour ofthe merger rate at large mass ratios can be extrapolated to arbitrarily largemass ratios, it is found that, independently of halo mass, ~40% of the mass inhalos comes from genuinely smooth accretion of dark matter that was never boundin smaller halos. we discuss possible implications of our findings for galaxyformation. one implication, assuming as is standard that the pristineintergalactic medium is heated and photoionized by uv photons, is that allhalos accrete &gt;40% of their baryons in smooth "cold" t&gt;~10^4k gas, rather thanas warm, enriched or clumpy gas or as stars.

1009.0011	detailed numerical simulations on the formation of pillars around  hii-regions	we study the structural evolution of turbulent molecular clouds under theinfluence of ionizing radiation emitted from a nearby massive star byperforming a high resolution parameter study with the ivine code. thetemperature is taken to be 10k or 100k, the mean number density is either100cm^3 or 300cm^3. besides, the turbulence is varied between mach 1.5 and mach12.5 and the main driving scale between 1pc and 8pc. we vary the ionizing fluxby an order of magnitude. in our simulations the ionizing radiation enhancesthe initial turbulent density distribution and thus leads to the formation ofpillar-like structures observed adjacent to hii regions in a natural way.gravitational collapse occurs regularly at the tips of the structures. we finda clear correlation between the initial state of the turbulent cold cloud andthe final morphology and physical properties of the structures formed. the mostfavorable regime for the formation of pillars is mach 4-10. structures andtherefore stars only form if the initial density contrast between the highdensity unionized gas and the gas that is going to be ionized is lower than thetemperature contrast between the hot and the cold gas. the density of theresulting pillars is determined by a pressure equilibrium between the hot andthe cold gas. a thorough analysis of the simulations shows that the complexkinematical and geometrical structure of the formed elongated filamentsreflects that of observed pillars to an impressive level of detail. inaddition, we find that the observed line-of sight velocities allow for adistinct determination of different formation mechanisms. comparing the currentsimulations to previous results and recent observations we conclude that e.g.the pillars of creation in m16 formed by the mechanism proposed here and not bythe radiation driven implosion of pre-existing clumps.

1010.1381	the two phases of galaxy formation	cosmological simulations of galaxy formation appear to show a two-phasecharacter with a rapid early phase at z&gt;2 during which in-situ stars are formedwithin the galaxy from infalling cold gas followed by an extended phase sincez&lt;3 during which ex-situ stars are primarily accreted. in the latter phasemassive systems grow considerably in mass and radius by accretion of smallersatellite stellar systems formed at quite early times (z&gt;3) outside of thevirial radius of the forming central galaxy. these tentative conclusions areobtained from high resolution re-simulations of 39 individual galaxies in afull cosmological context with present-day virial halo masses ranging from 7e11m_sun h^-1 &lt; m_vir &lt; 2.7e13 m_sun h^-1 and central galaxy masses between 4.5e10m_sun h^-1 &lt; m_* &lt; 3.6e11 m_sun h^-1. the simulations include the effects of auniform uv background, radiative cooling, star formation and energetic feedbackfrom snii. the importance of stellar accretion increases with galaxy mass andtowards lower redshift. in our simulations lower mass galaxies ($m_* &lt; 9e10m_sun h^-1) accrete about 60 per cent of their present-day stellar mass. highmass galaxy ($m_* &gt; 1.7e11 m_sun h^-1) assembly is dominated by accretion andmerging with about 80 per cent of the stars added by the present-day. ingeneral the simulated galaxies approximately double their mass since z=1. formassive systems this mass growth is not accompanied by significant starformation. the majority of the in-situ created stars is formed at z&gt;2,primarily out of cold gas flows. we recover the observational result ofarchaeological downsizing, where the most massive galaxies harbor the oldeststars. we find that this is not in contradiction with hierarchical structureformation. most stars in the massive galaxies are formed early on in smallerstructures, the galaxies themselves are assembled late.

1012.4465	disruption of star clusters in the interacting antennae galaxies	we reexamine the age distribution of star clusters in the antennae in thecontext of n-body+hydrodynamical simulations of these interacting galaxies. allof the simulations that account for the observed morphology and otherproperties of the antennae have star formation rates that vary relativelyslowly with time, by factors of only 1.3 - 2.5 in the past 10^8 yr. incontrast, the observed age distribution of the clusters declines approximatelyas a power law, dn/dt \propto t^{gamma} with gamma = -1.0, for ages 10^6 yr \lat \la 10^9 yr. these two facts can only be reconciled if the clusters aredisrupted progressively for at least 10^8 yr and possibly 10^9 yr. when wecombine the simulated formation rates with a power-law model, f_surv \proptot^{delta}, for the fraction of clusters that survive to each age t, we matchthe observed age distribution with exponents in the range -0.9 \la delta \la-0.6 (with a slightly different delta for each simulation). the similaritybetween delta and gamma indicates that dn/dt is shaped mainly by the disruptionof clusters rather than variations in their formation rate. thus, the situationin the interacting antennae resembles that in relatively quiescent galaxiessuch as the milky way and the magellanic clouds.

1102.3801	the atlas3d project - ii. morphologies, kinemetric features and  alignment between photometric and kinematic axes of early-type galaxies	[abridged] we use the atlas3d sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) tostudy the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, psi, defined as the anglebetween the photometric and kinematic major axis. we find that 71% of nearbyetgs are strictly aligned systems (psi &gt; 5 deg), an additional 14% have 5 &lt; psi&lt; 10 deg and 90% of galaxies have psi &lt; 15 deg. taking into account measurementuncertainties, 90% of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5 deg,suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (~10%) are notconsistent with axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. we identifymorphological features such as bars and rings (30%), dust structures (16%),blue nuclear colours (6%) and evidence of interactions (8%). we use kinemetryto analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies in two broad types ofregular and non-regular rotators. we find 82% of regular rotators and 17%non-regular rotators, with 2 galaxies that we were not able to classify due todata quality. the non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions andare massive. the majority of galaxies do not have any specific kinemetricfeatures, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinctcores (7%) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4%).most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and arenon-regular rotators. while the trends are weak, there is a tendency that largevalues of psi are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities andamong the most massive galaxies in the sample. we suggest that the most commonformation mechanism for etgs preserves the axisymmetry of the disk progenitors.less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with muchlower net angular momentum.

1102.4444	the atlas3d project - iii. a census of the stellar angular momentum  within the effective radius of early-type galaxies: unveiling the  distribution of fast and slow rotators	we provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 re of avolume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) in the nearby universe,using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the atlas3dproject. we exploit the lambdar parameter to characterise the existence of twofamilies of etgs: slow rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fieldsand often include stellar kinematically distinct cores (kdcs), and fastrotators which have regular velocity fields. our complete sample of 260 etgsleads to a new criterion to disentangle fast and slow rotators which nowincludes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (epsilon). it separates thetwo classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than acriterion based on v/sigma: slow rotators and fast rotators have lambdar lowerand larger than kfsxsqrt(epsilon), respectively, where kfs=0.31 formeasurements made within 1 re. we show that the vast majority of early-typegalaxies are fast rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with alignedphotometric and kinematic axes (paper ii, krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discsand often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in thevolume-limited atlas3d sample. fast rotators span the full range of apparentellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsicellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologiesconsistent with spiral galaxies. only a small fraction of etgs are slowrotators representing 14% (36/260) of the atlas3d sample of etgs. of all slowrotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like componentsand are rather low mass objects (mdyn&lt;10^10.5 m_sun). all other slow rotators(32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (epsilon_e&lt;0.4), tend to be massive(mdyn&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), and often (17/32) exhibit kdcs.

1103.2313	flow-driven cloud formation and fragmentation: results from eulerian and  lagrangian simulations	the fragmentation of shocked flows in a thermally bistable medium provides anatural mechanism to form turbulent cold clouds as precursors to molecularclouds. yet because of the large density and temperature differences and therange of dynamical scales involved, following this process with numericalsimulations is challenging. we compare two-dimensional simulations offlow-driven cloud formation without self-gravity, using the lagrangian smoothedparticle hydrodynamics (sph) code vine and the eulerian grid code proteus.results are qualitatively similar for both methods, yet the variable spatialresolution of the sph method leads to smaller fragments and thinner filaments,rendering the overall morphologies different. thermal and hydro-dynamicalinstabilities lead to rapid cooling and fragmentation into cold clumps withtemperatures below 300k. for clumps more massive than 1 msun/pc, the clump massfunction has an average slope of -0.8. the internal velocity dispersion of theclumps is nearly an order of magnitude smaller than their relative motion,rendering it subsonic with respect to the internal sound speed of the clumps,but supersonic as seen by an external observer. for the sph simulations most ofthe cold gas resides at temperatures below 100k, while the grid-based modelsshow an additional, substantial component between 100 and 300k. independentlyof the numerical method our models confirm that converging flows of warmneutral gas fragment rapidly and form high-density, low-temperature clumps aspossible seeds for star formation.

1104.0246	the effects of a hot gaseous halo in galaxy major mergers	cosmological hydrodynamical simulations as well as observations indicate thatspiral galaxies are comprised of five different components: dark matter halo,stellar disc, stellar bulge, gaseous disc and gaseous halo. while the firstfour components have been extensively considered in numerical simulations ofbinary galaxy mergers, the effect of a hot gaseous halo has usually beenneglected even though it can contain up to 80% of the total gas within thegalaxy virial radius. we present a series of hydrodynamic simulations of majormergers of disc galaxies, that for the first time include a diffuse, rotating,hot gaseous halo. through cooling and accretion, the hot halo can dissipate andrefuel the cold gas disc before and after a merger. this cold gas cansubsequently form stars, thus impacting the morphology and kinematics of theremnant. simulations of isolated systems with total mass m~10^12msun show anearly constant star formation rate of ~5msun/yr if the hot gaseous halo isincluded, while the star formation rate declines exponentially if it isneglected. we conduct a detailed study of the star formation efficiency duringmergers and find that the presence of a hot gaseous halo reduces the starburstefficiency (e=0.5) compared to simulations without a hot halo (e=0.68).moreover we find cases where the stellar mass of the merger remnant is lowerthan the sum of the stellar mass of the two progenitor galaxies when evolved inisolation. this suggests a revision to semi-analytic galaxy formation modelswhich assume that a merger always leads to enhanced star formation. we showthat adding the hot gas component has a significant effect on the kinematicsand internal structure of the merger remnants, like an increased abundance offast rotators and an r^(1/4) surface brightness profile at small scales.

1104.3545	the atlas3d project - vii. a new look at the morphology of nearby  galaxies: the kinematic morphology-density relation	we look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies.edge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. they appear like spiral galaxieswith the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals withdisky isophotes. fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range ofbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. the slow rotators are rounder and aregenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, ellipticalgalaxies. we propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by hubble as itgives a misleading description of etgs. we study for the first time thekinematic morphology-density t-sigma relation using fast and slow rotators toreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. we find that our relation is cleaner thanusing classic morphology. slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest densityenvironments [f(sr)&lt;2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(sr)~4%] ofthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, withthe exception of the densest core of the virgo cluster [f(sr)~20%]. we find aclean log-linear relation between the fraction f(sp) of spiral galaxies and thelocal galaxy surface density. the existence of a smooth kinematic t-sigmarelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment asmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators inlow-density environments. it shows that the segregation is driven by localeffects at the small-group scale. only at the largest densities in the virgocore does the f(sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while thefraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. this suggests thata different mechanism is at work there.

1107.5059	the atlas3d project-- viii: modelling the formation and evolution of  fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies within $\lambda$cdm	we propose a simple model for the origin of fast and slow rotator early-typegalaxies (etg) within the hierarchical $\lambda$cdm scenario, that is based onthe assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in etgs is a proxy forthe specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda_r$. within our model wereproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude inthe \atl survey, assuming that fast rotating etgs have at least 10% of theirtotal stellar mass in a disc component. in agreement with \atl observations wefind that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with $ m_* &gt; 10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$ contributing $\sim 20%$ to the overall etg population. we show indetail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different,supporting the classification of etgs into these two categories. slow rotatorsaccrete between $\sim 50% -90%$ of their stellar mass from satellites and theirmost massive progenitors have on average up to 3 major mergers during theirevolution. fast rotators in contrast, accrete less than 50% and have on averageless than one major merger in their past.  we find that the underlying physical reason for the different growthhistories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas coolingin massive galaxies. once cooling and associated star formation in disc stops,galaxies grow via infall from satellites. frequent minor mergers thereby,destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lowerthe specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda_r$into the slow rotator regime. abridged...

1202.3308	a systematic variation of the stellar initial mass function in  early-type galaxies	much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emittedby their stars. it depends on the stellar initial mass function (imf)describing the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed.consequently knowledge of the imf is critical to virtually every aspect ofgalaxy evolution. more than half a century after the first imf determination,no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal in different galaxies.previous studies indicated that the imf and the dark matter fraction in galaxycentres cannot be both universal, but they could not break the degeneracybetween the two effects. only recently indications were found that massiveelliptical galaxies may not have the same imf as our milky way. here we reportunambiguous evidence for a strong systematic variation of the imf in early-typegalaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratio, producingdifferences up to a factor of three in mass. this was inferred from detaileddynamical models of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the largeatlas3d representative sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two ordersof magnitude in stellar mass. our finding indicates that the imf dependsintimately on a galaxy's formation history.

1205.5807	galactic star formation and accretion histories from matching galaxies  to dark matter haloes	we present a new statistical method to determine the relationship between thestellar masses of galaxies and the masses of their host dark matter haloes overthe entire cosmic history from z~4 to the present. this multi-epoch abundancematching (meam) model self-consistently takes into account that satellitegalaxies first become satellites at times earlier than they are observed. weemploy a redshift-dependent parameterization of the stellar-to-halo massrelation to populate haloes and subhaloes in the millennium simulations withgalaxies, requiring that the observed stellar mass functions at severalredshifts be reproduced simultaneously. using merger trees extracted from thedark matter simulations in combination with meam, we predict the averageassembly histories of galaxies, separating into star formation within thegalaxies (in-situ) and accretion of stars (ex-situ). the peak star formationefficiency decreases with redshift from 23% at z=0 to 9% at z=4 while thecorresponding halo mass increases from 10^11.8m\odot to 10^12.5m\odot. the starformation rate of central galaxies peaks at a redshift which depends on halomass; for massive haloes this peak is at early cosmic times while for low-massgalaxies the peak has not been reached yet. in haloes similar to that of themilky-way about half of the central stellar mass is assembled after z=0.7. inlow-mass haloes, the accretion of satellites contributes little to the assemblyof their central galaxies, while in massive haloes more than half of thecentral stellar mass is formed ex-situ with significant accretion of satellitesat z&lt;2. we find that our method implies a cosmic star formation history and anevolution of specific star formation rates which are consistent with thoseinferred directly. we present convenient fitting functions for stellar masses,star formation rates, and accretion rates as functions of halo mass andredshift.

1206.5004	how do minor mergers promote inside-out growth of ellipticals,  transforming the size, density profile and dark matter fraction?	there is observational evidence for inside-out growth of elliptical galaxiessince $z \gtrsim 2-3$, which is not driven by in-situ star formation. manysystems at high redshift have small sizes $\sim 1kpc$ and surface brightnessprofiles with low sersic indices n. the most likely descendants have, onaverage, grown by a factor of two in mass and a factor of four in size,indicating $r \propto m^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \gtrsim 2$. they also havesurface brightness profiles with $n \gtrsim 5$. this evolution can bequalitatively explained on the basis of two assumptions: compact ellipticalspredominantly grow by collisionless minor or intermediate 'dry' mergers, andthey are embedded in massive dark matter halos. we draw these conclusions fromidealized collisionless mergers spheroidal galaxies - with and without darkmatter - with mass ratios of 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10. the sizes evolve as $r \proptom^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha &lt; 2$ for mass-ratios of 1:1. for minor mergers ofgalaxies embedded in dark matter halos, the sizes grow significantly faster andthe profile shapes change more rapidly. mergers with moderate mass-ratios of1:5 give $\alpha \sim 2.3$ and a final sersic index of $n = 9.5$ after doublingthe stellar mass. this is accompanied by a significant increase of the darkmatter fraction within the stellar half-mass radius, driven by the strong sizeincrease probing larger, dark matter dominated regions. only a few intermediatemass-ratio mergers of galaxies embedded in massive dark matter halos can resultin the observed concurrent inside-out growth and the rapid evolution in profileshapes. apart from negative stellar metallicity gradients such a 'minor' mergerscenario also predicts significantly lower dark matter fractions for $z \sim 2$compact quiescent galaxies and their rare present day analogues (abbreviated).

1206.6112	origin of the anti-hierarchical growth of black holes	observational studies have revealed a "downsizing" trend in black hole (bh)growth: the number densities of luminous agn peak at higher redshifts thanthose of faint agn. this would seem to imply that massive black holes formedbefore low mass black holes, in apparent contradiction to hierarchicalclustering scenarios. we investigate whether this observed "downsizing" in bhgrowth is reproduced in a semi-analytic model for the formation and evolutionof galaxies and black holes, set within the hierarchical paradigm for structureformation (somerville et al. 2008; s08). in this model, black holes evolve fromlight seeds (\sim100m\odot) and their growth is merger-driven. the original s08model (baseline model) reproduces the number density of agn at intermediateredshifts and luminosities, but underproduces luminous agn at very highredshift (z &gt; 3) and overproduces them at low redshift (z &lt; 1). in addition,the baseline model underproduces low-luminosity agn at low redshift (z &lt; 1). tosolve these problems we consider several modifications to the physicalprocesses in the model: (1) a 'heavy' black hole seeding scenario (2) asub-eddington accretion rate ceiling that depends on the cold gas fraction, and(3) an additional black hole accretion mode due to disk instabilities. withthese three modifications, the models can explain the observed downsizing,successfully reproduce the bolometric agn luminosity function andsimultaneously reproduce galaxy and black hole properties in the localuniverse. we also perform a comparison with the observed soft and hard x-rayluminosity functions of agn, including an empirical correction for torus-levelobscuration, and reach similar conclusions. our best-fit model suggests ascenario in which disk instabilities are the main driver for moderatelyluminous seyfert galaxies at low redshift, while major mergers are the maintrigger for luminous agn.

1207.5897	the sins/zc-sinf survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: outflow properties	based on sinfoni ha, [nii] and [sii] ao data of 30 z \sim 2 star-forminggalaxies (sfgs) from the sins and zcsinf surveys, we find a strong correlationof the ha broad flux fraction with the star formation surface density of thegalaxy, with an apparent threshold for strong outflows occurring at 1 msunyr^-1 kpc^-2. above this threshold, we find that sfgs with logm_\ast&gt;10 havesimilar or perhaps greater wind mass loading factors (eta = mdotout/sfr) andfaster outflow velocities than lower mass sfgs. this trend suggests that themajority of outflowing gas at z \sim 2 may derive from high-mass sfgs, and thatthe z \sim 2 mass-metallicity relation is driven more by dilution of enrichedgas in the galaxy gas reservoir than by the efficiency of outflows. the massloading factor is also correlated with the sfr and inclination, such that morestar-forming and face-on galaxies launch more powerful outflows. for galaxiesthat have evidence for strong outflows, we find that the broad emission isspatially extended to at least the half-light radius (\sim a few kpc). wepropose that the observed threshold for strong outflows and the observed massloading of these winds can be explained by a simple model wherein break-out ofwinds is governed by pressure balance in the disk. using the ratio of the [sii]doublet in a broad and narrow component, we find that outflowing gas has adensity of \sim10-100 cm^-3, significantly less than that of the star forminggas (600 cm^-3).

1209.3741	the mass and angular momentum distribution of simulated massive  early-type galaxies to large radii	we study the dark and luminous mass distributions, circular velocity curves(cvc), line-of-sight kinematics, and angular momenta for a sample of 42cosmological zoom simulations of massive galaxies. using a temporal smoothingtechnique, we are able to reach large radii. we find that: (i)the dark matterhalo density profiles outside a few kpc follow simple power-law models, withflat dark matter cvcs for lower-mass systems, and rising cvcs for high-masshaloes. the projected stellar density distributions at large radii can befitted by sersic functions with n&gt;10, larger than for typical etgs. (ii)themassive systems have nearly flat total cvcs at large radii, while the lessmassive systems have mildly decreasing cvcs. the slope of the cvc at largeradii correlates with v_circ itself. (iii)the dark matter fractions within reare in the range 15-30% and increase to 40-65% at 5re. larger and more massivegalaxies have higher dark matter fractions. (iv)the short axes of simulatedgalaxies and their host dark matter haloes are well aligned and theirshort-to-long axis ratios are correlated. (v)the stellar vrms(r) profiles areslowly declining, in agreement with planetary nebulae observations in the outerhaloes of most etgs. (vi)the line-of-sight velocity fields v show that rotationproperties at small and large radii are correlated. most radial profiles forthe cumulative specific angular momentum parameter lambda(r) are nearly flat orslightly rising, with values in [0.06,0.75] from 2re to 5re. (vii)stellar mass,ellipticity at 5re, and lambda(5re) are correlated: the more massive systemshave less angular momentum and are rounder, as for observed etgs.

1209.4107	discovery of a giant hi tail in the galaxy group hcg 44	we report the discovery of a giant hi tail in the intra-group medium of hcg44 as part of the atlas3d survey. the tail is ~300 kpc long in projection andcontains ~5x10^8 m_sun of hi. we detect no diffuse stellar light at thelocation of the tail down to ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2 in g band. we speculate thatthe tail might have formed as gas was stripped from the outer regions of ngc3187 (a member of hcg 44) by the group tidal field. in this case, a simplemodel indicates that about 1/3 of the galaxy's hi was stripped during a timeinterval of &lt;1 gyr. alternatively, the tail may be the remnant of aninteraction between hcg 44 and ngc 3162, a spiral galaxy now ~650 kpc away fromthe group. regardless of the precise formation mechanism, the detected hi tailshows for the first time direct evidence of gas stripping in hcg 44. it alsohighlights that deep hi observations over a large field are needed to gather acomplete census of this kind of events in the local universe.

1210.8167	the atlas3d project - xvii. linking photometric and kinematic signatures  of stellar discs in early-type galaxies	[abridged] we analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the atlas3dsample by fitting a single sersic profile and decomposing all non-barredobjects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parameterised by an exponentialand a general sersic function. the aim of this analysis is to look forsignatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies andcompare them to kinematic properties. using sersic index from single componentfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- andearly-type galaxies, is not recommended. assuming that objects with n&gt;3 areslow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability tocorrectly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previouslyclassified as ellipticals). we show that exponential sub-components, as well aslight profiles fitted with only a single component of a low sersic index, canbe linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. themedian disk-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0,respectively. similarly, the median sersic indices of the bulge (general sersiccomponent) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. overall,discs or disc-like structures, are present in 83 per cent of early-typegalaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disk-to-totallight ratios. discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent tothe total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. the decomposition intodiscs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separationbetween fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a59 per cent probability to correctly recognise slow rotators. kinematics (i.e.projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influenceof the inclination effects.

1211.3420	the dark halo - spheroid conspiracy and the origin of elliptical  galaxies	dynamical modeling and strong lensing data indicate that the total densityprofiles of early-type galaxies are close to isothermal, i.e., rho_tot ~r^gamma with gamma approx -2. to understand the origin of this universal slopewe study a set of simulated spheroids formed in isolated binary mergers as wellas the formation within the cosmological framework. the total stellar plus darkmatter density profiles can always be described by a power law with an index ofgamma approx -2.1 with a tendency toward steeper slopes for more compact,lower-mass ellipticals. in the binary mergers the amount of gas involved in themerger determines the precise steepness of the slope. this agrees with resultsfrom the cosmological simulations where ellipticals with steeper slopes have ahigher fraction of stars formed in situ. each gas-poor merger event evolves theslope toward gamma ~ -2, once this slope is reached further merger events donot change it anymore. all our ellipticals have flat intrinsic combined stellarand dark matter velocity dispersion profiles. we conclude that flat velocitydispersion profiles and total density distributions with a slope of gamma ~ -2for the combined system of stars and dark matter act as a natural attractor.the variety of complex formation histories as present in cosmologicalsimulations, including major as well as minor merger events, is essential togenerate the full range of observed density slopes seen for present-dayelliptical galaxies.

1211.4615	the atlas3d project - xxi. correlations between gradients of local  escape velocity and stellar populations in early-type galaxies	we explore the connection between the local escape velocity, v_esc, and thestellar population properties in the atlas3d survey, a complete, volume-limitedsample of nearby early-type galaxies. we make use of ugriz photometry toconstruct multi-gaussian expansion models of the surface brightnesses of ourgalaxies. we are able to fit the full range of surface brightness profilesfound in our sample, and in addition we reproduce the results ofstate-of-the-art photometry in the literature with residuals of 0.04 mags. weutilise these photometric models and sauron integral-field spectroscopy,combined with jeans dynamical modelling, to determine the local v_esc derivedfrom the surface brightness. we find that the local v_esc is tightly correlatedwith the mgb and fe5015 linestrengths and optical colours, and anti-correlatedwith the hbeta linestrength. in the case of the mgb and colour - v_escrelations we find that the relation within individual galaxies follows theglobal relation between different galaxies. we intentionally ignored anyuncertain contribution due to dark matter since we are seeking an empiricaldescription of stellar population gradients in early-type galaxies that isideal for quantitative comparison with model predictions. we identify apopulation of galaxies that occur only at low v_esc that exhibit negativegradients in the mgb - and colour -v_esc relations. these galaxies typicallyhave young central stellar populations and contain significant amounts ofmolecular gas and dust. combining these results with n-body simulations ofbinary mergers we use the mgb-v_esc relation to constrain the possible numberof dry mergers experienced by the local early-type galaxy population - atypical massive etg can have experienced only ~1.5 major mergers beforebecoming a significant outlier in the mgb-v_esc relation.

1211.6160	the sins/zc-sinf survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: the nature of  dispersion dominated galaxies	we analyze the spectra, spatial distributions and kinematics of ha, [nii] and[sii] emission in a sample of 42, z~2.2 uv/optically selected star forminggalaxies (sfgs) from the sins &amp; zc-sinf surveys, 35 of which were observed inthe adaptive optics mode of sinfoni. this is supplemented by kinematic datafrom 48 z~1-2.5 galaxies from the literature. we find that the kinematicclassification of the high-z sfgs as `dispersion dominated' or `rotationdominated' correlates most strongly with their intrinsic sizes. smallergalaxies are more likely `dispersion-dominated' for two main reasons: 1) therotation velocity scales linearly with galaxy size but intrinsic velocitydispersion does not depend on size, and as such, their ratio is systematicallylower for smaller galaxies, and 2) beam smearing strongly decreases large-scalevelocity gradients and increases observed dispersion much more for galaxieswith sizes at or below the resolution. dispersion dominated sfgs may thus haveintrinsic properties similar to `rotation dominated' sfgs, but are primarilymore compact, lower mass, less metal enriched and may have higher gasfractions, plausibly because they represent an earlier evolutionary state.

1212.2288	the atlas3d project - xxii. low-efficiency star formation in early-type  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations	we study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolutionhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type andspiral galaxies. despite using a universal local law to form stars in thesimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spiralson the large-scale kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times lessefficiently. this offset is in agreement with previous results on morphologicalquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded inearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. asa result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach ashigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. even if some molecular gas ispresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantlyreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. we alsoanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their coand hi surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by theirnon-stellar 8um emission. as predicted by the simulations, we find that theearly-type galaxies are offset from the kennicutt relation compared to thespirals, with a twice lower efficiency. finally, we validate our approach byperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. we run asimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of ngc524, alenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation ratein good agreement with the observations. morphological quenching thus seems tobe a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of areduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the cold gasssurvey. this lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain theformation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening ofsome galaxies.

1212.2630	the atlas 3d project - xvi. physical parameters and spectral line energy  distributions of the molecular gas in gas-rich early-type galaxies	[abridged] we present a detailed study of the physical properties of themolecular gas in a sample of 18 molecular gas-rich early-type galaxies (etgs)from the atlas$ 3d sample. our goal is to better understand the star formationprocesses occurring in those galaxies, starting here with the densestar-forming gas. we use existing integrated $^{12}$co(1-0, 2-1),$^{13}$co(1-0, 2-1), hcn(1-0) and hco$^{+}$(1-0) observations and present new$^{12}$co(3-2) single-dish data. from these, we derive for the first time theaverage kinetic temperature, h$_{2}$ volume density and column density of theemitting gas, this using a non-lte theoretical model. since the co lines tracedifferent physical conditions than of those the hcn and hco$^{+}$ lines, thetwo sets of lines are treated separately. we also compare for the first timethe predicted co spectral line energy distributions (sleds) and gas propertiesof our molecular gas-rich etgs with those of a sample of nearby well-studieddisc galaxies. the gas excitation conditions in 13 of our 18 etgs appearanalogous to those in the centre of the milky way. such results have never beenobtained before for etgs and open a new window to explore furtherstar-formation processes in the universe. the conclusions drawn shouldnevertheless be considered carefully, as they are based on a limited number ofobservations and on a simple model. in the near future, with higher cotransition observations, it should be possible to better identify the variousgas components present in etgs, as well as more precisely determine theirassociated physical conditions. to achieve these goals, we show here from ourtheoretical study, that mid-j co lines (such as the $^{12}$co(6-5) line) areparticularly useful.

1301.2589	the atlas3d project - xix. the hot-gas content of early-type galaxies:  fast versus slow rotators	for early-type galaxies, the ability to sustain a corona of hot, x-rayemitting gas could have played a key role in quenching their star-formationhistory. yet, it is still unclear what drives the precise amount of hot gasaround these galaxies. by combining photometric and spectroscopic measurementsfor the early-type galaxies observed during the atlas3d integral-field surveywith measurements of their x-ray luminosity based on x-ray data of both low andhigh spatial resolution we conclude that the hot-gas content of early-typegalaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. specifically, whereas slowrotators generally have x-ray halos with luminosity l_x,gas and temperature tvalues that are in line with what is expected if the hot-gas emission issustained by the thermalisaton of the kinetic energy carried by thestellar-mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display l_x,gas values thatfall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar t valuesthat do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy as observed in the case ofslow rotators. considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsicallyflatter than slow rotators, and that the few l_x,gas-deficient slow rotatorsalso happen to be relatively flat, the observed l_x,gas deficiency in theseobjects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a hardertime in retaining their hot gas. we discuss the implications that a differenthot-gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally-producedgaseous material, considering in particular how the l_x,gas deficiency of fastrotators would make them more capable to recycle the stellar-mass loss materialinto new stars than slow rotators. this is consistent with the finding thatmolecular gas and young stars are detected only in fast rotators in the atlas3dsample, and that fast rotators tend to dustier than slow rotators.

1301.5319	the growth in size and mass of cluster galaxies since z=2	we study the formation and evolution of brightest cluster galaxies startingfrom a $z=2$ population of quiescent ellipticals and following them to $z=0$.to this end, we use a suite of nine high-resolution dark matter-onlysimulations of galaxy clusters in a $\lambda$cdm universe. we develop a schemein which simulation particles are weighted to generate realistic anddynamically stable stellar density profiles at $z=2$. our initial conditionsassign a stellar mass to every identified dark halo as expected from abundancematching; assuming there exists a one-to-one relation between the visibleproperties of galaxies and their host haloes. we set the sizes of the luminouscomponents according to the observed relations for $z\sim2$ massive quiescentgalaxies. we study the evolution of the mass-size relation, the fate ofsatellite galaxies and the mass aggregation of the cluster central. from $z=2$,these galaxies grow on average in size by a factor 5 to 10 of and in mass by 2to 3. the stellar mass growth rate of the simulated bcgs in our sample is of1.9 in the range $0.3&lt;z&lt;1.0$ consistent with observations, and of 1.5 in therange $0.0&lt;z&lt;0.3$. furthermore the satellite galaxies evolve to the present daymass-size relation by $z=0$. assuming passively evolving stellar populations,we present surface brightness profiles for our cluster centrals which resemblethose observed for the cds in similar mass clusters both at $z=0$ and at $z=1$.this demonstrates that the $\lambda$cdm cosmology does indeed predict minor andmajor mergers to occur in galaxy clusters with the frequency and mass ratiodistribution required to explain the observed growth in size of passivegalaxies since $z=2$. our experiment shows that brightest cluster galaxies canform through dissipationless mergers of quiescent massive $z=2$ galaxies,without substantial additional star formation.

1304.1559	towards a more realistic population of bright spiral galaxies in  cosmological simulations	we present an update to the multiphase sph galaxy formation code byscannapieco et al. we include a more elaborate treatment of the production ofmetals, cooling rates based on individual element abundances, and a scheme forthe turbulent diffusion of metals. our sn feedback model now transfers energyto the ism in kinetic and thermal form, and we include a prescription for theeffects of radiation pressure from massive young stars on the ism. we calibrateour new code on the well studied aquarius haloes and then use it to simulate asample of 16 galaxies with halo masses between 1x10^11 and 3x10^12 m_sun. ingeneral, the stellar masses of the sample agree well with the stellar mass tohalo mass relation inferred from abundance matching techniques for redshiftsz=0-4. there is however a tendency to overproduce stars at z&gt;4 and tounderproduce them at z&lt;0.5 in the least massive haloes. overly high sfrs at z&lt;1for the most massive haloes are likely connected to the lack of agn feedback inour model. the simulated sample also shows reasonable agreement with observedstar formation rates, sizes, gas fractions and gas-phase metallicities atz=0-3. remaining discrepancies can be connected to deviations from predictionsfor star formation histories from abundance matching. at z=0, the modelgalaxies show realistic morphologies, stellar surface density profiles,circular velocity curves and stellar metallicities, but overly flat metallicitygradients. 15 out of 16 of our galaxies contain disk components with kinematicdisk fraction ranging between 15 and 65 %. the disk fraction depends on thetime of the last destructive merger or misaligned infall event. considering theremaining shortcomings of our simulations we conclude that even higherkinematic disk fractions may be possible for lambdacdm haloes with quiet mergerhistories, such as the aquarius haloes.

1304.1667	spinning dark matter halos promote bar formation	stellar bars are the most common non-axisymmetric structures in galaxies andtheir impact on the evolution of disc galaxies at all cosmological times can besignificant. classical theory predicts that stellar discs are stabilizedagainst bar formation if embedded in massive spheroidal dark matter halos.however, dark matter halos have been shown to facilitate the growth of barsthrough resonant gravitational interaction. still, it remains unclear why somegalaxies are barred and some are not. in this study, we demonstrate thatco-rotating (i.e., in the same sense as the disc rotating) dark matter haloswith spin parameters in the range of $0 \le \lambda_{\mathrm{dm}} \le 0.07$ -which are a definite prediction of modern cosmological models - promote theformation of bars and boxy bulges and therefore can play an important role inthe formation of pseudobulges in a kinematically hot dark matter dominated discgalaxies. we find continuous trends for models with higher halo spins: barsform more rapidly, the forming slow bars are stronger, and the final bars arelonger. after 2 gyrs of evolution, the amplitude of the bar mode in a modelwith $\lambda_{\mathrm{dm}} = 0.05$ is a factor of ~6 times higher, a_2/a_0 =0.23, than in the non-rotating halo model. after 5 gyrs, the bar is ~ 2.5 timeslonger. the origin of this trend is that more rapidly spinning (co-rotating)halos provide a larger fraction of trailing dark matter particles that lagbehind the disc bar and help growing the bar by taking away its angularmomentum by resonant interactions. a counter-rotating halo suppresses theformation of a bar in our models. we discuss potential consequences for forminggalaxies at high-redshift and present day low mass galaxies which haveconverted only a small fraction of their baryons into stars.

1308.3719	consequences of mechanical and radiative feedback from black holes in  disc galaxy mergers	we study the effect of agn mechanical and radiation feedback on the formationof bulge dominated galaxies via mergers of disc galaxies. the merging galaxieshave mass-ratios of 1:1 to 6:1 and include pre-existing hot gaseous halos toproperly account for the global impact of agn feedback. using smoothed particlehydrodynamics simulation code (gadget-3) we compare three models with differentagn feedback models: (1) no black hole and no agn feedback; (2) thermal agnfeedback; and (3) mechanical and radiative agn feedback. the last model ismotivated by observations of broad line quasars which show winds with initialvelocities of $v_w \ge$ 10,000 km/s and also heating associated with thecentral agn x-ray radiation. the primary changes in gas properties due tomechanical agn feedback are lower thermal x-ray luminosity from the finalgalaxy - in better agreement with observations - and galactic outflows withhigher velocity $\sim 1000$ km/s similar to recent direct observations ofnearby merger remnants. the kinetic energy of the outflowing gas is a factor of$\sim$ 20 higher than in the thermal feedback case. all merger remnants withmomentum-based agn feedback with $v_w \sim 10,000$ km/s and $\epsilon_w=2\times 10^{-3}$, independent of their progenitor mass-ratios, reproduce theobserved relations between stellar velocity dispersion and black hole mass($m_{\rm bh} - \sigma$) as well as x-ray luminosity ($l_x - \sigma$) with$10^{37.5}$ erg/s $\lesssim l_x (0.3-8~{\rm kev}) \lesssim 10^{39.2}$ erg/s forvelocity dispersions in the range of 120 km/s $\lesssim \sigma \lesssim$ 190km/s. in addition, the mechanical feedback produces a much greater agnvariability. we also show that gas is more rapidly and impulsively strippedfrom the galactic centres driving a moderate increase in galaxy size anddecrease in central density with the mechanical agn feedback model.

1309.2946	the effect of metal enrichment and galactic winds on galaxy formation in  cosmological zoom simulations	we investigate the differential effects of metal cooling and galactic stellarwinds on the cosmological formation of individual galaxies with three sets ofcosmological, hydrodynamical zoom simulations of 45 halos in the mass range10^11&lt;m_halo&lt;10^13m_sun. models including both galactic winds and metal cooling(i) suppress early star formation at z&gt;1 and predict reasonable star formationhistories, (ii) produce galaxies with high cold gas fractions (30-60 per cent)at high redshift, (iii) significantly reduce the galaxy formation efficienciesfor halos (m_halo&lt;10^12m_sun) at all redshifts in agreement with observationaland abundance matching constraints, (iv) result in high-redshift galaxies withreduced circular velocities matching the observed tully-fisher relation at z~2,and (v) significantly increase the sizes of low-mass galaxies(m_stellar&lt;3x10^10m_sun) at high redshift resulting in a weak size evolution -a trend in agreement with observations. however, the low redshift (z&lt;0.5) starformation rates of massive galaxies are higher than observed (up to ten times).no tested model predicts the observed size evolution for low-mass and high-massgalaxies simultaneously. due to the delayed onset of star formation in the windmodels, the metal enrichment of gas and stars is delayed and agrees well withobservational constraints. metal cooling and stellar winds are both found toincrease the ratio of in situ formed to accreted stars - the relativeimportance of dissipative vs. dissipationless assembly. for halo masses below~10^12m_sun, this is mainly caused by less stellar accretion and compares wellto predictions from semi-analytical models but still differs from abundancematching models. for higher masses, the fraction of in situ stars isover-predicted due to the unrealistically high star formation rates at lowredshifts.

1310.3273	cosmic rays can drive strong outflows from gas-rich high-redshift disk  galaxies	we present simulations of the magnetized interstellar medium (ism) in modelsof massive star forming (40 msun / yr) disk galaxies with high gas surfacedensities (~100 msun / pc^2) similar to observed star forming high-redshiftdisks. we assume that type ii supernovae deposit 10 per cent of their energyinto the ism as cosmic rays and neglect the additional deposition of thermalenergy or momentum. with a typical galactic diffusion coefficient for crs (3e28cm^2 / s) we demonstrate that this process alone can trigger the localformation of a strong low density galactic wind maintaining vertically openfield lines. driven by the additional pressure gradient of the relativisticfluid the wind speed can exceed 1000 km/s, much higher than the escape velocityof the galaxy. the global mass loading, i.e. the ratio of the gas mass leavingthe galactic disk in a wind to the star formation rate becomes of order unityonce the system has settled into an equilibrium. we conclude that relativisticparticles accelerated in supernova remnants alone provide a natural andefficient mechanism to trigger winds similar to observed mass-loaded galacticwinds in high-redshift galaxies. these winds also help explaining the lowefficiencies for the conversion of gas into stars in galaxies as well as theearly enrichment of the intergalactic medium with metals. this mechanism can beat least of similar importance than the traditionally considered momentumfeedback from massive stars and thermal and kinetic feedback from supernovaexplosions.

0802.0210	equal- and unequal-mass mergers of disk and elliptical galaxies with  black holes	we present binary galaxy merger simulations with varying mass ratios anddifferent progenitor morphologies. the simulations include mergers of gas-richdisks (sp-sp), of early-type galaxies and disks (e-sp, mixed mergers), andmergers of early-type galaxies (e-e, dry mergers). we follow the dynamics ofgas, stars and dark matter, and include radiative cooling, star formation andblack hole (bh) accretion. for sp-sp mergers, the peak star formation rate andbh accretion rate decrease and the growth timescales of the central black holesand newly formed stars increase with higher progenitor mass ratios. the peak bhaccretion rate typically occurs shortly after the time of bh merging for lowprogenitor mass ratios (e.g. 3:1 and lower), whereas for higher progenitor massratios there is no clear correlation between the peak bh accretion rate and bhmerging time. the termination of star formation by bh feedback in disk mergersis significantly less important for higher progenitor mass ratios (e.g. 3:1 andhigher). in addition, the inclusion of bh feedback suppresses efficiently starformation in dry e-e mergers and mixed e-sp mergers. all merger remnants,independent of their progenitors, follow the observed relations between thecentral bh mass and the stellar velocity dispersion m_bh-sigma, the bulge massm_bh-m_* and the bulge binding energy m_bh-m_{*}sigma^2, with the dominantsource of scatter arising from variations in the initial gas mass fraction. thenormalizations for all relations and the simulated slope of the m_bh-sigma andm_bh-m_{*}sigma^2 relations are in good agreement with the observations,whereas the simulated slope of the m_bh-m_* relation is slightly steepercompared to the observations.

1311.6469	ngc1266 as a local candidate for rapid cessation of star formation	we present new spectrographic areal unit for research on optical nebulae(sauron) integral-field spectroscopy and swift ultraviolet optical telescope(uvot) observations of molecular outflow host galaxy ngc 1266 that indicate ngc1266 has experienced a rapid cessation of star formation. both the sauron mapsof stellar population age and the swift uvot observations demonstrate thepresence of young ($&lt; 1$ gyr) stellar populations within the central 1 kpc,while existing combined array for research in millimeter-wave astronomy (carma)co(1--0) maps indicate that the sites of current star formation are constrainedto the inner few hundred parsecs of the galaxy only. the optical spectrum ofngc 1266 from moustakas &amp; kennicutt (2006) reveal a characteristicpost-starburst (k+a) stellar population and davis et al. (2012) confirm thationized gas emission in the system originate from a shock. galaxies with k+aspectra and shock-like ionized gas line ratios may comprise an important,overlooked segment of the post-starburst population, containing exactly thoseobjects in which the agn is actively expelling the star-forming material. whileagn activity is not the likely driver of the post-starburst event that occurred500 myr ago, the faint spiral structure seen in the hubble space telescope(hst) wide-field camera 3 (wfc3) y-, j- and h-band imaging seems to point tothe possibility of gravitational torques being the culprit. if the moleculargas were driven into the center at the same time as the larger scale galaxydisk underwent quenching, the agn might be able to sustain the presence ofmolecular gas for $\gtrsim 1$ gyr by cyclically injecting turbulent kineticenergy into the dense molecular gas via a radio jet, inhibiting star formation.

1402.1788	sphgal: smoothed particle hydrodynamics with improved accuracy for  galaxy simulations	we present the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics implementation sphgal, whichcombines some recently proposed improvements in gadget. this includes apressure-entropy formulation with a wendland kernel, a higher order estimate ofvelocity gradients, a modified artificial viscosity switch with a modifiedstrong limiter, and artificial conduction of thermal energy. with a series ofidealized hydrodynamic tests we show that the pressure-entropy formulation isideal for resolving fluid mixing at contact discontinuities but performsconspicuously worse at strong shocks due to the large entropy discontinuities.including artificial conduction at shocks greatly improves the results. insimulations of milky way like disk galaxies a feedback-induced instabilitydevelops if too much artificial viscosity is introduced. our modifiedartificial viscosity scheme prevents this instability and shows efficient shockcapturing capability. we also investigate the star formation rate and thegalactic outflow. the star formation rates vary slightly for different sphschemes while the mass loading is sensitive to the sph scheme and significantlyreduced in our favored implementation. we compare the accretion behavior of thehot halo gas. the formation of cold blobs, an artifact of simple sphimplementations, can be eliminated efficiently with proper fluid mixing, eitherby conduction and/or by using a pressure-entropy formulation.

1403.1257	the impact of mechanical agn feedback on the formation of massive  early-type galaxies	we employ cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the effectsof agn feedback on the formation of massive galaxies with present-day stellarmasses of $m_{stel} = 8.8 \times 10^{10} - 6.0 \times 10^{11} m_{sun}$. usingsmoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations with a pressure-entropy formulationthat allows an improved treatment of contact discontinuities and fluid mixing,we run three sets of simulations of 20 halos with different agn feedbackmodels: (1) no feedback, (2) thermal feedback, and (3) mechanical and radiationfeedback. we assume that seed black holes are present at early cosmic epochs atthe centre of emerging dark matter halos and trace their mass growth via gasaccretion and mergers with other black holes. both feedback models successfullyrecover the observed m_bh - sigma relation and black hole-to-stellar mass ratiofor simulated central early-type galaxies. the baryonic conversion efficienciesare reduced by a factor of two compared to models without any agn feedback atall halo masses. however, massive galaxies simulated with thermal agn feedbackshow a factor of ~10-100 higher x-ray luminosities than observed. themechanical/radiation feedback model reproduces the observed correlation betweenx-ray luminosities and velocity dispersion, e.g. for galaxies with sigma = 200km/s, the x-ray luminosity is reduced from $10^{42}$ erg/s to $10^{40}$ erg/s.it also efficiently suppresses late time star formation, reducing the specificstar formation rate from $10^{-10.5}$ $yr^{-1}$ to $10^{-14}$ $yr^{-1}$ onaverage and resulting in quiescent galaxies since z=2, whereas the thermalfeedback model shows higher late time in-situ star formation rates thanobserved.

1403.4850	the atlas3d project - xxviii. dynamically-driven star formation  suppression in early-type galaxies	we present measurements of the star formation rate (sfr) in the early-typegalaxies (etgs) of the atlas3d sample, based on wide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) 22um and galaxy evolution explorer (galex) far-ultravioletemission. we combine these with gas masses estimated from 12co and hi data inorder to investigate the star formation efficiency (sfe) in a larger sample ofetgs than previously available. we first recalibrate (based on wise data) therelation between old stellar populations (traced at ks-band) and 22umluminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22um emission fromcircumstellar dust. we then go on to investigate the position of etgs on thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation. molecular gas-rich etgs have comparable starformation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they liesystematically offset from the ks relation, having lower star formationefficiencies by a factor of ~2.5 (in agreement with other authors). this effectis driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material isin the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. we show here forthe first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass perunit time is lower in etgs, it seems that the amount of stars formed perfree-fall time is approximately constant. the scatter around this dynamicalrelation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of thepotential in the inner regions. this leads us to suggest that dynamicalproperties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be importantsecond parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatteraround star-formation relations.

1403.6124	why stellar feedback promotes disc formation in simulated galaxies	we study how feedback influences baryon infall onto galaxies usingcosmological, zoom-in simulations of haloes with present mass$m_{vir}=6.9\times10^{11} m_{\odot}$ to $1.7\times10^{12} m_{\odot}$. startingat z=4 from identical initial conditions, implementations of weak and strongstellar feedback produce bulge- and disc-dominated galaxies, respectively.strong feedback favours disc formation: (1) because conversion of gas intostars is suppressed at early times, as required by abundance matchingarguments, resulting in flat star formation histories and higher gas fractions;(2) because 50% of the stars form in situ from recycled disc gas with angularmomentum only weakly related to that of the z=0 dark halo; (3) becauselate-time gas accretion is typically an order of magnitude stronger and hashigher specific angular momentum, with recycled gas dominating over primordialinfall; (4) because 25-30% of the total accreted gas is ejected entirely beforez~1, removing primarily low angular momentum material which enriches the nearbyinter-galactic medium. most recycled gas roughly conserves its angularmomentum, but material ejected for long times and to large radii can gainsignificant angular momentum before re-accretion. these processes lower galaxyformation efficiency in addition to promoting disc formation.

1404.6926	the diverse formation histories of simulated disc galaxies	we analyze the formation histories of 19 galaxies from cosmological smoothedparticle hydrodynamics zoom-in resimulations. we construct mock three-colourimages and show that the models reproduce observed trends in the evolution ofgalaxy colours and morphologies. however, only a small fraction of galaxiescontains bars. many galaxies go through phases of central mass growth byin-situ star formation driven by gas-rich mergers or misaligned gas infall.these events lead to accretion of low-angular momentum gas to the centres andleave imprints on the distributions of z=0 stellar circularities, radii andmetallicities as functions of age. observations of the evolution of structuralproperties of samples of disc galaxies at z=2.5-0.0 infer continuous massassembly at all radii. our simulations can only explain this if there is asignificant contribution from mergers or misaligned infall, as expected in alambdacdm universe. quiescent merger histories lead to high kinematic discfractions and inside-out growth, but show little central growth after the last`destructive' merger at z&gt;1.5. for sufficiently strong feedback, as assumed inour models, a moderate amount of merging does not seem to be a problem for thez=0 disc galaxy population, but may rather be a requirement. the averageprofiles of simulated disc galaxies agree with observations at z&gt;=1.5. at z&lt;=1,there is too much growth in size and too little growth in central mass,possibly due to the under-abundance of bars. the discrepancies may partly becaused by differences between the star formation histories of the simulationsand those assumed for observations.

1406.4861	anisotropic transport and early dynamical impact of cosmic rays around  supernova remnants	we present a novel implementation of cosmic rays (cr) in themagneto-hydrodynamic code flash. crs are described as separate fluids withdifferent energies. cr advection, energy dependent anisotropic diffusion withrespect to the magnetic field and adiabatic losses to follow the evolution ofspectra are taken into account. we present a first study of the transport andimmediate (~150 kyr) dynamical impact of crs on the turbulent magnetisedinterstellar medium around supernova remnants on scales up to 80 pc. crdiffusion quickly leads to an efficient acceleration of low-density gas (mainlyperpendicular to the magnetic field) with accelerations up to two orders ofmagnitude above the thermal values. peaked (at 1 gev) cr injection spectra havea stronger impact on the dynamics than power-law spectra. for realisticmagnetic field configurations low energy crs (with smaller diffusioncoefficients) distribute anisotropically with large spatial variations of afactor of ten and more. adiabatic losses can change the local spectraperceptibly but do not have an integral effect on the dynamics at the spatialand temporal scales considered here. we discuss the potential global impact ofcrs and anisotropic transport on the dynamical structure of the ism and alsodetail the limitations of the model.

1406.6696	stellar orbits in cosmological galaxy simulations: the connection to  formation history and line-of-sight kinematics	we analyze orbits of stars and dark matter out to three effective radii for42 galaxies formed in cosmological zoom simulations. box orbits always dominateat the centers and $z$-tubes become important at larger radii. we connect theorbital structure to the formation histories and specific features (e.g. disk,counter-rotating core, minor axis rotation) in two-dimensional kinematic maps.globally, fast rotating galaxies with significant recent in situ star formationare dominated by $z$-tubes. slow rotators with recent mergers have significantbox orbit and $x$-tube components. rotation, quantified by the$\lambda_r$-parameter often originates from streaming motion of stars on$z$-tubes but sometimes from figure rotation. the observed anti-correlation of$h_3$ and $v_0 / \sigma$ in rotating galaxies can be connected to a dissipativeformation history leading to high $z$-tube fractions. for galaxies with recentmergers in situ formed stars, accreted stars and dark matter particles populatesimilar orbits. dark matter particles have isotropic velocity dispersions.accreted stars are typically radially biased ($\beta \approx 0.2 - 0.4$). insitu stars become tangentially biased (as low as $\beta \approx -1.0$) ifdissipation was relevant during the late assembly of the galaxy. we discuss therelevance of our analysis for integral field surveys and for constraininggalaxy formation models.

1408.1099	the atlas3d project - xxiv. the intrinsic shape distribution of  early-type galaxies	we use the atlas3d sample to perform a study of the intrinsic shapes ofearly-type galaxies, taking advantage of the available combined photometric andkinematic data. based on our ellipticity measurements from the sloan digitalsky survey data release 7, and additional imaging from the isaac newtontelescope, we first invert the shape distribution of fast and slow rotatorsunder the assumption of axisymmetry. the so-obtained intrinsic shapedistribution for the fast rotators can be described with a gaussian with a meanflattening of q=0.25 and standard deviation sigma_q = 0.14, and an additionaltail towards rounder shapes. the slow rotators are much rounder, and are welldescribed with a gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and sigma_q =0.09. we then checkedthat our results were consistent when applying a different and independentmethod to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observedellipticity distributions directly using gaussian parametrisations for theintrinsic axis ratios. although both fast and slow rotators are identified asearly-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shapestudies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions aresignificantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios. theintrinsic shape distribution of the fast rotators shows similarities with thespiral galaxy population. including the observed kinematic misalignment in ourintrinsic shape study shows that the fast rotators are predominantlyaxisymmetric, with only very little room for triaxiality. for the slow rotatorsthough there are very strong indications that they are (mildly) triaxial.

1506.07180	supernova feedback and the hot gas filling fraction of the interstellar  medium	supernovae (sn), the most energetic stellar feedback mechanism, are crucialfor regulating the interstellar medium (ism) and launching galactic winds. weexplore how supernova remnants (snrs) create a multiphase medium by performing3d hydrodynamical simulations at various sn rates, $s$, and ism averagedensities, $\bar{n}$. the evolution of a snr in a self-consistently generatedthree-phase ism is qualitatively different from that in a uniform or atwo-phase warm/cold medium. by travelling faster and further in the low-densityhot phase, the domain of a snr increases by $&gt;10^{2.5}$. varying $\bar{n}$ and$s$, we find that a steady state can only be achieved when the hot gas volumefraction $f_{\rm{v,hot}}\lesssim 0.6 \pm 0.1 $. above that level, overlappingsnrs render connecting topology of the hot gas, and the ism is subjected tothermal runaway. photoelectric heating (peh) has a surprisingly strong impacton $f_{\rm{v,hot}}$. for $\bar{n}\gtrsim 3 \cm-3 $, a reasonable peh rate isable to suppress the thermal runaway. overall, we determine the critical snrate for the onset of thermal runaway to be $s_{\rm{crit}} = 200(\bar{n}/1\cm-3)^k (e_{\rm{sn}}/10^{51}\erg)^{-1} \kpc^{-3} \myr-1$, where $k =(1.2,2.7)$ for $\bar{n} \leq 1$ and $&gt; 1\cm-3 $, respectively. we present afitting formula of the ism pressure $p(\bar{n}$, $s$), which can be used as aneffective equation of state in cosmological simulations. despite the 5 ordersof magnitude span of $(\bar{n},s)$, the average mach number varies little:$\mathcal{m} \approx \ 0.5\pm 0.2, \ 1.2\pm 0.3,\ 2.3\pm 0.9$ for the hot, warmand cold phases, respectively.

1510.06563	impact of supernova and cosmic-ray driving on the surface brightness of  the galactic halo in soft x-rays	the halo of the milky way contains a hot plasma with a surface brightness insoft x-rays of the order $10^{-12}$erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ deg$^{-2}$. theorigin of this gas is unclear, but so far numerical models of galactic starformation have failed to reproduce such a large surface brightness by severalorders of magnitude. in this paper, we analyze simulations of the turbulent,magnetized, multi-phase interstellar medium including thermal feedback bysupernova explosions as well as cosmic-ray feedback. we include atime-dependent chemical network, self-shielding by gas and dust, andself-gravity. pure thermal feedback alone is sufficient to produce the observedsurface brightness, although it is very sensitive to the supernova rate. cosmicrays suppress this sensitivity and reduce the surface brightness because theydrive cooler outflows. self-gravity has by far the largest effect because itaccumulates the diffuse gas in the disk in dense clumps and filaments, so thatsupernovae exploding in voids can eject a large amount of hot gas into thehalo. this can boost the surface brightness by several orders of magnitude.although our simulations do not reach a steady state, all simulations producesurface brightness values of the same order of magnitude as the observations,with the exact value depending sensitively on the simulation parameters. weconclude that star formation feedback alone is sufficient to explain the originof the hot halo gas, but measurements of the surface brightness alone do notprovide useful diagnostics for the study of galactic star formation.

astro-ph;0102246	gas dynamics and disk formation in 3:1 mergers	we performed n-body/sph simulations of merging gas rich disk-galaxies with amass ratio of 3:1. a stellar disk and bulge component and a dark halo isrealized with collisionless particles, the gas is simulated using sphparticles. in this paper we focus on the gas dynamics in mergers and itsinfluence on the structure of the final merger remnant, neglecting starformation. during the merger around $8\times 10^9 m_{\odot}$ of gas accumulatein the central region of the merger remnant (inside 300 pc). part of the gasfalls to the center, channeled by a tidally induced bar in the more massivegalaxy. a peak accretion rate of 150 solar masses/year is reached when the twogalaxy centers merge. it is likely that the gas will experience a centralstarburst and/or fuel a central black hole. the gas in the outer regionsaccumulates in dense knots within tidal tails which could lead to the formationof open clusters or dwarf satellites. later on, the gas knots loose angularmomentum by dynamical friction and also sink to the center of the remnant,thereby increasing the central gas content. in the end, the gas settles in acentral power-law disk with surface density $\sigma \propto r^{-2}$ surroundedby dense, orbiting gas clumps. the stellar profile is of de vaucouleurs-type,like in simulations of pure stellar mergers

astro-ph;0103476	the formation of disks in elliptical galaxies	we investigate detailed kinematical properties of simulated collisionlessmerger remnants of disk galaxies with mass ratios of 1:1 and 3:1. thesimulations were performed by direct summation using the new special hardwaredevice grape-5. in agreement with observations, the shape of the line-of-sightvelocity distribution (losvd) is gaussian with small deviations. for most caseswe find that the retrograde wings of the losvd are steeper than the progradeones. this is in contradiction with observations which show broad retrogradeand steep prograde wings. this serious problem in the collisionless formationscenario of massive elliptical galaxies can be solved if all rotatingellipticals, even boxy ones, contain an additional stellar disk component with$\propto 15%$ of the total stellar mass and a scale length of order theeffective radius of the spheroid. we propose that the progenitor galaxies ofmassive ellipticals must have contained a significant amount of gas that didnot condense into stars during the merger process itself but formed an extendedgaseous disk before the star formation epoch. the heating source that preventedthe gas from forming stars early and the origin of the large specific angularmomentum required for the gas component to form an extended disk are stillunsolved problems.

astro-ph;0110179	statistical properties of collisionless equal- and unequal-mass merger  remnants of disk galaxies	we perform a large parameter survey of 112 collisionless n-body simulationsof binary mergers of disk-galaxies with mass ratios of 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1using the special purpose hardware grape. the basic properties of the remnantscorrelate with the mass ratio of the progenitor disks. we find that about 80%of the equal-mass merger simulations lead to slowly rotating remnants withsignificant minor-axis rotation. one half of all projected 1:1 remnants showsboxy and the other half shows disky isophotes. remnants with mass ratios of 3:1and 4:1 all rotate fast and show a small amount of minor-axis rotation. about90% of the projected 3:1 and 4:1 remnants show disky isophotes. 2:1 remnantsshow intermediate properties. projection effects lead to a large spread in thedata in good agreement with observations. they do not change the fundamentalkinematical differences between equal-mass and unequal-mass merger remnants.the results of this study weaken the disk merger scenario as the possibleformation mechanism of massive boxy giant ellipticals. in general, theproperties of equal-mass (and 2:1) merger remnants are consistent with theobserved population of giant ellipticals in the intermediate mass regimebetween low mass fast rotating disky and bright massive boxy giant ellipticals.3:1 and 4:1 merger remnants, however, are in very good agreement with the classof low luminosity, fast rotating giant elliptical galaxies. binary mergers ofdisk galaxies are therefore still very good candidates for being the mainformation mechanism for intermediate and low mass giant ellipticals. thehomogeneous class of massive boxy ellipticals most likely formed by a differentprocess.

astro-ph;0110374	gas dynamics and inflow in gas-rich galaxy mergers	we performed n-body/sph simulations of merging gas-rich disk galaxies withmass ratios of 1:1 and 3:1. a stellar disk and bulge component and a dark halowas realized with collisionless particles, the gas was represented by sphparticles. since we did not include star formation we focused on the gasdynamics and its influence on the structure of merger remnants. we find thatequal-mass mergers are in general more effective in driving gas to the center.around 50% of the gas resides in the central regions after the merger iscomplete. the gas in unequal-mass mergers keeps a large amount of its initialangular momentum and settles in a large scale disk while only 20% -30% of thegas is driven to the center. this general result is almost independent of themerger geometry. the gas in the outer regions accumulates in dense knots withintidal tails which could lead to the formation of open clusters or dwarfsatellites. later on, the gas knots loose angular momentum by dynamicalfriction and successively sink to the center of the remnant thereby increasingthe total gas content of the disk. due to the influence of the gas thesimulated merger remnant becomes more oblate than its pure stellar counterpart.the shape of the stellar losvd changes and the third-order gauss-hermitecoefficient $h_3$ is in good agreement with observations.

astro-ph;0310513	cosmological simulations of elliptical galaxy formation in lcdm and lwdm  cosmologies	we present the results of a series of gas dynamical cosmological simulationsof the formation of individual massive field galaxies in the standardconcordance \lcdm and in a \lwdm cosmology. the galaxies form in an initialburst of star formation followed by accretion of small satellites. thesimulated galaxies are old ($\approx$ 10 $gyrs$) hot stellar systems withmasses of $\approx 1.7 \times 10^{11} m_{\odot}$. baryonic matter dominates themass in the luminous part of the galaxies up to $\approx 5$ effective radii.the \lcdm galaxy is a slowly rotating spheroidal stellar system (e2) withpredominantly disky isophotes. the line-of-sight velocity distributions deviatefrom gaussian shape and $h_3$ is anticorrelated with $v_{los}$. thecorresponding \lwdm galaxy is more elongated (e3 - e4) and rotates faster. theanisotropy parameter $(v/\sigma)^*$ is close to unity. within the uncertaintiesof $m/l$ both galaxies follow the fundamental plane. we conclude that theproperties of the two galaxies simulated in the \lcdm and \lwdm cosmology arein good agreement with observations of intermediate mass elliptical or s0galaxies (abstract abbreviated).

astro-ph;0504595	the surprising anisotropy of fast rotating, disky elliptical galaxies	the projected kinematical properties of unequal-mass merger remnants of diskgalaxies are analysed and shown to agree well with observations of disky, fastrotating elliptical galaxies. this supports the major merger hypothesis ofearly-type galaxy formation. however, in contrast to previous claims, themerger remnants are very anisotropic with values of the anisotropy parameterthat are similar to equal-mass merger remnants that form boxy, slowly rotatingellipticals. including gas in the simulations does not change this resultalthough the line-of-sight velocity profile and the intrinsic orbital structureare strongly affected by the presenceof gas. the kinematical difference betweenboxy and disky ellipticals appears not to be the amount of anisotropy butrather rotation and the shape of the velocity dispersion tensor. the apparentisotropy of observed disky ellipticals is shown to result from inclinationeffects. even small inclination angles strongly reduce the measured anisotropyof fast rotating systems, seen in projection. a second problem is the limitedamount of information that is available when measuring only the centralvelocity dispersion and a characteristic rotation and ellipticity. methods areinvestigated that allow a better determination of the intrinsic anisotropy offast rotating early-type galaxies with known inclination angles.

astro-ph;0505594	a simple model for the evolution of disc galaxies: the milky way	a simple model for the evolution of disc galaxies is presented. we adoptthree numbers from observations of the milky way disc, the local surface massdensity, the stellar scale length (of the assumedly exponential disc) and theamplitude of the (assumedly flat) rotation curve, and physically, the (local)dynamical kennicutt star formation prescription, standard chemical evolutionequations assuming and a model for spectral evolution of stellar populations.we can determine the detailed evolution of the model with only the addition ofstandard cosmological scalings with time of the dimensional parameters. asurprising wealth of detailed specifications follows from this prescriptionincluding the gaseous infall rate as a function of radius and time, thedistribution of stellar ages and metallicities with time and radius, surfacebrightness profiles at different wavelengths, colours etc. at the solarneighbourhood stars start to form $\approx 10 gyrs$ ago at an increasing ratepeaking 4 billion years ago and then slowly declining in good agreement withobservations. the mean age of long lived stars at the solar neighbourhood isabout $4 gyrs$. the local surface density of the stars and gas are 35 and $15m_{\odot}pc^{-2}$, respectively. the metallicity distribution of the stars atthe solar radius is narrow with a peak at $[z/z_{\odot}] = -0.1$.both asalpeter imf and a chabrier imf are consistent with observations. comparisonswith the current and local fossil evidence provides support for the model whichcan then be used to assess other local disc galaxies, the evolution of discgalaxies in deep optical surveys and also for theoretical investigations suchas simulations of merging disc galaxies (abbreviated).

astro-ph;0506425	dry mergers in gems: the dynamical evolution of massive early-type  galaxies	we have used the 28'x 28' hst image mosaic from the gems (galaxy evolutionfrom morphology and seds) survey in conjunction with the combo-17 photometricredshift survey to constrain the incidence of major mergers betweenspheroid-dominated galaxies with little cold gas (dry mergers) since z = 0.7. aset of n-body merger simulations was used to explore the morphologicalsignatures of such interactions: they are recognizable either as &lt; 5kpcseparation close pairs or because of broad, low surface brightness tidalfeatures and asymmetries. data with the depth and resolution of gems aresensitive to dry mergers between galaxies with m_v &lt; -20.5 for z &lt; 0.7; drymergers at higher redshifts are not easily recovered in single-orbit hstimaging. six dry mergers (12 galaxies) with luminosity ratios between 1:1 and4:1 were found from a sample of 379 red early-type galaxies with m_v &lt; -20.5and 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.7. the simulations suggest that the morphological signatures ofdry merging are visible for ~250myr and we use this timescale to convert theobserved merger incidence into a rate. on this basis we find that present dayspheroidal galaxies with m_v &lt; -20.5 on average have undergone between 0.5 and2 major dry mergers since z ~ 0.7. we have compared this result with thepredictions of a cold dark matter based semi-analytic galaxy formation model.the model reproduces the observed declining major merger fraction of brightgalaxies and the space density of luminous early-type galaxies reasonably well.the predicted dry merger fraction is consistent with our observational result.hence, hierarchical models predict and observations now show that major drymergers are an important driver of the evolution of massive early-type galaxiesin recent epochs.

astro-ph;0509667	properties of early-type, dry galaxy mergers and the origin of massive  elliptical galaxies	the luminosity dependence of kinematical and isophotal properties ofelliptical galaxies is investigated using numerical simulations of galaxymerging, combined with semi-analytical models of hierarchical structureformation. mergers of spiral galaxies as the only formation mechanism forelliptical galaxies can neither reproduce the kinematical and photometricproperties of very massive elliptical galaxies nor the change from rotationallyflattened disky to anisotropic boxy systems with increasing luminosity. wepresent numerical simulations showing that binary mergers of early-typegalaxies open an additional channel for the formation of anisotropic, slowlyrotating and boxy ellipticals. including this channel in a semi-analyticalmodel we can successfully reproduce the observed trend that more luminous giantellipticals are more boxy and less flattened by rotation. this trend can bestrengthened by suppressing residual gas infall and star formation for galaxieswith stellar bulge masses $m_* \geq 3 \times 10^{10} m_{\odot}$. hence wepropose that mergers of early-type galaxies play an important role for theassembly of massive elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;0512235	formation of early-type galaxies from cosmological initial conditions	we describe high resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulationsof three approximately $m_*$ field galaxies starting from \lcdm initialconditions. the simulations are made intentionally simple, and includephotoionization, cooling of the intergalactic medium, and star formation butnot feedback from agn or supernovae. all of the galaxies undergo an initialburst of star formation at $z \approx 5$, accompanied by the formation of abubble of heated gas. two out of three galaxies show early-type properties atpresent whereas only one of them experienced a major merger. heating fromshocks and -pdv work dominates over cooling so that for most of the gas thetemperature is an increasing function of time. by $z \approx 1$ a significantfraction of the final stellar mass is in place and the spectral energydistribution resembles those of observed massive red galaxies. the galaxieshave grown from $z=1 \to 0$ on average by 25% in mass and in size by gas poor(dry) stellar mergers. by the present day, the simulated galaxies are old($\approx 10 {\rm gyrs}$), kinematically hot stellar systems surrounded by hotgaseous haloes. stars dominate the mass of the galaxies up to $\approx 4$effective radii ($\approx 10$ kpc). kinematic and most photometric propertiesare in good agreement with those of observed elliptical galaxies. the galaxywith a major merger develops a counter-rotating core. our simulations show thatrealistic intermediate mass giant elliptical galaxies with plausible formationhistories can be formed from \lcdm initial conditions even without requiringrecent major mergers or feedback from supernovae or agn.

astro-ph;0605155	the influence of gas on the structure of merger remnants	we present a large set of merger simulations of early-type disc galaxies withmass ratios of 1:1 and 3:1 and 10% of the total disc mass in gas. in contrastto the collisionless case equal-mass mergers with gas do not result in veryboxy remnants which is caused by the suppression of box orbits and the changeof the projected shape of minor-axis tube orbits in the more axisymmetricremnants. the isophotal shape of 3:1 remnants and the global kinematicproperties of 1:1 and 3:1 remnants are only weakly affected by the presence ofgas. 1:1 remnants are slowly rotating whereas 3:1 remnants are fast rotatingand discy. the shape of the stellar losvd is strongly influenced by gas. thelosvds of collisionless remnants have broad leading wings while their gaseouscounterparts show steep leading wings, more consistent with observations ofelliptical galaxies. we show that this change is also caused by the suppressedpopulating of box orbits and it is amplified by the formation of extended gasdiscs in the merger remnants. if elliptical galaxies have formed from mergersour results indicate that massive, slowly rotating boxy elliptical galaxies cannot have formed from dissipative mergers of discs. pure stellar (dry) mergersare the more likely candidates. on the other hand lower mass, fast rotating anddiscy ellipticals can have formed from dissipative (wet) mergers of early-typediscs. so far, only unequal-mass disc mergers with gas can successfully explaintheir observed substructure. this is consistent with the revised morphologicalclassification scheme of increasing importance of gas dissipation when movingfrom boxy ellipticals to discy ellipticals and then to spiral galaxies,proposed by kormendy &amp; bender (abbreviated).

astro-ph;0702535	are disk galaxies the progenitors of giant ellipticals?	a popular formation scenario for giant elliptical galaxies proposes that theymight have formed from binary mergers of disk galaxies. difficulties with thescenario that emerged from earlier studies included providing the necessarystellar mass and metallicity, maintaining the tight color-magnitude relationand avoiding phase space limits. in this paper we revisit the issue and putconstraints on the binary disc merger scenario based on the stellar populationsof disc galaxies. we draw the following conclusions: low redshift collisionlessor gaseous mergers of present day milky way like disc galaxies do not formpresent day elliptical galaxies. binary mergers of the progenitors of presentday milky way like disc galaxies can have evolved into intermediate masselliptical galaxies ($m &lt; m_*$) if they have merged earlier than $\approx$ 3-4gyrs ago. assuming that most present day disk galaxies formed in a similar wayto the milky way model presented here, more massive giant ellipticals ingeneral can not have formed from binary mergers of the progenitors of presentday disc galaxies. a major reason for these conclusions is that the mass inmetals of typical disk galaxy is approximately a factor of 4-8 smaller than themass in metals of a typical early-type galaxy and this ratio grows to largervalues with increasing redshift.

0810.0137	specific angular momentum of disc merger remnants and the  $\lambda_r$-parameter	we use two-dimensional kinematic maps of simulated binary disc mergers toinvestigate the $\lambda_r$-parameter, which is a luminosity weighted measureof projected angular momentum per unit mass. this parameter was introduced tosubdivide the sauron sample of early type galaxies in so called fast $\lambda_r&gt; 0.1$ and slow rotators $\lambda_r &lt; 0.1$. tests on merger remnants revealthat $\lambda_r$ is a robust indicator of the true angular momentum content inelliptical galaxies. we find the same range of $\lambda_r$ values in our mergerremnants as in the sauron galaxies. the merger mass ratio is decisive increating a slow or a fast rotator in a single binary merger, the former beingcreated mostly in an equal mass merger. slow rotators have a $\lambda_r$ whichdoes not vary with projection. the confusion rate with face-on fast rotators isvery small. merger with low gas fractions form slow rotators with smallerellipticities and are in much better agreement with the sauron slow rotators.remergers of merger remnants are slow rotators but tend to have too highellipticities. fast rotators maintain the angular momentum content from theprogenitor disc galaxy if merger mass ratio is high. some sauron galaxies havevalues of $\lambda_r$ as high as our progenitor disc galaxies.
