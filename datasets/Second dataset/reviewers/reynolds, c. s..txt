0902.2840	stellar-mass black hole spin constraints from disk reflection and  continuum modeling	accretion disk reflection spectra, including broad iron emission lines, bearthe imprints of the strong doppler shifts and gravitational red-shifts close toblack holes. the extremity of these shifts depends on the proximity of theinnermost stable circular orbit to the black hole, and that orbit is determinedby the black hole spin parameter. modeling relativistic spectral features,then, gives a means of estimating black hole spin. we report on the results offits made to archival x-ray spectra of stellar-mass black holes and black holecandidates, selected for strong disk reflection features. following recentwork, these spectra were fit with reflection models and disk continuum emissionmodels (where required) in which black hole spin is a free parameter. althoughour results must be regarded as preliminary, we find evidence for a broad rangeof black hole spin parameters in our sample. the black holes with the mostrelativistic radio jets are found to have high spin parameters, though jets areobserved in a black hole with a low spin parameter. for those sources withconstrained binary system parameters, we examine the distribution of spinparameters versus black hole mass, binary mass ratio, and orbital period. wediscuss the results within the context of black hole creation events,relativistic jet production, and efforts to probe the innermost relativisticregime around black holes.

0905.4383	the detection of broad iron k and l line emission in the narrow-line  seyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707-495 using xmm-newton	since the discovery of the first broad iron-k line in 1995 from the seyfertgalaxy mcg--6-30-15, broad iron-k lines have been found in several otherseyfert galaxies, from accreting stellar mass black holes and even fromaccreting neutron stars. the iron-k line is prominent in the reflectionspectrum created by the hard x-ray continuum irradiating dense accretingmatter. relativistic distortion of the line makes it sensitive to the stronggravity and spin of the black hole. the accompanying iron-l line emissionshould be detectable when the iron abundance is high. here we report the firstdiscovery of both iron-k and l emission, using xmm-newton observations of thenarrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707-495. the bright fe-l emission has enabledus, for the first time, to detect a reverberation lag of 30 s between thedirect x-ray continuum and its reflection from matter falling into the hole.the observed reverberation timescale is comparable to the light-crossing timeof the innermost radii around a supermassive black hole. the combination ofspectral and timing data on 1h0707-495 provides strong evidence that we arewitnessing emission from matter within a gravitational radius, or a fraction ofa light-minute, from the event horizon of a rapidly-spinning, massive blackhole.

0908.0013	constraining the spin of the black hole in fairall 9 with suzaku	we report on the results of spectral fits made to data obtained from a 168ksec suzaku observation of the seyfert-1 galaxy fairall 9. the source isclearly detected out to 30 kev. the observed spectrum is fairly simple; it iswell-described by a power-law with a soft excess and disk reflection. a broadiron line is detected, and easily separated from distinct narrow componentsowing to the resolution of the ccds in the x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis).the broad line is revealed to be asymmetric, consistent with a disk origin. wefit the xis and hard x-ray detector (hxd) spectra with relativistically-blurreddisk reflection models. with the assumption that the inner disk extends to theinnermost stable circular orbit, the best-fit model implies a black hole spinparameter of a = 0.60(7) and excludes extremal values at a high level ofconfidence. we discuss this result in the context of seyfert observations andmodels of the cosmic distribution of black hole spin.

1009.1154	multi-state observations of the galactic black hole xte j1752-223:  evidence for an intermediate black hole spin	the galactic black hole candidate xte j1752-223 was observed during the decayof its 2009 outburst with the suzaku and xmm-newton observatories. the observedspectra are consistent with the source being in the ''intermediate`` and''low-hard state`` respectively. the presence of a strong, relativistic ironemission line is clearly detected in both observations and the line profilesare found to be remarkably consistent and robust to a variety of continuummodels. this strongly points to the compact object in \j\ being a stellar-massblack hole accretor and not a neutron star. physically-motivated andself-consistent reflection models for the fe-\ka\ emission-line profile anddisk reflection spectrum rule out either a non-rotating, schwarzchild blackhole or a maximally rotating, kerr black hole at greater than 3sigma level ofconfidence. using a fully relativistic line function in which the black holespin parameter is a variable, we have formally constrained the spin parameterto be $0.52\pm0.11 (1\sigma)$. furthermore, we show that the source in thelow--hard state still requires an optically--thick disk component having aluminosity which is consistent with the $l\propto t^4$ relation expected for athin disk extending down to the inner--most stable circular orbit. our resultis in contrast to the prevailing paradigm that the disk is truncated in thelow-hard state.

1102.1500	the angular momenta of neutron stars and black holes as a window on  supernovae	it is now clear that a subset of supernovae display evidence for jets and areobserved as gamma-ray bursts. the angular momentum distribution of massivestellar endpoints provides a rare means of constraining the nature of thecentral engine in core-collapse explosions. unlike supermassive black holes,the spin of stellar-mass black holes in x-ray binary systems is little affectedby accretion, and accurately reflects the spin set at birth. a modest number ofstellar-mass black hole angular momenta have now been measured using twoindependent x-ray spectroscopic techniques. in contrast, rotation-poweredpulsars spin-down over time, via magnetic braking, but a modest number of natalspin periods have now been estimated. for both canonical and extreme neutronstar parameters, statistical tests strongly suggest that the angular momentumdistributions of black holes and neutron stars are markedly different. withinthe context of prevalent models for core-collapse supernovae, the angularmomentum distributions are consistent with black holes typically being producedin grb-like supernovae with jets, and with neutron stars typically beingproduced in supernovae with too little angular momentum to produce jets viamagnetohydrodynamic processes. it is possible that neutron stars are imbuedwith high spin initially, and rapidly spun-down shortly after the supernovaevent, but the available mechanisms may be inconsistent with some observedpulsar properties.

1105.0893	xmm follow-up observations of three swift bat-selected active galactic  nuclei	we present xmm-newton observations of three agn taken as part of a hunt tofind very heavily obscured compton-thick agn. for obscuring columns greaterthan 10^25 cm^-2, agn are only visible at energies below 10 kev viareflected/scattered radiation, characterized by a flat power-law. we thereforeselected three objects (eso 417-g006, iras 05218-1212, and mcg -01-05-047) fromthe swift bat hard x-ray survey catalog with swift x-ray telescope xrt 0.5-10kev spectra with flat power-law indices as candidate compton-thick sources forfollow-up observations with the more sensitive instruments on xmm-newton. thexmm spectra, however, rule out reflection-dominated models based on theweakness of the observed fe k-alpha lines. instead, the spectra are well-fit bya model of a power-law continuum obscured by a compton-thin absorber, plus asoft excess. this result is consistent with previous follow-up observations oftwo other flat-spectrum bat-detected agn. thus, out of the six agn in the22-month bat catalog with apparently flat swift xrt spectra, all five that havehad follow-up observations are not likely compton-thick. we also present newoptical spectra of two of these objects, iras 05218-1212 and mcg -01-05-047.interestingly, though both these agn have similar x-ray spectra, their opticalspectra are completely different, adding evidence against the simplest form ofthe geometric unified model of agn. iras 05218-1212 appears in the optical as aseyfert 1, despite the ~8.5x10^22 cm^-2 line-of-sight absorbing columnindicated by its x-ray spectrum. mcg -01-05-047's optical spectrum shows nosign of agn activity; it appears as a normal galaxy.

1110.6226	x-ray spectral variability in ngc 3783	ngc 3783 was observed for approximately 210ks by suzaku and in this timeshowed significant spectral and flux variability at both short (20ks) and long(100ks) time scales. the full observation is found to consist of approximatelysix "spectral periods" where the behaviour of the soft (0.3-1.0kev) and hard(2-10kev) bands are somewhat distinct. using a variety of methods we find thatthe strong warm absorber present in this source does not change on these timescales, confirming that the broad-band variability is intrinsic to the centralsource. the time resolved difference-spectra are well modelled with an absorbedpowerlaw below 10kev, but show an additional hard excess at ~20kev in thelatter stages of the observation. this suggests that, in addition to thevariable powerlaw, there is a further variable component that varies with timebut not monotonically with flux. we show that a likely interpretation is thatthis further component is associated with variations in the reflection fractionor possibly ionization state of the accretion disk a few gravitational radiifrom the black hole.

1111.0908	new insights on the accretion disk-winds connection in radio-loud agns  from suzaku	from the spectral analysis of long suzaku observations of five radio-loudagns we have been able to discover the presence of ultra-fast outflows withvelocities ~0.1c in three of them, namely 3c 111, 3c 120 and 3c 390.3. they areconsistent with being accretion disk winds/outflows. we also performed afollow-up on 3c 111 to monitor its outflow on ~7days time-scales and detectedan anti-correlated variability of a possible relativistic emission line withrespect to blue-shifted fe k features, following a flux increase. this providesthe first direct evidence for an accretion disk-wind connection in an agn. themass outflow rate of these outflows can be comparable to the accretion rate andtheir mechanical power can correspond to a significant fraction of thebolometric luminosity and is comparable to their typical jet power. therefore,they can possibly play a significant role in the expected feedback from agnsand can give us further clues on the relation between the accretion disk andthe formation of winds/jets.

1112.0036	probing relativistic astrophysics around smbhs: the suzaku agn spin  survey	in addition to providing vital clues as to the formation and evolution ofblack holes, the spin of black holes may be an important energy source in theuniverse. over the past couple of years, tremendous progress has been made inthe realm of observational measurements of spin. in particular, detailedcharacterization and modeling of x-ray spectral features emitted from the innerregions of black hole accretion disks have allowed us to probe the location ofthe innermost stable circular orbit and hence the spin. in this contribution, iwill describe the suzaku agn spin survey, an on-going cycle 4--6 suzaku keyproject that aims to probe five nearby agn with sufficient depth that stronggravity effects and spin can be robustly assessed. of the three objects forwhich we currently have our deep datasets, we can constrain spin in two(ngc3783, a&gt;0.9; fairall 9, $a=0.45\pm 0.15$) whereas complexities with thewarm absorber prevent us from reporting results for ngc3516. we conclude with abrief discussion of spin-dependent selection biases in flux-limited surveys.

1112.1717	relativistic iron k x-ray reverberation in ngc 4151	recent x-ray observations have enabled the study of reverberation delays inagn for the first time. all the detections so far are in sources with a strongsoft excess, and the measured delay is between the hard (1-3 kev) directcontinuum and the soft excess (0.5-1 kev), interpreted as the reflectioncontinuum smeared by relativistic effects. there is however an inherentambiguity in identifying and studying the details of the lines in the softexcess. here we report the first detection of reverberation in the iron k bandin any agn. using xmm-newton observations of ngc 4151, we find delays of order2000 s on time-scales of 10e5 s between the 5-6 kev band and 2-3 and 7-8 kevbands, with a broad lag profile resembling a relativistically-broadened ironline. the peak of the lag spectra shifts to lower energies at higherfrequencies, consistent with the red wing of the line being emitted at smallerradii, as expected from reflection off the inner accretion disk. this is afirst detection of a broad iron line using timing studies.

1204.5747	a monte carlo markov chain based investigation of black hole spin in the  active galaxy ngc3783	the analysis of relativistically broadened x-ray spectral features from theinner accretion disk provides a powerful tool for measuring the spin ofsupermassive black holes (smbh) in active galactic nuclei (agn). however, agnspectra are often complex and careful analysis employing appropriate andself-consistent models are required if one is to obtain robust results. in thispaper, we revisit the deep july-2009 suzaku observation of the seyfert galaxyngc3783 in order to study in a rigorous manner the robustness of the inferredblack hole spin parameter. using monte carlo markov chain (mcmc) techniques, weidentify a (partial) modeling degeneracy between the iron abundance of the diskand the black hole spin parameter. we show that the data for ngc3783 stronglyrequire both supersolar iron abundance (z_fe=2-4zsun) and a rapidly spinningblack hole (a&gt;0.88). we discuss various astrophysical considerations that canaffect the measured abundance. we note that, while the abundance enhancementinferred in ngc3783 is modest, the x-ray analysis of some other objects hasfound extreme iron abundances. we introduce the hypothesis that the radiativelevitation of iron ions in the innermost regions of radiation-dominated agndisks can enhance the photospheric abundance of iron. we show that radiativelevitation is a plausible mechanism in the very inner regions of high accretionrate agn disks.

1205.1734	comparison of ejection events in the jet and accretion disc outflows in  3c 111	we present a comparison of the parameters of accretion disc outflows and thejet of the broad-line radio galaxy 3c 111 on sub-pc scales. we make use ofpublished x-ray observations of ultra-fast outflows (ufos) and new 43ghz vlbaimages to track the jet knots ejection. we find that the superluminal jetcoexists with the mildly relativistic outflows on sub-pc scales, possiblyindicating a transverse stratification of a global flow. the two are roughly inpressure equilibrium, with the ufos potentially providing additional supportfor the initial jet collimation. the ufos are much more massive than the jet,but their kinetic power is probably about an order of magnitude lower, at leastfor the observations considered here. however, their momentum flux isequivalent and both of them are powerful enough to exert a concurrent feedbackimpact on the surrounding environment. a link between these components isnaturally predicted in the context of mhd models for jet/outflow formation.however, given the high radiation throughput of agns, radiation pressure shouldalso be taken into account. from the comparison with the long-term 2-10kev rxtelight curve we find that the ufos are preferentially detected during periods ofincreasing flux. we also find the possibility to place the ufos within theknown x-ray dips-jet ejection cycles, which has been shown to be a strong proofof the disc-jet connection, in analogue with stellar-mass black holes. however,given the limited number of observations presently available, these relationsare only tentative and additional spectral monitoring is needed to test themconclusively.

1208.4514	the disk-wind-jet connection in the black hole h 1743-322	x-ray disk winds are detected in spectrally soft, disk-dominated phases ofstellar-mass black hole outbursts. in contrast, compact, steady, relativisticjets are detected in spectrally hard states that are dominated by non-thermalx-ray emission. although these distinctive outflows appear to be almostmutually exclusive, it is possible that a disk wind persists in hard states butcannot be detected via x-ray absorption lines owing to very high ionization.here, we present an analysis of a deep, 60 ksec chandra/hetgs observation ofthe black hole candidate h 1743-322 in the low/hard state. the spectrum showsno evidence of a disk wind, with tight limits, and within the range of ionizingflux levels that were measured in prior chandra observations wherein a wind wasclearly detected. in h 1743-322, at least, disk winds are actually diminishedin the low/hard state, and disk winds and jets are likely state-dependent andanti-correlated. these results suggest that although the launching radii ofwinds and jets may differ by orders of magnitude, they may both be tied to afundamental property of the inner accretion flow, such as the mass accretionrate and/or the magnetic field topology of the disk. we discuss these resultsin the context of disk winds and jets in other stellar-mass black holes, andpossible launching mechanisms for black hole outflows.

1211.6722	the nature of filamentary cold gas in the core of the virgo cluster	we present a multi-wavelength study of the emission-line nebulae locatedsoutheast of the nucleus of m87, the central dominant galaxy of the virgocluster. we report the detection of far-infrared (fir) [cii] line emission fromthe nebulae using observations made with herschel pacs. the infrared lineemission is extended and cospatial with optical h{\alpha}+[nii],far-ultraviolet civ lines, and soft x-ray emission. the filamentary nebulaeevidently contain multi-phase material spanning a temperature range of at least5 orders of magnitude, from ~100 k to ~10^7 k. this material has most likelybeen uplifted by the agn from the center of m87. the thermal pressure of the10^4 k phase appears to be significantly lower than that of the surrounding hotintra-cluster medium (icm) indicating the presence of additional turbulent andmagnetic pressure in the filaments. if the turbulence in the filaments issubsonic then the magnetic field strength required to balance the pressure ofthe surrounding icm is b~30-70 {\mu}g. the spectral properties of the softx-ray emission from the filaments indicate that it is due to thermal plasmawith kt~0.5-1 kev, which is cooling by mixing with the cold gas and/orradiatively. charge exchange can be ruled out as a significant source of softx-rays. both cooling and mixing scenarios predict gas with a range oftemperatures. this is at first glance inconsistent with the apparent lack ofx-ray emitting gas with kt&lt;0.5 kev. however, we show that the missing very softx-ray emission could be absorbed by the cold gas in the filaments with anintegrated hydrogen column density of ~1.6x10^21 cm^-2, providing a naturalexplanation for the apparent temperature floor to the x-ray emission at kt~0.5kev. the fir through ultra-violet line emission is most likely primarilypowered by the icm particles penetrating the cold gas following a shearinginduced mixing process.

1212.4851	unification of x-ray winds in seyfert galaxies: from ultra-fast outflows  to warm absorbers	the existence of ionized x-ray absorbing layers of gas along the line ofsight to the nuclei of seyfert galaxies is a well established observationalfact. this material is systematically outflowing and shows a large range inparameters. however, its actual nature and dynamics are still not clear. inorder to gain insights into these important issues we performed a literaturesearch for papers reporting the parameters of the soft x-ray warm absorbers(was) in 35 type 1 seyferts and compared their properties to those of theultra-fast outflows (ufos) detected in the same sample. the fraction of sourceswith was is &gt;60%, consistent with previous studies. the fraction of sourceswith ufos is &gt;34%, &gt;67% of which also show was. the large dynamic rangeobtained when considering all the absorbers together allows us, for the firsttime, to investigate general relations among them. in particular, we findsignificant correlations indicating that the closer the absorber is to thecentral black hole, the higher the ionization, column, outflow velocity andconsequently the mechanical power. the absorbers continuously populate thewhole parameter space, with the was and the ufos lying always at the two endsof the distribution. this strongly suggest that these absorbers, oftenconsidered of different types, could actually represent parts of a singlelarge-scale stratified outflow observed at different locations from the blackhole. the observed parameters and correlations are consistent with bothradiation pressure through compton scattering and mhd processes contributing tothe outflow acceleration, the latter playing a major role. most of theabsorbers, especially the ufos, have a sufficiently high mechanical power tosignificantly contribute to agn feedback.

1309.4494	first results from nustar observations of mkn 421	mkn 421 is a nearby active galactic nucleus dominated at all wavelengths by avery broad non-thermal continuum thought to arise from a relativistic jet seenat a small angle to the line of sight. its spectral energy distribution peaksin the x-ray and tev gamma-ray bands, where the energy output is dominated bycooling of high-energy electrons in the jet. in order to study the electrondistribution and its evolution, we carried out a dedicated multi-wavelengthcampaign, including extensive observations by the recently launched highlysensitive hard x-ray telescope nustar, between december 2012 and may 2013. herewe present some initial results based on nustar data from january through march2013, as well as calibration observations conducted in 2012. although theobservations cover some of the faintest hard x-ray flux states ever observedfor mkn 421, the sensitivity is high enough to resolve intra-day spectralvariability. we find that in this low state the dominant flux variations aresmooth on timescales of hours, with typical intra-hour variations of less than5%. we do not find evidence for either a cutoff in the hard x-ray spectrum, ora rise towards a high-energy component, but rather that at low flux thespectrum assumes a power law shape with a photon index of approximately 3. thespectrum is found to harden with increasing brightness.

1310.0822	hard x-ray lags in active galactic nuclei: testing the distant  reverberation hypothesis with ngc 6814	we present an x-ray spectral and temporal analysis of the variable activegalaxy ngc 6814, observed with suzaku during november 2011. remarkably, thex-ray spectrum shows no evidence for the soft excess commonly observed amongstother active galaxies, despite its relatively low level of obscuration, and isdominated across the whole suzaku bandpass by the intrinsic powerlaw-likecontinuum. despite this, we clearly detect the presence of a low frequency hardlag of ~1600s between the 0.5-2.0 and 2.0-5.0 kev energy bands at greater than6-sigma significance, similar to those reported in the literature for a varietyof other agn. at these energies, any additional emission from e.g. a very weak,undetected soft excess, or from distant reflection must contribute less than 3%of the observed countrates (at 90% confidence). given the lack of anysignificant continuum emission component other than the powerlaw, we can ruleout models that invoke distant reprocessing for the observed lag behavior,which must instead be associated with this continuum emission. these resultsare fully consistent with a propagating fluctuation origin for the lowfrequency hard lags, and with the interpretation of the high frequency softlags - a common feature seen in the highest quality agn data with strong softexcesses - as reverberation from the inner accretion disk.

1310.5450	the origin of cold gas in giant elliptical galaxies and its role in  fueling radio-mode agn feedback	we present a multi-wavelength study of the interstellar medium in eightnearby, x-ray and optically bright, giant elliptical galaxies. using herschelpacs, we map the cold gas in the lines of [cii], [oi], and [oib]. additionally,we present ha+[nii] imaging of warm ionized gas with the soar telescope, and astudy of the hot x-ray emitting plasma with chandra. all systems with extendedha emission in our sample (6/8 galaxies) display significant [cii] lineemission indicating the presence of cold gas. this emission is co-spatial withthe ha+[nii] emitting nebulae and the lowest entropy x-ray emitting plasma. theentropy profiles of the hot galactic atmospheres show a clear dichotomy, withthe systems displaying extended emission line nebulae having lower entropiesbeyond r~1 kpc than the cold-gas-poor systems. we show that while the hotatmospheres of the cold-gas-poor galaxies are thermally stable outside of theirinnermost cores, the atmospheres of the cold-gas-rich systems are prone tocooling instabilities. this result indicates that the cold gas is producedchiefly by thermally unstable cooling from the hot phase. we show that coolinginstabilities may develop more easily in rotating systems and discuss analternative condition for thermal instability for this case. the hotatmospheres of cold-gas-rich galaxies display disturbed morphologies indicatingthat the accretion of clumpy multiphase gas in these systems may result invariable power output of the agn jets, potentially triggering sporadic, largeroutbursts. in the two cold-gas-poor, x-ray morphologically relaxed galaxies ofour sample, ngc 1399 and ngc 4472, powerful agn outbursts may have destroyed orremoved most of the cold gas from the cores, allowing the jets to propagate anddeposit most of their energy further out, increasing the entropy of the hotgalactic atmospheres and leaving their cores relatively undisturbed.

1401.1615	on the determination of the spin and disc truncation of accreting black  holes using x-ray reflection	we discuss the application of simple relativistically-blurred x-rayreflection models to the determination of the spin and the inner radius of thedisc in accreting black holes. observationally, the nature of the corona isuncertain a priori, but a robust determination of the inner disk radius can bemade when the disc emissivity index is tightly constrained. when the inner discis well illuminated, the black hole spin can also be determined. usingreflection modelling derived from ray tracing, we show that robustdetermination of disc truncation requires that the location of the coronalsource is quasi-static and at a height and radius less than the truncationradius of the disc. robust spin measurements require that at least part of thecorona lies less than about 10 gravitational radii above the black hole inorder that the innermost regions, including the innermost stable circularorbit, are well illuminated. the width of the blurring kernel (e.g., the ironline) has a strong dependence on coronal height. these limitations may beparticularly applicable at low eddington fractions (e.g. the low/hard state,and low-luminosity agn) where the height of the corona may be relatively large,or outflowing, and tied to jet production.

0802.3882	initial measurements of black hole spin in gx 339-4 from suzaku  spectroscopy	we report on a deep suzaku observation of the stellar-mass black hole gx339-4 in outburst. a clear, strong, relativistically-shaped iron emission linefrom the inner accretion disk is observed. the broad-band disk reflectionspectrum revealed is one of the most sensitive yet obtained from an accretingblack hole. we fit the suzaku spectra with a physically-motivated diskreflection model, blurred by a new relativistic line function in which theblack hole spin parameter is a variable. this procedure yielded a black holespin parameter of a = 0.89 +/- 0.04. joint modeling of these suzaku spectra andprior xmm-newton spectra obtained in two different outburst phases yields aspin parameter of a = 0.93 +/- 0.01. the degree of consistency between theseresults suggests that disk reflection models allow for spin measurements thatare not strongly biased by scattering effects. we suggest that the best valueof the black hole spin parameter is a = 0.93 +/- 0.01 (statistical) +/- 0.04(systematic). although preliminary, these results represent the first directmeasurement of non-zero spin in a stellar-mass black hole using relativisticline modeling.

1404.5620	nustar and xmm-newton observations of ngc 1365: extreme absorption  variability and a constant inner accretion disk	we present a spectral analysis of four coordinated nustar+xmm-newtonobservations of the seyfert galaxy ngc 1365. these exhibit an extreme level ofspectral variability, which is primarily due to variable line-of-sightabsorption, revealing relatively unobscured states in this source for the firsttime. despite the diverse range of absorption states, each of the observationsdisplays the same characteristic signatures of relativistic reflection from theinner accretion disk. through time-resolved spectroscopy we find that thestrength of the relativistic iron line and the compton reflection hump relativeto the intrinsic continuum are well correlated, as expected if they are twoaspects of the same broadband reflection spectrum. we apply self-consistentdisk reflection models to these time-resolved spectra in order to constrain theinner disk parameters, allowing for variable, partially covering absorption toaccount for the vastly different absorption states observed. each of the fourobservations is treated independently to test the consistency of the resultsobtained for the black hole spin and the disk inclination, which should notvary on observable timescales. we find both the spin and the inclinationdetermined from the reflection spectrum to be consistent, confirming ngc 1365hosts a rapidly rotating black hole; in all cases the dimensionless spinparameter is constrained to be a* &gt; 0.97 (at 90% statistical confidence orbetter).

1408.5414	the nustar view of nearby compton-thick agn: the cases of ngc 424, ngc  1320 and ic 2560	we present x-ray spectral analyses for three seyfert 2 active galacticnuclei, ngc 424, ngc 1320, and ic 2560, observed by nustar in the 3-79 kevband. the high quality hard x-ray spectra allow detailed modeling of thecompton reflection component for the first time in these sources. usingquasi-simultaneous nustar and swift/xrt data, as well as archival xmm-newtondata, we find that all three nuclei are obscured by compton-thick material withcolumn densities in excess of ~5 x $10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and that their x-rayspectra above 3 kev are dominated by reflection of the intrinsic continuum oncompton-thick material. due to the very high obscuration, absorbed intrinsiccontinuum components are not formally required by the data in any of thesources. we constrain the intrinsic photon indices and the column density ofthe reflecting medium through the shape of the reflection spectra. usingarchival multi-wavelength data we recover the intrinsic x-ray luminositiesconsistent with the broadband spectral energy distributions. our results areconsistent with the reflecting medium being an edge-on clumpy torus with arelatively large global covering factor and overall reflection efficiency ofthe order of 1%. given the unambiguous confirmation of the compton-thick natureof the sources, we investigate whether similar sources are likely to be missedby commonly used selection criteria for compton-thick agn, and explore thepossibility of finding their high-redshift counterparts.

1410.3357	iron k and compton hump reverberation in swift j2127.4+5654 and ngc 1365  revealed by nustar and xmm-newton	in the past five years, a flurry of x-ray reverberation lag measurements ofaccreting supermassive black holes have been made using the xmm-newtontelescope in the 0.3-10 kev energy range. in this work, we use the nustartelescope to extend the lag analysis up to higher energies for two seyfertgalaxies, swift j2127.4+5654 and ngc 1365. x-ray reverberation lags are due tothe light travel time delays between the direct continuum emission and thereprocessed emission from the inner radii of an ionised accretion disc.xmm-newton has been particularly adept at measuring the lag associated with thebroad fe k emission line, where the gravitationally redshifted wing of the lineis observed to respond before the line centroid at 6.4 kev, produced at largerradii. now we use nustar to probe the lag at higher energies, where thespectrum shows clear evidence for compton reflection, known as the compton'hump'. the xmm-newton data show fe k lags in both swift j2127.4+5654 and ngc1365. the nustar data provide independent confirmation of these fe k lags, andalso show evidence for the corresponding compton hump lags, especially in swiftj2127.4+5654. these broadband lag measurements confirm that the compton humpand fe k lag are produced at small radii. at low-frequencies in ngc 1365, wherethe spectrum shows evidence for eclipsing clouds in the line of sight, we finda clear negative (not positive) lag from 2--10 kev, which can be understood asthe decrease in column density from a neutral eclipsing cloud moving out of ourline of sight during the observation.

1412.5978	coronal properties of the seyfert 1.9 galaxy mcg -05-23-016 determined  from hard x-ray spectroscopy with nustar	measurements of the high-energy cut-off in the coronal continuum of activegalactic nuclei have long been elusive for all but a small number of thebrightest examples. we present a direct measurement of the cut-off energy inthe nuclear continuum of the nearby seyfert 1.9 galaxy mcg -05-23-016 withunprecedented precision. the high sensitivity of nustar up to 79 kev allows usto clearly disentangle the spectral curvature of the primary continuum fromthat of its reflection component. using a simple phenomenological model for thehard x-ray spectrum, we constrain the cut-off energy to $116_{-5}^{+6}$ kevwith 90% confidence. testing for more complex models and nuisance parametersthat could potentially influence the measurement, we find that the cut-off isdetected robustly. we further use simple comptonized plasma models to provideindependent constraints for both the kinetic temperature of the electrons inthe corona and its optical depth. at the 90% confidence level, we find$kt_e=29\pm2$ kev and $\tau_e=1.23\pm0.08$ assuming a slab (disk-like)geometry, and $kt_e=25\pm2$ kev and $\tau_e=3.5\pm0.2$ assuming a sphericalgeometry. both geometries are found to fit the data equally well and their twoprincipal physical parameters are correlated in both cases. with the opticaldepth in the optically thick regime, the data are pushing the currentlyavailable theoretical models of the comptonized plasma to the limits of theirvalidity. since the spectral features and variability arising from the inneraccretion disk have been observed previously in mcg -05-23-016, the inferredhigh optical depth implies that a spherical or disk-like corona cannot behomogeneous.

1501.07664	wind from the black-hole accretion disk driving a molecular outflow in  an active galaxy	powerful winds driven by active galactic nuclei (agn) are often invoked toplay a fundamental role in the evolution of both supermassive black holes(smbhs) and their host galaxies, quenching star formation and explaining thetight smbh-galaxy relations. recent observations of large-scale molecularoutflows in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) have provided theevidence to support these studies, as they directly trace the gas out of whichstars form. theoretical models suggest an origin of these outflows asenergy-conserving flows driven by fast agn accretion disk winds. previousclaims of a connection between large-scale molecular outflows and agn activityin ulirgs were incomplete because they were lacking the detection of theputative inner wind. conversely, studies of powerful agn accretion disk windsto date have focused only on x-ray observations of local seyferts and a fewhigher redshift quasars. here we show the clear detection of a powerful agnaccretion disk wind with a mildly relativistic velocity of 0.25c in the x-rayspectrum of iras f11119+3257, a nearby (z = 0.189) optically classified type 1ulirg hosting a powerful molecular outflow. the agn is responsible for ~80% ofthe emission, with a quasar-like luminosity of l_agn = 1.5x10^46 erg/s. theenergetics of these winds are consistent with the energy-conserving mechanism,which is the basis of the quasar mode feedback in agn lacking powerful radiojets.

astro-ph;0201271	the hydrodynamics of dead radio galaxies	we present a numerical investigation of dead, or relic, radio galaxies andthe environmental impact that radio galaxy activity has on the host galaxy orgalaxy cluster. we perform axisymmetric hydrodynamical calculations of light,supersonic, back-to-back jets propagating in a beta-model galaxy/clusteratmosphere. we then shut down the jet activity and let the resulting structureevolve passively. the dead source undergoes an initial phase of pressure drivenexpansion until it achieves pressure equilibrium with its surroundings.thereafter, buoyancy forces drive the evolution and lead to the formation oftwo oppositely directed plumes that float high into the galaxy/clusteratmosphere. these plumes entrain a significant amount of low entropy materialfrom the galaxy/cluster core and lift it high into the atmosphere. an importantresult is that a large fraction (at least half) of the energy injected by thejet activity is thermalized in the ism/icm core. the whole ism/icm atmosphereinflates in order to regain hydrostatic equilibrium. this inflation is mediatedby an approximately spherical disturbance which propagates into the atmosphereat the sound speed. the fact that such a large fraction of the injected energyis thermalized suggests that radio galaxies may have an important role in theoverall energy budget of rich ism/icm atmospheres. in particular, they may actas a strong and highly time-dependent source of negative feedback forgalaxy/cluster cooling flows.

astro-ph;0506082	a chandra hetgs spectral study of the iron k bandpass in mcg-6-30-15: a  narrow view of the broad iron line	we present a high resolution x-ray spectrum of the iron k bandpass inmcg-6-30-15 based on a 522 ksec observation with chandra's high energytransmission grating spectrometer. the chandra spectrum is consistent with thepresence of a relativistically broadened, highly redshifted iron k alphaemission line with a similar profile to previous observations. a number ofnarrow features are detected above 2 kev, including a narrow fe k alphaemission line and narrow absorption lines from h- and he-like fe, h-like s andh-like si. this absorption is well described by a photoionized plasma with acolumn density log n_h = 23.2 and an ionization parameter log xi = 3.6,assuming the iron abundance has the solar value and a velocity dispersionparameter b = 100 km/s. applying this absorption model to a high fidelityxmm-newton epic-pn spectrum we find that a broad iron line is still requiredwith emission extending to within 1.9 gravitational radii of the black hole. ifthe iron line comes from an accretion disk truncated at the innermost stablecircular orbit, this indicates that the black hole must be spinning rapidlywith a&gt;0.95. ionized absorption models attempting to explain the 3-6 kevspectral curvature without strong gravity predict absorption lines in the6.4-6.6 kev range that are inconsistent with the chandra spectrum. the h- andhe-like iron absorption lines in the chandra spectrum are blueshifted by 2.0(+0.7/-0.9) x 10^3 km/s compared to the source frame, and may originate in ahigh velocity, high ionization component of the warm absorber outflow. thishigh ionization component may dominate the energy budget of the outflow, andaccount for a significant fraction of the outflowing mass.

(1994), the iron line is broad and strong (equivalent width\sim300\thinspace ev). the line profile is also suggestive of it being skewed.such a line would be expected from a relativistic accretion disk. we also findvery rapid primary x-ray variability. assuming relativistic beaming to beunimportant, the derived efficiency is comparable to the maximum obtainablefrom accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole. correlated variability outsideof the energy range of {\it asca} might exceed this maximum, thus requiringefficient accretion onto a kerr hole.

astro-ph;9610097	the `quiescent' black hole in m87	it is believed that most giant elliptical galaxies possess nuclear blackholes with masses in excess of $10^8\msun$. bondi accretion from theinterstellar medium might then be expected to produce quasar-like luminositiesfrom the nuclei of even quiescent elliptical galaxies. it is a puzzle that suchluminosities are not observed. motivated by this problem, fabian &amp; rees haverecently suggested that the final stages of accretion in these objects occursin an advection-dominated mode with a correspondingly small radiativeefficiency. despite possessing a long-known active nucleus and dynamicalevidence for a black hole, the low radiative and kinetic luminosities of thecore of m87 provide the best illustration of this problem. we examine anadvection-dominated model for the nucleus of m87 and show that accretion at thebondi rate is compatible with the best known estimates for the core flux fromradio through to x-ray wavelengths. the success of this model prompts us topropose that fr-i radio galaxies and quiescent elliptical galaxies accrete inan advection dominated mode whereas fr-ii type radio-loud nuclei possessradiatively efficient thin accretion disks.

astro-ph;9610127	an x-ray spectral study of 24 type-1 agn	i present a study of the x-ray spectral properties of a sample containing 24type-1 active galactic nuclei using the medium spectral resolution of ``asca''.the sample consists of 20 radio-quiet objects and 4 radio-loud objects. asimple power-law continuum absorbed by galactic material provides a very poordescription of the spectra of most objects. deviations from the power-law formare interpreted in terms of x-ray reprocessing/absorption processes. inparticular, at least half of the objects show k-shell absorption edges of warmoxygen (o vii and o viii) characteristic of optically-thin, photoionizedmaterial along the line-of-sight to the central engine, the so-called warmabsorber. it is found that objects with significant optical reddening displaydeep o vii edges. coupled with other evidence, this suggests the existence ofdusty warm plasma. a radiatively driven outflow originating from the moleculartorus is probably the source of this plasma. rapid variability of the warmabsorber also points to there being another component closer to the centralsource and probably situated within the broad line region.  spectral features at energies characteristic of cold fluorescent ironk$\alpha$ emission are common. radio-quiet objects have iron emission welldescribed as originating from either the inner regions of an accretion disk or,in a small number of cases, from the molecular torus. two of the radio-loudobjects (3c~120 and 3c~382) have a much broader feature which presents problemsfor the relativistic disk model. the presence of radio-jets may be important informing this spectral feature.

astro-ph;9707160	a multi-wavelength study of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6-30-15	we present a multiwaveband spectroscopic study of the nearby seyfert 1 galaxymcg-6-30-15. new optical spectra from the anglo-australian telescope arepresented which clearly show the effects of dust extinction/reddening on boththe emission line spectrum and the non-stellar agn continuum. the reddening isconstrained to be in the range e(b-v)=0.61-1.09. spectroscopy in the x-rayband, with both rosat and asca, reveal absorption by the warm absorber butlittle or no neutral absorption expected to accompany the dust responsible forthe optical reddening. the dusty warm absorber solution to this discrepancy isdiscussed and photoionization models of such warm absorbers are constructed.the optical spectrum also displays the relatively strong `coronal' lines of[fex]6375, [fexi]7892 and [fexiv]5303. we show that these lines may plausiblyoriginate from the outer regions of the warm absorber, although bettercalculations of the collision strengths for these transitions are required inorder to conclusively address this issue. we also present new ultraviolet datafrom the international ultraviolet explorer and suggest that much of theobserved uv flux is scattered into our line of sight (with a scatteringfraction of 1-5 per cent). we conclude with a discussion of the globalenergetics of this system.

astro-ph;9707216	x-ray absorption by ionized oxygen in asca spectra of the infrared  quasar iras 13349+2438	we present evidence for x-ray absorption by ionized oxygen in asca spectra ofthe prototype infrared quasar iras 13349+2438. this powerful (2e46 erg/s)quasar was studied in detail with rosat, and the combination of the x-ray dataand optical/near-infrared spectropolarimetry strongly suggested the presence ofa dusty ionized (`warm') absorber along the line of sight to the central x-raysource. the asca spectra, in contrast to an earlier claim, show evidence forionized oxygen edges, and the presence of such edges appears to provide themost physically plausible interpretation of the data. thus, the asca spectrasupport the dusty warm absorber hypothesis. the asca data also allow thephysical properties of the warm absorber to be constrained far better thanbefore. a one-zone warm absorber model indicates the ionized column to be inthe range (2--6) x 10^{21} cm^{-2}, and it gives an ionization parameter ofxi=31^{+12}_{-12} erg cm s^{-1}. the dusty warm absorber appears to have adensity below 3e8 cm^{-3}, and it is probably located outside the broad-lineregion. the dust in the warm absorber does not appear to have been heavilysputtered or destroyed via other means. based on the asca fitting, we suggestthat ultraviolet absorption lines from the warm absorber may be detectable anddiscuss how they can further constrain the warm absorber properties. we compareand contrast the x-ray properties of iras 13349+2438 with those of broadabsorption line quasars. we comment on the steep &gt; 2 kev continuum of iras13349+2438 and examine the relevance to some models of radiative fe iiformation.

astro-ph;9806168	are the nuclei of seyfert 2 galaxies viewed face-on?	we show from modeling the fe kalpha line in the asca spectra of four x-raybright narrow emission line galaxies (seyfert types 1.9 and 2) that two equallyviable physical models can describe the observed line profile. the first isdiscussed by turner et al. (1998) and consists of emission from a nearlypole-on accretion disk. the second, which is statistically preferred, is asuperposition of emission from an accretion disk viewed at an intermediateinclination of about 48 degrees and a distinct, unresolved feature thatpresumably originates some distance from the galaxy nucleus. the intermediateinclination is entirely consistent with unified schemes and our findingschallenge recent assertions that seyfert 2 galaxies are preferentially viewedwith their inner regions face-on. we derive mean equivalent widths for thenarrow and disk lines of &lt;eqw_n&gt;=60 ev and &lt;eqw_d&gt; = 213 ev, respectively. thex-ray data are well described by a geometry in which our view of the activenucleus intersects and is blocked by the outer edges of the obscuring torus,and therefore do not require severe misalignments between the accretion diskand the torus.

astro-ph;9806327	x-ray iron line reverberation from black hole accretion disks	the relativistically broad x-ray iron line seen in many agn spectra isthought to originate from the central regions of the putative black holeaccretion disk. both the line profile and strength will vary in response torapid variability of the primary x-ray continuum source. the temporal responseof the line contains information on the accretion disk structure, the x-raysource geometry, and the spin of the black hole. since the x-ray source willhave a size comparable to the fluorescing region of the accretion disk, thegeneral reverberation problem is not invertible. however, progress can be madesince, empirically, agn light curves are seen to undergo dramatic shorttimescale variability which presumably corresponds to the creation of a singlenew active region within the distributed x-ray source. the iron line responseto these individual events can be described using linear transfer theory. weconsider the line response to the activation/flaring of a new x-ray emittingregion. most of our detailed calculations are performed for the case of anx-ray source on the symmetry axis and at some height above the disk planearound a kerr black hole. we also present preliminary calculations for off-axisflares. we suggest ways in which future, high-throughput x-ray observatoriessuch as xmm and the constellation x-ray mission may use these reverberationsignatures to probe both the mass and spin of agn black holes, as well as thex-ray source geometry.

astro-ph;9810018	compton reflection and iron fluorescence in agn and gbhcs	any cold, optically-thick matter in the vicinity of an accreting black hole,such as the accretion disk, can intercept and reprocess some fraction of thehard x-ray continuum emission, thereby imprinting atomic features into theobserved spectrum. this process of `x-ray reflection' primarily gives rise to abroad reflection `hump' peaking at 30kev and an iron emission line at 6.4kev.in this review, i briefly describe the physics of this process before reviewingthe observations of these features in active galactic nuclei (agn) and galacticblack hole candidates (gbhcs). in some agn, seyfert galaxies in particular, theiron line is found to be very broad and asymmetric. it is believed that suchlines arise from the innermost regions of the accretion disk, withmildly-relativistic doppler shifts and gravitational redshifts combining toproduce the line profile. hence, such lines give us a direct observationalprobe of the region within several gravitational radii of the black hole. thecomplications that plague similar studies of gbhcs, such as disk ionization andthe possibly of inner disk disruption, are also addressed. i conclude with adiscussion of iron line reverberation, i.e. temporal changes of the iron lineas `echos' of large x-ray flares sweep across the accretion disk. it is shownthat interesting reverberation effects, such as a definitive signature ofextremal kerr geometry, is within reach of high throughput spectrometers suchas constellation-x.

astro-ph;9907114	simultaneous euve/asca/rxte observations of ngc 5548	we present simultaneous observations by euve, asca, and rxte of the type~1seyfert galaxy ngc 5548. these data indicate that variations in the euvemission (at $\sim 0.2 $kev) appear to lead similar modulations in higherenergy ($\ga 1 $kev) x-rays by $\sim$10--30 ks. this is contrary to popularmodels which attribute the correlated variability of the euv, uv and opticalemission in type~1 seyferts to reprocessing of higher energy radiation. thisbehavior instead suggests that the variability of the optical through euvemission is an important driver for the variability of the harder x-rays whichare likely produced by thermal comptonization. we also investigate the spectralcharacteristics of the fluorescent iron k$\alpha$ line and compton reflectionemission. in contrast to prior measurements of these spectral features, we findthat the iron k$\alpha$ line has a relatively small equivalent width($w_{k\alpha} \sim 100 $ev) and that the reflection component is consistentwith a covering factor which is significantly less than unity ($\omega/2\pi\sim 0.4$--0.5). notably, although the 2--10 kev x-ray flux varies by $\sim \pm25$% and the derived reflection fraction appears to be constant throughout ourobservations, the flux in the fe~k$\alpha$ line is also constant. this behavioris difficult to reconcile in the context of standard compton reflection models.

astro-ph;9907352	first constraints on iron abundance versus reflection fraction from the  seyfert~1 galaxy mcg--6-30-15	we report on a joint asca and rxte observation spanning an $\sim$ 400~ks timeinterval of the bright seyfert~1 galaxy mcg--6-30-15. the data clearly confirmthe presence of a broad skewed iron line ($w_{k\alpha} \sim$ 266 ev) andcompton reflection continuum at higher energies reported in our previous paper.we also investigate whether the gravitational and doppler effects that affectthe iron line may also be manifest in the reflected continuum. the uniquenessof this data set is underlined by the extremely good statistics that we obtainfrom the approximately four million photons that make up the 2-20 kev rxte pcaspectrum alone. this, coupled with the high energy coverage of hexte and thespectral resolution of asca in the iron line regime has allowed us to constrainthe relationship between abundance and reflection fraction for the first timeat the 99 per cent confidence level. the reflection fraction is entirelyconsistent with a flat disk, i.e. the cold material subtends $\rm 2 \pi$ sr atthe source, to an accuracy of 20 per cent. monte carlo simulations show thatthe observed strong iron line intensity is explained by an overabundance ofiron by a factor of $\sim$ 2 and an underabundance of the lower-z elements by asimilar factor. by considering non-standard abundances, a clear and consistentpicture can be made in which both the iron line and reflection continuum comefrom the same material such as e.g. an accretion disk.

astro-ph;9909239	the x-ray variability of the seyfert~1 galaxy mcg-6-30-15 from long asca  and rxte observations	we present an analysis of the long rxte observation of the seyfert~1 galaxymcg-6-30-15, taken in july 1997. our results show that the behaviour iscomplicated. we find clear evidence from colour ratios and direct spectralfitting that changes to the intrinsic photon index are taking place. spectralhardening is evident during periods of diminished intensity; in particular, ageneral trend for harder spectra is seen in the period following the hardestrxte flare. flux-correlated studies further show that the 3-10 kev photon indexsteepens while that in the 10-20 kev band, flattens with flux. the largestchanges come from the spectral index below 10kev; however, changes in theintrinsic power law slope, and reflection both contribute in varying degrees tothe overall spectral variability. we find that the iron line flux is consistentwith being constant over large time intervals on the order of days (althoughthe asca and rxte spectra show that $f_{k\alpha}$ changes on shorter timeintervals of order &lt; 10ks), and equivalent width which anticorrelates with thecontinuum flux, and reflection fraction. flux-correlated studies point atpossible ionization signatures, while detailed spectral analysis of short timeintervals surrounding flare events hint tentatively at observed spectralresponses to the flare. we present a simple model for partial ionization wherethe bulk of the variability comes from within 6r_g. temporal analysis furtherprovides evidence for possible time (&lt; 1000s) and phase (phi~0.6 rad) lags.finally, we report an apparent break in the power density spectrum (~ 4-5 x10^{-6}hz) and a possible 33 hr period. estimates for the mass of the blackhole in mcg-6-30-15 are discussed in the context of spectral and temporalfindings.

astro-ph;9912001	on the lack of x-ray iron line reverberation in mcg-6-30-15:  implications for the black hole mass and accretion disk structure	we use the method of press, rybicki &amp; hewitt (1992) to search for time lagsand time leads between different energy bands of the rxte data for mcg-6-30-15.we tailor our search in order to probe any reverberation signatures of thefluorescent iron kalpha line that is thought to arise from the inner regions ofthe black hole accretion disk. in essence, an optimal reconstruction algorithmis applied to the continuum band (2-4kev) light curve which smoothes out noiseand interpolates across the data gaps. the reconstructed continuum band lightcurve can then be folded through trial transfer functions in an attempt to findlags or leads between the continuum band and the iron line band (5-7kev). wefind reduced fractional variability in the line band. the spectral analysis oflee et al. (1999) reveals this to be due to a combination of an apparentlyconstant iron line flux (at least on timescales of few x 10^4s), and fluxcorrelated changes in the photon index. we also find no evidence for iron linereverberation and exclude reverberation delays in the range 0.5-50ksec. thisextends the conclusions of lee et al. and suggests that the iron line fluxremains constant on timescales as short as 0.5ksec. the large black hole mass(&gt;10^8msun) naively suggested by the constancy of the iron line flux isrejected on other grounds. we suggest that the black hole in mcg-6-30-15 has amass of m_bh~10^6-10^7msun and that changes in the ionization state of the diskmay produce the puzzling spectral variability. finally, it is found that the8-15kev band lags the 2-4kev band by 50-100s. this result is used to placeconstraints on the size and geometry of the comptonizing medium responsible forthe hard x-ray power-law in this agn.

0706.1083	an x-ray spectral analysis of the central regions of ngc 4593	we present a detailed analysis of xmm-newton epic-pn data for the seyfert-1galaxy ngc 4593. we discuss the x-ray spectral properties of this source aswell as its variations with time. the 0.5-10 kev spectrum shows significantcomplexity beyond a simple power-law form, with clear evidence existing for a"soft excess" as well as absorption by highly ionized plasma (a warm absorber)within the central engine of this active galactic nucleus. we show that thesoft excess is best described as originating from thermal comptonization byplasma that is appreciably cooler than the primary x-ray emitting plasma; wefind that the form of the soft excess cannot be reproduced adequately byreflection from an ionized accretion disk. the only measurable deviation fromthe power-law continuum in the hard spectrum comes from the presence of coldand ionized fluorescent iron-k emission lines at 6.4 and 6.97 kev,respectively. while constraints on the ionized iron line are weak, the coldline is found to be narrow at ccd-resolution with a flux that does not trackthe temporal changes in the underlying continuum, implying an origin in theouter radii of the accretion disk or the putative molecular torus of seyfertunification schemes. the x-ray continuum itself varies on all accessible timescales. we detect a ~230-second time-lag between soft and hard epic-pn bandsthat, if interpreted as scattering timescales within a comptonizing diskcorona, can be used to constrain the physical size of the primary x-ray sourceto a characteristic length scale of ~2 gravitational radii. taken together, thesmall implied coronal size and the large implied iron line emitting regionindicate a departure from the current picture of a "typical" agn geometry.

0812.0984	frying doughnuts: what can the reprocessing of x-rays to ir tell us  about the agn environment?	active galactic nuclei (agn) produce vast amounts of high energy radiationdeep in their central engines. x-rays either escape the agn or are absorbed andre-emitted mostly as ir. by studying the dispersion in the ratio of observedmid-ir luminosity to observed 2-10kev x-ray luminosity (r_{ir/x}) in agn we caninvestigate the reprocessing material (possibly a torus or donut of dust) inthe agn central engine, independent of model assumptions. we studied the ratioof observed mid-ir and 2-10kev x-ray luminosities in a heterogeneous sample of245 agn from the literature. we found that when we removed agn with prominentjets, ~90% of type i agn lay within a very tight dispersion in luminosity ratio(1&lt;r_{ir/x}&lt;30). this implies that the agn central engine is extremely uniformand models of the physical agn environment (e.g. cloud cover, turbulent disk,opening angle of absorbing structures such as dusty tori) must span a verynarrow range of parameters. we also found that the far-ir(100um) to mid-ir(12um) observed luminosity ratio is an effective descriminator between heavilyobscured agn and relatively unobscured agn.
