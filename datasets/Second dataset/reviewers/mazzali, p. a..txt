0904.4632	nebular emission-line profiles of type ib/c supernovae - probing the  ejecta asphericity	in order to assess qualitatively the ejecta geometry of stripped-envelopecore-collapse supernovae, we investigate 98 late-time spectra of 39 objects,many of them previously unpublished. we perform a gauss-fitting of the [o i]6300, 6364 feature in all spectra, with the position, full width at halfmaximum (fwhm) and intensity of the 6300 gaussian as free parameters, and the6364 gaussian added appropriately to account for the doublet nature of the [oi] feature. on the basis of the best-fit parameters, the objects are organisedinto morphological classes, and we conclude that at least half of all type ib/csupernovae must be aspherical. bipolar jet-models do not seem to be universallyapplicable, as we find too few symmetric double-peaked [o i] profiles. in someobjects the [o i] line exhibits a variety of shifted secondary peaks orshoulders, interpreted as blobs of matter ejected at high velocity and possiblyaccompanied by neutron-star kicks to assure momentum conservation. at phasesearlier than ~200d, a systematic blueshift of the [o i] 6300, 6364 linecentroids can be discerned. residual opacity provides the most convincingexplanation of this phenomenon, photons emitted on the rear side of the snbeing scattered or absorbed on their way through the ejecta. once modified toaccount for the doublet nature of the oxygen feature, the profile of mg i] 4571at sufficiently late phases generally resembles that of [o i] 6300, 6364,suggesting negligible contamination from other lines and confirming that o andmg are similarly distributed within the ejecta.

0707.1024	a three-dimensional deflagration model for type ia supernovae confronted  with observations	a simulation of the thermonuclear explosion of a chandrasekhar-mass c+o whitedwarf, the most popular scenario of a type ia supernova (sn ia), is presented.the underlying modeling is pursued in a self-consistent way, treating thecombustion wave as a turbulent deflagration using well tested methods developedfor laboratory combustion and based on the concept of `large eddy simulations'(les). such consistency requires to capture the onset of the turbulent cascadeon resolved scales. this is achieved by computing the dynamical evolution on a1024$^3$ moving grid, which resulted in the best-resolved three-dimensional snia simulation carried out thus far, reaching the limits of what can be done onpresent supercomputers. consequently, the model has no free parameters otherthan the initial conditions at the onset of the explosion, and therefore it hasconsiderable predictive power. our main objective is to determine to whichextent such a simulation can account for the observations of normal sne ia.guided by previous simulations with less resolution and a less sophisticatedflame model, initial conditions were chosen that yield a reasonably strongexplosion and a sufficient amount of radioactive nickel for a bright display.we show that observables are indeed matched to a reasonable degree. inparticular, good agreement is found with the light curves of normal sne ia.moreover, the model reproduces the general features of the abundancestratification as inferred from the analysis of spectra. this indicates that itcaptures the main features of the explosion mechanism of sne ia. however, wealso show that even a seemingly best-choice pure deflagration model hasshortcomings that indicate the need for a different mode of nuclear burning atlate times, perhaps the transition to a detonation at low density.

0911.3774	characteristic velocities of stripped-envelope core-collapse supernova  cores	the velocity of the inner ejecta of stripped-envelope core-collapsesupernovae (cc-sne) is studied by means of an analysis of their nebularspectra. stripped-envelope cc-sne are the result of the explosion of bare coresof massive stars ($\geq 8$ m$_{\odot}$), and their late-time spectra aretypically dominated by a strong [o {\sc i}] $\lambda\lambda$6300, 6363 emissionline produced by the innermost, slow-moving ejecta which are not visible atearlier times as they are located below the photosphere. a characteristicvelocity of the inner ejecta is obtained for a sample of 56 stripped-envelopecc-sne of different spectral types (iib, ib, ic) using direct measurements ofthe line width as well as spectral fitting. for most sne, this value shows asmall scatter around 4500 km s$^{-1}$. observations ($&lt; 100$ days) ofstripped-envelope cc-sne have revealed a subclass of very energetic sne, termedbroad-lined sne (bl-sne) or hypernovae, which are characterised by broadabsorption lines in the early-time spectra, indicative of outer ejecta movingat very high velocity ($v \geq 0.1 c$). sne identified as bl in the early phaseshow large variations of core velocities at late phases, with some having muchhigher and some having similar velocities with respect to regular cc-sne. thismight indicate asphericity of the inner ejecta of bl-sne, a possibility weinvestigate using synthetic three-dimensional nebular spectra.

1006.4259	the type ic sn 2007gr: a census of the ejecta from late-time  optical-infrared spectra	nebular spectra of supernovae (sne) offer an unimpeded view of the innerregion of the ejecta, where most nucleosynthesis takes place. optical spectracover most, but not all of the emitting elements, and therefore offer only apartial view of the products of the explosion. simultaneous optical-infraredspectra, on the other hand, contain emission lines of all important elements,from c and o through to the intermediate mass elements (ime) mg, si, s, ca, andto fe and ni. in particular, si and s are best seen in the ir. the availabilityof ir data makes it possible to explore in greater detail the results of theexplosion. sn\,2007gr is the first type ic sn for which such data areavailable. modelling the spectra with a nlte code reveals that the inner ejectacontain $\sim 1 \msun$ of material within a velocity of $\approx 4500$\,\kms.%the spectrum is powered by \nifs, in an amount ($0.076 \msun$) consistent withthat %derived from the early-time data. the same mass of \nifs\ derived fromthe light curve peak ($0.076 \msun$) was used to power the spectrum, yieldingconsistent results. oxygen is the dominant element, contributing $\sim 0.8\msun$. the c/o ratio is $&lt; 0.2$. ime account for $\sim 0.1 \msun$. thisconfirms that sn\,2007gr was the explosion of a low-mass co core, probably theresult of a star of main-sequence mass $\approx 15 \msun$. the ratios of the\caii\ lines, and of those of \feii, are sensitive to the assumed degree ofclumping. in particular, the optical lines of [\feii] become stronger, relativeto the ir lines, for higher degrees of clumping.

1006.5888	an asymmetric explosion as the origin of spectral evolution diversity in  type ia supernovae	type ia supernovae (sne ia) form an observationally uniform class of stellarexplosions, in that more luminous objects have smaller decline-rates. thisone-parameter behavior allows sne ia to be calibrated as cosmological `standardcandles', and led to the discovery of an accelerating universe. recentinvestigations, however, have revealed that the true nature of sne ia is morecomplicated. theoretically, it has been suggested that the initialthermonuclear sparks are ignited at an offset from the centre of thewhite-dwarf (wd) progenitor, possibly as a result of convection before theexplosion. observationally, the diversity seen in the spectral evolution of sneia beyond the luminosity decline-rate relation is an unresolved issue. here wereport that the spectral diversity is a consequence of random directions fromwhich an asymmetric explosion is viewed. our findings suggest that the spectralevolution diversity is no longer a concern in using sne ia as cosmologicalstandard candles. furthermore, this indicates that ignition at an offset fromthe centre of is a generic feature of sne ia.

0708.3698	upper limit for circumstellar gas around the type ia sn 2000cx	the nature of the companion stars in type ia supernova (sne) progenitorsystems remains unclear. one possible way to discriminate between differentscenarios is the presence (or absence) of circumstellar material, the leftovers from the progenitor evolution that may be revealed by their interactionwith the sn. a new method to probe the circumstellar environment has beenexploited for the normal type ia sn 2006x, leading for the first time to thedirect detection of material which escaped the progenitor system. in this paperwe apply the same analysis to the peculiar type ia sn 2000cx, with the aim ofconstraining the properties of its progenitor system. using multi-epoch,high-resolution spectroscopy we have studied the spectral region where narrow,time-variable naid absorption features are expected in case circumstellarmaterial is present along the line of sight. no naid absorption is detected inthe rest-frame of the host galaxy to a level of a few ma, setting a stringentupper limit to the column density of the absorbing material (n(nai)&lt;=2 x 10^10cm-2). in this respect the peculiar type ia sn 2000cx is different from thenormal ia sn 2006x. whether this is to be attributed to a different progenitorsystem, to viewing-angle effects or to a low metallicity remains to beclarified.

1011.5665	high luminosity, slow ejecta and persistent carbon lines: sn 2009dc  challenges thermonuclear explosion scenarios	sn 2009dc shares similarities with normal type ia supernovae, but is clearlyoverluminous, with a (pseudo-bolometric) peak luminosity of log(l) = 43.47[erg/s]. its light curves decline slowly over half a year after maximum light,and the early-time near-ir light curves show secondary maxima, although theminima between the first and second peaks are not very pronounced. bluer bandsexhibit an enhanced fading after ~200 d, which might be caused by dustformation or an unexpectedly early ir catastrophe. the spectra of sn 2009dc aredominated by intermediate-mass elements and unburned material at early times,and by iron-group elements at late phases. strong c ii lines are present until~2 weeks past maximum, which is unprecedented in thermonuclear sne. the ejectavelocities are significantly lower than in normal and even subluminous sne ia.no signatures of csm interaction are found in the spectra. assuming that thelight curves are powered by radioactive decay, analytic modelling suggests thatsn 2009dc produced ~1.8 solar masses of 56ni assuming the smallest possiblerise time of 22 d. together with a derived total ejecta mass of ~2.8 solarmasses, this confirms that sn 2009dc is a member of the class of possiblesuper-chandrasekhar-mass sne ia similar to sne 2003fg, 2006gz and 2007if. astudy of the hosts of sn 2009dc and other superluminous sne ia reveals atendency of these sne to explode in low-mass galaxies. a low metallicity of theprogenitor may therefore be an important pre-requisite for producingsuperluminous sne ia. we discuss a number of explosion scenarios, ranging fromsuper-chandrasekhar-mass white-dwarf progenitors over dynamical white-dwarfmergers and type i 1/2 sne to a core-collapse origin of the explosion. none ofthe models seem capable of explaining all properties of sn 2009dc, so that thetrue nature of this sn and its peers remains nebulous.

1012.1466	a tale of two grb-sne at a common redshift of z = 0.54	we present ground-based and hst optical observations of the opticaltransients (ots) of long-duration gamma ray bursts (grbs) 060729 and 090618,both at a redshift of z = 0.54. for grb 060729, bumps are seen in the opticallight curves (lcs), and the late-time broadband spectral energy distributions(seds) of the ot resemble those of local type ic supernovae (sne). for grb090618, the dense sampling of our optical observations has allowed us to detectwell-defined bumps in the optical lcs, as well as a change in colour, that areindicative of light coming from a core-collapse sn. the accompanying sne forboth events are individually compared with sn1998bw, a known grb-supernova, andsn1994i, a typical type ic supernova without a known grb counterpart, and inboth cases the brightness and temporal evolution more closely resemblesn1998bw. we also exploit our extensive optical and radio data for grb 090618,as well as the publicly-available swift -xrt data, and discuss the propertiesof the afterglow at early times. in the context of a simple jet-like model, theafterglow of grb 090618 is best explained by the presence of a jet-break att-to &gt; 0.5 days. we then compare the rest-frame, peak v -band absolutemagnitudes of all of the grb and x-ray flash (xrf)-associated sne with a largesample of local type ibc sne, concluding that, when host extinction isconsidered, the peak magnitudes of the grb/xrf-sne cannot be distinguished fromthe peak magnitudes of non-grb/xrf sne.

1101.3935	effects of explosion asymmetry and viewing angle on the type ia  supernova color and luminosity calibration	phenomenological relations exist between the peak luminosity and otherobservables of type ia supernovae (sne~ia), that allow one to standardize theirpeak luminosities. however, several issues are yet to be clarified: sne~ia showcolor variations after the standardization. also, individual sne~ia can showresiduals in their standardized peak absolute magnitude at the level of $\sim0.15$ mag. in this paper, we explore how the color and luminosity residual arerelated to the wavelength shift of nebular emission lines observed at $\gsim150$ days after maximum light. a sample of 11 sne ia which likely suffer fromlittle host extinction indicates a correlation ($3.3\sigma$) between the peak$b-v$ color and the late-time emission-line shift. furthermore, a nearlyidentical relation applies for a larger sample in which only three sne with$b-v \gsim 0.2$ mag are excluded. following the interpretation that thelate-time emission-line shift is a tracer of the viewing direction from whichan off-centre explosion is observed, we suggest that the viewing direction is adominant factor controlling the sn color and that a large part of the colorvariations is intrinsic, rather than due to the host extinction. we alsoinvestigate a relation between the peak luminosity residuals and the wavelengthshift in nebular emission lines in a sample of 20 sne. we thereby found a hintof a correlation (at $\sim 1.6 \sigma$ level). the confirmation of this willrequire a future sample of sne with more accurate distance estimates. radiationtransfer simulations for a toy explosion model where different viewing anglescause the late-time emission-line shift are presented, predicting a strongcorrelation between the color and shift, and a weaker one for the luminosityresidual.

1105.3049	nero - a post maximum supernova radiation transport code	the interpretation of supernova (sn) spectra is essential for deriving snejecta properties such as density and composition, which in turn can tell usabout their progenitors and the explosion mechanism. a very large number ofatomic processes are important for spectrum formation. several tools forcalculating sn spectra exist, but they mainly focus on the very early or lateepochs. the intermediate phase, which requires a nlte treatment of radiationtransport has rarely been studied. in this paper we present a new sn radiationtransport code, nero, which can look at those epochs. all the atomic processesare treated in full nlte, under a steady-state assumption. this is a validapproach between roughly 50 and 500 days after the explosion depending on sntype. this covers the post-maximum photospheric and the early and theintermediate nebular phase. as a test, we compare nero to the radiationtransport code of jerkstrand et al. (2011) and to the nebular code of mazzaliet al. (2001). all three codes have been developed independently and acomparison provides a valuable opportunity to investigate their reliability.currently, nero is one-dimensional and can be used for predicting spectra ofsynthetic explosion models or for deriving sn properties by spectral modelling.to demonstrate this, we study the spectra of the 'normal' sn ia 2005cf between50 and 350 days after the explosion and identify most of the common sn ia linefeatures at post maximum epochs.

1302.2926	spectroscopic observations of sn 2012fr: a luminous normal type ia  supernova with early high velocity features and late velocity plateau	we present 65 optical spectra of the type ia supernova sn 2012fr, of which 33were obtained before maximum light. at early times sn 2012fr shows clearevidence of a high-velocity feature (hvf) in the si ii 6355 line which can becleanly decoupled from the lower velocity "photospheric" component. this si ii6355 hvf fades by phase -5; subsequently, the photospheric component exhibits avery narrow velocity width and remains at a nearly constant velocity ofv~12,000 km/s until at least 5 weeks after maximum brightness. the ca iiinfrared (ir) triplet exhibits similar evidence for both a photosphericcomponent at v~12,000 km/s with narrow line width and long velocity plateau, aswell as a high-velocity component beginning at v~31,000 km/s two weeks beforemaximum. sn 2012fr resides on the border between the "shallow silicon" and"core-normal" subclasses in the branch et al.

0712.3290	swift and chandra detections of supernova 2006jc: evidence for  interaction of the supernova shock with a circumstellar shell	the peculiar type ib supernova (sn) 2006jc has been observed with theuv/optical telescope (uvot) and x-ray telescope (xrt) on board the swiftobservatory over a period of 19 to 183 days after the explosion. signatures ofinteraction of the outgoing sn shock with dense circumstellar material (csm)are detected, such as strong x-ray emission (l_{0.2-10} &gt; e39 erg/s) and thepresence of mgii 2800a line emission visible in the uv spectra. in combinationwith a chandra observation obtained on day 40 after the explosion, the x-raylight curve is constructed, which shows a unique rise of the x-ray emission bya factor of ~5 over a period of ~4 months, followed by a rapid decline. weinterpret the unique x-ray and uv properties as a result of the sn shockinteracting with a shell of material that was deposited by an outburst of thesn progenitor two years prior to the explosion. our results are consistent withthe explosion of a wolf-rayet star that underwent an episodic mass ejectionqualitatively similar to those of luminous blue variable stars prior to itsexplosion. this led to the formation of a dense (&gt;e7 cm**-3) shell at adistance of ~e16 cm from the site of the explosion, which expands with the wrwind at a velocity of (1300+/-300) km/s.

1306.2337	the fast and furious decay of the peculiar type ic supernova 2005ek	we present extensive multi-wavelength observations of the extremely rapidlydeclining type ic supernova, sn 2005ek. reaching a peak magnitude of m_r =-17.3 and decaying by ~3 mag in the first 15 days post-maximum, sn 2005ek isamong the fastest type i supernovae observed to date. the spectra of sn 2005ekclosely resemble those of normal sn ic, but with an accelerated evolution.there is evidence for the onset of nebular features at only nine dayspost-maximum. spectroscopic modeling reveals an ejecta mass of ~0.3 msun thatis dominated by oxygen (~80%), while the pseudo-bolometric light curve isconsistent with an explosion powered by ~0.03 msun of radioactive ni-56.although previous rapidly evolving events (e.g., sn 1885a, sn 1939b, sn 2002bj,sn 2010x) were hypothesized to be produced by the detonation of a helium shellon a white dwarf, oxygen-dominated ejecta are difficult to reconcile with thisproposed mechanism. we find that the properties of sn 2005ek are consistentwith either the edge-lit double detonation of a low-mass white dwarf or theiron-core collapse of a massive star, stripped by binary interaction. however,if we assume that the strong spectroscopic similarity of sn 2005ek to other snic is an indication of a similar progenitor channel, then a white-dwarfprogenitor becomes very improbable. sn 2005ek may be one of the lowest massstripped-envelope core-collapse explosions ever observed. we find that the rateof such rapidly declining type i events is at least 1-3% of the normal sn iarate.

1311.3645	multi-epoch high-spectral-resolution observations of neutral sodium in  14 type ia supernovae	one of the main questions concerning type ia supernovae is the nature of thebinary companion of the exploding white dwarf. a major discriminant betweendifferent suggested models is the presence and physical properties ofcircumstellar material at the time of explosion. if present, this material willbe ionized by the ultra-violet radiation of the explosion and later recombine.this ionization-recombination should manifest itself as time-variableabsorption features that can be detected via multi-epochhigh-spectral-resolution observations. previous studies have shown that thestrongest effect is seen in the neutral sodium d lines. we report onobservations of neutral sodium absorption features observed in multi-epochhigh-resolution spectra of 14 type ia supernova events. this is the firstmulti-epoch high-resolution study to include multiple sne. no variability inline strength that can be associated with circumstellar material is detected.we find that ~18% of the events in the extended sample exhibit time-variablesodium features associated with circumstellar material. we explore theimplication of this study on our understanding of the progenitor systems oftype ia supernovae via the current type ia supernova multi-epochhigh-spectral-resolution sample.

1401.2368	sn2011hs: a fast and faint type iib supernova from a supergiant  progenitor	observations spanning a large wavelength range, from x-ray to radio, of thetype iib supernova 2011hs are presented, covering its evolution during thefirst year after explosion. the optical light curve presents a narrower shapeand a fainter luminosity at peak than previously observed for type iib sne.high expansion velocities are measured from the broad absorption h i and he ilines. from the comparison of the bolometric light curve and the time evolutionof the photospheric velocities with hydrodynamical models, we found that sn2011hs is consistent with the explosion of a 3-4 msun he-core progenitor star,corresponding to a main sequence mass of 12-15 msun, that ejected a mass of56ni of about 0.04 msun, with an energy of e= 8.5 x 10^50 erg. such a low-massprogenitor scenario is in full agreement with the modelling of the nebularspectrum taken at $\sim$215 days from maximum. from the modelling of theadiabatic cooling phase, we infer a progenitor radius of $\approx$500-600 rsun,clearly pointing to an extended progenitor star. the radio light curve of sn2011hs yields a peak luminosity similar to that of sn 1993j, but with a highermass loss rate and a wind density possibly more similar to that of sn 2001ig.although no significant deviations from a smooth decline have been found in theradio light curves, we cannot rule out the presence of a binary companion star.

1404.6654	diversity of grb energetics vs. sn homogeneity: supernova 2013cq  associated with the gamma-ray burst 130427a	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been found to be associated withbroad-lined type-ic supernovae (sne), but only a handful of cases have beenstudied in detail. prompted by the discovery of the exceptionally bright,nearby grb130427a (redshift z=0.3399), we aim at characterising the propertiesof its associated sn2013cq. this is the first opportunity to test directly theprogenitors of high-luminosity grbs. we monitored the field of the swift longduration grb130427a using the 3.6-m tng and the 8.2-m vlt during the timeinterval between 3.6 and 51.6 days after the burst. photometric andspectroscopic observations revealed the presence of the type ic sn2013cq.spectroscopic analysis suggests that sn2013cq resembles two previous grb-sne,sn1998bw and sn2010bh associated with grb980425 and xrf100316d, respectively.the bolometric light curve of sn2013cq, which is significantly affected by thehost galaxy contribution, is systematically more luminous than that of sn2010bh($\sim$ 2 mag at peak), but is consistent with sn1998bw. the comparison withthe light curve model of another grb-connected sn2003dh, indicates thatsn2013cq is consistent with the model when brightened by 20%. this suggests asynthesised radioactive $^{56}$ni mass of $\sim 0.4 m_\odot$.grb130427a/sn2013cq is the first case of low-z grb-sn connection where the grbenergetics are extreme ($e_{\rm \gamma, iso} \sim 10^{54}$ erg). we show thatthe maximum luminosities attained by sne associated with grbs span a verynarrow range, but those associated with xrfs are significantly less luminous.on the other hand the isotropic energies of the accompanying grbs span 6 ordersof magnitude (10$^{48}$ erg $&lt; e_{\rm \gamma, iso} &lt;$ 10$^{54}$ erg), althoughthis range is reduced when corrected for jet collimation. the grb totalradiated energy is in fact a small fraction of the sn energy budget.

1405.5237	optical follow-up observations of ptf10qts, a luminous broad-lined type  ic supernova found by the palomar transient factory	we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the broad-lined type icsupernova (snic-bl) ptf10qts, which was discovered as part of the palomartransient factory. the supernova was located in a dwarf galaxy of magnitude$r=21.1$ at a redshift $z=0.0907$. we find that the $r$-band light curve is apoor proxy for bolometric data and use photometric and spectroscopic data toconstruct and constrain the bolometric light curve. the derived bolometricmagnitude at maximum light is $m_{\rm bol} = -18.51\pm0.2$ mag, comparable tothat of sn 1998bw ($m_{\rm bol} = -18.7$ mag) which was associated with agamma-ray burst (grb). ptf10qts is one of the most luminous snic-bl observedwithout an accompanying grb. we estimate the physical parameters of theexplosion using data from our programme of follow-up observations, finding thatit produced a larger mass of radioactive nickel compared to other sneic-bl withsimilar inferred ejecta masses and kinetic energies. the progenitor of theevent was likely a $\sim20$m$_{\odot}$ star.

0803.1383	abundance stratification in type ia supernovae - ii: the rapidly  declining, spectroscopically normal sn 2004eo	the variation of properties of type ia supernovae, the thermonuclearexplosions of chandrasekhar-mass carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, is caused bydifferent nucleosynthetic outcomes of these explosions, which can be tracedfrom the distribution of abundances in the ejecta. the compositionstratification of the spectroscopically normal but rapidly declining sn2004eois studied performing spectrum synthesis of a time-series of spectra obtainedbefore and after maximum, and of one nebular spectrum obtained about eightmonths later. early-time spectra indicate that the outer ejecta are dominatedby oxygen and silicon, and contain other intermediate-mass elements (ime),implying that the outer part of the star was subject only to partial burning.in the inner part, nuclear statistical equilibrium (nse) material dominates,but the production of 56ni was limited to ~0.43 \pm 0.05 msun. an innermostzone containing ~0.25 msun of stable fe-group material is also present. therelatively small amount of nse material synthesised by sn2004eo explains boththe dimness and the rapidly evolving light curve of this sn.

1410.0091	type ia supernova spectral features in the context of their host galaxy  properties	we analyse spectroscopic measurements of 122 type ia supernovae (sne ia) withz&lt;0.09 discovered by the palomar transient factory, focusing on the propertiesof the si ii 6355 and ca ii `near-infrared triplet' absorptions. we examine thevelocities of the photospheric si ii 6355, and the velocities and strengths ofthe photospheric and high-velocity ca ii, in the context of the stellar mass(mstellar) and star-formation rate (sfr) of the sn host galaxies, as well asthe position of the sn within its host. we find that sne ia with faster si ii6355 tend to explode in more massive galaxies, with the highest velocity eventsonly occuring in galaxies with mstellar &gt; 3*10^9 solar mass. we also find someevidence that these highest velocity sne ia explode in the inner regions oftheir host galaxies, similar to the study of wang et al. (2013), although thetrend is not as significant in our data. we show that these trends areconsistent with some sn ia spectral models, if the host galaxy stellar mass isinterpreted as a proxy for host galaxy metallicity. we study the strength ofthe high-velocity component of the ca ii near-ir absorption, and show that sneia with stronger high-velocity components relative to photospheric componentsare hosted by galaxies with low stellar mass, blue colour, and a high ssfr.such sne are therefore likely to arise from the youngest progenitor systems.this argues against a pure orientation effect being responsible forhigh-velocity features in sn ia spectra and, when combined with other studies,is consistent with a scenario where high-velocity features are related to aninteraction between the sn ejecta and circumstellar medium (csm) local to thesn.

1411.4424	a metric space for type ia supernova spectra	we develop a new framework for use in exploring type ia supernova (sn ia)spectra. combining principal component analysis (pca) and partial least squareanalysis (pls) we are able to establish correlations between the principalcomponents (pcs) and spectroscopic/photometric sne ia features. the techniquewas applied to ~120 supernova and ~800 spectra from the nearby supernovafactory. the ability of pca to group together sne ia with similar spectralfeatures, already explored in previous studies, is greatly enhanced by twoimportant modifications: (1) the initial data matrix is built using derivativesof spectra over the wavelength, which increases the weight of weak lines anddiscards extinction, and (2) we extract time evolution information through theuse of entire spectral sequences concatenated in each line of the input datamatrix. these allow us to define a stable pc parameter space which can be usedto characterize synthetic sn ia spectra by means of real sn features. usingpls, we demonstrate that the information from important previously knownspectral indicators (namely the pseudo-equivalent width (pew) of si ii 5972 /si ii 6355 and the line velocity of s ii 5640 / si ii 6355) at a given epoch,is contained within the pc space and can be determined through a linearcombination of the most important pcs. we also show that the pc spaceencompasses photometric features like b or v magnitudes, b-v color and salt2parameters c and x1. the observed colors and magnitudes, that are heavilyaffected by extinction, cannot be reconstructed using this technique alone. allthe above mentioned applications allowed us to construct a metric space forcomparing synthetic sn ia spectra with observations.

1504.04857	nebular spectra and abundance tomography of the type ia supernova sn  2011fe: a normal sn ia with a stable fe core	a series of optical and one near-infrared nebular spectra covering the firstyear of the type ia supernova sn 2011fe are presented and modelled. the densityprofile that proved best for the early optical/ultraviolet spectra, "rho-11fe",was extended to lower velocities to include the regions that emit at nebularepochs. model rho-11fe is intermediate between the fast deflagration model w7and a low-energy delayed-detonation. good fits to the nebular spectra areobtained if the innermost ejecta are dominated by neutron-rich, stable fe-groupspecies, which contribute to cooling but not to heating. the correct thermalbalance can thus be reached for the strongest [feii] and [feiii] lines to bereproduced with the observed ratio. the 56ni mass thus obtained is 0.47 +/-0.05 mo. the bulk of 56ni has an outermost velocity of ~8500 km/s. the mass ofstable iron is 0.23 +/- 0.03 mo. stable ni has low abundance, ~10^{-2} mo. thisis sufficient to reproduce an observed emission line near 7400 a. asub-chandrasekhar explosion model with mass 1.02 mo and no central stable fedoes not reproduce the observed line ratios. a mock model where neutron-richfe-group species are located above 56ni following recent suggestions is alsoshown to yield spectra that are less compatible with the observations. thedensities and abundances in the inner layers obtained from the nebularanalysis, combined with those of the outer layers previously obtained, are usedto compute a synthetic bolometric light curve, which compares favourably withthe light curve of sn 2011fe.

1509.09069	massive stars exploding in a he-rich circumstellar medium - ix. sn  2014av, and characterization of type ibn sne	we present spectroscopic and photometric data of the type ibn supernova (sn)2014av, discovered by the xingming observatory sky survey. stringentpre-discovery detection limits indicate that the object was detected for thefirst time about 4 days after the explosion. a prompt follow-up campaignarranged by amateur astronomers allowed us to monitor the rising phase (lasting10.6 days) and to accurately estimate the epoch of the maximum light, on 2014april 23 (jd = 2456771.1 +/- 1.2). the absolute magnitude of the sn at themaximum light is m(r) = -19.76 +/- 0.16. the post-peak light curve shows aninitial fast decline lasting about 3 weeks, and is followed by a slower declinein all bands until the end of the monitoring campaign. the spectra areinitially characterized by a hot continuum. later on, the temperature declinesand a number of lines become prominent mostly in emission. in particular, laterspectra are dominated by strong and narrow emission features of he i typical oftype ibn supernovae (sne), although there is a clear signature of lines fromheavier elements (in particular o i, mg ii and ca ii). a forest of relativelynarrow fe ii lines is also detected showing p-cygni profiles, with theabsorption component blue-shifted by about 1200 km/s. another spectral featureoften observed in interacting sne, a strong blue pseudo-continuum, is seen inour latest spectra of sn 2014av. we discuss in this paper the physicalparameters of sn 2014av in the context of the type ibn supernova variety.

1512.01303	radio observations of a sample of broad-lined type ic supernovae  discovered by ptf/iptf: a search for relativistic explosions	long duration gamma-ray bursts are thought to be a rare subclass ofstripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae that launch collimated relativisticoutflows (jets). all gamma-ray-burst-associated supernovae arespectroscopically of type ic with broad lines, but the fraction of broad-linedtype ic supernovae harboring low-luminosity gamma-ray-bursts remains largelyunconstrained. some supernovae should be accompanied by off-axis gamma-rayburst jets that remain invisible initially, but then emerge as strong radiosources (as the jets decelerate). however, this critical prediction of the jetmodel for gamma-ray bursts has yet to be verified observationally. here, wepresent k. g. jansky very large array radio observations of 15 broad-linedsupernovae of type ic discovered by the palomar transient factory in anuntargeted manner. most of the supernovae in our sample exclude radio emissionobservationally similar to that of the radio-loud, relativistic sn 1998bw. wethus constrain the fraction of 1998bw-like broad-lined type ic supernovae to be&lt;= 14%. most of the events in our sample also exclude off-axis jets similar togrb 031203 and grb 030329, but we cannot rule out off-axis gamma-ray-burstsexpanding in a low-density wind environment. three supernovae show late-timeradio emission compatible with average speeds &gt;~ 0.3c, on the dividing linebetween relativistic and "ordinary" supernovae. based on these detections, weestimate that &lt;= 45% of the broad-lined type ic supernovae in our sample mayharbor off-axis gamma-ray-bursts expanding in media with densities in the rangeprobed by this study.

astro-ph;0009065	the template type ia supernova 1996x	ubvrij photometry and optical spectra of the type ia sn 1996x obtained at esoduring a one-year-long observational campaign are presented, and supplementedby late time hst photometry. spectroscopically, sn 1996x appears to be a`normal' sn ia. the apparent magnitude at maximum was b=13.24 +/- 0.02, and thecolour b-v=0.00 +/- 0.03. the luminosity decline rate, delta m_b(15) = 1.31 +/-0.08, is close to average for a sn ia. the best estimate of the galacticextinction is a_b=0.30 +/- 0.05, and there is evidence that reddening withinthe parent galaxy is negligible. detailed comparison of the light and colourcurves of various `normal' sne ia shows that the assumption that multicolourlight curves can be described simply as a one-parameter family is not perfect.together with problems in the calibration of the templates, this may explainthe discrepancies in the distance modulus derived adopting differentcalibrations of the absolute magnitude vs. light curve shape relations. indeedwe found that m_b ranges from -19.08 to -19.48 and m-m range from 32.02 to32.48 depending on the method used (hamuy et al. 1996a,phillips et al. 1999,riess et al. 1998a). computations of model light curve and synthetic spectrafor both early- and late-times, confirm that 1996x is a normal type ia sn andthat a satisfactory fit can be obtained using a w7 progenitor structure only ifwe adopt the short distance. a larger distance would imply a too large ni massfor this fainter than average snia.

astro-ph;0201483	the type iin sn 1995g: interaction with the csm	we present the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of the type iin sn1995g in ngc 1643, on the basis of 4 years of optical and infraredobservations. this supernova shows very flat optical light curves similar to sn1988z, with a slow decline rate at all times. the spectra are characterized bystrong balmer lines with multiple components in emission and with a p-cygniabsorption component blueshifted by only 700 km/s. this feature indicates thepresence of a slowly expanding shell above the sn ejecta as in the case of sne1994aj and 1996l. as in other sne iin the slow luminosity decline cannot beexplained only with a radioactive energy input and an additional source ofenergy is required, most likely that produced by the interaction betweensupernova ejecta and a pre--existent circumstellar medium. it was estimatedthat the shell material has a density n(h) &gt;&gt; 10^8 cm^-3, consistent with theabsence of forbidden lines in the spectra. about 2 years after the burst thelow velocity shell is largely overtaken by the sn ejecta and the luminositydrops at a faster rate.

astro-ph;0208470	early-phase spectra of "hypernova" sn 2002ap	the spectral evolution of the peculiar sn ic 2002ap during the first 40 daysis presented. the spectra display very broad absorption features, which aretypical of "hypernovae". the maximum expansion velocity measured on theearliest spectra exceeds 3 times 10^4 km s^{-1}. the spectrum of sn 2002ap atthe epoch of maximum brightness resembles that of sn 1997ef more than that ofsn 1998bw. the spectral evolution of sn 2002ap proceeds at about 1.5 times therate of sn 1997ef. the parameterized supernova spectrum synthesis code synowwas used to perform line identification and deduce velocity information fromthe early-phase spectra, which are heavily affected by line blending. thephotospheric velocity, as deduced from the fitting results and from theblueshift of the \ion{si}{2} lambda 6355 absorption minimum, is lower than inpreviously studied hypernovae. at advanced epochs, the \ion{si}{2} lambda 6355absorption minimum becomes difficult to distinguish. this may be caused by thegrowth of [\ion{o}{1}] lambda lambda 6300, 6364 emission. together with therapid spectral evolution, this suggests that sn 2002ap should enter the nebularphase sooner than previously studied hypernovae.

astro-ph;0304010	the optical/near-infrared light curves of sn 2002ap for the first 140  days after discovery	supernova (sn) 2002ap in m74 was observed in the $ubvrijhk$ bands for thefirst 40 days following its discovery (2002 january 29) until it disappearedbecause of solar conjunction, and then in june after it reappeared. themagnitudes and dates of peak brightness in each band were determined. while therate of increase of the brightness before the peak is almost independent ofwavelength, the subsequent rate of decrease becomes smaller with wavelengthfrom the $u$ to the $r$ band, and is constant at wavelengths beyond $i$. thephotometric evolution is faster than in the well-known ``hypernovae''sne~1998bw and 1997ef, indicating that sn 2002ap ejected less mass. thebolometric light curve of sn 2002ap for the full period of observations wasconstructed. the absolute magnitude is found to be much fainter than that of sn1998bw, but is similar to that of sn 1997ef, which lies at the faint end of thehypernova population. the bolometric light curve at the early epochs was bestreproduced with the explosion of a c+o star that ejects $2.5~m_\sun$ withkinetic energy $e_{\rm k}=4\times 10^{51}~{\rm ergs}$. a comparison of thepredicted brightness of sn 2002ap with that observed after solar conjunctionmay imply that $\gamma$-ray deposition at the later epochs was more efficientthan in the model. this may be due to an asymmetric explosion.

astro-ph;0305182	a two-component model for the light curves of hypernovae	the light curves of 'hypernovae', i.e. very energetic supernovae with $e_{51}\equiv e/10^{51}$ergs $\gsim 5-10$ are characterized at epochs of a few monthsby a phase of linear decline. classical, one-dimensional explosion models failto simultaneously reproduce the light curve near peak and at the linear declinephase. the evolution of these light curves may however be explained by a simplemodel consisting of two concentric components. the outer component isresponsible for the early part of the light curve and for the broad absorptionfeatures observed in the early spectra of hypernovae, similar to theone-dimensional models. in addition, a very dense inner component is added,which reproduces the linear decline phase in the observed magnitude-versus-timerelation for sne 1998bw, 1997ef, and 2002ap. this simple approach does containone of the main features of jet-driven, asymmetric explosion models, namely thepresence of a dense core. although the total masses and energies derived withthe two-component model are similar to those obtained in previous studies whichalso adopted spherical symmetry, this study suggests that the ejecta areaspherical, and thus the real energies and masses may deviate from thosederived assuming spherical symmetry. the supernovae which were modeled aredivided into two groups, according to the prominence of the inner component:the inner component of sn 1997ef is denser and more $^{56}$ni-rich, relative tothe outer component, than the corresponding inner components of sne 1998bw and2002ap. these latter objects have a similar inner-to-outer component ratio,although they have very different global values of mass and energy.

astro-ph;0411566	high velocity features in the spectra of the type ia sn 1999ee: a  property of the explosion or evidence of circumstellar interaction?	the near-maximum spectra of the type ia sn 1999ee are reviewed. two narrowabsorption features corresponding to the strongest component of the caii irtriplet appear in the spectra from 7 days before to 2 days after b-bandmaximum, at a high velocity (~22,000 km/s). before these features emerge, thecaii ir triplet has an anomalously high velocity, indicating that the narrowfeatures were still blended with the main, photospheric component.high-velocity caii absorption has been observed in other sne ia, but usuallydetached from the photospheric component. furthermore, the siii 6355a line isobserved at a comparably high velocity (~20,000 km/s) 9 and 7 days before bmaximum, but then it suddenly shifts to much lower velocities. syntheticspectra are used to reproduce the data under various scenarios. an abundanceenhancement requires an outer region dominated by si and ca, the origin ofwhich is not easy to explain in terms of nuclear burning. a density enhancementleads to a good reproduction of the spectral evolution if a mass of ~0.10 msunis added at velocities between 16,000 and 28,000 km/s, and it may result from aperturbation, possibly angular, of the explosion. an improved match to the caiiir triplet at the earliest epoch can be obtained if the outermost part of thismodified density profile is assumed to be dominated by h (~0.004 msun above24,000 km/s). line broadening is then the result of increased electronscattering. this h may be the result of interaction between the ejecta andcircumstellar material.

astro-ph;0502531	high-velocity features: a ubiquitous property of type ia sne	evidence of high-velocity features such as those seen in the near-maximumspectra of some type ia supernovae (eg sn 2000cx) has been searched for in theavailable snia spectra observed earlier than one week before b maximum. recentobservational efforts have doubled the number of sneia with very early spectra.remarkably, all sneia with early data (7 in our rtn sample and 10 from otherprogrammes) show signs of such features, to a greater or lesser degree, in caiiir, and some also in siii 6255a line. high-velocity features may be interpretedas abundance or density enhancements. abundance enhancements would imply anouter region dominated by si and ca. density enhancements may result from thesweeping up of circumstellar material by the highest velocity sn ejecta. inthis scenario, the high incidence of hvfs suggests that a thick disc and/or ahigh-density companion wind surrounds the exploding white dwarf, as may be thecase in single degenerate systems. large-scale angular fluctuations in theradial density and abundance distribution may also be responsible: this couldoriginate in the explosion, and would suggest a deflagration as the more likelyexplosion mechanism. csm-interaction and surface fluctuations may coexist,possibly leaving different signatures on the spectrum. in some sne the hvfs arenarrowly confined in velocity, suggesting the ejection of blobs of burnedmaterial.

astro-ph;0509722	off-axis properties of short gamma-ray bursts	based on recent models of relativistic jet formation by thermal energydeposition around black hole-torus systems, the relation between the on- andoff-axis appearance of short, hard gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is discussed interms of energetics, duration, average lorentz factor, and probability ofobservation, assuming that the central engines are remnants of binary neutronstar or neutron star-black hole mergers. as a consequence of the interactionwith the torus matter at the jet basis and the subsequent expansion of the jetsinto an extremely low-density environment, the collimated ultrarelativisticoutflows possess flat core profiles with only little variation ofradially-averaged properties, and are bounded by very steep lateral edges.owing to the rapid decrease of the isotropic-equivalent energy near the jetedges, the probability of observing the lateral, lower lorentz factor wings issignificantly reduced and most short grbs should be seen with on-axis-likeproperties. taking into account cosmological and viewing angle effects,theoretical predictions are made for the short-grb distributions with redshiftz, fluence, and isotropic-equivalent energy. the observational data for shortbursts with determined redshifts are found to be compatible with thepredictions only if either the intrinsic grb rate density drops rapidly at z&gt;1,or a large number of events at z&gt;1 are missed, implying that the subenergeticgrb 050509b was an extremely rare low-fluence event with detectable photon fluxonly because of its proximity and shortness. it appears unlikely that grb050509b can be explained as an off-axis event. the detection of short grbs withsmall lorentz factors is statistically disfavored, suggesting a possible reasonfor the absence of soft short bursts in the duration-hardness diagram.

astro-ph;0511389	optical emission from aspherical supernovae and the hypernova sn 1998bw	a fully 3d monte carlo scheme is applied to compute optical bolometric lightcurves for aspherical (jet-like) supernova explosion models. density andabundance distributions are taken from hydrodynamic explosion models, with theenergy varied as a parameter to explore the dependence. our models showinitially a very large degree ($\sim 4$ depending on model parameters) ofboosting luminosity toward the polar ($z$) direction relative to the equatorial($r$) plane, which decreases as the time of peak is approached. after the peak,the factor of the luminosity boost remains almost constant ($\sim 1.2$) untilthe supernova enters the nebular phase. this behavior is due mostly to theaspherical $^{56}$ni distribution in the earlier phase and to the disk-likeinner low-velocity structure in the later phase. also the aspherical modelsyield an earlier peak date than the spherical models, especially if viewed fromnear the z-axis. aspherical models with ejecta mass $\sim 10\msun$ areexamined, and one with the kinetic energy of the expansion $\sim 2 \pm 0.5\times 10^{52}$ ergs and a mass of $^{56}$ni $\sim 0.4\msun$ yields a lightcurve in agreement with the observed light curve of sn 1998bw (the prototypicalhyper-energetic supernova). the aspherical model is also at least qualitativelyconsistent with evolution of photospheric velocities, showing large velocitiesnear the z-axis, and with a late-phase nebular spectrum. the viewing angle isclose to the z-axis, strengthening the case for the association of sn 1998bwwith the gamma ray burst grb980425.

astro-ph;0604293	the properties of the "standard" type ic supernova 1994i from spectral  models	the properties of the type ic supernova sn 1994i are re-investigated. thisobject is often referred to as a "standard sn ic" although it exhibited anextremely fast light curve and unusually blue early-time spectra. in addition,the observations were affected by significant dust extinction. a series ofspectral models are computed based on the explosion model co21 (iwamoto et al.1994) using a monte carlo transport spectral synthesis code. overall thedensity structure and abundances of the explosion model are able to reproducethe photospheric spectra well. reddening is estimated to be e(b-v)=0.30 mag, alower value than previously proposed. a model of the nebular spectrum of sn1994i points toward a slightly larger ejecta mass than that of co21. thephotospheric spectra show a large abundance of iron-group elements at earlyepochs, indicating that mixing within the ejecta must have been significant. wepresent an improved light curve model which also requires the presence of 56niin the outer layers of the ejecta.

astro-ph;0702351	a common explosion mechanism for type ia supernovae	type ia supernovae, the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf starscomposed of carbon and oxygen, were instrumental as distance indicators inestablishing the acceleration of the universe's expansion. however, the physicsof the explosion are debated. here we report a systematic spectral analysis ofa large sample of well observed type ia supernovae. mapping the velocitydistribution of the main products of nuclear burning, we constrain theoreticalscenarios. we find that all supernovae have low-velocity cores of stableiron-group elements. outside this core, nickel-56 dominates the supernovaejecta. the outer extent of the iron-group material depends on the amount ofnickel-56 and coincides with the inner extent of silicon, the principal productof incomplete burning. the outer extent of the bulk of silicon is similar inall sne, having an expansion velocity of ~11000 km/s and corresponding to amass of slightly over one solar mass. this indicates that all the supernovaeconsidered here burned similar masses, and suggests that their progenitors hadthe same mass. synthetic light curve parameters and three-dimensional explosionsimulations support this interpretation. a single explosion scenario, possiblya delayed detonation, may thus explain most type ia supernovae.
