0902.1166	the dynamical effects of white dwarf birth kicks in globular star  clusters	recent observations of the white dwarf (wd) populations in the galacticglobular cluster ngc 6397 suggest that wds receive a kick of a few km/s shortlybefore they are born. using our monte carlo cluster evolution code, whichincludes accurate treatments of all relevant physical processes operating inglobular clusters, we study the effects of the kicks on their host cluster andon the wd population itself. we find that in clusters whose velocity dispersionis comparable to the kick speed, wd kicks are a significant energy source forthe cluster, prolonging the initial cluster core contraction phasesignificantly so that at late times the cluster core to half-mass radius ratiois a factor of up to ~ 10 larger than in the no-kick case. wd kicks thusrepresent a possible resolution of the large discrepancy between observed andtheoretically predicted values of this key structural parameter. our modelingalso reproduces the observed trend for younger wds to be more extended in theirradial distribution in the cluster than older wds.

0903.2660	unstable planetary systems emerging out of gas disks	the discovery of over 400 extrasolar planets allows us to statistically testour understanding of formation and dynamics of planetary systems via numericalsimulations. traditional n-body simulations of multiple-planet systems withoutgas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of theobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closelypacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstablewithin the stellar lifetime. however, such studies cannot explain the smallsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, asthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.  in this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems indissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce theobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. weadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planetformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planetmigration by using a hybrid n-body and 1d gas disk code. we also take accountof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotationresonances on the evolution of planetary systems. we find that the semi-majoraxis distribution is largely determined in a gas disk, while the eccentricitydistribution is determined after the disk dissipation. we also find that theremay be an optimum disk mass which leads to the observed a-e distribution. oursimulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped inmean-motion resonances (mmrs) than the observations, indicating that the disk'sperturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observedrate of mmrs. we also find much lower occurrence of planets on retrogradeorbits than the current observations of close-in planets suggest.

0910.5293	monte carlo simulations of globular cluster evolution. vi. the influence  of an intermediate mass black hole	we present results of a series of monte carlo simulations investigating theimprint of a central intermediate-mass black hole (imbh) on the structure of aglobular cluster. we investigate the three-dimensional and projected densityprofiles, and stellar disruption rates for idealized as well as realisticcluster models, taking into account a stellar mass spectrum and stellarevolution, and allowing for a larger, more realistic, number of stars than waspreviously possible with direct n-body methods. we compare our results to othern-body and fokker-planck simulations published previously. we find, in general,very good agreement for the overall cluster structure and dynamical evolutionbetween direct n-body simulations and our monte carlo simulations. significantdifferences exist in the number of stars that are tidally disrupted by theimbh, which is most likely an effect of the wandering motion of the imbh, notincluded in the monte carlo scheme. these differences, however, are negligiblefor the final imbh masses in realistic cluster models as the disruption ratesare generally much lower than for single-mass clusters. as a direct comparisonto observations we construct a detailed model for the cluster ngc 5694, whichis known to possess a central surface brightness cusp consistent with thepresence of an imbh. we find that not only the inner slope but also the outerpart of the surface brightness profile agree well with observations. however,there is only a slight preference for models harboring an imbh compared tomodels without.

0911.1483	on the dynamical evolution of the arches cluster	we study the dynamical evolution of the young star cluster arches and itsdependence on the assumed initial stellar mass function (imf). we perform manydirect $n$-body simulations with various initial conditions and two differentchoices of imfs. one is a standard kroupa imf without any mass segregation. theother is a radially dependent imf, as presently observed in the arches. we findthat it is unlikely for the arches to have attained the observed degree of masssegregation at its current age starting from a standard non-segregated kroupaimf. we also study the possibility of a collisional runaway developing in thefirst $\sim 2-3 \rm{myr}$ of dynamical evolution. we find that the evolution ofthis cluster is dramatically different depending on the choice of imf: if aprimordially mass segregated imf is chosen, a collisional runaway should alwaysoccur between $2-3 \rm{myr}$ for a broad range of initial concentrations. incontrast, for a standard kroupa imf no collisional runaway is predicted. weargue that if arches was created with a mass segregated imf similar to what isobserved today then at the current cluster age a very unusual, high-mass starshould be created. however, whether a collisional runaway leads to theformation of an intermediate-mass black hole (imbh) depends strongly on themass loss rate via winds from massive stars. growth of stellar mass throughcollisions can be quenched by strong wind mass loss. in that case, theinter-cluster as well as intra-cluster medium are expected to have asignificant helium enrichment which may be observed via helium recombinationlines. the excess amount of gas lost in winds may also be observed via x-rayobservations as diffused x-ray sources.

0912.4682	monte carlo simulations of globular cluster evolution. v. binary stellar  evolution	we study the dynamical evolution of globular clusters containing primordialbinaries, including full single and binary stellar evolution using our montecarlo cluster evolution code updated with an adaptation of the single andbinary stellar evolution codes sse/bse from hurley et. al (2000, 2002). wedescribe the modifications we have made to the code. we present several testcalculations and comparisons with existing studies to illustrate the validityof the code. we show that our code finds very good agreement with direct n-bodysimulations including primordial binaries and stellar evolution. we findsignificant differences in the evolution of the global properties of thesimulated clusters using stellar evolution compared to simulations without anystellar evolution. in particular, we find that the mass loss from stellarevolution acts as a significant energy production channel simply by reducingthe total gravitational binding energy and can significantly prolong theinitial core contraction phase before reaching the binary-burning quasi steadystate of the cluster evolution as noticed in paper iv. we simulate a large gridof clusters varying the initial cluster mass, binary fraction, andconcentration and compare properties of the simulated clusters with those ofthe observed galactic globular clusters (ggcs). we find that our simulatedcluster properties agree well with the observed ggc properties. we explore insome detail qualitatively different clusters in different phases of theirevolution, and construct synthetic hertzprung-russell diagrams for theseclusters.

1007.4785	tidal evolution of close-in planets	recent discoveries of several transiting planets with clearly non-zeroeccentricities and some large inclinations started changing the simple pictureof close-in planets having circular and well-aligned orbits. two majorscenarios to form such planets are planet migration in a disk, andplanet--planet interactions combined with tidal dissipation. the formerscenario can naturally produce a circular and low-obliquity orbit, while thelatter implicitly assumes an initially highly eccentric and possiblyhigh-obliquity orbit, which are then circularized and aligned via tidaldissipation. we investigate the tidal evolution of transiting planets oneccentric orbits. we show that the current and future orbital evolution ofthese systems is likely dominated by tidal dissipation, and not by a moredistant companion. although most of these close-in planets experience orbitaldecay all the way to the roche limit, there are two characteristic evolutionpaths for them, depending on the relative efficiency of tidal dissipationinside the star and the planet. we point out that the current observations maybe consistent with one of them. our results suggest that at least some of theclose-in planets with non-zero orbital eccentricity may have been formed bytidally circularizing an initially eccentric orbit. we also find that even whenthe stellar spin-orbit misalignment is observed to be small at present, somesystems could have had a highly misaligned orbit in the past. finally, we alsore-examine the recent claim by levrard et. al., who found that all orbital andspin parameters evolve on a similar timescale to orbital decay.

1009.1167	angular momentum changes due to direct impact accretion in a simplified  binary system	we model a circular mass-transferring binary system to calculate the exchangeof angular momentum between stellar spins and the orbit due to direct impact ofthe mass transfer stream onto the surface of the accretor. we simulate masstransfer by calculating the ballistic motion of a point mass ejected from the$l_1$ point of the donor star, conserving the total linear and angular momentumof the system, and treating the stars as uniform density spheres with mainsequence radii determined by their masses. we show that, contrary to previousassumptions in the literature, direct impact does not always act as a sink oforbital angular momentum and may in fact increase it by facilitating thetransfer of angular momentum from the spin of the donor to the orbit. here, weshow an example of the exchange of angular momentum, as well as a measure ofthe orbital angular momentum changes for a variety of binary star systems withmain sequence components.

1009.1300	twin binaries: studies of stability, mass transfer, and coalescence	motivated by suggestions that binaries with almost equal-mass components("twins") play an important role in the formation of double neutron stars andmay be rather abundant among binaries, we study the stability of synchronizedclose and contact binaries with identical components in circular orbits. inparticular, we investigate the dependency of the innermost stable circularorbit on the core mass, and we study the coalescence of the binary that occursat smaller separations. for twin binaries composed of convective main-sequencestars, subgiants, or giants with low mass cores (m_c &lt;~0.15m, where m is themass of a component), a secular instability is reached during the contactphase, accompanied by a dynamical mass transfer instability at the same or at aslightly smaller orbital separation. binaries that come inside this instabilitylimit transfer mass gradually from one component to the other and then coalescequickly as mass is lost through the outer lagrangian points. for twin giantbinaries with moderate to massive cores (m_c &gt;~0.15m), we find that stablecontact configurations exist at all separations down to the roche limit, whenmass shedding through the outer lagrangian points triggers a coalescence of theenvelopes and leaves the cores orbiting in a central tight binary. in additionto the formation of binary neutron stars, we also discuss the implications ofour results for the production of planetary nebulae with double degeneratecentral binaries.

1011.2501	hot jupiters from secular planet--planet interactions	about 25 per cent of `hot jupiters' (extrasolar jovian-mass planets withclose-in orbits) are actually orbiting counter to the spin direction of thestar. perturbations from a distant binary star companion can produce highinclinations, but cannot explain orbits that are retrograde with respect to thetotal angular momentum of the system. such orbits in a stellar context can beproduced through secular (that is, long term) perturbations in hierarchicaltriple-star systems. here we report a similar analysis of planetary bodies,including both octupole-order effects and tidal friction, and find that we canproduce hot jupiters in orbits that are retrograde with respect to the totalangular momentum. with distant stellar mass perturbers, such an outcome is notpossible. with planetary perturbers, the inner orbit's angular momentumcomponent parallel to the total angular momentum need not be constant. in fact,as we show here, it can even change sign, leading to a retrograde orbit. abrief excursion to very high eccentricity during the chaotic evolution of theinner orbit allows planet-star tidal interactions to rapidly circularize thatorbit, decoupling the planets and forming a retrograde hot jupiter.

1012.0584	how planet-planet scattering can create high-inclination as well as  long-period orbits	recent observations have revealed two new classes of planetary orbits.rossiter- mclaughlin (rm) measurements have revealed hot jupiters inhigh-obliquity orbits. in addition, direct-imaging has discovered giant planetsat large (~ 100 au) separations via direct-imaging technique. simple-mindeddisk-migration scenarios are inconsistent with the high-inclination (and evenretrograde) orbits as seen in recent rm measurements. furthermore, forminggiant planets at large semi-major axis (a) may be challenging in thecore-accretion paradigm. we perform many n-body simulations to explore the twoabove-mentioned orbital architectures. planet-planet scattering in amulti-planet system can naturally excite orbital inclinations. planets can alsoget scattered to large distances. large-a planetary orbits created fromplanet-planet scattering are expected to have high eccentricities (e).theoretical models predict that the observed long-period planets, such asfomalhaut-b have moderate e \approx 0.3. interestingly, these are also insystems with disks. we find that if a massive-enough outer disk is present, ascattered planet may be circularized at large a via dynamical friction from thedisk and repeated scattering of the disk particles.

1105.5884	formation of massive black holes in dense star clusters. ii. imf and  primordial mass segregation	a promising mechanism to form intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs) is therunaway merger in dense star clusters, where main-sequence stars collide andform a very massive star (vms), which then collapses to a black hole. in thispaper we study the effects of primordial mass segregation and the importance ofthe stellar initial mass function (imf) on the runaway growth of vmss using adynamical monte carlo code for n-body systems with n as high as 10^6 stars. ourcode now includes an explicit treatment of all stellar collisions. we placespecial emphasis on the possibility of top-heavy imfs, as observed in some veryyoung massive clusters. we find that both primordial mass segregation and theshape of the imf affect the rate of core collapse of star clusters and thus thetime of the runaway. when we include primordial mass segregation we generallysee a decrease in core collapse time (tcc). moreover, primordial masssegregation increases the average mass in the core, thus reducing the centralrelaxation time, which also decreases tcc. the final mass of the vms formed isalways close to \sim 10^-3 of the total cluster mass, in agreement with theprevious studies and is reminiscent of the observed correlation between thecentral black hole mass and the bulge mass of the galaxies. as the degree ofprimordial mass segregation is increased, the mass of the vms increases at mostby a factor of 3. flatter imfs generally increase the average mass in the wholecluster, which increases tcc. for the range of imfs investigated in this paper,this increase in tcc is to some degree balanced by stellar collisions, whichaccelerate core collapse. thus there is no significant change in tcc for thesomewhat flatter global imfs observed in very young massive clusters.

1107.2414	secular dynamics in hierarchical three-body systems	the secular approximation for the evolution of hierarchical tripleconfigurations has proven to be very useful in many astrophysical contexts,from planetary to triple-star systems. in this approximation the orbits maychange shape and orientation, on time scales longer than the orbital timescales, but the semi major axes are constant. for example, for highly inclinedtriple systems, the kozai-lidov mechanism can produce large-amplitudeoscillations of the eccentricities and inclinations. here we revisit thesecular dynamics of hierarchical triple systems. we derive the secularevolution equations to octupole order in hamiltonian perturbation theory. ourderivation corrects an error in some previous treatments of the problem thatimplicitly assumed a conservation of the z-component of the angular momentum ofthe inner orbit (i.e., parallel to the total angular momentum of the system).already to quadrupole order, our results show new behaviors including thepossibility for a system to oscillate from prograde to retrograde orbits. atthe octupole order, for an eccentric outer orbit, the inner orbit can reachextremely high eccentricities and undergo chaotic flips in its orientation. wediscuss applications to a variety of astrophysical systems, from stellartriples to merging compact binaries and planetary systems. our results agreewith those of previous studies done to quadrupole order only in the limit inwhich one of the inner two bodies is a massless test particle and the outerorbit is circular;our results agree with previous studies at octupole order forthe eccentricity evolution, but not for the inclination evolution.

0710.0878	the total merger rate of compact object binaries in the local universe	using a population synthesis approach, we compute the total merger rate inthe local universe for double neutron stars, double black holes, and black hole-- neutron star binaries. these compact binaries are the prime sourcecandidates for gravitational-wave detection by ligo and virgo. we account formergers originating from field populations and from dense stellar clusters. forboth populations we use the same treatment of stellar evolution. our resultsindicate that the merger rates of double neutron stars and black hole --neutron star binaries are strongly dominated by field populations, whilemerging black hole binaries are formed much more effectively in dense stellarclusters. the overall merger rate of double compact objects depends sensitivelyon the (largely unknown) initial mass fraction contained in dense clustersf_cl. for f_cl &lt; 0.0001, the advanced ligo detection rate will be dominated byfield populations of double neutron star mergers, with a small but significantnumber of detections ~20 yr^-1. however for a higher mass fraction in clusters,f_cl &gt; 0.001, the detection rate will be dominated by numerous mergers ofdouble black holes originating from dense clusters, and it will be considerablyhigher, ~25 - 300 yr^-1. in addition, we show that, once mergers of doubleblack holes are detected, it is easy to differentiate between systems formed inthe field and in dense clusters, since the chirp mass distributions arestrikingly different. finally, we point out that there may exist a populationof merging black hole binaries in intergalactic space.

1206.3529	on the formation of hot jupiters in stellar binaries	we study the production of hot jupiters (hjs) in stellar binaries. we showthat the "eccentric kozai-lidov" (ekl) mechanism can play a key role in thedynamical evolution of a star-planet-star triple system. we run a large set ofmonte carlo simulations including the secular evolution of the orbits, generalrelativistic precession, and tides, and we determine the semi-major axis,eccentricity, inclination and spin-orbit angle distributions of the hjs thatare produced. we explore the effect of different tidal friction parameters onthe results. we find that the efficiency of forming hjs when taking the eklmechanism into account is higher then previously estimated. accounting for thefrequency of stellar binaries, we find that this production mechanism canaccount for about 30% of the observed hj population. current observations ofspin-orbit angles are consistent with this mechanism producing \sim 30% of allhjs, and up to 100% of the misaligned systems. based on the properties ofbinaries without a hj in our simulations, we predict the existence of manyjupiter-like planets with moderately eccentric and inclined orbits andsemi-major axes of several au.

1207.2497	constraining intermediate-mass black holes in globular clusters	decades after the first predictions of intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs)in globular clusters (gcs) there is still no unambiguous observational evidencefor their existence. the most promising signatures for imbhs are found in thecores of gcs, where the evidence now comes from the stellar velocitydistribution, the surface density profile, and, for very deep observations, themass-segregation profile near the cluster center. however, interpretation ofthe data, and, in particular, constraints on central imbh masses, require theuse of detailed cluster dynamical models. here we present results from montecarlo cluster simulations of gcs that harbor imbhs. as an example ofapplication, we compare velocity dispersion, surface brightness andmass-segregation profiles with observations of the gc m10, and constrain themass of a possible central imbh in this cluster. we find that, although m10does not seem to possess a cuspy surface density profile, the presence of animbh with a mass up to 0.75% of the total cluster mass, corresponding to about600 msun, cannot be excluded. this is also in agreement with the surfacebrightness profile, although we find it to be less constraining, as it isdominated by the light of giants, causing it to fluctuate significantly. wealso find that the mass-segregation profile cannot be used to discriminatebetween models with and without imbh. the reason is that m10 is not yetdynamically evolved enough for the quenching of mass segregation to takeeffect. finally, detecting a velocity dispersion cusp in clusters with centraldensities as low as in m10 is extremely challenging, and has to rely on only20-40 bright stars. it is only when stars with masses down to 0.3 msun areincluded that the velocity cusp is sampled close enough to the imbh for asignificant increase above the core velocity dispersion to become detectable.

1207.3545	planets in open clusters detectable by kepler	while hundreds of planets have been discovered around field stars, only a feware known in star clusters. to explain the lack of short-period giant planetsin globular clusters (gc), such as 47 tucane and \omega\ centauri, it has beensuggested that their low metallicities may have prevented planet formation.alternatively, the high rates of close stellar encounters in these clusters mayhave influenced the formation and subsequent evolution of planetary systems.how common are planets in clusters around normal main-sequence stars? here weconsider whether this question can be addressed using data from the keplermission. the kepler field of view contains 4 low-density (relative to gcs) openclusters where the metallicities are about solar (or even higher) and stellarencounters are much less frequent than in typical gcs. we provide detailed$n$-body models and show that most planets in kepler-detectable orbits are notsignificantly perturbed by stellar encounters in these open clusters. we focuson the most massive cluster, ngc 6791, which has super-solar metallicity, andfind that if planets formed in this cluster at the same frequency as observedin the field, kepler could detect 1 -- 20 transiting planets depending on theplanet-size distribution and the duration of data collection. due to the largedistance to ngc 6791 kepler will have to search relatively faint ($k_p&lt;20$)stars for the full extended mission to achieve such a yield.

1211.3372	retention of stellar-mass black holes in globular clusters	globular clusters should be born with significant numbers of stellar-massblack holes (bhs). it has been thought for two decades that very few of thesebhs could be retained through the cluster lifetime. with masses ~10 msun, bhsare ~20 times more massive than an average cluster star. they segregate intothe cluster core, where they may eventually decouple from the remainder of thecluster. the small-n core then evaporates on a short timescale. this is theso-called spitzer instability. here we present the results of a full dynamicalsimulation of a globular cluster containing many stellar-mass bhs with arealistic mass spectrum. our monte carlo simulation code includes detailedtreatments of all relevant stellar evolution and dynamical processes. our mainfinding is that old globular clusters could still contain many bhs at present.in our simulation, we find no evidence for the spitzer instability. instead,most of the bhs remain well-mixed with the rest of the cluster, with only theinnermost few tens of bhs segregating significantly. over the 12 gyr evolution,fewer than half of the bhs are dynamically ejected through strong binaryinteractions in the cluster core. the presence of bhs leads to long-termheating of the cluster, ultimately producing a core radius on the high end ofthe distribution for milky way globular clusters (and those of other galaxies).a crude extrapolation from our model suggests that the bh--bh merger rate fromglobular clusters could be comparable to the rate in the field.

1211.6738	sowing the seeds of massive black holes in small galaxies: young  clusters as the building blocks of ultra-compact-dwarf galaxies	interacting galaxies often have complexes of hundreds of young stellarclusters of individual masses $\sim 10^{4-6}~m_\odot$ in regions that are a fewhundred parsecs across. these cluster complexes interact dynamically, and theircoalescence is a candidate for the origin of some ultracompact dwarf galaxies(ucds). individual clusters with short relaxation times are candidates for theproduction of intermediate-mass black holes of a few hundred solar masses, viarunaway stellar collisions prior to the first supernovae in a cluster. it istherefore possible that a cluster complex hosts multiple intermediate-massblack holes that may be ejected from their individual clusters due to mergersor binary processes, but bound to the complex as a whole. here we explore thedynamical interaction between initially free-flying massive black holes andclusters in an evolving cluster complex. we find that, after hitting someclusters, it is plausible that the massive black hole will be captured in anultracompact dwarf forming near the center of the complex. in the process, thehole typically triggers electromagnetic flares via stellar disruptions, and isalso likely to be a prominent source of gravitational radiation for theadvanced ground-based detectors ligo and virgo. we also discuss otherimplications of this scenario, notably that the central black hole could beconsiderably larger than expected in other formation scenarios for ultracompactdwarfs.

1302.7284	stellar collisions and blue straggler stars in dense globular clusters	blue straggler stars (bss) are abundantly observed in all galactic globularclusters (ggc) where data exist. however, observations alone cannot reveal therelative importance of various formation channels or the typical formationtimes for this well studied population of anomalous stars. using astate-of-the-art h\'enon-type monte carlo code that includes all relevantphysical processes, we create 128 models with properties typical of theobserved ggcs. these models include realistic numbers of single and binarystars, use observationally motivated initial conditions, and span large rangesin central density, concentration, binary fraction, and mass. their propertiescan be directly compared with those of observed ggcs. we can easily identifythe bsss in our models and determine their formation channels and birth times.we find that for central densities above ~10^3 msun/pc^3 the dominant formationchannel is stellar collisions while for lower density clusters, mass transferin binaries provides a significant contribution (up to ~ 60% in our models).the majority of these collisions are binary-mediated, occurring during 3-bodyand 4-body interactions. as a result a strong correlation between the specificfrequency of bsss and the binary fraction in a cluster can be seen in ourmodels. we find that the number of bsss in the core shows only a weakcorrelation with the collision rate estimator \gamma traditionally used byobservers, in agreement with the latest hubble space telescope (acs) data.using an idealized "full mixing" prescription for collision products, ourmodels indicate that the bsss observed today may have formed several gyrs ago.however, denser clusters tend to have younger (~1 gyr) bsss.

1303.2667	mock observations of blue stragglers in globular cluster models	we created artificial color-magnitude diagrams of monte carlo dynamicalmodels of globular clusters, and then used observational methods to determinethe number of blue stragglers in those clusters. we compared these bluestragglers to various cluster properties, mimicking work that has been done forblue stragglers in milky way globular clusters to determine the dominantformation mechanism(s) of this unusual stellar population. we find that amass-based prescription for selecting blue stragglers will choose approximatelytwice as many blue stragglers than a selection criterion that was developed forobservations of real clusters. however, the two numbers of blue stragglers arewell-correlated, so either selection criterion can be used to characterize theblue straggler population of a cluster. we confirm previous results that thesimplified prescription for the evolution of a collision or merger product inthe bse code overestimates their lifetimes. we show that our model bluestragglers follow similar trends with cluster properties (core mass, binaryfraction, total mass, collision rate) as the true milky way blue stragglers, aslong as we restrict ourselves to model clusters with an initial binary fractionhigher than 5%. we also show that, in contrast to earlier work, the number ofblue stragglers in the cluster core does have a weak dependence on thecollisional parameter gamma in both our models and in milky way globularclusters.

0801.1926	resonance trapping in protoplanetary disks. i. coplanar systems	mean-motion resonances (mmrs) are likely to play an important role bothduring and after the lifetime of a protostellar gas disk. we study thedynamical evolution and stability of planetary systems containing two giantplanets on circular orbits near a 2:1 resonance and closer. we find that byhaving the outer planet migrate inward, the two planets can capture into eitherthe 2:1, 5:3, or 3:2 mmr. we use direct numerical integrations of ~1000 systemsin which the planets are initially locked into one of these resonances andallowed to evolve for up to ~10^7 yr. we find that the final eccentricitydistribution in systems which ultimately become unstable gives a good fit toobserved exoplanets. next, we integrate ~500 two-planet systems in which theouter planet is driven to continuously migrate inward, resonantly capturing theinner; the systems are evolved until either instability sets in or the planetsreach the star. we find that although the 5:3 resonance rapidly becomesunstable under migration, the 2:1 and 3:2 are very stable. thus the lack ofobserved exoplanets in resonances closer than 2:1, if it continues to hold up,may be a primordial signature of the planet formation process.

1310.5048	extreme orbital evolution from hierarchical secular coupling of two  giant planets	observations of exoplanets over the last two decades have revealed a newclass of jupiter-size planets with orbital periods of a few days, the so-called"hot jupiters". recent measurements using the rossiter-mclaughlin effect haveshown that many (~ 50%) of these planets are misaligned; furthermore, some (~15%) are even retrograde with respect to the stellar spin axis. motivated bythese observations, we explore the possibility of forming retrograde orbits inhierarchical triple configurations consisting of a star-planet inner pair withanother giant planet, or brown dwarf, in a much wider orbit. recently naoz etal. (2011) showed that in such a system, the inner planet's orbit can flip backand forth from prograde to retrograde, and can also reach extremely higheccentricities. here we map a significant part of the parameter space ofdynamical outcomes for these systems. we derive strong constraints on theorbital configurations for the outer perturber that could lead to the formationof hot jupiters with misaligned or retrograde orbits. we focus only on thesecular evolution, neglecting other dynamical effects such as mean-motionresonances, as well as all dissipative forces. for example, with an innerjupiter-like planet initially on a nearly circular orbit at 5 au, we show thata misaligned hot jupiter is likely to be formed in the presence of a moremassive planetary companion (&gt; 2 mj) within 140 au of the inner system, withmutual inclination 50 degrees and eccentricity above 0.25. this is in strikingcontrast to the test-particle approximation, where an almost perpendicularconfiguration can still cause large eccentricity excitations, but flips of aninner jupiter-like planet are much less likely to occur. the constraints wederive can be used to guide future observations, and, in particular, searchesfor more distant companions in systems containing a hot jupiter.

1402.3857	tidal dissipation and obliquity evolution in hot jupiter systems	two formation scenarios have been proposed to explain the tight orbits of hotjupiters. they could be formed in orbits with a small inclination (with respectto the stellar spin) via disk migration, or in more highly inclined orbits viahigh-eccentricity migration, where gravitational interactions with a companionand tidal dissipation are at play. here we target hot jupiter systems where themisalignment $\lambda$ has been inferred observationally and we investigatewhether their properties are consistent with high-eccentricity migration.specifically, we study whether stellar tides can be responsible for theobserved distribution of $\lambda$ and orbital separations. improving onprevious studies, we use detailed models for each star, thus accounting for howconvection (and tidal dissipation) depends on stellar properties. in line withobservations suggesting that hotter stars have higher $\lambda$, we find that$\lambda$ increases as the amount of stellar surface convection decreases. thistrend supports the hypothesis that tides are the mechanism shaping the observeddistribution of $\lambda$. furthermore, we study the past orbital evolution offive representative systems, chosen to cover a variety of temperatures andmisalignments. we consider various initial orbital configurations and integratethe equations describing the coupled evolution of the orbital separation,stellar spin, and misalignment. we account for stellar tides and wind massloss, stellar evolution, and magnetic braking. we show that the currentproperties of these five representative systems can be explained naturally,given our current understanding of tidal dissipation and with physicallymotivated assumptions for the effects driving the orbital evolution.

0802.4088	planetary systems in binaries. i. dynamical classification	many recent observational studies have concluded that planetary systemscommonly exist in multiple-star systems. at least ~20% of the known extrasolarplanetary systems are associated with one or more stellar companions. theorbits of stellar binaries hosting planetary systems are typically wider than100 au and often highly inclined with respect to the planetary orbits. theeffect of secular perturbations from such an inclined binary orbit on a coupledsystem of planets, however, is little understood theoretically. in this paperwe investigate various dynamical classes of double-planet systems in binariesthrough numerical integrations and we provide an analytic framework based onsecular perturbation theories. differential nodal precession of the planets isthe key property that separates two distinct dynamical classes of multipleplanets in binaries: (1) dynamically-rigid systems in which the orbital planesof planets precess in concert as if they were embedded in a rigid disk, and (2)weakly-coupled systems in which the mutual inclination angle between initiallycoplanar planets grows to large values on secular timescales. in the lattercase, the quadrupole perturbation from the outer planet induces additionalkozai cycles and causes the orbital eccentricity of the inner planet tooscillate with large amplitudes. the cyclic angular momentum transfer from astellar companion propagating inward through planets can significantly alterthe orbital properties of the inner planet on shorter timescales. thisperturbation propagation mechanism may offer important constraints on thepresence of additional planets in known single-planet systems in binaries.

1407.2249	the dynamics of the multi-planet system orbiting kepler-56	kepler-56 is a multi-planet system containing two coplanar inner planets thatare in orbits misaligned with respect to the spin axis of the host star, and anouter planet. various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the broaddistribution of spin-orbit angles among exoplanets, and these theories fallunder two broad categories. the first is based on dynamical interactions in amulti-body system, while the other assumes that disk migration is the drivingmechanism in planetary configuration and that the star (or disk) is titled withrespect to the planetary plane. here we show that the large observed obliquityof kepler-56 system is consistent with a dynamical origin. in addition, we useobservations by huber et al. (2013) to derive the obliquity's probabilitydistribution function, thus improving the constrained lower limit. the outerplanet may be the cause of the inner planets' large obliquities, and we givethe probability distribution function of its inclination, which depends on theinitial orbital configuration of the planetary system. we show that even in thepresence of precise measurement of the true obliquity, one cannot distinguishthe initial configurations. finally we consider the fate of the system as thestar continues to evolve beyond the main sequence, and we find that theobliquity of the system will not undergo major variations as the star climbsthe red giant branch. we follow the evolution of the system and find that theinnermost planet will be engulfed in ~129 myr. furthermore we put an upperlimit of ~155 myr for the engulfment of the second planet. this corresponds to~ 3% of the current age of the star.

1408.3635	from hot jupiters to super-earths via roche lobe overflow	through tidal dissipation in a slowly spinning host star the orbits of manyhot jupiters may decay down to the roche limit. we expect that in most casesthe ensuing mass transfer will be stable. using detailed numerical calculationswe find that this evolution is quite rapid, potentially leading to completeremoval of the gaseous envelope in a few gyr, and leaving behind an exposedrocky core ("hot super-earth"). final orbital periods are quite sensitive tothe details of the planet's mass-radius relation, and to the effects ofirradiation and photo-evaporation, but could be as short as a few hours, or aslong as several days. our scenario predicts the existence of planets withintermediate masses ("hot neptunes") that should be found precisely at theirroche limit and in the process of losing mass through roche lobe overflow. theobserved excess of small single-planet candidate systems observed by kepler mayalso be the result of this process. if so, the properties of their host starsshould track those of the hot jupiters. moreover, the number of systems thatproduced hot jupiters could be 2-3 times larger than one would infer fromcontemporary observations.

1409.0866	the dynamical evolution of stellar black holes in globular clusters	our current understanding of the stellar initial mass function and massivestar evolution suggests that young globular clusters may have formed hundredsto thousands of stellar-mass black holes, the remnants of stars with initialmasses from $\sim 20 - 100\, m_\odot$. birth kicks from supernova explosionsmay eject some black holes from their birth clusters, but most should beretained. using a monte carlo method we investigate the long-term dynamicalevolution of globular clusters containing large numbers of stellar black holes.we describe numerical results for 42 models, covering a range of realisticinitial conditions, including up to $1.6\times10^6$ stars. in almost all modelswe find that significant numbers of black holes (up to $\sim10^3$) are retainedall the way to the present. this is in contrast to previous theoreticalexpectations that most black holes should be ejected dynamically within a fewgyr. the main reason for this difference is that core collapse driven by blackholes (through the spitzer "mass segregation instability") is easily revertedthrough three-body processes, and involves only a small number of the mostmassive black holes, while lower-mass black holes remain well-mixed withordinary stars far from the central cusp. thus the rapid segregation of stellarblack holes does not lead to a long-term physical separation of most blackholes into a dynamically decoupled inner core, as often assumed previously.combined with the recent detections of several black hole x-ray binarycandidates in galactic globular clusters, our results suggest that stellarblack holes could still be present in large numbers in many globular clusterstoday, and that they may play a significant role in shaping the long-termdynamical evolution and the present-day dynamical structure of many clusters.

1505.05812	stability and coalescence of massive twin binaries	massive stars are usually found in binaries, and binaries with periods lessthan 10 days may have a preference for near equal component masses. in thispaper we investigate the evolution of these binaries all the way to contact andthe possibility that these systems can be progenitors of double neutron starbinaries. the small orbital separations of observed double neutron starbinaries suggest that the progenitor systems underwent a common envelope phaseat least once during their evolution. bethe &amp; brown (1998) proposed thatmassive binary twins will undergo a common envelope evolution while bothcomponents are ascending the red giant branch or asymptotic giant branchsimultaneously, also known as double-core evolution. using models generatedfrom the stellar evolution code evolve zero age main sequence, we determine therange of mass ratios resulting in both components simultaneously ascending thergb or agb as a function of the difference in birth times, t. we find that,even for a generous t=5 myr, the minimum mass ratio qmin=0.933 for an 8 solarmass primary and increases for larger primaries. we use a hydrodynamics code,starsmasher, to study specifically the evolution of q=1 common envelope systemsas a function of initial component mass, age, and orbital separation. we findthe dynamical stability limit, the largest orbital separation where the binarybecomes dynamically unstable, as a function of the component mass and age.finally, we calculate the efficiency of ejecting matter during the inspiralphase to extrapolate the properties of the remnant binary from our numericalresults, assuming the common envelope is completely ejected. we find that forthe nominal core masses, there is a minimum orbital separation for a givencomponent mass such that the helium cores survive common envelope evolution ina tightly bound binary and are viable progenitors for double neutron stars.

1506.05175	tidally-driven roche-lobe overflow of hot jupiters with mesa	many exoplanets have now been detected in orbits with ultra-short periods,very close to the roche limit. building upon our previous work, we study thepossibility that mass loss through roche lobe overflow (rlo) may affect theevolution of these planets, and could possibly transform a hot jupiter into alower-mass planet (hot neptune or super-earth). we focus here on systems inwhich the mass loss occurs slowly ("stable mass transfer" in the language ofbinary star evolution) and we compute their evolution in detail with the binaryevolution code mesa. we include the effects of tides, rlo, irradiation andphoto-evaporation of the planet, as well as the stellar wind and magneticbraking. our calculations all start with a hot jupiter close to its rochelimit, in orbit around a sun-like star. the initial orbital decay and onset ofrlo are driven by tidal dissipation in the star. we confirm that such a systemcan indeed evolve to produce lower-mass planets in orbits of a few days. therlo phase eventually ends and, depending on the details of the mass transferand on the planetary core mass, the orbital period can remain around a few daysfor several gyr. the remnant planets have a rocky core and some amount ofenvelope material, which is slowly removed via photo-evaporation at nearlyconstant orbital period; these have properties resembling many of the observedsuper-earths and sub-neptunes. for these remnant planets we also predict ananti-correlation between mass and orbital period; very low-mass planets($m_{\rm pl}\,\lesssim\,5\,m_{\oplus}$) in ultra-short periods ($p_{\rmorb}$&lt;1d) cannot be produced through this type of evolution.

0805.2358	clearing the dust from globular clusters	recent spitzer observations of the globular cluster m15 detected dustassociated with its intracluster medium. surprisingly, these observations implythat the dust must be very short-lived compared to the time since the lastgalactic plane crossing of the cluster.here we propose a simple mechanism toexplain this short lifetime. we argue that the kinetic energy of the materialejected during a stellar collision may be sufficient to remove the gas and dustentirely from a cluster, or to remove the gas as a wind, in addition topartially destroying the dust. by calculating the rate of stellar collisionsusing an n-body model for the cluster, we find remarkable agreement between theaverage time between collisions and the inferred dust lifetime in this cluster,suggesting a possible close relation between the two phenomena. furthermore, wealso obtain the birthrate of blue stragglers formed through collisions in m15.by comparing with the observed number of blue stragglers, we derive an upperlimit for their average lifetime which turns out to be consistent with recentmodel calculations, thereby lending further support to our model.

1509.05080	black hole mergers and blue stragglers from hierarchical triples formed  in globular clusters	hierarchical triple-star systems are expected to form frequently via closebinary-binary encounters in the dense cores of globular clusters. in asufficiently inclined triple, gravitational interactions between the inner andouter binary can cause large-amplitude oscillations in the eccentricity of theinner orbit ("lidov-kozai cycles"), which can lead to a collision and merger ofthe two inner components. in this paper we use monte carlo models of dense starclusters to identify all triple systems formed dynamically and we compute theirevolution using a highly accurate three-body integrator which incorporatesrelativistic and tidal effects. we find that a large fraction of these triplesevolve through a non-secular dynamical phase which can drive the inner binaryto higher eccentricities than predicted by the standard secular perturbationtheory (even including octupole-order terms). we place constraints on theimportance of lidov-kozai-induced mergers for producing: (i) gravitational wavesources detectable by advanced ligo (aligo), for triples with an inner pair ofstellar black holes; and (ii) blue straggler stars, for triples withmain-sequence-star components. we find a realistic aligo detection rate ofblack hole mergers due to the lidov-kozai mechanism of 1yr^-1, with about 20%of these having a finite eccentricity when they first chirp into the aligofrequency band. while rare, these events are likely to dominate among eccentriccompact object inspirals that are potentially detectable by aligo. for bluestragglers, we find that the lidov-kozai mechanism can contribute only up to~10% of their total numbers in globular clusters.

1510.02093	formation of black hole low-mass x-ray binaries in hierarchical triple  systems	the formation of black hole (bh) low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxb) poses atheoretical challenge, as low-mass companions are not expected to survive thecommon-envelope scenario with the bh progenitor. here we propose a formationmechanism that skips the common-envelope scenario and relies on triple-bodydynamics. we study the evolution of hierarchical triples, following the seculardynamical evolution up to the octupole-level of approximation, includinggeneral relativity, tidal effects and post-main-sequence evolution, such asmass loss, changes to stellar radii and supernovae. during the dynamicalevolution of the triple system, the "eccentric kozai-lidov" mechanism can causelarge eccentricity excitations in the lmxb progenitor, resulting in three mainbh-lmxb formation channels. here we define bh-lmxb candidates as systems wherethe inner bh companion star crosses its roche limit. in the "eccentric" channel(~ 81% of the lmxbs in our simulations), the donor star crosses its roche limitduring an extreme eccentricity excitation, while still on a wide orbit. second,we find a "giant" lmxb channel (~ 11%), where a system undergoes only moderateeccentricity excitations, but the donor star fills its roche lobe afterevolving toward the giant branch. third, we identify a "classical" channel(~8%), where tidal forces and magnetic braking shrink and circularize the orbitto short periods, triggering mass transfer. finally, for the giant channel, wepredict an eccentric ($\sim 0.3-0.6$), preferably inclined (~40, ~140 degreed)tertiary, typically on a wide enough orbit (~10^4au), to potentially becomeunbound later in the triple evolution.

0807.1105	induced kozai migration and formation of close-in planets in binaries	many recent observational studies have concluded that planetary systemscommonly exist in multiple-star systems. at least ~20%, and presumably a largerfraction of the known extrasolar planetary systems are associated with one ormore stellar companions. these stellar companions normally exist at largedistances from the planetary systems (typical projected binary separations areon the orders 100-10000au) and are often faint (ranging from f to t spectraltypes). yet, secular cyclic angular momentum exchange with these distantstellar companions can significantly alter the orbital configuration of theplanets around the primaries. one of the most interesting and fairly commonoutcomes seen in numerical simulations is the opening of a large mutualinclination angle between the planetary orbits, forced by differential nodalprecessions caused by the binary companion. the growth of the mutualinclination angle between planetary orbits induces additional large-amplitudeeccentricity oscillations of the inner planet due to the quadrupolegravitational perturbation by the outer planet. this eccentricity oscillationmay eventually result in the orbital decay of the inner planet through tidalfriction, as previously proposed as kozai migration or kozai cycles with tidalfriction (kctf). this orbital decay mechanism induced by the binaryperturbation and subsequent tidal dissipation may stand as an alternativeformation channel for close-in extrasolar planets.

astro-ph;0103001	binaries and globular cluster dynamics	we summarize the results of recent theoretical work on the dynamicalevolution of globular clusters containing primordial binaries. even a verysmall initial binary fraction (e.g., 10%) can play a key role in supporting acluster against gravothermal collapse for many relaxation times. inelasticencounters between binaries and single stars or other binaries provide a verysignificant energy source for the cluster. these dynamical interactions alsolead to the production of large numbers of exotic systems such as ultracompactx-ray binaries, recycled radio pulsars, double degenerate systems, and bluestragglers. our work is based on a new parallel supercomputer code implementinghenon's monte carlo method for simulating the dynamical evolution of densestellar systems in the fokker-planck approximation. this new code allows us tocalculate very accurately the evolution of a cluster containing a realisticnumber of stars (n ~ 10^5 - 10^6) in typically a few hours to a few days ofcomputing time. the discrete, star-by-star representation of the cluster in thesimulation makes it possible to treat naturally a number of importantprocesses, including single and binary star evolution, all dynamicalinteractions of single stars and binaries, and tidal interactions with thegalaxy.

astro-ph;0304038	formation of massive black holes in dense star clusters	we review possible dynamical formation processes for central massive blackholes in dense star clusters. we focus on the early dynamical evolution ofyoung clusters containing a few thousand to a few million stars. one naturalformation path for a central seed black hole in these systems involves thedevelopment of the spitzer instability, through which the most massive starscan drive the cluster to core collapse in a very short time. the suddenincrease in the core density then leads to a runaway collision process and theformation of a very massive merger remnant, which must then collapse to a blackhole. alternatively, if the most massive stars end their lives before corecollapse, a central cluster of stellar-mass black holes is formed. this clusterwill likely evaporate before reaching the highly relativistic state necessaryto drive a runaway merger process through gravitational radiation, therebyavoiding the formation of a central massive black hole. we summarize theconditions under which these different paths will be followed, and present theresults of recent numerical simulations demonstrating the process of rapid corecollapse and runaway collisions between massive stars.

astro-ph;0308449	formation of massive black holes in dense star clusters. i. mass  segregation and core collapse	we study the early dynamical evolution of young, dense star clusters usingmonte carlo simulations for systems with up to n~10^7 stars. rapid masssegregation of massive main-sequence stars and the development of the spitzerinstability can drive these systems to core collapse in a small fraction of theinitial half-mass relaxation time. if the core collapse time is less than thelifetime of the massive stars, all stars in the collapsing core may thenundergo a runaway collision process leading to the formation of a massive blackhole. here we study in detail the first step in this process, up to theoccurrence of core collapse. we have performed about 100 simulations forclusters with a wide variety of initial conditions, varying systematically thecluster density profile, stellar imf, and number of stars. we also consideredthe effects of initial mass segregation and stellar evolution mass loss. ourresults show that, for clusters with a moderate initial central concentrationand any realistic imf, the ratio of core collapse time to initial half-massrelaxation time is typically ~0.1, in agreement with the value previously foundby direct n-body simulations for much smaller systems. models with even highercentral concentration initially, or with initial mass segregation (from starformation) have even shorter core-collapse times. remarkably, we find that, forall realistic initial conditions, the mass of the collapsing core is alwaysclose to ~10^-3 of the total cluster mass, very similar to the observedcorrelation between central black hole mass and total cluster mass in a varietyof environments. we discuss the implications of our results for the formationof intermediate-mass black holes in globular clusters and super star clusters,ultraluminous x-ray sources, and seed black holes in proto-galactic nuclei.

astro-ph;0502441	evidence for planet-planet scattering in upsilon andromedae	doppler spectroscopy has detected 136 planets around nearby stars. a majorpuzzle is why their orbits are highly eccentric, while all planets in our solarsystem are on nearly circular orbits, as expected if they formed by accretionprocesses in a protostellar disk. several mechanisms have been proposed togenerate large eccentricities after planet formation, but so far there has beenlittle observational evidence to support any particular one. here we reportthat the current orbital configuration of the three giant planets aroundupsilon andromedae (ups and) provides evidence for a close dynamicalinteraction with another planet, now lost from the system. the planets startedon nearly circular orbits, but chaotic evolution caused the outer planet (upsand d) to be perturbed suddenly into a higher-eccentricity orbit. the coupledevolution of the system then causes slow periodic variations in theeccentricity of the middle planet (ups and c). indeed, we show that ups and cperiodically returns to a very nearly circular state every 9000 years. ouranalysis shows that strong planet-planet scattering, one of several mechanismspreviously discussed for increasing orbital eccentricities, must have operatedin this system.

astro-ph;0503130	runaway collisions in young star clusters. ii. numerical results	we present a new study of the collisional runaway scenario to form anintermediate-mass black hole (imbh, mbh &gt; 100 msun) at the centre of a young,compact stellar cluster. the first phase is the formation of a very densecentral core of massive stars (mstar =~ 30-120 msun) through mass segregationand gravothermal collapse. previous work established the conditions for this tohappen before the massive stars evolve off the main sequence (ms). in this anda companion paper, we investigate the next stage by implementing directcollisions between stars. using a monte carlo stellar dynamics code, we followthe core collapse and subsequent collisional phase in more than 100 models withvarying cluster mass, size, and initial concentration. collisions are treatedeither as ideal, ``sticky-sphere'' mergers or using realistic prescriptionsderived from 3-d hydrodynamics computations. in all cases for which the corecollapse happens in less than the ms lifetime of massive stars (~3 myr), weobtain the growth of a single very massive star (vms, mstar =~ 400-4000 msun)through a runaway sequence of mergers. mass loss from collisions, even forvelocity dispersions as high as sigma1d ~ 1000 km/s, does not prevent therunaway. the region of cluster parameter space leading to runaway is even moreextended than predicted in previous work because, in clusters with sigma1d &gt;300 km/s, collisions accelerate (and, in extreme cases, drive) core collapse.although the vms grows rapidly to &gt; 1000 msun in models exhibiting runaway, wecannot predict accurately its final mass. this is because the termination ofthe runaway process must eventually be determined by a complex interplaybetween stellar dynamics, hydrodynamics, and the stellar evolution of the vms.[abridged]

astro-ph;0510296	eccentricities of planets in binary systems	the most puzzling property of the extrasolar planets discovered by recentradial velocity surveys is their high orbital eccentricities, which are verydifficult to explain within our current theoretical paradigm for planetformation. current data reveal that at least 25% of these planets, includingsome with particularly high eccentricities, are orbiting a component of abinary star system. the presence of a distant companion can cause significantsecular perturbations in the orbit of a planet. at high relative inclinations,large-amplitude, periodic eccentricity perturbations can occur. these are knownas "kozai cycles" and their amplitude is purely dependent on the relativeorbital inclination. assuming that every planet host star also has a (possiblyunseen, e.g., substellar) distant companion, with reasonable distributions oforbital parameters and masses, we determine the resulting eccentricitydistribution of planets and compare it to observations? we find thatperturbations from a binary companion always appear to produce an excess ofplanets with both very high (e&gt;0.6) and very low (e&lt;0.1) eccentricities. thepaucity of near-circular orbits in the observed sample implies that at leastone additional mechanism must be increasing eccentricities. on the other hand,the overproduction of very high eccentricities observed in our models could becombined with plausible circularization mechanisms (e.g., friction fromresidual gas) to create more planets with intermediate eccentricities(e=0.1-0.6).

astro-ph;0510748	dynamical interactions of planetary systems in dense stellar  environments	we study dynamical interactions of star--planet binaries with other singlestars. we derive analytical cross sections for all possible outcomes, andconfirm them with numerical scattering experiments. we find that a wide massratio in the binary introduces a region in parameter space that is inaccessibleto comparable-mass systems, in which the nature of the dynamical interaction isfundamentally different from what has traditionally been considered in theliterature on binary scattering. we study the properties of the planetarysystems that result from the scattering interactions for all regions ofparameter space, paying particular attention to the location of the"hard--soft" boundary. the structure of the parameter space turns out to besignificantly richer than a simple statement of the location of the"hard--soft" boundary would imply. we consider the implications of ourfindings, calculating characteristic lifetimes for planetary systems in densestellar environments, and applying the results to previous analytical studies,as well as past and future observations. recognizing that the system psrb1620-26 in the globular cluster m4 lies in the "new" region of parameterspace, we perform a detailed analysis quantifying the likelihood of differentscenarios in forming the system we see today.

astro-ph;0511366	the dynamical evolution of black hole-neutron star binaries in general  relativity: simulations of tidal disruption	we calculate the first dynamical evolutions of merging black hole-neutronstar binaries that construct the combined black hole-neutron star spacetime ina general relativistic framework. we treat the metric in the conformal flatnessapproximation, and assume that the black hole mass is sufficiently largecompared to that of the neutron star so that the black hole remains fixed inspace. using a spheroidal spectral methods solver, we solve the resulting fieldequations for a neutron star orbiting a schwarzschild black hole. the matter isevolved using a relativistic, lagrangian, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph)treatment. we take as our initial data recent quasiequilibrium models forsynchronized neutron star polytropes generated as solutions of the conformalthin-sandwich (cts) decomposition of the einstein field equations. we are ableto construct from these models relaxed sph configurations whose profiles showgood agreement with cts solutions. our adiabatic evolution calculations forneutron stars with low compactness show that mass transfer, when it beginswhile the neutron star orbit is still outside the innermost stable circularorbit, is more unstable than is typically predicted by analytical formalisms.this dynamical mass loss is found to be the driving force in determining thesubsequent evolution of the binary orbit and the neutron star, which typicallydisrupts completely within a few orbital periods. the majority of the masstransferred onto the black hole is accreted promptly; a significant fraction(~30%) of the mass is shed outward as well, some of which will becomegravitationally unbound and ejected completely from the system. the remainingportion forms an accretion disk around the black hole, and could provide theenergy source for short-duration gamma ray bursts.

astro-ph;0612032	on the rarity of double black hole binaries: consequences for  gravitational-wave detection	double black hole binaries are among the most important sources ofgravitational radiation for ground-based detectors such as ligo or virgo. evenif formed with lower efficiency than double neutron star binaries, they coulddominate the predicted detection rates, since black holes are more massive thanneutron stars and therefore could be detected at greater distances. here wediscuss an evolutionary process that can very significantly limit the formationof close double black hole binaries: the vast majority of their potentialprogenitors undergo a common envelope (ce) phase while the donor, one of themassive binary components, is evolving through the hertzsprung gap. our latesttheoretical understanding of the ce process suggests that this will probablylead to a merger, inhibiting double black hole formation. barring uncertaintiesin the physics of ce evolution, we use population synthesis calculations, andfind that the corresponding reduction in the merger rate of double black holesformed in galactic fields is so great (by ~500) that their contribution toinspiral detection rates for ground-based detectors could become relativelysmall (1 in 10) compared to double neutron star binaries. a similar processalso reduces the merger rates for double neutron stars, by factor of ~5,eliminating most of the previously predicted ultracompact ns-ns systems. ourpredicted detection rates for advanced ligo are now much lower for double blackholes (~2/yr), but are still quite high for double neutron stars (~20/yr). ifdouble black holes were found to be dominant in the detected inspiral signals,this could indicate that they mainly originate from dense star clusters (notincluded here) or that our theoretical understanding of the ce phase requiressignificant revision.

astro-ph;0703163	origins of eccentric extrasolar planets: testing the planet-planet  scattering model	(abridged) in planetary systems with two or more giant planets, dynamicalinstabilities can lead to collisions or ejections through strong planet--planetscattering. previous studies for simple initial configurations with twoequal-mass planets revealed some discrepancies between the results of numericalsimulations and the observed orbital elements of extrasolar planets. here, weshow that simulations with two unequal mass planets starting on nearly circularorbits predict a reduced frequency of collisions and a broader range of finaleccentricities. the two-planet scattering model can easily reproduce theobserved eccentricities with a plausible distribution of planet mass ratios.further, the two-planet scattering model predicts a maximum eccentricity ofabout 0.8, independent of the distribution of planet mass ratios, provided thatboth planets are initially place on nearly circular orbits. this comparesfavorably with current observations and will be tested by future planetdiscoveries. the combination of planet--planet scattering and tidalcircularization may be able to explain the existence of some giant planets withvery short period orbits. orbital migration due to planet scattering could playan important role in explaining the increased rate of giant planets with veryshort period orbits. we also re-examine and discuss various possiblecorrelations between eccentricities and other properties of observed extrasolarplanets. we demonstrate that the observed distribution of planet masses,orbital periods, and eccentricities can provide constraints for models ofplanet formation and evolution.

astro-ph;0703166	dynamical outcomes of planet-planet scattering	observations in the past decade have revealed extrasolar planets with a widerange of orbital semimajor axes and eccentricities. based on the presentunderstanding of planet formation via core accretion and oligarchic growth, weexpect that giant planets often form in closely packed configurations. whilethe protoplanets are embedded in a protoplanetary gas disk, dissipation canprevent eccentricity growth and suppress instabilities from becoming manifest.however, once the disk dissipates, eccentricities can grow rapidly, leading toclose encounters between planets. strong planet--planet gravitationalscattering could produce both high eccentricities and, after tidalcircularization, very short-period planets, as observed in the exoplanetpopulation. we present new results for this scenario based on extensivedynamical integrations of systems containing three giant planets, both with andwithout residual gas disks. we assign the initial planetary masses and orbitsin a realistic manner following the core accretion model of planet formation.we show that, with realistic initial conditions, planet--planet scattering canreproduce quite well the observed eccentricity distribution. our results alsomake testable predictions for the orbital inclinations of short-period giantplanets formed via strong planet scattering followed by tidal circularization.

astro-ph;9506082	the effect of encounters on the eccentricity of binaries in clusters	we derive analytical expressions for the change in the orbital eccentricityof a binary following a distant encounter with a third star on a hyperbolic orparabolic orbit. to establish the accuracy of these expressions, we presentdetailed comparisons with the results of direct numerical integrations of theequations of motion for the three bodies. we treat with particular care thedifficult case of a binary with zero initial eccentricity. in this case, weshow that the eccentricity $\delta e$ induced by the encounter declines ingeneral as a power-law, $\delta e\propto (a/\rp)^{5/2}$, where $a$ is thebinary semi-major axis and $\rp$ is the periastron distance of the encounter.this power-law arises from the octupole-level secular perturbation of thebinary. in contrast, non-secular quadrupole-level perturbations induce aneccentricity change that declines exponentially with $\rp$. these non-seculareffects can become dominant at sufficiently small $\rp$, for a sufficientlyhigh relative velocity, or for a sufficiently massive perturber. we also derivecross sections for eccentricity change and compare our results with those ofprevious studies based on numerical scattering experiments. our results haveimportant implications for a number of astrophysical problems including, inparticular, the evolution of binary millisecond pulsars in globular clusters.

astro-ph;9511054	on the formation and evolution of common envelope systems	we discuss the formation of a common envelope system following dynamicallyunstable mass transfer in a close binary, and the subsequent dynamicalevolution and final fate of the envelope. we base our discussion on newthree-dimensional sph calculations that we have performed for a close binarysystem containing a $4\,m_\odot$ red giant with a $0.7\,m_\odot$ main-sequencestar companion. the initial parameters are chosen to model the formation of asystem resembling v~471~tau, a typical progenitor of a cataclysmic variablebinary. in our highest-resolution calculation, we find evidence for acorotating region of gas around the central binary. this is in agreement withthe theoretical model proposed by meyer \&amp; meyer-hofmeister (1979) for theevolution of common envelope systems, in which this central corotating regionis coupled to the envelope through viscous angular momentum transport only. wealso find evidence that the envelope is convectively unstable, in which casethe viscous dissipation time could be as short as $\sim100$ dynamical times,leading to rapid ejection of the envelope. for v~471~tau, our results, and theobserved parameters of the system, are entirely consistent with rapid envelopeejection on a timescale $\sim1\,$yr and an efficiency parameter$\alpha_{ce}\simeq1$.

astro-ph;9705019	evolution of stellar collision products in globular clusters -- i.  head-on collisions	we explore the evolution of collisionally merged stars in the blue stragglerregion of the hr diagram. the starting models for our stellar evolutioncalculations are the results of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph)simulations of parabolic collisions between main sequence stars performed bylombardi, rasio and shapiro (1996). since sph and stellar evolution codesemploy different and often contradictory approximations, it is necessary totreat the evolution of these products carefully. the mixture and disparity ofthe relevant timescales (hydrodynamic, thermal relaxation and nuclear burning)and of the important physical assumptions between the codes makes the combinedanalysis of the problem challenging, especially during the initial thermalrelaxation of the star. in particular, the treatment of convection isimportant, and semiconvection must be modeled in some detail.  the products of seven head-on collisions are evolved through their initialthermal relaxation, and then through the main sequence phase to the base of thegiant branch. their evolutionary tracks are presented. in contrast to theassumptions in previous work, these collision products do not developsubstantial convective regions during their thermal relaxation, and thereforeare not mixed significantly after the collision.

astro-ph;9911134	formation of short-period binary pulsars in globular clusters	we present a new dynamical scenario for the formation of short-period binarymillisecond pulsars in globular clusters. our work is motivated by the recentobservations of 20 radio pulsars in 47 tuc. in a dense cluster such as 47 tuc,most neutron stars acquire binary companions through exchange interactions withprimordial binaries. the resulting systems have semimajor axes in the range\~0.1-1 au and neutron star companion masses ~1-3 msun. for many of thesesystems we find that, when the companion evolves off the main sequence andfills its roche lobe, the subsequent mass transfer is dynamically unstable.this leads to a common envelope phase and the formation of short-period neutronstar - white dwarf binaries. for a significant fraction of these binaries, thedecay of the orbit due to gravitational radiation will be followed by a periodof stable mass transfer driven by a combination of gravitational radiation andtidal heating of the companion. the properties of the resulting short-periodbinaries match well those of observed binary pulsars in 47 tuc.
