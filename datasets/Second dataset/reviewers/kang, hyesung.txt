0901.1702	self-similar evolution of cosmic-ray modified shocks: the cosmic-ray  spectrum	we use kinetic simulations of diffusive shock acceleration (dsa) to study thetime-dependent evolution of plane, quasi-parallel, cosmic-ray (cr) modifiedshocks. thermal leakage injection of low energy crs and finite alfv\'en wavepropagation and dissipation are included. bohm diffusion as well as thediffusion with the power-law momentum dependence are modeled. as long as theacceleration time scale to relativistic energies is much shorter than thedynamical evolution time scale of the shocks, the precursor and subshocktransition approach the time-asymptotic state, which depends on the shock sonicand alfv\'enic mach numbers and the cr injection efficiency. for the diffusionmodels we employ, the shock precursor structure evolves in an approximatelyself-similar fashion, depending only on the similarity variable, x/(u_s t).during this self-similar stage, the cr distribution at the subshock maintains acharacteristic form as it evolves: the sum of two power-laws with the slopesdetermined by the subshock and total compression ratios with an exponentialcutoff at the highest accelerated momentum, p_{max}(t). based on the results ofthe dsa simulations spanning a range of mach numbers, we suggest functionalforms for the shock structure parameters, from which the aforementioned form ofcr spectrum can be constructed. these analytic forms may represent approximatesolutions to the dsa problem for astrophysical shocks during the self-similarevolutionary stage as well as during the steady-state stage if p_{max} isfixed.

0906.4850	a study of the correlation of arrival directions of uhecrs with the  large scale structure of the universe	ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (uhecrs) are believed to originate fromastrophysical sources, which should trace the large scale structure (lss) ofthe universe. on the other hand, the magnetic field in the intergalactic space(igmf), which also traces the lss of the universe, deflects the trajectories ofthe charged uhecrs and spoils the positional correlation of the observed uhecrevents with their true sources. to explore this problem, we studied asimulation of the propagation of uhe protons through the magnetized lss of theuniverse, reported earlier in das et al.

0704.1521	cosmological shock waves in the large scale structure of the universe:  non-gravitational effects	cosmological shock waves result from supersonic flow motions induced byhierarchical clustering of nonlinear structures in the universe. these shocksgovern the nature of cosmic plasma through thermalization of gas andacceleration of nonthermal, cosmic-ray (cr) particles. we study the statisticsand energetics of shocks formed in cosmological simulations of a concordance$\lambda$cdm universe, with a special emphasis on the effects ofnon-gravitational processes such as radiative cooling, photoionization/heating,and galactic superwind feedbacks. adopting an improved model for gasthermalization and cr acceleration efficiencies based on nonlinear diffusiveshock acceleration calculations, we then estimate the gas thermal energy andthe cr energy dissipated at shocks through the history of the universe. sinceshocks can serve as sites for generation of vorticity, we also examine thevorticity that should have been generated mostly at curved shocks incosmological simulations. we find that the dynamics and energetics of shocksare governed primarily by the gravity of matter, so other non-gravitationalprocesses do not affect significantly the global energy dissipation andvorticity generation at cosmological shocks. our results reinforce scenarios inwhich the intracluster medium and warm-hot intergalactic medium containenergetically significant populations of nonthermal particles and turbulentflow motions.

0910.3361	intergalactic magnetic field and arrival direction of ultra-high-energy  protons	we studied how the intergalactic magnetic field (igmf) affects thepropagation of super-gzk protons that originate from extragalactic sourceswithin the local gzk sphere. toward this end, we set up hypothetical sources ofultra-high-energy cosmic-rays (uhecrs), virtual observers, and the magnetizedcosmic web in a model universe constructed from cosmological structureformation simulations. we then arranged a set of reference objects mimickingactive galactic nuclei (agns) in the local universe, with which correlations ofsimulated uhecr events are analyzed. with our model igmf, the deflection anglebetween the arrival direction of super-gzk protons and the sky position oftheir actual sources is quite large with the mean value of $&lt;\theta &gt; \sim15^{\circ}$ and the median value of $\tilde \theta \sim 7 - 10^{\circ}$. on theother hand, the separation angle between the arrival direction and the skyposition of nearest reference objects is substantially smaller with $&lt;s &gt; \sim3.5 - 4^{\circ}$, which is similar to the mean angular distance in the sky tonearest neighbors among the reference objects. this is a direct consequence ofour model that the sources, observers, reference objects, and the igmf alltrace the matter distribution of the universe. the result implies thatextragalactic objects lying closest to the arrival direction of uhecrs are notnecessary their actual sources. with our model for the distribution ofreference objects, the fraction of super-gzk proton events, whose closest agnsare true sources, is less than 1/3. we discussed implications of our findingsfor correlation studies of real uhecr events.

1003.4386	cosmic ray spectrum in supernova remnant shocks	we perform kinetic simulations of diffusive shock acceleration (dsa) in typeia supernova remnants (snrs) expanding into a uniform interstellar medium(ism). bohm-like diffusion assumed, and simple models for alfvenic drift anddissipation are adopted. phenomenological models for thermal leakage injectionare considered as well. we find that the preshock gas temperature is theprimary parameter that governs the cosmic ray (cr) acceleration efficiency andenergy spectrum, while the cr injection rate is a secondary parameter. for snrsin the warm ism, if the injection fraction is larger than 10^{-4}, the dsa isefficient enough to convert more than 20 % of the sn explosion energy into crsand the accelerated cr spectrum exhibits a concave curvature flattening toe^{-1.6}. such a flat source spectrum near the knee energy, however, may not bereconciled with the cr spectrum observed at earth. on the other hand, snrs inthe hot ism, with an injection fraction smaller than 10^{-4}, are inefficientaccelerators with less than 10 % of the explosion energy getting converted tocrs. also the shock structure is almost test-particle like and the ensuing crspectrum can be steeper than e^{-2}. with amplified magnetic field strength oforder of 30 microg, alfven waves generated by the streaming instability maydrift upstream fast enough to make the modified test-particle power-law assteep as e^{-2.3}, which is more consistent with the observed cr spectrum.

1008.0429	diffusive shock acceleration in test-particle regime	we examine the test-particle solution for diffusive shock acceleration, basedon simple models for thermal leakage injection and alfv'enic drift. thecritical injection rate, \xi_c, above which the cosmic ray (cr) pressurebecomes dynamically significant, depends mainly on the sonic shock mach number,m, and preshock gas temperature, t_1. in the hot-phase interstellar medium(ism) and intracluster medium, \xi_c &lt; 10^{-3} for shocks with m &lt; 5, while\xi_c ~ 10^{-4}(t_1/10^6 k)^{1/2} for shocks with m &gt; 10. for t_1=10^6 k, forexample, the test-particle solution would be valid if the injection momentum,p_{inj} &gt; 3.8 p_{th}. this leads to the postshock cr pressure less than 10% ofthe shock ram pressure. if the alfv'en speed is comparable to the sound speedin the preshock flow, as in the hot-phase ism, the power-law slope of crspectrum can be significantly softer than the canonical test-particle slope.then the cr spectrum at the shock can be approximated by the revisedtest-particle power-law with an exponential cutoff at the highest acceleratedmomentum, p_{max}(t). an analytic form of the exponential cutoff is alsosuggested.

0708.3478	feedback from multiple supernova explosions inside a wind-blown bubble	we study the evolution of multiple supernova (sn) explosions inside apre-exiting cavity blown by winds from massive progenitor stars. hydrodynamicsimulations in one-dimensional spherical geometry, including radiative coolingand thermal conduction, are carried out to follow first the development of thewind-blown bubble during the main sequence and then the evolution of thesn-driven bubble. we find the size and mass of the sn-driven bubble shelldepend on the structure of the pre-existing wind bubble as well as the snexplosion energy e_{sn} (= n_{sn} 10^{51} ergs). the hot cavity inside thebubble is 2-3 times bigger in volume and hotter than that of a bubble createdby sne exploded in a uniform interstellar medium (ism). for an association with10 massive stars in the average ism, the sn-driven shell has an outer radius ofr_{ss} ~ (85 pc) n_{sn}^{0.1} and a mass of m_{ss} ~ (10^{4.8} msun)n_{sn}^{0.3}at 10^6 years after the explosion. by that time most of theexplosion energy is lost via radiative cooling, while ~10% remains as kineticenergy and ~10% as thermal energy. we also calculate the total integratedspectrum of diffuse radiation emitted by the shock-heated gas of the sn bubble.for the models with 0.1 solar metalicity, the radiative energy loss is smallerand the fraction of non-ionizing photons is larger, compared to those withsolar metalicity. we conclude the photoionization/heating by diffuse radiationis the most dominant form of feedback from sn explosions into the surroundingmedium.

1102.2561	re-acceleration of nonthermal particles at weak cosmological shock waves	we examine diffusive shock acceleration (dsa) of the pre-exisiting as well asfreshly injected populations of nonthermal, cosmic-ray (cr) particles at weakcosmological shocks. assuming simple models for thermal leakage injection andalfv\'enic drift, we derive analytic, time-dependent solutions for the twopopulations of crs accelerated in the test-particle regime. we then comparethem with the results from kinetic dsa simulations for shock waves that areexpected to form in intracluster media and cluster outskirts in the course oflarge-scale structure formation. we show that the test-particle solutionsprovide a good approximation for the pressure and spectrum of crs acceleratedat these weak shocks. since the injection is extremely inefficient at weakshocks, the pre-existing cr population dominates over the injected population.if the pressure due to pre-existing cr protons is about 5 % of the gas thermalpressure in the upstream flow, the downstream cr pressure can absorb typicallya few to 10 % of the shock ram pressure at shocks with the mach number $m \la3$. yet, the re-acceleration of cr electrons can result in a substantialsynchrotron emission behind the shock. the enhancement in synchrotron radiationacross the shock is estimated to be about a few to several for $m \sim 1.5$ and$10^2-10^3$ for $m \sim 3$, depending on the detail model parameters. theimplication of our findings for observed bright radio relics is discussed.

1102.3109	energy spectrum of nonthermal electrons accelerated at a plane shock	we calculate the energy spectra of cosmic ray (cr) protons and electrons at aplane shock with quasi-parallel magnetic fields, using time-dependent,diffusive shock acceleration (dsa) simulations, including energy losses viasynchrotron emission and inverse compton (ic) scattering. a thermal leakageinjection model and a bohm type diffusion coefficient are adopted. the electronspectrum at the shock becomes steady after the dsa energy gains balance thesynchrotron/ic losses, and it cuts off at the equilibrium momentum p_{eq}. inthe postshock region the cutoff momentum of the electron spectrum decreaseswith the distance from the shock due to the energy losses and the thickness ofthe spatial distribution of electrons scales as p^{-1}. thus the slope of thedownstream integrated spectrum steepens by one power of p for p_{br}&lt;p&lt;p_{eq},where the break momentum decrease with the shock age as p_{br}\propto t^{-1}.in a cr modified shock, both the proton and electron spectrum exhibit a concavecurvature and deviate from the canonical test-particle power-law, and theupstream integrated electron spectrum could dominate over the downstreamintegrated spectrum near the cutoff momentum. thus the spectral shape near thecutoff of x-ray synchrotron emission could reveal a signature of nonlinear dsa.

1205.1895	diffusive shock acceleration simulations of radio relics	recent radio observations have identified a class of structures, so-calledradio relics, in clusters of galaxies. the radio emission from these sources isinterpreted as synchrotron radiation from gev electrons gyrating inmicrog-level magnetic fields. radio relics, located mostly in the outskirts ofclusters, seem to associate with shock waves, especially those developed duringmergers. in fact, they seem to be good structures to identify and probe suchshocks in intracluster media (icms), provided we understand the electronacceleration and re-acceleration at those shocks. in this paper, we describetime-dependent simulations for diffusive shock acceleration at weak shocks thatare expected to be found in icms. freshly injected as well as pre-existingpopulations of cosmic-ray (cr) electrons are considered, and energy losses viasynchrotron and inverse compton are included. we then compare the synchrotronflux and spectral distributions estimated from the simulations with those intwo well-observed radio relics in ciza j2242.8+5301 and zwcl0008.8+5215.considering that the cr electron injection is rather inefficient at weak shockswith mach number m &lt;~ a few, the existence of radio relics could indicate thepre-existing population of low-energy cr electrons in icms. the implication ofour results on the merger shock scenario of radio relics is discussed.

1209.5203	diffusive shock acceleration with magnetic field amplification and  alfvenic drift	we explore how wave-particle interactions affect diffusive shock acceleration(dsa) at astrophysical shocks by performing time-dependent kinetic simulations,in which phenomenological models for magnetic field amplification (mfa),alfvenic drift, thermal leakage injection, bohm-like diffusion, and a freeescape boundary are implemented. if the injection fraction of cosmic-ray (cr)particles is greater than 2x10^{-4}, for the shock parameters relevant foryoung supernova remnants, dsa is efficient enough to develop a significantshock precursor due to cr feedback, and magnetic field can be amplified up to afactor of 20 via cr streaming instability in the upstream region. if scatteringcenters drift with alfven speed in the amplified magnetic field, the cr energyspectrum can be steepened significantly and the acceleration efficiency isreduced. nonlinear dsa with self-consistent mfa and alfvenic drift predictsthat the postshock cr pressure saturates roughly at 10 % of the shock rampressure for strong shocks with a sonic mach number ranging 20&lt; m_s&lt; 100. sincethe amplified magnetic field follows the flow modification in the precursor,the low energy end of the particle spectrum is softened much more than the highenergy end. as a result, the concave curvature in the energy spectra does notdisappear entirely even with the help of alfvenic drift. for shocks with amoderate alfven mach number (m_a&lt;10), the accelerated cr spectrum can become assteep as e^{-2.1}-e^{-2.3}, which is more consistent with the observed crspectrum and gamma-ray photon spectrum of several young supernova remnants.

0801.0371	propagation of uhe protons through magnetized cosmic web	if ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (uhecrs) originate from extragalacticsources, understanding the propagation of charged particles through themagnetized large scale structure (lss) of the universe is crucial in the searchfor the astrophysical accelerators. based on a novel model of the turbulencedynamo, we estimate the intergalactic magnetic fields (igmfs) in cosmologicalsimulations of the formation of the lss. under the premise that the sources ofuhecrs are strongly associated with the lss, we consider a model in whichprotons with e &gt;10^{19} ev are injected by sources that represent activegalactic nuclei located inside clusters of galaxies. with the model igmfs, wethen follow the trajectories of the protons, while taking into account theenergy losses due to interactions with the cosmic background radiation. forobservers located inside groups of galaxies like ours, about 70% and 35% ofuhecr events above 60 eev arrive within ~15 degree and ~5 degree, respectively,of the source position with time delays of less than ~10^7 yr. this impliesthat the arrival direction of super-gzk protons might exhibit a correlationwith the distribution of cosmological sources on the sky. in this model, nearbysources (within 10 - 20 mpc) should contribute significantly to the particleflux above ~10^{20} ev.

1403.1420	shock waves and cosmic ray acceleration in the outskirts of galaxy  clusters	the outskirts of galaxy clusters are continuously disturbed by mergers andgas infall along filaments, which in turn induce turbulent flow motions andshock waves. we examine the properties of shocks that form within $r_{200}$ insample galaxy clusters from structure formation simulations. while most ofthese shocks are weak and inefficient accelerators of cosmic rays (crs), thereare a number of strong, energetic shocks which can produce large amounts of crprotons via diffusive shock acceleration. we show that the energetic shocksreside mostly in the outskirts and a substantial fraction of them are inducedby infall of the warm-hot intergalactic medium from filaments. as a result, theradial profile of the cr pressure in the intracluster medium is expected to bebroad, dropping off more slowly than that of the gas pressure, and might beeven temporarily inverted, peaking in the outskirts. the volume-integratedmomentum spectrum of cr protons inside $r_{200}$ has the power-law slope of$4.25 - 4.5$, indicating that the average mach number of the shocks of main crproduction is in the range of $\left&lt; m_s \right&gt;_{\rm cr} \approx 3 - 4$. wesuggest that some radio relics with relatively flat radio spectrum could beexplained by primary electrons accelerated by energetic infall shocks with $m_s&gt;~ 3$ induced in the cluster outskirts.

1405.0557	injection of $\kappa$-like suprathermal particles into diffusive shock  acceleration	we consider a phenomenological model for the thermal leakage injection in thediffusive shock acceleration (dsa) process, in which suprathermal protons andelectrons near the shock transition zone are assumed to have the so-called$\kappa$-distributions produced by interactions of background thermal particleswith pre-existing and/or self-excited plasma/mhd waves or turbulence. the$\kappa$-distribution has a power-law tail, instead of an exponential cutoff,well above the thermal peak momentum. so there are a larger number of potentialseed particles with momentum, above that required for participation in the dsaprocess. as a result, the injection fraction for the $\kappa$-distributiondepends on the shock mach number much less severely compared to that for themaxwellian distribution. thus, the existence of $\kappa$-like suprathermaltails at shocks would ease the problem of extremely low injection fractions,especially for electrons and especially at weak shocks such as those found inthe intracluster medium. we suggest that the injection fraction for protonsranges $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ for a $\kappa$-distribution with $10 &lt; \kappa_p &lt; 30$at quasi-parallel shocks, while the injection fraction for electrons becomes$10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ for a $\kappa$-distribution with $\kappa_e &lt; 2$ atquasi-perpendicular shocks. for such $\kappa$ values the ratio of cosmic rayelectrons to protons naturally becomes $k_{e/p}\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$, which isrequired to explain the observed ratio for galactic cosmic rays.

0705.3274	self-similar evolution of cosmic-ray-modified quasi-parallel plane  shocks	using an improved version of the previously introduced crash (cosmic rayacceleration shock) code, we have calculated the time evolution of cosmic-ray(cr) modified quasi-parallel plane shocks for bohm-like diffusion, includingself-consistent models of alfven wave drift and dissipation, along with thermalleakage injection of crs. the new simulations follow evolution of the crdistribution to much higher energies than our previous study, providing abetter examination of evolutionary and asymptotic behaviors. the postshock crpressure becomes constant after quick initial adjustment, since the evolutionof the cr partial pressure expressed in terms of a momentum similarity variableis self-similar. the shock precursor, which scales as the diffusion length ofthe highest energy crs, subsequently broadens approximately linearly with time,independent of diffusion model, so long as crs continue to be accelerated toever-higher energies. this means the nonlinear shock structure can be describedapproximately in terms of the similarity variable, x/(u_s t), where u_s is theshock speed once the postshock pressure reaches an approximate time asymptoticstate. as before, the shock mach number is the key parameter determining theevolution and the cr acceleration efficiency, although finite alfven wave driftand wave energy dissipation in the shock precursor reduce the effectivevelocity change experienced by crs, so reduce acceleration efficiencynoticeably, thus, providing a second important parameter at low and moderatemach numbers.

astro-ph;0005444	properties of cosmic shock waves in large scale structure formation	we have examined the properties of shock waves in simulations of large scalestructure formation for two cosmological scenarios (a scdm and a lcdm withomega =1). large-scale shocks result from accretion onto sheets, filaments andgalaxy clusters (gcs) on a scale of circa 5 mpc/h in both cases. energeticmotions, both residual of past accretion history and due to current asymmetricinflow along filaments, generate additional, common shocks on a scale of about1 mpc/h, which penetrate deep inside gcs. also collisions between substructuresinside gcs form merger shocks. consequently, the topology of the shocks is verycomplex and highly connected. during cosmic evolution the comoving shocksurface density decreases, reflecting the ongoing structure merger process inboth scenarios. accretion shocks have very high mach numbers (10-10^3), whenphoto-heating of the pre-shock gas is not included. the typical shock speed isof order v_{sh}(z) =h(z)lambda_{nl}(z), with lambda_{nl}(z) the wavelengthscale of the nonlinear perturbation at the given epoch. however, the machnumber for shocks occuring within clusters is usually smaller (3-10), due tothe fact that the intracluster gas is already hot. statistical fits of shockspeed around gcs as a function of gcs temperature give power-law's in accordwith 1-d predictions. however, a very different result is obtained for fits ofthe shock radius, reflecting the very complex shock structures forming in 3-dsimulations. the in-flowing kinetic energy across such shocks, giving the poweravailable for cosmic-ray acceleration, is comparable to the cluster x-rayluminosity emitted from a central region of radius 0.5 mpc/h. considering theirlarge size and long lifetimes, those shocks are potentially interesting sitesfor cosmic-ray acceleration, if modest magnetic fields exist within them.

astro-ph;0011058	time dependent cosmic-ray shock acceleration with self-consistent  injection	one of the key questions to understanding the efficiency of diffusive shockacceleration of the cosmic rays (crs) is the injection process from thermalparticles. a self-consistent injection model based on the interactions of thesuprathermal particles with self-generated magneto-hydrodynamic waves has beendeveloped recently by malkov (1998, phys. rev. e 58, 4911). by adopting thisanalytic solution, a numerical treatment of the plasma-physical injection modelat a strong quasi-parallel shock has been devised and incorporated into thecombined gas dynamics and the cr diffusion-convection code. in order toinvestigate self-consistently the injection and acceleration efficiencies, wehave applied this code to the cr modified shocks of both high and low machnumbers (m=30 and m=2.24) with a bohm type diffusion model. we find theinjection process is self-regulated in such a way that the injection ratereaches and stays at a nearly stable value after quick initial adjustment. forboth shocks about 0.1% of the incoming thermal particles are injected into thecrs. for the weak shock, the shock has reached a steady state within ourintegration time and about 10% of the total available shock energy istransfered into the cr energy density. the strong shock has achieved a higheracceleration efficiency of about 20% by the end of our simulation, but has notyet reached a steady-state.

astro-ph;0105465	cosmic ray protons accelerated at cosmological shocks and their impact  on groups and clusters of galaxies	we investigate the production of cosmic ray (cr) protons at cosmologicalshocks by performing, for the first time, numerical simulations of large scalestructure formation that include directly the acceleration, transport andenergy losses of the high energy particles. crs are injected at shocksaccording to the thermal leakage model and, thereafter, accelerated to apower-law distribution as indicated by the test particle limit of the diffusiveshock acceleration theory. the evolution of the cr protons accounts for lossesdue to adiabatic expansion/compression, coulomb collisions and inelastic p-pscattering. our results suggest that cr protons produced at shocks formed inassociation with the process of large scale structure formation could amount toa substantial fraction of the total pressure in the intra-cluster medium. theirpresence should be easily revealed by glast through detection of gamma-ray fluxfrom the decay of neutral pions produced in inelastic p-p collisions of such crprotons with nuclei of the intra-cluster gas. this measurement will allow adirect determination of the cr pressure contribution in the intra-clustermedium. we also find that the spatial distribution of cr is typically moreirregular than that of the thermal gas because it is more influenced by theunderlying distribution of shocks. this feature is reflected in the appearanceof our gamma-ray synthetic images. finally, the average cr pressuredistribution appears statistically slightly more extended than the thermalpressure.

astro-ph;0207410	numerical studies of cosmic ray injection and acceleration	a numerical scheme that incorporates a thermal leakage injection model into acombined gas dynamics and cosmic ray (cr, hereafter) diffusion-convection codehas been developed. the particle injection is followed numerically by filteringthe diffusive flux of suprathermal particles across the shock to the upstreamregion according to a velocity-dependent transparency function that controlsthe fraction of leaking particles. we have studied cr injection andacceleration efficiencies during the evolution of cr modified planar shocks fora wide range of initial shock mach numbers, $m_0$, assuming a bohm-likediffusion coefficient. the injection process is very efficient when thesubshock is strong, leading to fast and significant modification of the shockstructure. as the cr pressure increases, the subshock weakens and the injectionrate decreases accordingly, so that the subshock does not disappear. althoughsome fraction of the particles injected early in the evolution continue to beaccelerated to ever higher energies, the postshock cr pressure reaches anapproximate time-asymptotic value due to a balance between freshinjection/acceleration and advection/diffusion of the cr particles away fromthe shock. we conclude that the injection rates in strong parallel shocks aresufficient to lead to rapid nonlinear modifications to the shock structures andthat self-consistent injection and time-dependent simulations are crucial tounderstanding the non-linear evolution of cr modified shocks.

astro-ph;0211179	two-dimensional axisymmetric collapse of thermally unstable primordial  clouds	we have performed two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the collapse ofisolated axisymmetric clouds condensing via radiative cooling in a primordialbackground gas. in order to study the development of the so-called``shape-instability'', we have considered two types of axisymmetric clouds,oblate and prolate clouds of various sizes and with axial ratios of $0.5 \leq{r_{\rm c,r}} /{r_{\rm c,z}} \leq 2$. we find that the degree of oblateness orprolateness is enhanced during the initial cooling phase. but it can bereversed later, if the initial contrast in cooling times between the cloud gasand the background gas is much greater than one. in such cases an oblate cloudcollapses to a structure composed of an outer thin disk and a central prolatecomponent. a prolate cloud, on the other hand, becomes a thin cigar-shapestructure with a central dense oblate component. the reversal of shape in thecentral part of the cooled clouds is due to supersonic motions either along thedisk plane in the case of oblate clouds or along the symmetry axis in the caseof prolate clouds. for a background gas of $t_h=1.7\times 10^6$k and $n_h=0.1\cm3$ in a protogalactic halo environment, the mean density of the cloud gasthat has cooled to $10^4$k increases to $100 n_h$ or so, in our simulationswhere nonequilibrium cooling is adopted and the background gas cools too. thespherical jeans mass of such gas is estimated to be about $m_j \sim5\times10^{7}\msun$. in order for cloud mass to exceed the jeans mass and atthe same time in order for the thermal instability to operate, the initialcloud size should be around $1 - 1.5 l_{\rm cool}$ where $l_{\rm cool}$ is thecooling length.

astro-ph;0211216	cosmic rays in clusters of galaxies	we argue that clusters of galaxies have an intergalactic medium, which ispermeated by strong magnetic fields and also has a contribution of pressurefrom cosmic rays. these two components of total pressure are probably highlytime dependent, and range probably between 1/10 of the gas pressure up toequipartition between gas pressure and the sum of the two other components.radio galaxies are likely to provide the main source for both magnetic fieldsand cosmic rays. in this concept it becomes easy to understand the occasionalmismatch between the total mass inferred from the assumption of hydrostaticequilibrium derived purely from gas, and the total mass derived from lensingdata. we also suggest that the structure and topology of the magnetic field maybe highly inhomogeneous - at least over a certain range of scales, and maycontain long twisted filaments of strong magnetic fields, as on the sun. theanalogy with the interstellar medium may be fruitful to explore further, wherewe do not know where magnetic fields come from, but suspect that the cosmicrays derive from supernova explosions. in such an analogy it becomes useful torefer to "radio galaxy explosions" in clusters of galaxies. a full scaleexploration of all the implications, especially of the notion that occasionallycomplete equipartition may be reached, is a task for the future.

astro-ph;0211360	acceleration of cosmic rays at large scale cosmic shocks in the universe	cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of large scale structure in theuniverse have shown that accretion shocks and merger shocks form due to flowmotions associated with the gravitational collapse of nonlinear structures.estimated speed and curvature radius of these shocks could be as large as a few1000 km/s and several mpc, respectively. according to the diffusive shockacceleration theory, populations of cosmic-ray particles can be injected andaccelerated to very high energy by astrophysical shocks in tenuous plasmas. inorder to explore the cosmic ray acceleration at the cosmic shocks, we haveperformed nonlinear numerical simulations of cosmic ray (cr) modified shockswith the newly developed crash (cosmic ray amr shock) numerical code. weadopted the bohm diffusion model for crs, based on the hypothesis that strongalfv\'en waves are self-generated by streaming crs. the shock formationsimulation includes a plasma-physics-based ``injection'' model that transfers asmall proportion of the thermal proton flux through the shock into low energycrs for acceleration there. we found that, for strong accretion shocks, crs canabsorb most of shock kinetic energy and the accretion shock speed is reduced upto 20 %, compared to pure gas dynamic shocks. for merger shocks with small machnumbers, however, the energy transfer to crs is only about 10-20 % with anassociated cr particle fraction of $10^{-3}$. nonlinear feedback due to the crpressure is insignificant in the latter shocks. although detailed resultsdepend on models for the particle diffusion and injection, these calculationsshow that cosmic shocks in large scale structure could provide accelerationsites of extragalactic cosmic rays of the highest energy.

astro-ph;0211365	clusters of galaxies: shock waves and cosmic rays	recent observations of galaxy clusters in radio and x-ray indicate thatcosmic rays and magnetic fields may be energetically important in theintracluster medium. according to the estimates based on theses observationalstudies, the combined pressure of these two components of the intraclustermedium may range between $10% \sim 100 %$ of gas pressure, although their totalenergy is probably time dependent. hence, these non-thermal components may haveinfluenced the formation and evolution of cosmic structures, and may provideunique and vital diagnostic information through various radiations emitted viatheir interactions with surrounding matter and cosmic background photons. wesuggest that shock waves associated with cosmic structures, along withindividual sources such as active galactic nuclei and radio galaxies, supplythe cosmic rays and magnetic fields to the intracluster medium and tosurrounding large scale structures. in order to study 1) the properties ofcosmic shock waves emerging during the large scale structure formation of theuniverse, and 2) the dynamical influence of cosmic rays, which were ejected byagn-like sources into the intracluster medium, on structure formation, we haveperformed two sets of n-body/hydrodynamic simulations of cosmic structureformation. in this contribution, we report the preliminary results of thesesimulations.

astro-ph;0303404	acceleration of cosmic rays at cosmic shocks	nonthermal particles can be produced due to incomplete thermalization atcollisionless shocks and further accelerated to very high energies viadiffusive shock acceleration. in a previous study we explored the cosmic ray(cr) acceleration at cosmic shocks through numerical simulations of crmodified, quasi-parallel shocks in 1d plane-parallel geometry with the physicalparameters relevant for the shocks emerging in the large scale structureformation of the universe (kang &amp; jones 2002). in order to consider the cracceleration at shocks with a broader range of physical properties, in thiscontribution we present additional simulations. for a given mach number, shockswith higher speeds accelerate crs faster with a greater number of particles.however, two shocks with a same mach number but with different shock speedsevolve qualitatively similarly when the results are presented in terms ofdiffusion length and time scales. therefore, the time asymptotic value for thefraction of shock kinetic energy transferred to crs is mainly controlled byshock mach number rather than shock speed. we present the ``cr energy ratio''for a wide range of shock parameters and for $\epsilon=0.2-0.3$ at terminaltime of our simulations. we suggest that these values can be considered astime-asymptotic values for the cr acceleration efficiency, since thetime-dependent evolution of cr modified shocks has become approximatelyself-similar before the terminal time.

astro-ph;0305164	cosmological shock waves and their role in the large scale structure of  the universe	we study the properties of cosmological shock waves identified inhigh-resolution, n-body/hydrodynamic simulations of a $\lambda$cdm universe andtheir role on thermalization of gas and acceleration of nonthermal, cosmic ray(cr) particles. external shocks form around sheets, filaments and knots of massdistribution when the gas in void regions accretes onto them. within thosenonlinear structures, internal shocks are produced by infall of previouslyshocked gas to filaments and knots, and during subclump mergers, as well as bychaotic flow motions. due to the low temperature of the accreting gas, the machnumber of external shocks is high, extending up to $m\sim 100$ or higher. incontrast, internal shocks have mostly low mach numbers. for all shocks of$m\ge1.5$ the mean distance between shock surfaces over the entire computedvolume is $\sim4 h^{-1}$ mpc at present, or $\sim 1 h^{-1}$ mpc for internalshocks within nonlinear structures. identified external shocks are moreextensive, with their surface area $\sim2$ times larger than that of identifiedinternal shocks at present. however, especially because of higher preshockdensities, but also due to higher shock speeds, internal shocks dissipate moreenergy. hence, the internal shocks are mainly responsible for gasthermalization as well as cr acceleration. in fact, internal shocks with $2 \lam \la 4$ contribute $\sim 1/2$ of the total dissipation. using a nonlineardiffusive shock acceleration model for cr protons, we estimate the ratio of crenergy to gas thermal energy dissipated at cosmological shock waves to be$\sim1/2$ through the history of the universe. our result supports scenarios inwhich the intracluster medium contains energetically significant populations ofcrs.

astro-ph;0604536	effects of rotation on thermal-gravitational instability in the  protogalactic disk environment	thermal-gravitational instability (tgi) is studied in the protogalacticenvironment. we extend our previous work, where we found that dense clumpsfirst form out of hot background gas by thermal instability and later a smallfraction of them grow to virialized clouds of mass m_c &gt;~ 6x10^6 m_sun bygravitational infall and merging. but these clouds have large angular momentum,so they would be difficult, if not impossible, to further evolve into globularclusters. in this paper, through three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations ina uniformly rotating frame, we explore if the coriolis force due to rotation inprotogalactic disk regions can hinder binary merging and reduce angularmomentum of the clouds formed. with rotation comparable to the galacticrotation at the solar circle, the coriolis force is smaller than the pressureforce during the early thermal instability stage. so the properties of clumpsformed by thermal instability are not affected noticeably by rotation, exceptincreased angular momentum. however, during later stage the coriolis forcebecomes dominant over the gravity, and hence the further growth togravitationally bound clouds by gravitational infall and merging is prohibited.our results show that the coriolis force effectively destroys the picture ofcloud formation via tgi, rather than alleviate the problem of large angularmomentum.

astro-ph;9512101	supersonic collisions between two gas streams	a star around a massive black hole can be disrupted tidally by the gravity ofthe black hole. then, its debris may form a precessing stream which may evencollide with itself. in order to understand the dynamical effects of thestream-stream collision on the eventual accretion of the stellar debris ontothe black hole, we have studied how gas flow behaves when the outgoing streamcollides supersonically with the incoming stream. we have investigated theproblem analytically with one-dimensional plane-parallel streams andnumerically with more realistic three-dimensional streams. a shock formedaround the contact surface converts the bulk of the orbital streaming kineticenergy into thermal energy. in three-dimensional simulations, the accumulatedhot post-shock gas then expands adiabatically and drives another shock into thelow density ambient region. through this expansion, thermal energy is convertedback to the kinetic energy associated with the expanding motion. thus, in theend, only a small fraction of the orbital kinetic energy is actually convertedto the thermal energy, while most of it is transferred to the kinetic energy ofthe expanding gas. nevertheless the collision is effective in circularizing thedebris orbit, because the shock efficiently transforms the ordered motion ofthe streams into the expanding motion in directions perpendicular to thestreams. the circularization efficiency decreases, if two colliding streamshave a large ratio of cross sections and a large density contrast. but even insuch cases, the main shock extends beyond the overlapping contact surface andthe high pressure region behind the shock keeps the stream of the larger crosssection from passing freely. thus the stream-stream collisions are stillexpected to circularize the stellar debris rather efficiently, unless the ratio

astro-ph;9608071	contributions to the cosmic ray flux above the ankle: clusters of  galaxies	motivated by the suggestion of kang, ryu \&amp; jones (1996) that particles canbe accelerated to high energies via diffusive shock acceleration process at theaccretion shocks formed by the infalling flow toward the clusters of galaxies,we have calculated the expected particle flux from a cosmological ensemble ofclusters. we use the observed temperature distribution of local clusters andassume a simple power-law evolutionary model for the comoving density of theclusters. the shock parameters such as the shock radius and velocity arededuced from the icm temperature using the self-similar solutions for secondaryinfall onto the clusters. the magnetic field strength is assume to be inequipartition with the postshock thermal energy behind the accretion shock. wealso assume that the injected energy spectrum is a power-law with theexponential cutoff at the maximum energy which is calculated from the conditionthat the energy gain rate for diffusive shock acceleration is balanced by theloss rate due to the interactions with the cosmic background radiation. incontrast to the earlier paper we have adopted here the description of thecosmic ray diffusion by jokipii (1987) which leads to considerably higherparticle energies. finally the injected particle spectrum at the clusters isintegrated over the cosmological distance to earth by considering the energyloss due to the interactions with the cosmic background radiation. ourcalculations show that the expected spectrum of high-energy protons from thecosmological ensemble of the cluster accretion shocks could match well theobserved cosmic ray spectrum near $10^{19}$ev with reasonable parameters andmodels if about $10^{-4}$ of the infalling kinetic energy can be injected intothe intergalactic space as the high energy particles.

astro-ph;9709250	the supergalactic structure and the origin of the highest energy cosmic  rays	the recent discoveries of several reliable events of high energy cosmic raysat an energy above 10^20 ev raise questions about their path through the nearbyuniverse. the two analyses of the haverah park data set and the akeno data setappear to have an inconsistent pattern. both data sets showed some measure of acorrelation with the supergalactic plane, the locus of cosmologically nearbygalaxies, radio galaxies and clusters of galaxies. we need a reasonable modelof the true intergalactic magnetic field. using recent cosmological simulationsof structure formation in the universe, we estimate the magnetic fields whichcorrespond to the upper limits in the rotation measure to distant radiosources. we estimate that the magnetic field strength in supergalactic sheetsand filaments may be in the range of 0.1 to 1 mug. if such strengths arerealized inside our local supercluster, this opens up the possibility to focuscharged particles in the direction perpendicular to the supergalatic plane,analoguously but in the opposite direction to solar wind modulation. iffocusing exists, it means that for all particles captured into the sheets, thedilution with distance d is 1/d instead of 1/d^2. this means in effect, that wemay see sources to much larger distances than expected sofar. this effect isrelevant only for energies for which the possible distances are smaller thanthe void scale of the cosmological galaxy distribution, in the range possiblyup to 100 mpc.

astro-ph;9709252	cosmic structure of magnetic fields	the simulations of the formation of cosmological structure allows todetermine the spatial inhomogeneity of cosmic magnetic fields. suchsimulations, however, do not give an absolute number for the strength of themagnetic field due to insufficient spatial resolution. combining thesesimulations with observations of the rotation measure to distant radio sourcesallows then to deduce upper limits for the strength of the magnetic field.these upper limits are of order 0.2 - 2 mug along the filaments and sheets ofthe galaxy distribution. in one case, the sheet outside the coma cluster, thereis a definitive estimate of the strength of the magnetic field consistent withthis range. such estimates are almost three orders of magnitude higher thanhitherto assumed usually. high energy cosmic ray particles can be eitherfocussed or strongly scattered in such magnetic filaments and sheets, dependingon the initial transverse momentum. the cosmological background in radio andx-ray wavelengths will have contributions from these intergalactic filamentsand sheets, should the magnetic fields really be as high as 0.2 - 2 mug.

astro-ph;9710227	$10^{51}$ ergs: the evolution of shell supernova remnants	this paper reports on a workshop hosted by the university of minnesota, march23-26, 1997. it addressed fundamental dynamical issues associated with theevolution of shell supernova remnants and the relationships between supernovaremnants and their environments. the workshop considered, in addition toclassical shell snrs, dynamical issues involving x-ray filled compositeremnants and pulsar driven shells, such as that in the crab nebula.approximately 75 participants with wide ranging interests attended theworkshop. an even larger community helped through extensive on-line debatesprior to the meeting. each of the several sessions, organized mostly aroundchronological labels, also addressed some underlying, general physical themes:how are snr dynamics and structures modified by the character of the csm andthe ism and vice versa? how are magnetic fields generated in snrs and how domagnetic fields influence snrs? where and how are cosmic-rays (electrons andions) produced in snrs and how does their presence influence or reveal snrdynamics? how does snr blast energy partition into various components over timeand what controls conversion between components? in lieu of a proceedingsvolume, we present here a synopsis of the workshop in the form of briefsummaries of the workshop sessions. the sharpest impressions from the workshopwere the crucial and under-appreciated roles that environments have on snrappearance and dynamics and the critical need for broad-based studies tounderstand these beautiful, but enigmatic objects. \\

astro-ph;9803275	cosmic magnetic fields in large scale filaments and sheets	we consider the possibility that cosmic magnetic field, instead of beinguniformly distributed, is strongly correlated with the large scale structure ofthe universe. then, the observed rotational measure of extra-galactic radiosources would be caused mostly by the clumpy magnetic field in cosmologicalfilaments/sheets rather than by a uniform magnetic field, which was oftenassumed in previous studies. as a model for the inhomogeneity of thecosmological magnetic field, we adopt a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation,where the field is passively included, and can approximately represent the realfield distribution with an arbitrary normalization for the field strength.then, we derive an upper limit of the magnetic field strength by comparing theobserved limit of rotational measure with the rotational measure expected fromthe magnetic field geometry in the simulated model universe. the resultingupper limit to the magnetic field in filaments and sheets is ${\bar b}_{fs} \la1 \mu g$ which is $\sim10^3$ times higher than the previously quoted values.this value is close to, but larger than, the equipartition magnetic fieldstrength in filaments and sheets. the amplification mechanism of the magneticfield to the above strength is uncertain. the implications of such a strengthof the cosmic magnetic field are discussed.
