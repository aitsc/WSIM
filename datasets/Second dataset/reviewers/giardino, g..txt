1001.2657	planck pre-launch status: the planck-lfi programme	this paper provides an overview of the low frequency instrument (lfi)programme within the esa planck mission. the lfi instrument has been developedto produce high precision maps of the microwave sky at frequencies in the range27-77 ghz, below the peak of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) radiationspectrum. the scientific goals are described, ranging from fundamentalcosmology to galactic and extragalactic astrophysics. the instrument design anddevelopment are outlined, together with the model philosophy and testingstrategy. the instrument is presented in the context of the planck mission. thelfi approach to ground and inflight calibration is described. we also describethe lfi ground segment. we present the results of a number of testsdemonstrating the capability of the lfi data processing centre (dpc) toproperly reduce and analyse lfi flight data, from telemetry information tocalibrated and cleaned time ordered data, sky maps at each frequency (intemperature and polarization), component emission maps (cmb and diffuseforegrounds), catalogs for various classes of sources (the early releasecompact source catalogue and the final compact source catalogue). theorganization of the lfi consortium is briefly presented as well as the role ofthe core team in data analysis and scientific exploitation. all tests carriedout on the lfi flight model demonstrate the excellent performance of theinstrument and its various subunits. the data analysis pipeline has been testedand its main steps verified. in the first three months after launch, thecommissioning, calibration, performance, and verification phases will becompleted, after which planck will begin its operational life, in which lfiwill have an integral part.

1101.2023	planck early results. ii. the thermal performance of planck	the performance of the planck instruments in space is enabled by their lowoperating temperatures, 20k for lfi and 0.1k for hfi, achieved through acombination of passive radiative cooling and three active mechanical coolers.the scientific requirement for very broad frequency coverage led to twodetector technologies with widely different temperature and cooling needs.active coolers could satisfy these needs; a helium cryostat, as used byprevious cryogenic space missions (iras, cobe, iso, spitzer, akari), could not.radiative cooling is provided by three v-groove radiators and a large telescopebaffle. the active coolers are a hydrogen sorption cooler (&lt;20k), a 4hejoule-thomson cooler (4.7k), and a 3he-4he dilution cooler (1.4k and 0.1k). theflight system was at ambient temperature at launch and cooled in space tooperating conditions. the hfi bolometer plate reached 93mk on 3 july 2009, 50days after launch. the solar panel always faces the sun, shadowing the rest ofplanck, andoperates at a mean temperature of 384k. at the other end of thespacecraft, the telescope baffle operates at 42.3k and the telescope primarymirror operates at 35.9k. the temperatures of key parts of the instruments arestabilized by both active and passive methods. temperature fluctuations aredriven by changes in the distance from the sun, sorption cooler cycling andfluctuations in gas-liquid flow, and fluctuations in cosmic ray flux on thedilution and bolometer plates. these fluctuations do not compromise the sciencedata.

1101.2024	planck early results viii: the all-sky early sunyaev-zeldovich cluster  sample	we present the first all-sky sample of galaxy clusters detected blindly bythe planck satellite through the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect from its sixhighest frequencies. this early sz (esz) sample is comprised of 189 candidates,which have a high signal-to-noise ratio ranging from 6 to 29. its highreliability (purity above 95%) is further ensured by an extensive validationprocess based on planck internal quality assessments and by externalcross-identification and follow-up observations. planck provides the firstmeasured sz signal for about 80% of the 169 previously-known esz clusters.planck furthermore releases 30 new cluster candidates, amongst which 20 meetthe esz signal-to-noise selection criterion. at the submission date, twelve ofthe 20 esz candidates were confirmed as new clusters, with eleven confirmedusing xmm-newton snapshot observations, most of them with disturbedmorphologies and low luminosities. the esz clusters are mostly at moderateredshifts (86% with z below 0.3) and span more than a decade in mass, up to therarest and most massive clusters with masses above 10^15 msol.

1101.2025	planck early results. ix. xmm-newton follow-up for validation of planck  cluster candidates	we present the xmm-newton follow-up for confirmation of planck clustercandidates. twenty-five candidates have been observed to date using snapshot(~10 ksec) exposures, ten as part of a pilot programme to sample a low range ofsignal-to-noise ratios (4&lt;s/n&lt;6), and a further 15 in a programme to observe asample of s/n&gt;5 candidates. the sensitivity and spatial resolution ofxmm-newton allows unambiguous discrimination between clusters and falsecandidates. the 4 false candidates have s/n &lt;= 4.1. a total of 21 candidatesare confirmed as extended x-ray sources. seventeen are single clusters, themajority of which are found to have highly irregular and disturbed morphologies(about ~70%). the remaining four sources are multiple systems, including theunexpected discovery of a supercluster at z=0.45. for 20 sources we are able toderive a redshift estimate from the x-ray fe k line (albeit of variablequality). the new clusters span the redshift range 0.09 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.54, with amedian redshift of z~0.37. a first determination is made of their x-rayproperties including the characteristic size, which is used to improve theestimate of the sz compton parameter, y_sz. the follow-up validation programmehas helped to optimise the planck candidate selection process. it has alsoprovided a preview of the x-ray properties of these newly-discovered clusters,allowing comparison with their sz properties, and to the x-ray and szproperties of known clusters observed in the planck survey. our results suggestthat planck may have started to reveal a non-negligible population of massivedynamically perturbed objects that is under-represented in x-ray surveys.however, despite their particular properties, these new clusters appear tofollow the y_sz-y_x relation established for x-ray selected objects, where y_xis the product of the gas mass and temperature.

1101.2027	planck early results: cluster sunyaev-zeldovich optical scaling  relations	we present the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal-to-richness scaling relation(y500-n200) for the maxbcg cluster catalogue. employing a multi-frequencymatched filter on the planck sky maps, we measure the sz signal for eachcluster by adapting the filter according to weak-lensing calibratedmass-richness relations (n200-m500). we bin our individual measurements anddetect the sz signal down to the lowest richness systems (n200=10) with highsignificance, achieving a detection of the sz signal in systems with mass aslow as m500~5e13 msolar. the observed y500-n200 relation is well modeled by apower law over the full richness range. it has a lower normalisation at givenn200 than predicted based on x-ray models and published mass-richnessrelations. an x-ray subsample, however, does conform to the predicted scaling,and model predictions do reproduce the relation between our measuredbin-average sz signal and measured bin-average x-ray luminosities. at fixedrichness, we find an intrinsic dispersion in the y500-n200 relation of 60%rising to of order 100% at low richness. thanks to its all-sky coverage, planckprovides observations for more than 13,000 maxbcg clusters and an unprecedentedsz/optical data set, extending the list of known cluster scaling laws toinclude sz-optical properties. the data set offers essential clues for modelsof galaxy formation. moreover, the lower normalisation of the sz-mass relationimplied by the observed sz-richness scaling has important consequences forcluster physics and cosmological studies with sz clusters.

1101.2028	planck early results xviii: the power spectrum of cosmic infrared  background anisotropies	using planck maps of six regions of low galactic dust emission with a totalarea of about 140 square degrees, we determine the angular power spectra ofcosmic infrared background (cib) anisotropies from multipole l = 200 to l =2000 at 217, 353, 545 and 857 ghz. we use 21-cm observations of hi as a tracerof thermal dust emission to reduce the already low level of galactic dustemission and use the 143 ghz planck maps in these fields to clean out cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies. both of these cleaning processes arenecessary to avoid significant contamination of the cib signal. we measurecorrelated cib structure across frequencies. as expected, the correlationdecreases with increasing frequency separation, because the contribution ofhigh-redshift galaxies to cib anisotropies increases with wavelengths. we findno significant difference between the frequency spectrum of the cibanisotropies and the cib mean, with delta i/i=15% from 217 to 857 ghz. in termsof clustering properties, the planck data alone rule out the linear scale- andredshift-independent bias model. non-linear corrections are significant.consequently, we develop an alternative model that couples a dusty galaxy,parametric evolution model with a simple halo-model approach. it provides anexcellent fit to the measured anisotropy angular power spectra and suggeststhat a different halo occupation distribution is required at each frequency,which is consistent with our expectation that each frequency is dominated bycontributions from different redshifts. in our best-fit model, half of theanisotropy power at l=2000 comes from redshifts z&lt;0.8 at 857 ghz and z&lt;1.5 at545 ghz, while about 90% come from redshifts z&gt;2 at 353 and 217 ghz,respectively.

1101.2031	planck early results. xx. new light on anomalous microwave emission from  spinning dust grains	anomalous microwave emission (ame) has been observed by numerous experimentsin the frequency range ~10-60 ghz. using planck maps and multi-frequencyancillary data, we have constructed spectra for two known ame regions: theperseus and rho ophiuchi molecular clouds. the spectra are well fitted by acombination of free-free radiation, cosmic microwave background, thermal dust,and electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. the spinningdust spectra are the most precisely measured to date, and show the highfrequency side clearly for the first time. the spectra have a peak in the range20-40 ghz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for perseus and8.4 sigma for rho ophiuchi. in perseus, spinning dust in the dense moleculargas can account for most of the ame; the low density atomic gas appears to playa minor role. in rho ophiuchi, the ~30 ghz peak is dominated by dense moleculargas, but there is an indication of an extended tail at frequencies 50-100 ghz,which can be accounted for by irradiated low density atomic gas. the dustparameters are consistent with those derived from other measurements. we havealso searched the planck map at 28.5 ghz for candidate ame regions, bysubtracting a simple model of the synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust. wepresent spectra for two of the candidates; s140 and s235 are bright hii regionsthat show evidence for ame, and are well fitted by spinning dust models.

1101.2032	planck early results. xxi. properties of the interstellar medium in the  galactic plane	(abridged) planck has observed the entire sky from 30 ghz to 857ghz. theobserved foreground emission contains contributions from different phases ofthe interstellar medium (ism). we have separated the observed galactic emissioninto the different gaseous components (atomic, molecular and ionised) in eachof a number of galactocentric rings. templates are created for variousgalactocentric radii using velocity information from atomic (neutral hydrogen)and molecular (12co) observations. the ionised template is assumed to be tracedby free-free emission as observed by wmap, while 408 mhz emission is used totrace the synchrotron component. gas emission not traced by the abovetemplates, namely "ark gas", as evidenced using planck data, is included as anadditional template, the first time such a component has been used in this way.these templates are then correlated with each of the planck frequency bands, aswell as other ancillary data. the emission per column density of the gastemplates allows us to create distinct spectral energy distributions (seds) pergalactocentric ring and in each of the gaseous tracers from 1.4 ghz to 25 thz(12\mu m). apart from the thermal dust and free-free emission, we have probedthe galaxy for anomalous (e.g., spinning) dust as well as synchrotron emission.we show that anomalous dust emission is present in the atomic, molecular anddark gas phases throughout the galactic disk. the derived dust propetiesassociated with the dark gas phase are derived but do not allow us to revealthe nature of this phase. for all environments, the anomalous emission isconsistent with rotation from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and,according to our simple model, accounts for $(25\pm5)%$ (statistical) of thetotal emission at 30 ghz.

1101.2035	planck early results: the galactic cold core population revealed by the  first all-sky survey	we present the statistical properties of the first version of the cold corecatalogue of planck objects (c3po), in terms of their spatial distribution,temperature, distance, mass, and morphology. we also describe the statistics ofthe early cold core catalogue (ecc, delivered with the early release compactsource catalogue, ercsc) that is the subset of the 915 most reliable detectionsof the complete catalogue. we have used the cococodet algorithm to extract10783 cold sources. temperature and dust emission spectral index {\beta} valuesare derived using the fluxes in the iras 100 \mum band and the three highestfrequency planck bands. temperature spans from 7k to 17k, and peaks around 13k.data are not consistent with a constant value of {\beta} over the alltemperature range. {\beta} ranges from 1.4 to 2.8 with a mean value around 2.1,and several possible scenarios are possible, including {\beta}(t) and theeffect of multiple t components folded into the measurements. for one third ofthe objects the distances are obtained. most of the detections are within 2 kpcin the solar neighbourhood, but a few are at distances greater than 4 kpc. thecores are distributed from the deep galactic plane, despite the confusion, tohigh latitudes (&gt;30$^{\circle}$). the associated mass estimates range from 1 to$10^5$ solar masses. using their physical properties these cold sources areshown to be cold clumps, defined as the intermediate cold sub-structuresbetween clouds and cores. these cold clumps are not isolated but mostlyorganized in filaments associated with molecular clouds. the cold corecatalogue of planck objects (c3po) is the first unbiased all-sky catalogue ofcold objects. it gives an unprecedented statistical view to the properties ofthese potential pre-stellar clumps and offers a unique possibility for theirclassification in terms of their intrinsic properties and environment.

1101.2036	planck early results xxiv: dust in the diffuse interstellar medium and  the galactic halo	this paper presents the first results of comparison of planck along with irasdata with green bank telescope 21-cm observations in 14 fields covering morethan 800 square degrees at high galactic latitude. galactic dust emission forfields with average hi column density lower than 2 x 10^20 cm^-2 is wellcorrelated with 21-cm emission. the residual emission in these fields, once thehi-correlated emission is removed, is consistent with the expected statisticalproperties of the cosmic infrared background fluctuations. fields with largercolumn densities show significant excess dust emission compared to the hicolumn density. regions of excess lie in organized structures that suggest thepresence of hydrogen in molecular form, though they are not always correlatedwith co emission. dust emission from intermediate-velocity clouds is detectedwith high significance. its spectral properties are consistent with, comparedto the local ism values, significantly hotter dust (t~20 k), lowersub-millimeter dust opacity, and a relative abundance of very small grains tolarge grains about four times higher. these results are compatible withexpectations for clouds that are part of the galactic fountain in which thereis dust shattering and fragmentation. correlated dust emission in hvcs is notdetected; the average of the 99.9% confidence upper limits to the emissivity is0.15 times the local ism value at 857 and 3000 ghz, in accordance with gasphase evidence for lower metallicity and depletion in these clouds. unexpectedanti-correlated variations of the dust temperature and emission cross-sectionper h atom are identified in the local ism and ivcs, a trend that continuesinto molecular environments. this suggests that dust growth throughaggregation, seen in molecular clouds, is active much earlier in the cloudcondensation and star formation processes.

1101.2037	planck early results: thermal dust in nearby molecular clouds	planck allows unbiased mapping of galactic sub-millimetre and millimetreemission from the most diffuse regions to the densest parts of molecularclouds. we present an early analysis of the taurus molecular complex, online-of-sight-averaged data and without component separation. the emissionspectrum measured by planck and iras can be fitted pixel by pixel using asingle modified blackbody. some systematic residuals are detected at 353 ghzand 143 ghz, with amplitudes around -7 % and +13 %, respectively, indicatingthat the measured spectra are likely more complex than a simple modifiedblackbody. significant positive residuals are also detected in the molecularregions and in the 217 ghz and 100 ghz bands, mainly caused by to thecontribution of the j=2-1 and j=1-0 12co and 13co emission lines. we derivemaps of the dust temperature t, the dust spectral emissivity index beta, andthe dust optical depth at 250 microns tau. the temperature map illustrates thecooling of the dust particles in thermal equilibrium with the incidentradiation field, from 16-17 k in the diffuse regions to 13-14 k in the denseparts. the distribution of spectral indices is centred at 1.78, with a standarddeviation of 0.08 and a systematic error of 0.07. we detect a significantt-beta anti-correlation. the dust optical depth map reveals the spatialdistribution of the column density of the molecular complex from the densestmolecular regions to the faint diffuse regions. we use near-infrared extinctionand hi data at 21-cm to perform a quantitative analysis of the spatialvariations of the measured dust optical depth at 250 microns per hydrogen atomtau/nh. we report an increase of tau/nh by a factor of about 2 between theatomic phase and the molecular phase, which has a strong impact on theequilibrium temperature of the dust particles.

1101.2040	planck early results. v. the low frequency instrument data processing	we describe the processing of data from the low frequency instrument (lfi)used in production of the planck early release compact source catalogue(ercsc). in particular, we discuss the steps involved in reducing the data fromtelemetry packets to cleaned, calibrated, time-ordered data (tod) and frequencymaps. data are continuously calibrated using the modulation of the temperatureof the cosmic microwave background radiation induced by the motion of thespacecraft. noise properties are estimated from tod from which the sky signalhas been removed using a generalized least square map-making algorithm.measured 1/f noise knee-frequencies range from 100mhz at 30ghz to a few tens ofmhz at 70ghz. a destriping code (madam) is employed to combine radiometric dataand pointing information into sky maps, minimizing the variance of correlatednoise. noise covariance matrices required to compute statistical uncertaintieson lfi and planck products are also produced. main beams are estimated down tothe approx -10db level using jupiter transits, which are also used forgeometrical calibration of the focal plane.

1101.2043	planck early results. x. statistical analysis of sunyaev-zeldovich  scaling relations for x-ray galaxy clusters	all-sky data from the planck survey and the meta-catalogue of x-ray detectedclusters of galaxies (mcxc) are combined to investigate the relationshipbetween the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal and x-ray luminosity. thesample comprises ~ 1600 x-ray clusters with redshifts up to ~ 1 and spans awide range in x-ray luminosity. the sz signal is extracted for each objectindividually, and the statistical significance of the measurement is maximisedby averaging the sz signal in bins of x-ray luminosity, total mass, orredshift. the sz signal is detected at very high significance over more thantwo decades in x-ray luminosity (10^43 erg/s &lt; l_500 e(z)^-7/3 &lt; 2 x 10^45erg/s). the relation between intrinsic sz signal and x-ray luminosity isinvestigated and the measured sz signal is compared to values predicted fromx-ray data. planck measurements and x-ray based predictions are found to be inexcellent agreement over the whole explored luminosity range. no significantdeviation from standard evolution of the scaling relations is detected. for thefirst time the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relation between sz signal andx-ray luminosity is measured and found to be consistent with the one in theluminosity -- mass relation from x-ray studies. there is no evidence of anydeficit in sz signal strength in planck data relative to expectations from thex-ray properties of clusters, underlining the robustness and consistency of ouroverall view of intra-cluster medium properties.

1101.2044	planck early results: statistical properties of extragalactic radio  sources in the planck early release compact source catalogue	the data reported in planck's early release compact source catalogue (ercsc)are exploited to measure the number counts (dn/ds) of extragalactic radiosources at 30, 44, 70, 100, 143 and 217 ghz. due to the full-sky nature of thecatalogue, this measurement extends to the rarest and brightest sources in thesky. at lower frequencies (30, 44, and 70 ghz) our counts are in very goodagreement with estimates based on wmap data, being somewhat deeper at 30 and 70ghz, and somewhat shallower at 44 ghz. planck's source counts at 143 and 217ghz join smoothly with the fainter ones provided by the spt and act surveysover small fractions of the sky. an analysis of source spectra, exploitingplanck's uniquely broad spectral coverage, finds clear evidence of a steepeningof the mean spectral index above about 70 ghz. this implies that, at thesefrequencies, the contamination of the cmb power spectrum by radio sources belowthe detection limit is significantly lower than previously estimated.

1101.2045	planck early results: the planck view of nearby galaxies	the all-sky coverage of the planck early release compact source catalogue(ercsc) provides an unsurpassed survey of galaxies at submillimetre (submm)wavelengths, representing a major improvement in the numbers of galaxiesdetected, as well as the range of far-ir/submm wavelengths over which they havebeen observed. we here present the first results on the properties of nearbygalaxies using these data. we match the ercsc catalogue to iras-detectedgalaxies in the imperial iras faint source redshift catalogue (iifscz), so thatwe can measure the spectral energy distributions (seds) of these objects from60 to 850 microns. this produces a list of 1717 galaxies with reliableassociations between planck and iras, from which we select a subset of 468 forsed studies, namely those with strong detections in the three highest frequencyplanck bands and no evidence of cirrus contamination. the seds are fitted usingparametric dust models to determine the range of dust temperatures andemissivities. we find evidence for colder dust than has previously been foundin external galaxies, with t&lt;20k. such cold temperatures are found using boththe standard single temperature dust model with variable emissivity beta, or atwo dust temperature model with beta fixed at 2. we also compare our results tostudies of distant submm galaxies (smgs) which have been claimed to containcooler dust than their local counterparts. we find that including our sample of468 galaxies significantly reduces the distinction between the two populations.fits to seds of selected objects using more sophisticated templates derivedfrom radiative transfer models confirm the presence of the colder dust foundthrough parameteric fitting. we thus conclude that cold (t&lt;20k) dust is asignificant and largely unexplored component of many nearby galaxies.

1101.2046	planck early results: origin of the submm excess dust emission in the  magellanic clouds	the integrated spectral energy distributions of the large and smallmagellanic cloud appear significantly flatter than expected from dust modelsbased on their fir and radio emission. the origin of this millimetre excess isstill unexplained, and is here investigated using the planck data. thebackground cmb contribution is subtracted using an ilc method performed locallyaround the galaxies. the foreground emission from the milky way is subtracted.after subtraction, the emission of both galaxies correlates closely with thegas emission of the lmc and smc. the millimetre excess in the lmc can beexplained by cmb fluctuations, but a significant excess is still present in thesmc sed. the planck and iris data at 100 micron are combined to produce thermaldust temperature and optical depth maps of the two galaxies. the lmctemperature map shows the presence of a warm inner arm already found with thespitzer data, but also shows the existence of a previously unidentified coldouter arm. several cold regions are found along this arm, some of which areassociated with known molecular clouds. the average emissivity spectral indexis found to be consistent with beta=1.5 and beta=1.2 below 500 microns for thelmc and smc respectively, significantly flatter than the values observed in themilky way. furthermore, there is evidence in the smc for a further flatteningof the sed in the sub-mm. the spatial distribution of the millimetre dustexcess in the smc follows the gas and thermal dust distribution. differentmodels are explored in order to fit the dust emission in the smc. it isconcluded that the millimetre excess is unlikely to be caused by very cold dustemission and that it could be due to a combination of spinning dust. emissionand thermal dust emission by more amorphous dust grains than those present inour galaxy.

1101.2047	planck early results. xv. spectral energy distributions and radio  continuum spectra of northern extragalactic radio sources	spectral energy distributions (seds) and radio continuum spectra arepresented for a northern sample of 104 extragalactic radio sources, based onthe planck early release compact source catalogue (ercsc) and simultaneousmultifrequency data. the nine planck frequencies, from 30 to 857 ghz, arecomplemented by a set of simultaneous observations ranging from radio togamma-rays. this is the first extensive frequency coverage in the radio andmillimetre domains for an essentially complete sample of extragalactic radiosources, and it shows how the individual shocks, each in their own phase ofdevelopment, shape the radio spectra as they move in the relativistic jet. theseds presented in this paper were fitted with second and third degreepolynomials to estimate the frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse compton(ic) peaks, and the spectral indices of low and high frequency radio data,including the planck ercsc data, were calculated. sed modelling methods arediscussed, with an emphasis on proper, physical modelling of the synchrotronbump using multiplecomponents. planck ercsc data also suggest that the originalaccelerated electron energy spectrum could be much harder than commonlythought, with power-law index around 1.5 instead of the canonical 2.5. theimplications of this are discussed for the acceleration mechanisms effective inblazar shock. furthermore in many cases the planck data indicate that gamma-rayemission must originate in the same shocks that produce the radio emission.

0710.1947	results from droxo. i. the variability of fluorescent fe 6.4 kev  emission in the young star elias 29: high-energy electrons in the star's  accretion tubes?	aims. we study the variability of the fe 6.4 kev emission line from the classi young stellar object elias 29 in the rho-oph cloud. methods. we analysed thedata from elias 29 collected by xmm during a nine-day, nearly continuousobservation of the rho-oph star-forming region (the deep rho-oph x-rayobservation, named droxo). the data were subdivided into six homogeneous timeintervals, and the six resulting spectra were individually analysed. results.we detect significant variability in the equivalent width of the fe 6.4 kevemission line from elias 29. the 6.4 kev line is absent during the first timeinterval of observation and appears at its maximum strength during the secondtime interval (90 ks after elias 29 undergoes a strong flare). the x-raythermal emission is unchanged between the two observation segments, while linevariability is present at a 99.9% confidence level. given the significant linevariability in the absence of variations in the x-ray ionising continuum andthe weakness of the photoionising continuum from the star's thermal x-rayemission, we suggest that the fluorescence may be induced by collisionalionisation from an (unseen) population of non-thermal electrons. we speculateon the possibility that the electrons are accelerated in a reconnection eventof a magnetically confined accretion loop, connecting the young star to itscircumstellar disk.

1207.3675	the pre-launch planck sky model: a model of sky emission at  submillimetre to centimetre wavelengths	we present the planck sky model (psm), a parametric model for the generationof all-sky, few arcminute resolution maps of sky emission at submillimetre tocentimetre wavelengths, in both intensity and polarisation. several options areimplemented to model the cosmic microwave background, galactic diffuse emission(synchrotron, free-free, thermal and spinning dust, co lines), galactic h-iiregions, extragalactic radio sources, dusty galaxies, and thermal and kineticsunyaev-zeldovich signals from clusters of galaxies. each component issimulated by means of educated interpolations/extrapolations of data setsavailable at the time of the launch of the planck mission, complemented bystate-of-the-art models of the emission. distinctive features of thesimulations are: spatially varying spectral properties of synchrotron and dust;different spectral parameters for each point source; modeling of the clusteringproperties of extragalactic sources and of the power spectrum of fluctuationsin the cosmic infrared background. the psm enables the production of randomrealizations of the sky emission, constrained to match observational datawithin their uncertainties, and is implemented in a software package that isregularly updated with incoming information from observations. the model isexpected to serve as a useful tool for optimizing planned microwave andsub-millimetre surveys and to test data processing and analysis pipelines. itis, in particular, used for the development and validation of data analysispipelines within the planck collaboration. a version of the software that canbe used for simulating the observations for a variety of experiments is madeavailable on a dedicated website.

1208.5483	planck intermediate results. ix. detection of the galactic haze with  planck	using precise full-sky observations from planck, and applying several methodsof component separation, we identify and characterize the emission from thegalactic "haze" at microwave wavelengths. the haze is a distinct component ofdiffuse galactic emission, roughly centered on the galactic centre, and extendsto |b| ~35 deg in galactic latitude and |l| ~15 deg in longitude. by combiningthe planck data with observations from the wmap we are able to determine thespectrum of this emission to high accuracy, unhindered by the large systematicbiases present in previous analyses. the derived spectrum is consistent withpower-law emission with a spectral index of -2.55 +/- 0.05, thus excludingfree-free emission as the source and instead favouring hard-spectrumsynchrotron radiation from an electron population with a spectrum (numberdensity per energy) dn/de ~ e^-2.1. at galactic latitudes |b|&lt;30 deg, themicrowave haze morphology is consistent with that of the fermi gamma-ray "haze"or "bubbles," indicating that we have a multi-wavelength view of a distinctcomponent of our galaxy. given both the very hard spectrum and the extendednature of the emission, it is highly unlikely that the haze electrons resultfrom supernova shocks in the galactic disk. instead, a new mechanism forcosmic-ray acceleration in the centre of our galaxy is implied.

1301.5839	planck intermediate results. xii: diffuse galactic components in the  gould belt system	we perform an analysis of the diffuse low-frequency galactic components inthe southern part of the gould belt system (130^\circ\leq l\leq 230^\circ and-50^\circ\leq b\leq -10^\circ). strong ultra-violet (uv) flux coming from thegould belt super-association is responsible for bright diffuse foregrounds thatwe observe from our position inside the system and that can help us improve ourknowledge of the galactic emission. free-free emission and anomalous microwaveemission (ame) are the dominant components at low frequencies (\nu &lt; 40 ghz),while synchrotron emission is very smooth and faint. we separate diffusefree-free emission and ame from synchrotron emission and thermal dust emissionby using planck data, complemented by ancillary data, using the "correlatedcomponent analysis" (cca) component separation method and we compare with theresults of cross-correlation of foreground templates with the frequency maps.we estimate the electron temperature t_e from h$\alpha$ and free-free emissionusing two methods (temperature-temperature plot and cross-correlation) and weobtain t_e ranging from 3100 to 5200 k, for an effective fraction of absorbingdust along the line of sight of 30% (f_d=0.3). we estimate the frequencyspectrum of the diffuse ame and we recover a peak frequency (in flux densityunits) of 25.5 \pm 1.5 ghz. we verify the reliability of this result withrealistic simulations that include the presence of biases in the spectral modelfor the ame and in the free-free template. by combining physical models forvibrational and rotational dust emission and adding the constraints from thethermal dust spectrum from planck and iras we are able to get a gooddescription of the frequency spectrum of the ame for plausible values of thelocal density and radiation field.

1303.5062	planck 2013 results. i. overview of products and scientific results	the esa's planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early universe and itssubsequent evolution, was launched 14 may 2009 and has been scanning themicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 august 2009. this papergives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis,and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science dataproducts and papers in the release. the science products include maps of thecmb and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact galactic andextragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the sz effect.the likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the planck dataand a lensing likelihood are described. scientific results include robustsupport for the standard six-parameter lcdm model of cosmology and improvedmeasurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation fromscale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. the planck values for theseparameters and others derived from them are significantly different from thosepreviously determined. several large-scale anomalies in the temperaturedistribution of the cmb, first detected by wmap, are confirmed with higherconfidence. planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and hasmeasured gravitational lensing of cmb anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma.planck finds no evidence for non-gaussianity in the cmb. planck's results agreewell with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. planckfinds a lower hubble constant than found in some more local measures. sometension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derivedfrom cmb data and that derived from sz data. the planck and wmap power spectraare offset from each other by an average level of about 2% around the firstacoustic peak.

1303.5066	planck 2013 results. v. lfi calibration	we discuss the methods employed to photometrically calibrate the dataacquired by the low frequency instrument on planck. our calibration is based ona combination of the orbital dipole plus the solar dipole, caused respectivelyby the motion of the planck spacecraft with respect to the sun and by motion ofthe solar system with respect to the cmb rest frame. the latter provides asignal of a few mk with the same spectrum as the cmb anisotropies and isvisible throughout the mission. in this data release we rely on thecharacterization of the solar dipole as measured by wmap. we also presentpreliminary results (at 44ghz only) on the study of the orbital dipole, whichagree with the wmap value of the solar system speed within our uncertainties.we compute the calibration constant for each radiometer roughly once per hour,in order to keep track of changes in the detectors' gain. since non-idealitiesin the optical response of the beams proved to be important, we implemented afast convolution algorithm which considers the full beam response in estimatingthe signal generated by the dipole. moreover, in order to further reduce theimpact of residual systematics due to sidelobes, we estimated time variationsin the calibration constant of the 30ghz radiometers (the ones with the largestsidelobes) using the signal of a reference load. we have estimated thecalibration accuracy in two ways: we have run a set of simulations to assessthe impact of statistical errors and systematic effects in the instrument andin the calibration procedure, and we have performed a number of consistencychecks on the data and on the brightness temperature of jupiter. calibrationerrors for this data release are expected to be about 0.6% at 44 and 70 ghz,and 0.8% at 30 ghz.

1303.5069	planck 2013 results. viii. hfi photometric calibration and mapmaking	this paper describes the processing applied to the hfi cleaned time-ordereddata to produce photometrically calibrated maps. hfi observes the sky over abroad range of frequencies, from 100 to 857 ghz. to get the best accuracy onthe calibration on such a large range, two different photometric calibrationschemes have to be used. the 545 and 857 \ghz\ data are calibrated using uranusand neptune flux density measurements, compared with models of theiratmospheric emissions to calibrate the data. the lower frequencies (below 353ghz) are calibrated using the cosmological microwave background dipole.one ofthe components of this anisotropy results from the orbital motion of thesatellite in the solar system, and is therefore time-variable. photometriccalibration is thus tightly linked to mapmaking, which also addresses lowfrequency noise removal. the 2013 released hfi data show some evidence forapparent gain variations of the hfi bolometers' detection chain. thesevariations were identified by comparing observations taken more than one yearapart in the same configuration. we developed an effective correction to limitits effect on calibration, and assess its accuracy. we present several methodsused to estimate the precision of the photometric calibration. we distinguishrelative (from one detector to another, or from one frequency to another) andabsolute uncertainties. in both cases, we found that these uncertainties rangefrom a few $10^{-3}$ to several per cents from 100 to 857 ghz. we describe thepipeline producing the maps from the hfi timelines, based on the photometriccalibration parameters and we detail the scheme used to a posteriori set thezero level of the maps. we also briefly discuss the cross-calibration betweenhfi and the spire instrument on board herschel. we finally summarize the basiccharacteristics of the set of the hfi maps from the 2013 planck data release.

1303.5072	planck 2013 results. xii. component separation	planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bandsbetween 30 and 857 ghz. these observations allow robust reconstruction of theprimordial cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations overnearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on galactic foregrounds. thispaper describes the component separation framework adopted by planck. we testfour foreground-cleaned cmb maps derived using qualitatively differentcomponent separation algorithms. the quality of our reconstructions isevaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shownthrough various tests to be internally consistent and robust for cmb powerspectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. the parameterconstraints on lambdacdm cosmologies derived from these maps are consistentwith those presented in the cross-spectrum based planck likelihood analysis. wechoose two of the cmb maps for specific scientific goals. we also present mapsand frequency spectra of the galactic low-frequency, co, and thermal dustemission. the component maps are found to provide a faithful representation ofthe sky, as evaluated by simulations. for the low-frequency component, thespectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta &lt;-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinningdust spectrum peaking below 20 ghz, a flat index of beta &gt; -2.3 with strongfree-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.

1303.5075	planck 2013 results. xv. cmb power spectra and likelihood	we present the planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of thetwo-point correlation function of the cmb temperature fluctuations. we use thislikelihood to derive the planck cmb power spectrum over three decades in l,covering 2 &lt;= l &lt;= 2500. the main source of error at l &lt;= 1500 is cosmicvariance. uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumentalnoise dominate the error budget at higher l's. for l &lt; 50, our likelihoodexploits all planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 ghz through a physicallymotivated bayesian component separation technique. at l &gt;= 50, we employ acorrelated gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectraderived from the 100, 143 and 217 ghz channels. we validate our likelihoodthrough an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact ofresidual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.we find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residualsof a few uk^2 at l &lt;= 1000. we compare our results with foreground-cleaned cmbmaps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 ghz planck map, and find broadagreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. thebest-fit lcdm cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary planckpolarisation spectra. the standard lcdm cosmology is well constrained by planckby l &lt;= 1500. for example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indicationof significant departures from the lcdm framework. finally, we report a tensionbetween the best-fit lcdm model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a powerdeficit of 5-10% at l &lt;~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. we do not elaboratefurther on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our mostpuzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset.

1303.5076	planck 2013 results. xvi. cosmological parameters	we present the first results based on planck measurements of the cmbtemperature and lensing-potential power spectra. the planck spectra at highmultipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flatsix-parameter lcdm cosmology. in this model planck data determine thecosmological parameters to high precision. we find a low value of the hubbleconstant, h0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/mpc and a high value of the matter densityparameter, omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreementwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) surveys. includingcurvature, we find that the universe is consistent with spatial flatness topercent-level precision using planck cmb data alone. we present results from ananalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data setsin addition to planck and high-resolution cmb data. none of these models arefavoured significantly over standard lcdm. the deviation of the scalar spectralindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changesin the matter content of the universe. we find a 95% upper limit of r&lt;0.11 onthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. there is no evidence for additional neutrino-likerelativistic particles. using bao and cmb data, we find n_eff=3.30+/-0.27 forthe effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of0.23 ev for the summed neutrino mass. our results are in excellent agreementwith big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of n_eff=3.046. we find noevidence for dynamical dark energy. despite the success of the standard lcdmmodel, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the cmb power spectrum atlow multipoles, as noted previously by the wmap team. while not of decisivesignificance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis ofthe planck temperature data.

1303.5077	planck 2013 results. xvii. gravitational lensing by large-scale  structure	on the arcminute angular scales probed by planck, the cmb anisotropies aregently perturbed by gravitational lensing. here we present a detailed study ofthis effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217ghzfrequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. we usethe temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a(noisy) map of the cmb lensing potential, which provides an integrated measureof the mass distribution back to the cmb last-scattering surface. our lensingpotential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a factwhich we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scalestructure. we estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, findinggenerally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting lcdm model forthe planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structureswhich source the lensing potential. when combined with the temperature powerspectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameterconstraints; it improves cmb-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of twoand also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordialperturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing ameasurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent oflarge-scale polarization data. discarding scale information, our measurementcorresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential powerspectrum, or a 2% constraint on the rms amplitude of matter fluctuations atz~2.

1303.5078	planck 2013 results. xviii. gravitational lensing-infrared background  correlation	the multi-frequency capability of the planck satellite provides informationboth on the integrated history of star formation (via the cosmic infraredbackground, or cib) and on the distribution of dark matter (via the lensingeffect on the cosmic microwave background, or cmb). the conjunction of thesetwo unique probes allows us to measure directly the connection between dark andluminous matter in the high redshift (1 &lt; z &lt;3) universe. we use a three-pointstatistic optimized to detect the correlation between these two tracers.following a thorough discussion of possible contaminants and a suite ofconsistency tests, using lens reconstructions at 100, 143 and 217 ghz and cibmeasurements at 100-857 ghz, we report the first detection of the correlationbetween the cib and cmb lensing. the well matched redshift distribution ofthese two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42\sigma at 545 ghz and a correlation as high as 80% across these two tracers.our full set of multi-frequency measurements (both cib auto- and cib-lensingcross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with acharacteristic mass scale for the halos hosting cib sources oflog_{10}(m/m_sun) = 10.5 \pm 0.6. leveraging the frequency dependence of oursignal, we isolate the high redshift contribution to the cib, and constrain thestar formation rate (sfr) density at z&gt;1. we measure directly the sfr densitywith around 2 sigma significance for three redshift bins between z=1 and 7,thus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at earlytimes.

1303.5079	planck 2013 results. xix. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	based on cmb maps from the 2013 planck mission data release, this paperpresents the detection of the isw effect, i.e., the correlation between the cmband large-scale evolving gravitational potentials. the significance ofdetection ranges from 2 to 4 sigma, depending on which method is used. weinvestigate three separate approaches, which cover essentially all previousstudies, as well as breaking new ground. (i) correlation of the cmb with theplanck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). thisdetection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation betweenlensing and the isw effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma. (ii)cross-correlation with tracers of lss, yielding around 3 sigma significance,based on a combination of radio (nvss) and optical (sdss) data. (iii) aperturephotometry on stacked cmb fields at the locations of known large-scalestructures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously exploredcatalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared toexpectations. more recent catalogues give more moderate results, ranging fromnegligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent scale andamplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected fromnumerical simulations within lcmd. where they can be compared, thesemeasurements are compatible with previous work using data from wmap, which hadalready mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance. planck's broaderfrequency coverage confirms that the signal is achromatic, bolstering the casefor isw detection. as a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure tofilter the cmb data, presenting maps of the isw temperature perturbation. theseresults provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of adark energy component that governs the current accelerated expansion of theuniverse.

1303.5080	planck 2013 results. xx. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster counts	we present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as afunction of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the planck sz(psz) catalogue. the psz is selected through the signature of thesunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect, and the sub-sample used here has asignal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster andall but one with a redshift estimate. we discuss the completeness of the sampleand our construction of a likelihood analysis. using a relation between mass$m$ and sz signal $y$ calibrated to x-ray measurements, we derive constraintson the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter$\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\lambda$cdm model. we test the robustness ofour estimates and find that possible biases in the $y$--$m$ relation and thehalo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from thecluster sample. assuming the x-ray determined mass to be biased low relative tothe true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observedmass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we findthat $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm 0.02$, and$\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. the value of$\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a valueof 20% we find $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm 0.01$ and atighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. we find that the largervalues of $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by planck'smeasurements of the primary cmb anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass biasof about 40%. alternatively, consistency with the primary cmb constraints canbe achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scalesrelative to the $\lambda$cdm model, such as a component of massive neutrinos(abridged).

1303.5081	planck 2013 results. xxi. all-sky compton parameter power spectrum and  high-order statistics	we have constructed the first all-sky map of the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich(tsz) effect by applying specifically tailored component separation algorithmsto the 100 to 857 ghz frequency channel maps from the planck survey. these mapsshow an obvious galaxy cluster tsz signal that is well matched with blindlydetected clusters in the planck sz catalogue. to characterize the signal in thetsz map we have computed its angular power spectrum.  at large angular scales ($\ell &lt; 60$), the major foreground contaminant isthe diffuse thermal dust emission. at small angular scales ($\ell &gt; 500$) theclustered cosmic infrared background (cib) and residual point sources are themajor contaminants.  these foregrounds are carefully modelled and subtracted.  we measure the tsz power spectrum in angular scales, $0.17^{\circ} \lesssim\theta \lesssim 3.0^{\circ}$, that were previously unexplored. the measured tszpower spectrum is consistent with that expected from the planck catalogue of szsources, with additional clear evidence of signal from unresolved clusters and,potentially, diffuse warm baryons.  we use the tsz power spectrum to obtain the following cosmologicalconstraints:  $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.28)^{3.2/8.1}=0.784 \pm 0.016 (68% c.l.).  marginalized band-powers of the planck tsz power spectrum and the best-fitmodel are given.  the non-gaussianity of the compton parameter map is further characterized bycomputing its 1d probability distribution function and its bispectrum. theseare used to place additional independent constraints on $\sigma_{8}$.

1303.5082	planck 2013 results. xxii. constraints on inflation	we analyse the implications of the planck data for cosmic inflation. theplanck nominal mission temperature anisotropy measurements, combined with thewmap large-angle polarization, constrain the scalar spectral index to $n_s =0.9603 \pm 0.0073$, ruling out exact scale invariance at over 5 $\sigma$.planck establishes an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r &lt; 0.11(95% cl). the planck data thus shrink the space of allowed standardinflationary models, preferring potentials with v" &lt; 0. exponential potentialmodels, the simplest hybrid inflationary models, and monomial potential modelsof degree n &gt; 2 do not provide a good fit to the data. planck does not findstatistically significant running of the scalar spectral index, obtaining $dn_s/d ln k = -0.0134 \pm 0.0090$. several analyses dropping the slow-rollapproximation are carried out, including detailed model comparison andinflationary potential reconstruction. we also investigate whether theprimordial power spectrum contains any features. we find that models with aparameterized oscillatory feature improve the fit $\chi^2$ by ~ 10; however,bayesian evidence does not prefer these models. we constrain severalsingle-field inflation models with generalized lagrangians by combining powerspectrum data with bounds on $f_\mathrm{nl}$ measured by planck. the fractionalprimordial contribution of cdm isocurvature modes in the curvaton and axionscenarios has upper bounds of 0.25% or 3.9% (95% cl), respectively. in modelswith arbitrarily correlated cdm or neutrino isocurvature modes, ananticorrelation can improve $\chi^2$ by approximatively 4 as a result ofslightly lowering the theoretical prediction for the $\ell&lt;40$ multipolesrelative to the higher multipoles. nonetheless, the data are consistent withadiabatic initial conditions.

1303.5083	planck 2013 results. xxiii. isotropy and statistics of the cmb	the two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that theinitial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and gaussian - are rigorouslytested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy from theplanck satellite. deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated tobe robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequencydependence. many of these anomalies were previously observed in the wmap data,and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma).however, we find little evidence for non-gaussianity, with the exception of afew statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies.in particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connectedto a low observed variance of the cmb signal. a power asymmetry is now found topersist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in thelow-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. however, anyprimordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend toarbitrarily small angular scales. finally, it is plausible that some of thesefeatures may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, whichshows a deficit of power on similar scales. indeed, when the power spectra oftwo hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, oneshows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillationsbetween odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation andphase correlations also detected in the data. although these analyses representa step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactoryexplanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.

1303.5085	planck 2013 results. xxv. searches for cosmic strings and other  topological defects	planck data have been used to provide stringent new constraints on cosmicstrings and other defects. we describe forecasts of the cmb power spectruminduced by cosmic strings, calculating these from network models andsimulations using line-of-sight boltzmann solvers. we have studied nambu-gotocosmic strings, as well as field theory strings for which radiative effects areimportant, thus spanning the range of theoretical uncertainty in stringsmodels. we have added the angular power spectrum from strings to that for asimple adiabatic model, with the extra fraction defined as $f_{10}$ atmultipole $\ell=10$. this parameter has been added to the standard sixparameter fit using cosmomc with flat priors. for the nambu-goto string model,we have obtained a constraint on the string tension of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.5 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.015$ at 95% confidence that can be improved to$g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.3 x 10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.010$ on inclusion of high-$\ell$ cmbdata. for the abelian-higgs field theory model we find, $g\mu_{ah}/c^2 &lt; 3.2 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.028$. the marginalized likelihoods for $f_{10}$ and inthe $f_{10}$--$\omega_b h^2$ plane are also presented. we have also obtainedconstraints on $f_{10}$ for models with semi-local strings and global texturesfor which $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.1 x 10^{-6}$. we have made complementarity searches forthe specific non-gaussian signatures of cosmic strings, calibrating withall-sky planck resolution cmb maps generated from networks ofpost-recombination strings. we have obtained upper limits on the string tensionat 95% confidence of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 8.8 x 10^{-7}$ using modal bispectrumestimation and $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 7.8 x 10^{-7}$ for real space searches withminkowski functionals. these are conservative upper bounds because onlypost-recombination string contributions have been included in the non-gaussiananalysis.

1303.5086	planck 2013 results. xxvi. background geometry and topology of the  universe	planck cmb temperature maps allow detection of large-scale departures fromhomogeneity and isotropy. we search for topology with a fundamental domainnearly intersecting the last scattering surface (comoving distance $\chi_r$).for most topologies studied the likelihood maximized over orientation showssome preference for multi-connected models just larger than $\chi_r$. thiseffect is also present in simulated realizations of isotropic maps and weinterpret it as the alignment of mild anisotropic correlations with chancefeatures in a single realization; such a feature can also exist, in milderform, when the likelihood is marginalized over orientations. thus marginalized,the limits on the radius $r_i$ of the largest sphere inscribed in a topologicaldomain (at log-likelihood-ratio -5) are: in a flat universe, $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$for the cubic torus (cf. $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ at 99% cl for a matched-circlessearch); $r_i&gt;0.7\chi_r$ for the chimney; $r_i&gt;0.5\chi_r$ for the slab; in apositively curved universe, $r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the dodecahedron;$r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the truncated cube; $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ for the octahedron.similar limits apply to alternate topologies. we perform a bayesian search foran anisotropic bianchi vii$_h$ geometry. in a non-physical setting where thebianchi parameters are decoupled from cosmology, planck data favour a bianchicomponent with a bayes factor of at least 1.5 units of log-evidence: a bianchipattern is efficient at accounting for some large-scale anomalies in planckdata. however, the cosmological parameters are in strong disagreement withthose found from cmb anisotropy data alone. in the physically motivated settingwhere the bianchi parameters are fitted simultaneously with standardcosmological parameters, we find no evidence for a bianchi vii$_h$ cosmologyand constrain the vorticity of such models: $(\omega/h)_0&lt;8\times10^{-10}$ (95%cl).

1303.5089	planck 2013 results. xxix. planck catalogue of sunyaev-zeldovich sources	we describe the all-sky planck catalogue of clusters and cluster candidatesderived from sunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect detections using the first 15.5months of planck satellite observations. the catalogue contains 1227 entries,making it over six times the size of the planck early sz (esz) sample and thelargest sz-selected catalogue to date. it contains 861 confirmed clusters, ofwhich 178 have been confirmed as clusters, mostly through follow-upobservations, and a further 683 are previously-known clusters. the remaining366 have the status of cluster candidates, and we divide them into threeclasses according to the quality of evidence that they are likely to be trueclusters. the planck sz catalogue is the deepest all-sky cluster catalogue,with redshifts up to about one, and spans the broadest cluster mass range from(0.1 to 1.6) 10^{15}msun. confirmation of cluster candidates through comparisonwith existing surveys or cluster catalogues is extensively described, as is thestatistical characterization of the catalogue in terms of completeness andstatistical reliability. the outputs of the validation process are provided asadditional information. this gives, in particular, an ensemble of 813 clusterredshifts, and for all these planck clusters we also include a mass estimatedfrom a newly-proposed sz-mass proxy. a refined measure of the sz comptonparameter for the clusters with x-ray counter-parts is provided, as is an x-rayflux for all the planck clusters not previously detected in x-ray surveys.

1303.5090	planck intermediate results. xiii. constraints on peculiar velocities	using \planck\ data combined with the meta catalogue of x-ray detectedclusters of galaxies (mcxc), we address the study of peculiar motions bysearching for evidence of the kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect (ksz). byimplementing various filters designed to extract the ksz generated at thepositions of the clusters, we obtain consistent constraints on the radialpeculiar velocity average, root mean square (rms), and local bulk flowamplitude at different depths. for the whole cluster sample of average redshift0.18, the measured average radial peculiar velocity with respect to the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) radiation at that redshift, i.e., the ksz monopole,amounts to $72 \pm 60$ km s$^{-1}$. this constitutes less than 1% of therelative hubble velocity of the cluster sample with respect to our local cmbframe. while the linear $\lambda$cdm prediction for the typical cluster radialvelocity rms at $z=0.15$ is close to 230km s$^{-1}$, the upper limit imposed by\planck\ data on the cluster subsample corresponds to 800 km s$^{-1}$ at 95%confidence level, i.e., about three times higher. \planck\ data also set strongconstraints on the local bulk flow in volumes centred on the local group. thereis no detection of bulk flow as measured in any comoving sphere extending tothe maximum redshift covered by the cluster sample. a blind search for bulkflows in this sample has an upper limit of 254 km s$^{-1}$ (95% confidencelevel) dominated by cmb confusion and instrumental noise, indicating that theuniverse is largely homogeneous on gpc scales. in this context, in conjunctionwith supernova observations, \planck\ is able to rule out a large class ofinhomogeneous void models as alternatives to dark energy or modified gravity.the \planck\ constraints on peculiar velocities and bulk flows are thusconsistent with the $\lambda$cdm scenario.

1307.6815	planck intermediate results. xiv. dust emission at millimetre  wavelengths in the galactic plane	we use planck hfi data combined with ancillary radio data to study theemissivity index of the interstellar dust emission in the frequency range 10 -353 ghz, or 3 - 0.8 mm, in the galactic plane. we analyse the region l=20 degr- 44 degr and |b| \leq 4 degr where the free-free emission can be estimatedfrom radio recombination line data. we fit the spectra at each sky pixel with amodified blackbody model and two spectral indices, beta_mm and beta_fir, belowand above 353 ghz respectively. we find that beta_mm is smaller than beta_firand we detect a correlation between this low frequency power-law index and thedust optical depth at 353 ghz, tau_353. the opacity spectral index beta_mmincreases from about 1.54 in the more diffuse regions of the galactic disk, |b|= 3 degr - 4 degr and tau_353 ~ 5 x 10^{-5}, to about 1.66 in the densestregions with an optical depth of more than one order of magnitude higher. weassociate this correlation with an evolution of the dust emissivity related tothe fraction of molecular gas along the line of sight. this translates intobeta_mm ~ 1.54 for a medium that is mostly atomic and beta_mm ~ 1.66 when themedium is dominated by molecular gas. we find that both the two-level systemmodel and the emission by ferromagnetic particles can explain the results. theresults improve our understanding of the physics of interstellar dust and leadtowards a complete model of the dust spectrum of the milky way fromfar-infrared to millimetre wavelengths.

0801.4502	submillimetre point sources from the archeops experiment: very cold  clumps in the galactic plane	archeops is a balloon-borne experiment, mainly designed to measure the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) temperature anisotropies at high angular resolution(~ 12 arcminutes). by-products of the mission are shallow sensitivity maps overa large fraction of the sky (about 30 %) in the millimetre and submillimetrerange at 143, 217, 353 and 545 ghz. from these maps, we produce a catalog ofbright submillimetre point sources. we present in this paper the processing andanalysis of the archeops point sources. redundancy across detectors is the keyfactor allowing to sort out glitches from genuine point sources in the 20independent maps. we look at the properties of the most reliable point sources,totalling 304. fluxes range from 1 to 10,000 jy (at the frequencies covering143 to 545 ghz). all sources are either planets (2) or of galactic origin.longitude range is from 75 to 198 degrees. some of the sources are associatedwith well-known lynds nebulae and hii compact regions in the galactic plane. alarge fraction of the sources have an iras counterpart. except for jupiter,saturn, the crab and cas a, all sources show a dust-emission-like modifiedblackbody emission spectrum. temperatures cover a range from 7 to 27 k. for thecoldest sources (t&lt;10 k), a steep nu^beta emissivity law is found with asurprising beta ~ 3 to 4. an inverse relationship between t and beta isobserved. the number density of sources at 353 ghz with flux brighter than 100jy is of the order of 1 per degree of galactic longitude. these sources willprovide a strong check for the calibration of the planck hfi focal planegeometry as a complement to planets. these very cold sources observed byarcheops should be prime targets for mapping observations by the akari andherschel space missions and ground--based observatories.

1312.1300	planck 2013 results. xi. all-sky model of thermal dust emission	this paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the planck 857,545 and 353 ghz, and iras 100 micron data. using a modified black-body fit tothe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, andspectral index over the 353-3000 ghz range. this model is a tightrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. it shows variations of the order of 30% compared with the widely-used model of finkbeiner, davis, and schlegel. theplanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the wholesky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared toprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. anincrease of the dust opacity at 353 ghz, tau_353/n_h, from the diffuse to thedenser interstellar medium (ism) is reported. it is associated with a decreasein the observed dust temperature, t_obs, that could be due at least in part tothe increased dust opacity. we also report an excess of dust emission at hicolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust inthe warm ionized medium. in the diffuse ism at high galactic latitude, wereport an anti-correlation between tau_353/n_h and t_obs while the dustspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. the implication is thatin the diffuse high-latitude ism tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dustcolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlationof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements onstars is strong. to estimate galactic e(b-v) in extragalactic fields at highlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead ofthe dust optical depth, calibrated to e(b-v) using reddening measurements ofquasars deduced from sloan digital sky survey data.

1406.5093	planck intermediate results. xxiii. galactic plane emission components  derived from planck with ancillary data	planck data when combined with ancillary data provide a unique opportunity toseparate the diffuse emission components of the inner galaxy. the purpose ofthe paper is to elucidate the morphology of the various emission components inthe strong star-formation region lying inside the solar radius and to clarifythe relationship between the various components. the region of the galacticplane covered is l=300-0-60deg where star-formation is highest and the emissionis strong enough to make meaningful component separation. the latitude widthsin this longitude range lie between 1deg and 2deg, which correspond to fwhmz-widths of 100-200pc at a typical distance of 6kpc. the four emissioncomponents studied here are synchrotron, free-free, anomalous microwaveemission (ame), and thermal (vibrational) dust emission. these components areidentified by constructing spectral energy distributions (seds) at positionsalong the galactic plane using the wide frequency coverage of planck(28.4-857ghz) in combination with low-frequency radio data at 0.408-2.3ghz pluswmap data at 23-94ghz, along with far-infrared (fir) data from dirbe and iras.the free-free component is determined from radio recombination line (rrl) data.ame is found to be comparable in brightness to the free-free emission on thegalactic plane in the frequency range 20-40ghz with a width in latitude similarto that of the thermal dust; it comprises 45+/-1% of the total 28.4ghz emissionin the longitude range l=300-0-60deg. the free-free component is the narrowest,reflecting the fact that it is produced by current star-formation as traced bythe narrow distribution of ob stars. it is the dominant emission on the planebetween 60 and 100ghz. rrls from this ionized gas are used to assess itsdistance, leading to a free-free z-width of fwhm ~100pc...(abridged)

astro-ph;0202520	towards a model of full-sky galactic synchrotron intensity and linear  polarisation: a re-analysis of the parkes data	we have analysed the angular power spectra of the parkes radio continuum andpolarisation survey of the southern galactic plane at 2.4 ghz. we have foundthat in the multipole range l=40-250 the angular power spectrum of thepolarised intensity is well described by a power-law spectrum with fittedspectral index alpha_l = 2.37 +- 0.21. in the same multipole range the angularpower spectra of the e and b components of the polarised signal aresignificantly flatter, with fitted spectral indices respectively of alpha_e =1.57 +- 0.12 and alpha_b = 1.45 +- 0.12. temperature fluctuations in the e andb components are mostly determined by variations in polarisation angle. we havecombined these results with other data from available radio surveys in order toproduce a full-sky toy model of galactic synchrotron intensity and linearpolarisation at high frequencies (&gt; 10 ghz). this can be used to study thefeasibility of measuring the cosmic microwave background polarisation withforthcoming experiments and satellite missions.

astro-ph;0303033	an xmm-newton-based x-ray survey of pre-main sequence stellar emission  in the l1551 star-forming complex	we present a study of the x-ray sources present in the nearby l1551 starforming region, based on a deep xmm observation complemented with chandra datafor the brightest sources. all the known pre-main sequence stars in the regionhave been detected, most of them with sufficient statistics to allow a detailedstudy of the temporal and spectral characteristics of their x-ray emission.significant temporal (and spectral) variability on both short and long timescales is visible for most of the stars. in particular xz tau showslarge-amplitude variations on time scales of several hours with large changesin the intervening absorption, suggestive of the x-ray emission being eclipsedby the accretion stream (and thus of the x-ray emission being partly or totallyaccretion-induced). the coronal metal abundance of the wtts sources isclustered around z = 0.2, while the ctts sources span almost two orders ofmagnitudes in coronal z, even though the photospheric abundance of all stars inthe l1551 is likely to be very similar. some individual elements (notably ne)appear to be systematically enhanced with respect to fe in the wtts stars. thesignificant differences between the spectral and temporal characteristics ofthe ctts and wtts populations suggest that a different emission mechanism is(at least partly) responsible for the x-ray emission of the two types of stars.

astro-ph;0310355	a large x-ray flare from the herbig ae star v892 tau	we report the xmm-newton observation of a large x-ray flare from the herbigae star v892 tau. the apparent low mass companion of v892 tau, v892 tau ne, isunresolved by xmm-newton. nevertheless there is compelling evidence fromcombined xmm-newton and chandra data that the origin of the flare is the herbigae star v892 tau. during the flare the x-ray luminosity of v892 tau increasesby a factor of ~15, while the temperature of the plasma increases from kt ~ 1.5kev to kt ~ 8 kev. from the scaling of the flare event, based on hydrodynamicmodeling, we conclude that a 500 g magnetic field is needed in order to confinethe plasma. under the assumptions that a dynamo mechanism is required togenerate such a confining magnetic field and that surface convection is anecessary ingredient for a dynamo, our findings provide indirect evidence forthe existence of a significant convection zone in the stellar envelope ofherbig ae stars.

0808.3451	the x-ray luminosity of solar-mass stars in the intermediate age open  cluster ngc 752	aims. while observational evidence shows that most of the decline in a star'sx-ray activity occurs between the age of the hyades (~8 x 10^8 yrs) and that ofthe sun, very little is known about the evolution of stellar activity betweenthese ages. to gain information on the typical level of coronal activity at astar's intermediate age, we studied the x-ray emission from stars in the 1.9gyr old open cluster ngc 752. methods. we analysed a ~140 ks chandraobservation of ngc 752 and a ~50 ks xmm-newton observation of the same cluster.we detected 262 x-ray sources in the chandra data and 145 sources in thexmm-newton observation. around 90% of the catalogued cluster members withinchandra's field-of-view are detected in the x-ray. the x-ray luminosity of allobserved cluster members (28 stars) and of 11 cluster member candidates wasderived. results. our data indicate that, at an age of 1.9 gyr, the typicalx-ray luminosity of the cluster members with m=0.8-1.2 msun is lx = 1.3 x 10^28erg s^-1, so approximately a factor of 6 less intense than that observed in theyounger hyades. given that lx is proportional to the square of a star'srotational rate, the median lx of ngc 752 is consistent, for t &gt; 1 gyr, to adecaying rate in rotational velocities v_rot ~ t^-alpha with alpha ~ 0.75,steeper than the skumanich relation (alpha ~ 0.5) and significantly steeperthan observed between the pleiades and the hyades (where alpha &lt; 0.3),suggesting that a change in the rotational regimes of the stellar interiors istaking place at t ~ 1 gyr.

astro-ph;0406344	chandra observations of the massive star-forming region s106: x-ray  emission from the embedded massive protostellar object irs 4	we present chandra observations of the massive star-forming region s106, aprominent hii region in cygnus, associated with an extended molecular cloud anda young cluster. the nebula is excited by a single young massive star locatedat the center of the molecular cloud and the embedded cluster. the prominenceof the cluster in the chandra observation presented here confirms its youth andallows some of its members to be studied in more detail. we detect x-rayemission from the young massive central source s106 irs 4, the deeply embeddedcentral object which drives the bipolar nebula with a mass loss rateapproximately 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than main sequence stars ofcomparable luminosity. still, on the basis of its wind momentum flux the x-rayluminosity of s106 irs 4 is comparable to the values observed in more evolved(main sequence and giant) massive stars, suggesting that the same process whichis responsible for the observed x-ray emission from older massive stars isalready at work at these early stages.

astro-ph;0503469	hst and spectroscopic observations of the l1551 irs5 jets (hh154)	we have carried out a thorough optical study of the closest star formationjet. the inner arcminute surrounding the class 0/i binary protostar l1551 irs5and its associated jet (hh154) have been observed using the hubble spacetelescope with the wfpc2 camera, the eso new technology telescope with the emmispectrograph and the nordic optical telescope with the alfosc spectrograph.this data set is compared to earlier ground based imaging with the aim to studythe evolution of this particular jet, and its possible interaction with themolecular material in the bipolar molecular outflow associated with thissource. the velocity field of the jet is mapped out. the highest velocities arefound in the vicinity of the recently discovered x-ray source emanating from ashock in this jet. the energy radiated by the x-ray source is compatible withthese velocities. the \halpha and \hbeta emission from the jet is used todetermine the extinction, which is found to increase inwards in the jet towardsthe protostar. the extinction towards the x-ray source is consistent with theone determined from the x-ray spectrum.

astro-ph;0603630	x-ray and optical bursts and flares in ysos: results from a 5-day  xmm-newton monitoring campaign of l1551	we present the results of a five-day monitoring campaign with xmm-newton ofsix x-ray bright young stellar objects (ysos) in the star-forming complex l1551in taurus. all stars present significant variability on the five-day timescale. modulation of the light curve on time scales comparable with the star'srotational period appeared to be present in the case of one weak-lined t tauristar. significant spectral variations between the 2000 and the 2004observations were detected in the (unresolved) classical t tauri binary systemxz tau: a hot plasma component which was present in the x-ray spectrum in 2000had significantly weakened in 2004. as xz tau n was undergoing a strong opticaloutburst in 2000, which had terminated since then, we speculate on the possiblerelationship between episodic, burst accretion, and x-ray heating. thetransition object hl tau underwent a strong flare with a complex temperatureevolution, which is indicative of an event confined within a very largemagnetic structure (few stellar radii), similar to the ones found in ysos inthe orion nebula cluster.

astro-ph;0611520	the onset of x-ray emission in young stellar objects: a chandra  observation of the serpens star-forming region	aims: to study the properties of x-ray emissions from young stellar objects(ysos), through their evolution from class i to class iii and determine whetherclass 0 protostars emit in x-rays. methods: a deep chandra x-ray observation ofthe serpens star-forming region was obtained. the serpens cloud core is ideallysuited for this type of investigation, being populated by a dense and extremelyyoung cluster whose members are found in all different evolutionary stages,including six well studied class 0 sources. results: none of the six class 0protostars is detected in our observations, excluding the presence of sourceswith x-ray luminosities &gt; 0.4 10^30 erg/s (for column densities of the order of4 10^{23} cm^-2, or a_v ~ 200). a total of 85 x-ray sources are detected andthe light curves and spectra of 35 ysos are derived. there is a clear trend ofdecreasing absorbing column densities as one moves from class i to class iiisources, and, possibly, evidence of decreasing plasma temperatures, too. weobserve a strong, long-duration, flare from a class ii low-mass star, for whichwe derive a flaring loop length of the order of 20 stellar radii. we interpretthe flaring event as originating from a magnetic flux tube connecting the starto its circumstellar disk. the presence of such a disk is supported by thedetection, in the spectrum of this star, of 6.4 kev fe fluorescent emission.
