0902.4530	viscous propagation of mass flow variability in accretion discs	we study mass flow rate through a disc resulting from a varying mass supplyrate. variable mass supply rate occurs, e.g., during disc state transitions,and in interacting eccentric binaries. it is, however, damped by the viscosityof the disc. here, we calculate this damping in detail. we derive an analyticaldescription of the propagation of the flow rate using the solution oflynden-bell &amp; pringle, in which the disc is assumed to extend to infinity. inparticular, we derive the accretion-rate green's function, and its fouriertransform, which gives the fractional damping at a given variability frequency.we then compare this model to that of a finite disc with the mass supply at itsouter edge. we find significant differences with respect to the infinite discsolution, which we find to overestimate the viscous damping. in particular, theasymptotic form of the green's function is power-law for the infinite disc andexponential for the finite one. we then find a simple fitting form for thelatter, and also calculate its fourier transform. in general, the dampingbecomes very strong when the viscous time at the outer edge of the disc becomeslonger than the modulation time scale. we apply our results to a number ofastrophysical systems. we find the effect is much stronger in low-mass x-raybinaries, where the disc size is comparable to that of the roche lobe, than inhigh-mass binaries, where the wind-fed disc can have a much smaller size.

0905.1086	compton scattering as the explanation of the peculiar x-ray properties  of cyg x-3	we consider implications of a possible presence of a thomson-thick,low-temperature, plasma cloud surrounding the compact object in the binarysystem cyg x-3. the presence of such a cloud was earlier inferred from theenergy-independent orbital modulation of the x-ray flux and the lack of highfrequencies in its power spectra. here, we study the effect of comptonscattering by the cloud on the x-ray energy and power spectra, concentrating onthe hard spectral state. the process reduces the energy of the high-energybreak/cut-off in the energy spectra, which allows us to determine the thomsonoptical depth. this, together with the observed cut-off in the power spectrum,determines the size of the plasma to be 2x10^9 cm. at this size, the cloud willbe in thermal equilibrium in the photon field of the x-ray source, which yieldsthe cloud temperature of 3 kev, which refines the determination of the thomsonoptical depth to 7. at these parameters, thermal bremsstrahlung emission of thecloud becomes important as well. the physical origin of the cloud is likely tobe collision of the very strong stellar wind of the companion wolf-rayet starwith a small accretion disc formed by the wind accretion. our model thusexplains the peculiar x-ray energy and power spectra of cyg x-3.

0707.1880	superorbital variability of x-ray and radio emission of cyg x-1. i.  emission anisotropy of precessing sources	we study theoretical interpretations of the 150-d (superorbital) modulationobserved in x-ray and radio emission of cyg x-1 in the framework of modelsconnecting this phenomenon to precession. precession changes the orientation ofthe emission source (either disc or jet) relative to the observer. this leadsto emission modulation due to an anisotropic emission pattern of the source ororientation-dependent amount of absorbing medium along the line of sight orboth. we consider, in particular, anisotropy patterns of blackbody-typeemission, thermal comptonization in slab geometry, jet/outflow beaming, andabsorption in a coronal-type medium above the disc. we then fit these models tothe data from the rxte/asm, cgro/batse, and the ryle and green bank radiotelescopes, and find relatively small best-fit angles between the precessionand orbital planes, ~10-20 degrees. the thermal comptonization model for thex-ray emission explains well the observed decrease of the variability amplitudefrom 1 to 300 kev as a result of a reduced anisotropy of the emission due tomultiple scatterings. our modeling also yield the jet bulk velocity of~(0.3-0.5)c, which is in agreement with the previous constraint from the lackof an observed counterjet and lack of short-term x-ray/radio correlations.

0707.2032	the nature of the hard state of cygnus x-3	the x-ray binary cygnus x-3 is a highly variable x-ray source that displays awide range of observed spectral states. one of the main states is significantlyharder than the others, peaking at ~ 20 kev, with only a weak low-energycomponent. due to the enigmatic nature of this object, hidden inside the strongstellar wind of its wolf-rayet companion, it has remained unclear whether thisstate represents an intrinsic hard state, with truncation of the inner disc, orwhether it is just a result of increased local absorption. we study the x-raylight curves from rxte/asm and cgro/batse in terms of distributions andcorrelations of flux and hardness and find several signs of a bimodal behaviourof the accretion flow that are not likely to be the result of increasedabsorption in a surrounding medium. using integral observations, we model thebroad-band spectrum of cyg x-3 in its apparent hard state. we find that it canbe well described by a model of a hard state with a truncated disc, despite thelow cut-off energy, if the accreted power is supplied to the electrons in theinner flow in the form of acceleration rather than thermal heating, resultingin a hybrid electron distribution and a spectrum with a significantcontribution from non-thermal comptonization, usually observed only in softstates. the high luminosity of this non-thermal hard state implies that eitherthe transition takes place at significantly higher l/ledd than in the usualadvection models, or the mass of the compact object is &gt; 20 msun, possiblymaking it the most massive black hole observed in an x-ray binary in our galaxyso far. we find that an absorption model as well as a model of almost purecompton reflection also fit the data well, but both have difficultiesexplaining other results, in particular the radio/x-ray correlation.

1001.4362	lessons learnt from integral agn	the integral mission provides a large data set for studying the hard x-rayproperties of agn and allows to test the unified scheme for agn. we presentresults based on the analysis of 199 agn. a difference between the seyferttypes is detected in slightly flatter spectra with higher cut-off energies andlower luminosities for the more absorbed/type 2 agn. when applying a comptonreflection model, the underlying continua (photon index 1.95) appear the samein seyfert 1 and 2, and the reflection strength is r=1 in both cases, withdifferences in the inclination angle only. a difference is seen in the sensethat seyfert 1 are on average twice as luminous in hard x-rays than the seyfert2 galaxies. the unified model for seyfert galaxies seems to hold, showing inhard x-rays that the central engine is the same in seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies,seen under different inclination angle and absorption. based on our knowledgeof agn from integral data, we briefly outline open questions and investigationsto answer them. in this context an ultra-deep (&gt;= 12 ms) extragalactic fieldcan be a true legacy of the integral mission in the area of agn studies.

1002.1915	x/gamma-ray emission from hot accretion flows in agns	we present preliminary results of our study of the impact of strong gravityeffects on properties of the high energy radiation produced in accretion flowsaround supermassive black holes. we refine a model of the x-ray emission from ahot optically-thin flow by combining a fully general-relativistic (gr)hydrodynamical description of the flow with a fully gr description ofcomptonization. we find that emission from a flow around a rapidly rotatingblack hole is dominated by radiation produced within the innermost fewgravitational radii, the region where effects of the kerr metric are strong.the x-ray spectrum from such a flow depends on the inclination angle of theline of sight to the symmetry axis, with higher angles characterised by aharder slope and a higher cut-off energy.  under the (reasonable) assumption that the equatorial plane of a rotatingsupermassive black hole is aligned with the surrounding torus, these predictedproperties may provide a crucial extension of the unified model of agns,allowing to reconcile the model with systematic trends reported in a number ofstudies of the x-ray spectral properties of agns (indicating that type 2objects are harder than type 1 and that the relative amount of the reflectedradiation is larger in the latter). on the other hand, the model with a rapidlyrotating black hole predicts larger apparent luminosities for objects observedat higher viewing angles, while an opposite property (i.e. type 1 objects beingmore luminous than type 2) was revealed in the integral data.

1004.2124	first detection of vhe gamma-rays from sn 1006 by h.e.s.s	recent theoretical predictions of the lowest very high energy (vhe)luminosity of sn 1006 are only a factor 5 below the previously publishedh.e.s.s. upper limit, thus motivating further in-depth observations of thissource. deep observations at vhe energies (above 100 gev) were carried out withthe high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) of cherenkov telescopes from2003 to 2008. more than 100 hours of data have been collected and subjected toan improved analysis procedure. observations resulted in the detection of vhegamma-rays from sn 1006. the measured gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with apower-law, the flux is of the order of 1% of that detected from the crabnebula, and is thus consistent with the previously established h.e.s.s. upperlimit. the source exhibits a bipolar morphology, which is strongly correlatedwith non-thermal x-rays. because the thickness of the vhe-shell is compatiblewith emission from a thin rim, particle acceleration in shock waves is likelyto be the origin of the gamma-ray signal. the measured flux level can beaccounted for by inverse compton emission, but a mixed scenario that includesleptonic and hadronic components and takes into account the ambient matterdensity inferred from observations also leads to a satisfactory description ofthe multi-wavelength spectrum.

1005.0842	extreme flux states of ngc 4151 observed with integral	we present a comprehensive spectral analysis of all integral data obtained sofar for the x-ray--bright seyfert galaxy ngc 4151. we also use allcontemporaneous data from rxte, xmm, swift and suzaku. we find a linearcorrelation between the medium and hard-energy x-ray fluxes measured byintegral, which indicates an almost constant spectral index over six years. themajority of integral observations were made when the source was either at avery bright or very dim hard--x-ray state. we find that thermal comptonizationmodels applied to the bright state yields the plasma temperature of 50--70 kevand its optical depth of 1.3--2.6, depending on the assumed source geometry.for the dim state, these parameters are in the ranges of 180--230 kev and0.3--0.7, respectively. the compton parameter is y = 1 for all the spectra,indicating a stable geometry. using this result, we can determine thereflection effective solid angles associated with the close and distantreprocessing media as = 0.3 x 2pi and 0.2 x 2pi, respectively. the plasmaenergy balance, the weak disc reflection and a comparison of the uv fluxesilluminating the plasma to the observed ones are all consistent with an innerhot accretion surrounded by an outer cold disc. the disc truncation radius canbe determined from an approximate equipartition between the observed uv andx-ray emission, and from the fitted disc blackbody model, as 15 gravitationalradii. alternatively, our results can be explained by a mildly relativisticcoronal outflow.

1105.3206	a new snr with tev shell-type morphology: hess j1731-347	the recent discovery of the radio shell-type supernova remnant (snr),g353.6-0.7, in spatial coincidence with the unidentified tev source hessj1731-347 has motivated further observations of the source with the high energystereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) cherenkov telescope array to test a possibleassociation of the gamma-ray emission with the snr. with a total of 59 hours ofobservation, representing about four times the initial exposure available inthe discovery paper of hess j1731-347, the gamma-ray morphology is investigatedand compared with the radio morphology. an estimate of the distance is derivedby comparing the interstellar absorption derived from x-rays and the oneobtained from 12co and hi observations. the deeper gamma-ray observation of thesource has revealed a large shell-type structure with similar position andextension (r~0.25{\deg}) as the radio snr, thus confirming their association.by accounting for the h.e.s.s. angular resolution and projection effects withina simple shell model, the radial profile is compatible with a thin, spatiallyunresolved, rim. together with rx j1713.7-3946, rx j0852.0-4622 and sn 1006,hess j1731-347 is now the fourth snr with a significant shell morphology at tevenergies. the derived lower limit on the distance of the snr of 3.2 kpc is usedtogether with radio and x-ray data to discuss the possible origin of thegamma-ray emission, either via inverse compton scattering of electrons or thedecay of neutral pions resulting from proton-proton interaction.

1210.6513	identification of hess j1303-631 as a pulsar wind nebula through  gamma-ray, x-ray and radio observations	the previously unidentified very high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-raysource hess j1303-631, discovered in 2004, is re-examined including new datafrom the h.e.s.s. cherenkov telescope array. archival data from the xmm-newtonx-ray satellite and from the pmn radio survey are also examined. detailedmorphological and spectral studies of vhe \gamma-ray emission as well as of thexmm-newton x-ray data are performed. significant energy-dependent morphology ofthe \gamma-ray source is detected with high-energy emission (e &gt; 10 tev)positionally coincident with the pulsar psr j1301-6305 and lower energyemission (e &lt;2 tev) extending \sim 0.4^{\circ} to the south-east of the pulsar.the spectrum of the vhe source can be described with a power-law with anexponential cut-off n_{0} = (5.6 \pm 0.5) x 10^{-12} tev^-1 cm^-2 s^-1, \gamma= 1.5 \pm 0.2) and e_{\rm cut} = (7.7 \pm 2.2) tev. the pwn is also detected inx-rays, extending \sim 2-3' from the pulsar position towards the center of the\gamma-ray emission region. the spectral energy distribution (sed) is welldescribed by a one zone leptonic scenario which, with its associated caveats,predicts a very low average magnetic field for this source. significantenergy-dependent morphology of this source, as well as the identification of anassociated x-ray pwn from xmm-newton observations enable identification of thevhe source as an evolved pwn associated to the pulsar psr j1303-6305. however,the large discrepancy in emission region sizes and the low level of synchrotronradiation suggest a multi-population leptonic nature. the low implied magneticfield suggests that the pwn has undergone significant expansion. this wouldexplain the low level of synchrotron radiation and the difficulty in detectingcounterparts at lower energies, the reason this source was originallyclassified as a "dark" vhe \gamma-ray source.

0803.2217	a classification of the x-ray and radio states of cyg x-3 and their  long-term correlations	we present a detailed classification of the x-ray states of cyg x-3 based onthe spectral shape and a new classification of the radio states based on thelong-term correlated behaviour of the radio and soft x-ray light curves. wefind a sequence of correlations, starting with a positive correlation betweenthe radio and soft x-ray fluxes in the hard spectral state, changing to anegative one at the transition to soft spectral states. the temporal evolutioncan be in either direction on that sequence, unless the source goes into a veryweak radio state, from which it can return only following a major radio flare.the flare decline is via relatively bright radio states, which results in ahysteresis loop on the flux-flux diagram. we also study the hard x-ray lightcurve, and find its overall anticorrelation with the soft x-rays. during majorradio flares, the radio flux responds exponentially to the level of a hardx-ray high-energy tail. we also specify the detailed correspondence between theradio states and the x-ray spectral states. we compare our results to those ofblack-hole and neutron-star binaries. except for the effect of strongabsorption and the energy of the high-energy break in the hard state, the x-rayspectral states of cyg x-3 closely correspond to the canonical x-ray states ofblack-hole binaries. also, the radio/x-ray correlation closely corresponds tothat found in black-hole binaries, but it significantly differs from that inneutron-star binaries. overall, our results strongly support the presence of ablack hole in cyg x-3.

astro-ph;0501206	the transient hard x-ray tail of gx 17+2: new bepposax results	we report on results of two bepposax observations of the z source gx 17+2. inboth cases the source is in the horizontal branch of the colour-intensitydiagram. the persistent continuum can be fit by two-component models consistingof a blackbody plus a comptonization spectrum. with one of these models, twosolutions for the blackbody temperature of both the observed and seed photonsfor comptonization are equally accepted by the data. in the first observation,when the source is on the left part of the horizontal branch, we observe a hardtail extending up to 120 kev, while in the second observation, when the sourcemoves towards right in the same branch, the tail is no longer detected. thehard ($\ga 30$ kev) x-ray emission can be modeled either by a simple power-lawwith photon index $\gamma \sim$ 2.7, or assuming comptonization of $\sim$ 1 kevsoft photons off a hybrid thermal plus non-thermal electron plasma. thespectral index of the non-thermal injected electrons is $p \sim 1.7$. theobservation of hard {x-ray} emission only in the left part of the horizontalbranch could be indicative of the presence of a threshold in the accretion rateabove which the hard tail disappears. an emission line at 6.7 kev withequivalent width $\sim 30$ ev is also found in both observations. we discussthese results and their physical implications

(2003). the variability pattern, which we name $\xi$, ischaracterized by a pulsing behaviour, consisting of a main pulse and a shorter,softer, and smaller amplitude precursor pulse, on a timescale of 5 minutes inthe jem-x 3-35 kev lightcurve. we also present simultaneous rxte data. from astudy of the individual rxte/pca pulse profiles we find that the rising phaseis shorter and harder than the declining phase, which is opposite to what hasbeen observed in other otherwise similar variability classes in this source.the position in the colour-colour diagram throughout the revolution correspondsto state a (belloni et al. 2000) but not to any previously known variabilityclass. we separated the integral data into two subsets covering the maxima andminima of the pulses and fitted the resulting two broadband spectra with ahybrid thermal--non-thermal comptonization model. the fits show the source tobe in a soft state characterized by a strong disc component below ~6 kev andcomptonization by both thermal and non-thermal electrons at higher energies.

astro-ph;0508327	the high energy spectrum of ngc 4151	we present the first integral observations of the type 1.5 seyfert galaxy ngc4151. combining several integral observations performed during 2003, totalingabout 400 ks of exposure time, allows us to study the spectrum in the 2 - 300kev range. the measurements presented here reveal an overall spectrum fromx-rays up to soft gamma-rays that can be described by an absorbed (nh = 6.9e221/cm**2) model based on a compton continuum from a hot electron population (kt= 94 kev) from an optically thick (tau = 1.3) corona, reflected on coldmaterial (r=0.7), consistent with earlier claims. the time resolved analysisshows little variation of the spectral parameters over the duration of theintegral observations. the comparison with cgro/osse data shows that the samespectral model can be applied over a time span of 15 years, with fluxvariations of the order of a factor of 2 and changes in the underlyingcontinuum reflected by the temperature of the electron population (kt = 50 -100 kev). when modeled with an exponentially cut-off power law plus comptonreflection this results in photon indices ranging from gamma = 1.5 to gamma =1.9 and a cut-off energy in the range 100 - 500 kev.

astro-ph;0509851	the broad-band spectrum of cygnus x-1 measured by integral	the integral satellite extensively observed the black hole binary cygnus x-1from 2002 november to 2004 november during calibration, open time and coreprogram (galactic plane scan) observations. these data provide evidence forsignificant spectral variations over the period. in the framework of theaccreting black hole phenomenology, the source was most of the time in the hardstate and occasionally switched to the so-called "intermediate state". usingthe results of the analysis performed on these data, we present and compare thespectral properties of the source over the whole energy range (5 kev - 1 mev)covered by the high-energy instruments on board integral, in both observedspectral states. fe line and reflection component evolution occurs withspectral changes in the hard and soft components. the observed behaviour ofcygnus x-1 is consistent with the general picture of galactic black holes. ourresults give clues to the physical changes that took place in the system (discand corona) at almost constant luminosity during the spectral transitions andprovide new measures of the spectral model parameters. in particular, duringthe intermediate state of 2003 june, we observe in the cygnus x-1 data ahigh-energy tail at several hundred kev in excess of the thermal comptonizationmodel which suggests the presence of an additional non-thermal component.

astro-ph;0610017	jet radio emission in cygnus x-1 and its orbital modulation	we present results of our detailed theoretical study of the observed orbitalmodulation of the radio emission in cyg x-1. the modulation occurs due tofree-free absorption in the wind from the companion star varying with theorbital phase, and our results put strong constraints on the spatialdistribution of the jet radio emission at the frequencies of 2-15 ghz. acrucial role in enhancing the asymmetry of the wind absorption suffered by thejet emission is played by the irradiation by x-rays emitted in the vicinity ofthe black hole. this increases the wind temperature by more than order ofmagnitude with respect to that of the wind of an isolated supergiant. theobserved phase lags of the minima of the radio emission with respect to thespectroscopic zero phase strongly imply the bulk of the mass of the jet isnonrelativistic (~5 x 10^8 cm/s) within the jet core. the jet can, however,become relativistic outside the core. also, the jet can have a two-componentstructure, being slow on the outside and fast inside, in which case itssynchrotron-emitting part may be relativistic already in the core. we alsoconsider the observed superorbital modulation of the radio emission (with theperiod of ~150 d) and find it can be explained by a jet precession both causingvariable wind absorption and changing the jet doppler factor. finally, weconsider the case of cyg x-3, and show that its lack of observable orbitalradio modulation (in spite of strong modulation of x-rays) is explained by thatsystem being both much more compact and much more luminous than cyg x-1.

astro-ph;0701472	dependence of the orbital modulation of x-rays from 4u 1820-303 on the  accretion rate	we report the discovery, using rxte data, of a dependence of the x-rayorbital modulation depth on the x-ray spectral state in the ultracompact atollbinary \source. this state (measured by us by the position on the x-raycolour-colour diagram) is tightly coupled to the accretion rate, which, inturn, is coupled to the phase of the 170-d superorbital cycle of this source.the modulation depth is much stronger in the high-luminosity, so-called banana,state than in the low-luminosity, island, state. we find the x-ray modulationis independent of energy, which rules out bound-free x-ray absorption in anoptically thin medium as the cause of the modulation. we also find asignificant dependence of the offset phase of the orbital modulation on thespectral state, which favours the model in which the modulation is caused byscattering in hot gas around a bulge at the disc edge, which both size and theposition vary with the accretion rate. estimates of the source inclinationappear to rule out a model in which the bulge itself occults a part of anaccretion disc corona. we calculate the average flux of this source over thecourse of its superorbital variability (which has the period of 170 d), andfind it to be fully compatible with the model of accretion due to the angularmomentum loss via emission of gravitational radiation. also, we compare thedates of all x-ray bursts observed from this source by bepposax and rxte withthe rxte light curve, and find all of them to coincide with deep minima of theflux, confirming previous results based on smaller samples.
