0706.3368	the dust, planetesimals and planets of hd 38529	hd 38529 is a post-main sequence g8iii/iv star (3.5 gyr old) with a planetarysystem consisting of at least two planets having msin(i) of 0.8 mjup and 12.2mjup, semimajor axes of 0.13 au and 3.74 au, and eccentricities of 0.25 and0.35, respectively. spitzer observations show that hd 38529 has an excessemission above the stellar photosphere, with a signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) at70 micron of 4.7, a small excess at 33 micron (s/n=2.6) and no excess &lt;30micron. we discuss the distribution of the potential dust-producingplanetesimals from the study of the dynamical perturbations of the two knownplanets, considering in particular the effect of secular resonances. weidentify three dynamically stable niches at 0.4-0.8 au, 20-50 au and beyond 60au. we model the spectral energy distribution of hd 38529 to find out which ofthese niches show signs of harboring dust-producing plantesimals. the secularanalysis, together with the sed modeling resuls, suggest that the planetesimalsresponsible for most of the dust emission are likely located within 20-50 au, aconfiguration that resembles that of the jovian planets + kuiper belt in oursolar system. finally, we place upper limits (8e-6 lunar masses of 10 micronparticles) to the amount of dust that could be located in the dynamicallystable region that exists between the two planets (0.25--0.75 au).

0908.1385	unusually wide binaries: are they wide or unusual?	we describe an astrometric and spectroscopic campaign to confirm the youthand association of a complete sample of candidate wide companions in taurus andupper sco. our survey found fifteen new binary systems (3 in taurus and 12 inupper sco) with separations of 3-30" (500-5000 au) among all of the knownmembers with masses of 2.5-0.012 msun. the total sample of 49 wide systems inthese two regions conforms to only some expectations from field multiplicitysurveys. higher-mass stars have a higher frequency of wide binary companions,and there is a marked paucity of wide binary systems near the substellarregime. however, the separation distribution appears to be log-flat, ratherthan declining as in the field, and the mass ratio distribution is more biasedtoward similar-mass companions than the imf or the field g dwarf distribution.the maximum separation also shows no evidence of a limit at &lt;5000 au until theabrupt cessation of any wide binary formation at system masses of ~0.3 msun. weattribute this result to the post-natal dynamical sculpting that occurs formost field systems; our binary systems will escape to the field intact, butmost field stars are formed in denser clusters and do not. in summary, onlywide binary systems with total masses &lt;0.3 msun appear to be "unusually wide".

0909.0509	the coevality of young binary systems	multiple star systems are commonly assumed to form coevally; they thusprovide the anchor for most calibrations of stellar evolutionary models. inthis paper we study the binary population of the taurus-auriga association,using the component positions in an hr diagram in order to quantify thefrequency and degree of coevality in young binary systems. after identifyingand rejecting the systems that are known to be affected by systematic errors(due to further multiplicity or obscuration by circumstellar material), we findthat the relative binary ages, |delta log(tau)|, have an overall dispersion ofsigma~0.40 dex. random pairs of taurus members are coeval only to withinsigma~0.58 dex, indicating that taurus binaries are indeed more coeval than theassociation as a whole. however, the distribution of |delta log(tau)| suggeststwo populations, with ~2/3 of the sample appearing coeval to within the errors(sigma~0.16 dex) and the other ~1/3 distributed in an extended tail reaching|delta log(tau)|~0.4-0.9 dex. to explain the finding of a multi-peakeddistribution, we suggest that the tail of the differential age distributionincludes unrecognized hierarchical multiples, stars seen in scattered light, orstars with disk contamination; additional followup is required to rule out orcorrect for these explanations. the relative coevality of binary systems doesnot depend significantly on the system mass, mass ratio, or separation. indeed,any pair of taurus members wider than ~10' (~0.7 pc) shows the full age spreadof the association.

0909.4124	debris disks in the upper scorpius ob association	we present mips 24um and 70um photometry for 205 members of the upperscorpius ob association. these data are combined with published mips photometryfor 15 additional association members to assess the frequency of circumstellardisks around 5 myr old stars with spectral types between b0 and m5. twelvestars have a detectable 70um excess, each of which also has a detectable 24umexcess. a total of 54 stars are identified with a 24um excess more than 32%above the stellar photosphere. the mips observations reveal 19 excess sources-- 8 a/f/g stars and 11 k/m stars -- that were not previously identified withan 8um or 16um excess. the lack of short-wavelength emission and the weak 24umexcess suggests that these sources are debris systems or the remnants ofoptically thick primordial disks with inner holes. despite the wide range ofluminosities of the stars hosting apparent debris systems, the excesscharacteristics are consistent with all stars having dust at similar orbitalradii after factoring in variations in the radiation blowout particle size withspectral type. the results for upper sco are compared to similar photometricsurveys from the literature to re-evaluate the evolution of debris emission.after considering the completeness limits of published surveys and the effectsof stellar evolution on the debris luminosity, we find that the magnitude ofthe 24um excess around f-type stars increases between ages of 5 and 17 myr asfound by previous studies, but at &lt; 2.6 sigma confidence. for b7-a9 and g0-k5stars, any variations in the observed 24um excess emission over this age rangeare significant at less than 2 sigma confidence.

0708.2719	the stellar populations of praesepe and coma berenices	we present the results of a stellar membership survey of the nearby openclusters praesepe and coma berenices. we have combined archival survey datafrom the sdss, 2mass, usnob1.0, and ucac-2.0 surveys to compile proper motionsand photometry for ~5 million sources over 300 deg^2. of these sources, 1010stars in praesepe and 98 stars in coma ber are identified as candidate memberswith probability &gt;80%; 442 and 61 are identified as high-probability candidatesfor the first time. we estimate that this survey is &gt;90% complete across a widerange of spectral types (f0 to m5 in praesepe, f5 to m6 in coma ber). we havealso investigated the stellar mass dependence of each cluster's mass and radiusin order to quantify the role of mass segregation and tidal stripping inshaping the present-day mass function and spatial distribution of stars.praesepe shows clear evidence of mass segregation across the full stellar massrange; coma ber does not show any clear trend, but low number statistics wouldmask a trend of the same magnitude as in praesepe. the mass function forpraesepe (t~600 myr; m~500 msun) follows a power law consistent with that ofthe field present-day mass function, suggesting that any mass-dependent tidalstripping could have removed only the lowest-mass members (&lt;0.15 msun). comaber, which is younger but much less massive (t~400 myr; m~100 msun), follows asignificantly shallower power law. this suggests that some tidal stripping hasoccurred, but the low-mass stellar population has not been strongly depleteddown to the survey completeness limit (~0.12 msun).

1008.1265	a multi-color optical survey of the orion nebula cluster. ii. the h-r  diagram	we present a new analysis of the stellar population of the orion nebulacluster (onc) based on multi-band optical photometry and spectroscopy. we studythe color-color diagrams in bvi, plus a narrow-band filter centered at 6200a,finding evidences that intrinsic color scales valid for main-sequence dwarfsare incompatible with the onc, while a better agreement is found employingsynthetic intrinsic colors obtained constraining the typical lower surfacegravity of young stars. we refine these model colors even further, empirically,by comparison with a sample of onc stars with no accretion and no extinction.we consider the stars with known spectral types from the literature, and add 65newly classified stars from slit spectroscopy and 182 m-type from narrow-bandphotometry; in this way we isolate a sample of about 1000 stars with knownspectral type. we introduce a new method to self-consistently derive reddeningand accretion excess from the location of each star in the bvi color-colordiagram. this enables us to accurately determine the extinction of the oncmembers. we adopt a lower distance for the onc than previously assumed, basedon recent parallax measurements. with a careful choice also of the spectraltype-temperature transformation, we produce the new h-r diagram of the oncpopulation, more populated than previous works. with respect to previous works,we find higher luminosity for late-type stars and a lower luminosity for earlytypes. we determine the age distribution of the population, peaking at 2-3 myr,a higher age than previously estimated. we study the distribution of themembers in the mass-age plane, and find that taking into account selectioneffects due to incompleteness removes an apparent correlation between mass andage. we derive the imf for low- and intermediate-mass members of the onc, whichturns out to be model-dependent, and shows a turn-over at ~&lt;0.2msun.

1011.2201	two wide planetary-mass companions to solar-type stars in upper scorpius	at wide separations, planetary-mass and brown dwarf companions to solar typestars occupy a curious region of parameters space not obviously linked tobinary star formation or solar-system scale planet formation. these companionsprovide insight into the extreme case of companion formation (either binary orplanetary), and due to their relative ease of observation when compared toclose companions, they offer a useful template for our expectations of moretypical planets. we present the results from an adaptive optics imaging surveyfor wide (50-500 au) companions to solar type stars in upper scorpius. wereport one new discovery of a ~14 m_j companion around gsc 06214-00210, andconfirm that the candidate planetary mass companion 1rxs j160929.1-210524detected by lafreniere et al (2008) is in fact co-moving with its primary star.in our survey, these two detections correspond to ~4% of solar type starshaving companions in the 6-20 m_j mass and 200-500 au separation range. thisfigure is higher than would be expected if brown dwarfs and planetary masscompanions were drawn from an extrapolation of the binary mass function.finally, we discuss implications for the formation of these objects.

1011.2757	the mass-radius(-rotation?) relation for low-mass stars	the fundamental properties of low-mass stars are not as well understood asthose of their more massive counterparts. the best method for constrainingthese properties, especially masses and radii, is to study eclipsing binarysystems, but only a small number of late-type (m0 or later) systems have beenidentified and well-characterized to date. we present the discovery andcharacterization of six new m dwarf eclipsing binary systems. the twelve starsin these eclipsing systems have masses spanning 0.38-0.59 msun and orbitalperiods of 0.6--1.7 days, with typical uncertainties of ~0.3% in mass and0.5--2.0% in radius. combined with six known systems with high-precisionmeasurements, our results reveal an intriguing trend in the low-mass regime.for stars with m=0.35-0.80 msun, components in short-period binary systems (p&lt;1day; 12 stars) have radii which are inflated by up to 10% (mean=4.8+/-1.0%)with respect to evolutionary models for low-mass main-sequence stars, whereascomponents in longer-period systems (&gt;1.5 days; 12 stars) tend to have smallerradii (mean=1.7+/-0.7%). this trend supports the hypothesis that short-periodsystems are inflated by the influence of the close companion, most likelybecause they are tidally locked into very high rotation speeds that enhanceactivity and inhibit convection. in summary, very close binary systems are notrepresentative of typical m dwarfs, but our results for longer-period systemsindicate that the evolutionary models are broadly valid in the m~0.35-0.80 msunregime.

1101.4016	mapping the shores of the brown dwarf desert ii: multiple star formation  in taurus-auriga	we have conducted a high-resolution imaging study of the taurus-aurigastar-forming region in order to characterize the primordial outcome of multiplestar formation and the extent of the brown dwarf desert. our survey identified16 new binary companions to primary stars with masses of 0.25-2.5 msun, raisingthe total number of binary pairs (including components of high-order multiples)with separations of 3--5000 au to 90. we find that ~2/3--3/4 of all taurusmembers are multiple systems of two or more stars, while the other ~1/4--1/3appear to have formed as single stars; the distribution of high-ordermultiplicity suggests that fragmentation into a wide binary has no impact onthe subsequent probability that either component will fragment again. theseparation distribution for solar-type stars (0.7--2.5 msun) is nearly log-flatover separations of 3--5000 au, but lower-mass stars (0.25--0.7 msun) show apaucity of binary companions with separations of &gt;200 au. across this full massrange, companion masses are well described with a linear-flat function; allsystem mass ratios (q=m_b/m_a) are equally probable, apparently includingsubstellar companions. our results are broadly consistent with the two expectedmodes of binary formation (freefall fragmentation on large scales and diskfragmentation on small scales), but the distributions provide some clues as tothe epochs at which the companions are likely to form.

1109.4141	the role of multiplicity in disk evolution and planet formation	the past decade has seen a revolution in our understanding of protoplanetarydisk evolution and planet formation in single star systems. however, themajority of solar-type stars form in binary systems, so the impact of binarycompanions on protoplanetary disks is an important element in our understandingof planet formation. we have compiled a combined multiplicity/disk census oftaurus-auriga, plus a restricted sample of close binaries in other regions, inorder to explore the role of multiplicity in disk evolution. our results implythat the tidal influence of a close (&lt;40 au) binary companion significantlyhastens the process of protoplanetary disk dispersal, as ~2/3 of all closebinaries promptly disperse their disks within &lt;1 myr after formation. however,prompt disk dispersal only occurs for a small fraction of wide binaries andsingle stars, with ~80%-90% retaining their disks for at least ~2--3 myr (butrarely for more than ~5 myr). our new constraints on the disk clearingtimescale have significant implications for giant planet formation; most singlestars have 3--5 myr within which to form giant planets, whereas most closebinary systems would have to form giant planets within &lt;1 myr. if coreaccretion is the primary mode for giant planet formation, then gas giants inclose binaries should be rare. conversely, since almost all single stars have asimilar period of time within which to form gas giants, their relative rarityin rv surveys indicates either that the giant planet formation timescale isvery well-matched to the disk dispersal timescale or that features beyond thedisk lifetime set the likelihood of giant planet formation.

1109.5900	mapping the shores of the brown dwarf desert iii: young moving groups	we present the results of an aperture masking interferometry survey forsubstellar companions around 67 members of the young (~8-200myr) nearby(~5-86pc) ab doradus, beta pictoris, hercules-lyra, tw hya, andtucana-horologium stellar associations. observations were made at near infraredwavelengths between 1.2-3.8 microns using the adaptive optics facilities of thekeck ii, vlt ut4, and palomar hale telescopes. typical contrast ratios of~100-200 were achieved at angular separations between ~40-320mas, with oursurvey being 100% complete for companions with masses below 0.25\msolar acrossthis range. we report the discovery of a $0.52 \pm 0.09$\msolar companion tohip14807, as well as the detections and orbits of previously known stellarcompanions to hd16760, hd113449, and hd160934. we show that the companion tohd16760 is in a face-on orbit, resulting in an upward revision of its mass from$m_2 \sin i \sim 14$\mjupiter to $m_2 = 0.28 \pm 0.04$\msolar. no substellarcompanions were detected around any of our sample members, despite our abilityto detect companions with masses below 80\mjupiter for 50 of our targets: ofthese, our sensitivity extended down to 40\mjupiter around 30 targets, with asubset of 22 subject to the still more stringent limit of 20\mjupiter. astatistical analysis of our non-detection of substellar companions allows us toplace constraints on their frequency around ~0.2-1.5\msolar stars. inparticular, considering companion mass distributions that have been proposed inthe literature, we obtain an upper limit estimate of ~9-11% for the frequencyof 20-80\mjupiter companions between 3-30au at 95% confidence, assuming thattheir semimajor axes are distributed according to $d\mathcal{n}/da \proptoa^{-1}$ in this range.

1112.1725	the dynamical mass and three-dimensional orbit of hr7672b: a benchmark  brown dwarf with high eccentricity	the companion to the g0v star hr7672 directly imaged by liu et al. (2002) hasmoved measurably along its orbit since the discovery epoch, making it possibleto determine its dynamical properties. originally targeted with adaptive opticsbecause it showed a long-term radial velocity acceleration (trend), we havemonitored this star with precise doppler measurements and have now establisheda 24 year time baseline. the radial velocity variations show significantcurvature (change in the acceleration) including an inflection point. we havealso obtained a recent image of hr7672b with nirc2 at keck. the astrometry alsoshows curvature. in this paper, we use jointly-fitted doppler and astrometricmodels to calculate the three-dimensional orbit and dynamical mass of thecompanion. the mass of the host star is determined using a direct radiusmeasurement from chara interferometry in combination with high resolutionspectroscopic modeling. we find that hr7672b has a highly eccentric,$e=0.50^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$, near edge-on, $i=97.3^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$ deg, orbit withsemimajor axis, $a=18.3^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$ au. the mass of the companion is$m=68.7^{+2.4}_{-3.1}m_j$ at the 68.2% confidence level. hr7672b thus residesnear the substellar boundary, just below the hydrogen-fusing limit. thesemeasurements of the companion mass are independent of its brightness andspectrum and establish hr7672b as a rare and precious "benchmark" brown dwarfwith a well-determined mass, age, and metallicity essential for testingtheoretical evolutionary models and synthetic spectral models. it is presentlythe only directly imaged l,t,y-dwarf known to produce an rv trend around asolar-type star.

1112.2711	the initial mass function of the orion nebula cluster across the  h-burning limit	we present a new census of the orion nebula cluster (onc) over a large fieldof view (&gt;30'x30'), significantly increasing the known population of stellarand substellar cluster members with precisely determined properties. we developand exploit a technique to determine stellar effective temperatures fromoptical colors, nearly doubling the previously available number of objects witheffective temperature determinations in this benchmark cluster. our techniqueutilizes colors from deep photometry in the i-band and in two medium-bandfilters at lambda~753 and 770nm, which accurately measure the depth of amolecular feature present in the spectra of cool stars. from these colors wecan derive effective temperatures with a precision corresponding to better thanone-half spectral subtype, and importantly this precision is independent of theextinction to the individual stars. also, because this technique utilizes onlyphotometry redward of 750nm, the results are only mildly sensitive to opticalveiling produced by accretion. completing our census with previously availabledata, we place some 1750 sources in the hertzsprung-russel diagram and assignmasses and ages down to 0.02 solar masses. at faint luminosities, we detect alarge population of background sources which is easily separated in ourphotometry from the bona fide cluster members. the resulting initial massfunction of the cluster has good completeness well into the substellar massrange, and we find that it declines steeply with decreasing mass. this suggestsa deficiency of newly formed brown dwarfs in the cluster compared to thegalactic disk population.

1112.3191	a substellar common proper motion companion to the pleiad hii 1348	we announce the identification of a proper motion companion to the star hii1348, a k5v member of the pleiades open cluster. the existence of a faint pointsource 1.1arcsec away from hii 1348 was previously known from adaptive opticsimaging by bouvier et al. however, because of a high likelihood of backgroundstar contamination and in the absence of follow-up astrometry, bouvier et al.tentatively concluded that the candidate companion was not physicallyassociated with hii 1348. we establish the proper motion association of thepair from adaptive optics imaging with the palomar 5m telescope. adaptiveoptics spectroscopy with the integral field spectrograph osiris on the keck 10mtelescope reveals that the companion has a spectral type of m8\pm1. accordingto substellar evolution models, the m8 spectral type resides within thesubstellar mass regime at the age of the pleiades. the primary itself is aknown double-lined spectroscopic binary, which makes the resolved companion,hii 1348b, the least massive and widest component of this hierarchical triplesystem and the first substellar companion to a stellar primary in the pleiades.

1206.4995	multiple star formation to the bottom of the imf	the frequency and properties of multiple star systems offer powerful tests ofstar formation models. multiplicity surveys over the past decade have shownthat binary properties vary strongly with mass, but the functional forms andthe interplay between frequency and semimajor axis remain largelyunconstrained. we present the results of a large-scale survey of multiplicityat the bottom of the imf in several nearby young associations, encompassing 78very low mass members observed with keck laser guide star adaptive optics. oursurvey confirms the overall trend observed in the field for lower-mass binarysystems to be less frequent and more compact, including a null detection forany substellar binary systems with separations wider than ~7 au. combined witha bayesian re-analysis of existing surveys, our results demonstrate that thebinary frequency and binary separations decline smoothly between masses of 0.5msun and 0.02 msun, though we can not distinguish the functional form of thisdecline due to a degeneracy between the total binary frequency and the meanbinary separation. we also show that the mass ratio distribution becomesprogressively more concentrated at q~1 for declining masses, though a smallnumber of systems appear to have unusually wide separations and low mass ratiosfor their mass. finally, we compare our results to synthetic binary populationsgenerated by smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations, noting thesimilarities and discussing possible explanations for the differences.

1311.7024	ages of young stars	determining the sequence of events in the formation of stars and planetarysystems and their time-scales is essential for understanding those processes,yet establishing ages is fundamentally difficult because we lack directindicators. in this review we discuss the age challenge for young stars,specifically those less than ~100 myr old. most age determination methods thatwe discuss are primarily applicable to groups of stars but can be used toestimate the age of individual objects. a reliable age scale is establishedabove 20 myr from measurement of the lithium depletion boundary (ldb) in youngclusters, and consistency is shown between these ages and those from the uppermain sequence and the main sequence turn-off -- if modest core convection androtation is included in the models of higher-mass stars. other availablemethods for age estimation include the kinematics of young groups, placingstars in hertzsprung-russell diagrams, pulsations and seismology, surfacegravity measurement, rotation and activity, and lithium abundance. we revieweach of these methods and present known strengths and weaknesses. below ~20myr, both model-dependent and observational uncertainties grow, the situationis confused by the possibility of age spreads, and no reliable absolute agesyet exist. the lack of absolute age calibration below 20 myr should be borne inmind when considering the lifetimes of protostellar phases and circumstellarmaterial.

1403.1675	an optical spectroscopic study of t tauri stars. i. photospheric  properties	measurements of masses and ages of young stars from their location in the hrdiagram are limited by not only the typical observational uncertainties thatapply to field stars, but also by large systematic uncertainties related tocircumstellar phenomena. in this paper, we analyze flux calibrated opticalspectra to measure accurate spectral types and extinctions of 283 nearby ttauri stars. the primary advances in this paper are (1) the incorporation of asimplistic accretion continuum in optical spectral type and extinctionmeasurements calculated over the full optical wavelength range and (2) theuniform analysis of a large sample of stars. comparisons between thenon-accreting tts photospheric templates and stellar photosphere models areused to derive conversions from spectral type to temperature. differencesbetween spectral types can be subtle and difficult to discern, especially whenaccounting for accretion and extinction. the spectral types measured here aremostly consistent with spectral types measured over the past decade. however,our new spectral types are 1-2 subclasses later than literature spectral typesfor the original members of the twa and are discrepant with literature valuesfor some well known taurus cttss. our extinction measurements are consistentwith other optical extinction measurements but are typically 1 mag lower thannir measurements, likely the result of methodological differences and thepresence of nir excesses in most cttss. as an illustration of the impact ofaccretion, spt, and extinction uncertainties on the hr diagrams of youngclusters, we find that the resulting luminosity spread of stars in the twa is15-30%. the luminosity spread in the twa and previously measured for binarystars in taurus suggests that for a majority of stars, protostellar accretionrates are not large enough to significantly alter the subsequent evolution.

1410.5442	a pulsation search among young brown dwarfs and very low mass stars	in 2005, palla &amp; baraffe proposed that brown dwarfs (bds) and very low massstars (vlmss; &lt;0.1 solar masses) may be unstable to radial oscillations duringthe pre-main-sequence deuterium burning phase. with associated periods of 1-4hours, this potentially new class of pulsation offers unprecedentedopportunities to probe the interiors and evolution of low-mass objects in the1-15 million year age range. following up on reports of short-periodvariability in young clusters, we designed a high-cadence photometricmonitoring campaign to search for deuterium-burning pulsation among a sample of348 bds and vlmss in the four young clusters $\sigma$ orionis, chamaeleon i, ic348, and upper scorpius. in the resulting light curves we achieved sensitivityto periodic signals of amplitude several millimagnitudes, on timescales from 15minutes to two weeks. despite the exquisite data quality, we failed to detectany periodicities below seven hours. we conclude that d-burning pulsations arenot able to grow to observable amplitudes in the early pre-main sequence. inspite of the non-detection, we did uncover a rich set of variability behavior-both periodic and aperiodic- on day to week timescales. we present newcompilations of variable sources from our sample, as well as three newcandidate cluster members in chamaeleon i.

1501.06609	csi 2264: characterizing young stars in ngc 2264 with short-duration,  periodic flux dips in their light curves	we identify nine young stellar objects (ysos) in the ngc 2264 star-formingregion with optical {\em corot} light curves exhibiting short-duration,shallow, periodic flux dips. all of these stars have infrared (ir) excessesthat are consistent with their having inner disk walls near the keplerianco-rotation radius. the repeating photometric dips have fwhm generally lessthan one day, depths almost always less than 15%, and periods (3&lt;p&lt;11 days)consistent with dust near the keplerian co-rotation period. the flux dips varyconsiderably in their depth from epoch to epoch, but usually persist forseveral weeks and, in two cases, were present in data collected on successiveyears. for several of these stars, we also measure the photospheric rotationperiod and find that the rotation and dip periods are the same, as predicted bystandard "disk-locking" models. we attribute these flux dips to clumps ofmaterial in or near the inner disk wall, passing through our line of sight tothe stellar photosphere. in some cases, these dips are also present insimultaneous {\em spitzer} irac light curves at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. wecharacterize the properties of these dips, and compare the stars with lightcurves exhibiting this behavior to other classes of yso in ngc 2264. a numberof physical mechanisms could locally increase the dust scale height near theinner disk wall, and we discuss several of those mechanisms; the most plausiblemechanisms are either a disk warp due to interaction with the stellar magneticfield or dust entrained in funnel-flow accretion columns arising near the innerdisk wall.

1505.06518	empirical isochrones for low mass stars in nearby young associations	absolute ages of young stars are important for many issues in pre-mainsequence stellar and circumstellar evolution but are long recognized asdifficult to derive and calibrate. in this paper, we use literature spectraltypes and photometry to construct empirical isochrones in hr diagrams forlow-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the eta cha, epsilon cha, and tw hyaassociations and the beta pic and tuc-hor moving groups. a successful theory ofpre-main sequence evolution should match the shapes of the stellar loci forthese groups of young stars. however, when comparing the combined empiricalisochrones to isochrones predicted from evolutionary models, discrepancies leadto a spectral type (mass) dependence in stellar age estimates. improvedprescriptions for convection and boundary conditions in the latest models ofpre-main sequence models lead to a significantly improved correspondencebetween empirical and model isochrones, with small offsets at low temperaturesthat may be explained by observational uncertainties or by model limitations.independent of model predictions, linear fits to combined stellar loci of theseregions provide a simple empirical method to order clusters by luminosity witha reduced dependence on spectral type. age estimates calculated from varioussets of modern models that reproduce li depletion boundary ages of the beta picmoving group also imply a ~4 myr age for the low mass members of the upper scoob association, which is younger than the 11 myr age that has been recentlyestimated for intermediate mass members.

1506.01126	a simple calculation in service of constraining the rate of fu orionis  outburst events from photometric monitoring surveys	an enigmatic and rare type of young stellar object is the fu orionis class.the members are interpreted as "outbursting," that is, currently in a state ofenhanced accretion by several orders of magnitude relative to the more modestdisk-to-star accretion rates measured in typical t tauri stars. they are key toour understanding of the history of stellar mass assembly and pre-main sequenceevolution, as well as critical to consider in the chemical and physicalevolution of the circumstellar environment -- where planets form. a commonsupposition is that *all* t tauri stars undergo repeated such outbursts, morefrequently in their earlier evolutionary stages when the disks are moremassive, so as to build up the requisite amount of stellar mass on the requiredtime scale. however, the actual data supporting this traditional picture ofepisodically enhanced disk accretion are limited, and the observationalproperties of the known sample of fu ori objects quite diverse. to improve ourunderstanding of these rare objects, we outline the logic for meaningfullyconstraining the rate of fu ori outbursts and present numbers to guideparameter choices in the analysis of time domain surveys.

(2000). we use our low-gravity spectra toinvestigate the strength of the li i line as a function of age. the data weaklysuggest that for early- to mid-l dwarfs the line strength reaches a maximum fora few 100 myr, whereas for much older (few gyr) and much younger (&lt;100 myr) ldwarfs the line is weaker or undetectable. we show that a weakening of lithiumat lower gravities is predicted by model atmosphere calculations, an effectpartially corroborated by existing observational data. larger samplescontaining l dwarfs of well determined ages are needed to further test thisempirically. if verified, this result would reinforce the caveat first cited inkirkpatrick et al.

astro-ph;0404292	the spectroscopically determined substellar mass function of the orion  nebula cluster	we present a spectroscopic study of candidate brown dwarf members of theorion nebula cluster (onc). we obtained new j- and/or k-band spectra of ~100objects within the onc which are expected to be substellar based on theirk,(h-k) magnitudes and colors. spectral classification in the near-infrared ofyoung low mass objects is described, including the effects of surface gravity,veiling due to circumstellar material, and reddening. from our derived spectraltypes and existing near-infrared photometry we construct an hr diagram for thecluster. masses are inferred for each object and used to derive the brown dwarffraction and assess the mass function for the inner 5.'1 x 5.'1 of the onc,down to ~0.02 solar masses. the derived logarithmic mass function rises to apeak at ~0.2 solar masses, similar to previous imf determinations derived frompurely photometric methods, but falls off more sharply at the hydrogen-burninglimit before leveling through the substellar regime. we compare the massfunction derived here for the inner onc to those presented in recent literaturefor the sparsely populated taurus cloud members and the rich cluster ic 348. wefind good agreement between the shapes and peak values of the onc and ic 348mass distributions, but little similarity between the onc and taurus results.

astro-ph;0408528	initial results from the palomar adaptive optics survey of young  solar-type stars: a brown dwarf and three stellar companions	we present first results from the palomar adaptive optics survey of youngstars conducted at the hale 5 m telescope. through direct imaging we havediscovered a brown dwarf and two low-mass stellar companions to the youngsolar-type stars hd 49197, hd 129333 (ek dra), and v522 per, and confirmed apreviously suspected companion to rx j0329.1+0118 (sterzik et al. 1997), atrespective separations of 0.95" (43 au), 0.74" (25 au), 2.09" (400 au), and3.78" (380 au). physical association of each binary system is establishedthrough common proper motion and/or low-resolution infrared spectroscopy. basedon the companion spectral types, we estimate their masses at 0.06, 0.20, 0.13,and 0.20 msun, respectively. from analysis of our imaging data combined witharchival radial velocity data, we find that the spatially resolved companion tohd 129333 is potentially identical to the previously identified spectroscopiccompanion to this star (duquennoy &amp; mayor 1991). however, a discrepancy withthe absolute magnitude suggests that the two companions could also be distinct,with the resolved one being the outermost component of a triple system. thebrown dwarf hd 49197b is a new member of a growing list of directly imagedsub-stellar companions at 10-1000 au separations from main sequence stars,indicating that such brown dwarfs may be more common than initially speculated.

astro-ph;0412143	adaptive optics imaging of the au microscopii circumstellar disk:  evidence for dynamical evolution	we present an h-band image of the light scattered from circumstellar dustaround the nearby (10 pc) young m star au microscopii (au mic, gj 803, hd197481), obtained with the keck adaptive optics system. we resolve the diskboth vertically and radially, tracing it over 17-60 au from the star. our aumic observations thus offer the possibility to probe at high spatial resolution(0.04" or 0.4 au per resolution element) for morphological signatures of thedebris disk on solar-system scales. various sub-structures (dust clumps andgaps) in the au mic disk may point to the existence of orbiting planets. noplanets are seen in our h-band image down to a limiting mass of 1 m_jup at &gt;20au, although the existence of smaller planets can not be excluded from thecurrent data. modeling of the disk surface brightness distribution at h-bandand r-band, in conjunction with the optical to sub-millimeter spectral energydistribution, allows us to constrain the disk geometry and the dust grainproperties. we confirm the nearly edge-on orientation of the disk inferred fromprevious observations, and deduce an inner clearing radius &lt;=10 au. we findevidence for a lack of small grains in the inner (&lt;60 au) disk, either as aresult of primordial disk evolution, or because of destruction bypoynting-robertson and/or corpuscular drag. a change in the power-law index ofthe surface brightness profile is observed near 33 au, similar to a featureknown in the profile of the beta pic circumstellar debris disk. by comparingthe time scales for inter-particle collisions and poynting-robertson dragbetween the two systems, we argue that the breaks are linked to one of thesetwo processes.

astro-ph;0506049	x-ray emission from young brown dwarfs in the orion nebula cluster	we use the sensitive x-ray data from the chandra orion ultradeep project(coup) to study the x-ray properties of 34 spectroscopically-identified browndwarfs with near-infrared spectral types between m6 and m9 in the core of theorion nebula cluster. nine of the 34 objects are clearly detected as x-raysources. the apparently low detection rate is in many cases related to thesubstantial extinction of these brown dwarfs; considering only the bds with$a_v \leq 5$ mag, nearly half of the objects (7 out of 16) are detected inx-rays. our 10-day long x-ray lightcurves of these objects exhibit strongvariability, including numerous flares. while one of the objects was onlydetected during a short flare, a statistical analysis of the lightcurvesprovides evidence for continuous (`quiescent') emission in addition to flaresfor all other objects. of these, the $\sim$ m9 brown dwarf coup 1255 = hc 212is one of the coolest known objects with a clear detection of quiescent x-rayemission. the x-ray properties (spectra, fractional x-ray luminosities, flarerates) of these young brown dwarfs are similar to those of the low-mass starsin the onc, and thus there is no evidence for changes in the magnetic activityaround the stellar/substellar boundary, which lies at $\sim$ m6 for oncsources. since the x-ray properties of the young brown dwarfs are also similarto those of m6--m9 field stars, the key to the magnetic activity in very coolobjects seems to be the effective temperature, which determines the degree ofionization in the atmosphere.

astro-ph;0506434	formation and evolution of planetary systems: cold outer disks  associated with sun-like stars	we present the discovery of debris systems around three solar mass starsbased upon observations performed with the spitzer space telescope as part of alegacy science program, ``the formation and evolution of planetary systems''(feps). we also confirm the presence of debris around two other stars. all thestars exhibit infrared emission in excess of the expected photospheres in the70 micron band, but are consistent with photospheric emission at &lt;= 33 micron.this restricts the maximum temperature of debris in equilibrium with thestellar radiation to t &lt; 70 k. we find that these sources are relatively old inthe feps sample, in the age range 0.7 - 3 gyr. based on models of the spectralenergy distributions, we suggest that these debris systems represent materialsgenerated by collisions of planetesimal belts. we speculate on the nature ofthese systems through comparisons to our own kuiper belt, and on the likelyplanet(s) responsible for stirring the system and ultimately releasing dustthrough collisions. we further report observations of a nearby star hd 13974 (d=11 pc) that is indistinguishable from a bare photosphere at both 24 micron and70 micron. the observations place strong upper limits on the presence of anycold dust in this nearby system (l_ir/l_* &lt; 10^{-5.2}).

0809.0893	spatial distributions of young stars	we analyze the spatial distributions of young stars in taurus-auriga andupper sco as determined from the two-point correlation function (i.e. the meansurface density of neighbors). the corresponding power-law fits allow us todetermine the fractal dimensions of each association's spatial distribution,measure the stellar velocity dispersions, and distinguish between the boundbinary population and chance alignments of members. we find that the fractaldimension of taurus is d~1.05, consistent with its filamentary structure. thefractal dimension of upper sco may be even shallower (d~0.7), but this fit isuncertain due to the limited area and possible spatially-variableincompleteness. we also find that random stellar motions have erased allprimordial structure on scales of &lt;0.07 degrees in taurus and &lt;1.7 degrees inupper sco; given ages of ~1 myr and ~5 myr, the corresponding internal velocitydispersions are ~0.2 km/s and ~1.0 km/s, respectively. finally, we find thatbinaries can be distinguished from chance alignments at separations of &lt;120"(17000 au) in taurus and 75" (11000 au) in upper sco. the binary populations inthese associations that we previously studied, spanning separations of 3-30",are dominated by binary systems. however, the few lowest-mass pairs (m_prim &lt;0.3 m_sun) might be chance alignments.

astro-ph;0511083	observational constraints on dust disk lifetimes: implications for  planet formation	(abridged) thus far our impressions regarding the evolutionary time scalesfor young circumstellar disks have been based on small number statistics. overthe past decade, however, in addition to precision study of individualstar/disk systems, substantial observational effort has been invested inobtaining less detailed data on large numbers of objects in young starclusters. this has resulted in a plethora of information now enablingstatistical studies of disk evolutionary diagnostics. along an ordinate one canmeasure disk presence or strength through indicators such as ultraviolet/blueexcess or spectroscopic emission lines tracing accretion, infrared excesstracing dust, or millimeter flux measuring mass. along an abscissa one cantrack stellar age.  while bulk trends in disk indicators versus age are evident, observationalerrors affecting both axes, combined with systematic errors in ourunderstanding of stellar ages, both cloud and bias any such trends thusdetailed understanding of the physical processes involved in disk dissipationand of the relevant time scales remains elusive. nevertheless, a clear effectin current data that is unlikely to be altered by data analysis improvements isthe dispersion in disk lifetimes. the age at which evidence for inner accretiondisks ceases to be apparent for the vast majority (90%) of stars is in therange 3-8 myr. more distant, terrestrial zone dust is traced by mid-infraredemission where sufficient sensitivity and uniform data collection are only nowbeing realized with data return from the spitzer space telescope.

0809.1436	a large-area search for low-mass objects in upper scorpius ii: age and  mass distributions	we present continued results from a wide-field, ~150 deg^2, opticalphotometric and spectroscopic survey of the northern part of the ~5 myr-oldupper scorpius ob association. photometry and spectral types were used toderive effective temperatures and luminosities and place newly identifiedassociation members onto a theoretical hertzsprung-russell diagram. from oursurvey, we have discovered 145 new low mass members of the association, anddetermined ~10% of these objects to be actively accreting material from asurrounding circumstellar disk. based on comparison of the spatialdistributions of low and high mass association members, we find no evidence forspatial segregation by mass within the northern portion of the association.measured data are combined with pre-main sequence evolutionary models to derivea mass and age for each star. using monte carlo simulations we show that,taking into account known observational uncertainties, the observed agedispersion for the low mass population in usco is consistent with all starsforming in a single burst ~5 myr ago, and place an upper limit of +/-3 myr onthe age spread if the star formation rate has been constant in time. we derivethe first spectroscopic mass function for usco that extends into the substellarregime, and compare these results to those for three other young clusters andassociations.

astro-ph;0607514	hd 203030b: an unusually cool young sub-stellar companion near the l/t  transition	we present the discovery of a brown-dwarf companion to the 130-400 myr-old g8v star hd 203030. separated by 11.9" (487 au in projection) from its host star,hd 203030b has an estimated mass of 0.023 (+0.008;-0.011) solar masses. thek-band spectral type of l7.5+/-0.5 places hd 203030b near the critical l/ttransition in brown dwarfs, which is characterized by the rapid disappearanceof dust in sub-stellar photospheres. from a comparative analysis withwell-characterized field l/t transition dwarfs, we find that, despite its youngage, hd 203030b has a bolometric luminosity similar to the &gt;1 gyr-old fielddwarfs. adopting a radius from current models of sub-stellar evolution, wehence obtain that the effective temperature of hd 203030b is only 1206(+74;-116) k, markedly lower than the ~1440 k effective temperatures of fieldl/t transition dwarfs. the temperature discrepancy can be resolved if either:(1) the ages of field brown dwarfs have been over-estimated by a factor of\~1.5, leading to under-estimated radii, or (2) the lower effective temperatureof hd 203030b is related to its young age, implying that the effectivetemperature at the l/t transition is gravity-dependent.

astro-ph;0609048	a distributed population of low mass pre-main sequence stars near the  taurus molecular clouds	we present a drift scan survey covering a ~5 deg by 50 deg region toward thesouthern portion of the taurus-auriga molecular cloud. data taken in the b,r,ifilters with the quest-2 camera on the palomar 48-inch telescope were combinedwith 2mass near-infrared photometry to select candidate young stars. follow-upoptical spectroscopy of 190 candidates led to identification of 42 new low masspre-main sequence stars with spectral types m4-m8, of which approximately halfexhibit surface gravity signatures similar to known taurus stars while theother half exhibit surface gravity signatures similar to members of thesomewhat older upper sco, tw hya and beta pic associations. the pre-mainsequence stars are spread over ~35 deg, and many are located well outside ofpreviously explored regions. from assessment of the spatial and proper motiondistributions, we argue that the new pre-main sequence stars identified farfrom the clouds cannot have originated from the vicinity of the 1-2 myr-oldsubclusters which contain the bulk of the identified taurus members, butinstead represent a newly-identified area of recent star-formation near theclouds.

astro-ph;0702545	the role of mass and environment in multiple star formation: a 2mass  survey of wide multiplicity in three young associations	we present the results of a search for wide binary systems among 783 membersof three nearby young associations: taurus-auriga, chamaeleon i, and twosubgroups of upper scorpius. near-infrared (jhk) imagery from 2mass wasanalyzed to search for wide (1-30"; ~150-4500 au) companions to knownassociation members, using color-magnitude cuts to reject likely backgroundstars. we identify a total of 131 candidate binary companions with colorsconsistent with physical association, of which 39 have not been identifiedpreviously in the literature. our results suggest that the wide binaryfrequency is a function of both mass and environment, with significantly higherfrequencies among high-mass stars than lower-mass stars and in the tassociations than in the ob association. we discuss the implications for widebinary formation and conclude that the environmental dependence is not a directresult of stellar density or total association mass, but instead might dependon another environmental parameter like the gas temperature. we also analyzethe mass ratio distribution as a function of mass and find that it agrees withthe distribution for field stars to within the statistical uncertainties. thebinary populations in these associations generally follow the empiricalmass-maximum separation relation observed for field binaries, but we have foundone candidate low-mass system (usco-160611.9-193532; mtot~0.4 msun) which has aprojected separation (10.8"; 1550 au) much larger than the suggested limit forits mass.

astro-ph;0703642	an assessment of hr diagram constraints on ages and age spreads in  star-forming regions and young clusters	pre-main sequence evolutionary theory is not well-calibrated to observations.with care, the observed quantities can be converted into effective temperatureand luminosity (i.e. the hertzsprung-russell diagram) which the theoreticalcalculations also predict as a function of stellar mass and age. for a sampleof nearby young stellar clusters and associations ranging in age from &lt;1 myr to&gt;100 myr, we have tested the loci of luminosity as a function of effectivetemperature against various sets of predicted pre-main sequence isochrones. aswe found in hillenbrand &amp; white (2004) which tested stellar masses, here forthe stellar ages there are two conclusions: some evolutionary calculations farebetter than others in reproducing the empirical sequences, and systematicdifferences between all pre-main sequence evolutionary calculations and thedata are apparent. we also simulate hypothetical clusters of varying starformation history and compare the resulting hr diagram predictions to observedclusters. our efforts are directed towards quantitative assessment of**apparent** luminosity spreads in star forming regions and young clusters,which are often erroneously interpreted as **true** luminosity spreadsindicative of **true** age spreads.

astro-ph;9902198	the stellar initial mass function: constraints from young clusters and  theoretical perspectives	we summarize recent observational and theoretical progress aimed atunderstanding the origin of the stellar initial mass function (imf) withspecific focus on galactic star-forming regions. we synthesize data fromvarious efforts to determine the imf in very young, partially-embedded stellarclusters and find: i) no significant variations in the low-mass imf have beenobserved between different star-forming regions; and ii) the mass distributionsof young stars just emerging from molecular clouds are consistent with havingbeen drawn from the imf derived from field stars in the solar neighborhood.these results apply only to gross characterizations of the imf (e.g. the ratioof high to low mass stars); present observations do not rule out more subtleregional differences. further studies are required in order to assess whetheror not there is evidence for a universal turnover near the hydrogen--burninglimit. we also provide a general framework for discussing theories of the imf,and summarize recent work on several physical mechanisms which could play arole in determining the form of the stellar initial mass function.

0810.1003	formation and evolution of planetary systems (feps): properties of  debris dust around solar-type stars	we present spitzer photometric (irac and mips) and spectroscopic (irs lowresolution) observations for 314 stars in the formation and evolution ofplanetary systems (feps) legacy program. these data are used to investigate theproperties and evolution of circumstellar dust around solar-type stars spanningages from approximately 3 myr to 3 gyr. we identify 46 sources that exhibitexcess infrared emission above the stellar photosphere at 24um, and 21 sourceswith excesses at 70um. five sources with an infrared excess havecharacteristics of optically thick primordial disks, while the remainingsources have properties akin to debris systems. the fraction of systemsexhibiting a 24um excess greater than 10.2% above the photosphere is 15% forages &lt; 300 myr and declines to 2.7% for older ages. the upper envelope to the70um fractional luminosity appears to decline over a similar age range. thecharacteristic temperature of the debris inferred from the irs spectra rangebetween 60 and 180 k, with evidence for the presence of cooler dust to accountfor the strength of the 70um excess emission. no strong correlation is foundbetween dust temperature and stellar age. comparison of the observational datawith disk models containing a power-law distribution of silicate grains suggestthat the typical inner disk radius is &gt; 10 au. although the interpretation isnot unique, the lack of excess emission shortwards of 16um and the relativelyflat distribution of the 24um excess for ages &lt;300~myr is consistent withsteady-state collisional models.
