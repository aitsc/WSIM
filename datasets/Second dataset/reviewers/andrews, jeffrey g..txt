0901.1936	a lower bound on the capacity of wireless erasure networks with random  node locations	in this paper, a lower bound on the capacity of wireless ad hoc erasurenetworks is derived in closed form in the canonical case where $n$ nodes areuniformly and independently distributed in the unit area square. the boundholds almost surely and is asymptotically tight. we assume all nodes have fixedtransmit power and hence two nodes should be within a specified distance $r_n$of each other to overcome noise. in this context, interference determinesoutages, so we model each transmitter-receiver pair as an erasure channel witha broadcast constraint, i.e. each node can transmit only one signal across allits outgoing links. a lower bound of $\theta(n r_n)$ for the capacity of thisclass of networks is derived. if the broadcast constraint is relaxed and eachnode can send distinct signals on distinct outgoing links, we show that thegain is a function of $r_n$ and the link erasure probabilities, and is at mosta constant if the link erasure probabilities grow sufficiently large with $n$.finally, the case where the erasure probabilities are themselves randomvariables, for example due to randomness in geometry or channels, is analyzed.we prove somewhat surprisingly that in this setting, variability in erasureprobabilities increases network capacity.

0902.3210	coverage in multi-antenna two-tier networks	in two-tier networks -- comprising a conventional cellular network overlaidwith shorter range hotspots (e.g. femtocells, distributed antennas, or wiredrelays) -- with universal frequency reuse, the near-far effect from cross-tierinterference creates dead spots where reliable coverage cannot be guaranteed tousers in either tier. equipping the macrocell and femtocells with multipleantennas enhances robustness against the near-far problem. this work derivesthe maximum number of simultaneously transmitting multiple antenna femtocellsmeeting a per-tier outage probability constraint. coverage dead zones arepresented wherein cross-tier interference bottlenecks cellular and hotspotcoverage. two operating regimes are shown namely 1) a cellular-limited regimein which femtocell users experience unacceptable cross-tier interference and 2)a hotspot-limited regime wherein both femtocell users and cellular users arelimited by hotspot interference. our analysis accounts for the per-tiertransmit powers, the number of transmit antennas (single antenna transmissionbeing a special case) and terrestrial propagation such as the rayleigh fadingand the path loss exponents. single-user (su) multiple antenna transmission ateach tier is shown to provide significantly superior coverage and spatial reuserelative to multiuser (mu) transmission. we propose a decentralizedcarrier-sensing approach to regulate femtocell transmission powers based ontheir location. considering a worst-case cell-edge location, simulations usingtypical path loss scenarios show that our interference management strategyprovides reliable cellular coverage with about 60 femtocells per cellsite.

0707.0476	fractional power control for decentralized wireless networks	we consider a new approach to power control in decentralized wirelessnetworks, termed fractional power control (fpc). transmission power is chosenas the current channel quality raised to an exponent -s, where s is a constantbetween 0 and 1. the choices s = 1 and s = 0 correspond to the familiar casesof channel inversion and constant power transmission, respectively. choosing sin (0,1) allows all intermediate policies between these two extremes to beevaluated, and we see that usually neither extreme is ideal. we deriveclosed-form approximations for the outage probability relative to a target sinrin a decentralized (ad hoc or unlicensed) network as well as for the resultingtransmission capacity, which is the number of users/m^2 that can achieve thissinr on average. using these approximations, which are quite accurate overtypical system parameter values, we prove that using an exponent of 1/2minimizes the outage probability, meaning that the inverse square root of thechannel strength is a sensible transmit power scaling for networks with arelatively low density of interferers. we also show numerically that thischoice of s is robust to a wide range of variations in the network parameters.intuitively, s=1/2 balances between helping disadvantaged users while makingsure they do not flood the network with interference.

0909.2894	adaptive spatial intercell interference cancellation in multicell  wireless networks	downlink spatial intercell interference cancellation (icic) is considered formitigating other-cell interference using multiple transmit antennas. aprinciple question we explore is whether it is better to do icic or simplystandard single-cell beamforming. we explore this question analytically andshow that beamforming is preferred for all users when the edge snr(signal-to-noise ratio) is low ($&lt;0$ db), and icic is preferred when the edgesnr is high ($&gt;10$ db), for example in an urban setting. at medium snr, aproposed adaptive strategy, where multiple base stations jointly selecttransmission strategies based on the user location, outperforms both whilerequiring a lower feedback rate than the pure icic approach. the employedmetric is sum rate, which is normally a dubious metric for cellular systems,but surprisingly we show that even with this reward function the adaptivestrategy also improves fairness. when the channel information is provided bylimited feedback, the impact of the induced quantization error is alsoinvestigated. it is shown that icic with well-designed feedback strategiesstill provides significant throughput gain.

0707.3584	the effect of fading, channel inversion, and threshold scheduling on ad  hoc networks	this paper addresses three issues in the field of ad hoc network capacity:the impact of i)channel fading, ii) channel inversion power control, and iii)threshold-based scheduling on capacity. channel inversion and thresholdscheduling may be viewed as simple ways to exploit channel state information(csi) without requiring cooperation across transmitters. we use thetransmission capacity (tc) as our metric, defined as the maximum spatialintensity of successful simultaneous transmissions subject to a constraint onthe outage probability (op). by assuming the nodes are located on the infiniteplane according to a poisson process, we are able to employ tools fromstochastic geometry to obtain asymptotically tight bounds on the distributionof the signal-to-interference (sir) level, yielding in turn tight bounds on theop (relative to a given sir threshold) and the tc. we demonstrate that in theabsence of csi, fading can significantly reduce the tc and somewhatsurprisingly, channel inversion only makes matters worse. we develop athreshold-based transmission rule where transmitters are active only if thechannel to their receiver is acceptably strong, obtain expressions for theoptimal threshold, and show that this simple, fully distributed scheme cansignificantly reduce the effect of fading.

1002.2655	multicast outage probability and transmission capacity of multihop  wireless networks	multicast transmission, wherein the same packet must be delivered to multiplereceivers, is an important aspect of sensor and tactical networks and hasseveral distinctive traits as opposed to more commonly studied unicastnetworks. specially, these include (i) identical packets must be deliveredsuccessfully to several nodes, (ii) outage at any receiver requires the packetto be retransmitted at least to that receiver, and (iii) the multicast rate isdominated by the receiver with the weakest link in order to minimize outage andretransmission. a first contribution of this paper is the development of atractable multicast model and throughput metric that captures each of these keytraits in a multicast wireless network. we utilize a poisson cluster process(pcp) consisting of a distinct poisson point process (ppp) for the transmittersand receivers, and then define the multicast transmission capacity (mtc) as themaximum achievable multicast rate per transmission attempt times the maximumintensity of multicast clusters under decoding delay and multicast outageconstraints. a multicast cluster is a contiguous area over which a packet ismulticasted, and to reduce outage it can be tessellated into $v$ smallerregions of multicast. the second contribution of the paper is the analysis ofseveral key aspects of this model, for which we develop the following mainresult. assuming $\tau/v$ transmission attempts are allowed for eachtessellated region in a multicast cluster, we show that the mtc is $\theta(\rhok^{x}\log(k)v^{y})$ where $\rho$, $x$ and $y$ are functions of $\tau$ and $v$depending on the network size and intensity, and $k$ is the average number ofthe intended receivers in a cluster. we derive $\{\rho, x, y\}$ for a number ofregimes of interest, and also show that an appropriate number ofretransmissions can significantly enhance the mtc.

1002.2964	open vs closed access femtocells in the uplink	femtocells are assuming an increasingly important role in the coverage andcapacity of cellular networks. in contrast to existing cellular systems,femtocells are end-user deployed and controlled, randomly located, and rely onthird party backhaul (e.g. dsl or cable modem). femtocells can be configured tobe either open access or closed access. open access allows an arbitrary nearbycellular user to use the femtocell, whereas closed access restricts the use ofthe femtocell to users explicitly approved by the owner. seemingly, the networkoperator would prefer an open access deployment since this provides aninexpensive way to expand their network capabilities, whereas the femtocellowner would prefer closed access, in order to keep the femtocell's capacity andbackhaul to himself. we show mathematically and through simulations that thereality is more complicated for both parties, and that the best approachdepends heavily on whether the multiple access scheme is orthogonal (tdma orofdma, per subband) or non-orthogonal (cdma). in a tdma/ofdma network,closed-access is typically preferable at high user densities, whereas in cdma,open access can provide gains of more than 200% for the home user by reducingthe near-far problem experienced by the femtocell. the results of this papersuggest that the interests of the femtocell owner and the network operator aremore compatible than typically believed, and that cdma femtocells should beconfigured for open access whereas ofdma or tdma femtocells should adapt to thecellular user density.

1004.3714	an upper bound on multi-hop transmission capacity with dynamic routing  selection	this paper develops upper bounds on the end-to-end transmission capacity ofmulti-hop wireless networks. potential source-destination paths are dynamicallyselected from a pool of randomly located relays, from which a closed-form lowerbound on the outage probability is derived in terms of the expected number ofpotential paths. this is in turn used to provide an upper bound on the numberof successful transmissions that can occur per unit area, which is known as thetransmission capacity. the upper bound results from assuming independence amongthe potential paths, and can be viewed as the maximum diversity case. a usefulaspect of the upper bound is its simple form for an arbitrary-sized network,which allows insights into how the number of hops and other network parametersaffect spatial throughput in the non-asymptotic regime. the outage probabilityanalysis is then extended to account for retransmissions with a maximum numberof allowed attempts. in contrast to prevailing wisdom, we show thatpredetermined routing (such as nearest-neighbor) is suboptimal, since more hopsare not useful once the network is interference-limited. our results also makeclear that randomness in the location of relay sets and dynamically varyingchannel states is helpful in obtaining higher aggregate throughput, and thatdynamic route selection should be used to exploit path diversity.

1006.0542	multicast capacity scaling of wireless networks with multicast outage	multicast transmission has several distinctive traits as opposed to morecommonly studied unicast networks. specially, these include (i) identicalpackets must be delivered successfully to several nodes, (ii) outage couldsimultaneously happen at different receivers, and (iii) the multicast rate isdominated by the receiver with the weakest link in order to minimize outage andretransmission. to capture these key traits, we utilize a poisson clusterprocess consisting of a distinct poisson point process (ppp) for thetransmitters and receivers, and then define the multicast transmission capacity(mtc) as the maximum achievable multicast rate times the number of multicastclusters per unit volume, accounting for outages and retransmissions. our mainresult shows that if $\tau$ transmission attempts are allowed in a multicastcluster, the mtc is $\theta\left(\rho k^{x}\log(k)\right)$ where $\rho$ and $x$are functions of $\tau$ depending on the network size and density, and $k$ isthe average number of the intended receivers in a cluster. we also show that anappropriate number of retransmissions can significantly enhance the mtc.

1009.0516	a tractable approach to coverage and rate in cellular networks	cellular networks are usually modeled by placing the base stations on a grid,with mobile users either randomly scattered or placed deterministically. thesemodels have been used extensively but suffer from being both highly idealizedand not very tractable, so complex system-level simulations are used toevaluate coverage/outage probability and rate. more tractable models have longbeen desirable. we develop new general models for the multi-cellsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (sinr) using stochastic geometry. undervery general assumptions, the resulting expressions for the downlink sinr ccdf(equivalent to the coverage probability) involve quickly computable integrals,and in some practical special cases can be simplified to common integrals(e.g., the q-function) or even to simple closed-form expressions. we alsoderive the mean rate, and then the coverage gain (and mean rate loss) fromstatic frequency reuse. we compare our coverage predictions to the grid modeland an actual base station deployment, and observe that the proposed model ispessimistic (a lower bound on coverage) whereas the grid model is optimistic,and that both are about equally accurate. in addition to being more tractable,the proposed model may better capture the increasingly opportunistic and denseplacement of base stations in future networks.

1009.3522	open, closed, and shared access femtocells in the downlink	a fundamental choice in femtocell deployments is the set of users which areallowed to access each femtocell. closed access restricts the set tospecifically registered users, while open access allows any mobile subscriberto use any femtocell. which one is preferable depends strongly on the distancebetween the macrocell base station (mbs) and femtocell. the main results of thepaper are lemmas which provide expressions for the sinr distribution forvarious zones within a cell as a function of this mbs-femto distance. theaverage sum throughput (or any other sinr-based metric) of home users andcellular users under open and closed access can be readily determined fromthese expressions. we show that unlike in the uplink, the interests of home andcellular users are in conflict, with home users preferring closed access andcellular users preferring open access. the conflict is most pronounced forfemtocells near the cell edge, when there are many cellular users and fewerfemtocells. to mitigate this conflict, we propose a middle way which we termshared access in which femtocells allocate an adjustable number of time-slotsbetween home and cellular users such that a specified minimum rate for each canbe achieved. the optimal such sharing fraction is derived. analysis shows thatshared access achieves at least the overall throughput of open access whilealso satisfying rate requirements, while closed access fails for cellular usersand open access fails for the home user.

1010.1584	high-sir transmission capacity of wireless networks with general fading  and node distribution	in many wireless systems, interference is the main performance-limitingfactor, and is primarily dictated by the locations of concurrent transmitters.in many earlier works, the locations of the transmitters is often modeled as apoisson point process for analytical tractability. while analyticallyconvenient, the ppp only accurately models networks whose nodes are placedindependently and use aloha as the channel access protocol, which preserves theindependence. correlations between transmitter locations in non-poissonnetworks, which model intelligent access protocols, makes the outage analysisextremely difficult. in this paper, we take an alternative approach and focuson an asymptotic regime where the density of interferers $\eta$ goes to 0. weprove for general node distributions and fading statistics that the successprobability $\p \sim 1-\gamma \eta^{\kappa}$ for $\eta \rightarrow 0$, andprovide values of $\gamma$ and $\kappa$ for a number of important specialcases. we show that $\kappa$ is lower bounded by 1 and upper bounded by a valuethat depends on the path loss exponent and the fading. this new analyticalframework is then used to characterize the transmission capacity of a verygeneral class of networks, defined as the maximum spatial density of activelinks given an outage constraint.

1012.4552	on the throughput cost of physical layer security in decentralized  wireless networks	this paper studies the throughput of large-scale decentralized wirelessnetworks with physical layer security constraints. in particular, we areinterested in the question of how much throughput needs to be sacrificed forachieving a certain level of security. we consider random networks where thelegitimate nodes and the eavesdroppers are distributed according to independenttwo-dimensional poisson point processes. the transmission capacity framework isused to characterize the area spectral efficiency of secure transmissions withconstraints on both the quality of service (qos) and the level of security.this framework illustrates the dependence of the network throughput on keysystem parameters, such as the densities of legitimate nodes and eavesdroppers,as well as the qos and security constraints. one important finding is that thethroughput cost of achieving a moderate level of security is quite low, whilethroughput must be significantly sacrificed to realize a highly secure network.we also study the use of a secrecy guard zone, which is shown to give asignificant improvement on the throughput of networks with high securityrequirements.

1101.3824	series expansion for interference in wireless networks	the spatial correlations in transmitter node locations introduced by commonmultiple access protocols makes the analysis of interference, outage, and otherrelated metrics in a wireless network extremely difficult. most works thereforeassume that nodes are distributed either as a poisson point process (ppp) or agrid, and utilize the independence properties of the ppp (or the regularstructure of the grid) to analyze interference, outage and other metrics.but,the independence of node locations makes the ppp a dubious model fornontrivial macs which intentionally introduce correlations, e.g. spatialseparation, while the grid is too idealized to model real networks. in thispaper, we introduce a new technique based on the factorial moment expansion offunctionals of point processes to analyze functions of interference, inparticular outage probability. we provide a taylor-series type expansion offunctions of interference, wherein increasing the number of terms in the seriesprovides a better approximation at the cost of increased complexity ofcomputation. various examples illustrate how this new approach can be used tofind outage probability in both poisson and non-poisson wireless networks.

1101.5130	analytical evaluation of fractional frequency reuse for ofdma cellular  networks	fractional frequency reuse (ffr) is an interference management techniquewell-suited to ofdma-based cellular networks wherein the cells are partitionedinto spatial regions with different frequency reuse factors. to date, ffrtechniques have been typically been evaluated through system-level simulationsusing a hexagonal grid for the base station locations. this paper insteadfocuses on analytically evaluating the two main types of ffr deployments -strict ffr and soft frequency reuse (sfr) - using a poisson point process tomodel the base station locations. the results are compared with the standardgrid model and an actual urban deployment. under reasonable special cases formodern cellular networks, our results reduce to simple closed-form expressions,which provide insight into system design guidelines and the relative merits ofstrict ffr, sfr, universal reuse, and fixed frequency reuse. we observe thatffr provides an increase in the sum-rate as well as the well-known benefit ofimproved coverage for cell-edge users. finally, a sinr-proportional resourceallocation strategy is proposed based on the analytical expressions, showingthat strict ffr provides greater overall network throughput at low trafficloads, while sfr better balances the requirements of interference reduction andresource efficiency when the traffic load is high.

1103.0561	downlink sdma with limited feedback in interference-limited wireless  networks	the tremendous capacity gains promised by space division multiple access(sdma) depend critically on the accuracy of the transmit channel stateinformation. in the broadcast channel, even without any network interference,it is known that such gains collapse due to interstream interference if thefeedback is delayed or low rate. in this paper, we investigate sdma in thepresence of interference from many other simultaneously active transmittersdistributed randomly over the network. in particular we consider zero-forcingbeamforming in a decentralized (ad hoc) network where each receiver providesfeedback to its respective transmitter. we derive closed-form expressions forthe outage probability, network throughput, transmission capacity, and averageachievable rate and go on to quantify the degradation in network performancedue to residual self-interference as a function of key system parameters. oneparticular finding is that as in the classical broadcast channel, the per-userfeedback rate must increase linearly with the number of transmit antennas andsinr (in db) for the full multiplexing gains to be preserved with limitedfeedback. we derive the throughput-maximizing number of streams, establishingthat single-stream transmission is optimal in most practically relevantsettings. in short, sdma does not appear to be a prudent design choice forinterference-limited wireless networks.

1103.2177	modeling and analysis of k-tier downlink heterogeneous cellular networks	cellular networks are in a major transition from a carefully planned set oflarge tower-mounted base-stations (bss) to an irregular deployment ofheterogeneous infrastructure elements that often additionally includes micro,pico, and femtocells, as well as distributed antennas. in this paper, wedevelop a tractable, flexible, and accurate model for a downlink heterogeneouscellular network (hcn) consisting of k tiers of randomly located bss, whereeach tier may differ in terms of average transmit power, supported data rateand bs density. assuming a mobile user connects to the strongest candidate bs,the resulting signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (sinr) is greater than 1when in coverage, rayleigh fading, we derive an expression for the probabilityof coverage (equivalently outage) over the entire network under both open andclosed access, which assumes a strikingly simple closed-form in the high sinrregime and is accurate down to -4 db even under weaker assumptions. forexternal validation, we compare against an actual lte network (for tier 1) withthe other k-1 tiers being modeled as independent poisson point processes. inthis case as well, our model is accurate to within 1-2 db. we also derive theaverage rate achieved by a randomly located mobile and the average load on eachtier of bss. one interesting observation for interference-limited open accessnetworks is that at a given sinr, adding more tiers and/or bss neitherincreases nor decreases the probability of coverage or outage when all thetiers have the same target-sinr.

1103.4223	a stochastic-geometry approach to coverage in cellular networks with  multi-cell cooperation	multi-cell cooperation is a promising approach for mitigating inter-cellinterference in dense cellular networks. quantifying the performance ofmulti-cell cooperation is challenging as it integrates physical-layertechniques and network topologies. for tractability, existing work typicallyrelies on the over-simplified wyner-type models. in this paper, we propose anew stochastic-geometry model for a cellular network with multi-cellcooperation, which accounts for practical factors including the irregularlocations of base stations (bss) and the resultant path-losses. in particular,the proposed network-topology model has three key features: i) the cells aremodeled using a poisson random tessellation generated by poisson distributedbss, ii) multi-antenna bss are clustered using a hexagonal lattice and bss inthe same cluster mitigate mutual interference by spatial interferenceavoidance, iii) bss near cluster edges access a different sub-channel from thatby other bss, shielding cluster-edge mobiles from strong interference. usingthis model and assuming sparse scattering, we analyze the shapes of the outageprobabilities of mobiles served by cluster-interior bss as the average number$k$ of bss per cluster increases. the outage probability of a mobile near acluster center is shown to be proportional to $e^{-c(2-\sqrt{\nu})^2k}$ where$\nu$ is the fraction of bss lying in the interior of clusters and $c$ is aconstant. moreover, the outage probability of a typical mobile is proved toscale proportionally with $e^{-c' (1-\sqrt{\nu})^2k}$ where $c'$ is a constant.

1105.3686	broadcast channels with delayed finite-rate feedback: predict or  observe?	most multiuser precoding techniques require accurate transmitter channelstate information (csit) to maintain orthogonality between the users. suchtechniques have proven quite fragile in time-varying channels because the csitis inherently imperfect due to estimation and feedback delay, as wellquantization noise. an alternative approach recently proposed by maddah-ali andtse (mat) allows for significant multiplexing gain in the multi-inputsingle-output (miso) broadcast channel (bc) even with transmit csit that iscompletely stale, i.e. uncorrelated with the current channel state. with $k$users, their scheme claims to lose only a $\log(k)$ factor relative to the full$k$ degrees of freedom (dof) attainable in the miso bc with perfect csit forlarge $k$. however, their result does not consider the cost of the feedback,which is potentially very large in high mobility (short channel coherencetime). in this paper, we more closely examine the mat scheme and compare itsdof gain to single user transmission (which always achieves 1 dof) and partialcsit linear precoding (which achieves up to $k$). in particular, assuming thechannel coherence time is $n$ symbol periods and the feedback delay is $n_{\rmfd}$ we show that when $n &lt; (1+o(1)) k \log k$ (short coherence time), singleuser transmission performs best, whereas for $n&gt; (1+o(1)) (n_{\rm fd}+ k / \logk)(1-\log^{-1}k)^{-1}$ (long coherence time), zero-forcing precodingoutperforms the other two. the mat scheme is optimal for intermediate coherencetimes, which for practical parameter choices is indeed quite a large andsignificant range, even accounting for the feedback cost.

1106.5825	fundamentals of inter-cell overhead signaling in heterogeneous cellular  networks	heterogeneous base stations (e.g. picocells, microcells, femtocells anddistributed antennas) will become increasingly essential for cellular networkcapacity and coverage. up until now, little basic research has been done on thefundamentals of managing so much infrastructure -- much of it unplanned --together with the carefully planned macro-cellular network. inter-cellcoordination is in principle an effective way of ensuring differentinfrastructure components behave in a way that increases, rather thandecreases, the key quality of service (qos) metrics. the success of suchcoordination depends heavily on how the overhead is shared, and the rate anddelay of the overhead sharing. we develop a novel framework to quantifyoverhead signaling for inter-cell coordination, which is usually ignored intraditional 1-tier networks, and assumes even more importance in multi-tierheterogeneous cellular networks (hcns). we derive the overhead quality contourfor general k-tier hcns -- the achievable set of overhead packet rate, size,delay and outage probability -- in closed-form expressions or computableintegrals under general assumptions on overhead arrivals and different overheadsignaling methods (backhaul and/or wireless). the overhead quality contour isfurther simplified for two widely used models of overhead arrivals: poisson anddeterministic arrival process. this framework can be used in the design andevaluation of any inter-cell coordination scheme. it also provides designinsights on backhaul and wireless overhead channels to handle specific overheadsignaling requirements.

1112.0674	analytical evaluation of fractional frequency reuse for heterogeneous  cellular networks	interference management techniques are critical to the performance ofheterogeneous cellular networks, which will have dense and overlapping coverageareas, and experience high levels of interference. fractional frequency reuse(ffr) is an attractive interference management technique due to its lowcomplexity and overhead, and significant coverage improvement forlow-percentile (cell-edge) users. instead of relying on system simulationsbased on deterministic access point locations, this paper instead proposes ananalytical model for evaluating strict ffr and soft frequency reuse (sfr)deployments based on the spatial poisson point process. our results bothcapture the non-uniformity of heterogeneous deployments and produce tractableexpressions which can be used for system design with strict ffr and sfr. weobserve that the use of strict ffr bands reserved for the users of each tierwith the lowest average sinr provides the highest gains in terms of coverageand rate, while the use of sfr allows for more efficient use of shared spectrumbetween the tiers, while still mitigating much of the interference.additionally, in the context of multi-tier networks with closed access in sometiers, the proposed framework shows the impact of cross-tier interference onclosed access ffr, and informs the selection of key ffr parameters in openaccess.

0711.0277	bandwidth partitioning in decentralized wireless networks	this paper addresses the following question, which is of interest in thedesign of a multiuser decentralized network. given a total system bandwidth ofw hz and a fixed data rate constraint of r bps for each transmission, how manyfrequency slots n of size w/n should the band be partitioned into in order tomaximize the number of simultaneous links in the network? dividing theavailable spectrum results in two competing effects. on the positive side, alarger n allows for more parallel, noninterfering communications to take placein the same area. on the negative side, a larger n increases the sinrrequirement for each link because the same information rate must be achievedover less bandwidth. exploring this tradeoff and determining the optimum valueof n in terms of the system parameters is the focus of the paper. usingstochastic geometry, the optimal sinr threshold - which directly corresponds tothe optimal spectral efficiency - is derived for both the low snr(power-limited) and high snr (interference-limited) regimes. this leads to theoptimum choice of the number of frequency bands n in terms of the path lossexponent, power and noise spectral density, desired rate, and total bandwidth.

1204.0011	fundamental limits of cooperation	cooperation is viewed as a key ingredient for interference management inwireless systems. this paper shows that cooperation has fundamentallimitations. the main result is that even full cooperation between transmitterscannot in general change an interference-limited network to a noise-limitednetwork. the key idea is that there exists a spectral efficiency upper boundthat is independent of the transmit power. first, a spectral efficiency upperbound is established for systems that rely on pilot-assisted channelestimation; in this framework, cooperation is shown to be possible only withinclusters of limited size, which are subject to out-of-cluster interferencewhose power scales with that of the in-cluster signals. second, an upper boundis also shown to exist when cooperation is through noncoherent communication;thus, the spectral efficiency limitation is not a by-product of the reliance onpilot-assisted channel estimation. consequently, existing literature thatroutinely assumes the high-power spectral efficiency scales with the log of thetransmit power provides only a partial characterization. the completecharacterization proposed in this paper subdivides the high-power regime into adegrees-of-freedom regime, where the scaling with the log of the transmit powerholds approximately, and a saturation regime, where the spectral efficiencyhits a ceiling that is independent of the power. using a cellular system as anexample, it is demonstrated that the spectral efficiency saturates at powerlevels of operational relevance.

1204.1091	load-aware modeling and analysis of heterogeneous cellular networks	random spatial models are attractive for modeling heterogeneous cellularnetworks (hcns) due to their realism, tractability, and scalability. a majorlimitation of such models to date in the context of hcns is the neglect ofnetwork traffic and load: all base stations (bss) have typically been assumedto always be transmitting. small cells in particular will have a lighter loadthan macrocells, and so their contribution to the network interference may besignificantly overstated in a fully loaded model. this paper incorporates aflexible notion of bs load by introducing a new idea of conditionally thinningthe interference field. for a k-tier hcn where bss across tiers differ in termsof transmit power, supported data rate, deployment density, and now load, wederive the coverage probability for a typical mobile, which connects to thestrongest bs signal. conditioned on this connection, the interfering bss of the$i^{th}$ tier are assumed to transmit independently with probability $p_i$,which models the load. assuming - reasonably - that smaller cells are morelightly loaded than macrocells, the analysis shows that adding such accesspoints to the network always increases the coverage probability. we alsoobserve that fully loaded models are quite pessimistic in terms of coverage.

1204.3114	on the role of mobility for multi-message gossip	we consider information dissemination in a large $n$-user wireless network inwhich $k$ users wish to share a unique message with all other users. each ofthe $n$ users only has knowledge of its own contents and state information;this corresponds to a one-sided push-only scenario. the goal is to disseminateall messages efficiently, hopefully achieving an order-optimal spreading rateover unicast wireless random networks. first, we show that a random-pushstrategy -- where a user sends its own or a received packet at random -- isorder-wise suboptimal in a random geometric graph: specifically,$\omega(\sqrt{n})$ times slower than optimal spreading. it is known that thisgap can be closed if each user has "full" mobility, since this effectivelycreates a complete graph. we instead consider velocity-constrained mobilitywhere at each time slot the user moves locally using a discrete random walkwith velocity $v(n)$ that is much lower than full mobility. we propose a simpletwo-stage dissemination strategy that alternates between individual messageflooding ("self promotion") and random gossiping. we prove that this schemeachieves a close to optimal spreading rate (within only a logarithmic gap) aslong as the velocity is at least $v(n)=\omega(\sqrt{\log n/k})$. the keyinsight is that the mixing property introduced by the partial mobility helpsusers to spread in space within a relatively short period compared to theoptimal spreading time, which macroscopically mimics message dissemination overa complete graph.

1204.3167	an analytical framework for multi-cell cooperation via stochastic  geometry and large deviations	multi-cell cooperation (mcc) is an approach for mitigating inter-cellinterference in dense cellular networks. existing studies on mcc performancetypically rely on either over-simplified wyner-type models or complexsystem-level simulations. the promising theoretical results (typically usingwyner models) seem to materialize neither in complex simulations nor inpractice. to more accurately investigate the theoretical performance of mcc,this paper models an entire plane of interfering cells as a poisson randomtessellation. the base stations (bss) are then clustered using a regularlattice, whereby bss in the same cluster mitigate mutual interference bybeamforming with perfect channel state information. techniques from stochasticgeometry and large deviation theory are applied to analyze the outageprobability as a function of the mobile locations, scattering environment, andthe average number of cooperating bss per cluster, l. for mobiles near thecenters of bs clusters, it is shown that as l increases, outage probabilitydiminishes sub-exponentially if scattering is sparse, and following a power lawwith an exponent proportional to the signal diversity order if scattering isrich. for randomly located mobiles, regardless of scattering, outageprobability is shown to scale with increasing l following a power law with anexponent no larger than 0.5. these results confirm analytically thatcluster-edge mobiles are the bottleneck for network coverage and provide aplausible analytic framework for more realistic analysis of other multi-celltechniques.

1204.3447	towards understanding the fundamentals of mobility in cellular networks	despite the central role of mobility in wireless networks, analytical studyon its impact on network performance is notoriously difficult. this paper aimsto address this gap by proposing a random waypoint (rwp) mobility model definedon the entire plane and applying it to analyze two key cellular networkparameters: handover rate and sojourn time. we first analyze the stochasticproperties of the proposed model and compare it to two other models: theclassical rwp mobility model and a synthetic truncated levy walk model which isconstructed from real mobility trajectories. the comparison shows that theproposed rwp mobility model is more appropriate for the mobility simulation inemerging cellular networks, which have ever-smaller cells. then we apply theproposed model to cellular networks under both deterministic (hexagonal) andrandom (poisson) base station (bs) models. we present analytic expressions forboth handover rate and sojourn time, which have the expected property that thehandover rate is proportional to the square root of bs density. compared to anactual bs distribution, we find that the poisson-voronoi model is about asaccurate in terms of mobility evaluation as hexagonal model, though being morepessimistic in that it predicts a higher handover rate and lower sojourn time.

1205.2833	user association for load balancing in heterogeneous cellular networks	for small cell technology to significantly increase the capacity oftower-based cellular networks, mobile users will need to be actively pushedonto the more lightly loaded tiers (corresponding to, e.g., pico andfemtocells), even if they offer a lower instantaneous sinr than the macrocellbase station (bs). optimizing a function of the long-term rates for each userrequires (in general) a massive utility maximization problem over all the sinrsand bs loads. on the other hand, an actual implementation will likely resort toa simple biasing approach where a bs in tier j is treated as having its sinrmultiplied by a factor a_j&gt;=1, which makes it appear more attractive than theheavily-loaded macrocell. this paper bridges the gap between these approachesthrough several physical relaxations of the network-wide optimal associationproblem, whose solution is np hard. we provide a low-complexity distributedalgorithm that converges to a near-optimal solution with a theoreticalperformance guarantee, and we observe that simple per-tier biasing losessurprisingly little, if the bias values a_j are chosen carefully. numericalresults show a large (3.5x) throughput gain for cell-edge users and a 2x rategain for median users relative to a max received power association.

1208.1977	offloading in heterogeneous networks: modeling, analysis, and design  insights	pushing data traffic from cellular to wifi is an example of inter radioaccess technology (rat) offloading. while this clearly alleviates congestion onthe over-loaded cellular network, the ultimate potential of such offloading andits effect on overall system performance is not well understood. to addressthis, we develop a general and tractable model that consists of $m$ differentrats, each deploying up to $k$ different tiers of access points (aps), whereeach tier differs in transmit power, path loss exponent, deployment density andbandwidth. each class of aps is modeled as an independent poisson point process(ppp), with mobile user locations modeled as another independent ppp, allchannels further consisting of i.i.d. rayleigh fading. the distribution of rateover the entire network is then derived for a weighted association strategy,where such weights can be tuned to optimize a particular objective. we showthat the optimum fraction of traffic offloaded to maximize $\sinr$ coverage isnot in general the same as the one that maximizes rate coverage, defined as thefraction of users achieving a given rate.

1210.5503	downlink coordinated multi-point with overhead modeling in heterogeneous  cellular networks	coordinated multi-point (comp) communication is attractive for heterogeneouscellular networks (hcns) for interference reduction. however, previousapproaches to comp face two major hurdles in hcns. first, they usually ignorethe inter-cell overhead messaging delay, although it results in an irreducibleperformance bound. second, they consider the grid or wyner model for basestation locations, which is not appropriate for hcn bs locations which arenumerous and haphazard. even for conventional macrocell networks withoutoverlaid small cells, sinr results are not tractable in the grid model noraccurate in the wyner model. to overcome these hurdles, we develop a novelanalytical framework which includes the impact of overhead delay for compevaluation in hcns. this framework can be used for a class of comp schemeswithout user data sharing. as an example, we apply it to downlink compzero-forcing beamforming (zfbf), and see significant divergence from previouswork. for example, we show that comp zfbf does not increase throughput when theoverhead channel delay is larger than 60% of the channel coherence time. wealso find that, in most cases, coordinating with only one other cell is nearlyoptimum for downlink comp zfbf.

1211.4041	modeling, analysis and design for carrier aggregation in heterogeneous  cellular networks	carrier aggregation (ca) and small cells are two distinct features ofnext-generation cellular networks. cellular networks with small cells take on avery heterogeneous characteristic, and are often referred to as hetnets. inthis paper, we introduce a load-aware model for ca-enabled \textit{multi}-bandhetnets. under this model, the impact of biasing can be more appropriatelycharacterized; for example, it is observed that with large enough biasing, thespectral efficiency of small cells may increase while its counterpart in afully-loaded model always decreases. further, our analysis reveals that thepeak data rate does not depend on the base station density and transmit powers;this strongly motivates other approaches e.g. ca to increase the peak datarate. last but not least, different band deployment configurations are studiedand compared. we find that with large enough small cell density, spatial reusewith small cells outperforms adding more spectrum for increasing user rate.more generally, universal cochannel deployment typically yields the largestrate; and thus a capacity loss exists in orthogonal deployment. thisperformance gap can be reduced by appropriately tuning the hetnet coveragedistribution (e.g. by optimizing biasing factors).

1301.5034	downlink mimo hetnets: modeling, ordering results and performance  analysis	we develop a general downlink model for multi-antenna heterogeneous cellularnetworks (hetnets), where base stations (bss) across tiers may differ in termsof transmit power, target signal-to-interference-ratio (sir), deploymentdensity, number of transmit antennas and the type of multi-antennatransmission. in particular, we consider and compare space division multipleaccess (sdma), single user beamforming (su-bf), and baseline single-inputsingle-output (siso) transmission. for this general model, the maincontributions are: (i) ordering results for both coverage probability and peruser rate in closed form for any bs distribution for the three consideredtechniques, using novel tools from stochastic orders, (ii) upper bounds on thecoverage probability assuming a poisson bs distribution, and (iii) a comparisonof the area spectral efficiency (ase). the analysis concretely demonstrates,for example, that for a given total number of transmit antennas in the network,it is preferable to spread them across many single-antenna bss vs. fewermulti-antenna bss. another observation is that su-bf provides higher coverageand per user data rate than sdma, but sdma is in some cases better in terms ofase.

1303.7039	joint resource partitioning and offloading in heterogeneous cellular  networks	in heterogeneous cellular networks (hcns), it is desirable to offload mobileusers to small cells, which are typically significantly less congested than themacrocells. to achieve sufficient load balancing, the offloaded users oftenhave much lower sinr than they would on the macrocell. this sinr degradationcan be partially alleviated through interference avoidance, for example time orfrequency resource partitioning, whereby the macrocell turns off in somefraction of such resources. naturally, the optimal offloading strategy istightly coupled with resource partitioning; the optimal amount of which in turndepends on how many users have been offloaded. in this paper, we propose ageneral and tractable framework for modeling and analyzing joint resourcepartitioning and offloading in a two-tier cellular network. with it, we areable to derive the downlink rate distribution over the entire network, and anoptimal strategy for joint resource partitioning and offloading. we show thatload balancing, by itself, is insufficient, and resource partitioning isrequired in conjunction with offloading to improve the rate of cell edge usersin co-channel heterogeneous networks.

1305.4219	spectrum sharing for device-to-device communication in cellular networks	this paper addresses two fundamental and interrelated issues indevice-to-device (d2d) enhanced cellular networks. the first issue is how d2dusers should access spectrum, and we consider two choices: overlay (orthogonalspectrum between d2d and cellular ues) and underlay (non-orthogonal). thesecond issue is how d2d users should choose between communicating directly orvia the base station, a choice that depends on distance between the potentiald2d transmitter and receiver. we propose a tractable hybrid network model wherethe positions of mobiles are modeled by random spatial poisson point process,with which we present a general analytical approach that allows a unifiedperformance evaluation for these questions. then, we derive analytical rateexpressions and apply them to optimize the two d2d spectrum sharing scenariosunder a weighted proportional fair utility function. we find that as theproportion of potential d2d mobiles increases, the optimal spectrum partitionin the overlay is almost invariant (when d2d mode selection threshold is large)while the optimal spectrum access factor in the underlay decreases. further,from a coverage perspective, we reveal a tradeoff between the spectrum accessfactor and the d2d mode selection threshold in the underlay: as more d2d linksare allowed (due to a more relaxed mode selection threshold), the networkshould actually make less spectrum available to them to limit theirinterference.

1305.5585	on/off macrocells and load balancing in heterogeneous cellular networks	the rate distribution in heterogeneous networks (hetnets) greatly benefitsfrom load balancing, by which mobile users are pushed onto lightly-loaded smallcells despite the resulting loss in sinr. this offloading can be made moreaggressive and robust if the macrocells leave a fraction of time/frequencyresource blank, which reduces the interference to the offloaded users. weinvestigate the joint optimization of this technique - referred to in 3gpp asenhanced intercell interference coordination (eicic) via almost blank subframes(abss) - with offloading in this paper. although the joint cell association andblank resource (br) problem is nominally combinatorial, by allowing users toassociate with multiple base stations (bss), the problem becomes convex, andupper bounds the performance versus a binary association. we show boththeoretically and through simulation that the optimal solution of the relaxedproblem still results in an association that is mostly binary. the optimalassociation differs significantly when the macrocell is on or off; inparticular the offloading can be much more aggressive when the resource is leftblank by macro bss. further, we observe that jointly optimizing the offloadingwith br is important. the rate gain for cell edge users (the worst 3-10%) isvery large - on the order of 5-10x - versus a naive association strategywithout macrocell blanking.

1307.1524	fundamentals of heterogeneous cellular networks with energy harvesting	we develop a new tractable model for k-tier heterogeneous cellular networks(hetnets), where each base station (bs) is powered solely by a self-containedenergy harvesting module. the bss across tiers differ in terms of the energyharvesting rate, energy storage capacity, transmit power and deploymentdensity. since a bs may not always have enough energy, it may need to be keptoff and allowed to recharge while nearby users are served by neighboring bssthat are on. we show that the fraction of time a k^{th} tier bs can be kept on,termed availability \rho_k, is a fundamental metric of interest. using toolsfrom random walk theory, fixed point analysis and stochastic geometry, wecharacterize the set of k-tuples (\rho_1, \rho_2, ... \rho_k), termed theavailability region, that is achievable by general uncoordinated operationalstrategies, where the decision to toggle the current on/off state of a bs istaken independently of the other bss. if the availability vector correspondingto the optimal system performance, e.g., in terms of rate, lies in thisavailability region, there is no performance loss due to the presence ofunreliable energy sources. as a part of our analysis, we model the temporaldynamics of the energy level at each bs as a birth-death process, derive theenergy utilization rate, and use hitting/stopping time analysis to prove thatthere exists a fundamental limit on \rho_k that cannot be surpassed by anyuncoordinated strategy.

1307.6373	effect of spatial interference correlation on the performance of maximum  ratio combining	while the performance of maximum ratio combining (mrc) is well understood fora single isolated link, the same is not true in the presence of interference,which is typically correlated across antennas due to the common locations ofinterferers. for tractability, prior work focuses on the two extreme caseswhere the interference power across antennas is either assumed to be fullycorrelated or fully uncorrelated. in this paper, we address this shortcomingand characterize the performance of mrc in the presence of spatially-correlatedinterference across antennas. modeling the interference field as a poissonpoint process, we derive the exact distribution of the signal-to-interferenceratio (sir) for the case of two receive antennas, and upper and lower boundsfor the general case. using these results, we study the diversity behavior ofmrc and characterize the critical density of simultaneous transmissions for agiven outage constraint. the exact sir distribution is also useful inbenchmarking simpler correlation models. we show that the full-correlationassumption is considerably pessimistic (up to 30% higher outage probability fortypical values) and the no-correlation assumption is significantly optimisticcompared to the true performance.

1308.0041	a tractable model for non-coherent joint-transmission base station  cooperation	this paper presents a tractable model for analyzing non-coherent jointtransmission base station (bs) cooperation, taking into account the irregularbs deployment typically encountered in practice. besides cellular-networkspecific aspects such as bs density, channel fading, average path loss andinterference, the model also captures relevant cooperation mechanisms includinguser-centric bs clustering and channel-dependent cooperation activation. thelocations of all bss are modeled by a poisson point process. using tools fromstochastic geometry, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio($\mathtt{sinr}$) distribution with cooperation is precisely characterized in agenerality-preserving form. the result is then applied to practical designproblems of recent interest. we find that increasing the network-wide bsdensity improves the $\mathtt{sinr}$, while the gains increase with the pathloss exponent. for pilot-based channel estimation, the average spectralefficiency saturates at cluster sizes of around $7$ bss for typical values,irrespective of backhaul quality. finally, it is shown that intra-clusterfrequency reuse is favorable in moderately loaded cells with generouscooperation activation, while intra-cluster coordinated scheduling may bebetter in lightly loaded cells with conservative cooperation activation.

1407.5537	tractable model for rate in self-backhauled millimeter wave cellular  networks	millimeter wave (mmw) cellular systems will require high gain directionalantennas and dense base station (bs) deployments to overcome high near fieldpath loss and poor diffraction. as a desirable side effect, high gain antennasprovide interference isolation, providing an opportunity to incorporateself-backhauling--bss backhauling among themselves in a mesh architecturewithout significant loss in throughput--to enable the requisite large bsdensities. the use of directional antennas and resource sharing between accessand backhaul links leads to coverage and rate trends that differ significantlyfrom conventional microwave ($\mu$w) cellular systems. in this paper, wepropose a general and tractable mmw cellular model capturing these key trendsand characterize the associated rate distribution. the developed model andanalysis is validated using actual building locations from dense urban settingsand empirically-derived path loss models. the analysis shows that in sharpcontrast to the interference limited nature of $\mu$w cellular networks, thespectral efficiency of mmw networks (besides total rate) also increases with bsdensity particularly at the cell edge. increasing the system bandwidth,although boosting median and peak rates, does not significantly influence thecell edge rate. with self-backhauling, different combinations of the wiredbackhaul fraction (i.e. the faction of bss with a wired connection) and bsdensity are shown to guarantee the same median rate (qos).

1408.0549	downlink cellular network analysis with multi-slope path loss models	existing cellular network analyses, and even simulations, typically use thestandard path loss model where received power decays like $\|x\|^{-\alpha}$over a distance $\|x\|$. this standard path loss model is quite idealized, andin most scenarios the path loss exponent $\alpha$ is itself a function of$\|x\|$, typically an increasing one. enforcing a single path loss exponent canlead to orders of magnitude differences in average received and interferencepowers versus the true values. in this paper we study \emph{multi-slope} pathloss models, where different distance ranges are subject to different path lossexponents. we focus on the dual-slope path loss function, which is a piece-wisepower law and continuous and accurately approximates many practical scenarios.we derive the distributions of sir, snr, and finally sinr before finding thepotential throughput scaling, which provides insight on the observedcell-splitting rate gain. the exact mathematical results show that the sirmonotonically decreases with network density, while the converse is true forsnr, and thus the network coverage probability in terms of sinr is maximized atsome finite density. with ultra-densification (network density goes toinfinity), there exists a \emph{phase transition} in the near-field path lossexponent $\alpha_0$: if $\alpha_0 &gt;1$ unbounded potential throughput can beachieved asymptotically; if $\alpha_0 &lt;1$, ultra-densification leads in theextreme case to zero throughput.

0804.0813	spatial interference cancelation for mobile ad hoc networks: perfect csi	interference between nodes directly limits the capacity of mobile ad hocnetworks. this paper focuses on spatial interference cancelation with perfectchannel state information (csi), and analyzes the corresponding networkcapacity. specifically, by using multiple antennas, zero-forcing beamforming isapplied at each receiver for canceling the strongest interferers. given spatialinterference cancelation, the network transmission capacity is analyzed in thispaper, which is defined as the maximum transmitting node density underconstraints on outage and the signal-to-interference-noise ratio. assuming thepoisson distribution for the locations of network nodes and spatially i.i.d.rayleigh fading channels, mathematical tools from stochastic geometry areapplied for deriving scaling laws for transmission capacity. specifically, forsmall target outage probability, transmission capacity is proved to increasefollowing a power law, where the exponent is the inverse of the size of antennaarray or larger depending on the pass loss exponent. as shown by simulations,spatial interference cancelation increases transmission capacity by an order ofmagnitude or more even if only one extra antenna is added to each node.

1412.1898	joint rate and sinr coverage analysis for decoupled uplink-downlink  biased cell associations in hetnets	load balancing by proactively offloading users onto small and otherwiselightly-loaded cells is critical for tapping the potential of denseheterogeneous cellular networks (hcns). offloading has mostly been studied forthe downlink, where it is generally assumed that a user offloaded to a smallcell will communicate with it on the uplink as well. the impact of coupleddownlink-uplink offloading is not well understood. uplink power control andspatial interference correlation further complicate the mathematical analysisas compared to the downlink. we propose an accurate and tractable model tocharacterize the uplink sinr and rate distribution in a multi-tier hcn as afunction of the association rules and power control parameters. jointuplink-downlink rate coverage is also characterized. using the developedanalysis, it is shown that the optimal degree of channel inversion (for uplinkpower control) increases with load imbalance in the network. in sharp contrastto the downlink, minimum path loss association is shown to be optimal foruplink rate. moreover, with minimum path loss association and full channelinversion, uplink sir is shown to be invariant of infrastructure density. it isfurther shown that a decoupled association---employing differing associationstrategies for uplink and downlink---leads to significant improvement in jointuplink-downlink rate coverage over the standard coupled association in hcns.

1412.2087	statistical modeling and probabilistic analysis of cellular networks  with determinantal point processes	although the poisson point process (ppp) has been widely used to model basestation (bs) locations in cellular networks, it is an idealized model thatneglects the spatial correlation among bss. the present paper proposes the useof determinantal point process (dpp) to take into account these correlations;in particular the repulsiveness among macro base station locations. dpps aredemonstrated to be analytically tractable by leveraging several uniquecomputational properties. specifically, we show that the empty space function,the nearest neighbor function, the mean interference and thesignal-to-interference ratio (sir) distribution have explicit analyticalrepresentations and can be numerically evaluated for cellular networks with dppconfigured bss. in addition, the modeling accuracy of dpps is investigated byfitting three dpp models to real bs location data sets from two major u.s.cities. using hypothesis testing for various performance metrics of interest,we show that these fitted dpps are significantly more accurate than popularchoices such as the ppp and the perturbed hexagonal grid model.

0805.1226	spectrum allocation in two-tier networks	two-tier networks, comprising a conventional cellular network overlaid withshorter range hotspots (e.g. femtocells, distributed antennas, or wiredrelays), offer an economically viable way to improve cellular system capacity.the capacity-limiting factor in such networks is interference. the cross-tierinterference between macrocells and femtocells can suffocate the capacity dueto the near-far problem, so in practice hotspots should use a differentfrequency channel than the potentially nearby high-power macrocell users.centralized or coordinated frequency planning, which is difficult andinefficient even in conventional cellular networks, is all but impossible in atwo-tier network. this paper proposes and analyzes an optimum decentralizedspectrum allocation policy for two-tier networks that employ frequency divisionmultiple access (including ofdma). the proposed allocation is optimal in termsof area spectral efficiency (ase), and is subjected to a sensible quality ofservice (qos) requirement, which guarantees that both macrocell and femtocellusers attain at least a prescribed data rate. results show the dependence ofthis allocation on the qos requirement, hotspot density and the co-channelinterference from the macrocell and surrounding femtocells. designinterpretations of this result are provided.

1512.03452	towards massive machine type cellular communications	cellular networks have been engineered and optimized to carryingever-increasing amounts of mobile data, but over the last few years, a newclass of applications based on machine-centric communications has begun toemerge. automated devices such as sensors, tracking devices, and meters - oftenreferred to as machine-to-machine (m2m) or machine-type communications (mtc) -introduce an attractive revenue stream for mobile network operators, if amassive number of them can be efficiently supported. the novel technicalchallenges posed by mtc applications include increased overhead and controlsignaling as well as diverse application-specific constraints such as ultra-lowcomplexity, extreme energy efficiency, critical timing, and continuous dataintensive uploading. this paper explains the new requirements and challengesthat large-scale mtc applications introduce, and provides a survey on keytechniques for overcoming them. we focus on the potential of 4.5g and 5gnetworks to serve both the high data rate needs of conventional human-typecommunications (htc) subscribers and the forecasted billions of new mtcdevices. we also opine on attractive economic models that will enable this newclass of cellular subscribers to grow to its full potential.

0807.1773	spatial interference cancellation for multi-antenna mobile ad hoc  networks	interference between nodes is a critical impairment in mobile ad hoc networks(manets). this paper studies the role of multiple antennas in mitigating suchinterference. specifically, a network is studied in which receivers applyzero-forcing beamforming to cancel the strongest interferers. assuming anetwork with poisson distributed transmitters and independent rayleigh fadingchannels, the transmission capacity is derived, which gives the maximum numberof successful transmissions per unit area. mathematical tools from stochasticgeometry are applied to obtain the asymptotic transmission capacity scaling andcharacterize the impact of inaccurate channel state information (csi). it isshown that, if each node cancels l interferers, the transmission capacitydecreases as the outage probability to the power of 1/(l+1) as the outageprobability vanishes. for fixed outage probability, as l grows, thetransmission capacity increases as l to the power of (1-2/alpha) where alpha isthe path-loss exponent. moreover, csi inaccuracy is shown to have no effect onthe transmission capacity scaling as the outage probability vanishes, providedthat the csi training sequence has an appropriate length, which we derived.numerical results suggest that canceling merely one interferer by each nodeincreases the transmission capacity by an order of magnitude or more, even whenthe csi is imperfect.

0809.0016	an overview of the transmission capacity of wireless networks	this paper surveys and unifies a number of recent contributions that havecollectively developed a metric for decentralized wireless network analysisknown as transmission capacity. although it is notoriously difficult to derivegeneral end-to-end capacity results for multi-terminal or \adhoc networks, thetransmission capacity (tc) framework allows for quantification of achievablesingle-hop rates by focusing on a simplified physical/mac-layer model. by usingstochastic geometry to quantify the multi-user interference in the network, therelationship between the optimal spatial density and success probability oftransmissions in the network can be determined, and expressed -- often fairlysimply -- in terms of the key network parameters. the basic model andanalytical tools are first discussed and applied to a simple network with pathloss only and we present tight upper and lower bounds on transmission capacity(via lower and upper bounds on outage probability). we then introduce randomchannels (fading/shadowing) and give tc and outage approximations for anarbitrary channel distribution, as well as exact results for the special casesof rayleigh and nakagami fading. we then apply these results to show how tc canbe used to better understand scheduling, power control, and the deployment ofmultiple antennas in a decentralized network. the paper closes by discussingshortcomings in the model as well as future research directions.

0809.5008	multi-antenna communication in ad hoc networks: achieving mimo gains  with simo transmission	the benefit of multi-antenna receivers is investigated in wireless ad hocnetworks, and the main finding is that network throughput can be made to scalelinearly with the number of receive antennas nr even if each transmitting nodeuses only a single antenna. this is in contrast to a large body of prior workin single-user, multiuser, and ad hoc wireless networks that have shown linearscaling is achievable when multiple receive and transmit antennas (i.e., mimotransmission) are employed, but that throughput increases logarithmically orsublinearly with nr when only a single transmit antenna (i.e., simotransmission) is used. the linear gain is achieved by using the receive degreesof freedom to simultaneously suppress interference and increase the power ofthe desired signal, and exploiting the subsequent performance benefit toincrease the density of simultaneous transmissions instead of the transmissionrate. this result is proven in the transmission capacity framework, whichpresumes single-hop transmissions in the presence of randomly locatedinterferers, but it is also illustrated that the result holds under severalrelaxations of the model, including imperfect channel knowledge, multihoptransmission, and regular networks (i.e., interferers are deterministicallylocated on grids).

0810.3869	power control in two-tier femtocell networks	in a two tier cellular network -- comprised of a central macrocell underlaidwith shorter range femtocell hotspots -- cross-tier interference limits overallcapacity with universal frequency reuse. to quantify near-far effects withuniversal frequency reuse, this paper derives a fundamental relation providingthe largest feasible cellular signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (sinr),given any set of feasible femtocell sinrs. we provide a link budget analysiswhich enables simple and accurate performance insights in a two-tier network. adistributed utility-based sinr adaptation at femtocells is proposed in order toalleviate cross-tier interference at the macrocell from cochannel femtocells.the foschini-miljanic (fm) algorithm is a special case of the adaptation. eachfemtocell maximizes their individual utility consisting of a sinr based rewardless an incurred cost (interference to the macrocell). numerical results showgreater than 30% improvement in mean femtocell sinrs relative to fm. in theevent that cross-tier interference prevents a cellular user from obtaining itssinr target, an algorithm is proposed that reduces transmission powers of thestrongest femtocell interferers. the algorithm ensures that a cellular userachieves its sinr target even with 100 femtocells/cell-site, and requires aworst case sinr reduction of only 16% at femtocells. these results motivatedesign of power control schemes requiring minimal network overhead in two-tiernetworks with shared spectrum.

cs;0606022	limited feedback beamforming over temporally-correlated channels	feedback of quantized channel state information (csi), called limitedfeedback, enables transmit beamforming in multiple-input-multiple-output (mimo)wireless systems with a small amount of overhead. due to its efficiency,beamforming with limited feedback has been adopted in several wirelesscommunication standards. prior work on limited feedback commonly adopts theblock fading channel model where temporal correlation in wireless channels isneglected. this paper considers temporally-correlated channels and designssingle-user transmit beamforming with limited feedback. analytical resultsconcerning csi feedback are derived by modeling quantized csi as a first-orderfinite-state markov chain. these results include the source bit rate generatedby time-varying quantized csi, the required bit rate for a csi feedbackchannel, and the effect of feedback delay. in particular, based on the theoryof markov chain convergence rate, feedback delay is proved to reduce thethroughput gain due to csi feedback at least exponentially. furthermore, analgorithm is proposed for csi feedback compression in time. combining theresults in this work leads to a new method for designing limited feedbackbeamforming as demonstrated by a design example.

cs;0606121	performance of orthogonal beamforming for sdma with limited feedback	on the multi-antenna broadcast channel, the spatial degrees of freedomsupport simultaneous transmission to multiple users. the optimal multiusertransmission, known as dirty paper coding, is not directly realizable.moreover, close-to-optimal solutions such as tomlinson-harashima precoding aresensitive to csi inaccuracy. this paper considers a more practical designcalled per user unitary and rate control (pu2rc), which has been proposed foremerging cellular standards. pu2rc supports multiuser simultaneoustransmission, enables limited feedback, and is capable of exploiting multiuserdiversity. its key feature is an orthogonal beamforming (or precoding)constraint, where each user selects a beamformer (or precoder) from a codebookof multiple orthonormal bases. in this paper, the asymptotic throughput scalinglaws for pu2rc with a large user pool are derived for different regimes of thesignal-to-noise ratio (snr). in the multiuser-interference-limited regime, thethroughput of pu2rc is shown to scale logarithmically with the number of users.in the normal snr and noise-limited regimes, the throughput is found to scaledouble logarithmically with the number of users and also linearly with thenumber of antennas at the base station. in addition, numerical results showthat pu2rc achieves higher throughput and is more robust against csiquantization errors than the popular alternative of zero-forcing beamforming ifthe number of users is sufficiently large.

cs;0609030	space division multiple access with a sum feedback rate constraint	on a multi-antenna broadcast channel, simultaneous transmission to multipleusers by joint beamforming and scheduling is capable of achieving highthroughput, which grows double logarithmically with the number of users. thesum rate for channel state information (csi) feedback, however, increaseslinearly with the number of users, reducing the effective uplink capacity. toaddress this problem, a novel space division multiple access (sdma) design isproposed, where the sum feedback rate is upper-bounded by a constant. thisdesign consists of algorithms for csi quantization, threshold based csifeedback, and joint beamforming and scheduling. the key feature of the proposedapproach is the use of feedback thresholds to select feedback users with largechannel gains and small csi quantization errors such that the sum feedback rateconstraint is satisfied. despite this constraint, the proposed sdma design isshown to achieve a sum capacity growth rate close to the optimal one. moreover,the feedback overflow probability for this design is found to decreaseexponentially with the difference between the allowable and the average sumfeedback rates. numerical results show that the proposed sdma design is capableof attaining higher sum capacities than existing ones, even though the sumfeedback rate is bounded.

0812.3120	mode switching for mimo broadcast channel based on delay and channel  quantization	imperfect channel state information degrades the performance ofmultiple-input multiple-output (mimo) communications; its effect on single-user(su) and multi-user (mu) mimo transmissions are quite different. in particular,mu-mimo suffers from residual inter-user interference due to imperfect channelstate information while su-mimo only suffers from a power loss. this papercompares the throughput loss of both su and mu mimo on the downlink due todelay and channel quantization. accurate closed-form approximations are derivedfor the achievable rates for both su and mu mimo. it is shown that su-mimo isrelatively robust to delayed and quantized channel information, while mu mimowith zero-forcing precoding loses spatial multiplexing gain with a fixed delayor fixed codebook size. based on derived achievable rates, a mode switchingalgorithm is proposed that switches between su and mu mimo modes to improve thespectral efficiency, based on the average signal-to-noise ratio (snr), thenormalized doppler frequency, and the channel quantization codebook size. theoperating regions for su and mu modes with different delays and codebook sizesare determined, which can be used to select the preferred mode. it is shownthat the mu mode is active only when the normalized doppler frequency is verysmall and the codebook size is large.
