0901.2347	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field. the point-like  x-ray source catalogue	the cosmos survey is a multiwavelength survey aimed to study the evolution ofgalaxies, agn and the large scale structure. the xmm-cosmos is a deep x-raysurvey over the full 2 deg2 of the cosmos area. it consists of 55 xmm-newtonpointings for a total exposure of ~1.5 ms with an average vignetting correcteddepth of 40 ks across the field of view and a sky coverage of 2.13 deg2. wepresent the catalogue of point-like x-ray sources detected with the epic ccdcameras, the logn-logs relations and the x-ray colour-colour diagrams. theanalysis was performed in the 0.5-2 kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kev energy bands.the completeness of the catalogue as well as logn-logs have been calibratedusing monte carlo simulations. the catalogs contains a total of 1887 uniquesources detected in at least one band. the survey, that shows unprecedentedhomogeneity, has a flux limit of ~1.7x10-15 erg cm-2 s-1, ~9.3x10-15 erg cm-2s-1 and ~1.3x10-14 erg cm-2 s-1 over 90% of the area (1.92 deg2) in the 0.5-2kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kev energy band, respectively. thanks to the ratherhomogeneous exposure over a large area, the derived logn-logs relations arevery well determined over the flux range sampled by xmm-cosmos. these relationshave been compared with xrb synthesis models, which reproduce the observationswith an agreement of ~10% in the 5-10 kev and 2-10 kev band, while in the 0.5-2kev band the agreement is of the order of ~20%. the hard x-ray colors confirmedthat the majority of the extragalactic sources, in a bright subsample, areactually type i or type ii agn. about 20% of the sources have x-ray luminositytypical of agn (l_x &gt;1042 erg/s) although they do not show any clear signatureof nuclear activity in the optical spectrum.

0909.2535	spectroscopic identifications of spitzer sources in the  swire/xmm-newton/elais-s1 field: a large fraction of active galactic nuclei  with high f(24micron)/f(r) ratio	we present a catalog of optical spectroscopic identifications of sourcesdetected by spitzer at 3.6 or 24 micron down to 10 and 280 microjy,respectively, in the swire/xmm-newton/elais-s1 field and classified via linewidth analysis and diagnostic diagrams. a total of 1376 sources down to r~24.2mag have been identified (1362 detected at 3.6 micron, 419 at 24 micron, and405 at both) by low-resolution optical spectroscopy carried out with fors2,vimos, and efosc2 at the very large telescope and 3.6m eso telescopes. thespectroscopic campaigns have been carried out over the central 0.6 squaredegrees area of elais-s1 which, in particular, has also been observed byxmm-newton and chandra. we find the first direct optical spectroscopic evidencethat the fraction of active galactic nuclei (agn; mostly agn2) increases withincreasing f(24 micron)/f(r) ratio, reaching values of 70(+/-20)% in the range316&lt;f(24 micron)f(r)&lt;1000. we present an irac-mips color-color diagram able toseparate agn1 from obscured agn2 candidates. after having corrected for thespectroscopic incompleteness of our sample, it results that the agn fraction atf(24 micron)=0.8 mjy is ~22(+/-7)% and decreases slowly to ~19(+/-5)% down tof(24 micron)=0.3 mjy.

0910.2617	the chandra survey of the cosmos field ii: source detection and  photometry	the chandra cosmos survey (c-cosmos) is a large, 1.8 ms, chandra program,that covers the central contiguous ~0.92 deg^2 of the cosmos field. c-cosmos isthe result of a complex tiling, with every position being observed in up to sixoverlapping pointings (four overlapping pointings in most of the central ~0.45deg^2 area with the best exposure, and two overlapping pointings in most of thesurrounding area, covering an additional ~0.47 deg^2). therefore, the fullexploitation of the c-cosmos data requires a dedicated and accurate analysisfocused on three main issues: 1) maximizing the sensitivity when the psfchanges strongly among different observations of the same source (from ~1arcsec up to ~10 arcsec half power radius); 2) resolving close pairs; and 3)obtaining the best source localization and count rate. we present here ourtreatment of four key analysis items: source detection, localization,photometry, and survey sensitivity. our final procedure consists of a two stepprocedure: (1) a wavelet detection algorithm, to find source candidates, (2) amaximum likelihood point spread function fitting algorithm to evaluate thesource count rates and the probability that each source candidate is afluctuation of the background. we discuss the main characteristics of thisprocedure, that was the result of detailed comparisons between differentdetection algorithms and photometry tools, calibrated with extensive anddedicated simulations.

0707.2342	agn counts at 15um. xmm observations of the elais-s1-5 sample	context: the counts of galaxies and agn in the mid infra-red (mir) bands areimportant instruments for studying their cosmological evolution. however, theclassic spectral line ratios techniques can become misleading when trying toproperly separate agn from starbursts or even from apparently normal galaxies.  aims: we use x-ray band observations to discriminate agn activity inpreviously classified mir-selected starburst galaxies and to derive updatedagn1 and (compton thin) agn2 counts at 15 um.  methods: xmm observations of the elais-s1 15um sample down to flux limits~2x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (2-10 kev band) were used. we classified as agn allthose mir sources with a unabsorbed 2-10 kev x-ray luminosity higher that~10^42 erg/s.  results: we find that at least about 13(+/-6) per cent of the previouslyclassified starburst galaxies harbor an agn. according to these figures, weprovide an updated estimate of the counts of agn1 and (compton thin) agn2 at 15um. it turns out that at least 24% of the extragalactic sources brighter than0.6 my at 15 um are agn (~13% contribution to the extragalactic backgroundproduced at fluxes brighter than 0.6 mjy).

0707.2465	the xmm-newton view of iras 09104+4109: evidence for a changing-look  type 2 quasar?	we analyzed the spectroscopic data from the pn and the mos cameras in the0.4-10 kev band. we also used an archival bepposax 1-50 kev observation of iras09104+4109 to investigate possible variations of the quasar emission. the x-rayemission in the epic band is dominated by the intra-cluster medium thermalemission. we found that the quasar contributes ~35% of the total flux in the2-10 kev band. both a transmission- (through a compton-thin absorber with acompton optical depth of \tau_c~0.3, i.e. nh~5 x 10^{23} cm^-2) and areflection-dominated (\tau_c&gt;1) model provide an excellent fit to the quasarcontinuum emission. however, the value measured for the ew of fe kalphaemission line is only marginally consistent with the presence of acompton-thick absorber in a reflection-dominated scenario, which had beensuggested by a previous, marginal (i.e. 2.5\sigma) detection with the hardx-ray (15-50 kev), non-imaging bepposax/pds instrument. moreover, the value ofluminosity in the 2-10 kev band measured by the transmission-dominated model isfully consistent with that expected on the basis of the bolometric luminosityof iras 09104+4109. from the analysis of the xmm-newton data we thereforesuggest the possibility that the absorber along the line of sight to thenucleus of iras 09104+4109 is compton-thin. alternatively, the absorber columndensity could have changed from compton-thick to -thin in the five yearselapsed between the observations. if this is the case, then iras 09104+4109 isthe first 'changing-look' quasar ever detected.

1003.0020	a runaway black hole in cosmos: gravitational wave or slingshot recoil?	we present a detailed study of a peculiar source in the cosmos survey atz=0.359. source cxocj100043.1+020637 (cid-42) presents two compact opticalsources embedded in the same galaxy. the distance between the 2, measured inthe hst/acs image, is 0.495" that, at the redshift of the source, correspondsto a projected separation of 2.46 kpc. a large (~1200 km/s) velocity offsetbetween the narrow and broad components of hbeta has been measured in threedifferent optical spectra from the vlt/vimos and magellan/imacs instruments.cid-42 is also the only x-ray source having in its x-ray spectra a strongredshifted broad absorption iron line, and an iron emission line, drawing aninverted p-cygni profile. the chandra and xmm data show that the absorptionline is variable in energy by 500 ev over 4 years and that the absorber has tobe highly ionized, in order not to leave a signature in the soft x-rayspectrum. that these features occur in the same source is unlikely to be acoincidence. we envisage two possible explanations: (1) a gravitational waverecoiling black hole (bh), caught 1-10 myr after merging, (2) a type 1/ type 2system in the same galaxy where the type 1 is recoiling due to slingshot effectproduced by a triple bh system. the first possibility gives us a candidategravitational waves recoiling bh with both spectroscopic and imagingsignatures. in the second case, the x-ray absorption line can be explained as abal-like outflow from the foreground nucleus (a type 2 agn) at the rearer one(a type 1 agn), which illuminates the otherwise undetectable wind, giving usthe first opportunity to show that fast winds are present in obscured agn.

1012.4011	the xmm deep survey in the cdfs i. first results on heavily obscured agn	we present the first results of the spectroscopy of distant, obscured agn asobtained with the ultra-deep (~3.3 ms) xmm-newton survey in the chandra deepfield south (cdfs). one of the primary goals of the project is to characterizethe x-ray spectral properties of obscured and heavily obscured compton-thickagn over the range of redhifts and luminosities that are relevant in terms oftheir contribution to the x-ray background. the ultra-deep exposure, coupledwith the xmm detector's spectral throughput, allowed us to accumulate goodquality x-ray spectra for a large number of x-ray sources and, in particular,for heavily obscured agn at cosmological redshifts. specifically we present thex-ray spectral properties of two high-redshift - z= 1.53 and z=3.70 - sources.the xmm spectra of both are very hard, with a strong iron kalpha line at arest-frame energy of 6.4 kev. a reflection-dominated continuum provides thebest description of the x-ray spectrum of the z=1.53 source, while theintrinsic continuum of the z=3.70 agn is obscured by a large column n_h ~ 10^24cm-2 of cold gas. compton-thick absorption, or close to it, is unambiguouslydetected in both sources. interestingly, these sources would not be selected ascandidate compton thick agn by some multiwavelength selection criteria based onthe mid-infrared to optical and x-ray to optical flux ratios.

1108.6061	dissecting photometric redshift for active galactic nuclei using xmm-  and chandra-cosmos samples	with this paper, we release accurate photometric redshifts for 1692counterparts to chandra sources in the central square degree of the cosmosfield. the availability of a large training set of spectroscopic redshifts thatextends to faint magnitudes enabled photometric redshifts comparable to thehighest quality results presently available for normal galaxies. we demonstratethat morphologically extended, faint x-ray sources without optical variabilityare more accurately described by a library of normal galaxies (corrected foremission lines) than by agn-dominated templates, even if these sources haveagn-like x-ray luminosities. preselecting the library on the bases of thesource properties allowed us to reach an accuracy sigma_(delta z/(1+z_spec))\sim0.015 with a fraction of outliers of 5.8% for the entire chandra-cosmossample. in addition, we release revised photometric redshifts for the 1735optical counterparts of the xmm-detected sources over the entire 2 sq. deg.ofcosmos. for 248 sources, our updated photometric redshift differs from theprevious release by delta z&gt;0.2. these changes are predominantly due to theinclusion of newly available deep h-band photometry h_ab=24 mag. we illustrateonce again the importance of a spectroscopic training sample and how anassumption about the nature of a source together with the number and the depthof the available bands influence the accuracy of the photometric redshiftsdetermined for agn. these considerations should be kept in mind when definingthe observational strategies of upcoming large surveys targeting agn, such aserosita at x-ray energies and askap/emu in the radio band.

0710.1811	the hellas2xmm survey: xi. unveiling the nature of x-ray bright  optically normal galaxies	x-ray bright optically normal galaxies (xbongs) constitute a small but notnegligible fraction of hard x-ray selected sources in recent chandra andxmm-newton surveys. even though several possibilities were proposed to explainwhy a relatively luminous hard x-ray source does not leave any significantsignature of its presence in terms of optical emission lines, the nature ofxbongs is still subject of debate. we aim to a better understanding of theirnature by means of a multiwavelength and morphological analysis of a smallsample of these sources. good-quality photometric near-infrared data(isaac/vlt) of four low-redshift (z=0.1-0.3) xbongs, selected from thehellas2xmm survey, have been used to search for the presence of the putativenucleus, applying the surface-brightness decomposition technique through theleast-squares fitting program galfit. the surface brightness decompositionallows us to reveal a nuclear point-like source, likely to be responsible ofthe x-ray emission, in two out of the four sources. the results indicate thatmoderate amounts of gas and dust, covering a large solid angle (possibly 4pi)at the nuclear source, combined with the low nuclear activity, may explain thelack of optical emission lines. the third xbong is associated with an x-rayextended source and no nuclear excess is detected in the near infrared at thelimits of our observations. the last source is associated to a close (d&lt; 1arcsec) double system and the fitting procedure cannot achieve a firmconclusion.

1109.2888	faint high-redshift agn in the chandra deep field south: the evolution  of the agn luminosity function and black hole demography	we present detection and analysis of faint x-ray sources in the chandra deepfield south (cdfs) using the 4 msec chandra observation and adopting a newdetection algorithm, based on a targeted search at the position of known high-zgalaxies. this optimized technique results in the identification of 54 z&gt;3agns, 29 of which are new detections. applying stringent completeness criteria,we derive agn luminosity functions in the redshift bins 3-4, 4-5 and &gt;5.8 andfor 42.75&lt;log l(2-10 kev)&lt;44.5. we join this data with the luminous agnluminosity functions from optical surveys and find that the evolution of thehigh-z, wide luminosity range luminosity function can be best modeled by pureluminosity evolution with l* decreasing from 6x10^44 ergs/s at z=3 tol*=2x10^44 ergs/s at z=6. we compare the high-z luminosity function with theprediction of theoretical models using galaxy interactions as agn triggeringmechanism. we find that these models are broadly able to reproduce the high-zagn luminosity functions. a better agreement is found assuming a minimum darkmatter halo mass for black hole formation and growth. we compare our agnluminosity functions with galaxy mass functions to derive high-z agn duty cycleusing observed eddington ratio distributions to derive black hole masses. wefind that the duty cycle increases with galaxy stellar mass and redshift by afactor 10-30 from z=0.25 to z=4-5. we also report on the detection of a largefraction of highly obscured, compton thick agn at z&gt;3 (18+17-10%). theiroptical counterparts are not strongly reddened and we thus conclude that thesize of the x-ray absorber is likely smaller than the dust sublimation radius.we finally report the discovery of a highly star-forming galaxy at z=3.47. ifconfirmed, this would be one of the farthest objects in which stellar sourcesare detected in x-rays.

(2004) and hopkins et al.(2007). black hole masses and eddington ratios are available for 170 type-1agn, while black hole masses for type-2 agn are computed for 481 objects usingthe black hole mass-stellar mass relation and the morphological information. weconfirm a trend between kbol and lambda_edd, with lower hard x-ray bolometriccorrections at lower eddington ratios for both type-1 and type-2 agn. we findthat, on average, eddington ratio increases with redshift for all types of agnat any given mbh, while no clear evolution with redshift is seen at any givenlbol.

1403.2491	nustar j033202-2746.8: direct constraints on the compton reflection in a  heavily obscured quasar at z~2	we report nustar observations of nustar j033202-2746.8, a heavily obscured,radio-loud quasar detected in the extended chandra deep field-south, thedeepest layer of the nustar extragalactic survey (~400 ks, at its deepest).nustar j033202-2746.8 is reliably detected by nustar only at e&gt;8 kev and has avery flat spectral slope in the nustar energy band (gamma=0.55^{+0.62}_{-0.64};3-30 kev). combining the nustar data with extremely deep observations bychandra and xmm-newton (4 ms and 3 ms, respectively), we constrain thebroad-band x-ray spectrum of nustar j033202-2746.8, indicating that this sourceis a heavily obscured quasar (n_h=5.6^{+0.9}_{-0.8}x10^23 cm^-2) withluminosity l_{10-40 kev}~6.4x10^44 erg s^-1. although existing optical andnear-infrared (near-ir) data, as well as follow-up spectroscopy with the keckand vlt telescopes, failed to provide a secure redshift identification fornustar j033202-2746.8, we reliably constrain the redshift z=2.00+/-0.04 fromthe x-ray spectral features (primarily from the iron k edge). the nustarspectrum shows a significant reflection component (r=0.55^{+0.44}_{-0.37}),which was not constrained by previous analyses of chandra and xmm-newton dataalone. the measured reflection fraction is higher than the r~0 typicallyobserved in bright radio-loud quasars such as nustar j033202-2746.8, which hasl_{1.4 ghz}~10^27 w hz^-1. constraining the spectral shape of agn, includingbright quasars, is very important for understanding the agn population, and canhave a strong impact on the modeling of the x-ray background. our results showthe importance of nustar in investigating the broad-band spectral properties ofquasars out to high redshift.

1406.3345	the 2-79 kev x-ray spectrum of the circinus galaxy with nustar,  xmm-newton and chandra: a fully compton-thick agn	the circinus galaxy is one of the nearest obscured agn, making it an idealtarget for detailed study. combining archival chandra and xmm-newton data withnew nustar observations, we model the 2-79 kev spectrum to constrain theprimary agn continuum and to derive physical parameters for the obscuringmaterial. chandra's high angular resolution allows a separation of nuclear andoff-nuclear galactic emission. in the off-nuclear diffuse emission we findsignatures of strong cold reflection, including high equivalent-width neutralfe lines. this compton-scattered off-nuclear emission amounts to 18% of thenuclear flux in the fe line region, but becomes comparable to the nuclearemission above 30 kev. the new analysis no longer supports a prominenttransmitted agn component in the observed band. we find that the nuclearspectrum is consistent with compton-scattering by an optically-thick torus,where the intrinsic spectrum is a powerlaw of photon index $\gamma = 2.2-2.4$,the torus has an equatorial column density of $n_{\rm h} =(6-10)\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ and the intrinsic agn $2-10$ kev luminosity is$(2.3-5.1)\times 10^{42}$ erg/s. these values place circinus along the samerelations as unobscured agn in accretion rate-vs-$\gamma$ and $l_x$-vs-$l_{ir}$phase space. nustar's high sensitivity and low background allow us to study theshort time-scale variability of circinus at x-ray energies above 10 kev for thefirst time. the lack of detected variability favors a compton-thick absorber,in line with the the spectral fitting results.

1407.1844	nustar unveils a compton-thick type 2 quasar in mrk 34	we present nustar 3-40 kev observations of the optically selected type 2quasar (qso2) sdss j1034+6001 or mrk 34. the high-quality hard x-ray spectrumand archival xmm-newton data can be fitted self-consistently with areflection-dominated continuum and strong fe kalpha fluorescence line withequivalent-width &gt;1 kev. prior x-ray spectral fitting below 10 kev showed thesource to be consistent with being obscured by compton-thin column densities ofgas along the line-of-sight, despite evidence for much higher columns frommultiwavelength data. nustar now enables a direct measurement of this column,and shows that nh lies in the compton-thick (ct) regime. the new data also showa high intrinsic 2-10 kev luminosity of l_{2-10}~10^{44} erg/s, in contrast toprevious low-energy x-ray measurements for which l_{2-10}&lt;~10^{43} erg/s (i.e.x-ray selection below 10 kev does not pick up this source as an intrinsicallyluminous obscured quasar). both the obscuring column and the intrinsic powerare about an order of magnitude (or more) larger than inferred from pre-nustarx-ray spectral fitting. mrk34 is thus a 'gold standard' ct qso2 and is thenearest non-merging system in this class, in contrast to the other local ctquasar ngc6240 which is currently undergoing a major merger coupled with strongstar-formation. for typical x-ray bolometric correction factors, the accretionluminosity of mrk34 is high enough to potentially power the total infraredluminosity. x-ray spectral fitting also shows that thermal emission related tostar-formation is unlikely to drive the observed bright soft component below ~3kev, favoring photionization instead.

1408.3633	weak hard x-ray emission from broad absorption line quasars: evidence  for intrinsic x-ray weakness	we report nustar observations of a sample of six x-ray weak broad absorptionline (bal) quasars. these targets, at z=0.148-1.223, are among the opticallybrightest and most luminous bal quasars known at z&lt;1.3. however, theirrest-frame 2 kev luminosities are 14 to &gt;330 times weaker than expected fortypical quasars. our results from a pilot nustar study of two low-redshift balquasars, a chandra stacking analysis of a sample of high-redshift bal quasars,and a nustar spectral analysis of the local bal quasar mrk 231 have alreadysuggested the existence of intrinsically x-ray weak bal quasars, i.e., quasarsnot emitting x-rays at the level expected from their optical/uv emission. theaim of the current program is to extend the search for such extraordinaryobjects. three of the six new targets are weakly detected by nustar with &lt;45counts in the 3-24 kev band, and the other three are not detected. the hardx-ray (8-24 kev) weakness observed by nustar requires compton-thick absorptionif these objects have nominal underlying x-ray emission. however, a softstacked effective photon index ({\gamma}~1.8) for this sample disfavorscompton-thick absorption in general. the uniform hard x-ray weakness observedby nustar for this and the pilot samples selected with &lt;10 kev weakness alsosuggests that the x-ray weakness is intrinsic in at least some of the targets.we conclude that the nustar observations have likely discovered a significantpopulation (&gt;33%) of intrinsically x-ray weak objects among the bal quasarswith significantly weak &lt;10 kev emission. we suggest that intrinsically x-rayweak quasars might be preferentially observed as bal quasars.

1408.5414	the nustar view of nearby compton-thick agn: the cases of ngc 424, ngc  1320 and ic 2560	we present x-ray spectral analyses for three seyfert 2 active galacticnuclei, ngc 424, ngc 1320, and ic 2560, observed by nustar in the 3-79 kevband. the high quality hard x-ray spectra allow detailed modeling of thecompton reflection component for the first time in these sources. usingquasi-simultaneous nustar and swift/xrt data, as well as archival xmm-newtondata, we find that all three nuclei are obscured by compton-thick material withcolumn densities in excess of ~5 x $10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and that their x-rayspectra above 3 kev are dominated by reflection of the intrinsic continuum oncompton-thick material. due to the very high obscuration, absorbed intrinsiccontinuum components are not formally required by the data in any of thesources. we constrain the intrinsic photon indices and the column density ofthe reflecting medium through the shape of the reflection spectra. usingarchival multi-wavelength data we recover the intrinsic x-ray luminositiesconsistent with the broadband spectral energy distributions. our results areconsistent with the reflecting medium being an edge-on clumpy torus with arelatively large global covering factor and overall reflection efficiency ofthe order of 1%. given the unambiguous confirmation of the compton-thick natureof the sources, we investigate whether similar sources are likely to be missedby commonly used selection criteria for compton-thick agn, and explore thepossibility of finding their high-redshift counterparts.

1502.04699	rapid variability of blazar 3c 279 during flaring states in 2013-2014  with joint fermi-lat, nustar, swift, and ground-based multi-wavelength  observations	we report the results of a multi-band observing campaign on the famous blazar3c 279 conducted during a phase of increased activity from 2013 december to2014 april, including first observations of it with nustar. the $\gamma$-rayemission of the source measured by fermi-lat showed multiple distinct flaresreaching the highest flux level measured in this object since the beginning ofthe fermi mission, with $f(e &gt; 100\,{\rm mev})$ of $10^{-5}$ photons cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, and with a flux doubling time scale as short as 2 hours. the$\gamma$-ray spectrum during one of the flares was very hard, with an index of$\gamma_\gamma = 1.7 \pm 0.1$, which is rarely seen in flat spectrum radioquasars. the lack of concurrent optical variability implies a very high comptondominance parameter $l_\gamma/l_{\rm syn} &gt; 300$. two 1-day nustar observationswith accompanying swift pointings were separated by 2 weeks, probing differentlevels of source activity. while the 0.5$-$70 kev x-ray spectrum obtainedduring the first pointing, and fitted jointly with swift-xrt is well-describedby a simple power law, the second joint observation showed an unusual spectralstructure: the spectrum softens by $\delta\gamma_{\rm x} \simeq 0.4$ at $\sim$4kev. modeling the broad-band sed during this flare with the standardsynchrotron plus inverse compton model requires: (1) the location of the$\gamma$-ray emitting region is comparable with the broad line region radius,(2) a very hard electron energy distribution index $p \simeq 1$, (3) total jetpower significantly exceeding the accretion disk luminosity $l_{\rm j}/l_{\rmd} \gtrsim 10$, and (4) extremely low jet magnetization with $l_{\rm b}/l_{\rmj} \lesssim 10^{-4}$. we also find that single-zone models that match theobserved $\gamma$-ray and optical spectra cannot satisfactorily explain theproduction of x-ray emission.

1502.07353	determining the covering factor of compton-thick active galactic nuclei  with nustar	the covering factor of compton-thick obscuring material associated with thetorus in active galactic nuclei (agn) is at present best understood through thefraction of sources exhibiting compton-thick absorption along the line of sight($n_{h}&gt;1.5\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) in the x-ray band, which reveals theaverage covering factor. determining this compton-thick fraction is difficulthowever, due to the extreme obscuration. with its spectral coverage at hardx-rays ($&gt;$10 kev), nustar is sensitive to the agn covering factor sincecompton scattering of x-rays off optically thick material dominates at theseenergies. we present a spectral analysis of 10 agn observed with nustar wherethe obscuring medium is optically thick to compton scattering, so calledcompton-thick (ct) agn. we use the torus models of brightman &amp; nandra whichpredict the x-ray spectrum from reprocessing in a torus and include the torusopening angle as a free parameter and aim to determine the covering factor ofthe compton-thick gas in these sources individually. across the sample we findmild to heavy compton-thick columns, with $n_{h}$ measured from$10^{24}-10^{26}$ cm$^{-2}$, and a wide range of covering factors, whereindividual measurements range from 0.2-0.9. we find that the covering factor,$f_{c}$, is a strongly decreasing function of the intrinsic 2-10 kevluminosity, $l_{x}$, where $f_{c}=(-0.41\pm0.13)$log$_{10}$($l_{x}$/ergs$^{-1}$)$+18.31\pm5.33$, across more than two orders of magnitude in $l_{x}$(10$^{41.5}-10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$). the covering factors measured here agreewell with the obscured fraction as a function of $l_{x}$ as determined bystudies of local agn with $l_{x}&gt;10^{42.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$.

0805.2948	variability-selected active galactic nuclei from supernova search in the  chandra deep field south	variability is a property shared by virtually all active galactic nuclei(agns), and was adopted as a criterion for their selection using data frommulti epoch surveys. low luminosity agns (llagns) are contaminated by the lightof their host galaxies, and cannot therefore be detected by the usual colourtechniques. for this reason, their evolution in cosmic time is poorly known.consistency with the evolution derived from x-ray detected samples has not beenclearly established so far, also because the low luminosity population consistsof a mixture of different object types. llagns can be detected by the nuclearoptical variability of extended objects. several variability surveys have been,or are being, conducted for the detection of supernovae (sne). we propose tore-analyse these sne data using a variability criterion optimised for agndetection, to select a new agn sample and study its properties. we analysedimages acquired with the wide field imager at the 2.2 m eso/mpi telescope, inthe framework of the stress supernova survey. we selected the axaf fieldcentred on the chandra deep field south where, besides the deep x-ray survey,various optical data exist, originating in the eis and combo-17 photometricsurveys and the spectroscopic database of goods. we obtained a catalogue of 132variable agn candidates. several of the candidates are x-ray sources. wecompare our results with an hst variability study of x-ray and ir detectedagns, finding consistent results. the relatively high fraction of confirmedagns in our sample (60%) allowed us to extract a list of reliable agncandidates for spectroscopic follow-up observations.

1511.04184	the nustar extragalactic surveys: first direct measurements of the &gt;10  kev x-ray luminosity function for active galactic nuclei at z&gt;0.1	we present the first direct measurements of the rest-frame 10-40 kev x-rayluminosity function (xlf) of active galactic nuclei (agns) based on a sample of94 sources at 0.1 &lt; z &lt;3, selected at 8-24 kev energies from sources in thenustar extragalactic survey program. our results are consistent with the strongevolution of the agn population seen in prior, lower-energy studies of the xlf.however, different models of the intrinsic distribution of absorption, whichare used to correct for selection biases, give significantly differentpredictions for the total number of sources in our sample, leading to small,systematic differences in our binned estimates of the xlf. adopting a modelwith a lower intrinsic fraction of compton-thick sources and a largerpopulation of sources with column densities n_h ~ 10^{23-24} /cm2 or a modelwith stronger compton reflection component (with a relative normalization of r~ 2 at all luminosities) can bring extrapolations of the xlf from 2-10 kev intoagreement with our nustar sample. ultimately, x-ray spectral analysis of thenustar sources is required to break this degeneracy between the distribution ofabsorbing column densities and the strength of the compton reflection componentand thus refine our measurements of the xlf. furthermore, the models thatsuccessfully describe the high-redshift population seen by nustar tend toover-predict previous, high-energy measurements of the local xlf, indicatingthat there is evolution of the agn population that is not fully captured by thecurrent models.

1511.04185	the nustar extragalactic surveys: overview and catalog from the cosmos  field	to provide the census of the sources contributing to the x-ray backgroundpeak above 10 kev, nustar is performing extragalactic surveys using athree-tier "wedding cake" approach. we present the nustar survey of the cosmosfield, the medium sensitivity and medium area tier, covering 1.7 deg2 andoverlapping with both chandra and xmm-newton data. this survey consists of 121observations for a total exposure of ~3 ms. to fully exploit these data, wedeveloped a new detection strategy, carefully tested through extensivesimulations. the survey sensitivity at 20% completeness is 5.9, 2.9 and 6.4 x10^-14 erg/cm2/s in the 3-24 kev, 3-8 kev and 8-24 kev bands, respectively. bycombining detections in 3 bands, we have a sample of 91 nustar sources with10^42 -10^45.5 erg/s luminosities and redshift z=0.04-2.5. thirty two sourcesare detected in the 8-24 kev band with fluxes ~100 times fainter than sourcesdetected by swift-bat. of the 91 detections, all but four are associated with achandra and/or xmm-newton point-like counterpart. one source is associated withan extended lower energy x-ray source. we present the x-ray (hardness ratio andluminosity) and optical-to-x-ray properties. the observed fraction of candidatecompton-thick agn measured from the hardness ratio is between 13-20%. wediscuss the spectral properties of nustar j100259+0220.6 (id 330) at z=0.044,with the highest hardness ratio in the entire sample. the measured columndensity exceeds 10^24 /cm2, implying the source is compton-thick. this sourcewas not previously recognized as such without the &gt;10 kev data.

0705.2864	unveiling obscured accretion in the chandra deep field south	a large population of heavily obscured, compton thick agns is predicted bymodels of galaxy formation, models of cosmic x-ray background and by the``relic'' super-massive black-hole mass function measured from local bulges.however, so far only a handful of compton thick agns have been possiblydetected using even the deepest chandra and xmm surveys. compton-thick agns canbe recovered thanks to the reprocessing of the agn uv emission in the infraredby selecting sources with agn luminosity's in the mid-infrared and faintnear-infrared and optical emission. to this purpose, we make use of deep hst,vlt, spitzer and chandra data on the chandra deep field south to constrain thenumber of compton thick agn in this field. we show that sources with high24$\mu$m to optical flux ratios and red colors form a distinct sourcepopulation, and that their infrared luminosity is dominated by agn emission.analysis of the x-ray properties of these extreme sources shows that most ofthem (80$\pm15%$) are indeed likely to be highly obscured, compton thick agns.the number of infrared selected, compton thick agns with 5.8$\mu$m luminosityhigher than $10^{44.2}$ erg s$^{-1}$ turns out to be similar to that of x-rayselected, unobscured and moderately obscured agns with 2-10 kev luminosityhigher than $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the redshift bin 1.2-2.6. this ``factorof 2'' source population is exactly what it is needed to solve thediscrepancies between model predictions and x-ray agn selection.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.

0806.4543	the blast wave model for agn feedback: effects on agn obscuration	we compute the effect of the galactic absorption on agn emission in acosmological context by including a physical model for agn feeding and feedbackin a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. this is based on galaxyinteractions as triggers for agn accretion, and on expanding blast waves as amechanism to propagate outwards the agn energy injected into the interstellarmedium at the center of galaxies. we first test our model against the observednumber density of agns with different intrinsic luminosity as a function ofredshift. the model yields a ''downsizing'' behavior in close agreement withthe observed one for z&lt;2. at higher redshifts, the model predicts an overallabundance of agns (including compton-thick sources) larger than the observedcompton-thin sources by a factor around 2 for z&gt;2 and l_x &lt; 10^{44} erg/s.thus, we expect that at such luminosities and redshifts about 1/2 of the totalagn population is contributed by compton-thick sources. we then investigate thedependence of the absorbing column density n_h associated to cold galactic gas(and responsible for the compton-thin component of the overall obscuration) onthe agn luminosity and redshift. we find that the absorbed fraction of agnswith n_h&gt;10^{22} cm^{-2} decreases with luminosity for z&lt;1; in addition, thetotal (integrated over luminosity) absorbed fraction increases with redshift upto z around 2, and saturates to the value around 0.8 at higher redshifts.finally, we predict the luminosity dependence of the absorbed fraction of agnswith l_x&lt; 3 10^{44} erg/s to weaken with increasing redshift. we compare ourresults with recent observations, and discuss their implications in the contextof cosmological models of galaxy formation.

0806.4778	the xmm-newton survey of the elais-s1 field ii: optical identifications  and multiwavelength catalogue of x-ray sources	we present optical identifications and a multi-band catalogue of a sample of478 x-ray sources in the xmm and chandra surveys of the central 0.6 deg^2 ofthe elais-s1 field. the optical/infrared counterpart of each x-ray source wasidentified using r and irac 3.6 um bands. this method was complemented by theprecise positions obtained through chandra observations. approximately 94% ofthe counterparts are detected in the r band, while the remaining are blankfields in the optical down to r~24.5, but have a near-infrared counterpartdetected by irac within 6 arcsec from the xmm centroid. the multi-bandcatalogue contains photometry in ten photometric bands (b to the mips 24 um).we determined redshift and classification for 237 sources (~50% of the sample)brighter than r=24. we classified 47% of the sources with spectroscopicredshift as broad-line active galactic nuclei (bl agns) with z=0.1-3.5, whilesources without broad-lines are about 46% of the spectroscopic sample and arefound up to z=2.6. we identified 11 type 2 qsos among the sources with x/o&gt;8,with z=0.9-2.6, high 2-10 kev luminosity (log(l2-10kev)&gt;=43.8 erg/s) and hardx-ray colors suggesting large absorbing columns at the rest frame (logn_h up to23.6 cm^-2). bl agns show on average blue optical-to-near-infrared colors,softer x-ray colors and x-ray-to-optical colors typical of optically selectedagns. conversely, narrow-line sources show redder optical colors, harder x-rayflux ratio and span a wider range of x-ray-to-optical colors. on average theseds of high-luminosity bl agns resemble the power-law typical of unobscuredagns. the seds of not bl agns are dominated by the galaxy emission in theoptical/near-infrared, and show a rise in the mid-infrared which suggests thepresence of an obscured active nucleus.

astro-ph;0401298	the hellas2xmm survey. v. near-infrared observations of x-ray sources  with extreme x/o ratios	we present the results of deep near-infrared observations of 11 hard x-rayselected sources in the hellas2xmm survey, with faint optical magnitude (r&gt;24)and high x-ray-to-optical flux ratio. all but one of the sources have beendetected in the ks band, with bright counterparts (ks&lt;19) and red colors(r-k&gt;5), and therefore belong to the ero population. a detailed analysis of thesurface brightness profiles allows us to classify all of the nir counterparts.there are 2 point-like objects, 7 elliptical galaxies and one source with adisky profile. none of the extended sources shows any evidence for the presenceof a central unresolved object tracing the putative x-ray emitting agn. usingboth the r-k colors and the morphological information, we have estimated forall the sources a ``minimum photometric redshift'', ranging between 0.8 and2.4; the elliptical hosts have zmin=0.9-1.4. we computed the x-ray propertiesusing these redshifts: most of the sources have nh&gt;10^{22}, with unabsorbedx-ray luminosities up to 10^{45}erg s^{-1}. these objects therefore belong tothe population of obscured (type ii) quasars and, from a statistical point ofview, they turn out to be a non-negligible fraction (~10%) of the most luminousagn. selecting the high x/o sources for a follow-up study in the nir istherefore a powerful technique aimed at studying at high redshift the hosts oftype ii agn. overall, our results seem to indicate that the hosts are mostlyelliptical galaxies at z~1, and that these near-ir bright objects would beamong the most massive spheroids at these epochs.

astro-ph;0404044	the hellas2xmm survey: vi. x-ray absorption in the 1dfagn sample through  a spectral analysis	the spectroscopic analysis of 117 serendipitous sources in the hellas2xmm 1df(1 degree field) survey is described. of these, 106 sources, of which 86% havea spectroscopic redshift, are used to evaluate the fraction of x-ray absorbed(log nh&gt;22) active galactic nuclei (agn) in the 2--10 kev flux range 0.8-20e-14erg/cm2/s. this fraction turns out lower than what is predicted by two wellknown cosmic x-ray background synthesis models, and the discrepancy issignificant at the 99.999% level. this result consolidates the findingsrecently obtained by other authors. in the flux interval explored, the data areconsistent with an intrinsic distribution of the absorbing columns (flat perdecade above lognh&gt;21) independent of luminosity and redshift, together with anagn luminosity function evolving purely in luminosity. it is shown that, on theother hand, extrapolation to lower fluxes fails to reproduce the resultsinferred from the chandra deep field north survey. it is found that about 40%of the high luminosity sources in our sample have best fit lognh&gt;22, and thesurface density of these x-ray obscured qsos can then be estimated at about 48per square degree, at the flux limit of ~1e-14} erg/cm2/s of the hellas2xmm 1dfsurvey. as a side issue, 5 or 6 out of 60 sources, that is about 10%,identified with broad line agn, turn out to be affected by lognh&gt;22 absorption.

astro-ph;0603388	evidence for t tauri-like emission in the exor v1118 ori from near-ir  and x-ray data	we present a near-ir study of the exor variable v1118 ori, performed byfollowing a slightly declining phase after a recent outburst. in particular,the near-ir (0.8 - 2.3 micron) spectrum, obtained for the first time, shows alarge variety of emission features of the hi and hei recombination and coovertone. by comparing the observed spectrum with a wind model, a mass lossrate value is derived along with other parameters whose values are typical ofan accreting t tauri star. in addition, we have used x-ray data from the xmmarchive, taken in two different epochs during the declining phase monitored inir. x-ray emission (in the range 0.5 - 10 kev) permits to derive severalparameters which confirm the t tauri nature of the source. in the near-ir theobject maintains a low visual extinction during all the activity phases,confirming that variable extinction does not contribute to brightnessvariations. the lack of both a significant amount of circumstellar material andany evidence of ir cooling from collimated jet/outflow driven by the source,indicates that, at least this member of the exor class, is in a late stage ofthe pre-main sequence evolution. in the x-ray regime, an evident fading ispresent, detected in the post-outburst phase, that cannot be reconciled withthe presence of any absorbing material. this circumstance, combined with thepersistence (in the pre- and post-outburst phases) of a temperature componentat about 10 mk, suggests that accretion has some influence in regulating thecoronal activity.
