0904.3333	the dual origin of stellar halos	we investigate the formation of the stellar halos of four simulated diskgalaxies using high resolution, cosmological sph + n-body simulations. thesesimulations include a self-consistent treatment of all the major physicalprocesses involved in galaxy formation. the simulated galaxies presented hereeach have a total mass of ~10^12 m_sun, but span a range of merger histories.these simulations allow us to study the competing importance of in-situ starformation (stars formed in the primary galaxy) and accretion of stars fromsubhalos in the building of stellar halos in a lambdacdm universe. all foursimulated galaxies are surrounded by a stellar halo, whose inner regions (r &lt;20 kpc) contain both accreted stars, and an in-situ stellar population. theouter regions of the galaxies' halos were assembled through pure accretion anddisruption of satellites. most of the in-situ halo stars formed at highredshift out of smoothly accreted cold gas in the inner 1 kpc of the galaxies'potential wells, possibly as part of their primordial disks. these stars weredisplaced from their central locations into the halos through a succession ofmajor mergers. we find that the two galaxies with recently quiescent mergerhistories have a higher fraction of in-situ stars (~20-50%) in their innerhalos than the two galaxies with many recent mergers (~5-10% in-situ fraction).observational studies concentrating on stellar populations in the inner halo ofthe milky way will be the most affected by the presence of in-situ stars withhalo kinematics, as we find that their existence in the inner few tens of kpcis a generic feature of galaxy formation.

0905.3737	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst) is a systematic survey toestablish a legacy of uniform multi-color photometry of resolved stars for avolume-limited sample of nearby galaxies (d&lt;4 mpc). the survey volumeencompasses 69 galaxies in diverse environments, including close pairs, small &amp;large groups, filaments, and truly isolated regions. the galaxies include anearly complete range of morphological types spanning a factor of ~10^4 inluminosity and star formation rate. the survey data consists of images takenwith acs on hst, supplemented with archival data and new wfpc2 imaging takenafter the failure of acs. survey images include wide field tilings covering thefull radial extent of each galaxy, and single deep pointings in uncrowdedregions of the most massive galaxies in the volume. the new wide field imagingin angst reaches median 50% completenesses of m_f475w=28.0 mag, m_f606w=27.3mag, and m_f814w=27.3 mag, several magnitudes below the tip of the red giantbranch (trgb). the deep fields reach magnitudes sufficient to fully resolve thestructure in the red clump. the resulting photometric catalogs are publiclyaccessible and contain over 34 million photometric measurements of &gt;14 millionstars. in this paper we present the details of the sample selection, imaging,data reduction, and the resulting photometric catalogs, along with an analysisof the photometric uncertainties (systematic and random), for both the acs andwfpc2 imaging. we also present uniformly derived relative distances measuredfrom the apparent magnitude of the trgb.

0909.1321	the nature of hi absorbers in grb afterglows: clues from hydrodynamic  simulations	in recent work, we have shown that it is possible to link quantitatively manyaspects of damped lyman alpha (dla) absorbers in the spectra of quasars to highresolution simulations of galaxy formation. using runs from the same series ofhydrodynamic numerical studies, we consider the expected properties of lymanalpha absorbers seen in the spectra of high redshift (z&gt;2) gamma ray burstafterglows (grb-dlas). if grbs are associated with the death of massive stars,their afterglows provide insights into otherwise unprobed regions ofprotogalactic objects, but detailed physical interpretations are currentlyembryonic.  we find that median impact parameters (measured from the potential minimum)are approximately 1 kpc for grbs compared with 4 kpc for qso-dlas. however, anequally important difference is that grb-dlas are predominantly associated withhalos of mass 10^10&lt;m_vir/m_sol&lt;10^12, an order of magnitude larger than thehosts of qso-dlas. accordingly, there are differences in the stellar propertiesof hosts.  our simulations accurately predict the form of the grb-dla hi column densitydistribution, producing quantitative agreement for n_hi&gt;10^19 cm^-2, but theysomewhat underpredict the incidence of low column densities n_hi&lt;10^19 cm^-2.line-of-sight neutral gas metallicities predicted by our simulations (10^-2 &lt;z/z_sol &lt; 1) are consistent with the modest observational constraints. becauseof large internal dispersions in gas metallicities, this agreement is notsignificantly compromised by imposing a cut-off on the metallicity of starsable to launch grbs (z_star&lt;z_sol/3), confounding claims that the observedmetallicity of grb-dlas poses a challenge to current grb models.

0911.2237	at the heart of the matter: the origin of bulgeless dwarf galaxies and  dark matter cores	for almost two decades the properties of "dwarf" galaxies have challenged thecold dark matter (cdm) paradigm of galaxy formation. most observed dwarfgalaxies consists of a rotating stellar disc embedded in a massive dm halo witha near constant-density core. yet, models based on the cdm scenario invariablyform galaxies with dense spheroidal stellar "bulges" and steep central dmprofiles, as low angular momentum baryons and dm sink to the center of galaxiesthrough accretion and repeated mergers. processes that decrease the centraldensity of cdm halos have been identified, but have not yet reconciled theorywith observations of present day dwarfs. this failure is potentiallycatastrophic for the cdm model, possibly requiring a different dm particlecandidate. this letter presents new hydrodynamical simulations in a lambda$cdmframework where analogues of dwarf galaxies, bulgeless and with a shallowcentral dm profile, are formed. this is achieved by resolving the inhomogeneousinterstellar medium, resulting in strong outflows from supernovae explosionswhich remove low angular momentum gas. this inhibits the formation of bulgesand decreases the dark-matter density to less than half within the centralkiloparsec. realistic dwarf galaxies are thus shown to be a natural outcome ofgalaxy formation in the cdm scenario.

1004.3789	the dual origin of stellar halos ii: chemical abundances as tracers of  formation history	fully cosmological, high resolution n-body + sph simulations are used toinvestigate the chemical abundance trends of stars in simulated stellar halosas a function of their origin. these simulations employ a physically motivatedsupernova feedback recipe, as well as metal enrichment, metal cooling and metaldiffusion. as presented in an earlier paper, the simulated galaxies in thisstudy are surrounded by stellar halos whose inner regions contain both starsaccreted from satellite galaxies and stars formed in situ in the centralregions of the main galaxies and later displaced by mergers into their innerhalos. the abundance patterns ([fe/h] and [o/fe]) of halo stars located within10 kpc of a solar-like observer are analyzed. we find that for galaxies whichhave not experienced a recent major merger, in situ stars at the high [fe/h]end of the metallicity distribution function are more [alpha/fe]-rich thanaccreted stars at similar [fe/h]. this dichotomy in the [o/fe] of halo stars ata given [fe/h] results from the different potential wells within which in situand accreted halo stars form. these results qualitatively match recentobservations of local milky way halo stars. it may thus be possible forobservers to uncover the relative contribution of different physical processesto the formation of stellar halos by observing such trends in the halopopulations of the milky way, and other local l* galaxies.

1006.1659	misaligned angular momentum in hydrodynamic cosmological simulations:  warps, outer discs, and thick discs	we present a detailed analysis of a disc galaxy forming in a high-resolutionfully cosmological simulation to investigate the nature of the outer regions ofdiscs and their relevance for the disc formation process. specifically, wefocus on the phenomenon of misaligned disc components and find that the outerdisc warp is a consequence of the misalignment between the inner disc and thesurrounding hot gaseous halo. as the infalling cold gas sinks toward the centreof the galaxy, it is strongly torqued by the hot gas halo. by the time thefresh gas reaches the central disc-forming region its angular momentum iscompletely aligned with the spin of the hot gas halo. if the spin of the hotgas halo, in turn, is not aligned with that of the inner disc, a misalignedouter disc forms comprised of newly accreted material. the inner and outercomponents are misaligned with each other because they respond differently toinfalling substructure and accretion. the warped disc feeds the main gas discdue to viscous angular momentum losses, but small amounts of star formation inthe warp itself form a low-metallicity thick disc. we show that observations ofresolved stellar populations in warped galaxies in the local universe couldprovide evidence for the presence of these processes and therefore indirectlyreveal ongoing gas accretion and the existence of hot gas halos.

1011.0432	interpreting the evolution of the size - luminosity relation for disk  galaxies from redshift 1 to the present	a sample of very high resolution cosmological disk galaxy simulations is usedto investigate the evolution of galaxy disk sizes back to redshift 1 within thelambda cdm cosmology. artificial images in the rest frame b band are generated,allowing for a measurement of disk scale lengths using surface brightnessprofiles as observations would, and avoiding any assumption that light mustfollow mass as previous models have assumed. we demonstrate that thesesimulated disks are an excellent match to the observed magnitude - sizerelation for both local disks, and for disks at z=1 in the magnitude/mass rangeof overlap. we disentangle the evolution seen in the population as a whole fromthe evolution of individual disk galaxies. in agreement with observations, oursimulated disks undergo roughly 1.5 magnitudes/arcsec^2 of surface brightnessdimming since z=1. we find evidence that evolution in the magnitude - sizeplane varies by mass, such that galaxies with m* &gt; 10^9 m_sun undergo moreevolution in size than luminosity, while dwarf galaxies tend to evolvepotentially more in luminosity. the disks grow in such a way as to stay onroughly the same stellar mass - size relation with time. finally, due to anevolving stellar mass - sfr relation, a galaxy at a given stellar mass (orsize) at z=1 will reside in a more massive halo and have a higher sfr, and thusa higher luminosity, than a counterpart of the same stellar mass at z=0.

1011.2777	the central slope of dark matter cores in dwarf galaxies: simulations  vs. things	we make a direct comparison of the derived dark matter (dm) distributionsbetween hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies assuming a lcdm cosmologyand the observed dwarf galaxies sample from the things survey in terms of (1)the rotation curve shape and (2) the logarithmic inner density slope alpha ofmass density profiles. the simulations, which include the effect of baryonicfeedback processes, such as gas cooling, star formation, cosmic uv backgroundheating and most importantly physically motivated gas outflows driven bysupernovae (sne), form bulgeless galaxies with dm cores. we show that thestellar and baryonic mass is similar to that inferred from photometric andkinematic methods for galaxies of similar circular velocity. analyzing thesimulations in exactly the same way as the observational sample allows us toaddress directly the so-called "cusp/core" problem in the lcdm model. we showthat the rotation curves of the simulated dwarf galaxies rise less steeply thancdm rotation curves and are consistent with those of the things dwarf galaxies.the mean value of the logarithmic inner density slopes alpha of the simulatedgalaxies' dark matter density profiles is ~ -0.4 +- 0.1, which shows goodagreement with \alpha = -0.29 +- 0.07 of the things dwarf galaxies. the effectof non-circular motions is not significant enough to affect the results. thisconfirms that the baryonic feedback processes included in the simulations areefficiently able to make the initial cusps with \alpha ~ -1.0 to -1.5 predictedby dark-matter-only simulations shallower, and induce dm halos with a centralmass distribution similar to that observed in nearby dwarf galaxies.

1104.2037	disc heating: comparing the milky way with cosmological simulations	we present the analysis of a suite of simulations run with differentparticle-and grid-based cosmological hydrodynamical codes and compare them withobservational data of the milky way. this is the first study to makecomparisons of properties of galaxies simulated with particle and grid-basedcodes. our analysis indicates that there is broad agreement between thesedifferent modelling techniques. we study the velocity dispersion - age relationfor disc stars at z=0 and find that four of the simulations are more consistentwith observations by holmberg et al. (2008) in which the stellar disc appearsto undergo continual/secular heating. two other simulations are in betteragreement with the quillen &amp; garnett (2001) observations that suggest a"saturation" in the heating profile for young stars in the disc. none of thesimulations have thin discs as old as that of the milky way. we also analysethe kinematics of disc stars at the time of their birth for different epochs inthe galaxies' evolution and find that in some simulations old stars are borncold within the disc and are subsequently heated, while other simulationspossess old stellar populations which are born relatively hot. the models whichare in better agreement with observations of the milky way's stellar discundergo significantly lower minor-merger/assembly activity after the last majormerger - i.e. once the disc has formed. all of the simulations aresignificantly "hotter" than the milky way disc; on top of the effects ofmergers, we find a "floor" in the dispersion that is related to the underlyingtreatment of the heating and cooling of the interstellar medium, and the lowdensity threshold which such codes use for star formation. this finding hasimportant implications for all studies of disc heating that use hydrodynamicalcodes.

1104.3858	the first massive black hole seeds and their hosts	we investigate the formation of the first massive black holes in highredshift galaxies, with the goal of providing insights to which galaxies do ordo not host massive black holes. we adopt a novel approach to forming seedblack holes in galaxy halos in cosmological sph+n-body simulations. theformation of massive black hole seeds is dictated directly by the local gasdensity, temperature, and metallicity, and motivated by physical models ofmassive black hole formation. we explore seed black hole populations as afunction of halo mass and redshift, and examine how varying the efficiency ofmassive black hole seed formation affects the relationship between black holesand their hosts. seed black holes tend to form in halos with mass between 10^7and 10^9 msun, and the formation rate is suppressed around z = 5 due to thediffusion of metals throughout the intergalactic medium. we find that the timeof massive black hole formation and the occupation fraction of black holes area function of the host halo mass. by z = 5, halos with mass m_halo &gt; 3 x 10^9msun host massive black holes regardless of the efficiency of seed formation,while the occupation fraction for smaller halos increases with black holeformation efficiency. our simulations explain why massive black holes are foundin some bulgeless and dwarf galaxies, but we also predict that their occurrencebecomes rarer and rarer in low-mass systems.

1106.0499	how supernova feedback turns dark matter cusps into cores	we propose and successfully test against new cosmological simulations a novelanalytical description of the physical processes associated with the origin ofcored dark matter density profiles. in the simulations, the potential in thecentral kiloparsec changes on sub-dynamical timescales over the redshiftinterval 4 &gt; z &gt; 2 as repeated, energetic feedback generates large underdensebubbles of expanding gas from centrally-concentrated bursts of star formation.the model demonstrates how fluctuations in the central potential irreversiblytransfer energy into collisionless particles, thus generating a dark mattercore. a supply of gas undergoing collapse and rapid expansion is therefore theessential ingredient. the framework, based on a novel impulsive approximation,breaks with the reliance on adiabatic approximations which are inappropriate inthe rapidly-changing limit. it shows that both outflows and galactic fountainscan give rise to cusp-flattening, even when only a few per cent of the baryonsform stars. dwarf galaxies maintain their core to the present time. the modelsuggests that constant density dark matter cores will be generated in systemsof a wide mass range if central starbursts or agn phases are sufficientlyfrequent and energetic.

1205.5567	implementing molecular hydrogen in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy  formation	motivated by the observed connection between molecular hydrogen (h2) and starformation, we present a method for tracking the non-equilibrium abundance andcooling processes of h2 and h2-based star formation in smoothed particlehydrodynamic simulations. the local abundances of h2 are calculated byintegrating over the hydrogen chemical network. this calculation includes thegas-phase and dust grain formation of h2, shielding of hi and h2, andphotodissociation of h2 by lyman-werner radiation from nearby stellarpopulations. because this model does not assume equilibrium abundances, it isparticularly well suited for simulations that model low-metallicityenvironments, such as dwarf galaxies and the early universe. we furtherintroduce an explicit link between star formation and local h2 abundance. thislink limits star formation to "star-forming regions," represented by areas withabundant h2.  with this implementation, we determine the effect of h2 on star formation ina cosmological simulation of a dwarf galaxy. this simulation is the firstcosmological simulation with non-equilibrium h2 abundances to be integrated toa redshift of zero or to include efficient sn feedback. we find that oursimulations are consistent with the observed tully-fisher, globalkennicutt-schmidt, and resolved kennicutt-schmidt relations. we find that theinclusion of shielding of both the atomic and molecular hydrogen and, to alesser extent, the additional cooling from h2 at temperatures between 200 and5000 k increases the amount of cold gas in the galaxies. the changes to the ismresult in an increased amount of cold, dense gas in the disk of the galaxy andthe formation of a clumpier interstellar media (ism). the explicit link betweenstar formation and h2 and the clumpier ism results in a bluer galaxy with agreater spatial distribution of star formation at a redshift of zero.(abridged)

1207.0007	baryons matter: why luminous satellite galaxies have reduced central  masses	using high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of milkyway-massed disk galaxies, we demonstrate that supernovae feedback and tidalstripping lower the central masses of bright (-15 &lt; m_v &lt; -8) satellitegalaxies. these simulations resolve high density regions, comparable to giantmolecular clouds, where stars form. this resolution allows us to adopt aprescription for h_2 formation and destruction that ties star formation to thepresence of shielded, molecular gas. before infall, supernova feedback from theclumpy, bursty star formation captured by this physically motivated model leadsto reduced dark matter (dm) densities and shallower inner density profiles inthe massive satellite progenitors (mvir &gt; 10^9 msun, mstar &gt; 10^7 msun)compared to dm-only simulations. the progenitors of the lower mass satellitesare unable to maintain bursty star formation histories, due to both heating atreionization and gas loss from initial star forming events, preserving thesteep inner density profile predicted by dm-only simulations. after infall,tidal stripping acts to further reduce the central densities of the luminoussatellites, particularly those that enter with cored dark matter halos,increasing the discrepancy in the central masses predicted by baryon+dm anddm-only simulations. we show that dm-only simulations, which neglect thebaryonic effects described in this work, produce denser satellites with largercentral velocities. we provide a simple correction to the central dm masspredicted for satellites by dm-only simulations. we conclude that dm-onlysimulations should be used with great caution when interpreting kinematicobservations of the milky way's dwarf satellites.

1209.2708	constraints on the shape of the milky way dark matter halo from jeans  equations applied to sdss data	we search for evidence of dark matter in the milky way by utilizing thestellar number density distribution and kinematics measured by the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) to heliocentric distances exceeding ~10 kpc. weemploy the cylindrically symmetric form of jeans equations and focus on themorphology of the resulting acceleration maps, rather than the normalization ofthe total mass as done in previous, mostly local, studies. jeans equations arefirst applied to a mock catalog based on a cosmologically derived n-body + sphsimulation, and the known acceleration (gradient of gravitational potential) issuccessfully recovered. the same simulation is also used to quantify the impactof dark matter on the total acceleration. we use galfast, a code designed toquantitatively reproduce sdss measurements and selection effects, to generate asynthetic stellar catalog. we apply jeans equations to this catalog and producetwo-dimensional maps of stellar acceleration. these maps reveal that in anewtonian framework, the implied gravitational potential cannot be explained byvisible matter alone. the acceleration experienced by stars at galactocentricdistances of ~20 kpc is three times larger than what can be explained by purelyvisible matter. the application of an analytic method for estimating the darkmatter halo axis ratio to sdss data implies an oblate halo with q_dm = 0.47 +/-0.14 within the same distance range. these techniques can be used to map thedark matter halo to much larger distances from the galactic center usingupcoming deep optical surveys, such as lsst.

1211.0326	the effect of models of the interstellar media on the central mass  distribution of galaxies	we compare the central mass distribution of galaxies simulated with threedifferent models of the interstellar medium (ism) with increasing complexity:primordial (h+he) cooling down to 10^4k, additional cooling via metal lines andto lower temperatures, and molecular hydrogen (h_2) with shielding of atomicand molecular hydrogen, in addition to metal line cooling. in order to analyzethe effect of these models, we follow the evolution of four field galaxies withv_peak &lt; 120 km/s to a redshift of zero using high-resolution smoothed particlehydrodynamic simulations in a fully cosmological lcdm context. the spiralgalaxies produced in simulations with either primordial cooling or h_2 physicshave realistic, rising rotation curves. in contrast, the simulations with metalline cooling and otherwise similar feedback and star formation producedgalaxies with the peaked rotation curves typical of most previous lcdmsimulations of spiral galaxies. the less-massive bulges and non-peaked rotationcurves in the galaxies simulated with primordial cooling or h_2 are linked tochanges in the angular momentum distribution of the baryons. these galaxies hadsmaller amounts of low-angular momentum baryons because of increased gas lossfrom stellar feedback. when there is only primordial cooling, the star forminggas is hotter and the feedback-heated gas cools more slowly than when metalline cooling is included and so requires less energy to be expelled. when h_2is included, the accompanying shielding produces large amounts of clumpy, coldgas where h_2 forms. star formation in clumpy gas results in more concentratedsupernova feedback and greater efficiency of mass loss. the higher feedbackefficiency causes a decrease of low-angular momentum material.

1306.0913	cold dark matter: controversies on small scales	the cold dark matter (cdm) cosmological model has been remarkably successfulin explaining cosmic structure over an enormous span of redshift, but it hasfaced persistent challenges from observations that probe the innermost regionsof dark matter halos and the properties of the milky way's dwarf galaxysatellites. we review the current observational and theoretical status of these"small scale controversies." cosmological simulations that incorporate onlygravity and collisionless cdm predict halos with abundant substructure andcentral densities that are too high to match constraints from galaxy dynamics.the solution could lie in baryonic physics: recent numerical simulations andanalytic models suggest that gravitational potential fluctuations tied toefficient supernova feedback can flatten the central cusps of halos in massivegalaxies, and a combination of feedback and low star-formation efficiency couldexplain why most of the dark matter subhalos orbiting the milky way do not hostvisible galaxies. however, it is not clear that this solution can work in thelowest mass galaxies where discrepancies are observed. alternatively, thesmall-scale conflicts could be evidence of more complex physics in the darksector itself. for example, elastic scattering from strong dark matterself-interactions can alter predicted halo mass profiles, leading to goodagreement with observations across a wide range of galaxy mass. gravitationallensing and dynamical perturbations of tidal streams in the stellar haloprovide evidence for an abundant population of low mass subhalos in accord withcdm predictions. these observational approaches will get more powerful over thenext few years.

1307.0856	the relative role of galaxy mergers and cosmic flows in feeding black  holes	using a set of zoomed-in cosmological simulations of high-redshiftprogenitors of massive galaxies, we isolate and trace the history of gas thatis accreted by central supermassive black holes. we determine the origins ofthe accreted gas, in terms of whether it entered the galaxy during a mergerevent or was smoothly accreted. furthermore, we designate whether the smoothlyaccreted gas is accreted via a cold flow or is shocked upon entry into thehalo. for moderate-mass (10^6 - 10^7 msun) black holes at z ~ 4, there is apreference to accrete cold flow gas than gas of shocked or merger origin.however, this result is a consequence of the fact that the entire galaxy has ahigher fraction of gas from cold flows. in general, each black hole tends toaccrete the same fractions of smooth- and merger-accreted gas as is containedin its host galaxy, suggesting that once gas enters a halo it becomeswell-mixed, and its origins are erased. we find that the angular momentum ofthe gas upon halo entry is a more important factor; black holes preferentiallyaccrete gas that had low angular momentum when it entered the galaxy,regardless of whether it was accreted smoothly or through mergers.

0801.3845	the formation of disk galaxies in computer simulations	the formation of disk galaxies is one of the most outstanding problems inmodern astrophysics and cosmology. we review the progress made by numericalsimulations carried out on large parallel supercomputers. recent progress stemsfrom a combination of increased resolution and improved treatment of theastrophysical processes modeled in the simulations, such as thephenomenological description of the interstellar medium and of the process ofstar formation. high mass and spatial resolution is a necessary condition inorder to obtain large disks comparable with observed spiral galaxies avoidingspurious dissipation of angular momentum. a realistic model of the starformation history. gas-to-stars ratio and the morphology of the stellar andgaseous component is instead controlled by the phenomenological description ofthe non-gravitational energy budget in the galaxy. we show that simulations ofgas collapse within cold dark matter halos including a phenomenologicaldescription of supernovae blast-waves allow to obtain stellar disks with nearlyexponential surface density profiles as those observed in real disk galaxies,counteracting the tendency of gas collapsing in such halos to form cuspybaryonic profiles. however, the ab-initio formation of a realistic rotationallysupported disk galaxy with a pure exponential disk in a fully cosmologicalsimulation is still an open problem. we argue that the suppression of bulgeformation is related to the physics of galaxy formation during the merger ofthe most massive protogalactic lumps at high redshift, where the reionizationof the universe likely plays a key role. a sufficiently high resolution duringthis early phase of galaxy formation is also crucial to avoid artificialangular momentum loss (abridged).

1310.7581	nuclear coups: dynamics of black holes in galaxy mergers	we study the dynamical evolution of supermassive black holes (bhs) in merginggalaxies on scales of hundreds of kpc to 10 pc, to identify the physicalprocesses that aid or hinder the orbital decay of bhs. we presenthydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers with a resolution of $\leq$20 pc,chosen to accurately track the motion of the nuclei and provide a realisticenvironment for the evolution of the bhs. we find that, during the late stagesof the merger, tidal shocks inject energy in the nuclei, causing one or bothnuclei to be disrupted and leaving their bh `naked', without any bound gas orstars. in many cases, the nucleus that is ultimately disrupted is that of thelarger galaxy (`nuclear coup'), as star formation grows a denser nuclear cuspin the smaller galaxy. we supplement our simulations with an analyticalestimate of the orbital-decay time required for the bhs to form a binary atunresolved scales, due to dynamical friction. we find that, when a nuclear coupoccurs, the time-scale is much shorter than when the secondary's nucleus isdisrupted, as the infalling bh is more massive, and it also finds itself in adenser stellar environment.

1312.1700	the pressure of the star forming ism in cosmological simulations	we examine the pressure of the star-forming interstellar medium (ism) ofmilky-way sized disk galaxies using fully cosmological sph+n-body, highresolution simulations. these simulations include explicit treatment ofmetal-line cooling in addition to dust and self-shielding, $\mathrm{h_{2}}$based star formation. the 4 simulated halos have masses ranging from a fewtimes $10^{10}$ to nearly $10^{12}$ solar masses. using a kinematicdecomposition of these galaxies into present-day bulge and disk components, wefind that the typical pressure of the star-forming ism in the present-day bulgeis higher than that in the present-day disk by an order of magnitude. we alsofind that pressure of the star-forming ism at high redshift is on average,higher than ism pressures at low redshift. this explains the why the bulgeforms at higher pressures: the disk assembles at lower redshift, when the ismis lower pressure and the bulge forms at high redshift, when the ism is athigher pressure. if ism pressure and imf variation are tied together assuggested in studies like \cite{conroy2012}, these results could indicate atime-dependent imf in milky-way like systems, as well as a different imf in thebulge and the disk.

1405.0286	effects of inclination on measuring velocity dispersion and implications  for black holes	the relation of central black hole mass and stellar spheroid velocitydispersion (the m-$\sigma$ relation) is one of the best-known and tightestcorrelations linking black holes and their host galaxies. there has been muchscrutiny concerning the difficulty of obtaining accurate black holemeasurements, and rightly so; however, it has been taken for granted thatmeasurements of velocity dispersion are essentially straightforward. we examinefive disk galaxies from cosmological sph simulations and find thatline-of-sight effects due to galaxy orientation can affect the measured$\sigma$ by 30%, and consequently black hole mass predictions by up to 1.0 dex.face-on orientations correspond to systematically lower velocity dispersionmeasurements, while more edge-on orientations give higher velocity dispersions,due to contamination by disk stars when measuring line of sight quantities. wecaution observers that the uncertainty of velocity dispersion measurements isat least 20 km/s, and can be much larger for moderate inclinations. this effectmay account for some of the scatter in the locally measured m-$\sigma$relation, particularly at the low-mass end. we provide a method for correctingobserved $\sigma_{\rm los}$ values for inclination effects based on observablequantities.

1405.2577	dark matter heating and early core formation in dwarf galaxies	we present more results from a fully cosmological lcdm simulation of a groupof isolated dwarf galaxies that has been shown to reproduce the observedstellar mass and cold gas content, resolved star formation histories, andmetallicities of dwarfs in the local volume. here we investigate the energeticsand timetable of the cusp-core transformation. as suggested by previous work,supernova-driven gas outflows remove dark matter (dm) cusps and create kpc-sizecores in all systems having a stellar mass above 1e6 msun. the "dm core massremoval efficiency" -- dark mass ejected per unit stellar mass -- ranges todayfrom a few to a dozen, and increases with decreasing host mass. because dwarfsform the bulk of their stars prior to redshift 1 and the amount of workrequired for dm heating and core formation scales approximately as mvir^{5/3},the unbinding of the dm cusp starts early and the formation of cored profilesis not as energetically onerous as previously claimed. dm particles in the cusptypically migrate to 2-3 core radii after absorbing a few percent of the energyreleased by supernovae. the present-day slopes of the inner dark matter massprofiles, gamma=d log m/dlog r=2.5-3, of the simulated "bashful" and "doc"dwarfs are similar to those measured in the luminous fornax and sculptor dwarfspheroidals. none of the simulated galaxies has a circular velocity profileexceeding 20 km/s in the inner 1 kpc, implying that supernova feedback is keyto solve the "too-big-to-fail" problem for milky way subhalos.

1406.5187	kinematic evolution of simulated star-forming galaxies	recent observations have shown that star-forming galaxies like our own milkyway evolve kinematically into ordered thin disks over the last ~8 billion yearssince z=1.2, undergoing a process of "disk settling." for the first time, westudy the kinematic evolution of a suite of four state of the art "zoom in"hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation and evolution in a fullycosmological context and compare with these observations. until now, robustmeasurements of the internal kinematics of simulated galaxies were lacking asthe simulations suffered from low resolution, overproduction of stars, andoverly massive bulges. the current generation of simulations has made greatprogress in overcoming these difficulties and is ready for a kinematicanalysis. we show that simulated galaxies follow the same kinematic trends asreal galaxies: they progressively decrease in disordered motions (sigma_g) andincrease in ordered rotation (vrot) with time. the slopes of the relationsbetween both sigma_g and vrot with redshift are consistent between thesimulations and the observations. in addition, the morphologies of thesimulated galaxies become less disturbed with time, also consistent withobservations, and they both have similarly large scatter. this match betweenthe simulated and observed trends is a significant success for the currentgeneration of simulations, and a first step in determining the physicalprocesses behind disk settling.

1407.0022	faint dwarfs as a test of dm models: wdm vs. cdm	we use high resolution hydro$+$n-body cosmological simulations to compare theassembly and evolution of a small field dwarf (stellar mass ~ 10$^{6-7}$m$\odot$, total mass 10$^{10}$ m$\odot$ in $\lambda$ dominated cdm and 2kev wdmcosmologies. we find that star formation (sf) in the wdm model is reduced anddelayed by 1-2 gyr relative to the cdm model, independently of the details ofsf and feedback. independent of the dm model, but proportionally to the sfefficiency, gas outflows lower the central mass density through `dynamicalheating', such that all realizations have circular velocities $&lt;$ 20kms at500$~$pc, in agreement with local kinematic constraints. as a result ofdynamical heating, older stars are less centrally concentrated than youngerstars, similar to stellar population gradients observed in nearby dwarfgalaxies. introducing an important diagnostic of sf and feedback models, wetranslate our simulations into artificial color-magnitude diagrams and starformation histories in order to directly compare to available observations. thesimulated galaxies formed most of their stars in many $\sim$10 myr long bursts.the cdm galaxy has a global sfh, hi abundance and fe/h and alpha-elementsdistribution well matched to current observations of dwarf galaxies. theseresults highlight the importance of directly including `baryon physics' insimulations when 1) comparing predictions of galaxy formation models with thekinematics and number density of local dwarf galaxies and 2) differentiatingbetween cdm and non-standard models with different dm or power spectra.

1408.5388	the milky way tomography with sdss. v. mapping the dark matter halo	we present robust constraints from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) on theshape and distribution of the dark matter halo within the milky way (mw). usingthe number density distribution and kinematics of sdss halo stars, we probe thedark matter distribution to heliocentric distances exceeding 10 kpc andgalactocentric distances exceeding 20 kpc. our analysis utilizes jeansequations to generate two-dimensional acceleration maps throughout the volume;this approach is thoroughly tested on a cosmologically derived n-body+sphsimulation of a mw-like galaxy. we show that the known accelerations (gradientsof the gravitational potential) can be successfully recovered in such arealistic system. leveraging the baryonic gravitational potential derived bybovy &amp; rix (2013), we show that the gravitational potential implied by the sdssobservations cannot be explained, assuming newtonian gravity, by visible matteralone: the gravitational force experienced by stars at galactocentric distancesof 20 kpc is as much as three times stronger than what can be attributed topurely visible matter. we also show that the sdss data provide a strongconstraint on the shape of the dark matter halo potential. withingalactocentric distances of 20 kpc, the dark matter halo potential is welldescribed as an oblate halo with axis ratio qdm=0.7+/-0.1; this corresponds toan axis ratio qdm=0.4+/-0.1 for the dark matter density distribution. becauseof our precise two-dimensional measurements of the acceleration of the halostars, we can reject several mond models as an explanation of the observedbehavior.

(i) we address the question of when andwhy, during a merger, increased bh accretion occurs, quantifying gas inflowsand bh accretion rates. (ii) we also quantify the relative effectiveness ininducing agn activity of merger-related versus secular-related causes, bystudying different stages of the encounter: the stochastic (or early) stage,the (proper) merger stage, and the remnant (or late) stage. (iii) we assesswhich galaxy mergers preferentially enhance bh accretion, finding that theinitial mass ratio is the most important factor. (iv) we study the evolution ofthe bh masses, finding that the bh mass contrast tends to decrease in minormergers and to increase in major mergers. this effect hints at the existence ofa preferential range of mass ratios for bhs in the final pairing stages.

(ii) bhar andnuclear sfr are intrinsically proportional, but the correlation lessens if thelong-term sfr is measured. (iii) galaxies in the remnant phase are the onesmost likely to be selected as systems dominated by an active galactic nucleus(agn), because of the long time spent in this phase.

1502.07076	black hole accretion versus star formation rate: theory confronts  observations	we use a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers to comparestar formation rate (sfr) and black hole accretion rate (bhar) for galaxiesbefore the interaction ('stochastic' phase), during the `merger' proper,lasting ~0.2-0.3 gyr, and in the `remnant' phase. we calculate the bi-variatedistribution of sfr and bhar and define the regions in the sfr-bhar plane thatthe three phases occupy. no strong correlation between bhar and galaxy-wide sfris found. a possible exception are galaxies with the highest sfr and thehighest bhar. we also bin the data in the same way used in severalobservational studies, by either measuring the mean sfr for agn in differentluminosity bins, or the mean bhar for galaxies in bins of sfr. we find that theapparent contradiction or sfr versus bhar for observed samples of agn and starforming galaxies is actually caused by binning effects. the two types ofsamples use different projections of the full bi-variate distribution, and thefull information would lead to unambiguous interpretation. we also find that agalaxy can be classified as agn-dominated up to 1.5 gyr after the merger-drivenstarburst took place. our study is consistent with the suggestion that mostlow-luminosity agn hosts do not show morphological disturbances.

1502.07356	milking the spherical cow: on aspherical dynamics in spherical  coordinates	galaxies and the dark matter halos that host them are not sphericallysymmetric, yet spherical symmetry is a helpful simplifying approximation foridealised calculations and analysis of observational data. the assumption leadsto an exact conservation of angular momentum for every particle, making thedynamics unrealistic. but how much does that inaccuracy matter in practice foranalyses of stellar distribution functions, collisionless relaxation, or darkmatter core-creation?  we provide a general answer to this question for a wide class of asphericalsystems; specifically, we consider distribution functions that are "maximallystable", i.e. that do not evolve at first order when external potentials (whicharise from baryons, large scale tidal fields or infalling substructure) areapplied. we show that a spherically-symmetric analysis of such systems givesrise to the false conclusion that the density of particles in phase space isergodic (a function of energy alone).  using this idea we are able to demonstrate that: (a) observational analysesthat falsely assume spherical symmetry are made more accurate by imposing astrong prior preference for near-isotropic velocity dispersions in the centreof spheroids; (b) numerical simulations that use an idealisedspherically-symmetric setup can yield misleading results and should be avoidedwhere possible; and (c) triaxial dark matter halos (formed in collisionlesscosmological simulations) nearly attain our maximally-stable limit, but theirevolution freezes out before reaching it.

0804.4474	damped lyman alpha systems in galaxy formation simulations	we investigate the population of z=3 damped lyman alpha absorbers (dlas) in arecent series of high resolution galaxy formation simulations. the simulationsare of interest because they form at z=0 some of the most realistic diskgalaxies to date. no free parameters are available in our study: these havebeen fixed by physical and z=0 observational constraints, and thus our studyprovides a genuine consistency test. the precise role of dlas in galaxyformation remains in debate, but they provide a number of strong constraints onthe nature of our simulated bound systems at z=3 because of their coupledinformation on neutral h i densities, kinematics, metallicity and estimates ofstar formation activity.  our results, without any parameter-tuning, closely match the observedincidence rate and column density distributions of dlas. our simulations arethe first to reproduce the distribution of metallicities (with a median ofz_{dla} = z_{solar}/20) without invoking observationally unsupported mechanismssuch as dust biasing. this is especially encouraging given that thesesimulations have previously been shown to have a realistic 0&lt;z&lt;2 stellarmass-metallicity relation. additionally, we see a strong positive correlationbetween sightline metallicity and low-ion velocity width, the normalization andslope of which comes close to matching recent observational results. however,we somewhat underestimate the number of observed high velocity width systems;the severity of this disagreement is comparable to other recent dla focusedstudies. by z=0 the majority of the z=3 neutral gas forming the dlas has beenconverted into stars, in agreement with rough physical expectations.

1508.00007	in-n-out: the gas cycle from dwarfs to spiral galaxies	we examine the scalings of galactic outflows with halo mass across a suite oftwenty high-resolution cosmological zoom galaxy simulations covering halomasses from 10^9.5 - 10^12 m_sun. these simulations self-consistently generateoutflows from the available supernova energy in a manner that successfullyreproduces key galaxy observables including the stellar mass-halo mass,tully-fisher, and mass-metallicity relations. we quantify the importance ofejective feedback to setting the stellar mass relative to the efficiency of gasaccretion and star formation. ejective feedback is increasingly important asgalaxy mass decreases; we find an effective mass loading factor that scales asv_circ^(-2.2), with an amplitude and shape that is invariant with redshift.these scalings are consistent with analytic models for energy-driven wind,based solely on the halo potential. recycling is common: about half the outflowmass across all galaxy masses is later re-accreted. the recycling timescale istypically about 1 gyr, virtually independent of halo mass. recycled material isre-accreted farther out in the disk and with typically about 2-3 times moreangular momentum. these results elucidate and quantify how the baryon cycleplausibly regulates star formation and alters the angular momentum distributionof disk material across the halo mass range where most of cosmic star formationoccurs.

1508.02224	a comparison of black hole growth in galaxy mergers with gasoline and  ramses	supermassive black hole dynamics during galaxy mergers is crucial indetermining the rate of black hole mergers and cosmic black hole growth. assimulations achieve higher resolution, it becomes important to assess whetherthe black hole dynamics is influenced by the treatment of the interstellarmedium in different simulation codes. we here compare simulations of black holegrowth in galaxy mergers with two codes: the smoothed particle hydrodynamicscode gasoline, and the adaptive mesh refinement code ramses. we seek toidentify predictions of these models that are robust despite differences inhydrodynamic methods and implementations of sub-grid physics. we find that thegeneral behavior is consistent between codes. black hole accretion is minimalwhile the galaxies are well-separated (and even as they "fly-by" within 10 kpcat first pericenter). at late stages, when the galaxies pass within a few kpc,tidal torques drive nuclear gas inflow that triggers bursts of black holeaccretion accompanied by star formation. we also note quantitativediscrepancies that are model-dependent: our ramses simulations show less starformation and black hole growth, and a smoother gas distribution with largerclumps and filaments, than our gasoline simulations. we attribute thesedifferences primarily to the sub-grid models for black hole fueling andfeedback and gas thermodynamics. the main conclusion is that differences existquantitatively between codes, and this should be kept in mind when makingcomparisons with observations. however, reassuringly, both codes capture thesame dynamical behaviors in terms of triggering of black hole accretion, starformation, and black hole dynamics.

astro-ph;0011041	tidal stirring and the origin of dwarf spheroidals in the local group	n-body/sph simulations are used to study the evolution of dwarf irregulargalaxies (dirrs) entering the dark matter halo of the milky way or m31 onplunging orbits. we propose a new dynamical mechanism driving the evolution ofgas rich, rotationally supported dirrs, mostly found at the outskirts of thelocal group (lg), into gas free, pressure supported dwarf spheroidals (dsphs)or dwarf ellipticals (des), observed to cluster around the two giant spirals.the initial model galaxies are exponential disks embedded in massive darkmatter halos and reproduce nearby dirrs. repeated tidal shocks at thepericenter of their orbit partially strip their halo and disk and triggerdynamical instabilities that dramatically reshape their stellar component.after only 2-3 orbits low surface brightness (lsb) dirrs are transformed intodsphs, while high surface brightness (hsb) dirrs evolve into des. thisevolutionary mechanism naturally leads to the morphology-density relationobserved for lg dwarfs. dwarfs surrounded by very dense dark matter halos, likethe archetypical dirr gr8, are turned into draco or ursa minor, the faintestand most dark matter dominated among lg dsphs. if disks include a gaseouscomponent, this is both tidally stripped and consumed in periodic bursts ofstar formation. the resulting star formation histories are in good qualitativeagreement with those derived using hst color-magnitude diagrams for localdsphs.

astro-ph;0110386	tidal debris of dwarf spheroidals as a probe of structure formation  models	recent observations suggest that carina and other nearby dwarf spheroidalgalaxies are surrounded by unbound stars tidally stripped by the milky way. werun high-resolution n-body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting within themilky way halo to determine if such observations can be explained with darkmatter potentials as those implied by current structure formation models. weshow that tidal forces acting on dwarfs with constant density cores or withcuspy profiles having a low concentration parameter ($c &lt; 5$) lead to flatouter stellar density profiles like that of carina for a variety of orbitalconfigurations. on the contrary, it is more difficult to remove stars fromcuspy dark matter halos with concentrations as high as predicted by cdm modelsat the mass scale of dwarf galaxies ($c \simgt 10$) and the data can only bereproduced assuming nearly radial orbits. our simulations show that carina islosing mass at a fractional rate $&lt; 0.1$ gyr$^{-1}$ and its mass-to-light ratiocould be inflated by at most a factor of 2 due to unbound stars projected alongthe line of sight. we follow the evolution of the tidal debris within atriaxial clumpy cold dark matter milky way halo which causes differentialprecession and small scale heating of the stellar streams. this renders theiruse as a dynamical tracer of the galactic potential practically useless, butdoes provide a novel test of the nature of the dark matter. models with warmdark matter (wdm) or fluid dark matter (fdm) produce dwarf halos with lowercentral densities than cdm and would be consistent with the observed tidaltails even for orbits with eccentricities as low as indicated by current dataon nearby dwarf spheroidals. galactic halos in fdm are smooth and spherical andwould be favored by the detection of coherent streams.

astro-ph;0509263	cosmological simulations of galaxy formation i: star formation,  feedback, resolution and matching the tully--fisher relation (among other  things)	we used fully cosmological, high resolution n-body+sph simulations to followthe formation of disk galaxies with a rotational velocity between 140 and 280km/sec in a lambda cdm universe. the simulations include gas cooling, starformation (sf), the effects of a uniform uv background and a physicallymotivated description of feedback from supernovae (sn). feedback parametershave been chosen to match the star formation rate and interstellar medium (ism)properties of local galaxies. in cosmological simulations galaxies formedrotationally supported disks with realistic exponential scale lengths and fallon the i-band and baryonic tully fisher relations. the combination of uvbackground and sn feedback drastically reduced the number of visible satellitesorbiting inside a milky way sized halo, bringing it in fair agreement withobservations. feedback delays sf in small galaxies and more massive onescontain older stellar populations. here we focus on the sf and feedbackimplementations. we also briefly discuss how high mass and force resolution anda realistic description of sf and feedback are important ingredients to matchthe observed properties of galaxies.

astro-ph;0509644	is there evidence for flat cores in the halos of dwarf galaxies?: the  case of ngc 3109 and ngc 6822	two well studied dwarf galaxies -- ngc 3109 and ngc 6822 -- present some ofthe strongest observational support for a flat core at the center of galacticdark matter (dm) halos. we use detailed cosmologically motivated numericalmodels to investigate the systematics and the accuracy of recovering parametersof the galaxies. some of our models match the observed structure of the twogalaxies remarkably well. our analysis shows that the rotation curves of thesetwo galaxies are instead quite compatible with their dm halos having steepcuspy density profiles. the rotation curves in our models are measured usingstandard observational techniques. the models reproduce the rotation curves ofboth galaxies, the disk surface brightness profiles as well as the profile ofisophotal ellipticity and position angle. the models are centrally dominated bybaryons; however, the dark matter component is globally dominant. the simulateddisk mass is marginally consistent with a stellar mass-to-light ratio inagreement with the observed colors. we show that non-circular motions combinedwith gas pressure support and projection effects results in a largeunderestimation of the circular velocity in the central $\sim 1$ kpc region,creating the illusion of a constant density core. although the systematiceffects mentioned above are stronger in barred systems, they are also presentin axisymetric disks. our results strongly suggest that there is nocontradiction between the observed rotation curves in dwarf galaxies and thecuspy central dark matter density profiles predicted by cold dark mattermodels.

astro-ph;0511005	cosmological simulations of galaxy formation ii: matching the  observational properties of disk galaxies	we used fully cosmological, high resolution n-body + sph simulations tofollow the formation of disk galaxies with a rotational velocity between 140and 280 km/sec in a lambda cdm universe. the simulations include gas cooling,star formation, the effects of a uniform uv background and a physicallymotivated description of feedback from supernovae. the host dark matter haloshave a spin and last major merger redshift typical of galaxy sized halos asmeasured in recent large scale n-body simulations. galaxies formed rotationallysupported disks with realistic exponential scale lengths and fall on the i-bandand baryonic tully fisher relations. the combination of uv background and snfeedback drastically reduced the number of visible satellites orbiting inside amilky way sized halo, bringing it fair agreement with observations. feedbackdelays sf in small galaxies and more massive ones contain older stellarpopulations. the current star formation rates as a function of galaxy stellarmass are in good agreement with those measured by the sdss.

astro-ph;0602003	the age dependence of galaxy clustering	we construct mock galaxy catalogues to analyse clustering properties of alambda cold dark matter (lcdm) universe within a cosmological dark mattersimulation of sufficient resolution to resolve structure down to the scale ofdwarfs. we show that there is a strong age-clustering correlation for objectslikely to host luminous galaxies, which includes the satellite halo (subhalo)population. older mock galaxies are significantly more clustered in ourcatalog, which consists of satellite haloes as well as the central peaks ofdiscrete haloes, selected solely by peak circular velocity. this age dependenceis caused mainly by the age-clustering relation for discrete haloes, recentlyfound by gao et al., acting mostly on field members, combined with the tendencyfor older mock galaxies to lie within groups and clusters, where galaxyclustering is enhanced. our results suggest that the clustering age dependenceis manifested in real galaxies. at small scales (less than ~5 mpc/h), the verysimple assumption that galaxy colour depends solely on halo age is inconsistentwith the strength of the observed clustering colour trends, where red galaxiesbecome increasingly more clustered than blue galaxies toward smaller scales,suggesting that luminosity weighted galaxy ages do not closely trace theassembly epoch of their dark matter hosts. the age dependence is present but ismuch weaker for satellite haloes lying within groups and clusters than for theglobal population.

astro-ph;9508152	small groups of galaxies: a clue to a critical universe	we study the formation and the evolution of galaxy groups in a criticaluniverse, showing the importance of secondary infall for their dynamicalevolution. merging is only slightly accelerated if galaxies have massive halos,because the mass initially associated to the individual galaxies is soontidally stripped. stripping is particularly effective for infalling galaxies,which thus avoid merging. we find that, as a rule, merging is effectivelyterminated when infall becomes dominant. we look for compact groups in ourensemble of simulations, and compare their statistical properties withhickson's compact groups. we then discuss in terms of the press &amp; schechterformalism the statistics of such groups and their evolution in differentcosmological scenarios. we show that compact group formation is an ongoing andfrequent process in a critical universe. our model reconciles the contradictionbetween the observed absence of young merger remnants and the high rate ofgalaxy interactions expected in compact groups. in open universes, instead,earlier formation of groups and suppression of secondary infall makes it moreunlikely that compact groups survive as such until the present. we concludethat the existence of dense and dynamically young groups of galaxies like hcgspoints towards a high-density universe.

astro-ph;9709051	resolving the structure of cold dark matter halos	we examine the effects of mass resolution and force softening on the densityprofiles of cold dark matter halos that form within cosmological n-bodysimulations. as we increase the mass and force resolution, we resolveprogenitor halos that collapse at higher redshifts and have very highdensities. at our highest resolution we have nearly 3 million particles withinthe virial radius, several orders of magnitude more than previously used and wecan resolve more than one thousand surviving dark matter halos within thissingle virialised system. the halo profiles become steeper in the centralregions and we may not have achieved convergence to a unique slope within theinner 10% of the virialised region. results from two very high resolution halosimulations yield steep inner density profiles, $\rho(r)\sim r^{-1.4}$. theabundance and properties of arcs formed within this potential will be differentfrom calculations based on lower resolution simulations. the kinematics ofdisks within such a steep potential may prove problematic for the cdm modelwhen compared with the observed properties of halos on galactic scales.

astro-ph;9801192	dark matter halos within clusters	we examine the properties of dark matter halos within a rich galaxy clusterusing a high resolution simulation that captures the cosmological context of acold dark matter universe. the mass and force resolution permit the resolutionof 150 halos with circular velocities larger than 80 kms within the cluster'svirial radius of 2 mpc. this enables an unprecedented study of the statisticalproperties of a large sample of dark matter halos evolving in a denseenvironment. the cumulative fraction of mass attached to these halos variesfrom 0% at 200 kpc, to 13% at the virial radius. even at this resolution theovermerging problem persists; halos that pass within 200 kpc of the clustercenter are tidally disrupted. additional substructure is lost at earlier epochswithin the massive progenitor halos. the median ratio of apocentric topericentric radii is 6:1; the orbital distribution is close to isotropic,circular orbits are rare, radial orbits are common. the orbits of halos areunbiased with respect to both position within the cluster and with the orbitsof the smooth dark matter background and no velocity bias is detected. thetidal radii of surviving halos are generally well-fit using the simple analyticprediction applied to their orbital pericenters. halos within clusters havehigher concentrations than those in the field. within the cluster, halo densityprofiles can be modified by tidal forces and individual encounters with otherhalos that cause significant mass loss - ``galaxy harassment''. mergers betweenhalos do not occur inside the clusters virial radius.

astro-ph;9903164	cold collapse and the core catastrophe	we show that a universe dominated by cold dark matter fails to reproduce therotation curves of dark matter dominated galaxies, one of the key problems thatit was designed to resolve. we perform numerical simulations of the formationof dark matter halos, each containing \gsim 10^6 particles and resolved to0.003 times the virial radius, allowing an accurate comparison with rotationcurve data. a good fit to both galactic and cluster sized halos can be achievedusing the density profile rho(r) \propto [(r/r_s)^1.5(1+(r/r_s)^1.5)]^-1, wherer_s is a scale radius. this profile has a steeper asymptotic slope, rho(r)\propto r^-1.5, and a sharper turnover than found by lower resolution studies.the central structure of relaxed halos that form within a hierarchical universehas a remarkably small scatter (unrelaxed halos would not host disks). wecompare the results with a sample of dark matter dominated, low surfacebrightness (lsb) galaxies with circular velocities in the range 100-300 km/s.the rotation curves of disks within cold dark matter halos rise too steeply tomatch these data which require a constant mass density in the central regions.the same conclusion is reached if we compare the scale free shape of observedrotation curves with the simulation data. it is important to confirm theseresults using stellar rather than hi rotation curves for lsb galaxies. we testthe effects of introducing a cut-off in the power spectrum that may occur in auniverse dominated by warm dark matter. in this case halos form by a monolithiccollapse but the final density profile hardly changes, demonstrating that themerger history does not play a role in determining the halo structure.

astro-ph;9907088	dynamical friction and the evolution of satellites in virialized halos:  the theory of linear response	the evolution of a small satellite inside a more massive truncated isothermalspherical halo is studied using both the theory of linear response fordynamical friction and n-body simulations. the analytical approach includes theeffects of the gravitational wake, of the tidal deformation and the shift ofthe barycenter of the primary, so unifying the local versus globalinterpretation of dynamical friction. sizes, masses, orbital energies andeccentricities are chosen as expected in hierarchical clustering models. wefind that in general the drag force in self-gravitating backgrounds is weakerthan in uniform media and that the orbital decay is not accompanied by asignificant circularization. we also show that the dynamical friction timescale is weakly dependent on the initial circularity. we provide a fittingformula for the decay time that includes the effect of mass and angularmomentum loss. live satellites with dense cores can survive disruption up to anhubble time within the primary, notwithstanding the initial choice of orbitalparameters. dwarf spheroidal satellites of the milky way, like sagittarius aand fornax, have already suffered mass stripping and, with their presentmasses, the sinking times exceed 10 gyr even if they are on very eccentricorbits.

astro-ph;9910166	density profiles and substructure of dark matter halos: converging  results at ultra-high numerical resolution	can n-body simulations reliably determine the structural properties of darkmatter halos? focussing on a virgo-sized galaxy cluster, we increase theresolution of current ``high resolution simulations'' by almost an order ofmagnitude to examine the convergence of the important physical quantities. wehave 4 million particles within the cluster and force resolution 0.5 kpc/h(0.05% of the virial radius). the central density profile has a logarithmicslope of -1.5, as found in lower resolution studies of the same halo,indicating that the profile has converged to the ``physical'' limit down toscales of a few kpc. also the abundance of substructure is consistent with thatderived from lower resolution runs; on the scales explored, the mass andcircular velocity functions are close to power laws of exponents ~ -1.9 and -4.overmerging appears to be globally unimportant for suhalos with circularvelocities &gt; 100 km/s. we can trace most of the cluster progenitors from z=3 tothe present; the central object (the dark matter analog of a cd galaxy)isassembled between z=3 and 1 from the merging of a dozen halos with v_circ \sim300 km/s. the mean circular velocity of the subhalos decreases by ~ 20% over 5billion years, due to tidal mass loss. the velocity dispersions of halos anddark matter globally agree within 10%, but the halos are spatially anti-biased,and, in the very central region of the cluster, they show positive velocitybias; however, this effect appears to depend on numerical resolution.

0811.0615	pairing of supermassive black holes in unequal-mass galaxy mergers	we examine the pairing process of supermassive black holes (smbhs) down toscales of 20-100 pc using a set of n-body/sph simulations of binary mergers ofdisk galaxies with mass ratios of 1:4 and 1:10. our numerical experiments aredesigned to represent merger events occurring at various cosmic epochs. theinitial conditions of the encounters are consistent with the lambdacdm paradigmof structure formation, and the simulations include the effects of radiativecooling, star formation, and supernovae feedback. we find that the pairing ofsmbhs depends sensitively on the amount of baryonic mass preserved in thecenter of the companion galaxies during the last phases of the merger. inparticular, due to the combination of gasdynamics and star formation, we findthat a pair of smbhs can form in 1:10 minor mergers provided that galaxies arerelatively gas-rich (gas fractions of 30% of the disk mass) and that themergers occur at relatively high redshift (z~3), when dynamical frictiontimescales are shorter. since 1:10 mergers are most common events during theassembly of galaxies, and mergers are more frequent at high redshift whengalaxies are also more gas-rich, our results have positive implications forfuture gravitational wave experiments such as the laser interferometer spaceantenna.
