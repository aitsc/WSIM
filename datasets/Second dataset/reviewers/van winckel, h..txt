0706.2120	iras08281-4850 and iras14325-6428: two a-type post-agb stars with  s-process enrichment	one of the puzzling findings in the study of the chemical evolution of(post-)agb stars is why very similar stars (in terms of metallicity, spectraltype, infrared properties, etc...) show a very different photosphericcomposition. we aim at extending the still limited sample of s-process enrichedpost-agb stars, in order to obtain a statistically large enough sample thatallows us to formulate conclusions concerning the 3rd dredge-up occurrence. weselected two post-agb stars on the basis of ir colours indicative of a pasthistory of heavy mass loss: iras08281-4850 and iras14325-6428. they are coolsources in the locus of the planetary nebulae (pne) in the iras colour-colourdiagram. abundances of both objects were derived for the first time on thebasis of high-quality uves and emmi spectra, using a critically compiled linelist with accurate log(gf) values, together with the latest kurucz modelatmospheres. both objects have very similar spectroscopically defined effectivetemperatures of 7750-8000k. they are strongly carbon and s-process enriched,with a c/o ratio of 1.9 and 1.6, and an [ls/fe] of +1.7 and +1.2, for iras08281and iras14325 resp. moreover, the spectral energy distributions (seds) point toheavy mass-loss during the preceding agb phase. iras08281 and iras14325 areprototypical post-agb objects in the sense that they show strong post 3rddredge-up chemical enrichments. the neutron irradiation has been extremelyefficient, despite the only mild sub-solar metallicity. this is not conformwith the recent chemical models. the existence of very similar post-agb starswithout any enrichment emphasizes our poor knowledge of the details of the agbnucleosynthesis and dredge-up phenomena. we call for a very systematic chemicalstudy of all cool sources in the pn region of the iras colour-colour diagram.

0903.5213	long-term photometric monitoring with the mercator telescope.  frequencies and multicolour amplitudes of $\gamma$ doradus stars	gamma doradus stars are excellent targets for asteroseismology since thegravity modes present in these stars probe the deep stellar interiors. modeidentification will improve the knowledge of these stars considerably. aselected group of gamma doradus stars and some candidates were observed withthe mercator telescope to find and/or confirm the periodicities in the lightvariations and to derive reliable amplitude ratios in different pass bands. afrequency analysis was performed on all new data obtained in the genevaphotometric system. in order to have more reliable and accurate frequencies,the new data were combined with similar data from the literature and withhipparcos observations. a set of frequencies that minimized the the residualsin a harmonic fit was searched for while allowing means and amplitudes to varyfrom one observation set to another. frequencies and amplitudes in thephotometric passbands of the geneva system are given for 21 gamma doradusstars. we report the discovery of hd 74504 as a newly found gamma doradus star.our study provides the first extensive multicolour database for theunderstanding of gravity modes in f-type stars.

0906.4718	analysis of the infrared spectra of the peculiar post-agb stars eplyr  and hd52961	aim: we aim to study in detail the peculiar mineralogy and structure of thecircumstellar environment of two binary post-agb stars, eplyr and hd52961. bothstars were selected from a larger sample of evolved disc sources observed withspitzer and show unique solid-state and gas features in their infrared spectra.moreover, they show a very small infrared excess in comparison with the othersample stars. methods: the different dust and gas species are identified on thebasis of high-resolution spitzer-irs spectra. we fit the full spectrum toconstrain grain sizes and temperature distributions in the discs. this,combined with our broad-band spectral energy distribution and interferometricmeasurements, allows us to study the physical structure of the disc, using aself-consistent 2d radiative-transfer disc model. results: we find that bothstars have strong emission features due to co_2 gas, dominated by^{12}c^{16}o_2, but with clear ^{13}c^{16}o_2 and even ^{16}o^{12}c^{18}oisotopic signatures. crystalline silicates are apparent in both sources butproved very hard to model. ep lyr also shows evidence of mixed chemistry, withemission features of the rare class-c pahs. whether these pahs reside in theoxygen-rich disc or in a carbon-rich outflow is still unclear. with thestrongly processed silicates, the mixed chemistry and the low ^{12}c/^{13}cratio, ep lyr resembles some silicate j-type stars, although the depletedphotosphere makes nucleosynthetic signatures difficult to probe. we find thatthe disc environment of both sources is, to a first approximation, wellmodelled with a passive disc, but additional physics such as grain settling,radial dust distributions, and an outflow component must be included to explainthe details of the observed spectral energy distributions in both stars.

0910.5624	chemical depletion in the large magellanic cloud: rv tauri stars and the  photospheric feedback from their dusty discs	aims: by studying the photospheric abundances of 4 rv tauri stars in the lmc,we test whether the depletion pattern of refractory elements, seen in similargalactic sources, is also common for extragalactic sources. since thisdepletion process probably only occurs through interaction with a stable disc,we investigate the circumstellar environment of these sources. methods: adetailed photospheric abundance study was performed using high-resolution uvesoptical spectra. to study the circumstellar environment we use photometric datato construct the spectral energy distributions of the stars, and determine thegeometry of the circumstellar environment, whereas low-resolution spitzer-irsinfrared spectra are used to trace its mineralogy. results: our results showthat, also in the lmc, the photospheres of rv tauri stars are commonly affectedby the depletion process, although it can differ significantly in strength fromsource to source. from our detailed disc modelling and mineralogy study, wefind that this process, as in the galaxy, appears closely related to thepresence of a stable keplerian disc. the newly studied extragalactic objectshave similar observational characteristics as galactic post-agb binariessurrounded by a dusty disc, and are therefore also believed to be part of abinary system. one source shows a very small infrared excess, atypical for adisc source, but still has evidence for depletion. we speculate this couldpoint to the presence of a very evolved disc, similar to debris discs seenaround young stellar objects.

0707.2288	stellar population synthesis of post-agb stars: the s-process in  macho47.2496.8	the low-metallicity rv tauri star macho47.2496.8, recently discovered in thelarge magellanic cloud, is highly enriched in carbon and heavy elementsproduced by the slow neutron capture process (s-process), and is most probablya genuine post-c(n-type) asymptotic giant branch (agb) star. we use theanalysis of the abundances of macho47.2496.8 to constrain free parameters inagb models. we test which values of the free parameters describing uncertainphysical mechanisms in agb stars, namely the third dredge-up and the featuresof the 13c neutron source, produce models that better match the abundancesobserved in macho47.2496.8. we carry out stellar population synthesis coupledwith s-process nucleosynthesis using a synthetic stellar evolution code. thes-process ratios observed in macho47.2496.8 can be matched by the same modelsthat explain the s-process ratios of galactic agb and post-agb stars ofmetallicity &gt; z_sun/10, except for the choice of the effectiveness of 13c as aneutron source, which has to be lower by roughly a factor of 3 to 6. the lesseffective neutron source for lower metallicities is also required whencomparing population synthesis results to observations of galactic halo$s$-enhanced stars, such as pb stars. the 12c/13c ratio in macho47.2496.8cannot be matched simultaneously and requires the occurrence of extra-mixingprocesses. the confirmed trend of the decreased efficiency of the 13c neutronsource with metallicity requires an explanation from agb s-process models. thepresent work is to date the first comparison between theoretical models and thedetailed abundances of an extragalactic post-agb star.

1001.1116	photometric multi-site campaign on the open cluster ngc 884 i. detection  of the variable stars	context: recent progress in the seismic interpretation of field beta cepstars has resulted in improvements of the physics in the stellar structure andevolution models of massive stars. further asteroseismic constraints can beobtained from studying ensembles of stars in a young open cluster, which allhave similar age, distance and chemical composition.  aims: to improve our comprehension of the beta cep stars, we studied theyoung open cluster ngc 884 to discover new b-type pulsators, besides the twoknown beta cep stars, and other variable stars.  methods: an extensive multi-site campaign was set up to gather accurate ccdphotometry time series in four filters (u, b, v, i) of a field of ngc884.fifteen different instruments collected almost 77500 ccd images in 1286 hours.the images were calibrated and reduced to transform the ccd frames intointerpretable differential light curves. various variability indicators andfrequency analyses were applied to detect variable stars in the field. absolutephotometry was taken to deduce some general cluster and stellar properties.  results: we achieved an accuracy for the brightest stars of 5.7 mmag in v,6.9 mmag in b, 5.0 mmag in i and 5.3 mmag in u. the noise level in theamplitude spectra is 50 micromag in the v band. our campaign confirms thepreviously known pulsators, and we report more than one hundred new multi- andmono-periodic b-, a- and f-type stars. their interpretation in terms ofclassical instability domains is not straightforward, pointing to imperfectionsin theoretical instability computations. in addition, we have discovered sixnew eclipsing binaries and four candidates as well as other irregular variablestars in the observed field.

1004.1967	when an old star smolders: on the detection of hydrocarbon emission from  s-type agb stars	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) produce characteristic infraredemission bands that have been observed in a wide range of astrophysicalenvironments, where carbonaceous material is subjected to ultraviolet (uv)radiation. although pahs are expected to form in carbon-rich agb stars, theyhave up to now only been observed in binary systems where a hot companionprovides a hard radiation field. in this letter, we present low-resolutioninfrared spectra of four s-type agb stars, selected from a sample of 90 s-typeagb stars observed with the infrared spectrograph aboard the spitzer satellite.the spectra of these four stars show the typical infrared features of pahmolecules. we confirm the correlation between the temperature of the centralstar and the centroid wavelength of the 7.9 {\mu}m feature, present in a widevariety of stars spanning a temperature range from 3 000 to 12 000 k. three offour sources presented in this paper extend this relation towards lowertemperatures. we argue that the mixture of hydrocarbons we see in these s-starshas a rich aliphatic component. the fourth star, bz cma, deviates from thiscorrelation. based on the similarity with the evolved binary tu tau, we predictthat bz cma has a hot companion as well.

1005.1502	herschel images of ngc 6720: h2 formation on dust grains	herschel pacs and spire images have been obtained of ngc 6720 (the ringnebula). this is an evolved planetary nebula with a central star that iscurrently on the cooling track, due to which the outer parts of the nebula arerecombining. from the pacs and spire images we conclude that there is astriking resemblance between the dust distribution and the h2 emission, whichappears to be observational evidence that h2 forms on grain surfaces. we havedeveloped a photoionization model of the nebula with the cloudy code which weused to determine the physical conditions of the dust and investigate possibleformation scenarios for the h2. we conclude that the most plausible scenario isthat the h2 resides in high density knots which were formed after therecombination of the gas started when the central star entered the coolingtrack. hydrodynamical instabilities due to the unusually low temperature of therecombining gas are proposed as a mechanism for forming the knots. h2 formationin the knots is expected to be substantial after the central star underwent astrong drop in luminosity about one to two thousand years ago, and may still beongoing at this moment, depending on the density of the knots and theproperties of the grains in the knots.

0709.3197	dust-grain processing in circumbinary discs around evolved binaries. the  rv tauri spectral twins ru cen and ac her	context: we study the structure and evolution of circumstellar discs aroundevolved binaries and their impact on the evolution of the central system. aims:to study in detail the binary nature of rucen and acher, as well as thestructure and mineralogy of the circumstellar environment. methods: we combinemulti-wavelength observations with a 2d radiative transfer study. our radialvelocity program studies the central stars, while our spitzer spectra andbroad-band seds are used to constrain mineralogy, grain sizes and physicalstructure of the circumstellar environment. results: we determine the orbitalelements of rucen showing that the orbit is highly eccentric with a rather longperiod of 1500 days. the infrared spectra of both objects are very similar andthe spectral dust features are dominated by mg-rich crystalline silicates. thesmall peak-to-continuum ratios are interpreted as being due to large grains.our model contains two components with a cold midplain dominated by largegrains, and the near- and mid-ir which is dominated by the emission of smallersilicates. the infrared excess is well modelled assuming a hydrostatic passiveirradiated disc. the profile-fitting of the dust resonances shows that thegrains must be very irregular. conclusions: these two prototypical rvtauripulsators with circumstellar dust are binaries where the dust is trapped in astable disc. the mineralogy and grain sizes show that the dust is highlyprocessed, both in crystallinity and grain size. the cool crystals show thateither radial mixing is very efficient and/or that the thermal history at grainformation has been very different from that in outflows. the physical processesgoverning the structure of these discs are similar to those observed inprotoplanetary discs around young stellar objects.

1104.2254	the optically bright post-agb population of the lmc	the detected variety in chemistry and circumstellar shell morphology of thelimited sample of galactic post-agb stars is so large that there is noconsensus yet on how the different objects are linked by evolutionary channels.the evaluation is complicated by the fact that their distances and henceluminosities remain largely unknown. via cross-correlation of the spitzer sagecatalogue with optical catalogues we selected a sample of lmc post-agbcandidates based on their [8]-[24] colour index and estimated luminosity. wedetermined the fundamental properties of the central stars of 105 of theseobjects using low-resolution, optical spectra that we obtained at siding springobservatory and saao, and constructed a catalogue of 70 high probability and1337 candidate post-agb stars that is available at the cds. the sample forms anideal testbed for stellar evolution theory predictions of the final phase oflow- and intermediate-mass stars, because the distance and hence luminosity andalso the current and initial mass of these objects is well constrained. abouthalf of the objects in our sample of post-agb candidates show a spectral energydistribution (sed) that is indicative of a disc rather than an expanding andcooling agb remnant. like in the galaxy, the disc sources are likely associatedwith binary evolution. important side products of this research are cataloguesof candidate young stellar objects, candidate supergiants with circumstellardust, and discarded objects for which a spectrum was obtained. these too areavailable at the cds.

1202.2290	the spitzer spectroscopic survey of s-type stars	s-type agb stars are thought to be in the transitional phase between m-typeand c-type agb stars. because of their peculiar chemical composition, one mayexpect a strong influence of the stellar c/o ratio on the molecular chemistryand the mineralogy of the circumstellar dust. in this paper, we present a largesample of 87 intrinsic galactic s-type agb stars, observed at infraredwavelengths with the spitzer space telescope, and supplemented withground-based optical data. on the one hand, we derive the stellar parametersfrom the optical spectroscopy and photometry, using a grid of modelatmospheres. on the other, we decompose the infrared spectra to quantify theflux-contributions from the different dust species. finally, we compare theindependently determined stellar parameters and dust properties. for the starswithout significant dust emission, we detect a strict relation between thepresence of sis absorption in the spitzer spectra and the c/o ratio of thestellar atmosphere. these absorption bands can thus be used as an additionaldiagnostic for the c/o ratio. for stars with significant dust emission, wedefine three groups, based on the relative contribution of certain dust speciesto the infrared flux. we find a strong link between group-membership and c/oratio. we show that these groups can be explained by assuming that thedust-condensation can be cut short before silicates are produced, while theremaining free atoms and molecules can then form the observed magnesiumsulfides or the carriers of the unidentified 13 and 20 micron features.finally, we present the detection of emission features attributed to moleculesand dust characteristic to c-type stars, such as molecular sis, hydrocarbonsand magnesium sulfide grains. we show that we often detect magnesium sulfidestogether with molecular sis and we propose that it is formed by a reaction ofsis molecules with mg.

1202.5553	mass ratio from doppler beaming and r{\o}mer delay versus ellipsoidal  modulation in the kepler data of koi-74	we present a light curve analysis and radial velocity study of koi-74, aneclipsing a star + white dwarf binary with a 5.2 day orbit. aside from newspectroscopy covering the orbit of the system, we used 212 days of publiclyavailable kepler observations and present the first complete light curvefitting to these data, modelling the eclipses and transits, ellipsoidalmodulation, reflection, and doppler beaming. markov chain monte carlosimulations are used to determine the system parameters and uncertaintyestimates. our results are in agreement with earlier studies, except that wefind an inclination of 87.0 \pm 0.4\degree, which is significantly lower thanthe previously published value. we find that the mass ratio derived from theradial velocity amplitude (q=0.104 \pm 0.004) disagrees with that derived fromthe ellipsoidal modulation (q=0.052 \pm 0.004} assuming corotation). this wasfound before, but with our smaller inclination, the discrepancy is even largerthan previously reported. accounting for the rapid rotation of the a-star isfound to increase the discrepancy even further by lowering the mass ratio toq=0.047 \pm 0.004. these results indicate that one has to be extremely carefulin using the amplitude of an ellipsoidal modulation signal in a close binary todetermine the mass ratio, when a proof of corotation is not firmly established.the radial velocities that can be inferred from the detected doppler beaming inthe light curve are found to be in agreement with our spectroscopic radialvelocity determination. we also report the first measurement of r{\o}mer delayin a light curve of a compact binary. this delay amounts to -56 \pm 17 s and isconsistent with the mass ratio derived from the radial velocity amplitude. thefirm establishment of this mass ratio at q=0.104 \pm 0.004 leaves little doubtthat the companion of koi-74 is a low mass white dwarf.

1204.3004	time resolved spectroscopy of bd+46 442: gas streams and jet creation in  a newly discovered evolved binary with a disk	previous studies have shown that many post-agb stars with dusty disks areassociated with single-lined binary stars. to verify the binarity hypothesis ona larger sample, we started a high-resolution spectral monitoring of about 40field giants, whose binarity was suspected based on either a light curve, aninfrared excess, or a peculiar chemical composition. here we report on thediscovery of the periodic rv variations in bd+46 442, a high-latitude f giantwith a disk. we interpret the variations due to the motion around a faintcompanion, and deduce the following orbital parameters: porb = 140.77 d, e =0.083, asini=0.31 au. we find it to be a moderately metal-poor star([m/h]=-0.7) without a strong depletion pattern in the photospheric abundances.interestingly, many lines show periodic changes with the orbital phase: halphaswitches between a double-peak emission and a pcyg-like profiles, while strongmetal lines appear split during the maximum redshift. similar effects arelikely visible in the spectra of other post-agb binaries, but their regularityis not always realized due to sporadic observations. we propose that thesefeatures result from an ongoing mass transfer from the evolved giant to thecompanion. in particular, the blue-shifted absorption in halpha, which occursonly at superior conjunction, may result from a jet originating in theaccretion disk around the companion and seen in absorption towards the luminousprimary.

(\approx 4.6 stellar radii). this isthe first time that this tio emission band is observed. a search for similaremission features in the sample of s-type stars yielded two additionalcandidates. however, owing to the additional dust emission, the identificationis less stringent. by comparing the stellar characteristics of np aur to thoseof the other stars in our sample, we find that all stars with tio emission showlarge-amplitude pulsations, s-process enrichment, and a low c/o ratio. thesecharacteristics might be necessary requirements for a star to show tio inemission, but they are not sufficient.

1307.4172	magellanic cloud stars with tio bands in emission: binary post-rgb/agb  stars or young stellar objects?	fourteen stars from a sample of magellanic cloud objects selected to have amid-infrared flux excess have been found to also show tio bands in emission.the mid-infrared dust emission and the tio band emission indicate that thesestars have large amounts of hot circumstellar dust and gas in close proximityto the central star. the luminosities of the sources are typically severalthousand l_sun while the effective temperatures are 4000-8000 k. such starscould be post-agb stars of mass 0.4-0.8 m_sun or pre-main-sequence stars (youngstellar objects) with masses of 7-19 m_sun. if the stars are pre-main-sequencestars, they are substantially cooler and younger than stars at the birth linewhere galactic protostars are first supposed to become optically visible out oftheir molecular clouds. they should therefore be hidden in their presentevolutionary state. the second explanation for these stars is that they arepost-agb or post-rgb stars that have recently undergone a binary interactionwhen the red giant of the binary system filled its roche lobe. beingoxygen-rich, they have gone through this process before becoming carbon stars.most of the stars vary slowly on timescales of 1000 days or more suggesting achanging circumstellar environment. apart from the slow variations, most starsalso show variability with periods of tens to hundreds of days. one star showsa period that is rapidly decreasing and we speculate that this star may haveaccreted a large blob of gas and dust onto a disk whose orbital radius isshrinking rapidly. another star has cepheid-like pulsations of rapidlyincreasing amplitude suggesting a rapid rate of evolution. seven stars showquasi-periodic variability and one star has a light curve similar to that of aneclipsing binary.

1402.3169	the lead discrepancy in intrinsically s-process enriched post-agb stars  in the magellanic clouds	context: our understanding of the s-process nucleosynthesis in asymptoticgiant branch (agb) stars is incomplete. agb models predict, for example, largeoverabundances of lead (pb) compared to other s-process elements in metal-poorlow-mass agb stars. this is indeed observed in some extrinsically enhancedmetal-poor stars, but not in all. an extensive study of intrinsically s-processenriched objects is essential for improving our knowledge of the agb thirddredge-up and associated s-process nucleosynthesis. aims: we compare thespectral abundance analysis of the smc post-agb star j004441.04-732136.4 withstate-of-the-art agb model predictions with a main focus on pb. the low s/n inthe pb line region made the result of our previous study inconclusive. weacquired additional data covering the region of the strongest pb line. methods:by carefully complementing re-reduced previous data, with newly acquired uvesoptical spectra, we improve the s/n of the spectrum around the strongest pbline. therefore, an upper limit for the pb abundance is estimated from a mergedweighted mean spectrum using synthetic spectral modeling. we then compare theabundance results from the combined spectra to predictions of tailored agbevolutionary models from two independent evolution codes. in addition, wedetermine upper limits for pb abundances for three previously studied lmcpost-agb objects. results: although theoretical predictions forj004441.04-732136.4 match the s-process distribution up to tungsten (w), thepredicted very high pb abundance is clearly not detected. the three additionallmc post-agb stars show a similar lack of a very high pb abundance. conclusion:from our study, we conclude that none of these low-mass, low-metallicitypost-agb stars of the lmc and smc are strong pb producers. this conflicts withcurrent theoretical predictions.

1410.8178	detecting non-uniform period spacings in the kepler photometry of gamma  doradus stars: methodology and case studies	context. the analysis of stellar oscillations is one of the most reliableways to probe stellar interiors. recent space missions such as kepler haveprovided us with an opportunity to study these oscillations with unprecedenteddetail. for many multi-periodic pulsators such as {\gamma} doradus stars, thisled to the detection of dozens to hundreds of oscillation frequencies thatcould not be found from ground-based observations. aims. we aim to detectnon-uniform period spacings in the fourier spectra of a sample of {\gamma}doradus stars observed by kepler. such detection is complicated by both thelarge number of significant frequencies in the space photometry and byoverlapping non-equidistant rotationally split multiplets. methods. guided bytheoretical properties of gravity-mode oscillation of {\gamma} doradus stars,we developed a period-spacing detection method and applied it to keplerobservations of a few stars, after having tested the performance fromsimulations. results. the application of the technique resulted in the cleardetection of non-uniform period spacing series for three out of the fivetreated kepler targets. disadvantages of the technique are also discussed, andinclude the disability to distinguish between different values of the sphericaldegree and azimuthal order of the oscillation modes without additionaltheoretical modelling. conclusions. despite the shortcomings, the method isshown to allow solid detections of period spacings for {\gamma} doradus stars,which will allow future asteroseismic analyses of these stars.

1511.06583	the hermes solar atlas and the spectroscopic analysis of the seismic  solar analogue kic3241581	solar-analog stars provide an excellent opportunity to study the sun'sevolution, i.e. the changes with time in stellar structure, activity, orrotation for solar-like stars. the unparalleled photometric data from the nasaspace telescope kepler allows us to study and characterise solar-like starsthrough asteroseismology. we aim to spectroscopically investigate thefundamental parameter and chromospheric activity of solar analogues and twins,based on observations obtained with the hermes spectrograph and combine themwith asteroseismology. therefore, we need to build a solar atlas for thespectrograph, to provide accurate calibrations of the spectroscopicallydetermined abundances of solar and late type stars observed with thisinstrument and thus perform differential spectral comparisons. we acquirehigh-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectroscopy to construct three solarreference spectra by observing the reflected light of vesta and victoriaasteroids and europa (100&lt;s/n&lt;450) with the \hermes spectrograph. we thenobserve the kepler solar analog kic3241581 (s/n~170). we constructed threesolar spectrum atlases from 385 to 900 nm obtained with the hermes spectrographfrom observations of two bright asteroids and europa. a comparison between oursolar spectra atlas to the kurucz and harps solar spectrum shows an excellentagreement. kic3241581 was found to be a long-periodic binary system. thefundamental parameter for the stellar primary component are teff=5689+/-11k,logg=4.385+/-0.005, [fe/h]=+0.22+/-0.01, being in agreement with the publishedglobal seismic values confirming its status of solar analogue. kic 3241581 is ametal rich solar analogue with a solar-like activity level in a binary systemof unknown period. the chromospheric activity level is compatible to the solarmagnetic activity.

astro-ph;0210145	the dust disk of hr4049	we present the spectral energy distribution of hr 4049 based on literaturedata and new continuum measurements at 850 micron. the sed shows variableabsorption in the uv, and a large ir excess, both caused by circumstellar dust.the shape of the ir excess from 1 micron all the way down to 850 micron can benearly perfectly fitted with a single blackbody function at t ~ 1150 k oralternatively with a sum of blackbodies in a narrow temperature range. theenergy emitted in this ir continuum radiation is about one-third of the stellarluminosity. we show that this blackbody radiation must be due to the presenceof a circumbinary disk with a large height. this disk must also be gas-rich, inagreement with the observations of molecular bands in the iso-sws spectrum. wepresent two possible scenario's for explaining the shape and the intensity ofthe ir excess. the first scenario involves large grains (a &gt;1 mm) that eachradiate like a blackbody. the second scenario argues that the blackbodyradiation is due to a very optically thick circumbinary disk. we investigate ifsuch a disk would indeed produce blackbody radiation by presenting results fromradiative transfer calculations. we further quantify the properties of such adisk and its stability in the framework of (hydro)dynamics, grain settling,radiation pressure and grain drift. the virtues and shortcomings of both modelsfor the origin of the ir blackbody are discussed by contrasting them with otherobservations and assessing them in the framework of (binary) (post-)agbevolution.

astro-ph;0601169	resolving the compact dusty discs around binary post-agb stars using  n-band interferometry	we present the first mid-ir long baseline interferometric observations of thecircumstellar matter around binary post-agb stars. two objects, sx cen and hd52961, were observed using the vlti/midi instrument during sciencedemonstration time. both objects are known binaries for which a stablecircumbinary disc is proposed to explain the sed characteristics. this iscorroborated by our n-band spectrum showing a crystallinity fraction of morethan 50 % for both objects, pointing to a stable environment where dustprocessing can occur. surprisingly, the dust surrounding sx cen is not resolvedin the interferometric observations providing an upper limit of 11 mas (or 18au at the distance of this object) on the diameter of the dust emission. thisconfirms the very compact nature of its circumstellar environment. the dustemission around hd 52961 originates from a very small but resolved region,estimated to be ~ 35 mas at 8 micron and ~ 55 mas at 13 micron. these resultsconfirm the disc interpretation of the sed of both stars. in hd 52961, the dustis not homogeneous in its chemical composition: the crystallinity is clearlyconcentrated in the hotter inner region. whether this is a result of theformation process of the disc, or due to annealing during the long storage timein the disc is not clear.
