0902.2213	the macho project hst follow-up: the large magellanic cloud microlensing  source stars	we present hubble space telescope (hst) wfpc2 photometry of 13 microlensedsource stars from the 5.7 year large magellanic cloud (lmc) survey conducted bythe macho project. the microlensing source stars are identified by derivingaccurate centroids in the ground-based macho images using difference imageanalysis (dia) and then transforming the dia coordinates to the hst frame. noneof these sources is coincident with a background galaxy, which rules out thepossibility that the macho lmc microlensing sample is contaminated withmisidentified supernovae or agn in galaxies behind the lmc. this supports theconclusion that the macho lmc microlensing sample has only a small amount ofcontamination due to non-microlensing forms of variability. we compare thewfpc2 source star magnitudes with the lensed flux predictions derived frommicrolensing fits to the light curve data. in most cases the source starbrightness is accurately predicted. finally, we develop a statistic whichconstrains the location of the large magellanic cloud (lmc) microlensing sourcestars with respect to the distributions of stars and dust in the lmc andcompare this to the predictions of various models of lmc microlensing. thistest excludes at &gt; 90% confidence level models where more than 80% of thesource stars lie behind the lmc. exotic models that attempt to explain theexcess lmc microlensing optical depth seen by macho with a population ofbackground sources are disfavored or excluded by this test. models in whichmost of the lenses reside in a halo or spheroid distribution associated witheither the milky way or the lmc are consistent which these data, but lmc haloor spheroid models are favored by the combined macho and eros microlensingresults.

0907.3471	mass measurement of a single unseen star and planetary detection  efficiency for ogle 2007-blg-050	we analyze ogle-2007-blg-050, a high magnification microlensing event (a ~432) whose peak occurred on 2 may, 2007, with pronounced finite-source andparallax effects. we compute planet detection efficiencies for this event inorder to determine its sensitivity to the presence of planets around the lensstar. both finite-source and parallax effects permit a measurement of theangular einstein radius \theta_e = 0.48 +/- 0.01 mas and the parallax \pi_e =0.12 +/- 0.03, leading to an estimate of the lens mass m = 0.50 +/- 0.14 m_sunand its distance to the observer d_l = 5.5 +/- 0.4 kpc. this is only the seconddetermination of a reasonably precise (&lt;30%) mass estimate for an isolatedunseen object, using any method. this allows us to calculate the planetarydetection efficiency in physical units (r_\perp, m_p), where r_\perp is theprojected planet-star separation and m_p is the planet mass. when computingplanet detection efficiency, we did not find any planetary signature and ourdetection efficiency results reveal significant sensitivity to neptune-massplanets, and to a lesser extent earth-mass planets in some configurations.indeed, jupiter and neptune-mass planets are excluded with a high confidencefor a large projected separation range between the planet and the lens star,respectively [0.6 - 10] and [1.4 - 4] au, and earth-mass planets are excludedwith a 10% confidence in the lensing zone, i.e. [1.8 - 3.1] au.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

1101.3312	binary microlensing event ogle-2009-blg-020 gives a verifiable mass,  distance and orbit predictions	we present the first example of binary microlensing for which the parametermeasurements can be verified (or contradicted) by future doppler observations.this test is made possible by a confluence of two relatively unusualcircumstances. first, the binary lens is bright enough (i=15.6) to permitdoppler measurements. second, we measure not only the usual 7 binary-lensparameters, but also the 'microlens parallax' (which yields the binary mass)and two components of the instantaneous orbital velocity. thus we measure,effectively, 6 'kepler+1' parameters (two instantaneous positions, twoinstantaneous velocities, the binary total mass, and the mass ratio). sincedoppler observations of the brighter binary component determine 5 keplerparameters (period, velocity amplitude, eccentricity, phase, and position ofperiapsis), while the same spectroscopy yields the mass of the primary, thecombined doppler + microlensing observations would be overconstrained by 6 + (5+ 1) - (7 + 1) = 4 degrees of freedom. this makes possible an extremely strongtest of the microlensing solution. we also introduce a uniform microlensingnotation for single and binary lenses, we define conventions, summarize allknown microlensing degeneracies and extend a set of parameters to describe fullkeplerian motion of the binary lenses.

1208.2323	microlensig binaries with candidate brown dwarf companions	brown dwarfs are important objects because they may provide a missing linkbetween stars and planets, two populations that have dramatically differentformation history. in this paper, we present the candidate binaries with browndwarf companions that are found by analyzing binary microlensing eventsdiscovered during 2004 - 2011 observation seasons. based on the low mass ratiocriterion of q &lt; 0.2, we found 7 candidate events, including ogle-2004-blg-035,ogle-2004-blg-039, ogle-2007-blg-006, ogle-2007-blg-399/moa-2007-blg-334,moa-2011-blg-104/ogle-2011-blg-0172, moa-2011-blg-149, andmoa-201-blg-278/ogle-2011-blg-012n. among them, we are able to confirm that thecompanions of the lenses of moa-2011-blg-104/ogle-2011-blg-0172 andmoa-2011-blg-149 are brown dwarfs by determining the mass of the lens based onthe simultaneous measurement of the einstein radius and the lens parallax. themeasured mass of the brown dwarf companions are (0.02 +/- 0.01) m_sun and(0.019 +/- 0.002) m_sun for moa-2011-blg-104/ogle-2011-blg-0172 andmoa-2011-blg-149, respectively, and both companions are orbiting low mass mdwarf host stars. more microlensing brown dwarfs are expected to be detected asthe number of lensing events with well covered light curves increases with newgeneration searches.

(1997) and ogle udalski et al. (1994)groups, and are higher than predicted by contemporary galactic models. we showthat our observed event timescale distribution is consistent with thedistribution expected from normal mass stars, if we adopt the stellar massfunction of scalo (1986) as our lens mass function. however, we note that asthere is still disagreement about the exact form of the stellar mass function,there is uncertainty in this conclusion. based on our event timescaledistribution we find no evidence for the existence of a large population ofbrown dwarfs in the direction of the galactic bulge.

astro-ph;0005361	the macho project lmc variable star inventory. ix. frequency analysis of  the first overtone rr lyrae stars and the indication for nonradial pulsations	more than 1300 variables classified provisionally as first overtone rr lyraepulsators in the macho variable star database of the large magellanic cloud(lmc) have been subjected to standard frequency analysis. based on the remnantpower in the prewhitened spectra, we found 70% of the total population to bemonoperiodic. the remaining 30% (411 stars) are classified as one of 9 typesaccording to their frequency spectra. several types of rr lyrae pulsationalbehavior are clearly identified here for the first time. together with theearlier discovered double-mode (fundamental &amp; first overtone) variables thisstudy increased the number of the known double-mode stars in the lmc to 181.during the total 6.5yr time span of the data, 10% of the stars show strongperiod changes. we also discovered two additional types of multifrequencypulsators with low occurrence rates of 2% for each. in the first type thereremains one closely spaced component after prewhitening by the main pulsationfrequency. in the second type the number of remnant components is two, they arealso closely spaced, and, in addition, they are symmetric in their frequencyspacing relative to the central component. this latter type of variables isassociated with their relatives among the fundamental pulsators, known asblazhko variables. their high frequency (~20%) among the fundamental modevariables versus the low occurrence rate of their first overtone counterpartsmakes it more difficult to explain blazhko phenomenon by any theory dependingmainly on the role of aspect angle or magnetic field. current theoreticalmodels invoke nonradial pulsation components in these stars.

astro-ph;0008282	the macho project hubble space telescope follow-up: preliminary results  on the location of the large magellanic cloud microlensing source stars	we attempt to determine whether the macho microlensing source stars are drawnfrom the average population of the lmc or from a population behind the lmc byexamining the hst color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of microlensing source stars.we present wfpc2 hst photometry of eight macho microlensing source stars andthe surrounding fields in the lmc. the microlensing source stars are identifiedby deriving accurate centroids in the ground-based macho images usingdifference image analysis (dia) and then transforming the dia coordinates tothe hst frame. we consider in detail a model for the background population ofsource stars based on that presented by zhao, graff &amp; guhathakurta. in thismodel, the source stars have an additional reddening &lt;e(b-v)&gt; = 0.13 mag and aslightly larger distance modulus &lt;delta mu&gt; ~ 0.3 mag than the average lmcpopulation. we also investigate a series of source star models, varying therelative fraction of source stars drawn from the average and backgroundpopulations and the displacement of the background population from the lmc. dueto the small number of analyzed events the distribution of probabilities ofdifferent models is rather flat. a shallow maximum occurs at a fraction s_lmc ~0.8 of the source stars in the lmc. this is consistent with the interpretationthat a significant fraction of observed microlensing events are due to lensesin the milky way halo, but does not definitively exclude other models.

astro-ph;0012163	macho 96-lmc-2: lensing of a binary source in the lmc and constraints on  the lensing object	we present photometry and analysis of the microlensing alert macho 96-lmc-2.the ~3% photometry provided by the global microlensing alert network follow--upeffort reveals a periodic modulation in the lightcurve. we attribute this tobinarity of the lensed source. microlensing fits to a rotating binary sourcemagnified by a single lens converge on two minima, separated by delta chi^2 ~1. the most significant fit x1 predicts a primary which contributes ~100% ofthe light, a dark secondary, and an orbital period (t) of 9.2 days. the secondfit x2 yields a binary source with two stars of roughly equal mass andluminosity, and t = 21.2 days.  the lensed object appears to lie on the upper lmc main sequence. we estimatethe mass of the primary component of the binary system, m ~2 m_sun. for thepreferred model x1, we explore the range of dark companions by assuming 0.1m_sun and 1.4 m_sun objects in models x1a and x1b, respectively. we find lensvelocities projected to the lmc in these models of v^hat_x1a = 18.3 +/- 3.1km/s and v^hat_x1b = 188 +/- 32 k/ms. in both these cases, a likelihoodanalysis suggests an lmc lens is preferred over a galactic halo lens, althoughonly marginally so in model x1b. we also find v^hat_x2 = 39.6 +/- 6.1 k/ms,where the likelihood for the lens location is strongly dominated by the lmcdisk. in all cases, the lens mass is consistent with that of an m-dwarf. thelmc self-lensing rate contributed by 96-lmc-2 is consistent with modelself-lensing rates.

astro-ph;0109467	gravitational microlensing events due to stellar mass black holes	we present an analysis of the longest timescale microlensing eventsdiscovered by the macho collaboration during a 7 year survey of the galacticbulge. we find 6 events that exhibit very strong microlensing parallax signalsdue, in part, to accurate photometric data from the gman and mpscollaborations. the microlensing parallax fit parameters are used in alikelihood analysis, which is able to estimate the distance and masses of thelens objects based upon a standard model of the galactic velocity distribution.this analysis indicates that the most likely masses of 5 of the 6 lenses are &gt;1 msun, which suggests that a substantial fraction of the galactic lenses maybe massive stellar remnants. this could explain the observed excess of longtimescale microlensing events. the lenses for events macho-96-blg-5 andmacho-98-blg-6 are the most massive, with mass estimates of m/msun = 6 +10/-3and m/msun = 6 +7/-3, respectively. the observed upper limits on the absolutebrightness of main sequence stars for these lenses are &lt; 1 lsun, so both lensesare black hole candidates. the black hole interpretation is also favored by alikelihood analysis with a bayesian prior using a conventional model for thelens mass function. we consider the possibility that the source stars for someof these 6 events may lie in the foreground or background of the galacticbulge, but we find that this is unlikely. future hst observations of theseevents can either confirm the black hole lens hypothesis or detect the lensstars and provide a direct measurement of their masses. future observations ofsimilar events by sim or the keck or vlti interferometers will allow directmeasurements of the lens masses for stellar remnant lenses as well.

astro-ph;0201481	the macho project lmc variable star inventory: xii. three cepheid  variables in eclipsing binaries	we present a method for solving the lightcurve of an eclipsing binary systemwhich contains a cepheid variable as one of its components as well as thesolutions for three eclipsing cepheids in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). ageometric model is constructed in which the component stars are assumed to bespherical and on circular orbits. the emergent system flux is computed as afunction of time, with the intrinsic variations in temperature and radius ofthe cepheid treated self-consistently. fitting the adopted model to photometricobservations, incorporating data from multiple bandpasses, yields a singleparameter set best describing the system. this method is applied to threeeclipsing cepheid systems from the macho project lmc database: macho id's6.6454.5, 78.6338.24 and 81.8997.87. a best-fit value is obtained for eachsystem's orbital period and inclination and for the relative radius, color andlimb-darkening coefficients of each star. pulsation periods andparameterizations of the intrinsic color variations of the cepheids are alsoobtained and the amplitude of the radial pulsation of each cepheid is measureddirectly. the system 6.6454.5 is found to contain a 4.97-day cepheid, whichcannot be definitely classified as type i or type ii, with an unexpectedlybrighter companion. the system 78.6338.24 consists of a 17.7-day, w vir classtype ii cepheid with a smaller, dimmer companion. the system 81.8997.87contains an intermediate-mass, 2.03-day overtone cepheid with a dimmer, redgiant secondary.

astro-ph;0304464	recent microlensing results from the macho project	we describe a few recent microlensing results from the macho collaboration.the aim of the macho project was the identification and quantitativedescription of dark and luminous matter in the milky way using microlensingtoward the magellanic clouds and galactic bulge. we start with a discussion ofthe hst follow-up observations of the microlensing events toward the lmcdetected in the first 5 years of the experiment. using color-magnitude diagramswe attempt to distinguish between two possible locations of the microlensingsources: 1) in the lmc or 2) behind the lmc. we conclude that unless theextinction is extremely patchy, it is very unlikely that most of the lmc eventshave sources behind the lmc. during an examination of the hst images of the 13lmc events we found a very red object next to the source star of event lmc-5.astrometry, microlensing parallax fit, and a spectrum suggest that in this casewe directly image the lens - a low-mass disk star.  then we focus on the majority of events observed by the macho project, whichare detected toward the galactic bulge. we argue that the microlensing opticaldepth toward the bulge is best measured using events that have clump giantsources, which are almost unaffected by blending. from this sample we derive alow optical depth toward the galactic bulge of (1.4 +/- 0.3) x 10^{-6}, in goodagreement with other observational constraints and with theoretical models. thepresence of many long-duration events among the bulge candidates allows us toinvestigate the microlensing parallax effect. events with the strongestparallax signal are probably due to massive remnants. events macho-96-blg-5 andmacho-98-blg-6 might have been caused by the 6-solar-mass black holes.

astro-ph;0306151	djehuty, a code for modeling stars in three dimensions	current practice in stellar evolution is to employ one-dimensionalcalculations that quantitatively apply only to a minority of the observed stars(single non-rotating stars, or well detached binaries). even in these systems,astrophysicists are dependent on approximations to handle complexthree-dimensional processes like convection. understanding the structure ofbinary stars, like those that lead to the type ia supernovae used to measurethe expansion of the universe, are grossly non-spherical and await a 3dtreatment.  to approach very large problems like multi-dimensional modeling of stars, thelawrence livermore national laboratory has invested in massively parallelcomputers and invested even more in developing the algorithms to utilize themon complex physics problems. we have leveraged skills from across the lab todevelop a 3d stellar evolution code, djehuty (after the egyptian god forwriting and calculation) that operates efficiently on platforms with thousandsof nodes, with the best available physical data (opacities, eos, etc.). djehutyhas incorporated all basic physics for modeling stars including an accurateequation of state, radiation transport by diffusion, thermonuclear reactionrates, and hydrodynamics, and we have begun testing it in a number ofapplications.

astro-ph;0308019	the macho project large magellanic cloud variable star inventory. xi.  frequency analysis of the fundamental mode rr lyrae stars	we have frequency analyzed 6391 variables classified earlier as fundamentalmode rr lyrae (rr0) stars in the macho database on the large magellanic cloud(lmc). the overwhelming majority of these variables have been proved to beindeed rr0 stars, whereas the remaining ones have fallen in one of thefollowing categories: single- and double-mode cepheids, binaries, firstovertone and double-mode rr lyrae stars and non-classified variables. specialattention has been paid to the blazhko stars. we found altogether 731 blazhkovariables showing either a doublet or an equidistant triplet pattern at themain pulsation component in their frequency spectra. the incidence rate of theblazhko variables among the rr0 stars in the lmc is 11.9%, which is three timeshigher than their rate among the first overtone rr lyrae stars. from thefrequency spectra we found that variables with larger modulation amplitudes atthe higher frequency side of the main pulsation component are three times morefrequent than the ones showing the opposite amplitude pattern. a search madefor a modulation component with the blazhko period in the average brightness ofthe individual variables showed the existence of such a modulation with anoverall amplitude of ~0.006 mag. on the other hand, a similar search forquadruple modulation patterns around the main pulsation component have failedto clearly detect such components at the ~0.004 mag level. this means that theamplitudes of the quadruple components should be, on the average, at least tentimes smaller than those of the triplet components. this finding and theexistence of blazhko variables with highly asymmetric modulation amplitudes notonly question the validity of the magnetic oblique rotator model, but also putsstringent constraints on models based on mode coupling theories.

astro-ph;0310281	the macho project large magellanic cloud variable star inventory. xiii.  fourier parameters for the first overtone rr lyrae variables and the lmc  distance	fourier coefficents have been derived for the $v$ and $r$ light curves of 785overtone rr lyrae variables in 16 macho fields near the bar of the lmc. the$\phi_{31}$ and $r_{21}$ coefficients have been compared with those of thefirst overtone rr lyrae variables in the galactic globular clusters ngc 6441,m107, m5, m3, m2, $\omega$ centauri and m68. the results indicate that many ofthe lmc variables have properties similar to the ones in m2, m3, m5 and theoosterhoff type i variables in $\omega$ cen, but they are different from theoosterhoff type ii variables in $\omega$ cen. equations derived fromhydrodynamic pulsation models have been used to calculate the luminosity andtemperature for the 330 bona fide first-overtone variables. the resultsindicate that they have $\log l$ in the range 1.6 to $1.8\lsun$ and $\logt_{eff}$ between 3.85 and 3.87. based on these temperatures, a mean colorexcess $e(v-r) =0.08$ mag, equivalent to $e(b-v)=0.14$ mag, has been estimatedfor these 330 stars. the 80 m5-like variables (selected according to theirlocation in the $\phi_{31}-\log p$ plot) are used to determine a lmc distance.after correcting for the effects of extinction and crowding, a mean apparentmagnitude $&lt;v_0&gt;=18.99 \pm 0.02$ (statistical) $\pm 0.16$ (systematic) has beenestimated for these 80 stars. combining this with a mean absolute magnitude$m_v=0.56\pm 0.06$ for m5-like stars derived from baade-wesselink analyses,main sequence fitting, fourier parameters and the trigonometric parallax of rrlyrae, we derive an lmc distance modulus $\mu=18.43\pm 0.06$ (statistical) $\pm0.16$ (systematic) mag. the large systematic error arises from the difficultiesof correcting for interstellar extinction and for crowding.

astro-ph;0405377	properties of rr lyrae stars in the inner regions of the large  magellanic cloud	we present the radial velocities, metallicities and the k-band magnitudes of74 rr lyrae stars in the inner regions of the lmc. the intermediate resolutionspectra and infrared images were obtained with fors1 at the eso vlt and withthe sofi infrared imager at the eso ntt.  the best 43 rr lyrae with measured velocities yield an observed velocitydispersion of 61+-7 km/s. we obtain a true lmc rr lyrae velocity dispersion of53 km/s, which is higher than the velocity dispersion of any other lmcpopulation previously measured. this is the first empirical evidence for akinematically hot, metal-poor halo in the lmc as discussed in minniti et al.(2003).  using layden's (1994) modification of the delta s method we measured themetallicity for 23 of our stars. the mean value is [fe/h] =-1.46+-0.09 dex. theabsolute magnitudes m_v and m_k of rr lyrae stars are linear functions ofmetallicity. in the v band, our data agree with the olech et al. (2003)relation, in the k band the slope is flatter.  the average apparent v luminosity of 70 rr lyrae stars is &lt;v&gt; = 19.45+-0.04and the average k luminosity of 37 rr lyrae stars is &lt;k&gt;=18.20+-0.06. there isno obvious relation between apparent v magnitude and logp, while the rr lyrae kband magnitudes show a well defined linear trend with logp.  using the bono et al.

astro-ph;0410319	microlensing optical depth towards the galactic bulge using clump giants  from the macho survey	using 7 years of macho survey data, we present a new determination of theoptical depth to microlensing towards the galactic bulge. we select the sampleof 62 microlensing events (60 unique) on clump giant sources and perform adetailed efficiency analysis. we use only the clump giant sources because theseare bright bulge stars and are not as strongly affected by blending as otherevents. using a subsample of 42 clump events concentrated in just 4.5 squaredegrees, we find tau = 2.17^{+0.47}_{-0.38} x 10^{-6} at (l,b) = (1.50, -2.68),somewhat smaller than found in most previous macho studies, but in excellentagreement with recent theoretical predictions. we also present the opticaldepth in each of the 19 fields in which we detected events, and find limits onoptical depth for fields with no events. the errors in optical depth inindividual fields are dominated by poisson noise. we measure optical depthgradients (1.06 +/- 0.71) x 10^{-6} deg^{-1} and (0.29 +/- 0.43) x 10^{-6}deg^{-1} in the galactic latitude b and longitude l directions, respectively.finally, we discuss the possibility of anomalous duration distribution ofevents in the field 104 centered on (l,b) = (3.11, -3.01) as well asinvestigate spatial clustering of events in all fields.

astro-ph;0601563	discovery of a cool planet of 5.5 earth masses through gravitational  microlensing	in the favoured core-accretion model of formation of planetary systems, solidplanetesimals accumulate to build up planetary cores, which then accretenebular gas if they are sufficiently massive. around m-dwarf stars (the mostcommon stars in our galaxy), this model favours the formation of earth-mass toneptune-mass planets with orbital radii of 1 to 10 astronomical units (au),which is consistent with the small number of gas giant planets known to orbitm-dwarf host stars. more than 170 extrasolar planets have been discovered witha wide range of masses and orbital periods, but planets of neptune's mass orless have not hitherto been detected at separations of more than 0.15 au fromnormal stars. here we report the discovery of a 5.5 (+5.5/-2.7) m_earthplanetary companion at a separation of 2.6 (+1.5/-0.6) au from a 0.22(+0.21/-0.11) m_solar m-dwarf star. (we propose to name it ogle-2005-blg-390lb,indicating a planetary mass companion to the lens star of the microlensingevent.) the mass is lower than that of gj876d, although the error bars overlap.our detection suggests that such cool, sub-neptune-mass planets may be morecommon than gas giant planets, as predicted by the core accretion theory.

astro-ph;9309052	possible gravitational microlensing of a star in the large magellanic  cloud	there is now abundant evidence for the presence of large quantities of unseenmatter surrounding normal galaxies, including our own$^{1,2}$. the nature ofthis `dark matter' is unknown, except that it cannot be made of normal stars,dust, or gas, as they would be easily detected. exotic particles such asaxions, massive neutrinos or other weakly interacting massive particles(collectively known as wimps) have been proposed)$^{3,4}$, but have yet to bedetected. a less exotic alternative is normal matter in the form of bodies withmasses ranging from that of a large planet to a few $ \msun$. such objects,known collectively as massive compact halo objects$^5$ (machos) might be browndwarfs or `jupiters' (bodies too small to produce their own energy by fusion),neutron stars, old white dwarfs, or black holes. paczynski$^6$ suggested thatmachos might act as gravitational microlenses, occasionally causing theapparent brightness of distant background stars temporarily to increase. we areconducting a microlensing experiment to determine whether the dark matter haloof our galaxy is made up of machos. here we report a candidate for amicrolensing event, detected by monitoring the light curves of 1.8 millionstars in the large magellanic cloud for one year. the light curve shows novariation for most of the year of data taking, and an upward excursion lastingover 1 month, with a maximum increase of $\approx \bf 2$ mag. the most probablelens mass, inferred from the duration of the event, is $\bf \sim 0.1 \,\msun$.

astro-ph;9411019	theory of exploring the dark halo with microlensing 1: power--law models	the detection of microlensing has opened the way for the development of newmethods in galactic astronomy. this series of papers investigates whatmicrolensing can teach us about the structure and shape of the dark halo. inthis paper we present formulas for the microlensing rate, optical depth andevent duration distributions for a simple set of axisymmetric disk-halo models.the halos are based on the "power--law models" which have simple velocitydistributions. using these models, we show that there is a large uncertainty inthe predicted microlensing rate because of uncertainty in the halo parameters.for example, models which reproduce the measured galactic observables to withintheir errors still differ in microlensing rate towards the magellanic clouds bymore than a factor of ten. we find that while the more easily computed opticaldepth correlates well with microlensing rate, the ratio of optical depth torate can vary by a factor of two (or greater if the disk is maximal).comparison of microlensing rates towards the large and small magellanic clouds(lmc and smc) and m31 can be used to aid determinations of the halo flatteningand rotation curve slope. for example, the ratio of microlensing rates towardsthe lmc and smc is $\sim 0.7-0.8$ for e0 halos and $\sim 1.0 - 1.2$ for e7halos (c.f. sackett \&amp; gould 1993). once the flattening has been established,the ratio of microlensing rates towards m31 and the lmc may help to distinguishbetween models with rising, flat or falling rotation curves. comparison ofrates along lmc and galactic bulge lines-of-sight gives useful information onthe halo core radius, although this may not be so easy to extract in practice.maximal disk models provide substantially smaller halo optical depths, shorterevent durations and even larger model uncertainties.

astro-ph;9506114	first observation of parallax in a gravitational microlensing event	we present the first detection of parallax effects in a gravitationalmicrolensing event. parallax in a gravitational microlensing event observedonly from the earth appears as a distortion of the lightcurve due to the motionof the earth around the sun. this distortion can be detected if the eventduration is not much less than a year and if the projected velocity of the lensis not much larger than the orbital velocity of the earth about the sun. theevent presented here has a duration of 220 days and clearly shows thedistortion due to the earth's motion. we find that the projected velocity ofthe lens is 75+/-5 km/s at an angle of 28+/-4 deg from the direction ofincreasing galactic longitude, as expected for a lens in the galactic disk.  a likelihood analysis yields estimates of the distance to and mass of thelens: d_{lens} = 1.7 (+1.1/-0.7) kpc and m = 1.3 (+1.3/-0.6) msun, suggestingthat the lens is a remnant such as a white dwarf or neutron star. a less likelypossibility is that the lens is a main sequence star. if so, we can add ourupper limit on the observed flux from the lens to the analysis. this modifiesthe estimates to: d_{lens} = 2.8 (+1.1/-0.6) kpc, and m = 0.6 (+0.4/-0.2) msun.

astro-ph;9512146	the macho project: 45 candidate microlensing events from the first year  galactic bulge data	we report the detection of 45 candidate microlensing events in fields towardthe galactic bulge. these come from the analysis of 24 fields containing 12.6million stars observed for 190 days in 1993. many of these events are ofextremely high signal to noise and are remarkable examples of gravitationalmicrolensing. the distribution of peak magnifications is shown to be consistentwith the microlensing interpretation of these events. using a sub-sample of 1.3million ``clump giant" stars whose distance and detection efficiency are wellknown, we find 13 events and estimate the microlensing optical depth toward thegalactic bulge as $\tau_{\rm bulge} = 3.9 {+ 1.8 \atop - 1.2} \times 10^{-6}$averaged over an area of $\sim 12$ square degrees centered at galacticcoordinates $\ell = 2.55^\circ$ and $b = -3.64^\circ$. this is similar to thevalue reported by the ogle collaboration, and is marginally higher than currenttheoretical models for $\tau_{\rm bulge}$. the optical depth is also seen toincrease significantly for decreasing $\vert b\vert$. these results demonstratethat obtaining large numbers of microlensing events toward the galactic bulgeis feasible, and that the study of such events will have important consequencesfor the structure of the galaxy and its dark halo.

astro-ph;9604176	the macho project: limits on planetary mass dark matter in the galactic  halo from gravitational microlensing	the macho project has been monitoring about ten million stars in the largemagellanic cloud in the search for gravitational microlensing events caused bymassive compact halo objects (machos) in the halo of the milky way. in ourstandard analysis, we have searched this data set for well sampled, longduration microlensing lightcurves, detected several microlensing eventsconsistent with machos in the 0.1 &lt; m &lt; 1.0 m_sun mass range, and set limits onthe abundance of objects with masses 1e-5 &lt; m &lt; 0.1 m_sun. in this paper, wepresent a different type of analysis involving the search for very short timescale brightenings of stars which is used to set strong limits on the abundanceof lower mass machos. our analysis of the first two years of data toward thelmc indicates that machos with masses in the range 2.5e-7 &lt; m &lt; 5.2e-4 m_suncannot make up the entire mass of a standard spherical dark halo. combiningthese results with those from the standard analysis, we find that the halo darkmatter may not be comprised of objects with masses 2.5e-7 &lt; m &lt; 8.1e-2 m_sun.

astro-ph;9604177	the macho project lmc variable star inventory: iii. new r coronae  borealis stars	we report the discovery of two new r coronae borealis (rcb) stars in thelarge magellanic cloud (lmc) using the macho project photometry database. theidentification of both stars has been confirmed spectroscopically. one is acool rcb star (t_eff about 5000 k) characterized by very strong swan bands ofc_2 and violet bands of cn, and weak or absent balmer lines, g-band and 12c-13cbands. the second star is an example of a hot rcb star of which only 3 werepreviously known to exist in the galaxy and none in the lmc. its spectrum ischaracterized by several c ii lines in emission. both stars have shown deepdeclines of delta v &gt; 4 mag in brightness. the new stars are significantlyfainter at maximum light than the three previously known lmc rcb stars. theamount of reddening toward these stars is somewhat uncertain but both seem tohave absolute magnitudes, m_v, about half a magnitude fainter than the otherthree stars. estimates of m_bol find that the hot rcb star lies in the range ofthe other three stars while the cool rcb star is fainter. the two cool lmc rcbstars are the faintest at m_bol. the discovery of these two new stars brings tofive the number of known rcb stars in the lmc and demonstrates the utility ofthe macho photometric database for the discovery of new rcb stars.

astro-ph;9606012	a binary lensing event toward the lmc: observations and dark matter  implications	the macho collaboration has recently analyzed 2.1 years of photometric datafor about 8.5 million stars in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). this analysishas revealed 8 candidate microlensing events and a total microlensing opticaldepth of $\tau_{meas} = 2.9 +1.4/-0.9 \times 10^{-7}$. this significantlyexceeds the number of events (1.1) and the microlensing optical depth predictedfrom known stellar populations: $\tau_{back} = 5.4\times 10^{-8}$, but it isconsistent with models in which about half of the standard dark halo mass iscomposed of machos of mass $\sim 0.5 \msun$. one of these 8 events appears tobe a binary lensing event with a caustic crossing that is partially resolvedwhich allows us to estimate the distance to the lenses. if the source star isnot a short period binary star, then we show that the lens system is verylikely to reside in the lmc. however, if we assume that the optical depth forlmc-lmc lensing is large enough to account for our entire lensing signal, thenthe binary event does not appear to be consistent with lensing of a single lmcsource star by a binary residing in the lmc. thus, while the binary lens mayindeed reside in the lmc, there is no indication that most of the lenses residein the lmc.

astro-ph;9606134	the macho project 2nd year lmc microlensing results and dark matter  implications	the macho project is searching for galactic dark matter in the form ofmassive compact halo objects (machos). millions of stars in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc), small magellanic cloud (smc), and galactic bulge arephotometrically monitored in an attempt to detect rare gravitationalmicrolensing events caused by otherwise invisible machos. analysis of two yearsof photometry on 8.5 million stars in the lmc reveals 8 candidate microlensingevents, far more than the $\sim1$ event expected from lensing by low-mass starsin known galactic populations. from these eight events we estimate the opticaldepth towards the lmc from events with $2 &lt; \that &lt; 200$ days to be$\tau_2^{200} \approx 2.9 ^{+1.4}_{-0.9} \ten{-7}$. this exceeds the opticaldepth of $0.5\ten{-7}$ expected from known stars and is to be compared with anoptical depth of $4.7\ten{-7}$ predicted for a ``standard'' halo composedentirely of machos. the total mass in this lensing population is $\approx2^{+1.2}_{-0.7} \ten{11} \msun$ (within 50 kpc from the galactic center). eventtimescales yield a most probable macho mass of $0.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\msun$,although this value is quite model dependent.

astro-ph;9606165	the macho project lmc microlensing results from the first two years and  the nature of the galactic dark halo	the macho project is a search for dark matter in the form of massive compacthalo objects (machos). photometric monitoring of millions of stars in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc), small magellanic cloud (smc), and galactic bulge isused to search for gravitational microlensing events caused by these otherwiseinvisible objects. analysis of the first 2.1 years of photometry of 8.5 millionstars in the lmc reveals 8 candidate microlensing events. this is substantiallymore than the number expected ($\sim 1.1$) from lensing by known stellarpopulations. the timescales ($\that$) of the events range from 34 to 145 days.we estimate the total microlensing optical depth towards the lmc from eventswith $2 &lt; \that &lt; 200$ days to be $\tau_2^{200} = 2.9 ^{+1.4}_{-0.9} \ten{-7}$based upon our 8 event sample. this exceeds the optical depth, $\tau_{\rmbackgnd} = 0.5 \ten{-7}$, expected from known stars, and the difference is tobe compared with the optical depth predicted for a ``standard" halo composedentirely of machos: $\tau_{halo} = 4.7\ten{-7}$. likelihood analysis gives afairly model independent estimate of the halo mass in machos within 50 kpc of$2.0^{+1.2}_{-0.7} \ten{11} \msun$, about half of the ``standard halo" value.we also find a most probable macho mass of $0.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\msun$, althoughthis value is strongly model dependent. additionally, the absence of shortduration events places stringent upper limits on the contribution of low-massmachos: objects from $10^{-4} \msun$ to $0.03 \msun$ contribute $\simlt 20\%$of the ``standard" dark halo.

astro-ph;9702199	macho alert 95-30 : first real-time observation of extended source  effects in gravitational microlensing	we present analysis of macho alert 95-30, a dramatic gravitationalmicrolensing event towards the galactic bulge whose peak magnification departssignificantly from the standard point-source microlensing model. alert 95-30was observed in real-time by the global microlensing alert network (gman),which obtained densely sampled photometric and spectroscopic data throughoutthe event. we interpret the light-curve ``fine structure'' as indicatingtransit of the lens across the extended face of the source star. this signifiesresolution of a star several kpc distant. we find a lens angular impactparameter theta_{min}/theta_{source} = 0.715 +/- 0.003. this information, alongwith the radius and distance of the source, provides an additional constrainton the lensing system. spectroscopic and photometric data indicate the sourceis an m4 iii star of radius 61 +/- 12 rsun, located on the far side of thebulge at 9 kpc. we derive a lens angular velocity, relative to the source, of21.5 +/- 4.9 km/s/kpc, where the error is dominated by uncertainty in thesource radius. likelihood analysis yields a median lens mass of0.67{+2.53}{-0.46} msun, located with 80% probability in the galactic bulge ata distance of 6.93{+1.56}{-2.25} kpc. if the lens is a main-sequence star, wecan include constraints on the lens luminosity. this modifies our estimates tom_lens = 0.53{+0.52}{-0.35} msun and d_lens = 6.57{+0.99}{-2.25} kpc. spectrataken during the event show that the absorption line equivalent widths of halpha and the tio bands near 6700 a vary, as predicted for microlensing of anextended source. this is most likely due to center-to-limb variation in thestellar spectral lines. these data demonstrate the feasibility of usingmicrolensing limb crossings as a tool to probe stellar atmospheres directly.

astro-ph;9807163	discovery and characterization of a caustic crossing microlensing event  in the smc	we present photometric observations and analysis of the second microlensingevent detected towards the small magellanic cloud (smc), macho alert 98-smc-1.this event was detected early enough to allow intensive observation of thelightcurve. these observations revealed 98-smc-1 to be the first causticcrossing, binary microlensing event towards the magellanic clouds to bediscovered in progress.  frequent coverage of the evolving lightcurve allowed an accurate predictionfor the date of the source crossing out of the lens caustic structure. thecaustic crossing temporal width, along with the angular size of the sourcestar, measures the proper motion of the lens with respect to the source, andthus allows an estimate of the location of the lens. lenses located in thegalactic halo would have a velocity projected to the smc of v^hat ~1500 km/s,while an smc lens would typically have v^hat ~60 km/s.  we have performed a joint fit to the macho/gman data presented here,including recent eros data of this event. these joint data are sufficient toconstrain the time for the lens to move an angle equal to the source angularradius; 0.116 +/- 0.010 days. we estimate a radius for the lensed source of 1.4+/- 0.1 r_sun. this yields a projected velocity of v^hat = 84 +/- 9 km/s. only0.15% of halo lenses would be expected to have a v^hat value at least as smallas this, while 31% of smc lenses would be expected to have v^hat as large asthis. this implies that the lensing system is more likely to reside in the smcthan in the galactic halo.

astro-ph;9903215	difference image analysis of galactic microlensing i. data analysis	this is a preliminary report on the application of difference image analysis(dia) to galactic bulge images. the aim of this analysis is to increase thesensitivity to the detection of gravitational microlensing. we discuss how thedia technique simplifies the process of discovering microlensing events bydetecting only objects which have variable flux. we illustrate how the diatechnique is not limited to detection of so called ``pixel lensing'' events,but can also be used to improve photometry for classical microlensing events byremoving the effects of blending. we will present a method whereby dia can beused to reveal the true unblended colours, positions and light curves ofmicrolensing events. we discuss the need for a technique to obtain the accuratemicrolensing time scales from blended sources, and present a possible solutionto this problem using the existing hst colour magnitude diagrams of thegalactic bulge and lmc. the use of such a solution with both classical andpixel microlensing searches is discussed. we show that one of the major causesof systematic noise in dia is differential refraction. a technique for removingthis systematic by effectively registering images to a common airmass ispresented. improvements to commonly used image differencing techniques arediscussed.

astro-ph;9909227	calibration of the macho photometry database	the macho project is a microlensing survey that monitors the brightnesses of60 million stars in the large magellanic cloud (lmc), small magellanic cloud,and galactic bulge. our database presently contains about 80 billionphotometric measurements, a significant fraction of all astronomicalphotometry. we describe the calibration of macho two-color photometry andtransformation to the standard kron-cousins v and r system. calibrated machophotometry may be properly compared with all other observations on thekron-cousins standard system, enhancing the astrophysical value of these data.for 9 million stars in the lmc bar, independent photometric measurements of20,000 stars with v &lt; 18 mag in field-overlap regions demonstrate an internalprecision sigv = 0.021, sigr = 0.019, and sig(v-r) = 0.028 mag. the accuracy ofthe zero-point in this calibration is estimated to be +-0.035 mag for starswith colors in the range -0.1 &lt; (v-r) &lt; 1.2 mag. a comparison of calibratedmacho photometry with published photometric sequences and new hubble spacetelescope observations shows agreement. the current calibration zero-pointuncertainty for the remainder of the macho photometry database is estimated tobe +- 0.10 mag in v or r and +-0.04 mag in (v-r). we describe the firstapplication of calibrated macho photometry data: the construction of acolor-magnitude diagram used to calculate our experimental sensitivity todetect microlensing in the lmc.
