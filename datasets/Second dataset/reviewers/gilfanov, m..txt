0901.1346	high-energy particle acceleration at the radio-lobe shock of centaurus a	we present new results on the shock around the southwest radio lobe ofcentaurus a using data from the chandra very large programme observations. thex-ray spectrum of the emission around the outer southwestern edge of the lobeis well described by a single power-law model with galactic absorption --thermal models are strongly disfavoured, except in the region closest to thenucleus. we conclude that a significant fraction of the x-ray emission aroundthe southwest part of the lobe is synchrotron, not thermal. we infer that inthe region where the shock is strongest and the ambient gas density lowest, theinflation of the lobe is accelerating particles to x-ray synchrotron emittingenergies, similar to supernova remnants such as sn1006. this interpretationresolves a problem of our earlier, purely thermal, interpretation for thisemission, namely that the density compression across the shock was required tobe much larger than the theoretically expected factor of 4. we estimate thatthe lobe is expanding to the southwest with a velocity of ~2600 km/s, roughlymach 8 relative to the ambient medium. we discuss the spatial variation ofspectral index across the shock region, concluding that our observationsconstrain gamma_max for the accelerated particles to be 10^8 at the strongestpart of the shock, consistent with expectations from diffusive shockacceleration theory. finally, we consider the implications of these results forthe production of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (uhecrs) and tev emission fromcentaurus a, concluding that the shock front region is unlikely to be asignificant source of uhecrs, but that tev emission from this region isexpected at levels comparable to current limits at tev energies, for plausibleassumed magnetic field strengths.

0906.5364	luminosity functions of lmxbs in centaurus a: globular clusters versus  the field	we study the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) of low mass x-ray binaries(lmxb) in the nearby early-type galaxy centaurus a, concentrating primarily ontwo aspects of binary populations: the xlf behavior at the low luminosity limitand comparison between globular cluster and field sources. the 800 ksecexposure of the deep chandra vlp program allows us to reach a limitingluminosity of 8e35 erg/s, about 2-3 times deeper than previous investigations.we confirm the presence of the low luminosity break in the overall lmxb xlf atlog(l_x)=37.2-37.6 below which the luminosity distribution follows a constantdn/d(ln l). separating globular cluster and field sources, we find astatistically significant difference between the two luminosity distributionswith a relative underabundance of faint sources in the globular clusterpopulation. this demonstrates that the samples are drawn from distinct parentpopulations and may disprove the hypothesis that the entire lmxb population inearly type galaxies is created dynamically in globular clusters. as a plausibleexplanation for this difference in the xlfs, we suggest that there is anenhanced fraction of helium accreting systems in globular clusters, which arecreated in collisions between red giants and neutron stars. due to the 4 timeshigher ionization temperature of he, such systems are subject to accretion diskinstabilities at approximately 20 times higher mass accretion rate, andtherefore are not observed as persistent sources at low luminosities.

0911.2115	long term monitoring of the dynamics and particle acceleration of knots  in the jet of centaurus a	we present new and archival multi-frequency radio and x-ray data forcentaurus a obtained over almost 20 years at the vla and with chandra, withwhich we measure the x-ray and radio spectral indices of jet knots, fluxdensity variations in the jet knots, polarization variations, and propermotions. we compare the observed properties with current knot formation modelsand particle acceleration mechanisms. we rule out impulsive particleacceleration as a formation mechanism for all of the knots as we detect thesame population of knots in all of the observations and we find no evidence ofextreme variability in the x-ray knots. we find the most likely mechanism forall the stationary knots is a collision resulting in a local shock followed bya steady state of prolonged, stable particle acceleration and x-ray synchrotronemission. in this scenario, the x-ray-only knots have radio counterparts thatare too faint to be detected, while the radio-only knots are due to weak shockswhere no particles are accelerated to x-ray emitting energies. although thebase knots are prime candidates for reconfinement shocks, the presence of amoving knot in this vicinity and the fact that there are two base knots arehard to explain in this model. we detect apparent motion in three knots;however, their velocities and locations provide no conclusive evidence for oragainst a faster moving `spine' within the jet. the radio-only knots, bothstationary and moving, may be due to compression of the fluid.

1104.2048	origin: metal creation and evolution from the cosmic dawn	origin is a proposal for the m3 mission call of esa aimed at the study ofmetal creation from the epoch of cosmic dawn. using high-spectral resolution inthe soft x-ray band, origin will be able to identify the physical conditions ofall abundant elements between c and ni to red-shifts of z=10, and beyond. themission will answer questions such as: when were the first metals created? howdoes the cosmic metal content evolve? where do most of the metals reside in theuniverse? what is the role of metals in structure formation and evolution? toreach out to the early universe origin will use gamma-ray bursts (grbs) tostudy their local environments in their host galaxies. this requires thecapability to slew the satellite in less than a minute to the grb location. bystudying the chemical composition and properties of clusters of galaxies we canextend the range of exploration to lower redshifts (z ~ 0.2). for this task weneed a high-resolution spectral imaging instrument with a large field of view.using the same instrument, we can also study the so far only partially detectedbaryons in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim). the less dense part of thewhim will be studied using absorption lines at low redshift in the spectra forgrbs.

1105.4610	x-ray emission from star-forming galaxies - i. high-mass x-ray binaries	based on a homogeneous set of x-ray, infrared and ultraviolet observationsfrom chandra, spitzer, galex and 2mass archives, we study populations ofhigh-mass x-ray binaries (hmxbs) in a sample of 29 nearby star-forming galaxiesand their relation with the star formation rate (sfr). in agreement withprevious results, we find that hmxbs are a good tracer of the recent starformation activity in the host galaxy and their collective luminosity andnumber scale with the sfr, in particular, lx~2.6 10^{39} sfr. however, thescaling relations still bear a rather large dispersion of ~0.4 dex, which webelieve is of a physical origin. we present the catalog of 1057 x-ray sourcesdetected within the $d25$ ellipse for galaxies of our sample and construct theaverage x-ray luminosity function (xlf) of hmxbs with substantially improvedstatistical accuracy and better control of systematic effects than achieved inprevious studies. the xlf follows a power law with slope of 1.6 in theloglx~35-40 luminosity range with a moderately significant evidence for a breakor cut-off at lx~10^{40} erg/s. as before, we did not find any features at theeddington limit for a neutron star or a stellar mass black hole. we discussimplications of our results for the theory of binary evolution. in particularwe estimate the fraction of compact objects that once upon their lifetimeexperienced an x-ray active phase powered by accretion from a high masscompanion and obtain a rather large number, fx~0.2 (0.1 myr/tau_x) (tau_x isthe life time of the x-ray active phase). this is ~4 orders of magnitude morefrequent than in lmxbs. we also derive constrains on the mass distribution ofthe secondary star in hmxbs.

1107.1592	highly absorbed x-ray binaries in the small magellanic cloud	many of the high mass x-ray binaries (hmxrbs) discovered in recent years inour galaxy are characterized by a high absorption, most likely intrinsic to thesystem, which hampers their detection at the softest x-ray energies. we haveundertaken a search for highly-absorbed x-ray sources in the small magellaniccloud (smc) with a systematic analysis of 62 xmm-newton smc observations. weobtained a sample of 30 sources showing evidence for an equivalent hydrogencolumn density larger than 3x10^23 cm^-2. five of these sources are clearlyidentified as hmxrbs: four were already known (including three x-ray pulsars)and one, xmm j005605.8-720012, reported here for the first time. for thelatter, we present optical spectroscopy confirming the association with a bestar in the smc. the other sources in our sample have optical counterpartsfainter than magnitude ~16 in the v band, and many of them have possible nircounterparts consistent with highly reddened early type stars in the smc. whiletheir number is broadly consistent with the expected population of backgroundhighly-absorbed active galactic nuclei, a few of them could be hmxrbs in whichan early type companion is severely reddened by local material.

1108.4420	constraints on the redshift evolution of the l_x-sfr relation from the  cosmic x-ray backgrounds	observations of local star forming galaxies have revealed a correlationbetween the rate at which galaxies form stars and their x-ray luminosity. wecombine this correlation with the most recent observational constraints on theintegrated star formation rate density, and find that star forming galaxiesaccount for 5-20% of the total soft and hard x-ray backgrounds, where theprecise number depends on the energy band and the assumed average x-rayspectral energy distribution of the galaxies below ~20 kev. if we combine thel_x-sfr relation with recently derived star formation rate function, then wefind that star forming galaxies whose x-ray flux falls well (more than a factorof 10) below the detection thresholds of the chandra deep fields, can fullyaccount for the unresolved soft x-ray background, which corresponds to ~6% ofits total. motivated by this result, we put limits on the allowed redshiftevolution of the parameter c_x \equiv l_x/sfr, and/or its evolution towardslower and higher star formation rates. if we parametrize the redshift evolutionof c_x ~ (1+z)^b, then we find that b \leq 1.3 (95% cl). on the other hand, theobserved x-ray luminosity functions (xlfs) of star forming galaxies indicatethat c_x may be increasing towards higher redshifts and/or higher starformation rates at levels that are consistent with the x-ray background, butpossibly at odds with the locally observed l_x-sfr relation.

0710.3059	high mass x-ray binaries and recent star formation history of the small  magellanic cloud	we study the relation between high-mass x-ray binary (hmxb) population andrecent star formation history (sfh) for the small magellanic cloud (smc). usingarchival optical smc observations, we have approximated the color-magnitudediagrams of the stellar population by model stellar populations and, in thisway, reconstructed the spatially resolved sfh of the galaxy over the past 100myr.we analyze the errors and stability of this method for determining therecent sfh and show that uncertainties in the models of massive stars at lateevolutionary stages are the main factor that limits its accuracy. by combiningthe sfh with the spatial distribution of hmxbs obtained from xmm-newtonobservations, we have derived the dependence of the hmxb number on the timeelapsed since the star formation event. the number of young systems with ages10 myr is shown to be smaller than the prediction based on the type-iisupernova rate. the hmxb number reaches its maximum ~20-50 myr after the starformation event. this may be attributable, at least partly, to a low luminositythreshold in the population of x-ray sources studied, lmin~1e+34 erg/s. be/xsystems make a dominant contribution to this population, while the contributionfrom hmxbs with black holes is relatively small.

0710.3504	high-mass x-ray binaries and the spiral structure of the host galaxy	we investigate the manifestation of the spiral structure in the distributionof high-mass x-ray binaries (hmxbs) over the host galaxy. we construct thesimple kinematic model. it shows that the hmxbs should be displaced relative tothe spiral structure observed in such traditional star formation rateindicators as the halpha and fir emissions because of their finite lifetimes.using chandra observations of m51, we have studied the distribution of x-raysources relative to the spiral arms of this galaxy observed in halpha. based onk-band data and background source number counts, we have separated thecontributions from high-mass and low-mass x-ray binaries and active galacticnuclei. in agreement with model predictions, the distribution of hmxbs is widerthan that of bright hii regions concentrated in the region of ongoing starformation. however, the statistical significance of this result is low, as isthe significance of the concentration of the total population of x-ray sourcesto the spiral arms. we also predict the distribution of hmxbs in our galaxy ingalactic longitude. the distribution depends on the mean hmxb age and candiffer significantly from the distributions of such young objects asultracompact hii regions.

1205.3715	x-ray emission from star-forming galaxies - ii. hot interstellar medium	we study the emission from the hot interstellar medium in a sample of nearbylate type galaxies defined in paper i. our sample covers a broad range of starformation rates, from ~0.1 msun/yr to ~17 msun/yr and stellar masses, from~3x10^8 msun to ~6x10^10 msun. we take special care of systematic effects andcontamination from bright and faint compact sources. we find that in allgalaxies at least one optically thin thermal emission component is present inthe unresolved emission, with the average temperature of &lt;kt&gt;= 0.24 kev. inabout ~1/3 of galaxies, a second, higher temperature component is required,with the &lt;kt&gt;= 0.71 kev. although statistically significant variations intemperature between galaxies are present, we did not find any meaningful trendswith the stellar mass or star formation rate of the host galaxy. the apparentluminosity of the diffuse emission in the 0.5-2 kev band linearly correlateswith the star formation rate with the scale factor of lx/sfr\approx 8.3x10^38erg/s per msun/yr, of which in average ~30-40% is likely produced by faintcompact sources of various types. we attempt to estimate the bolometricluminosity of the gas and and obtained results differing by an order ofmagnitude, log(lbol/sfr)\sim39-40, depending on whether intrinsic absorption instar-forming galaxies was allowed or not. our theoretically most accurate, butin practice the most model dependent result for the intrinsic bolometricluminosity of ism is lbol/sfr\sim 1.5x10^40 erg/s per msun/yr. assuming thatcore collapse supernovae are the main source of energy, it implies that\epsilon_sn\sim5x10^-2 (e_sn/10^51)^-1 of mechanical energy of supernovae isconverted into thermal energy of ism.

1208.3611	planck intermediate results. x. physics of the hot gas in the coma  cluster	we present an analysis of planck satellite data on the coma cluster observedvia the sunyaev-zeldovich effect. planck is able, for the first time, to detectsz emission up to r ~ 3 x r_500. we test previously proposed models for thepressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. wefind that the arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit coma, andthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the dataonly at r&lt;r_500: by r=2xr_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by afactor of ~2. this may indicate that at these larger radii either i) thecluster sz emission is contaminated by unresolved sz sources along the line ofsight or ii) the pressure profile of coma is higher at r&gt;r_500 than the meanpressure profile predicted by the simulations. the planck image showssignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half adegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. these featuresare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed thewestern feature was previously noticed in the rosat pspc mosaic as well as inthe radio. using planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we findpressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,respectively. assuming rankine-hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deducethat the shock waves should propagate with mach number m_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 andm_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the west and southeast, respectively. finally, we findthat the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on mpcscales with small intrinsic scatter. this implies either that the energydensity of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster,or that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius thanpreviously thought.

1311.1693	emission line diagnostics to constrain high temperature populations in  early-type galaxies	once thought to be devoid of warm and cold interstellar matter, ellipticalgalaxies are now commonly observed to host extended regions of neutral andionized gas. outside of the innermost nuclear regions of these galaxies, thefavoured candidate ionizing source remains some component of the stellarpopulation, with mounting evidence suggesting post-asymptotic-giant-branchstars (pagbs). in a recent paper, we demonstrated that observations ofrecombination lines of he ii (or upper limits thereof) may provide a strongconstraint on the presence of any other, higher temperature ionizing sources,in particular nuclear-burning white dwarfs in the context of the singledegenerate (sd) scenario for type ia supernovae. the sensitivity of the heiitest is greatest for wd effective temperatures ~ 2 x 10^5 k. here we extend ouranalysis to include predictions for all of the "classical" strong opticallines, as well as uv, optical, and infra-red lines of neutral oxygen, nitrogen,and singly-ionized carbon. this allows us to extend the temperature range overwhich we can meaningfully constrain the collective luminosity ofnuclear-burning wds to 10^5 k &lt;~ t &lt;~ 10^6 k. we then demonstrate howobservations of nearby early-type and post-starburst galaxies can place stronglimits on the origin of type ia supernovae.

1312.4170	impact of thermal diffusion and other abundance anomalies on  cosmological uses of galaxy clusters	depending on the topology of the magnetic field and characteristics ofturbulent motions, diffusion can significantly affect the distribution ofelements, in particular helium, in the intracluster medium (icm). as has beennoted previously, an incorrect assumption about the helium abundance will leadto an error in the iron abundance determined from x-ray spectroscopy. thecorresponding effect on the temperature measurement is negligibly small. anincorrectly assumed helium abundance will also lead to a systematic error inangular distance measurements based on x-ray and sunyaev-zeldovich (sz)observations of clusters of galaxies. its magnitude is further amplified by theassociated error in the metal abundance determination, the impact being largerat lower icm temperatures. overall, a factor of 2-5 error in the heliumabundance will lead to an ~ 10-25 % error in the angular distance.  we solve the full set of burgers equations for a multi-component intraclusterplasma to determine the maximal effect of diffusion on the interpretation ofx-ray and microwave observations of clusters of galaxies. for an isothermalcluster, gravitational sedimentation can lead to up to a factor of ~ 5-10enhancements of helium and metal abundances in the cluster center on a ~ 3-7gyr timescale. in cool-core clusters on the contrary, thermal diffusion cancounteract gravitational sedimentation and effectively remove helium and metalsfrom the cluster inner core. in either case, a significant, up to ~ 40 %, errorin the metal abundances determined by means of x-ray spectroscopy is possible.the angular distance determined from x-ray and sz data can be underestimated byup to ~ 10-25 %.

1402.2896	upper limits on the luminosity of the progenitor of type ia supernova  sn2014j	we analysed archival data of chandra pre-explosion observations of theposition of sn2014j in m82. no x-ray source at this position was detected inthe data, and we calculated upper limits on the luminosities of the progenitor.these upper limits allow us to firmly rule out an unobscured supersoft x-raysource progenitor with a photospheric radius comparable to the radius of whitedwarf near the chandrasekhar mass (~1.38 m_sun) and mass accretion rate in theinterval where stable nuclear burning can occur. however, due to a relativelylarge hydrogen column density implied by optical observations of the supernova,we cannot exclude a supersoft source with lower temperatures, kt &lt; 80 ev. wefind that the supernova is located in the centre of a large structure of softdiffuse emission, about 200 pc across. the mass, ~3x10^4 m_sun and shortcooling time of the gas, tau_cool ~ 8 myrs, suggest that it is asupernova-inflated super-bubble, associated with the region of recent starformation. if sn2014j is indeed located inside the bubble, it likely belongs tothe prompt population of type ia supernovae, with a delay time as short as ~ 50myrs. finally, we analysed the one existing post-supernova chandra observationand placed upper limit of ~ (1-2) 10^37 erg/s on the x-ray luminosity of thesupernova itself.

(ii) soft emission from ionized gas with temperatureof about ~ 300 ev and mass of ~ 2 x 10^6 m_sun. the gas distribution issignificantly extended along the minor axis of the galaxy suggesting that itmay be outflowing in the direction perpendicular to the galactic disk. the massand energy supply from evolved stars and type ia supernovae is sufficient tosustain the outflow. we also detect a shadow cast on the gas emission by spiralarms and the 10-kpc star-forming ring, confirming significant extent of the gasin the ``vertical'' direction. (iii) hard extended emission from spiral arms,most likely associated with young stellar objects and young stars located inthe star-forming regions. the l_x/sfr ratio equals ~ 9 x 10^38(erg/s)/(m_sun/yr) which is about ~ 1/3 of the hmxbs contribution, determinedearlier from chandra observations of other nearby galaxies.

1508.03194	population synthesis of accreting white dwarfs: ii. x-ray and uv  emission	accreting white dwarfs (wds) with non-degenerate companions are expected toemit in soft x-rays and the uv, if accreted h-rich material burns stably. theyare an important component of the unresolved emission of elliptical galaxies,and their combined ionizing luminosity may significantly influence the opticalline emission from warm ism. in an earlier paper we modeled populations ofaccreting wds, first generating wd with main-sequence, hertzsprung gap and redgiant companions with the population synthesis code \textsc{bse}, and thenfollowing their evolution with a grid of evolutionary tracks computed with\textsc{mesa}. now we use these results to estimate the soft x-ray(0.3-0.7kev), h- and he ii-ionizing luminosities of nuclear burning wds and thenumber of super-soft x-ray sources for galaxies with different star formationhistories. for the starburst case, these quantities peak at $\sim 1$ gyr anddecline by $\sim 1-3$ orders of magnitude by the age of 10 gyr. for stellarages of $\sim$~10 gyr, predictions of our model are consistent with soft x-rayluminosities observed by chandra in nearby elliptical galaxies and he ii4686$\aa/\rm{h}{\beta}$ line ratio measured in stacked sdss spectra of retiredgalaxies, the latter characterising the strength and hardness of the uvradiation field. however, the soft x-ray luminosity andhe~ii~4686$\aa/\rm{h}{\beta}$ ratio are significantly overpredicted for stellarages of $\lesssim 4-8$ gyr. we discuss various possibilities to resolve thisdiscrepancy and tentatively conclude that it may be resolved by a modificationof the typically used criteria of dynamically unstable mass loss for giantstars.

astro-ph;0001450	frequency resolved spectroscopy of cyg x-1: fast variability of the  reflected emission in the soft state	using the rxte/pca data we study the fast variability of the reflectedemission in the soft spectral state of cyg x-1 by means of fourier frequencyresolved spectroscopy. we find that the rms amplitude of variations of thereflected emission has the same frequency dependence as the primary radiationdown to time scales of &lt;30-50 msec. this might indicate that the reflected fluxreproduces, with nearly flat response, variations of the primary emission. suchbehavior differs notably from the hard spectral state, in which variations ofthe reflected flux are significantly suppressed in comparison with the primaryemission, on time scales shorter than ~0.5-1 sec. if related to the finitelight crossing time of the reflector, these results suggest that thecharacteristic size of the reflector -- presumably an optically thick accretiondisk, in the hard spectral state is larger by a factor of &gt;5-10 than in thesoft spectral state. modeling the transfer function of the disk, we estimatethe inner radius of the accretion disk r_in~100r_g in the hard and r_in&lt;10r_gin the soft state for a 10m_sun black hole.

astro-ph;0006227	soft state of cygnus x-1: stable disk and unstable corona	two component x-ray spectra (soft multicolor black body plus harder powerlaw) are frequently observed from accreting black holes. these components arepresumably associated with the different parts of the accretion flow (opticallythick and optically thin respectively) in the vicinity of the compact source.most of the aperiodic variability of the x-ray flux on the short time scales isassociated with the harder component. we suggest that drastically differentamplitudes of variability of these two components are simply related to thevery different viscous time scales in the geometrically thin and geometricallythick parts of the accretion flow. in the geometrically thin disks variationsof viscosity or mass accretion rate occurring at large radius from the blackhole on the local dynamical or thermal time scales do not cause any significantvariations of the mass accretion rate at smaller radii due to a very longdiffusion time. any variations on the time scales shorter than the diffusiontime scale are effectively dampened. on the contrary such variations can easilysurvive in the geometrically thick flows and as a result the mass accretionrate in the innermost region of the flow will reflect modulations of the massaccretion rate added to the flow at any distance from the black hole. thereforeif primary instabilities operate on the short time scales then the stability ofthe soft component (originating from the geometrically thin and optically thickflow) and variability of the hard component (coming from the geometricallythick and optically thin flow) are naturally explained.

astro-ph;0007092	high frequencies in the power spectrum of cyg x-1 in the hard and soft  spectral states	we analyzed a large number of rxte/pca observations of cyg x-1 in the hardand soft spectral states with total exposure time of ~190 and ~10 ksecrespectively and time resolution better than ~250us in order to investigate itsvariability down to a few milliseconds time scales. the model of modificationsof the power density spectra due to the dead time effect was tested using rxteobservations of an extremely bright source - sco x-1. the results of thesetests demonstrated, that although some problems still remain, for sources likecyg x-1 (which is an order of magnitude less bright than sco x-1) presentknowledge of the instrument is sufficient to reliably analyze the power spectrain the khz frequency range.  in both spectral states of cyg x-1 we detected statistically significantvariability up to ~150-300 hz with a fractional rms amplitude above 100 hz atthe level of ~2-3%. the power spectrum in the hard state shows a steepening atfrequency of ~40-80 hz with the power law slope changing from ~1.7 to ~2.3-2.4.in the soft state the slope of power spectrum changes from ~1 to ~2 at thefrequency of ~15-20 hz without any evidence of further steepening up to\~100-150 hz. these break frequencies represent the highest characteristicfrequencies detected in the power density spectrum of cyg x-1 so far.

astro-ph;0011110	new class of low frequency qpos: signature of nuclear burning or  accretion disk instabilities?	we report the discovery of a new class of low frequency quasi--periodicvariations of the x-ray flux in the x-ray bursters 4u1608-52 and 4u1636-536. wealso report an occasional detection of a similar qpo in aql x-1. the qpos,associated with flux variations at the level of percents, are observed at afrequency of 7-9 mhz. while usually the relative amplitude of flux variationsincreases with energy, the newly discovered qpos are limited to the softestenergies (1-5 kev). the observations of 4u1608-52 suggest that these qpos arepresent only when the source x-ray luminosity is within a rather narrow rangeand they disappear after x-ray bursts. approximately at the same level of thesource luminosity, type i x-ray bursts cease to exist.  judging from this complex of properties, we speculate that a special mode ofnuclear burning at the neutron star surface is responsible for the observedflux variations. alternatively, some instabilities in the accretion disk may beresponsible for these qpos.

astro-ph;0103115	on the x-ray time lags in the black hole candidates	it is shown that the energy dependence of the time lags in cygnus x-1excludes any significant contribution of the standard reflected component tothe observed lags. the conclusion is valid in the 0.1--10 hz frequency rangewhere time lags have been detected with high enough significance. in fact thedata hint that reflected component is working in opposite direction, reducingthe lags at energies where contribution of the reflected component issignificant.  we argue that the observed logarithmic dependence of time lags on energy canbe understood as due to the small variations of the spectrum power law index ina very simple phenomenological model. we assume that an optically thinflow/corona, emitting a power law like spectrum, is present at a range ofdistances from the compact object. the slope of the locally emitted spectrum isa function of distance with the hardest spectrum emitted in the innermostregion. if perturbations with different time scales are introduced to theaccretion flow at different radii the observed x-ray lags naturally appear dueto the inward propagation of perturbations on the diffusion time scales.

astro-ph;0109269	v4641sgr - super-eddington source enshrouded by an extended envelope	an optical spectroscopy of an unusual fast transient v4641 sgr constrains itsmass to 8.7-11.7m_sun (9.6m_sun is the best fit value) and the distance to7.4--12.3 kpc (orosz et al. 2001). at this distance the peak flux of 12 crab inthe 2--12 kev energy band, measured by asm/rxte, implies the x-ray luminosityexceeding 2-3e39 erg/s, i.e. near or above the eddington limit for a 9.6m_sunblack hole. an optical photometry shows that at the peak of the opticaloutburst the visual magnitude increased by delta m_v &gt; 4.7^m relative to thequiescent level and reached m_v &lt; 8.8^m. an assumption that this opticalemission is due to irradiated surface of an accretion disk or a companion starwith the the black body shape of the spectrum would mean that the bolometricluminosity of the system exceeds l&gt;3e41 erg/s &gt; 300 l_edd.  we argue that the optical data strongly suggest presence of an extendedenvelope surrounding the source which absorbs primary x-rays flux and reemitsit in optical and uv. the data also suggests that this envelope should beoptically thin in uv, euv and soft x-rays. the observed properties of v4641 sgrat the peak of an optical flare are very similar to those of ss433. thisenvelope is likely the result of near or super eddington rate of mass accretiononto the black hole and it vanishes during subsequent evolution of the sourcewhen apparent luminosity drops well below the eddington value. thus thistransient source provides us direct proof of the dramatic change in thecharacter of an accretion flow at the mass accretion rate near or above thecritical eddington value as predicted long time ago by the theoretical models.

astro-ph;0204132	super-eddington outburst of v4641 sgr	x-ray transients provide unique opportunity to probe accretion regimes of ata vastly different accretion rates. we analyze a collection of the rxteobservations (galactic center scans, asm monitoring and a pointed observation)of enigmatic transient source high mass x-ray binary v4641 sgr and argue thatthey broadly support the hypothesis that giant september 1999 outburst wasassociated with an episode of super-eddington accretion onto the black hole.during the outburst an extended optically thick envelope/outflow has beenformed around the source making the observational appearance of v4641 sgr inmany aspects very similar to that of ss433. these results suggest that objectslike v4641 sgr and ss433 indeed represent the class of objects accreting matterat a rate comparable or above eddington value and the formation of anenvelope/outflow is a generic characteristic of supercritical accretion.  when the accretion rate decreased the envelope vanished and the source shortterm variability and spectral properties started to resemble those of othergalactic black hole candidates accreting at a rate well below the eddingtonvalue. interestingly that during this phase the source spectrum was verysimilar to the cygnus x-1 spectrum in the low state inspite of more than orderof magnitude larger x-ray luminosity.

astro-ph;0309454	low mass x-ray binaries as a stellar mass indicator for the host galaxy	using results of chandra observations of old stellar systems in eleven nearbygalaxies of various morphological types and the census of lmxbs in the milkyway, we study the population of low mass x-ray binaries and their relation tothe mass of the host galaxy. we show that the azimuthally averaged spatialdistribution of the number of lmxbs and, in the majority of cases, of theircollective luminosity closely follows that of the near-infrared light.considering galaxies as a whole, we find that in a broad mass range,log(m)~9-11.5, the total number of lmxbs and their combined luminosity areproportional to the stellar mass of the host galaxy. within the accuracy of thelight-to-mass conversion, we cannot rule out the possibility of a weakdependence of the x/m ratio on morphological type. however, the effect of sucha dependence, if any, does not exceed a factor of ~1.5-2.  the luminosity distributions of lmxbs observed in different galaxies aresimilar to each other and, with the possible exception of ngc1553, areconsistent with the average luminosity function derived from all data. theaverage xlf of lmxbs in nearby galaxies has a complex shape and issignificantly different from that of hmxbs. it follows a power law with adifferential slope of ~1 at low luminosities, gradually steepens atlog(lx)&gt;37.0-37.5 and has a rather abrupt cut-off at log(lx)~39.0-39.5. thisvalue of the cut-off luminosity is significantly, by an order of magnitude,lower than found for high mass x-ray binaries.

astro-ph;0312445	doppler broadening of the iron line and r-gamma correlation in black  hole binaries	rxte/pca observations of several black hole x-ray binaries in the lowspectral state revealed a tight correlation between spectral parameters andcharacteristic frequencies of variability of x-ray flux. in particular, theamplitude of reflection increases and the slope of comptonized radiationsteepens as the noise frequencies increase. the data also suggest that there isa correlated increase of the width of the fe fluorescent line, probably relatedto the doppler broadening of the reflection features. moreover, the width ofthe line seems to follow deltae/e ~ nu_qpo^{1/3} law. if confirmed with higherenergy resolution observations, this result will have significant impact on themodels of the accretion flow and on our understanding of the nature ofcharacteristic frequencies of variability in x-ray binaries. in particular, itwill lend support to the truncated disk picture, confirming that the spectralvariations are indeed related to changes of the position of the inner diskboundary and that characteristic variability frequencies are proportional tothe keplerian frequency at the inner boundary of the accretion disk.

astro-ph;0312540	statistical properties of the combined emission of a population of  discrete sources: astrophysical implications	we study the statistical properties of the combined emission of a populationof discrete sources (e.g. x-ray emission of a galaxy due to its x-ray binariespopulation). namely, we consider the dependence of their total luminosityl_tot=sum(l_k) and of fractional rms_tot of their variability on the number ofsources n or, equivalently, on the normalization of the luminosity function. weshow that due to small number statistics a regime exists, in which l_tot growsnon-linearly with n, in an apparent contradiction with the seemingly obviousprediction &lt;l_tot&gt;=integral(dn/dl*l*dl) ~ n. in this non-linear regime, therms_tot decreases with n significantly more slowly than expected from the rms ~1/sqrt(n) averaging law. for example, for a power law luminosity function witha slope of a=3/2, in the non-linear regime, l_tot ~ n^2 and the rms_tot doesnot depend at all on the number of sources n. only in the limit of n&gt;&gt;1 dothese quantities behave as intuitively expected, l_tot ~ n and rms_tot ~1/sqrt(n). we give exact solutions and derive convenient analyticalapproximations for l_tot and rms_tot.  using the total x-ray luminosity of a galaxy due to its x-ray binarypopulation as an example, we show that the lx-sfr and lx-m* relations predictedfrom the respective ``universal'' luminosity functions of high and low massx-ray binaries are in a good agreement with observations. although caused bysmall number statistics the non-linear regime in these examples extends as faras sfr&lt;4-5 msun/yr and log(m*/msun)&lt;10.0-10.5, respectively.

astro-ph;0510049	x-ray luminosity function of faint point sources in the milky way	we assess the contribution to the x-ray (above 2 kev) luminosity of the milkyway from different classes of low-mass binary systems and single stars. webegin by using the rxte slew survey of the sky at |b|&gt;10 to construct an x-rayluminosity function (xlf) of nearby x-ray sources in the range10^30&lt;lx(erg/s)&lt;10^34 (where lx is the luminosity over 2-10 kev), occupied bycoronally active binaries (abs) and cataclysmic variables (cvs). we then extendthis xlf down to lx~10^27.5 erg/s using the rosat all-sky survey in soft x-raysand available information on the 0.1-10 kev spectra of typical sources. we findthat the local cumulative x-ray (2-10 kev) emissivities (per unit stellar mass)of abs and cvs are (2.0+/-0.8)x10^27 and (1.1+/-0.3)x10^27 erg/s/msol,respectively. in addition to abs and cvs, representing old stellar populations,young stars emit locally (1.5+/-0.4)x10^27 erg/s/msol. we finally attach to thexlf of abs and cvs a high luminosity branch (up to ~10^39 erg/s) composed ofneutron-star and black-hole low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), derived inprevious work. the combined xlf covers ~12 orders of magnitude in luminosity.the estimated combined contribution of abs and cvs to the 2-10 kev luminosityof the milky way is ~2x10^38 erg/s, or ~3% of the integral luminosity of lmxbs(averaged over nearby galaxies). the xlf obtained in this work is usedelsewhere (revnivtsev et al.) to assess the contribution of point sources tothe galactic ridge x-ray emission.

astro-ph;9901164	compact and diffuse sources in the galactic center region	the 10 by 10 degrees region around dynamic center of our galaxy is known tohost a large number of bright x-ray sources, most of which are low mass binarysystems. while high luminosity z-sources are especially bright in the standardx-ray band (e.g. 2-10 kev), lower luminosity systems are dominating the fluxabove 30 kev. the two hardest sources in the region, i.e. 1e1740.7-2942 and grs1758-258 are thought to be black hole candidates (bhc) based on the similarityof spectral properties and short-term variability to that of dynamically provenbhcs. however, while most of the other galactic bhcs are known to betransients, these two objects could be considered persistent though variablesources. the persistent behavior of these sources implies some constraints onthe parameters of the binary systems. both sources were detected in the firstgranat observation of the gc region. they are the only two persistent bhcs seenin the 35-75 kev sigma image after collecting several million seconds ofexposure time over eight years, indicating that they are perhaps the only twopersistent bhcs in the region.  another peculiar object in the field is of course a putative supermassiveblack hole (sgr a*) at the dynamic center of our galaxy. the present day'sx-ray luminosity from sgr a* is very small ($\la 10^{36}$ erg/s). however anindication that sgr a* might have been much brighter in the past was foundwhile studying diffuse x-ray emission in the region. we speculate here on howfuture x-ray observatories may verify the hypothesis of the violent activity ofsgr a* in the past.

astro-ph;9901392	deep sigma observations of the central square degree of the galaxy	the center of the milky way emits radiation through all the electromagneticspectrum due to the presence of several astrophysical phenomena. variousscientifical questions remain unsolved in the picture that emerge fromobservations, the main one being the presence and activity of a supermassiveblack hole at the galactic center. also in the x-ray band a strong diffuseemission is detected up to 22 kev, it has been suggested that its origin islinked to past high energy activity of the galactic center. the french sigmasoft gamma ray telescope on board the russian granat satellite observed thegalacti center (gc) for abour 9 x 10^6 seconds from 1990 to the end of 1997.its unique imaging capabilities coupled with the unprecedented exposure alreadyallowed us to set preliminary constraints on the persistent high energyemission from sgr a*. here we present a new analysis of the complete set ofobservations of this region taking into account the possible presence ofdiffuse emission in the low energy channels. this allows us both to testcurrent advection models of high energy emission from sgr a* and to investigateon past high energy activity.

astro-ph;9906198	frequency resolved spectroscopy of cyg x-1: fast variability of the fe  k_alpha line	we studied the frequency resolved energy spectra of cyg x--1 during thestandard low (hard) spectral state using the data of the rossi x-ray timingexplorer. we found that the relative amplitude of the reflection features --the iron fluorescent line at ~6.5 kev and the smeared edge above ~7 kev --decreases with the increasing frequency. in particular we found that theequivalent width of the iron line decreases above ~1 hz and drops twice atfrequency of ~10 hz.  an assumption that such behavior is solely due to a finite light crossingtime of the reflecting media, would imply the characteristic size of thereflector ~5e8 cm, corresponding to ~150 rg for a 10msun black hole.alternatively lack of high frequency oscillations of the reflected componentmay indicate that the short time scale, ~50-100 msec, variations of the primarycontinuum appear in geometrically different, likely inner, part of theaccretion flow and give a rise to a significantly weaker, if any, reflectedemission than the longer time scale events.

astro-ph;9910039	the 1-12 hz qpo and dips in grs 1915+105: tracers of keplerian and  viscous time scales?	we analysed 9 rxte/pca observations of grs 1915+105 in the flaring state,when the hardness of the source spectrum was changing on the time scales fromfew seconds up to 1000 seconds. the quasi periodic oscillations (qpos) with thefrequency varying between ~ 1 and 12 hz are associated with the episodes ofharder source spectrum. in each observation we found tight correlation betweenthe duration of the hard episode and the characteristic qpo frequency. for ahalf of the observations this correlation matches the relation between theviscous time scale and the keplerian frequency, when both quantities areevaluated for various radii in the radiation pressure dominated accretion disk.assuming that the qpo frequency is proportional to the keplerian frequency atthe boundary between an optically thick accretion disk and a hot comptonizationregion, the changes of the qpo frequency can then be understood as due tovariations of this boundary position on the viscous time scales.

astro-ph;9910084	reflection and noise in cygnus x-1	we analyzed rxte/pca observations of cyg x-1 from 1996-1998. we found a tightcorrelation between the characteristic noise frequencies (e.g. the breakfrequency nu_br) and the spectral parameters in the low spectral state. theamplitude of reflection increases and the spectrum of primary radiationsteepens as the noise frequency increases (nu_br changes by a factor of ~15 inour sample). this can be understood assuming that increase of the noisefrequency is associated with the shift of the inner boundary of the opticallythick accretion disk towards the compact object. the related increase of thesolid angle, subtended by the disk, and of the influx of the soft photons tothe comptonization region lead to an increase of the amount of reflection andsteepening of the comptonized spectrum. the correlation between the slope ofprimary radiation and the amplitude of reflection extends to the soft spectralstate. a similar correlation between reflection and slope was found for thefrequency resolved spectra in the 0.01-15 hz frequency range. such acorrelation could appear if the longer time scale variations are associatedwith emission originating closer to the optically thick disk and, therefore,having steeper comptonized spectra with larger reflection.
