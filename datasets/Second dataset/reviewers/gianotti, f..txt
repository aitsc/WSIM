0902.2959	first agile catalog of high confidence gamma-ray sources	we present the first catalog of high-confidence gamma-ray sources detected bythe agile satellite during observations performed from july 9, 2007 to june 30,2008. catalogued sources are detected by merging all the available data overthe entire time period. agile, launched in april 2007, is an asi missiondevoted to gamma-ray observations in the 30 mev - 50 gev energy range, withsimultaneous x-ray imaging capability in the 18-60 kev band. this catalog isbased on gamma-ray imaging detector (grid) data for energies greater than 100mev. for the first agile catalog we adopted a conservative analysis, with ahigh-quality event filter optimized to select gamma-ray events within thecentral zone of the instrument field of view (radius of 40 degrees). this is asignificance-limited (4 sigma) catalog, and it is not a complete flux-limitedsample due to the non-uniform first year agile sky coverage. the catalogincludes 47 sources, 21 of which are associated with confirmed or candidatepulsars, 13 with blazars (7 fsrq, 4 bl lacs, 2 unknown type), 2 with hmxrbs, 2with snrs, 1 with a colliding-wind binary system, 8 with unidentified sources.

0908.1908	agile detection of delayed gamma-ray emission from the short gamma-ray  burst grb 090510	short gamma-ray bursts (grbs), typically lasting less than 2 s, are a specialclass of grbs of great interest. we report the detection by the agile satelliteof the short grb 090510 which shows two clearly distinct emission phases: aprompt phase lasting ~ 200 msec and a second phase lasting tens of seconds. theprompt phase is relatively intense in the 0.3-10 mev range with a spectrumcharacterized by a large peak/cutoff energy near 3 mev, in this phase, nosignificant high-energy gamma-ray emission is detected. at the end of theprompt phase, intense gamma-ray emission above 30 mev is detected showing apower-law time decay of the flux of the type t^-1.3 and a broad-band spectrumremarkably different from that of the prompt phase. it extends from sub-mev tohundreds of mev energies with a photon index alpha ~ 1.5. grb 090510 providesthe first case of a short grb with delayed gamma-ray emission. we present thetiming and spectral data of grb 090510 and briefly discuss its remarkableproperties within the current models of gamma-ray emission of short grbs.

0909.3484	agile detection of a rapid gamma-ray flare from the blazar pks 1510-089  during the gasp-webt monitoring	we report the detection by the agile satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flarefrom the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089, during a pointing centered onthe galactic center region from 1 march to 30 march 2008. this source has beencontinuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the glast-agile supportprogram (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). moreover, thegamma-ray flaring episode triggered three too observations by the swiftsatellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 march 2008. in the period1-16 march 2008, agile detected gamma-ray emission from pks 1510-089 at asignificance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 mev.after a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 march 2008, agiledetected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux(e &gt; 100 mev) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak levelof (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. duringthe observing period january-april 2008, the source also showed an intense andvariable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significantincrease of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. moreover, in thex-ray band the swift/xrt observations seem to show an harder-when-brighterbehaviour of the source spectrum. the spectral energy distribution of mid-march2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton emissionplus contributions from inverse compton scattering of external photons fromboth the accretion disc and the broad line region. indeed, some features in theoptical-uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert-like components,such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

0910.4883	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3 ii. the agile 2007 december  campaign	we report on the second agile multiwavelength campaign of the blazar 3c 454.3during the first half of december 2007. this campaign involved agile, spitzer,swift,suzaku,the webt consortium,the rem and mitsume telescopes,offering abroad band coverage that allowed for a simultaneous sampling of the synchrotronand inverse compton (ic) emissions.the 2-week agile monitoring was accompaniedby radio to optical monitoring by webt and rem and by sparse observations inmid-infrared and soft/hard x-ray energy bands performed by means of target ofopportunity observations by spitzer, swift and suzaku, respectively.the sourcewas detected with an average flux of~250x10^{-8}ph cm^-2s^-1 above 100mev,typical of its flaring states.the simultaneous optical and gamma-raymonitoring allowed us to study the time-lag associated with the variability inthe two energy bands, resulting in a possible ~1-day delay of the gamma-rayemission with respect to the optical one. from the simultaneous optical andgamma-ray fast flare detected on december 12, we can constrain the delaybetween the gamma-ray and optical emissions within 12 hours. moreover, weobtain three spectral energy distributions (seds) with simultaneous data for2007 december 5, 13, 15, characterized by the widest multifrequency coverage.we found that a model with an external compton on seed photons by a standarddisk and reprocessed by the broad line regions does not describe in asatisfactory way the seds of 2007 december 5, 13 and 15. an additionalcontribution, possibly from the hot corona with t=10^6 k surrounding the jet,is required to account simultaneously for the softness of the synchrotron andthe hardness of the inverse compton emissions during those epochs.

0910.5344	discovery of extreme particle acceleration in the microquasar cygnus x-3	the study of relativistic particle acceleration is a major topic ofhigh-energy astrophysics. it is well known that massive black holes in activegalaxies can release a substantial fraction of their accretion power intoenergetic particles, producing gamma-rays and relativistic jets. galacticmicroquasars (hosting a compact star of 1-10 solar masses which accretes matterfrom a binary companion) also produce relativistic jets. however, no directevidence of particle acceleration above gev energies has ever been obtained inmicroquasar ejections, leaving open the issue of the occurrence and timing ofextreme matter energization during jet formation. here we report the detectionof transient gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from the microquasar cygnus x-3,an exceptional x-ray binary which sporadically produces powerful radio jets.four gamma-ray flares (each lasting 1-2 days) were detected by the agilesatellite simultaneously with special spectral states of cygnus x-3 during theperiod mid-2007/mid-2009. our observations show that very efficient particleacceleration and gamma-ray propagation out of the inner disk of a microquasarusually occur a few days before major relativistic jet ejections. flaringparticle energies can be thousands of times larger than previously detectedmaximum values (with lorentz factors of 105 and 102 for electrons and protons,respectively). we show that the transitional nature of gamma-ray flares andparticle acceleration above gev energies in cygnus x-3 is clearly linked tospecial radio/x-ray states preceding strong radio flares. thus gamma-raysprovide unique insight into the nature of physical processes in microquasars.

1001.5150	direct evidence for hadronic cosmic-ray acceleration in the supernova  renmant ic 443	the supernova remnant (snr) ic 443 is an intermediate-age remnant well knownfor its radio, optical, x-ray and gamma-ray energy emissions. in this letter westudy the gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from ic 443 as obtained by the agilesatellite. a distinct pattern of diffuse emission in the energy range 100 mev-3gev is detected across the snr with its prominent maximum (source "a")localized in the northeastern shell with a flux f = (47 \pm 10) 10^{-8} photonscm^{-2} s^{-1} above 100 mev. this location is the site of the strongest shockinteraction between the snr blast wave and the dense circumstellar medium.source "a" is not coincident with the tev source located 0.4 degree away andassociated with a dense molecular cloud complex in the snr central region. fromour observations, and from the lack of detectable diffuse tev emission from itsnortheastern rim, we demonstrate that electrons cannot be the main emitters ofgamma-rays in the range 0.1-10 gev at the site of the strongest snr shock. theintensity, spectral characteristics, and location of the most prominentgamma-ray emission together with the absence of co-spatial detectable tevemission are consistent only with a hadronic model of cosmic-ray accelerationin the snr. a high-density molecular cloud (cloud "e") provides a remarkable"target" for nucleonic interactions of accelerated hadrons: our results showenhanced gamma-ray production near the molecular cloud/shocked shellinteraction site. ic 443 provides the first unambiguous evidence of cosmic-rayacceleration by snrs.

1005.0784	agile detection of gev gamma-ray emission from the snr w28	supernova remnants (snrs) are believed to be the main sources of galacticcosmic rays. molecular clouds associated with snrs can produce gamma-rayemission through the interaction of accelerated particles with the concentratedgas. the middle aged snr w28, for its associated system of dense molecularclouds, provides an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis. we presentthe agile/grid observations of snr w28, and compare them with observations atother wavelengths (tev and 12co j=1--&gt;0 molecular line emission). the gamma-rayflux detected by agile from the dominant source associated with w28 is (14 +-5) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for e &gt; 400 mev. this source is positionally wellcorrelated with the tev emission observed by the hess telescope. the localvariations of the gev to tev flux ratio suggest a difference between the crspectra of the north-west and south molecular cloud complexes. a model based ona hadronic-induced interaction and diffusion with two molecular clouds atdifferent distances from the w28 shell can explain both the morphological andspectral features observed by agile in the mev-gev energy range and by the hesstelescope in the tev energy range. the combined set of agile and h.e.s.s. datastrongly support a hadronic model for the gamma-ray production in w28.

1110.4758	the first grb survey of the ibis/picsit archive	the multi-purpose integral mission is continuously contributing to gamma rayburst (grb) science, thanks to the performances of its two main instruments,ibis and spi, operating in the hard x-ray/soft gamma-ray domain. we investigatethe possibilities offered to the study of grbs by picsit, the high-energydetector of the ibis instrument. we searched for transient episodes in thepicsit light curves archive from may 2006 to august 2009, using stringentcriteria optimized for the detection of long events. in the time interval underexamination picsit provides an energy coverage from 208 to 2600 kev, resolvedin eight energy channels, combined with a fine time resolution of 16 ms. picsitsuccessfully observes grbs in the 260-2600 kev energy range with an incomingdirection spread over half the sky for the brightest events. we compiled a listof 39 bursts, most of which are confirmed grbs or simultaneous to triggers fromother satellites/instruments. we produced light curves with a time samplingdown to 0.25 s in three energy intervals for all events. because an adequateresponse matrix is not yet available for the picsit burst sample, we obtained acalibration coefficient in three selected energy bands by comparinginstrumental counts with physical fluences inferred from observations withdifferent satellites. the good time resolution provided by the picsit dataallows a spectral variability study of our sample through the hardness ratio.

1111.4868	neutral pion emission from accelerated protons in the supernova remnant  w44	we present the agile gamma-ray observations in the energy range 50 mev - 10gev of the supernova remnant (snr) w44, one of the most interesting systems forstudying cosmic-ray production. w44 is an intermediate-age snr (20, 000 years)and its ejecta expand in a dense medium as shown by a prominent radio shell,nearby molecular clouds, and bright [sii] emitting regions. we extend ourgamma-ray analysis to energies substantially lower than previous measurementswhich could not conclusively establish the nature of the radiation. we findthat gamma-ray emission matches remarkably well both the position and shape ofthe inner snr shocked plasma. furthermore, the gamma-ray spectrum shows aprominent peak near 1 gev with a clear decrement at energies below a fewhundreds of mev as expected from neutral pion decay. here we demonstrate that:(1) hadron-dominated models are consistent with all w44 multiwavelengthconstraints derived from radio, optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray observations; (2)ad hoc lepton-dominated models fail to explain simultaneously thewell-constrained gamma-ray and radio spectra, and require a circumstellardensity much larger than the value derived from observations; (3) the hadronenergy spectrum is well described by a power-law (with index s = 3.0 \pm 0.1)and a low-energy cut-off at ec = 6 \pm 1 gev. direct evidence for pion emissionis then established in an snr for the first time.

1111.4960	agile detection of cygnus x-3 {\gamma}-ray active states during the  period mid-2009/mid-2010	cygnus x-3 (cyg x-3) is a well-known microquasar producing variable emissionat all wavelengths. cyg x-3 is a prominent x-ray binary producing relativisticjets, and studying its high energy emission is crucial for the understanding ofthe fundamental acceleration processes in accreting compact objects. aims. ourgoal is to study extreme particle acceleration and {\gamma}-ray productionabove 100 mev during special spectral states of cyg x- 3 usually characterizedby a low hard x-ray flux and enhanced soft x-ray states. we observed cyg x-3with the agile satellite in extended time intervals from 2009 jun.-jul., and2009 nov.-2010 jul. we report here the results of the agile {\gamma}-raymonitoring of cyg x-3 as well as the results from extensive multiwavelengthcampaigns involving radio (ratan-600, ami-la and mets\"{a}hovi radioobservatories) and x-ray monitoring data (xte and swift). we detect a series ofrepeated {\gamma}-ray flaring activity from cyg x-3 that correlate with thesoft x-ray states and episodes of decreasing or non-detectable hard x-rayemission. furthermore, we detect {\gamma}-ray enhanced emission that tends tobe associated with radio flares greater than 1 jy at 15 ghz, confirming a trendalready detected in previous observations. the source remained active above 100mev for an extended period of time (almost 1.5 months in 2009 jun.-jul. and 1month in 2010 may). we study in detail the short timescale {\gamma}-ray flaresthat occurred before or near the radio peaks. our results confirm the transientnature of the extreme particle acceleration from the microquasar cyg x-3. aseries of repeated {\gamma}-ray flares shows correlations with radio and x-rayemission confirming a well established trend of emission. we compare ourresults with fermi-lat and magic tev observations of cyg x-3.

0808.4053	agile detection of variable gamma-ray activity from the blazar s5  0716+714 in september-october 2007	we report the gamma-ray activity from the intermediate bl lac s5 0716+714during observations acquired by the agile satellite in september and october2007. these detections of activity were contemporaneous with a period ofintense optical activity, which was monitored by gasp-webt. this simultaneousoptical and gamma-ray coverage allows us to study in detail the light curves,time lags, gamma-ray photon spectrum, and spectral energy distributions (seds)during different states of activity. agile observed the source with its twoco-aligned imagers, the gamma-ray imaging detector (grid) and the hard x-rayimager (super-agile), which are sensitive to the 30 mev-50 gev and 18-60 kevenergy ranges, respectively. observations were completed in two differentperiods, the first between 2007 september 4-23, and the second between 2007october 24-november 1. over the period 2007 september 7-12, agile detectedgamma-ray emission from the source at a significance level of 9.6-sigma with anaverage flux (e&gt;100 mev) of (97 +/- 15) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}, whichincreased by a factor of at least four within three days. no emission wasdetected by super-agile for the energy range 18-60 kev to a 3-sigma upper limitof 10 mcrab in 335 ksec. in october 2007, agile repointed toward s5 0716+714following an intense optical flare, measuring an average flux of (47 +/- 11) x10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} at a significance level of 6.0-sigma. thegamma-ray flux of s5 0716+714 detected by agile is the highest ever detectedfor this blazar and one of the most intense gamma-ray fluxes detected from a bllac object. the sed of mid-september appears to be consistent with thesynchrotron self-compton (ssc) emission model, but only by including two ssccomponents of different variabilities.

astro-ph;0507660	the integral/ibis source axj1838.0-0655: a soft x-ray to tev gamma-ray  broad band emitter	we report on integral observations of ax j1838.0-0655, one of theunidentified objects listed in the first ibis/isgri survey catalogue andlocated in the scutum arm region. this object, detected in the 20-300 kev bandat a confidence level of 15.3 sigma (9 x 10^-11 erg cm-2 s-1) is the likelycounterpart of the still unidentified tev source hess j1837-069. it has beendetected in the past by various x-ray telescopes, including asca, implying thatit is a persistent rather than a transient source; the asca image is compatiblewith the source not being resolved. the broad 1-300 kev spectrum ischaracterized by an absorbed (nh = 6.7+/-1.3 x 10^22 cm-2) and hard (gamma =1.5+/- 0.2) power law continuum. possible counterparts (radio and infrared)present within the x-ray error box are discussed, even if no clear associationcan be identified. the broad band spectrum together with the tev detectionsuggests that ax j1838.0-0655 maybe a supernova remnant or a pulsar windnebula, which has so far eluded detection in the radio band. this is the secondunidentified hess source that shows a substantial soft gamma-ray emission.

astro-ph;0509584	x-ray spectral survey with xmm--newton of a complete sample of nearby  seyfert galaxies	results obtained from an x-ray spectral survey of nearby seyfert galaxiesusing xmm--newton are reported. the sample was optically selected, welldefined, complete in b mag, and distance limited: it consists of the nearest(d&lt;22 mpc) 27 seyfert galaxies (9 of type 1, 18 of type 2) taken from the ho etal. (1997) sample. this is one of the largest atlases of hard x-ray spectra oflow-l active galaxies ever assembled. all nuclear sources except two sey 2s aredetected between 2-10 kev, half for the first time ever, and average spectraare obtained for all of them. nuclear luminosities reach values down to 10**38erg/s. the shape of the distribution of x-ray parameters is affected by thepresence of compton-thick objects (&gt; 30% among type 2s). the latter have beenidentified either directly from their intense fek line and flat x-ray spectra,or indirectly with flux diagnostic diagrams which use isotropic indicators.after taking into account these highly absorbed sources, we find that (i) theintrinsic x-ray spectral properties (i.e., spectral shapes and luminositiesabove 2 kev) are consistent between type 1 and type 2 sey, as expected from``unified models'', (ii) sey galaxies as a whole are distributed fairlycontinuously over the entire range of nh, between 10**20 and 10**25 cm**-2, and(iii) while sey 1s tend to have lower nh and sey 2s tend to have the highest,we find 30% and 10% exceptions, respectively. overall the sample wellrepresents the average intrinsic x-ray spectral properties of nearby agn,including a proper estimate of the distribution of their absorbing columns.finally, we conclude that, with the exception of a few cases, the present studyagrees with predictions of unified models of sey galaxies, and extends theirvalidity down to very low luminosities.

0809.1230	agile detection of delayed gamma-ray emission from grb 080514b	grb 080514b is the first gamma ray burst (grb), since the time of egret, forwhich individual photons of energy above several tens of mev have been detectedwith a pair-conversion tracker telescope. this burst was discovered with theitalian agile gamma-ray satellite. the grb was localized with a cooperation byagile and the interplanetary network (ipn). the gamma-ray imager (grid)estimate of the position, obtained before the superagile-ipn localization, isfound to be consistent with the burst position. the hard x-ray emissionobserved by superagile lasted about 7 s, while there is evidence that theemission above 30 mev extends for a longer duration (at least ~13 s). similarbehavior was seen in the past from a few other grbs observed with egret.however, the latter measurements were affected, during the brightest phases, byinstrumental dead time effects, resulting in only lower limits to the burstintensity. thanks to the small dead time of the agile/grid we could assess thatin the case of grb 080514b the gamma-ray to x-ray flux ratio changessignificantly between the prompt and extended emission phase.

0809.1737	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3. i. the agile 2007 november  campaign on the "crazy diamond"	[abridged] we report on a multiwavelength observation of the blazar 3c 454.3(which we dubbed "crazy diamond") carried out on november 2007 by means of theastrophysical satellites agile, integral, swift, the webt consortium, and theoptical-nir telescope rem. 3c 454.3 is detected at a $\sim 19-\sigma$ levelduring the 3-week observing period, with an average flux above 100 mev of$f_{\rm e&gt;100mev} = (170 \pm 13) \times 10^{-8}$ \phcmsec. the gamma-rayspectrum can be fit with a single power-law with photon index $\gamma_{\rmgrid} = 1.73 \pm 0.16$ between 100 mev and 1 gev. we detect significantday-by-day variability of the gamma-ray emission during our observations, andwe can exclude that the fluxes are constant at the 99.6% ($\sim 2.9 \sigma$)level. the source was detected typically around 40 degrees off-axis, and it wassubstantially off--axis in the field of view of the agile hard x-ray imager.however, a 5-day long too observation by integral detected 3c 454.3 at anaverage flux of about $f_{\rm 20-200 kev} = 1.49 \times 10^{-3}$ \phcmsec withan average photon index of $\gamma_{\rm ibis} = 1.75 \pm 0.24$ between 20--200kev. swift also detected 3c 454.3 with a flux in the 0.3--10 kev energy band inthe range $(1.23-1.40) \times 10^{-2}$ \phcmsec{} and a photon index in therange $\gamma_{\rm xrt} = 1.56-1.73$. in the optical band, both webt and remshow an extremely variable behavior in the $r$ band. a correlation analysisbased on the entire data set is consistent with no time-lags between thegamma-ray and the optical flux variations. our simultaneous multifrequencyobservations strongly indicate that the dominant emission mechanism between 30mev and 30 gev is dominated by inverse compton scattering of relativisticelectrons in the jet on the external photons from the broad line region.

0809.3917	gamma-ray burst detection with the agile mini-calorimeter	the mini-calorimeter (mcal) instrument on-board the agile satellite is anon-imaging gamma-ray scintillation detector sensitive in the 300kev-100mevenergy range with a total on-axis geometrical area of 1400cm^2. gamma-raybursts (grbs) are one of the main scientific targets of the agile mission andthe mcal design as an independent self-triggering detector makes it a valuableall-sky monitor for grbs. furthermore mcal is one of the very few operativeinstruments with microsecond timing capabilities in the mev range. in thispaper the results of grb detections with mcal after one year of operation inspace are presented and discussed. a flexible trigger logic implemented in theagile payload data-handling unit allows the on-board detection of grbs. fortriggered events, energy and timing information are sent to telemetry on aphoton-by-photon basis, so that energy and time binning are limited by countingstatistics only. when the trigger logic is not active, grbs can be detectedoffline in ratemeter data, although with worse energy and time resolution.between the end of june 2007 and june 2008 mcal detected 51 grbs, with adetection rate of about 1 grb/week, plus several other events at a fewmilliseconds timescales. since february 2008 the on-board trigger logic hasbeen fully active. comparison of mcal detected events and data provided byother space instruments confirms the sensitivity and effective areaestimations. mcal also joined the 3rd inter-planetary network, to contribute togrb localization by means of triangulation.

0810.1516	high-resolution timing observations of spin-powered pulsars with the  agile gamma-ray telescope	agile is a small gamma-ray astronomy satellite mission of the italian spaceagency dedicated to high-energy astrophysics launched in 2007 april. its 1microsecond absolute time tagging capability coupled with a good sensitivity inthe 30 mev-30 gev range, with simultaneous x-ray monitoring in the 18-60 kevband, makes it perfectly suited for the study of gamma-ray pulsars following upon the cgro/egret heritage. in this paper we present the first agile timingresults on the known gamma-ray pulsars vela, crab, geminga and b 1706-44. thedata were collected from 2007 july to 2008 april, exploiting the missionscience verification phase, the instrument timing calibration and the earlyobserving pointing program. thanks to its large field of view, agile collecteda large number of gamma-ray photons from these pulsars (about 10,000 pulsedcounts for vela) in only few months of observations. the coupling of agiletiming capabilities, simultaneous radio/x-ray monitoring and new tools aimed atprecise photon phasing, exploiting also timing noise correction, unveiled newinteresting features at sub-millisecond level in the pulsars' high-energylight-curves.

0811.0593	high energy variability of 3c 273 during the agile multiwavelength  campaign of december 2007 - january 2008	we report the results of a 3-weeks multi-wavelength campaign on the flatspectrum radio quasar 3c 273 carried out with the agile gamma-ray mission,covering the 30 mev -50 gev and 18-60 kev, the rem observatory (covering thenear-ir and optical), swift (near-uv/optical, 0.2-10 kev and 15-50 kev),integral (3 - 200 kev) and rossi xte (2-12 kev). this is the firstobservational campaign including gamma-ray data, after the last egretobservations, more than 8 years ago. our study was carried out usingsimultaneous light curves of the source flux from all the involved instruments,in the different energy ranges, in search for correlated variability. then atime-resolved sed was used for a detailed physical modelling of the emissionmechanisms. the source was detected in gamma-rays only in the second week ofour campaign. we found indication of a possible anti-correlation between theemission at gamma-rays and at soft and hard x-rays, supported by the completeset of instruments. instead, optical data do not show short term variability.only in two egret observations (in 1993 and 1997) 3c 273 showedintra-observation variability in gamma-rays. the sed with almost simultaneousdata, partially covers the regions of the synchrotron emission, the big bluebump, and the inverse-compton. the soft x-ray emission is consistent withcombined ssc and ec mechanisms, while hard x and gamma-ray emissions arecompatible with ec from thermal photons of the disk. the time evolution of thesed is well interpreted and modelled in terms of an acceleration episode of theelectrons population, leading to a shift in the ic peak towards higherenergies.

hep-ph;0306219	updated post-wmap benchmarks for supersymmetry	we update a previously-proposed set of supersymmetric benchmark scenarios,taking into account the precise constraints on the cold dark matter densityobtained by combining wmap and other cosmological data, as well as the lep andb -&gt; s gamma constraints. we assume that r parity is conserved and work withinthe constrained mssm (cmssm) with universal soft supersymmetry-breaking scalarand gaugino masses m_0 and m_1/2. in most cases, the relic density calculatedfor the previous benchmarks may be brought within the wmap range by reducingslightly m_0, but in two cases more substantial changes in m_0 and m_1/2 aremade. since the wmap constraint reduces the effective dimensionality of thecmssm parameter space, one may study phenomenology along `wmap lines' in the(m_1/2, m_0) plane that have acceptable amounts of dark matter. we discuss theproduction, decays and detectability of sparticles along these lines, at thelhc and at linear e+ e- colliders in the sub- and multi-tev ranges, stressingthe complementarity of hadron and lepton colliders, and with particularemphasis on the neutralino sector. finally, we preview the accuracy with whichone might be able to predict the density of supersymmetric cold dark matterusing collider measurements.

hep-ph;0508198	supersymmetric benchmarks with non-universal scalar masses or gravitino  dark matter	we propose and examine a new set of benchmark supersymmetric scenarios, someof which have non-universal higgs scalar masses (nuhm) and others havegravitino dark matter (gdm). the scalar masses in these models are eitherconsiderably larger or smaller than the narrow range allowed for the samegaugino mass m_{1/2} in the constrained mssm (cmssm) with universal scalarmasses m_0 and neutralino dark matter. the nuhm and gdm models with larger m_0may have large branching ratios for higgs and/or $z$ production in the cascadedecays of heavier sparticles, whose detection we discuss. the phenomenology ofthe gdm models depends on the nature of the next-to-lightest supersymmetricparticle (nlsp), which has a lifetime exceeding 10^4 seconds in the proposedbenchmark scenarios. in one gdm scenario the nlsp is the lightest neutralino\chi, and the supersymmetric collider signatures are similar to those inprevious cmssm benchmarks, but with a distinctive spectrum. in the other gdmscenarios based on minimal supergravity (msugra), the nlsp is the lighter stauslepton {\tilde \tau}_1, with a lifetime between ~ 10^4 and 3 x 10^6 seconds.every supersymmetric cascade would end in a {\tilde \tau}_1, which would have adistinctive time-of-flight signature. slow-moving {\tilde \tau}_1's might betrapped in a collider detector or outside it, and the preferred detectionstrategy would depend on the {\tilde \tau}_1 lifetime. we discuss the extent towhich these msugra gdm scenarios could be distinguished from gauge-mediatedmodels.
