math;0005066	banach space representations and iwasawa theory	the lack of a $p$-adic haar measure causes many methods of traditionalrepresentation theory to break down when applied to continuous representationsof a compact $p$-adic lie group $g$ in banach spaces over a given $p$-adicfield $k$. for example, diarra showed that the abelian group $g=\dz$ has anenormous wealth of infinite dimensional, topologically irreducible banach spacerepresentations.  we therefore address the problem of finding an additional ''finiteness''condition on such representations that will lead to a reasonable theory. weintroduce such a condition that we call ''admissibility''. we show that thecategory of all admissible $g$-representations is reasonable -- in fact, it isabelian and of a purely algebraic nature -- by showing that it isanti-equivalent to the category of all finitely generated modules over acertain kind of completed group ring $k[[g]]$.  as an application of our methods we determine the topological irreducibilityas well as the intertwining maps for representations of $gl_2(\dz)$ obtained byinduction of a continuous character from the subgroup of lower triangularmatrices.

math;0005072	u(g)-finite locally analytic representations	in this paper we continue the study of locally analytic representations of a$p$-adic lie group $g$ in vector spaces over a spherically completenon-archimedean field $k$, building on the algebraic approach to suchrepresentations introduced in our paper "locally analytic distributions andp-adic representation theory, with applications to gl_2." in that paper weassociated to a representation $v$ a module $m$ over the ring $d(g,k)$ oflocally analytic distributions on $g$ and described an admissibility conditionon $v$ in terms of algebraic properties of $m$.  in this paper we determine the relationship between our admissibilitycondition on locally analytic modules and the traditional admissibility oflanglands theory. we then analyze the class of locally analytic representationswith the property that their associated modules are annihilated by an ideal offinite codimension in the universal enveloping algebra of g, showing under somehypotheses on g that they are sums of representations of the form $x\otimes y$,with x finite dimensional and y smooth. the irreducible representations of thistype are obtained when x and y are irreducible.  we conclude by analyzing the reducible members of the locally analyticprincipal series of $sl_2(\qp)$.

math;0102012	p-adic fourier theory	in this paper we generalize work of amice and lazard from the early(nineteen) sixties. amice determined the dual of the space of locallyqp-analytic functions on zp and showed that it is isomorphic to the ring ofrigid functions on the open unit disk over cp. lazard showed that this ring hasa divisor theory and that the classes of closed, finitely generated, andprincipal ideals in this ring coincide.  we study the space of locally l-analytic functions on the ring of integers inl, where l is a finite extension of qp. we show that the dual of this space isa ring isomorphic to the ring of rigid functions on a certain rigid variety x.we show that the variety x is isomorphic to the open unit disk over cp, but notover any discretely valued extension field of l; it is a "twisted form" of theopen unit disk. in the ring of functions on x, the classes of closed, finitelygenerated, and invertible ideals coincide, but unless l=qp not all finitelygenerated ideals are principal.  the paper uses lubin-tate theory and results on p-adic hodge theory. we giveseveral applications, including one to the construction of p-adic l-functionsfor supersingular elliptic curves.

math;0206056	algebras of p-adic distributions and admissible representations	let g be a compact, locally l-analytic group, where l is a finite extensionof qp. let k be a discretely valued extension field of l. we study the algebrad(g,k) of k-valued locally analytic distributions on g, and apply our resultsto the locally analytic representation theory of g in vector spaces over k. ourobjective is to lay a useful and powerful foundation for the further study ofsuch representations.  we show that the noncommutative, nonnoetherian ring d(g,k) "behaves" like thering of functions on a rigid stein space, and that (at least when g isqp-analytic) it is a faithfully flat extension of its subring k\otimes zp[[g]],where zp[[g]] is the completed group ring of g. we use this point of view todescribe an abelian subcategory of d(g,k) modules that we call coadmissible.  we say that a locally analytic representation v of g is admissible if itsstrong dual is coadmissible as d(g,k)-module. for noncompact g, we say v isadmissible if its strong dual is coadmissible as d(h,k) module for some compactopen subgroup h. in this way we obtain an abelian category of admissiblelocally analytic representations. these methods allow us to answer a number ofquestions raised in our earlier papers on p-adic representations; for examplewe show the existence of analytic vectors in the admissible banach spacerepresentations of g that we studied in "banach space representations ...",israel j. math. 127, 359-380 (2002).  finally we construct a dimension theory for d(g,k), which behaves forcoadmissible modules like a regular ring, and show that smooth admissiblerepresentations are zero dimensional.

0905.0577	constrained correlation functions	we show that correlation functions have to satisfy contraint relations, owingto the non-negativity of the power spectrum of the underlying random process.specifically, for any statistically homogeneous and (for more than one spatialdimension) isotropic random field with correlation function $\xi(x)$, we deriveinequalities for the correlation coefficients $r_n\equiv \xi(n x)/\xi(0)$ (forinteger $n$) of the form $r_{n{\rm l}}\le r_n\le r_{n{\rm u}}$, where the lowerand upper bounds on $r_n$ depend on the $r_j$, with $j&lt;n$. explicit expressionsfor the bounds are obtained for arbitrary $n$. these constraint equations verysignificantly limit the set of possible correlation functions. for oneparticular example of a fiducial cosmic shear survey, we show that the gaussianlikelihood ellipsoid has a significant spill-over into the forbidden region ofcorrelation functions, rendering the resulting best-fitting model parametersand their error region questionable, and indicating the need for a betterdescription of the likelihood function.  we conduct some simple numerical experiments which explicitly demonstrate thefailure of a gaussian description for the likelihood of $\xi$. instead, theshape of the likelihood function of the correlation coefficients appears tofollow approximately that of the shape of the bounds on the $r_n$, even if thegaussian ellipsoid lies well within the allowed region.  for more than one spatial dimension of the random field, the explicitexpressions of the bounds on the $r_n$ are not optimal. we outline ageometrical method how tighter bounds may be obtained in principle. weillustrate this method for a few simple cases; a more general treatment awaitsfuture work.

1002.2136	cosebis: extracting the full e-/b-mode information from cosmic shear  correlation functions	cosmic shear is considered one of the most powerful methods for studying theproperties of dark energy in the universe. as a standard method, the two-pointcorrelation functions $xi_\pm(theta)$ of the cosmic shear field are used asstatistical measures for the shear field. in order to separate the observedshear into e- and b-modes, the latter being most likely produced by remainingsystematics in the data set and/or intrinsic alignment effects, severalstatistics have been defined before. here we aim at a complete e-/b-modedecomposition of the cosmic shear information contained in the $xi_\pm$ on afinite angular interval. we construct two sets of such e-/b-mode measures,namely complete orthogonal sets of e-/b-mode integrals (cosebis), characterizedby weight functions between the $xi_\pm$ and the cosebis which are polynomialsin $theta$ or polynomials in $ln(theta)$, respectively. considering thelikelihood in cosmological parameter space, constructed from the cosebis, westudy their information contents. we show that the information grows with thenumber of cosebi modes taken into account, and that an asymptotic limit isreached which defines the maximum available information in the e-mode componentof the $xi_\pm$. we show that this limit is reached the earlier (i.e., for asmaller number of modes considered) the narrower the angular range is overwhich $xi_\pm$ are measured, and it is reached much earlier for logarithmicweight functions. for example, for $xi_\pm$ on the interval $1'\le \theta\le400'$, the asymptotic limit for the parameter pair $(omega_m, sigma_8)$ isreached for $\sim 25$ modes in the linear case, but already for 5 modes in thelogarithmic case. the cosebis form a natural discrete set of quantities, whichwe suggest as method of choice in future cosmic shear likelihood analyses.

1010.0010	a bias in cosmic shear from galaxy selection: results from ray-tracing  simulations	we identify and study a previously unknown systematic effect on cosmic shearmeasurements, caused by the selection of galaxies used for shape measurement,in particular the rejection of close (blended) galaxy pairs. we use ray-tracingsimulations based on the millennium simulation and a semi-analytical model ofgalaxy formation to create realistic galaxy catalogues. from these, we quantifythe bias in the shear correlation functions by comparing measurements made fromgalaxy catalogues with and without removal of close pairs. a likelihoodanalysis is used to quantify the resulting shift in estimates of cosmologicalparameters. the filtering of objects with close neighbours (a) changes theredshift distribution of the galaxies used for correlation functionmeasurements, and (b) correlates the number density of sources in thebackground with the density field in the foreground. this leads to ascale-dependent bias of the correlation function of several percent,translating into biases of cosmological parameters of similar amplitude. thismakes this new systematic effect potentially harmful for upcoming and plannedcosmic shear surveys. as a remedy, we propose and test a weighting scheme thatcan significantly reduce the bias.

0709.1003	weak lensing goes bananas: what flexion really measures	in weak gravitational lensing, the image distortion caused by shear measuresthe projected tidal gravitational field of the deflecting mass distribution. tolowest order, the shear is proportional to the mean image ellipticity. if theimage sizes are not small compared to the scale over which the shear varies,higher-order distortions occur, called flexion. for ordinary weak lensing, theobservable quantity is not the shear, but the reduced shear, owing to themass-sheet degeneracy. likewise, the flexion itself is unobservable. rather,higher-order image distortions measure the reduced flexion, i.e., derivativesof the reduced shear. we derive the corresponding lens equation in terms of thereduced flexion and calculate the resulting relation between brightness momentsof source and image. assuming an isotropic distribution of source orientations,estimates for the reduced shear and flexion are obtained; these are then testedwith simulations. in particular, the presence of flexion affects thedetermination of the reduced shear. the results of these simulations yield theamount of bias of the estimators, as a function of the shear and flexion. wepoint out and quantify a fundamental limitation of the flexion formalism, interms of the product of reduced flexion and source size. if this productincreases above the derived threshold, multiple images of the source are formedlocally, and the formalism breaks down. finally, we show how a general(reduced) flexion field can be decomposed into its four components: two of themare due to a shear field, carrying an e- and b-mode in general. the other twocomponents do not correspond to a shear field; they can also be split up intocorresponding e- and b-modes.

1105.3672	constrained probability distributions of correlation functions	context: two-point correlation functions are used throughout cosmology as ameasure for the statistics of random fields. when used in bayesian parameterestimation, their likelihood function is usually replaced by a gaussianapproximation. however, this has been shown to be insufficient.  aims: for the case of gaussian random fields, we search for an exactprobability distribution of correlation functions, which could improve theaccuracy of future data analyses.  methods: we use a fully analytic approach, first expanding the random fieldin its fourier modes, and then calculating the characteristic function.finally, we derive the probability distribution function using integration byresidues. we use a numerical implementation of the full analytic formula todiscuss the behaviour of this function.  results: we derive the univariate and bivariate probability distributionfunction of the correlation functions of a gaussian random field, and outlinehow higher joint distributions could be calculated. we give the results in theform of mode expansions, but in one special case we also find a closed-formexpression. we calculate the moments of the distribution and, in the univariatecase, we discuss the edgeworth expansion approximation. we also comment on thedifficulties in a fast and exact numerical implementation of our results, andon possible future applications.

1105.3980	cosmic shear covariance: the log-normal approximation	[abridged] we seek approximations to the cosmic shear covariance that are aseasy to use as the common approximations based on normal statistics, but yieldmore accurate covariance matrices and parameter errors. we derive expressionsfor the cosmic shear covariance under the assumption that the underlyingconvergence field follows log-normal statistics. we also derive a simplifiedversion of this log-normal approximation. we use numerical simulations of weaklensing to study how well the normal, log-normal, and simplified log-normalapproximations as well as empirical corrections to the normal approximationproposed in the literature reproduce shear covariances for cosmic shearsurveys. we find that the normal approximation substantially underestimates thecosmic shear covariances and the inferred parameter confidence regions, inparticular for surveys with small fields of view and large galaxy densities,but also for very wide surveys. in contrast, the log-normal approximationyields more realistic covariances and confidence regions, but also requiresevaluating slightly more complicated expressions. however, the simplifiedlog-normal approximation, although as simple as the normal approximation,yields confidence regions that are almost as accurate as those obtained fromthe log-normal approximation. the empirical corrections to the normalapproximation do not yield more accurate covariances and confidence regionsthan the (simplified) log-normal approximation. moreover, they fail to producepositive-semidefinite data covariance matrices in certain cases, rendering themunusable for parameter estimation. the simplified log-normal approximationshould be used in favour of the normal approximation for parameter estimationand parameter error forecasts. any approximation to the cosmic shear covarianceshould ensure a positive-semidefinite data covariance matrix.

1108.3678	xmm-newton/sdss: star formation efficiency in galaxy clusters and  constraints on the matter density parameter	it is believed that the global baryon content of clusters of galaxies isrepresentative of the matter distribution of the universe, and can, therefore,be used to reliably determine the matter density parameter omega_m. thisassumption is challenged by the growing evidence from optical and x-rayobservations that the total baryon mass fraction increases towards richclusters. in this context, we investigate the dependence of stellar, and totalbaryon mass fractions as a function of mass. to do so, we used a subsample ofnineteen clusters extracted from the x-ray flux limited sample hiflugcs thathave available dr-7 sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data. from the opticalanalysis we derived the stellar masses. using xmm-newton we derived the gasmasses. then, adopting a scaling relation we estimate the total masses. addingthe gas and the stellar mass fractions we obtain the total baryonic contentthat we find to increase with cluster mass, reaching 7-year wilkinson microwaveanisotropy probe (wmap-7) prediction for clusters with m_500 = 1.6 x 10^{15}m_sun. we observe a decrease of the stellar mass fraction (from 4.5% to ~1.0%)with increasing total mass where our findings for the stellar mass fractionagree with previous studies. this result suggests a difference in the number ofstars formed per unit of halo mass, though with a large scatter for low-masssystems. that is, the efficiency of star formation varies on cluster scale thatlower mass systems are likely to have higher star formation efficiencies. itfollows immediately that the dependence of the stellar mass fraction on totalmass results in an increase of the mass-to-light ratio from lower to highermass systems. we also discuss the consequences of these results in the contextof determining the cosmic matter density parameter omega_m.

1109.0390	star-formation efficiency and metal enrichment of the intracluster  medium in local massive clusters of galaxies	we have investigated the baryon-mass content in a subsample of 19 clusters ofgalaxies extracted from the x-ray flux-limited sample hiflugcs according totheir positions in the sky. for these clusters, we measured total masses andcharacteristic radii on the basis of a rich optical spectroscopic data set, thephysical properties of the intracluster medium (icm) using xmm-newton and rosatx-ray data, and total (galaxy) stellar masses utilizing the sdss dr7 multi-bandimaging. the observed (hot) gas-mass fractions are almost constant in this massrange. we confirm that the stellar mass fraction decreases as the total massincreases and shows (20+/-4)% scatter; in addition, we show that it decreasesas the central entropy increases. the latter behavior supports a twofoldinterpretation where heating from merging quenches the star-formation activityof galaxies in massive systems, and feedback from supernovae and/or radiogalaxies drives a significant amount of gas to the regions beyond r_{500} or,alternatively, a substantially large amount of intracluster light (icl) isassociated with galaxies in nonrelaxed systems. furthermore, less massiveclusters are confirmed to host less gas per unit total mass; however, theyexhibit higher mass fractions in metals, so that their icm is more metal-rich.this again supports the interpretation that in the potential wells of low-masssystems the star-formation efficiency of galaxies was high or, alternatively,some gas is missing from the hot phase of the icm. the former hypothesis ispreferred as the main driver of the mass-dependent metal enrichment since thetotal mass-to-optical luminosity ratio increases as the total mass increases.

1109.0944	the bispectrum covariance beyond gaussianity: a log-normal approach	to investigate and specify the statistical properties of cosmological fieldswith particular attention to possible non-gaussian features, accurate formulaefor the bispectrum and the bispectrum covariance are required. the bispectrumis the lowest-order statistic providing an estimate for non-gaussianities of adistribution, and the bispectrum covariance depicts the errors of thebispectrum measurement and their correlation on different scales. currently,there do exist fitting formulae for the bispectrum and an analytical expressionfor the bispectrum covariance, but the former is not very accurate and thelatter contains several intricate terms and only one of them can be readilyevaluated from the power spectrum of the studied field. neglecting allhigher-order terms results in the gaussian approximation of the bispectrumcovariance. we study the range of validity of this gaussian approximation fortwo-dimensional non-gaussian random fields. for this purpose, we simulategaussian and non-gaussian random fields, the latter represented by log-normalfields and obtained directly from the former by a simple transformation. fromthe simulated fields, we calculate the power spectra, the bispectra, and thecovariance from the sample variance of the bispectra, for different degrees ofnon-gaussianity \alpha, which is equivalent to the skewness on a given angularscale \theta g. we find that the gaussian approximation provides a goodapproximation for \alpha&lt;0.6 and a reasonably accurate approximation for\alpha&lt; 1, both on scales &gt;8\theta g. using results from cosmic shearsimulations, we estimate that the cosmic shear convergence fields are describedby \alpha&lt;0.7 at \theta g~4". we therefore conclude that the gaussianapproximation for the bispectrum covariance is likely to be applicable inongoing and future cosmic shear studies.

1110.4635	optimized detection of shear peaks in weak lensing maps	we present a new method to extract cosmological constraints from weak lensing(wl) peak counts, which we denote as `the hierarchical algorithm'. the idea ofthis method is to combine information from wl maps sequentially smoothed with aseries of filters of different size, from the largest down to the smallest,thus increasing the cosmological sensitivity of the resulting peak function. wecompare the cosmological constraints resulting from the peak abundance measuredin this way and the abundance obtained by using a filter of fixed size, whichis the standard practice in wl peak studies. for this purpose, we employ alarge set of wl maps generated by ray-tracing through n-body simulations, andthe fisher matrix formalism. we find that if low-s/n peaks are included in theanalysis (s/n ~ 3), the hierarchical method yields constraints significantlybetter than the single-sized filtering. for a large future survey such aseuclid or lsst, combined with information from a cmb experiment like planck,the results for the hierarchical (single-sized) method are: \delta n=0.0039(0.004); \delta \omega m=0.002 (0.0045); \delta \sigma 8=0.003 (0.006); \deltaw=0.019 (0.0525). this forecast is conservative, as we assume no knowledge ofthe redshifts of the lenses, and consider a single broad bin for the redshiftsof the sources. if only peaks with s/n &gt;= 6 are considered, then there islittle difference between the results of the two methods. we also examine thestatistical properties of the hierarchical peak function: its covariance matrixhas off-diagonal terms for bins with s/n &lt;= 6 and aperture mass of m &lt; 3 x1e+14 ms/h, the higher bins being largely uncorrelated and therefore welldescribed by a poisson distribution.

1202.1927	towards an understanding of third-order galaxy-galaxy lensing	third-order galaxy-galaxy lensing (g3l) is a next generation galaxy-galaxylensing technique that either measures the excess shear about lens pairs or theexcess shear-shear correlations about lenses. it is clear that these statisticsassess the three-point correlations between galaxy positions and projectedmatter density. for future applications of these novel statistics, we aim at amore intuitive understanding of g3l to isolate the main features that possiblycan be measured. we construct a toy model ("isolated lens model"; ilm) for thedistribution of galaxies and associated matter to determine the measuredquantities of the two g3l correlation functions and traditional galaxy-galaxylensing (ggl) in a simplified context. the ilm presumes single lens galaxies tobe embedded inside arbitrary matter haloes that, however, are statisticallyindependent ("isolated") from any other halo or lens position. in the ilm, theaverage mass-to-galaxy number ratio of clusters of any size cannot change. ggland galaxy clustering alone cannot distinguish an ilm from any more complexscenario. the lens-lens-shear correlator in combination with second-orderstatistics enables us to detect deviations from a ilm, though. this can bequantified by a difference signal defined in the paper. we demonstrate with theilm that this correlator picks up the excess matter distribution about galaxypairs inside clusters. the lens-shear-shear correlator is sensitive tovariations among matter haloes. in principle, it could be devised to constrainthe ellipticities of haloes, without the need for luminous tracers, or maybeeven random halo substructure.

(2011). we generate mock lensing observations for the two models,and then employ fast fourier transform methods to compute second- andthird-order aperture statistics in the simulated fields for various galaxysamples. we find that both models predict qualitatively similar aperturesignals, but there are large quantitative differences. the durham modelpredicts larger amplitudes in general. in both models, red galaxies exhibitstronger aperture signals than blue galaxies. using these aperture measurementsand assuming a linear deterministic bias model, we measure relative bias ratiosof red and blue galaxy samples. we find that a linear deterministic bias isinsufficient to describe the relative clustering of model galaxies below tenarcmin angular scales. dividing galaxies into luminosity bins, the aperturesignals decrease with decreasing luminosity for brighter galaxies, but increaseagain for fainter galaxies. this increase is likely an artifact due to too manyfaint satellite galaxies in massive group and cluster halos predicted by themodels. our study shows that galaxy-galaxy(-galaxy) lensing is a sensitiveprobe of galaxy evolution.

0711.4850	dark matter and baryons in the most x-ray luminous and merging galaxy  cluster rx j1347.5-1145	the galaxy cluster rx j1347-1145 is one of the most x-ray luminous and mostmassive clusters known. its extreme mass makes it a prime target for studyingissues addressing cluster formation and cosmology. in this paper we present newhigh-resolution hst/acs and chandra x-ray data. the high resolution andsensitivity of acs enabled us to detect and quantify several new multiplyimaged sources, we now use a total of eight for the strong lensing analysis.combining this information with shape measurements of weak lensing sources inthe central regions of the cluster, we derive a high-resolution,absolutely-calibrated mass map. this map provides the best availablequantification of the total mass of the central part of the cluster to date. wecompare the reconstructed mass with that inferred from the new chandra x-raydata, and conclude that both mass estimates agree extremely well in theobserved region, namely within 400 / h_70 kpc of the cluster center. inaddition we study the major baryonic components (gas and stars) and hencederive the dark matter distribution in the center of the cluster. we find thatthe dark matter and baryons are both centered on the bcg within theuncertainties (alignment is better than &lt;10 kpc). we measure the corresponding1-d profiles and find that dark matter distribution is consistent with both nfwand cored profiles, indicating that a more extended radial analysis is neededto pinpoint the concentration parameter, and hence the inner slope of the darkmatter profile.

1301.5001	the cosmological information of shear peaks: beyond the abundance	we study the cosmological information of weak lensing (wl) peaks, focusing ontwo other statistics besides their abundance: the stacked tangential-shearprofiles and the peak-peak correlation function. we use a large ensemble ofsimulated wl maps with survey specifications relevant to future missions likeeuclid and lsst, to explore the three peak probes. we find that the correlationfunction of peaks with high signal-to-noise (s/n) measured from fields of size144 sq. deg. has a maximum of ~0.3 at an angular scale ~10 arcmin. for peakswith smaller s/n, the amplitude of the correlation function decreases, and itsmaximum occurs on smaller angular scales. we compare the peak observablesmeasured with and without shape noise and find that for s/n~3 only ~5% of thepeaks are due to large-scale structures, the rest being generated by shapenoise. the covariance matrix of the probes is examined: the correlationfunction is only weakly covariant on scales &lt; 30 arcmin, and slightly more onlarger scales; the shear profiles are very correlated for theta &gt; 2 arcmin,with a correlation coefficient as high as 0.7. using the fisher-matrixformalism, we compute the cosmological constraints for {om_m, sig_8, w, n_s}considering each probe separately, as well as in combination. we find that thecorrelation function of peaks and shear profiles yield marginalized errorswhich are larger by a factor of 2-4 for {om_m, sig_8} than the errors yieldedby the peak abundance alone, while the errors for {w, n_s} are similar. bycombining the three probes, the marginalized constraints are tightened by afactor of ~2 compared to the peak abundance alone, the least contributor to theerror reduction being the correlation function. this work therefore recommendsthat future wl surveys use shear peaks beyond their abundance in order toconstrain the cosmological model.

1302.2401	combining probes of large-scale structure with cosmolike	developing accurate analysis techniques to combine various probes ofcosmology is essential to tighten constraints on cosmological parameters and tocheck for inconsistencies in our model of the universe. in this paper wedevelop a joint analysis framework for six different second-order statisticscalculated from three tracers of the dark matter density field, namely galaxyposition, shear, and magnification. we extend a data compression schemedeveloped in the context of shear-shear statistics (the so-called cosebis) tothe other five second-order statistics, thereby significantly reducing thenumber of data points in the joint data vector. we use cosmolike, a newlydeveloped software framework for joint likelihood analyses, to forecastparameter constraints for the dark energy survey (des). the simulated mcmcscover a five dimensional cosmological parameter space comparing the informationcontent of the individual probes to several combined probes (cp) data vectors.given the significant correlations of these second-order statistics we modelall cross terms in the covariance matrix; furthermore we go beyond the gaussiancovariance approximation and use the halo model to include higher ordercorrelations of the density field. we find that adding magnificationinformation (including cross probes with shear and clustering) noticeablyincreases the information content and that the correct modeling of thecovariance (i.e., accounting for non-gaussianity and cross terms) is essentialfor accurate likelihood contours from the cp data vector. we also identifyseveral nulltests based on the degeneracy of magnification and shear statisticswhich can be used to quantify the contamination of data sets by astrophysicalsystematics and/or calibration issues.

1306.0901	mass-sheet degeneracy, power-law models and external convergence: impact  on the determination of the hubble constant from gravitational lensing	the light travel time differences in strong gravitational lensing systemsallows an independent determination of the hubble constant. this method hasbeen successfully applied to several lens systems. the formally most precisemeasurements are, however, in tension with the recent determination of $h_0$from the planck satellite for a spatially flat six-parameters $\lambda cdm$cosmology. we reconsider the uncertainties of the method, concerning the massprofile of the lens galaxies, and show that the formal precision relies on theassumption that the mass profile is a perfect power law. simple analyticalarguments and numerical experiments reveal that mass-sheet like transformationsyield significant freedom in choosing the mass profile, even when exquisiteeinstein rings are observed. furthermore, the characterization of theenvironment of the lens does not break that degeneracy which is not physicallylinked to extrinsic convergence. we present an illustrative example where themultiple imaging properties of a composite (baryons + dark matter) lens can beextremely well reproduced by a power-law model having the same velocitydispersion, but with predictions for the hubble constant that deviate by $\sim20%$. hence we conclude that the impact of degeneracies between parametrizedmodels have been underestimated in current $h_0$ measurements from lensing, andneed to be carefully reconsidered.

1306.4675	source-position transformation -- an approximate invariance in strong  gravitational lensing	the main obstacle for gravitational lensing to determine accurate masses ofdeflectors, or to determine precise estimates for the hubble constant, is thedegeneracy of lensing observables with respect to the mass-sheet transformation(mst). the mst is a global modification of the mass distribution which leavesall image positions, shapes and flux ratios invariant, but which changes thetime delay. here we show that another global transformation of lensing massdistributions exists which almost leaves image positions and flux ratiosinvariant, and of which the mst is a special case. whereas for axi-symmetriclenses this source position transformation exactly reproduces all stronglensing observables, it does so only approximately for more general lenssituations. we provide crude estimates for the accuracy with which thetransformed mass distribution can reproduce the same image positions as theoriginal lens model, and present an illustrative example of its performance.this new invariance transformation most likely is the reason why the samestrong lensing information can be accounted for with rather different massmodels.

1307.4220	how well can cold-dark-matter substructures account for the observed  lensing flux-ratio anomalies?	lensing flux-ratio anomalies are most likely caused by gravitational lensingby small-scale dark matter structures. these anomalies offer the prospect oftesting a fundamental prediction of the cold dark matter (cdm) cosmologicalmodel: the existence of numerous substructures that are too small to hostvisible galaxies. in two previous studies we found that the number of subhalosin the six high-resolution simulations of cdm galactic halos of the aquariusproject is not sufficient to account for the observed frequency of flux ratioanomalies seen in selected quasars from the class survey. these studies werelimited by the small number of halos used, their narrow range of masses (1-2e12solar masses) and the small range of lens ellipticities considered. we addressthese shortcomings by investigating the lensing properties of a large sample ofhalos with a wide range of masses in two sets of high resolution simulations ofcosmological volumes and comparing them to a currently best available sample ofradio quasars. we find that, as expected, substructures do not change theflux-ratio probability distribution of image pairs and triples with largeseparations, but they have a significant effect on the distribution at smallseparations. for such systems, cdm substructures can account for a substantialfraction of the observed flux-ratio anomalies. for large close-pair separationsystems, the discrepancies existing between the observed flux ratios andpredictions from smooth halo models are attributed to simplifications inherentin these models which do not take account of fine details in the lens massdistributions.

1311.7035	how well do third-order aperture mass statistics separate e- and  b-modes?	with 3rd-order statistics of gravitational shear it will be possible toextract valuable cosmological information from ongoing and future weak lensingsurveys which is not contained in standard 2nd-order statistics, due to thenon-gaussianity of the shear field. aperture mass statistics are an appropriatechoice for 3rd-order statistics due to their simple form and their ability toseparate e- and b-modes of the shear. however, it has been demonstrated that2nd-order aperture mass statistics suffer from e-/b-mode mixing because it isimpossible to reliably estimate the shapes of close pairs of galaxies. thisfinding has triggered developments of several new 2nd-order statisticalmeasures for cosmic shear. whether the same developments are needed for3rd-order shear statistics is largely determined by how severe this e-/b-mixingis for 3rd-order statistics. we test 3rd-order aperture mass statistics againste-/b-mode mixing, and find that the level of contamination is well-described bya function of $\theta/\theta_{\rm min}$, with $\theta_{\rm min}$ being thecut-off scale. at angular scales of $\theta &gt; 10 \;\theta_{\rm min}$, thedecrease in the e-mode signal due to e-/b-mode mixing is smaller than 1percent, and the leakage into b-modes is even less. for typical small-scalecut-offs this e-/b-mixing is negligible on scales larger than a few arcminutes.therefore, 3rd-order aperture mass statistics can safely be used to separate e-and b-modes and infer cosmological information, for ground-based surveys aswell as forthcoming space-based surveys such as euclid.

1406.6152	can one determine cosmological parameters from multi-plane strong lens  systems?	strong gravitational lensing of sources with different redshifts has beenused to determine cosmological distance ratios, which in turn depend on theexpansion history. hence, such systems are viewed as potential tools forconstraining cosmological parameters. here we show that in lens systems withtwo distinct source redshifts, of which the nearest one contributes to thelight deflection towards the more distant one, there exists an invariancetransformation which leaves all strong lensing observables unchanged (exceptthe product of time delay and hubble constant), generalizing the well-knownmass-sheet transformation in single plane lens systems. the transformationpreserves the relative distribution of mass and light, so that a`mass-follows-light' assumption does not fix the mst. all time delays (fromsources on both planes) scale with the same factor -- time-delay ratios aretherefore invariant under the mst. changing cosmological parameters, and thusdistance ratios, is essentially equivalent to such a mass-sheet transformation.as an example, we discuss the double source plane system sdssj0946+1006, whichhas been recently studied by collett and auger, and show that variations ofcosmological parameters within reasonable ranges lead to only a smallmass-sheet transformation in both lens planes. hence, the ability to extractcosmological information from such systems depends heavily on the ability tobreak the mass-sheet degeneracy.

1409.0015	generalized multi-plane gravitational lensing: time delays, recursive  lens equation, and the mass-sheet transformation	we consider several aspects of the generalized multi-plane gravitational lenstheory, in which light rays from a distant source are affected by several maindeflectors, and in addition by the tidal gravitational field of the large-scalematter distribution in the universe when propagating between the maindeflectors. specifically, we derive a simple expression for the time-delayfunction in this case, making use of the general formalism for treating lightpropagation in inhomogeneous spacetimes which leads to the characterization ofdistance matrices between main lens planes. applying fermat's principle, analternative form of the corresponding lens equation is derived, which connectsthe impact vectors in three consecutive main lens planes, and we show that thisform of the lens equation is equivalent to the more standard one. for this,some general relations for cosmological distance matrices are derived. thegeneralized multi-plane lens situation admits a generalized mass-sheettransformation, which corresponds to uniform isotropic scaling in each lensplane, a corresponding scaling of the deflection angle, and the addition of atidal matrix (mass sheet plus external shear) to each main lens. we show thatthe time delay for sources in all lens planes scale with the same factor underthis generalized mass-sheet transformation, thus precluding the use oftime-delay ratios to break the mass-sheet transformation.

1507.07937	lens galaxies in the illustris simulation: power-law models and the bias  of the hubble constant from time-delays	the combination of dynamical and strong gravitational lensing studies ofmassive galaxies shows that their total density profile in the central region(i.e. up to a few half-light radius) can be described by a power law,$\rho(r)\propto r^{-\gamma}$. therefore, such a power-law model is employed fora large number of strong-lensing applications, including the so-calledtime-delay technique used to infer the hubble constant $h_0$. however, sincethe radial scale at which strong lensing features are formed (i.e., theeinstein radius) corresponds to the transition from the dominance of baryonicmatter to dark matter, there is no known reason why galaxies should follow apower law in density. the assumption of a power law artificially breaks themass-sheet degeneracy, a well-known invariance transformation in gravitationallensing which affects the product of hubble constant and time delay and cantherefore cause a bias in the determination of $h_0$ from the time-delaytechnique. in this paper, we use the illustris hydrodynamical simulations toestimate the amplitude of this bias, and to understand how it is related toobservational properties of galaxies. investigating a large sample of illustrisgalaxies that have velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm sie} \geqslant 160$ km/s atredshifts below $z=1$, we find that the bias on $h_0$ introduced by thepower-law assumption can reach 20%-50%, with a scatter of 10%-30% (rms).however, we find that by selecting galaxies with an inferred power-law modelslope close to isothermal, it is possible to reduce the bias on $h_0$ to &lt;5%,and the scatter to &lt;10%. this could potentially be used to form less biasedstatistical samples for $h_0$ measurements in the upcoming large survey era.

astro-ph;0012202	cluster mass profiles from weak lensing ii	in schneider, king &amp; erben (2000) we developed likelihood techniques tocompare the constraints on cluster mass profiles that can be obtained using theshear and magnification information. this work considered circularly symmetricpower-law models for clusters at fairly low redshifts where the redshiftdistribution of source galaxies could be neglected. here this treatment isextended to encompass nfw profiles which are a good description of clustersfrom cosmological n-body simulations, and nfw clusters at higher redshiftswhere the influence of various scenarios for the knowledge of the redshiftdistribution are examined. since in reality the overwhelming majority ofclusters have ellipsoidal rather than spherical profiles, the singularisothermal ellipsoid (sie) is investigated. we also briefly consider the impactof substructure on such a likelihood analysis. in general, we find that theshear information provides a better constraint on the nfw profile underconsideration, so this becomes the focus of what follows. the ability todifferentiate between the nfw and power-law profiles strongly depends on thesize of the data field, and on the number density of galaxies for which anellipticity can be measured. for higher redshift nfw profiles, there is verylittle reduction (~1.5%) in the dispersion of parameter estimates whenspectroscopic redshifts, as opposed to photometric redshift estimates, areavailable for the galaxies used in the lensing analysis.

astro-ph;0104132	smooth maps from clumpy data	we study an estimator for smoothing irregularly sampled data into a smoothmap. the estimator has been widely used in astronomy, owing to its low level ofnoise; it involves a weight function -- or smoothing kernel -- w(\theta). weshow that this estimator is not unbiased, in the sense that the expectationvalue of the smoothed map is not the underlying process convolved with $w$, buta convolution with a modified kernel w_eff(\theta). we show how to calculatew_eff for a given kernel w and investigate its properties. in particular, it isfound that (1) w_eff is normalized, (2) has a shape `similar' to the originalkernel w, (3) converges to w in the limit of high number density of datapoints, and (4) reduces to a top-hat filter in the limit of very small numberdensity of data points. hence, although the estimator is biased, the bias iswell understood analytically, and since w_eff has all the desired properties ofa smoothing kernel, the estimator is in fact very useful. we present explicitexamples for several filter functions which are commonly used, and provide aseries expression valid in the limit of large density of data points.

astro-ph;0111392	the noise of cluster mass reconstructions from a source redshift  distribution	the parameter-free reconstruction of the surface-mass density of clusters ofgalaxies is one of the principal applications of weak gravitational lensing.  from the observable ellipticities of images of background galaxies, the tidalgravitational field (shear) of the mass distribution is estimated, and thecorresponding surface mass density is constructed. the noise of the resultingmass map is investigated here, generalizing previous work which included mainlythe noise due to the intrinsic galaxy ellipticities. whereas this dominates thenoise budget if the lens is very weak, other sources of noise become important,or even dominant, for the medium-strong lensing regime close to the center ofclusters. in particular, shot noise due to a poisson distribution of galaxyimages, and increased shot noise owing to the correlation of galaxies inangular position and redshift, can yield significantly larger levels of noisethan that from the intrinsic ellipticities only. we estimate the contributionsfrom these various effects for two widely used smoothing operations, showingthat one of them effectively removes the poisson and the correlation noisesrelated to angular positions of galaxies. noise sources due to the spread inredshift of galaxies are still present in the optimized estimator and are shownto be relevant in many cases. we show how (even approximate) redshiftinformation can be profitably used to reduce the noise in the mass map. thedependence of the various noise terms on the relevant parameters (lensredshift, strength, smoothing length, redshift distribution of backgroundgalaxies) are explicitly calculated and simple estimates are provided.

astro-ph;0206182	analysis of two-point statistics of cosmic shear: i. estimators and  covariances	we derive in this paper expressions for the covariance matrix of the cosmicshear two-point correlation functions which are readily applied to any surveygeometry. furthermore, we consider the more special case of a simple surveygeometry which allows us to obtain approximations for the covariance matrix interms of integrals which are readily evaluated numerically. these results arethen used to study the covariance of the aperture mass dispersion which hasbeen employed earlier in quantitative cosmic shear analyses. we show that theaperture mass dispersion, measured at two different angular scales, quicklydecorrelates with the ratio of the scales. inverting the relation between theshear two-point correlation functions and the power spectrum of the underlyingprojected matter distribution, we construct estimators for the power spectrumand for the band powers, and show that they yields accurate approximations; inparticular, the correlation between band powers at different wave numbers isquite weak. the covariance matrix of the shear correlation function is thenused to investigate the expected accuracy of cosmological parameter estimatesfrom cosmic shear surveys. depending on the use of prior information, e.g. fromcmb measurements, cosmic shear can yield very accurate determinations ofseveral cosmological parameters, in particular the normalization $\sigma_8$ ofthe power spectrum of the matter distribution, the matter density parameter$\omega_{\rm m}$, and the shape parameter $\gamma$.

astro-ph;0207454	the three-point correlation function of cosmic shear: i. the natural  components	previous work on three-point statistics of cosmic shear has mainlyconcentrated on the convergence, or on aperture measures of the shear. however,as has become clear recently for the two-point statistics of cosmic shear, thebasic quantity that should be used is the correlation function: first, it ismuch easier to measure from observational data, since it is immune againstcomplicated geometries of data fields; second, all other (linear) 2-ptstatistics can be expressed as integrals over the correlation function. thesituation is the same for the 3-pt statistics. however, in contrast to the 2-ptcorrelation function, the invariants of the shear 3-pt correlation functionhave not been employed yet. here we consider the transformation properties ofthe shear 3-pt correlation function under rotations. we show that there arefour complex linear combinations of components of the 3-pt correlationfunction, which we shall call `natural components', since they are multipliedjust by a phase factor for arbitrary rotations, but do not mix. in particular,their moduli are invariant under rotations and thus (non-linear) invariants ofthe 3-pt correlation function. in terms of these natural components, theinvariance of the statistical properties of the shear field under paritytransformations are easily obtained. our results do not apply only to cosmicshear, but also to other quantities with the same mathematical properties --that of a polar. for example, practically every relation derived here appliesalso to the polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation.

astro-ph;0208256	suppressing the contribution of intrinsic galaxy alignments to the shear  two-point correlation function	cosmological weak lensing gives rise to correlations in the ellipticities offaint galaxies. this cosmic shear signal depends upon the matter powerspectrum, thus providing a means to constrain cosmological parameters. it hasrecently been proposed that intrinsic alignments arising at the epoch of galaxyformation can also contribute significantly to the observed correlations, theamplitude increasing with decreasing survey depth. here we consider thetwo-point shear correlation function, and demonstrate that photometric redshiftinformation can be used to suppress the intrinsic signal; at the same timepoisson noise is increased, due to a decrease in the effective number of galaxypairs. the choice to apply such a redshift-depending weighting will depend onthe characteristics of the survey in question. in surveys with a mean z ofabout 1, although the lensing signal dominates, the measurement error bars maysoon become smaller than the intrinsic alignment signal; hence, in order not tobe dominated by systematics, redshift information in cosmic shear statisticswill become a necessity. we discuss various aspects of this.

(2) the inversion formula isexact only if one assumes observational data on the whole lens plane, whereasin reality, the size of the data field is limited by the size of the ccd. wehave considered a possible solution to the first problem in a previous paper.here we consider the second problem. it is shown that the application of theinversion formula to a finite data field induces systemmatic boundary effects.an alternative inversion formula is derived, based on some recently publishedresults by kaiser. we demonstrate, using synthetic data, that this newinversion formula which does not require an extrapolation of the data beyondthe observed region, yields results which are comparable with those from thekaiser \&amp; squires inversion in their `noise levels', but lack the systemmaticboundary effects.

astro-ph;9503096	cluster lens reconstruction using only observed local data -- an  improved finite-field inversion technique	gravitational light deflection can distort the images of distant sources byits tidal effects. the population of faint blue galaxies is at sufficientlyhigh redshift so that their images are distorted near foreground clusters, withgiant luminous arcs being the most spectacular evidence for this effect. muchweaker distortions, however, can observationally be detected by a statisticalanalysis of the numerous faint galaxy images, as first demonstrated by tyson,valdes \&amp; wenk. this distortion effect can be used as a {\it quantitativetool}for the reconstruction of the surface mass density of galaxy clusters withappropriate redshifts, as was demonstrated by kaiser \&amp;squires. they havederived an explicit equation for this surface mass density in terms of itstidal field. the reconstruction formula by kaiser \&amp; squires must be modifiedbecause of two effects: in its original form it applies only to weak lenses,and hence must be generalized to account for stronger lensing effects. second,due to the nature of the inversion formula, it produces boundary artefacts (orbiases) if applied to real data which are confined to a finite field on thesky. we discuss several possibilities to obtain inversion formulae which areexact for ideal data on a finite data field (ccd). we demonstrate that thereexists an infinite number of such finite-field inversion formulae, which differin their sensitivity to observational effects (such as noise, intrinsicellipticities of the sources, etc.). we show that, using two simple conditions,one can uniquely specify a finite-field formula which in a well-defined senseminimizes the sensitivity to observational effects. we then use synthetic datato compare the quality of our new reconstruction method with that of previous

astro-ph;9601039	detection of (dark) matter concentrations via weak gravitational lensing	the distortion of images of faint background galaxies by (weak) gravitationallensing can be used to measure the mass distribution of the deflector. theimage distortions can be used to define a weighted mean of the mass inside acircular aperture, as was first suggested by kaiser. the aperture mass can beused to {\it detect} dark matter concentrations. keeping in mind thatwide-field cameras will become increasingly available, this method can be usedto search for mass concentrations on wide-field images. to do this, theaperture mass measure is generalized to account for different weightingfunctions. for each such weighting function, a signal-to-noise ratio can becalculated. for an assumed mass profile of the density concentrations, theweighting function can be chosen such as to maximize the resultingsignal-to-noise ratio. numerical simulations which adopt parameterscharacteristic of 4-m class telescopes are then used to show that dark haloswith a velocity dispersion in excess of $\sim 600$\ts km/s can be reliablydetected as significant peaks in the signal-to-noise map. the effects of seeingand an anisotropic psf are then investigated and shown to be less importantthan might be feared. it is thus suggested that the method of aperture massmeasures developed here can be used to obtain a mass-selected sample of darkhalos, in contrast to flux-selected samples. shear fields around high-redshiftbright qsos as detected by fort et al. provide a first successful applicationof this strategy. the simplicity of the method allows its routine applicationto wide-field images of sufficient depth and image quality.

astro-ph;9601078	the mass distribution of cl0939+4713 obtained from a `weak' lensing  analysis of a wfpc2 image	the image distortions of high-redshift galaxies caused by gravitational lightdeflection of foreground clusters of galaxies can be used to reconstruct thetwo-dimensional surface mass density of these clusters. we apply an unbiasedparameter-free reconstruction technique to the cluster cl0939+4713 (abell 851),observed with the wfpc2 on board of the hst. we demonstrate that a single deepwfpc2 observation can be used for cluster mass reconstruction despite its smallfield of view and the irregular shape of the data field (especially for distantclusters). for cl0939, we find a strong correlation between the reconstructedmass distribution and the bright cluster galaxies indicating that mass followslight on average. the detected anti-correlation between the faint galaxies andthe reconstructed mass is most likely an effect of the magnification (anti)bias, which was detected previously in the cluster a1689. because of the highredshift of cl0939 (z_d=0.41), the redshift distribution of the lensed, faintgalaxies has to be accounted for in the reconstruction technique. we derive anapproximate global transformation for the surface mass density which leaves themean image ellipticities invariant, resulting in an uncertainty in thenormalization of the mass. from the non-negativity of the surface mass density,we derive lower limits on the mass inside the observed field. we can break theinvariance transformation for the mass using the magnification effect on theobserved number density of the background galaxies. assuming a mean redshift of0.8 and a fraction of 15 % (20 %) of cluster galaxies in the observed galaxysample with 23&lt;r&lt;25.5 we obtain for the mass inside the field approximately 5(7) x 10**{14}/ h_{50} solar masses which corresponds to m/l ~ 100 (140)h_{50}.

astro-ph;9601079	steps towards nonlinear cluster inversion through gravitational  distortions: iii. including a redshift distribution of the sources	in a series of previous papers we have considered the reconstruction of thesurface mass density of a cluster of galaxies from images of lensed faintbackground galaxies. we showed that the reconstructed surface mass density isnot uniquely determined, but that there exists a global invariancetransformation that leaves the shape of the images of the lensed galaxiesunchanged. because of this, only lower limits on the total mass of a clustercan be derived if no further informations besides image ellipticities are used.throughout these papers we used the simplifying assumption that all sources areat the same redshift. in this paper we account for a redshift distribution ofthe faint galaxies, and in particular, some of these galaxies can lie in frontof the cluster or can be cluster members. we show how the mass distribution ofa cluster of galaxies can be obtained from images of these faint galaxies, ifthe redshift distribution of these galaxies is known. we demonstrate that forthe reconstruction of non-critical clusters we need less information on theredshift distribution of the galaxies, i.e., we only need to know two or threemoments of the distribution. we show that the mean mass density across the datafield is still a free variable, i.e., there remains a global invariancetransformation of the resulting mass density field. for non-critical clusterswe can derive the transformation explicitly and it is similar to that derivedpreviously for the case of a single redshift of the sources. we discuss severaltheoretical ideas to break the mass degeneracy; of those considered, we findthat only the magnification effect on the number density of galaxy images canbe used successfully in practice.

astro-ph;9601125	reanalysis of the association of high-redshift 1-jansky quasars with  iras galaxies	we develop a new statistical method to reanalyse angular correlations betweenbackground qsos and foreground galaxies that are supposed to be a consequenceof dark matter inhomogeneities acting as weak gravitational lenses. the methodis based on a weighted average over the galaxy positions and is optimized todistinguish between a random distribution of galaxies around qsos and adistribution which follows an assumed qso-galaxy two-point correlationfunction, by choosing an appropriate weight function. with simulations wedemonstrate that this weighted average is slightly more significant thanspearman's rank-order test which was used in previous investigations. inparticular, the advantages of the weighted average show up if the two-pointcorrelation function is weak. we then reanalyze the correlation betweenhigh-redshift 1-jansky qsos and iras galaxies, taken from the iras faint sourcecatalog; these samples were analyzed previously using spearman's rank-ordertest. in agreement with the previous work, we find moderate to strongcorrelations between these two samples; considering the angular two-pointcorrelation function of these samples, we find a typical scale of order $5'$from which most of the correlation signal derives. however, the statisticalsignificance of the correlation changes with the redshift slices of the qsosample one considers. comparing with simple theoretical estimates of theexpected correlation, we find that the signal we derive is considerablystronger than expected. on the other hand, recent direct verifications of theoverdensity of matter in the line-of-sight to high-redshift radio qsos obtainedfrom the shear field around these sources, indicates that the observedassociation can be attributed to a gravitational lens effect.

astro-ph;9601164	the lightcurve reconstruction method for measuring the time delay of  gravitational lens systems	we propose a new technique to measure the time delay of radio-loudgravitational lens systems, which does not rely on the excessive use ofinterferometric observations. instead, the method is based on single-dish fluxdensity monitoring of the (unresolved) lens system's total lightcurve, combinedwith additional interferometric measurements of the flux density ratio at a fewepochs during that monitoring period. the basic idea of the method is toreconstruct the individual image lightcurves from the observed total lightcurveby assuming a range of potential values for the time delay and themagnification ratio of the images. it is then possible to single out thecorrect reconstruction, and therefore determine the time delay, by checking theconsistency of the reconstructed individual lightcurves with the additionalinterferometric observations. we performed extensive numerical simulations ofsynthetic lightcurves to investigate the dependence of the performance of thismethod on various parameters which are involved in the problem. probably themost promising candidates for applying the method (and also for determining thehubble constant) are lens systems consisting of multiply imaged compact sourcesand an einstein ring, such as b0218+357 from which some of the parameters usedfor our simulations were adopted.

astro-ph;9601190	quantitative analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing	in this paper we explore a quantitative and efficient method to constrain thehalo properties of distant galaxy populations through ``galaxy--galaxy" lensingand show that the mean masses and sizes of halos can be estimated accurately,without excessive data requirements. specifically, we propose amaximum-likelihood analysis which takes full account of the actual imageellipticities, positions and apparent magnitudes. we apply it to simulatedobservations, using the same model for the lensing galaxy population as in bbs,where the galaxy halos are described by isothermal spheres with velocitydispersion $\sigma$, truncated at a radius $s$. both parameters are assumed toscale with the luminosity of the galaxy. the best fitting values are thendetermined with the maximum-likelihood analysis. we explore two differentobserving strategies, (a) taking deep images (e.g., with hst) on small fields,and (b) using shallower images on larger fields. we find that $\sigma_*$ can bedetermined to $\lesssim$10\% accuracy if a sample of about 5000 galaxies withmeasured ellipticities are available, down to $r\lesssim 23$. alternatively,the same accuracy in the determination of $\sigma_*$ can be achieved from aboutten, moderately deep wfpc2 fields, on which galaxy shapes can be measured toabout $r\sim 25$ and for which ground-based images are available on which thewfpc2 fields are centered. firm lower limits can be set on the radial extent ofthe halo, but the maximal halo extent is poorly constrained. we show that thelikelihood approach can also be used to constrain other parameters of thegalaxy population, such as the tully-fischer index, or the mean redshift of thegalaxies as a function of apparent magnitude. finally we show how multi-colorinformation, constraining the redshift of individual galaxies, can dramatically

astro-ph;9607095	aperture multipole moments from weak gravitational lensing	the projected mass of a gravitational lens inside (circular) apertures can bederived from the measured shear inside an annulus which is caused by the tidalfield of the deflecting mass distribution. here we show that also themultipoles of the two-dimensional mass distribution can be derived from theshear in annuli. we derive several expressions for these mass multipole momentsin terms of the shear, which allow large flexibility in the choice of a radialweight function. in contrast to determining multipole moments from weak-lensingmass reconstructions, this approach allows to quantify the signal-to-noiseratio of the multipole moments directly from the observed galaxy ellipticities,and thus to estimate the significance of the multipole detection. radial weightfunctions can therefore be chosen such as to optimize the significance of thedetection given an assumed radial mass profile. application of our formulae tonumerically simulated clusters demonstrates that the quadrupole moment ofrealistic cluster models can be detected with high signal-to-noise ratio s/n;in about 85 per cent of the simulated cluster fields s/n &gt;~ 3. we also showthat the shear inside a circular annulus determines multipole moments insideand outside the annulus. this is relevant for clusters whose central region istoo bright to allow the observation of the shear of background galaxies, orwhich extend beyond the ccd. we also generalize the aperture mass equation tothe case of `radial' weight functions which are constant on arbitrarily-shapedcurves which are not necessarily self-similar.

astro-ph;9706185	the cosmological lens equation and the equivalent single-plane  gravitational lens	the gravitational lens equation resulting from a single (non-linear) massconcentration (the main lens) plus inhomogeneities of the large-scale structureis shown to be strictly equivalent to the single-plane gravitational lensequation without the cosmological perturbations. the deflection potential (and,by applying the poisson equation, also the mass distribution) of the equivalentsingle-plane lens is derived. if the main lens is described by ellipticalisopotential curves plus a shear term, the equivalent single-plane lens will beof the same form. due to the equivalence shown, the determination of the hubbleconstant from time delay measurements is affected by the same mass-sheetinvariance transformation as for the single-plane lens. if the lens strength isfixed (e.g., by measuring the velocity dispersion of stars in the main lens),the determination of $h_0$ is affected by inhomogeneous matter between us andthe lens. the orientation of the mass distribution relative to the imagepositions is the same for the cosmological lens situation and the single-planecase. in particular this implies that cosmic shear cannot account for amisalignment of the observed galaxy orientation relative to the best-fittinglens model.

astro-ph;9707044	constraining the mass distribution of cluster galaxies by weak lensing	analysing the weak lensing distortions of the images of faint backgroundgalaxies provides a means to constrain the average mass distribution of clustergalaxies and potentially to test the extent of their dark matter haloes as afunction of the density of their environment. the observable image distortionsare a consequence of the interplay between the effects of a global cluster massdistribution and the perturbations due to individual cluster galaxies. startingfrom a reconstruction of the cluster mass distribution with conventionaltechniques, we apply a maximum likelihood method to infer the averageproperties of an ensemble of cluster galaxies. from simulations this approachis found to be reliable as long as the galaxies including their dark matterhaloes only contribute a small fraction to the total mass of the system. iftheir haloes are extended, the galaxies contain a substantial mass fraction. inthis case our method is still applicable in the outer regions of clusters,where the surface mass density is low, but yields biased estimates of theparameters describing the mass profiles of the cluster galaxies in the centralpart of the cluster. in that case it will be necessary to resort to moresophisticated strategies by modelling cluster galaxies and an underlying globalmass distribution simultaneously. we conclude that galaxy-galaxy lensing inclusters provides a unique means to probe the presence and extent of darkhaloes of cluster galaxies.

astro-ph;9707187	evidence for substructure in lens galaxies?	we discuss whether one should expect that multiply imaged qsos can beunderstood with `simple' lens models which contain a handful of parameters.whereas for many lens systems such simple mass models yield a remarkably gooddescription of the observed properties, there are some systems which arenotoriously difficult to understand quantitatively. we argue that at least inone case (b 1422+231) these difficulties are not due to a `wrong'parametrization of the lens model, but that the discrepancy between observedand model-predicted flux ratios are due to substructure in the lens. similar tomicrolensing for optical fluxes, such substructure can distort also the radioflux ratios predicted by `simple' mass models, in particular for highlymagnified images, without appreciably changing image positions. substructurealso does not change the time delay significantly and therefore has littleeffect on the determination of the hubble constant using time delays. wequantify these statements with several simple scenarios for substructure, andpropose a strategy to model lens systems in which substructure is suspected.

astro-ph;9708143	a new measure for cosmic shear	we consider here a new statistical measure for cosmic shear, the aperturemass map, which is defined as a spatially filtered projected density field andwhich can be measured directly from the image distortions of high-redshiftgalaxies. by selecting an appropriate spatial filter function, the dispersionof the aperture mass is a convolution of the power spectrum of the projecteddensity field with a narrow kernel, so that &lt;map**2(theta)&gt; provides a welllocalized estimate of the power spectrum at wavenumbers s~5/theta. we calculate&lt;map**2(theta)&gt; for various cosmological models, using the fully non-linearpower spectrum of the cosmic density fluctuations. the non-linear evolutionyields a significant increase of &lt;map**2&gt; relative to the linear growth onscales below ~0.5 degree. the third-order moment of map can be used to define askewness, which is a measure of the non-gaussianity of the density field. wepresent the first calculation of the skewness of the shear in the frame ofquasi-linear theory of structure growth. we show that it yields a sensitivemeasure of the cosmological model; in particular, it is independent of thenormalization of the power spectrum. several practical estimates for &lt;map**2&gt;are constructed and their dispersions calculated. we show that one sq.deg. of ahigh-quality image is sufficient to detect the cosmic shear with themap-statistics on scales below ~10 arcmin, and to estimate its amplitude withan accuracy of ~30% on scales below ~5 arcmin.

astro-ph;9806071	statistics of dark matter haloes expected from weak lensing surveys	the distortion of the images of faint high-redshift galaxies can be used toprobe the intervening mass distribution. this weak gravitational lensing effecthas been used recently to study the (projected) mass distribution of severalclusters at intermediate and high redshifts. in addition, the weak lensingeffect can be employed to detect (dark) matter concentrations in the universe,based on their mass properties alone. thus it is feasible to obtain amass-selected sample of `clusters', and thereby probe the full range of theirmass-to-light ratios. we study the expected number density of such haloes whichcan be detected in ongoing and future deep wide-field imaging surveys, usingthe number density of haloes as predicted by the press-schechter theory, andmodeling their mass profile by the `universal' density profile found bynavarro, frenk &amp; white. we find that in all cosmological models considered, thenumber density of haloes with a signal-to-noise ratio larger than 5 exceeds 10per square degree. with the planned megacam imaging survey of $\sim 25 deg^2$,it will be easily possible to distinguish between the most commonly discussedcosmological parameter sets.

astro-ph;9904192	the non-gaussian tail of cosmic-shear statistics	due to gravitational instability, an initially gaussian density fielddevelops non-gaussian features as the universe evolves. the most prominentnon-gaussian features are massive haloes, visible as clusters of galaxies. thedistortion of high-redshift galaxy images due to the tidal gravitational fieldof the large-scale matter distribution, called cosmic shear, can be used toinvestigate the statistical properties of the lss. in particular, non-gaussianproperties of the lss will lead to a non-gaussian distribution of cosmic-shearstatistics. the aperture mass ($m_{\rm ap}$) statistics, recently introduced asa measure for cosmic shear, is particularly well suited for measuring thesenon-gaussian properties. in this paper we calculate the highly non-gaussiantail of the aperture mass probability distribution, assuming press-schechtertheory for the halo abundance and the `universal' density profile of haloes asobtained from numerical simulations. we find that for values of $m_{\rm ap}$much larger than its dispersion, this probability distribution is closelyapproximated by an exponential, rather than a gaussian. we determine theamplitude and shape of this exponential for various cosmological models andaperture sizes, and show that wide-field imaging surveys can be used todistinguish between some of the currently most popular cosmogonies. our studyhere is complementary to earlier cosmic-shear investigations which focussedmore on two-point statistical properties.

0810.4254	dependence of cosmic shear covariances on cosmology - impact on  parameter estimation	in cosmic shear likelihood analyses the covariance is most commonly assumedto be constant in parameter space. therefore, when calculating the covariancematrix (analytically or from simulations), its underlying cosmology should notinfluence the likelihood contours. we examine whether the aforementionedassumption holds and quantify how strong cosmic shear covariances vary within areasonable parameter range. furthermore, we examine the impact on likelihoodcontours when assuming different cosmologies in the covariance. we find thatcovariances vary significantly within the considered parameter range(omega_m=[0.2;0.4], sigma_8=[0.6;1.0]) and that this has a non-negligibleimpact on the size of likelihood contours. this impact increases withincreasing survey size, increasing number density of source galaxies,decreasing ellipticity noise, and when using non-gaussian covariances. toimprove on the assumption of a constant covariance we present two methods. theadaptive covariance is the most accurate method, but it is computationallyexpensive. to reduce the computational costs we give a scaling relation forcovariances. as a second method we outline the concept of an iterativelikelihood analysis. here, we additionally account for non-gaussianity using aray-tracing covariance derived from the millennium simulation.
