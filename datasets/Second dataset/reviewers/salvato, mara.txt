0903.2062	the chandra cosmos survey, i: overview and point source catalog	the chandra cosmos survey (c-cosmos) is a large, 1.8 ms, chandra} programthat has imaged the central 0.5 sq.deg of the cosmos field (centered at 10h,+02deg) with an effective exposure of ~160ksec, and an outer 0.4sq.deg. areawith an effective exposure of ~80ksec. the limiting source detection depths are1.9e-16 erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the soft (0.5-2 kev) band, 7.3e(-16) erg cm^-2 s^-1in the hard (2-10 kev) band, and 5.7e(-16) erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the full (0.5-10kev) band. here we describe the strategy, design and execution of the c-cosmossurvey, and present the catalog of 1761 point sources detected at a probabilityof being spurious of &lt;2e(-5) (1655 in the full, 1340 in the soft, and 1017 inthe hard bands). by using a grid of 36 heavily (~50%) overlapping pointingpositions with the acis-i imager, a remarkably uniform (to 12%) exposure acrossthe inner 0.5 sq.deg field was obtained, leading to a sharply defined lowerflux limit. the widely different psfs obtained in each exposure at each pointin the field required a novel source detection method, because of theoverlapping tiling strategy, which is described in a companion paper. (puccettiet al. paper ii). this method produced reliable sources down to a 7-12 counts,as verified by the resulting logn-logs curve, with sub-arcsecond positions,enabling optical and infrared identifications of virtually all sources, asreported in a second companion paper (civano et al. paper iii). the fullcatalog is described here in detail, and is available on-line.

0905.1123	observational limits on type 1 agn accretion rate in cosmos	we present black hole masses and accretion rates for 182 type 1 agn incosmos. we estimate masses using the scaling relations for the broad hb, mgii,and civ emission lines in the redshift ranges 0.16&lt;z&lt;0.88, 1&lt;z&lt;2.4, and2.7&lt;z&lt;4.9. we estimate the accretion rate using an eddington ratio l_i/l_eddestimated from optical and x-ray data. we find that very few type 1 agn accretebelow l_i/l_edd ~ 0.01, despite simulations of synthetic spectra which showthat the survey is sensitive to such type 1 agn. at lower accretion rates theblr may become obscured, diluted or nonexistent. we find evidence that type 1agn at higher accretion rates have higher optical luminosities, as more oftheir emission comes from the cool (optical) accretion disk with respect toshorter wavelengths. we measure a larger range in accretion rate than previousworks, suggesting that cosmos is more efficient at finding low accretion ratetype 1 agn. however the measured range in accretion rate is still comparable tothe intrinsic scatter from the scaling relations, suggesting that type 1 agnaccrete at a narrow range of eddington ratio, with l_i/l_edd ~ 0.1.

0907.5199	massive galaxies in cosmos: evolution of black hole versus bulge mass  but not versus total stellar mass over the last 9 gyrs?	we constrain the ratio of black hole (bh) mass to total stellar mass oftype-1 agn in the cosmos survey at 1&lt;z&lt;2. for 10 agn at mean redshift z~1.4with both hst/acs and hst/nicmos imaging data we are able to compute totalstellar mass m_(*,total), based on restframe uv-to-optical host galaxy colorswhich constrain mass-to-light ratios. all objects have virial bh mass-estimatesavailable from the cosmos magellan/imacs and zcosmos surveys. we find zerodifference between the m_bh--m_(*,total)-relation at z~1.4 and them_bh--m_(*,bulge)-relation in the local universe.  our interpretation is: (a) if our objects were purely bulge-dominated, them_bh--m_(*,bulge)-relation has not evolved since z~1.4. however, (b) since wehave evidence for substantial disk components, the bulges of massive galaxies(logm_(*,total)=11.1+-0.25 or logm_bh~8.3+-0.2) must have grown over the last 9gyrs predominantly by redistribution of disk- into bulge-mass. since allnecessary stellar mass exists in the galaxy at z=1.4, no star-formation oraddition of external stellar material is required, only a redistribution e.g.induced by minor and major merging or through disk instabilities. merging, inaddition to redistributing mass in the galaxy, will add both bh andstellar/bulge mass, but does not change the overall final m_bh/m_(*,bulge)ratio.  since the overall cosmic stellar and bh mass buildup trace each other tightlyover time, our scenario of bulge-formation in massive galaxies is independentof any strong bh-feedback and means that the mechanism coupling bh and bulgemass until the present is very indirect.

0910.2672	the nature of optically dull active galactic nuclei in cosmos	we present infrared, optical, and x-ray data of 48 x-ray bright, opticallydull agns in the cosmos field. these objects exhibit the x-ray luminosity of anactive galactic nucleus (agn) but lack broad and narrow emission lines in theiroptical spectrum. we show that despite the lack of optical emission lines, mostof these optically dull agns are not well-described by a typical passive redgalaxy spectrum: instead they exhibit weak but significant blue emission likean unobscured agn. photometric observations over several years additionallyshow significant variability in the blue emission of four optically dull agns.the nature of the blue and infrared emission suggest that the opticallyinactive appearance of these agns cannot be caused by obscuration intrinsic tothe agns. instead, up to ~70% of optically dull agns are diluted by theirhosts, with bright or simply edge-on hosts lying preferentially within thespectroscopic aperture. the remaining ~30% of optically dull agns haveanomalously high f_x/f_o ratios and are intrinsically weak, not obscured, inthe optical. these optically dull agns are best described as a weakly accretingagn with a truncated accretion disk from a radiatively inefficient accretionflow.

1008.2932	decomposing star formation and active galactic nucleus with spitzer  mid-infrared spectra: luminosity functions and co-evolution	we present spitzer 7-38um spectra for a 24um flux limited sample of galaxiesat z~0.7 in the cosmos field. the detailed high-quality spectra allow us tocleanly separate star formation (sf) and active galactic nucleus (agn) inindividual galaxies. we first decompose mid-infrared luminosity functions(lfs). we find that the sf 8um and 15um lfs are well described by schechterfunctions. agns dominate the space density at high luminosities, which leads tothe shallow bright-end slope of the overall mid-infrared lfs. the totalinfrared (8-1000um) lf from 70um selected galaxies shows a shallower bright-endslope than the bolometrically corrected sf 15um lf, owing to the intrinsicdispersion in the mid-to-far-infrared spectral energy distributions. we thenstudy the contemporary growth of galaxies and their supermassive black holes(bhs). seven of the 31 luminous infrared galaxies with spitzer spectra hostluminous agns, implying an agn duty cycle of 23+/-9%. the time-averaged ratioof bh accretion rate and sf rate matches the local m_bh-m_bulge relation andthe m_bh-m_host relation at z ~ 1. these results favor co-evolution scenariosin which bh growth and intense sf happen in the same event but the former spansa shorter lifetime than the latter. finally, we compare our mid-infraredspectroscopic selection with other agn identification methods and discusscandidate compton-thick agns in the sample. while only half of the mid-infraredspectroscopically selected agns are detected in x-ray, ~90% of them can beidentified with their near-infrared spectral indices.

1009.3265	the bulk of the black hole growth since z~1 occurs in a secular  universe: no major merger-agn connection	what is the relevance of major mergers and interactions as triggeringmechanisms for active galactic nuclei (agn) activity? to answer thislongstanding question, we analyze 140 xmm-selected agn host galaxies and amatched control sample of 1264 inactive galaxies over z~0.3-1.0 andlog(m_*/m_sun)&lt;11.7 with high-resolution hst/acs imaging from the cosmos field.the visual analysis of their morphologies by 10 independent human classifiersyields a measure of the fraction of distorted morphologies in the agn andcontrol samples, i.e. quantifying the signature of recent mergers which mightpotentially be responsible for fueling/triggering the agn. we find that (1) thevast majority (&gt;85%) of the agn host galaxies do not show strong distortions,and (2) there is no significant difference in the distortion fractions betweenactive and inactive galaxies. our findings provide the best direct evidencethat, since z~1, the bulk of black hole accretion has not been triggered bymajor galaxy mergers, therefore arguing that the alternative mechanisms, i.e.,secular processes and minor interactions, are the leading triggers for theepisodes of major black hole growth. we also exclude an alternativeinterpretation of our results: a significant time lag between merging and theobservability of the agn phase could wash out the most significant mergingsignatures, explaining the lack of enhancement of strong distortions on the agnhosts. we show that this alternative scenario is unlikely due to: (1) recentmajor mergers being ruled out for the majority of sources due to the highfraction of disk-hosted agn, (2) the lack of a significant x-ray signal inmerging inactive galaxies as a signature of a potential buried agn, and (3) thelow levels of soft x-ray obscuration for agn hosted by interacting galaxies, incontrast to model predictions.

1009.3276	hot-dust-poor type 1 active galactic nuclei in the cosmos survey	we report a sizable class of type 1 active galactic nuclei (agns) withunusually weak near-infrared (1-3{\mu}m) emission in the xmm-cosmos type 1 agnsample. the fraction of these "hot-dust-poor" agns increases with redshift from6% at lowredshift (z &lt; 2) to 20% at moderate high redshift (2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5). thereis no clear trend of the fraction with other parameters: bolometric luminosity,eddington ratio, black hole mass, and x-ray luminosity. the 3{\mu}m emissionrelative to the 1{\mu}m emission is a factor of 2-4 smaller than the typicalelvis et al. agn spectral energy distribution (sed), which indicates a "torus"covering factor of 2%-29%, a factor of 3-40 smaller than required by unifiedmodels. the weak hot dust emission seems to expose an extension of theaccretion disk continuum in some of the source seds. we estimate the outer edgeof their accretion disks to lie at $(0.3-2.0) /times 10^4$ schwarzschild radii,~10-23 times the gravitational stability radii. formation scenarios for thesesources are discussed.

1010.0688	an x-ray selected galaxy cluster in the lockman hole at redshift 1.753	we have discovered an x-ray selected galaxy cluster with a spectroscopicredshift of 1.753. the redshift is of the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg), whichis coincident with the peak of the x-ray surface brightness. we also haveconcordant photometric redshifts for seven additional candidate clustermembers. the x-ray luminosity of the cluster is 3.68 +/- 0.70 x 10^43 erg s^-1in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band. the optical/ir properties of the bcg imply itsformation redshift was ~5 if its stars formed in a short burst. this resultcontinues the trend from lower redshift in which the observed properties ofbcgs are most simply explained by a monolithic collapse at very high redshiftinstead of the theoretically preferred gradual hierarchical assembly at latertimes. however the models corresponding to different formation redshifts aremore clearly separated as our observation epoch approaches the galaxy formationepoch. although our infrared photometry is not deep enough to define a redsequence, we do identify a few galaxies at the cluster redshift that have theexpected red sequence photometric properties.

1011.6370	the star formation history of mass-selected galaxies in the cosmos field	we explore the evolution of the specific star formation rate (ssfr) for3.6um-selected galaxies of different m_* in the cosmos field. the average sfrfor sub-sets of these galaxies is estimated with stacked 1.4ghz radio continuumemission. we separately consider the total sample and a subset of galaxies (sf)that shows evidence for substantive recent star formation in the rest-frameoptical sed. at 0.2&lt;z&lt;3 both populations show a strong and m_*-independentdecrease in their ssfr towards z=0.2, best described by a power- law (1+z)^n,where n~4.3 for all galaxies and n~3.5 for sf sources. the decrease appears tohave started at z&gt;2, at least above 4x10^10m_sun where our conclusions are mostrobust. we find a tight correlation with power-law dependence, ssfr (m_*)^beta,between ssfr and m_* at all z. it tends to flatten below ~10^10m_sun ifquiescent galaxies are included; if they are excluded a shallow index beta_sfg-0.4 fits the correlation. on average, higher m_* objects always have lowerssfrs, also among sf galaxies. at z&gt;1.5 there is tentative evidence for anupper ssfr-limit that an average galaxy cannot exceed. it is suggested by aflattening of the ssfr-m_* relation (also for sf sources), but affects massive(&gt;10^10m_sun) galaxies only at the highest z. below z=1.5 there thus is nodirect evidence that galaxies of higher m_* experience a more rapid waning oftheir ssfr than lower m_* sf systems. in this sense, the data rule out anystrong 'downsizing'. we combine our results with recent measurements of thegalaxy (stellar) mass function in order to determine the characteristic mass ofa sf galaxy (m_*=10^(10.6\pm0.4)m_sun). in this sense, too, there is no'downsizing'. our analysis constitutes the most extensive sfr densitydetermination with a single technique to z=3. recent herschel results areconsistent with our results, but rely on far smaller samples.

1103.0276	accretion rate and the physical nature of unobscured active galaxies	we show how accretion rate governs the physical properties of a sample ofunobscured broad-line, narrow-line, and lineless active galactic nuclei (agns).we avoid the systematic errors plaguing previous studies of agn accretion rateby using accurate accretion luminosities (l_int) from well-sampledmultiwavelength seds from the cosmic evolution survey (cosmos), and accurateblack hole masses derived from virial scaling relations (for broad-line agns)or host-agn relations (for narrow-line and lineless agns). in general, broademission lines are present only at the highest accretion rates (l_int/l_edd &gt;0.01), and these rapidly accreting agns are observed as broad-line agns orpossibly as obscured narrow-line agns. narrow-line and lineless agns at lowerspecific accretion rates (l_int/l_edd &lt; 0.01) are unobscured and yet lack abroad line region. the disappearance of the broad emission lines is caused byan expanding radiatively inefficient accretion flow (riaf) at the inner radiusof the accretion disk. the presence of the riaf also drives l_int/l_edd &lt; 10^-2narrow-line and lineless agns to 10 times higher ratios of radio to optical/uvemission than l_int/l_edd &gt; 0.01 broad-line agns, since the unbound nature ofthe riaf means it is easier to form a radio outflow. the ir torus signaturealso tends to become weaker or disappear from l_int/l_edd &lt; 0.01 agns, althoughthere may be additional mid-ir synchrotron emission associated with the riaf.together these results suggest that specific accretion rate is an importantphysical "axis" of agn unification, described by a simple model.

1104.0928	new constraints on the evolution of the stellar-to-dark matter  connection: a combined analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing, clustering, and  stellar mass functions from z=0.2 to z=1	using data from the cosmos survey, we perform the first joint analysis ofgalaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy numberdensities. carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter betweenstellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using anovel and self-consistent theoretical framework. our results provide strongconstraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo massrelation (shmr) from z=0.2 to z=1. at low stellar mass, we find that halo massscales as mh m*^0.46 and that this scaling does not evolve significantly withredshift to z=1. we show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, mh/m*, varies from lowto high masses, reaching a minimum of mh/m*~27 at m*=4.5x10^10 msun andmh=1.2x10^12 msun. this minimum is important for models of galaxy formationbecause it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of thecentral galaxy has been the most efficient. we describe the shmr at thisminimum in terms of the "pivot stellar mass", m*piv, the "pivot halo mass",mhpiv, and the "pivot ratio", (mh/m*)piv. thanks to a homogeneous analysis of asingle data set, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends forboth mhpiv and m*piv. the pivot stellar mass decreases fromm*piv=5.75+-0.13x10^10 msun at z=0.88 to m*piv=3.55+-0.17x10^10 msun at z=0.37.intriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of mhpiv leaves the pivotratio constant with redshift at (mh/m*)piv~27. we use simple arguments to showhow this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching mayultimately depend on mh/m* and not simply mh, as is commonly assumed. we showthat simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in thesites of star formation. finally, we discuss the implications of our results inthe context of popular quenching models, including disk instabilities and agnfeedback.

1205.4764	a new infrared color criterion for the selection of 0&lt;z&lt;7 agn:  application to deep fields and implications for jwst surveys	[abridged] it is widely accepted that observations at mid-infrared (mid-ir)wavelengths enable the selection of galaxies with nuclear activity, which maynot be revealed even in the deepest x-ray surveys. in this work new near- andmid-ir color diagnostics are explored, aiming for improved efficiency - bettercompleteness and less contamination - in selecting agn out to very highredshifts. we restrict our study to the james webb space telescope wavelengthrange (0.6-27um). the criteria are created based on the predictions bystate-of-the-art galaxy and agn templates covering a wide variety of galaxyproperties, and tested against control samples with deep multi-wavelengthcoverage (ranging from the x-rays to radio frequencies). we show that thecolors ks-[4.5], [4.5]-[8.0], and [8.0]-[24] are ideal as agn/non-agndiagnostics at, respectively, z&lt;~1, 1&lt;~z&lt;~2.5, and z&gt;~2.5-3. however, when thesource redshift is unknown, these colors should be combined. we thus develop animproved ir criterion (using ks and irac bands, ki) as a new alternative atz&lt;~2.5. ki does not show improved completeness (50-60% overall) in comparisonto commonly used irac-based agn criteria, but is less affected by non-agncontamination (revealing a &gt;50-90% level of successful agn selection). we alsopropose kim (using ks, irac, and mips-24um bands, kim), which aims to selectagn hosts from local distances to as far back as the end of reionization(0&lt;z&lt;~7) with reduced non-agn contamination. however, the necessarytesting-constraints and the small control-sample sizes prevent the confirmationof its improved efficiency at z&lt;~2.5. overall, kim shows a ~30-40% completenessand a &gt;70-90% level of successful agn selection. ki and kim are built to bereliable against a ~10-20% error in flux, are based on existing filters, andare suitable for immediate use.

1207.2154	evolution of the quasar luminosity function over 3 &lt; z &lt; 5 in the cosmos  survey field	we investigate the high-redshift quasar luminosity function (qlf) down to anapparent magnitude of i(ab) = 25 in the cosmic evolution survey (cosmos).careful analysis of the extensive cosmos photometry and imaging data allows usto identify and remove stellar and low-redshift contaminants, enabling aselection that is nearly complete for type-1 quasars at the redshifts ofinterest. we find 155 likely quasars at z &gt; 3.1, 39 of which have priorspectroscopic confirmation. we present our sample in detail and use theseconfirmed and likely quasars to compute the rest-frame uv qlf in the redshiftbins 3.1 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 and 3.5 &lt; z &lt; 5. the space density of faint quasarsdecreases by roughly a factor of four from z \sim 3.2 to z \sim 4, withfaint-end slopes of {\beta} \sim -1.7 at both redshifts. the decline in spacedensity of faint optical quasars at z &gt; 3 is similar to what has been found formore luminous optical and x-ray quasars. we compare the rest-frame uvluminosity functions found here with the x-ray luminosity function at z &gt; 3,and find that they evolve similarly between z \sim 3.2 and z \sim 4; however,the different normalizations imply that roughly 75% of x-ray bright activegalactic nuclei (agn) at z \sim 3 - 4 are optically obscured. this fraction ishigher than found at lower redshift and may imply that the obscured, type-2fraction continues to increase with redshift at least to z \sim 4. finally, theimplications of the results derived here for the contribution of quasars tocosmic reionization are discussed.

1208.6031	ly{\alpha} emission from high redshift sources in cosmos	we investigate spectroscopically measured ly{\alpha} equivalent widths andescape fractions of 244 sources of which 95 are lyman break galaxies (lbgs) and106 lyman alpha emitters (laes) at z~4.2, z~4.8, and z~5.6 selected fromintermediate and narrow band observations. the sources were selected from thecosmic evolution survey (cosmos), and observed with the deimos spectrograph. wefind that the distribution of equivalent widths shows no evolution withredshift for both the lbg selected sources and the intermediate/narrowbandlaes. we also find that the ly{\alpha} escape fraction of intermediate andnarrow band laes is on average higher and has a larger variation than theescape fraction of lbg selected sources. the escape fraction does not show adependence with redshift. similar to what has been found for laes at lowredshifts, the sources with the highest extinctions show the lowest escapefractions. the range of escape fractions increases with decreasing extinction.this is evidence that the dust extinction is the most important factoraffecting the escape of ly{\alpha} photons, but at low extinctions otherfactors such as hi covering fraction and gas kinematics can be just aseffective at inhibiting the escape of ly{\alpha} photons.

(1994, e94) type 1 agnmean sed. we found that the mean seds in each bin are closely similar to eachother, showing no statistical significant evidence of dependence on any of theanalyzed parameters. we also measured the sed dispersion as a function of thesefour parameters, and found no significant dependencies. the dispersion of thexmm-cosmos seds is generally larger than e94 sed dispersion in the ultraviolet,which might be due to the broader ``window function'' for cosmos quasars, andtheir x-ray based selection.

1210.3044	a quasar-galaxy mixing diagram: quasar spectral energy distribution  shapes in the optical to near-infrared	we define a quasar-galaxy mixing diagram using the slopes of their spectralenergy distributions (seds) from 1\mu m to 3000\aa\ and from 1\mu m to 3\mu min the rest frame. the mixing diagram can easily distinguish amongquasar-dominated, galaxy-dominated and reddening-dominated sed shapes. bystudying the position of the 413 xmm selected type 1 agn in the wide-field"cosmic evolution survey" (cosmos) in the mixing diagram, we find that acombination of the elvis et al. (1994, hereafter e94) quasar sed with variouscontributions from galaxy emission and some dust reddening is remarkablyeffective in describing the sed shape from 0.3-3\mu m for large ranges ofredshift, luminosity, black hole mass and eddington ratio of type 1 agn. inparticular, the location in the mixing diagram of the highest luminosity agn isvery close (within 1\sigma) to that of the e94 sed. the mixing diagram can alsobe used to estimate the host galaxy fraction and reddening in quasar. we alsoshow examples of some outliers which might be agn in different evolutionarystages compared to the majority of agn in the quasar-host galaxy co-evolutioncycle.

1212.4605	mosaiced wide-field vlbi observations of the lockman hole/xmm	active galactic nuclei (agn) play a decisive role in galaxy evolution,particularly so when operating in a radiatively inefficient mode, where theylaunch powerful jets that reshape their surroundings. however, identifying themis difficult, since radio observations commonly have resolutions of between 1arcsec and 10 arcsec, which is equally sensitive to radio emission fromstar-forming activity and from agn. very long baseline interferometry (vlbi)observations allow one to filter out all but the most compact non-thermalemission from radio survey data. the observational and computational demands todo this in large surveys have been, until recently, too high to make suchundertakings feasible. only the recent advent of wide-field observingtechniques have facilitated such observations, and we here present the resultsfrom a survey of 217 radio sources in the lockman hole/xmm field. we describein detail some new aspects of the calibration, including primary beamcorrection, multi-source self-calibration, and mosaicing. as a result, wedetected 65 out of the 217 radio sources and were able to construct, for thefirst time, the source counts of vlbi-detected agn. they indicate that at least15%-25% of the sub-mjy radio sources are agn-driven, consistent with recentfindings using other agn selection techniques. we have used ancillary data toinvestigate the agn hosts. we find that among the sources nearby enough to beresolved in the optical images, 88% (23/26) could be classified as early-typeor bulge-dominated galaxies. while 50% of these sources are correctlyrepresented by the sed of an early-type galaxy, for the rest the best fit wasobtained with a heavily extinct starburst template, an effect we ascribe to adegeneracy in the fit. overall, the typical hosts of vlbi-detected sources arein good agreement with being early-type or bulge-dominated galaxies.

1302.6362	clustering of galaxies around grb sight-lines	there is evidence of an overdensity of strong intervening mgii absorptionline systems distributed along the lines of sight towards grb afterglowsrelative to quasar sight-lines. if this excess is real, one should also expectan overdensity of field galaxies around grb sight-lines, as strong mgii tendsto trace these sources. in this work, we test this expectation by calculatingthe two point angular correlation function of galaxies within120$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim470~h_{71}^{-1}~\mathrm{kpc}$ at $\langle z\rangle\sim0.4$) of grb afterglows. we compare the gamma-ray burst optical andnear-infrared detector (grond) grb afterglow sample -- one of the largest andmost homogeneous samples of grb fields -- with galaxies and agn found in thecosmos-30 photometric catalog. we find no significant signal of anomalousclustering of galaxies at an estimated median redshift of $z\sim0.3$ around grbsight-lines, down to $k_{\mathrm{ab}}&lt;19.3$. this result is contrary to theexpectations from the mgii excess derived from grb afterglow spectroscopy,although many confirmed galaxy counterparts to mgii absorbers may be too faintto detect in our sample -- especially those at $z&gt;1$. we note that the additionof higher sensitivity spitzer irac or hst wfc3 data for even a subset of oursample would increase this survey's depth by several orders of magnitude,simultaneously increasing statistics and enabling the investigation of a muchlarger redshift space.}

1306.2307	the hot and energetic universe: a white paper presenting the science  theme motivating the athena+ mission	this white paper, submitted to the recent esa call for science themes todefine its future large missions, advocates the need for a transformationalleap in our understanding of two key questions in astrophysics: 1) how doesordinary matter assemble into the large scale structures that we see today? 2)how do black holes grow and shape the universe? hot gas in clusters, groups andthe intergalactic medium dominates the baryonic content of the local universe.to understand the astrophysical processes responsible for the formation andassembly of these large structures, it is necessary to measure their physicalproperties and evolution. this requires spatially resolved x-ray spectroscopywith a factor 10 increase in both telescope throughput and spatial resolvingpower compared to currently planned facilities. feedback from supermassiveblack holes is an essential ingredient in this process and in most galaxyevolution models, but it is not well understood. x-ray observations canuniquely reveal the mechanisms launching winds close to black holes anddetermine the coupling of the energy and matter flows on larger scales. due tothe effects of feedback, a complete understanding of galaxy evolution requiresknowledge of the obscured growth of supermassive black holes through cosmictime, out to the redshifts where the first galaxies form. x-ray emission is themost reliable way to reveal accreting black holes, but deep survey speed mustimprove by a factor ~100 over current facilities to perform a full census intothe early universe. the advanced telescope for high energy astrophysics(athena+) mission provides the necessary performance (e.g. angular resolution,spectral resolution, survey grasp) to address these questions and revolutionizeour understanding of the hot and energetic universe. these capabilities willalso provide a powerful observatory to be used in all areas of astrophysics.

1306.2325	the hot and energetic universe: the formation and growth of the earliest  supermassive black holes	a crucial challenge in astrophysics over the coming decades will be tounderstand the origins of supermassive black holes (smbhs) that lie at thecentres of most, if not all, galaxies. the processes responsible for theinitial formation of these smbhs and their early growth via accretion - whenthey are seen as active galactic nuclei (agn) - remain unknown. to address thischallenge, we must identify low luminosity and obscured z&gt;6 agns, whichrepresent the bulk of early smbh growth. sensitive x-ray observations are aunique signpost of accretion activity, uncontaminated by star formationprocesses, which prevent reliable agn identification at other wavelengths (e.g.optical, infrared). the athena+ wide field imager will enable x-ray surveys tobe carried out two orders of magnitude faster than with chandra or xmm-newton,opening a new discovery space and identifying over 400 z&gt;6 agn, includingobscured sources. athena+ will also play a fundamental role to enhance thescientific return of future multiwavelength facilities that will probe thephysical conditions within the host galaxies of early smbhs, which is vital forunderstanding how smbhs form, what fuels their subsequent growth, and to assesstheir impact on the early universe. follow-up of samples of z&gt;6 galaxies withthe athena+ x-ray integral field unit could also reveal the presence of highlyobscured agns, thanks to the detection of strong iron lines. thus, athena+ willenable the first quantitative measurements of the extent and distribution ofsmbh accretion in the early universe.

1307.0833	the lack of star formation gradients in galaxy groups up to z~1.6	in the local universe, galaxy properties show a strong dependence onenvironment. in cluster cores, early type galaxies dominate, whereasstar-forming galaxies are more and more common in the outskirts. at higherredshifts and in somewhat less dense environments (e.g. galaxy groups), thesituation is less clear. one open issue is that of whether and how the starformation rate (sfr) of galaxies in groups depends on the distance from thecentre of mass. to shed light on this topic, we have built a sample of x-rayselected galaxy groups at 0&lt;z&lt;1.6 in various blank fields (ecdfs, cosmos,goods). we use a sample of spectroscopically confirmed group members withstellar mass m &gt;10^10.3 m_sun in order to have a high spectroscopiccompleteness. as we use only spectroscopic redshifts, our results are notaffected by uncertainties due to projection effects. we use several sfrindicators to link the star formation (sf) activity to the galaxy environment.taking advantage of the extremely deep mid-infrared spitzer mips andfar-infrared herschel pacs observations, we have an accurate, broad-bandmeasure of the sfr for the bulk of the star-forming galaxies. we usemulti-wavelength sed fitting techniques to estimate the stellar masses of allobjects and the sfr of the mips and pacs undetected galaxies. we analyse thedependence of the sf activity, stellar mass and specific sfr on thegroup-centric distance, up to z~1.6, for the first time. we do not find anycorrelation between the mean sfr and group-centric distance at any redshift. wedo not observe any strong mass segregation either, in agreement withpredictions from simulations. our results suggest that either groups have amuch smaller spread in accretion times with respect to the clusters and thatthe relaxation time is longer than the group crossing time.

1308.5353	a critical assessment of photometric redshift methods: a candels  investigation	we present results from the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels) photometric redshift methods investigation. in thisinvestigation, the results from eleven participants, each using a differentcombination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energydistributions (seds) and priors, are used to examine the properties ofphotometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broad-band multi-wavelengthcoverage. the photometry used includes u-band through mid-infrared filters andwas derived using the tfit method. comparing the results, we find that there isno particular code or set of template seds that results in significantly betterphotometric redshifts compared to others. however, we find codes producing thelowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimizephotometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting oradding extra smoothing errors. these results therefore stress the importance ofthe training procedure. we find a strong dependence of the photometric redshiftaccuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. on the other hand, wefind a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift andgalaxy color. we find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshifterrors (e.g., 68% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to thatexpected from the spectroscopic control sample. we find that all codes show astatistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. however, the biasis in all cases smaller than the scatter, the latter therefore dominates theerrors. finally, we find that combining results from multiple codessignificantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction.we discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometricredshifts and error estimates.

1309.0008	encoding the infrared excess (irx) in the nuvrk color diagram for  star-forming galaxies	we present an empirical method of assessing the star formation rate (sfr) ofstar-forming galaxies based on their locations in the rest-frame color-colordiagram (nuv-r) vs (r-k). by using the spitzer 24 micron sample in the cosmosfield (~16400 galaxies with 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.3) and a local galex-sdss-swire sample(~700 galaxies with z &lt; 0.2), we show that the mean infrared excess &lt;irx&gt;= &lt;l_ir / l_uv &gt; can be described by a single vector, nrk, that combines the twocolors. the calibration between &lt;irx&gt; and nrk allows us to recover the irluminosity, l_ir, with an accuracy of ~0.21 dex for the cosmos sample and ~0.27dex for the local one. the sfrs derived with this method agree with the onesbased on the observed (uv+ir) luminosities and on the spectral energydistribution fitting for the vast majority (~85 %) of the star-formingpopulation. thanks to a library of model galaxy seds with realisticprescriptions for the star formation history, we show that we need to include atwo-component dust model (i.e., birth clouds and diffuse ism) and a fulldistribution of galaxy inclinations in order to reproduce the behavior of the&lt;irx&gt; stripes in the nuvrk diagram. in conclusion, the nrk method, based onlyon rest-frame uv and optical colors available in most of the extragalacticfields, offers a simple alternative of assessing the sfr of star-forminggalaxies in the absence of far-ir or spectral diagnostic observations.

1312.3336	the dependency of agn infrared color-selection on source luminosity and  obscuration: an observational perspective in cdfs and cosmos	aims. this work addresses the agn ir-selection dependency on intrinsic sourceluminosity and obscuration, in order to identify and charaterise biases whichcould affect conclusions in studies. methods. we study ir-selected agn in thechandra deep field south (cdfs) survey and in the cosmological survey (cosmos).the agn sample is divided into low and high x-ray luminosity classes, and intounobscured (type-1) and obscured (type-2) classes by means of x-ray and opticalspectroscopy data. specifically in the x-rays regime, we adopt the intrinsicluminosity taking into account the estimated column density (n_h). we also takethe chance to highlight important differences resulting from adopting differentmethods to assess agn obscuration. results. in agreement with previous studies,we also find that agn ir-selection efficiency shows a decrease with decreasingsource agn x-ray luminosity. for the intermediate-luminosity agn population(43.3&lt;~log(l_x[erg/s])&lt;~44$), the efficiency also worsens with increasingobscuration. the same sample also shows an evolution with cosmic time of theobscured fraction at the highest x-ray luminosities, independently of adoptedtype-1/type-2 classification method. conclusions. we confirm that agnir-selection is genuinely biased toward unobscured agn, but only atintermediate luminosities. at the highest luminosities, where agn ir-selectionis more efficient, there is no obscuration bias. we show that type-1 agn areintrinsically more luminous than type-2 agn only at z&lt;~1.6, thus resulting inmore type-1 agn being selected the shallower the ir survey is. [abridged:conclusion on survey strategy. see manuscript.] finally, when the james webbspace telescope comes online, the broad-band filters 2.0um, 4.4um, 7.7um, and18um will be key to disentangle agn from non-agn dominated seds at depths wherespectroscopy becomes impractical.

1409.2871	the role of bars in agn fueling in disk galaxies over the last seven  billion years	we present empirical constraints on the influence of stellar bars on thefueling of active galactic nuclei (agns) out to z=0.84 using a sample ofx-ray-selected agns hosted in luminous non-interacting face-on and moderatelyinclined disk galaxies from the chandra cosmos survey. using high-resolutionhubble space telescope imaging to identify bars, we find that the fraction ofbarred active galaxies displays a similar behavior as that of inactive spirals,declining with redshift from 71% at z~0.3, to 35% at z~0.8. with activegalaxies being typically massive, we compare them against a mass-matched sampleof inactive spirals and show that, while at face value the agn bar fraction isslightly higher at all redshifts, we cannot rule out that the bar fractions ofactive and inactive galaxies are the same. the presence of a bar has noinfluence on the agn strength, with barred and unbarred active galaxies showingequivalent x-ray luminosity distributions. from our results, we conclude thatthe occurrence and the efficiency of the fueling process is independent of thelarge scale structure of a galaxy. the role of bars, if any, may be restrictedto providing the suitable conditions for bh fueling to occur, i.e., bring afresh supply of gas to the central 100 pc. at the high-redshift end, we findthat roughly 60% of active disk galaxies are unbarred. we speculate this to berelated with the known dynamical state of disks at higher redshifts---moregas-rich and prone to instabilities than local spirals---which could also leadto gas inflows without the need of bars.

1501.02805	obscuration-dependent evolution of active galactic nuclei	we aim to constrain the evolution of agn as a function of obscuration usingan x-ray selected sample of $\sim2000$ agn from a multi-tiered survey includingthe cdfs, aegis-xd, cosmos and xmm-xxl fields. the spectra of individual x-raysources are analysed using a bayesian methodology with a physically realisticmodel to infer the posterior distribution of the hydrogen column density andintrinsic x-ray luminosity. we develop a novel non-parametric method whichallows us to robustly infer the distribution of the agn population in x-rayluminosity, redshift and obscuring column density, relying only on minimalsmoothness assumptions. our analysis properly incorporates uncertainties fromlow count spectra, photometric redshift measurements, associationincompleteness and the limited sample size. we find that obscured agn with$n_{h}&gt;{\rm 10^{22}\, cm^{-2}}$ account for ${77}^{+4}_{-5}\%$ of the numberdensity and luminosity density of the accretion smbh population with $l_{{\rmx}}&gt;10^{43}\text{ erg/s}$, averaged over cosmic time. compton-thick agn accountfor approximately half the number and luminosity density of the obscuredpopulation, and ${38}^{+8}_{-7}\%$ of the total. we also find evidence that theevolution is obscuration-dependent, with the strongest evolution around$n_{h}\thickapprox10^{23}\text{ cm}^{-2}$. we highlight this by measuring theobscured fraction in compton-thin agn, which increases towards $z\sim3$, whereit is $25\%$ higher than the local value. in contrast the fraction ofcompton-thick agn is consistent with being constant at $\approx35\%$,independent of redshift and accretion luminosity. we discuss our findings inthe context of existing models and conclude that the observed evolution is tofirst order a side-effect of anti-hierarchical growth.

1502.02659	a wfc3 grism emission line redshift catalog in the goods-south field	we combine hst/wfc3 imaging and g141 grism observations from the candels and3d-hst surveys to produce a catalog of grism spectroscopic redshifts forgalaxies in the candels/goods-south field. the wfc3/g141 grism spectra cover awavelength range of 1.1&lt;lambda&lt;1.7 microns with a resolving power of r~130 forpoint sources, thus providing rest-frame optical spectra for galaxies out toz~3.5. the catalog is selected in the h-band (f160w) and includes both galaxieswith and without previously published spectroscopic redshifts. grism spectraare extracted for all h-band detected galaxies with h&lt;24 and a candelsphotometric redshift z_phot &gt; 0.6. the resulting spectra are visually inspectedto identify emission lines and redshifts are determined using cross-correlationwith empirical spectral templates. to establish the accuracy of our redshifts,we compare our results against high-quality spectroscopic redshifts from theliterature. using a sample of 411 control galaxies, this analysis yields aprecision of sigma_nmad=0.0028 for the grism-derived redshifts, which isconsistent with the accuracy reported by the 3d-hst team. our final catalogcovers an area of 153 square arcmin and contains 1019 redshifts for galaxies ingoods-s. roughly 60% (608/1019) of these redshifts are for galaxies with nopreviously published spectroscopic redshift. these new redshifts span a rangeof 0.677 &lt; z &lt; 3.456 and have a median redshift of z=1.282. the catalogcontains a total of 234 new redshifts for galaxies at z&gt;1.5. in addition, wepresent 20 galaxy pair candidates identified for the first time using the grismredshifts in our catalog, including four new galaxy pairs at z~2, nearlydoubling the number of such pairs previously identified.

1502.05854	(sub)millimetre interferometric imaging of a sample of cosmos/aztec  submillimetre galaxies - i. multiwavelength identifications and redshift  distribution	we used the pdbi to map a sample of 15 smgs in the cosmos field at thewavelength of 1.3 mm. the target smgs were originally discovered in thejcmt/aztec 1.1 mm continuum survey at s/n=4-4.5. this paper presents, for thefirst time, interferometric millimetre-wavelength observations of thesesources. the angular resolution of our observations, 1.8", allowed us toaccurately determine the positions of the target smgs. using a detectionthreshold of s/n&gt;4.5 regardless of multiwavelength counterpart association, and4&lt;s/n&lt;=4.5 if a multiwavelength counterpart within 1.5" is also present, thetotal number of detections in our survey is 22. three of our detected smgs(aztec21, 27, and 28; which corresponds to 20%) are marginally resolved at ourangular resolution, and these sources are found to have elongated or clumpymorphologies and/or multiple components. using optical to nir photometricredshifts, available spectroscopic redshifts, and redshifts estimated from theradio-to-submm spectral index we infer a median redshift of$\tilde{z}=3.20\pm0.25$ for our sample. to study the overall multiplicity andredshift distribution of flux-limited samples of smgs we combined these sourceswith the 15 brightest aztec smgs detected at 1.1 mm, aztec1-15, and studiedpreviously. this constitutes a complete, flux- and s/n-limited 1.1-mm selectedsample. we find that the median redshift for the 15 brightest aztec smgs($\tilde{z}=3.05\pm0.44$) is consistent with that for aztec16-30. this conformsto recent observational findings that smgs do not exhibit any significant trendbetween the redshift and (sub)mm flux density. for the combined aztec1-30sample we derive a median redshift of $\tilde{z}=3.17\pm0.27$, consistent withprevious results based on mm-selected samples. we further infer that within thecombined aztec1-30 sample $\sim25\pm9\%$ of sources separate into multiplecomponents.

1505.01501	a critical assessment of stellar mass measurement methods	in this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the main sources of randomand systematic errors in stellar mass measurement for galaxies using theirspectral energy distributions (seds). we use mock galaxy catalogs withsimulated multi-waveband photometry (from u-band to mid-infrared) and knownredshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. givendifferent parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric s/nratios, sed fitting errors, systematic effects, the inherent degeneracies andcorrelated errors), we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs toquantify these effects individually. we studied the sensitivity of stellar massestimates to the codes/methods used, population synthesis models, starformation histories, nebular emission line contributions, photometricuncertainties, extinction and age. for each simulated galaxy, the differencebetween the input stellar masses and those estimated using different simulationcatalogs, $\delta\log(m)$, was calculated and used to identify the mostfundamental parameters affecting stellar masses. we measured differentcomponents of the error budget, with the results listed as follows: (1). nosignificant bias was found among different codes/methods, with all havingcomparable scatter; (2). a source of error is found to be due to photometricuncertainties and low resolution in age and extinction grids; (3). the medianof stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the massassociated with any given galaxy; (4). the deviations in stellar mass stronglycorrelate with those in age, with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5).the scatter in the stellar masses due to free parameters are quantified, withthe sensitivity of the stellar mass to both the population synthesis codes andinclusion of nebular emission lines studied.

1509.03318	mapping the galaxy color-redshift relation: optimal photometric redshift  calibration strategies for cosmology surveys	calibrating the photometric redshifts of &gt;10^9 galaxies for upcoming weaklensing cosmology experiments is a major challenge for the astrophysicscommunity. the path to obtaining the required spectroscopic redshifts fortraining and calibration is daunting, given the anticipated depths of thesurveys and the difficulty in obtaining secure redshifts for some faint galaxypopulations. here we present an analysis of the problem based on theself-organizing map, a method of mapping the distribution of data in ahigh-dimensional space and projecting it onto a lower-dimensionalrepresentation. we apply this method to existing photometric data from thecosmos survey selected to approximate the anticipated euclid weak lensingsample, enabling us to robustly map the empirical distribution of galaxies inthe multidimensional color space defined by the expected euclid filters.mapping this multicolor distribution lets us determine where - in galaxy colorspace - redshifts from current spectroscopic surveys exist and where they aresystematically missing. crucially, the method lets us determine whether aspectroscopic training sample is representative of the full photometric spaceoccupied by the galaxies in a survey. we explore optimal sampling techniquesand estimate the additional spectroscopy needed to map out the color-redshiftrelation, finding that sampling the galaxy distribution in color space in asystematic way can efficiently meet the calibration requirements. while theanalysis presented here focuses on the euclid survey, similar analysis can beapplied to other surveys facing the same calibration challenge, such as des,lsst, and wfirst.

1509.03629	are compton-thick agn the missing link between mergers and black hole  growth?	we examine the host morphologies of heavily obscured active galactic nuclei(agn) at $z\sim1$ to test whether obscured supermassive black hole growth atthis epoch is preferentially linked to galaxy mergers. our sample consists of154 obscured agn with $n_{\rm h}&gt;10^{23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $z&lt;1.5$. using visualclassifications, we compare the morphologies of these agn to control samples ofmoderately obscured ($10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ $&lt;n_{\rm h}&lt; 10^{23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$) andunobscured ($n_{\rm h}&lt;10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) agn. these control agn are matchedin redshift and intrinsic x-ray luminosity to our heavily obscured agn. we findthat heavily obscured agn at z~1 are twice as likely to be hosted by late-typegalaxies relative to unobscured agn ($65.3^{+4.1}_{-4.6}\%$ vs$34.5^{+2.9}_{-2.7}\%$) and three times as likely to exhibit merger orinteraction signatures ($21.5^{+4.2}_{-3.3}\%$ vs $7.8^{+1.9}_{-1.3}\%$). theincreased merger fraction is significant at the 3.8$\sigma$ level. we also findthat the incidence of point-like morphologies is inversely proportional toobscuration. if we exclude all point sources and consider only extended hosts,we find the correlation between merger fraction and obscuration is stillevident, however at a reduced statistical significance ($2.5\sigma$). the factthat we observe a different disk/spheroid fraction versus obscuration indicatesthat viewing angle cannot be the only thing differentiating our three agnsamples, as a simple unification model would suggest. the increased fraction ofdisturbed morphologies with obscuration supports an evolutionary scenario, inwhich compton-thick agn are a distinct phase of obscured smbh growth followinga merger/interaction event. our findings also suggest that some of themerger-triggered smbh growth predicted by recent agn fueling models may behidden among the heavily obscured, compton-thick population.

1509.07147	(sub)millimetre interferometric imaging of a sample of cosmos/aztec  submillimetre galaxies - ii. the spatial extent of the radio-emitting regions	radio emission at cm wavelengths from highly star-forming galaxies, such assmgs, is dominated by synchrotron radiation arising from supernova activity.using deep, high-resolution ($1\sigma=2.3$ $\mu$jy beam$^{-1}$; $0.75^{"}$) cmradio-continuum observations taken by the vla-cosmos 3 ghz large project, westudied the radio-emitting sizes of a flux-limited sample of smgs in the cosmosfield. of the 39 smgs studied here, 3 ghz emission was detected towards 18 ofthem ($\sim46\pm11\%$) with s/n ratios in the range of ${\rm s/n=4.2-37.4}$.using 2d elliptical gaussian fits, we derived a median deconvolved major axisfwhm size of $0.54^{"}\pm 0.11^{"}$ for our 18 smgs detected at 3 ghz. for the15 smgs with known redshift we derived a median linear major axis fwhm of$4.2\pm0.9$ kpc. no clear correlation was found between the radio-emitting sizeand the 3 ghz or submm flux density, or the redshift of the smg. however, thereis a hint of larger radio sizes at $z\sim2.5-5$ compared to lower redshifts.the sizes we derived are consistent with previous smg sizes measured at 1.4 ghzand in mid-$j$ co emission, but significantly larger than those seen in the(sub)mm continuum emission. one possible scenario is that smgs have i) anextended gas component with a low dust temperature, and which can be traced bylow- to mid-$j$ co line emission and radio continuum emission, and ii) awarmer, compact starburst region giving rise to the high-$j$ line emission ofco, which could dominate the dust continuum size measurements. because of therapid cooling of cr electrons in dense starburst galaxies ($\sim10^4-10^5$ yr),the more extended synchrotron radio-emitting size being a result of crdiffusion seems unlikely. instead, if smgs are driven by galaxy mergers theradio synchrotron emission might arise from more extended magnetised ism aroundthe starburst region.

1511.03032	the pep survey: evidence for intense star-forming activity in the  majority of radio-selected agn at z&gt;~1	in order to investigate the fir properties of radio-active agn, we haveconsidered three different fields where both radio and fir observations are thedeepest to-date: goods-south, goods-north and the lockman hole. out of a totalof 92 radio-selected agn, ~64% are found to have a counterpart in herschelmaps. the percentage is maximum in the goods-north (72%) and minimum (~50%) inthe lockman hole, where fir observations are shallower. our study shows that inall cases fir emission is associated to star-forming activity within the hostgalaxy. such an activity can even be extremely intense, with star-forming ratesas high as ~10^3-10^4 msun/yr. agn activity does not inhibit star formation inthe host galaxy, just as on-site star-formation does not seem to affect agnproperties, at least those detected at radio wavelengths and for z&gt;~1.furthermore, physical properties such as the mass and age distributions of thegalaxies hosting a radio-active agn do not seem to be affected by the presenceof an ongoing star-forming event. given the very high rate of fir detections,we stress that this refers to the majority of the sample: most radio-active agnare associated with intense episodes of star-formation. however, the twoprocesses proceed independently within the same galaxy, at all redshifts but inthe local universe, where powerful enough radio activity reaches the necessarystrength to switch off the on-site star formation. our data also show that forz&gt;~1 the hosts of radio-selected star-forming galaxies and agn areindistinguishable from each other both in terms of mass and ir luminositydistributions. the two populations only differentiate in the very localuniverse, whereby the few agn which are still fir-active are found in galaxieswith much higher masses and luminosities.

1511.07870	a spectroscopic survey of x-ray selected agn in the northern xmm-xxl  field	this paper presents a survey of x-ray selected active galactic nuclei (agn)with optical spectroscopic follow-up in a $\sim 18\, \rm{deg^2}$ area of theequatorial xmm-xxl north field. a sample of 8445 point-like x-ray sourcesdetected by xmm-newton above a limiting flux of $f_{\rm 0.5-10\, kev} &gt;10^{-15} \rm\,erg\, cm^{-2}\, s^{-1}$ was matched to optical (sdss) andinfrared (wise) counterparts. we followed up 3042 sources brighter than$r=22.5$ mag with the sdss boss spectrograph. the spectra yielded a reliableredshift measurement for 2578 agn in the redshift range $z=0.02-5.0$, with$0.5-2\rm\, kev$ luminosities ranging from $10^{39}-10^{46}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$.this is currently the largest published spectroscopic sample of x-ray selectedagn in a contiguous area. the boss spectra of agn candidates show a bimodaldistribution of optical line widths allowing a separation between broad- andnarrow-emission line agn. the former dominate our sample (70 per cent) due tothe relatively bright x-ray flux limit and the optical boss magnitude limit. weclassify the narrow emission line objects (22 per cent of full sample) usingstandard bpt diagnostics: the majority have line ratios indicating the dominantsource of ionization is the agn. a small number (8 per cent of full sample)exhibit the typical narrow line ratios of star-forming galaxies, or only haveabsorption lines in their spectra. we term the latter two classes "elusive''agn. we also compare x-ray, optical and infrared color agn selections in thisfield. x-ray observations reveal, the largest number of agn. the overlapbetween the selections, which is a strong function of the imaging depth in agiven band, is also remarkably small. we show using spectral stacking that alarge fraction of the x-ray agn would not be selectable via optical or ircolours due to host galaxy contamination.

0808.2746	relation between stellar mass and star formation activity in galaxies	for a mass-selected sample of 66544 galaxies with photometric redshifts fromthe cosmic evolution survey (cosmos), we examine the evolution of starformation activity as a function of stellar mass in galaxies. we estimate thecosmic star formation rates (sfr) over the range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.2, using therest-frame 2800 a flux (corrected for extinction). we find the mean sfr to be astrong function of the galactic stellar mass at any given redshift, withmassive systems (log (m/m(sun)) &gt; 10.5) contributing less (by a factor of ~ 5)to the total star formation rate density (sfrd).  combining data from the cosmos and gemini deep deep survey (gdds), we extendthe sfrd-z relation as a function of stellar mass to z~2. for massive galaxies,we find a steep increase in the sfrd-z relation to z~2; for the less massivesystems, the sfrd which also increases from z=0 to 1, levels off at z~1. thisimplies that the massive systems have had their major star formation activityat earlier epochs (z &gt; 2) than the lower mass galaxies.  we study changes in the sfrds as a function of both redshift and stellar massfor galaxies of different spectral types. we find that the slope of the sfrd-zrelation for different spectral type of galaxies is a strong function of theirstellar mass. for low and intermediate mass systems, the main contribution tothe cosmic sfrd comes from the star-forming galaxies while, for more massivesystems, the evolved galaxies are the most dominant population.

astro-ph;0509197	specific star formation rates to redshift 5 from the fors deep field and  the goods-s field	we explore the build-up of stellar mass in galaxies over a wide redshiftrange 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 5.0 by studying the evolution of the specific star formationrate (ssfr), defined as the star formation rate per unit stellar mass, as afunction of stellar mass and age. our work is based on a combined sample of ~9000 galaxies from the fors deep field and the goods-s field, providing highstatistical accuracy and relative insensitivity against cosmic variance. as atlower redshifts, we find that lower-mass galaxies show higher ssfrs than highermass galaxies, although highly obscured galaxies remain undetected in oursample. furthermore, the highest mass galaxies contain the oldest stellarpopulations at all redshifts, in principle agreement with the existence ofevolved, massive galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3. it is remarkable, however, that thistrend continues to very high redshifts of z ~ 4. we also show that withincreasing redshift the ssfr for massive galaxies increases by a factor of ~10, reaching the era of their formation at z ~ 2 and beyond. these findings canbe interpreted as evidence for an early epoch of star formation in the mostmassive galaxies, and ongoing star-formation activity in lower mass galaxies.

astro-ph;0611555	the host galaxy of grb 011121: morphology and spectral energy  distribution	(abridged) we present a detailed study of the host galaxy of grb 011121 (at z= 0.36) based on high-resolution imaging in 5 broad-band, optical andnear-infrared filters with hst and vlt/isaac. the surface brightness profile ofthis galaxy is best fitted by a sersic law with index ~ 2 - 2.5 and a ratherlarge effective radius (~ 7.5 kpc). both the morphological analysis and thef450w - f702w colour image suggest that the host galaxy of grb 011121 is eithera disk-system with a rather small bulge, or one hosting a central,dust-enshrouded starburst. hence, we modeled the integrated spectral energydistribution of this galaxy by combining stellar population and radiativetransfer models, assuming properties representative of nearby starburst ornormal star-forming, sbc-like galaxies. a range of plausible fitting solutionsindicates that the host galaxy of grb 011121 has a stellar mass of 3.1 - 6.9x10^9 msun, stellar populations with a maximum age ranging from 0.4 to 2 gyr,and a metallicity ranging from 1 to 29 per cent of the solar value. starburstmodels suggest this galaxy to be nearly as opaque as local starbursts (with ana_v = 0.27 - 0.76 mag). alternatively, normal star-forming sbc-like modelssuggest a high central opacity whereas a_v = 0.12$ -- 0.57 mag along the lineof sight. for this subluminous galaxy (with l_b/lstar_b = 0.26), we determine amodel-dependent sfr of 2.4 - 9.4 msun/yr. the sfr per unit luminosity (9.2 -36.1 msun/yr/(l_b/lstar_b)) is high compared to those of most grb hostgalaxies, but consistent with those of most of the hosts at similar lowredshift. our results suggest that the host galaxy of grb 011121 is a ratherlarge disk-system in a relatively early phase of its star formation history.

0809.2337	properties of the molecular gas in a starbursting qso at z=1.83 in the  cosmos field	using the iram 30m telescope, we have detected the co j=2-1, 4-3, 5-4, and6-5 emission lines in the millimeter-bright, blank-field selected agn cosmosj100038+020822 at redshift z=1.8275. the sub-local thermodynamic equilibrium(lte) excitation of the j=4 level implies that the gas is less excited thanthat in typical nearby starburst galaxies such as ngc253, and in thehigh-redshift quasars studied to date, such as j1148+5251 or br1202-0725. largevelocity gradient (lvg) modeling of the co line spectral energy distribution(co sed; flux density vs. rotational quantum number) yields h2 densities in therange 10^{3.5}--10^{4.0} cm-3, and kinetic temperatures between 50 k and 200 k.the h2 mass of (3.6 - 5.4) x 10^{10} m_sun implied by the line intensitiescompares well with our estimate of the dynamical mass within the inner 1.5 kpcof the object. fitting a two-component gray body spectrum, we find a dust massof 1.2 x 10^{9} m_sun, and cold and hot dust temperatures of 42+/-5 k and160+/-25 k, respectively. the broad mgii line allows us to estimate the mass ofthe central black hole as 1.7 x 10^{9} m_sun. although the optical spectrum andmulti-wavelength sed matches those of an average qso, the molecular gas contentand dust properties resemble those of known submillimeter galaxies (smgs). theoptical morphology of this source shows tidal tails that suggest a recentinteraction or merger. since it shares properties of both starburst and agn,this object appears to be in a transition from a strongly starformingsubmillimeter galaxy to a qso.

0811.3977	the cosmos agn spectroscopic survey i: xmm counterparts	we present optical spectroscopy for an x-ray and optical flux-limited sampleof 677 xmm-newton selected targets covering the 2 deg^2 cosmos field, with ayield of 485 high-confidence redshifts. the majority of the spectra wereobtained over three seasons (2005-2007) with the imacs instrument on themagellan (baade) telescope. we also include in the sample previously publishedsloan digital sky survey spectra and supplemental observations withmmt/hectospec. we detail the observations and classification analyses. thesurvey is 90% complete to flux limits of f_{0.5-10 kev}&gt;8 x 10^-16 erg cm^-2s^-1 and i_ab+&lt;22, where over 90% of targets have high-confidence redshifts.making simple corrections for incompleteness due to redshift and spectral typeallows for a description of the complete population to $i_ab+&lt;23. the correctedsample includes 57% broad emission line (type 1, unobscured) agn at0.13&lt;z&lt;4.26, 25% narrow emission line (type 2, obscured) agn at 0.07&lt;z&lt;1.29,and 18% absorption line (host-dominated, obscured) agn at 0&lt;z&lt;1.22 (excludingthe stars that made up 4% of the x-ray targets). we show that the survey'slimits in x-ray and optical flux include nearly all x-ray agn (defined byl_{0.5-10 kev}&gt;3 x 10^42 erg s^-1) to z&lt;1, of both optically obscured andunobscured types. we find statistically significant evidence that the obscuredto unobscured agn ratio at z&lt;1 increases with redshift and decreases withluminosity.
