0901.4338	the large-scale environments of type ia supernovae: evidence for a  metallicity bias in the rate or luminosity of prompt ia events	using data drawn from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the sdss-iisupernova survey, we study the local environments of confirmed type iasupernovae (sne ia) in the nearby universe. at 0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.15, we find that snia events in blue, star-forming galaxies occur preferentially in regions oflower galaxy density relative to galaxies of like stellar mass andstar-formation rate, while sne ia in nearby red galaxies show no significantenvironment dependence within the measurement uncertainties. even though oursamples of sne in red hosts are relatively small in number, tests on simulatedgalaxy samples suggest that the observed distribution of environments for redsn ia hosts is in poor agreement with a cluster type ia rate strongly elevatedrelative to the field rate. finally, after considering the impact of galaxymorphology, stellar age, stellar metallicity, and other relevant galaxyproperties, we conclude that the observed correlation between the sn ia rateand environment in the star-forming galaxy population is likely driven by agas-phase metallicity effect, such that prompt type ia supernovae occur moreoften or are more luminous in metal-poor systems.

0902.0363	aegis: the clustering of x-ray agn relative to galaxies at z~1	we measure the clustering of non-quasar x-ray agn at z=0.7-1.4 in the aegisfield. using the cross-correlation of 113 chandra-selected agn, with a medianlog l_x=42.8 erg s^-1, with ~5,000 deep2 galaxies, we find that the x-ray agnare fit by a power law with a clustering scale length of r_0=5.95 +/-0.90 h^-1mpc and slope gamma=1.66 +/-0.22. x-ray agn have a similar clustering amplitudeas red, quiescent and `green' transition galaxies at z~1 and are significantlymore clustered than blue, star-forming galaxies. the x-ray agn clusteringstrength is primarily determined by the host galaxy color; agn in red hostgalaxies are significantly more clustered than agn in blue host galaxies, witha relative bias that is similar to that of red to blue deep2 galaxies. wedetect no dependence of clustering on optical brightness, x-ray luminosity, orhardness ratio within the ranges probed here. we find evidence for galaxieshosting x-ray agn to be more clustered than a sample of galaxies with matchingjoint optical color and magnitude distributions. this implies that galaxieshosting x-ray agn are more likely to reside in groups and more massive darkmatter halos than galaxies of the same color and luminosity without an x-rayagn. in comparison to optically-selected quasars in the deep2 fields, we findthat x-ray agn at z~1 are more clustered than optically-selected quasars (witha 2.6-sigma significance) and therefore likely reside in more massive darkmatter halos. our results are consistent with galaxies undergoing a quasarphase while in the blue cloud before settling on the red sequence with alower-luminosity x-ray agn, if they are similar objects at differentevolutionary stages.

0706.4089	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the role of galaxy environment in the  cosmic star-formation history	using galaxy samples drawn from the sloan digital sky survey and the deep2galaxy redshift survey, we study the relationship between star formation andenvironment at z ~ 0.1 and z ~ 1. we estimate the total star-formation rate(sfr) and specific star-formation rate (ssfr) for each galaxy according to themeasured [o ii] nebular line luminosity, corrected using empirical calibrationsto match more robust sfr indicators. echoing previous results, we find that inthe local universe star formation depends on environment such that galaxies inregions of higher overdensity, on average, have lower star-formation rates andlonger star-formation timescales than their counterparts in lower-densityregions. at z ~ 1, we show that the relationship between specific sfr andenvironment mirrors that found locally. however, we discover that therelationship between total sfr and overdensity at z ~ 1 is inverted relative tothe local relation. this observed evolution in the sfr-density relation isdriven, in part, by a population of bright, blue galaxies in dense environmentsat z ~ 1. this population, which lacks a counterpart at z ~ 0, is thought toevolve into members of the red sequence from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. finally, weconclude that environment does not play a dominant role in the cosmicstar-formation history at z &lt; 1: the dependence of the mean galaxy sfr on localgalaxy density at constant redshift is small compared to the decline in theglobal sfr space density over the last 7 gyr.

0910.0245	galaxy assembly bias on the red sequence	using samples drawn from the sloan digital sky survey, we study therelationship between local galaxy density and the properties of galaxies on thered sequence. after removing the mean dependence of average overdensity (or"environment") on color and luminosity, we find that there remains a strongresidual trend between luminosity-weighted mean stellar age and environment,such that galaxies with older stellar populations favor regions of higheroverdensity relative to galaxies of like color and luminosity (and hence oflike stellar mass). even when excluding galaxies with recent star-formationactivity (i.e., younger mean stellar ages) from the sample, we still find ahighly significant correlation between stellar age and environment at fixedstellar mass. this residual age-density relation provides direct evidence foran assembly bias on the red sequence such that galaxies in higher-densityregions formed earlier than galaxies of similar mass in lower-densityenvironments. we discuss these results in the context of the age-metallicitydegeneracy and in comparison to previous studies at low and intermediateredshift. finally, we consider the potential role of assembly bias inexplaining recent results regarding the evolution of post-starburst (orpost-quenching) galaxies and the environmental dependence of the type iasupernova rate.

1001.1737	a cosmic variance cookbook	deep pencil beam surveys (&lt;1 deg^2) are of fundamental importance forstudying the high-redshift universe. however, inferences about galaxypopulation properties are in practice limited by 'cosmic variance'. this is theuncertainty in observational estimates of the number density of galaxiesarising from the underlying large-scale density fluctuations. this source ofuncertainty can be significant, especially for surveys which cover only smallareas and for massive high-redshift galaxies. cosmic variance for a givengalaxy population can be determined using predictions from cold dark mattertheory and the galaxy bias. in this paper we provide tools for experimentdesign and interpretation. for a given survey geometry we present the cosmicvariance of dark matter as a function of mean redshift z and redshift bin sizedz. using a halo occupation model to predict galaxy clustering, we derive thegalaxy bias as a function of mean redshift for galaxy samples of a givenstellar mass range. in the linear regime, the cosmic variance of these galaxysamples is the product of the galaxy bias and the dark matter cosmic variance.we present a simple recipe using a fitting function to compute cosmic varianceas a function of the angular dimensions of the field, z, dz and stellar massm*. we also provide tabulated values and a software tool. we find that forgoods at z=2 and with dz=0.5 the relative cosmic variance of galaxies withm*&gt;10^11 msun is ~38%, while it is ~27% for gems and ~12% for cosmos. forgalaxies of m*~10^10 msun the relative cosmic variance is ~19% for goods, ~13%for gems and ~6% for cosmos. this implies that cosmic variance is a significantsource of uncertainty at z=2 for small fields and massive galaxies, while forlarger fields and intermediate mass galaxies cosmic variance is less serious.

1001.4560	where do wet, dry, and mixed galaxy mergers occur? a study of the  environments of close galaxy pairs in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey	we study the environment of wet, dry, and mixed galaxy mergers at 0.75 &lt; z &lt;1.2 using close pairs in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey. we find that thetypical environment of mixed and dry merger candidates is denser than that ofwet mergers, mostly due to the color-density relation. while the galaxycompanion rate (nc) is observed to increase with overdensity, using n-bodysimulations we find that the fraction of pairs that will eventually mergedecreases with the local density, predominantly because interlopers are morecommon in dense environments. after taking into account the merger probabilityof pairs as a function of local density, we find only marginal environmentdependence of the fractional merger rate for wet mergers over the redshiftrange we have probed. on the other hand, the fractional dry merger rateincreases rapidly with local density due to the increased population of redgalaxies in dense environments. we also find that the environment distributionof k+a galaxies is similar to that of wet mergers alone and of wet+mixedmergers, suggesting a possible connection between k+a galaxies and wet and/orwet+mixed mergers. we conclude that, as early as z ~ 1, high-density regionsare the preferred environment in which dry mergers occur, and that present-dayred-sequence galaxies in overdense environments have, on average, undergone1.2+-0.3 dry mergers since this time, accounting for (38+-10)% of their massaccretion in the last 8 billion years. our findings suggest that dry mergersare crucial in the mass-assembly of massive red galaxies in dense environments,such as brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) in galaxy groups and clusters.

1003.0687	reconstructing redshift distributions with cross-correlations: tests and  an optimized recipe	many of the cosmological tests to be performed by planned dark energyexperiments will require extremely well-characterized photometric redshiftmeasurements. current estimates are that the true mean redshift of the objectsin each photo-z bin must be known to better than 0.002(1+z) if errors incosmological measurements are not to be degraded. a conventional approach is tocalibrate these photometric redshifts with large sets of spectroscopicredshifts. however, at the depths probed by stage iii surveys (such as des),let alone stage iv (lsst, jdem, euclid), existing large redshift samples haveall been highly (25-60%) incomplete. a powerful alternative approach is toexploit the clustering of galaxies to perform photometric redshiftcalibrations. measuring the two-point angular cross-correlation between objectsin some photometric redshift bin and objects with known spectroscopic redshiftallows the true redshift distribution of a photometric sample to bereconstructed in detail, even if it includes objects too faint for spectroscopyor if spectroscopic samples are highly incomplete. we test this technique usingmock deep2 galaxy redshift survey light cones constructed from the millenniumsimulation semi-analytic galaxy catalogs. from this realistic test, we findthat the true redshift distribution of a photometric sample can, in fact, bedetermined accurately with cross-correlation techniques. we also compare theempirical error in the reconstruction of redshift distributions to previousanalytic predictions, finding that additional components must be included inerror budgets to match the simulation results. we conclude by presenting astep-by-step, optimized recipe for reconstructing redshift distributions usingstandard correlation measurements.

0708.0004	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: color and luminosity dependence of  galaxy clustering at z~1	we present measurements of the color and luminosity dependence of galaxyclustering at z~1 in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey. using volume-limitedsubsamples in bins of both color and luminosity, we find that: 1) theclustering dependence is much stronger with color than with luminosity and isas strong with color at z~1 as is found locally. we find no dependence of theclustering amplitude on color for galaxies on the red sequence, but asignificant dependence on color for galaxies within the blue cloud. 2) forgalaxies in the range l/l*~0.7-2, a stronger large-scale luminosity dependenceis seen for all galaxies than for red and blue galaxies separately. thesmall-scale clustering amplitude depends significantly on luminosity for bluegalaxies, with brighter samples having a stronger rise on scales r_p&lt;0.5 mpc/h.3) redder galaxies exhibit stronger small-scale redshift-space distortions("fingers of god"), and both red and blue populations show large-scaledistortions in xi(r_p,pi) due to coherent infall. 4) while the clusteringlength, r_0, increases smoothly with galaxy color (in narrow bins), itspower-law exponent, gamma, exhibits a sharp jump from the blue cloud to the redsequence. the intermediate color `green' galaxy population likely includestransitional galaxies moving from the blue cloud to the red sequence; on largescales green galaxies are as clustered as red galaxies but show infallkinematics and a small-scale correlation slope akin to the blue galaxypopulation. 5) we compare our results to a semi-analytic galaxy formation modelapplied to the millenium run simulation. differences between the data and themodel suggest that in the model star formation is shut down too efficiently insatellite galaxies.

1006.3558	on the evolution of the velocity-mass-size relations of disk-dominated  galaxies over the past 10 billion years	we study the evolution of the scaling relations between maximum circularvelocity, stellar mass and optical half-light radius of star-formingdisk-dominated galaxies in the context of lcdm-based galaxy formation models.using data from the literature combined with new data from the deep2 and aegissurveys we show that there is a consistent observational and theoreticalpicture for the evolution of these scaling relations from z\sim 2 to z=0. theevolution of the observed stellar scaling relations is weaker than that of thevirial scaling relations of dark matter haloes, which can be reproduced, bothqualitatively and quantitatively, with a simple, cosmologically-motivated modelfor disk evolution inside growing nfw dark matter haloes. in this model opticalhalf-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circularvelocity, at higher redshifts. this model also predicts that the scalingrelations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than thecorresponding stellar relations. we emphasize, though, that this weak evolutiondoes not imply that individual galaxies evolve weakly. on the contrary,individual galaxies grow strongly in mass, size and velocity, but in such a waythat they move largely along the scaling relations. finally, recentobservations have claimed surprisingly large sizes for a number of star-formingdisk galaxies at z \sim 2, which has caused some authors to suggest that highredshift disk galaxies have abnormally high spin parameters. however, we arguethat the disk scale lengths in question have been systematically overestimatedby a factor \sim 2, and that there is an offset of a factor \sim 1.4 betweenh\alpha sizes and optical sizes. taking these effects into account, there is noindication that star forming galaxies at high redshifts (z\sim 2) haveabnormally high spin parameters.

1007.1967	absence of evidence is not evidence of absence: the color-density  relation at fixed stellar mass persists to z ~ 1	we use data drawn from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey to investigate therelationship between local galaxy density, stellar mass, and rest-frame galaxycolor. at z ~ 0.9, we find that the shape of the stellar mass function at thehigh-mass (log (m*/msun) &gt; 10.1) end depends on the local environment, withhigh-density regions favoring more massive systems. accounting for this stellarmass-environment relation (i.e., working at fixed stellar mass), we find asignificant color-density relation for galaxies with 10.6 &lt; log(m*/msun) &lt; 11.1and 0.75 &lt; z &lt; 0.95. this result is shown to be robust to variations in thesample selection and to extend to even lower masses (down to log(m*/msun) ~10.4). we conclude by discussing our results in comparison to recent works inthe literature, which report no significant correlation between galaxyproperties and environment at fixed stellar mass for the same redshift andstellar mass domain. the non-detection of environmental dependence found inother data sets is largely attributable to their smaller samples size and lowersampling density, as well as systematic effects such as inaccurate redshiftsand biased analysis techniques. ultimately, our results based on deep2 dataillustrate that the evolutionary state of a galaxy at z ~ 1 is not exclusivelydetermined by the stellar mass of the galaxy. instead, we show that localenvironment appears to play a distinct role in the transformation of galaxyproperties at z &gt; 1.

1007.2414	three-point correlation functions of sdss galaxies: luminosity and color  dependence in redshift and projected space	the three-point correlation function (3pcf) provides an important view intothe clustering of galaxies that is not available to its lower order cousin, thetwo-point correlation function (2pcf). higher order statistics, such as the3pcf, are necessary to probe the non-gaussian structure and shape informationexpected in these distributions. we measure the clustering of spectroscopicgalaxies in the main galaxy sample of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss),focusing on the shape or configuration dependence of the reduced 3pcf in bothredshift and projected space. this work constitutes the largest number ofgalaxies ever used to investigate the reduced 3pcf, using over 220,000 galaxiesin three volume-limited samples. we find significant configuration dependenceof the reduced 3pcf at 3-27 mpc/h, in agreement with lcdm predictions and indisagreement with the hierarchical ansatz. below 6 mpc/h, the redshift spacereduced 3pcf shows a smaller amplitude and weak configuration dependence incomparison with projected measurements suggesting that redshift distortions,and not galaxy bias, can make the reduced 3pcf appear consistent with thehierarchical ansatz. the reduced 3pcf shows a weaker dependence on luminositythan the 2pcf, with no significant dependence on scales above 9 mpc/h. onscales less than 9 mpc/h, the reduced 3pcf appears more affected by galaxycolor than luminosty. we demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of the 3pcf tosystematic effects such as sky completeness and binning scheme, along with thedifficulty of resolving the errors. some comparable analyses make assumptionsthat do not consistently account for these effects.

1007.3494	aegis: demographics of x-ray and optically selected agns	we develop a new diagnostic method to classify galaxies into agn hosts,star-forming galaxies, and absorption-dominated galaxies by combining the [oiii]/hbeta ratio with rest-frame u-b color. this can be used to robustly selectagns in galaxy samples at intermediate redshifts (z&lt;1). we compare the resultof this optical agn selection with x-ray selection using a sample of 3150galaxies with 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8 and i_ab&lt;22, selected from the deep2 galaxy redshiftsurvey and the all-wavelength extended groth strip international survey(aegis). among the 146 x-ray sources in this sample, 58% are classifiedoptically as emission-line agns, the rest as star-forming galaxies orabsorption-dominated galaxies. the latter are also known as "x-ray bright,optically normal galaxies" (xbongs). analysis of the relationship betweenoptical emission lines and x-ray properties shows that the completeness ofoptical agn selection suffers from dependence on the star formation rate andthe quality of observed spectra. it also shows that xbongs do not appear to bea physically distinct population from other x-ray detected, emission-line agns.on the other hand, x-ray agn selection also has strong bias. about 2/3 of allemission-line agns at l_bol&gt;10^44 erg/s in our sample are not detected in our200 ks chandra images, most likely due to moderate or heavy absorption by gasnear the agn. the 2--7 kev detection rate of seyfert 2s at z~0.6 suggests thattheir column density distribution and compton-thick fraction are similar tothat of local seyferts. multiple sample selection techniques are needed toobtain as complete a sample as possible.

1008.2560	galaxy peculiar velocities from large-scale supernova surveys as a dark  energy probe	upcoming imaging surveys such as the large synoptic survey telescope willrepeatedly scan large areas of sky and have the potential to yieldmillion-supernova catalogs. type ia supernovae are excellent standard candlesand will provide distance measures that suffice to detect mean pairwisevelocities of their host galaxies. we show that when combining these distancemeasures with photometric redshifts for either the supernovae or their hostgalaxies, the mean pairwise velocities of the host galaxies will provide a darkenergy probe which is competitive with other widely discussed methods. addinginformation from this test to type ia supernova photometric luminositydistances from the same experiment, plus the cosmic microwave background powerspectrum from the planck satellite, improves the dark energy task force figureof merit by a factor of 1.8. pairwise velocity measurements require noadditional observational effort beyond that required to perform the traditionalsupernova luminosity distance test, but may provide complementary constraintson dark energy parameters and the nature of gravity. incorporating additionalspectroscopic redshift follow-up observations could provide important darkenergy constraints from pairwise velocities alone. mean pairwise velocities aremuch less sensitive to systematic redshift errors than the luminosity distancetest or weak lensing techniques, and also are only mildly affected bysystematic evolution of supernova luminosity.

1109.2121	improving correlation function fitting with ridge regression:  application to cross-correlation reconstruction	cross-correlation techniques provide a promising avenue for calibratingphotometric redshifts and determining redshift distributions using spectroscopywhich is systematically incomplete (e.g., current deep spectroscopic surveysfail to obtain secure redshifts for 30-50% or more of the galaxies targeted).in this paper we improve on the redshift distribution reconstruction methodspresented in matthews &amp; newman (2010) by incorporating full covarianceinformation into our correlation function fits. correlation functionmeasurements are strongly covariant between angular or spatial bins, andaccounting for this in fitting can yield substantial reduction in errors.however, frequently the covariance matrices used in these calculations aredetermined from a relatively small set (dozens rather than hundreds) ofsubsamples or mock catalogs, resulting in noisy covariance matrices whoseinversion is ill-conditioned and numerically unstable. we present here a methodof conditioning the covariance matrix known as ridge regression which resultsin a more well behaved inversion than other techniques common in large-scalestructure studies. we demonstrate that ridge regression significantly improvesthe determination of correlation function parameters. we then apply theseimproved techniques to the problem of reconstructing redshift distributions. byincorporating full covariance information, applying ridge regression, andchanging the weighting of fields in obtaining average correlation functions, weobtain reductions in the mean redshift distribution reconstruction error of asmuch as ~40% compared to previous methods. in an appendix, we provide adescription of powerfit, an idl code for performing power-law fits tocorrelation functions with ridge regression conditioning that we are makingpublicly available.

1111.2862	kiloparsec-scale spatial offsets in double-peaked narrow-line active  galactic nuclei. i. markers for selection of compelling dual active galactic  nucleus candidates	merger-remnant galaxies with kpc-scale separation dual active galactic nuclei(agns) should be widespread as a consequence of galaxy mergers and triggeredgas accretion onto supermassive black holes, yet very few dual agns have beenobserved. galaxies with double-peaked narrow agn emission lines in the sloandigital sky survey are plausible dual agn candidates, but their double-peakedprofiles could also be the result of gas kinematics or agn-driven outflows andjets on small or large scales. to help distinguish between these scenarios, wehave obtained spatial profiles of the agn emission via follow-up long-slitspectroscopy of 81 double-peaked narrow-line agns in sdss at 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.36using lick, palomar, and mmt observatories. we find that all 81 systems exhibitdouble agn emission components with ~kpc projected spatial separations on thesky, which suggests that they are produced by kpc-scale dual agns or kpc-scaleoutflows, jets, or rotating gaseous disks. in addition, we find that thesubsample (58%) of the objects with spatially compact emission components maybe preferentially produced by dual agns, while the subsample (42%) withspatially extended emission components may be preferentially produced by agnoutflows. we also find that for 32% of the sample the two agn emissioncomponents are preferentially aligned with the host galaxy major axis, asexpected for dual agns orbiting in the host galaxy potential. our results bothnarrow the list of possible physical mechanisms producing the double agncomponents, and suggest several observational criteria for selecting the mostpromising dual agn candidates from the full sample of double-peaked narrow-lineagns. using these criteria, we determine the 17 most compelling dual agncandidates in our sample.

1206.0735	candels: the contribution of the observed galaxy population to cosmic  reionization	we present measurements of the specific ultraviolet luminosity density from asample of 483 galaxies at 6&lt;z&lt;8. these galaxies were selected from new deepnear-infrared hst imaging from the candels, hudf09 and ers programs. incontrast to the majority of previous analyses, which assume that thedistribution of galaxy ultraviolet (uv) luminosities follows a schechterdistribution, and that the distribution continues to luminosities far below ourobservable limit, we investigate the contribution to reionization from galaxieswhich we can observe, free from these assumptions. we find that the observablepopulation of galaxies can sustain a fully reionized igm at z=6, if the averageionizing photon escape fraction (f_esc) is ~30%. a number of previous studieshave measured uv luminosity densities at these redshifts that vary by 5x, withmany concluding that galaxies could not complete reionization by z=6 unless alarge population of galaxies fainter than the detection limit were invoked, orextremely high values of f_esc were present. the observed uv luminosity densityfrom our observed galaxy samples at z=7-8 is not sufficient to maintain a fullyreionized igm unless f_esc&gt;50%. combining our observations with constraints onthe emission rate of ionizing photons from ly-alpha forest observations at z=6,we can constrain f_esc&lt;34% (2-sigma) if the observed galaxies are the onlycontributors to reionization, or &lt;13% (2-sigma) if the luminosity functionextends to m_uv = -13. these escape fractions are sufficient to completereionization by z=6. these constraints imply that the volume ionized fractionof the igm becomes less than unity at z&gt;7, consistent with a number ofcomplementary reionization probes. if faint galaxies dominate reionization,future jwst observations will probe deep enough to see them, providing anindirect constraint on the ionizing photon escape fraction [abridged].

1207.1074	mind the gap: tightening the mass-richness relation with magnitude gaps	we investigate the potential to improve optical tracers of cluster mass byexploiting measurements of the magnitude gap, m12, defined as the differencebetween the r-band absolute magnitude of the two brightest cluster members. wefind that in a mock sample of galaxy groups and clusters constructed from thebolshoi simulation, the scatter about the mass-richness relation decreases by15-20% when magnitude gap information is included. a similar trend is evidentin a volume-limited, spectroscopic sample of galaxy groups observed in thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). we find that sdss groups with small magnitudegaps are richer than large-gap groups at fixed values of the one-dimensionalvelocity dispersion among group members sigma_v, which we use as a mass proxy.we demonstrate explicitly that m12 contains information about cluster mass thatsupplements the information provided by group richness and the luminosity ofthe brightest cluster galaxy, l_bcg. in so doing, we show that the luminositiesof the members of a group with richness n are inconsistent with thedistribution of luminosities that results from n random draws from the globalgalaxy luminosity function. as the cosmological constraining power of galaxyclusters is limited by the precision in cluster mass determination, ourfindings suggest a new way to improve the cosmological constraints derived fromgalaxy clusters.

1310.0615	measuring galaxy [oii] emission line doublet with future ground-based  wide-field spectroscopic surveys	the next generation of wide-field spectroscopic redshift surveys will map thelarge-scale galaxy distribution in the redshift range 0.7&lt; z&lt;2 to measurebaryonic acoustic oscillations (bao). the primary optical signature used inthis redshift range comes from the [oii] emission line doublet, which providesa unique redshift identification that can minimize confusion with other singleemission lines. to derive the required spectrograph resolution for theseredshift surveys, we simulate observations of the [oii] (3727,3729) doublet forvarious instrument resolutions, and line velocities. we foresee two strategiesabout the choice of the resolution for future spectrographs for bao surveys.for bright [oii] emitter surveys ([oii] flux ~30.10^{-17} erg /cm2/s likesdss-iv/eboss), a resolution of r~3300 allows the separation of 90 percent ofthe doublets. the impact of the sky lines on the completeness in redshift isless than 6 percent. for faint [oii] emitter surveys ([oii] flux ~10.10^{-17}erg /cm2/s like desi), the detection improves continuously with resolution, sowe recommend the highest possible resolution, the limit being given by thenumber of pixels (4k by 4k) on the detector and the number of spectroscopicchannels (2 or 3).

1310.0836	x-ray surface brightness profiles of active galactic nuclei in the  extended groth strip: implications for agn feedback	using data from the all wavelength extended groth strip international survey(aegis) we statistically detect the extended x-ray emission in the interstellarmedium (ism)/intra-cluster medium (icm) in both active and normal galaxies at0.3 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.3. for both active galactic nuclei (agn) host galaxy and normalgalaxy samples that are matched in restframe color, luminosity, and redshiftdistribution, we tentatively detect excess x-ray emission at scales of 1--10arcsec at a few sigma significance in the surface brightness profiles. theexact significance of this detection is sensitive to the true characterizationof chandra's point spread function. the observed excess in the surfacebrightness profiles is suggestive of lower extended emission in agn hostscompared to normal galaxies. this is qualitatively similar to theoreticalpredictions of the x-ray surface brightness profile from agn feedback models,where feedback from agn is likely to evacuate the gas from the center of thegalaxy/cluster. we propose that agn that are intrinsically under-luminous inx-rays, but have equivalent bolometric luminosities to our sources will be theideal sample to study more robustly the effect of agn feedback on diffuseism/icm gas.

1407.1078	improved estimates of the milky way's stellar mass and star formation  rate from hierarchical bayesian meta-analysis	we present improved estimates of several global properties of the milky way,including its current star formation rate (sfr), the stellar mass contained inits disk and bulge+bar components, as well as its total stellar mass. we do soby combining previous measurements from the literature using a hierarchicalbayesian (hb) statistical method that allows us to account for the possibilitythat any value may be incorrect or have underestimated errors. we show thatthis method is robust to a wide variety of assumptions about the nature ofproblems in individual measurements or error estimates. ultimately, ouranalysis yields a sfr for the galaxy of $\dot{\mathrm{m}}_\star=1.65\pm0.19$$\textrm{m}_\odot \textrm{yr}^{-1}$, assuming a kroupa initial mass function(imf). by combining hb methods with monte carlo simulations that incorporatethe latest estimates of the galactocentric radius of the sun, $r_0$, theexponential scale length of the disk, $l_d$, and the local surface density ofstellar mass, $\sigma_\star(r_0)$, we show that the mass of the galacticbulge+bar is $\textrm{m}_\star^b=0.91\pm0.07\times10^{10}$ $\textrm{m}_\odot$,the disk mass is $\textrm{m}_\star^d=5.17\pm1.11\times10^{10}$$\textrm{m}_\odot$, and their combination yields a total stellar mass of$\textrm{m}_\star=6.08\pm1.14\times10^{10}$ $\textrm{m}_\odot$ (assuming akroupa imf and an exponential disk profile). this analysis is based upon a newcompilation of literature bulge mass estimates, normalized to commonassumptions about the stellar initial mass function and galactic diskproperties, presented herein. we additionally find a bulge-to-total mass ratiofor the milky way of $b/t=0.150^{+0.028}_{-0.019}$ and a specific starformation rate of$\dot{\mathrm{m}}_\star/\textrm{m}_\star=2.71\pm0.59\times10^{-11}\textrm{yr}^{-1}$.

1410.4506	spectroscopic needs for calibration of lsst photometric redshifts	this white paper summarizes the conclusions of the snowmass white paper"spectroscopic needs for imaging dark energy experiments" (arxiv:1309.5384)which are relevant to the calibration of lsst photometric redshifts; i.e., theaccurate characterization of biases and uncertainties in photo-z's. anysignificant miscalibration will lead to systematic errors in photo-z's,impacting nearly all extragalactic science with lsst. as existing deep redshiftsamples have failed to yield highly-secure redshifts for a systematic 20%-60%of their targets, it is a strong possibility that future deep spectroscopicsamples will not solve the calibration problem on their own. the best optionsin this scenario are provided by cross-correlation methods that utilizeclustering with objects from spectroscopic surveys (which need not be fullyrepresentative) to trace the redshift distribution of the full sample. forspectroscopy, the eboss survey would enable a basic calibration of lsstphotometric redshifts, while the expected lsst-desi overlap would be more thansufficient for an accurate calibration at z&gt;0.2. a desi survey of nearbygalaxies conducted in bright time would enable accurate calibration down toz~0. the expanded areal coverage provided by the transfer of the desiinstrument (or duplication of it at the blanco telescope) would enable the bestpossible calibration from cross-correlations, in addition to other sciencegains.

1410.5439	the evolution of the galaxy rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function  over the first two billion years	we present a robust measurement and analysis of the rest-frame ultraviolet(uv) luminosity function at z=4-8. we use deep hubble space telescope imagingover the candels/goods fields, the hubble ultra deep field and the year 1hubble frontier field deep parallel observations. these surveys provides aneffective volume of 0.6-1.2 x 10^6 mpc^3 over this epoch, allowing us toperform a robust search for faint (m_uv=-18) and bright (m_uv &lt; -21) galaxies.we select candidate galaxies using a well-tested photometric redshift techniquewith careful screening of contaminants, finding a sample of 7446 galaxies at3.5&lt;z&lt;8.5, with &gt;1000 galaxies at z~6-8. we measure the luminosity functionusing a markov chain monte carlo analysis to measure robust uncertainties. atthe faint end our results agree with previous studies, yet we find a higherabundance of uv-bright galaxies at z&gt;6, with m* ~ -21 at z&gt;5, different thanthat inferred based on previous trends at lower redshift. at z=8, a singlepower-law provides an equally good fit to the uv luminosity function, while atz=6 and 7, an exponential cutoff at the bright-end is moderately preferred. wecompare to semi-analytical models, and find that the lack of evolution in m* isconsistent with models where the impact of dust attenuation on the bright-endof the luminosity function decreases at higher redshift. we measure theevolution of the cosmic star-formation rate density, correcting for dustattenuation, and find that it declines as (1+z)^(-4.3 +/- 0.5) at z&gt;4,consistent with observations at z&gt;9. our observations are consistent with areionization history that starts at z&gt;10, completes at z&gt;6, and reaches amidpoint (x_hii = 0.5) at 6.7&lt;z&lt;9.4. finally, our observations predict that theabundance of bright z=9 galaxies is likely higher than previous constraints,though consistent with recent estimates of bright z~10 galaxies.

0804.4686	ubiquitous outflows in deep2 spectra of star-forming galaxies at z=1.4	galactic winds are a prime suspect for the metal enrichment of theintergalactic medium and may have a strong influence on the chemical evolutionof galaxies and the nature of qso absorption line systems. we use a sample of1406 galaxy spectra at z~1.4 from the deep2 redshift survey to show thatblueshifted mg ii 2796, 2803 a absorption is ubiquitous in starforming galaxiesat this epoch. this is the first detection of frequent outflowing galacticwinds at z~1. the presence and depth of absorption are independent of agnspectral signatures or galaxy morphology; major mergers are not a prerequisitefor driving a galactic wind from massive galaxies. outflows are found incoadded spectra of galaxies spanning a range of 30x in stellar mass and 10x instar formation rate (sfr), calibrated from k-band and from mips ir fluxes. theoutflows have column densities of order n_h ~ 10^20 cm^-2 and characteristicvelocities of ~ 300-500 km/sec, with absorption seen out to 1000 km/sec in themost massive, highest sfr galaxies. the velocities suggest that the outflowinggas can escape into the igm and that massive galaxies can producecosmologically and chemically significant outflows. both the mg ii equivalentwidth and the outflow velocity are larger for galaxies of higher stellar massand sfr, with v_wind ~ sfr^0.3, similar to the scaling in low redshiftir-luminous galaxies. the high frequency of outflows in the star-forming galaxypopulation at z~1 indicates that galactic winds occur in the progenitors ofmassive spirals as well as those of ellipticals. the increase of outflowvelocity with mass and sfr constrains theoretical models of galaxy evolutionthat include feedback from galactic winds, and may favor momentum-driven modelsfor the wind physics.

0805.0004	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: environments of poststarburst galaxies  at z~0.1 and z~0.8	postststarburst (k+a) galaxies are candidates for galaxies in transition froma star-forming phase to a passively-evolving phase. we have spectroscopicallyidentified large samples of k+a galaxies both in the sdss at z~0.1 and in thedeep2 survey at z~0.8, using a robust selection method based on a cut in hbetaemission rather than the more problematic [oii] 3727. based on measurements ofthe overdensity of galaxies around each object, we find that k+a galaxiesbrighter than 0.4l*_b at low-z have a similar, statistically indistinguishableenvironment distribution as blue galaxies, preferring underdense environments,but dramatically different from that of red galaxies. however, at higher-z, theenvironment distribution of k+a galaxies is more similar to red galaxies thanto blue galaxies. we conclude that the quenching of star formation and thebuild-up of the red sequence through the k+a phase is happening in relativelyoverdense environments at z~1 but in relatively underdense environments at z~0.although the relative environments where quenching occurs are decreasing withtime, the corresponding absolute environment may have stayed the same alongwith the quenching mechanisms, because the mean absolute environments of allgalaxies has to grow with time. in addition, we do not find any significantdependence on luminosity in the environment distribution of k+as. the existenceof a large k+a population in the field at both redshifts indicates thatcluster-specific mechanisms cannot be the dominant route by which thesegalaxies are formed. we also demonstrates that studying k+a-environmentrelations by measuring the k+a fraction in different environments is highlynon-robust. statistical comparisons of the overall environment distributions ofdifferent populations are much better behaved.

(2001). these revisions alter the zeropoints and slopes of the cepheid period-luminosity (p-l) relations derived atthe large magellanic cloud (lmc), the calibration of the hst wfpc2 camera, andthe treatment of metallicity differences. we also provide herein fullinformation on the cepheids described in maoz et al. 1999. using the refinedkey project techniques and calibrations, we determine the distance modulus ofngc 4258 to be 29.47 +/- 0.09 mag (unique to this determination) +/- 0.15 mag(systematic uncertainties in key project distances), corresponding to a metricdistance of 7.8 +/- 0.3 +/- 0.5 mpc and 1.2 sigma from the maser distance of7.2 +/- 0.5 mpc. we also test the alternative cepheid p-l relations of feast(1999), which yield more discrepant results. additionally, we place weak limitsupon the distance to the lmc and upon the effect of metallicity in cepheiddistance determinations.

astro-ph;0109130	measuring the cosmic equation of state with counts of galaxies ii: error  budget for the deep2 redshift survey	in a previous paper, we described a new variant on the classical dn/dz testwhich could be performed using upcoming redshift surveys. by observing thevelocity function of galaxies rather than their luminosity function, it ispossible to avoid many of the uncertainties of galaxy evolution while employinga directly measurable quantity. we previously assumed that counting statisticswould dominate the errors in this method. here, we present the results ofincluding cosmic variance and determine the impact of systematic effects onapplication of this test to the upcoming deep2 redshift survey. for deep2,cosmic variance should yield errors roughly twice those predicted from poissonstatistics. through monte carlo simulations we find that if the functionalform, but not the strength, of any of the major systematic effects (baryonicinfall, velocity errors, and incompleteness) is known, the systematic maysuccessfully be corrected for using the observed velocity function, leaving amuch smaller residual error. the total uncertainty from systematics iscomparable to that from cosmic variance, but correlated amongst redshift bins.we find that deep2 can provide a much more precise measurement of the cosmicequation of state parameter w than any available today, albeit weaker than someother proposed tests.

astro-ph;0109131	measuring the cosmic equation of state with galaxy clusters in the deep2  redshift survey	the abundances of groups and clusters of galaxies are expected to havechanged substantially since high redshift, with the strength of this evolutiondependent upon fundamental cosmological parameters. upcoming large redshiftsurveys of distant galaxies will make it possible to measure these quantitiesat z~1; when combined with the results of local redshift surveys currentlyunderway, the evolution of cluster abundances may be determined. the deep2redshift survey, planned to begin in spring 2002, is particularly well-suitedfor this work because of the high spectroscopic resolution to be used; velocitydispersions of groups will be readily measurable. in this paper, we determinethe constraints on dark energy models that counts of deep2 clusters shouldprovide. we find that comparing cosmological models using the simultaneousdistribution of clusters in both velocity dispersion and redshift yieldssignificantly stronger constraints than the redshift distribution alone. themethod can be made more powerful by employing a value of the fluctuationamplitude sigma_8 determined with upcoming techniques (external to deep2) thathave no omega_m degeneracy. the equation-of-state parameter for dark energymodels, w=p/rho, can then be measured to ~0.1 from observations of clustersalone.

astro-ph;0112370	three-dimensional identification and reconstruction of galaxy systems  within deep redshift surveys	we have developed a new geometrical method for identifying and reconstructinga homogeneous and highly complete set of galaxy groups in the next generationof deep, flux-limited redshift surveys. our method combines information fromthe three-dimensional voronoi diagram and its dual, the delaunay triangulation,to obtain group and cluster catalogs that are remarkably robust over wideranges in redshift and degree of density enhancement. using the mock deep2catalogs, we demonstrate that the vdm algorithm can be used to identify ahomogeneous set of groups in a magnitude-limited sample ($i\sbr{ab}\le23.5$)throughout the survey redshift window $0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.2$. the actual groupmembership can be effectively reconstructed even in the distorted redshiftspace environment for systems with line of sight velocity dispersion$\sigma_{los}$ greater than $\approx 200$ \kms. by comparing the galaxy clustercatalog derived from the mock deep2 observations to the underlying distributionof clusters found in real space with much fainter galaxies included (whichshould more closely trace mass in the cluster), we can assess completeness invelocity dispersion directly. we conclude that the recovered deep2 group andcluster sample should be statistically complete for $\sigma_{los} \gtrsim 400$\kms. finally, we argue that the reconstructed bivariate distribution ofsystems as a function of redshift and velocity dispersion reproduces with highfidelity the underlying real space distribution and can thus be used robustlyto constrain cosmological parameters

astro-ph;0305587	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: spectral classification of galaxies at  z~1	we present a principal component analysis (pca)-based spectralclassification, eta, for the first 5600 galaxies observed in the deep2 redshiftsurvey. this parameter provides a very pronounced separation between absorptionand emission dominated galaxy spectra - corresponding to passively evolving andactively star-forming galaxies in the survey respectively. in addition it isshown that despite the high resolution of the observed spectra, this parameteralone can be used to quite accurately reconstruct any given galaxy spectrum,suggesting there are not many `degrees of freedom' in the observed spectra ofthis galaxy population. it is argued that this form of classification, eta,will be particularly valuable in making future comparisons between high andlow-redshift galaxy surveys for which very large spectroscopic samples are nowreadily available, particularly when used in conjunction with high-resolutionspectral synthesis models which will be made public in the near future. we alsodiscuss the relative advantages of this approach to distant galaxyclassification compared to other methods such as colors and morphologies.finally, we compare the classification derived here with that adopted for the2df galaxy redshift survey and in so doing show that the two systems are verysimilar. this will be particularly useful in subsequent analyses when makingcomparisons between results from each of these surveys to study evolution inthe galaxy populations and large-scale structure.

astro-ph;0408344	constraining dark energy with deep2	the deep2 survey has now completed half of its planned three-year lifespan,and we have collected approximately 50% of the data, putting us exactly onschedule. the survey plan calls for spectroscopic coverage by july of 2005 of\~60,000 galaxies over 3.5 square degrees to a limiting magnitude ofr_{ab}=24.1; the great majority of these objects are at 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.4. we describehere one method by which deep2 can set constraints on the equation of stateparameter of the dark energy, w. by counting the number of virialized groupsand clusters we find in redshift space as a function of their redshift andinternal velocity dispersion, we probe both the volume element and the growthof structure at z~1, each of which depends on w. studies of early deep2 dataindicate that the method is likely to work, and preliminary indications arethat a total of ~250 small groups will be counted in the full survey, leadingto a constraint \delta w ~ 0.1 if combined with both the velocity dispersiondistribution of z~0 clusters from the sloan digital sky survey and anindependent measurement of \sigma_8. we also provide a general description ofthe deep2 observations and target selection, including the algorithm by whichgalaxies are placed on slitmasks, to provide context for discussion of deep2cluster samples.

astro-ph;0409305	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: probing the evolution of dark matter  halos around isolated galaxies at z ~ 1	using the first 25% of deep2 redshift survey data, we probe the line-of-sightvelocity dispersion profile for isolated galaxies with absolute b-bandmagnitude -22&lt;m_b-5log(h)&lt;-21 at z=0.7-1.0, using satellite galaxies asluminous tracers of the underlying velocity distribution. measuring thevelocity dispersion beyond a galactocentric radius of ~200 kpc/h (physical)permits us to determine the total mass, including dark matter, around thesebright galaxies. we find a line-of-sight velocity dispersion (sigma_los) of162^{+44}_{-30} km/s at ~110 kpc/h, 136^{+26}_{-20} km/s at ~230 kpc/h, and150^{+55}_{-38} km/s at ~320 kpc/h. assuming an nfw model for the dark matterdensity profile, this corresponds to a mass within r_{200} ofm_200=5.5^{+2.5}_{-2.0} x 10^12 m_sun/h for our sample of satellite hosts withmean luminosity ~2.5l*. roughly $~60% of these host galaxies have early-typespectra and are red in restframe (u-b) color, consistent with the overall deep2sample in the same luminosity and redshift range. the halo mass determined fordeep2 host galaxies is consistent with that measured in the sloan digital skysurvey for host galaxies within a similar luminosity range relative to m*_b.this comparison is insensitive to the assumed halo mass profile, and implies anincrease in the dynamical mass-to-light ratio (m_200/l_b) of isolated galaxieswhich host satellites by a factor of ~2.5 from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. our results areconsistent with scenarios in which galaxies populate dark matter halossimilarly from z ~ 0 to z ~ 1, except for ~1 magnitude of evolution in theluminosity of all galaxies.

astro-ph;0410721	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: first results on galaxy groups	we use the first 25% of the deep2 galaxy redshift survey spectroscopic datato identify groups and clusters of galaxies in redshift space. the data setcontains 8370 galaxies with confirmed redshifts in the range 0.7 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.4,over one square degree on the sky. groups are identified using an algorithm(the voronoi-delaunay method) that has been shown to accurately reproduce thestatistics of groups in simulated deep2-like samples. we optimize thisalgorithm for the deep2 survey by applying it to realistic mock galaxy catalogsand assessing the results using a stringent set of criteria for measuringgroup-finding success, which we develop and describe in detail here. we find inparticular that the group-finder can successfully identify ~78% of real groupsand that ~79% of the galaxies that are true members of groups can be identifiedas such. conversely, we estimate that ~55% of the groups we find can bedefinitively identified with real groups and that ~46% of the galaxies we placeinto groups are interloper field galaxies. most importantly, we find that it ispossible to measure the distribution of groups in redshift and velocitydispersion, n(sigma,z), to an accuracy limited by cosmic variance, fordispersions greater than 350km/s. we anticipate that such measurements willallow strong constraints to be placed on the equation of state of the darkenergy in the future. finally, we present the first deep2 group catalog, whichassigns 32% of the galaxies to 899 distinct groups with two or more members,153 of which have velocity dispersions above 350km/s. we provide locations,redshifts and properties for this high-dispersion subsample. this catalogrepresents the largest sample to date of spectroscopically detected groups atz~1.

astro-ph;0506518	measuring galaxy environments with deep redshift surveys	we study the applicability of several galaxy environment measures(n^th-nearest-neighbor distance, counts in an aperture, and voronoi volume)within deep redshift surveys. mock galaxy catalogs are employed to mimicrepresentative photometric and spectroscopic surveys at high redshift (z ~ 1).we investigate the effects of survey edges, redshift precision, redshift-spacedistortions, and target selection upon each environment measure. we find thateven optimistic photometric redshift errors (\sigma_z = 0.02) smear out theline-of-sight galaxy distribution irretrievably on small scales; thissignificantly limits the application of photometric redshift surveys toenvironment studies. edges and holes in a survey field dramatically affect theestimation of environment, with the impact of edge effects depending upon theadopted environment measure. these edge effects considerably limit theusefulness of smaller survey fields (e.g. the goods fields) for studies ofgalaxy environment. in even the poorest groups and clusters, redshift-spacedistortions limit the effectiveness of each environment statistic; measuringdensity in projection (e.g. using counts in a cylindrical aperture or aprojected n^th-nearest-neighbor distance measure) significantly improves theaccuracy of measures in such over-dense environments. for the deep2 galaxyredshift survey, we conclude that among the environment estimators tested theprojected n^th-nearest-neighbor distance measure provides the most accurateestimate of local galaxy density over a continuous and broad range of scales.

astro-ph;0508250	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the evolution of void statistics from  z~1 to z~0	we present measurements of the void probability function (vpf) at z~1 usingdata from the deep2 redshift survey and its evolution to z~0 using data fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we measure the vpf as a function of galaxycolor and luminosity in both surveys and find that it mimics trends displayedin the two-point correlation function, $\xi$; namely that samples of brighter,red galaxies have larger voids (i.e. are more strongly clustered) than fainter,blue galaxies. we also clearly detect evolution in the vpf with cosmic time,with voids being larger in comoving units at z~0. we find that the reduced vpfmatches the predictions of a `negative binomial' model for galaxies of allcolors, luminosities, and redshifts studied. this model lacks a physicalmotivation, but produces a simple analytic prediction for sources of any numberdensity and integrated two-point correlation function, \bar{\xi}. this impliesthat differences in the vpf across different galaxy populations are consistentwith being due entirely to differences in the population number density and\bar{\xi}. the robust result that all galaxy populations follow the negativebinomial model appears to be due to primarily to the clustering of dark matterhalos. the reduced vpf is insensitive to changes in the parameters of the halooccupation distribution, in the sense that halo models with the same \bar{\xi}will produce the same vpf. for the wide range of galaxies studied, the vpftherefore does not appear to provide useful constraints on galaxy evolutionmodels that cannot be gleaned from studies of \bar{\xi} alone.

astro-ph;0512446	on the origin of [oii] emission in red sequence and post-starburst  galaxies	we investigate the emission-line properties of galaxies with red rest-framecolors using spectra from sdss dr4. emission lines are detected in more thanhalf of the red galaxies. we focus on the relationship between two emissionlines commonly used as star formation rate indicators: ha 6563 and [oii] 3727.there is a strong bimodality in [oii]/ha ratio in the full sdss sample whichclosely corresponds to the bimodality in rest-frame color. nearly all of theline-emitting red galaxies have line ratios typical of various types of agn --most commonly liners, a small fraction of transition objects and, more rarely,seyferts. only ~6% of red galaxies display star-forming line ratios. a straightline in the [oii]-ha equivalent width plane separates liner-like galaxies fromother categories. quiescent galaxies with no detectable emission lines andliner-like galaxies combine to form a single, tight red sequence incolor-magnitude-concentration space. [oii] ews in liner- and agn-like galaxiescan be as large as in star-forming galaxies. thus, unless objects withagn/liner-like line ratios are excluded, [oii] emission cannot be used directlyas a proxy for star formation rate. lack of [oii] emission is generally used toindicate lack of star formation when post-starburst galaxies are selected athigh redshift. our results imply, however, that these samples have been cut onagn properties as well as star formation, and therefore may provide seriouslyincomplete sets of post-starburst galaxies. furthermore, post-starburstgalaxies identifed in sdss by requiring minimal ha ew generally exhibit weakbut nonzero line emission with ratios typical of agns; few of them showresidual star formation. this suggests that most post-starbursts may harboragns/liners.

astro-ph;0607512	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: evolution of the color-density  relation at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.35	using a sample of 19,464 galaxies drawn from the deep2 galaxy redshiftsurvey, we study the relationship between galaxy color and environment at 0.4 &lt;z &lt; 1.35. we find that the fraction of galaxies on the red sequence dependsstrongly on local environment out to z &gt; 1, being larger in regions of greatergalaxy density. at all epochs probed, we also find a small population of red,morphologically early-type galaxies residing in regions of low measuredoverdensity. the observed correlations between the red fraction and localoverdensity are highly significant, with the trend at z &gt; 1 detected at agreater than 5-\sigma level. over the entire redshift regime studied, we findthat the color-density relation evolves continuously, with red galaxies morestrongly favoring overdense regions at low z relative to their red-sequencecounterparts at high redshift. at z ~ 1.3, the red fraction only weaklycorrelates with overdensity, implying that any color dependence to theclustering of ~ l* galaxies at that epoch must be small. our findings addweight to existing evidence that the build-up of galaxies on the red sequencehas occurred preferentially in overdense environments (i.e., galaxy groups) atz &lt; 1.5. the strength of the observed evolutionary trends at 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.35suggests that the correlations observed locally, such as the morphology-densityand color-density relations, are the result of environment-driven mechanisms(i.e., "nurture'') and do not appear to have been imprinted (by "nature'') uponthe galaxy population during their epoch of formation.

astro-ph;0608569	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the evolution of the blue fraction in  groups and the field	we explore the behavior of the blue galaxy fraction over the redshift range0.75 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.3 in the deep2 survey, both for field galaxies and for galaxiesin groups. the primary aim is to determine the role that groups play in drivingthe evolution of galaxy colour at high z. the colour segregation observedbetween local group and field samples is already in place at z ~ 1: deep2groups have a significantly lower blue fraction than the field. at fixed z,there is also a correlation between blue fraction and galaxy magnitude, suchthat brighter galaxies are more likely to be red, both in groups and in thefield. in addition, there is a negative correlation between blue fraction andgroup richness. in terms of evolution, the blue fraction in groups and thefield remains roughly constant from z=0.75 to z ~ 1, but beyond this redshiftthe blue fraction in groups rises rapidly with z, and the group and field bluefractions become indistinguishable at z ~ 1.3. careful tests indicate that thiseffect does not arise from known systematic or selection effects. to furtherensure the robustness of this result, we build on previous mock deep2catalogues to develop mock catalogues that reproduce the colour-overdensityrelation observed in deep2 and use these to test our methods. the convergencebetween the group and field blue fractions at z ~ 1.3 implies that deep2 galaxygroups only became efficient at quenching star formation at z ~ 2; this resultis broadly consistent with other recent observations and with current models ofgalaxy evolution and hierarchical structure growth.

astro-ph;9703023	measurement of an agn central mass on centiparsec scales: results of  long-term optical monitoring of arp 102b	the optical spectrum of the broad-line radio galaxy arp 102b has beenmonitored for more than thirteen years to investigate the nature of the sourceof its broad, double-peaked hydrogen balmer emission lines. the shape of thelines varied subtly; there was an interval during which the variation in theratio of the fluxes of the two peaks appeared to be sinusoidal, with a periodof 2.16 years and an amplitude of about 16% of the average value. the variablepart of the broad h-alpha line is well fit by a model in which a region ofexcess emission (a quiescent ``hot spot'') within an accretion disk (fitted tothe non-varying portion of the double-peaked line) completes at least twocircular orbits and eventually fades. fits to spectra from epochs when the hotspot is not present allow determination of the disk inclination, while fits forepochs when it is present provide a measurement of the radius of the hot spot'sorbit. from these data and the period of variation, we find that the masswithin the hot spot's orbit is 2.2 +0.2/-0.7 times 10^8 solar masses, withinthe range of previous estimates of masses of active galactic nuclei. becausethis mass is determined at a relatively small distance (~1000 au) from thecentral body, it is extremely difficult to explain without assuming that asupermassive black hole lies within arp 102b. the lack of any systematic changein the velocity of the blue peak over time yields a lower limit on the combinedmass of the two bodies in a binary black hole model like that of gaskell (1983)of 10^10 solar masses.

astro-ph;9904368	a cepheid distance to ngc 4603 in centaurus	in an attempt to use cepheid variables to determine the distance to thecentaurus cluster, we have obtained images of ngc 4603 with the hubble spacetelescope on 9 epochs using wfpc2 and the f555w and f814w filters. this galaxyhas been suggested to lie within the ``cen30'' portion of the cluster and isthe most distant object for which this method has been attempted. previousdistance estimates for cen30 have varied significantly and some have presenteddisagreements with the peculiar velocity predicted from redshift surveys,motivating this investigation. using our observations, we have found 61candidate cepheid variable stars; however, a significant fraction of thesecandidates are likely to be nonvariable stars whose magnitude measurementerrors happen to fit a cepheid light curve of significant amplitude for somechoice of period and phase. through a maximum likelihood technique, wedetermine that we have observed 43 +/- 7 real cepheids and that ngc 4603 has adistance modulus of 32.61 +0.11/-0.10 (random, 1 sigma) +0.24/-0.25(systematic, adding in quadrature), corresponding to a distance of 33.3 mpc.this is consistent with a number of recent estimates of the distance to ngc4603 or cen30 and implies a small peculiar velocity consistent with predictionsfrom the iras 1.2 jy redshift survey if the galaxy lies in the foreground ofthe cluster.

astro-ph;9908140	a cepheid distance to ngc 4258	distances measured using cepheid variable stars have been essential forestablishing the cosmological distance scale and the value of the hubbleconstant. these stars have remained the primary extragalactic distanceindicator since 1929 because of the small observed scatter in the relationshipbetween their pulsation period and luminosity, their large numbers, which allowmany independent measures of the distance to a galaxy, and the simplicity ofthe basic physics underlying their variability. potential systematicuncertainties in the use of the lmc-calibrated cepheid period-luminosityrelation to determine distances using hst are estimated to be 8-10%. here wedescribe the results of a search for cepheids in the nearby galaxy ngc 4258,which has an independently determined geometric distance of 7.2 +/- 0.5 mpc(herrnstein et al. 1999). we obtain a cepheid distance of 8.1 +/- 0.4(excluding possible systematic errors affecting all hst cepheid distances) mpc;there is a 1.3 sigma difference between the two measurements. if themaser-based distance is adopted and other hst cepheid distances are revisedaccording to our results, the derived value of the hubble constant would beincreased by 12 +/- 9%, and the corresponding age of the universe woulddecrease by the same factor.

astro-ph;9912366	measuring the cosmic equation of state with counts of galaxies	the classical dn/dz test allows the determination of fundamental cosmologicalparameters from the evolution of the cosmic volume element. this test isapplied by measuring the redshift distribution of a tracer whose evolution innumber density is known. in the past, ordinary galaxies have been used as sucha tracer; however, in the absence of a complete theory of galaxy formation,that method is fraught with difficulties. in this paper, we propose studyinginstead the evolution of the apparent abundance of dark matter halos as afunction of their circular velocity, observable via the linewidths or rotationspeeds of visible galaxies. upcoming redshift surveys will allow the linewidthdistribution of galaxies to be determined at both z~1 and the present day. inthe course of studying this test, we have devised a rapid, improvedsemi-analytic method for calculating the circular velocity distribution of darkhalos based upon the analytic mass function of sheth et al. (1999) and theformation time distribution of lacey &amp; cole (1993). we find that if selectioneffects are well-controlled and minimal external constraints are applied, theplanned deep redshift survey should allow the measurement of the cosmicequation-of-state parameter w to 10% (as little as 3% if omega_m has beenwell-determined from other observations). this type of test has the potentialalso to provide a constraint on any evolution of w such as that predicted by``tracker'' models.

0810.3235	inspiralling supermassive black holes: a new signpost for galaxy mergers	we present a new technique for observationally identifying galaxy mergersspectroscopically rather than through host galaxy imaging. our techniqueexploits the dynamics of supermassive black holes (smbhs) powering activegalactic nuclei (agns) in merger-remnant galaxies. because structure in theuniverse is built up through galaxy mergers and nearly all galaxies host acentral smbh, some galaxies should possess two smbhs near their centers as theresult of a recent merger. these smbhs spiral to the center of the resultantmerger-remnant galaxy, and one or both of the smbhs may power agns. using thedeep2 galaxy redshift survey, we have examined 1881 red galaxies, of which 91exhibit [o iii] and hbeta emission lines indicative of seyfert 2 activity. ofthese, 32 agns have [o iii] emission-line redshifts significantly differentfrom the redshifts of the host galaxies' stars, corresponding to velocityoffsets of ~50 km/s to ~300 km/s. two of these agns exhibit double-peaked [oiii] emission lines, while the remaining 30 agns each exhibit a single set ofvelocity-offset [o iii] emission lines. after exploring a variety of physicalmodels for these velocity offsets, we argue that the most likely explanation isinspiralling smbhs in merger-remnant galaxies. based on this interpretation, wefind that roughly half of the red galaxies hosting agns are also mergerremnants, which implies that mergers may trigger agn activity in red galaxies.the agn velocity offsets we find imply a merger fraction of ~30% and a mergerrate of ~3 mergers/gyr for red galaxies at redshifts 0.34 &lt; z &lt; 0.82.
