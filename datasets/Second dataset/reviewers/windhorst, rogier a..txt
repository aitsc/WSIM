0906.0985	improved photometric redshifts with surface luminosity priors	we apply bayesian statistics with prior probabilities of galaxy surfaceluminosity (sl) to improve photometric redshifts. we apply the method to asample of 1266 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the goods north andsouth fields at 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 2.0. we start with spectrophotometric redshifts(spzs) based on probing evolution and reionization spectroscopically grismspectra, which cover a wavelength range of 6000-9000a, combined with(u)bviz(jhk) broadband photometry in the goods fields. the accuracy of spzredshifts is estimated to be \sigma (\delta(z))=0.035 with an systematic offsetof -0.026, where \delta(z)=\delta z / (1+z), for galaxies in redshift range of0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.25. the addition of the sl prior probability helps break thedegeneracy of spz redshifts between low redshift 4000 a break galaxies andhigh-redshift lyman break galaxies which are mostly catastrophic outliers. forthe 1138 galaxies at z &lt; 1.6, the fraction of galaxies with redshift deviation\delta (z) &gt; 0.2 is reduced from 15.0% to 10.4%, while the rms scatter of thefractional redshift error does not change much.

0907.2201	the disappearance of lyman alpha blobs: a galex search at z=0.8	lyman alpha blobs - luminous, spatially extended emission-line nebulae, oftenlacking bright continuum counterparts - are common in dense environments athigh redshift. until recently, atmospheric absorption and filter technologyhave limited our knowledge of any similar objects at z&lt;2. we use galex slitlessspectroscopy to search for similar objects in the rich environments of twoknown cluster and supercluster fields at z=0.8, where the instrumentalsensitivity peaks. the regions around cl 1054-0321 and cl 0023+0423 were eachobserved in slitless-spectrum mode for 10-19 ksec, with accompanying directimages of 3-6 ksec to assist in recognizing continuum sources. using severaldetection techniques, we find no resolved lyman alpha emitters to a flux limitof(1.5-9) x 10^{-15} erg/ cm^2 s, on size scales of 5-30 arcseconds. thiscorresponds to line luminosities of (0.5-3) x 10^43 erg/s for linear scales35-200 kpc. comparison with both blind and targeted surveys at higher redshiftsindicates that the population must have evolved in comoving density at least asstrongly as (1+z)^3. these results suggest that the population of lyman alphablobs is specific to the the high-redshift universe.

1007.0784	the young stellar population of the nearby late-type galaxy ngc 1311	we have extracted psf-fitted stellar photometry from near-ultraviolet,optical and near-infrared images, obtained with the hubble space telescope, ofthe nearby (d ~ 5.5 mpc) sbm galaxy ngc 1311. the ultraviolet and optical datareveal a population of hot main sequence stars with ages of 2-10 myr. we alsofind populations of blue supergiants with ages between 10 and 40 myr and redsupergiants with ages between 10 and 100 myr. our near-infrared data showsevidence of star formation going back ~1 gyr, in agreement with previous work.fits to isochrones indicate a metallicity of z ~ 0.004. the ratio of blue tored supergiants is consistent with this metallicity. this indicates that ngc1311 follows the well-known luminosity-metallicity relation for late-type dwarfgalaxies. about half of the hot main sequence stars and blue supergiants arefound in two regions in the inner part of ngc 1311. these two regions are eachabout 200 pc across, and thus have crossing times roughly equal to the 10 myrage we find for the dominant young population. the luminosity functions of thesupergiants indicate a slowly rising star formation rate (of 0.001 solar massesper year) from ~100 myr ago until ~15 myr ago, followed by a strong enhancement(to 0.01 solar masses per year) at ~10 myr ago. we see no compelling evidencefor gaps in the star-forming history of ngc 1311 over the last 100 myr, and,with lower significance, none over the last gyr. this argues against a burstingmode, and in favor of a gasping or breathing mode for the recent star-formationhistory.

1007.5237	the luminosity, mass, and age distributions of compact star clusters in  m83 based on hst/wfc3 observations	the newly installed wide field camera 3 (wfc3) on the hubble space telescopehas been used to obtain multi-band images of the nearby spiral galaxy m83.these new observations are the deepest and highest resolution images ever takenof a grand-design spiral, particularly in the near ultraviolet, and allow us tobetter differentiate compact star clusters from individual stars and to measurethe luminosities of even faint clusters in the u band. we find that theluminosity function for clusters outside of the very crowded starburst nucleuscan be approximated by a power law, dn/dl \propto l^{alpha}, with alpha = -2.04+/- 0.08, down to m_v ~ -5.5. we test the sensitivity of the luminosityfunction to different selection techniques, filters, binning, and aperturecorrection determinations, and find that none of these contribute significantlyto uncertainties in alpha. we estimate ages and masses for the clusters bycomparing their measured ubvi,halpha colors with predictions from singlestellar population models. the age distribution of the clusters can beapproximated by a power-law, dn/dt propto t^{gamma}, with gamma=-0.9 +/- 0.2,for m &gt; few x 10^3 msun and t &lt; 4x10^8 yr. this indicates that clusters aredisrupted quickly, with ~80-90% disrupted each decade in age over this time.the mass function of clusters over the same m-t range is a power law, dn/dmpropto m^{beta}, with beta=-1.94 +/- 0.16, and does not have bends or showcurvature at either high or low masses. therefore, we do not find evidence fora physical upper mass limit, m_c, or for the earlier disruption of lower massclusters when compared with higher mass clusters, i.e. mass-dependentdisruption. we briefly discuss these implications for the formation anddisruption of the clusters.

1011.5504	anatomy of a post-starburst minor merger: a multi-wavelength wfc3 study  of ngc 4150	(abridged) we present a spatially-resolved near-uv/optical study of ngc 4150,using the wide field camera 3 (wfc3) on board the hubble space telescope.previous studies of this early-type galaxy (etg) indicate that it has a largereservoir of molecular gas, exhibits a kinematically decoupled core (likelyindication of recent merging) and strong, central h_b absorption (indicative ofyoung stars). the core of ngc 4150 shows ubiquitous near-uv emission andremarkable dusty substructure. our analysis shows this galaxy to lie in thenear-uv green valley, and its pixel-by-pixel photometry exhibits a narrow rangeof near-uv/optical colours that are similar to those of nearby e+a(post-starburst) galaxies. we parametrise the properties of the recent starformation (age, mass fraction, metallicity and internal dust content) in thengc 4150 pixels by comparing the observed near-uv/optical photometry to stellarmodels. the typical age of the recent star formation (rsf) is around 0.9 gyrs,consistent with the similarity of the near-uv colours to post-starburstsystems, while the morphological structure of the young component supports theproposed merger scenario. the rsf metallicity, representative of themetallicity of the gas fuelling star formation, is around 0.3 - 0.5 zsun.assuming that this galaxy is a merger and that the gas is sourced mainly fromthe infalling companion, these metallicities plausibly indicate the gas-phasemetallicity (gpm) of the accreted satellite. comparison to the local mass-gpmrelation suggests (crudely) that the mass of the accreted system is around3x10^8 msun, making ngc 4150 a 1:20 minor merger. a summation of the pixel rsfmass fractions indicates that the rsf contributes about 2-3 percent of thestellar mass. this work reaffirms our hypothesis that minor mergers play asignificant role in the evolution of etgs at late epochs.

1101.2291	a distortion of very--high--redshift galaxy number counts by  gravitational lensing	the observed number counts of high-redshift galaxy candidates have been usedto build up a statistical description of star-forming activity at redshift z &gt;~7, when galaxies reionized the universe. standard models predict that a highincidence of gravitational lensing will probably distort measurements of fluxand number of these earliest galaxies. the raw probability of this happeninghas been estimated to be ~ 0.5 percent, but can be larger owing toobservational biases. here we report that gravitational lensing is likely todominate the observed properties of galaxies with redshifts of z &gt;~ 12, whenthe instrumental limiting magnitude is expected to be brighter than thecharacteristic magnitude of the galaxy sample. the number counts could bemodified by an order of magnitude, with most galaxies being part of multiplyimaged systems, located less than 1 arcsec from brighter foreground galaxies atz ~ 2. this lens-induced association of high-redshift and foreground galaxieshas perhaps already been observed among a sample of galaxy candidatesidentified at z ~ 10.6. future surveys will need to be designed to account fora significant gravitational lensing bias in high-redshift galaxy samples.

1101.4521	detection of brown dwarf-like objects in the core of ngc3603	we use near-infrared data obtained with the wide field camera 3 (wfc3) on thehubble space telescope to identify objects having the colors of brown dwarfs(bds) in the field of the massive galactic cluster ngc 3603. these areidentified through use of a combination of narrow and medium band filtersspanning the j and h bands, and which are particularly sensitive to thepresence of the 1.3-1.5{\mu}m h2o molecular band - unique to bds. we provide acalibration of the relationship between effective temperature and color forboth field stars and for bds. this photometric method provides effectivetemperatures for bds to an accuracy of {\pm}350k relative to spectroscopictechniques. this accuracy is shown to be not significantly affected by eitherstellar surface gravity or uncertainties in the interstellar extinction. weidentify nine objects having effective temperature between 1700 and 2200 k,typical of bds, observed j-band magnitudes in the range 19.5-21.5, and that arestrongly clustered towards the luminous core of ngc 3603. however, if these arelocated at the distance of the cluster, they are far too luminous to be normalbds. we argue that it is unlikely that these objects are either artifacts ofour dataset, normal field bds/m-type giants or extra-galactic contaminants and,therefore, might represent a new class of stars having the effectivetemperatures of bds but with luminosities of more massive stars. we explore theinteresting scenario in which these objects would be normal stars that haverecently tidally ingested a hot jupiter, the remnants of which are providing ashort-lived extended photosphere to the central star. in this case, we wouldexpect them to show the signature of fast rotation.

1102.2444	large-scale shock-ionized and photo-ionized gas in m83: the impact of  star formation	we investigate the ionization structure of the nebular gas in m83 using theline diagnostic diagram, [o iii](5007 \dega)/h{\beta} vs. [s ii](6716 \dega+6731 \deg a)/h{\alpha} with the newly available narrowband images from thewide field camera 3 (wfc3) of the hubble space telescope (hst). we produce thediagnostic diagram on a pixel-by-pixel (0.2" x 0.2") basis and compare it withseveral photo- and shock-ionization models. for the photo-ionized gas, weobserve a gradual increase of the log([o iii]/h{\beta}) ratios from the centerto the spiral arm, consistent with the metallicity gradient, as the h iiregions go from super solar abundance to roughly solar abundance from thecenter out. using the diagnostic diagram, we separate the photo-ionized fromthe shock-ionized component of the gas. we find that the shock-ionizedh{\alpha} emission ranges from ~2% to about 15-33% of the total, depending onthe separation criteria used. an interesting feature in the diagnostic diagramis an horizontal distribution around log([o iii]/h{\beta}) ~ 0. this feature iswell fit by a shock-ionization model with 2.0 z\odot metallicity and shockvelocities in the range of 250 km/s to 350 km/s. a low velocity shockcomponent, &lt; 200 km/s, is also detected, and is spatially located at theboundary between the outer ring and the spiral arm. the low velocity shockcomponent can be due to : 1) supernova remnants located nearby, 2) dynamicalinteraction between the outer ring and the spiral arm, 3) abnormal line ratiosfrom extreme local dust extinction. the current data do not enable us todistinguish among those three possible interpretations. our main conclusion isthat, even at the hst resolution, the shocked gas represents a small fractionof the total ionized gas emission at less than 33% of the total. however, itaccounts for virtually all of the mechanical energy produced by the centralstarburst in m83.

1103.4026	using h-alpha morphology and surface brightness fluctuations to age-date  star clusters in m83	we use new wfc3 observations of the nearby grand design spiral galaxy m83 todevelop two independent methods for estimating the ages of young star clusters.the first method uses the physical extent and morphology of halpha emission toestimate the ages of clusters younger than tau ~10 myr. it is based on thesimple premise that the gas in very young (tau &lt; few myr) clusters is largelycoincident with the cluster stars, is in a small, ring-like structuresurrounding the stars in slightly older clusters (e.g., tau ~5 myr), and is ina larger ring-like bubble for still older clusters (i.e., ~5-10 myr). thesecond method is based on an observed relation between pixel-to-pixel fluxvariations within clusters and their ages. this method relies on the fact thatthe brightest individual stars in a cluster are most prominent at ages around10 myr, and fall below the detection limit (i.e., m_v &lt; -3.5) for ages olderthan about 100 myr. these two methods are the basis for a new morphologicalclassification system which can be used to estimate the ages of star clustersbased on their appearance. we compare previous age estimates of clusters in m83determined from fitting ubvi halpha measurements using predictions from stellarevolutionary models with our new morphological categories and find goodagreement at the ~95% level. the scatter within categories is ~0.1 dex in logtau for young clusters (&lt;10 myr) and ~0.5 dex for older (&gt;10 myr) clusters. aby-product of this study is the identification of 22 "single-star" hii regionsin m83, with central stars having ages ~4 myr.

astro-ph;0312572	the major sources of the cosmic reionizing background at z ~ 6	in this paper, we address which sources contributed most of the reionizingphotons. our argument assumes that the reionization ended around z ~ 6 and thatit was a relatively quick process, i.e., that there was a non-negligiblefraction of neutral hydrogen in the universe at somewhat earlier epochs.starting from our earlier estimate of the luminosity function (lf) of galaxiesat z ~ 6, we quantitatively show that the major sources of reionization aremost likely galaxies with l &lt; l*. our approach allows us to put strongerconstraints to the lf of galaxies at z ~ 6. to have the universe completelyionized at this redshift, the faint-end slope of the lf should be steeper than$\alpha=-1.6$, which is the value measured at lower redshifts (z ~ 3), unlesseither the normalization (phi*) of the lf or the clumping factor of the ionizedhydrogen has been significantly underestimated. if phi* is actually lower thanwhat we assumed by a factor of two, a steep slope close to $\alpha=-2.0$ isrequired. our lf predicts a total of 50 -- 80 z ~ 6 galaxies in the hst ultradeep field (udf) to a depth of ab=28.4 mag, which can be used to constraintboth phi* and $\alpha$. we conclude that the least luminous galaxies existingat this redshift should reach as low as some critical luminosity in order toaccumulate the entire reionizing photon budget. on the other hand, theexistence of significant amounts of neutral hydrogen at slightly earlierepochs, e.g. z ~ 7, requires that the least luminous galaxies should not befainter than another critical value (i.e., the lf should cut-off at thispoint).

astro-ph;0507493	hubble space telescope imaging of the ultracompact blue dwarf galaxy hs  0822+3542: an assembling galaxy in a local void?	we present deep u, narrow-v, and i-band images of the ultracompact blue dwarfgalaxy hs 0822+3542, obtained with the advanced camera for surveys / highresolution channel of the hubble space telescope. this object is extremelymetal-poor (12 + log(o/h) = 7.45) and resides in a nearby void. the imagesresolve it into two physically separate components that were previouslydescribed as star clusters in a single galaxy. the primary component is only\~100 pc in maximum extent, and consists of starburst region surrounded by aring-like structure of relatively redder stars. the secondary component is ~50pc in size and lies at a projected distance of ~80 pc away from the primary,and is also actively star-forming. we estimate masses ~10^7 m(sol) and ~10^6m(sol) for the two components, based on their luminosities, with an associateddynamical timescale for the system of a few myr. this timescale and thestructure of the components suggests that a collision between them triggeredtheir starbursts. the spectral energy distributions of both components can befitted by the combination of recent (few myr old) starburst and an evolved(several gyr old) underlying stellar population, similar to larger blue compactdwarf galaxies. this indicates that despite its metal deficiency the object isnot forming its first generation of stars. however, the small sizes and massesof the two components suggests that hs 0822+3542 represents a dwarf galaxy inthe process of assembling from clumps of stars intermediate in size betweenglobular clusters and objects previously classified as galaxies. its relativelyhigh ratio of neutral gas mass to stellar mass (~1) and high specific starformation rate, log(sfr/m(sol) = -9.2, suggests that it is still convertingmuch of its gas to stars.

astro-ph;0606175	the james webb space telescope	the james webb space telescope (jwst) is a large (6.6m), cold (50k),infrared-optimized space observatory that will be launched early in the nextdecade. the observatory will have four instruments: a near-infrared camera, anear-infrared multi-object spectrograph, and a tunable filter imager will coverthe wavelength range, 0.6 to 5.0 microns, while the mid-infrared instrumentwill do both imaging and spectroscopy from 5.0 to 29 microns. the jwst sciencegoals are divided into four themes. the end of the dark ages: first light andreionization theme seeks to identify the first luminous sources to form and todetermine the ionization history of the early universe. the assembly ofgalaxies theme seeks to determine how galaxies and the dark matter, gas, stars,metals, morphological structures, and active nuclei within them evolved fromthe epoch of reionization to the present day. the birth of stars andprotoplanetary systems theme seeks to unravel the birth and early evolution ofstars, from infall on to dust-enshrouded protostars to the genesis of planetarysystems. the planetary systems and the origins of life theme seeks to determinethe physical and chemical properties of planetary systems including our own,and investigate the potential for the origins of life in those systems. toenable these observations, jwst consists of a telescope, an instrument package,a spacecraft and a sunshield. the telescope consists of 18 beryllium segments,some of which are deployed. the segments will be brought into optical alignmenton-orbit through a process of periodic wavefront sensing and control. the jwstoperations plan is based on that used for previous space observatories, and themajority of jwst observing time will be allocated to the internationalastronomical community through annual peer-reviewed proposal opportunities.

astro-ph;0607280	ultracompact blue dwarf galaxies: hubble space telescope imaging and  stellar population analysis	we present deep hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys / highresolution channel u, narrow-v, and i images of nine "ultracompact" blue dwarfgalaxies (ucbds) selected from the sloan digital sky survey. we define ucbds aslocal (z &lt; 0.01) star-forming galaxies having angular diameters &lt; 6" andphysical sizes &lt; 1 kpc. they are also among the most metal-poor galaxies known,and are found to reside within voids. both the hst images and the objects'optical spectra reveal that they are composites of young (~1 myr) populationsthat dominate their light, and older (~10 gyr) populations that dominate theirstellar masses, which we estimate to be ~10^7 - 10^8 msol. an intermediate-agepopulation is also indicated in most cases. the objects are not as dynamicallydisturbed as the prototype ucbd, pox 186, but the structure of several of themsuggests that their current starbursts have been triggered by thecollisions/mergers of smaller clumps of stars. in one case, hs 0822+3542, theacs/hrc images resolve the object into two small (~100 pc) components whichappear to have recently collided, supporting this interpretation. in six of theobjects much of their star formation is concentrated in young massive starclusters. the evidence that the galaxies consist mainly of ~10 gyr old starsestablishes that they are not protogalaxies; their low metallicities are morelikely to be the result of the escape of supernova ejecta, as opposed to youth.these results are consistent with recent galaxy formation simulations whichpredict that cosmic re-ionization at z ~ 6 significantly limited the subsequentstar formation of dwarf galaxies in voids due to the photo-evaporation ofbaryons from their cold dark matter halos (abridged).

astro-ph;9511123	the contribution of late-type/irregulars to the faint galaxy counts from  hst medium deep survey images	we present a complete morphologically classified sample of 144 faint fieldgalaxies from the hst medium deep survey with 20.0 &lt; i &lt;22.0 mag. we comparethe global properties of the ellipticals, early and late-type spirals, and finda non-negligible fraction (13/144) of compact blue [(v-i) &lt; 1.0 mag] systemswith $r^{1/4}$-profiles. we give the differential galaxy number counts forellipticals and early-type spirals independently, and find that the data areconsistent with no-evolution predictions based on conventional flat schechterluminosity functions (lf's) and a standard cosmology.  conversely, late-type/irregulars show a steeply rising differential numbercount with slope $(\frac{\delta log n}{\delta m}) = 0.64\pm 0.1$. no-evolutionmodels based on the loveday et al. (1992) and marzke et al. (1994b) {\it local}luminosity functions under-predict the late-type/irregular counts by 1.0 and0.5 dex, respectively, at i = 21.75 mag. examination of the irregulars aloneshows that $\sim 50$% appear inert and the remainder have multiple cores. ifthe inert galaxies represent a non-evolving late-type population, then aloveday-like lf ($\alpha\simeq -1.0$) is ruled out for these types, and a lfwith a steep faint-end ($\alpha\simeq -1.5$) is suggested. if multiple corestructure indicates recent star-formation, then the observed excess of faintblue field galaxies is likely due to {\it evolutionary} processes acting on a{\it steep} field lf for late-type/irregulars. the evolutionary mechanism isunclear, but 60% of the multiple-core irregulars show close companions. toreconcile a marzke-like lf with the faint redshift surveys, this evolution mustbe preferentially occurring in the brightest late-type galaxies with z &gt; 0.5 ati = 21.75 mag.

astro-ph;9511132	the morphological mix of field galaxies to i=24.25 magnitudes (b=26  magnitudes) from a deep hubble space telescope wfpc2 image	we determine the morphological mix of field galaxies down to $m_{i}\simeq24.25$ mag ($m_{b}\sim 26.0$ mag) from a single ultradeep hst wfpc2 image inboth the $v_{606}$ and $i_{814}$ filters. in total, we find 227 objects with$m_{i}\le 24.5$ mag and classify these into three types: ellipticals (16%),early-type spirals (37%) and late-type spirals/irregulars (47%). thedifferential number counts for each type are compared to simple models in astandard flat cosmology. we find that both the elliptical and early-type spiralnumber counts are well described by {\it little or no}-evolution models, butonly when normalized at $b_{j} = 18.0$ mag. given the uncertainties in theluminosity function (lf) normalization, both populations are consistent with amild evolutionary scenario based on a normal/low rate of star-formation. thisconstrains the end of the last {\it major} star-formation epoch in the giantgalaxy populations to $z\geq 0.8$.  conversely, the density of the observed late-type/irregular population isfound to be a factor of 10 in excess of the conventional no-evolution model.this large population might be explained by either a modified {\it local}dwarf-rich lf, and/or strong evolution acting on the {\it local} lf. for thedwarf-rich case, a {\it steep} faint-end schechter-slope ($\alpha\simeq -1.8$)is required plus a five-fold increase in the dwarf normalization. for a purelyevolving model based on a {\it flat} loveday {\it et al.} (1992) lf($\alpha\simeq -1.0$), a ubiquitous starburst of $\delta i\sim$2.0 mag isneeded at z$\simeq 0.5$ for the {\it entire} late-type population. we argue fora combination of these possibilities, and show that for a steep marzke {\it etal.} (1994) lf ($\alpha\simeq -1.5$), a starburst of $\sim$ 1.3 mag is required

astro-ph;9511141	hubble space telescope counts of elliptical galaxies: constraints on  cosmological models ?	the interpretation of galaxy number counts in terms of cosmological models isfraught with difficulty due to uncertainties in the overall galaxy population(mix of morphological types, luminosity functions etc.) and in the observations(loss of low surface brightness images, image blending etc.). many of these canbe overcome if we use deep high resolution imaging of a single class of highsurface brightness galaxies, whose evolution is thought to be fairly wellunderstood. this is now possible by selecting elliptical and s0 galaxies usinghubble space telescope images from the medium deep survey and other ultradeepwfpc2 images. in the present paper, we examine whether such data can be used todiscriminate between open and closed universes, or between conventionalcosmological models and those dominated by a cosmological constant. we find,based on the currently available data, that unless elliptical galaxies undergovery strong merging since $z \sim 1$ (and/or very large errors exist in themorphological classifications), then flat models dominated by a cosmologicalconstant are ruled out. however, both an einstein-de sitter ($\omega_{0}=1$)model with standard passive stellar evolution and an open ($\omega_{0}=0.05$)model with no net evolution ({\it i.e.} cancelling stellar and dynamicalevolution) predict virtually identical elliptical and s0 galaxy counts.  based on these findings and the recent reportings of $h_{o} \simeq 80$ km/smpc/s, we find that the maximum acceptable age of the universe is 13.3 gyrs anda value of $\leq 9$ gyrs favored. a flat---$\lambda \neq 0$---universe istherefore {\it not} a viable solution to the $h_{o}$/globular cluster ageproblem.

astro-ph;9605048	the inferred redshift distribution of the faint blue excess	we infer the redshift distribution of the faint blue galaxy excess (fbe) atb=23.5 by subtracting the predicted distribution of giant/normal galaxies fromthe observed n(z) distribution for all types. this is possible because of therecent deep {\it hubble space telescope} (hst) wfpc2 morphological numbercounts which have convincingly demonstrated that little evolution of the giantpopulation is seen to b=26.0. the mean redshift of the fbe at b=23.5 is foundto be &lt;z&gt;_{fbe}=0.40 +/- 0.07 with upper and lower quartiles defined byz_{0.75}=0.58 +/- 0.05 and z_{0.25}=0.28 +/- 0.05, respectively.  we compare this inferred fbe n(z) distribution to the predictions from threegeneric faint galaxy models: dwarf dominated (no evolution), pure luminosityevolution, and evolving dwarfs. the inferred fbe n(z) distribution stronglysupports a hybrid evolving dwarf--rich model wherein a large population ofdwarfs present at z=0.5 has subsequently faded to obscurity. the totalintegrated number density of dwarfs (down to m_{b}=-11) is estimated to be afactor of 20 times greater than that of e---sc galaxies and the estimatedfading to be 1.0 &lt; \delta m &lt; 1.4 mags. thus, the dwarf population is estimatedto be responsible for ~30% of the luminosity density locally, rising to ~57% atz=0.5.

(b-i) color maps may suggest a narrow dust lane crossing betweenthe nucleus and the smaller blue cloud. the radio source is not smaller thanthe distance between the blue continuum clouds, and coincides with a bright lya''arc'' in the western cloud, suggesting that jet-induced star-formation couldcause both blue clouds, except the outer parts of the western cloud. the shapeof this larger blue cloud suggests reflected agn continuum-light shiningthrough a cone (plus re-radiated lya in emission). the ovro interferometricco-detection (scoville et al. 1997) on both sides of 53w002 - and in the samedirection as the continuum clouds and the radio jet - also suggest astar-bursting region induced by its radio jet, at least in the inner parts.even at radio powers ~1.5 dex fainter than the 3cr sources, we thus find manyof the same aligned features and complex morphology, although at much smallerangular scales and lower optical-uv luminosities. we discuss the consequencesfor 53w002's formation in the context of the 16 sub-galactic objects at z~2.40around 53w002 (pascarelle et al. 1996).

astro-ph;9806395	ring structure and warp of ngc5907 -- interaction with dwarf galaxies	the edge-on, nearby spiral galaxy ngc5907 has long been used as the prototypeof a ``non-interacting'' warped galaxy. we report here the discovery of twointeractions with companion dwarf galaxies that substantially change thispicture. first, a faint ring structure is discovered around this galaxy that islikely due to the tidal disruption of a companion dwarf spheroidal galaxy. thering is elliptical in shape with the center of ngc5907 close to one of thering's foci. this suggests the ring material is in orbit around ngc5907. nogaseous component to the ring has been detected either with deep h$\alpha$images or in very large array (vla) hi 21-cm line maps. the visible material inthe ring has an integrated luminosity &lt;= 10^8 l_sun and its brightest part hasa color r-i ~ 0.9. all of these properties are consistent with the ring being atidally-disrupted dwarf spheroidal galaxy. second, we find that ngc5907 has adwarf companion galaxy, pgc54419, projected to be only 36.9 kpc from the centerof ngc5907, close in radial velocity (\delta v = 45 km s^{-1}) to the giantspiral galaxy. this dwarf is seen at the tip of the hi warp and in thedirection of the warp. hence, ngc5907 can no longer be considered``non-interacting,'' but is obviously interacting with its dwarf companionsmuch as the milky way interacts with its dwarf galaxies. these results, coupledwith the finding by others that dwarf galaxies tend to be found around giantgalaxies, suggest that tidal interaction with companions, even if containing amere 1% of the mass of the parent galaxy, might be sufficient to excite thewarps found in the disks of many large spiral galaxies.
