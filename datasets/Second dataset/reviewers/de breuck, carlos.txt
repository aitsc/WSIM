0902.4464	a submillimetre galaxy at z=4.76 in the laboca survey of the extended  chandra deep field south	we report on the identification of the highest redshift submm-selected sourcecurrently known: lessj033229.4-275619. this source was detected in the largeapex bolometer camera (laboca) extended chandra deep field south (ecdfs)submillimetre survey (less), a sensitive 870-um survey (~1.2-mjy rms) of thefull 30'x30' ecdfs with the laboca camera on the atacama pathfinder experiment(apex) telescope. the submm emission is identified with a radio counterpart forwhich optical spectroscopy provides a redshift of z=4.76. we show that thebolometric emission is dominated by a starburst with a star formation rate of~1000 msun/yr, although we also identify a moderate luminosity active galacticnucleus (agn) in this galaxy. thus it has characteristics similar to those ofz~2 submm galaxies (smgs), with a mix of starburst and obscured agn signatures.this demonstrates that ultraluminous starburst activity is not just restrictedto the hosts of the most luminous (and hence rare) qsos at z~5, but was alsooccurring in less extreme galaxies at a time when the universe was less than10% of its current age. assuming that we are seeing the major phase of starformation in this galaxy, then we demonstrate that it would be identified as aluminous distant red galaxy at z~3 and that the current estimate of the spacedensity of z&gt;4 smgs is only sufficient to produce ~10% of the luminous redgalaxy population at these early times. however, this leaves open thepossibility that some of these galaxies formed through less intense, but moreextended star formation events. if the progenitors of all of the luminous redgalaxies at z~3 go through an ultraluminous starburst at z&gt;4 then the requiredvolume density of z&gt;4 smgs will exceed that predicted by current galaxyformation models by more than an order of magnitude.

0908.4106	large scale structures around radio galaxies at z~1.5	we explore the environments of two radio galaxies at z~1.5, 7c1751+6809 and7c1756+6520, using deep optical and near-infrared imaging. our data cover15'x15' fields around the radio galaxies. we develop and apply bzk colorcriteria to select cluster member candidates around the radio galaxies and findno evidence of an overdensity of red galaxies within 2mpc of 7c1751+6809. incontrast, 7c1756+6520 shows a significant overdensity of red galaxies within2mpc of the radio galaxy, by a factor of 3.1 +/- 0.8 relative to the four musycfields. at small separation (r&lt;6''), this radio galaxy also has one z~1.4evolved galaxy candidate, one z~1.4 star-forming galaxy candidate, and an agncandidate (at indeterminate redshift). this is suggestive of several close-bycompanions. several concentrations of red galaxies are also noticed in the full7c1756+6520 field, forming a possible large-scale structure of evolved galaxieswith a nw-se orientation. we construct the color-magnitude diagram of redgalaxies found near (r&lt;2mpc) 7c1756+6520, and find a clear red sequence that istruncated at ks~21.5 (ab). we also find an overdensity of mid-ir selected agnin the surroundings of 7c1756+6520. these results are suggestive of aproto-cluster at high redshift.

0911.1717	optical and near-ir spectroscopy of candidate red galaxies in two z~2.5  proto-clusters	we present a spectroscopic campaign to follow-up red colour-selectedcandidate massive galaxies in two high redshift proto-clusters surroundingradio galaxies. we observed a total of 57 galaxies in the field of mrc0943-242(z=2.93) and 33 in the field of pks1138-262 (z=2.16) with a mix of optical andnear-infrared multi-object spectroscopy.  we confirm two red galaxies in the field of pks1138-262 at the redshift ofthe radio galaxy. based on an analysis of their spectral energy distributions,and their derived star formation rates from the h-alpha and 24um flux, oneobject belongs to the class of dust-obscured star-forming red galaxies, whilethe other is evolved with little ongoing star formation. this result representsthe first red and mainly passively evolving galaxy to be confirmed as companiongalaxies in a z&gt;2 proto-cluster. both red galaxies in pks1138-262 are massive,of the order of 4-6x10^11 m_sol. they lie along a colour-magnitude relationwhich implies that they formed the bulk of their stellar population around z=4.  in the mrc0943-242 field we find no red galaxies at the redshift of the radiogalaxy but we do confirm the effectiveness of our jhk_s selection of galaxiesat 2.3&lt;z&lt;3.1, finding that 10 out of 18 (56%) of jhk_s-selected galaxies whoseredshifts could be measured fall within this redshift range. we alsoserendipitously identify an interesting foreground structure of 6 galaxies atz=2.6 in the field of mrc0943-242. this may be a proto-cluster itself, butcomplicates any interpretation of the red sequence build-up in mrc0943-242until more redshifts can be measured.

1003.3674	intense star formation within resolved compact regions in a galaxy at  z=2.3	massive galaxies in the early universe have been shown to be forming stars atsurprisingly high rates. prominent examples are dust-obscured galaxies whichare luminous when observed at sub-millimeter (sub-mm) wavelengths and which maybe forming stars at rates upto 1,000mo/yr. these intense bursts of starformation are believed to be driven by mergers between gas rich galaxies.however, probing the properties of individual star-forming regions within thesegalaxies is beyond the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the largesttelescopes at present. here, we report observations of the sub-mm galaxysmmj2135-0102 at redshift z=2.3259 which has been gravitationally magnified bya factor of 32 by a massive foreground galaxy cluster lens. this cosmicmagnification, when combined with high-resolution sub-mm imaging, resolves thestar-forming regions at a linear scale of just ~100 parsecs. we find that theluminosity densities of these star-forming regions are comparable to the densecores of giant molecular clouds in the local universe, but they are ~100xlarger and 10^7 times more luminous. although vigorously star-forming, theunderlying physics of the star formation processes at z~2 appears to be similarto that seen in local galaxies even though the energetics are unlike anythingfound in the present-day universe.

1004.3021	spectroscopic confirmation of a galaxy cluster associated with  7c1756+6520 at z=1.416	we present spectroscopic follow-up of an overdensity of galaxiesphotometrically selected to be at 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5 found in the vicinity of the radiogalaxy 7c1756+6520 at z=1.4156. using the deimos optical multi-objectspectrograph on the keck 2 telescope, we observed a total of 129 bzk-selectedsources, comprising 82 blue, star-forming galaxy candidates (sbzk) and 47 red,passively-evolving galaxy candidates (pbzk*), as well as 11 mid-infraredselected agn candidates. we obtain robust spectroscopic redshifts for 36 bluegalaxies, 7 red galaxies and 9 agn candidates. assuming all foregroundinterlopers were identified, we find that only 16% (9%) of the sbzk (pbzk*)galaxies are at z&lt;1.4. therefore, the bzk criteria are shown to be relativelyrobust at identifying galaxies at moderate redshifts. twenty-one galaxies,including the radio galaxy, four additional agn candidates and three red galaxycandidates are found with 1.4156 +/- 0.025, forming a large scale structure atthe redshift of the radio galaxy. of these, eight have projected offsets &lt;2mpcrelative to the radio galaxy position and have velocity offsets &lt;1000km/srelative to the radio galaxy redshift. this confirms that 7c1756+6520 isassociated with a high-redshift galaxy cluster. a second compact group of fourgalaxies is found at z~1.437, forming a sub-group offset by dv~3000km/s andapproximately 1.5' east of the radio galaxy.

1004.4001	detection of molecular gas in a distant submillimetre galaxy at z=4.76  with atca	we have detected the co(2-1) transition from the submillimetre galaxy (smg)lessj033229.4-275619 at z=4.755 using the new compact array broadband backendsystem on the australian telescope compact array. these data have identified amassive gas reservoir available for star formation for the first time in an smgat z~5. we use the luminosity and velocity width (fwhm of 160 km/s) of theco(2--1) line emission to constrain the gas and dynamical mass ofmgas~1.6x10^10 msun and mdyn(&lt;2kpc)~5x10^10 (0.25/sin^2(i)) msun, respectively,similar to that observed for smgs at lower redshifts of z~2-4, although we notethat our observed co fwhm is a factor of ~3 narrower than typically seen insmgs. together with the stellar mass we estimate a total baryonic mass ofmbary~1x10^11 msun, consistent with the dynamical mass for this young galaxywithin the uncertainties. dynamical and baryonic mass limits of high-redshiftgalaxies are useful tests of galaxy formation models: using the known z~4-5smgs as examples of massive baryonic systems, we find that their space densityis consistent with that predicted by current galaxy formation models. inaddition, these observations have helped to confirm that z~4-5 smgs possess thebaryonic masses and gas consumption timescales necessary to be the progenitorsof the luminous old red galaxies seen at z~3. our results provide a preview ofthe science that alma will enable on the formation and evolution of theearliest massive galaxies in the universe.

1005.2253	the environmental dependence of galaxy properties at z=2	we report on the environmental dependence of galaxy properties at z=2.15. weconstruct multi-band photometric data sets in the (proto-)cluster pks1138-26field and in the goods field. we then fit spectral energy distributions of thegalaxies with model templates generated with the latest stellar populationsynthesis code and derive physical properties of galaxies from the fits. toquantify the environmental dependence of galaxy properties, a special care istaken of systematic errors -- we use data sets that have almost the samewavelength samplings, use the same code to fit seds with the same set oftemplates, and compare relative differences between the two samples. we findthat the pks1138 galaxies have similar ages, shorter star formation timescales, lower star formation rates, and weaker dust extinction compared to thegoods galaxies at z~2. this trend is similar to that observed locally,suggesting that the environmental dependence of galaxy properties is alreadypartly in place as early as z=2.15. we show that the pks1138 galaxies assemblethe bulk of their masses ~1 gyr earlier than field galaxies, i.e., the galaxyformation depends on environment. galaxy mergers should frequently occur duringthe first collapse of clusters and they might play an important role in drivingthe observed environmental dependence of galaxy properties at z=2.15.

1008.1094	galaxy protocluster candidates at 1.6&lt;z&lt;2	we present a study of protoclusters associated with high redshift radiogalaxies. we imaged mrc1017-220 (z=1.77) and mrc0156-252 (z=2.02) using thenear-infrared wide-field (7.5'x7.5') imager vlt/hawk-i in the y, h and ksbands. we present the first deep y-band galaxy number counts within a largearea (200 arcmin2). we then develop a purely near-infrared colour selectiontechnique to isolate galaxies at 1.6&lt;z&lt;3 that may be associated with the twotargets, dividing them into (i) red passively evolving or dusty star-forminggalaxies or (ii) blue/star-formation dominated galaxies with little or no dust.both targeted fields show an excess of star-forming galaxies with respect tocontrol fields. no clear overdensity of red galaxies is detected in thesurroundings of mrc1017-220 although the spatial distribution of the redgalaxies resembles a filament-like structure within which the radio galaxy isembedded. in contrast, a significant overdensity of red galaxies is detected inthe field of mrc0156-252, ranging from a factor of 2-3 times the field densityat large scales (2.5mpc, angular distance) up to a factor of 3-4 times thefield density within a 1mpc radius of the radio galaxy. half of these redgalaxies have colours consistent with red sequence models at z~2, with a largefraction being bright (ks&lt;21.5, i.e. massive). in addition, we also find asmall group of galaxies within 5" of mrc0156-252 suggesting that the radiogalaxy has multiple companions within ~50 kpc. we conclude that the field ofmrc0156-252 shows many remarkable similarities with the well-studiedprotocluster surrounding pks1138-262 (z=2.16) suggesting that mrc0156-252 isassociated with a galaxy protocluster at z~2.

1010.1385	the spitzer high redshift radio galaxy survey	we present results from a comprehensive imaging survey of 70 radio galaxiesat redshifts 1&lt;z&lt;5.2 using all three cameras onboard the spitzer spacetelescope. the resulting spectral energy distributions unambiguously show astellar population in 46 sources and hot dust emission associated with theactive nucleus in 59. using a new restframe s_3um/s_1.6um versus s_um/s_3umcriterion, we identify 42 sources where the restframe 1.6um emission from thestellar population can be measured. for these radio galaxies, the medianstellar mass is high, 2x10^11 m_sun, and remarkably constant within the range1&lt;z&lt;3. at z&gt;3, there is tentative evidence for a factor of two decrease instellar mass. this suggests that radio galaxies have assembled the bulk oftheir stellar mass by z~3, but confirmation by more detailed decomposition ofstellar and agn emission is needed.  the restframe 500 mhz radio luminosities are only marginally correlated withstellar mass but are strongly correlated with the restframe 5um hot dustluminosity. this suggests that the radio galaxies have a large range ofeddington ratios. we also present new very large array 4.86 and 8.46 ghzimaging of 14 radio galaxies and find that radio core dominance --- anindicator of jet orientation --- is strongly correlated with hot dustluminosity. while all of our targets were selected as narrow-lined, type 2agns, this result can be understood in the context of orientation-dependentmodels if there is a continuous distribution of orientations from obscured type2 to unobscured type 1 agns rather than a clear dichotomy. finally, four radiogalaxies have nearby (&lt;6") companions whose mid-ir colors are suggestive oftheir being agns. this may indicate an association between radio galaxyactivity and major mergers.

1011.4158	the black holes of radio galaxies during the "quasar era": masses,  accretion rates, and evolutionary stage	we present an analysis of the agn broad-line regions of 6 powerful radiogalaxies at z&gt;~2 (hzrgs) with rest-frame optical imaging spectroscopy obtainedat the vlt. all galaxies have luminous (l(h-alpha)=few x 10^44 erg s^-1),spatially unresolved h-alpha line emission with fwhm&gt;= 10,000 km s^-1 at theposition of the nucleus, suggesting their agn are powered by supermassive blackholes with masses of few x 10^9 m_sun and accretion luminosities of a fewpercent of the eddington luminosity. in two galaxies we also detect the blrs inh-beta, suggesting relatively low extinction of a_v~1 mag, which agrees withconstraints from x-ray observations. by relating black hole and bulge mass, wefind a possible offset towards higher black-hole masses of at most ~0.6 dexrelative to nearby galaxies at a given host mass, although each individualgalaxy is within the scatter of the local relationship. if not entirely fromsystematic effects, this would then suggest that the masses of the hostgalaxies have increased by at most a factor ~4 since z~2 relative to theblack-hole masses, perhaps through accretion of satellite galaxies or becauseof a time lag between star formation in the host galaxy and agn fueling. wealso compare the radiative and mechanical energy output (from jets) of ourtargets with predictions of recent models of "synthesis" or "grand unified" agnfeedback, which postulate that agn with similar radiative and mechanical energyoutput rates to those found in our hzrgs may be nearing the end of their periodof active growth. we discuss evidence that they may reach this stage at thesame time as their host galaxies.

1012.1869	discovery of an excess of halpha emitters around 4c 23.56 at z=2.48	we report the discovery of a significant excess of candidate halpha emitters(haes) in the field of the radio galaxy 4c 23.56 at z=2.483. using the moircsnear-infrared imager on the subaru telescope we found 11 candidateemission-line galaxies to a flux limit of ~7.5 10^-17 erg s-1 cm-2, which isabout 5 times excess from the expected field counts with ~3-sigma significance.three of these are spectroscopically confirmed as redshifted halpha at z=2.49.the distribution of candidate emitters on the sky is tightly confined to a1.2-mpc-radius area at z=2.49, locating 4c 23.56 at the western edge of thedistribution. analysis of the deep spitzer mips 24 mu m imaging shows thatthere is also an excess of faint mips sources. all but two of the 11 haes arealso found in the mips data. the inferred star-formation rate (sfr) of the haesbased on the extinction-corrected halpha luminosity (median sfr &gt;~100 m_solaryr-1) is similar to those of haes in random fields at z~2. on the other hand,the mips-based sfr for the haes is on average 3.6 times larger, suggesting theexistence of the star-formation significanly obscured by dust. the comparisonof the halpha-based star-formation activities of the haes in the 4c 23.56 fieldto those in another proto-cluster around pks 1138-262 at z=2.16 reveals thatthe latter tend to have fainter halpha emission despite similar k-bandmagnitudes. this suggests that star-formation may be suppressed in the pks1138-262 protocluster relative to the 4c 23.56 protocluster. this differenceamong the haes in the two proto-clusters at z &gt; 2 may imply that some massivecluster galaxies are just forming at these epochs with some variation amongclusters.

1201.2916	reorienting our perspective of broad absorption line quasars	new multi-frequency radio observations of a large sample of radio-selectedbal quasars, along with a very well matched sample of normal quasars, arepresented. the observations were made one immediately after the other at 4.9and 8.4 ghz with the goal of measuring the radio spectral index of each source.we have identified, for the first time, a significant difference in thespectral index distributions of bal versus non-bal quasars, with bal sourcesshowing an overabundance of steep-spectrum sources. this is the first directobservation suggesting that bal quasars are more likely to be seen farther fromthe radio jet axis, although a range of orientations is needed to explain thewidth of the distribution. utilizing a few different relationships betweenspectral index and viewing angle, we have also performed monte-carlosimulations to quantify the viewing angle to these sources. we find that thedifference in the distributions of spectral index can be explained by allowingthe bal sources to have viewing angles extending about 10 degrees farther fromthe jet axis than non-bal quasars.

1203.4975	zooming in on supernova 1987a at sub-mm wavelengths	supernova 1987a (sn1987a) in the neighbouring large magellanic cloud offers asuperb opportunity to follow the evolution of a supernova and its remnant inunprecedented detail. recently, far-infrared (far-ir) and sub-mm emission wasdetected from the direction of sn1987a, which was interpreted as due to theemission from dust, possibly freshly synthesized in the sn ejecta. to betterconstrain the location and hence origin of the far-ir and sub-mm emission insn1987a, we have attempted to resolve the object in that part of theelectro-magnetic spectrum. we observed sn1987a during july-september 2011 withthe atacama pathfinder experiment (apex), at a wavelength of 350 micron withthe submillimetre apex bolometer camera (saboca) and at 870 micron with thelarge apex bolometer camera (laboca). the 350-micron image has superior angularresolution (8") over that of the herschel space observatory 350-micron image(25"). the 870-micron observation (at 20" resolution) is a repetition of asimilar observation made in 2007. in both images, at 350 and 870 micron,emission is detected from sn1987a, and the source is unresolved. the fluxdensities in the new (2011) measurements are consistent with those measuredbefore with herschel at 350 micron (in 2010) and with apex at 870 micron (in2007). a higher dust temperature (approximately 33 k) and lower dust mass mightbe possible than what was previously thought. the new measurements, at thehighest angular resolution achieved so far at far-ir and sub-mm wavelengths,strengthen the constraints on the location of the emission, which is thought tobe close to the site of sn1987a and its circumstellar ring structures. thesemeasurements set the stage for upcoming observations at even higher angularresolution with the atacama large millimeter array (alma).

1204.1375	the viewing angles of broad absorption line versus unabsorbed quasars	it was recently shown that there is a significant difference in the radiospectral index distributions of broad absorption line (bal) quasars andunabsorbed quasars, with an overabundance of bal quasars with steeper radiospectra. this result suggests that source orientation does play into thepresence or absence of bal features. in this paper we provide more quantitativeanalysis of this result based on monte-carlo simulations. while therelationship between viewing angle and spectral index does indeed contain a lotof scatter, the spectral index distributions are different enough to overcomethat intrinsic variation. utilizing two different models of the relationshipbetween spectral index and viewing angle, the simulations indicate that thedifference in spectral index distributions can be explained by allowing balquasar viewing angles to extend about 10 degrees farther from the radio jetaxis than non-bal sources, though both can be seen at small angles. theseresults show that orientation cannot be the only factor determining whether balfeatures are present, but it does play a role.

1205.4834	alma reveals a chemically evolved submillimeter galaxy at z=4.76	the chemical properties of high-z galaxies provide important information toconstrain galaxy evolutionary scenarios. however, widely-used metallicitydiagnostics based on rest-frame optical emission lines are not usable forheavily dust-enshrouded galaxies (such as sub-millimeter galaxies; smgs),especially at z&gt;3. here we focus on the flux ratio of the far-infraredfine-structure emission lines [nii]205um and [cii]158um to assess themetallicity of high-z smgs. through alma cycle 0 observations, we have detectedthe [nii]205um emission in a strongly [cii]-emitting smg, less j033229.4-275619at z=4.76. the velocity-integrated [nii]/[cii] flux ratio is 0.043 +/- 0.008.this is the first measurement of the [nii]/[cii] flux ratio in high-z galaxies,and the inferred flux ratio is similar to the ratio observed in the nearbyuniverse (~0.02-0.07). the velocity-integrated flux ratio and photoionizationmodels suggest that the metallicity in this smg is consistent with solar,implying the chemical evolution has progressed very rapidly in this system atz=4.76. we also obtain a tight upper limit on the co(12-11) transition, whichtranslates into co(12-11)/co(2-1) &lt;3.8 (3 sigma). this suggests that themolecular gas clouds in less j033229.4-275619 are not affected significantly bythe radiation field emitted by the agn in this system.

1209.1390	an alma survey of sub-millimetre galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: detection of [c ii] at z=4.4	we present alma 870-um (345ghz) observations of two sub-millimetre galaxies(smgs) drawn from an alma study of the 126 sub-millimeter sources from thelaboca extended chandra deep field south survey (less). the alma data identifythe counterparts to these previously unidentified sub-millimeter sources andserendipitously detect bright emission lines in their spectra which we show aremost likely to be [c ii]157.74um emission yielding redshifts of z=4.42 andz=4.44. this blind detection rate within the 7.5-ghz bandpass of alma isconsistent with the previously derived photometric redshift distribution ofsmgs and suggests a modest, but not dominant (&lt;25%), tail of 870-um selectedsmgs at z&gt;4. we find that the ratio of l_cii/l_fir in these smgs is much higherthan seen for similarly far-infrared-luminous galaxies at z~0, which isattributed to the more extended gas reservoirs in these high-redshift ulirgs.indeed, in one system we show that the [c ii] emission shows hints of extendedemission on &gt;3kpc scales. finally, we use the volume probed by our alma surveyto show that the bright end of the [c ii] luminosity function evolves stronglybetween z=0 and z~4.4, reflecting the increased ism cooling in galaxies as aresult of their higher star-formation rates. these observations demonstratethat even with short integrations, alma is able to detect the dominant finestructure cooling lines from high-redshift ulirgs, measure their energetics andtrace their evolution with redshift.

1210.0249	an alma survey of submillimetre galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: high resolution 870um source counts	we report the first counts of faint submillimetre galaxies (smg) in the870-um band derived from arcsecond resolution observations with the atacamalarge millimeter array (alma). we have used alma to map a sample of 122870-um-selected submillimetre sources drawn from the (0.5x0.5)deg^2 labocaextended chandra deep field south submillimetre survey (less). these alma mapshave an average depth of sigma(870um)~0.4mjy, some ~3x deeper than the originallaboca survey and critically the angular resolution is more than an order ofmagnitude higher, fwhm of ~1.5" compared to ~19" for the laboca discovery map.this combination of sensitivity and resolution allows us to precisely pin-pointthe smgs contributing to the submillimetre sources from the laboca map, freefrom the effects of confusion. we show that our alma-derived smg counts broadlyagree with the submillimetre source counts from previous, lower-resolutionsingle-dish surveys, demonstrating that the bulk of the submillimetre sourcesare not caused by blending of unresolved smgs. the difficulty whichwell-constrained theoretical models have in reproducing the high-surfacedensities of smgs, thus remains. however, our observations do show that all ofthe very brightest sources in the less sample, s(870um)&gt;12mjy, compriseemission from multiple, fainter smgs, each with 870-um fluxes of &lt;9mjy. thisimplies a natural limit to the star-formation rate in smgs of &lt;10^3 m_sun/yr,which in turn suggests that the space densities of z&gt;1 galaxies with gas massesin excess of ~5x10^10 m_sun is &lt;10^-5 mpc^-3. we also discuss the influence ofthis blending on the identification and characterisation of the smgcounterparts to these bright submillimetre sources and suggest that it may beresponsible for previous claims that they lie at higher redshifts than faintersmgs.

1211.2823	pah emission in powerful high-redshift radio galaxies	we present the mid-infrared spectra of seven of the most powerfulradio-galaxies known to exist at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.6. the radio emission of thesesources is dominated by the agn with 500 mhz luminosities in the range 10^27.8- 10^29.1 w/hz. the agn signature is clearly evident in the mid-infraredspectra, however, we also detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emission,indicative of prodigious star formation at a rate of up to ~1000 msun/yr.interestingly, we observe no significant correlation between agn power and starformation in the host galaxy. we also find most of these radio galaxies to haveweak 9.7 um silicate absorption features (tau_{9.7 um} &lt; 0.8) which impliesthat their mid-ir obscuration is predominantly due to the dusty torus thatsurrounds the central engine, rather than the host galaxy. the tori are likelyto have an inhomogeneous distribution with the obscuring structure consistingof individual clouds. we estimate that these radio galaxies have already formedthe bulk of their stellar mass and appear to lie at a stage in their evolutionwhere the obscured agn dominates the energy output of the system but starformation is also prevalent.

1301.1983	starburst and old stellar populations in two z=3.8 radio galaxies 4c  41.17 and tn j2007-1316	the new evolutionary code pegase.3 is used for the spectral synthesis ofcontinuous optical-spitzer-herschel-submm spectral energy distributions (seds)of two z=3.8 radio galaxies 4c 41.17 and tn j2007-1316. both galaxies areselected from the herschel radio galaxy evolution project for their faint agncontribution and because they show evidence of a large stellar contribution totheir bolometric luminosity. pegase.3 coherently models the reprocessing of thestellar luminosity to dust emission, allowing to build uv to ir-submm librariesby types. these templates allow to predict seds at redshifts z in theobserver's frame by using z=0 templates corrected for cosmology and evolution.our best fits are a sum of two distinct evolving stellar populations: i) a verymassive starburst observed ~30 myrs after formation from optical and far-irpeaks ii) a significantly older (~1gyr old) massive early-type populationrevealed from mid-ir spitzer data. the agn emission fits a roughly thermalmodel. these results confirm that many of the stellar populations in high-zradio galaxies were already formed by massive (a few thousands of billion solarmasses) starbursts at z=4, confirming the previous k-z diagram interpretation.gas-rich mergers and/or jet-cloud interactions are favored for triggering theintense star formation, possibly in relation with massive super black holes ofthese radio galaxies. these multiple stellar populations may be a genericfeature of the luminous infrared radio galaxy population as a whole andstrongly constrain mass accumulation and galaxy formation models.

1306.4406	on the formation time scale of massive cluster ellipticals based on deep  near-ir spectroscopy at z~2	we present improved constraints on the formation time scale of massivecluster galaxies based on rest-frame optical spectra of galaxies in a formingcluster located at z=2.16. the spectra are obtained with moircs on the subarutelescope with an integration time of ~7 hours. we achieve accurate redshiftmeasurements by fitting seds using the spectra and broad-band photometrysimultaneously, allowing us to identify probable cluster members. clusters atlow redshifts are dominated by quiescent galaxies, but we find that quiescentgalaxies and star forming galaxies co-exist in this z=2 system. interestingly,the quiescent galaxies form a weak red sequence in the process of forming. bystacking the spectra of star forming galaxies, we observe strong emission linessuch as [oii] and [oiii] and we obtain a tentative hint of agn activities inthese galaxies. on the other hand, the stacked spectrum of the quiescentgalaxies reveals a clear 4000a break with a possible caii h+k absorptionfeature and strong emission lines such as [oii] are absent in the spectrum,confirming the quiescent nature of these galaxies. we then perform detailedspectral analyses of the stacked spectrum, which suggest that these massivequiescent galaxies formed at redshifts between 3 and 4 on a time scale of &lt;~0.5gyr. this short formation time scale is not reproduced in recent numericalsimulations. we discuss possible mechanisms for how these galaxies form 10^11msun stellar mass on a short time scale and become red and quiescent by z=2.

1310.6362	an alma survey of submillimetre galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: the far-infrared properties of smgs	we exploit alma 870um (345ghz) observations of submillimetre sources in theextended chandra deep field south to investigate the far-infrared properties ofhigh-redshift submillimetre galaxies (smgs). using the precisely located 870umalma positions of 99 smgs, together with 24um and radio imaging of this field,we deblend the herschel/spire imaging of this region to extract theirfar-infrared fluxes and colours. the median photometric redshifts for alma less(aless) smgs which are detected in at least two spire bands increases withwavelength of the peak in their seds, with z=2.3+/-0.2, 2.5+/-0.3 and 3.5+/-0.5for the 250, 350 and 500-um peakers respectively. we find that 34 aless smgs donot have a &gt;3-sigma counterpart at 250, 350 or 500-um. these galaxies have amedian photometric redshift of z=3.3+/-0.5, which is higher than the full alesssmg sample; z=2.5+/-0.2. using the photometric redshifts together with the250-870um photometry, we estimate the far-infrared luminosities andcharacteristic dust temperature of each smg. the median infrared luminosity ofthe s_870um&gt;2mjy smgs is l_ir=(3.0+/-0.3)x10^{12}lo(sfr=300+/-30mo/yr). at afixed luminosity, the characteristic dust temperature of these high-redshiftsmgs is 2-3k lower than comparably luminous galaxies at z=0, reflecting themore extended star formation occurring in these systems. by extrapolating the870um number counts to s_ 870um=1mjy, we show that the contribution ofs_870um&gt;1mjy smgs to the cosmic star formation budget is 20% of the total overthe redshift range z~1-4. we derive a median dust mass for these smgs ofm_d=(3.6+/-0.3)x10^8mo and by adopting an appropriate gas-to-dust ratio, weestimate an average molecular mass of m_h2=(4.2+/-0.4)x10^{10}mo. finally, weuse our estimates of the h2 masses to show that smgs with s_870um&gt;1mjy contain~10% of the z~2 volume-averaged h2 mass density at this epoch.

1310.6363	an alma survey of submillimeter galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: the redshift distribution and evolution of submillimeter  galaxies	we present the first photometric redshift distribution for a large unbiasedsample of 870um selected submillimeter galaxies (smgs) with robustidentifications based on observations with the atacama large millimeter array(alma). in our analysis we consider 96 smgs in the extended chandra deep fieldsouth, 77 of which have 4-19 band, optical-near-infrared, photometry. we modelthe spectral energy distributions (seds) for these 77 smgs, deriving a medianphotometric redshift of z=2.3+/-0.1. the remaining 19 smgs have insufficientoptical or near-infrared photometry to derive photometric redshifts, but astacking analysis of irac and herschel observations confirms they are notspurious. assuming these sources have an absolute h-band magnitude distributioncomparable to that of a complete sample of z~1-2 smgs, we demonstrate that theundetected smgs lie at higher redshifts, raising the median redshift for smgsto z=2.5+/-0.2. more critically we show that the proportion of galaxiesundergoing an smg phase at z&gt;3 is 35+/-5% of the total population. we derive amedian stellar mass for smgs of mstar=(8+/-1)x10^10mo, but caution that thereare significant systematic uncertainties in our stellar mass estimate, up to x5for individual sources. we compare our sample of smgs to a volume-limited,morphologically classified sample of ellipticals in the local universe.assuming the star formation activity in smgs has a timescale of ~100myr we showthat their descendants at z~0 would have a space density and m_h distributionwhich are in good agreement with those of local ellipticals. in addition theinferred mass-weighted ages of the local ellipticals broadly agree with thelook-back times of the smg events. taken together, these results are consistentwith a simple model that identifies smgs as events that form most of the starsseen in the majority of luminous elliptical galaxies at the present day.

1403.2390	the galaxy cluster mid-infrared luminosity function at 1.3&lt;z&lt;3.2	we present 4.5 {\mu}m luminosity functions for galaxies identified in 178candidate galaxy clusters at 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.2. the clusters were identified asspitzer/irac color-selected overdensities in the clusters around radio-loud agn(carla) project, which imaged 421 powerful radio-loud agn at z &gt; 1.3. theluminosity functions are derived for different redshift and richness bins, andthe irac imaging reaches depths of m*+2, allowing us to measure the faint endslopes of the luminosity functions. we find that {\alpha} = -1 describes theluminosity function very well in all redshifts bins and does not evolvesignificantly. this provides evidence that the rate at which the low massgalaxy population grows through star formation, gets quenched and isreplenished by in-falling field galaxies does not have a major net effect onthe shape of the luminosity function. our measurements for m* are consistentwith passive evolution models and high formation redshifts z_f ~ 3. we find aslight trend towards fainter m* for the richest clusters, implying that themost massive clusters in our sample could contain older stellar populations,yet another example of cosmic downsizing. modelling shows that a contributionof a star-forming population of up to 40% cannot be ruled out. this value,found from our targeted survey, is significantly lower than the values foundfor slightly lower redshift, z ~ 1, clusters found in wide-field surveys. theresults are consistent with cosmic downsizing, as the clusters studied herewere all found in the vicinity of radio-loud agns -- which have proven to bepreferentially located in massive dark matter halos in the richest environmentsat high redshift -- they may therefore be older and more evolved systems thanthe general protocluster population.

1502.04710	the influence of wavelength, flux, and lensing selection effects on the  redshift distribution of dusty, star-forming galaxies	we interpret the large variety of redshift distributions of galaxies found byfar-infrared and (sub-)millimeter deep surveys depending on their depth andwavelength using the b\'ethermin et al. (2012) phenomenological model of galaxyevolution. this model reproduces without any new parameter tuning the observedredshift distributions from 100 $\mu$m to 1.4 mm, and especially the increaseof the median redshift with survey wavelength. this median redshift varies alsosignificantly with the depth of the surveys, and deeper surveys do necessarilynot probe higher redshifts. paradoxically, at fixed wavelength and flux limit,the lensed sources are not always at higher redshift. we found that the higherredshift of 1.4 mm-selected south pole telescope (spt) sources compared toother smg surveys is not only caused by the lensing selection, but also by thelonger wavelength. this spt sample is expected to be dominated by a populationof lensed main-sequence galaxies and a minor contribution ($\sim$10\%) ofunlensed extreme starbursts.

1502.05998	mapping the dynamics of a giant ly-alpha halo at z=4.1 with muse: the  energetics of a large scale agn-driven outflow around a massive,  high-redshift galaxy	we present deep muse integral-field unit (ifu) spectroscopic observations ofthe giant (~150 x 80 kpc) ly-alpha halo around the z=4.1 radio galaxy tnjj1338-1942. this 9-hr observation maps the two-dimensional kinematics of thely-alpha emission across the halo. we identify two hi absorbers which are seenagainst the ly-alpha emission, both of which cover the full 150 x 80 kpc extentof the halo and so have covering fractions ~1. the stronger and moreblue-shifted absorber (dv~1200 km/s) has dynamics that mirror that of theunderlying halo emission and we suggest that this high column material (n(hi) ~10^19.4 /cm^2), which is also seen in civ absorption, represents an out-flowingshell that has been driven by the agn (or star formation) within the galaxy.the weaker (n(hi)~10^14 /cm^2) and less blue shifted (dv~500 km/s) absorbermost likely represents material in the cavity between the out-flowing shell andthe ly-alpha halo. we estimate that the mass in the shell must be of order10^10 msol -- a significant fraction of the ism from a galaxy at z=4. the largescales of these coherent structures illustrate the potentially powerfulinfluence of agn feedback on the distribution and energetics of material intheir surroundings. indeed, the discovery of high-velocity (~1000 km/s),group-halo-scale (i.e. &gt;150 kpc) and mass-loaded winds in the vicinity of thecentral radio source are broadly in agreement with the requirements of modelsthat invoke agn-driven outflows to regulate star formation and black-holegrowth in massive galaxies at early times.

astro-ph;0109540	optical and near-ir imaging of ultra steep spectrum radio sources - the  k-z diagram of radio and optically selected galaxies	we present optical and/or near-ir images of 128 ultra steep spectrum (uss)radio sources. roughly half of the objects are identified in the optical images(r &lt;~ 24), while in the near-ir images, &gt;94% are detected at k&lt;~ 22. the meank-magnitude is k=19.26 within a 2" diameter aperture. the distribution of r-kcolors indicates that at least 1/3 of the objects observed have very red colors(r-k&gt;5). the major axes of the identifications in k-band are preferentiallyoriented along the radio axes, with half of them having compact morphologies.  the 22 sources with spectroscopic redshifts and k-band magnitudes follow thek-z relation found from previous radio samples, but with a larger scatter. weargue that this may be due to a dependence of k-magnitude on the radio power,with the highest radio power sources inhabiting the most massive host galaxies.we present a composite k-z diagram of radio-loud and radio-quiet galaxies,selected from the hdf-north and the hawaii surveys. out to z &lt;~ 1, theradio-loud galaxies trace the bright envelope of the radio quiet galaxies,while at z &gt;~ 1, the radio-loud galaxies are &gt;~ 2 magnitudes brighter. we arguethat this is not due to a contribution from the agn or emission lines. thisdifference strongly suggests that radio galaxies pinpoint the most massivesystems out to the highest known redshifts, probably due to the mutualcorrelation of the mass of the galaxy and the radio power on the mass of thecentral black hole.

astro-ph;0302154	co emission and associated hi absorption from a massive gas reservoir  surrounding the z=3 radio galaxy b3 j2330+3927	we present results of a comprehensive multi-frequency study of the radiogalaxy b3 j2330+3927. the 1.9" wide radio source, consisting of 3 components,is bracketed by 2 objects in our keck k-band image. optical and near-ir keckspectroscopy of these two objects yield z=3.087+-0.004. the brightest (k=18.8)object has a standard type ii agn spectrum, and is the most likely location ofthe agn, which implies a one-sided jet radio morphology. deep 113 ghzobservations with the iram plateau de bure interferometer reveal co j=4-3emission, which peaks at the position of the agn. the co line is offset by 500km/s from the systemic redshift of the agn, but corresponds very closely to thevelocity shift of an associated hi absorber seen in lya. this strongly suggeststhat both originate from the same gas reservoir surrounding the agn hostgalaxy. simultaneous 230 ghz interferometer observations find a ~3x lowerintegrated flux density when compared to single dish 250 ghz observations withmambo at the iram 30m telescope. this can be interpreted as spatially resolvedthermal dust emission at scales of 0.5" to 6". finally, we present a tau &lt;1.3%limit to the hi 21 cm absorption against the radio source, which represents theseventh non-detection out of 8 z&gt;2 radio galaxies observed to date with thewsrt. we present mass estimates for the atomic, neutral, and ionized hydrogen,and for the dust, ranging from m(hi)=2x10^7 m_sun derived from the associatedhi absorber in lya up to m(h_2)=7x10^{10} m_sun derived from the co emission.this indicates that the host galaxy is surrounded by a massive reservoir of gasand dust. the k-band companion objects may be concentrations within thisreservoir, which will eventually merge with the central galaxy hosting the agn.

astro-ph;0302432	an obscured radio galaxy at high redshift	perhaps as many as 10% of high redshift radio galaxy (hzrg; z &gt; 2) candidatesthat are selected using an ultra steep radio spectrum (uss) criterion fail toshow optical emission (continuum, lines) in deep keck exposures. their parentobjects are only detected in the near-ir and are probably heavily obscuredand/or at very high redshift. to search for signatures of dust and helpconstrain the nature and redshifts of these ``no-z'' radio galaxies, we haveconducted a program of submillimeter and millimeter observations. here wereport the first results of a detailed study of one of these objects, wnj0305+3525.  wn j0305+3525 appears associated with a small group of k ~ 21 - 22 objectsand is strongly detected at both 850 micron and 1.25 mm. on the basis of itsfaint k-band magnitude, spectral energy distribution (sed) and other evidencewe estimate that the radio galaxy is probably at a redshift z = 3 +/- 1. thiswould make wn j0305+3525 a radio-loud hyper luminous infrared galaxy (lfir ~10^13 lsun) similar to, but more obscured than, other dusty radio galaxies inthis redshift range. this, together with the absence of lya emission andcompact (theta &lt; 1.9") radio structure, suggests that wn j0305+3525 is embeddedin a very dense, dusty medium and is probably at an early stage of itsformation.

astro-ph;0405339	a multi-wavelength study of the proto-cluster surrounding the z=4.1  radio galaxy tn j1338-1942	we present a 1.2 mm (250 ghz) map obtained with mambo on the iram 30mtelescope of the central 25 arcmin^2 of the proto-cluster surrounding the z=4.1radio galaxy tn j1338-1942. the map reaches a 1sigma sensitivity of 0.6 mjy inthe central area, increasing to 1.2 mjy at the edges. we detect 10 candidate mmsources, of which 8 are also detected in a deep vla 1.4 ghz map and/or a vltr-band image. three sources have a flux density s_{1.2 mm}&gt;4.0 mjy,representing a 7sigma overdensity compared to random field surveys, whichpredict only 1 such source in our map area. we obtained scuba/jcmt 850 um and450 um photometry of six radio/optically identified mambo sources, confirming 5of them with s/n&gt;4. radio-to-mm and mm-to-submm redshift estimators cannot putstrong constraints on the redshifts of these mambo sources, but 9 of them areconsistent within the uncertainties (mean delta z=+2.6) with z=4.1. one faintmambo source is possibly identified with an extremely red object (r-k=6.1) at alikely spectroscopic redshift z=1.18. the four brightest mambo sources are alllocated north of the radio galaxy, while the densest area of companion ly-alphaexcess and lyman break galaxies is to the southeast. none of the 14spectroscopically confirmed ly-alpha emitters in the mambo field are detectedat 1.2 mm; their average 1.2 mm flux density is &lt;s_{\rm 1.2mm}&gt;=0.25+-0.24 mjy.if the mm sources lie at z=4.1, none of them show excess ly-alpha emission inour narrow-band images. both populations thus show no apparent overlap,possibly due to dust quenching the ly-alpha emission. if the mm sources arepart of the proto-cluster, our results suggest that galaxies with starformation rates of a few 1000 m_{sun} yr^{-1} could be spread throughout theproto-cluster over projected scales of at least 2 mpc.

astro-ph;0405567	dust and star formation in distant radio galaxies	we present the results of an observing program with the scuba bolometer arrayto measure the submillimetre (submm) dust continuum emission of 24 distant (z &gt;1) radio galaxies. we detected submm emission in 12 galaxies with s/n &gt; 3,including 9 detections at z &gt; 3. when added to previous published results thesedata almost triple the number of radio galaxies with z &gt; 3 detected in thesubmm and yield a sample of 69 observed radio galaxies over the redshift rangez = 1-5. we find that the range in rest-frame far-infrared luminosities isabout a factor of 10. we have investigated the origin of this dispersion,correlating the luminosities with radio source power, size, spectral index,k-band magnitude and lya luminosity. no strong correlations are apparent in thecombined data set. we confirm and strengthen the result from previous submmobservations of radio galaxies that the detection rate is a strong function ofredshift. we compare the redshift dependence of the submm properties of radiogalaxies with those of quasars and find that for both classes of objects theobserved submm flux density increases with redshift to z ~ 4, beyond which, forthe galaxies, we find tentative evidence for a decline. we find evidence for ananti-correlation between submm luminosity and uv polarisation fraction, for asubsample of 13 radio galaxies, indicating that starbursts are the dominantsource of heating for dust in radio galaxies.

astro-ph;0406213	clustering and proto-clusters in the early universe	the clustering properties of clusters, galaxies and agn as a function ofredshift are briefly discussed. it appears that extremely red objects at z ~ 1,and objects with j-k &gt; 1.7 and photometric redshifts 2 &lt; z_phot &lt; 4 are highlyclustered, indicating that a majority of these objects constitutes theprogenitors of nearby ellipticals. similarly clustered seem luminous radiogalaxies at z\sim 1, indicating that these objects comprise a short lived phasein the lifetime of these red objects. the high level of clustering furthermoresuggests that distant powerful radio galaxies (e.g. z&gt;2) might be residing inthe progenitors of nearby clusters -- proto-clusters. a number of observationalprojects targetting fields with distant radio galaxies, including studies oflya and ha emitters, lyman break galaxies and (sub)mm and x-ray emitters, allconfirm that such radio galaxies are located in such proto-clusters. estimatesof the total mass of the proto-clusters are similar to the masses of localclusters. if the total star formation rate which we estimate for the entireproto-clusters is sustained up to z~1, the metals in the hot cluster gas oflocal clusters can easily be accounted for.
