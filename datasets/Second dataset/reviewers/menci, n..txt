0901.2898	the fraction of quiescent massive galaxies in the early universe	aims: the aim of this work is to collect a complete, mass--selected sample ofgalaxies with very low specific star formation rate, for a comparison with theprediction of recent theoretical models. method: we use the 24/k flux ratio,complemented by the sed fitting to the full 0.35-8.0 mum spectral distribution,to select quiescent galaxies from z~0.4 to z~4 in the goods--music sample. ourobservational selection can be translated into thresholds on the specific starformation rate sfr/m_*, that can be used to compare with the theoreticalpredictions. results: we find that, in the framework of the well known globaldecline of the quiescent fraction with redshift, a non-negligible fraction~15-20% of massive galaxies with very low specific star formation rate existsup to z~4, including a tail of "red&amp;dead" galaxies with sfr/m_*&lt;10^{-11}/yr.recent theoretical models vary to a large extent in the prediction of thefraction of galaxies with very low specific star formation rates, and areunable to provide a global match to our data.

0901.3540	uncertainties and systematic effects on the estimate of stellar masses  in high z galaxies	we discuss the uncertainties and the systematic effects that exist in theestimates of the stellar masses of high redshift galaxies, using broad bandphotometry, and how they affect the deduced galaxy stellar mass function. weuse at this purpose the latest version of the goods-music catalog. inparticular, we discuss the impact of different synthetic models, of the assumedinitial mass function and of the selection band. using charlot &amp; bruzual 2007and maraston 2005 models we find masses lower than those obtained from bruzual&amp; charlot 2003 models. in addition, we find a slight trend as a function of themass itself comparing these two mass determinations with that from bruzual &amp;charlot 2003 models. as consequence, the derived galaxy stellar mass functionsshow diverse shapes, and their slope depends on the assumed models. despitethese differences, the overall results and scenario remains unchanged. themasses obtained with the assumption of the chabrier initial mass function arein average 0.24 dex lower than those from the salpeter assumption, at allredshifts, causing a shift of galaxy stellar mass function of the same amount.finally, using a 4.5 um-selected sample instead of a ks-selected one, we add anew population of highly absorbed, dusty galaxies at z\simeq 2-3 of relativelylow masses, yielding stronger constraints on the slope of the galaxy stellarmass function at lower masses.

0903.3952	a comprehensive study of large scale structures in the goods-south field  up to z \sim 2.5	the aim of this paper is to identify and study the properties and galacticcontent of groups and clusters in the goods-south field up to z\sim2.5, and toanalyse the physical properties of galaxies as a continuous function ofenvironmental density up to high redshift. we use the deep (z850\sim26),multi-wavelength goods-music catalogue, which has a 15% of spectroscopicredshifts and accurate photometric redshifts for the remaining fraction. onthese data, we apply a (2+1)d algorithm, previously developed by our group,that provides an adaptive estimate of the 3d density field. we support ouranalysis with simulations to evaluate the purity and the completeness of thecluster catalogue produced by our algorithm. we find several high density peaksembedded in larger structures in the redshift range 0.4-2.5. from the analysisof their physical properties (mass profile, m200, \sigmav, lx, u-b vs. bdiagram), we derive that most of them are groups of galaxies, while two arepoor clusters with masses of few times 10^14 mo. for these two clusters wefind, from the chandra 2ms data, an x-ray emission significantly lower thanexpected from their optical properties, suggesting that the two clusters areeither not virialised or gas poor. we also analyse the dependance onenvironment of galaxy colours, luminosities, stellar masses, ages and starformations. we find that galaxies in high density regions are, on average, moreluminous and massive than field galaxies up to z\sim 2. the fraction of redgalaxies increases with luminosity and with density up to z\sim 1.2. at higherz this dependance on density disappears. the variation of galaxy properties asa function of redshift and density suggests that a significant change occurs atz\sim 1.5-2.

0905.0683	star formation and mass assembly in high redshift galaxies	we study the star formation and the mass assembly process of 0.3&lt;=z&lt;2.5galaxies using their ir emission from mips 24um band. we used an updatedversion of the goods-music catalog, extended by the addition of mid-ir fluxes.we compared two different estimators of the star formation rate: the totalinfrared emission derived from 24um, estimated using both synthetic andempirical ir templates, and the multiwavelength fit to the full galaxy sed. forboth estimates, we computed the sfr density and the specific sfr. the two sfrtracers are roughly consistent, given the uncertainties involved. however, theyshow a systematic trend, ir-based estimates exceeding the fit-based ones as thesfr increases. we show that: a) at z&gt;0.3, the sfr is well correlated withstellar mass, and this relationship seems to steepen with redshift (usingir-based sfrs); b) the contribution to the global sfrd by massive galaxiesincreases with redshift up to ~2.5, more rapidly than for galaxies of lowermass, but appears to flatten at higher z; c) despite this increase, the mostimportant contributors to the sfrd at any z are galaxies of about, orimmediately lower than, the characteristic stellar mass; d) at z~2, massivegalaxies are actively star-forming, with a median sfr 300 msun/yr. during thisepoch, they assemble a substantial part of their final stellar mass; e) thessfr shows a clear bimodal distribution. the analysis of the sfrd and the ssfrseems to support the downsizing scenario, according to which high mass galaxieshave formed their stars earlier and faster than their low mass counterparts. acomparison with theoretical models indicates that they follow the globalincrease in the ssfr with redshift and predict the existence of quiescentgalaxies even at z&gt;1.5, but they systematically underpredict the average ssfr.

0909.2853	evidence for a fast evolution of the uv luminosity function beyond  redshift 6 from a deep hawk-i survey of the goods-s field	we perform a deep search for galaxies in the redshift range 6.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, tomeasure the evolution of the number density of luminous galaxies in thisredshift range and derive useful constraints on the evolution of theirluminosity function. we present here the first results of an eso large program,that exploits the unique combination of area and sensitivity provided in thenear-ir by the camera hawk-i at the vlt. we have obtained two hawk-i pointingson the goods south field for a total of 32 observing hours, covering ~90arcmin2. the images reach y=26.7 mags for the two fields. we have used publicacs images in the z band to select z-dropout galaxies with the colour criteriaz-y&gt;1, y-j&lt;1.5 and y-k&lt;2. the other public data in the ubvrijhk bands are usedto reject possible low redshift interlopers. the output has been compared withextensive monte carlo simulations to quantify the observational effects of ourselection criteria as well as the effects of photometric errors. we detect 7high quality candidates in the magnitude range y=25.5-26.7. this intervalsamples the critical range for m* at z&gt;6 (m_1500 ~- 19.5 to -21.5). afteraccounting for the expected incompleteness, we rule out at a 99% confidencelevel a luminosity function constant from z=6 to z=7, even including theeffects of cosmic variance. for galaxies brighter than m_1500=-19.0 we derive aluminosity density rho_uv=1.5^{+2.0}_{-0.9} 10^25 erg/s/hz/mpc3, implying adecrease by a factor 3.5 from z=6 to z~6.8. on the basis of our findings, wemake predictions for the surface densities expected in future surveys surveys,based on ultra-vista, hst-wfc3 or jwst-nircam, evaluating the bestobservational strategy to maximise their impact.

1103.4478	an x-ray underluminous cluster of galaxies in the 4ms cdfs observations	[abridged] we use the large public spectroscopic database available in thegoods-south field to estimate the dynamical mass and the virialization statusof cluster clg 0332-2747 at z=0.734. cluster members selected from theirphotometric redshift are used with spectroscopic ones to analyse the galaxypopulation of the cluster. in the newly released chandra 4ms observations wedetect a faint extended x-ray emission associated to the cluster. finally, wecompare the optical and x-ray properties of clg 0332-2747 with the predictionsof a well tested semianalytic model. we estimate the velocity dispersion andthe virial mass considering all 44 spectroscopic members, or 20 red-sequencemembers only. we obtain sigma_v=634 +/- 105 km/s, m_200=3.07^{+1.57}_{-1.16}~10^{14} m_sun in the former case, and slightly lower values inthe latter case. the cluster appears to have reached the virial equilibrium: itshows a perfectly gaussian velocity distribution and no evidence forsubstructures. clg 0332-2747 contains a high fraction of bright red galaxies,and is dominated by a very massive (1.1 x 10^{12} m_sun) old brightest clustergalaxy (bcg), suggesting that it formed at an early epoch. we detect a faintextended x-ray source centered on the bcg, with a total x-ray luminosity of l_x~ 2 x 10^{42} erg s^-1 (0.1-2.4 kev). this l_x is lower by a factor of ~10-20than expected according to the m-l_x relation. we provide a possibleexplanation of this discrepancy as due to the effects of agn feedback on theicm: the semianalytic model reproduces the m-l_x relation measured from "x-raybright" clusters, and it predicts a high scatter at low masses due to heatingand expulsion of the cluster gas. interestingly, in the model clusters with anevolved galaxy population like clg 0332-2747 present the largest scatter inx-ray luminosity.

1109.1757	the blue uv slopes of z~4 lyman break galaxies: implications for the  corrected star formation rate density	we plan to analyse dust extinction in lyman break galaxies (lbgs) byintroducing a new and more reliable approach to their selection and to thecharacterization of their distribution of uv slopes beta, using deep ir imagesfrom hst. we exploit deep wfc3 ir observations of the ers and hudf fields overgoods-south, combined with hst-acs optical data, to select z~4 lbgs through anew (b-v) vs. (v-h) colour diagram. the uv slope of the selected galaxies isrobustly determined by a linear fit over their observed i, z, y, j magnitudes,coherently with the original definition of beta. the same fit is used todetermine their rest-frame uv magnitudes m1600 through a simple interpolation.we estimate the effect of observational uncertainties with detailed simulationsthat we also exploit, under a parametric maximum-likelihood approach, toconstrain the probability density function of uv slopes pdf(beta) as a functionof rest-frame magnitude. we find 142 and 25 robust lbgs in the ers and hudffields respectively, limiting our sample to s/n(h)&gt;10 objects. our newlydefined criteria improve the selection of z~4 lbgs and allow us to exclude redinterlopers at lower redshift, especially z~3-3.5 objects. we find that z~4lbgs are characterized by blue uv slopes, suggesting a low dust extinction: alll&lt;l* galaxies have an average uv slope &lt;beta&gt;\simeq-2.1, while brighter objectsonly are slightly redder (&lt;beta&gt; -1.9). we find an intrinsic dispersion ~ 0.3for pdf(beta) at all magnitudes. the sfrd at z~4 corrected according to theseestimates turns out to be lower than previously found: log(sfrd)\simeq-1.09m_sun/yr/mpc^3. finally, we discuss how the uv slope of z~4 galaxies changes asa function of the dust-corrected uv magnitude (i.e. sfr) showing that mostgalaxies with a high sfr (&gt; 80 m_sun/yr) are highly extincted objects.[abridged]

1201.1617	galaxy formation in wdm cosmology	we investigate for the first time the effects of a warm dark matter (wdm)power spectrum on the statistical properties of galaxies using a semi-analyticmodel of galaxy formation. the wdm spectrum we adopt as a reference case issuppressed - compared to the standard cold dark matter (cdm) case - below acut-off scale ~ 1 mpc corresponding (for thermal relic wdm particles) to a massm_x=0.75 kev. this ensures consistency with present bounds provided by themicrowave background wmap data and by the comparison of hydrodynamical n-bodysimulations with observed lyman-{\alpha} forest. we run our fiducialsemi-analytic model with such a wdm spectrum to derive galaxy luminosityfunctions (in b, uv, and k bands) and the stellar mass distributions over awide range of cosmic epochs, to compare with recent observations and with theresults in the cdm case. the predicted color distribution of galaxies in thewdm model is also checked against the data. when compared with the standard cdmcase, the luminosity and stellar mass distributions we obtain assuming a wdmspectrum are characterized by: i) a flattening of the faint end slope and ii) asharpening of the cutoff at the bright end for z \lesssim 0.8. we discuss howthe former result is directly related to the smaller number of low-mass haloescollapsing in the wdm scenario, while the latter is related to the smallernumber of satellite galaxies accumulating in massive haloes at low redshift,thus suppressing the accretion of small lumps on the central, massive galaxies.these results shows how a adopting a wdm power spectrum may contribute to solvetwo major problems of cdm galaxy formation scenarios, namely, the excess ofpredicted faint (low mass) galaxies at low and - most of all - high redshifts,and the excess of bright (massive) galaxies at low redshifts.

1204.5881	the physics and the structure of the quasar-driven outflow in mrk 231	massive agn-driven outflows are invoked by agn-galaxy co-evolutionary modelsto suppress both star formation and black hole accretion. massive molecularoutflows have recently been revealed in some agn hosts. however, the physicalproperties and structure of these agn-driven molecular outflows are stillpoorly constrained. here we present new iram pdbi observations of mrk231, theclosest quasar known, targeting both the co(1-0) and co(2-1) transitions. wedetect broad wings in both transitions, tracing a massive molecular outflowwith velocities up to 800 km/s. the wings are spatially resolved at highsignificance level (5-11 sigma), indicating that the molecular outflow extendson the kpc scale. the co(2-1)/co(1-0) ratio of the red broad wings isconsistent with the ratio observed in the narrow core, while the blue broadwing is less excited than the core. the latter result suggests that quasardriven outflow models invoking shocks (which would predict higher gasexcitation) are not appropriate to describe the bulk of the outflow in mrk231.however, we note that within the central 700 pc the co(2-1)/co(1-0) ratio ofthe red wing is slightly, but significantly, higher than in the line core,suggesting that shocks may play a role in the central region. we also find thatthe average size of the outflow anticorrelates with the critical density of thetransition used as a wind tracer. this indicates that, although diffuse anddense clumps coexist in the outflowing gas, dense outflowing clouds haveshorter lifetime and that they evaporate into the diffuse component along theoutflow or, more simply, that diffuse clouds are more efficiently acceleratedto larger distances by radiation pressure.

1302.3243	the cosmic evolution of faint satellite galaxies as a test of galaxy  formation and the nature of dark matter	the standard cosmological model based on cold dark matter (cdm) predicts alarge number of subhalos for each galaxy-size halo. it is well known thatmatching the subhalos to the observed properties of luminous satellites ofgalaxies in the local universe poses a significant challenge to ourunderstanding of the astrophysics of galaxy formation. we show that the cosmicevolution and host mass dependence of the luminosity function of satellitesprovides a powerful new diagnostic to disentangle astrophysical effects fromvariations in the underlying dark matter mass function. we illustrate this bycomparing the results of recent observations of satellites out to $z=0.8$ basedon hubble space telescope images with the predictions of three different setsof state-of-the art semi-analytic models with underlying cdm power spectra andone semi-analytic model with an underlying warm dark matter (wdm) powerspectrum. we find that even though cdm models provide a reasonable fit to thelocal luminosity function of satellites around galaxies comparable or slightlylarger than the milky way, they do not reproduce the data as well for differentredshift and host galaxy stellar mass. this tension indicates that furtherimprovements are likely to be needed in the description of star formation ifthe models are to be reconciled with the data. the wdm model matches theobserved mass dependence and redshift evolution of satellite galaxies moreclosely than any of the cdm models, indicating that a modification of theunderlying power spectrum may offer an alternative solution to this tension. weconclude by presenting predictions for the color magnitude relation ofsatellite galaxies to demonstrate how future observations will be able tofurther distinguish between these models and help constrain baryonic andnon-baryonic physics.

1311.1921	diffuse optical intracluster light as a measure of stellar tidal  stripping: the cluster cl0024+17 at $z\sim $0.4 observed at lbt	we have evaluated the diffuse intracluster light (icl) in the central core ofthe galaxy cluster cl0024+17 at $z\sim 0.4$ observed with the prime focuscamera (lbc) at lbt. the measure required an accurate removal of the galaxieslight within $\sim 200$ kpc from the center. the residual background intensityhas then been integrated in circular apertures to derive the average iclintensity profile. the latter shows an approximate exponential decline asexpected from theoretical cold dark matter models. the radial profile of theicl over the galaxies intensity ratio (icl fraction) is increasing withdecreasing radius but near the cluster center it starts to bend and thendecreases where the overlap of the halos of the brightest cluster galaxiesbecomes dominant. theoretical expectations in a simplified cdm scenario showthat the icl fraction profile can be estimated from the stripped over galaxystellar mass ratio in the cluster. it is possible to show that the latterquantity is almost independent of the properties of the individual hostgalaxies but mainly depends on the average cluster properties. the predictedicl fraction profile is thus very sensitive to the assumed cdm profile, totalmass and concentration parameter of the cluster. adopting values very similarto those derived from the most recent lensing analysis in cl0024+17 we find agood agreement with the observed icl fraction profile. the galaxy counts in thecluster core have then been compared with that derived from composite clustersamples in larger volumes, up to the clusters virial radius. the galaxy countsin the cl0024+17 core appear flatter and the amount of bending respect to theaverage cluster galaxy counts imply a loss of total emissivity in broadagreement with the measured icl fraction.

1311.3670	the evolution of the dust and gas content in galaxies	we use deep herschel pacs and spire observations in goodss, goodsn and cosmosto estimate the average dust mass (mdust) of galaxies on a redshift-stellarmass (mstar)-sfr grid. we study the scaling relations between mdust, mstar andsfr at z&lt;=2.5. no clear evolution of mdust is observed at fixed sfr and mstar.we find a tight correlation between sfr and mdust, likely a consequence of theschmidt-kennicutt (s-k) law. the mstar-mdust correlation observed by previousworks flattens or sometimes disappears when fixing the sfr. most of it likelyderives from the combination of the mdust-sfr and mstar-sfr correlations. wethen investigate the gas content as inferred by converting mdust by assumingthat the dust/gas ratio scales linearly with the gas metallicity. all galaxiesin the sample follow, within uncertainties, the same sfr-mgas relation(integrated s-k law), which broadly agrees with co-based results for the bulkof the population, despite the completely different approaches. the majority ofgalaxies at z~2 form stars with an efficiency (sfe=sfr/mgas) ~5 times higherthan at z~0. it is not clear what fraction of such variation is an intrinsicredshift evolution and what fraction arises from selection effects. the gasfraction (fgas) decreases with mstar and increases with sfr, and does notevolve with z at fixed mstar and sfr. we explain these trends by introducing auniversal relation between fgas, mstar and sfr, non-evolving out to z~2.5.galaxies move across this relation as their gas content evolves in time. we usethe 3d fundamental fgas-mstar-sfr relation and the redshift evolution of themain sequence to estimate the evolution of fgas in the average population ofgalaxies as a function of z and mstar, and we find evidence a downsizingscenario.

1406.7740	triggering active galactic nuclei in hierarchical galaxy formation: disk  instability vs. interactions	using a semi analytic model for galaxy formation we investigate the effectsof black hole accretion triggered by disk instabilities (di) in isolatedgalaxies on the evolution of agn. specifically, we took on, developed andexpanded the hopkins &amp; quataert (2011) model for the mass inflow following diskperturbations, and compare the corresponding evolution of the agn populationwith that arising in a scenario where galaxy interactions trigger agn (itmode). we extended and developed the di model by including different disksurface density profiles, to study the maximal contribution of di to theevolution of the agn population. we obtained the following results: i) forluminosities corresponding to $m_{1450}\gtrsim -26$ the di mode can provide thebh accretion needed to match the observed agn luminosity functions up to $z\approx 4.5$; in such a luminosity range and redshift, it can compete with theit scenario as the main driver of cosmological evolution of agn; ii) the discenario cannot provide the observed abundance of high-luminosity qso with$m_{1450}\lesssim -26$ agn, as well as the abundance of high-redhshift $z\approx 4.5$ qsos with $m_{1450}\lesssim -24$, while the it scenario providesan acceptable match up to $z \approx 6$, as found in our earliest works; iii)the dispersion of the distributions of eddington ratio for low- andintermediate-luminosity agn (bolometric $l_{agn}$ = $10^{43}$ - $10^{45}$erg/s) is predicted to be much smaller in the di scenario compared to the itmode; iv) the above conclusions are robust with respect to the exploredvariants of the hopkins &amp; quataert (2011) model. we discuss the physical originof our findings, and how it is possible to pin down the dominant fuelingmechanism in the low-intermediate luminosity range $m_{1450}\gtrsim -26$ whereboth the di and the it modes are viable candidates as drivers for the agnevolution.

1409.7083	a mass threshold in the number density of passive galaxies at z$\sim$2	the process that quenched star formation in galaxies at intermediate and highredshift is still the subject of considerable debate. one way to investigatethis puzzling issue is to study the number density of quiescent galaxies atz~2, and its dependence on mass. here we present the results of a new studybased on very deep ks-band imaging (with the hawk-i instrument on the vlt) oftwo hst candels fields (the ukidss ultra-deep survey (uds) field andgoods-south). the new hawk-i data (taken as part of the hugs vlt large program)reach detection limits of ks&gt;26 (ab mag). we select a sample ofpassively-evolving galaxies in the redshift range 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5. thanks to thedepth and large area coverage of our imaging, we have been able to extend theselection of quiescent galaxies a magnitude fainter than previous analyses.through extensive simulations we demonstrate, for the first time, that theobserved turn-over in the number of quiescent galaxies at k&gt;22 is real. thishas enabled us to establish unambiguously that the number counts of quiescentgalaxies at z~2 flatten and slightly decline at magnitudes fainter thanks~22(ab mag.). we show that this trend corresponds to a stellar mass threshold$m_*10^{10.8}\,{\rm m_{\odot}}$ below which the mechanism that halts the starformation in high-redshift galaxies seems to be inefficient. finally we comparethe observed pbzk number counts with those of quiescent galaxies extracted fromfour different semi-analytic models. we find that none of the models provides astatistically acceptable description of the number density of quiescentgalaxies at these redshifts. we conclude that the mass function of quiescentgalaxies as a function of redshift continues to present a key and demandingchallenge for proposed models of galaxy formation and evolution.

1412.7660	physical properties of agn host galaxies as a probe of smbh feeding  mechanisms	using an advanced semi analytic model (sam) for galaxy formation, we haveinvestigated the statistical effects of assuming two different mechanisms fortriggering agn activity on the properties of agn host galaxies. we haveconsidered a first accretion mode where agn activity is triggered by diskinstabilities (di) in isolated galaxies, and a second feeding mode where suchan activity is triggered by galaxy mergers and fly-by events (interactions,it). we obtained the following results:i) for hosts with $m_* \lesssim 10^{11}m_{\bigodot}$, both di and it modes are able to account for the observed agnhosts stellar mass function; for more massive hosts, the di scenario predicts alower space density than the it model, lying below the observational estimatesfor z&gt;0.8.ii) the analysis of the color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of agn hostsfor redshift z &lt; 1.5 can provide a good observational test to effectivelydiscriminate between the di and it mode, since dis are expected to yield agnhost galaxy colors skewed towards bluer colors, while in the it scenario themajority of hosts are expected to reside in the red sequence.iii) while both itand di scenarios can account for agn triggered in main sequence or starburstgalaxies, dis fail in triggering agn activity in passive galaxies.iv) the twomodes are characterized by a different duration of the agn phase, with dislasting even on time scales $\sim $ gyr, much longer with respect to the itscenario.v) the scatter of the $sfr-l_{bol}$ relation could represent anothercrucial diagnostics to discriminate between the two triggering modes, since thedi scenario predicts an appreciably lower scatter of the relation than the itscenario. vi) disk instabilities are not able to account for the observedfraction of agn in groups for z &lt; 1 and clusters for z &lt; 0.7, while the itscenario provides a good match to observational data.

1511.08215	constraining agn triggering mechanisms through the clustering analysis  of active black holes	the triggering mechanisms for active galactic nuclei (agn) are still debated.some of the most popular ones include galaxy interactions (it) and diskinstabilities (di). using an advanced semi analytic model (sam) of galaxyformation, coupled to accurate halo occupation distribution modeling, weinvestigate the imprint left by each separate triggering process on theclustering strength of agn at small and large scales. our main results are asfollows: i) dis, irrespective of their exact implementation in the sam, tend tofall short in triggering agn activity in galaxies at the center of halos with$m_h&gt;10^{13.5} h^{-1}m_{\odot}$. on the contrary, the it scenario predictsabundance of active, central galaxies that generally agrees well withobservations at every halo mass. ii) the relative number of satellite agn indis at intermediate-to-low luminosities is always significantly higher than init models, especially in groups and clusters. the low agn satellite fractionpredicted for the it scenario might suggest that different feeding modes couldsimultaneously contribute to the triggering of satellite agn. iii) bothscenarios are quite degenerate in matching large-scale clustering measurements,suggesting that the sole average bias might not be an effective observationalconstraint. iv) our analysis suggests the presence of both a mild luminosityand a more consistent redshift dependence in the agn clustering, with agninhabiting progressively less massive dark matter halos as the redshiftincreases. we also discuss the impact of different observational selection cutsin measuring agn clustering, including possible discrepancies between opticaland x-ray surveys.

(a) an extra heating energy of about 1 kev per gas particle isrequired to reproduce the observed lx-t relation, independent of whether it isprovided so as to create an entropy floor of 50-100 kev cm^2, or is modulatedin redshift; our sn feedback recipe provides only 1/3 kev/part. (b) the m-trelation is almost unaffected by non-gravitational heating and follows the mt^{3/2} scaling, with a normalization ~40% higher than observed, independent ofthe heating scheme. the inclusion of cooling in a run of a small group has theeffects of increasing t_ew by ~30%, possibly reconciling simulated and observedm-t relations, and of decreasing lx by ~40%. in spite of the inclusion of snfeedback energy, almost 40% of the gas becomes cold, in excess of currentobservational estimates.

astro-ph;0206168	the k20 survey. iii. photometric and spectroscopic properties of the  sample	the k20 survey is an eso vlt optical and near-infrared spectroscopic surveyaimed at obtaining spectral information and redshifts of a complete sample ofabout 550 objects to k_s\leq20.0 over two independent fields with a total areaof 52 arcmin^2. in this paper we discuss the scientific motivation of such asurvey, we describe the photometric and spectroscopic properties of the sample,and we release the $k_s$-band photometric catalog. extensive simulations showedthat the sample is photometrically highly complete to k_s=20. the observedgalaxy counts and the r-k_s color distribution are consistent with literatureresults. we observed spectroscopically 94% of the sample, reaching aspectroscopic redshift identification completeness of 92% to k_s\leq20.0 forthe observed targets, and of 87% for the whole sample (i.e. counting also theunobserved targets). deep spectroscopy was complemented with multi-band deepimaging in order to derive tested and reliable photometric redshifts for thegalaxies lacking spectroscopic redshifts. the results show a very goodagreement between the spectroscopic and the photometric redshifts with&lt;z_{spe}-z_{phot}&gt;=0.01 and with a dispersion of \sigma_{\delta z}=0.09. usingboth the spectroscopic and the photometric redshifts, we reached an overallredshift completeness of about 98%. the size of the sample, the redshiftcompleteness, the availability of high quality photometric redshifts andmulticolor spectral energy distributions make the k20 survey database one ofthe most complete samples available to date for constraining the currentlycompeting scenarios of galaxy formation and for a variety of other galaxyevolution studies.

astro-ph;0302575	cooling and heating the icm in hydrodynamical simulations	we discuss tree+sph simulations of galaxy clusters and groups, aimed atstudying the effect of cooling and non-gravitational heating on observableproperties of the icm. we simulate at high resolution four halos,with masses inthe range (0.2-4)10^{14}m_sol. we discuss the effects of using different sphimplementations and show that high resolution is mandatory to correctly followthe cooling pattern of the icm. all of our heating schemes which correctlyreproduce the x-ray scaling properties of clusters and groups do not succeed inreducing the fraction of collapsed gas below a level of 20 (30) per cent at thecluster (group) scale. finally, gas compression in cooling cluster regionscauses an increase of the temperature and a steepening of the temperatureprofiles, independent of the presence of non-gravitational heating processes.this is inconsistent with recent observational evidence for a decrease of gastemperature towards the center of relaxed clusters. provided thesediscrepancies persist even for a more refined modeling of energy feedback, theymay indicate that some basic physical process is still missing inhydrodynamical simulations.

astro-ph;0302599	the k20 survey. v the evolution of the near-ir luminosity function	we present the galaxy rest-frame near-ir luminosity function (lf) and itscosmic evolution to z=1.5 based on a spectroscopic survey of a magnitudelimited sample of galaxies with ks&lt;20 (the k20 survey, cimatti et al. 2002b).the lfs have been derived in the rest-frame j and ks bands using 3 z bins(z_mean= 0.5, 1, 1.5) and compared to the local near-ir lf. the faint-end ofthe lfs is consistent with the local estimates, with no evidence for a changeeither in the slope or normalization up to z&lt;1.3. viceversa, the density ofluminous galaxies (m_ks-5logh_70&lt;-25.5) is higher than locally at all z andrelatively constant or mildly increasing with z within our sample. the data areconsistent with a mild luminosity evolution both in the j and ks-band up toz=1.5 (deltam_j=-0.69+-0.12 and deltam_k=-0.54+-0.12 at z=1). moreover, we findthat red and early-type galaxies dominate the bright-end of the lf, and thattheir number density shows at most a small decrease (&lt;30%) up to z=1, thussuggesting that massive elliptical galaxies were already in place at z=1 andthey should have formed their stars and assembled their mass at higher z. thereappears to be a correlation of the optical/near-ir colors with near-irluminosities, the most luminous/massive galaxies being red/old. we find a slowevolution with z of the near-ir comoving luminosity density to z=1.5. finally,we show that hierarchical models overpredict significantly the density of lowluminosity galaxies at z&lt;=1 and underpredict the density of luminous galaxiesat z&gt;=1, whereas ple models are more consistent with the data up to z=1.5. thegif model (kaufmann et al. 1999) shows a clear deficiency of red luminousgalaxies at z=1 compared to our observations and predicts a decrease ofluminous galaxies with z not observed in our sample.

astro-ph;0303332	quasar evolution driven by galaxy encounters in hierarchical structures	we link the evolution of the galaxies in the hierarchical clustering scenariowith the changing accretion rates of cold gas onto the central massive blackholes that power the quasars. we base on galaxy interactions as main triggersof accretion; the related scaling laws are taken up from cavaliere &amp; vittorini(2000), and grafted to a semi-analytic code for galaxy formation. as a result,at high $z$ the protogalaxies grow rapidly by hierarchical merging; meanwhile,much fresh gas is imported and also destabilized, so the holes are fueled attheir full eddington rates. at lower $z$ the galactic dynamical events aremostly encounters in hierarchically growing groups; now the refueling petersout, as the residual gas is exhausted while the destabilizing encountersdwindle. so, with no parameter tuning other than needed for stellarobservables, our model uniquely produces at $z&gt;3$ a rise, and at $z\lesssim 2.5$ a decline of the bright quasar population as steep as observed. in addition,our results closely fit the observed luminosity functions of quasars, theirspace density at different magnitudes from $z\approx 5$ to $z\approx 0$, andthe local $m_{bh}-\sigma$ relation.

astro-ph;0307332	the assembly of massive galaxies from nir observations of the hubble  deep field south	we use a deep k(ab)&lt;25 galaxy sample in the hubble deep field south to tracethe evolution of the cosmological stellar mass density from z~ 0.5 to z~3. wefind clear evidence for a decrease of the average stellar mass density at highredshift, 2&lt;z&lt;3.2, that is 15^{+25}_{-5}% of the local value, two times higherthan what observed in the hubble deep field north. to take into account for theselection effects, we define a homogeneous subsample of galaxies with10^{10}m_\odot \leq m_* \leq 10^{11}m_\odot: in this sample, the mass densityat z&gt;2 is 20^{+20}_{-5} % of the local value. in the mass--limited subsample atz&gt;2, the fraction of passively fading galaxies is at most 25%, although theycan contribute up to about 40% of the stellar mass density. on the other hand,star--forming galaxies at z&gt;2 form stars with an average specific rate at least&lt;\dot m/m_*&gt; ~4 x10^{-10} yr$^{-1}$, 3 times higher than the z&lt;~1 value. thisimplies that uv bright star--forming galaxies are substancial contributors tothe rise of the stellar mass density with cosmic time. although these resultsare globally consistent with $\lambda$--cdm scenarios, the present rendition ofsemi analytic models fails to match the stellar mass density produced by moremassive galaxies present at z&gt;2.

astro-ph;0406157	cosmic star formation: constraints on the galaxy formation models	we study the evolution of the cosmic star formation by computing theluminosity density (ld) in the uv, b, j, and k bands, and the stellar massdensity (md) of galaxies in two reference models of galaxy evolution: the pureluminosity evolution (ple) model developed by calura &amp; matteucci (2003) and thesemi-analytical model (sam) of hierarchical galaxy formation by menci et al.(2002). the former includes a detailed description of the chemical evolution ofgalaxies of different morphological types with no density evolution; the latterincludes the merging histories of the galactic dm haloes, as predicted by thehierarchical clustering scenario, but it does not contain morphologicalclassification nor chemical evolution. we find that at z&lt; 1.5 both models areconsistent with the available data on the ld of galaxies in all the consideredbands. at high z, the lds predicted in the ple model show a peak due to theformation of ellipticals, whereas the sam predicts a gradual decrease of thestar formation and of the ld for z&gt; 2.5. at such redshifts the ple predictionstend to overestimate the present data in the b band whereas the sam tends tounderestimate the observed uv ld. as for the stellar md, the ple picturepredicts that nearly 50% and 85% of the present stellar mass are in place atz=4 and z=1, respectively. according to the sam, 50% and 60% of the presentstellar mass are in place at z=1.2 and z=1, respectively. both predictions fitthe observed md up to z=1. at z&gt;1, the ple model and the sam tend tooverestimate and underestimate the observed values, respectively. we discussthe origin of the above model results, and the role of observationaluncertainties (such as dust extinction) in comparing models with observations.

astro-ph;0410028	intracluster and intragroup entropy from quasar activity	we investigate how the hierarchical merging of dark matter halos, theradiative cooling of baryons, and the energy feedback from supernovae andactive galactic nuclei or quasars combine to govern the amount and the thermalstate of the hot plasma pervading groups and clusters of galaxies. we showthat, by itself, supernova preheating of the external gas flowing into clustersfalls short of explaining the observed x-ray scaling relations of the plasmaluminosity l_x or the plasma entropy k versus the x-ray temperature t. toaccount for the scaling laws from rich to poor clusters takes preheatingenhanced by the energy input from active galactic nuclei. in groups, on theother hand, the internal impacts of powerful quasars going off in membergalaxies can blow some plasma out of the structure. so they depress l_x andraise k to the observed average levels; meanwhile, the sporadic nature of suchimpulsive events generates the intrinsic component of the wide scatter apparentin the data. the same quasar feedback gives rise in groups to entropy profilesas steep as observed, a feature hard to explain with simple preheating schemes.finally, we argue a close connection of the l_x-t or the k-t relation with them_{\bullet}-\sigma correlation between the host velocity dispersion and themasses of the black holes, relics of the quasar activity.

astro-ph;0412044	the b-band luminosity function of red and blue galaxies up to z=3.5	we have explored the redshift evolution of the luminosity function of red andblue galaxies up to $z=3.5$. this was possible joining a deep i band compositegalaxy sample, which includes the spectroscopic k20 sample and the hdfssamples, with the deep $h_{ab}=26$ and $k_{ab}=25$ samples derived from thedeep nir images of the hubble deep fields north and south, respectively. about30% of the sample has spectroscopic redshifts and the remaining fractionwell-calibrated photometric redshifts. this allowed to select and measuregalaxies in the rest-frame blue magnitude up to $z\sim 3$ and to derive theredshift evolution of the b-band luminosity function of galaxies separated bytheir rest-frame $u-v$ color or specific (i.e. per unit mass) star-formationrate. the class separation was derived from passive evolutionary tracks or fromtheir observed bimodal distributions. both distributions appear bimodal atleast up to $z\sim 2$ and the locus of red/early galaxies is clearly identifiedup to these high redshifts. both luminosity and density evolutions are neededto describe the cosmological behaviour of the red/early and blue/latepopulations. the density evolution is greater for the early population with adecrease by one order of magnitude at $z\sim 2-3$ with respect to the value at$z\sim 0.4$. the luminosity densities of the early and late type galaxies with$m_b&lt;-20.6$ appear to have a bifurcation at $z&gt;1$. indeed while star-forminggalaxies slightly increase or keep constant their luminosity density, "early"galaxies decrease in their luminosity density by a factor $\sim 5-6$ from$z\sim 0.4$ to $z\sim 2.5-3$. a comparison with one of the latest versions ofthe hierarchical cdm models shows a broad agreement with the observed numberand luminosity density evolutions of both populations.

astro-ph;0506387	bimodal color distribution in hierarchical galaxy formation	we show how the observed bimodality in the color distribution of galaxies canbe explained in the framework of the hierarchical clustering picture in termsof the interplay between the properties of the merging histories and thefeedback/star-formation processes in the progenitors of local galaxies. using asemi-analytic model of hierarchical galaxy formation, we compute the colordistributions of galaxies with different luminosities and compare them with theobservations. our fiducial model matches the fundamental properties of theobserved distributions, namely: 1) the distribution of objects brighter thanm_r = -18 is clearly bimodal, with a fraction of red objects increasing withluminosity; 2) for objects brighter than m_r = -21 the color distribution isdominated by red objects with color u-r = 2.2-2.4; 3) the spread on thedistribution of the red population is smaller than that of the blue population;4) the fraction of red galaxies is larger in denser environments, even forlow-luminosity objects; 5) the bimodality in the distribution persists up to z= 1.5. we discuss the role of the different physical processes included in themodel in producing the above results.

astro-ph;0605123	the abundance of distant and extremely red galaxies: the role of agn  feedback in hierarchical models	we investigate the effect of agn feedback associated to the bright qso phaseonto the color distribution of galaxies from z=0 up to z=4. to this aim, weinsert a blast-wave model of agn feedback in our semi-analytic model of galaxyformation, which includes the growth of supermassive black holes and the agnactivity triggered by interactions of the host galaxies. the agn feedback isdirectly related to the impulsive, luminous quasar phase. we test our model bychecking the consistency of its results against i) the qso luminosity functionsfrom z=0 to z=4; ii) the observed local relation between the black hole massm_{bh} and the mass of the host galaxy. at low redshift the inclusion of agnfeedback enhances the number of red bright galaxies, so that the colordistribution of m_r&lt;-22 objects is entirely dominated by red (u-r&gt;1.5)galaxies; at 0.5&lt; z&lt; 2 it yields rest-frame u-v color distribution in agreementwith existing observations. in the range z=1.5-2.5, we find that 31% ofgalaxies contribute to the eros population with m_k&lt;20 (vega system); at such amagnitude, the model yields an eros surface density of 6.3 10^3 /deg^2 matchingexisting data; about 80 % of the above density is contributed by passivegalaxies with old stellar populations. extending our analysis to z=4, the modelmatches the observed surface density 1.5 10^3 /deg^2 of drgs at m_k=20; such apopulation is predicted to be dominated by galaxies with old stellarpopulations for z&gt;2.5.

astro-ph;9802185	diffuse baryons in groups and clusters of galaxies	to predict the x-ray observables associated to the diffuse baryons inclusters of galaxies, we develop a new physical approach to model such a hotintra-cluster plasma. such approach is based on punctuated equilibria. andcomprises the following blocks: monte carlo ``merging histories'' of darkmatter potential wells; the central hydrostatic disposition for the icp, resetto a new equilibrium after each merging episode; conditions of shock, or ofclosely adiabatic compression at the boundary with the external gas, preheatedby stellar energy feedbacks. we predict the l-t relation, consistent with thedata as for shape and scatter. this we combine with the mass distributionprovided by the hierarchical clustering for different cobe-normalized cdmmodels, to predict the z-resolved luminosity functions, the source counts, theredshift distributions and contribution of the unresolved groups and clustersto the soft x-ray background. when compared with the recent rosat surveys, ourresults confirm that the critical cosmology with standard cdm is ruled out byits overproduction of local clusters. on account of underproduction, instead,we rule out open cosmologies except for a narrow range around \omega_o=0.5;even there, we find the consistency with the full data base to be hardlymarginal. for \omega_o=0.3 in flat geometry, we obtain acceptable fits. for thetilted cdm perturbation spectrum with high baryonic content in the criticaluniverse, we obtain marginal consistency. finally, we discuss the effectivelimitations of x-ray clusters and groups as cosmological signposts, and theirbrighter prospects toward the astrophysics of the icp and the cosmogony oflarge, high-contrast structures.

astro-ph;9810498	hot gas in clusters of galaxies: the punctuated equilibria model	we develop a model to describe the evolution of the intra-cluster x-rayemitting baryons, as they are included in the dark matter potential wells ofgalaxy clusters evolving through subsequent merging events in the framework ofhierarchical clustering. the gas is assumed to re-adjusts to a new hydrostaticequilibrium after each merging event. before merging it is gravitationallyheated at the local virial temperature when bound in subclusters; at early $z$the gas is preheated by supernova activity following star formation. in detail,we compute analytically the following steps: the dynamic histories of darkmatter halos with their merging events; the associated infall of gas into ahalo, with compressions and shocks estabilishing the conditions at the clusterboundary; the updated disposition of the gas in the potential well matchingsuch conditions; the statistical convolution of the key quantities over themerging histories. the model predicts the density and surface brightnessprofiles with no free parameters; the so-called $\beta$ parameter is itself anoutcome of the model, and the polytropic index $\gamma$ is internallyconstrained to a narrow range. we obtain declining temperature profiles, andprofiles for the density and for the surface brightness shallower in groupscompared with clusters. our model groups also contain a lower baryonic fractionon average, but with a scatter considerably larger than at cluster scales.various statistics are obtained analytically upon averaging over the merginghistories. in particular, we predict in different cosmologies the statisticalcorrelation $l-t$ of luminosity with temperature; similarly we derivethecorrelation $r_x-t$ for the size of the x-ray emitting region. the intrinsicscatter in both correlations is also predicted.

astro-ph;9909259	the history of cosmic baryons: x-ray emission vs. star formation rate	we relate the star formation from cold baryons in virialized structures tothe x-ray properties of the associated diffuse, hot baryonic component. ourcomputations use the standard ``semi-analytic'' models to describe i) theevolution of dark matter halos through merging after the hierarchicalclustering, ii) the star formation governed by radiative cooling and bysupernova feedback, iii) the hydro- and thermodynamics of the hot gas, renderedwith our punctuated equilibria model. so we relate the x-ray observablesconcerning the intra-cluster medium to the thermal energy of the gas pre-heatedand expelled by supernovae following star formation, and then accreted duringthe subsequent merging events. we show that at fluxes fainter than $f_x\approx10^{-15}$ erg/cm$^2 $ s (well within the reach of next generation x-rayobservatories) the x-ray counts of extended extragalactic sources (as well asthe faint end of the luminosity function, the contribution to the soft x-raybackground, and the $l_x-t$ correlation at the group scales) increaseconsiderably when the star formation rate is enhanced for z&gt;1 as indicated bygrowing optical/infrared evidence. specifically, the counts in the range 0.5-2kev are increased by factors $\sim 4$ when the the feedback is decreased andstar formation is enhanced as to yield a flat shape of the star formation ratefor 2&lt;z&lt;4.

astro-ph;9910537	the evolution of the galaxy sizes in the ntt deep field: a comparison  with cdm models	the sizes of the field galaxies with i&lt;25 have been measured in the ntt deepfield. intrinsic sizes have been obtained after deconvolution of the psf with amultigaussian method. the reliability of the method has been tested using bothsimulated data and hst observations of the same field. the distribution of thehalf light radii is peaked at r_{hl} 0.3 arcsec, in good agreement with thatderived from hst images at the same magnitude. an approximate morphologicalclassification has been obtained using the asymmetry and concentrationparameters. the intrinsic sizes of the galaxies are shown as a function oftheir redshifts and absolute magnitudes using photometric redshifts derivedfrom the multicolor catalog. while the brighter galaxies with morphologicalparameters typical of the normal spirals show a flat distribution in the ranger_{d}=1-6 kpc, the fainter population at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8 dominates at small sizes. toexplore the significance of this behaviour, an analytical rendition of thestandard cdm model for the disc size evolution has been computed. the modelshowing the best fit to the local luminosity function and the tully-fisherrelation is able to reproduce at intermediate redshifts a size distribution ingeneral agreement with the observations, although it tends to underestimate thenumber of galaxies fainter than m_b~ -19 with disk sizes r_d~ 1-2 kpc.

astro-ph;9912374	x-raying the star formation history of the universe	the current models of early star and galaxy formation are based upon thehierarchical growth of dark matter halos, within which the baryons condenseinto stars after cooling down from a hot diffuse phase. the latter isreplenished by infall of outer gas into the halo potential wells; this includesa fraction previously expelled and preheated, due to momentum and energy fedback by the sne which follow the star formation. we identify such an impliedhot phase with the medium known to radiate powerful x-rays in clusters and ingroups of galaxies. we show that the amount of the hot component required bythe current star formation models is enough to be observable out to redshifts$z \approx 1.5$ in forthcoming deep surveys from {\it chandra} and {\it xmm},especially in case the star formation rate is high at such and earlier $z$.these x-ray emissions constitute a necessary counterpart, and will provide amuch wanted probe of the sf process itself (in particular, of the sn feedback),to parallel and complement the currently debated data from optical and irobservations of the young stars.

0810.0720	chasing highly obscured qsos in the cosmos field	(abridged) we take advantage of the deep chandra and spitzer coverage of alarge area (more than 10 times the area covered by the chandra deep fields,cdfs in the cosmos field, to extend the search of highly obscured,compton-thick active nuclei to higher luminosity. these sources have lowsurface density and large samples can be provided only through large areasurveys, like the cosmos survey. we analyze the x-ray properties of cosmos mipssources with 24$\mu$m fluxes higher than 550$\mu$jy. for the mips sources notdirectly detected in the chandra images we produce stacked images in soft andhard x-rays bands. to estimate the fraction of compton-thick agn in the mipssource population we compare the observed stacked count rates and hardnessratios to those predicted by detailed monte carlo simulations including bothobscured agn and star-forming galaxies. the density of lower luminositycompton-thick agn (logl(2-10kev)=43.5-44) at z=0.7--1.2 is $(3.7\pm1.1)\times10^{-5}$ mpc$^{-3}$, corresponding to $\sim67%$ of that of x-ray selectedagn. the comparison between the fraction of infrared selected, compton thickagn to the x-ray selected, unobscured and moderately obscured agn at high andlow luminosity suggests that compton-thick agn follow a luminosity dependencesimilar to that discovered for compton-thin agn, becoming relatively rarer athigh luminosities. we estimate that the fraction of agn (unobscured, moderatelyobscured and compton thick) to the total mips source population is $49\pm10%$,a value significantly higher than that previously estimated at similar 24$\mu$mfluxes. we discuss how our findings can constrain agn feedback models.
