0903.1086	type ia supernova science 2010-2020	in the next decade type ia supernovae (sne ia) will be used to test theoriespredicting changes in the dark energy equation of state with time. ultimatelythis requires a dedicated space mission like jdem. sne ia are maturecosmological probes --- their limitations are well characterized, and a path toimprovement is clear. dominant systematic errors include photometriccalibration, selection effects, reddening, and population-dependentdifferences. building on past lessons, well-controlled new surveys are poisedto make strides in these areas: the palomar transient factory, skymapper, lasilla quest, pan-starrs, the dark energy survey, lsst, and jdem. they willobviate historical calibrations and selection biases, and allow comparisons vialarge subsamples. some systematics follow from our ignorance of sn iaprogenitors, which there is hope of determining with sn ia rate studies from0&lt;z&lt;4.  aside from cosmology, sne ia regulate galactic and cluster chemicalevolution, inform stellar evolution, and are laboratories for extreme physics.essential probes of sne ia in these contexts include spectroscopy from the uvto the ir, x-ray cluster and sn remnant observations, spectropolarimetry, andadvanced theoretical studies. while there are an abundance of discoveryfacilities planned, there is a deficit of follow-up resources. living in thesystematics era demands deep understanding rather than larger statistics. noaorestar initiative to build 2-4m telescopes would provide necessary follow-upcapability. finally, to fully exploit lsst, well-matched wide-fieldspectroscopic capabilities are desirable.

0906.0982	subaru high-resolution spectroscopy of star g in the tycho supernova  remnant	it is widely believed that type ia supernovae (sn ia) originate in binarysystems where a white dwarf accretes material from a companion star until itsmass approaches the chandrasekhar mass and carbon is ignited in the whitedwarf's core. this scenario predicts that the donor star should survive thesupernova explosion, providing an opportunity to understand the progenitors oftype ia supernovae.in this paper we argue that rotation is a generic signatureexpected of most non-giant donor stars that is easily measurable.\citep{2004natur.431.1069r} examined stars in the center of the remnant of sn1572 (tycho's sn) and showed evidence that a subgiant star (star g by theirnaming convention) near the remnant's centre was the system's donor star. wepresent high-resolution (r \simeq 40000) spectra taken with the high dispersionspectrograph on subaru of this candidate donor star and measure the star'sradial velocity as $79\pm 2$ \kms with respect to the lsr and put an upperlimit on the star's rotation of 7.5 \kms. in addition, by comparing images thatwere taken in 1970 and 2004, we measure the proper motion of star g to be$\mu_l = -1.6 \pm 2.1$ \masyr and $\mu_b = -2.7 \pm 1.6$ \masyr. we demonstratethat all of the measured properties of star g presented in this paper areconsistent with those of a star in the direction of tycho's sn that is notassociated with the supernova event. however, we discuss an unlikely, but stillviable scenario for star g to be the donor star, and suggest furtherobservations that might be able to confirm or refute it.

0906.2811	a massive star origin for an unusual helium-rich supernova in an  elliptical galaxy	the unusual helium-rich (type ib) supernova sn 2005e is distinguished fromany supernova hitherto observed by its faint and rapidly fading light curve,prominent calcium lines in late-phase spectra and lack of any mark of recentstar formation near the supernova location. these properties are claimed to beexplained by a helium detonation in a thin surface layer of an accreting whitedwarf (perets et al. 2010). here we report on observations of sn 2005czappeared in an elliptical galaxy, whose observed properties resemble those ofsn 2005e in that it is helium-rich and unusually faint, fades rapidly, showsmuch weaker oxygen emission lines than those of calcium in the well-evolvedspectrum. we argue that these properties are best explained by a core-collapsesupernova at the low-mass end ($8-12 m_{\odot}$) of the range of massive starsthat explode (smartt 2009). such a low mass progenitor had lost itshydrogen-rich envelope through binary interaction, having very thin oxygen-richand silicon-rich layers above the collapsing core, thus ejecting a very smallamount of radioactive $^{56}$ni and oxygen. although the host galaxy ngc 4589is an elliptical, some studies have revealed evidence of recent star-formationactivity (zhang et al. 2008), consistent with the core-collapse scenario.

0908.2162	properties of type ii plateau supernova snls-04d2dc: multicolor light  curves of shock breakout and plateau	shock breakout is the brightest radiative phenomenon in a type ii supernova(sn). although it was predicted to be bright, the direct observation isdifficult due to the short duration and x-ray/ultraviolet-peaked spectra. firstentire observations of the shock breakouts of type ii plateau sne (sne iip)were reported in 2008 by ultraviolet and optical observations by the {\itgalex} satellite and supernova legacy survey (snls), named snls-04d2dc andsnls-06d1jd. we present multicolor light curves of a sn iip, including theshock breakout and plateau, calculated with a multigroup radiationhydrodynamical code {\sc stella} and an evolutionary progenitor model. thesynthetic multicolor light curves reproduce well the observations ofsnls-04d2dc. this is the first study to reproduce the ultraviolet light curveof the shock breakout and the optical light curve of the plateau consistently.we conclude that snls-04d2dc is the explosion with a canonical explosion energy$1.2\times10^{51}$ ergs and that its progenitor is a star with a zero-agemain-sequence mass $20m_\odot$ and a presupernova radius $800r_\odot$. themodel demonstrates that the peak apparent $b$-band magnitude of the shockbreakout would be $m_{\rm b}\sim26.4$ mag if a sn being identical tosnls-04d2dc occurs at a redshift $z=1$, which can be reached by 8m-classtelescopes. the result evidences that the shock breakout has a great potentialto detect sne iip at $z\gsim1$.

0707.2187	nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae and grb--metal-poor star  connection	we review the nucleosynthesis yields of core-collapse supernovae (sne) forvarious stellar masses, explosion energies, and metallicities. comparison withthe abundance patterns of metal-poor stars provides excellent opportunities totest the explosion models and their nucleosynthesis. we show that the abundancepatterns of extremely metal-poor (emp) stars, e.g., the excess of c, co, znrelative to fe, are in better agreement with the yields of hyper-energeticexplosions (hypernovae, hne) rather than normal supernovae.  we note that the variation of the abundance patterns of emp stars are relatedto the diversity of the supernova-grb connection. we summarize the diverseproperties of (1) grb-sne, (2) non-grb hne/sne, (3) xrf-sn, and (4) non-sn grb.in particular, the non-sn grbs (dark hypernovae) have been predicted in orderto explain the origin of c-rich emp stars. we show that these variations andthe connection can be modeled in a unified manner with the explosions inducedby relativistic jets. finally, we examine whether the most luminous supernova2006gy can be consistently explained with the pair-instability supernova model.

1003.3717	"dark" grb 080325 in a dusty massive galaxy at z ~ 2	we present optical and near infrared observations of grb 080325 classified asa "dark grb". near-infrared observations with subaru/moircs provided a cleardetection of afterglow in ks band, although no optical counterpart wasreported. the flux ratio of rest-wavelength optical to x-ray bands of theafterglow indicates that the dust extinction along the line of sight to theafterglow is av = 2.7 - 10 mag. this large extinction is probably the majorreason for optical faintness of grb 080325. the j - ks color of the hostgalaxy, (j - ks = 1.3 in ab magnitude), is significantly redder than those fortypical grb hosts previously identified. in addition to j and ks bands, opticalimages in b, rc, i', and z' bands with subaru/suprime-cam were obtained atabout one year after the burst, and a photometric redshift of the host isestimated to be z_{photo} = 1.9. the host luminosity is comparable to l^{*} atz \sim 2 in contrast to the sub-l^{*} property of typical grb hosts at lowerredshifts. the best-fit stellar population synthesis model for the host showsthat a large dust extinction (av = 0.8 mag) attributes to the red nature of thehost and that the host galaxy is massive (m_{*} = 7.0 \times 10^{10} msun)which is one of the most massive grb hosts previously identified. by assumingthat the mass-metallicity relation for star-forming galaxies at z \sim 2 isapplicable for the grb host, this large stellar mass suggests the highmetallicity environment around grb 080325, consistent with inferred largeextinction.

0708.0966	the aspherical properties of the energetic type ic sn 2002ap as inferred  from its nebular spectra	the nebular spectra of the broad-lined, sn 1998bw-like type ic sn 2002ap arestudied by means of synthetic spectra. two different modelling techniques areemployed. in one technique, the sn ejecta are treated as a single zone, whilein the other a density and abundance distribution in velocity is used from anexplosion model. in both cases, heating caused by gamma-ray and positrondeposition is computed (in the latter case using a monte carlo technique todescribe the propagation of gamma-rays and positrons), as is cooling viaforbidden-line emission. the results are compared, and although generalagreement is found, the stratified models are shown to reproduce the observedline profiles much more accurately than the single-zone model. the explosionproduced ~ 0.1 msun of 56ni. the distribution in velocity of the variouselements is in agreement with that obtained from the early-time models, whichindicated an ejected mass of ~ 2.5 msun with a kinetic energy of 4 x 10^{51}erg. nebular spectroscopy confirms that most of the ejected mass (~ 1.2 msun)was oxygen. the presence of an oxygen-rich inner core, combined with that of56ni at high velocities as deduced from early-time models, suggests that theexplosion was asymmetric, especially in the inner part.

1006.2213	observations of the optical transient in ngc 300 with akari/irc:  possibilities of asymmetric dust formation	we present the results of near-infrared (nir) multi-epoch observations of theoptical transient in the nearby galaxy ngc300 (ngc300-ot) at 398 and 582 daysafter the discovery with the infrared camera (irc) onboard akari. nir spectra(2--5 um) of ngc300-ot were obtained for the first time. they show no prominentemission nor absorption features, but are dominated by continuum thermalemission from the dust around ngc300-ot. nir images were taken in the 2.4, 3.2,and 4.1 um bands. the spectral energy distributions (sed) of ngc300-ot indicatethe dust temperature of 810 (+-14) k at 398 days and 670 (+-12) k at 582 days.we attribute the observed nir emission to the thermal emission from dust grainsformed in the ejecta of ngc300-ot. the multi-epoch observations enable us toestimate the dust optical depth as larger than about 12 at 398 days and largerthan about 6 at 582 days at 2.4 um, by assuming an isothermal dust cloud. theobserved nir emission must be optically thick, unless the amount of dust grainsincreases with time. little extinction at visible wavelengths reported inearlier observations suggests that the dust cloud around ngc300-ot should bedistributed inhomogeneously so as to not screen the radiation from the ejectagas and the central star. the present results suggest the dust grains are notformed in spherically symmetric geometry, but rather in a torus, a bipolaroutflow, or clumpy cloudlets.

1006.5888	an asymmetric explosion as the origin of spectral evolution diversity in  type ia supernovae	type ia supernovae (sne ia) form an observationally uniform class of stellarexplosions, in that more luminous objects have smaller decline-rates. thisone-parameter behavior allows sne ia to be calibrated as cosmological `standardcandles', and led to the discovery of an accelerating universe. recentinvestigations, however, have revealed that the true nature of sne ia is morecomplicated. theoretically, it has been suggested that the initialthermonuclear sparks are ignited at an offset from the centre of thewhite-dwarf (wd) progenitor, possibly as a result of convection before theexplosion. observationally, the diversity seen in the spectral evolution of sneia beyond the luminosity decline-rate relation is an unresolved issue. here wereport that the spectral diversity is a consequence of random directions fromwhich an asymmetric explosion is viewed. our findings suggest that the spectralevolution diversity is no longer a concern in using sne ia as cosmologicalstandard candles. furthermore, this indicates that ignition at an offset fromthe centre of is a generic feature of sne ia.

1201.1225	the effect of 12c + 12c rate uncertainties on the evolution and  nucleosynthesis of massive stars	[shortened] the 12c + 12c fusion reaction has been the subject ofconsiderable experimental efforts to constrain uncertainties at temperaturesrelevant for stellar nucleosynthesis. in order to investigate the effect of anenhanced carbon burning rate on massive star structure and nucleosynthesis, newstellar evolution models and their yields are presented exploring the impact ofthree different 12c + 12c reaction rates. non-rotating stellar models weregenerated using the geneva stellar evolution code and were later post-processedwith the nugrid multi-zone post-processing network tool. the enhanced ratecauses core carbon burning to be ignited more promptly and at lowertemperature. this reduces the neutrino losses, which increases the core carbonburning lifetime. an increased carbon burning rate also increases the upperinitial mass limit for which a star exhibits a convective carbon core. carbonshell burning is also affected, with fewer convective-shell episodes andconvection zones that tend to be larger in mass. consequently, the chance of anoverlap between the ashes of carbon core burning and the following carbon shellconvection zones is increased, which can cause a portion of the ashes of carboncore burning to be included in the carbon shell. therefore, during thesupernova explosion, the ejecta will be enriched by s-process nuclidessynthesized from the carbon core s process. the yields were used to estimatethe weak s-process component in order to compare with the solar systemabundance distribution. the enhanced rate models were found to produce asignificant proportion of kr, sr, y, zr, mo, ru, pd and cd in the weakcomponent, which is primarily the signature of the carbon-core s process.consequently, it is shown that the production of isotopes in the kr-sr regioncan be used to constrain the 12c + 12c rate using the current branching ratiofor a- and p-exit channels.

0801.2015	early formation of dust in the ejecta of type ib sn 2006jc and  temperature and mass of the dust	sn 2006jc is a peculiar supernova (sn), in which the formation of dust hasbeen confirmed at an early epoch of ~50 days after the explosion. weinvestigate the possibility of such an earlier formation of dust grains in theexpanding ejecta of sn 2006jc, applying the type ib sn model that is developedto reproduce the observed light curve. we find that the rapid decrease of thegas temperature in sn 2006jc enables the condensation of c grains in the c-richlayer at 40-60 days after the explosion, which is followed by the condensationof silicate and oxide grains until ~200 days. the average radius of each grainspecies is confined to be less than 0.01 micron due to the low gas density atthe condensation time. the calculated total dust mass reaches ~1.5 msun, ofwhich c dust shares 0.7 msun. on the other hand, based on the calculated dusttemperature, we show that the dust species and mass evaluated to reproduce thespectral energy distribution observed by akari and magnum at day 200 aredifferent from those obtained by the dust formation calculations; the dustspecies contributing to the observed flux are hot c and fes grains with massesof $5.6 \times 10^{-4}$ msun and $2.0 \times 10^{-3}$ msun, respectively,though we cannot defy the presence of a large amount of cold dust such assilicate and oxide grains up to 0.5 msun. one of the physical processesresponsible for the difference between calculated and evaluated masses of c andfes grains could be considered to be the destruction of small-sized clusters byenergetic photons and electrons prevailing within the ejecta at the earlierepoch.

1308.0406	properties of newly formed dust grains in the luminous type iin  supernova 2010jl	supernovae (sne) have been proposed to be the main production sites of dustgrains in the universe. our knowledge on their importance to dust productionis, however, limited by observationally poor constraints on the nature andamount of dust particles produced by individual sne. in this paper, we presenta spectrum covering optical through near-infrared (nir) light of the luminoustype iin supernova (sn iin) 2010jl around one and half years after theexplosion. this unique data set reveals multiple signatures of newly formeddust particles. the nir portion of the spectrum provides a rare example wherethermal emission from newly formed hot dust grains is clearly detected. wedetermine the main population of the dust species to be carbon grains at atemperature of ~1,350 - 1,450k at this epoch. the mass of the dust grains isderived to be ~(7.5 - 8.5) x 10^{-4} msun. hydrogen emission lines showwavelength-dependent absorption, which provides a good estimate on the typicalsize of the newly formed dust grains (~0.1 micron, and most likely &lt;~0.01micron). we attribute the dust grains to have been formed in a dense coolingshell as a result of a strong sn-circumstellar media (csm) interaction. thedust grains occupy ~10% of the emitting volume, suggesting an inhomogeneous,clumpy structure. the average csm density is required to be &gt;~3 x 10^{7}cm^{-3}, corresponding to a mass loss rate of &gt;~0.02 msun yr^{-1} (for a massloss wind velocity of ~100 km s^{-1}). this strongly supports a scenario thatsn 2010jl and probably other luminous sne iin are powered by stronginteractions within very dense csm, perhaps created by luminous blue variable(lbv)-like eruptions within the last century before the explosion.

1311.3645	multi-epoch high-spectral-resolution observations of neutral sodium in  14 type ia supernovae	one of the main questions concerning type ia supernovae is the nature of thebinary companion of the exploding white dwarf. a major discriminant betweendifferent suggested models is the presence and physical properties ofcircumstellar material at the time of explosion. if present, this material willbe ionized by the ultra-violet radiation of the explosion and later recombine.this ionization-recombination should manifest itself as time-variableabsorption features that can be detected via multi-epochhigh-spectral-resolution observations. previous studies have shown that thestrongest effect is seen in the neutral sodium d lines. we report onobservations of neutral sodium absorption features observed in multi-epochhigh-resolution spectra of 14 type ia supernova events. this is the firstmulti-epoch high-resolution study to include multiple sne. no variability inline strength that can be associated with circumstellar material is detected.we find that ~18% of the events in the extended sample exhibit time-variablesodium features associated with circumstellar material. we explore theimplication of this study on our understanding of the progenitor systems oftype ia supernovae via the current type ia supernova multi-epochhigh-spectral-resolution sample.

1504.04857	nebular spectra and abundance tomography of the type ia supernova sn  2011fe: a normal sn ia with a stable fe core	a series of optical and one near-infrared nebular spectra covering the firstyear of the type ia supernova sn 2011fe are presented and modelled. the densityprofile that proved best for the early optical/ultraviolet spectra, "rho-11fe",was extended to lower velocities to include the regions that emit at nebularepochs. model rho-11fe is intermediate between the fast deflagration model w7and a low-energy delayed-detonation. good fits to the nebular spectra areobtained if the innermost ejecta are dominated by neutron-rich, stable fe-groupspecies, which contribute to cooling but not to heating. the correct thermalbalance can thus be reached for the strongest [feii] and [feiii] lines to bereproduced with the observed ratio. the 56ni mass thus obtained is 0.47 +/-0.05 mo. the bulk of 56ni has an outermost velocity of ~8500 km/s. the mass ofstable iron is 0.23 +/- 0.03 mo. stable ni has low abundance, ~10^{-2} mo. thisis sufficient to reproduce an observed emission line near 7400 a. asub-chandrasekhar explosion model with mass 1.02 mo and no central stable fedoes not reproduce the observed line ratios. a mock model where neutron-richfe-group species are located above 56ni following recent suggestions is alsoshown to yield spectra that are less compatible with the observations. thedensities and abundances in the inner layers obtained from the nebularanalysis, combined with those of the outer layers previously obtained, are usedto compute a synthetic bolometric light curve, which compares favourably withthe light curve of sn 2011fe.

1504.06668	type iib supernova 2013df entering into an interaction phase: a link  between the progenitor and the mass loss	we report the late-time evolution of type iib supernova (sn iib) 2013df. sn2013df showed a dramatic change in its spectral features at ~1 year after theexplosion. early on it showed typical characteristics shared by sne iib/ib/icdominated by metal emission lines, while later on it was dominated by broad andflat-topped halpha and he i emissions. the late-time spectra are strikinglysimilar to sn iib 1993j, which is the only previous example clearly showing thesame transition. this late-time evolution is fully explained by a change in theenergy input from the $^{56}$co decay to the interaction between the sn ejectaand dense circumstellar matter (csm). the mass loss rate is derived to be ~(5.4+- 3.2) x 10^{-5} msun/yr (for the wind velocity of ~20 km/s), similar to sn1993j but larger than sn iib 2011dh by an order of magnitude. the strikingsimilarity between sne 2013df and 1993j in the (candidate) progenitors and thecsm environments, and the contrast in these natures to sn 2011dh, infer thatthere is a link between the natures of the progenitor and the mass loss: sneiib with a more extended progenitor have experienced a much stronger mass lossin the final centuries toward the explosion. it might indicate that sne iibfrom a more extended progenitor are the explosions during a strong binaryinteraction phase, while those from a less extended progenitor have a delaybetween the strong binary interaction and the explosion.

0705.2713	the unique type ib supernova 2005bf at nebular phases: a possible birth  event of a strongly magnetized neutron star	late phase nebular spectra and photometry of type ib supernova (sn) 2005bftaken by the subaru telescope at ~ 270 and ~ 310 days since the explosion arepresented. emission lines ([oi]6300, 6363, [caii]7291, 7324, [feii]7155) showthe blueshift of ~ 1,500 - 2,000 km s-1. the [oi] doublet shows a doubly-peakedprofile. the line luminosities can be interpreted as coming from a blob or jetcontaining only ~ 0.1 - 0.4 msun, in which ~ 0.02 - 0.06 msun is 56nisynthesized at the explosion. to explain the blueshift, the blob should eitherbe of unipolar moving at the center-of-mass velocity v ~ 2,000 - 5,000 km s-1,or suffer from self-absorption within the ejecta as seen in sn 1990i. in bothinterpretations, the low-mass blob component dominates the optical output bothat the first peak (~ 20 days) and at the late phase (~ 300 days). the lowluminosity at the late phase (the absolute r magnitude m_r ~ -10.2 mag at ~ 270days) sets the upper limit for the mass of 56ni &lt; ~ 0.08 msun, which is incontradiction to the value necessary to explain the second, main peakluminosity (m_r ~ -18.3 mag at ~ 40 days). encountered by this difficulty inthe 56ni heating model, we suggest an alternative scenario in which the heatingsource is a newly born, strongly magnetized neutron star (a magnetar) with thesurface magnetic field bmag ~ 10^{14-15} gauss and the initial spin period p0 ~10 ms. then, sn 2005bf could be a link between normal sne ib/c and an x-rayflash associated sn 2006aj, connected in terms of bmag and/or p0.

astro-ph;0101476	element synthesis in stars	except for 1h, 2h, 3he, 4he, and 7li, originating from the big bang, allheavier elements are made in stellar evolution and stellar explosions. nuclearphysics, and in many cases nuclear structure far from stability, enters in acrucial way. therefore, we examine in this review the role of nuclear physicsin astrophysics in general and in particular how it affects stellar events andthe resulting nucleosynthesis. stellar modeling addresses four major aspects:1. energy generation and nucleosynthesis, 2. energy transport via conduction,radiation or possibly convection, 3. hydrodynamics/hydrostatics, and finally 4.thermodynamic properties of the matter involved. nuclear physics enters vianuclear reaction cross sections and nuclear structure (affecting thecomposition changes and nuclear energy generation), neutrino-nucleon andneutrino-nucleus cross sections (affecting neutrino opacities and transport),and e.g. the equation of state at and beyond nuclear densities which creates arelation between the nuclear many-body problem and the hydrodynamic responselike pressure and entropy. in the following we review these four topics byhighlighting the role and impact of nuclear physics in each of these aspects ofstellar modeling. the main emphasis is put on the connection to elementsynthesis.

0808.1441	injection of short-lived radionuclides into the early solar system from  a faint supernova with mixing-fallback	several short-lived radionuclides (slrs) were present in the early solarsystem, some of which should have formed just prior to or soon after the solarsystem formation. stellar nucleosynthesis has been proposed as the mechanismfor production of slrs in the solar system, but no appropriate stellar sourcehas been found to explain the abundances of all solar system slrs.  in this study, we propose a faint supernova with mixing and fallback as astellar source of slrs with mean lives of &lt;5 myr (26al, 41ca, 53mn, and 60fe)in the solar system. in such a supernova, the inner region of the explodingstar experiences mixing, a small fraction of mixed materials is ejected, andthe rest undergoes fallback onto the core. the modeled slr abundances agreewell with their solar system abundances if mixing-fallback occurs within thec/o-burning layer. in some cases, the initial solar system abundances of theslrs can be reproduced within a factor of 2. the dilution factor of supernovaejecta to the solar system materials is ~10e-4 and the time interval betweenthe supernova explosion and the formation of oldest solid materials in thesolar system is ~1 myr. if the dilution occurred due to spherically symmetricexpansion, a faint supernova should have occurred nearby the solar systemforming region in a star cluster.

(1999) showed that the stellar companion of the black-holebinary nova sco is polluted with material ejected in the supernova thataccompanied the formation of the black-hole primary. here we systematicallyinvestigate the implications of these observations for the black-hole formationprocess. using a variety of supernova models, including both standard as wellas hypernova models (for different helium-star masses, explosion energies, andexplosion geometries) and a simple model for the evolution of the binary andthe pollution of the secondary, we show that most of the observed abundanceanomalies can be explained for a large range of model parameters (apart fromthe abundance of ti). the best models are obtained for he star masses of 10 to16 msun, where spherical hypernova models are generally favoured over standardsupernova ones. aspherical hypernova models also produce acceptable fits,provided there is extensive lateral mixing. all models require substantialfallback and that the fallback material either reached the orbit of thesecondary or was mixed efficiently with material that escaped. the black holetherefore formed in a two-step process, where the initial mass of the collapsedremnant was increased substantially by matter that fell back after the initialcollapse. this may help to explain the high observed space velocity of nova scoeither because of a neutrino-induced kick (if a neutron star was formed first)or by asymmetric mass ejection in an asymmetric supernova explosion.

astro-ph;0304010	the optical/near-infrared light curves of sn 2002ap for the first 140  days after discovery	supernova (sn) 2002ap in m74 was observed in the $ubvrijhk$ bands for thefirst 40 days following its discovery (2002 january 29) until it disappearedbecause of solar conjunction, and then in june after it reappeared. themagnitudes and dates of peak brightness in each band were determined. while therate of increase of the brightness before the peak is almost independent ofwavelength, the subsequent rate of decrease becomes smaller with wavelengthfrom the $u$ to the $r$ band, and is constant at wavelengths beyond $i$. thephotometric evolution is faster than in the well-known ``hypernovae''sne~1998bw and 1997ef, indicating that sn 2002ap ejected less mass. thebolometric light curve of sn 2002ap for the full period of observations wasconstructed. the absolute magnitude is found to be much fainter than that of sn1998bw, but is similar to that of sn 1997ef, which lies at the faint end of thehypernova population. the bolometric light curve at the early epochs was bestreproduced with the explosion of a c+o star that ejects $2.5~m_\sun$ withkinetic energy $e_{\rm k}=4\times 10^{51}~{\rm ergs}$. a comparison of thepredicted brightness of sn 2002ap with that observed after solar conjunctionmay imply that $\gamma$-ray deposition at the later epochs was more efficientthan in the model. this may be due to an asymmetric explosion.

astro-ph;0304172	bipolar supernova explosions: nucleosynthesis &amp; implication on  abundances in extremely metal-poor stars	hydrodynamics and explosive nucleosynthesis in bipolar supernova explosionsare examined to account for some peculiar properties of hypernovae as well aspeculiar abundance patterns of metal-poor stars. the explosion is supposed tobe driven by bipolar jets which are powered by accretion onto a centralremnant. we explore the features of the explosions with varying progenitors'masses and jet properties. the outcomes are different from conventionalspherical models. (1) in the bipolar models, fe-rich materials are ejected athigh velocities along the jet axis, while o-rich materials occupy the centralregion whose density becomes very high as a consequence of continuous accretionfrom the side. this configuration can explain some peculiar features in thelight curves and the nebular spectra of hypernovae. (2) production of $^{56}$nitends to be smaller than in spherical thermal bomb models. to account for alarge amount of $^{56}$ni observed in hypernovae, the jets should be initiatedwhen the compact remnant mass is still smaller than $2-3\msun$, or the jetsshould be very massive and slow. (3) ejected isotopes are distributed asfollows in order of decreasing velocities: $^{64}$zn, $^{59}$co, $^{56}$fe,$^{44}$ti, and $^{4}$he at the highest velocities, $^{55}$mn, $^{52}$cr,$^{32}$s, and $^{28}$si at the intermediate velocities, and $^{24}$mg, $^{16}$oat the lowest velocities. (4) the abundance ratios (zn, co)/fe are enhancedwhile the ratios (mn, cr)/fe are suppressed. this can account for the abundancepattern of extremely metal-poor stars. these agreements between the models andobservations suggest that hypernovae are driven by bipolar jets and havesignificantly contributed to the early galactic chemical evolution.

astro-ph;0305182	a two-component model for the light curves of hypernovae	the light curves of 'hypernovae', i.e. very energetic supernovae with $e_{51}\equiv e/10^{51}$ergs $\gsim 5-10$ are characterized at epochs of a few monthsby a phase of linear decline. classical, one-dimensional explosion models failto simultaneously reproduce the light curve near peak and at the linear declinephase. the evolution of these light curves may however be explained by a simplemodel consisting of two concentric components. the outer component isresponsible for the early part of the light curve and for the broad absorptionfeatures observed in the early spectra of hypernovae, similar to theone-dimensional models. in addition, a very dense inner component is added,which reproduces the linear decline phase in the observed magnitude-versus-timerelation for sne 1998bw, 1997ef, and 2002ap. this simple approach does containone of the main features of jet-driven, asymmetric explosion models, namely thepresence of a dense core. although the total masses and energies derived withthe two-component model are similar to those obtained in previous studies whichalso adopted spherical symmetry, this study suggests that the ejecta areaspherical, and thus the real energies and masses may deviate from thosederived assuming spherical symmetry. the supernovae which were modeled aredivided into two groups, according to the prominence of the inner component:the inner component of sn 1997ef is denser and more $^{56}$ni-rich, relative tothe outer component, than the corresponding inner components of sne 1998bw and2002ap. these latter objects have a similar inner-to-outer component ratio,although they have very different global values of mass and energy.

(hypernovae being a tentativelydefined class of sne with very broad absorption features: these featuressuggest a large velocity of the ejected material and possibly a large explosionkinetic energy.) comparison with spectra of other hypernovae shows that thespectrum of sn 2003dh obtained on 2003 may 8 and 9, i.e., 34-35 rest-frame daysafter the grb (for z=0.1685), are similar to those of sn 1997ef obtained ~34-42days after the fiducial time of explosion of that sn. the match with sn 1998bwspectra is not as good (at rest 7300-8000 a, but again spectra obtained ~33-43days after grb 980425 are preferred. this indicates that the sn may haveintermediate properties between sne 1997ef and 1998bw. based on the analogywith the other hypernovae, the time of explosion of sn 2003dh is thenconstrained to be between -8 and +2 days of the grb. the si and o p-cygni linesof sn 2003dh seem comparable to those of sn 1997ef, which suggests that theejected mass in sn 2003dh may match that in sn 1997ef. polarization wasmarginally detected at optical wavelengths. this is consistent withmeasurements of the late afterglow, implying that it mostly originated in theinterstellar medium of the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0308138	type ia supernovae: progenitors and diversities	a key question for supernova cosmology is whether the peak luminosities oftype ia supernovae (sne ia) are sufficiently free from the effects of cosmicand galactic evolution. to answer this question, we review the currentlypopular scenario of sn ia progenitors, i.e., the single degenerate scenario forthe chandrasekhar mass white dwarf (wd) models. we identify the progenitor'sevolution with two channels: (1) the wd+rg (red-giant) and (2) the wd+ms (nearmain-sequence he-rich star) channels. the strong wind from accreting wds playsa key role, which yields important age and metallicity effects on theevolution.  we suggest that the variation of the carbon mass fraction $x$(c) in the c+owd (or the variation of the initial wd mass) causes the diversity of sn iabrightness. this model can explain the observed dependence of sne ia brightnesson the galaxy types. we then predict how sn ia brightness evolves along theredshift (with changing metallicity and age) for elliptical and spiralgalaxies. such evolutionary effects along the redshift can be corrected as hasbeen made for local sne ia.  we also touch on several related issues: (1) the abundance pattern of starsin dwarf spheroidal galaxies in relation to the metallicity effect on sne ia,(2) effects of angular momentum brought into the wd in relation to thediversities and the fate of double degenerates, and (3) possible presence ofhelium in the peculiar sn ia 2000cx in relation to the sub-chandrasekhar massmodel.

astro-ph;0309639	sn 2003du: signatures of the circumstellar environment in a normal type  ia supernova?	we present observations of the type ia supernova 2003du and report thedetectionof an unusual, high-velocity component in the ca ii infrared triplet,similar tofeatures previously observed in sn 2000cx and sn 2001el. this featureexhibits a large expansion velocity (~18,000 km/s) which is nearly constantbetween -7 and +2 days relative to maximum light, and disappears shortlythereafter. otherthan this feature, the spectral evolution and light curveresemble those of a normal sn ia.  we find that the ca ii feature can plausibly be caused by a dense shellformed when circumstellar material of solar abundance is overrun by the rapidlyexpanding outermost layers of the sn ejecta. model calculations show that theoptical and infrared spectra are remarkably unaffected by the circumstellarinteraction. in particular, no hydrogen lines are detectable in eitherabsorption or emission. the only qualitatively different features are thestrong, high-velocity feature in the ca ii ir-triplet, and a somewhat weaker oi feature near 7,300 aa. the morphology and time evolution of these featuresprovide an estimate for the amount of accumulated matter and an indication ofthe mixing in the dense shell. we apply these diagnostic tools to sn 2003du andinfer that about 2 x 10^{-2} m_sun of solar abundance material may haveaccumulated in a circumstellar shell prior to the observations. furthermore,the early light curve data imply that the circumstellar material was originallyvery close to the progenitor system, perhaps from an accretion disk, roche lobeor common envelope.

astro-ph;0509788	enrichment of very metal-poor stars with both r-process and s-process  elements from 8-10 m_\odot stars	recent spectroscopic studies have revealed the presence of numerouscarbon-enhanced, metal-poor stars with [fe/h] &lt; -2.0 that exhibit strongenhancements of s-process elements. these stars are believed to be the resultof a binary mass-transfer episode from a former asymptotic giant-branch (agb)companion that underwent s-process nucleosynthesis. however, several such starsexhibit significantly lower ba/eu ratios than solar s-process abundances. thismight be explained if there were an additional contribution from the r-process,thereby diluting the ba/eu ratio by extra production of eu. we propose a modelin which the double enhancements of r-process and s-process elements originatefrom a former 8-10 m_\odot companion in a wide binary system, which may undergos-processing during an agb phase, followed by r-processing during itssubsequent supernova explosion. the mass of eu (as representative of r-processelements) captured by the secondary through the wind from the supernova isestimated, which is assumed to be proportional to the geometric fraction of thesecondary (low-mass, main-sequence) star with respect to the primary(exploding) star. we find that the estimated mass is in good agreement with aconstraint on the eu yield per supernova event obtained from a galacticchemical evolution study, when the initial orbital separation is taken to be\sim 1 year. if one assumes an orbital period on the order of five years, theefficiency of wind pollution from the supernova must be enhanced by a factor of\sim 10. this may, in fact, be realized if the expansion velocity of thesupernova's innermost ejecta, in which the r-process has taken place, issignificantly slow, resulting in an enhancement of accretion efficiency bygravitational focusing.

astro-ph;0511389	optical emission from aspherical supernovae and the hypernova sn 1998bw	a fully 3d monte carlo scheme is applied to compute optical bolometric lightcurves for aspherical (jet-like) supernova explosion models. density andabundance distributions are taken from hydrodynamic explosion models, with theenergy varied as a parameter to explore the dependence. our models showinitially a very large degree ($\sim 4$ depending on model parameters) ofboosting luminosity toward the polar ($z$) direction relative to the equatorial($r$) plane, which decreases as the time of peak is approached. after the peak,the factor of the luminosity boost remains almost constant ($\sim 1.2$) untilthe supernova enters the nebular phase. this behavior is due mostly to theaspherical $^{56}$ni distribution in the earlier phase and to the disk-likeinner low-velocity structure in the later phase. also the aspherical modelsyield an earlier peak date than the spherical models, especially if viewed fromnear the z-axis. aspherical models with ejecta mass $\sim 10\msun$ areexamined, and one with the kinetic energy of the expansion $\sim 2 \pm 0.5\times 10^{52}$ ergs and a mass of $^{56}$ni $\sim 0.4\msun$ yields a lightcurve in agreement with the observed light curve of sn 1998bw (the prototypicalhyper-energetic supernova). the aspherical model is also at least qualitativelyconsistent with evolution of photospheric velocities, showing large velocitiesnear the z-axis, and with a late-phase nebular spectrum. the viewing angle isclose to the z-axis, strengthening the case for the association of sn 1998bwwith the gamma ray burst grb980425.

astro-ph;9906192	the origin of diversity of type ia supernovae and environmental effects	observations suggest that the properties of type ia supernovae (sne ia) maydepend on environmental characteristics, such as morphology, metallicity, andage of host galaxies. the influence of these environmental properties on theresulting sne ia is studied in this paper. first it is shown that the carbonmass fraction x(c) in the c+o white dwarf sn ia progenitors tends to be smallerfor lower metallicity and older the binary system age. it is then suggestedthat the variation of x(c) causes the diversity in the brightness of sne ia: asmaller x(c) leads to a dimmer sn ia. further studies of the propagation of theturbulent flame are necessary to confirm this relation. our model for the sn iaprogenitors then predicts that when the progenitors belong to an olderpopulation or to a low metallicity environment, the number of bright sne ia isreduced, so that the variation in brightness among the sne ia is also smaller.thus our model can explain why the mean sn ia brightness and its dispersiondepend on the morphology of the host galaxies and on the distance of the snfrom the center of the galaxy. it is further predicted that at higher redshift(z &gt;~ 1) both the the mean brightness of sne ia and its variation should besmaller in spiral galaxies than in elliptical galaxies. these variations arewithin the range observed in nearby sne ia. in so far as the variation in x(c)is the most important cause for the diversity among sne ia, the light curveshape method currently used to determine the absolute magnitude of sne ia canbe applied also to high redshift sne ia.

astro-ph;9908226	influence of the stellar population on type ia supernovae: consequences  for the determination of omega	the influence of the metallicity at the main sequence on the chemicalstructure of the exploding white dwarf, the nucleosynthesis during theexplosion and the light curves of an individual type ia supernovae have beenstudied. detailed calculations of the stellar evolution, the explosion, andlight curves of delayed detonation models are presented.  detailed stellar evolution calculations with a main sequence mass of 7 m_ohave been performed to test the influence of the metallicity z on the structureof the progenitor. a change of z influences the central helium burning and,consequently, the size of the c/o core which becomes a c/o white dwarf and itsc/o ratio. subsequently, the white dwarf may grow to the chandrasekhar mass andexplode as a type ia supernovae. consequently, the c/o structure of theexploding white dwarf depends on z. since c and o are the fuel for thethermonuclear explosion, z indirectly changes the energetics of the explosion.  in our example, changing z from pop i to pop ii causes a change in the zeropoint of the maximum brightness/decline relation by about $0.1^m$ and a changein the rise time by about 1 day. combined with previous studies, we provide arelation between a change of the rise time in sneia and the off-set in thebrightness/decline relation. we find that dm = dt where dm is the offset in therelation and dt is the change of the rise time in days.  this relation provides a way to detect and test for evolutionary effects, andto estimate the possible consequences for the determination of the cosmologicalconstant. however, due to uncertainties in the time evolution of the propertiesof the progenitors, we cannot predict whether evolution becomes important atz=0.5, 1 or 2. this question has to be answered by observations.

astro-ph;9910113	impacts of the detection of cassiopeia a point source	very recently the chandra first light observation discovered a point-likesource in cassiopeia a (cas a) supernova remnant. this detection wassubsequently confirmed by the analyses of the archival data from both rosat andeinstein observations. here we compare the results from these observations withthe scenarios involving both black holes (bh) and neutron stars (ns). if thispoint source is a bh we offer as a promising model a disk-corona type modelwith low accretion rate where a soft photon source at ~ 0.1 kev is comptonizedby higher energy electrons in the corona. if it is a ns the dominant radiationobserved by chandra most likely originates from smaller, hotter regions of thestellar surface, but we argue that it is still worthwhile to compare the coolercomponent from the rest of the surface with cooling theories. we emphasize thatthe detection of this point source itself should potentially provide enormousimpacts on the theories of supernova explosion, progenitor scenario, compactremnant formation, accretion to compact objects, and neutron star thermalevolution.

astro-ph;9910324	the properties of supernova 1997cy associated to grb970514	the extraordinary sn 1997cy associated with grb 970514 has been observedphotometrically and spectroscopically for nearly 2 yr. at the time of discoverysn 1997cy was the brightest sn ever observed (mv=&lt;-20.1, v(hel)=19140 km/s,h_0=65 km/s/mpc). up to the last available observations (600 days after thegrb) the total time-integrated flux was equal to or larger than that expectedfrom the complete thermalization of the gamma-rays produced by 2.3 mo of 56co.however, starting already on day 60 the luminosity decline is slower than the56co decay rate, indicating that the sn ejecta was interacting withcircumstellar material (csm). the interaction appeared to weaken around day550. the spectra of sn 1997cy are dominated at all epochs by halpha emission,which shows at least 3 components of different widths, as in sn 1988z. severalother lines with different widths are also visible, especially at early epochs.the entire light curve of sn 1997cy is reproduced by a model of the interactionof the very energetic (e=5 x 10^(52) ergs) ejecta of a massive star (25 mo)with the csm, with some contribution from radioactive decays. the csm couldhave been ejected with a mass-loss rate of mdot ~ 4x10^(-4) mo yr^(-1) as theprogenitor star evolved from a bsg to a rsg about 10^4 yr before the explosion.the lack of oxygen and magnesium lines in the spectra at nebular phases poses aproblem for models requiring high mass progenitors. the possibility that mostof the core material of the progenitor has fallen onto a massive black hole sothat the reverse shock dies at the inner edge of the h/he envelope isdiscussed.

0810.3999	nucleosynthesis in electron capture supernovae of agb stars	we examine nucleosynthesis in the electron capture supernovae of progenitoragb stars with an o-ne-mg core (with the initial stellar mass of 8.8 m_\odot).thermodynamic trajectories for the first 810 ms after core bounce are takenfrom a recent state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulation. the presentednucleosynthesis results are characterized by a number of distinct features thatare not shared with those of other supernovae from the collapse of stars withiron core (with initial stellar masses of more than 10 m_\odot). first is thesmall amount of 56ni (= 0.002-0.004 m_\odot) in the ejecta, which can be anexplanation for observed properties of faint supernovae such as sne 2008s and1997d. in addition, the large ni/fe ratio is in reasonable agreement with thespectroscopic result of the crab nebula (the relic of sn 1054). second is thelarge production of 64zn, 70ge, light p-nuclei (74se, 78kr, 84sr, and 92mo),and in particular, 90zr, which originates from the low y_e (= 0.46-0.49, thenumber of electrons per nucleon) ejecta. we find, however, that only a 1-2%increase of the minimum y_e moderates the overproduction of 90zr. in contrast,the production of 64zn is fairly robust against a small variation of y_e. thisprovides the upper limit of the occurrence of this type of events to be about30% of all core-collapse supernovae.

0812.1448	origin and nature of dust in the early universe	we present recent advances in theoretical studies of the formation andevolution of dust in primordial supernovae (sne) that are considered to be themain sources of dust in the early universe. being combined with the results ofcalculations of dust formation in the ejecta of population iii sne, theinvestigations of the evolution of newly formed dust within supernova remnants(snrs) show that smaller grains are predominantly destroyed by sputtering inthe shocked gas, while larger grains are injected into the ambient medium. themass of dust grains surviving the destruction in snrs reaches up to 0.1--15$m_\odot$, which is high enough to account for the content of dust observed forthe host galaxies of quasars at $z &gt; 5$. in addition, the transport of dustformed in the ejecta causes the formation of low-mass stars in the dense shellof primordial snrs and affects the elemental composition of those stars. wealso show that the flat extinction curve is expected in the high-redshiftuniverse where sne are the possible sources of dust.
