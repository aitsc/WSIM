0906.1122	s-bearing molecules in massive dense cores	chemical composition of the massive cores forming high-mass stars can putsome constrains on the time scale of the massive star formation: sulphurchemistry is of specific interest due to its rapid evolution in warm gas andbecause the abundance of sulphur bearing species increases significantly withthe temperature. two mid-infrared quiet and two brighter massive cores areobserved in various transitions (e_up up to 289k) of cs, ocs, h2s, so, so2 andof their isotopologues at mm wavelengths with the iram 30m and cso telescopes.1d modeling of the dust continuum is used to derive the density and temperaturelaws, which are then applied in the ratran code to model the observed lineemission, and to derive the relative abundances of the molecules. all lines,except the highest energy so2 transition, are detected. infall (up to 2.9km/s)may be detected towards the core w43mm1. the inferred mass rate is 5.8-9.410^{-2} m_{\odot}/yr. we propose an evolutionary sequence of our sources(w43mm1-iras18264-1152-iras05358+3543-iras18162-2048), based on the sedanalysis. the analysis of the variations in abundance ratios from source tosource reveals that the so and so2 relative abundances increase with time,while cs and ocs decrease. molecular ratios, such as [ocs/h2s], [cs/h2s],[so/ocs], [so2/ocs], [cs/so] and [so2/so] may be good indicators of evolutiondepending on layers probed by the observed molecular transitions. observationsof molecular emission from warmer layers, hence involving higher upper energylevels are mandatory to include.

0909.4683	deuterium chemistry in the orion bar pdr - "warm" chemistry starring  ch2d+	high levels of deuterium fractionation in gas-phase molecules are usuallyassociated with cold regions, such as prestellar cores. significantfractionation ratios are also observed in hot environments such as hot cores orhot corinos, where they are believed to be produced by the evaporation of theicy mantles surrounding dust grains, and thus are remnants of a previous cold(either gas-phase or grain surface) chemistry. the recent detection of dcntowards the orion bar, in a clump at a characteristic temperature of 70k, hasshown that high deuterium fractionation can also be detected in pdrs. the orionbar clumps thus appear as a good environment for the observational study ofdeuterium fractionation in luke-warm gas, allowing to validate chemistry modelsin a different temperature range, where dominating fractionation processes arepredicted to be different than in cold gas (&lt; 20k). we aimed at studyingobservationally in detail the chemistry at work in the orion bar pdr, tounderstand if dcn is produced by ice mantle evaporation, or is the result ofwarm gas-phase chemistry, involving the ch2d+ precursor ion (which surviveshigher temperatures than the usual h2d+ precursor). using the apex and the iram30m telescopes, we targetted selected deuterated species towards two clumps inthe orion bar. we confirmed the detection of dcn and detected two newdeuterated molecules (dco+ and hdco) towards one clump in the orion bar pdr.significant deuterium fractionations are found for hcn and h2co, but a lowfractionation in hco+. we also give upper limits for other molecules relevantfor the deuterium chemistry.

1005.1671	strong absorption by interstellar hydrogen fluoride: herschel/hifi  observations of the sight-line to g10.6-0.4 (w31c)	we report the detection of strong absorption by interstellar hydrogenfluoride along the sight-line to the submillimeter continuum source g10.6-0.4(w31c). we have used herschel's hifi instrument, in dual beam switch mode, toobserve the 1232.4763 ghz j=1-0 hf transition in the upper sideband of the band5a receiver. the resultant spectrum shows weak hf emission from g10.6-0.4 atlsr velocities in the range -10 to -3 km/s, accompanied by strong absorption byforeground material at lsr velocities in the range 15 to 50 km/s. the spectrumis similar to that of the 1113.3430 ghz 1(11)-0(00) transition of para-water,although at some frequencies the hf (hydrogen fluoride) optical depth clearlyexceeds that of para-h2o. the optically-thick hf absorption that we haveobserved places a conservative lower limit of 1.6e+14 cm-2 on the hf columndensity along the sight-line to g10.6-0.4. our lower limit on the hf abundance,6e-9 relative to hydrogen nuclei, implies that hydrogen fluoride accounts forbetween ~ 30 and 100% of the fluorine nuclei in the gas phase along thissight-line. this observation corroborates theoretical predictions that -because the unique thermochemistry of fluorine permits the exothermic reactionof f atoms with molecular hydrogen - hf will be the dominant reservoir ofinterstellar fluorine under a wide range of conditions.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

1007.0987	herschel/hifi observations of interstellar oh+ and h2o+ towards w49n: a  probe of diffuse clouds with a small molecular fraction	we report the detection of absorption by interstellar hydroxyl cations andwater cations, along the sight-line to the bright continuum source w49n. wehave used herschel's hifi instrument, in dual beam switch mode, to observe the972 ghz n = 1 - 0 transition of oh+ and the 1115 ghz 1(11) - 0(00) transitionof ortho-h2o+. the resultant spectra show absorption by ortho-h2o+, and strongabsorption by oh+, in foreground material at velocities in the range 0 to 70km/s with respect to the local standard of rest. the inferred oh+/h2o+abundance ratio ranges from ~ 3 to ~ 15, implying that the observed oh+ arisesin clouds of small molecular fraction, in the 2 - 8% range. this conclusion isconfirmed by the distribution of oh+ and h2o+ in doppler velocity space, whichis similar to that of atomic hydrogen, as observed by means of 21 cm absorptionmeasurements, and dissimilar from that typical of other molecular tracers. theobserved oh+/h abundance ratio of a few e-8 suggests a cosmic ray ionizationrate for atomic hydrogen of (0.6 - 2.4) e-16 s-1, in good agreement withestimates inferred previously for diffuse clouds in the galactic disk fromobservations of interstellar h3+ and other species.

1007.1539	herschel/hifi observations of spectrally resolved methylidyne signatures  toward the high-mass star-forming core ngc6334i	in contrast to extensively studied dense star-forming cores, little is knownabout diffuse gas surrounding star-forming regions. we study molecular gas inthe high-mass star-forming region ngc6334i, which contains diffuse, quiescentcomponents that are inconspicuous in widely used molecular tracers such as co.we present herschel/hifi observations of ch toward ngc6334i observed as part ofthe chess key program. hifi resolves the hyperfine components of its j=3/2-1/2transition, observed in both emission and absorption. the ch emission appearsclose to the systemic velocity of ngc6334i, while its measured linewidth of 3km/s is smaller than previously observed in dense gas tracers such as nh3 andsio. the ch abundance in the hot core is 7 10^-11, two to three orders ofmagnitude lower than in diffuse clouds. while other studies find distinctoutflows in, e.g., co and h2o toward ngc6334i, we do not detect outflowsignatures in ch. to explain the absorption signatures, at least two absorbingcomponents are needed at -3.0 and +6.5 km/s with n(ch)=7 10^13 and 3 10^13cm^-2. two additional absorbing clouds are found at +8.0 and 0.0 km/s, bothwith n(ch)=2 10^13 cm^-2. turbulent linewidths for the four absorptioncomponents vary between 1.5 and 5.0 km/s in fwhm. we constrain physicalproperties of our ch clouds by matching our ch absorbers with other absorptionsignatures. in the hot core, molecules such as h2o and co trace gas that isheated and dynamically influenced by outflow activity, whereas ch traces morequiescent material. the four ch absorbers have column densities and turbulentproperties consistent with diffuse clouds: two are located near ngc6334, andtwo are unrelated foreground clouds. local density and dynamical effectsinfluence the chemical composition of physical components of ngc6334, causingsome components to be seen in ch but not in other tracers, and vice versa.

1007.2148	detection of hydrogen fluoride absorption in diffuse molecular clouds  with herschel/hifi: a ubiquitous tracer of molecular gas	we discuss the detection of absorption by interstellar hydrogen fluoride (hf)along the sight line to the submillimeter continuum sources w49n and w51. wehave used herschel's hifi instrument in dual beam switch mode to observe the1232.4762 ghz j = 1 - 0 hf transition in the upper sideband of the band 5areceiver. we detected foreground absorption by hf toward both sources over awide range of velocities. optically thin absorption components were detected onboth sight lines, allowing us to measure - as opposed to obtain a lower limiton - the column density of hf for the first time. as in previous observationsof hf toward the source g10.6-0.4, the derived hf column density is typicallycomparable to that of water vapor, even though the elemental abundance ofoxygen is greater than that of fluorine by four orders of magnitude. we usedthe rather uncertain n(ch)-n(h2) relationship derived previously toward diffusemolecular clouds to infer the molecular hydrogen column density in the cloudsexhibiting hf absorption. within the uncertainties, we find that the abundanceof hf with respect to h2 is consistent with the theoretical prediction that hfis the main reservoir of gas-phase fluorine for these clouds. thus, hydrogenfluoride has the potential to become an excellent tracer of molecular hydrogen,and provides a sensitive probe of clouds of small h2 column density. indeed,the observations of hydrogen fluoride reported here reveal the presence of alow column density diffuse molecular cloud along the w51 sight line, at an lsrvelocity of ~ 24kms-1, that had not been identified in molecular absorptionline studies prior to the launch of herschel.

1007.5131	reversal of infall in sgrb2(m) revealed by herschel/hifi observations of  hcn lines at thz frequencies	to investigate the accretion and feedback processes in massive starformation, we analyze the shapes of emission lines from hot molecular cores,whose asymmetries trace infall and expansion motions. the high-mass starforming region sgrb2(m) was observed with herschel/hifi (hexos key project) invarious lines of hcn and its isotopologues, complemented by apex data. theobservations are compared to spherically symmetric, centrally heated modelswith density power-law gradient and different velocity fields (infall orinfall+expansion), using the radiative transfer code ratran. the hcn lineprofiles are asymmetric, with the emission peak shifting from blue to red withincreasing j and decreasing line opacity (hcn to h$^{13}$cn). this is mostevident in the hcn 12--11 line at 1062 ghz. these line shapes are reproduced bya model whose velocity field changes from infall in the outer part to expansionin the inner part. the qualitative reproduction of the hcn lines suggests thatinfall dominates in the colder, outer regions, but expansion dominates in thewarmer, inner regions. we are thus witnessing the onset of feedback in massivestar formation, starting to reverse the infall and finally disrupting the wholemolecular cloud. to obtain our result, the thz lines uniquely covered by hifiwere critically important.

1102.2698	the influence of deuteration and turbulent diffusion on the observed d/h  ratio	the influence of turbulent mixing on the chemistry of the interstellar mediumhas so far received little attention. previous studies of this effect havesuggested that it might play an important role in mixing the various phases ofthe interstellar medium. in this paper we examine the potential effects ofturbulent diffusion on the deuterium chemistry within molecular clouds. we findthat such mixing acts to reduce the efficiency of deuteration in these cloudsby increasing the ionization fraction and reducing freeze-out of heavymolecules. this leads to lower abundances for many deuterated species. we alsoexamine the influence of turbulent mixing on the transition from atomichydrogen to h2 and from atomic deuterium to hd near the cloud edge. we findthat including turbulent diffusion in our models serves to push thesetransitions deeper into the cloud and helps maintain a higher atomic fractionthroughout the cloud envelope. based on these findings, we propose a newprocess to account for the significant scatter in the observed atomic d/h ratiofor galactic sightlines extending beyond the local bubble. although severalmechanisms have been put forward to explain this scatter, they are unable tofully account for the range in d/h values. we suggest a scenario in whichturbulent mixing of atomic and molecular gas at the edges of molecular cloudscauses the observed atomic d/h ratio to vary by a factor of ~2.

1202.5637	multi-line detection of o2 toward rho oph a	models of pure gas-phase chemistry in well-shielded regions of molecularclouds predict relatively high levels of molecular oxygen, o2, and water, h2o.contrary to expectation, the space missions swas and odin found only very smallamounts of water vapour and essentially no o2 in the dense star-forminginterstellar medium. only toward rho oph a did odin detect a weak line of o2 at119 ghz in a beam size of 10 arcmin. a larger telescope aperture such as thatof the herschel space observatory is required to resolve the o2 emission and topinpoint its origin. we use the heterodyne instrument for the far infraredaboard herschel to obtain high resolution o2 spectra toward selected positionsin rho oph a. these data are analysed using standard techniques for o2excitation and compared to recent pdr-like chemical cloud models. the 487.2ghzline was clearly detected toward all three observed positions in rho oph a. inaddition, an oversampled map of the 773.8ghz transition revealed the detectionof the line in only half of the observed area. based on their ratios, thetemperature of the o2 emitting gas appears to vary quite substantially, withwarm gas (&gt; 50 k) adjacent to a much colder region, where temperatures arebelow 30 k. the exploited models predict o2 column densities to be sensitive tothe prevailing dust temperatures, but rather insensitive to the temperatures ofthe gas. in agreement with these model, the observationally determined o2column densities seem not to depend strongly on the derived gas temperatures,but fall into the range n(o2) = (3 to &gt;6)e15/cm^2. beam averaged o2 abundancesare about 5e-8 relative to h2. combining the hifi data with earlier odinobservations yields a source size at 119 ghz of about 4 - 5 arcmin,encompassing the entire rho oph a core.

1207.7180	herschel measurements of the d/h and 16o/18o ratios in water in the  oort-cloud comet c/2009 p1 (garradd)	the d/h ratio in cometary water is believed to be an important indicator ofthe conditions under which icy planetesimals formed and can provide clues tothe contribution of comets to the delivery of water and other volatiles toearth. available measurements suggest that there is isotopic diversity in thecomet population. the herschel space observatory revealed an ocean-like ratioin the jupiter-family comet 103p/hartley 2, whereas most values measured inoort-cloud comets are twice as high as the ocean d/h ratio. we present here anew measurement of the d/h ratio in the water of an oort-cloud comet. hdo,h_2o, and h_2^18o lines were observed with high signal-to-noise ratio in cometc/2009 p1 (garradd) using the herschel hifi instrument. spectral maps of twowater lines were obtained to constrain the water excitation. the d/h ratioderived from the measured h_2^16o and hdo production rates is 2.06+/-0.22 x10**-4. this result shows that the d/h in the water of oort-cloud comets is notas high as previously thought, at least for a fraction of the population, hencethe paradigm of a single, archetypal d/h ratio for all oort-cloud comets is nolonger tenable. nevertheless, the value measured in c/2009 p1 (garradd) issignificantly higher than the earth's ocean value of 1.558 x 10**-4. themeasured h_2^16o/h_2^18o ratio of 523+/-32 is, however, consistent with theterrestrial value.

1408.2458	mapping the release of volatiles in the inner comae of comets c/2012 f6  (lemmon) and c/2012 s1 (ison) using the atacama large  millimeter/submillimeter array	results are presented from the first cometary observations using the atacamalarge millimeter/submillimeter array (alma), including measurements of thespatially-resolved distributions of hcn, hnc, h$_2$co and dust within the comaeof two comets: c/2012 f6 (lemmon) and c/2012 s1 (ison), observed atheliocentric distances of 1.5 au and 0.54 au, respectively. these observations(with angular resolution $\approx0.5''$), reveal an unprecedented level ofdetail in the distributions of these fundamental cometary molecules, anddemonstrate the power of alma for quantitative measurements of thedistributions of molecules and dust in the inner comae of typical brightcomets. in both comets, hcn is found to originate from (or within a few hundredkm of) the nucleus, with a spatial distribution largely consistent withspherically-symmetric, uniform outflow. by contrast, the hnc distributions areclumpy and asymmetrical, with peaks at cometocentric radii $\sim$500-1000~km,consistent with release of hnc in collimated outflow(s). compared to hcn, theh$_2$co distribution in comet lemmon is very extended. the interferometricvisibility amplitudes are consistent with coma production of h$_2$co and hncfrom unidentified precursor material(s) in both comets. adopting a haser model,the h$_2$co parent scale-length is found to be a few thousand km in lemmon andonly a few hundred km in ison, consistent with destruction of the precursor byphotolysis or thermal degradation at a rate which scales in proportion to thesolar radiation flux.

1408.5757	collisional excitation of singly deuterated ammonia nh$_2$d by h$_2$	the availability of collisional rate coefficients with h$_2$ is apre-requisite for interpretation of observations of molecules whose energylevels are populated under non local thermodynamical equilibrium conditions. inthe current study, we present collisional rate coefficients for the nh$_2$d /para--h$_2$($j_2 = 0,2$) collisional system, for energy levels up to $j_\tau =7_7$ ($e_u$$\sim$735 k) and for gas temperatures in the range $t = 5-300$k. thecross sections are obtained using the essentially exact close--coupling (cc)formalism at low energy and at the highest energies, we used thecoupled--states (cs) approximation. for the energy levels up to $j_\tau = 4_2$($e_u$$\sim$215 k), the cross sections obtained through the cs formalism arescaled according to a few cc reference points. these reference points aresubsequently used to estimate the accuracy of the rate coefficients for higherlevels, which is mainly limited by the use of the cs formalism. considering thecurrent potential energy surface, the rate coefficients are thus expected to beaccurate to within 5\% for the levels below $j_\tau = 4_2$, while we estimatean accuracy of 30\% for higher levels.

1411.6483	depletion of chlorine into hcl ice in a protostellar core	the freezeout of gas-phase species onto cold dust grains can drasticallyalter the chemistry and the heating-cooling balance of protostellar material.in contrast to well-known species such as carbon monoxide (co), the freezeoutof various carriers of elements with abundances $&lt;10^{-5}$ has not yet beenwell studied. our aim here is to study the depletion of chlorine in theprotostellar core, omc-2 fir 4. we observed transitions of hcl and h2cl+towards omc-2 fir 4 using the herschel space observatory and caltechsubmillimeter observatory facilities. our analysis makes use of state of theart chlorine gas-grain chemical models and newly calculated hcl-h$_{2}$hyperfine collisional excitation rate coefficients. a narrow emission componentin the hcl lines traces the extended envelope, and a broad one traces a morecompact central region. the gas-phase hcl abundance in fir 4 is 9e-11, a factorof only 0.001 that of volatile elemental chlorine. the h2cl+ lines are detectedin absorption and trace a tenuous foreground cloud, where we find no depletionof volatile chlorine. gas-phase hcl is the tip of the chlorine iceberg inprotostellar cores. using a gas-grain chemical model, we show that thehydrogenation of atomic chlorine on grain surfaces in the dark cloud stagesequesters at least 90% of the volatile chlorine into hcl ice, where it remainsin the protostellar stage. about 10% of chlorine is in gaseous atomic form.gas-phase hcl is a minor, but diagnostically key reservoir, with an abundanceof &lt;1e-10 in most of the protostellar core. we find the 35cl/37cl ratio inomc-2 fir 4 to be 3.2\pm0.1, consistent with the solar system value.

1412.1106	herschel survey of galactic oh+, h2o+, and h3o+: probing the molecular  hydrogen fraction and cosmic-ray ionization rate	in diffuse interstellar clouds the chemistry that leads to the formation ofthe oxygen bearing ions oh+, h2o+, and h3o+ begins with the ionization ofatomic hydrogen by cosmic rays, and continues through subsequent hydrogenabstraction reactions involving h2. given these reaction pathways, the observedabundances of these molecules are useful in constraining both the totalcosmic-ray ionization rate of atomic hydrogen (zeta_h) and molecular hydrogenfraction, f(h2). we present observations targeting transitions of oh+, h2o+,and h3o+ made with the herschel space observatory along 20 galactic sight linestoward bright submillimeter continuum sources. both oh+ and h2o+ are detectedin absorption in multiple velocity components along every sight line, but h3o+is only detected along 7 sight lines. from the molecular abundances we computef(h2) in multiple distinct components along each line of sight, and find agaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation 0.042+-0.018. thisconfirms previous findings that oh+ and h2o+ primarily reside in gas with lowh2 fractions. we also infer zeta_h throughout our sample, and find a log-normaldistribution with mean log(zeta_h)=-15.75, (zeta_h=1.78x10^-16 s^-1), andstandard deviation 0.29 for gas within the galactic disk, but outside of thegalactic center. this is in good agreement with the mean and distribution ofcosmic-ray ionization rates previously inferred from h3+ observations.ionization rates in the galactic center tend to be 10--100 times larger thanfound in the galactic disk, also in accord with prior studies.

1508.03801	velocity-resolved [cii] emission and [cii]/fir mapping along orion with  herschel	we present the first 7.5'x11.5' velocity-resolved map of the [cii]158um linetoward the orion molecular cloud-1 (omc-1) taken with the herschel/hifiinstrument. in combination with far-infrared (fir) photometric images andvelocity-resolved maps of the h41alpha hydrogen recombination and co j=2-1lines, this data set provides an unprecedented view of the intricatesmall-scale kinematics of the ionized/pdr/molecular gas interfaces and of theradiative feedback from massive stars. the main contribution to the [cii]luminosity (~85%) is from the extended, fuv-illuminated face of the cloudg_0&gt;500, n_h&gt;5x10^3 cm^-3) and from dense pdrs (g_0~10^4, n_h~10^5 cm^-3) atthe interface between omc-1 and the hii region surrounding the trapeziumcluster. around 15% of the [cii] emission arises from a different gas componentwithout co counterpart. the [cii] excitation, pdr gas turbulence, line opacity(from [13cii]) and role of the geometry of the illuminating stars with respectto the cloud are investigated. we construct maps of the [cii]/fir and fir/m_gasratios and show that [cii]/fir decreases from the extended cloud component(10^-2-10^-3) to the more opaque star-forming cores (10^-3-10^-4). the lowestvalues are reminiscent of the "[cii] deficit" seen in local ultra-luminous irgalaxies hosting vigorous star formation. spatial correlation analysis showsthat the decreasing [cii]/fir ratio correlates better with the column densityof dust through the molecular cloud than with fir/m_gas. we conclude that the[cii] emitting column relative to the total dust column along each line ofsight is responsible for the observed [cii]/fir variations through the cloud.

1510.06620	herschel hifi observations of the sgr a +50 km/s cloud. deep searches  for o2 in emission and foreground absorption	to date o2 has definitely been detected in only two sources, namely rho oph aand orion, reflecting the extremely low abundance of o2 in the interstellarmedium. one of the sources in the hop program is the +50 km/s cloud in the sgra complex in the centre of the milky way. the herschel hifi is used to searchfor the 487 and 774 ghz emission lines of o2. no o2 emission is detectedtowards the sgr a +50 km/s cloud, but a number of strong emission lines ofmethanol (ch3oh) and absorption lines of chloronium (h2cl+) are observed. a 3sigma upper limit for the fractional abundance ratio of (o2)/(h2) in the sgr a+50 km/s cloud is found to be x(o2) less than 5 x 10(-8). however, since we canfind no other realistic molecular candidate than o2 itself, we very tentativelysuggest that two weak absorption lines at 487.261 and 487.302 ghz may be causedby the 487 ghz line of o2 in two foreground spiral arm clouds. by consideringthat the absorption may only be apparent, the estimated upper limit to the o2abundance of less than (10-20) x 10(-6) in these foreground clouds is veryhigh. this abundance limit was determined also using odin non-detection limits.if the absorption is due to a differential herschel off-on emission, the o2fractional abundance may be of the order of (5-10) x 10(-6). with theassumption of pure absorption by foreground clouds, the unreasonably highabundance of (1.4-2.8) x 10(-4) was obtained. the rotation temperatures forch3oh-a and ch3oh-e lines in the +50 km/s cloud are found to be 64 and 79 k,respectively, and the fractional abundance of ch3oh is approximately 5 x10(-7).

astro-ph;0608710	the origin of diffuse x-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission from the galactic  center region: cosmic ray particles	(abridged) the inner couple hundred pcs of our galaxy is characterized bysignificant amount of synchrotron-emitting gas, which appears to co-exist witha large reservoir of molecular gas. the spatial correlation between fluorescentfe k-alpha line emission at 6.4 kev and molecular line emission from galacticcenter molecular clouds has been explained as reflected x-rays from a pastoutburst of sgr a*. here we present multi-wavelength study of a representativegalactic center cloud sgr c using chandra, vla and fcrao. we note a correlationbetween the nonthermal radio filaments in sgr c and the x-ray features,suggesting that the two are related. we account for this distribution in termsof the impact of the relativistic particles from local (nonthermal filaments)and extended sources with diffuse neutral gas producing both a nonthermalbremsstrahlung x-ray continuum emission, as well as diffuse 6.4 kev lineemission. the production rate of fe kalpha photons associated with theinjection of electrons into a cloud as a function of column density iscalculated. the required energy density of low-energy cosmic rays associatedwith the synchrotron emitting radio filaments or extended features is estimatedto be in the range between 20 and $\sim10^3$ ev cm^-3 for sgr c, sgr b1, sgrb2, and ``the 45 and -30 \kms'' clouds. we also generalize this idea to explainthe pervasive production of diffuse kalpha line and tev emission from thegalactic center molecular clouds. in particular, we suggest that ic scatteringof the sub-millimeter radiation from dust by relativistic electrons maycontribute substantially to the large-scale diffuse tev emission observedtowards the central regions of the galaxy.
