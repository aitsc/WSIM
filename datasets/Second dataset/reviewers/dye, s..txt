0902.3186	strong gravitational lensing as a probe of gravity, dark-matter and  super-massive black holes	whereas considerable effort has been afforded in understanding the propertiesof galaxies, a full physical picture, connecting their baryonic and dark-mattercontent, super-massive black holes, and (metric) theories of gravity, is stillill-defined. strong gravitational lensing furnishes a powerful method to probegravity in the central regions of galaxies. it can (1) provide a uniquedetection-channel of dark-matter substructure beyond the local galaxy group,(2) constrain dark-matter physics, complementary to direct-detectionexperiments, as well as metric theories of gravity, (3) probe centralsuper-massive black holes, and (4) provide crucial insight into galaxyformation processes from the dark matter point of view, independently of thenature and state of dark matter. to seriously address the above questions, aconsiderable increase in the number of strong gravitational-lens systems isrequired. in the timeframe 2010-2020, a staged approach with radio (e.g. evla,e-merlin, lofar, ska phase-i) and optical (e.g. lsst and jdem) instruments canprovide 10^(2-4) new lenses, and up to 10^(4-6) new lens systems fromska/lsst/jdem all-sky surveys around ~2020. follow-up imaging of (radio) lensesis necessary with moderate ground/space-based optical-ir telescopes and with30-50m telescopes for spectroscopy (e.g. tmt, gmt, elt). to answer thesefundamental questions through strong gravitational lensing, a strong investmentin large radio and optical-ir facilities is therefore critical in the comingdecade. in particular, only large-scale radio lens surveys (e.g. with ska)provide the large numbers of high-resolution and high-fidelity images of lensesneeded for smbh and flux-ratio anomaly studies.

0907.1093	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields -- i. maps,  catalogues, and source counts	we present the first results from the largest deep extragalacticmillimetre-wavelength survey undertaken to date. these results are derived frommaps covering over 0.7 deg^2, made at 1.1mm, using the aztec continuum cameramounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope. the maps were made in the twofields originally targeted at 0.85mm with scuba in the shades project, namelythe lockman hole east (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mjy rms) and the subaru xmmdeep field (1.0-1.7 mjy rms). the wealth of existing and forthcoming deepmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm sourcepopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequentpapers. here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114high-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statisticalanalysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm sourcenumber counts. through careful comparison, we find that both the cosmos andgoods north fields, also imaged with aztec, contain an excess of mm sourcesover the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. in particular, ournew aztec/shades results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dustenshrouded starbursts (s_{1.1} &gt; 3 mjy) are 25-50% less common than would havebeen inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential rolesof cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. we compare number countpredictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population tothese smg surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoingrefinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, andfind that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetregalaxies found in this survey.

0910.5120	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the input catalogue and star-galaxy  separation	we describe the spectroscopic target selection for the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey. the input catalogue is drawn from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) and ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss). the aim is tomeasure redshifts for galaxies in three 4x12 degree regions at 9h, 12h and14.5h, on the celestial equator, with magnitude selections r &lt; 19.4, z &lt; 18.2and k(ab) &lt; 17.6 over all three regions, and r &lt; 19.8 in the 12-h region. thetarget density is 1080 per sq. deg. in the 12-h region and 720 per sq. deg. inthe other regions. the average gama target density and area are compared withcompleted and ongoing galaxy redshift surveys. the gama survey implements ahighly complete star-galaxy separation that jointly uses an intensity-profileseparator (delta(sg) = r-band psf mag - model mag) as per the sdss) and acolour separator. the colour separator is defined as delta(sg,jk) = j - k -f(g-i), where f(g-i) is a quadratic fit to the j-k colour of the stellar locusover the range 0.3 &lt; g-i &lt; 2.3. all galaxy populations investigated are wellseparated with delta(sg,jk) &gt; 0.2. from two years out of a three-year aaomegaprogram on the anglo-australian telescope, we have obtained 79599 unique galaxyredshifts. previously known redshifts in the gama region bring the total up to98497. the median galaxy redshift is 0.2 with 99% at z &lt; 0.5. we present someof the global statistical properties of the survey, including k-band galaxycounts, colour-redshift relations and preliminary n(z).

1003.0447	mid-infrared spectroscopy of candidate agn-dominated submillimeter  galaxies	spitzer spectroscopy has revealed that ~80% of submm galaxies (smgs) arestarburst (sb) dominated in the mid-infrared. here we focus on the remaining~20% that show signs of harboring powerful active galactic nuclei (agn). wehave obtained spitzer-irs spectroscopy of a sample of eight smgs which arecandidates for harboring powerful agn on the basis of irac color-selection(s8/s4.5&gt;2; i.e. likely power-law mid-infrared seds). smgs with an agndominating (&gt;50%) their mid-infrared emission could represent `missing link'sources in an evolutionary sequence involving a major merger. first of all, wedetect pah features in all of the smgs, indicating redshifts from 2.5-3.4,demonstrating the power of the mid-infrared to determine redshifts for theseoptically faint dusty galaxies. secondly, we see signs of both star-formation(from the pah features) and agn activity (from continuum emission) in oursample: 62% of the sample are agn-dominated in the mid-infrared with a medianagn content of 56%, compared with &lt;30% on average for typical smgs, revealingthat our irac color selection has successfully singled out sources withproportionately more agn emission than typical sb-dominated smgs. however, wefind that only about 10% of these agn dominate the bolometric emission of thesmg when the results are extrapolated to longer infrared wavelengths, implyingthat agn are not a significant power source to the smg population overall, evenwhen there is evidence in the mid-infrared for substantial agn activity. whenexisting samples of mid-infrared agn-dominated smgs are considered, we findthat s8/s4.5&gt;1.65 works well at selecting mid-infrared energetically dominantagn in smgs, implying a duty cycle of ~15% if all smgs go through a subsequentmid-infrared agn-dominated phase in the proposed evolutionary sequence.

0708.0655	a very cool brown dwarf in ukidss dr1	(abridged) we report the discovery of a very cool brown dwarf, ulasj003402.77-005206.7 (ulas j0034-00), identified in ukidss dr1. we provideoptical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared photometry of the source, and twonear-infrared spectra. comparing the spectral energy distribution of ulasj0034-00 to that of the t8 brown dwarf 2mass j0415-09, the latest-type andcoolest well-studied brown dwarf to date, with teff~750 k, we find evidencethat ulas j0034-00 is significantly cooler. first, the measured values of thenear-infrared absorption spectral indices imply a later classification, oft8.5. second, the h-[4.49] colour provides an empirical estimate of thetemperature of 540&lt;teff&lt;660 k (+/-2sig range). third, the j- and h-band peaksare somewhat narrower in ulas j0034-00, and detailed comparison againstspectral models calibrated to 2mass j0415-09 yields an estimated temperaturelower by 60-120 k relative to 2mass j0415-09 i.e. 630&lt;teff&lt;690 k (+/-2sig), andlower gravity or higher metallicity according to the degenerate combination-0.5&lt;delta(log g-2[m/h])&lt;-0.25 (+/-2sig). combining these estimates, andconsidering systematics, it is likely the temperature lies in the range600&lt;teff&lt;700 k. despite the low inferred teff we find no evidence for strongabsorption by nh3 over the wavelength range 1.51-1.56 um. evolutionary modelsimply that the mass and age are in the ranges 15-36 m(jup) and 0.5-8 gyr,respectively. the measured proper motion, of (0.37+/-0.07)arcsec/yr, combinedwith the photometrically estimated distance of 14-22 pc, implies a tangentialvelocity of ~30 km/s. ulas j0034-00 is significantly bluer than 2mass j0415-09in y-j, so future searches should allow for the possibility that cooler tdwarfs are bluer still.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2410	herschel atlas: the cosmic star formation history of quasar host  galaxies	we present a derivation of the star formation rate per comoving volume ofquasar host galaxies, derived from stacking analyses of far-infrared to mm-wavephotometry of quasars with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;6 and absolute i-band magnitudes-22&gt;i_ab&gt;-32. we use the science demonstration observations of the first ~16deg^2 from the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) inwhich there are 240 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and afurther 171 from the 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq) survey. we supplement thisdata with a compilation of data from iras, iso, spitzer, scuba and mambo.h-atlas alone statistically detects the quasars in its survey area at &gt;5sigmaat 250, 350 and 500um. from the compilation as a whole we find strikingevidence of downsizing in quasar host galaxy formation: low-luminosity quasarswith absolute magnitudes in the range -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 have a comoving starformation rate (derived from 100um rest-frame luminosities) peaking betweenredshifts of 1 and 2, while high-luminosity quasars with i_ab&lt;-26 have amaximum contribution to the star formation density at z~3. the volume-averagedstar formation rate of -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 quasars evolves as (1+z)^{2.3 +/- 0.7} atz&lt;2, but the evolution at higher luminosities is much faster reaching (1+z)^{10+/- 1} at -26&gt;i_ab&gt;-28. we tentatively interpret this as a combination of adeclining major merger rate with time and gas consumption reducing fuel forboth black hole accretion and star formation.

1011.3048	which halos host herschel-atlas galaxies in the local universe?	we measure the projected cross-correlation between low redshift (z &lt; 0.5)far-ir selected galaxies in the sdp field of the herschel-atlas (h-atlas)survey and optically selected galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)redshift survey. in order to obtain robust correlation functions, we restrictthe analysis to a subset of 969 out of 6900 h-atlas galaxies, which havereliable optical counterparts with r&lt;19.4 mag and well-determined spectroscopicredshifts. the overlap region between the two surveys is 12.6 sq. deg; thematched sample has a median redshift of z ~ 0.2. the cross-correlation of gamaand h-atlas galaxies within this region can be fitted by a power law, withcorrelation length r_0 ~ 4.63 +/- 0.51 mpc. comparing with the correspondingauto-correlation function of gama galaxies within the sdp field yields arelative bias (averaged over 2-8 mpc) of h-atlas and gama galaxies of b_h/b_g ~0.6. combined with clustering measurements from previous optical studies, thisindicates that most of the low redshift h-atlas sources are hosted by haloswith masses comparable to that of the milky way. the correlation functionappears to depend on the 250 um luminosity, l_250, with bright (medianluminosity \nu l_250 ~ 1.6 x 10^10 l_sun) objects being somewhat more stronglyclustered than faint (\nu l_250 ~ 4.0 x 10^9 l_sun) objects. this implies thatgalaxies with higher dust-obscured star formation rates are hosted by moremassive halos.

1012.5186	herschel-atlas: rapid evolution of dust in galaxies in the last 5  billion years	we present the first direct and unbiased measurement of the evolution of thedust mass function of galaxies over the past 5 billion years of cosmic historyusing data from the science demonstration phase of the herschel-atlas. thesample consists of galaxies selected at 250{\mu}m which have reliablecounterparts from sdss at z &lt; 0.5, and contains 1867 sources. dust masses arecalculated using both a single temperature grey-body model for the spectralenergy distribution and also using a model with multiple temperaturecomponents. the dust temperature for either model shows no trend with redshift.splitting the sample into bins of redshift reveals a strong evolution in thedust properties of the most massive galaxies. at z = 0.4 - 0.5, massivegalaxies had dust masses about five times larger than in the local universe. atthe same time, the dust-to-stellar mass ratio was about 3-4 times larger, andthe optical depth derived from fitting the uv-sub-mm data with an energybalance model was also higher. this increase in the dust content of massivegalaxies at high redshift is difficult to explain using standard dust evolutionmodels and requires a rapid gas consumption timescale together with either amore top-heavy imf, efficient mantle growth, less dust destruction orcombinations of all three. this evolution in dust mass is likely to beassociated with a change in overall ism mass, and points to an enhanced supplyof fuel for star formation at earlier cosmic epochs.

1103.3080	gama/h-atlas: the ultraviolet spectral slope and obscuration in galaxies	we use multiwavelength data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) andherschel atlas (h-atlas) surveys to compare the relationship between variousdust obscuration measures in galaxies. we explore the connections between theultraviolet (uv) spectral slope, $\beta$, the balmer decrement, and the farinfrared (ir) to $150\,$nm far ultraviolet (fuv) luminosity ratio. we exploretrends with galaxy mass, star formation rate (sfr) and redshift in order toidentify possible systematics in these various measures. we reiterate thefinding of other authors that there is a large scatter between the balmerdecrement and the $\beta$ parameter, and that $\beta$ may be poorly constrainedwhen derived from only two broad passbands in the uv. we also emphasise thatfuv derived sfrs, corrected for dust obscuration using $\beta$, will beoverestimated unless a modified relation between $\beta$ and the attenuationfactor is used. even in the optimum case, the resulting sfrs have a significantscatter, well over an order of magnitude. while there is a stronger correlationbetween the ir to fuv luminosity ratio and $\beta$ parameter than with thebalmer decrement, neither of these correlations are particularly tight, anddust corrections based on $\beta$ for high redshift galaxy sfrs must be treatedwith caution. we conclude with a description of the extent to which thedifferent obscuration measures are consistent with each other as well as theeffects of including other galactic properties on these correlations.

1103.3905	herschel-atlas: the link between accretion luminosity and star formation  in quasar host galaxies	we use the science demonstration field data of the herschel-atlas to studyhow star formation, traced by the far-infrared herschel data, is related toboth the accretion luminosity and redshift of quasars selected from the sloandigital sky survey and the 2slaq survey. by developing a maximum likelihoodestimator to investigate the presence of correlations between the far-infraredand optical luminosities we find evidence that the star-formation in quasarhosts is correlated with both redshift and quasar accretion luminosity.assuming a relationship of the form l_ir \propto l_qso^{\theta} (1 +z)^{\zeta}, we find {\theta} = 0.22 +/- 0.08 and {\zeta} = 1.6 +/- 0.4,although there is substantial additional uncertainty in {\zeta} of order +/- 1,due to uncertainties in the host galaxy dust temperature. we find evidence fora large intrinsic dispersion in the redshift dependence, but no evidence forintrinsic dispersion in the correlation between l_qso and l_ir, suggesting thatthe latter may be due to a direct physical connection between star formationand black hole accretion. this is consistent with the idea that both the quasaractivity and star formation are dependent on the same reservoir of cold gas, sothat they are both affected by the influx of cold gas during mergers or heatingof gas via feedback processes.

1105.3199	herschel-atlas: detection of a far-infrared population around galaxy  clusters	we report the detection of a significant excess in the surface density offar-infrared sources from the herschel-astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) within ~1 mpc of the centres of 66 optically-selected clustersof galaxies in the sdss with &lt;z&gt;~0.25. from the analysis of the multiwavelengthproperties of their counterparts we conclude that the far-infrared emission isassociated with dust-obscured star formation and/or active galactic nucleiwithin galaxies in the clusters themselves. the excess reaches a maximum at aradius of ~0.8 mpc, where we find 1.0\pm0.3 s_250um&gt;34 mjy sources on averageper cluster above what would be expected for random field locations. if thefar-infrared emission is dominated by star formation (as opposed to agn) thenthis corresponds to an average star formation rate of ~7 m_sun/yr per clusterin sources with l_ir&gt;5d10 l_sun. although lensed sources make a negligiblecontribution to the excess signal, a fraction of the sources around theclusters could be gravitationally lensed, and we have identified a sample ofpotential cases of cluster-lensed herschel sources that could be targeted infollow-up studies.

1105.3924	physical conditions of the interstellar medium of high-redshift,  strongly lensed submillimetre galaxies from the herschel-atlas	we present herschel-spire fourier transform spectrometer (fts) and radiofollow-up observations of two herschel-atlas (h-atlas) detected strongly lenseddistant galaxies. in one of the targeted galaxies h-atlas j090311.6+003906(sdp.81) we detect [oiii] 88\mum and [cii] 158\mum lines at a signal-to-noiseratio of ~5. we do not have any positive line identification in the otherfainter target h-atlas j091305.0-005343 (sdp.130). currently sdp.81 is thefaintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the fts, withcontinuum flux just below 200 mjy in the 200-600 \mum wavelength range. thederived redshift of sdp.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 +/-0.012, inagreement with ground-based co measurements. this is the first detection byherschel of the [oiii] 88\mum line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05.comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociationregion (pdr) models with different physical conditions, we derive the pdr clouddensity n ~ 2000 cm^{-3} and the far-uv ionizing radiation field g_0 ~ 200 (inunits of the habing field -- the local galactic interstellar radiation field of1.6x10^{-6} w/m^2). using the co derived molecular mass and the pdr propertieswe estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. thesecharacteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. the radioobservations indicate that sdp.81 deviates significantly from the localfir/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission iscoming from an agn. the constraints on the source size from millimiter-waveobservations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible agncontribution to less than 33%. these indications, together with the high[oiii]/fir ratio and the upper limit of [oi] 63\mum/[cii] 158\mum suggest thatsome fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an agn.

1106.6195	the environment and characteristics of low redshift galaxies detected by  the herschel-atlas	we investigate the ultraviolet and optical properties and environment of lowredshift galaxies detected in the herschel astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) science demonstration data. we use the sloan digital skysurvey seventh release and the galaxy and mass assembly database to selectgalaxies with r_petro &lt; 19.0 mag in the redshift range 0.02 &lt; z &lt; 0.2 and lookfor their submillimeter counterparts in h-atlas. our results show that at lowredshift, h-atlas detects mainly blue/star-forming galaxies with a minorcontribution from red systems which are highly obscured by dust. in addition wefind that the colour of a galaxy rather than the local density of itsenvironment determines whether it is detectable by h-atlas. the average dusttemperature of galaxies that are simultaneously detected by both pacs and spireis 25k \pm 4k, independent of environment. this analysis provides a glimpse ofthe potential of the h-atlas data to investigate the submillimeter propertiesof galaxies in the local universe.

1107.2924	gas and dust in a submillimeter galaxy at z = 4.24 from the herschel  atlas	we report ground-based follow-up observations of the exceptional source,id141, one the brightest sources detected so far in the h-atlas cosmologicalsurvey. id141 was observed using the iram 30-meter telescope and plateau debure interferometer (pdbi), the submillimeter array (sma) and the atacamapathfinder experiment (apex) submillimeter telescope to measure the dustcontinuum and emission lines of the main isotope of carbon monoxide and carbon([c i] and [c ii]). the detection of strong co emission lines with the pdbiconfirms that id141 is at high redshift (z=4.243 +/- 0.001). the strength ofthe continuum and emission lines suggests that id141 is gravitationally lensed.the width (delta v (fwhm) ~ 800 km/s}) and asymmetric profiles of the co andcarbon lines indicate orbital motion in a disc or a merger. the propertiesderived for id141 are compatible with a ultraluminous (l_fir ~ 8.5 +/- 0.3 x10^13/mu_l lsun, where mu_l is the amplification factor, dense (n ~ 10^4 cm^-3)and warm (t_kin ~ 40k) starburst galaxy, with an estimated star-formation rateof (0.7 to 1.7) x 10^4/mu_l msun/yr. the carbon emission lines indicate a dense(n ~ 10^4 cm^-3) photo-dominated region, illuminated by a far-uv radiationfield a few thousand times more intense than that in our galaxy. in conclusion,the physical properties of the high-z galaxy, id141, are remarkably similar tothose of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies.

1107.4979	observation of h2o in a strongly lensed herschel-atlas source at z=2.3	the herschel survey, h-atlas, with its large areal coverage, has recentlydiscovered a number of bright, strongly lensed high-z submillimeter galaxies.the strong magnification makes it possible to study molecular species otherthan co, which are otherwise difficult to observe in high-z galaxies. among thelensed galaxies already identified by h-atlas, the source j090302.9-014127b(sdp.17b) at z = 2.305 is remarkable due to its excitation conditions and atentative detection of the h2o 202-111 emission line (lupu et al. 2010). wereport observations of this line in sdp.17b using the iram interferometerequipped with its new 277- 371ghz receivers. the h2o line is detected at aredshift of z = 2.3049+/-0.0006, with a flux of 7.8+/-0.5 jy km s-1 and a fwhmof 250+/-60 km s-1. the new flux is 2.4 times weaker than the previoustentative detection, although both remain marginally consistent within1.6-sigma. the intrinsic line luminosity and ratio of h2o(202-111)/co8-7 seemcomparable with those of the nearby starburst/enshrouded-agn mrk 231,suggesting that sdp.17b could also host a luminous agn. the detection of astrong h2o 202-111 line in sdp.17b implies an efficient excitation mechanism ofthe water levels that must occur in very dense and warm interstellar gas.

1108.3911	herschel-atlas galaxy counts and high redshift luminosity functions: the  formation of massive early type galaxies	exploiting the herschel-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp) survey data,we have determined the luminosity functions (lfs) at rest-frame wavelengths of100 and 250 micron and at several redshifts z&gt;1, for bright sub-mm galaxieswith star formation rates (sfr) &gt;100 m_sun/yr. we find that the evolution ofthe comoving lf is strong up to z~2.5, and slows down at higher redshifts. fromthe lfs and the information on halo masses inferred from clustering analysis,we derived an average relation between sfr and halo mass (and its scatter). wealso infer that the timescale of the main episode of dust-enshrouded starformation in massive halos (m_h&gt;3*10^12 m_sun) amounts to ~7*10^8 yr. given thesfrs, which are in the range 10^2-10^3 m_sun/yr, this timescale implies finalstellar masses of order of 10^11-10^12 m_sun. the corresponding stellar massfunction matches the observed mass function of passively evolving galaxies atz&gt;1. the comparison of the statistics for sub-mm and uv selected galaxiessuggests that the dust-free, uv bright phase, is &gt;10^2 times shorter than thesub-mm bright phase, implying that the dust must form soon after the onset ofstar formation. using a single reference spectral energy distribution (sed; theone of the z~2.3 galaxy smm j2135-0102), our simple physical model is able toreproduce not only the lfs at different redshifts &gt; 1 but also the counts atwavelengths ranging from 250 micron to ~1 mm. owing to the steepness of thecounts and their relatively broad frequency range, this result suggests thatthe dispersion of sub-mm seds of z&gt;1 galaxies around the reference one israther small.

1109.6274	h-atlas/gama: dusty early-type galaxies and passive spirals	we present the dust properties and star-formation histories of localsubmillimetre-selected galaxies in herschel-atlas, classified by opticalmorphology. the early-type galaxies (etgs) that are detected contain as muchdust as typical spirals, and form a unique sample that has been blindlyselected at submillimetre wavelengths.  comparing h-atlas galaxies to a control sample of optically selectedgalaxies, we find 5.5% of luminous etgs are detected in h-atlas. the h-atlasetgs contain a significant mass of cold dust: the mean dust mass is 5.5x10^7msun, with individual galaxies ranging from 9x10^5-4x10^8 msun. this iscomparable to that of spirals in our sample, and is an order of magnitude moredust than that found for the control etgs, which have a median dust massinferred from stacking of (0.8-4.0)x10^6 msun. the etgs detected in h-atlashave bluer nuv-r colours, higher specific star-formation rates and youngerstellar populations than etgs which are optically selected, and may betransitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence. we also find thath-atlas and control etgs inhabit similar low-density environments. we concludethat the dust in h-atlas and control etgs cannot be solely from stellarsources, and a large contribution from dust formed in the ism or externalsources is required. alternatively, dust destruction may not be as efficient aspredicted.  we also explore the properties of the most passive spiral galaxies in oursample with ssfr&lt;10^-11/yr. we find these passive spirals have lowerdust-to-stellar mass ratios, higher stellar masses and older stellar populationages than normal spirals. the passive spirals inhabit low density environmentssimilar to those of the normal spiral galaxies in our sample. this shows thatthe processes which turn spirals passive do not occur solely in theintermediate density environments of group and cluster outskirts.

1112.3653	spitzer irac identification of herschel-atlas spire sources	we use spitzer-irac data to identify near-infrared counterparts tosubmillimeter galaxies detected with herschel-spire at 250um in the herschelastrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas). using a likelihood ratioanalysis we identify 146 reliable irac counterparts to 123 spire sources out ofthe 159. we find that, compared to the field population, the spire counterpartsoccupy a distinct region of 3.6 and 4.5um color-magnitude space, and we usethis property to identify a further 23 counterparts to 13 spire sources. theirac identification rate of 86% is significantly higher than those that havebeen demonstrated with wide-field ground-based optical and near-ir imaging ofherschel fields. we estimate a false identification rate of 3.6%, correspondingto 4 to 5 sources. among the 73 counterparts that are undetected in sdss, 57have both 3.6 and 4.5um coverage. of these 43 have [3.6] - [4.5]&gt; 0 indicatingthat they are likely to be at z &gt; 1.4. thus, ~ 40% of identified spire galaxiesare likely to be high redshift (z &gt; 1.4) sources. we discuss the statisticalproperties of the irac-identified spire galaxy sample including far-irluminosities, dust temperatures, star-formation rates, and stellar masses. themajority of our detected galaxies have 10^10 to 10^11 l_sun total irluminosities and are not intense starbursting galaxies as those found at z ~ 2,but they have a factor of 2 to 3 above average specific star-formation ratescompared to near-ir selected galaxy samples.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1202.0402	herschel-atlas: towards a sample of ~1000 strongly-lensed galaxies	while the selection of strongly lensed galaxies with 500{\mu}m flux densitys_500&gt;100 mjy has proven to be rather straightforward (negrello et al. 2010),for many applications it is important to analyze samples larger than the onesobtained when confining ourselves to such a bright limit. moreover, only byprobing to fainter flux densities is possible to exploit strong lensing toinvestigate the bulk of the high-z star-forming galaxy population. we describehalos (the herschel-atlas lensed objects selection), a method for efficientlyselecting fainter candidate strongly lensed galaxies, reaching a surfacedensity of ~1.5-2 deg^-2, i.e. a factor of about 4 to 6 higher than that at the100 mjy flux limit. halos will allow the selection of up to ~1000 candidatestrongly lensed galaxies (with amplifications \mu&gt;2) over the full h-atlassurvey area. applying halos to the h-atlas science demonstration phase field(~14.4 deg^2) we find 31 candidate strongly lensed galaxies, whose candidatelenses are identified in the viking near-infrared catalog. using the availableinformation on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a~72% purity of the sample. the redshift distribution of the candidate lensedsources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensedgalaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to substantially higherredshifts than found in the other surveys. the counts of candidate stronglylensed galaxies are also in good agreement with model predictions (lapi et al.2011). even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infraredviking photometry, we show that h-atlas data alone allow the selection of asimilarly deep sample of candidate strongly lensed galaxies with an efficiencyclose to 50%; a slightly lower surface density (~1.45 deg^-2) can be reachedwith a ~70% efficiency.

(2012), where known blazars are concentrated in welldefined strips. this suggests that the majority of them either are not blazarsor have spectral energy distributions contaminated by their host galaxies. asignificant fraction of true blazars are found to be hosted by star-forminggalaxies. this finding, supported by an analysis of blazars detected in planck545 and 857 ghz bands, is at odds with the notion that blazar hosts are passiveellipticals and indicates that the sub-mm selection is providing a novelprospect on blazar properties. based on an inspection of the availablephotometric data, including the wise all-sky survey, the unpublished vikingsurvey and new radio observations, we tentatively estimate that there are 11blazars with synchrotron flux density s500{\mu}m &gt; 35mjy over the consideredarea. this result already allows us to constrain blazar evolution models.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

1207.2724	a detailed gravitational lens model based on submillimeter array and  keck adaptive optics imaging of a herschel-atlas sub-millimeter galaxy at  z=4.243	we present high-spatial resolution imaging obtained with the submillimeterarray (sma) at 880um and the keck adaptive optics (ao) system at ks-band of agravitationally lensed sub-millimeter galaxy (smg) at z=4.243 discovered in theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey. the sma data (angularresolution ~0.6") resolve the dust emission into multiple lensed images, whilethe keck ao ks-band data (angular resolution ~0.1") resolve the lens into apair of galaxies separated by 0.3". we present an optical spectrum of theforeground lens obtained with the gemini-south telescope that provides a lensredshift of z_lens = 0.595 +/- 0.005. we develop and apply a new lens modelingtechnique in the visibility plane that shows that the smg is magnified by afactor of mu = 4.1 +/- 0.2 and has an intrinsic infrared (ir) luminosity ofl_ir = (2.1 +/- 0.2) x 10^13 lsun. we measure a half-light radius of thebackground source of r_s = 4.4 +/- 0.5 kpc which implies an ir luminositysurface density of sigma_ir = (3.4 +/- 0.9) x 10^11 lsun kpc^-2, a value thatis typical of z &gt; 2 smgs but significantly lower than ir luminous galaxies atz~0. the two lens galaxies are compact (r_lens ~ 0.9 kpc) early-types witheinstein radii of theta_e1 = 0.57 +/- 0.01 and theta_e2 = 0.40 +/- 0.01 thatimply masses of m_lens1 = (7.4 +/- 0.5) x 10^10 msun and m_lens2 = (3.7 +/-0.3) x 10^10 msun. the two lensing galaxies are likely about to undergo adissipationless merger, and the mass and size of the resultant system should besimilar to other early-type galaxies at z~0.6. this work highlights theimportance of high spatial resolution imaging in developing models of stronglylensed galaxies discovered by herschel.

1208.6009	cosmograil: the cosmological monitoring of gravitational lenses xiii:  time delays and 9-yr optical monitoring of the lensed quasar rx j1131-1231	we present the results from nine years of optically monitoring thegravitationally lensed z=0.658 quasar rx j1131-1231. the r-band light curves ofthe four individual images of the quasar were obtained using deconvolutionphotometry for a total of 707 epochs. several sharp quasar variability featuresstrongly constrain the time delays between the quasar images. using threedifferent numerical techniques, we measure these delays for all possible pairsof quasar images while always processing the four light curves simultaneously.for all three methods, the delays between the three close images a, b, and care compatible with being 0, while we measure the delay of image d to be 91days, with a fractional uncertainty of 1.5% (1 sigma), including systematicerrors. our analysis of random and systematic errors accounts in a realisticway for the observed quasar variability, fluctuating microlensing magnificationover a broad range of temporal scales, noise properties, and seasonal gaps.finally, we find that our time-delay measurement methods yield compatibleresults when applied to subsets of the data.

1209.0670	herschel-atlas: the far-infrared properties and star-formation rates of  broad absorption line quasi-stellar objects	we have used data from the herschel-atlas at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m todetermine the far-infrared (fir) properties of 50 broad absorption line quasars(bal qsos). our sample contains 49 high-ionization bal qsos (hibals) and 1low-ionization bal qso (lobal) which are compared against a sample of 329non-bal qsos. these samples are matched over the redshift range 1.5 \leq z &lt;2.3 and in absolute i-band magnitude over the range -28 \leq m_{i} \leq -24. ofthese, 3 bal qsos (hibals) and 27 non-bal qsos are detected at the &gt; 5 sigmalevel. we calculate star-formation rates (sfr) for our individually detectedhibal qsos and the non-detected lobal qso as well as average sfrs for the baland non-bal qso samples based on stacking the herschel data. we find nodifference between the hibal and non-bal qso samples in the fir, even whenseparated based on differing bal qso classifications. using mrk 231 as atemplate, the weighted mean sfr is estimated to be \approx240\pm21 m_{\odot}yr^{-1} for the full sample, although this figure should be treated as an upperlimit if agn-heated dust makes a contribution to the fir emission. despitetentative claims in the literature, we do not find a dependence of {\sc c\,iv}equivalent width on fir emission, suggesting that the strength of any outflowin these objects is not linked to their fir output. these results stronglysuggest that bal qsos (more specifically hibals) can be accommodated within asimple agn unified scheme in which our line-of-sight to the nucleus intersectsoutflowing material. models in which hibals are caught towards the end of aperiod of enhanced spheroid and black-hole growth, during which a windterminates the star-formation activity, are not supported by the observed firproperties.

1211.6440	herschel-atlas/gama: a difference between star-formation rates in  strong-line and weak-line radio galaxies	we have constructed a sample of radio-loud objects with optical spectroscopyfrom the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project over the herschel-atlas phase1 fields. classifying the radio sources in terms of their optical spectra, wefind that strong-emission-line sources (`high-excitation radio galaxies') have,on average, a factor ~4 higher 250-micron herschel luminosity than weak-line(`low-excitation') radio galaxies and are also more luminous thanmagnitude-matched radio-quiet galaxies at the same redshift. using all fiveh-atlas bands, we show that this difference in luminosity between theemission-line classes arises mostly from a difference in the average dusttemperature; strong-emission-line sources tend to have comparable dust massesto, but higher dust temperatures than, radio galaxies with weak emission lines.we interpret this as showing that radio galaxies with strong nuclear emissionlines are much more likely to be associated with star formation in their hostgalaxy, although there is certainly not a one-to-one relationship between starformation and strong-line agn activity. the strong-line sources are estimatedto have star-formation rates at least a factor 3-4 higher than those in theweak-line objects. our conclusion is consistent with earlier work, generallycarried out using much smaller samples, and reinforces the general picture ofhigh-excitation radio galaxies as being located in lower-mass, less evolvedhost galaxies than their low-excitation counterparts.

1301.6618	h2o emission in high-z ultra-luminous infrared galaxies	using iram pdbi we report the detection of h2o in six new lensedultra-luminous starburst galaxies at high redshift, discovered in the herschelh-atlas survey. the sources are detected either in the 2_{02}-1_{11} or2_{11}-2_{02} h_2o emission lines with integrated line fluxes ranging from 1.8to 14 jy.km/s. the corresponding apparent luminosities are mu x l_h2o ~ 3-12 x10^8 lo, where mu is the lensing magnification factor (3 &lt; mu &lt; 12). theseresults confirm that h2o lines are among the strongest molecular lines in suchgalaxies, with intensities almost comparable to those of the high-j co lines,and same profiles and line widths (200-900 km/s) as the latter. with thecurrent sensitivity of pdbi, h2o can therefore easily be detected in high-zlensed galaxies (with f(500um) &gt; 100 mjy) discovered in the herschel surveys.correcting the luminosities for lensing amplification, l_h2o is found to have astrong dependence on the ir luminosity, varying as ~l_ir^{1.2}. this relationwhich needs to be confirmed with better statistics, may indicate a role ofradiative (ir) excitation of the h2o lines, and implies that high-z galaxieswith l_ir &gt;~ 10^13 lo tend to be very strong emitters in h2o, that have noequivalent in the local universe.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1403.2995	the dust budget crisis in high-redshift submillimetre galaxies	we apply a chemical evolution model to investigate the sources and evolutionof dust in a sample of 26 high-redshift ($z&gt;1$) submillimetre galaxies (smgs)from the literature, with complete photometry from ultraviolet to thesubmillimetre. we show that dust produced only by low-intermediate mass starsfalls a factor 240 short of the observed dust masses of smgs, the well-known`dust-budget crisis'. adding an extra source of dust from supernovae canaccount for the dust mass in 19 per cent of the smg sample. even afteraccounting for dust produced by supernovae the remaining deficit in the dustmass budget provides support for higher supernova yields, substantial graingrowth in the interstellar medium or a top-heavy imf. including efficientdestruction of dust by supernova shocks increases the tension between our modeland observed smg dust masses. the models which best reproduce the physicalproperties of smgs have a rapid build-up of dust from both stellar andinterstellar sources and minimal dust destruction. alternatively, invoking atop-heavy imf or significant changes in the dust grain properties can solve thedust budget crisis only if dust is produced by both low mass stars andsupernovae and is not efficiently destroyed by supernova shocks.

1406.1487	lens models of herschel-selected galaxies from high-resolution near-ir  observations	we present keck-adaptive optics and hubble space telescope high resolutionnear-infrared (ir) imaging for 500 um-bright candidate lensing systemsidentified by the herschel multi-tiered extra-galactic survey (hermes) andherschel astrophysical terahertz survey (h-atlas). out of 87 candidates withnear-ir imaging, 15 (~17%) display clear near-ir lensing morphologies. wepresent near-ir lens models to reconstruct and recover basic rest-frame opticalmorphological properties of the background galaxies from 12 new systems.sources with the largest near-ir magnification factors also tend to be the mostcompact, consistent with the size bias predicted from simulations and pre-vious lensing models for sub-millimeter galaxies. for four new sources thatalso have high-resolution sub-mm maps, we test for differential lensing betweenthe stellar and dust components and find that the 880 um magnification factor(u_880) is ~1.5 times higher than the near-ir magnification factor (u_nir), onaverage. we also find that the stellar emission is ~2 times more extended insize than dust. the rest-frame optical properties of our sample ofherschel-selected lensed smgs are consistent with those of unlensed smgs, whichsuggests that the two populations are similar.

1407.5994	colour matters: the effects of lensing on the positional offsets between  optical and submillimetre galaxies in herschel-atlas	we report an unexpected variation in the positional offset distributionsbetween herschel-atlas sub-millimetre (submm) sources and their opticalassociations, depending on both 250-{\mu}m signal-to-noise ratio and250/350-{\mu}m colour. we show that redder and brighter submm sources haveoptical associations with a broader distribution of positional offsets thanwould be expected if these offsets were due to random positional errors in thesource extraction. the observation can be explained by two possible effects:either red submm sources trace a more clustered population than blue ones, andtheir positional errors are increased by confusion; or red submm sources aregenerally at high redshifts and are frequently associated with low-redshiftlensing structures which are identified as false counterparts. we performvarious analyses of the data, including the multiplicity of opticalassociations, the redshift and magnitude distributions in h-atlas in comparisonto hermes, and simulations of weak lensing, and we conclude that the effectsare most likely to be explained by widespread weak lensing of herschel-spiresources by foreground structures. this has important consequences forcounterpart identification and derived redshift distributions and luminosityfunctions of submm surveys.

1503.08720	revealing the complex nature of the strong gravitationally lensed system  h-atlas j090311.6+003906 using alma	we have modelled atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array (alma) longbaseline imaging of the strong gravitational lens system h-atlasj090311.6+003906 (sdp.81). we have reconstructed the distribution of band 6 and7 continuum emission in the z=3.042 source and we have determined its kinematicproperties by reconstructing co(5-4) and co(8-7) line emission in bands 4 and6. the continuum imaging reveals a highly non-uniform distribution of dust withclumps on scales of 200 pc. in contrast, the co line emission shows arelatively smooth, disk-like velocity field which is well fit by a rotatingdisk model with an inclination angle of 40+/-5 degrees and an asymptoticrotation velocity of 320 km/s. the inferred dynamical mass within 1.5kpc is(3.5+/-0.5)x10^{10} m_sol which is comparable to the total molecular gas massesof (2.7+/-0.5)x10^{10} m_sol and (3.5+/-0.6)x10^{10} m_sol from the dustcontinuum emission and co emission respectively. our new reconstruction of thelensed hst near-infrared emission shows two objects which appear to beinteracting, with the rotating disk of gas and dust revealed by alma distinctlyoffset from the near-infrared emission. the clumpy nature of the dust and a lowvalue of the toomre parameter of q=0.3 suggest that the disk is in a state ofcollapse. we estimate a star formation rate in the disk of 470+/-80 m_sol/yrwith an efficiency 65 times greater than typical low-redshift galaxies. ourfindings add to the growing body of evidence that the most infra-red luminous,dust obscured galaxies in the high redshift universe represent a population ofmerger induced starbursts.

1505.06947	h-atlas/gama and hevics - dusty early-type galaxies in different  environments	the herschel space observatory has had a tremendous impact on the study ofextragalactic dust. specifically, early-type galaxies (etg) have been the focusof several studies. in this paper we combine results from two herschel studies- a virgo cluster study hevics and a broader, low-redshift h-atlas/gama study -and contrast the dust and associated properties for similar mass galaxies. thiscomparison is motivated by differences in results exhibited between multipleherschel studies of early-type galaxies. a comparison between consistentmodified blackbody derived dust mass is carried out, revealing strongdifferences between the two samples in both dust mass and dust-to-stellar massratio. in particular, the hevics sample lacks massive etg with as high aspecific dust content as found in h-atlas. this is most likely connected withthe difference in environment for the two samples. we calculate nearestneighbour environment densities in a consistent way, showing that h-atlas etgoccupy sparser regions of the local universe, whereas hevics etg occupy denseregions. this is also true for etg that are not herschel-detected but are inthe virgo and gama parent samples. spectral energy distributions are fit to thepanchromatic data. from these we find that in h-atlas the specific starformation rate anticorrelates with stellar mass and reaches values as high asin our galaxy. on the other hand hevics etg appear to have little starformation. based on the trends found here, h-atlas etg are thought to have moreextended star formation histories and a younger stellar population than hevicsetg.

astro-ph;0002011	gravitational lens magnification by abell 1689: distortion of the  background galaxy luminosity function	gravitational lensing magnifies the luminosity of galaxies behind the lens.we use this effect to constrain the total mass in the cluster abell 1689 bycomparing the lensed luminosities of background galaxies with the luminosityfunction of an undistorted field. since galaxies are assumed to be a randomsampling of luminosity space, this method is not limited by clustering noise.we use photometric redshift information to estimate galaxy distance andintrinsic luminosity. knowing the redshift distribution of the backgroundpopulation allows us to lift the mass/background degeneracy common to lensinganalysis. in this paper we use 9 filters observed over 12 hours with the calaralto 3.5m telescope to determine the redshifts of 1000 galaxies in the field ofabell 1689. using a complete sample of 151 background galaxies we measure thecluster mass profile. we find that the total projected mass interior to0.25h^(-1)mpc is (0.48 +/- 0.16) * 10^(15)h^(-1) solar masses, where our errorbudget includes uncertainties from the photometric redshift determination, theuncertainty in the off-set calibration and finite sampling. this result is ingood agreement with that found by number count and shear-based methods andprovides a new and independent method to determine cluster masses.

astro-ph;0009499	measurement of intrinsic alignments in galaxy ellipticities	we measure the alignment of galaxy ellipticities in the local universe over arange of scales using digitized photographic data from the supercosmos skysurvey. we find for a magnitude cut of b_j &lt; 20.5, corresponding to a mediangalaxy redshift of z = 0.1, and 2x10^6 galaxies, that the galaxy ellipticitiesexhibit a non-zero correlation over a range of scales between 1 and 100arcminutes. in particular, we measure the variance of mean galaxyellipticities, sg^2(theta), in square angular cells on the sky as a function ofcell size and find it lies in the range, 2 x 10^{-4} &gt; sg^2(theta) &gt; 1 x10^{-5} for cell side lengths between 15 &lt; theta &lt; 100 arcminutes. consideringthe low median redshift of the galaxies in the sample and hence the relativelylow effective cross-section for lensing of these galaxies by the large-scalestructure of the universe, we propose that we have detected an intrinsicalignment of galaxy ellipticities. we compare our results to recent analyticaland numerical predictions made for the intrinsic galaxy alignment and find goodagreement. we discuss the importance of these results for measuring cosmicshear from upcoming shallow surveys (e.g. sloan digital sky survey) and weoutline how these measurements could possibly be used to constrain models ofgalaxy formation and/or measure the mass distribution in the local universe.

astro-ph;0108399	lens magnification by cl0024+1654 in the u and r band	[abridged] we estimate the total mass distribution of the galaxy clustercl0024+1654 from the measured source depletion due to lens magnification in ther band. within a radius of 0.54mpc/h, a total projected mass of(8.1+/-3.2)*10^14 m_sol/h (eds) is measured, which corresponds to a mass-to-light ratio of m/l(b)=470+/-180. we compute the luminosity function ofcl0024+1654 in order to estimate contamination of the background source countsfrom cluster galaxies. three different magnification-based reconstructionmethods are employed using both local and non-local techniques. we havemodified the standard single power-law slope number count theory to incorporatea break and applied this to our observations. fitting analytical magnificationprofiles of different cluster models to the observed number counts, we findthat the cluster is best described either by a nfw model with scale radiusr_s=334+/-191 kpc/h and normalisation kappa_s=0.23+/-0.08 or a power-lawprofile with slope xi=0.61+/-0.11, central surface mass densitykappa_0=1.52+/-0.20 and assuming a core radius of r_core=35 kpc/h. the nfwmodel predicts that the cumulative projected mass contained within a radius rscales as m(&lt;r)=2.9*10^14*(r/1')^[1.3-0.5lg (r/1')] m_sol/h. finally, we haveexploited the fact that flux magnification effectively enables us to probedeeper than the physical limiting magnitude of our observations in searchingfor a change of slope in the u band number counts. we rule out both a totalflattening of the counts with a break up to u_ab&lt;=26.6 and a change of slope,reported by some studies, from dlog n/dm=0.4-&gt;0.15 up to u_ab&lt;=26.4 with 95%confidence.

astro-ph;0403666	a catalogue of the chandra deep field south with multi-colour  classification and photometric redshifts from combo-17	we present the combo-17 object catalogue of the chandra deep field south forpublic use, covering a field which is 31.5' x 30' in size. this catalogue listsastrometry, photometry in 17 passbands from 350 to 930 nm, and ground-basedmorphological data for 63,501 objects. the catalogue also contains multi-colourclassification into the categories 'star', 'galaxy' and 'quasar' as well asphotometric redshifts. we include restframe luminosities in johnson, sdss andbessell passbands and estimated errors. the redshifts are most reliable atr&lt;24, where the sample contains approximately 100 quasars, 1000 stars and 10000galaxies. we use nearly 1000 spectroscopically identified objects inconjunction with detailed simulations to characterize the performance ofcombo-17. we show that the selection of quasars, more generally type-1 agn, isnearly complete and minimally contaminated at z=[0.5,5] for luminosities abovem_b=-21.7. their photometric redshifts are accurate to roughly 5000 km/sec.galaxy redshifts are accurate to 1% in dz/(1+z) at r&lt;21. they degrade inquality for progressively fainter galaxies, reaching accuracies of 2% forgalaxies with r~222 and of 10% for galaxies with r&gt;24. the selection of starsis complete to r~23, and deeper for m stars. we also present an updateddiscussion of our classification technique with maps of survey completeness,and discuss possible failures of the statistical classification in the faintregime at r&gt;24.

astro-ph;0404527	the influence of redshift information on galaxy-galaxy lensing  measurements	we investigate how galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements depend on the knowledgeof redshifts for lens and source galaxies. galaxy-galaxy lensing allows one tostudy dark matter halos of galaxies statistically using weak gravitationallensing. redshift information is required to reliably distinguish foregroundlens galaxies from background source galaxies and to convert the measured shearinto constraints on the lens model. without spectroscopy or multi-colourinformation, redshifts can be drawn from independently estimated probabilitydistributions. the combo-17 survey provides redshifts for both lens and sourcegalaxies. it thus offers the unique possibility to do this investigation withobservational data. we find that it is of great importance to know theredshifts of individual lens galaxies in order to constrain the properties oftheir dark matter halos. whether the redshifts are derived from $ubvri$ or thelarger number of filters available in combo-17 is not very important. incontrast, knowledge of individual source redshifts improves the measurementsonly very little over the use of statistical source redshift distributions aslong as the source redshift distribution is known accurately.

astro-ph;0412615	weak lensing measurements of dark matter halos of galaxies from combo-17	we present a measurement of mass estimates for dark matter halos aroundgalaxies from the combo-17 survey using weak gravitational lensing. combo-17 isparticularly useful for this kind of investigation because it coversobservations in 17 optical filters from which accurate photometric redshiftsand spectral classification for objects with $r&lt;24$ are derived. this allows usto select lens and source galaxies from their redshifts and to thus avoid anyuncertainties from estimates of the source redshift distribution. we studygalaxy lenses at redshifts $z_\mathrm{d}=0.2-0.7$ by fitting the normalizationof either singular isothermal spheres (sis) or navarro-frenk-white (nfw)profiles to the whole lens sample; we then consider halos around blue and redsubsamples separately. we also constrain the scaling of halo mass with light.for the nfw model, we find virial masses$m_\mathrm{vir}^*=3.9^{+3.3}_{-2.4}\times 10^{11}h^{-1}m_{\sun}$ (1-$\sigma$)for blue and $m_\mathrm{vir}^*=7.1^{+7.1}_{-3.8}\times 10^{11}h^{-1}m_{\sun}$for red galaxies of $l_\star=10^{10}h^{-2}l_{\sun}$, respectively. the derivedmass-to-light scaling relations suggest that the mass-to-light ratio mightdecrease with increasing luminosity for blue galaxies but increase withincreasing luminosity for red galaxies. however, these differences between blueand red galaxies are only marginally significant and both subsamples areconsistent with having the same mass-to-light ratio at all luminosities.finally, we compare our results to those obtained from the red-sequence clustersurvey (rcs) and the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). taking differences in theactual modelling into account, we find very good agreement with these surveys.

astro-ph;0503019	cosmograil: the cosmological monitoring of gravitational lenses i. how  to sample the light curves of gravitationally lensed quasars to measure  accurate time delays	we use numerical simulations to test a broad range of plausible observationalstrategies designed to measure the time delay between the images ofgravitationally lensed quasars. artificial quasar light curves are createdalong with monte-carlo simulations in order to determine the best temporalsampling to adopt when monitoring the photometric variations of systems withtime delays between 5 and 120 days, i.e., always shorter than the visibilitywindow across the year. few and realistic assumptions are necessary on thequasar photometric variations (peak-to-peak amplitude and time-scale of thevariations) and on the accuracy of the individual photometric points. theoutput of the simulations is the (statistical) relative error made on the timedelay measurement, as a function of 1- the object visibility over the year, 2-the temporal sampling of the light curves and 3- the time delay. alsoinvestigated is the effect of long term microlensing variations which must bebelow the 5 % level (either intrinsically or by subtraction) if the goal is tomeasure time delays with an accuracy of 1-2 %. however, while microlensingincreases the random error on the time delay, it does not significantlyincrease the systematic error, which is always a factor 5 to 10 smaller thanthe random error. finally, it is shown that, when the time delay is comparableto the visibility window of the object, a logarithmic sampling cansignificantly improve the time delay determination. all results are presentedin the form of compact plots to be used to optimize the observational strategyof future monitoring programs.

astro-ph;0603421	the ols-lens survey: the discovery of five new galaxy-galaxy strong  lenses from the sdss	bright galaxy-galaxy strong lenses are much more powerful than lensed quasarsfor measuring the mass profiles of galaxies, but until this year only a handfulhave been known. here we present five new examples, identified via the optimalline-of-sight gravitational lens search strategy applied to luminous redgalaxies in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). our survey largely complementsa similar survey by bolton et al., who recently presented several new lenses.the lensed background galaxies are selected from the sdss spectra via thepresence of narrow emission line signatures, including the [oii] 3726,3729, hband [oiii] 4960,5008 lines, superposed on the spectra of the bright,intervening, deflector galaxies. our five confirmed new systems includedeflector galaxies with redshifts z=0.17-0.28 and lensed galaxies withredshifts z=0.47-1.18. simulations of moderately deep (few orbits) hst-acsimaging of systems such as these, where the lensed source is brighter thanr~23, are presented. these demonstrate the feasibility of measuring accuratelythe inner slope of the dark matter halo to within an uncertaintysigma(gamma)~0.1, the dark matter fraction within the einstein radius, and themass-to-light ratio of the stars alone, independently of dynamicalmeasurements. the high success rate of our search so far, &gt;60%, and therelatively modest observational resources necessary to confirm thegravitational lens nature of the candidates, demonstrate that compilation of asample of ~100 galaxy-galaxy lenses from the sdss is readily achievable,opening up a rich new field in dark matter studies.

astro-ph;0603608	the ukirt infrared deep sky survey early data release	this paper defines the ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss) early datarelease (edr). ukidss is a set of five large near-infra-red surveys defined bylawrence et al. (2006), being undertaken with the uk infra-red telescope(ukirt) wide field camera (wfcam). the programme began in may 2005 and has anexpected duration of seven years. each survey uses some or all of the broadbandfilter complement zyjhk. the edr is the first public release of data to theeuropean southern observatory (eso) community. all worldwide releases occurafter a delay of 18 months from the eso release. the edr provides a smallsample dataset, ~50 sq.deg (about 1% of the whole of ukidss), that is a lowerlimit to the expected quality of future survey data releases. in addition, anedr+ dataset contains all edr data plus extra data of similar quality, but forareas not observed in all of the required filters (amounting to ~220 sq.deg).the first large data release, dr1, will occur in mid-2006. we provide detailsof the observational implementation, the data reduction, the astrometric andphotometric calibration, and the quality control procedures. we summarise thedata coverage and quality (seeing, ellipticity, photometricity, depth) for eachsurvey and give a brief guide to accessing the images and catalogues from thewfcam science archive.

astro-ph;0604426	the ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss)	we describe the goals, design, implementation, and initial progress of theukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss), a seven year sky survey which began inmay 2005, using the ukirt wide field camera. it is a portfolio of five surveycomponents covering various combinations of the filter set zyjhk and h_2. thelarge area survey, the galactic clusters survey, and the galactic plane surveycover approximately 7000 square degrees to a depth of k~18; the deepextragalactic survey covers 35 square degrees to k~21, and the ultra deepsurvey covers 0.77 square degrees to k~23. summed together ukidss is 12 timeslarger in effective volume than the 2mass survey. the prime aim of ukidss is toprovide a long term astronomical legacy database; the design is however drivenby a series of specific goals -- for example to find the nearest and faintestsub-stellar objects; to discover population ii brown dwarfs, if they exist; todetermine the substellar mass function; to break the z=7 quasar barrier; todetermine the epoch of re-ionisation; to measure the growth of structure fromz=3 to the present day; to determine the epoch of spheroid formation; and tomap the milky way through the dust, to several kpc. the survey data are beinguniformly processed, and released in stages through the wfcam science archive(wsa : http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). before the formal survey began, ukirt andthe ukidss consortium collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of smallscience verification (sv) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera.we show some results from these sv projects in order to demonstrate the likelypower of the eventual complete survey. finally, using the data from the firstdata release we assess how well ukidss is meeting its design targets so far.

astro-ph;0609287	the evolution of the near-ir galaxy luminosity function and colour  bimodality up to z ~ 2 from the ukidss ultra deep survey early data release	we present new results on the cosmological evolution of the near-infraredgalaxy luminosity function, derived from the analysis of a new sample of\~22,000 k(ab) &lt; 22.5 galaxies selected over an area of 0.6 square degrees fromthe early data release of the ukidss ultra deep survey (uds). our study hasexploited the multi-wavelength coverage of the uds field provided by the newukidss wfcam k and j-band imaging, the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey and thespitzer-swire survey. the unique combination of large area and depth providedby this new survey minimises the complicating effect of cosmic variance and hasallowed us, for the first time, to trace the evolution of the brightest sourcesout to z~2 with good statistical accuracy.  in agreement with previous studies we find that the characteristic luminosityof the near-infrared luminosity function brightens by 1 magnitude between z=0and z~2, while the total density decreases by a factor ~2. using the rest-frame(u-b) colour to split the sample into red and blue galaxies, we confirm theclassic luminosity-dependent colour bimodality at z&lt;1. however, the strength ofthe colour bimodality is found to be a decreasing function of redshift, andseems to disappear by z&gt;1.5. due to the large size of our sample we are able toinvestigate the differing cosmological evolution of the red and blue galaxypopulations. it is found that the space density of the brightest red galaxies(m_k &lt; -23) stays approximately constant with redshift, and that these sourcesdominate the bright-end of the luminosity function at redshifts z&lt;1. incontrast, the brightening of the characteristic luminosity and mild decrease inspace density displayed by the blue galaxy population leads them to dominatethe bright-end of the luminosity function at redshifts z&gt;1.

astro-ph;0609579	a scuba/spitzer investigation of the far infra-red extragalactic  background	we have measured the contribution of submillimeter and mid-infrared sourcesto the extragalactic background radiation at 70 and 160um. specifically, wehave stacked flux in 70 and 160um spitzer space telescope (spitzer)observations of the canada-uk deep sub-millimeter survey 14h field at thepositions of 850um sources detected by scuba and also 8 and 24um sourcesdetected by spitzer. we find that per source, the scuba galaxies are thestrongest and the 8um sources the weakest contributors to the background fluxat both 70 and 160um. our estimate of the contribution of the scuba sources ishigher than previous estimates. however, expressed as a total contribution, thefull 8um source catalogue accounts for twice the total 24um source contributionand ~10 times the total scuba source contribution. the 8um sources account forthe majority of the background radiation at 160um with a flux of 0.87+/-0.16mjy/sr and at least a third at 70um with a flux of 0.103+/-0.019 mjy/sr. thesemeasurements are consistent with current lower limits on the background at 70and 160um. finally, we have investigated the 70 and 160um emission from the 8and 24um sources as a function of redshift. we find that the average 70um fluxper 24um source and the average 160um flux per 8 and 24um source is constantover all redshifts, up to z~4. in contrast, the low-redshift half (z&lt;1) of theof 8um sample contributes approximately four times the total 70um flux of thehigh-redshift half. these trends can be explained by a single non-evolving sed.

astro-ph;9801158	gravitational lens magnification and the mass of abell 1689	we present the first application of lens magnification to measure theabsolute mass of a galaxy cluster; abell 1689. the absolute mass of a galaxycluster can be measured by the gravitational lens magnification of a backgroundgalaxy population by the cluster potential. the lensing signal is complicatedby the variation in number counts due to galaxy clustering and shot-noise, andby additional uncertainties in relating magnification to mass in the stronglensing regime. clustering and shot-noise can be dealt with using maximumlikelihood methods. local approximations can then be used to estimate the massfrom magnification. alternatively if the lens is axially symmetric we show thatthe amplification equation can be solved nonlocally for the surface massdensity and the tangential shear. in this paper we present the first maps ofthe total mass distribution in abell 1689, measured from the deficit of lensedred galaxies behind the cluster. although noisier, these reproduce the mainfeatures of mass maps made using the shear distortion of background galaxiesbut have the correct normalisation, finally breaking the ``sheet-mass''degeneracy that has plagued lensing methods based on shear. we derive thecluster mass profile in the inner 4' (0.48 mpc/h). these show a profile with anear isothermal surface mass density \kappa = (0.5+/-0.1)(\theta/1')^{-1} outto a radius of 2.4' (0.28mpc/h), followed by a sudden drop into noise. we findthat the projected mass interior to 0.24 h^{-1}$mpc is m(&lt;0.24 mpc/h)=(0.50+/-0.09) \times 10^{15} msol/h. we compare our results with masses estimated fromx-ray temperatures and line-of-sight velocity dispersions, as well as weakshear and lensing arclets and find all are in fair agreement for abell 1698.
