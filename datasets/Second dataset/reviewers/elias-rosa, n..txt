0901.2075	sn 2005cs in m51 ii. complete evolution in the optical and the  near-infrared	we present the results of the one year long observational campaign of thetype ii-plateau sn 2005cs, which exploded in the nearby spiral galaxy m51 (thewhirlpool galaxy). this extensive dataset makes sn 2005cs the best observedlow-luminosity, 56ni-poor type ii-plateau event so far and one of the bestcore-collapse supernovae ever. the optical and near-infrared spectra shownarrow p-cygni lines characteristic of this sn family, which are indicative ofa very low expansion velocity (about 1000 km/s) of the ejected material. theoptical light curves cover both the plateau phase and the late-time radioactivetail, until about 380 days after core-collapse. numerous unfilteredobservations obtained by amateur astronomers give us the rare opportunity tomonitor the fast rise to maximum light, lasting about 2 days. in addition tooptical observations, we also present near-infrared light curves that (togetherwith already published uv observations) allow us to construct for the firsttime a reliable bolometric light curve for an object of this class. finally,comparing the observed data with those derived from a semi-analytic model, weinfer for sn 2005cs a 56ni mass of about 0.003 solar masses, a total ejectedmass of 8-13 solar masses and an explosion energy of about 3 x 10^50 erg.

0903.1286	sn 2008s: an electron capture sn from a super-agb progenitor?	we present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of thefaint transient sn 2008s discovered in ngc 6946. sn 2008s exhibited slowphotometric evolution and almost no spectral variability during the first ninemonths, implying a high density cs medium. the light curve is similar in shapeto that of sn 1998s and sn 1979c, although significantly fainter at maximumlight. our quasi-bolometric lightcurve extends to 300 days and shows a tailphase decay rate consistent with that of ^{56}co. we propose that this isevidence for an explosion and formation of ^{56}ni (0.0015 +/- 0.0004 m_sun).the large mir flux detected shortly after explosion can be explained by a lightecho from pre-exisiting dust. the late nir flux excess is plausibly due to acombination of warm newly-formed ejecta dust together with shock-heated dust inthe cs environment. we reassess the progenitor object detected previously inspitzer archive images, supplementing this discussion with a model of the mirspectral energy distribution. this supports the idea of a dusty, opticallythick shell around sn 2008s with an inner radius of nearly 90au and outerradius of 450au, and an inferred heating source of 3000 k and luminosity of l ~10^{4.6} l_sun. the combination of our monitoring data and the evidence fromthe progenitor analysis leads us to support the scenario of a weak electroncapture supernova explosion in a super-agb progenitor star (of initial mass 6-8m_sun) embedded within a thick cs gaseous envelope. we suggest that all of mainproperties of the electron capture sn phenomenon are observed in sn 2008s andfuture observations may allow a definitive answer.

0904.0119	evidence of asymmetry in sn 2007rt, a type iin supernova	an optical photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the slowly-evolving typeiin sn2007rt is presented, covering a duration of 481 days after discovery. itsearliest spectrum, taken approximately 100 days after the explosion epoch,indicates the presence of a dense circumstellar medium, with which thesupernova ejecta is interacting. this is supported by the slowly-evolving lightcurve. a notable feature in the spectrum of sn 2007rt is the presence of abroad he i 5875 line, not usually detected in type iin supernovae. this mayimply that the progenitor star has a high he/h ratio, having shed a significantportion of its hydrogen shell via mass-loss. an intermediate resolutionspectrum reveals a narrow halpha p-cygni profile, the absorption component ofwhich has a width of 128 km/s. this slow velocity suggests that the progenitorof sn 2007rt recently underwent mass-loss with wind speeds comparable to thelower limits of those detected in luminous blue variables. asymmetries in theline profiles of h and he at early phases bears some resemblance todouble-peaked features observed in a number of ib/c spectra. these asymmetriesmay be indicative of an asymmetric or bipolar outflow or alternatively dustformation in the fast expanding ejecta. in addition, the late time spectrum, atover 240 days post-explosion, shows clear evidence for the presence of newlyformed dust.

0704.1244	sn 2003du: 480 days in the life of a normal type ia supernova	an extensive set of optical and nir photometry and low-resolution spectra thetype ia supernova (sn ia) 2003du was obtained using a number of facilities. theobservations started 13 days before b-band maximum light and continued for 480days with exceptionally good time sampling. the optical photometry wascalibrated through the s-correction technique.  the ubvrijhk light curves and the color indices of sn 2003du closely resemblethose of normal sne ia. sn 2003du reached a b-band maximum of 13.49 (+/-0.02)mag on jd2452766.38 (+/-0.5). we derive a b-band stretch parameter of 0.988(+/-0.003), which corresponds to dm15=1.02 (+/-0.05), indicative of a sn ia ofstandard luminosity. the reddening in the host galaxy was estimated by threemethods, and was consistently found to be negligible. we estimate a distancemodulus of 32.79 (+/-0.15) mag to the host galaxy, ugc 9391. the peak uvoirbolometric luminosity of 1.35(+/-0.20) 10^43 erg/s and arnett's rule impliesthat m(ni56)=0.68 (+/-0.14)m_sun of ni56 was synthesized during the explosion.modeling of the uvoir bolometric light curve also indicates m(ni56) in therange 0.6-0.8 m_sun. the spectral evolution of sn 2003du at both optical andnir wavelengths also closely resembles normal sne ia. in particular, the si iiratio at maximum r(si ii)=0.22 (+/-0.02) and the time evolution of theblueshift velocities of the absorption line minima are typical. the pre-maximumspectra of sn 2003du showed conspicuous high-velocity features in the ca ii h&amp;kdoublet and infrared triplet, and possibly in si ii 6355, lines. we compare thetime evolution of the profiles of these lines with other well-observed sne iaand we suggest that the peculiar pre-maximum evolution of si ii 6355 line inmany sne ia is due to the presence of two blended absorption components.

0904.4632	nebular emission-line profiles of type ib/c supernovae - probing the  ejecta asphericity	in order to assess qualitatively the ejecta geometry of stripped-envelopecore-collapse supernovae, we investigate 98 late-time spectra of 39 objects,many of them previously unpublished. we perform a gauss-fitting of the [o i]6300, 6364 feature in all spectra, with the position, full width at halfmaximum (fwhm) and intensity of the 6300 gaussian as free parameters, and the6364 gaussian added appropriately to account for the doublet nature of the [oi] feature. on the basis of the best-fit parameters, the objects are organisedinto morphological classes, and we conclude that at least half of all type ib/csupernovae must be aspherical. bipolar jet-models do not seem to be universallyapplicable, as we find too few symmetric double-peaked [o i] profiles. in someobjects the [o i] line exhibits a variety of shifted secondary peaks orshoulders, interpreted as blobs of matter ejected at high velocity and possiblyaccompanied by neutron-star kicks to assure momentum conservation. at phasesearlier than ~200d, a systematic blueshift of the [o i] 6300, 6364 linecentroids can be discerned. residual opacity provides the most convincingexplanation of this phenomenon, photons emitted on the rear side of the snbeing scattered or absorbed on their way through the ejecta. once modified toaccount for the doublet nature of the oxygen feature, the profile of mg i] 4571at sufficiently late phases generally resembles that of [o i] 6300, 6364,suggesting negligible contamination from other lines and confirming that o andmg are similarly distributed within the ejecta.

0910.2275	on the progenitor of the type ii-plateau sn 2008cn in ngc 4603	through comparison of pre- and post-explosion images obtained with the widefield and planetary camera 2 onboard the hubble space telescope, we haveisolated a supergiant star prior to explosion at nearly the same position asthe high-luminosity sn ii-p 2008cn. we provide evidence that this supergiantmay well be the progenitor of the sn, although this identification is notentirely unambiguous due mainly to the distance to the host galaxy (ngc 4603),33.3 mpc. the progenitor candidate has a more yellow color than generally wouldbe expected and, if a single star, would require that it exploded during a"blue loop" evolutionary phase. nonetheless, we estimate an initial mass ofmini = 15 +/- 2 msun for this star, which is within the expected mass range forsn ii-p progenitors. the yellower color could also arise from the blend of twoor more stars, such as a red supergiant hidden by a brighter, blue supergiant;or a massive, interacting binary system. finally, if the yellow supergiant isnot the progenitor, or is not a stellar blend or binary containing theprogenitor, then we constrain any undetected progenitor star to be a redsupergiant with mini &lt; 11 msun, considering a physically more realisticscenario of explosion at the model endpoint luminosity for a rotating star.(abridged)

1006.0504	multiple major outbursts from a restless luminous blue variable in ngc  3432	we present new photometric and spectroscopic observations of an unusualluminous blue variable (lbv) in ngc 3432, covering three major outbursts inoctober 2008, april 2009 and november 2009. previously, this star experiencedan outburst also in 2000 (known as sn 2000ch). during outbursts the starreached an absolute magnitude between -12.1 and -12.8. its spectrum showed h,he i and fe ii lines with p-cygni profiles during and soon after the eruptivephases, while only intermediate-width lines in pure emission (including he ii4686a were visible during quiescence. the fast-evolving light curve soon afterthe outbursts, the quasi-modulated light curve, the peak magnitude and theoverall spectral properties are consistent with multiple episodes ofvariability of an extremely active lbv. however, the widths of the spectrallines indicate unusually high wind velocities (1500-2800 km/s), similar tothose observed in wolf-rayet stars. although modulated light curves are typicalof lbvs during the s-dor variability phase, the luminous maxima and the highfrequency of outbursts are unexpected in s-dor variables. such extremevariability may be associated with repeated ejection episodes during a gianteruption of an lbv. alternatively, it may be indicative of a high level ofinstability shortly preceding the core-collapse or due to interaction with amassive, binary companion. in this context, the variable in ngc 3432 sharessome similarities with the famous stellar system hd 5980 in the smallmagellanic cloud, which includes an erupting lbv and an early wolf-rayet star.

1006.5888	an asymmetric explosion as the origin of spectral evolution diversity in  type ia supernovae	type ia supernovae (sne ia) form an observationally uniform class of stellarexplosions, in that more luminous objects have smaller decline-rates. thisone-parameter behavior allows sne ia to be calibrated as cosmological `standardcandles', and led to the discovery of an accelerating universe. recentinvestigations, however, have revealed that the true nature of sne ia is morecomplicated. theoretically, it has been suggested that the initialthermonuclear sparks are ignited at an offset from the centre of thewhite-dwarf (wd) progenitor, possibly as a result of convection before theexplosion. observationally, the diversity seen in the spectral evolution of sneia beyond the luminosity decline-rate relation is an unresolved issue. here wereport that the spectral diversity is a consequence of random directions fromwhich an asymmetric explosion is viewed. our findings suggest that the spectralevolution diversity is no longer a concern in using sne ia as cosmologicalstandard candles. furthermore, this indicates that ignition at an offset fromthe centre of is a generic feature of sne ia.

1011.5665	high luminosity, slow ejecta and persistent carbon lines: sn 2009dc  challenges thermonuclear explosion scenarios	sn 2009dc shares similarities with normal type ia supernovae, but is clearlyoverluminous, with a (pseudo-bolometric) peak luminosity of log(l) = 43.47[erg/s]. its light curves decline slowly over half a year after maximum light,and the early-time near-ir light curves show secondary maxima, although theminima between the first and second peaks are not very pronounced. bluer bandsexhibit an enhanced fading after ~200 d, which might be caused by dustformation or an unexpectedly early ir catastrophe. the spectra of sn 2009dc aredominated by intermediate-mass elements and unburned material at early times,and by iron-group elements at late phases. strong c ii lines are present until~2 weeks past maximum, which is unprecedented in thermonuclear sne. the ejectavelocities are significantly lower than in normal and even subluminous sne ia.no signatures of csm interaction are found in the spectra. assuming that thelight curves are powered by radioactive decay, analytic modelling suggests thatsn 2009dc produced ~1.8 solar masses of 56ni assuming the smallest possiblerise time of 22 d. together with a derived total ejecta mass of ~2.8 solarmasses, this confirms that sn 2009dc is a member of the class of possiblesuper-chandrasekhar-mass sne ia similar to sne 2003fg, 2006gz and 2007if. astudy of the hosts of sn 2009dc and other superluminous sne ia reveals atendency of these sne to explode in low-mass galaxies. a low metallicity of theprogenitor may therefore be an important pre-requisite for producingsuperluminous sne ia. we discuss a number of explosion scenarios, ranging fromsuper-chandrasekhar-mass white-dwarf progenitors over dynamical white-dwarfmergers and type i 1/2 sne to a core-collapse origin of the explosion. none ofthe models seem capable of explaining all properties of sn 2009dc, so that thetrue nature of this sn and its peers remains nebulous.

1101.1824	the he-rich stripped-envelope core-collapse supernova 2008ax	extensive optical and near-infrared (nir) observations of the type iibsupernova 2008ax are presented, covering the first year after the explosion.the light curve is mostly similar in shape to that of the prototypical type iibsn 1993j, but shows a slightly faster decline rate at late phases and lacks theprominent narrow early-time peak of sn 1993j. from the bolometric light curveand ejecta expansion velocities, we estimate that about 0.07-0.15 solar massesof 56ni were produced during the explosion and that the total ejecta mass wasbetween 2 and 5 solar masses, with a kinetic energy of at least 10^51 erg. thespectral evolution of sn 2008ax is similar to that of the type ib sn 2007y,exhibiting high-velocity ca ii features at early phases and signs ofejecta-wind interaction from h-alpha observations at late times. nir spectrashow strong he i lines similar to the type ib sn 1999ex, and a large number ofemission features at late times. particularly interesting are the strong,double-peaked he i lines in late nir spectra, which - together withdouble-peaked [o i] emission in late optical spectra - provide clues forasymmetry and large-scale ni mixing in the ejecta.

1101.3935	effects of explosion asymmetry and viewing angle on the type ia  supernova color and luminosity calibration	phenomenological relations exist between the peak luminosity and otherobservables of type ia supernovae (sne~ia), that allow one to standardize theirpeak luminosities. however, several issues are yet to be clarified: sne~ia showcolor variations after the standardization. also, individual sne~ia can showresiduals in their standardized peak absolute magnitude at the level of $\sim0.15$ mag. in this paper, we explore how the color and luminosity residual arerelated to the wavelength shift of nebular emission lines observed at $\gsim150$ days after maximum light. a sample of 11 sne ia which likely suffer fromlittle host extinction indicates a correlation ($3.3\sigma$) between the peak$b-v$ color and the late-time emission-line shift. furthermore, a nearlyidentical relation applies for a larger sample in which only three sne with$b-v \gsim 0.2$ mag are excluded. following the interpretation that thelate-time emission-line shift is a tracer of the viewing direction from whichan off-centre explosion is observed, we suggest that the viewing direction is adominant factor controlling the sn color and that a large part of the colorvariations is intrinsic, rather than due to the host extinction. we alsoinvestigate a relation between the peak luminosity residuals and the wavelengthshift in nebular emission lines in a sample of 20 sne. we thereby found a hintof a correlation (at $\sim 1.6 \sigma$ level). the confirmation of this willrequire a future sample of sne with more accurate distance estimates. radiationtransfer simulations for a toy explosion model where different viewing anglescause the late-time emission-line shift are presented, predicting a strongcorrelation between the color and shift, and a weaker one for the luminosityresidual.

1210.1411	moderately luminous type ii supernovae	core-collapse supernovae (cc-sne) descend from progenitors more massive thanabout 8 msun. because of the young age of the progenitors, the ejecta mayeventually interact with the circumstellar medium (csm) via highly energeticprocesses detectable in the radio, x-ray, ultraviolet (uv) and, sometimes, inthe optical domains. in this paper we present ultraviolet, optical and nearinfrared observations of five type ii sne, namely sne 2009dd, 2007pk, 2010aj,1995ad, and 1996w. together with few other sne they form a group of moderatelyluminous type ii events. we collected photometry and spectroscopy with severaltelescopes in order to construct well-sampled light curves and spectralevolutions from the photospheric to the nebular phases. both photometry andspectroscopy indicate a degree of heterogeneity in this sample. the lightcurves have luminous peak magnitudes ($-16.95&lt;m_{b}&lt;-18.70$). the ejectedmasses of ^56\ni for three sne span a wide range of values($2.8\times10^{-2}$msun$&lt;$m(\ni)$&lt;1.4\times10^{-1}$msun), while for a fourth(sn2010aj) we could determine a stringent upper limit ($7\times10^{-3}$msun).clues of interaction, such as the presence of high velocity (hv) features ofthe balmer lines, are visible in the photospheric spectra of sne 2009dd and1996w. for sn2007pk we observe a spectral transition from a type iin to astandard type ii sn. modelling the observations of sne 2009dd, 2010aj and1995ad with radiation hydrodynamics codes, we infer kinetic plus thermalenergies of about 0.2-0.5 foe, initial radii of 2-5$\times10^{13}$ cm andejected masses of $\sim$5.0-9.5 msun. these values suggest moderate-mass,super-asymptotic giant branch (sagb) or red super-giants (rsg) stars as snprecursors, in analogy with other luminous type iip sne 2007od and 2009bw.

1302.3381	observation of sn2011fe with integral. i. pre--maximum phase	sn2011fe was detected by the palomar transient factory on august 24th 2011 inm101 a few hours after the explosion. from the early optical spectra it wasimmediately realized that it was a type ia supernova thus making this event thebrightest one discovered in the last twenty years. the distance of the eventoffered the rare opportunity to perform a detailed observation with theinstruments on board of integral to detect the gamma-ray emission expected fromthe decay chains of $^{56}$ni. the observations were performed in two runs, onebefore and around the optical maximum, aimed to detect the early emission fromthe decay of $^{56}$ni and another after this maximum aimed to detect theemission of $^{56}$co. the observations performed with the instruments on boardof integral (spi, ibis/isgri, jemx and omc) have been analyzed and comparedwith the existing models of gamma-ray emission from such kind of supernovae. inthis paper, the analysis of the gamma-ray emission has been restricted to thefirst epoch. both, spi and ibis/isgri, only provide upper-limits to theexpected emission due to the decay of $^{56}$ni. these upper-limits on thegamma-ray flux are of 7.1 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ ph/s/cm$^2$ for the 158 kev lineand of 2.3 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ ph/s/cm$^2$ for the 812 kev line. these boundsallow to reject at the $2\sigma$ level explosions involving a massive whitedwarf, $\sim 1$ m$\odot$ in the sub--chandrasekhar scenario and specificallyall models that would have substantial amounts of radioactive $^{56}$ni in theouter layers of the exploding star responsible of the sn2011fe event. theoptical light curve obtained with the omc camera also suggests that sn2011fewas the outcome of the explosion, possibly a delayed detonation although othermodels are possible, of a co white dwarf that synthesized $\sim 0.55$ m$_\odot$of $^{56}$ni. for this specific model.

1303.3803	hawk-i infrared supernova search in starburst galaxies	the use of sn rates to probe explosion scenarios and to trace the cosmic starformation history received a boost from a number of synoptic surveys. there hasbeen a recent claim of a mismatch by a factor of two between star formation andcore collapse sn rates, and different explanations have been proposed for thisdiscrepancy.} we attempted an independent test of the relation between starformation and supernova rates in the extreme environment of starburst galaxies,where both star formation and extinction are extremely high. to this aim weconducted an infrared supernova search in a sample of local starburts galaxies.the rational to search in the infrared is to reduce the bias due to extinction,which is one of the putative reasons for the observed discrepancy between starformation and supernova rates. to evaluate the outcome of the search wedeveloped a montecarlo simulation tool that is used to predict the number andproperties of the expected supernovae based on the search characteristics andthe current understanding of starburst galaxies and supernovae. during thesearch we discovered 6 supernovae (4 with spectroscopic classification) whichis in excellent agreement with the prediction of the montecarlo simulation toolthat is, on average, $5.3\pm2.3$ events. the number of supernovae detected instarburst galaxies is consistent with that predicted from their high starformation rate when we recognize that a major fraction ($\sim 60%$) of theevents remains hidden in the unaccessible, high density nuclear regions becauseof a combination of reduced search efficiency and high extinction.

1305.1851	optical and near-infrared observations of sn 2011dh - the first 100 days	we present optical and near-infrared (nir) photometry and spectroscopy of thetype iib supernova (sn) 2011dh for the first 100 days. we complement ourextensive dataset with swift ultra-violet (uv) and spitzer mid-infrared (mir)data to build a uv to mir bolometric lightcurve using both photometric andspectroscopic data. hydrodynamical modelling of the sn based on this bolometriclightcurve have been presented in bersten (2012). we find that the absorptionminimum for the hydrogen lines is never seen below ~11000 km/s but approachesthis value as the lines get weaker. this suggests that the interface betweenthe helium core and hydrogen rich envelope is located near this velocity inagreement with the bersten et al. (2012) he4r270 ejecta model. spectralmodelling of the hydrogen lines using this ejecta model supports the conclusionand we find a hydrogen mass of 0.01-0.04 solar masses to be consistent with theobserved spectral evolution. we estimate that the photosphere reaches thehelium core at 5-7 days whereas the helium lines appear between ~10 and ~15days, close to the photosphere and then move outward in velocity until ~40days. this suggests that increasing non-thermal excitation due to decreasingoptical depth for the gamma-rays is driving the early evolution of these lines.we also provide and discuss pre- and post-explosion observations of the sn sitewhich shows a reduction by 75 percent in flux at the position of the yellowsupergiant coincident with sn 2011dh. the b, v and r band decline rates of0.0073, 0.0090 and 0.0053 mag/day respectively are consistent with theremaining flux being emitted by the sn. hence we find that the star was indeedthe progenitor of sn 2011dh as previously suggested by maund et al. (2011) andwhich is also consistent with the results from the hydrodynamical modelling.

1310.4446	slowly fading super-luminous supernovae that are not pair-instability  explosions	super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second attheir peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies atredshifts of 0.1-4. some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'supernovae. such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times thatof the sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. in thesestars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted toelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclearexplosions. many solar masses of 56ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to56fe via 56co, powering bright light curves. such massive progenitors areexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early universe. recently,supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years afterthe big bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the sun was observed to looklike a fading pair-instability supernova. here we report observations of twoslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times andblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. theirlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call thenature of that event into question. our early spectra closely resemble typicalfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered byradioactivity. modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses ofmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosionmechanism. the lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests thattheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of thecore-collapse rate.

1311.6408	the nature of supernovae 2010o and 2010p in arp 299 - i. near-infrared  and optical evolution	we present near-infrared and optical photometry, plus optical spectroscopy oftwo stripped-envelope supernovae (sne) 2010o and 2010p that exploded in twodifferent components of an interacting luminous infrared galaxy arp 299 withinonly a few days of one another. sn 2010o is found to be photometrically andspectroscopically similar to many normal type ib sne and our multiwavelengthobservations of sn 2010p suggest it to be a type iib sn. no signs of clearhydrogen features or interaction with the circumstellar medium are evident inthe optical spectrum of sn 2010p. we derive estimates for the host galaxyline-of-sight extinctions for both sne, based on both light-curve andspectroscopic comparison finding consistent results. these methods are alsofound to provide much more robust estimates of the sn host galaxy reddeningthan the commonly used empirical relations between extinction and equivalentwidth of na i d absorption features. the sn observations also suggest thatdifferent extinction laws are present in different components of arp 299. forcompleteness, we study high-resolution pre-explosion images of arp 299 and findboth sne to be close to, but not coincident with, extended sources that arelikely massive clusters. a very simple model applied to the bolometric lightcurve of sn 2010o implies a rough estimate for the explosion parameters of$e_{\mathrm{k}} \approx 3 \times 10^{51}$ erg, $m_{\mathrm{ej}} \approx 2.9$m$_{\odot}$ and $m_{\mathrm{ni}} \approx 0.16$ m$_{\odot}$.

1405.1325	super-luminous supernovae from pessto	we present optical spectra and light curves for three hydrogen-poorsuper-luminous supernovae followed by the public eso spectroscopic survey oftransient objects (pessto). time series spectroscopy from a few days aftermaximum light to 100 days later shows them to be fairly typical of this class,with spectra dominated by ca ii, mg ii, fe ii and si ii, which evolve slowlyover most of the post-peak photospheric phase. we determine bolometric lightcurves and apply simple fitting tools, based on the diffusion of energy inputby magnetar spin-down, 56ni decay, and collision of the ejecta with an opaquecircumstellar shell. we investigate how the heterogeneous light curves of oursample (combined with others from the literature) can help to constrain thepossible mechanisms behind these events. we have followed these events tobeyond 100-200 days after peak, to disentangle host galaxy light from fadingsupernova flux and to differentiate between the models, which predict diversebehaviour at this phase. models powered by radioactivity require unrealisticparameters to reproduce the observed light curves, as found by previousstudies. both magnetar heating and circumstellar interaction still appear to beviable candidates. a large diversity is emerging in observed tail-phaseluminosities, with magnetar models failing in some cases to predict the rapiddrop in flux. this would suggest either that magnetars are not responsible, orthat the x-ray flux from the magnetar wind is not fully trapped. the lightcurve of one object shows a distinct re-brightening at around 100d aftermaximum light. we argue that this could result either from multiple shells ofcircumstellar material, or from a magnetar ionisation front breaking out of theejecta.

(2014) steady-state nlte models, and thepreferred 12 solar masses (initial mass) model shows a good overall agreementwith the observed lightcurves. we find an excess in the k and the mir bandsdeveloping between days 100 and 250, during which an increase in the opticaldecline rate is also observed. a local origin of the excess is suggested by thedepth of the hei 2.058 micron absorption. steady-state nlte models with amodest dust opacity in the core, turned on during this period, reproduce theobserved behaviour, but an additional excess in the spitzer 4.5 micron bandremains. co first-overtone band emission is detected at day 206, and possiblyat day 89, and assuming the additional excess to be dominated by co fundamentalband emission, we find fundamental to first-overtone band ratios considerablyhigher than observed in sn 1987a. this paper concludes our extensiveobservational and modelling work on sn 2011dh. the results from hydrodynamicalmodelling, steady-state nlte modelling, and stellar evolutionary progenitoranalysis are all consistent, and suggest an initial mass of 12 solar masses forthe progenitor.

1409.7728	the host galaxy and late-time evolution of the super-luminous supernova  ptf12dam	super-luminous supernovae of type ic have a tendency to occur in faint hostgalaxies which are likely to have low mass and low metallicity. ptf12dam is oneof the closest and best studied super-luminous explosions that has a broad andslowly fading lightcurve similar to sn 2007bi. here we present new photometryand spectroscopy for ptf12dam from 200-500 days (rest-frame) after peak and adetailed analysis of the host galaxy (sdss j142446.21+461348.6 at z = 0.107).using deep templates and image subtraction we show that the full lightcurve canbe fit with a magnetar model if escape of high-energy gamma rays is taken intoaccount. the full bolometric lightcurve from -53 to +399 days (with respect topeak) cannot be fit satisfactorily with the pair-instability models. analternative model of interaction with a dense csm produces a good fit to thedata although this requires a very large mass (~ 13 m_sun) of hydrogen freecsm. the host galaxy is a compact dwarf (physical size ~ 1.9 kpc) and with m_g= -19.33 +/- 0.10, it is the brightest nearby slsn ic host discovered so far.the host is a low mass system (2.8 x 10^8 m_sun) with a star-formation rate(5.0 m_sun/year), which implies a very high specific star-formation rate (17.9gyr^-1). the remarkably strong nebular lines provide detections of the [o iii]\lambda 4363 and [o ii] \lambda\lambda 7320,7330 auroral lines and an accurateoxygen abundance of 12 + log(o/h) = 8.05 +/- 0.09. we show here that they areat the extreme end of the metallicity distribution of dwarf galaxies andpropose that low metallicity is a requirement to produce these rare andpeculiar supernovae.

1504.02101	diversity in extinction laws of type ia supernovae measured between  $0.2$ and $2\,\mu\mathrm{m}$	we present ultraviolet (uv) observations of six nearby type~ia supernovae(sne~ia) obtained with the hubble space telescope, three of which were alsoobserved in the near-ir (nir) with wide-field camera~3. uv observations withthe swift satellite, as well as ground-based optical and near-infrared dataprovide complementary information. the combined data-set covers the wavelengthrange $0.2$--$2~\mu$m. by also including archival data of sn 2014j, we analysea sample spanning observed colour excesses up to $e(b-v)=1.4~$mag. we study thewavelength dependent extinction of each individual sn and find a diversity ofreddening laws when characterised by the total-to-selective extinction $r_v$.in particular, we note that for the two sne with $e(b-v)\gtrsim1~$mag, forwhich the colour excess is dominated by dust extinction, we find$r_v=1.4\pm0.1$ and $r_v=2.8\pm0.1$. adding uv photometry reduces theuncertainty of fitted $r_v$ by $\sim50\,$% allowing us to also measure $r_v$ ofindividual low-extinction objects which point to a similar diversity, currentlynot accounted for in the analyses when sne~ia are used for studying theexpansion history of the universe.

1504.02404	sn 2009ib: a type ii-p supernova with an unusually long plateau	we present optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of sn2009ib, a type ii-p supernova in ngc 1559. this object has moderate brightness,similar to those of the intermediate-luminosity sne 2008in and 2009n. itsplateau phase is unusually long, lasting for about 130 days after explosion.the spectra are similar to those of the subluminous sn 2002gd, with moderateexpansion velocities. we estimate the $^{56}$ni mass produced as $0.046 \pm0.015\,{\rm m}_{\sun}$. we determine the distance to sn 2009ib using both theexpanding photosphere method (epm) and the standard candle method. we alsoapply epm to sn 1986l, a type ii-p sn that exploded in the same galaxy.combining the results of different methods, we conclude the distance to ngc1559 as $d=19.8 \pm 3.0$ mpc. we examine archival, pre-explosion images of thefield taken with the hubble space telescope, and find a faint source at theposition of the sn, which has a yellow colour ($(v-i)_0 = 0.85$ mag). assumingit is a single star, we estimate its initial mass as $m_{\rm zams}=20\,{\rmm}_{\sun}$. we also examine the possibility, that instead of the yellow sourcethe progenitor of sn 2009ib is a red supergiant star too faint to be detected.in this case we estimate the upper limit for the initial zero-age main sequencemass of the progenitor to be $\sim 14-17\,{\rm m}_{\sun}$. in addition, weinfer the physical properties of the progenitor at the explosion viahydrodynamical modelling of the observables, and estimate the total energy as$\sim 0.55 \times 10^{51}$~erg, the pre-explosion radius as $\sim 400\,{\rmr}_{\sun}$, and the ejected envelope mass as $\sim 15\,{\rm m}_{\sun}$, whichimplies that the mass of the progenitor before explosion was $\sim16.5-17\,{\rm m}_{\sun}$.

1505.01078	lsq14bdq: a type ic super-luminous supernova with a double-peaked light  curve	we present data for lsq14bdq, a hydrogen-poor super-luminous supernova (slsn)discovered by the la silla quest survey and classified by the public esospectroscopic survey of transient objects. the spectrum and light curve arevery similar to slow-declining slsne such as ptf12dam. however, detectionswithin ~1 day after explosion show a bright and relatively fast initial peak,lasting for ~15 days, prior to the usual slow rise to maximum light. thebroader, main peak can be fit with either central engine or circumstellarinteraction models. we discuss the implications of the precursor peak in thecontext of these models. it is too bright and narrow to be explained as anormal 56ni-powered sn, and we suggest that interaction models may struggle tofit the two peaks simultaneously. we propose that the initial peak may arisefrom the post-shock cooling of extended stellar material, and reheating by acentral engine drives the second peak. in this picture, we show that anexplosion energy of ~2x10^{52} erg and a progenitor radius of a few hundredsolar radii would be required to power the early emission. the competing enginemodels involve rapidly spinning magnetars (neutron stars) or fall-backaccretion onto a central black hole. the prompt energy required may favour theblack hole scenario. the bright initial peak effectively rules out a compactwolf-rayet star as a progenitor, since the inferred energies and ejected massesbecome unphysical.

1505.01852	sn 2011a: an low-luminosity interacting transient, with a double plateau  and strong sodium absorption	we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the optical transient sn2011a. our data spans 140 days after discovery including $bvriu'g'r'i'z'$photometry and 11 epochs of optical spectroscopy. originally classified as atype iin supernova (sn iin) due to the presence of narrow h$\alpha$ emission,this object shows exceptional characteristics. firstly, the light curve shows adouble plateau; a property only observed before in the impostor sn 1997bs.secondly, sn 2011a has a very low luminosity ($m_{v}=-15.72$), placing itbetween normal luminous sne iin and sn impostors. thirdly, sn 2011a shows lowvelocity and high equivalent width absorption close to the sodium doublet,which increases with time and is most likely of circumstellar origin. thisevolution is also accompanied by a change of line profile; when the absorptionbecomes stronger, a p-cygni profile appears. we discuss sn 2011a in the contextof interacting sne iin and sn impostors, which appears to confirm theuniqueness of this transient. while we favour an impostor origin for sn 2011a,we highlight the difficulty in differentiating between terminal andnon-terminal interacting transients.

1509.03733	sn 2011fu: a type iib supernova with a luminous double-peaked light  curve	we present optical and near infrared observations of the type iib supernova(sn) 2011fu from a few days to $\sim300$ d after explosion. the sn presents adouble-peaked light curve (lc) similar to that of sn 1993j, although moreluminous and with a longer cooling phase after the primary peak. the spectralevolution is also similar to sn 1993j's, with hydrogen dominating the spectrato $\sim40$ d, then helium gaining strength, and nebular emission linesappearing from $\sim60$ d post-explosion. the velocities derived from thep-cygni absorptions are overall similar to those of other type iib sne. we havefound a strong similarity between the oxygen and magnesium line profiles atlate times, which suggests that these lines are forming at the same locationwithin the ejecta. the hydrodynamical modelling of the pseudo-bolometric lc andthe observed photospheric velocities suggest that sn 2011fu was the explosionof an extended star ($\rm r\sim450$ r$_\odot$), in which 1.3 $\times 10^{51}$erg of kinetic energy were released and 0.15 m$_{\rm \odot}$ of $^{56}$ni weresynthesised. in addition, a better reproduction of the observed earlypseudo-bolometric lc is achieved if a more massive h-rich-envelope than forother type iib sne is considered (0.3 m$_{\rm \odot}$). the hydrodynamicalmodelling of the lc and the comparison of our late-time spectra with nebularspectral models for type iib sne, point to a progenitor for sn 2011fu with azams mass of 13-18 m$_{\rm \odot}$.

1509.09062	massive stars exploding in a he-rich circumstellar medium - vii. the  metamorphosis of asassn-15ed from a narrow line type ibn to a normal type ib  supernova	we present the results of the spectroscopic and photometric monitoringcampaign of asassn-15ed. the transient was discovered quite young by the allsky automated survey for supernovae (asas-sn). amateur astronomers allowed usto sample the photometric sn evolution around maximum light, which we estimateto have occurred on jd = 2457087.4 +- 0.6 in the r-band. its apparent r-bandmagnitude at maximum was r = 16.91 +- 0.10, providing an absolute magnitudem(r) ~ -20.04 +- 0.20, which is slightly more luminous than the typicalmagnitudes estimated for type ibn sne. the post-peak evolution was wellmonitored, and the decline rate (being in most bands around 0.1 mag/d duringthe first 25 d after maximum) is marginally slower than the average declinerates of sne ibn during the same time interval. the object was initiallyclassified as a type ibn sn because early-time spectra were characterized by ablue continuum with superimposed narrow p-cygni lines of he i, suggesting thepresence of a slowly moving (1200-1500 km/s), he-rich circumstellar medium.later on, broad p-cygni he i lines became prominent. the inferred velocities,as measured from the minimum of the broad absorption components, were between6000 and 7000 km/s. as we attribute these broad features to the sn ejecta, thisis the first time we have observed the transition of a type ibn sn to a type ibsn.

astro-ph;0411059	the diversity of type ia supernovae: evidence for systematics?	the photometric and spectroscopic properties of 26 well observed type iasupernovae (sneia) were analyzed with the aim to explore snia diversity. thesample includes (branch-)normal sne as well as extreme events like sne 1991tand 1991bg, while the truly peculiar snia, sn2000cx and sn2002cx are notincluded in our sample . a statistical treatment reveals the existence of threedifferent groups. the first group (faint) consists of faint sneia similar tosn1991bg, with low expansion velocities and rapid evolution of siii velocity. asecond group consists of ``normal'' sneia, also with high temporal velocitygradient (hvg), but with brighter mean absolute magnitude &lt;m_b&gt;=-19.3 andhigher expansion velocities than the faint sne. the third group includes both``normal'' and sn1991t-like sneia: these sne populate a narrow strip in thesiii velocity evolution plot, with a small velocity gradient (svg), but haveabsolute magnitudes similar to hvgs. while the faint and hvg sneia togetherseem to define a relation between rsi(ii) and dm15(b), the svg ones either donot conform with that relation or define a new, looser one. the rsi(ii)pre-maximum evolution of hvgs is strikingly different from that of svgs. theimpact of this evidence on the understanding of snia diversity, in terms ofexplosion mechanisms, degree of ejecta mixing, and ejecta-csm interaction, isdiscussed.

astro-ph;0501163	photometric properties and origin of bulges in sb0 galaxies	we have derived the photometric parameters for the structural components of asample of fourteen sb0 galaxies by applying a parametric photometricdecomposition to their observed $i$-band surface brightness distribution.  we find that sb0 bulges are similar to bulges of the early-type unbarredspirals, i.e. they have nearly exponential surface brightness profiles($&lt;n&gt;=1.48\pm0.16$) and their effective radii are strongly coupled to the scalelengths of their surrounding discs ($&lt;r_e/h&gt;=0.20\pm0.01$). the photometricanalysis alone does not allow us to differentiate sb0 bulges from unbarred s0ones.  however, three sample bulges have disc properties typical of pseudobulges.the bulges of ngc 1308 and ngc 4340 rotate faster than bulges of unbarredgalaxies and models of isotropic oblate spheroids with equal ellipticity. thebulge of ic 874 has a velocity dispersion lower than expected from thefaber--jackson correlation and the fundamental plane of the elliptical galaxiesand s0 bulges. the remaining sample bulges are classical bulges, and arekinematically similar to lower-luminosity ellipticals. in particular, theyfollow the faber--jackson correlation, lie on the fundamental plane and thosefor which stellar kinematics are available rotate as fast as the bulges ofunbarred galaxies.

astro-ph;0502531	high-velocity features: a ubiquitous property of type ia sne	evidence of high-velocity features such as those seen in the near-maximumspectra of some type ia supernovae (eg sn 2000cx) has been searched for in theavailable snia spectra observed earlier than one week before b maximum. recentobservational efforts have doubled the number of sneia with very early spectra.remarkably, all sneia with early data (7 in our rtn sample and 10 from otherprogrammes) show signs of such features, to a greater or lesser degree, in caiiir, and some also in siii 6255a line. high-velocity features may be interpretedas abundance or density enhancements. abundance enhancements would imply anouter region dominated by si and ca. density enhancements may result from thesweeping up of circumstellar material by the highest velocity sn ejecta. inthis scenario, the high incidence of hvfs suggests that a thick disc and/or ahigh-density companion wind surrounds the exploding white dwarf, as may be thecase in single degenerate systems. large-scale angular fluctuations in theradial density and abundance distribution may also be responsible: this couldoriginate in the explosion, and would suggest a deflagration as the more likelyexplosion mechanism. csm-interaction and surface fluctuations may coexist,possibly leaving different signatures on the spectrum. in some sne the hvfs arenarrowly confined in velocity, suggesting the ejection of blobs of burnedmaterial.

astro-ph;0702565	esc and kait observations of the transitional type ia sn 2004eo	we present optical and infrared observations of the unusual type ia supernova(sn) 2004eo. the light curves and spectra closely resemble those of theprototypical sn 1992a, and the luminosity at maximum (m_b = -19.08) is close tothe average for a sn ia. however, the ejected 56ni mass derived by modellingthe bolometric light curve (about 0.45 solar masses) lies near the lower limitof the 56ni mass distribution observed in normal sne ia. accordingly, sn 2004eoshows a relatively rapid post-maximum decline in the light curve (delta m_(b) =1.46), small expansion velocities in the ejecta, and a depth ratio si ii 5972 /si ii 6355 similar to that of sn 1992a. the physical properties of sn 2004eocause it to fall very close to the boundary between the faint, low velocitygradient, and high velocity gradient subgroups proposed by benetti et al.(2005). similar behaviour is seen in a few other sne ia. thus, there may infact exist a few sne ia with intermediate physical properties.

astro-ph;0703663	a giant outburst two years before the core-collapse of a massive star	the death of massive stars produces a variety of supernovae, which are linkedto the structure of the exploding stars. the detection of several precursorstars of type ii supernovae have been reported, however we do not yet havedirect information on the progenitors of the hydrogen deficient type ib and icsupernovae. here we report that the peculiar type ib supernova sn2006jc isspatially coincident with a bright optical transient that occurred in 2004.spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of the supernova leads us to suggestthat the progenitor was a carbon-oxygen wolf-rayet star embedded within ahelium-rich circumstellar medium. there are different possible explanations forthis pre-explosion transient. it appears similar to the giant outbursts ofluminous blue variables (lbv) of 60-100 solar mass stars, however theprogenitor of sn2006jc was helium and hydrogen deficient. an lbv-like outburstof a wolf-rayet star could be invoked, but this would be the firstobservational evidence of such a phenomenon. alternatively a massive binarysystem composed of an lbv which erupted in 2004, and a wolf-rayet starexploding as sn2006jc, could explain the observations.

0810.0635	sn 2006gy: was it really extra-ordinary?	we present an optical photometric and spectroscopic study of the veryluminous type iin sn 2006gy for a time period spanning more than one year. inphotometry, a broad, bright (m_r~-21.7) peak characterizes all bvri lightcurves. afterwards, a rapid luminosity fading is followed by a phase of slowluminosity decline between day ~170 and ~237. at late phases (&gt;237 days),because of the large luminosity drop (&gt;3 mag), only upper visibility limits areobtained in the b, r and i bands. in the near-infrared, two k-band detectionson days 411 and 510 open new issues about dust formation or ir echoesscenarios. at all epochs the spectra are characterized by the absence of broadp-cygni profiles and a multicomponent halpha profile, which are the typicalsignatures of type iin sne. after maximum, spectroscopic and photometricsimilarities are found between sn 2006gy and bright, interaction-dominated sne(e.g. sn 1997cy, sn 1999e and sn 2002ic). this suggests that ejecta-csminteraction plays a key role in sn 2006gy about 6 to 8 months after maximum,sustaining the late-time-light curve. alternatively, the late luminosity may berelated to the radioactive decay of ~3m_sun of 56ni. models of the light curvein the first 170 days suggest that the progenitor was a compact star (r~6-810^(12)cm, m_ej~5-14m_sun), and that the sn ejecta collided with massive(6-10m_sun), opaque clumps of previously ejected material. these clumps do notcompletely obscure the sn photosphere, so that at its peak the luminosity isdue both to the decay of 56ni and to interaction with csm. a supermassive staris not required to explain the observational data, nor is an extra-ordinarilylarge explosion energy.
