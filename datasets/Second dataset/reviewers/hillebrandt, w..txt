0901.4254	turbulence in a three-dimensional deflagration model for type ia  supernovae: i. scaling properties	we analyze the statistical properties of the turbulent velocity field in thedeflagration model for type ia supernovae. in particular, we consider thequestion of whether turbulence is isotropic and consistent with the kolmogorovtheory at small length scales. using numerical data from a high-resolutionsimulation of a thermonuclear supernova explosion, spectra of the turbulenceenergy and velocity structure functions are computed. we show that theturbulent velocity field is isotropic at small length scales and follows ascaling law that is consistent with the kolmogorov theory until most of thenuclear fuel is burned. at length scales greater than a certain characteristicscale, turbulence becomes anisotropic. here, the radial velocity fluctuationsfollow the scaling law of the rayleigh-taylor instability, whereas the angularcomponent still obeys kolmogorov scaling. in the late phase of the explosion,this characteristic scale drops below the numerical resolution of thesimulation. the analysis confirms that a subgrid-scale model for the unresolvedturbulence energy is required for the consistent calculation of the flame speedin deflagration models of type ia supernovae, and that the assumption ofisotropy on these scales is appropriate.

0704.1244	sn 2003du: 480 days in the life of a normal type ia supernova	an extensive set of optical and nir photometry and low-resolution spectra thetype ia supernova (sn ia) 2003du was obtained using a number of facilities. theobservations started 13 days before b-band maximum light and continued for 480days with exceptionally good time sampling. the optical photometry wascalibrated through the s-correction technique.  the ubvrijhk light curves and the color indices of sn 2003du closely resemblethose of normal sne ia. sn 2003du reached a b-band maximum of 13.49 (+/-0.02)mag on jd2452766.38 (+/-0.5). we derive a b-band stretch parameter of 0.988(+/-0.003), which corresponds to dm15=1.02 (+/-0.05), indicative of a sn ia ofstandard luminosity. the reddening in the host galaxy was estimated by threemethods, and was consistently found to be negligible. we estimate a distancemodulus of 32.79 (+/-0.15) mag to the host galaxy, ugc 9391. the peak uvoirbolometric luminosity of 1.35(+/-0.20) 10^43 erg/s and arnett's rule impliesthat m(ni56)=0.68 (+/-0.14)m_sun of ni56 was synthesized during the explosion.modeling of the uvoir bolometric light curve also indicates m(ni56) in therange 0.6-0.8 m_sun. the spectral evolution of sn 2003du at both optical andnir wavelengths also closely resembles normal sne ia. in particular, the si iiratio at maximum r(si ii)=0.22 (+/-0.02) and the time evolution of theblueshift velocities of the absorption line minima are typical. the pre-maximumspectra of sn 2003du showed conspicuous high-velocity features in the ca ii h&amp;kdoublet and infrared triplet, and possibly in si ii 6355, lines. we compare thetime evolution of the profiles of these lines with other well-observed sne iaand we suggest that the peculiar pre-maximum evolution of si ii 6355 line inmany sne ia is due to the presence of two blended absorption components.

0904.4632	nebular emission-line profiles of type ib/c supernovae - probing the  ejecta asphericity	in order to assess qualitatively the ejecta geometry of stripped-envelopecore-collapse supernovae, we investigate 98 late-time spectra of 39 objects,many of them previously unpublished. we perform a gauss-fitting of the [o i]6300, 6364 feature in all spectra, with the position, full width at halfmaximum (fwhm) and intensity of the 6300 gaussian as free parameters, and the6364 gaussian added appropriately to account for the doublet nature of the [oi] feature. on the basis of the best-fit parameters, the objects are organisedinto morphological classes, and we conclude that at least half of all type ib/csupernovae must be aspherical. bipolar jet-models do not seem to be universallyapplicable, as we find too few symmetric double-peaked [o i] profiles. in someobjects the [o i] line exhibits a variety of shifted secondary peaks orshoulders, interpreted as blobs of matter ejected at high velocity and possiblyaccompanied by neutron-star kicks to assure momentum conservation. at phasesearlier than ~200d, a systematic blueshift of the [o i] 6300, 6364 linecentroids can be discerned. residual opacity provides the most convincingexplanation of this phenomenon, photons emitted on the rear side of the snbeing scattered or absorbed on their way through the ejecta. once modified toaccount for the doublet nature of the oxygen feature, the profile of mg i] 4571at sufficiently late phases generally resembles that of [o i] 6300, 6364,suggesting negligible contamination from other lines and confirming that o andmg are similarly distributed within the ejecta.

0707.1024	a three-dimensional deflagration model for type ia supernovae confronted  with observations	a simulation of the thermonuclear explosion of a chandrasekhar-mass c+o whitedwarf, the most popular scenario of a type ia supernova (sn ia), is presented.the underlying modeling is pursued in a self-consistent way, treating thecombustion wave as a turbulent deflagration using well tested methods developedfor laboratory combustion and based on the concept of `large eddy simulations'(les). such consistency requires to capture the onset of the turbulent cascadeon resolved scales. this is achieved by computing the dynamical evolution on a1024$^3$ moving grid, which resulted in the best-resolved three-dimensional snia simulation carried out thus far, reaching the limits of what can be done onpresent supercomputers. consequently, the model has no free parameters otherthan the initial conditions at the onset of the explosion, and therefore it hasconsiderable predictive power. our main objective is to determine to whichextent such a simulation can account for the observations of normal sne ia.guided by previous simulations with less resolution and a less sophisticatedflame model, initial conditions were chosen that yield a reasonably strongexplosion and a sufficient amount of radioactive nickel for a bright display.we show that observables are indeed matched to a reasonable degree. inparticular, good agreement is found with the light curves of normal sne ia.moreover, the model reproduces the general features of the abundancestratification as inferred from the analysis of spectra. this indicates that itcaptures the main features of the explosion mechanism of sne ia. however, wealso show that even a seemingly best-choice pure deflagration model hasshortcomings that indicate the need for a different mode of nuclear burning atlate times, perhaps the transition to a detonation at low density.

0911.4345	turbulence in a 3d deflagration model for type ia sne: ii. intermittency  and the deflagration-to-detonation transition probability	the delayed detonation model describes the observational properties of themajority of type ia supernovae very well. using numerical data from athree-dimensional deflagration model for type ia supernovae, the intermittencyof the turbulent velocity field and its implications on the probability of adeflagration-to-detonation (ddt) transition are investigated. from structurefunctions of the turbulent velocity fluctuations, we determine intermittencyparameters based on the log-normal and the log-poisson models. on the otherhand, the analysis of the turbulent velocity fluctuations in the vicinity ofthe flame front by roepke suggests a much higher probability of large velocityfluctuations on the grid scale in comparison to the log-normal intermittencymodel. following pan et al., we computed probability density functions for addt for the different distributions. assuming that a ddt can occur in thestirred flame regime, as proposed by woosley et al., the log-normal model wouldimply a delayed detonation between 0.7 and 0.8 seconds after the beginning ofthe deflagration phase for the multi-spot ignition scenario used in thesimulation. however, the probability drops to virtually zero if a ddt isfurther constrained by the requirement that the turbulent velocity fluctuationsreach about 500 km/s. under this condition, delayed detonations are onlypossible if the distribution of the velocity fluctuations is not log-normal.  from our calculations follows that the distribution obtained by roepke allowfor multiple ddts around 0.8 seconds after ignition at a transition densityclose to 1x10^7 g/cm^3.

1002.2153	nucleosynthesis in two-dimensional delayed detonation models of type ia  supernova explosions	the nucleosynthetic characteristics of various explosion mechanisms of typeia supernovae (sne ia) is explored based on three two-dimensional explosionsimulations representing extreme cases: a pure turbulent deflagration, adelayed detonation following an approximately spherical ignition of the initialdeflagration, and a delayed detonation arising from a highly asymmetricdeflagration ignition. apart from this initial condition, the deflagrationstage is treated in a parameter-free approach. the detonation is initiated whenthe turbulent burning enters the distributed burning regime. this occurs atdensities around $10^{7}$ g cm$^{-3}$ -- relatively low as compared to existingnucleosynthesis studies for one-dimensional spherically symmetric models. theburning in these multidimensional models is different from that inone-dimensional simulations as the detonation wave propagates both intounburned material in the high density region near the center of a white dwarfand into the low density region near the surface. thus, the resulting yield isa mixture of different explosive burning products, from carbon-burning productsat low densities to complete silicon-burning products at the highest densities,as well as electron-capture products synthesized at the deflagration stage. incontrast to the deflagration model, the delayed detonations produce acharacteristic layered structure and the yields largely satisfy constraintsfrom galactic chemical evolution. in the asymmetric delayed detonation model,the region filled with electron capture species (e.g., $^{58}$ni, $^{54}$fe) iswithin a shell, showing a large off-set, above the bulk of $^{56}$nidistribution, while species produced by the detonation are distributed morespherically (abridged).

1002.2173	double-detonation sub-chandrasekhar supernovae: can minimum helium shell  masses detonate the core?	the explosion of sub-chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs via the doubledetonation scenario is a potential explanation for type ia supernovae. in thisscenario, a surface detonation in a helium layer initiates a detonation in theunderlying carbon/oxygen core leading to an explosion. for a given core mass, alower bound has been determined on the mass of the helium shell required fordynamical burning during a helium flash, which is a necessary prerequisite fordetonation. for a range of core and corresponding minimum helium shell masses,we investigate whether an assumed surface helium detonation is capable oftriggering a subsequent detonation in the core even for this limiting case. wecarried out hydrodynamic simulations on a co-expanding eulerian grid in twodimensions assuming rotational symmetry. the detonations are propagated usingthe level-set approach and a simplified scheme for nuclear reactions that hasbeen calibrated with a large nuclear network. the same network is used todetermine detailed nucleosynthetic abundances in a post-processing step. basedon approximate detonation initiation criteria in the literature, we find thatsecondary core detonations are triggered for all of the simulated models,ranging in core mass from 0.810 up to 1.385 m_solar with corresponding shellmasses from 0.126 down to 0.0035 m_solar. this implies that, as soon as adetonation triggers in a helium shell covering a carbon/oxygen white dwarf, asubsequent core detonation is virtually inevitable.

1003.2917	detonations in sub-chandrasekhar mass c+o white dwarfs	explosions of sub-chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs are one alternative to thestandard chandrasekhar-mass model of type ia supernovae. they are interestingsince binary systems with sub-chandrasekhar-mass primary white dwarfs should becommon and this scenario would suggest a simple physical parameter whichdetermines the explosion brightness, namely the mass of the exploding whitedwarf. here we perform one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, associatedpost-processing nucleosynthesis and multi-wavelength radiation transportcalculations for pure detonations of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. the lightcurves and spectra we obtain from these simulations are in good agreement withobserved properties of type ia supernovae. in particular, for white dwarfmasses from 0.97 - 1.15 msun we obtain 56ni masses between 0.3 and 0.8 msun,sufficient to capture almost the complete range of type ia supernovabrightnesses. our optical light curve rise times, peak colours and declinetimescales display trends which are generally consistent with observedcharacteristics although the range of b-band decline timescales displayed byour current set of models is somewhat too narrow. in agreement withobservations, the maximum light spectra of the models show clear featuresassociated with intermediate mass elements and reproduce the sense of theobserved correlation between explosion luminosity and the ratio of the si iilines at 6355 and 5972 angstroms. we therefore suggest that sub-chandrasekharmass explosions are a viable model for type ia supernovae for any binaryevolution scenario leading to explosions in which the optical display isdominated by the material produced in a detonation of the primary white dwarf.

1006.4489	double-detonation sub-chandrasekhar supernovae: synthetic observables  for minimum helium shell mass models	abridged. in the double detonation scenario for type ia supernovae (sne ia) adetonation initiates in a shell of he-rich material accreted from a companionstar by a sub-chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (wd). this shell detonation drivesa shock front into the carbon-oxygen (c/o) wd that triggers a secondarydetonation in the core. the core detonation results in a complete disruption ofthe wd. earlier studies concluded that this scenario has difficulties inaccounting for the observed properties of sne ia since the explosion ejecta aresurrounded by the products of explosive he burning in the shell. recently, itwas proposed that detonations might be possible for much less massive he shellsthan previously assumed. moreover, it was shown that even detonations of theseminimum he shell masses robustly trigger detonations of the c/o core. here wepresent time-dependent multi-wavelength radiative transfer calculations formodels with minimum he shell mass and derive synthetic observables for both theoptical and {\gamma}-ray spectral regions. these differ strongly from thosefound in earlier simulations of sub-chandrasekhar-mass explosions in which moremassive he shells were considered. our models predict light curves which coverboth the range of brightnesses and the rise and decline times of observed sneia. however, their colours and spectra do not match the observations. inparticular, their b-v colours are generally too red. we show that thisdiscrepancy is mainly due to the composition of the burning products of the heshell of our models which contain significant amounts of ti and cr. using a toymodel, we also show that the burning products of the he shell depend cruciallyon its initial composition. this leads us to conclude that good agreementbetween sub-chandrasekhar-mass explosions and observed sne ia may still befeasible but further study of the shell properties is required.

1009.3661	type ia supernovae and accretion induced collapse	using the population synthesis binary evolution code startrack, we presenttheoretical rates and delay times of type ia supernovae arising from variousformation channels. these channels include binaries in which the explodingwhite dwarf reaches the chandrasekhar mass limit (dds, sds, and helium-richdonor scenario) as well as the sub-chandrasekhar mass scenario, in which awhite dwarf accretes from a helium-rich companion and explodes as a sn iabefore reaching the chandrasekhar mass limit. we find that using a commonenvelope parameterization employing energy balance with alpha=1 and lambda=1,the supernova rates per unit mass (born in stars) of sub-chandrasekhar mass sneia exceed those of all other progenitor channels at epochs t=0.7 - 4 gyr for aburst of star formation at t=0. additionally, the delay time distribution ofthe sub-chandrasekhar model can be divided in to two distinct evolutionarychannels: the `prompt' helium-star channel with delay times &lt; 500 myr, and the`delayed' double white dwarf channel with delay times &gt; 800 myr spanning up toa hubble time. these findings are in agreement with recentobservationally-derived delay time distributions which predict that a largenumber of sne ia have delay times &lt; 1 gyr, with a significant fraction havingdelay times &lt; 500 myr. we find that the dds channel is also able to account forthe observed rates of sne ia. however, detailed simulations of white dwarfmergers have shown that most of these mergers will not lead to sne ia butrather to the formation of a neutron star via accretion-induced collapse. ifthis is true, our standard population synthesis model predicts that the onlyprogenitor channel which can account for the rates of sne ia is thesub-chandrasekhar mass scenario, and none of the other progenitors consideredcan fully account for the observed rates.

1105.3049	nero - a post maximum supernova radiation transport code	the interpretation of supernova (sn) spectra is essential for deriving snejecta properties such as density and composition, which in turn can tell usabout their progenitors and the explosion mechanism. a very large number ofatomic processes are important for spectrum formation. several tools forcalculating sn spectra exist, but they mainly focus on the very early or lateepochs. the intermediate phase, which requires a nlte treatment of radiationtransport has rarely been studied. in this paper we present a new sn radiationtransport code, nero, which can look at those epochs. all the atomic processesare treated in full nlte, under a steady-state assumption. this is a validapproach between roughly 50 and 500 days after the explosion depending on sntype. this covers the post-maximum photospheric and the early and theintermediate nebular phase. as a test, we compare nero to the radiationtransport code of jerkstrand et al. (2011) and to the nebular code of mazzaliet al. (2001). all three codes have been developed independently and acomparison provides a valuable opportunity to investigate their reliability.currently, nero is one-dimensional and can be used for predicting spectra ofsynthetic explosion models or for deriving sn properties by spectral modelling.to demonstrate this, we study the spectra of the 'normal' sn ia 2005cf between50 and 350 days after the explosion and identify most of the common sn ia linefeatures at post maximum epochs.

1111.2117	2d simulations of the double-detonation model for thermonuclear  transients from low-mass carbon-oxygen white dwarfs	thermonuclear explosions may arise in binaries in which a co white dwarf (wd)accretes he from a companion. if the accretion rate allows a sufficiently largemass of he to accumulate prior to ignition of nuclear burning, the he surfacelayer may detonate, giving rise to an astrophysical transient. detonation ofthe he layer generates shock waves that propagate into the underlying co wd.this might directly ignite a detonation at the edge of the co wd or compressthe core of the wd sufficiently to trigger a co detonation near the centre. ifeither ignition mechanism works, the two detonations can release sufficientenergy to completely unbind the wd. here we extend our 2d studies of thisdouble-detonation model to low-mass co wds. we investigate the feasibility oftriggering a secondary core detonation by shock convergence in low-mass co wdsand the observable consequences of such a detonation. our results suggest thatcore detonation is probable, even for the lowest co core masses realized innature. we compute spectra and light curves for models in which either anedge-lit or compression-triggered co detonation is assumed to occur and comparethese to models in which no co detonation was allowed to occur. if significantshock compression of the co wd occurs prior to detonation, explosion of the cowd can produce a sufficiently large mass of radioactive iron-group nuclei toaffect the light curves. in particular, this can lead to relatively slowpost-maximum decline. if the secondary detonation is edge-lit, however, the cowd explosion primarily yields intermediate-mass elements that affect theobservables more subtly. in this case, nir observations and detailedspectroscopic analysis would be needed to determine whether core detonationoccurred. we comment on the implications of our results for understandingpeculiar astrophysical transients including sn 2002bj, sn 2010x and sn 2005e.

1203.4839	constraining type ia supernova models: sn 2011fe as a test case	the nearby supernova sn 2011fe can be observed in unprecedented detail.therefore, it is an important test case for type ia supernova (sn ia) models,which may bring us closer to understanding the physical nature of theseobjects. here, we explore how available and expected future observations of sn2011fe can be used to constrain sn ia explosion scenarios. we base ourdiscussion on three-dimensional simulations of a delayed detonation in achandrasekhar-mass white dwarf and of a violent merger of two whitedwarfs-realizations of explosion models appropriate for two of the mostwidely-discussed progenitor channels that may give rise to sne ia. althoughboth models have their shortcomings in reproducing details of the early andnear-maximum spectra of sn 2011fe obtained by the nearby supernova factory(snfactory), the overall match with the observations is reasonable. the levelof agreement is slightly better for the merger, in particular around maximum,but a clear preference for one model over the other is still not justified.observations at late epochs, however, hold promise for discriminating theexplosion scenarios in a straightforward way, as a nucleosynthesis effect leadsto differences in the 55co production. sn 2011fe is close enough to be followedsufficiently long to study this effect.

1205.5806	stellar gadget: a smooth particle hydrodynamics code for stellar  astrophysics and its application to type ia supernovae from white dwarf  mergers	mergers of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs have long been suspected to beprogenitors of type ia supernovae. here we present our modifications to thecosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics code gadget to apply it to stellarphysics including but not limited to mergers of white dwarfs. we demonstrate anew method to map a one-dimensional profile of an object in hydrostaticequilibrium to a stable particle distribution. we use the code to study theeffect of initial conditions and resolution on the properties of the merger oftwo white dwarfs. we compare mergers with approximate and exact binary initialconditions and find that exact binary initial conditions lead to a much morestable binary system but there is no difference in the properties of the actualmerger. in contrast, we find that resolution is a critical issue forsimulations of white dwarf mergers. carbon burning hotspots which may lead to adetonation in the so-called violent merger scenario emerge only in simulationswith sufficient resolution but independent of the type of binary initialconditions. we conclude that simulations of white dwarf mergers which attemptto investigate their potential for type ia supernovae should be carried outwith at least 10^6 particles.

1206.6263	monte carlo radiation hydrodynamics: methods, tests and application to  supernova type ia ejecta	in astrophysical systems, radiation-matter interactions are important intransferring energy and momentum between the radiation field and thesurrounding material. this coupling often makes it necessary to consider therole of radiation when modelling the dynamics of astrophysical fluids. duringthe last few years, there have been rapid developments in the use of montecarlo methods for numerical radiative transfer simulations. here, we present anapproach to radiation hydrodynamics that is based on coupling monte carloradiative transfer techniques with finite-volume hydrodynamical methods in anoperator-split manner. in particular, we adopt an indivisible packet formalismto discretize the radiation field into an ensemble of monte carlo packets andemploy volume-based estimators to reconstruct the radiation fieldcharacteristics. in this paper the numerical tools of this method are presentedand their accuracy is verified in a series of test calculations. finally, as apractical example, we use our approach to study the influence of theradiation-matter coupling on the homologous expansion phase and the bolometriclight curve of type ia supernova explosions.

1208.2094	prospect of studying hard x- and gamma-rays from type ia supernovae	we perform multi-dimensional, time-dependent radiation transfer simulationsfor hard x-ray and gamma-ray emissions, following radioactive decays of 56niand 56co, for two-dimensional delayed detonation models of type ia supernovae(sne ia). the synthetic spectra and light curves are compared with thesensitivities of current and future observatories for an exposure time of 10^6seconds. the non-detection of the gamma-ray signal from sn 2011fe at 6.4 mpc byspi on board integral places an upper limit for the mass of 56ni of \lesssim1.0 msun, independently from observations in any other wavelengths. signalsfrom the newly formed radioactive species have not been convincingly measuredyet from any sn ia, but the future x-ray and gamma-ray missions are expected todeepen the observable horizon to provide the high energy emission data for asignificant sn ia sample. we predict that the hard x-ray detectors on boardnustar (launched in 2012) or astro-h (scheduled for launch in 2014) will reachto sne ia at \sim15 mpc, i.e., one sn every few years. furthermore, accordingto the present results, the soft gamma-ray detector on board astro-h will beable to detect the 158 kev line emission up to \sim25 mpc, i.e., a few sne iaper year. proposed next generation gamma-ray missions, e.g., grips, could reachto sne ia at \sim20 - 35 mpc by mev observations. those would provide newdiagnostics and strong constraints on explosion models, detecting ratherdirectly the main energy source of supernova light.

1208.5949	interpreting the near-infrared spectra of the 'golden standard' type ia  supernova 2005cf	we present nine near-infrared (nir) spectra of supernova (sn) 2005cf atepochs from -10 d to +42 d with respect to b-band maximum, complementing theexisting excellent data sets available for this prototypical type ia sn atother wavelengths. the spectra show a time evolution and spectral featurescharacteristic of normal type ia sne, as illustrated by a comparison with sne1999ee, 2002bo and 2003du. the broad-band spectral energy distribution (sed) ofsn 2005cf is studied in combined ultraviolet (uv), optical and nir spectra atfive epochs between ~ 8 d before and ~ 10 d after maximum light. we alsopresent synthetic spectra of the hydrodynamic explosion model w7, whichreproduce the key properties of sn 2005cf not only at uv-optical as previouslyreported, but also at nir wavelengths. from the radiative-transfer calculationswe infer that fluorescence is the driving mechanism that shapes the sed of sneia. in particular, the nir part of the spectrum is almost devoid of absorptionfeatures, and instead dominated by fluorescent emission of both iron-groupmaterial and intermediate-mass elements at pre-maximum epochs, and pureiron-group material after maximum light. a single p-cygni feature of mg ii atearly epochs and a series of relatively unblended co ii lines at late phasesallow us to constrain the regions of the ejecta in which the respectiveelements are abundant.

1209.0645	on the brightness distribution of type ia supernovae from violent white  dwarf mergers	we investigate the brightness distribution expected for thermonuclearexplosions that might result from the ignition of a detonation during theviolent merger of white dwarf (wd) binaries. determining their brightnessdistribution is critical for evaluating whether such an explosion model couldbe responsible for a significant fraction of the observed population of sne ia.we argue that the brightness of an explosion realized via the violent mergermodel is determined by the mass of nickel 56 produced in the detonation of theprimary wd. we use a set of sub-chandrasekhar mass wd detonation models toderive a relationship between primary wd mass and expected peak bolometricbrightness. we use this relationship to convert the masses of merging primarywds from binary population models to a predicted distribution of explosionbrightness. we find a striking similarity between the shape of our theoreticalpeak-magnitude distribution and that observed for sne ia: our model produces abrightness distribution that roughly covers the range and matches the shape ofthe one observed for sne ia. however, this agreement hinges on a particularphase of mass accretion during binary evolution: the primary wd gains~0.15-0.35 msun from a slightly-evolved helium star companion. we also findthat with high probability, violent wd mergers involving the most massiveprimaries (which should produce bright sne) have delay times &lt;500 myr(abridged).

1209.4458	three-dimensional simulations of the interaction between type ia  supernova ejecta and their main sequence companions	the identity of the progenitor systems of sne ia is still uncertain. in thesingle-degenerate (sd) scenario, the interaction between the sn blast wave andthe outer layers of a main sequence (ms) companion star strips off h-richmaterial which is then mixed into the ejecta. strong contamination of the snejecta with stripped material could lead to a conflict with observations of sneia. this constrains the sd progenitor model. in this work, our previoussimulations based on simplified progenitor donor stars have been updated byadopting more realistic progenitor-system models that result from fullydetailed, state-of-the-art binary evolution calculations. we use eggleton'sstellar evolution code including the optically thick accretion wind model andthe possibility of the effects of accretion disk instabilities to obtainrealistic models of companions for different progenitor systems. the impact ofthe sn blast wave on these companion stars is followed in three-dimensionalhydrodynamic simulations employing the sph code gadget3. we find that thestripped masses range from 0.11 to 0.18 m_sun. the kick velocity is between 51and 105 km/s. we find that the stripped mass and kick velocity depend on theratio of the orbital separation to the radius of a companion. they can befitted by a power law for a given companion model. however, the structure ofthe companion star is also important for the amount of stripped material. withmore realistic companion star models than in previous studies, our simulationsshow that the h masses stripped from companions are inconsistent with the bestobservational limits (&lt; 0.01 m_sun) derived from nebular spectra. however, arigorous forward modeling based on impact simulations with radiation transferis required to reliably predict observable signatures of the stripped h and toconclusively assess the viability of the considered sn ia progenitor scenario.

1210.5243	3d deflagration simulations leaving bound remnants: a model for  2002cx-like type ia supernovae	2002cx-like supernovae are a sub-class of sub-luminous type ia supernovae.their light curves and spectra are characterized by distinct features thatindicate strong mixing of the explosion ejecta. pure turbulent deflagrationshave been shown to produce such mixed ejecta. here, we present hydrodynamics,nucleosynthesis and radiative transfer calculations for a 3d full-stardeflagration of a chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf. our model is able toreproduce the characteristic observational features of sn 2005hk (aproto-typical 2002cx-like supernova), not only in the optical, but also in thenear-infrared. for that purpose we present, for the first time, fivenear-infrared spectra of sn 2005hk from -0.2 to 26.6 days with respect tob-band maximum. since our model burns only small parts of the initial whitedwarf, it fails to completely unbind the white dwarf and leaves behind a boundremnant of ~1.03 solar masses -- consisting mainly of unburned carbon andoxygen, but also enriched by some amount of intermediate-mass and iron-groupelements from the explosion products that fall back on the remnant. we discusspossibilities for detecting this bound remnant and how it might influence thelate-time observables of 2002cx-like sne.

1302.1292	spectrophotometric time series of sn 2011fe from the nearby supernova  factory	we present 32 epochs of optical (3300-9700 \aa) spectrophotometricobservations of the nearby quintessential "normal" type ia supernova (sn ia) sn2011fe in the galaxy m101, extending from -15 to +97 d with respect to b-bandmaximum, obtained by the nearby supernova factory collaboration. sn 2011fe isthe closest (\mu = 29.04) and brightest (bmax = 9.94 mag) sn ia observed sincethe advent of modern large scale programs for the intensive periodic followupof supernovae. both synthetic light curve measurements and spectral featureanalysis attest to the normality of sn 2011fe. there is very little evidencefor reddening in its host galaxy. the homogeneous calibration, intensive timesampling, and high signal-to-noise ratio of the data set make it unique. thusit is ideal for studying the physics of sn ia explosions in detail, and forfurthering the use of sne ia as standardizable candles for cosmology. severalsuch applications are shown, from the creation of a bolometric light curve andmeasurement of the 56ni mass, to the simulation of detection thresholds forunburned carbon, direct comparisons with other sne ia, and existing spectraltemplates.

1302.4179	p-process in snia	we explore snia as p-process sources in the framework of two-dimensional sniamodels using enhanced s-seed distributions as directly obtained from a sequenceof thermal pulse instabilities. the snia wd precursor is assumed to havereached the chandrasekhar mass limit in a binary system by mass accretion froma giant/main sequence companion. we apply the tracer-particle method toreconstruct the nucleosynthesis from the thermal histories of lagrangianparticles, passively advected in the hydrodynamic calculations. for eachparticle we follow the explosive nucleosynthesis with a detailed nuclearreaction network. we select tracers within the typical temperature range forp-process production, 1.5-3.7 109k, and analyse in detail their behaviour,exploring the influence of different s-process distributions on the p-processnucleosynthesis. we find that snia contribute to a large fraction of p-nuclei,both the light p-nuclei and the heavy-p nuclei at a quite flat averageproduction factor. for the first time, the very abundant ru and mo p-isotopesare reproduced at the same level as the heavy p-nuclei. we investigate themetallicity effect on the p-process production. starting with a range ofs-seeds distributions obtained for different metallicities, running sniatwo-dimensional models and using a simple chemical evolution code, we giveestimates of the snia contribution to the solar p-process composition. we findthat snia contribute for at least 50% at the solar p-nuclei composition, in aprimary way.

1302.6420	towards an understanding of type ia supernovae from a synthesis of  theory and observations	motivated by the fact that calibrated light curves of type ia supernovae (sneia) have become a major tool to determine the expansion history of theuniverse, considerable attention has been given to, both, observations andmodels of these events over the past 15 years. here, we summarize newobservational constraints, address recent progress in modeling type iasupernovae by means of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, and discussseveral of the still open questions. it will be be shown that the new modelshave considerable predictive power which allows us to study observableproperties such as light curves and spectra without adjustable non-physicalparameters. this is a necessary requisite to improve our understanding of theexplosion mechanism and to settle the question of the applicability of sne iaas distance indicators for cosmology. we explore the capabilities of the modelsby comparing them with observations and we show how such models can be appliedto study the origin of the diversity of sne ia.

1304.2777	gamma-ray diagnostics of type ia supernovae: predictions of observables  from three-dimensional modeling	besides the fact that the gamma-ray emission due to radioactive decays isresponsible for powering the light curves of type ia supernovae (sne ia), gammarays themselves are of particular interest as a diagnostic tool because theyprovide a direct way to obtain deeper insights into the nucleosynthesis and thekinematics of these explosion events. focusing on two of the most broadlydiscussed sn ia progenitor scenarios - a delayed detonation in achandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (wd) and a violent merger of two wds - we usethree-dimensional explosion models and perform radiative transfer simulationsto obtain synthetic gamma-ray spectra. both chosen models produce the same massof 56ni and have similar optical properties that are in reasonable agreementwith the recently observed supernova sn 2011fe. in contrast to the opticalregime, the gamma-ray emission of our two chosen models proves to be ratherdifferent. the almost direct connection of the emission of gamma rays tofundamental physical processes occuring in sne ia permits additionalconstraints concerning several explosion model properties that are not easilyaccessible within other wavelength ranges. proposed future mev missions such asgrips will resolve all spectral details only for nearby sne ia, but hardnessratio and light curve measurements still allow for a distinction of the twodifferent models at 10 and 16 mpc for an exposure time of 10^6 s, respectively.the possibility to detect the strongest line features up to the virgo distancewill offer the opportunity to build up a first sample of sn ia detections inthe gamma-ray energy range and underlines the importance of future spaceobservatories for mev gamma rays.

1308.3257	three-dimensional pure deflagration models with nucleosynthesis and  synthetic observables for type ia supernovae	we investigate whether pure deflagration models of chandrasekhar-masscarbon-oxygen white dwarf stars can account for one or more subclass of theobserved population of type ia supernova (sn ia) explosions. we compute a setof 3d full-star hydrodynamic explosion models, in which the deflagrationstrength is parametrized using the multispot ignition approach. for each model,we calculate detailed nucleosynthesis yields in a post-processing step with a384 nuclide nuclear network. we also compute synthetic observables with our 3dmonte carlo radiative transfer code for comparison with observations. for weakand intermediate deflagration strengths (energy release e_nuc &lt;~ 1.1 x 10^51erg), we find that the explosion leaves behind a bound remnant enriched with 3to 10 per cent (by mass) of deflagration ashes. however, we do not obtain thelarge kick velocities recently reported in the literature. we find that weakdeflagrations with e_nuc ~ 0.5 x 10^51 erg fit well both the light curves andspectra of 2002cx-like sne ia, and models with even lower explosion energiescould explain some of the fainter members of this subclass. by comparing oursynthetic observables with the properties of sne ia, we can exclude thebrightest, most vigorously ignited models as candidates for any observed classof sn ia: their b - v colours deviate significantly from both normal and2002cx-like sne ia and they are too bright to be candidates for othersubclasses.

1308.4833	synthetic light curves and spectra for three-dimensional  delayed-detonation models of type ia supernovae	in a companion paper, seitenzahl et al. (2013) presented a set ofthree-dimensional delayed detonation models for thermonuclear explosions ofnear-chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs (wds). here, we present multi-dimensionalradiative transfer simulations that provide synthetic light curves and spectrafor those models. the model sequence explores both changes in the strength ofthe deflagration phase (controlled by the ignition configuration) and the wdcentral density. in agreement with previous studies, we find that the strengthof the deflagration significantly affects the explosion and the observables.variations in the central density also have an influence on both brightness andcolour, but overall it is a secondary parameter in our set of models. in manyrespects, the models yield a good match to normal type ia supernovae (sne ia):peak brightness, rise/decline time scales and synthetic spectra are all inreasonable agreement. there are, however, several differences. in particular,the models are too red around maximum light, manifest spectral line velocitiesthat are a little too high and yield i-band light curves that do not matchobservations. although some of these discrepancies may simply relate toapproximations made in the modelling, some pose real challenges to the models.if viewed as a complete sequence, our models do not reproduce the observedlight-curve width-luminosity relation (wlr) of sne ia: all our models showsimilar b-band decline rates, irrespective of peak brightness. this suggeststhat simple variations in the strength of the deflagration phase inchandrasekhar-mass deflagration-to-detonation models do not readily explain theobserved diversity of normal sne ia. this may imply that some other parameterwithin the chandrasekhar-mass paradigm is key to the wlr, or that a substantialfraction of normal sne ia arise from an alternative explosion scenario.

1311.3645	multi-epoch high-spectral-resolution observations of neutral sodium in  14 type ia supernovae	one of the main questions concerning type ia supernovae is the nature of thebinary companion of the exploding white dwarf. a major discriminant betweendifferent suggested models is the presence and physical properties ofcircumstellar material at the time of explosion. if present, this material willbe ionized by the ultra-violet radiation of the explosion and later recombine.this ionization-recombination should manifest itself as time-variableabsorption features that can be detected via multi-epochhigh-spectral-resolution observations. previous studies have shown that thestrongest effect is seen in the neutral sodium d lines. we report onobservations of neutral sodium absorption features observed in multi-epochhigh-resolution spectra of 14 type ia supernova events. this is the firstmulti-epoch high-resolution study to include multiple sne. no variability inline strength that can be associated with circumstellar material is detected.we find that ~18% of the events in the extended sample exhibit time-variablesodium features associated with circumstellar material. we explore theimplication of this study on our understanding of the progenitor systems oftype ia supernovae via the current type ia supernova multi-epochhigh-spectral-resolution sample.

1405.3677	extensive hst ultraviolet spectra and multi-wavelength observations of  sn 2014j in m82 indicate reddening and circumstellar scattering by typical  dust	sn 2014j in m82 is the closest detected type ia supernova (sn ia) in at least28 years and perhaps in 410 years. despite its small distance of 3.3 mpc, sn2014j is surprisingly faint, peaking at v = 10.6 mag, and assuming a typical snia luminosity, we infer an observed visual extinction of a_v = 2.0 +/- 0.1 mag.but this picture, with r_v = 1.6 +/- 0.2, is too simple to account for allobservations. we combine 10 epochs (spanning a month) of hst/stis ultravioletthrough near-infrared spectroscopy with hst/wfc3, kait, and fancam photometryfrom the optical to the infrared and 9 epochs of high-resolution tresspectroscopy to investigate the sources of extinction and reddening for sn2014j. we argue that the wide range of observed properties for sn 2014j iscaused by a combination of dust reddening, likely originating in theinterstellar medium of m82, and scattering off circumstellar material. for thismodel, roughly half of the extinction is caused by reddening from typical dust(e(b-v ) = 0.45 mag and r_v = 2.6) and roughly half by scattering off lmc-likedust in the circumstellar environment of sn 2014j.

0803.1383	abundance stratification in type ia supernovae - ii: the rapidly  declining, spectroscopically normal sn 2004eo	the variation of properties of type ia supernovae, the thermonuclearexplosions of chandrasekhar-mass carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, is caused bydifferent nucleosynthetic outcomes of these explosions, which can be tracedfrom the distribution of abundances in the ejecta. the compositionstratification of the spectroscopically normal but rapidly declining sn2004eois studied performing spectrum synthesis of a time-series of spectra obtainedbefore and after maximum, and of one nebular spectrum obtained about eightmonths later. early-time spectra indicate that the outer ejecta are dominatedby oxygen and silicon, and contain other intermediate-mass elements (ime),implying that the outer part of the star was subject only to partial burning.in the inner part, nuclear statistical equilibrium (nse) material dominates,but the production of 56ni was limited to ~0.43 \pm 0.05 msun. an innermostzone containing ~0.25 msun of stable fe-group material is also present. therelatively small amount of nse material synthesised by sn2004eo explains boththe dimness and the rapidly evolving light curve of this sn.

1411.2399	testing the role of sne ia for galactic chemical evolution of p-nuclei  with 2d models and with s-process seeds at different metallicities	the bulk of p isotopes is created in the 'gamma processes' mainly bysequences of photodisintegrations and beta decays in explosive conditions intype ia supernovae (snia) or in core collapse supernovae (ccsn). thecontribution of different stellar sources to the observed distribution ofp-nuclei in the solar system is still under debate. we explore singledegenerate type ia supernovae in the framework of two-dimensional sniadelayed-detonation explosion models. travaglio et al. (2011, trv11) discussedthe sensitivity of p-nuclei production to different snia models, i.e. delayeddetonations of different strength, deflagrations, and the dependence onselected s-process seed distributions. here we present a detailed study ofp-process nucleosynthesis occuring in snia with s-process seeds at differentmetallicities. based on the delayed-detonation model ddt-a of trv11, we analyzethe dependence of p-nucleosynthesis on the s-seed distribution obtained fromdifferent strengths of the 13c-pocket. using a galactic chemical evolution code(see travaglio et al. 2004) we study the contribution of snia to the solarstable p-nuclei. we find that explosions of chandrasekhar-mass singledegenerate systems produce a large amount of p-nuclei in our galaxy, both inthe range of light (a &lt; 120) and heavy p-nuclei, at almost flat averageproduction factors (within a factor of about 3). we discussed in detailsp-isotopes such as 94mo with a behavior diverging from the average, which weattribute to uncertainties in the nuclear data or in snia modelling.

1411.4424	a metric space for type ia supernova spectra	we develop a new framework for use in exploring type ia supernova (sn ia)spectra. combining principal component analysis (pca) and partial least squareanalysis (pls) we are able to establish correlations between the principalcomponents (pcs) and spectroscopic/photometric sne ia features. the techniquewas applied to ~120 supernova and ~800 spectra from the nearby supernovafactory. the ability of pca to group together sne ia with similar spectralfeatures, already explored in previous studies, is greatly enhanced by twoimportant modifications: (1) the initial data matrix is built using derivativesof spectra over the wavelength, which increases the weight of weak lines anddiscards extinction, and (2) we extract time evolution information through theuse of entire spectral sequences concatenated in each line of the input datamatrix. these allow us to define a stable pc parameter space which can be usedto characterize synthetic sn ia spectra by means of real sn features. usingpls, we demonstrate that the information from important previously knownspectral indicators (namely the pseudo-equivalent width (pew) of si ii 5972 /si ii 6355 and the line velocity of s ii 5640 / si ii 6355) at a given epoch,is contained within the pc space and can be determined through a linearcombination of the most important pcs. we also show that the pc spaceencompasses photometric features like b or v magnitudes, b-v color and salt2parameters c and x1. the observed colors and magnitudes, that are heavilyaffected by extinction, cannot be reconstructed using this technique alone. allthe above mentioned applications allowed us to construct a metric space forcomparing synthetic sn ia spectra with observations.

0805.1089	optical and ir observations of sn 2002dj: some possible common  properties of fast expanding sne ia	as part of the european supernova collaboration we obtained extensivephotometry and spectroscopy of the type ia sn 2002dj covering epochs from 11days before to nearly two years after maximum. detailed optical andnear-infrared observations show that this object belongs to the class of thehigh-velocity gradient events as indicated by si, s and ca lines. the lightcurve shape and velocity evolution of sn 2002dj appear to be nearly identicalto sn 2002bo. the only significant difference is observed in the optical tonear-ir colours and a reduced spectral emission beyond 6500 a. forhigh-velocity gradient type ia supernovae, we tentatively identify a fasterrise to maximum, a more pronounced inflection in the v and r light curves aftermaximum and a brighter, slower declining late-time b light curve as commonphotometric properties of this class of objects. they also seem to becharacterized by a different colour and colour evolution with respect to``normal'' sne ia. the usual light curve shape parameters do not distinguishthese events. stronger, more blueshifted absorption features ofintermediate-mass elements and lower temperatures are the most prominentspectroscopic features of type ia supernovae displaying high velocitygradients. it appears that these events burn more intermediate-mass elements inthe outer layers. possible connections to the metallicity of the progenitorstar are explored.

1510.04128	type ia supernovae from violent mergers of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs:  polarisation signatures	the violent merger of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs has been proposed as aviable progenitor for some type ia supernovae. however, it has been argued thatthe strong ejecta asymmetries produced by this model might be inconsistent withthe low degree of polarisation typically observed in type ia supernovaexplosions. here, we test this claim by carrying out a spectropolarimetricanalysis for the model proposed by pakmor et al. (2012) for an explosiontriggered during the merger of a 1.1 m$_{\odot}$ and 0.9 m$_{\odot}$carbon-oxygen white dwarf binary system. owing to the asymmetries of theejecta, the polarisation signal varies significantly with viewing angle. wefind that polarisation levels for observers in the equatorial plane are modest($\lesssim$ 1 per cent) and show clear evidence for a dominant axis, as aconsequence of the ejecta symmetry about the orbital plane. in contrast,orientations out of the plane are associated with higher degrees ofpolarisation and departures from a dominant axis. while the particular modelstudied here gives a good match to highly-polarised events such as sn 2004dt,it has difficulties in reproducing the low polarisation levels commonlyobserved in normal type ia supernovae. specifically, we find that significantasymmetries in the element distribution result in a wealth of strongpolarisation features that are not observed in the majority of currentlyavailable spectropolarimetric data of type ia supernovae. future studies willmap out the parameter space of the merger scenario to investigate ifalternative models can provide better agreement with observations.

0807.3331	the impact of type ia supernovae on main sequence binary companions	the nature of type ia supernova progenitors is still unclear. the outstandingcharacteristic of the single-degenerate scenario is that it contains hydrogenin the binary companion of the exploding white dwarf star, which, if mixed intothe ejecta of the supernova in large amounts may lead to conflicts with theobservations thus ruling out the scenario. we investigate the effect of theimpact of type ia supernova ejecta on a main sequence companion star of theprogenitor system. with a series of simulations we investigate how differentparameters of this system affect the amount of hydrogen stripped from thecompanion by the impact. the stellar evolution code garstec is used to set upthe structure of the companion stars mimicking the effect of a binary evolutionphase. the impact itself is simulated with the smoothed particle hydrodynamicscode gadget2. we reproduce and confirm the results of earlier grid-basedhydrodynamical simulation. parameter studies of the progenitor system areextended to include the results of recent binary evolution studies. the morecompact structure of the companion star found here significantly reduces thestripped hydrogen mass. the low hydrogen masses resulting from a more realisticcompanion structure are consistent with current observational constraints.therefore, the single-degenerate scenario remains a valid possibility for typeia supernova progenitors. these new results are not a numerical effect, but theoutcome of different initial conditions.

astro-ph;0312092	the cellular burning regime in type ia supernova explosions - i. flame  propagation into quiescent fuel	we present a numerical investigation of the cellular burning regime in typeia supernova explosions. this regime holds at small scales (i.e. below thegibson scale), which are unresolved in large-scale type ia supernovasimulations. the fundamental effects that dominate the flame evolution here arethe landau-darrieus instability and its nonlinear stabilization, leading to astabilization of the flame in a cellular shape. the flame propagation intoquiescent fuel is investigated addressing the dependence of the simulationresults on the specific parameters of the numerical setup. furthermore, weinvestigate the flame stability at a range of fuel densities. this is directlyconnected to the questions of active turbulent combustion (a mechanism of flamedestabilization and subsequent self-turbulization) and adeflagration-to-detonation transition of the flame. in our simulations we findno substantial destabilization of the flame when propagating into quiescentfuels of densities down to ~10^7 g/cm^3, corroborating fundamental assumptionsof large-scale sn ia explosion models. for these models, however, we suggest anincreased lower cutoff for the flame propagation velocity to take the cellularburning regime into account.

astro-ph;0403509	the case against the progenitor's carbon-to-oxygen ratio as a source of  peak luminosity variations in type ia supernovae	one of the major challenges for theoretical modeling of type ia supernovaexplosions is to explain the diversity of these events and the empiricallyestablished correlation between their peak luminosity and light curve shape. inthe framework of the so-called chandrasekhar mass models, the progenitor'scarbon-to-oxygen ratio has been suggested to be a principal source of peakluminosity variations due to a variation in the production of radioactive$^{56}$ni during the explosion. the underlying idea is that an enhanced carbonmass fraction should result in a more vigorous explosion since here the energyrelease from nuclear reactions is increased. it was suspected that this wouldproduce a higher amount of $^{56}$ni in the ejecta. in this letter we describea mechanism resulting from an interplay between nucleosynthesis and turbulentflame evolution which counteracts such an effect. based on three-dimensionalsimulations we argue that it is nearly balanced and only minor differences inthe amount of synthesized $^{56}$ni with varying carbon mass fraction in theprogenitor can be expected. therefore this progenitor parameter is unlikely toaccount for the observed variations in type ia supernova luminosity. we discusspossible effects on the calibration of cosmological measurements.

astro-ph;0405209	simulations of turbulent thermonuclear burning in type ia supernovae	type ia supernovae have recently received considerable attention because itappears that they can be used as "standard candles" to measure cosmic distancesout to billions of light years away from us. observations of type ia supernovaeseem to indicate that we are living in a universe that started to accelerateits expansion when it was about half its present age. these conclusions restprimarily on phenomenological models which, however, lack proper theoreticalunderstanding, mainly because the explosion process, initiated by thermonuclearfusion of carbon and oxygen into heavier elements, is difficult to simulateeven on supercomputers. here, we investigate a new way of modeling turbulentthermonuclear deflagration fronts in white dwarfs undergoing a type iasupernova explosion. our approach is based on a level set method which treatsthe front as a mathematical discontinuity and allows for full coupling betweenthe front geometry and the flow field. new results of the method applied to theproblem of type ia supernovae are obtained. it is shown that in 2-d with highspatial resolution and a physically motivated subgrid scale model for thenuclear flames numerically "converged" results can be obtained, but for mostinitial conditions the stars do not explode. in contrast, simulations in 3-d,do give the desired explosions and many of their properties, such as theexplosion energies, lightcurves and nucleosynthesis products, are in very goodagreement with observed type ia supernovae.

astro-ph;0406083	on self-similarity properties of isotropic turbulence in numerical  simulations of the compressible euler equations	we present numerical calculations of the parameters $c_{\nu}$, $c_{\epsilon}$and $c_{\kappa}$ associated with the common closures for turbulence production,dissipation and diffusion. in the case of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence,these parameters are expected to be statistically scale-invariant within theinertial subrange. in order to scrutinise this conjecture, we utilised ageneralisation of the germano filtering formalism, which is applicable tocompressible flows as well. the filtering of data obtained fromthree-dimensional direct numerical simulations of forced isotropic turbulencewith mach numbers in the range $\sim 0.1...1$ then yielded values of theclosure parameters associated with different length scales. the resultsindicate that the closure parameters are nearly universal for subsonic ormoderately transonic flows, although the resolution of $432^{3}$ grid cells inour simulations is not quite sufficient to clearly establish scale invariance.in addition, it was found that the customary assumption of a kinetic prandtlnumber of about unity for the gradient-diffusion closure is flawed due to themisalignment between turbulent flux and the gradient of the turbulence energy.nevertheless, sound correlation can be achieved if the flux magnitude ratherthan the flux vector is locally matched. this conclusion is particularly usefulfor the family of subgrid scale models based on the turbulence energy equation.furthermore, the parameter of production $c_{\nu}$ was computed in the fashionof dynamical procedures. thereby, superior agreement between modelled andexplicitly evaluated turbulence stresses in comparison to the eddy-viscosityclosure with constant $c_{\nu}$ was verified.

astro-ph;0406281	nucleosynthesis in multi-dimensional snia explosions	we present the results of nucleosynthesis calculations based onmultidimensional (2d and 3d) hydrodynamical simulations of the thermonuclearburning phase in snia. the detailed nucleosynthetic yields of our explosionmodels are calculated by post-processing the ejecta, using passively advectedtracer particles. the nuclear reaction network employed in computing theexplosive nucleosynthesis contains 383 nuclear species. we analyzed twodifferent choices of ignition conditions (centrally ignited, in which thespherical initial flame geometry is perturbated with toroidal rings, andbubbles, in which multi-point ignition conditions are simulated). we show thatunburned c and o varies typically from ~40% to ~50% of the total ejectedmaterial.the main differences between all our models and standard 1dcomputations are, besides the higher mass fraction of unburned c and o, the c/oratio (in our case is typically a factor of 2.5 higher than in 1dcomputations), and somewhat lower abundances of certain intermediate massnuclei such as s, cl, ar, k, and ca, and of 56ni. because explosive c and oburning may produce the iron-group elements and their isotopes in ratherdifferent proportions one can get different 56ni-fractions (and thus supernovaluminosities) without changing the kinetic energy of the explosion. finally, weshow that we need the high resolution multi-point ignition (bubbles) model toburn most of the material in the center (demonstrating that high resolutioncoupled with a large number of ignition spots is crucial to get rid of unburnedmaterial in a pure deflagration snia model).

astro-ph;0601500	a localised subgrid scale model for fluid dynamical simulations in  astrophysics ii: application to type ia supernovae	the dynamics of the explosive burning process is highly sensitive to theflame speed model in numerical simulations of type ia supernovae. based uponthe hypothesis that the effective flame speed is determined by the unresolvedturbulent velocity fluctuations, we employ a new subgrid scale model whichincludes a localised treatment of the energy transfer through the turbulencecascade in combination with semi-statistical closures for the dissipation andnon-local transport of turbulence energy. in addition, subgrid scale buoyancyeffects are included. in the limit of negligible energy transfer and transport,the dynamical model reduces to the sharp-wheeler relation. according to ourfindings, the sharp-wheeler relation is insuffcient to account for thecomplicated turbulent dynamics of flames in thermonuclear supernovae. theapplication of a co-moving grid technique enables us to achieve very highspatial resolution in the burning region. turbulence is produced mostly at theflame surface and in the interior ash regions. consequently, there is apronounced anisotropy in the vicinity of the flame fronts. the localisedsubgrid scale model predicts significantly enhanced energy generation and lessunburnt carbon and oxygen at low velocities compared to earlier simulations.

astro-ph;0603036	theoretical light curves for deflagration models of type ia supernova	we present synthetic bolometric and broad-band ubvri light curves of sne ia,for four selected 3-d deflagration models of thermonuclear supernovae. thelight curves are computed with the 1-d hydro code stella, which models(multi-group time-dependent) non-equilibrium radiative transfer inside snejecta. angle-averaged results from 3-d hydrodynamical explosion simulationswith the composition determined in a nucleosynthetic postprocessing step servedas the input to the radiative transfer model. the predicted model ubv lightcurves do agree reasonably well with the observed ones for sne ia in the rangeof low to normal luminosities, although the underlying hydrodynamical explosionmodels produced only a modest amount of radioactive ni56 and relatively lowkinetic energy in the explosion. the evolution of predicted b and v fluxes inthe model with a ni56 mass of 0.42 m_sun follows the observed decline rateafter the maximum very well, although the behavior of fluxes in other filterssomewhat deviates from observations, and the bolometric decline rate is a bitslow. using our models, we check the validity of arnett's rule and the accuracyof the procedure for extracting the ni56 mass from the observed light curves.we find that the comparison between theoretical light curves and observationsprovides a useful tool to validate sn ia models. the steps necessary to improvethe agreement between theory and observations are set out.

astro-ph;0609088	off-center ignition in type ia supernova: i. initial evolution and  implications for delayed detonation	the explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf as a type ia supernova is knownto be sensitive to the manner in which the burning is ignited. studies of thepre-supernova evolution suggest asymmetric, off-center ignition, and here weexplore its consequences in two- and three-dimensional simulations. comparedwith centrally ignited models, one-sided ignitions initially burn less andrelease less energy. for the distributions of ignition points studied, ignitionwithin two hemispheres typically leads to the unbinding of the white dwarf,while ignition within a small fraction of one hemisphere does not. we alsoexamine the spreading of the blast over the surface of the white dwarf thatoccurs as the first plumes of burning erupt from the star. in particular, ourstudies test whether the collision of strong compressional waves can trigger adetonation on the far side of the star as has been suggested by plewa et al.(2004). the maximum temperature reached in these collisions is sensitive to howmuch burning and expansion has already gone on, and to the dimensionality ofthe calculation. though detonations are sometimes observed in 2d models, noneever happens in the corresponding 3d calculations. collisions between theexpansion fronts of multiple bubbles also seem, in the usual case, unable toignite a detonation. "gravitationally confined detonation" is therefore not arobust mechanism for the explosion. detonation may still be possible in thesemodels however, either following a pulsation or by spontaneous detonation ifthe turbulent energy is high enough.

astro-ph;0702344	off-center explosions of chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs: an explanation  of super-bright type ia supernovae?	the recent discovery of a very bright type ia supernova, snls-03d3bb($\equiv$ sn 2003fg), in the supernova legacy survey (snls) has raised thequestion of whether super-chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf stars are needed toexplain such explosions. in principle, such a progenitor could form by themergers of two rather massive white dwarfs. binary systems of two white dwarfsin close orbit where their total mass significantly exceeds the chandrasekharmass, have not yet been found. therefore snls-03d3bb could establish the firstclear case of a double-degenerate progenitor of a (peculiar) type iasupernovae. moreover, if this interpretation is correct, it casts some doubt onthe universality of the calibration relations used to make sne ia distanceindicators for cosmology. here we present a critical discussion of the expectedobservational finger prints of super-chandrasekhar-mass explosions; inimportant respects, these are not consistent with the observations ofsnls-03d3bb. we demonstrate that the lop-sided explosion of achandrasekhar-mass white dwarf could provide a better explanation.

astro-ph;0702351	a common explosion mechanism for type ia supernovae	type ia supernovae, the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf starscomposed of carbon and oxygen, were instrumental as distance indicators inestablishing the acceleration of the universe's expansion. however, the physicsof the explosion are debated. here we report a systematic spectral analysis ofa large sample of well observed type ia supernovae. mapping the velocitydistribution of the main products of nuclear burning, we constrain theoreticalscenarios. we find that all supernovae have low-velocity cores of stableiron-group elements. outside this core, nickel-56 dominates the supernovaejecta. the outer extent of the iron-group material depends on the amount ofnickel-56 and coincides with the inner extent of silicon, the principal productof incomplete burning. the outer extent of the bulk of silicon is similar inall sne, having an expansion velocity of ~11000 km/s and corresponding to amass of slightly over one solar mass. this indicates that all the supernovaeconsidered here burned similar masses, and suggests that their progenitors hadthe same mass. synthetic light curve parameters and three-dimensional explosionsimulations support this interpretation. a single explosion scenario, possiblya delayed detonation, may thus explain most type ia supernovae.

astro-ph;0702565	esc and kait observations of the transitional type ia sn 2004eo	we present optical and infrared observations of the unusual type ia supernova(sn) 2004eo. the light curves and spectra closely resemble those of theprototypical sn 1992a, and the luminosity at maximum (m_b = -19.08) is close tothe average for a sn ia. however, the ejected 56ni mass derived by modellingthe bolometric light curve (about 0.45 solar masses) lies near the lower limitof the 56ni mass distribution observed in normal sne ia. accordingly, sn 2004eoshows a relatively rapid post-maximum decline in the light curve (delta m_(b) =1.46), small expansion velocities in the ejecta, and a depth ratio si ii 5972 /si ii 6355 similar to that of sn 1992a. the physical properties of sn 2004eocause it to fall very close to the boundary between the faint, low velocitygradient, and high velocity gradient subgroups proposed by benetti et al.(2005). similar behaviour is seen in a few other sne ia. thus, there may infact exist a few sne ia with intermediate physical properties.

astro-ph;9707230	the fate of a neutron star just below the minimum mass: does it explode?	first results of numerical simulations are presented which compute thedynamical evolution of a neutron star with a mass slightly below the minimumstable mass by means of a new implicit (general relativistic) hydrodynamiccode. we show that such a star first undergoes a phase of quasi-staticexpansion, caused by slow nuclear $\beta$-decays, lasting for about 20 seconds,but then explodes violently. the kinetic energy of the explosion is around$10^{49} erg$, the peak luminosity in electron anti-neutrinos is of order$10^{52} erg/s$, and the thermodynamic conditions of the expanding matter arefavorable for r-process nucleosynthesis. these results are obtained for theharrison-wheeler equation of state and a simple and, possibly, unrealistictreatment of $\beta$-decay rates and nuclear fission, which were adopted forcomparison with previous works. however, we do not expect that the outcome willchange qualitatively if more recent nuclear input physics used. although ourstudy does not rely on a specific scenario ofhow a neutron star starting from abigger (and stable) masscan reach the dynamical phase, we assume that the finalmass-loss event happens on a very short time scale, i.e., on a time scaleshorter than a sound-crossing time, by removing a certain amount of mass as aninitial perturbation. this assumption implies that the star has no time toadjust its nuclear composition to the new mass mass through a sequence ofquasi-equilibria. in the latter case, however, there exists no stableconfiguration below the minimum mass, because the equation of state of fullycatalyzed matter is too soft. therefore, the dynamics of the explosion will notbe too different from what have obtained if different initial perturbations areassumed.

astro-ph;9801054	two-dimensional simulations of the thermonuclear runaway in an accreted  atmosphere of a c+o white dwarf	we present the results of two-dimensional calculations of turbulent nuclearburning of hydrogen-rich material accreted onto a white dwarf of 1 solar mass.the main aim of the present paper is to investigate the question as to whetherand how the general properties of the burning are affected by numericalresolution effects. in particular, we want to see whether or not convectiveovershooting into the surface layers of the c+o white dwarf can lead toself-enrichment of the initially solar composition of the hydrogen-richenvelope with carbon and oxygen from the underlying white dwarf core. ourexplicit hydrodynamic code is based on the ppm-method and computes the onset ofthe thermonuclear runaway on a cartesian grid. in contrast to previous works wedo not observe fast mixing of carbon and oxygen from the white dwarf's surfaceinto the envelope by violent overshooting of large eddies. the main features ofthe flow fields in our simulations are the appearance of small persistentcoherent structures of very high vorticity (and velocity) compared to thebackground flow. their typical linear scales are about 10 to 20 grid zones andthus their physical size depends on the numerical resolution, i.e, their sizedecreases with increasing resolution. the two simulations (low and highresolution) which are presented here show only moderate differences inspatially integrated quantities such as laterally averaged temperature, energygeneration rate, and chemical composition. we have not expanded bothsimulations equally long, but for the physical time under consideration themajor difference seems to be that the highly resolved simulation is a bit lessviolent. in conclusion, we do find some self-enrichment, but on time-scalesmuch longer than in previous calculations.

astro-ph;9811259	three-dimensional simulations of classical novae	we present first results of three-dimensional (3d-) calculations of turbulentand degenerate hydrogen-burning on top of a c+o white dwarf of one solar mass.the simulations are carried out by means of a code which solves euler'sequation for an arbitrary equation of state together with a nuclear reactionnetwork and the energy input from nuclear reactions on a cartesian gridcovering a fraction of the white dwarf's surface and accreted atmosphere. theflow patterns we obtain are very different from those of earlier 2d simulationsusing the same initial conditions and the same numerical resolution. thepossibility of self-enrichment of the accreted hydrogen-rich atmosphere withcarbon and oxygen from the surface layers of the white dwarf during the violentphase of the burning is investigated, and it is demonstrated thatself-enrichment proceeds too slowly if the accreted gas has near-solarcno-abundances at the onset of the thermonuclear runaway. as a result, we donot find a fast nova outburst. this conclusion remains valid if the initialmetallicity of the accreted gas is raised by a factor of five. therefore weconclude that fast nova outbursts indeed require huge enrichments of c and o,as postulated from spherically symmetric models, and that the mechanism whichleads to such enhancements must operate prior to the outburst.

astro-ph;9812120	thermonuclear explosions of chandrasekhar-mass c+o white dwarfs	first results of simulations are presented which compute the dynamicalevolution of a chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, consisting of equal amounts ofcarbon and oxygen, from the onset of violent thermonuclear burning, by means ofa new two-dimensional numerical code. since in the interior of such a massivewhite dwarf nuclear burning progresses on microscopic scales as a sharpdiscontinuity, a so-called flamelet, which cannot be resolved by any numericalscheme, and since on macroscopic scales the burning front propagates due toturbulence, we make an attempt to model both effects explicitly in theframework of a finite-volume hydrodynamics code. turbulence is included by asub-grid model, following the spirit of large eddy simulations, and thewell-localized burning front is treated by means of a level set, which allowsus to compute the geometrical structure of the front more accurately than withprevious methods. the only free parameters of our simulations are the locationand the amount of nuclear fuel that is ignited as an initial perturbation. wefind that models in which explosive carbon burning is ignited at the centerremain bound by the time the front reaches low densities, where we stopped thecomputations because our description of combustion is no longer applicable. incontrast, off-center ignition models give rise to explosions which, however,are still too weak for typical type ia supernovae. possible reasons for thisrather disappointing result are discussed.

astro-ph;9904378	titanium-44: its effective decay rate in young supernova remnants, and  its abundance in cas a	radioactive isotopes such as 44ti offer probably the most direct probe intonucleosynthesis environments in the interior of exploding stars, when theassociated gamma-ray activities in the explosion remnant are detected andtranslated back to the isotopic abundances at the time of the explosion. inthis paper, we assert that the procedure may not necessarily bestraightforward, at least in the case of 44ti, an orbital-electron capturedecay isotope. using the analytic model of mckee and truelove (1995) for youngsupernova remnants, and assuming the existence of overdense 56fe-dominatedclumps that contain also 44ti, we show that a high degree of ionization may becaused by the reverse shock so that the electron-capture rate of 44ti could besignificantly reduced from its laboratory value. when applied to cas a, thisincreases under certain conditions the current 44ti-activity by a factor 1.5 -2.5, which yields a better compatibility between the comptel observation of the1.16 mev line activity associated with the 44ti decay and the sn modelpredictions of the initial 44ti abundance. this possibility is, however,subject to various uncertainties, and in particular to the unknown propertiesand radial distribution of the the clumps in the ejecta.

astro-ph;9909508	distributed burning in type ia supernovae: a statistical approach	we present a statistical model which shows the influence of turbulence on athermonuclear flame propagating in c+o white dwarf matter. based on a montecarlo description of turbulence, it provides a method for investigating thephysics in the so-called distributed burning regime. using this method weperform numerical simulations of turbulent flames and show that in thisparticular regime the flamelet model for the turbulent flame velocity loses itsvalidity. in fact, at high turbulent intensities burning in the distributedregime can lead to a deceleration of the turbulent flame and thus induces acompeting process to turbulent effects that cause a higher flame speed. it isalso shown that in dense c+o matter turbulent heat transport is describedadequately by the peclet number, pe, rather than by the reynolds number, whichmeans that flame propagation is decoupled from small-scale turbulence. finally,at the onset of our results we argue that the available turbulent energy in anexploding c+o white dwarf is probably too low in order to make a deflagrationto detonation transition possible.
