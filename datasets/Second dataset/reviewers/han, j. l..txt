0901.1165	magnetic structure of our galaxy: a review of observations	the magnetic structure in the galactic disk, the galactic center and thegalactic halo can be delineated more clearly than ever before. in the galacticdisk, the magnetic structure has been revealed by starlight polarization within2 or 3 kpc of the solar vicinity, by the distribution of the zeeman splittingof oh masers in two or three nearby spiral arms, and by pulsar dispersionmeasures and rotation measures in nearly half of the disk. the polarizedthermal dust emission of clouds at infrared, mm and submm wavelengths and thediffuse synchrotron emission are also related to the large-scale magnetic fieldin the disk. the rotation measures of extragalactic radio sources at lowgalactic latitudes can be modeled by electron distributions and large-scalemagnetic fields. the statistical properties of the magnetized interstellarmedium at various scales have been studied using rotation measure data andpolarization data. in the galactic center, the non-thermal filaments indicatepoloidal fields. there is no consensus on the field strength, maybe mg, maybetens of ug. the polarized dust emission and much enhanced rotation measures ofbackground radio sources are probably related to toroidal fields. in thegalactic halo, the antisymmetric rm sky reveals large-scale toroidal fieldswith reversed directions above and below the galactic plane. magnetic fieldsfrom all parts of our galaxy are connected to form a global field structure.more observations are needed to explore the untouched regions and delineate howfields in different parts are connected.

0903.0721	the spiral structure of our milky way galaxy	the spiral structure of our milky way galaxy is not yet known. hii regionsand giant molecular clouds are the most prominent spiral tracers. we collectedthe spiral tracer data of our milky way from the literature, namely, hiiregions and giant molecular clouds (gmcs). with weighting factors based on theexcitation parameters of hii regions or the masses of gmcs, we fitted thedistribution of these tracers with models of two, three, four spiral-arms orpolynomial spiral arms. the distances of tracers, if not available from stellaror direct measurements, were estimated kinetically from the standard rotationcurve of brand &amp; blitz (1993) with $r_0$=8.5 kpc, and $\theta_0$=220 kms$^{-1}$ or the newly fitted rotation curves with $r_0$=8.0 kpc and$\theta_0$=220 km s$^{-1}$ or $r_0$=8.4 kpc and $\theta_0$=254 km s$^{-1}$. wefound that the two-arm logarithmic model cannot fit the data in many regions.the three- and the four-arm logarithmic models are able to connect mosttracers. however, at least two observed tangential directions cannot be matchedby the three- or four-arm model. we composed a polynomial spiral arm model,which can not only fit the tracer distribution but also match observedtangential directions. using new rotation curves with $r_0$=8.0 kpc and$\theta_0$=220 km s$^{-1}$ and $r_0$=8.4 kpc and $\theta_0$=254 km s$^{-1}$ forthe estimation of kinematic distances, we found that the distribution of hiiregions and gmcs can fit the models well, although the results do not changesignificantly compared to the parameters with the standard $r_0$ and$\theta_0$.

0907.2611	formation of sub-millisecond pulsars and possibility of detection	pulsars have been recognized as normal neutron stars, but sometimes argued asquark stars. {\it sub-millisecond pulsars, if detected, would play an essentialand important role in distinguishing quark stars from neutron stars.} we focuson the formation of such sub-millisecond pulsars in this paper. a new approachto form a sub-millisecond pulsar (quark star) via accretion induced collapse(aic) of a white dwarf is investigated here. under this aic process, we foundthat: (1) almost all the newborn quark stars could have an initial spin periodof $\sim 0.1$ ms; (2) the nascent quark stars (even with a low mass) havesufficiently high spin-down luminosity and satisfy the conditions for pairproduction and sparking process to be as sub-millisecond radio pulsars; (3) inmost cases, the timescales of newborn quark stars in the phase of spin period$&lt; 1$ (or $&lt;0.5$) ms can be long enough to be detected.  as a comparison, an accretion spin-up process (for both neutron and quarkstars) is also investigated. it is found that, quark stars formed through aicprocess can have shorter periods ($\leq$ 0.5 ms); while the periods of neutronstars formed in accretion spin-up process must be longer than 0.5ms. thus if apulsar with a period less than 0.5 ms can be identified in the future, itshould be a quark star.

0908.2297	ultra-luminous infrared galaxies in sloan digital sky survey data  release 6	ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) are interesting objects withdramatic properties. many efforts have been made to understand the physics oftheir luminous infrared emission and evolutionary stages. however, a largeulirg sample is still needed to study the properties of their central blackholes (bhs), the bh-host galaxy relation, and their evolution. we identified308 ulirgs from the sloan digital sky survey data release 6, and classifiedthem into the nl ulirgs (with only narrow emission lines) and the type i ulirgs(with broad emission lines). about 56% of ulirgs in our total sample showinteraction features, and this percentage is 79% for redshift z &lt; 0.2. opticalidentifications of these ulirgs show that the agn percentage is at least 49%,and the percentage increases with the infrared luminosity. we found 62 type iulirgs, and estimated their bh masses and velocity dispersions from theiroptical spectra. together with known type i ulirgs in the literature, a sampleof 90 type i ulirgs enables us to make a statistical study. we found that thebh masses of type i ulirgs are typically smaller than those of pg qsos, andmost type i ulirgs follow the m_{bh}-sigma relation. however, some ulirgs withlarger eddington ratio deviate from this relation, even the line width of the[oiii] narrow line (nl) core or the [sii] line was used as the surrogate ofvelocity dispersion. this implies that at least some ulirgs are probably stillin the early evolution stage toward qsos. the anti-correlation between the massdeviation from the m_{bh}-sigma relation and the eddington ratio supports thatthe evolution of type i ulirgs is probably followed by the building up of them_{bh}-sigma relation and the evolution to the qso phase.

1004.3213	the annular gap model for gamma-ray emission from young and millisecond  pulsars	pulsed high energy radiation from pulsars is not yet completely understood.in this paper, we use the 3d self-consistent annular gap model to study lightcurves for both young and millisecond pulsars observed by the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope. the annular gap can generate high energy emission forshort-period pulsars. the annular gap regions are so large that they haveenough electric potential drop to accelerate charged particles to producegamma-ray photons. for young pulsars, the emission region is from the neutronstar surface to about half of the light cylinder radius, and the peakemissivity is in the vicinity of the null charge surface. the emission regionfor the millisecond pulsars is located much lower than that of the youngpulsars. the higher energy gamma-ray emission comes from higher altitudes inthe magnetosphere. we present the simulated light curves for three youngpulsars (the crab, the vela, the geminga) and three millisecond pulsars (psrj0030+0451, psr j0218+4232, psr j0437-3715) using the annular gap model. oursimulations can reproduce the main properties of observed light curves.

1007.2367	radio sources with ultra-high polarization	a sample of 129 unresolved radio sources with ultrahigh linear polarization(&gt;30 per cent) has been selected from the nrao vla sky survey. such highaverage linear polarization is unusual in extragalactic sources. higherresolution australia telescope compact array and very large array observationsconfirm the high average polarization but find that most of these sources areextended. the sloan digital sky survey spectroscopy, where available, showsthat the optical counterparts are elliptical galaxies with no detectableemission lines. the optical spectra, radio luminosity, linear size and spectralindex of these sources are typical of radio-loud active galactic nuclei. galaxycounts within a 1 mpc radius of the radio sources show that these highlypolarized sources are in environments similar to their low polarization (&lt;2 percent) counterparts. similarly, the line-of-sight environments of the ultrahighpolarization sources are on average indistinguishable from those of thelow-polarization sources. we conclude that the extraordinarily high averagepolarization must be due to intrinsic properties of the sources, such as anextremely ordered source magnetic field, low internal thermal plasma density ora preferential orientation of the source magnetic field perpendicular to theline of sight.

1102.2476	gamma-ray emission from the vela pulsar modeled with the annular gap and  core gap	the vela pulsar represents a distinct group of {\gamma}-ray pulsars. fermi{\gamma}-ray observations reveal that it has two sharp peaks (p1 and p2) in thelight curve with a phase separation of 0.42 and a third peak (p3) in thebridge. the location and intensity of p3 are energy-dependent. we use the 3dmagnetospheric model for the annular gap and core gap to simulate the{\gamma}-ray light curves, phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectra. we foundthat the acceleration electric field along a field line in the annular gapregion decreases with heights. the emission at high energy gev band isoriginated from the curvature radiation of accelerated primary particles, whilethe synchrotron radiation from secondary particles have some contributions tolow energy {\gamma}-ray band (0.1 - 0.3 gev). the {\gamma}-ray light curvepeaks p1 and p2 are generated in the annular gap region near the altitude ofnull charge surface, whereas p3 and the bridge emission is generated in thecore gap region. the intensity and location of p3 at different energy bandsdepend on the emission altitudes. the radio emission from the vela pulsarshould be generated in a high-altitude narrow regions of the annular gap, whichleads to a radio phase lag of ~ 0.13 prior to the first {\gamma}-ray peak.

1203.5995	curvature radiation in rotating pulsar magnetosphere	we consider the curvature emission properties from relativistic particlesstreaming along magnetic field lines and co-rotating with pulsar magnetosphere.the co-rotation affects the trajectories of the particles and hence theemission properties, especially the polarization. we consider the modificationof the particle velocity and acceleration due to the co-rotation. curvatureradiation from a single particle is calculated using the approximation of acircular path to the particle trajectory. curvature radiation from particles ata given height actually contains the contributions from particles streamingalong all the nearby field lines around the tangential point, forming theemission cone of 1/{\gamma}. the polarization patterns from the emission coneare distorted by the additional rotation, more serious for emission from alarger height. net circular polarization can be generated by the densitygradient in the emission cone. for three typical density models in the form ofcore, cone and patches, we calculate the polarization profiles for emissiongenerated at a given height. we find that the circular polarization could havea single sign or sign reversal, depending on the density gradient along therotation phase. the polarization profiles of the total curvature radiation fromthe whole open field line region, calculated by adding the emission from allpossible heights, are similar to that from a dominating emission height. thecircular polarization of curvature radiation has sign reversals in the patchyemission, while it has a single sign for the core emission, and is negligiblefor the cone emission.

1303.5181	modeling the frequency-dependence of radio beams for cone-dominant  pulsars	beam radii for cone-dominant pulsars follow a power-law relation withfrequency, $\vartheta = (\nu/\nu_0)^k+\vartheta_0$, which has not yet wellexplained in previous works. we study this frequency dependence of beam radius(fdb) for cone-dominant pulsars by using the curvature radiation mechanism.considering various density and energy distributions of particles in the pulsaropen field line region, we numerically simulate the emission intensitydistribution across emission height and rotation phase, and get integratedprofiles at different frequencies and obtain the fdb curves. for the densitymodel of a conal-like distribution, the simulated profiles always shrink to onecomponent at high frequencies. in the density model with two separated densitypatches, the profiles always have two distinct components, and the power-lawindices $k$ are found to be in the range from -0.1 to -2.5, consistent withobservational results. energy distributions of streaming particles havesignificant influence on the frequency-dependence behavior. radial energy decayof particles are necessary to get proper $\vartheta_0$ in models. we concludethat by using the curvature radiation mechanism, the observed frequencydependence of beam radius for the cone-dominant pulsars can only be explainedby the emission model of particles in two density patches with a gaussianenergy distribution and a radial energy loss.

1404.1431	polarized curvature radiation in pulsar magnetosphere	the propagation of polarized emission in pulsar magnetosphere is investigatedin this paper. the polarized waves are generated through curvature radiationfrom the relativistic particles streaming along curved magnetic field lines andco-rotating with the pulsar magnetosphere. within the 1/{\deg} emission cone,the waves can be divided into two natural wave mode components, the ordinary(o) mode and the extraord nary (x) mode, with comparable intensities. bothcomponents propagate separately in magnetosphere, and are aligned within thecone by adiabatic walking. the refraction of o-mode makes the two componentsseparated and incoherent. the detectable emission at a given height and a givenrotation phase consists of incoherent x-mode and o-mode components coming fromdiscrete emission regions. for four particle-density models in the form ofuniformity, cone, core and patches, we calculate the intensities for each modenumerically within the entire pulsar beam. if the co-rotation of relativisticparticles with magnetosphere is not considered, the intensity distributions forthe x-mode and o-mode components are quite similar within the pulsar beam,which causes serious depolarization. however, if the co-rotation ofrelativistic particles is considered, the intensity distributions of the twomodes are very different, and the net polarization of out-coming emissionshould be significant. our numerical results are compared with observations,and can naturally explain the orthogonal polarization modes of some pulsars.strong linear polarizations of some parts of pulsar profile can be reproducedby curvature radiation and subsequent propagation effect.

1406.3902	discovery of a new supernova remnant g150.3+4.5	large-scale radio continuum surveys have good potential for discovering newgalactic supernova remnants (snrs). surveys of the galactic plane are oftenlimited in the galactic latitude of |b| ~ 5 degree. snrs at high latitudes,such as the cygnus loop or cta~1, cannot be detected by surveys in such limitedlatitudes. using the available urumqi 6 cm galactic plane survey data, togetherwith the maps from the extended ongoing 6 cm medium latitude survey, we wish todiscover new snrs in a large sky area. we searched for shell-like structuresand calculated radio spectra using the urumqi 6 cm, effelsberg 11 cm, and 21 cmsurvey data. radio polarized emission and evidence in other wavelengths arealso examined for the characteristics of snrs. we discover an enclosedoval-shaped object g150.3+4.5 in the 6 cm survey map. it is about 2.5 degreewide and 3 degree high. parts of the shell structures can be identified well inthe 11 cm, 21 cm, and 73.5 cm observations. the effelsberg 21 cm totalintensity image resembles most of the structures of g150.3+4.5 seen at 6 cm,but the loop is not closed in the northwest. high resolution images at 21 cmand 73.5 cm from the canadian galactic plane survey confirm the extendedemission from the eastern and western shells of g150.3+4.5. we calculated theradio continuum spectral indices of the eastern and western shells, which are$\beta \sim -2.4$ and $\beta \sim -2.7$ between 6 cm and 21 cm, respectively.the shell-like structures and their non-thermal nature strongly suggest thatg150.3+4.5 is a shell-type snr. for other objects in the field of view,g151.4+3.0 and g151.2+2.6, we confirm that the shell-like structure g151.4+3.0very likely has a snr origin, while the circular-shaped g151.2+2.6 is an hiiregion with a flat radio spectrum, associated with optical filamentarystructure, h$\alpha$, and infrared emission.

1407.7331	the observed spiral structure of the milky way	the spiral structure of the milky way is not yet well determined. the keys tounderstanding this structure are to increase the number of reliable spiraltracers and to determine their distances as accurately as possible. hiiregions, giant molecular clouds (gmcs), and 6.7-ghz methanol masers are closelyrelated to high mass star formation, and hence they are excellent spiraltracers. we update the catalogs of galactic hii regions, gmcs, and 6.7-ghzmethanol masers, and then outline the spiral structure of the milky way. wecollected data for more than 2500 known hii regions, 1300 gmcs, and 900 6.7-ghzmethanol masers. if the photometric or trigonometric distance was not yetavailable, we determined the kinematic distance using a galaxy rotation curvewith the current iau standard, $r_0$ = 8.5 kpc and $\theta_0$ = 220 kms$^{-1}$, and the most recent updated values of $r_0$ = 8.3 kpc and $\theta_0$= 239 km s$^{-1}$, after we modified the velocities of tracers with the adoptedsolar motions. with the weight factors based on the excitation parameters ofhii regions or the masses of gmcs, we get the distributions of these spiraltracers. the distribution of tracers shows at least four segments of arms inthe first galactic quadrant, and three segments in the fourth quadrant. theperseus arm and the local arm are also delineated by many bright hii regions.the arm segments traced by massive star forming regions and gmcs are able tomatch the hi arms in the outer galaxy. we found that the models of three-armand four-arm logarithmic spirals are able to connect most spiral tracers. amodel of polynomial-logarithmic spirals is also proposed, which not onlydelineates the tracer distribution, but also matches the observed tangentialdirections.

1501.00066	on frequency dependence of pulsar linear polarization	frequency dependence of pulsar linear polarization is investigated bysimulations of emission and propagation processes. linearly polarized waves aregenerated through curvature radiation by relativistic particles streaming alongcurved magnetic field lines, which have ordinary mode (o-mode) andextra-ordinary mode (x-mode) components. as emitted waves propagate outwards,two mode components are separated due to re- fraction of the o mode, and theirpolarization states are also modified. according to the radius to frequencymapping, low frequency emission is generated from higher magnetosphere, wheresignificant rotation effect leads the x and o modes to be sepa- rated. hence,the low frequency radiation has a large fraction of linear polarization. as thefrequency increases, emission is generated from lower heights, where therotation effect becomes weaker and the distribution regions of two modes aremore overlapped. hence, more significant depolarization appears for emission athigher frequencies. in addition, refraction effect of the o mode becomesserious in very deep magnetosphere, which bends the o mode emission towardsouter parts of a pulsar beam and also causes the separation of modedistribution regions and hence the fractional linear polariza- tion increasingwith frequency. if emission of different frequencies is generated from a regionof the same height, serious o mode refraction can result in the decrease ofboth profile width and fractional linear polarization. the observed frequencydependence of linear polarization for some pulsars can be naturally explainedwithin the scope of our scenario.

0805.3454	observational constraints on models for the interstellar magnetic field  in the galactic disk	our purpose is to place firm observational constraints on the three mostwidely used theoretical models for the spatial configuration of the large-scaleinterstellar magnetic field in the galactic disk, namely, the ring, theaxisymmetric and the bisymmetric field models.  we use the rotation measures (rms) of low-latitude galactic pulsars andcombine them with their dispersion measures and estimated distances to map outthe line-of-sight component of the interstellar magnetic field in the near halfof the galactic disk. we then fit our map of the line-of-sight field to thethree aforementioned theoretical field models and discuss the acceptability ofeach fit, in order to determine whether the considered field model is allowedby the pulsar data or not.  strictly speaking, we find that all three field models are ruled out by thepulsar data. furthermore, none of them appears to perform significantly betterthan the others. from this we conclude that the large-scale interstellarmagnetic field in the galactic disk has a more complex pattern than justcircular, axisymmetric or bisymmetric.

1510.04980	the scaling relations and the fundamental plane for radio halos and  relics of galaxy clusters	diffuse radio emission in galaxy clusters is known to be related to clustermass and cluster dynamical state. we collect the observed fluxes of radiohalos, relics, and mini-halos for a sample of galaxy clusters from theliterature, and calculate their radio powers. we then obtain the values ofcluster mass or mass proxies from previous observations, and also obtain thevarious dynamical parameters of these galaxy clusters from optical and x-raydata. the radio powers of relics, halos, and mini-halos are correlated with thecluster masses or mass proxies, as found by previous authors, with thecorrelations concerning giant radio halos being, in general, the strongestones. we found that the inclusion of dynamical parameters as the thirddimension can significantly reduce the data scatter for the scaling relations,especially for radio halos. we therefore conclude that the substructures inx-ray images of galaxy clusters and the irregular distributions of opticalbrightness of member galaxies can be used to quantitatively characterize theshock waves and turbulence in the intracluster medium responsible forre-accelerating particles to generate the observed diffuse radio emission. thepower of radio halos and relics is correlated with cluster mass proxies anddynamical parameters in the form of a fundamental plane.

0806.1647	the radio spectrum and magnetic field structure of snr hb3	evidence for a spectral flattening of the supernova remnant (snr) hb3(g132.7+1.3) was recently claimed in literature based on previously publishedtotal flux density data, and the flattening was further interpreted as thediscovery of thermal bremsstrahlung emission in the shell of hb3. a spectralflattening has never been observed from any snr before. reliable observationsof hb3 at frequencies above 3000 mhz are crucial to confirm such a spectralbehaviour. we extracted 4800 mhz total intensity and polarisation data of hb3from the sino-german 6 cm polarisation survey of the galactic plane made withthe urumqi 25 m telescope, and analysed the spectrum of hb3, together witheffelsberg data at 1408 mhz and 2675 mhz. we found an overall spectral index ofhb3 of alpha=-0.61+-0.06 between 1408 mhz and 4800 mhz, similar to the index atlower frequencies. there is no spectral flattening at high frequencies. wedetected strong polarised emission from hb3 at 4800 mhz. our 4800 mhz data showa tangential field orientation in the hb3 shell.

astro-ph;0110219	on black hole masses, radio-loudness and bulge luminosities of seyfert  galaxies	we estimated black hole masses for 9 seyfert 1 and 13 seyfert 2 galaxies inthe palomar and cfa bright seyfert samples using the tight correlation betweenblack hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion. combining other 13 seyfert 1sand 2 seyfert 2s in these samples but with black hole masses measured recentlyby reverberation mapping and stellar/gas dynamics, we studied the correlationsof black hole masses with radio loudness and bulge luminosities for a sample of37 seyfert galaxies. we found that if radio-loudness is measured using theoptical and radio luminosities of the nuclear components, the black hole massesof radio-loud seyfert 1s tend to increase with the radio-loudness. the blackhole masses of all seyfert galaxies increase with the radio power, but seyfertgalaxies have larger radio powers than nearby galaxies with the same black holemasses. in addition, the correlation between black hole masses and bulge v-bandluminosities for seyfert galaxies is consistent with that found for quasars andnormal galaxies. the combined sample of 37 seyfert galaxies, 15 quasars and 30normal galaxies suggests a possible universal nonlinear relation between blackhole and bulge masses, $m(bh) \propto m(bulge)^{1.74\pm0.14}$, which isslightly steeper than that found recently by laor (2001) for a smaller sample.this nonlinear relation is supported by a larger sample including 65 seyfertgalaxies. the different m(bh)/m(bulge) ratio for galaxies with different bulgeluminosities or different black hole masses may be explained by this relation.these results are consistent with some theoretical implications and areimportant for understanding the nature of radio emissions and the formation andevolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies.

astro-ph;0402170	the large-scale magnetic field structure of our galaxy: efficiently  deduced from pulsar rotation measures	in this review, i will first introduce possible methods to probe thelarge-scale magnetic fields in our galaxy and discuss their limitations. themagnetic fields in the galactic halo, mainly revealed by the sky distributionof rotation measures of extragalactic radio sources, probably have a globalstructure of a twisted dipole field. the large-scale field structure in thegalactic disk has been most efficiently deduced from pulsar rotation measures(rms). there has been a lot of progress since the 1980s when the magnetic fieldin the local area of our galaxy was first traced by a very small sample oflocal pulsars. now we have pulsars distributed in about one third of the wholegalactic disk of the interstellar medium, which shows that the large-scalemagnetic fields go along the spiral arms and that the field directions reversefrom arm to arm. the rms of newly discovered pulsars in the very inner galaxyhave been used to show the coherent magnetic field in the norma arm. themagnetic fields in the galactic disk most probably have a bisymmetric spiralstructure.

astro-ph;0402180	structure function studies for turbulent interstellar medium	we study structure functions of rotation measures in the canadian galacticplane survey (cgps) region and the north galactic pole (ngp) to extract theinterstellar medium (ism) fluctuation information. the cgps data are dividedinto three longitude intervals: $82^\circ&lt;l&lt;96^\circ$ (cgps1),$115^\circ&lt;l&lt;130^\circ$ (cgps2) and $130^\circ&lt;l&lt;146^\circ$ (cgps3). thestructure functions of all three regions have large uncertainties when theangular separation is smaller than $\delta\theta\approx 1^\circ$. a power lawcan fit the structure function well for $\delta\theta&gt;1^\circ$. the power lawindices get smaller from cgps1 to cgps3 and the amplitudes decrease. thevariations of the large-scale field and the electron density have onlynegligible effects on the structure function and thus cannot account for thechanges, indicating that the turbulent properties of the galactic ism areintrinsically longitude-dependent. the kolmogorov-like fluctuation spectrum ofthe electron density or the magnetic field should produce a power law structurefunction with an index of 5/3 or 2/3, neither of which is consistent with ourresults of small indices in the three sub-cgps regions. for the ngp region, thestructure function is flat, showing that the rotation measures are mostlyintrinsic to the extragalactic sources, and the ism is very random in that partof our galaxy. it is obvious that the ism fluctuation is latitude-dependentwhen comparing the results in the ngp region and the cgps regions.

astro-ph;0402282	pulsar motions in our galaxy	pulsar motions in our galaxy from their birth until 2 gyr are studiedstatistically via monte-carlo simulation of $2\times 10^5$ pulsars with thebest available representation of the galactic potential. we find that thedistribution of height above the galactic plane for pulsars with characteristicages less than about 8 myr could be well fitted by a gaussian function. forolder pulsars, an extra exponential function is necessary to fit thedistribution. the scale-height of the gaussian component increases linearlywith time until about 40 myr. the height distribution becomes stabilized afterabout 200 myr. these results are not sensitive to initial height or radialdistributions. taking the relationship between the initial velocity and heightdistribution, we found from the latest pulsar catalog that the heightdistribution of pulsars younger than 1 myr directly implies the mean initialvelocity of $280\pm96$ km s$^{-1}$. comparison of simulated sample of pulsarswith the current available millisecond pulsars shows that their 1d initialvelocity dispersion should be most probably $60\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$.

astro-ph;0403243	black hole mass estimation with a relation between the blr size and  emission line luminosity of agn	an empirical relation between the broad line region (blr) size and opticalcontinuum luminosity is often adopted to estimate the blr size and then theblack hole mass of agns. however, optical luminosity may not be a goodindicator of photoionizing luminosity for extremely radio-loud agns because thejets usually contribute significantly to the optical continuum. therefore, theblack hole masses derived for blazar-type agns with this method are probablyoverestimated. here we first derived a tight empirical relation between the blrsize and the h$_\beta$ emission line luminosity, $r(\rm{light-days})=24.05(l_{h_\beta}/10^{42} ergs s^{-1})^{0.68}$, from a sample of 34 agns withthe blr size estimated with the reverberation mapping technique. then weapplied this relation to estimate the black hole masses of some agns and foundthat for many extremely radio-loud agns the black hole masses obtained with the$r-l_{h_\beta}$ relation are systematically lower than those derived previouslywith the $r-l_{5100\aa}$ relation, while for radio-quiet and slightlyradio-loud agns the results obtained with these two methods are almost thesame. the difference of black hole masses estimated with these two relationsincreases with the radio-loudness for extremely radio-loud agns, which isconsistent with the fact that their equivalent widths of h$_{\beta}$ emissionline become smaller at higher radio-loudness. if the small h$_{\beta}$equivalent widths of extremely radio-loud agns are indeed caused by the beamingeffect, we argue that the optical emission line luminosity may be a bettertracer of ionizing luminosity for blazar-type agns and the black hole massderived with the $r-l_{h_\beta}$ relation are probably more accurate.

astro-ph;0403398	the inner annular gap for pulsar radiation: gamma-ray and radio emission	the inner annular gap (iag), a new type of inner gap whose magnetic fieldlines intersect the null charge surface (ncs), is proposed to explain$\gamma$-ray and radio emission from pulsars. the iag can be an importantsource for high-energy particles. the particles can radiate between the ncs andthe iag. some observational characteristics in both $\gamma$-ray and radiobands, such as the $\gamma$-ray emission beams of crab-like, vela-like andgeminga-like, can be reproduced by numerical method. it is predicted that theview angle $\zeta$ should be larger than the inclination angle($\zeta&gt;\alpha$), otherwise the $\gamma$-ray radiation will have littlepossibility to be observed. whether the inner annular gap (or cap) is sparking(or free flow) depends on the surface binding energy of the pulsar. in stead ofneutron star models, the scenario of the iag is favorable for bare strange starmodels, because bare strange stars can easily satisfy the requisite conditionto form an iag for both pulsars ($\vec{\omega}\cdot \vec{b}&lt;0$) andanti-pulsars ($\vec\omega \cdot \vec{b}&gt;0$).

0704.0871	the idv source j1128+5925, a new candidate for annual modulation?	short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio sources,known as intraday variability, can be explained in at least some sources by asource-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted asscintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ism of the milky way. oneof the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-inducedvariability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristicvariability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the earth. datafor the recently discovered and highly variable idv source j1128+5925 arepresented. we study the frequency and time dependence of the idv in thiscompact quasar. we measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the idvthroughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in thevariability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. we monitored theflux density variability of j1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and10.45ghz with the 100m effelsberg radio telescope of the mpifr and with the 25murumqi radio telescope. from ten observing sessions, we determine thevariability characteristics and time-scales. the observed pronounced changes ofthe variability time-scale of j1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropicannual modulation model. the observed frequency dependence of the variation isin good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. adoptinga simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequencydependence of the idv, we derive a lower limit to the distance of thescattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. thelatter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from vlbi.

astro-ph;0605149	the non-constant slope of the civ baldwin effect in ngc 4151	the relationship between the emission-line equivalent width and the continuumluminosity, so called the baldwin effect, plays an important role in studyingthe physics of the broad line region of agns. using the archived ultravioletspectra obtained by iue, hst, and hut in 1978-2002, we investigated theintrinsic civ baldwin effect of a well-studied seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4151. bothits continuum flux and civ emission-line flux varied about two orders ofmagnitude in more than two decades, making it one of the best targets forstudying the slope variation of the baldwin effect. we fitted the civ lineprofile of the 490 archived uv spectra of ngc 4151 with the same modelconsisting of a few gaussian components, and derived the slope in the log-logplot for the total flux of civ emission line against the uv continuum flux indifferent observation epochs.we found that the slope is not constant for ngc4151, as it varies from 0.58 in the highest flux epoch to 0.83 in the lowestflux epoch. the slope evidently decreases as the continuum flux increases,which reinforces the previous findings of the non-constant slope in the h_betabaldwin effect of ngc 5548 and the civ baldwin effect of fairall 9. our resultsuggests that such a non-constant slope may not be unusual for agns. itsphysical origin is probably related to the different non-linear responses ofthe emission line to the variable ionizing continuum caused by the differentaccretion modes at different luminosity levels. we briefly discuss the effectsof various absorption components in the civ line profile of ngc 4151 and arguethat the slope variation is not driven mainly by the absorption effect.intensive, long-term and high resolution spectral observations of stronglyvariable agns are needed in the future to confirm our result.

0810.5200	mergers of luminous early-type galaxies in the local universe and  gravitational wave background	supermassive black hole (smbh) coalescence in galaxy mergers is believed tobe one of the primary sources of very low frequency gravitational waves (gws).significant contribution of the gws comes from mergers of massive galaxies withredshifts z&lt;2. very few previous studies gave the merger rate of massivegalaxies. % we selected a large sample (1209) of close pairs of galaxies withprojected separations 7&lt;r_p&lt;50 kpc from 87,889 luminous early-type galaxies(m_r&lt;-21.5) from the sloan digital sky survey data release 6. these pairsconstitute a complete volume-limited sample in the local universe (z&lt;0.12).using our newly developed technique, 249 mergers have been identified bysearching for interaction features. from them, we found that the mergerfraction of luminous early-type galaxies is 0.8%, and the merger rate in thelocal universe is % r_g=(1.0+/-0.4)*10^{-5} mpc^{-3} gyr^{-1}} % with anuncertainty mainly depending on the merging timescale. % we estimated themasses of smbhs in the centers of merging galaxies based on their luminosities.we found that the chirp mass distribution of the smbh binaries follows a powerlaw with an index of -3.0+/-0.5 in the range 5*10^8--5*10^{9} m_{\odot}. %using the smbh population in the mergers and assuming that the smbhs can beefficiently driven into the gw regime, we investigated the stochastic gwbackground in the frequency range 10^{-9}--10^{-7} hz. we obtained the spectrumof the gw background of h_c(f)=10^{-15}(f/yr^{-1})^{-2/3}, which is onemagnitude higher than that obtained by jaffe &amp; backer in 2003, but consistentwith those calculated from galaxy-formation models.
