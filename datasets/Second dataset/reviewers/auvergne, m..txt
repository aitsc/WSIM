0901.2206	the corot satellite in flight : description and performance	corot is a space telescope dedicated to stellar seismology and the search forextrasolar planets. the mission is led by cnes in association with frenchlaboratories and has a large international participation: the european spaceagency (esa), austria, belgium and germany contribute to the payload, and spainand brazil contribute to the ground segment. development of the spacecraft,which is based on a proteus low earth orbit recurrent platform, commenced inoctober 2000 and the satellite was launched on december 27th 2006.  the instrument and platform characteristics prior to launch have beendescribed in esa publication (sp-1306) . in the present paper we detail thebehaviour in flight, based on raw and corrected data. five runs have beencompleted since january 2007. the data used here are essentially those acquiredduring the commissioning phase and from a long run which lasted 146 days, theseenable us to give a complete overview of the instrument and platform behaviourfor all environmental conditions. the ground based data processing is notdescribed in detail, the most important method being published elsewhere. it isshown that the performance specifications are easily satisfied when theenvironmental conditions are favourable. most of the perturbations, andconsequently data corrections, are related to low earth orbit (leo)perturbations: high energy particles inside the south atlantic anomaly (saa),eclipses and temperature variations, and line of sight fluctuations due to theattitude control system. straylight due to the reflected light from the earth,which is controlled by the telescope and baffle design, appears to benegligible.

0901.4618	photospheric activity and rotation of the planet-hosting star  corot-exo-4a	the space experiment corot has recently detected a transiting hot jupiter inorbit around a moderately active f-type main-sequence star (corot-exo-4a). thisplanetary system is of particular interest because it has an orbital period of9.202 days, the second longest one among the transiting planets known to date.we study the surface rotation and the activity of the host star during anuninterrupted sequence of optical observations of 58 days. our approach isbased on a maximum entropy spot modelling technique extensively tested bymodelling the variation of the total solar irradiance. it assumes that stellaractive regions consist of cool spots and bright faculae, analogous to sunspotsand solar photospheric faculae, whose visibility is modulated by stellarrotation. the modelling of the light curve of corot-exo-4a reveals three mainactive longitudes with lifetimes between about 30 and 60 days that rotatequasi-synchronously with the orbital motion of the planet. the differentrotation rates of the active longitudes are interpreted in terms of surfacedifferential rotation and a lower limit of 0.057 \pm 0.015 is derived for itsrelative amplitude. the enhancement of activity observed close to thesubplanetary longitude suggests a magnetic star-planet interaction, althoughthe short duration of the time series prevents us from drawing definiteconclusions.

0903.1829	noise properties of the corot data: a planet-finding perspective	in this short paper, we study the photometric precision of stellar lightcurves obtained by the corot satellite in its planet finding channel, with aparticular emphasis on the timescales characteristic of planetary transits.together with other articles in the same issue of this journal, it forms anattempt to provide the building blocks for a statistical interpretation of thecorot planet and eclipsing binary catch to date.  after pre-processing the light curves so as to minimise long-term variationsand outliers, we measure the scatter of the light curves in the first threecorot runs lasting more than 1 month, using an iterative non-linear filter toisolate signal on the timescales of interest. the bevhaiour of the noise on 2htimescales is well-described a power-law with index 0.25 in r-magnitude,ranging from 0.1mmag at r=11.5 to 1mmag at r=16, which is close to thepre-launch specification, though still a factor 2-3 above the photon noise dueto residual jitter noise and hot pixel events. there is evidence for a slightdegradation of the performance over time. we find clear evidence for enhancedvariability on hours timescales (at the level of 0.5 mmag) in stars identifiedas likely giants from their r-magnitude and b-v colour, which representapproximately 60 and 20% of the observed population in the direction of aquilaand monoceros respectively. on the other hand, median correlated noise levelsover 2h for dwarf stars are extremely low, reaching 0.05mmag at the bright end.

0905.3340	looking for pulsations in hgmn stars through corot lightcurves	hgmn chemically peculiar stars are among the quietest stars of themain-sequence. however, according to theoretical predictions, these stars couldhave pulsations related to the very strong overabundances of iron peakelements, which are produced by atomic diffusion in upper layers. suchpulsations have never been detected from ground based observations.  our aim is to search for signatures of pulsations in hgmn stars using thehigh quality lightcurves provided by the corot satellite.  we identified three faint stars (v&gt;12), from vlt-giraffe multiobjectspectrograph survey in a field which was planned for observation by corot. theypresent the typical characteristics of hgmn stars. they were observed by thecorot satellite during the long run (131 days) which started from the 24th ofoctober 2007, with the exoplanets ccd's (additional programme). in the presentwork, we present the analysis of the ground based spectra of these three starsand the analysis of the corresponding corot lightcurves.  two of these three hgmn candidates show low amplitude (less than 1.6 mmag)periodic variations (4.3 and 2.53 days respectively, with harmonics) which arecompatible with periods predicted by theoretical models.

1010.4959	plaskett's star: analysis of the corot photometric data	the sra02 of the corot space mission for asteroseismology was partly devotedto stars belonging to the mon ob2 association. an intense monitoring wasperformed on plaskett's star (hd47129) and the unprecedented quality of thelight curve allows us to shed new light on this very massive, non-eclipsingbinary system. we particularly aimed at detecting periodic variability whichmight be associated with pulsations or interactions between both components. wealso searched for variations related to the orbital cycle which could help toconstrain the inclination and the morphology of the binary system. afourier-based prewhitening and a multiperiodic fitting procedure were appliedto analyse the time series and extract the frequencies of variations. wedescribe the noise properties to tentatively define an appropriate significancecriterion, to only point out the peaks at a certain significance level. we alsodetect the variations related to the orbital motion and study them by using thenightfall program. the periodogram exhibits a majority of peaks at lowfrequencies. among these peaks, we highlight a list of about 43 values,including notably two different sets of harmonic frequencies whose fundamentalpeaks are located at about 0.07 and 0.82d-1. the former represents the orbitalfrequency of the binary system whilst the latter could probably be associatedwith non-radial pulsations. the study of the 0.07d-1 variations reveals thepresence of a hot spot most probably situated on the primary star and facingthe secondary. the investigation of this unique dataset constitutes a furtherstep in the understanding of plaskett's star. these results provide a firstbasis for future seismic modelling. the existence of a hot region between bothcomponents renders the determination of the inclination ambiguous.

1011.2690	possible detection of phase changes from the non-transiting planet hd  46375b by corot	the present work deals with the detection of phase changes in an exoplanetarysystem. hd 46375 is a solar analog known to host a non-transiting saturn-massexoplanet with a 3.0236 day period. it was observed by the corot satellite for34 days during the fall of 2008. we attempt to identify at optical wavelengths,the changing phases of the planet as it orbits its star. we then try to improvethe star model by means of a seismic analysis of the same light curve and theuse of ground-based spectropolarimetric observations. the data analysis relieson the fourier spectrum and the folding of the time series. we find evidence ofa sinusoidal signal compatible in terms of both amplitude and phase with lightreflected by the planet. its relative amplitude is delta fp/f* = [13.0, 26.8]ppm, implying an albedo a=[0.16, 0.33] or a dayside visible brightnesstemperature tb ~ [1880,2030] k by assuming a radius r=1.1 r_jup and aninclination i=45 deg. its orbital phase differs from that of theradial-velocity signal by at most 2 sigma_rv. however, the tiny planetarysignal is strongly blended by another signal, which we attribute to a telluricsignal with a 1 day period. we show that this signal is suppressed, but noteliminated, when using the time series for hd 46179 from the same corot run asa reference. this detection of reflected light from a non-transiting planetshould be confirmable with a longer corot observation of the same field. in anycase, it demonstrates that non-transiting planets can be characterized usingultra-precise photometric lightcurves with present-day observations by corotand kepler. the combined detection of solar-type oscillations on the sametargets (gaulme et al. 2010a) highlights the overlap between exoplanetaryscience and asteroseismology and shows the high potential of a mission such asplato.

1105.6113	mixed modes in red-giant stars observed with corot	the corot mission has provided thousands of red-giant light curves. theanalysis of their solar-like oscillations allows us to characterize theirstellar properties. up to now, the global seismic parameters of the pressuremodes remain unable to distinguish red-clump giants from members of thered-giant branch. as recently done with kepler red giants, we intend to analyzeand use the so-called mixed modes to determine the evolutionary status of thered giants observed with corot. we also aim at deriving different seismiccharacteristics depending on evolution. the complete identification of thepressure eigenmodes provided by the red-giant universal oscillation patternallows us to aim at the mixed modes surrounding the l=1 expectedeigenfrequencies. a dedicated method based on the envelope autocorrelationfunction is proposed to analyze their period separation. we have identified themixed-mode signature separation thanks to their pattern compatible with theasymptotic law of gravity modes. we have shown that, independent of anymodelling, the g-mode spacings help to distinguish the evolutionary status of ared-giant star. we then report different seismic and fundamental properties ofthe stars, depending on their evolutionary status. in particular, we show thathigh-mass stars of the secondary clump present very specific seismicproperties. we emphasize that stars belonging to the clump were affected bysignificant mass loss. we also note significant population and/or evolutiondifferences in the different fields observed by corot.

1302.3369	regular frequency patterns in the young delta scuti star hd 261711  observed by the corot and most satellites	we concentrate on an asteroseismological study of hd 261711, a rather hotdelta scuti type pulsating member of the young open cluster ngc 2264 located atthe blue border of the instability region. hd 261711 was discovered to be apre-main sequence delta scuti star using the time series photometry obtained bythe most satellite in 2006. high-precision, time-series photometry of hd 261711was obtained by the most and corot satellites in 4 separate new observing runsthat are put into context with the star's fundamental atmospheric parametersobtained from spectroscopy. with the new most data set from 2011/12 and the twocorot light curves from 2008 and 2011/12, the delta scuti variability wasconfirmed and regular groups of frequencies were discovered. the two pulsationfrequencies identified in the data from the first most observing run in 2006are confirmed and 23 new delta scuti-type frequencies were discovered using thecorot data. weighted average frequencies for each group are related to l=0 andl=1 p-modes. evidence for amplitude modulation of the frequencies in two groupsis seen. the effective temperature was derived to be 8600$\pm$200 k, log g is4.1$\pm$0.2, and the projected rotational velocity is 53$\pm$1km/s. using ourteff value and the radius of 1.8$\pm$0.5 rsun derived from sed fitting, we geta log l/lsun of 1.20$\pm$0.14 which agrees well to the seismologicallydetermined values of 1.65 rsun and, hence, a log l/lsun of 1.13. the radialvelocity of 14$\pm$2 km/s we derived for hd 261711, confirms the star'smembership to ngc 2264. our asteroseismic models suggest that hd 261711 is adelta scuti-type star close to the zero-age main sequence (zams) with a mass of1.8 to 1.9msun. hd 261711 is either a young zams star or a late pms star justbefore the onset of hydrogen-core burning.

1307.2739	an in-depth study of hd 174966 with corot photometry and harps  spectroscopy. large separation as a new observable for \delta sct stars	the aim of this work was to use a multi-approach technique to derive the mostaccurate values possible of the physical parameters of the \delta sct starhd174966. in addition, we searched for a periodic pattern in the frequencyspectra with the goal of using it to determine the mean density of the star.first, we extracted the frequency content from the corot light curve. then, wederived the physical parameters of hd174966 and carried a mode identificationout from the spectroscopic and photometric observations. we used thisinformation to look for the models fulfilling all the conditions and discussedthe inaccuracies of the method because of the rotation effects. in a finalstep, we searched for patterns in the frequency set using a fourier transform,discussed its origin and studied the possibility of using the periodicity toobtain information about the physical parameters of the star. a total of 185peaks were obtained from the fourier analysis of the corot light curve, beingalmost all reliable pulsating frequencies. from the spectroscopic observations,18 oscillation modes were detected and identified, and the inclination angle($62.5^{\circ}$$^{+7.5}_{-17.5}$) and the rotational velocity of the star (142km/s) were estimated. from the multi-colour photometric observations, 3frequencies were detected, which correspond to the main ones in the corot lightcurve. we looked for periodicities within the 185 frequencies and found aperiodic pattern ~64 \mu hz. using the inclination angle, the rotationalvelocity and an echelle diagram, showing a double comb outside the asymptoticregime, we concluded that the periodicity corresponds to a large separationstructure. the periodic pattern allowed us to discriminate models from a grid,finding that the value of the mean density is achieved with a 6% uncertainty.so, the pattern could be used as a new observable for a-f type stars.

1308.3598	periodicity search as a tool for disentangling the contaminated colour  light curve of corot 102781750	the star corot102781750 reveals a puzzle, showing a very complex and alteringvariation in different `corot colours'. we established without doubt that morethan a single star was situated within the corot mask. using a search forperiodicity as a tool, our aim is to disentangle the composite light curve andidentify the type of sources behind the variability. both flux and magnitudelight curves were used. conversion was applied after a jump- andtrend-filtering algorithm. we applied different types of period-findingtechniques including mufran and period04. the amplitude and phase peculiaritiesobtained from the independent analysis of corot r, g, and b colours andground-based follow-up photometric observations ruled out the possibility ofeither a background monoperiodic or a blazhko type rr lyrae star being in themask. the main target, an active star, shows at least two spotted areas thatreveal a $p_rot = 8.8$ hours $(f_0 = 2.735$ c d$^{-1})$ mean rotation period.the evolution of the active regions helped to derive a period change of $dp/dt= 1.6\cdot 10^{-6}$ (18 s over the run) and a differential rotation of $\alpha= \delta\omega/\omega = 0.0074$. the $0\fm 015$ linear decrease and a local$0\fm 005$ increase in the dominant period's amplitude are interpreted as adecay of the old spotted region and an appearance of a new one, respectively. astar that is detected only in the corot b domain shows a $f_1 = 7.172$ cd$^{-1}$ pulsation connected to a $14\fd 83$ periodicity via an equidistanttriplet structure. the best explanation for our observation is a $\beta$ cepstar with a corotating dust disk.

1311.4370	a search for pulsations in the hgmn star hd 45975 with corot photometry  and ground-based spectroscopy	the existence of pulsations in hgmn stars is still being debated. to providethe first unambiguous observational detection of pulsations in this class ofchemically peculiar objects, the bright star hd 45975 was monitored for nearlytwo months by the corot satellite. independent analyses of the light curveprovides evidence of monoperiodic variations with a frequency of 0.7572 c/d anda peak-to-peak amplitude of ~2800 ppm. multisite, ground-based spectroscopicobservations overlapping the corot observations show the star to be along-period, single-lined binary. furthermore, with the notable exception ofmercury, they reveal the same periodicity as in photometry in the line momentsof chemical species exhibiting strong overabundances (e.g., mn and y). incontrast, lines of other elements do not show significant variations. as foundin other hgmn stars, the pattern of variability consists in an absorption bumpmoving redwards across the line profiles. we argue that the photometric andspectroscopic changes are more consistent with an interpretation in terms ofrotational modulation of spots at the stellar surface. in this framework, theexistence of pulsations producing photometric variations above the ~50 ppmlevel is unlikely in hd 45975. this provides strong constraints on theexcitation/damping of pulsation modes in this hgmn star.
