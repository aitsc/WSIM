1005.0740	magic constraints on gamma-ray emission from cygnus x-3	cygnus x-3 is a microquasar consisting of an accreting compact objectorbiting around a wolf-rayet star. it has been detected at radio frequenciesand up to high-energy gamma rays (above 100 mev). however, many models alsopredict a very high energy (vhe) emission (above hundreds of gev) when thesource displays relativistic persistent jets or transient ejections. therefore,detecting such emission would improve the understanding of the jet physics. theimaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope magic observed cygnus x-3 for about 70hours between 2006 march and 2009 august in different x-ray/radio spectralstates and also during a period of enhanced gamma-ray emission. magic found noevidence for a vhe signal from the direction of the microquasar. an upper limitto the integral flux for energies higher than 250 gev has been set to 2.2 x10-12 photons cm-2 s-1 (95% confidence level). this is the best limit so far tothe vhe emission from this source. the non-detection of a vhe signal during theperiod of activity in the high-energy band sheds light on the location of thepossible vhe radiation favoring the emission from the innermost region of thejets, where absorption is significant. the current and future generations ofcherenkov telescopes may detect a signal under precise spectral conditions.

1012.3191	first season quiet observations: measurements of cmb polarization power  spectra at 43 ghz in the multipole range 25 &lt;= ell &lt;= 475	the q/u imaging experiment (quiet) employs coherent receivers at 43ghz and95ghz, operating on the chajnantor plateau in the atacama desert in chile, tomeasure the anisotropy in the polarization of the cmb. quiet primarily targetsthe b modes from primordial gravitational waves. the combination of thesefrequencies gives sensitivity to foreground contributions from diffuse galacticsynchrotron radiation. between 2008 october and 2010 december, &gt;10,000hours ofdata were collected, first with the 19-element 43ghz array (3458hours) and thenwith the 90-element 95ghz array. each array observes the same four fields,selected for low foregrounds, together covering ~1000deg^2. this paper reportsinitial results from the 43ghz receiver which has an array sensitivity to cmbfluctuations of 69uk sqrt(s). the data were extensively studied with a largesuite of null tests before the power spectra, determined with two independentpipelines, were examined. analysis choices, including data selection, weremodified until the null tests passed. cross correlating maps with differenttelescope pointings is used to eliminate a bias. this paper reports the ee, bband eb power spectra in the multipole range ell=25-475. with the exception ofthe lowest multipole bin for one of the fields, where a polarized foreground,consistent with galactic synchrotron radiation, is detected with 3sigmasignificance, the e-mode spectrum is consistent with the lcdm model, confirmingthe only previous detection of the first acoustic peak. the b-mode spectrum isconsistent with zero, leading to a measurement of the tensor-to-scalar ratio ofr=0.35+1.06-0.87. the combination of a new time-stream double-demodulationtechnique, mizuguchi-dragone optics, natural sky rotation, and frequentboresight rotation leads to the lowest level of systematic contamination in theb-mode power so far reported, below the level of r=0.1

1201.3356	a giant radio flare from cygnus x-3 with associated gamma-ray emission	with frequent flaring activity of its relativistic jets, cygnus x-3 is one ofthe most active microquasars and is the only galactic black hole candidate withconfirmed high energy gamma-ray emission, thanks to detections by fermi/lat andagile. in 2011, cygnus x-3 was observed to transit to a soft x-ray state, whichis known to be associated with high-energy gamma-ray emission. we present theresults of a multi-wavelength campaign covering a quenched state, when radioemission from cygnus x-3 is at its weakest and the x-ray spectrum is very soft.a giant (~ 20 jy) optically thin radio flare marks the end of the quenchedstate, accompanied by rising non-thermal hard x-rays. fermi/lat observations (e&gt;100 mev) reveal renewed gamma-ray activity associated with this giant radioflare, suggesting a common origin for all non-thermal components. in addition,current observations unambiguously show that the gamma-ray emission is notexclusively related to the rare giant radio flares. a 3-week period ofgamma-ray emission is also detected when cygnus x-3 was weakly flaring inradio, right before transition to the radio quenched state. no gamma rays areobserved during the ~ one-month long quenched state, when the radio flux isweakest. our results suggest transitions into and out of the ultrasoft x-ray(radio quenched) state trigger gamma-ray emission, implying a connection to theaccretion process, and also that the gamma-ray activity is related to the levelof radio flux (and possibly shock formation), strengthening the connection tothe relativistic jets.

1204.0790	assessing the significance of apparent correlations between radio and  gamma-ray blazar fluxes	whether a correlation exists between the radio and gamma-ray flux densitiesof blazars is a long-standing question, and one that is difficult to answerconfidently because of various observational biases which may either dilute orapparently enhance any intrinsic correlation between radio and gamma-rayluminosities. we introduce a novel method of data randomization to evaluatequantitatively the effect of these biases and to assess the intrinsicsignificance of an apparent correlation between radio and gamma-ray fluxdensities of blazars. the novelty of the method lies in a combination of datarandomization in luminosity space (to ensure that the randomized data areintrinsically, and not just apparently, uncorrelated) and significanceassessment in flux space (to explicitly avoid malmquist bias and automaticallyaccount for the limited dynamical range in both frequencies). the method isapplicable even to small samples that are not selected with strict statisticalcriteria. for larger samples we describe a variation of the method in which thesample is split in redshift bins, and the randomization is applied in each binindividually; this variation is designed to yield the equivalent toluminosity-function sampling of the underlying population in the limit of verylarge, statistically complete samples. we show that for a smaller number ofredshift bins, the method yields a worse significance, and in this way it isconservative in that it does not assign a stronger, artificially enhancedsignificance. we demonstrate how our test performs as a function of number ofsources, strength of correlation, and number of redshift bins used, and we showthat while our test is robust against common-distance biases and associatedfalse positives for uncorrelated data, it retains the power of other methods inrejecting the null hypothesis of no correlation for correlated data.

1301.7087	radio to gamma-ray variability study of blazar s5 0716+714	we present the results of a series of radio, optical, x-ray and gamma-rayobservations of the bl lac object s50716+714 carried out between april 2007 andjanuary 2011. the multi-frequency observations were obtained using severalground and space based facilities. the intense optical monitoring of the sourcereveals faster repetitive variations superimposed on a long-term variabilitytrend at a time scale of ~350 days. episodes of fast variability recur on timescales of ~ 60-70 days. the intense and simultaneous activity at optical andgamma-ray frequencies favors the ssc mechanism for the production of thehigh-energy emission. two major low-peaking radio flares were observed duringthis high optical/gamma-ray activity period. the radio flares are characterizedby a rising and a decaying stage and are in agreement with the formation of ashock and its evolution. we found that the evolution of the radio flaresrequires a geometrical variation in addition to intrinsic variations of thesource. different estimates yield a robust and self-consistent lower limits of\delta &gt; 20 and equipartition magnetic field b_eq &gt; 0.36 g. causality argumentsconstrain the size of emission region \theta &lt; 0.004 mas. we found asignificant correlation between flux variations at radio frequencies with thoseat optical and gamma-rays. the optical/gev flux variations lead the radiovariability by ~65 days. the longer time delays between low-peaking radiooutbursts and optical flares imply that optical flares are the precursors ofradio ones. an orphan x-ray flare challenges the simple, one-zone emissionmodels, rendering them too simple. here we also describe the spectral energydistribution modeling of the source from simultaneous data taken throughdifferent activity periods.

1303.2131	ovro 40 m blazar monitoring program: location of the gamma-ray emission  region in blazars by the study of correlated variability at radio and  gamma-rays	blazars are powerful, variable emitters from radio to gamma-ray wavelengths.even though the general picture of synchrotron emission at low energies andinverse compton at the high energy end is well established, many importantaspects of these remarkable objects are still not well understood. for example,even the location of the gamma-ray emission region is still not clearlyestablished, with some theories locating it close to the black hole/accretiondisk while others place it at parsec scales in the radio jet. since mid-2007 wehave carried out a large scale monitoring program at 15 ghz using the ovro 40 mtelescope. we are currently observing about 1700 blazars twice per week. thesample includes all the fermi-lat detected blazars north of declination -20degrees. here, we study the existence of correlated variability between thesetwo bands for 86 sources bright enough to be detected weekly by lat. theexistence of correlated variability can be interpreted as an indication of arelated spatial locations for the radio and gamma-ray emission, making theevaluation of its statistical significance a key goal of our program. a studyof the statistical significance of these cross-correlations is presented alongwith a discussion of the monte carlo simulations used to evaluate them. moreinformation about the conditions on the radio emission zone can be obtainedthrough polarization monitoring which tells us about the configuration of themagnetic fields in this region. to study radio polarization variability we arebuilding kupol, a radio polarization receiver for the 12 to 18 ghz band thatwill replace the current total power receiver at the ovro 40 meter telescope.

1305.0572	the ordinary life of the gamma-ray emitting narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy  pks 1502+036	we report on multifrequency observations of the gamma-ray emittingnarrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy pks 1502+036 performed from radio to gamma-raysduring 2008 august-2012 november by fermi-lat, swift (xrt and uvot), ovro,vlba, and vla. no significant variability has been observed in gamma-rays, with0.1-100 gev flux that ranged between (3-7)x10^-8 ph/cm^2/s using 3-month timebins. the photon index of the lat spectrum (gamma=2.60+/-0.06) and the apparentisotropic gamma-ray luminosity, l(0.1-100 gev)= 7.8x10^45 erg/s, over 51 monthsare typical of a flat spectrum radio quasar. the radio spectral variability andthe one-sided structure, in addition to the observed gamma-ray luminosity,suggest a relativistic jet with a high doppler factor. in contrast to sbs0846+513, the vlba at 15 ghz did not observe superluminal motion for pks1502+036. despite having the optical characteristics typical of a narrow-lineseyfert 1 galaxy, radio and gamma-ray properties of pks 1502+036 are found tobe similar to those of a blazar at the low end of the black hole massdistribution for blazars. this is in agreement with what has been found in thecase of the other gamma-ray emitting narrow-line seyfert 1 sbs 0846+513.

1305.6005	vlba observations of a rare multiple quasar imaging event caused by  refraction in the interstellar medium	we report on the first detection of the theoretically-predicted rarephenomenon of multiple parsec-scale imaging of an active galactic nucleusinduced by refractive effects due to localized foreground electron densityenhancements, e.g., in an au-scale plasma lens(es) in the ionized component ofthe galactic interstellar medium. we detected multiple imaging in the lowgalactic latitude (b=-2 deg) quasar 2023+335 from the 15.4 ghz mojaveobservations when the source was undergoing an ese. while the parsec-scale jetof the source normally extends along pa -20 deg, in the 28 may 2009 and 23 july2009 images a highly significant multi-component pattern of secondary images isstretched out nearly along the constant galactic latitude line with a local pa40 deg, indicating that the direction of relative motion of the plasma lens isclose to orbital. weaker but still detectable imaging patterns at similarposition angles are sporadically manifest at several other epochs. modeling theese that occurred in early 2009 and lasted ~0.14 yr, we determined that theforeground screen has a double-lens structure, with proper motion (~6.8mas/yr), and angular size (~0.27 mas). we also found that the angularseparation between the two brightest sub-images roughly follows awavelength-squared dependence expected from plasma scattering. furthermore, byanalyzing archival non-simultaneous vlba observations covering a wide frequencyrange from 1.4 to 86 ghz, we found that the scattered angular size of the vlbicore follows a $\nu^{-1.89}$ dependence, implying the presence of a turbulent,refractive dominated scattering screen that has a confined structure or istruncated transverse to the line of sight toward 2023+335.

1308.3709	multifrequency studies of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy sbs 0846+513	the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy sbs 0846+513 was first detected by the largearea telescope (lat) on-board fermi in 2011 june-july when it underwent aperiod of flaring activity. since then, as fermi continues to accumulate dataon this source, its flux has been monitored on a daily basis. two furthergamma-ray flaring episodes from sbs 0846+513 were observed in 2012 may andaugust, reaching a daily peak flux integrated above 100 mev of (50+/-12)x10^-8ph/cm^2/s, and (73+/-14)x10^-8 ph/cm^2/s on may 24 and august 7, respectively.three outbursts were detected at 15 ghz by the owens valley radio observatory40-m telescope in 2012 may, 2012 october, and 2013 january, suggesting acomplex connection with the gamma-ray activity. the most likely scenariosuggests that the 2012 may gamma-ray flare may not be directly related to theradio activity observed over the same period, while the two gamma-ray flaringepisodes may be related to the radio activity observed at 15 ghz in 2012october and 2013 january. the gamma-ray flare in 2012 may triggered swiftobservations that confirmed that sbs 0846+513 was also exhibiting high activityin the optical, uv and x-ray bands, thus providing a firm identificationbetween the gamma-ray source and the lower-energy counterpart. we compared thespectral energy distribution (sed) of the flaring state in 2012 may with thatof a quiescent state. the two seds, modelled as an external compton componentof seed photons from a dust torus, could be fitted by changing the electrondistribution parameters as well as the magnetic field. no significant evidenceof thermal emission from the accretion disc has been observed. interestingly,in the 5 ghz radio luminosity vs. synchrotron peak frequency plot sbs 0846+513seems to lie in the flat spectrum radio quasar part of the so-called `blazarsequence'.

1310.0006	the cosmic evolution of fermi bl lacertae objects	fermi has provided the largest sample of gamma-ray selected blazars to date.in this work we use a uniformly selected set of 211 bl lacertae (bl lac)objects detected by it fermi during its first year of operation. we haveobtained redshift constraints for 206 out of the 211 bl lacs in our samplemaking it the largest and most complete sample of bl lacs available in theliterature. we use this sample to determine the luminosity function of bl lacsand its evolution with cosmic time. we find that for most bl lac classes, theevolution is positive with a space density peaking at modest redshift (z~1.2).the low-luminosity, high-synchrotron peaked (hsp) bl lacs are an exception,showing strong negative evolution, with number density increasing forz$\lesssim$0.5. since this rise corresponds to a drop-off in the density offlat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs), a possible interpretation is that thesehsps represent an accretion-starved end-state of an earlier merger-drivengas-rich phase. we additionally find that the known bl lac correlation betweenluminosity and photon spectral index persists after correction for thesubstantial observational selection effects with implications for the so called`blazar sequence'. finally, estimating the beaming corrections to theluminosity function, we find that bl lacs have an average lorentz factor of$\gamma=6.1^{+1.1}_{-0.8}$, and that most are seen within 10$^{\circ}$ of thejet axis.

1311.3304	the robopol optical polarization survey of gamma-ray - loud blazars	we present first results from robopol, a novel-design optical polarimeteroperating at the skinakas observatory in crete. the data, taken during the may- june 2013 commissioning of the instrument, constitute a single-epoch linearpolarization survey of a sample of gamma-ray - loud blazars, defined accordingto unbiased and objective selection criteria, easily reproducible insimulations, as well as a comparison sample of, otherwise similar, gamma-ray -quiet blazars. as such, the results of this survey are appropriate for bothphenomenological population studies and for tests of theoretical populationmodels. we have measured polarization fractions as low as $0.015$ down to $r$magnitude of 17 and as low as $0.035$ down to 18 magnitude. the hypothesis thatthe polarization fractions of gamma-ray - loud and gamma-ray - quiet blazarsare drawn from the same distribution is rejected at the $10^{-3}$ level. wetherefore conclude that gamma-ray - loud and gamma-ray - quiet sources havedifferent optical polarization properties. this is the first time thisstatistical difference is demonstrated in optical wavelengths. the polarizationfraction distributions of both samples are well-described by exponentialdistributions with averages of $\langle p \rangle =6.4 ^{+0.9}_{-0.8}\times10^{-2}$ for gamma-ray--loud blazars, and $\langle p \rangle =3.2^{+2.0}_{-1.1}\times 10^{-2}$ for gamma-ray--quiet blazars. the most probablevalue for the difference of the means is $3.4^{+1.5}_{-2.0}\times 10^{-2}$. thedistribution of polarization angles is statistically consistent with beinguniform.

1312.5522	multiwavelength observations of the gamma-ray emitting narrow-line  seyfert 1 pmn j0948+0022 in 2011	we report on radio-to-gamma-ray observations during 2011 may-september of pmnj0948+0022, the first narrow-line seyfert 1 (nlsy1) galaxy detected ingamma-rays by fermi-lat. strong variability was observed in gamma-rays, withtwo flaring periods peaking on 2011 june 20 and july 28. the variabilityobserved in optical and near-infrared seems to have no counterpart ingamma-rays. this different behaviour could be related to a bending andinhomogeneous jet or a turbulent extreme multi-cell scenario. the radio spectrashowed a variability pattern typical of relativistic jets.  the xmm spectrum shows that the emission from the jet dominates above 2 kev,while a soft x-ray excess is evident in the low-energy part of the x-rayspectrum. models where the soft emission is partly produced by blurredreflection or comptonisation of the thermal disc emission provide good fits tothe data. the x-ray spectral slope is similar to that found in radio-quietnlsy1, suggesting that a standard accretion disc is present, as expected fromthe high accretion rate. except for the soft x-ray excess, unusual injet-dominated agns, pmn j0948+0022 shows all characteristics of the blazarclass.

1401.0538	connection between optical and gamma-ray variability in blazars	we use optical data from the palomar transient factory (ptf) and the catalinareal-time transient survey (crts) to study the variability of gamma-raydetected and non-detected objects in a large population of active galacticnuclei (agn) selected from the candidate gamma-ray blazar survey and fermigamma-ray space telescope catalogs. our samples include 714 sources with ptfdata and 1244 sources with crts data. we calculate the intrinsic modulationindex to quantify the optical variability amplitude in these samples. we findthe gamma-ray detected objects to be more variable than the non-detected ones.the flat spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) are more variable than the bl lacobjects in our sample, but the significance of the difference depends on thesample used. when dividing the objects based on their synchrotron peakfrequency, we find the low synchrotron peaked (lsp) objects to be significantlymore variable than the high synchrotron peaked (hsp) ones, explaining thedifference between the fsrqs and bl lacs. this could be due to the lsps beingobserved near their electron energy peak, while in the hsps the emission iscaused by lower energy electrons, which cool more slowly. we also find asignificant correlation between the optical and gamma-ray fluxes that isstronger in the hsp bl lacs than in the fsrqs. the fsrqs in our sample are alsomore compton dominated than the hsp bl lacs. these findings are consistent withmodels where the gamma-ray emission of hsp objects is produced by thesynchrotron self-compton mechanism, while the lsp objects need an additionalexternal compton component that increases the scatter in the flux-fluxcorrelation.

1401.2151	two active states of the narrow-line gamma-ray-loud agn gb 1310+487	previously unremarkable, the extragalactic radio source gb 1310+487 showed agamma-ray flare on 2009 november 18, reaching a daily flux of ~10^-6photons/cm^2/s at energies e&gt;100 mev and becoming one of the brightest gevsources for about two weeks. its optical spectrum is not typical for a blazar,instead, it resembles those of narrow emission-line galaxies. we investigatechanges of the object's radio-to-gev spectral energy distribution (sed) duringand after the prominent gev flare with the aim to determine the nature of theobject and constrain the origin of the variable high-energy emission. the datacollected by the fermi and agile satellites at gamma-ray energies, swift atx-ray and ultraviolet, kanata, not, and keck telescopes at optical, oagh andwise at infrared, and iram 30m, ovro 40m, effelsberg 100m, ratan-600, and vlbaat radio, are analysed together to trace the sed evolution on timescales ofmonths. the gamma-ray/radio-loud narrow-line active galactic nucleus (agn) islocated at redshift z=0.638. it is shining through an unrelated foregroundgalaxy at z=0.500. the agn light is likely amplified by a factor of a fewbecause of gravitational lensing. the agn sed shows a two-humped structuretypical of blazars and gamma-ray-loud nlsy1 galaxies, with the high-energy(inverse-compton) emission dominating by more than an order of magnitude overthe low-energy (synchrotron) emission during gamma-ray flares. the differencebetween the two sed humps is smaller during the low-activity state. fermiobservations reveal a strong correlation between the gamma-ray flux andspectral index, with the hardest spectrum observed during the brightestgamma-ray state. if the gamma-ray flux is a mixture of synchrotron self-compton(ssc) and external compton (ec) emission, the observed gev spectral variabilitymay result from varying relative contributions of these two emissioncomponents.

1401.5646	magic gamma-ray and multifrequency observations of flat spectrum radio  quasar pks 1510-089 in early 2012	among more than fifty blazars detected in very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev)gamma-rays, only three belong to the subclass of flat spectrum radio quasars(fsrqs). magic observed fsrq pks 1510-089 in february-april 2012 during a highactivity state in the high energy (he, e&gt;100 mev) gamma-ray band observed byagile and fermi. magic observations result in the detection of a source withsignificance of 6.0 sigma. in agreement with the previous vhe observations ofthe source, we find no statistically significant variability during the magicobservations in daily, weekly or monthly time scales. the other two known vhefsrqs have shown daily scale to sub-hour variability.  we study the multifrequency behaviour of the source at the epoch of magicobservation, collecting quasi-simultaneous data at radio and optical (gasp-webtand f-gamma collaborations, rem, steward, perkins, liverpool, ovro and vlbatelescopes), x-ray (swift satellite) and he gamma-ray frequencies. thegamma-ray sed combining agile, fermi and magic data joins smoothly and shows nohint of a break. the multifrequency light curves suggest a common origin forthe millimeter radio and he gamma-ray emission and the he gamma-ray flaringstarts when the new component is ejected from the 43ghz vlba core. thequasi-simultaneous multifrequency sed is modelled with a one-zone inversecompton model. we study two different origins of the seed photons for theinverse compton scattering, namely the infra-red torus and a slow sheathsurrounding the jet around the vlba core. both models fit the data well.however, the fast he gamma-ray variability requires that within the modelledlarge emitting region, there must exist more compact regions. we suggest thatthese observed signatures would be most naturally explained by a turbulentplasma flowing at a relativistic speed down the jet and crossing a standingconical shock.

1403.4170	detection of significant cm to sub-mm band radio and gamma-ray  correlated variability in fermi bright blazars	the exact location of the gamma-ray emitting region in blazars is stillcontroversial. in order to attack this problem we present first results of across-correlation analysis between radio (11 cm to 0.8 mm wavelength, f-gammaprogram) and gamma-ray (0.1-300 gev) ~ 3.5 year light curves of 54 fermi-brightblazars. we perform a source stacking analysis and estimate significances andchance correlations using mixed source correlations. our results reveal: (i)the first highly significant multi-band radio and gamma-ray correlations (radiolagging gamma rays) when averaging over the whole sample, (ii) average timedelays (source frame: 76+/-23 to 7+/-9 days), systematically decreasing from cmto mm/sub-mm bands with a frequency dependence tau_r,gamma (nu) ~ nu^-1, ingood agreement with jet opacity dominated by synchrotron self-absorption, (iii)a bulk gamma-ray production region typically located within/upstream of the 3mm core region (tau_3mm,gamma=12+/-8 days), (iv) mean distances between theregion of gamma-ray peak emission and the radio "tau=1 photosphere" decreasingfrom 9.8+/-3.0 pc (11 cm) to 0.9+/-1.1 pc (2 mm) and 1.4+/-0.8 pc (0.8 mm), (v)3 mm/gamma-ray correlations in 9 individual sources at a significance levelwhere one is expected by chance (probability: 4 times 10^-6), (vi) opacity and"time lag core shift" estimates for quasar 3c 454.3 providing a lower limit forthe distance of the bulk gamma-ray production region from the supermassiveblack hole (smbh) of ~ 0.8-1.6 pc, i.e. at the outer edge of the broad lineregion (blr) or beyond. a 3 mm tau=1 surface at ~ 2-3 pc from the jet-base(i.e. well outside the "canonical blr") finally suggests that blr materialextends to several pc distances from the smbh.

1408.6264	time-correlation between the radio and gamma-ray activity in blazars and  the production site of the gamma-ray emission	in order to determine the location of the gamma-ray emission site in blazars,we investigate the time-domain relationship between their radio and gamma-rayemission. light-curves for the brightest detected blazars from the first 3years of the mission of the fermi gamma-ray space telescope arecross-correlated with 4 years of 15ghz observations from the ovro 40-mmonitoring program. the large sample and long light-curve duration enable us tocarry out a statistically robust analysis of the significance of thecross-correlations, which is investigated using monte carlo simulationsincluding the uneven sampling and noise properties of the light-curves.modeling the light-curves as red noise processes with power-law power spectraldensities, we find that only one of 41 sources with high quality data in bothbands shows correlations with significance larger than 3-sigma (ao 0235+164),with only two more larger than even 2.25-sigma (pks 1502+106 and b2 2308+34).additionally, we find correlated variability in mrk 421 when including a strongflare that occurred in july-september 2012. these results demonstrate veryclearly the difficulty of measuring statistically robust multiwavelengthcorrelations and the care needed when comparing light-curves even when manyyears of data are used. this should be a caution. in all four sources the radiovariations lag the gamma-ray variations, suggesting that the gamma-ray emissionoriginates upstream of the radio emission. continuous simultaneous monitoringover a longer time period is required to obtain high significance levels incross-correlations between gamma-ray and radio variability in most blazars.

1409.3389	first broadband characterization and redshift determination of the vhe  blazar magic j2001+439	we aim to characterize the broadband emission from 2fgl j2001.1+4352, whichhas been associated with the unknown-redshift blazar mg4 j200112+4352. based onits gamma-ray spectral properties, it was identified as a potential very highenergy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-ray emitter. the source was observed with magicfirst in 2009 and later in 2010 within a multi-instrument observation campaign.the magic observations yielded 14.8 hours of good quality stereoscopic data.the object was monitored at radio, optical and gamma-ray energies during theyears 2010 and 2011. the source, named magic j2001+439, is detected for thefirst time at vhe with magic at a statistical significance of 6.3 {\sigma} (e &gt;70 gev) during a 1.3-hour long observation on 2010 july 16. themulti-instrument observations show variability in all energy bands with thehighest amplitude of variability in the x-ray and vhe bands. we also organizeddeep imaging optical observations with the nordic optical telescope in 2013 todetermine the source redshift. we determine for the first time the redshift ofthis bl lac object through the measurement of its host galaxy during low blazaractivity. using the observational evidence that the luminosities of bl lac hostgalaxies are confined to a relatively narrow range, we obtain z = 0.18 +/-0.04. additionally, we use the fermi-lat and magic gamma-ray spectra to providean independent redshift estimation, z = 0.17 +/- 0.10. using the former (moreaccurate) redshift value, we adequately describe the broadband emission with aone-zone ssc model for different activity states and interpret the few-daytimescale variability as produced by changes in the high-energy component ofthe electron energy distribution.

1411.0334	the connection between the 15 ghz radio and gamma-ray emission in  blazars	since mid-2007 we have carried out a dedicated long-term monitoring programmeat 15 ghz using the owens valley radio observatory 40 meter telescope. one ofthe main goals of this programme is to study the relation between the radio andgamma-ray emission in blazars and to use it as a tool to locate the site ofhigh energy emission. using this large sample of objects we are able tocharacterize the radio variability, and study the significance of correlationsbetween the radio and gamma-ray bands. we find that the radio variability ofmany sources can be described using a simple power law power spectral density,and that when taking into account the red-noise characteristics of the lightcurves, cases with significant correlation are rare. we note that whilesignificant correlations are found in few individual objects, radio variationsare most often delayed with respect to the gamma-ray variations. this suggeststhat the gamma-ray emission originates upstream of the radio emission. becausestrong flares in most known gamma-ray-loud blazars are infrequent, longer lightcurves are required to settle the issue of the strength of radio-gammacross-correlations and establish confidently possible delays between the two.for this reason continuous multiwavelength monitoring over a longer time periodis essential for statistical tests of jet emission models.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1501.07407	a combined radio and gev gamma-ray view of the 2012 and 2013 flares of  mrk 421	in 2012 markarian 421 underwent the largest flare ever observed in thisblazar at radio frequencies. in the present study, we start exploring thisunique event and compare it to a less extreme event in 2013. we use 15 ghzradio data obtained with the owens valley radio observatory 40-m telescope, 95ghz millimeter data from the combined array for research in millimeter-waveastronomy, and gev gamma-ray data from the fermi gamma-ray space telescope. theradio light curves during the flaring periods in 2012 and 2013 have verydifferent appearances, both in shape and peak flux density. assuming that theradio and gamma-ray flares are physically connected, we attempt to model themost prominent sub-flares of the 2012 and 2013 activity periods by using thesimplest possible theoretical framework. we first fit a one-zone synchrotronself-compton (ssc) model to the less extreme 2013 flare and estimate parametersdescribing the emission region. we then model the major gamma-ray and radioflares of 2012 using the same framework. the 2012 gamma-ray flare shows twodistinct spikes of similar amplitude, so we examine scenarios associating theradio flare with each spike in turn. in the first scenario, we cannot explainthe sharp radio flare with a simple ssc model, but we can accommodate this byadding plausible time variations to the doppler beaming factor. in the secondscenario, a varying doppler factor is not needed, but the ssc model parametersrequire fine tuning. both alternatives indicate that the sharp radio flare, ifphysically connected to the preceding gamma-ray flares, can be reproduced onlyfor a very specific choice of parameters.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1507.03022	high radio frequency properties and variability of brightest cluster  galaxies	we consider the high radio frequency (15 ghz - 353 ghz) properties andvariability of 35 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). these are the mostcore-dominated sources drawn from a parent sample of more than 700 x-rayselected clusters, thus allowing us to relate our results to the generalpopulation. we find that &gt;6.0% of our parent sample (&gt;15.1% if only cool-coreclusters are considered) contain a radio-source at 150 ghz of at least 3mjy(~1x10^23 w/hz at our median redshift of z~0.13). furthermore, &gt;3.4% of thebcgs in our parent sample contain a peaked component (gigahertz peakedspectrum, gps) in their spectra that peaks above 2 ghz, increasing to &gt;8.5% ifonly cool-core clusters are considered. we see little evidence for strongvariability at 15 ghz on short (week-month) time-scales although we seevariations greater than 20% at 150 ghz over 6-month times-frames for 4 of the23 sources with multi-epoch observations. much more prevalent is long-term(year-decade time-scale) variability, with average annual amplitude variationsgreater than 1% at 15 ghz being commonplace. there is a weak trend towardshigher variability as the peak of the gps-like component occurs at higherfrequency. we demonstrate the complexity that is seen in the radio spectra ofbcgs and discuss the potentially significant implications of these high-peakingcomponents for sunyaev-zel'dovich cluster searches.

1507.05953	why haven't many of the brightest radio loud blazars been detected by  fermi ?	we use the complete mojave 1.5 jy sample of active galactic nuclei (agn) toexamine the gamma-ray detection statistics of the brightest radio-loud blazarsin the northern sky. we find that 23% of these agn were not detected above 0.1gev by the fermi lat during the 4-year 3fgl catalog period partly because of aninstrumental selection effect, and partly due to their lower doppler boostingfactors. blazars with synchrotron peaks in their spectral energy distributionslocated below $10^{13.4}$ hz also tend to have high-energy peaks that lie belowthe 0.1 gev threshold of the lat, and are thus less likely to be detected byfermi. the non-detected agn in the 1.5 jy sample also have significantly lower15 ghz radio modulation indices and apparent jet speeds, indicating that theyhave lower than average doppler factors. since the effective amount ofrelativistic doppler boosting is enhanced in gamma-rays (particularly in thecase of external inverse-compton scattering), this makes them less likely toappear in the 3fgl catalog. based on their observed properties, we haveidentified several bright radio-selected blazars that are strong candidates forfuture detection by fermi.

(the big bang nucleosynthesisestimate is 0.019\pm 0.002.) substantial dark (unclustered) energy is inferred,\omega_q \approx 0.68 \pm 0.05, and cmb+lss \omega_q values are compatible withthe independent sn1 estimates. the dark energy equation of state, crudelyparameterized by a quintessence-field pressure-to-density ratio w_q, is notwell determined by cmb+lss (w_q &lt; -0.4 at 95% cl), but when combined with sn1the resulting w_q &lt; -0.7 limit is quite consistent with the w_q=-1 cosmologicalconstant case.

astro-ph;0306383	interferometric observations of the cosmic microwave background  radiation	radio interferometers are well suited to studies of both total intensity andpolarized intensity fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation,and they have been used successfully in measurements of both the primary andsecondary anisotropy. recent observations with the cosmic background imageroperating in the chilean andes, the degree angular scale interferometeroperating at the south pole, and the very small array operating in tenerifehave probed the primary anisotropy over a wide range of angular scales. theadvantages of interferometers for microwave background observations of bothtotal intensity and polarized radiation are discussed, and the cosmologicalresults from these three instruments are presented. the results show that,subject to a reasonable value for the hubble constant, which is degenerate withthe geometry in closed models, the geometry of the universe is flat to highprecision (~5%) and the primordial fluctuation spectrum is very close to thescale-invariant harrison-zel'dovich spectrum. both of these findings areconcordant with inflationary predictions. the results also show that thebaryonic matter content is consistent with that found from primordialnucleosynthesis, while the cold dark matter component can account for no morethan ~40% of the energy density of the universe. it is a requirement of theseobservations, therefore, that ~60% of the energy content of the universe is notrelated to matter, either baryonic or nonbaryonic. this dark energy componentof the energy density is attributed to a nonzero cosmological constant.

astro-ph;0309737	the relationship between the x-ray and radio components in the compact  steep spectrum quasar 3c 48	we combine results from rosat, chandra, and multifrequency vlba observationsof the compact steep spectrum quasar 3c 48. we infer that the x-ray spectrum ofthe nucleus is made up of a soft, variable, steep-spectrum component, andharder, power-law emission of slope consistent with the 1 ghz radio spectrum.the similarity of 3c 48's x-ray to radio ratio to that seen in core-dominatedradio-loud quasars leads us to examine the possibility that the harder x-rayemission is inverse compton radiation from the radio source, which is more than99% resolved in our vlba data. the weak (3 sigma) evidence that we find for aproper motion of 0.5\pm0.2c in a compact radio component about 0.05 arcsec fromthe core implies that if this component has a highly relativistic bulk motion,it is at a very small angle to the line of sight. however, stringentrequirements on the jet opening angle make it unlikely that all the x-rayemission is from a fast jet which sees boosted cosmic microwave backgroundemission and emits beamed x-rays in the observer's frame. if the unusual radiostructures are intrinsically one-sided and unbeamed, the inverse comptonmechanism can provide an appreciable fraction of the x-ray emission if themagnetic field strength is a factor of six to ten below that which gives equalenergy in radiating relativistic particles and magnetic fields and roughlyminimizes the total energy in the source. it remains possible that theunresolved x-ray emission arises from close to the central engine, either as anembedded blazar or associated with the accretion processes.

astro-ph;0312021	anomalous radio emission from dust in the helix	a byproduct of experiments designed to map the cmb is the recent detection ofa new component of foreground galactic emission. the anomalous foreground at ~10--30 ghz, unexplained by traditional emission mechanisms, correlates with100um dust emission. we report that in the helix the emission at 31 ghz and100um are well correlated, and exhibit similar features on sky images, whichare absent in h\beta. upper limits on the 250 ghz continuum emission in thehelix rule out cold grains as candidates for the 31 ghz emission, and providespectroscopic evidence for an excess at 31 ghz over bremsstrahlung. we estimatethat the 100um-correlated radio emission, presumably due to dust, accounts forat least 20% of the 31 ghz emission in the helix. this result strengthensprevious tentative interpretations of diffuse ism spectra involving a new dustemission mechanism at radio frequencies. very small grains have not beendetected in the helix, which hampers interpreting the new component in terms ofspinning dust. the observed iron depletion in the helix favors considering theidentity of this new component to be magnetic dipole emission from hotferromagnetic grains. the reduced level of free-free continuum we report alsoimplies an electronic temperature of te=4600\pm1200k for the free-free emittingmaterial, which is significantly lower than the temperature of 9500\pm500kinferred from collisionally-excited lines (abridged).

astro-ph;0611215	high resolution imaging of the anomalous flux-ratio gravitational lens  system class b2045+265: dark or luminous satellites?	the existence of flux-ratio anomalies between fold and cusp images ingalaxy-scale strong-lens systems has led to an interpretation based on thepresence of a high mass-fraction of cold-dark-matter (cdm) substructures aroundgalaxies, as predicted by numerical n-body simulations. the flux-ratio anomalyis particularly evident in the radio-loud quadruple gravitational lens systemclass b2045+265. in this paper, new high-resolution radio, optical, andinfrared imaging of b2045+265 is presented which sheds more light on thisanomaly and its possible causes. first, deep very long baseline arrayobservations show very compact images, possibly with a hint of a jet, but withno evidence for differential scattering or scatter broadening. second, opticaland infrared observations with the hubble space telescope and throughadaptive-optics imaging with the w. m. keck telescope, show a previouslyundiscovered object -- interpreted as a (tidally disrupted) dwarf satellitebased on its colours and slight extension -- between the main lens galaxy andthe three anomalous flux-ratio images. third, colour variations in theearly-type lens galaxy indicate recent star-formation, possibly the result ofsecondary infall of gas-rich satellites. a population of such galaxies aroundthe lens system could explain the previously discovered strong [o ii] emission.however, spiral structure and/or normal star formation in the lens galaxycannot be excluded. in light of these new data, we propose a lens model for thesystem, including the observed dwarf satellite, which reproduces all positionaland flux-ratio constraints, without the need for additional cdm substructure.[abridged]

astro-ph;9811167	b2045+265: a new four-image gravitational lens from class	we have discovered a new gravitational lens in the cosmic lens all-sky survey(class). b2045+265 is a four-image system with a maximum separation of 1.9arcsec. a fifth radio component is detected, but its radio spectrum and itspositional coincidence with infrared emission from the lensing galaxy stronglysuggests that it is the radio core of the lensing galaxy. this implies that theb2045+265 system consists of a flat-spectrum radio source being lensed byanother flat-spectrum radio source. infrared images detect the lensed images ofthe background source and the lensing galaxy. the lensed images have relativepositions and flux densities that are consistent with those seen at radiowavelengths. spectra of the system reveal a lens redshift of z_l=0.8673 and asource redshift of z_s=1.28. the image splitting and system redshifts implythat the projected mass inside the einstein radius of the lensing galaxy ism_e=4.7x10^{11} h^{-1} m_sun. an estimate of the light emitted inside theeinstein radius gives a mass-to-light ratio in the rest frame b band of(m/l_b)_e = 20 h (m/l_b)_sun. both the mass and mass-to-light ratio are higherthan what is seen in nearby sa galaxies. in fact, the implied rotation velocityfor the lensing galaxy is two to three times higher than what is seen in nearbyspirals. the large projected mass inside the einstein ring radius may be theresult of a significant amount of dark matter in the system, perhaps from acompact group of galaxies; however, it may also arise from a misidentificationof the source redshift. a simple model of the gravitational potential of thelens reproduces the image positions well, but further modeling is required tosatisfy the constraints from the image flux density ratios. with furtherobservations and modeling, this lens may yield an estimate of h_0.

astro-ph;9903441	discovery of a radio flare from grb 990123	we report the discovery of a radio counterpart to grb 990123. in contrast toprevious well-studied radio afterglows which rise to peak flux on a timescaleof a week and then decay over several weeks to months, the radio emission fromthis grb was clearly detected one day after the burst, after which it rapidlyfaded away. the simplest interpretation of this ``radio flare'' is that itarises from the reverse shock. in the framework of the afterglow modelsdiscussed to date, a forward shock origin for the flare is ruled out by ourdata. however, at late times, some radio afterglow emission (commensurate withthe observed late-time optical emission, the optical afterglow) is expectedfrom the forward shock. the relative faintness of the observed late-time radioemission provides an independent indication for a jet-like geometry in thisgrb. we use the same radio observations to constrain two key parameters of theforward shock, peak flux and peak frequency, to within a factor of two. thesevalues are inconsistent with the notion advocated by several authors that theprompt optical emission detected by rotse smoothly joins the optical afterglowemission. finally, with hindsight we now recognize another such radio flare andthis suggests that one out of eight grbs has a detectable radio flare. thisabundance coupled with the reverse shock interpretation suggests that the radioflare phenomenon has the potential to shed new light into the physics ofreverse shocks in grbs.

astro-ph;9905043	class b1152+199 and b1359+154: two new gravitational lens systems  discovered in the cosmic lens all-sky survey	the third phase of the cosmic lens all-sky survey (class) has recently beencompleted, bringing the total number of sources imaged to over 15000 in theclass and jvas combined survey. in the vla observations carried out in marchand april of 1998, two new candidate lensed systems were discovered: classb1152+199 and b1359+154. b1152+199 is a 1.6 arcsecond double, with a backgroundquasar at z=1.019 lensed by a foreground galaxy at z=0.439. the relatively flatradio spectra of the lensed images, combined with a previous rosat detection ofthe source, make b1152+199 a strong candidate for time delay studies at bothradio and x-ray wavelengths. b1359+154 is a quadruply lensed quasar at z=3.235,with a maximum image separation of 1.7 arcseconds. as yet, the redshift of thelensing object in this system is undetermined. the steep spectral index of thesource suggests that b1359+154 will not exhibit strong variability, and istherefore unlikely to be useful for determining the hubble constant frommeasured time delays.

astro-ph;9905075	the proper motion of sgra*: i. first vlba results	we observed sgr a* and two extragalactic radio sources nearby in angle withthe vlba over a period of two years and measured relative positions with anaccuracy approaching 0.1 mas. the apparent proper motion of sgr a* relative toj1745-283 is 5.90 +/- 0.4 mas/yr, almost entirely in the plane of the galaxy.the effects of the orbit of the sun around the galactic center can account forthis motion, and any residual proper motion of sgr a*, with respect toextragalactic sources, is less than about 20 km/s. assuming that sgr a* is atrest at the center of the galaxy, we estimate that the circular rotation speedin the galaxy at the position of the sun is 219 +/- 20 km/s, scaled by ro/8.0kpc.  current observations are consistent with sgr a* containing all of the nearly2.6 x 10^6 solar masses, deduced from stellar proper motions, in the form of amassive black hole. while the low luminosity of sgr a*, for example, mightpossibly have come from a contact binary containing of order 10 solar masses,the lack of substantial motion rules out a "stellar" origin for sgr a*. thevery slow speed of sgr a* yields a lower limit to the mass of sgr a* of about1,000 solar masses. even for this mass, sgr a* appears to be radiating at lessthan 0.1 percent of its eddington limit.

astro-ph;9907257	a determination of h_0 with the class gravitational lens b1608+656: i.  time delay measurements with the vla	we present the results of a program to monitor the four-image gravitationallens b1608+656 with the vla. the system was observed over a seven month periodfrom 1996 october to 1997 may. the 64 epochs of observation have an averagespacing of 3.6~d. the light curves of the four images of the background sourceshow that the flux density of the background source has varied at the ~5%level. we measure time delays in the system based on common features that areseen in all four light curves. the three independent time delays in the systemare found to be delta t_{ba} = 31 +/- 7~d, delta t_{bc} = 36 +/- 7~d, and deltat_{bd} = 76^{+9}_{-10}~d at 95% confidence. this is the first gravitationallens system for which three independent time delays have been measured. acompanion paper presents a mass model for the lensing galaxy which correctlyreproduces the observed image positions, flux density ratios, and time delayratios. the last condition is crucial for determining h_0 with a four-imagelens. we combine the time delays with the model to obtain a value for thehubble constant of h_0 = 59^{+8}_{-7} km/s/mpc at 95% confidence (statistical)for (omega_m, omega_{lambda}) = (1,0). in addition, there is an estimatedsystematic uncertainty of +/- 15 km/s/mpc from uncertainties in modeling theradial mass profiles of the lensing galaxies. the value of h_0 presented inthis paper is comparable to recent measurements of h_0 from the gravitationallenses 0957+561, pg1115+080, b0218+357, and pks1830-211.

astro-ph;9910523	a keck survey of gravitational lens systems: i. spectroscopy of sbs  0909+532, hst 1411+5211, and class b2319+051	we present new results from a continuing keck program to study gravitationallens systems. we have obtained redshifts for three lens systems, sbs 0909+532,hst 1411+5211, and class b2319+051. for all of these systems, either the sourceor lens redshift (or both) has been previously unidentified. we find (z_l, z_s)= (0.830, 1.377) for sbs 0909+532; (z_l, z_s) = (0.465, 2.811) for hst1411+5211, although the source redshift is still tentative; and (z_l1, z_l2) =(0.624, 0.588) for the two lensing galaxies in class b2319+051. the backgroundradio source in b2319+051 has not been detected optically; its redshift is,therefore, still unknown. we find that the spectral features of the centrallensing galaxy in all three systems are typical of an early-type galaxy. theobserved image splittings in sbs 0909+532 and hst 1411+5211 imply that themasses within the einstein ring radii of the lensing galaxies are 1.4 x 10^{11}and 2.0 x 10^{11} h^{-1} m_sun, respectively. the resulting b bandmass-to-light ratio for hst 1411+5211 is 41.3 +/- 1.2 h (m/l)_sun, a factor of5 times higher than the average early-type lensing galaxy. this largemass-to-light is almost certainly the result of the additional masscontribution from the cluster cl 3c295 at z = 0.46. for the lensing galaxy insbs 0909+532, we measure (m/l)_b = 4^{+11}_{-3} h (m/l)_sun where the largeerrors are the result of significant uncertainty in the galaxy luminosity.while we cannot measure directly the mass-to-light ratio of the lensing galaxyin b2319+051, we estimate that (m/l)_b is between 3-7 h (m/l)_sun.

astro-ph;9912188	redshifts and neutral hydrogen observations of compact symmetric objects  in the coins sample	compact symmetric objects (csos) are young radio galaxies whose jet axes lieclose to the plane of the sky, and whose appearance is therefore not dominatedby relativistic beaming effects. the small linear sizes of csos make themvaluable for studies of both the evolution of radio galaxies and testingunified schemes for active galactic nuclei (agn). a parsec-scale region of gassurrounding the central engine is predicted by both accretion and obscurationscenarios. working surfaces, or ``hot spots,'' and the radio jets of csos areclose enough to the central engines that this circumnuclear gas can be seen inabsorption.  the csos observed in the northern sky (coins) sample is comprised of 52 csocandidates identified in three vlbi surveys. of these, 27 have now beenconfirmed as csos. optical redshifts are available in the literature for 28 ofthe cso candidates, and hi absorption has been detected toward four. we presentnew optical spectroscopic redshifts for three of the candidates and summarizethe current status of optical identifications. we further report on thediscovery of hi in absorption towards the cso j1816+3457 and summarize theresults of neutral hydrogen absorption studies of the sources in this sample.
