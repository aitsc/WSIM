0904.4244	spitzer observations of cold dust galaxies	we combine new spitzer space telescope observations in the mid- andfar-infrared with scuba 850 micron observations to improve the measurement ofdust temperatures, masses and luminosities for 11 galaxies of the scuba localuniverse galaxy survey (slugs). by fitting dust models we measure typical dustmasses of 10e7.9 m_sol and dust luminosities of ~ 10e10 l_sol, for galaxieswith modest star formation rates. the data presented in this paper combinedwith previous observations show that cold dust is present in all types ofspiral galaxies and is a major contributor to their total luminosity. becauseof the lower dust temperature of the scuba sources measured in this paper, theyhave flatter far-ir nu f_nu(160um)/nu f_nu(850um) slopes than the largerspitzer nearby galaxies survey (sings), the sample that provides the bestmeasurements of the dust properties of galaxies in the nearby universe. the newdata presented here added to sings extend the parameter space that is wellcovered by local galaxies, providing a comprehensive set of templates that canbe used to interpret the observations of nearby and distant galaxies.

0905.1328	spitzer sage infrared photometry of massive stars in the large  magellanic cloud	we present a catalog of 1750 massive stars in the large magellanic cloud,with accurate spectral types compiled from the literature, and a photometriccatalog for a subset of 1268 of these stars, with the goal of exploring theirinfrared properties. the photometric catalog consists of stars with infraredcounterparts in the spitzer sage survey database, for which we present uniformphotometry from 0.3-24 microns in the ubvijhks+irac+mips24 bands. the resultinginfrared color-magnitude diagrams illustrate that the supergiant b[e], redsupergiant and luminous blue variable (lbv) stars are among the brightestinfrared point sources in the large magellanic cloud, due to their intrinsicbrightness, and at longer wavelengths, due to dust. we detect infrared excessesdue to free-free emission among ~900 ob stars, which correlate with luminosityclass. we confirm the presence of dust around 10 supergiant b[e] stars, findingthe shape of their spectral energy distributions (seds) to be very similar, incontrast to the variety of sed shapes among the spectrally variable lbvs. thesimilar luminosities of b[e] supergiants (log l/lo&gt;=4) and the rare, dustyprogenitors of the new class of optical transients (e.g. sn 2008s and ngc 300ot), plus the fact that dust is present in both types of objects, suggests acommon origin for them. we find the infrared colors for wolf-rayet stars to beindependent of spectral type and their seds to be flatter than what modelspredict. the results of this study provide the first comprehensive roadmap forinterpreting luminous, massive, resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxiesat infrared wavelengths.

0907.4722	the spitzer local volume legacy: survey description and infrared  photometry	the survey description and the near-, mid-, and far-infrared flux propertiesare presented for the 258 galaxies in the local volume legacy (lvl). lvl is aspitzer space telescope legacy program that surveys the local universe out to11 mpc, built upon a foundation of ultraviolet, h-alpha, and hst imaging from11hugs (11 mpc h-alpha and ultraviolet galaxy survey) and angst (acs nearbygalaxy survey treasury). lvl covers an unbiased, representative, andstatistically robust sample of nearby star-forming galaxies, exploiting thehighest extragalactic spatial resolution achievable with spitzer. as a resultof its approximately volume-limited nature, lvl augments previous spitzerobservations of present-day galaxies with improved sampling of thelow-luminosity galaxy population. the collection of lvl galaxies shows a largespread in mid-infrared colors, likely due to the conspicuous deficiency of 8umpah emission from low-metallicity, low-luminosity galaxies. conversely, thefar-infrared emission tightly tracks the total infrared emission, with adispersion in their flux ratio of only 0.1 dex. in terms of the relationbetween infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and ultraviolet spectral slope, the lvlsample shows redder colors and/or lower infrared-to-ultraviolet ratios thanstarburst galaxies, suggesting that reprocessing by dust is less important inthe lower mass systems that dominate the lvl sample. comparisons withtheoretical models suggest that the amplitude of deviations from the relationfound for starburst galaxies correlates with the age of the stellar populationsthat dominate the ultraviolet/optical luminosities.

0910.0774	star-forming or starbursting? the ultraviolet conundrum	compared to starburst galaxies, normal star forming galaxies have been shownto display a much larger dispersion of the dust attenuation at fixed reddeningthrough studies of the irx-beta diagram (the ir/uv ratio "irx" versus the uvcolor "beta"). to investigate the causes of this larger dispersion and attemptto isolate second parameters, we have used galex uv, ground-based optical, andspitzer infrared imaging of 8 nearby galaxies, and examined the properties ofindividual uv and 24 micron selected star forming regions. we concentrated onstar-forming regions, in order to isolate simpler star formation histories thanthose that characterize whole galaxies. we find that 1) the dispersion is notcorrelated with the mean age of the stellar populations, 2) a range of dustgeometries and dust extinction curves are the most likely causes for theobserved dispersion in the irx-beta diagram 3) together with some potentialdilution of the most recent star-forming population by older unrelated bursts,at least in the case of star-forming regions within galaxies, 4) we alsorecover some general characteristics of the regions, including a tight positivecorrelation between the amount of dust attenuation and the metal content.although generalizing our results to whole galaxies may not be immediate, thepossibility of a range of dust extinction laws and geometries should beaccounted for in the latter systems as well.

0707.2103	absolute calibration and characterization of the multiband imaging  photometer for spitzer. iii. an asteroid-based calibration of mips at 160  microns	we describe the absolute calibration of the multiband imaging photometer forspitzer (mips) 160 micron channel. after the on-orbit discovery of a near-irghost image that dominates the signal for sources hotter than about 2000 k, weadopted a strategy utilizing asteroids to transfer the absolute calibrations ofthe mips 24 and 70 micron channels to the 160 micron channel. near-simultaneousobservations at all three wavelengths are taken, and photometry at the twoshorter wavelengths is fit using the standard thermal model. the 160 micronflux density is predicted from those fits and compared with the observed 160micron signal to derive the conversion from instrumental units to surfacebrightness. the calibration factor we derive is 41.7 mjy/sr/mips160 (mips160being the instrumental units). the scatter in the individual measurements ofthe calibration factor, as well as an assesment of the external uncertaintiesinherent in the calibration, lead us to adopt an uncertainty of 5.0mjy/sr/mips160 (12%) for the absolute uncertainty on the 160 micron fluxdensity of a particular source as determined from a single measurement. forsources brighter than about 2 jy, non-linearity in the response of the 160micron detectors produces an under-estimate of the flux density: for objects asbright as 4 jy, measured flux densities are likely to be ~20% too low. thiscalibration has been checked against that of iso (using ulirgs) and iras (usingiras-derived diameters), and is consistent with those at the 5% level.

0910.5624	chemical depletion in the large magellanic cloud: rv tauri stars and the  photospheric feedback from their dusty discs	aims: by studying the photospheric abundances of 4 rv tauri stars in the lmc,we test whether the depletion pattern of refractory elements, seen in similargalactic sources, is also common for extragalactic sources. since thisdepletion process probably only occurs through interaction with a stable disc,we investigate the circumstellar environment of these sources. methods: adetailed photospheric abundance study was performed using high-resolution uvesoptical spectra. to study the circumstellar environment we use photometric datato construct the spectral energy distributions of the stars, and determine thegeometry of the circumstellar environment, whereas low-resolution spitzer-irsinfrared spectra are used to trace its mineralogy. results: our results showthat, also in the lmc, the photospheres of rv tauri stars are commonly affectedby the depletion process, although it can differ significantly in strength fromsource to source. from our detailed disc modelling and mineralogy study, wefind that this process, as in the galaxy, appears closely related to thepresence of a stable keplerian disc. the newly studied extragalactic objectshave similar observational characteristics as galactic post-agb binariessurrounded by a dusty disc, and are therefore also believed to be part of abinary system. one source shows a very small infrared excess, atypical for adisc source, but still has evidence for depletion. we speculate this couldpoint to the presence of a very evolved disc, similar to debris discs seenaround young stellar objects.

0911.0532	ice chemistry in embedded young stellar objects in the large magellanic  cloud	we present spectroscopic observations of a sample of 15 embedded youngstellar objects (ysos) in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). these observationswere obtained with the spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs) as part of thesage-spec legacy program. we analyze the two prominent ice bands in the irsspectral range: the bending mode of co_2 ice at 15.2 micron and the ice bandbetween 5 and 7 micron that includes contributions from the bending mode ofwater ice at 6 micron amongst other ice species. the 5-7 micron band isdifficult to identify in our lmc sample due to the conspicuous presence of pahemission superimposed onto the ice spectra. we identify water ice in thespectra of two sources; the spectrum of one of those sources also exhibits the6.8 micron ice feature attributed to ammonium and methanol. we model the co_2band in detail, using the combination of laboratory ice profiles available inthe literature. we find that a significant fraction (&gt; 50%) of co_2 ice islocked in a water-rich component, consistent with what is observed for galacticsources. the majority of the sources in the lmc also require a pure-co_2contribution to the ice profile, evidence of thermal processing. there is asuggestion that co_2 production might be enhanced in the lmc, but the size ofthe available sample precludes firmer conclusions. we place our results in thecontext of the star formation environment in the lmc.

0707.4165	the opacity of spiral galaxy disks viii: structure of the cold ism	the quantity of dust in a spiral disk can be estimated using the dust'stypical emission or the extinction of a known source. in this paper, we comparetwo techniques, one based on emission and one on absorption, applied onsections of fourteen disk galaxies. the two measurements reflect, respectivelythe average and apparent optical depth of a disk section. hence, they dependdifferently on the average number and optical depth of ism structures in thedisk. the small scale geometry of the cold ism is critical for accurate modelsof the overall energy budget of spiral disks. ism geometry, relativecontributions of different stellar populations and dust emissivity are all freeparameters in galaxy spectral energy distribution (sed) models; they are alsosometimes degenerate, depending on wavelength coverage. our aim is to constraintypical ism geometry. the apparent optical depth measurement comes from thenumber of distant galaxies seen in hst images through the foreground disk. wemeasure the ir flux in images from the {\it spitzer} infrared nearby galaxysurvey in the same section of the disk that was covered by hst. a physicalmodel of the dust is fit to the sed to estimate the dust surface density, meantemperature, and brightness in these disk sections. the surface density issubsequently converted into the average optical depth estimate. the twomeasurements generally agree. the ratios between the measured average andapparent optical depths of the disk sections imply optically thin clouds inthese disks. optically thick disks, are likely to have more than a single cloudalong the line-of-sight.

0707.4167	gaps in the cloud cover? comparing extinction measures in spiral disks	dust in galaxies can be mapped by either the fir/sub-mm emission, the opticalor infrared reddening of starlight, or the extinction of a known backgroundsource. we compare two dust extinction measurements for a set of fifteensections in thirteen nearby galaxies, to determine the scale of the dusty ismresponsible for disk opacity: one using stellar reddening and the other a knownbackground source. in our earlier papers, we presented extinction measurementsof 29 galaxies, based on calibrated counts of distant background objectsidentified though foreground disks in hst/wfpc2 images. for the 13 galaxiesthat overlap with the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings), we nowcompare these results with those obtained from an i-l color map. our goal is todetermine whether or not a detected distant galaxy indicates a gap in the dustyism, and hence to better understand the nature and geometry of the diskextinction.  we find that distant galaxies are predominantly in low-extinction sectionsmarked by the color maps, indicating that their number depends both on thecloud cover of {\it spitzer}-resolved dust structures --mostly the spiralarms--and a diffuse, unresolved underlying disk. we note that our infraredcolor map (e[i-l]) underestimates the overall dust presence in these disksseverely, because it implicitly assumes the presence of a dust screen in frontof the stellar distribution.

1003.0961	the calibration of monochromatic far-infrared star formation rate  indicators	(abridged) spitzer data at 24, 70, and 160 micron and ground-based h-alphaimages are analyzed for a sample of 189 nearby star-forming and starburstgalaxies to investigate whether reliable star formation rate (sfr) indicatorscan be defined using the monochromatic infrared dust emission centered at 70and 160 micron. we compare recently published recipes for sfr measures usingcombinations of the 24 micron and observed h-alpha luminosities with thoseusing 24 micron luminosity alone. from these comparisons, we derive a referencesfr indicator for use in our analysis. linear correlations between sfr and the70 and 160 micron luminosity are found for l(70)&gt;=1.4x10^{42} erg/s andl(160)&gt;=2x10^{42} erg/s, corresponding to sfr&gt;=0.1-0.3 m_sun/yr. below thosetwo luminosity limits, the relation between sfr and 70 micron (160 micron)luminosity is non-linear and sfr calibrations become problematic. thedispersion of the data around the mean trend increases for increasingwavelength, becoming about 25% (factor ~2) larger at 70 (160) micron than at 24micron. the increasing dispersion is likely an effect of the increasingcontribution to the infrared emission of dust heated by stellar populations notassociated with the current star formation. the non-linear relation between sfrand the 70 and 160 micron emission at faint galaxy luminosities suggests thatthe increasing transparency of the interstellar medium, decreasing effectivedust temperature, and decreasing filling factor of star forming regions acrossthe galaxy become important factors for decreasing luminosity. the sfrcalibrations are provided for galaxies with oxygen abundance 12+log(o/h)&gt;8.1.at lower metallicity the infrared luminosity no longer reliably traces the sfrbecause galaxies are less dusty and more transparent.

1005.1887	enhanced dust heating in the bulges of early-type spiral galaxies	stellar density and bar strength should affect the temperatures of the cool(t ~ 20-30 k) dust component in the inner regions of galaxies, which impliesthat the ratio of temperatures in the circumnuclear regions to the disk shoulddepend on hubble type. we investigate the differences between cool dusttemperatures in the central 3 kpc and disk of 13 nearby galaxies by fittingmodels to measurements between 70 and 500 microns. we attempt to quantifytemperature trends in nearby disk galaxies, with archival data fromspitzer/mips and new observations with herschel/spire, which were acquiredduring the first phases of the herschel observations for the kingfish (keyinsights in nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with herschel) sample. wefit single-temperature modified blackbodies to far-infrared and submillimetermeasurements of the central and disk regions of galaxies to determine thetemperature of the component(s) emitting at those wavelengths. we present theratio of central-region-to-disk-temperatures of the cool dust component of 13nearby galaxies as a function of morphological type. we find a significanttemperature gradient in the cool dust component in all galaxies, with a meancenter-to-disk temperature ratio of 1.15 +/- 0.03. the cool dust temperaturesin the central ~3 kpc of nearby galaxies are 23(+/-3)% hotter for morphologicaltypes earlier than sc, and only 9(+/-3)% hotter for later types. thetemperature ratio is also correlated with bar strength, with only stronglybarred galaxies having a ratio over 1.2. the strong radiation field in the highstellar density of a galactic bulge tends to heat the cool dust component tohigher temperatures, at least in early-type spirals with relatively largebulges, especially when paired with a strong bar.

(2008). we present a diagnosticdiagram that will help to identify similar sources based on spitzer/mips andherschel/pacs photometry. the sed of sage1cj053634 is peculiar because it lacksfar-ir emission and a clear stellar counterpart. we find that the sed and their spectrum can be understood as emission originating from the inner ~10 pcaround an accreting black hole. there is no need to invoke emission from thehost galaxy, either from the stars or from the interstellar medium, although apossible early-type host galaxy cannot be excluded based on the sed analysis.the hot dust around the accretion disk gives rise to a continuum, which peaksat 4 um, whereas the strong silicate features may arise from optically thinemission of dusty clouds within ~10 pc around the black hole. the weak pahemission does not appear to be linked to star formation, as star formationtemplates strongly over-predict the measured far-ir flux levels. the sed ofsage1cj053634 is rare in the local universe but may be more common in the moredistant universe. the conspicuous absence of host-galaxy ir emission placeslimits on the far-ir emission arising from the dusty torus alone.

1110.3235	the circumstellar environment of r coronae borealis: white dwarf merger  or final helium shell flash?	in 2007, r coronae borealis (r crb) went into an historically deep and longdecline. in this state, the dust acts like a natural coronagraph at visiblewavelengths, allowing faint nebulosity around the star to be seen. imaging hasbeen obtained from 0.5 to 500 micron with gemini/gmos, hst/wfpc2, spitzer/mips,and herschel/spire. several of the structures around r crb are cometaryglobules caused by wind from the star streaming past dense blobs. the estimateddust mass of the knots is consistent with their being responsible for the r crbdeclines if they form along the line of sight to the star. in addition, thereis a large diffuse shell extending up to 4 pc away from the star containingcool 25 k dust that is detected all the way out to 500 micron. the sed of r crbcan be well fit by a 150 au disk surrounded by a very large diffuse envelopewhich corresponds to the size of the observed nebulosity. the total masses ofthe disk and envelope are 10^-4 and 2 m(sun), respectively, assuming agas-to-dust ratio of 100. the evidence pointing toward a white-dwarf merger ora final-helium-shell flash origin for r crb is contradictory. the shell and thecometary knots are consistent with a fossil planetary nebula. along with thefact that r crb shows significant lithium in its atmosphere, this supports thefinal-helium-shell flash. however, the relatively high inferred mass of r crband its high fluorine abundance support a white-dwarf merger.

1111.4438	kingfish -- key insights on nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with  herschel: survey description and image atlas	the kingfish project (key insights on nearby galaxies: a far-infrared surveywith herschel) is an imaging and spectroscopic survey of 61 nearby (d &lt; 30 mpc)galaxies, chosen to cover a wide range of galaxy properties and localinterstellar medium (ism) environments found in the nearby universe. its broadgoals are to characterize the ism of present-day galaxies, the heating andcooling of their gaseous and dust components, and to better understand thephysical processes linking star formation and the ism. kingfish is a directdescendant of the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings), whichproduced complete spitzer imaging and spectroscopic mapping and a comprehensiveset of multi-wavelength ancillary observations for the sample. the herschelimaging consists of complete maps for the galaxies at 70, 100, 160, 250, 350,and 500 microns. the spectal line imaging of the principal atomic ism coolinglines ([oi]63um, [oiii]88um, [nii]122,205um, and [cii]158um) covers thesubregions in the centers and disks that already have been mapped in themid-infrared with spitzer. the kingfish and sings multi-wavelength datasetscombined provide panchromatic mapping of the galaxies sufficient to resolveindividual star-forming regions, and tracing the important heating and coolingchannels of the ism, across a wide range of local extragalactic ismenvironments. this paper summarizes the scientific strategy for kingfish, theproperties of the galaxy sample, the observing strategy, and data processingand products. it also presents a combined spitzer and herschel image atlas forthe kingfish galaxies, covering the wavelength range 3.6 -- 500 microns. allimaging and spectroscopy data products will be released to the herschel usergenerated product archives.

1112.3348	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga). i: global  far-infrared and sub-mm morphology	we have obtained herschel images at five wavelengths from 100 to 500 micronof a ~5.5x2.5 degree area centred on the local galaxy m31 (andromeda), ournearest neighbour spiral galaxy, as part of the herschel guaranteed timeproject "helga". the main goals of helga are to study the characteristics ofthe extended dust emission, focusing on larger scales than studied in previousobservations of andromeda at an increased spatial resolution, and the obscuredstar formation. in this paper we present data reduction and herschel maps, andprovide a description of the far-infrared morphology, comparing it withfeatures seen at other wavelengths. we use high--resolution maps of the atomichydrogen, fully covering our fields, to identify dust emission features thatcan be associated to m31 with confidence, distinguishing them from emissioncoming from the foreground galactic cirrus. thanks to the very large extensionof our maps we detect, for the first time at far-infrared wavelengths, threearc-like structures extending out to ~21, ~26 and ~31 kpc respectively, in thesouth-western part of m31. the presence of these features, hosting ~2.2e6 msolof dust, is safely confirmed by their detection in hi maps. overall, weestimate a total dust mass of ~5.8e7 msol, about 78% of which is contained inthe two main ring-like structures at 10 and 15 kpc, at an average temperatureof 16.5 k. we find that the gas-to-dust ratio declines exponentially as afunction of the galacto-centric distance, in agreement with the knownmetallicity gradient, with values ranging from 66 in the nucleus to ~275 in theoutermost region.

1201.5384	the dust budget of the smc: are agb stars the primary dust source at low  metallicity?	we estimate the total dust input from the cool evolved stars in the smallmagellanic cloud (smc), using the 8 micron excess emission as a proxy for thedust-production rate. we find that asymptotic giant branch (agb) and redsupergiant (rsg) stars produce (8.6-9.5) x 10^7 solar masses per year of dust,depending on the fraction of far-infrared sources that belong to the evolvedstar population (with 10%-50% uncertainty in individual dust-production rates).rsgs contribute the least (&lt;4%), while carbon-rich agb stars (especially theso-called "extreme" agb stars) account for 87%-89% of the total dust input fromcool evolved stars. we also estimate the dust input from hot stars andsupernovae (sne), and find that if sne produce 10^-3 solar masses of dust each,then the total sn dust input and agb input are roughly equivalent. we considerseveral scenarios of sne dust production and destruction and find that theinterstellar medium (ism) dust can be accounted for solely by stellar sourcesif all sne produce dust in the quantities seen around the dustiest examples andif most sne explode in dense regions where much of the ism dust is shieldedfrom the shocks. we find that agb stars contribute only 2.1% of the ism dust.without a net positive contribution from sne to the dust budget, this suggeststhat dust must grow in the ism or be formed by another unknown mechanism.

1204.0785	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga) ii: dust and  gas in andromeda	we present an analysis of the dust and gas in andromeda, using herschelimages sampling the entire far-infrared peak. we fit a modified-blackbody modelto ~4000 quasi-independent pixels with spatial resolution of ~140pc and findthat a variable dust-emissivity index (beta) is required to fit the data. wefind no significant long-wavelength excess above this model suggesting there isno cold dust component. we show that the gas-to-dust ratio varies radially,increasing from ~20 in the center to ~70 in the star-forming ring at 10kpc,consistent with the metallicity gradient. in the 10kpc ring the average beta is~1.9, in good agreement with values determined for the milky way (mw). however,in contrast to the mw, we find significant radial variations in beta, whichincreases from 1.9 at 10kpc to ~2.5 at a radius of 3.1kpc and then decreases to1.7 in the center. the dust temperature is fairly constant in the 10kpc ring(ranging from 17-20k), but increases strongly in the bulge to ~30k. within3.1kpc we find the dust temperature is highly correlated with the 3.6 micronflux, suggesting the general stellar population in the bulge is the dominantsource of dust heating there. at larger radii, there is a weak correlationbetween the star formation rate and dust temperature. we find no evidence for'dark gas' in m31 in contrast to recent results for the mw. finally, weobtained an estimate of the co x-factor by minimising the dispersion in thegas-to-dust ratio, obtaining a value of (1.9+/-0.4)x10^20 cm^-2 [k kms^-1]^-1.

1204.2936	herschel/spire observations of the dusty disk of ngc 4244	we present herschel/spire images at 250, 350, and 500 {\mu}m of ngc 4244, atypical low-mass, disk-only and edge-on spiral galaxy. the dust disk is clumpyand shows signs of truncation at the break radius of the stellar disk. thisdisk coincides with the densest part of the hi disk. we compare the spectralenergy distribution, including the new spire fluxes, to 3d radiative transfermodels; a smooth model disk and a clumpy model with embedded heating. eachmodel requires a very high value for the dust scale-length (h(dust) = 2 - 5h(stars)), higher dust masses than previous models of ngc 4244 (md = 0.47 -1.39 \times 10e7 msun) and a face-on optical depth of {\tau}(v) = 0.4 - 1.12,in agreement with previous disk opacity studies. the vertical scales of starsand dust are similar. the clumpy model much better mimics the generalmorphology in the submm images and the general sed. the inferred gas-to-dustmass ratio is compatible with those of similar low-mass disks. the relativelylarge radial scale-length of the dust disk points to radial mixing of the dustyism within the stellar disk. the large vertical dust scale and the clumpy dustdistribution of our sed model are both consistent with a scenario in which thevertical structure of the ism is dictated by the balance of turbulence andself-gravity.

1207.4186	modeling dust and starlight in galaxies observed by spitzer and  herschel: ngc 628 and ngc 6946	we characterize the dust in ngc628 and ngc6946, two nearby spiral galaxies inthe kingfish sample. with data from 3.6um to 500um, dust models are stronglyconstrained. using the draine &amp; li (2007) dust model, (amorphous silicate andcarbonaceous grains), for each pixel in each galaxy we estimate (1) dust masssurface density, (2) dust mass fraction contributed by polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pah)s, (3) distribution of starlight intensities heating thedust, (4) total infrared (ir) luminosity emitted by the dust, and (5) irluminosity originating in regions with high starlight intensity. we obtain mapsfor the dust properties, which trace the spiral structure of the galaxies. thedust models successfully reproduce the observed global and resolved spectralenergy distributions (seds). the overall dust/h mass ratio is estimated to be0.0082+/-0.0017 for ngc628, and 0.0063+/-0.0009 for ngc6946, consistent withwhat is expected for galaxies of near-solar metallicity. our derived dustmasses are larger (by up to a factor 3) than estimates based onsingle-temperature modified blackbody fits. we show that the sed fits aresignificantly improved if the starlight intensity distribution includes a(single intensity) "delta function" component. we find no evidence forsignificant masses of cold dust t&lt;12k. discrepancies between pacs and mipsphotometry in both low and high surface brightness areas result in largeuncertainties when the modeling is done at pacs resolutions, in which casespire, mips70 and mips160 data cannot be used. we recommend against attemptingto model dust at the angular resolution of pacs.

1301.6884	a detailed study of the radio--fir correlation in ngc6946 with  herschel-pacs/spire from kingfish	we derive the distribution of the synchrotron spectral index across ngc6946and investigate the correlation between the radio continuum (synchrotron) andfar-infrared (fir) emission using the kingfish herschel pacs and spire data.the radio--fir correlation is studied as a function of star formation rate,magnetic field strength, radiation field strength, and the total gas surfacebrightness. the synchrotron emission follows both star-forming regions and theso-called magnetic arms present in the inter-arm regions. the synchrotronspectral index is steepest along the magnetic arms ($\alpha_n \sim 1$), whileit is flat in places of giant h{\sc ii} regions and in the center of the galaxy($\alpha_n \sim 0.6-0.7$). the map of $\alpha_n$ provides an observationalevidence for aging and energy loss of cosmic ray electrons propagating in thedisk of the galaxy. variations in the synchrotron--fir correlation across thegalaxy are shown to be a function of both star formation and magnetic fields.we find that the synchrotron emission correlates better with cold rather thanwith warm dust emission, when the interstellar radiation field is the mainheating source of dust. the synchrotron--fir correlation suggests a couplingbetween the magnetic field and the gas density. ngc6946 shows a power-lawbehavior between the total (turbulent) magnetic field strength b and the starformation rate surface density $\sigma_{\rm sfr}$ with an index of0.14\,(0.16)$\pm$0.01. this indicates an efficient production of the turbulentmagnetic field with the increasing gas turbulence expected in actively starforming regions. the scale-by-scale analysis of the synchrotron--fircorrelation indicates that the ism affects the propagation of old/diffusedcosmic ray electrons, resulting in a diffusion coefficient of $d_0=4.6\times10^{28}$\,cm$^2$\,s$^{-1}$ for 2.2\,gev cres.

1302.4363	calibration of the total infrared luminosity of nearby galaxies from  spitzer and herschel bands	we present new empirical calibrations to estimate resolved and integratedtotal infrared luminosities from spitzer and herschel bands used asmonochromatic or combined tracers. we base our calibrations on resolvedelements of nearby galaxies (3 to 30 mpc) observed with herschel. we perform aresolved sed modelling of these objects using the draine and li (2007) dustmodels and investigate the influence of the addition of spire measurements inthe estimation of ltir. we find that using data up to 250 um leads to localltir values consistent with those obtained with a complete coverage (up to 500um) within 10 per cent for most of our resolved elements. we then study thedistribution of energy in the resolved seds of our galaxies. the bulk of energy(30-50 per cent) is contained in the (70-160 um) band. the (24-70 um) fractiondecreases with increasing metallicity. the (160-1100 um) submillimeter band canaccount for up to 25 per cent of the ltir in metal-rich galaxies. weinvestigate the correlation between tir surface brightnesses/luminosities andmonochromatic spitzer and herschel surface brightnesses/luminosities. the threepacs bands can be used as reliable monochromatic estimators of the ltir, the100 um band being the most reliable monochromatic tracer. there is also astrong correlation between the spire 250um and ltir, although with more scatterthan for the pacs relations. we also study the ability of our monochromaticrelations to reproduce integrated ltir of nearby galaxies as well as ltir ofz=1-3 sources. finally, we provide calibration coefficients that can be used toderive tir surface brightnesses/luminosities from a combination of spitzer andherschel surface brightnesses/fluxes and analyse the associated uncertainties.

1304.2896	using hierarchical octrees in monte carlo radiative transfer simulations	a crucial aspect of 3d monte carlo radiative transfer is the choice of thespatial grid used to partition the dusty medium. we critically investigate theuse of octree grids in monte carlo dust radiative transfer, with two differentoctree construction algorithms (regular and barycentric subdivision) and threedifferent octree traversal algorithms (top-down, neighbour list, and thebookkeeping method). in general, regular octree grids need higher levels ofsubdivision compared to the barycentric grids for a fixed maximum cell massthreshold criterion. the total number of grid cells, however, depends on thegeometry of the model. surprisingly, regular octree grid simulations turn outto be 10 to 20% more efficient in run time than the barycentric gridsimulations, even for those cases where the latter contain fewer grid cellsthan the former. furthermore, we find that storing neighbour lists for eachcell in an octree, ordered according to decreasing overlap area, is worth theadditional memory and implementation overhead: using neighbour lists can cutdown the grid traversal by 20% compared to the traditional top-down method. inconclusion, the combination of a regular node subdivision and the neighbourlist method results in the most efficient octree structure for monte carloradiative transfer simulations.

1305.2923	mapping dust through emission and absorption in nearby galaxies	dust has long been identified as a barrier to measuring inherent galaxyproperties. however, the link between dust and attenuation is notstraightforward and depends on both the amount of dust and its distribution.herschel imaging of nearby galaxies undertaken as part of the kingfish projectallows us to map the dust as seen in emission with unprecedented sensitivityand ~1 kpc resolution. we present here new optical integral field unitspectroscopy for eight of these galaxies that provides complementary 100-200 pcscale maps of the dust attenuation through observation of the reddening in boththe balmer decrement and the stellar continuum. the stellar continuumreddening, which is systematically less than that observed in the balmerdecrement, shows no clear correlation with the dust, suggesting that thedistribution of stellar reddening acts as a poor tracer of the overall dustcontent. the brightest hii regions are observed to be preferentially located industy regions, and we do find a correlation between the balmer line reddeningand the dust mass surface density for which we provide an empirical relation.some of the high-inclination systems in our sample exhibit high extinction, butwe also find evidence that unresolved variations in the dust distribution onscales smaller than 500 pc may contribute to the scatter in this relation. wecaution against the use of integrated a_v measures to infer global dustproperties.

0801.1700	metallicity effects on dust properties in starbursting galaxies	we present infrared observations of 66 starburst galaxies over a wide rangeof oxygen abundances, to measure how metallicity affects their dust properties.the data include imaging and spectroscopy from the spitzer space telescope,supplemented by groundbased near-infrared imaging. we confirm a strongcorrelation of aromatic emission with metallicity, with a threshold at ametallicity [12+log(o/h)]~8. the large scatter in both the metallicity andradiation hardness dependence of this behavior implies that it is not due to asingle effect, but to some combination. we show that the far-infrared colortemperature of the large dust grains increases towards lower metallicity,peaking at a metallicity of 8 before turning over. we compute dust masses andcompare them to hi masses from the literature to derive the gas to dust ratio,which increases by nearly 3 orders of magnitude between solar metallicity and ametallicity of 8, below which it flattens out. the abrupt change in aromaticemission at mid-infrared wavelengths thus appears to be reflected in thefar-infrared properties, indicating that metallicity changes affect thecomposition of the full range of dust grain sizes that dominate the infraredemission. in addition, we find that the ratio l(8 micron)/l(tir), important forcalibrating 24 micron measurements of high redshift galaxies, increasesslightly as the metallicity decreases from ~solar to ~50% of solar, and thendecreases by an order of magnitude with further decreases in metallicity.although the great majority of galaxies show similar patterns of behavior asdescribed above, there are three exceptions, sbs 0335-052e, haro 11, and shoc391. their infrared seds are dominated energetically by the mid-ir near 24micron rather than by the 60 - 200 micron region.

1409.5916	cool dust heating and temperature mixing in nearby star-forming galaxies	physical conditions of the interstellar medium in galaxies are closely linkedto the ambient radiation field and the heating of dust grains. in order tocharacterize dust properties in galaxies over a wide range of physicalconditions, we present here the radial surface brightness profiles of theentire sample of 61 galaxies from key insights into nearby galaxies:far-infrared survey with herschel (kingfish). the main goal of our work is thecharacterization of the grain emissivities, dust temperatures, and interstellarradiation fields responsible for heating the dust. after fitting the dust andstellar radial profiles with exponential functions, we fit the far-infraredspectral energy distribution (sed) in each annular region withsingle-temperature modified black bodies using both variable (mbbv) and fixed(mbbf) emissivity indices beta, as well as with physically motivated dustmodels. results show that while most sed parameters decrease with radius, theemissivity index beta also decreases with radius in some galaxies, but inothers is increasing, or rising in the inner regions and falling in the outerones. despite the fixed grain emissivity (average beta~ 2.1) of thephysically-motivated models, they are well able to accommodate flat spectralslopes with beta&lt;= 1. we find that flatter slopes (beta&lt;= 1.5) are associatedwith cooler temperatures, contrary to what would be expected from the usualtdust-beta degeneracy. this trend is related to variations in umin since betaand umin are very closely linked over the entire range in umin sampled by thekingfish galaxies: low umin is associated with flat beta&lt;=1. both these resultsstrongly suggest that the low apparent \beta values (flat slopes) in mbbv fitsare caused by temperature mixing along the line-of-sight, rather than byintrinsic variations in grain properties. abstract truncated for arxiv.

1412.0695	an infrared census of dust in nearby galaxies with spitzer (dustings),  ii. discovery of metal-poor dusty agb stars	the dustings survey (dust in nearby galaxies with spitzer) is a 3.6 and 4.5micron imaging survey of 50 nearby dwarf galaxies designed to identifydust-producing asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and massive stars. using twoepochs, spaced approximately six months apart, we identify a total of 526 dustyvariable agb stars (sometimes called "extreme" or x-agb stars; [3.6]-[4.5]&gt;0.1mag). of these, 111 are in galaxies with [fe/h] &lt; -1.5 and 12 are in galaxieswith [fe/h] &lt; -2.0, making them the most metal-poor dust-producing agb starsknown. we compare these identifications to those in the literature and findthat most are newly discovered large-amplitude variables, with the exception ofapproximately 30 stars in ngc 185 and ngc 147, one star in ic 1613, and onestar in phoenix. the chemical abundances of the x-agb variables are unknown,but the low metallicities suggest that they are more likely to be carbon-richthan oxygen-rich and comparisons with existing optical and near-ir photometryconfirms that 70 of the x-agb variables are confirmed or likely carbon stars.we see an increase in the pulsation amplitude with increased dust production,supporting previous studies suggesting that dust production and pulsation arelinked. we find no strong evidence linking dust production with metallicity,indicating that dust can form in very metal-poor environments.

1509.05781	mid-infrared spectroscopy of the andromeda galaxy	we present spitzer/infrared spectrograph (irs) 5-21 micron spectroscopic mapstowards 12 regions in the andromeda galaxy (m31). these regions include thenucleus, bulge, an active region in the star-forming ring, and 9 other regionschosen to cover a range of mid-to-far-infrared colours. in line with previousresults, pah feature ratios (6.2 micron and 7.7 micron features compared to the11.2 micron feature) measured from our extracted m31 spectra, except thenucleus, strongly correlate. the equivalent widths of the main pah features, asa function of metallicity and radiation hardness, are consistent with thoseobserved for other nearby spiral and starburst galaxies. reprocessed data fromthe isocam instrument on the infrared space observatory agree with the irsdata; early reports of suppressed 6-8 micron features and enhanced 11.3 micronfeature intensity and fwhm apparently resulted from background-subtractionproblems. the nucleus does not show any pah emission but does show strongsilicate emission at 9.7 micron. furthermore, different spectral features (11.3micron pah emission, silicate emission and [neiii] 15.5 micron line emission)have distinct spatial distributions in the nuclear region: the silicateemission is strongest towards the stellar nucleus, while the pah emission peaks15 arcsec north of the nucleus. the pah feature ratios at this position areatypical with strong emission at 11.2 microns and 15-20 microns but weakemission at 6--8 microns. the nucleus itself is dominated by stellar lightgiving rise to a strong blue continuum and silicate emission.

0705.3377	the calibration of mid-infrared star formation rate indicators	with the goal of investigating the degree to which the mid-infrared emissiontraces the star formation rate (sfr), we analyze spitzer 8 um and 24 um data ofstar-forming regions in a sample of 33 nearby galaxies with availablehst/nicmos images in the paschen-alpha (1.8756 um) emission line. the galaxiesare drawn from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings) sample, andcover a range of morphologies and a factor ~10 in oxygen abundance. publisheddata on local low-metallicity starburst galaxies and luminous infrared galaxiesare also included in the analysis. both the stellar-continuum-subtracted 8 umemission and the 24 um emission correlate with the extinction-correctedpa-alpha line emission, although neither relationship is linear. simple modelsof stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproducethe observed non-linear trend of the 24 um emission versus number of ionizingphotons, including the modest deficiency of 24 um emission in the lowmetallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dustopacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. conversely, the trend of the8 um emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not wellreproduced by the same models. the 8 um emission is contributed, in largermeasure than the 24 um emission, by dust heated by non-ionizing stellarpopulations, in agreement with previous findings. two sfr calibrations, oneusing the 24 um emission and the other using a combination of the 24 um andh-alpha luminosities (kennicutt et al. 2007), are presented. no calibration ispresented for the 8 um emission, because of its significant dependence on bothmetallicity and environment. the calibrations presented here should be directlyapplicable to systems dominated by on-going star formation.

astro-ph;0504086	the vega debris disk -- a surprise from spitzer	we present high spatial resolution mid- and far-infrared images of the vegadebris disk obtained with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer (mips).the disk is well resolved and its angular size is much larger than foundpreviously. the radius of the disk is at least 43" (330 au), 70"(543 au), and105" (815 au) in extent at 24, 70 and 160 um, respectively. the disk images arecircular, smooth and without clumpiness at all three wavelengths. the radialsurface brightness profiles imply an inner boundary at a radius of 11"+/-2" (86au). assuming an amalgam of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous grains, thedisk can be modeled as an axially symmetric and geometrically thin disk, viewedface-on, with the surface particle number density following an r^-1 power law.the disk radiometric properties are consistent with a range of models usinggrains of sizes ~1 to ~50 um. we find that a ring, containing grains largerthan 180 um and at radii of 86-200 au from the star, can reproduce the observed850 um flux, while its emission does not violate the observed mips profiles.this ring could be associated with a population of larger asteroidal bodiesanalogous to our own kuiper belt. cascades of collisions starting withencounters amongthese large bodies in the ring produce the small debris that isblown outward by radiation pressure to much larger distances where we detectits thermal emission. the dust production rate is &gt;~10^15 g/s based on the mipsresults. this rate would require a very massive asteroidal reservoir for thedust to be produced in a steady state throughout vega's life. instead, wesuggest that the disk we imaged is ephemeral and that we are witnessing theaftermath of a large and relatively recent collisional event, and subsequentcollisional cascade.

astro-ph;0504622	far infrared observations of radio quasars and fr ii radio galaxies	we report mips photometry of 20 radio-loud quasars and galaxies at 24 and 70um (and of five at 160 um). we combine this sample with additional sourcesdetected in the far infrared by iras and iso for a total of 47 objects,including 23 steep spectrum type i agns: radio-loud quasars and broad lineradio galaxies; and 24 type ii agns: narrow line and weak line fr ii radiogalaxies. of this sample, the far infrared emission of all but 3c 380 appearsto be dominated by emission by dust heated by the agn and by star formation.the agn appears to contribute more than 50% of the far infrared luminosity inmost of sources. it is also expected that the material around the nucleus isoptically thin in the far infrared. thus, the measurements at these wavelengthscan be used to test the orientation-dependent unification model. as predictedby the model, the behavior of the sources is consistent with the presence of anobscuring circumnuclear torus; in fact, we find it may still have significantoptical depth at 24 um.in addition, as expected for the radio-loud quasars,there is a significant correlation between the low frequency radio (178 mhz)and the 70 um emission, two presumably isotropic indicators of nuclearactivity. this result is consistent with the simple unified scheme. however,there is a population of radio galaxies that are underluminous at 70 umcompared with the radio-loud quasars and hence are a challenge to the simpleunified model.

astro-ph;0506214	metallicity effects on mid-infrared colors and the 8 micron pah emission  in galaxies	we examine colors from 3.6 micron to 24 micron as a function of metallicity(o/h) for a sample of 34 galaxies. the galaxies range over 2 orders ofmagnitude in metallicity. they display an abrupt shift in the 8 micron to 24micron color between metallicities 1/3 to 1/5 of the solar value. the mean 8micron to 24 micron flux density ratio below and above 12 + log (o/h) = 8.2 is0.08 +/- 0.04 and 0.70 +/- 0.53, respectively. we use mid-infrared colors andspectroscopy to demonstrate that the shift is primarily due to a decrease inthe 8 micron flux density as opposed to an increase in the 24 micron fluxdensity. this result is most simply interpreted as due to a weakening at lowmetallicity of the mid-infrared emission bands usually attributed to pahs(polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) relative to the small-grain dust emission.however, existing empirical spectral energy distribution models cannot accountfor the observed short-wavelength (i.e., below 8 micron) colors of thelow-metallicity galaxies merely by reducing the strength of the pah features;some other emission source (e.g., hot dust) is required.

astro-ph;0507345	the nature of the red disk-like galaxies at high redshift: dust  attenuation and intrinsically red stellar populations	we investigate which conditions of dust attenuation and stellar populationsallow models of dusty, continuously star-forming, bulge-less disk galaxies at0.8&lt;z&lt;3.2 to meet the different colour selection criteria of high-z ``red''galaxies (e.g. rc-k&gt;5.3, ic-k&gt;4, j-k&gt;2.3). as a main novelty, we use stellarpopulation models that include the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch(tp-agb) phase of stellar evolution. the star formation rate of the modelsdeclines exponentially as a function of time, the e-folding time being longerthan 3 gyr. in addition, we use calculations of radiative transfer of thestellar and scattered radiation through different dusty interstellar media inorder to explore the wide parameter space of dust attenuation. we find thatsynthetic disks can exhibit red optical/near-infrared colours because ofreddening by dust, but only if they have been forming stars for at least about1 gyr. extremely few models barely exhibit rc-k&gt;5.3, if the inclination i=90deg and if the opacity 2*tauv&gt;6. hence, rc-k-selected galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2 mostprobably are either systems with an old, passively evolving bulge orstarbursts. synthetic disks at 1&lt;z&lt;2 exhibit 4&lt;ic-k&lt;4.8, if they are seen edgeon (i.e. at i about 90 deg) and if 2*tauv&gt;0.5. this explains the large fractionof observed, edge-on disk-like galaxies with ks&lt;19.5 and f814w-ks&gt;4. finally,models with 2&lt;z&lt;3.2 exhibit 2.3&lt;j-k&lt;3, with no bias towards i about 90 deg andfor a large range in opacity (e.g. 2*tauv&gt;1 for i about 70 deg). in conclusion,red disk-like galaxies at 0.8&lt;z&lt;3.2 may not necessarily be dustier than nearbydisk galaxies (with 0.5&lt;2*tauv&lt;2) and/or much older than about 1 gyr. thisresult is due both to a realistic description of dust attenuation and to theemission contribution by tp-agb stars...

astro-ph;0507645	infrared spectral energy distributions of nearby galaxies	the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings) is carrying out acomprehensive multi-wavelength survey on a sample of 75 nearby galaxies. the1-850um spectral energy distributions are presented using broadband imagingdata from spitzer, 2mass, iso, iras, and scuba. the infrared colors derivedfrom the globally-integrated spitzer data are generally consistent with theprevious generation of models that were developed based on global data fornormal star-forming galaxies, though significant deviations are observed.spitzer's excellent sensitivity and resolution also allow a detailedinvestigation of the infrared spectral energy distributions for variouslocations within the three large, nearby galaxies ngc3031 (m81), ngc5194 (m51),and ngc7331. strong correlations exist between the local star formation rateand the infrared colors f_nu(70um)/f_nu(160um) and f_nu(24um)/f_nu(160um),suggesting that the 24 and 70um emission are useful tracers of the local starformation activity level. preliminary evidence indicates that variations in the24um emission, and not variations in the emission from polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons at 8um, drive the variations in the f_nu(8.0um)/f_nu(24um) colorswithin ngc3031, ngc5194, and ngc7331. if the galaxy-to-galaxy variations inspectral energy distributions seen in our sample are representative of therange present at high redshift then extrapolations of total infraredluminosities and star formation rates from the observed 24um flux will beuncertain at the factor-of-five level (total range). the correspondinguncertainties using the redshifted 8.0um flux (e.g. observed 24um flux for az=2 source) are factors of 10-20. considerable caution should be used wheninterpreting such extrapolated infrared luminosities.

astro-ph;9712032	detection of extended red emisson in the diffuse interstellar medium	extended red emission (ere) has been detected in many dusty astrophysicalobjects and this raises the question: is ere present only in discrete objectsor is it an observational feature of all dust, i.e. present in the diffuseinterstellar medium? in order to answer this question, we determined the blueand red intensities of the radiation from the diffuse interstellar medium (ism)and examined the red intensity for the presence of an excess above thatexpected for scattered light. the diffuse ism blue and red intensities wereobtained by subtracting the integrated star and galaxy intensities from theblue and red measurements made by the imaging photopolarimeter (ipp) aboard thepioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft. the color of the diffuse ism was found to beredder than the pioneer intensities, contrary to that expected for scatteredlight (diffuse galactic light [dgl]). the red dgl was calculated using the bluediffuse ism intensities and the approximately invariant color of the dglcalculated with the dgl model. subtracting the calculated red dgl from the reddiffuse ism intensities resulted in the detection of an excess red intensity.this represents the likely detection of ere in the diffuse ism since h-alphaemission cannot account for the strength of this excess and the only otherknown emission process applicable to the diffuse ism is ere. thus, ere appearsto be a general characteristic of dust. from the correlation between n_hi andere intensity the ere photon conversion efficiency was estimated at 10 +/- 3%.

astro-ph;9802003	starburst-like dust extinction in the small magellanic cloud	the recent discovery that the uv dust extinction in starburst galaxies issimilar to that found in the small magellanic cloud (smc) motivated us tore-investigate the ultraviolet (uv) extinction found in the smc. we have beenable to improve significantly on previous studies by carefully choosing pairsof well matched reddened and unreddened stars. in addition, we benefited fromthe improved s/n of the newsips iue data and the larger sample of smc stars nowavailable. searching the iue final archive, we found only four suitableearly-type stars that were significantly reddened and had well matchedcomparison stars. the extinction for three of these stars is remarkablysimilar. the curves are roughly linear with 1/lambda and have no measurable2175 a bump. the fourth star has an extinction curve with a significant 2175 abump and weaker far-uv extinction. the dust along all four sightlines isthought to be local to the smc. there is no significant galactic foregroundcomponent. the first three stars lie in the smc bar and the line-of-sight foreach of them passes through regions of recent star formation. the fourth starbelongs to the smc wing and its line-of-sight passes though a much morequiescent region. thus, the behavior of the dust extinction in the smc supportsa dependence of dust properties on star formation activity. however, otherenvironmental factors (such as galactic metallicity) must also be important.dust in the 30 dor region of the lmc, where much more active star formation ispresent, does not share the extreme extinction properties seen in smc dust.

astro-ph;9802273	the spectroscopic orbit of the evolved binary hd 197770	we have used spectra taken between 1992 and 1997 to derive the spectroscopicorbit of the eclipsing double-lined spectroscopic binary hd 197770. this binaryhas a period of 99.69 +/- 0.02 days and k amplitudes of 31.2 +/- 0.8 and 47.1+/- 0.4 km s^{-1} for components a &amp; b, respectively. the msin^{3}i values fora &amp; b are 2.9 and 1.9, respectively, and are close to the actual masses due tothe eclipsing nature of this binary. both components of hd 197770 have spectraltypes near b2 iii. this means both components are undermassive by about afactor of five and, thus, evolved stars. additional evidence of the evolvednature of hd 197770 is found in 25, 60, and 100 micron iras images of hd197770. these images show 2 apparent shells centered on hd 197770; a bright 60micron shell with a 14' diameter and a larger (1.2 degeree diameter)bubble-like feature. at least one of the components of hd 197770 is likely tobe a post-agb star.

astro-ph;9805006	silicon nanoparticles: source of extended red emission?	we have reviewed the characteristics of the extended red emission (ere) asobserved in many dusty astronomical environments, in particular, the diffuseinterstellar medium of the galaxy. the spectral nature and the photonconversion efficiency of the ere identify the underlying process as highlyefficient photoluminescence by an abundant component of interstellar dust. wehave compared the photoluminescence properties of a variety of carbon- andsilicon-based materials proposed as sources for the ere with theobservationally established constraints. we found that silicon nanoparticlesprovide the best match to the spectrum and the efficiency requirement of theere. if present in interstellar space with an abundance sufficient to explainthe intensity of the ere, silicon nanoparticles will also contribute to theinterstellar 9.7 micron si-o stretch feature in absorption, to the near- andmid-ir nonequilibrium thermal background radiation, and to the continuumextinction in the near- and far-uv. about 36% of the interstellar silicondepleted into the dust phase would be needed in the form of siliconnanoparticles, amounting to less than 5% of the interstellar dust mass. wepropose that silicon nanoparticles form through the nucleation of sio inoxygen-rich stellar mass outflows and that they represent an importantsmall-grain component of the interstellar dust spectrum.

astro-ph;9902043	the dusty starburst nucleus of m33	we have thoroughly characterized the ultraviolet to near-infrared (0.15 - 2.2micron) spectral energy distribution (sed) of the central parsec of the m33nucleus through new infrared photometry and optical/near-infrared spectroscopy,combined with ultraviolet/optical observations from the literature and the hstarchive. the sed shows evidence for a significant level of attenuation, whichwe model through a monte carlo radiative transfer code as a shell of clumpymilky way-type dust (tau_v ~ 2 +/- 1). the discovery of milky way-type dust(with a strong 2175 a bump) internal to the m33 nucleus is different fromprevious work which has found smc-like dust (no bump) near starburst regions.the amount by which dust can be processed may be related to the mass and age ofthe starburst as well as the extent to which the dust can shield itself. ourstarburst models include the effects of this dust and can fit the sed if thenucleus was the site of a moderate (~10^8 l_sun at 10 myrs) episode of coevalstar formation about 70 myrs ago. this result is quite different from previousstudies which resorted to multiple stellar populations (between 2 and 7)attenuated by either no or very little internal dust. the m33 nuclear starburstis remarkably similar to an older version (70 myr versus 10 myr) of theultra-compact starburst in the center of the milky way.

0811.4190	the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey: a high-resolution  spectroscopy anthology	high resolution mid-infrared spectra are presented for 155 nuclear andextranuclear regions from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings).the fluxes for nine atomic forbidden and three molecular hydrogen mid-infraredemission lines are also provided, along with upper limits in key lines forinfrared-faint targets. the sings sample shows a wide range in the ratio of[siii]18.71um/[siii]33.48um, but the average ratio of the ensemble indicates atypical interstellar electron density of 300-400 cm^{-3} on ~23"x15" scales and500-600 cm^{-3} using ~11"x9" apertures, independent of whether the regionprobed is a star-forming nuclear, a star-forming extranuclear, or an agnenvironment. evidence is provided that variations in gas-phase metallicity playan important role in driving variations in radiation field hardness, asindicated by [neiii]15.56um/[neii]12.81um, for regions powered by starformation. conversely, the radiation hardness for galaxy nuclei powered byaccretion around a massive black hole is independent of metal abundance.furthermore, for metal-rich environments agn are distinguishable fromstar-forming regions by significantly larger [neiii]15.56um/[neii]12.81umratios. finally, [feii]25.99um/[neii]12.81um versus [siii]34.82um/[siii]33.48umalso provides an empirical method for discerning agn from normal star-formingsources. however, similar to [neiii]15.56um/[neii]12.81um, these mid-infraredline ratios lose their agn/star-formation diagnostic powers for very lowmetallicity star-forming systems with hard radiation fields.
