0903.0818	segue 2: a prototype of the population of satellites of satellites	we announce the discovery of a new milky way satellite segue 2 found in thedata of the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration (segue).we followed this up with deeper imaging and spectroscopy on the multiple mirrortelescope. from this, we derive a luminosity of m_v = -2.5, a half-light radiusof 34 pc and a systemic velocity of -40$ km/s. our mmt data also providesevidence for a stream around segue 2 at a similar heliocentric velocity, andthe segue data show that it is also present in neighboring fields. we resolvethe velocity dispersion of segue 2 as 3.4 km/s and the possible stream as about7 km/s. this object shows points of comparison with other recent discoveries,segue 1, boo ii and coma. we speculate that all four objects may berepresentatives of a population of satellites of satellites -- survivors ofaccretion events that destroyed their larger but less dense parents. they arelikely to have formed at redshifts z &gt; 10 and are good candidates for fossilsof the reionization epoch.

0706.2627	the tidal tails of ngc 5466	the study of substructure in the stellar halo of the milky way has made a lotof progress in recent years, especially with the advent of surveys like thesloan digital sky survey. here, we study the newly discovered tidal tails ofthe galactic globular cluster ngc 5466. by means of numerical simulations, wereproduce the shape, direction and surface density of the tidal tails, as wellas the structural and kinematical properties of the present-day ngc 5466.although its tails are very extended in sdss data (&gt; 45 degrees), ngc 5466 isonly losing mass slowly at the present epoch and so can survive for probably afurther hubble time. the effects of tides at perigalacticon and disc crossingare the dominant causes of the slow dissolution of ngc 5466, accounting forabout 60 % of the mass loss over the course of its evolution. the morphology ofthe tails provides a constraint on the proper motion -- the observationallydetermined proper motion has to be refined (within the stated error margins) tomatch the location of the tidal tails.

0706.2687	the luminosity function of the milky way satellites	we quantify the detectability of stellar milky way satellites in the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) data release 5. we show that the effective searchvolumes for the recently discovered sdss--satellites depend strongly on theirluminosity, with their maximum distance, $d_{max}$, substantially smaller thanthe milky way halo's virial radius. calculating the maximum accessible volume,$v_{max}$, for all faint detected satellites, allows the calculation of theluminosity function for milky way satellite galaxies, accounting quantitativelyfor their detectability. we find that the number density of satellite galaxiescontinues to rise towards low luminosities, but may flatten at $m_v \sim -5$;within the uncertainties, the luminosity function can be described by a singlepower law $dn/dm_{v}= 10 \times 10^{0.1 (m_v+5)}$, spanning luminosities from$m_v=-2$ all the way to the luminosity of the large magellanic cloud. comparingthese results to several semi-analytic galaxy formation models, we find thattheir predictions differ significantly from the data: either the shape of theluminosity function, or the surface brightness distributions of the models, donot match.

0904.1012	kinematics of sdss subdwarfs: structure and substructure of the milky  way halo	we construct a new sample of ~1700 solar neighbourhood halo subdwarfs fromthe sloan digital sky survey, selected using a reduced proper motion diagram.radial velocities come from the sdss spectra and proper motions from thelight-motion curve catalogue of bramich et al. (2008). using a photometricparallax relation to estimate distances gives us the full phase-spacecoordinates. typical velocity errors are in the range 30-50 km/s. this halosample is one of the largest constructed to-date and the disc contamination isat a level of &lt; 1 per cent. this enables us to calculate the halo velocitydispersion to excellent accuracy. we find that the velocity dispersion tensoris aligned in spherical polar coordinates and that (sigma_r, sigma_phi,sigma_theta) = (143 \pm 2, 82 \pm 2, 77 \pm 2) km/s. the stellar halo exhibitsno net rotation, although the distribution of v_phi shows tentative evidencefor asymmetry. the kinematics are consistent with a mildly flattened stellardensity falling with distance like r^{-3.75}. using the full phase-spacecoordinates, we look for signs of kinematic substructure in the stellar halo.we find evidence for four discrete overdensities localised in angular momentumand suggest that they may be possible accretion remnants. the most prominent isthe solar neighbourhood stream previously identified by helmi et al. (1999),but the remaining three are new. one of these overdensities is potentiallyassociated with a group of four globular clusters (ngc5466, ngc6934, m2 andm13) and raises the possibility that these could have been accreted as part ofa much larger progenitor.

0906.0498	substructure revealed by rr lyraes in sdss stripe 82	we present an analysis of the substructure revealed by 407 rr lyraes in sloandigital sky survey (sdss) stripe 82. period estimates are determined to highaccuracy using a string-length method. a subset of 178 rr lyraes withspectrally derived metallicities are employed to derivemetallicity-period-amplitude relations, which are then used to findmetallicities and distances for the entire sample. the rr lyraes lie between 5and 115 kpc from the galactic center. they are divided into subsets of 316 rrabtypes and 91 rrc types based on their period, colour and metallicity. thedensity distribution is not smooth, but dominated by clumps and substructure.samples of 55 and 237 rr lyraes associated with the sagittarius stream and thehercules-aquila cloud respectively are identified. hence, ~ 70 % of the rrlyraes in stripe 82 belong to known substructure. there is a sharp break in thedensity distribution at galactocentric radii of 40 kpc, reflecting the factthat the dominant substructure in stripe 82 - the hercules-aquila cloud and thesagittarius stream - lies within 40 kpc. in fact, almost 60 % of all the rrlyraes in stripe 82 are associated with the hercules-aquila cloud alone, whichemphasises its pre-eminence. additionally, evidence of a new and distantsubstructure - the pisces overdensity - is found, consisting of 28 faint rrlyraes centered on galactic coordinates (80 deg, -55 deg) and with distances of~ 80 kpc. the total stellar mass in the pisces overdensity is ~10000 solarmasses and its metallicity is [fe/h] ~ -1.5.

0906.3669	the origin of segue 1	we apply the optimal filter technique to sloan digital sky survey photometryaround segue 1 and find that the outer parts of the cluster are distorted.there is strong evidence for ~ 1 degree elongations of extra-tidal stars,extending both eastwards and southwestwards of the cluster. the extensions havesimilar differential hess diagrams to segue 1. a kolmogorov-smirnov testsuggests a high probability that both come from the same parent distribution.the location of segue 1 is close to crossings of the tidal wraps of thesagittarius stream. by extracting blue horizontal branch stars from sloan'sspectral database, two kinematic features are isolated and identified withdifferent wraps of the sagittarius stream. we show that segue 1 is moving witha velocity that is close to one of the wraps. at this location, we estimatethat there are enough sagittarius stars, indistinguishable from segue 1 stars,to inflate the velocity dispersion and hence the mass-to-light ratio. all theavailable evidence is consistent with the interpretation that segue 1 is a starcluster, originally from the sagittarius galaxy, and now dissolving in themilky way.

0908.3489	a photometric and spectroscopic study of the new dwarf spheroidal galaxy  in hercules	our aim is to provide as clean and as complete a sample as possible of redgiant branch stars that are members of the hercules dsph galaxy. with thissample we explore the velocity dispersion and the metallicity of the system.stromgren photometry and multi-fibre spectroscopy are combined to provideinformation about the evolutionary state of the stars (via the stromgren c_1index) and their radial velocities. based on this information we have selecteda clean sample of red giant branch stars, and show that foregroundcontamination by milky way dwarf stars can greatly distort the results. ourfinal sample consists of 28 red giant branch stars in the hercules dsph galaxy.based on these stars we find a mean photometric metallicity of -2.35 dex whichis consistent with previous studies. we find evidence for an abundance spread.using those stars for which we have determined radial velocities we find asystemic velocity of 45.2 km/s with a dispersion of 3.72 km/s, this is lowerthan values found in the literature. furthermore we identify the horizontalbranch and estimate the mean magnitude of the horizontal branch of the herculesdsph galaxy to be v_0=21.17, which corresponds to a distance of 147 kpc. wehave shown that a proper cleaning of the sample results in a smaller value forthe velocity dispersion of the system. this has implications for galaxyproperties derived from such velocity dispersions.

1004.5247	the ogle view of microlensing towards the magellanic clouds. ii. ogle-ii  smc data	the primary goal of this paper is to provide the evidence that can eitherprove or falsify the hypothesis that dark matter in the galactic halo can clumpinto stellar-mass compact objects. if such objects existed, they would act aslenses to external sources in the magellanic clouds, giving rise to anobservable effect of microlensing. we present the results of our search forsuch events, based on the data from the second phase of the ogle survey(1996-2000) towards the smc. the data set we used is comprised of 2.1 millionmonitored sources distributed over an area of 2.4 square degrees. we found onlyone microlensing event candidate, however its poor quality light curve limitedour discussion on the exact distance to the lensing object.  given a single event, taking the blending (crowding of stars) into accountfor the detection efficiency simulations, and deriving the hst-corrected numberof monitored stars, the microlensing optical depth is tau=(1.55+-1.55)10e-7.this result is consistent with the expected smc self-lensing signal, with noneed of introducing dark matter microlenses. rejecting the unconvincing eventleads to the upper limit on the fraction of dark matter in the form of machosto f&lt;20 per cent for deflectors' masses around 0.4 msun and f&lt;11 per cent formasses between 0.003 and 0.2 msun (95 per cent confidence limit). our resultindicates that the milky way's dark matter is unlikely to be clumpy and formcompact objects in the sub-solar-mass range.

1008.3067	rotation of halo populations in the milky way and m31	we search for signs of rotation in the subsystems of the milky way and m31that are defined by their satellite galaxies, their globular clusterpopulations, and their bhb stars. a set of simple distribution functions areintroduced to describe anisotropic and rotating stellar populations embedded indark haloes of approximate navarro-frenk-white form. the bhb stars in the milkyway halo exhibit a dichotomy between a prograde rotating, comparativelymetal-rich component ([fe/h] &gt; -2) and a retrograde rotating, comparativelymetal-poor ([fe/h] &lt; -2) component. the prograde metal-rich population may beassociated with the accretion of a massive satellite (~ 10^9 solar masses). themetal-poor population may characterise the primordial stellar halo and the netretrograde rotation could then reflect an underestimate in our adopted localstandard of rest circular velocity theta_0. if theta_0 is ~ 240 km/s then themetal-poor component has no rotation and there is a net prograde rotationsignal of ~45 km/s in the metal-rich component. there is reasonable evidencethat the milky way globular cluster and satellite galaxy systems are rotatingwith &lt;v_phi&gt; ~50 km/s and &lt;v_phi&gt; ~ 40 km/s respectively. furthermore, astronger signal is found for the satellite galaxies when the angular momentumvector of the satellites is inclined with respect to the normal of the disc.the dwarf spheroidal satellites of m31 exhibit prograde rotation relative tothe m31 disc with &lt;v_phi&gt; ~ 40 km/s. we postulate that this group of dwarfspheroidals may share a common origin. we also find strong evidence forsystemic rotation in the globular clusters of m31 particularly for the mostmetal-rich.

1101.0816	mismatch and misalignment: dark haloes and satellites of disc galaxies	(abridged) we study the phase-space distribution of satellite galaxiesassociated with late-type galaxies in the gimic suite of simulations. gimicconsists of re-simulations of 5 cosmologically representative regions from themillennium simulation, which have higher resolution and incorporate baryonicphysics. whilst the disc of the galaxy is well aligned with the inner regions(r ~ 0.1r_200) of the dark matter halo, both in shape and angular momentum,there can be substantial misalignments at larger radii (r ~ r_200).misalignments of &gt; 45 deg are seen in ~ 30% of our sample. we find that thesatellite population aligns with the shape (and angular momentum) of the outerdark matter halo. however, the alignment with the galaxy is weak owing to themismatch between the disc and dark matter halo. roughly 20% of the satellitesystems with ten bright galaxies within r_200 exhibit a polar spatial alignmentwith respect to the galaxy --- an orientation reminiscent of the classicalsatellites of the milky way. we find that a small fraction (~10%) of satellitesystems show evidence for rotational support which we attribute to groupinfall. there is a bias towards satellites on prograde orbits relative to thespin of the dark matter halo (and to a lesser extent with the angular momentumof the disc). this preference towards co-rotation is stronger in the innerregions of the halo where the most massive satellites accreted at relativelyearly times are located. we attribute the anisotropic spatial distribution andangular momentum bias of the satellites at z=0 to their directional accretionalong the major axes of the dark matter halo. the satellite galaxies have beenaccreted relatively recently compared to the dark matter mass and haveexperienced less phase-mixing and relaxation --- the memory of their accretionhistory can remain intact to z=0.

1104.3220	the milky way stellar halo out to 40 kpc : squashed, broken but smooth	we introduce a new maximum likelihood method to model the density profile ofblue horizontal branch and blue straggler stars and apply it to the sloandigital sky survey data release 8 (dr8) photometric catalogue. there are alarge number (20,000) of these tracers available over an impressive 14,000square degrees in both northern and southern galactic hemispheres, and theyprovide a robust measurement of the shape of the milky way stellar halo. aftermasking out stars in the vicinity of the virgo overdensity and the sagittariusstream, the data are consistent with a smooth, oblate stellar halo with adensity that follows a broken power-law. the best fitting model has an innerslope = 2.3 and an outer slope = 4.6, together with a break radius occurring at27 kpc and a constant halo flattening (that is, ratio of minor axis to majoraxis) of q = 0.6. although a broken power-law describes the density fall-offmost adequately, it is also well fit by an einasto profile. there is no strongevidence for variations in flattening with radius, or for triaxiality of thestellar halo.

1105.4102	accurate stellar kinematics at faint magnitudes: application to the  bootes~i dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we develop, implement and characterise an enhanced data reduction approachwhich delivers precise, accurate, radial velocities from moderate resolutionspectroscopy with the fibre-fed vlt/flames+giraffe facility. this facility,with appropriate care, delivers radial velocities adequate to resolve theintrinsic velocity dispersions of the very faint dsph dwarf galaxies.importantly, repeated measurements let us reliably calibrate our individualvelocity errors ($0.2 \leq \delta_v\leq 5$ km s$^{-1}$) and directly detectstars with variable radial velocities. we show, by application to the bootes-1dwarf spheroidal, that the intrinsic velocity dispersion of this system issignificantly below 6.5\,km/s reported by previous studies. our data favor atwo-population model of bootes-1, consisting of a majority `cold' stellarcomponent, with velocity dispersion $2.4^{+0.9}_{-0.5}$\,km/s, and a minority`hot' stellar component, with velocity dispersion $\sim 9$\,km/s, although wecan not completely rule out a single component distribution with velocitydispersion $4.6^{0.8}_{-0.6}$\,km/s. we speculate this complex velocitydistribution actually reflects the distribution of velocity anisotropy inbootes-1, which is a measure of its formation processes.

1110.0833	elliptical galaxy masses out to five effective radii: the realm of dark  matter	we estimate the masses of elliptical galaxies out to five effective radiiusing planetary nebulae and globular clusters as tracers. a sample of 15elliptical galaxies with a broad variation in mass is compiled from theliterature. a distribution function-maximum likelihood analysis is used toestimate the overall potential slope, normalisation and velocity anisotropy ofthe tracers. we assume power-law profiles for the potential and tracer densityand a constant velocity anisotropy. the derived potential power-law indices liein between the isothermal and keplerian regime and vary with mass: there istentative evidence that the less massive galaxies have steeper potentialprofiles than the more massive galaxies. we use stellar mass-to-light ratiosappropriate for either a chabrier/ktg (kroupa, tout &amp; gilmore) or salpeterinitial mass function to disentangle the stellar and dark matter components.the fraction of dark matter within five effective radii increases with mass, inagreement with several other studies. we employ simple models to show that acombination of star formation efficiency and baryon extent are able to accountfor this trend. these models are in good agreement with both our measurementsout to five effective radii and recent slacs measurements within one effectiveradii when a universal chabrier/ktg initial mass function is adopted.

1201.5491	the radial distribution of galaxies in groups and clusters	we present a new catalogue of 55,121 groups and clusters centred on luminousred galaxies from sdss dr7 in the redshift range 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.4. we provide halomass estimates for each of these groups derived from a calibration between theoptical richness of bright galaxies (m_r&lt;-20.5) within 1 mpc, and x-ray-derivedmass for a small subset of 129 groups and clusters with x-ray measurements. wederive the mean (stacked) surface number density profiles of galaxies as afunction of total halo mass in different mass bins. we find that derivedprofiles can be well-described by a projected nfw profile with a concentrationparameter (&lt;c&gt;~2.6) that is approximately a factor of two lower than that ofthe dark matter (as predicted by n-body cosmological simulations) and nearlyindependent of halo mass. interestingly, in spite of the difference in shapebetween the galaxy and dark matter radial distributions, both exhibit a highdegree of self-similarity. a self-consistent comparison to several recentsemi-analytic models of galaxy formation indicates that: (1) beyond ~0.3 r_500current models are able to reproduce both the shape and normalisation of thesatellite profiles; and (2) within ~0.3 r_500 the predicted profiles aresensitive to the details of the satellite-bcg merger timescale calculation. theformer is a direct result of the models being tuned to match the global galaxyluminosity function combined with the assumption that the satellite galaxies donot suffer significant tidal stripping, even though their surrounding darkmatter haloes can be removed through this process. combining our results withmeasurements of the intracluster light should provide a way to informtheoretical models on the efficacy of the tidal stripping and mergingprocesses.

1205.6203	the cold veil of the milky way stellar halo	we build a sample of distant (d &gt; 80 kpc) stellar halo stars with measuredradial velocities. faint ($20 &lt; g &lt;22$) candidate blue horizontal branch (bhb)stars were selected using the deep, but wide, multi-epoch sloan digital skysurvey photometry. follow-up spectroscopy for these a-type stars was performedusing the vlt-fors2 instrument. we classify stars according to their balmerline profiles, and find 7 are bona fide bhb stars and 31 are blue stragglers(bs). owing to the magnitude range of our sample, even the intrinsicallyfainter bs stars can reach out to d ~ 90 kpc. we complement this sample ofa-type stars with intrinsically brighter, intermediate-age, asymptotic giantbranch stars. a set of 4 distant cool carbon stars is compiled from theliterature and we perform spectroscopic follow-up on a further 4 n-type carbonstars using the wht-isis instrument. altogether, this provides us with thelargest sample to date of individual star tracers out to r ~ 150 kpc. we findthat the radial velocity dispersion of these tracers falls rapidly at largedistances and is surprisingly cold (sigma_r ~ 50-60 km/s) between 100-150 kpc.relating the measured radial velocities to the mass of the milky way requiresknowledge of the (unknown) tracer density profile and anisotropy at thesedistances. nonetheless, by assuming the stellar halo stars between 50-150 kpchave a moderate density fall-off (with power-law slope alpha &lt; 5) and are onradial orbits (sigma^2_t/sigma^2_r &lt; 1), we infer that the mass within 150 kpcis less than 10^12 m_solar and suggest it probably lies in the range (5-10) x10^11 m_solar. we discuss the implications of such a low mass for the milkyway.

1210.4929	broken and unbroken: the milky way and m31 stellar haloes	we use the bullock &amp; johnston suite of simulations to study the densityprofiles of l*-type galaxy stellar haloes. observations of the milky way andm31 stellar haloes show contrasting results: the milky way has a `broken'profile, where the density falls off more rapidly beyond ~ 25 kpc, while m31has a smooth profile out to 100 kpc with no obvious break. simulated stellarhaloes, built solely by the accretion of dwarf galaxies, also exhibit thisbehavior: some haloes have breaks, while others don't. the presence or absenceof a break in the stellar halo profile can be related to the accretion historyof the galaxy. we find that a break radius is strongly related to the build upof stars at apocentres. we relate these findings to observations, and find thatthe `break' in the milky way density profile is likely associated with arelatively early (~ 6-9 gyr ago) and massive accretion event. in contrast, theabsence of a break in the m31 stellar halo profile suggests that its accretedsatellites have a wide range of apocentres. hence, it is likely that m31 hashad a much more prolonged accretion history than the milky way.

1301.7069	precession of the sagittarius stream	using a variety of stellar tracers -- blue horizontal branch stars,main-sequence turn-off stars and red giants -- we follow the path of thesagittarius (sgr) stream across the sky in sloan digital sky survey data. ourstudy presents new sgr debris detections, accurate distances and line-of-sightvelocities that together help to shed new light on the puzzle of the sgr tails.for both the leading and the trailing tail, we trace the points of theirmaximal extent, or apo-centric distances, and find that they lie at $r^l$ =47.8 $\pm$ 0.5 kpc and $r^t$ = 102.5 $\pm$ 2.5 kpc respectively. the angulardifference between the apo-centres is 93.2 $\pm$ 3.5 deg, which is smaller thanpredicted for logarithmic haloes. such differential orbital precession can bemade consistent with models of the milky way in which the dark matter densityfalls more quickly with radius. however, currently, no existing sgr disruptionsimulation can explain the entirety of the observational data. based on itsposition and radial velocity, we show that the unusually large globular clusterngc 2419 can be associated with the sgr trailing stream. we measure theprecession of the orbital plane of the sgr debris in the milky way potentialand show that, surprisingly, sgr debris in the primary (brighter) tails evolvesdifferently to the secondary (fainter) tails, both in the north and the south.

1306.2948	the dark matter halo concentration and stellar initial mass function of  a cassowary group	we exploit the group environment of the cambridge sloan survey of wide arcsin the sky (cassowary) z=0.3 lens j2158+0257 to measure the group dynamicalmass as a complement to the central dynamical and lensing mass constraints.follow-up spectroscopy of candidate group members is performed using vlt/fors2.from the resulting n=21 confirmed members we measure the group dynamical massby calibrating an analytic tracer mass estimator with cosmological simulations.the luminosity weighted line-of-sight velocity dispersion and the einsteinradius of the lens are used as mass probes in the inner regions of the galaxy.combining these three observational probes allows us to independently constrainthe mass and concentration of the dark matter halo, in addition to the totalstellar mass of the central galaxy. we find a dark matter halo in remarkablygood agreement with simulations (log_10 m_200/m_sun = 14.2 +/- 0.2, c_200 = 4.4(+1.6, -1.4)) and a stellar mass-to-light ratio which favors a salpeter initialmass function ((m/l)* = 5.7 +/- 1.2). our measurement of a normal haloconcentration suggests that there is no discrepancy between simulations andobservations at the group mass scale. this is in contrast to the cluster massscale for which a number of studies have claimed over-concentrated halos. whilethe halo mass is robustly determined, and the halo concentration is notsignificantly affected by systematics, the resulting stellar mass-to-lightratio is sensitive to the choice of stellar parameters, such as density profileand velocity anisotropy.

0801.2657	modelling the dynamical evolution of the bootes dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we investigate a wide range of possible evolutionary histories for therecently discovered bootes dwarf spheroidal galaxy, a milky way satellite. bymeans of n-body simulations we follow the evolution of possible progenitorgalaxies of bootes for a variety of orbits in the gravitational potential ofthe milky way. the progenitors considered cover the range from dark-matter-freestar clusters to massive, dark-matter dominated outcomes of cosmologicalsimulations. for each type of progenitor and orbit we compare the observableproperties of the remnant after 10 gyr with those of bootes observed today. ourstudy suggests that the progenitor of bootes must have been, and remains now,dark matter dominated. in general our models are unable to reproduce theobserved high velocity dispersion in bootes without dark matter. our models donot support time-dependent tidal effects as a mechanism able to inflatesignificantly the internal velocity dispersion. as none of our initiallyspherical models is able to reproduce the elongation of bootes, our resultssuggest that the progenitor of bootes may have had some intrinsic flattening.although the focus of the present paper is the bootes dwarf spheroidal, thesemodels may be of general relevance to understanding the structure, stabilityand dark matter content of all dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

1308.6286	are group- and cluster-scale dark matter halos over-concentrated?	we investigate the relationship between the halo mass, m_200, andconcentration, c, for a sample of 26 group- and cluster-scale stronggravitational lenses. in contrast with previous results, we find that thesesystems are only ~ 0.1 dex more over-concentrated than similar-mass halos fromdark matter simulations; the concentration of a halo with m_200 = 10^14 m_sunis log c = 0.78\pm0.05, while simulations of halos with this mass at similarredshifts (z ~ 0.4) predict log c ~ 0.56 - 0.71. we also find that we areunable to make informative inference on the slope of the m_200-c relation inspite of our large sample size; we note that the steep slopes found in previousstudies tend to follow the slope in the covariance between m_200 and c,indicating that these results may be measuring the scatter in the data ratherthan the intrinsic signal. furthermore, we conclude that our inability toconstrain the m_200-c slope is due to a limited range of halo masses, asdetermined by explicitly modelling our halo mass distribution, and we suggestthat other studies may be producing biased results by using an incorrectdistribution for their halo masses.

1309.1183	the similarity of the stellar mass fractions of galaxy groups and  clusters	we employ a large sample of 20171 optically-selected groups and clusters at0.15 &lt; z &lt; 0.4 in the sdss to investigate how the stacked stellar mass fractionvaries across a wide range of total mass, $m_{500}$. our study improves uponprevious observational studies in a number of important ways, including havinga much larger sample size, an explicit inclusion of the intracluster light(icl) component, and a thorough examination of the accuracy of our total massestimates via comparisons to simulations and weak lensing observations. we findthat the stellar mass fraction depends only weakly on total mass and that thecontribution of icl to the total stellar mass fraction is significant(typically 20-40 per cent). both of these findings are in excellent accordancewith the predictions of cosmological simulations. under the assumption of achabrier (salpeter) imf, the derived star formation efficiency($f_{star}$/$f_{b}$, where $f_b=\omega_b/\omega_m$) is relatively low at 8 percent (14 per cent) and is consistent with the global star formation efficiencyof semi-analytic models that reproduce the galaxy stellar mass function. whenour measured stellar mass fractions are combined with the observed relationbetween hot gas mass fraction and total mass from x-ray observations, ourresults imply that galaxy groups have significantly lower baryon fractions thanmassive clusters. ejection of gas due to energetic agn feedback (most likely athigh redshift) provides a plausible mechanism for explaining the trends weobserve.

1403.3406	atlas lifts the cup: discovery of a new milky way satellite in crater	we announce the discovery of a new galactic companion found in data from theeso vst atlas survey, and followed up with deep imaging on the 4m williamherschel telescope. the satellite is located in the constellation of crater(the cup) at a distance of $\sim$ 170 kpc. its half-light radius is $r_h=30$ pcand its luminosity is $m_v=-5.5$. the bulk of its stellar population is old andmetal-poor. we would probably have classified the newly discovered satellite asan extended globular cluster were it not for the presence of a handful of blueloop stars and a sparsely populated red clump. the existence of the core heliumburning population implies that star-formation occurred in crater perhaps asrecently as 400 myr ago. no globular cluster has ever accomplished the feat ofprolonging its star-formation by several gyrs. therefore, if our hypothesisthat the blue bright stars in crater are blue loop giants is correct, the newsatellite should be classified as a dwarf galaxy with unusual properties. notethat only ten degrees to the north of crater, two ultra-faint galaxies leo ivand v orbit the galaxy at approximately the same distance. this hints that allthree satellites may once have been closely associated before falling togetherinto the milky way halo.

1405.4290	the catalina surveys periodic variable star catalog	we present ~47,000 periodic variables found during the analysis of 5.4million variable star candidates within a 20,000 square degree region coveredby the catalina surveys data release-1 (csdr1). combining these variables withtype-ab rr lyrae from our previous work, we produce an on-line catalogcontaining periods, amplitudes, and classifications for ~61,000 periodicvariables. by cross-matching these variables with those from prior surveys, wefind that &gt; 90% of the ~8,000 known periodic variables in the survey region arerecovered. for these sources we find excellent agreement between our catalogand prior values of luminosity, period and amplitude, as well asclassification.  we investigate the rate of confusion between objects classified as contactbinaries and type-c rr lyrae (rrc's) based on periods, colours, amplitudes,metalicities, radial velocities and surface gravities. we find that no morethan few percent of these variables in these classes are misidentified. byderiving distances for this clean sample of ~5,500 rrc's, we trace the path ofthe sagittarius tidal streams within the galactic halo. selecting 146outer-halo rrc's with sdss radial velocities, we confirm the presence of acoherent halo structure that is inconsistent with current n-body simulations ofthe sagittarius tidal stream. we also find numerous long-period variables thatare very likely associated within the sagittarius tidal streams system.  based on the examination of 31,000 contact binary light curves we findevidence for two subgroups exhibiting irregular lightcurves. one subgrouppresents significant variations in mean brightness that are likely due tochromospheric activity. the other subgroup shows stable modulations over morethan a thousand days and thereby provides evidence that the o'connell effect isnot due to stellar spots.

1406.2243	"skinny milky way, please", says sagittarius	motivated by recent observations of the sagittarius stream, we devise a rapidalgorithm to generate faithful representations of the centroids of stellartidal streams formed in a disruption of a progenitor of an arbitrary mass in anarbitrary potential. our method works by releasing swarms of test particles atthe lagrange points around the satellite and subsequently evolving them in acombined potential of the host and the progenitor. we stress that the action ofthe progenitor's gravity is crucial to making streams that look almostindistinguishable from the n-body realizations, as indeed ours do. the methodis tested on mock stream data in three different milky way potentials withincreasing complexity, and is shown to deliver unbiased inference on thegalactic mass distribution out to large radii. when applied to the observationsof the sagittarius stream, our model gives a natural explanation of thestream's apocentric distances and the differential orbital precession. we,therefore, provide a new independent measurement of the galactic massdistribution beyond 50 kpc. the sagittarius stream model favours a light milkyway with the mass 4.1 +/- 0.4 x 10^11 m_sun at 100 kpc, which can beextrapolated to 5.6 +/- 1.2 x 10^11 m_sun at 200 kpc. such a low mass for themilky way galaxy is in good agreement with estimates from the kinematics ofhalo stars and from the satellite galaxies (once leo i is removed from thesample). it entirely removes the "too big to fail problem".

1406.3352	the alpha-element knee of the sagittarius stream	we employ abundances from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the sloanextension for galactic understanding and exploration (segue) to study thealpha-element distribution of the stellar members of the sagittarius stream. totest the reliability of sdss/segue abundances for the study of sagittarius, weselect high-likelihood samples tracing the different components of the milkyway, and recover known literature alpha-element distributions. using selectioncriteria based on the spatial position, radial velocity, distance and coloursof individual stars, we obtain a robust sample of sagittarius-stream stars. thealpha-element distribution of the sagittarius stream forms a narrow sequence atintermediate metallicities with a clear turn-down, consistent with the presenceof an alpha-element "knee". this is the first time that the alpha-element kneeof the sagittarius dwarf galaxy has been detected. fitting a toy model to ourdata, we determine that the alpha-knee in sagittarius takes place at[fe/h]=-1.27pm0.05, only slightly less metal-poor than the knee in the milkyway. this indicates that a small number of sagittarius-like galaxies could havecontributed significantly to the build-up of the milky way's stellar halosystem at ancient times.

1410.7653	discovery of $\sim$ 9,000 new rr lyrae in the southern catalina surveys	we present the results of a deep, wide-area variability survey in thesouthern hemisphere, the first of its kind. as part of the catalina skysurveys, the siding spring survey (sss) has covered $14,800$ square degrees inthe declination range of $-75^{\circ}\leq\delta\leq-15^{\circ}$. to mine theenormous sss dataset efficiently we have developed two algorithms: automaticperiod selection (aps) and automatic fourier decomposition (afd), which aim tosharpen the period estimation and produce robust lightcurve models. armed withthe aps and afd outputs we classify $10,540$ ab-type rr lyrae (rrab) stars($\sim$90% of which are new) across the southern sky. as well as the positionalinformation we supply photometric metallicities, and unreddened distances.  for the rrab stars in the halo, a study of the photometric metallicitydistribution reveals a nearly gaussian shape with a mean metallicity of ${\rm[fe/h]}=-1.4$ dex and a dispersion of $0.3$ dex. a spatial study of the rrabmetallicities shows no significant radial gradient in the first $\sim7$ kpcfrom the galaxy center. however, further out, a small negative gradient isclearly present. this is complemented by a very obvious correlation of the meanrr lyrae metallicity with distance above the galactic plane, $z$. we have alsocarried out an initial substructure search using the discovered rrab, andpresent the properties of the candidates with significance greater than $2\sigma$. most prominent among these is a southern extension of the sagittariusdwarf galaxy's stream system, reaching down to declinations $\sim -40\deg$.

1412.5649	the rich are different: evidence from the rave survey for stellar radial  migration	using the radial velocity experiment fourth data release (rave dr4), and anew metallicity calibration that will be also taken into account in the futurerave dr5, we investigate the existence and the properties of super-solarmetallicity stars ([m/h] &gt; +0.1 dex) in the sample, and in particular in thesolar neighbourhood. we find that rave is rich in super-solar metallicitystars, and that the local metallicity distribution function declines remarkablyslowly up to +0.4 dex. our results show that the kinematics and heightdistributions of the super-solar metallicity stars are identical to those ofthe [m/h] &lt; 0 thin-disc giants that we presume were locally manufactured. theeccentricities of the super-solar metallicity stars indicate that half of themare on a roughly circular orbit (e &lt; 0.15), so under the assumption that themetallicity of the interstellar medium at a given radius never decreases withtime, they must have increased their angular momenta by scattering atcorotation resonances of spiral arms from regions far inside the solar annulus.the likelihood that a star will migrate radially does not seem to decreasesignificantly with increasing amplitude of vertical oscillations within rangeof oscillation amplitudes encountered in the disc.

1501.02806	the progenitors of the milky way stellar halo: big bricks favoured over  little bricks	we present a census of blue horizontal branch (bhb) and blue straggler (bs)stars belonging to dwarf galaxies and globular clusters, and compare thesecounts to that of the milky way stellar halo. we find, in agreement withearlier studies, that the ratio of bs-to-bhb stars in these satellitepopulations is dependent on stellar mass. dwarf galaxies show an increasingbs-to-bhb ratio with luminosity. in contrast, globular clusters display thereverse trend, with n_bs/n_bhb (&lt; 1) decreasing with luminosity. the faintest(l &lt; 10^5 l_sun) dwarfs have similar numbers of bs and bhb stars (n_bs/n_bhb ~1), whereas more massive dwarfs tend to be dominated by bs stars (n_bs/n_bhb ~2-40). we find that the bs-to-bhb ratio in the stellar halo is relatively high(n_bs/n_bhb ~ 5-6), and thus inconsistent with the low ratios found in bothultra-faint dwarfs and globular clusters. our results favour more massivedwarfs as the dominant "building blocks" of the stellar halo, in good agreementwith current predictions from lambdacdm models.

1502.00484	dipping our toes in the water: first models of gd-1 as a stream	we present a model for producing tidal streams from disrupting progenitors inarbitrary potentials, utilizing the idea that the majority of stars escape fromthe progenitor's two lagrange points. the method involves releasing testparticles at the lagrange points as the satellite orbits the host anddynamically evolving them in the potential of both host and progenitor. themethod is sufficiently fast to allow large-dimensional parameter explorationusing monte carlo methods. we provide the first direct modelling of 6-d streamobservations -- assuming a stream rather than an orbit -- by applying ourmethods to gd-1. this is a kinematically cold stream spanning $60^{\circ}$ ofthe sky and residing in the outer galaxy $\approx 15$ kpc distant from thecentre. we assume the stream moves in a flattened logarithmic potentialcharacterised by an asymptotic circular velocity $v_0$ and a flattening $q$. werecover values of normalisation $v_0$ = $227.2^{+15.6}_{-18.2}$ kms$^{-1}$ andflattening $q$ = $0.91^{+0.04}_{-0.1}$, if the stream is assumed to leading,and $v_0$ = $226.5^{+17.9}_{-17.0}$ kms$^{-1}$, $q$ = $0.90^{+0.05}_{-0.09}$,if it is assumed to be trailing. this can be compared to the values $v_0 = 224\pm 13$ kms$^{-1}$ and $q= 0.87^{+0.07}_{-0.04}$ obtained by koposov et al(2010) using the simpler technique of orbit fitting. although there aredifferences between stream and orbit fitting, we conclude that orbit fittingcan provide accurate results given the current quality of the data, at leastfor this kinematically cold stream in this logarithmic model of the galaxy.

0804.4002	models of the cosmic horseshoe gravitational lens	we model the extremely massive and luminous lens galaxy in the cosmichorseshoe einstein ring system, recently discovered in the sloan digital skysurvey. we use the semi-linear method of warren &amp; dye (2003), which pixelisesthe source surface brightness distribution, to invert the einstein ring forsets of parameterised lens models. here, the method is refined by exploitingbayesian inference to optimise adaptive pixelisation of the source plane and tochoose between three differently parameterised models: a singular isothermalellipsoid, a power law model and a nfw profile. the most probable lens model isthe power law with a volume mass density that scales as r^(-1.96+/-0.02) and anaxis ratio of ~0.8. the mass within the einstein ring (i.e., within a cylinderwith projected distance of ~30 kpc from the centre of the lens galaxy) is(5.02+/-0.09)*10^12 m_solar, and the mass-to-light ratio is ~30. even thoughthe lens lies in a group of galaxies, the preferred value of the external shearis almost zero. this makes the cosmic horseshoe unique amongst large separationlenses, as almost all the deflection comes from a single, very massive galaxywith little boost from the environment.

1505.00787	the star formation history of the sagittarius stream	we present the first detailed quantitative study of the stellar populationsof the sagittarius (sgr) streams within the stripe 82 region, using photometricand spectroscopic observations from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). thestar formation history (sfh) is determined separately for the bright and faintsgr streams, to establish whether both components consist of a similar stellarpopulation mix or have a distinct origin.  best fit sfh solutions are characterised by a well-defined, tight sequence inage-metallicity space, indicating that star formation occurred within awell-mixed, homogeneously enriched medium. star formation rates dropped sharplyat an age of ~5-7 gyr, possibly related to the accretion of sgr by the mw.finally, the sgr sequence displays a change of slope in age-metallicity spaceat an age between 11-13 gyr consistent with the sgr alpha-element knee,indicating that supernovae type ia started contributing to the abundancepattern ~1-3 gyr after the start of star formation.  results for both streams are consistent with being drawn from the parent sgrpopulation mix, but at different epochs. the sfh of the bright stream startsfrom old, metal-poor populations and extends to a metallicity of [fe/h]~-0.7,with peaks at ~7 and 11 gyr. the faint sfh samples the older, more metal-poorpart of the sgr sequence, with a peak at ancient ages and stars mostly with[fe/h]&lt;-1.3 and age&gt;9 gyr. therefore, we argue in favour of a scenario wherethe faint stream consists of material stripped i) earlier, and ii) from theoutskirts of the sgr dwarf.

astro-ph;0504236	automated detection of classical novae with neural networks	the point-agape collaboration surveyed m31 with the primary goal of opticaldetection of microlensing events, yet its data catalogue is also a prime sourceof lightcurves of variable and transient objects, including classical novae(cne). a reliable means of identification, combined with a thorough survey ofthe variable objects in m31, provides an excellent opportunity to locate andstudy an entire galactic population of cne. this paper presents a set of 440neural networks, working in 44 committees, designed specifically to identifyfast cne. the networks are developed using training sets consisting ofsimulated novae and point-agape lightcurves, in a novel variation on k-foldcross-validation. they use the binned, normalised power spectra of thelightcurves as input units. the networks successfully identify 9 of the 13previously identified m31 cne within their optimal working range (and 11 out of13 if the network error bars are taken into account). they provide a catalogueof 19 new candidate fast cne, of which 4 are strongly favoured.

astro-ph;0504536	the nature of parallax microlensing events towards the galactic bulge	perhaps as many as 30 parallax microlensing events are known, thanks to theefforts of the macho, ogle, eros and moa experiments monitoring the bulge.using galactic models, we construct mock catalogues of microlensing lightcurves towards the bulge, allowing for the uneven sampling and observationalerror bars of the ogle-ii experiment. the fraction of parallax events withdelta chi^2 &gt; 50 in the ogle-ii database is around ~1%, though higher fractionsare reported by some other surveys. this is in accord with expectations fromstandard galactic models. the fraction of parallax events depends strongly onthe einstein crossing time (t_e), being less than 5% at t_e = 50 days butrising to 50% at t_e &gt; 1 yr. we find that the existence of parallax signaturesis essentially controlled by the acceleration of the observer normalised to theprojected einstein radius on the observer plane divided by t_e^2. theproperties of the parallax events - time-scales, projected velocities, sourceand lens locations - in our mock catalogues are analysed. typically, ~38% ofparallax events are caused by a disk star microlensing a bulge source, while\~33% are caused by a disk star microlensing a disk source (of these disksources, one sixth are at a distance of 5 kpc or less). there is a significantshift in mean time-scale from 32 d for all events to ~130d for our parallaxevents. there are corresponding shifts for other parameters, such as thelens-source velocity projected onto the observer plane (~1110 km/s for allevents versus ~80 km/s for parallax events) and the lens distance (6.7 kpcversus 3.7 kpc). we also assess the performance of parallax mass estimators andinvestigate whether our mock catalogue can reproduce events with featuressimilar to a number of conjectured `black hole' lens candidates.

astro-ph;0505167	is there a microlensing puzzle?	using neural networks, belokurov, evans &amp; le du (2003, 2004) showed that 7out of the 29 microlensing candidates towards the large magellanic cloud (lmc)of the macho collaboration are consistent with blended microlensing and addedgaussian noise. they then estimated the microlensing optical depth to the lmcto be between 0.3 x 10^{-7} and 0.5 x 10^{-7}, lower by about a factor of twothan that found by the macho collaboration. there has been a recent independentclaim of a low optical depth to the lmc by the eros collaboration, who find0.15 x 10^{-7} from 3 candidates (tisserand et al 2006). griest &amp; thomas (2005)have contested our calculations. unfortunately, their paper contains a numberof scientific misrepresentations of our work. we stand by our application ofneural networks to microlensing searches and believe it to be a technique ofgreat promise. rather, the main cause of the disparity between griest &amp; thomasand belokurov et al. lies in the very different datasets through which theseinvestigators look for microlensing events. we don't exclude the possibilitythat some of our non-microlensing designations may change with access to cleandata. whilst not everything is understood about the microlensing datasetstowards the lmc, the latest downward revisions of the optical depth means thatgriest &amp; thomas' microlensing puzzle is a roughly 1 sigma effect. efficiencycalculations can correct for the effects of false negatives, but they cannotcorrect for the effects of false positives (variable stars that are mistakenfor microlensing). therefore, the best strategy in a microlensing experiment isto eschew a decision boundary altogether. rather, each lightcurve should beassigned a probability and the microlensing rate calculated by summing over theprobabilities of all such lightcurves.

0809.0700	a spectroscopic confirmation of the bootes ii dwarf spheroidal	we present a new suite of photometric and spectroscopic data for the faintbootes ii dwarf spheroidal galaxy candidate. our deep photometry, obtained withthe int/wfc, suggests a distance of 46 kpc and a small half-light radius of 4.0arcmin (56 pc), consistent with previous estimates. follow-up spectroscopyobtained with the gemini/gmos instrument yielded radial velocities andmetallicities. while the majority of our targets covers a broad range invelocities and metallicities, we find five stars which share very similarvelocities and metallicities and which are all compatible with the colors andmagnitudes of the galaxy's likely red giant branch. we interpret these as aspectroscopic detection of the bootes ii system. these stars have a meanvelocity of -117 km/s, a velocity dispersion of (10.5+-7.4) km/s and a mean[fe/h] of -1.79 dex, with a dispersion of 0.14 dex. at this metallicity, boo iiis not consistent with the stellar-mass-metallicity relation for the moreluminous dwarf galaxies. coupled with our distance estimate, its high negativesystemic velocity rules out any physical connection with its projectedneighbor, the bootes i dwarf spheroidal, which has a velocity of ~+100 km/s.the velocity and distance of bootes ii coincide with those of the leading armof sagittarius, which passes through this region of the sky, so that it ispossible that bootes ii may be a stellar system associated with the sagittariusstream. finally, we note that the properties of bootes ii are consistent withbeing the surviving remnant of a previously larger and more luminous dsphgalaxy.

astro-ph;0509493	classical novae from the point-agape microlensing survey of m31 -- ii.  rate and statistical characteristics of the nova population	we report the results of our statistical study of the point-agape cnecatalogue. the first sloan $r'$ and $i'$ analysis of the mmrd relationship inm31 is performed using the resulting point-agape cn catalogue. good fits areproduced to the mmrd in the two filters. however, we are unable to verify the$t_{15}$ relationship for either sloan filter. the subsequent analysis of ourautomated cn detection pipeline has provided us with the most thoroughknowledge of the completeness of a cn survey to-date. in addition, the largefield of view of the survey has permitted us to probe the outburst rate wellinto the galactic disk, unlike previous ccd imaging surveys. using thisanalysis we are able to probe the cn distribution of m31 and evaluate theglobal nova rate. using models of the galactic surface brightness of m31, weshow that the observed cn distribution consists of a separate bulge and diskpopulation. we also show that the m31 bulge cn eruption rate per unit $r'$ fluxis more than five times greater than that of the disk. we deduce a global m31cn rate of $65^{+16}_{-15}$ year$^{-1}$, a value much higher than found byprevious surveys. using the global rate, we derive a m31 bulge rate of$38^{+15}_{-12}$ year$^{-1}$ and a disk rate of $27^{+19}_{-15}$ year$^{-1}$.given our understanding of the completeness and an analysis of other sources oferror, we conclude that the true global nova rate of m31 is at least 50% higherthan was previously thought and this has consequent implications for thepresumed cn rate in the milky way. we deduce a galactic bulge rate of$14^{+6}_{-5}$ year$^{-1}$, a disk rate of $20^{+14}_{-11}$ year$^{-1}$ and aglobal galactic rate of $34^{+15}_{-12}$ year$^{-1}$.

astro-ph;0605705	an orphan in the "field of streams"	we use sloan digital sky survey data release 5 photometry and spectroscopy tostudy a tidal stream that extends over 50 degrees in the north galactic cap.  from the analysis of the path of the stream and the colors and magnitudes ofits stars, the stream is about 20 kpc away at its nearest detection (thecelestial equator). we detect a distance gradient -- the stream is farther awayfrom us at higher declination. the contents of the stream are made up from apredominantly old and metal-poor population that is similar to the globularclusters m13 and m92. the integrated absolute magnitude of the stream stars isestimated to be m_r = -7.5. there istentative evidence for a velocitysignature, with the stream moving at -40 km/s at low declinations and +100 km/sat high declinations. the stream lies on the same great circle as complex a, aroughly linear association of hi high velocity clouds stretching over 30degrees on the sky, and as ursa major ii, a recently discovered dwarfspheroidal galaxy. lying close to the same great circle are a number ofanomalous, young and metal-poor globular clusters, including palomar 1 andruprecht 106.

astro-ph;0608448	cats and dogs, hair and a hero: a quintet of new milky way companions	we present five new satellites of the milky way discovered in sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) imaging data, four of which were followed-up with either thesubaru or the isaac newton telescopes. they include four probable new dwarfgalaxies -- one each in the constellations of coma berenices, canes venatici,leo and hercules -- together with one unusually extended globular cluster,segue 1. we provide distances, absolute magnitudes, half-light radii andcolor-magnitude diagrams for all five satellites. the morphological features ofthe color-magnitude diagrams are generally well described by the ridge line ofthe old, metal-poor globular cluster m92. in the last two years, a total of tennew milky way satellites with effective surface brightness mu_v &gt;~ 28 mag/sq.arcsec have been discovered in sdss data. they are less luminous, moreirregular and appear to be more metal-poor than the previously-known nine milkyway dwarf spheroidals. the relationship between these objects and otherpopulations is discussed. we note that there is a paucity of objects withhalf-light radii between ~40 pc and ~ 100 pc. we conjecture that this mayrepresent the division between star clusters and dwarf galaxies.

astro-ph;0611157	is ursa major ii the progenitor of the orphan stream?	prominent in the `field of streams' -- the sloan digital sky survey map ofsubstructure in the galactic halo -- is an `orphan stream' without obviousprogenitor. in this numerical study, we show a possible connection between thenewly found dwarf satellite ursa major ii (uma ii) and the orphan stream. weprovide numerical simulations of the disruption of uma ii that match theobservational data on the position, distance and morphology of the orphanstream. we predict the radial velocity of uma ii as -100 km/s as well as theexistence of strong velocity gradients along the orphan stream. the velocitydispersion of uma ii is expected to be high, though this can be caused both bya high dark matter content or by the presence of unbound stars in a disruptedremnant. however, the existence of a gradient in the mean radial velocityacross uma ii provides a clear-cut distinction between these possibilities. thesimulations support the idea that some of the anomalous, young halo globularclusters like palomar 1 or arp 2 or ruprecht 106 may be physically associatedwith the orphan stream.

astro-ph;0701154	discovery of an unusual dwarf galaxy in the outskirts of the milky way	in this letter, we announce the discovery of a new dwarf galaxy, leo t, inthe local group. it was found as a stellar overdensity in the sloan digital skysurvey data release 5 (sdss dr5). the color-magnitude diagram of leo t showstwo well-defined features, which we interpret as a red giant branch and asequence of young, massive stars. as judged from fits to the color-magnitudediagram, it lies at a distance of about 420 kpc and has an intermediate-agestellar population with a metallicity of [fe/h]= -1.6, together with a youngpopulation of blue stars of age of 200 myr. there is a compact cloud of neutralhydrogen with mass roughly 10^5 solar masses and radial velocity 35 km/scoincident with the object visible in the hipass channel maps. leo t is thesmallest, lowest luminosity galaxy found to date with recent star-formation. itappears to be a transition object similar to, but much lower luminosity than,the phoenix dwarf.

0810.0710	the highly unusual chemical composition of the hercules dwarf spheroidal  galaxy	we report on the abundance analysis of two red giants in the faint herculesdwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxy. these stars show a remarkable deficiency in theneutron-capture elements, while the hydrostatic alpha-elements (o, mg) arestrongly enhanced. our data indicate [ba/fe] and [mg/fe] abundance ratios of&lt;-2 dex and ~+0.8 dex, respectively, with essentially no detection of othern-capture elements. in contrast to the only other dsph star with similarabundance patterns, dra 119, which has a very low metallicity at [fe/h]=-2.95dex, our objects, at [fe/h]~-2.0 dex, are only moderately metal poor. themeasured ratio of hydrostatic/explosive alpha-elements indicates that high-mass(~35 m_sun) type ii supernovae progenitors are the main, if not only,contributors to the enrichment of this galaxy. this suggests that starformation and chemical enrichment in the ultrafaint dsphs proceedsstochastically and inhomogeneously on small scales, or that the imf wasstrongly skewed to high mass stars. the neutron capture deficiencies and the[co/fe] and [cr/fe] abundance ratios in our stars are similar to those in theextremely low metallicity galactic halo. this suggests that either our starsare composed mainly of the ejecta from the first, massive, population iii stars(but at moderately high [fe/h]), or that sn ejecta in the hercules galaxy werediluted with ~30 times less hydrogen than typical for extreme metal-poor stars.

0706.0019	the discovery of two extremely low luminosity milky way globular  clusters	we report the discovery of two extremely low luminosity globular clusters inthe milky way halo. these objects were detected in the sloan digital sky surveydata release 5 and confirmed with deeper imaging at the calar alto observatory.the clusters, koposov 1 and koposov 2, are located at $\sim 40-50$ kpc andappear to have old stellar populations and luminosities of only $m_v \sim -1$mag. their observed sizes of $\sim 3$ pc are well within the expected tidallimit of $\sim$10 pc at that distance. together with palomar 1, am 4 andwhiting 1, these new clusters are the lowest luminosity globulars orbiting themilky way, with koposov 2 the most extreme. koposov 1 appears to lie close todistant branch of the sagittarius stream. the half-mass relaxation times ofkoposov 1 and 2 are only $\sim 70$ and $\sim 55$ myr respectively (2 orders ofmagnitude shorter than the age of the stellar populations), so it would seemthat they have undergone drastic mass segregation. since they do not appear tobe very concentrated, their evaporation timescales may be as low as $\sim 0.1t_{\rm hubble}$. these discoveries show that the structural parameter space ofglobular clusters in the milky way halo is not yet fully explored. they alsoadd, through their short remaining survival times, significant direct evidencefor a once much larger population of globular clusters.
