0904.3170	radio properties of the low surface brightness snr g65.2+5.7	many physical properties of this snr such as spectrum and polarization canonly be investigated by radio observations. the $\lambda$11 cm and $\lambda$6\cm continuum and polarization observations of snr g65.2+5.7 were made with theeffelsberg 100-m and the urumqi 25-m telescopes, respectively, to investigatethe integrated spectrum, the spectral index distribution, and the magneticfield properties. $\lambda$21 cm archival data from the effelsberg 100-mtelescope have been also used. the integrated flux densities of g65.2+5.7 at$\lambda 11$ cm and $\lambda 6$ cm are $21.9\pm3.1$ jy and 16.8$\pm$1.8 jy,respectively. the power-law spectrum ($s\sim\nu^{\alpha}$) is well fitted by$\alpha = -0.58\pm0.07$ from 83 mhz to 4.8 ghz. spatial spectral variations aresmall. along the northern shell strong depolarizion is observed at bothwavelengths. the southern filamentary shell of snr g65.2+5.7 is polarized up to54% at $\lambda 6$ cm. there is significant depolarization at $\lambda 11$ cmand confusion with diffuse polarized galactic emission. using equipartitionprinciple, we estimated the magnetic field strength for the southernfilamentary shell about 20 $\mu$g (filling factor 1) to 50 $\mu$g (fillingfactor 0.1). a faint hi shell may be associated with the snr. despite itsunusual strong x-ray and optical emission and its very low surface brightness,the radio properties of snr g65.2+5.7 are found to be typical for evolved shelltype snrs. snr g65.2+5.7 may be expanding in a preblown cavity as indicated bya deficit of hi gas and a possible hi-shell.

0908.3378	simulated ska maps from galactic 3d-emission models	(abridged) we present maps for various galactic longitudes and latitudes at1.4 ghz, which is the frequency where deep ska surveys are proposed. the mapsare about 1.5 deg in size and have an angular resolution of about 1.6 arcsec.we analyse the maps in terms of their probability density functions (pdfs) andstructure functions. total intensity emission is more smooth in the plane thanat high latitudes due to the different contributions from the regular andrandom magnetic field. the high latitude fields show more extended polarizedemission and rm structures than those in the plane, where patchy emissionstructures on very small scales dominate. the rm pdfs in the plane are close togaussians, but clearly deviate from that at high latitudes. the rm structurefunctions show smaller amplitudes and steeper slopes towards high latitudes.these results emerge from the fact that much more turbulent cells are passedthrough by the line-of-sights in the plane. although the simulated randommagnetic field components distribute in 3d, the magnetic field spectrumextracted from the structure functions of rms conforms to 2d in the plane andapproaches 3d at high latitudes. this is partly related to the outer scale ofthe turbulent magnetic field, but mainly to the different lengths of theline-of-sights.

1004.2536	a survey of the polarized emission from the galactic plane at 1420 mhz  with arcminute angular resolution	context: observations of polarized emission are a significant source ofinformation on the magnetic field that pervades the interstellar medium of thegalaxy. despite the acknowledged importance of the magnetic field ininterstellar processes, our knowledge of field configurations on all scales isseriously limited. aims: this paper describes an extensive survey of polarizedgalactic emission at 1.4 ghz that provides data with arcminute resolution andcomplete coverage of all structures from the broadest angular scales to theresolution limit, giving information on the magneto-ionic medium over a widerange of interstellar environments. methods: data from the drao synthesistelescope, the effelsberg 100-m telescope, and the drao 26-m telescope havebeen combined. angular resolution is ~1' and the survey extends from l = 66 degto l = 175 deg over a range -3 deg &lt; b &lt; 5 deg along the northern galacticplane, with a high-latitude extension from l = 101 deg to l = 116 deg up to b =17.5 deg. this is the first extensive polarization survey to presentaperture-synthesis data combined with data from single antennas, and thetechniques developed to achieve this combination are described. results: theappearance of the extended polarized emission at 1.4 ghz is dominated byfaraday rotation along the propagation path, and the diffuse polarized skybears little resemblance to the total-intensity sky. there is extensivedepolarization, arising from vector averaging on long lines of sight, from hiiregions, and from diffuse ionized gas seen in h-alpha images. preliminaryinterpretation is presented of selected polarization features on scales fromparsecs (the planetary nebula sh 2-216) to hundreds of parsecs (a supperbubblegsh 166-01-17) to kiloparsecs (polarized emission in the direction of cygnusx).

1011.0341	antisymmetry in the faraday rotation sky caused by a nearby magnetized  bubble	rotation measures of pulsars and extragalactic point sources have been knownto reveal large-scale antisymmetries in the faraday rotation sky with respectto the galactic plane and halo that have been interpreted as signatures of themean magnetic field in the galactic halo. we describe faraday rotationmeasurements of the diffuse galactic polarized radio emission over a largeregion in the northern galactic hemisphere. through application of rotationmeasure synthesis we achieve sensitive faraday rotation maps with high angularresolution, capable of revealing fine-scale structures of about 1 deg in thefaraday rotation sky. our analysis suggests that the observed antisymmetry inthe faraday rotation sky at b &gt; 0 deg is dominated by the magnetic field arounda local hi bubble at a distance of approx. 100 pc, and not by the magneticfield of the galactic halo. we derive physical properties of the magnetic fieldof this shell, which we find to be 20 - 34 ug strong. it is clear that thediffuse polarized radio emission contains important information about the localmagneto-ionic medium, which cannot yet be derived from faraday rotationmeasures of extragalactic sources or pulsars alone.

1011.6425	a sino-german 6 cm polarization survey of the galactic plane iii. the  region from 10 degree to 60 degree longitude	(abridged) we have conducted a total intensity and polarization survey of thegalactic plane at 6 cm using the urumqi 25 m telescope for the galacticlongitude range of 10 deg&lt;l&lt;60 deg and the galactic latitude range of |b|&lt;5deg. missing absolute zero levels of stokes u and q maps were restored byextrapolating the wmap five-year k-band polarization data. for totalintensities we recovered missing large-scale components by referring to theeffelsberg 11 cm survey. total intensity and polarization maps are presentedwith an angular resolution of 9.5 arcmin and a sensitivity of 1 mk and 0.5 mkin total and polarized intensity, respectively. the 6 cm polarized emission inthe galactic plane originates within about 4 kpc distance, which increases forpolarized emission out of the plane. the polarization map shows "patches","canals" and "voids" with no correspondence in total intensity. we attributethe patches to turbulent magnetic field cells. canals are caused by abruptvariation of polarization angles at the boundaries of patches rather than byforeground faraday screens. the superposition of foreground and faraday screenrotated background emission almost cancels polarized emission locally, so thatpolarization voids appear. by modelling the voids, we estimate the faradayscreen's regular magnetic field along the line-of-sight to be larger than about8 microg. we separated thermal (free-free) and non-thermal (synchrotron)emission according to their different spectral indices. the spectral index forthe synchrotron emission was based on wmap polarization data. the fraction ofthermal emission at 6 cm is about 60% in the plane.

1101.2031	planck early results. xx. new light on anomalous microwave emission from  spinning dust grains	anomalous microwave emission (ame) has been observed by numerous experimentsin the frequency range ~10-60 ghz. using planck maps and multi-frequencyancillary data, we have constructed spectra for two known ame regions: theperseus and rho ophiuchi molecular clouds. the spectra are well fitted by acombination of free-free radiation, cosmic microwave background, thermal dust,and electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. the spinningdust spectra are the most precisely measured to date, and show the highfrequency side clearly for the first time. the spectra have a peak in the range20-40 ghz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for perseus and8.4 sigma for rho ophiuchi. in perseus, spinning dust in the dense moleculargas can account for most of the ame; the low density atomic gas appears to playa minor role. in rho ophiuchi, the ~30 ghz peak is dominated by dense moleculargas, but there is an indication of an extended tail at frequencies 50-100 ghz,which can be accounted for by irradiated low density atomic gas. the dustparameters are consistent with those derived from other measurements. we havealso searched the planck map at 28.5 ghz for candidate ame regions, bysubtracting a simple model of the synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust. wepresent spectra for two of the candidates; s140 and s235 are bright hii regionsthat show evidence for ame, and are well fitted by spinning dust models.

1101.2032	planck early results. xxi. properties of the interstellar medium in the  galactic plane	(abridged) planck has observed the entire sky from 30 ghz to 857ghz. theobserved foreground emission contains contributions from different phases ofthe interstellar medium (ism). we have separated the observed galactic emissioninto the different gaseous components (atomic, molecular and ionised) in eachof a number of galactocentric rings. templates are created for variousgalactocentric radii using velocity information from atomic (neutral hydrogen)and molecular (12co) observations. the ionised template is assumed to be tracedby free-free emission as observed by wmap, while 408 mhz emission is used totrace the synchrotron component. gas emission not traced by the abovetemplates, namely "ark gas", as evidenced using planck data, is included as anadditional template, the first time such a component has been used in this way.these templates are then correlated with each of the planck frequency bands, aswell as other ancillary data. the emission per column density of the gastemplates allows us to create distinct spectral energy distributions (seds) pergalactocentric ring and in each of the gaseous tracers from 1.4 ghz to 25 thz(12\mu m). apart from the thermal dust and free-free emission, we have probedthe galaxy for anomalous (e.g., spinning) dust as well as synchrotron emission.we show that anomalous dust emission is present in the atomic, molecular anddark gas phases throughout the galactic disk. the derived dust propetiesassociated with the dark gas phase are derived but do not allow us to revealthe nature of this phase. for all environments, the anomalous emission isconsistent with rotation from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and,according to our simple model, accounts for $(25\pm5)%$ (statistical) of thetotal emission at 30 ghz.

0711.1572	radio observational constraints on galactic 3d-emission models	(abridged) we constrain simulated all-sky maps in total intensity, linearpolarization, and rotation measure (rm) by observations. we test a number oflarge-scale magnetic field configurations and take the properties of the warminterstellar medium into account. from a comparison of simulated and observedmaps we are able to constrain the regular large-scale galactic magnetic fieldin the disk and the halo of the galaxy. the local regular field is 2 microg andthe average random field is about 3 microg. the known local excess ofsynchrotron emission originating either from enhanced cr electrons or randommagnetic fields is able to explain the observed high-latitude synchrotronemission. the thermal electron model (ne2001) in conjunction with a properfilling factor accounts for the observed optically thin thermal emission andlow frequency absorption by optically thick emission. a coupling factor betweenthermal electrons and the random magnetic field component is proposed, which inaddition to the small filling factor of thermal electrons increases small-scalerm fluctuations and thus accounts for the observed depolarization at 1.4 ghz.we conclude that an axisymmetric magnetic disk field configuration withreversals inside the solar circle fits available observations best. out of theplane a strong toroidal magnetic field with different signs above and below theplane is needed to account for the observed high-latitude rms. our preferred3d-model fits the observations better than other models over a wide frequencyrange.

1210.0393	the lofar radio environment	aims: this paper discusses the spectral occupancy for performing radioastronomy with the low-frequency array (lofar), with a focus on imagingobservations. methods: we have analysed the radio-frequency interference (rfi)situation in two 24-h surveys with dutch lofar stations, covering 30-78 mhzwith low-band antennas and 115-163 mhz with high-band antennas. this is asubset of the full frequency range of lofar. the surveys have been observedwith a 0.76 khz / 1 s resolution. results: we measured the rfi occupancy in thelow and high frequency sets to be 1.8% and 3.2% respectively. these values arefound to be representative values for the lofar radio environment. between dayand night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. we findthat lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of lofarresults in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. at lofar's nominal resolution of0.76 khz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5%. this rate increasesapproximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution.conclusions: currently, by using an automated rfi detection strategy, the lofarradio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. itremains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations thatintegrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. reasons forthe low impact of rfi are the high spectral and time resolution of lofar;accurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and theproximity of the antennas to the ground. we discuss some strategies that can beused once low-level rfi starts to become apparent. it is important that thefrequency range of lofar remains free of broadband interference, such as dabstations and windmills.

1210.1346	m87 at metre wavelengths: the lofar picture	m87 is a giant elliptical galaxy located in the centre of the virgo cluster,which harbours a supermassive black hole of mass 6.4x10^9 m_sun, whose activityis responsible for the extended (80 kpc) radio lobes that surround the galaxy.the energy generated by matter falling onto the central black hole is ejectedand transferred to the intra-cluster medium via a relativistic jet andmorphologically complex systems of buoyant bubbles, which rise towards theedges of the extended halo. here we present the first observations made withthe new low-frequency array (lofar) of m87 at frequencies down to 20 mhz.images of m87 were produced at low radio frequencies never explored before atthese high spatial resolution and dynamic range. to disentangle differentsynchrotron models and place constraints on source magnetic field, age andenergetics, we also performed a detailed spectral analysis of m87 extendedradio-halo using these observations together with archival data. we do not findany sign of new extended emissions; on the contrary the source appears wellconfined by the high pressure of the intra-cluster medium. a continuousinjection of relativistic electrons is the model that best fits our data, andprovides a scenario in which the lobes are still supplied by fresh relativisticparticles from the active galactic nuclei. we suggest that the discrepancybetween the low-frequency radio-spectral slope in the core and in the haloimplies a strong adiabatic expansion of the plasma as soon as it leaves thecore area. the extended halo has an equipartition magnetic field strength of~10 ug, which increases to ~13 ug in the zones where the particle flows aremore active. the continuous injection model for synchrotron ageing provides anage for the halo of ~40 myr, which in turn provides a jet kinetic power of6-10x10^44 erg/s.

1301.1630	initial deep lofar observations of epoch of reionization windows: i. the  north celestial pole	the aim of the lofar epoch of reionization (eor) project is to detect thespectral fluctuations of the redshifted hi 21cm signal. this signal is weakerby several orders of magnitude than the astrophysical foreground signals andhence, in order to achieve this, very long integrations, accurate calibrationfor stations and ionosphere and reliable foreground removal are essential. oneof the prospective observing windows for the lofar eor project will be centeredat the north celestial pole (ncp). we present results from observations of thencp window using the lofar highband antenna (hba) array in the frequency range115 mhz to 163 mhz. the data were obtained in april 2011 during thecommissioning phase of lofar. we used baselines up to about 30 km. with about 3nights, of 6 hours each, effective integration we have achieved a noise levelof about 100 microjy/psf in the ncp window. close to the ncp, the noise levelincreases to about 180 microjy/psf, mainly due to additional contamination fromunsubtracted nearby sources. we estimate that in our best night, we havereached a noise level only a factor of 1.4 above the thermal limit set by thenoise from our galaxy and the receivers. our continuum images are several timesdeeper than have been achieved previously using the wsrt and gmrt arrays. wederive an analytical explanation for the excess noise that we believe to bemainly due to sources at large angular separation from the ncp.

1302.2321	differential frequency-dependent delay from the pulsar magnetosphere	some radio pulsars show clear drifting subpulses, in which subpulses are seento drift in pulse longitude in a systematic pattern. here we examine how thedrifting subpulses of psr b0809+74 evolve with time and observing frequency. weshow that the subpulse period (p3) is constant on timescales of days, monthsand years, and between 14-5100 mhz. despite this, the shapes of the driftbandschange radically with frequency. previous studies have concluded that, whilethe subpulses appear to move through the pulse window approximately linearly atlow frequencies (&lt; 500 mhz), a discrete step of 180 degrees in subpulse phaseis observed at higher frequencies (&gt; 820 mhz) near to the peak of the averagepulse profile. we use lofar, gmrt, gbt, wsrt and effelsberg 100-m data toexplore the frequency-dependence of this phase step. we show that the size ofthe subpulse phase step increases gradually, and is observable even at lowfrequencies. we attribute the subpulse phase step to the presence of twoseparate driftbands, whose relative arrival times vary with frequency - onedriftband arriving 30 pulses earlier at 20 mhz than it does at 1380 mhz, whilstthe other arrives simultaneously at all frequencies. the drifting pattern whichis observed here cannot be explained by either the rotating carousel model orthe surface oscillation model, and could provide new insight into the physicalprocesses happening within the pulsar magnetosphere.

1302.3128	lofar detections of low-frequency radio recombination lines towards  cassiopeia a	cassiopeia a was observed using the low-band antennas of the low frequencyarray (lofar) with high spectral resolution. this allowed a search for radiorecombination lines (rrls) along the line-of-sight to this source. fivecarbon-alpha rrls were detected in absorption between 40 and 50 mhz with asignal-to-noise ratio of &gt; 5 from two independent lofar datasets. the derivedline velocities (v_lsr ~ -50 km/s) and integrated optical depths (~ 13 s^-1) ofthe rrls in our spectra, extracted over the whole supernova remnant, areconsistent within each lofar dataset and with those previously reported. forthe first time, we are able to extract spectra against the brightest hotspot ofthe remnant at frequencies below 330 mhz. these spectra show significantlyhigher (15-80 %) integrated optical depths, indicating that there issmall-scale angular structure on the order of ~1 pc in the absorbing gasdistribution over the face of the remnant. we also place an upper limit of 3 x10^-4 on the peak optical depths of hydrogen and helium rrls. these resultsdemonstrate that lofar has the desired spectral stability and sensitivity tostudy faint recombination lines in the decameter band.

1303.6230	calibrating high-precision faraday rotation measurements for lofar and  the next generation of low-frequency radio telescopes	faraday rotation measurements using the current and next generation oflow-frequency radio telescopes will provide a powerful probe of astronomicalmagnetic fields. however, achieving the full potential of these measurementsrequires accurate removal of the time-variable ionospheric faraday rotationcontribution. we present ionfr, a code that calculates the amount ofionospheric faraday rotation for a specific epoch, geographic location, andline-of-sight. ionfr uses a number of publicly available, gps-derived totalelectron content maps and the most recent release of the internationalgeomagnetic reference field. we describe applications of this code for thecalibration of radio polarimetric observations, and demonstrate the highaccuracy of its modeled ionospheric faraday rotations using lofar pulsarobservations. these show that we can accurately determine some of thehighest-precision pulsar rotation measures ever achieved. precision rotationmeasures can be used to monitor rotation measure variations - either intrinsicor due to the changing line-of-sight through the interstellar medium. thiscalibration is particularly important for nearby sources, where the ionospherecan contribute a significant fraction of the observed rotation measure. we alsodiscuss planned improvements to ionfr, as well as the importance of ionosphericfaraday rotation calibration for the emerging generation of low-frequency radiotelescopes, such as the ska and its pathfinders.

0801.0547	the impact of galactic synchrotron emission on cmb anisotropy  measurements. i. angular power spectrum analysis of total intensity all-sky  surveys	galactic foreground emission is a limiting factor for precise cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) anisotropy measurements. we perform an angular powerspectrum analysis (aps) of all-sky total intensity maps at 408 mhz and 1420mhz, which are dominated by synchrotron emission out of the galactic plane. wesubtract the brighter sources from the maps. we study the aps as a function ofgalactic latitude by considering various cuts and as a function of sky positionby dividing the sky into patches of about 15 deg x 15 deg in size. the aps ofthe galactic radio diffuse synchrotron emission is best fitted by a power law,$c_{\ell} \sim k \ell^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha \in [-3.0,-2.6]$, where the lowervalues of $\alpha$ typically correspond to the higher latitudes. nevertheless,the analysis of the patches reveals that strong local variations exist. themean aps for $\ell \in [20,40]$ is used to determine the mean spectral indexbetween 408 mhz and 1420 mhz, which is then adopted to extrapolate thesynchrotron aps results to the microwave range. a simple extrapolation to 23ghz of the synchrotron emission aps found at 408 and 1420 mhz does not explainall the power in the wmap synchrotron component even at middle/high galacticlatitudes. this suggests a significant microwave contribution (of about 50% ofthe signal) by other components such as free-free or spinning dust emission.the comparison between the extrapolated synchrotron aps and the cmb aps showsthat a mask excluding the regions with $|b_{gal}| \lesssim 5^{\circ}$ wouldreduce the foreground fluctuations to about half of the cosmological ones at 70ghz even at the lowest multipoles. we discuss the main implications of ouranalysis for the cosmological exploitation of microwave temperature anisotropymaps.

1307.5580	the brightness and spatial distributions of terrestrial radio sources	faint undetected sources of radio-frequency interference (rfi) might becomevisible in long radio observations when they are consistently present overtime. thereby, they might obstruct the detection of the weak astronomicalsignals of interest. this issue is especially important for epoch ofreionisation (eor) projects that try to detect the faint redshifted hi signalsfrom the time of the earliest structures in the universe. we explore the rfisituation at 30-163 mhz by studying brightness histograms of visibility dataobserved with lofar, similar to radio-source-count analyses that are used incosmology. an empirical rfi distribution model is derived that allows thesimulation of rfi in radio observations. the brightness histograms show an rfidistribution that follows a power-law distribution with an estimated exponentaround -1.5. with several assumptions, this can be explained with a uniformdistribution of terrestrial radio sources whose radiation follows existingpropagation models. extrapolation of the power law implies that the currentlofar eor observations should be severely rfi limited if the strength of rfisources remains strong after time integration. this is in contrast with actualobservations, which almost reach the thermal noise and are thought not to belimited by rfi. therefore, we conclude that it is unlikely that there areundetected rfi sources that will become visible in long observations.consequently, there is no indication that rfi will prevent an eor detectionwith lofar.

1308.2804	studying galactic interstellar turbulence through fluctuations in  synchrotron emission: first lofar galactic foreground detection	the characteristic outer scale of turbulence and the ratio of the random toordered components of the magnetic field are key parameters to characterisemagnetic turbulence in the interstellar gas, which affects the propagation ofcosmic rays within the galaxy. we provide new constraints to those twoparameters. we use the low frequency array (lofar) to image the diffusecontinuum emission in the fan region at (l,b) (137.0,+7.0) at 80"x70"resolution in the range [146,174] mhz. we detect multi-scale fluctuations inthe galactic synchrotron emission and compute their power spectrum. applyingtheoretical estimates and derivations from the literature for the first time,we derive the outer scale of turbulence and the ratio of random to orderedmagnetic field from the characteristics of these fluctuations . we obtain thedeepest image of the fan region to date and find diffuse continuum emissionwithin the primary beam. the power spectrum of the foreground synchrotronfluctuations displays a power law behaviour for scales between 100 and 8 arcminwith a slope of (-1.84+/-0.19). we find an upper limit of about 20 pc for theouter scale of the magnetic interstellar turbulence toward the fan region. wealso find a variation of the ratio of random to ordered field as a function ofgalactic coordinates, supporting different turbulent regimes. we use powerspectra fluctuations from lofar as well as earlier gmrt and wsrt observationsto constrain the outer scale of turbulence of the galactic synchrotronforeground, finding a range of plausible values of 10-20 pc. then, we use thisinformation to deduce lower limits of the ratio of ordered to random magneticfield strength. these are found to be 0.3, 0.3, and 0.5 for the lofar, wsrt andgmrt fields considered respectively. both these constraints are in agreementwith previous estimates.

1309.1357	planck intermediate results. xv. a study of anomalous microwave emission  in galactic clouds	anomalous microwave emission (ame) is believed to be due to electric dipoleradiation from small spinning dust grains. the aim of this paper is astatistical study of the basic properties of ame regions and the environment inwhich they emit. we used wmap and planck maps, combined with ancillary radioand ir data, to construct a sample of 98 candidate ame sources, assembling sedsfor each source using aperture photometry on 1deg-smoothed maps from 0.408 ghzup to 3000 ghz. each spectrum is fitted with a simple model of free-free,synchrotron (where necessary), cosmic microwave background (cmb), thermal dust,and spinning dust components. we find that 42 of the 98 sources havesignificant (&gt;5sigma) excess emission at frequencies between 20 and 60 ghz. ananalysis of the potential contribution of optically thick free-free emissionfrom ultra-compact hii regions, using ir colour criteria, reduces thesignificant ame sample to 27 regions. the spectrum of the ame is consistentwith model spectra of spinning dust. the ame regions tend to be more spatiallyextended than regions with little or no ame. the ame intensity is stronglycorrelated with the submillimetre/ir flux densities and comparable to previousame detections in the literature. ame emissivity, defined as the ratio of ameto dust optical depth, varies by an order of magnitude for the ame regions. theame regions tend to be associated with cooler dust in the range 14-20 k and anaverage emissivity index of +1.8, while the non-ame regions are typicallywarmer, at 20-27 k. in agreement with previous studies, the ame emissivityappears to decrease with increasing column density. the emerging picture isthat the bulk of the ame is coming from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonsand small dust grains from the colder neutral interstellar medium phase(abridged).

1407.1312	the nature of the low-frequency emission of m51: first observations of a  nearby galaxy with lofar	the grand-design spiral galaxy m51 was observed with the lofar high frequencyantennas (hba) and imaged in total intensity and polarisation. this observationcovered the frequencies between 115 mhz and 175 mhz. we produced an image oftotal emission of m51 at the mean frequency of 151 mhz with 20 arcsecresolution and 0.3 mjy rms noise, which is the most sensitive image of a galaxyat frequencies below 300 mhz so far. the integrated spectrum of total radioemission is described well by a power law, while flat spectral indices in thecentral region indicate thermal absorption. we observe that the disk extendsout to 16 kpc and see a break in the radial profile near the optical radius ofthe disk. our main results, the scale lengths of the inner and outer disks at151 mhz and 1.4 ghz, arm--interarm contrast, and the break scales of theradio--far-infrared correlations, can be explained consistently by crediffusion, leading to a longer propagation length of cre of lower energy. thedistribution of cre sources drops sharply at about 10 kpc radius, where thestar formation rate also decreases sharply. we find evidence that thermalabsorption is primarily caused by hii regions. the non-detection ofpolarisation from m51 at 151 mhz is consistent with the estimates of faradaydepolarisation. future searches for polarised emission in this frequency rangeshould concentrate on regions with low star formation rates.

1409.5437	lofar low-band antenna observations of the 3c295 and bootes fields:  source counts and ultra-steep spectrum sources	we present lofar low band observations of the bootes and 3c295 fields. ourimages made at 34, 46, and 62 mhz reach noise levels of 12, 8, and 5 mjybeam$^{-1}$, making them the deepest images ever obtained in this frequencyrange. in total, we detect between 300 and 400 sources in each of these images,covering an area of 17 to 52 deg$^{2}$. from the observations we deriveeuclidean-normalized differential source counts. the 62 mhz source counts agreewith previous gmrt 153 mhz and vla 74 mhz differential source counts, scalingwith a spectral index of $-0.7$. we find that a spectral index scaling of$-0.5$ is required to match up the lofar 34 mhz source counts. this result isalso in agreement with source counts from the 38 mhz 8c survey, indicating thatthe average spectral index of radio sources flattens towards lower frequencies.we also find evidence for spectral flattening using the individual fluxmeasurements of sources between 34 and 1400 mhz and by calculating the spectralindex averaged over the source population. to select ultra-steep spectrum($\alpha &lt; -1.1$) radio sources, that could be associated with massive highredshift radio galaxies, we compute spectral indices between 62 mhz, 153 mhzand 1.4 ghz for sources in the bo\"otes field. we cross-correlate these radiosources with optical and infrared catalogues and fit the spectral energydistribution to obtain photometric redshifts. we find that most of theseultra-steep spectrum sources are located in the $ 0.7 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.5$range.

1411.7616	monopole and dipole estimation for multi-frequency sky maps by linear  regression	we describe a simple but efficient method for deriving a consistent set ofmonopole and dipole corrections for multi-frequency sky map data sets, allowingrobust parametric component separation with the same data set. thecomputational core of this method is linear regression between pairs offrequency maps, often called "t-t plots". individual contributions frommonopole and dipole terms are determined by performing the regression locallyin patches on the sky, while the degeneracy between different frequencies islifted when ever the dominant foreground component exhibits a significantspatial spectral index variation. based on this method, we present twodifferent, but each internally consistent, sets of monopole and dipolecoefficients for the 9-year wmap, planck 2013, sfd 100 um, haslam 408 mhz andreich &amp; reich 1420 mhz maps. the two sets have been derived with differentanalysis assumptions and data selection, and provides an estimate of residualsystematic uncertainties. in general, our values are in good agreement withpreviously published results. among the most notable results are a relativedipole between the wmap and planck experiments of 10-15 uk (depending onfrequency), an estimate of the 408 mhz map monopole of 8.9 +- 1.3 k, and anon-zero dipole in the 1420 mhz map of $0.15 +- 0.03 k pointing towardsgalactic coordinates (l,b) = (308,-36) +- 14 degrees. these values representthe sum of any instrumental and data processing offsets, as well as anygalactic or extra-galactic component that is spectrally uniform over the fullsky.

1504.06642	the peculiar radio galaxy 4c 35.06: a case for recurrent agn activity?	using observations obtained with the low fequency array (lofar), thewesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) and archival very large array (vla)data, we have traced the radio emission to large scales in the complex source4c 35.06 located in the core of the galaxy cluster abell 407. at higher spatialresolution (~4"), the source was known to have two inner radio lobes spanning31 kpc and a diffuse, low-brightness extension running parallel to them, offsetby about 11 kpc (in projection).  at 62 mhz, we detect the radio emission of this structure extending out to210 kpc. at 1.4 ghz and intermediate spatial resolution (~30"), the structureappears to have a helical morphology.  we have derived the characteristics of the radio spectral index across thesource. we show that the source morphology is most likely the result of atleast two episodes of agn activity separated by a dormant period of around 35myr.  the agn is hosted by one of the galaxies located in the cluster core of abell407. we propose that it is intermittently active as it moves in the denseenvironment in the cluster core. using lofar, we can trace the relic plasmafrom that episode of activity out to greater distances from the core than everbefore.  using the the wsrt, we detect hi in absorption against the center of theradio source. the absorption profile is relatively broad (fwhm of 288 km/s),similar to what is found in other clusters.  understanding the duty cycle of the radio emission as well as the triggeringmechanism for starting (or restarting) the radio-loud activity can provideimportant constraints to quantify the impact of agn feedback on galaxyevolution. the study of these mechanisms at low frequencies using morphologicaland spectral information promises to bring new important insights in thisfield.

1507.08932	calibrating the absolute amplitude scale for air showers measured at  lofar	air showers induced by cosmic rays create nanosecond pulses detectable atradio frequencies. these pulses have been measured successfully in the past fewyears at the low frequency array (lofar) and are used to study the propertiesof cosmic rays. for a complete understanding of this phenomenon and theunderlying physical processes, an absolute calibration of the detecting antennasystem is needed. we present three approaches that were used to check andimprove the antenna model of lofar and to provide an absolute calibration ofthe whole system for air shower measurements. two methods are based oncalibrated reference sources and one on a calibration approach using thediffuse radio emission of the galaxy, optimized for short data-sets. anaccuracy of 19% in amplitude is reached. the absolute calibration is alsocompared to predictions from air shower simulations. these results are used toset an absolute energy scale for air shower measurements and can be used as abasis for an absolute scale for the measurement of astronomical transients withlofar.

1508.03889	faraday tomography of the north polar spur: constraints on the distance  to the spur and on the magnetic field of the galaxy	we present radio continuum and polarization images of the north polar spur(nps) from the global magneto-ionic medium survey (gmims) conducted with thedominion radio astrophysical observatory 26-m telescope. we fit polarizationangle versus wavelength squared over 2048 frequency channels from 1280 to 1750mhz to obtain a faraday rotation measure (rm) map of the nps. combining this rmmap with a published faraday depth map of the entire galaxy in this direction,we derive the faraday depth introduced by the nps and the galactic interstellarmedium (ism) in front of and behind the nps. the faraday depth contributed bythe nps is close to zero, indicating that the nps is an emitting only feature.the faraday depth caused by the ism in front of the nps is consistent with zeroat b&gt;50 degree, implying that this part of the nps is local at a distance ofapproximately several hundred parsecs. the faraday depth contributed by the ismbehind the nps gradually increases with galactic latitude up to b=44 degree,and decreases at higher galactic latitudes. this implies that either the partof the nps at b&lt;44 degree is distant or the nps is local but there is a signchange of the large-scale magnetic field. if the nps is local, there is then noevidence for a large-scale anti-symmetry pattern in the faraday depth of themilky way. the faraday depth introduced by the ism behind the nps at latitudesb&gt;50 degree can be explained by including a coherent vertical magnetic field.

1509.06396	wide-band, low-frequency pulse profiles of 100 radio pulsars with lofar	lofar offers the unique capability of observing pulsars across the 10-240 mhzfrequency range with a fractional bandwidth of roughly 50%. this spectral rangeis well-suited for studying the frequency evolution of pulse profile morphologycaused by both intrinsic and extrinsic effects: such as changing emissionaltitude in the pulsar magnetosphere or scatter broadening by the interstellarmedium, respectively. the magnitude of most of these effects increases rapidlytowards low frequencies. lofar can thus address a number of open questionsabout the nature of radio pulsar emission and its propagation through theinterstellar medium. we present the average pulse profiles of 100 pulsarsobserved in the two lofar frequency bands: high band (120-167 mhz, 100profiles) and low band (15-62 mhz, 26 profiles). we compare them withwesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) and lovell telescope observationsat higher frequencies (350 and1400 mhz) in order to study the profileevolution. the profiles are aligned in absolute phase by folding with a new setof timing solutions from the lovell telescope, which we present along withprecise dispersion measures obtained with lofar. we find that the profileevolution with decreasing radio frequency does not follow a specific trend but,depending on the geometry of the pulsar, new components can enter into, or behidden from, view. nonetheless, in general our observations confirm thewidening of pulsar profiles at low frequencies, as expected fromradius-to-frequency mapping or birefringence theories. we offer this catalog oflow-frequency pulsar profiles in a user friendly way via the epn database ofpulsar profiles (http://www.epta.eu.org/epndb/).

astro-ph;0512286	deep 1.4-ghz observations of diffuse polarized emission	polarized diffuse emission observations at 1.4-ghz in a high galacticlatitude area of the northern celestial hemisphere are presented. the 3.2 x 3.2deg^2 field, centred at ra = 10h 58m, dec = +42deg 18' (b1950), has galacticcoordinates l~172deg, b~+63deg and is located in the region selected asnorthern target of the bar-sport experiment. observations have been performedwith the effelsberg 100-m telescope. we find that the angular power spectra ofthe e- and b-modes have slopes of beta_e = -1.79 +/- 0.13 and beta_b = -1.74+/- 0.12, respectively. because of the very high galactic latitude and thesmooth emission, a weak faraday rotation action is expected, which allows botha fair extrapolation to cosmic microwave background polarization (cmbp)frequencies and an estimate of the contamination by galactic synchrotronemission. we extrapolate the e-mode spectrum up to 32-ghz and confirm thepossibility to safely detect the cmbp e-mode signal in the ka band found inanother low emission region (carretti et al. 2005b). extrapolated up to 90-ghz,the galactic synchrotron b-mode looks to compete with the cosmic signal onlyfor models with a tensor-to-scalar perturbation power ratio t/s &lt; 0.001, whichis even lower than the t/s value of 0.01 found to be accessible in the onlyother high galactic latitude area investigated to date. this suggests thatvalues as low as t/s = 0.01 might be accessed at high galactic latitudes. suchlow emission values can allow a significant red-shift of the best frequency todetect the cmbp b-mode, also reducing the contamination by galactic dust, andopening interesting perspectives to investigate inflation models.

astro-ph;0607300	an angular power spectrum analysis of the drao 1.4 ghz polarization  survey: implications for cmb observations	the aim of the present analysis is to improve the knowledge of thestatistical properties of the galactic diffuse synchrotron emission, whichconstrains sensitive cmb anisotropy measurements. we have analysed the new drao1.4 ghz polarization survey together with the stockert 1.4 ghz total intensitysurvey and derived the angular power spectra (apss) of the total intensity, thepolarized emission, and their cross-correlation for the entire surveys and forthree low-intensity regions. the apss of the diffuse synchrotron emission aremodelled by power laws. for the $e$ and $b$ modes, a slope of $\alpha \sim[-3.0,-2.5]$ for the multipole range $\sim [30,300]$ is found. by theextrapolation of these results to 70 ghz, we can estimate the galacticsynchrotron contamination of cmb anisotropies, and we find results that arecompatible with the ones coming from wmap 3-yr data. in the low-intensityregions, the cosmological primordial b~mode peak at $\ell \sim 100$ should beclearly observable for a tensor-to-scalar ratio $t/s \gsim 0.5$ and asynchrotron temperature spectral index $\beta \sim -3$. its detection is alsopossible for $t/s \gsim 0.005$ and $\beta \sim -3$, in case a separation of theforeground from the cmb signal could be achieved with an accuracy of $\sim5-10%$. for the te mode, a mask excluding $|b_{gal}| \le 5^{\circ}$ (for$\beta\sim -3.0$) or $|b_{gal}| \le 20^{\circ}$ (for $\beta\sim -2.8$) from thesurveys is sufficient to render the foreground contamination negligible, thusconfirming the ability of wmap to have a clear view of thetemperature-polarization correlation peak and antipeak series.

astro-ph;0611622	a sino-german lambda6 cm polarization survey of the galactic plane i.  survey strategy and results for the first survey region	(abridged) polarization measurements of the galactic plane at lambda6 cmprobe the interstellar medium (ism) to larger distances compared tomeasurements at longer wavelengths, hence enable us to investigate propertiesof the galactic magnetic fields and electron density. we are conducting a newlambda6 cm continuum and polarization survey of the galactic plane covering10degr &lt; l &lt; 230degr and |b|&lt;5degr. missing large-scale structures in the u andq maps are restored based on extrapolated polarization k-band maps from thewmap satellite. the lambda6 cm data are analyzed together with maps at otherbands. we discuss some results for the first survey region, 7degr x 10degr insize, centered at (l,b)=(125.5degr, 0degr). two new passive faraday screens,g125.6-1.8 and g124.9+0.1, were detected. they cause significant rotation ofbackground polarization angles but little depolarization. g124.9+0.1 wasidentified as a new faint hii region at a distance of 2.8 kpc. g125.6-1.8, witha size of about 46 pc, has neither correspondence in enhanced halpha emissionnor a counterpart in total intensity. a model combining foreground andbackground polarization modulated by the faraday screen was developed. usingthis model, we estimated the strength of the ordered magnetic field along theline of sight to be 3.9 microgauss for g124.9+0.1, and exceeding 6.4 microgaussfor g125.6-1.8. we obtained an estimate of 2.5 and 6.3 mk/kpc for the averagepolarized and total synchrotron emissivity towards g124.9+0.1. the synchrotronemission beyond the perseus arm is quite weak.

astro-ph;9503082	radio observations of the gamma-ray quasar 0528+134: superluminal motion  and an extreme scattering event	we report on multifrequency radio observations made with the effelsberg 100-mtelescope, the iram 30-m telescope and the green bank interferometer between1992 and 1994 of the $\gamma$-ray quasar 0528+134. we present a new vlbi basedmap of 0518+134 at 22 ghz with sub-mas angular resolution observed in november1992, which shows a one-sided core jet structure of $\sim$ 5 mas length. onecomponent, seen also previously at 8.4 ghz &amp; 22 ghz, shows apparentsuperluminal motion with $\beta_{app}$=4.4$\pm$1.7. in summer 1993 we observeda major outburst at all frequencies higher than a few ghz, which peaked a fewmonths after a strong outburst in high energy $\gamma$-rays and showed thecanonical time evolution of a cooling and/or expanding electron distribution.our data indicate that the outburst in the egret range originated very close tothe central object of the agn and that a remnant of this outburst moved furtheroutward in the jet until it became optically thin at radio frequencies after afew months. during the flare in july 1993 we observed with the effelsberg 100-mtelescope an unusually strong decrease of the flux density by about 50% at 4.75ghz and 10.55 ghz and slightly less at 2.695 ghz. this behaviour is also seenin the monitoring data at 2.25 ghz and 8.3 ghz taken with the green bankinterferometer (nrl-gbi). an extreme scattering event by a small dense plasmacloud in the line of sight is able to match the observed time lag in thelightcurves if we take into account the mas-structure of the source anddifferent spectra of the components on the basis of their brightness in thevlbi maps.

astro-ph;9512135	radio observations of the $\gamma$-ray blazar 0528+134	we report multifrequency observations of the $\gamma$-ray blazar 0528+134with the effelsberg 100-m telescope, the iram 30-m telescope, and the nrl greenbank interferometer. 0528+134 underwent a major radio and mm outburst in 1993 afew month after a very strong outburst in high energy $\gamma$-rays. a similarbehaviour is indicated for the weaker $\gamma$-ray outburst in may 1991 and themm activity in the beginning of 1992. this result fits nicely to the generalfinding that blazars are bright in $\gamma$-rays preferrentially at thebeginning of a radio outburst. 0528+134 was observed with a global vlbi arrayat 22$\,$ghz in november 1992. within the iris-s and europe geodetic vlbiobserving campaigns the source was also observed regularly at 8.4$\,$ghz. a newvlbi component which is not present in data at 22 $\,$ghz from 1991 alsoexhibits superluminal motion. backextra\-polating in time we find that the newcomponent was expelled from the core in the first half of 1991, near the first$\gamma$-ray outburst in mai 1991. newest vlbi data indicate the appearance ofanother new component in 1994. although this new component has yet been foundonly at two epochs, it appears to move superluminally and may have beenexpelled from the core between fall 1992 and summer 1993, i.e. near the time ofthe second gamma ray outburst and at the beginning of a strong radio outburst.

astro-ph;9602113	is there a correlation between radio and gamma ray luminosities of agn ?	the possibility of a correlation between the radio (cm)- and $\gamma$-rayluminosity of variable agn seen by egret is investigated. we performedmonte-carlo simulations of typical data sets and applied different correlationtechniques (partial correlation analysis, $\chi^2$-test applied on flux-fluxrelations) in view of a truncation bias caused by sensitivity limits of thesurveys. for k-corrected flux densities, we find that with the least squaresmethod only a linear correlation can be recovered. partial correlation analysison the other side provides a robust tool to detect correlations even influx-limited samples if intrinsic scatter does not exceed $\sim 40$ \% of theoriginal $\gamma$-ray luminosity. the analysis presented in this paper takesinto account redshift bias and truncation effects simultaneously which wasnever considered in earlier papers.  applying this analysis to simultaneously observed radio- and $\gamma$-raydata, no correlation is found. however, an artificial correlation appears whenusing the mean flux. this is probably due to the reduction of the dynamicalrange in the flux-flux relation. furthermore, we show that comparing theemission in both spectral bands at a high activity state leads to no convincingcorrelation.  in conclusion, we can not confirm a correlation between radio and$\gamma$-ray luminosities of agn which is claimed in previous works.

astro-ph;9609189	the large-scale structure of the diffuse radio halo of the coma cluster  at 1.4 ghz	we present new measurements of the diffuse radio emission from the comacluster of galaxies at 1.4 ghz using the effelsberg 100-m-telescope. the halosource coma c has an extent down to noise of about 80 arcmin corresponding to 3mpc (h_0 = 50 km/s/mpc) in coma. the radio map reveals clear similarities withimages of the extended x-ray halo of the coma cluster. after subtracting thecontributions from point sources we obtained an integrated diffuse flux densityof s = 640 +- 35 mjy from coma c. we derive relations between the variousobservationally determined spectral indices and the spectral index of thesynchrotron emissivity, which allow one to achieve a rough estimate concerningthe consistency of the presently available data at different frequencies and toplace constraints on the emissivity index distribution. in the halo's coreregion, the inferred emissivity index between 0.3 ghz and 1.4 ghz appears to bein the range 0.4 - 0.75 implying that there must be some very effectivemechanism for particle acceleration operating in the intracluster medium.

astro-ph;9905023	a 1.4 ghz radio continuum and polarization survey at medium galactic  latitudes: ii. first section	we present the first section of a radio continuum and polarization survey atmedium galactic latitudes carried out with the effelsberg 100-m telescope at1.4 ghz. four large fields have been observed, which all together cover an areaof about 1100 square degree. the rms-sensitivity is about 15 mk tb (about 7mjy/beam area) in total intensity and is limited by confusion. a sensitivity of8 mk tb is obtained in linear polarization. the angular resolution of theobservations is 9.35 arcminute. the maps in total intensity and linearpolarization have been absolutely calibrated by low resolution data whereavailable. significant linear polarization is seen in all the maps. in general,the intensity fluctuations measured in linear polarization are not correlatedwith total intensity structures. areas of high polarization of some degreesextent are seen, again with no apparent corresponding total intensity feature.modulation of polarized background emission by spatially varying faradayrotation seems the most likely explanation. quite unexpected is the detectionof filamentary and ring-like depolarization structures in the direction of theanticentre region, whose extents are up to about 3 degree.
