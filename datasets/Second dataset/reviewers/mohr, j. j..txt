0911.2444	sunyaev-zel'dovich cluster profiles measured with the south pole  telescope	we present sunyaev-zel'dovich measurements of 15 massive x-ray selectedgalaxy clusters obtained with the south pole telescope. the sunyaev-zel'dovich(sz) cluster signals are measured at 150 ghz, and concurrent 220 ghz data areused to reduce astrophysical contamination. radial profiles are computed usinga technique that takes into account the effects of the beams and filtering. inseveral clusters, significant sz decrements are detected out to a substantialfraction of the virial radius. the profiles are fit to the beta model and to ageneralized nfw pressure profile, and are scaled and stacked to probe theiraverage behavior. we find model parameters that are consistent with previousstudies: beta=0.86 and r_core/r_500 = 0.20 for the beta model, and (alpha,beta, gamma, c_500)=(1.0,5.5,0.5,1.0) for the generalized nfw model. bothmodels fit the spt data comparably well, and both are consistent with theaverage sz profile out to the virial radius. the integrated compton-y parametery_sz is computed for each cluster using both model-dependent andmodel-independent techniques, and the results are compared to x-ray estimatesof cluster parameters. we find that y_sz scales with y_x and gas mass with lowscatter. since these observables have been found to scale with total mass, ourresults point to a tight mass-observable relation for the spt cluster survey.

0912.1848	hydrodynamic simulations of correlation and scatter in galaxy cluster  maps	the two dimensional structure of hot gas in galaxy clusters containsinformation about the hydrodynamical state of the cluster, which can be used tounderstand the origin of scatter in the thermodynamical properties of the gas,and to improve the use of clusters to probe cosmology. using a set ofhydrodynamical simulations, we provide a comparison between various mapscurrently employed in the x-ray analysis of merging clusters and those clustermaps anticipated from forthcoming observations of the thermalsunyaev-zel'dovich effect. we show the following: 1) an x-ray pseudo-pressure,defined as square root of the soft band x-ray image times the temperature mapis a good proxy for the sz map; 2) we find that clumpiness is the main reasonfor deviation between x-ray pseudo-pressure and sz maps; 3) the level ofclumpiness can be well characterized by x-ray pseudo-entropy maps. 4) wedescribe the frequency of deviation in various maps of clusters as a functionof the amplitude of the deviation. this enables both a comparison toobservations and a comparison to effects of introduction of complex physicalprocesses into simulation.

0912.2338	extragalactic millimeter-wave sources in south pole telescope survey  data: source counts, catalog, and statistics for an 87 square-degree field	we report the results of an 87 square-degree point-source survey centered atr.a. 5h30m, decl. -55 deg. taken with the south pole telescope (spt) at 1.4 and2.0 mm wavelengths with arc-minute resolution and milli-jansky depth. based onthe ratio of flux in the two bands, we separate the detected sources into twopopulations, one consistent with synchrotron emission from active galacticnuclei (agn) and one consistent with thermal emission from dust. we presentsource counts for each population from 11 to 640 mjy at 1.4 mm and from 4.4 to800 mjy at 2.0 mm. the 2.0 mm counts are dominated by synchrotron-dominatedsources across our reported flux range; the 1.4 mm counts are dominated bysynchroton-dominated sources above ~15 mjy and by dust-dominated sources belowthat flux level. we detect 141 synchrotron-dominated sources and 47dust-dominated sources at s/n &gt; 4.5 in at least one band. all of the mostsignificantly detected members of the synchrotron-dominated population areassociated with sources in previously published radio catalogs. some of thedust-dominated sources are associated with nearby (z &lt;&lt; 1) galaxies whose dustemission is also detected by the infrared astronomy satellite (iras). however,most of the bright, dust-dominated sources have no counterparts in any existingcatalogs. we argue that these sources represent the rarest and brightestmembers of the population commonly referred to as sub-millimeter galaxies(smgs). because these sources are selected at longer wavelengths than intypical smg surveys, they are expected to have a higher mean redshiftdistribution and may provide a new window on galaxy formation in the earlyuniverse.

0912.4315	angular power spectra of the millimeter wavelength background light from  dusty star-forming galaxies with the south pole telescope	we use data from the first 100 square-degree field observed by the south poletelescope (spt) in 2008 to measure the angular power spectrum of temperatureanisotropies contributed by the background of dusty star-forming galaxies(dsfgs) at millimeter wavelengths. from the auto and cross-correlation of 150and 220 ghz spt maps, we significantly detect both poisson distributed and, forthe first time at millimeter wavelengths, clustered components of power from abackground of dsfgs. the spectral indices between 150 and 220 ghz of thepoisson and clustered components are found to be 3.86 +- 0.23 and 3.8 +- 1.3respectively, implying a steep scaling of the dust emissivity index beta ~ 2.the poisson and clustered power detected in spt, blast (at 600, 860, and 1200ghz), and spitzer (1900 ghz) data can be understood in the context of a simplemodel in which all galaxies have the same graybody spectrum with dustemissivity index of beta = 2 and dust temperature t_d = 34 k. in this model,half of the 150 ghz background light comes from redshifts greater than 3.2. wealso use the spt data to place an upper limit on the amplitude of the kineticsunyaev-zel'dovich power spectrum at l = 3000 of 13 uk^2 at 95% confidence.

1003.0003	galaxy clusters selected with the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from 2008  south pole telescope observations	we present a detection-significance-limited catalog of 21 sunyaev-zel'dovichselected galaxy clusters. these clusters, along with 1 unconfirmed candidate,were identified in 178 deg^2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the south poletelescope to a depth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz. optical imaging from theblanco cosmology survey (bcs) and magellan telescopes provided photometric (andin some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts rangingfrom z=0.15 to z&gt;1, with a median z = 0.74. of the 21 confirmed galaxyclusters, three were previously identified as abell clusters, three werepresented as spt discoveries in staniszewski et al, 2009, and three were firstidentified in a recent analysis of bcs data by menanteau et al, 2010; theremaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. simulatedobservations of the spt fields predict the sample to be nearly 100% completeabove a mass threshold of m_200 ~ 5x10^14 m_sun/h at z = 0.6. this completenessthreshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to ~4x10^14m_sun/h at z=1. the size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in goodagreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxyclusters and cosmology. in combination with other cosmological probes, we usethe cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. assuming astandard spatially flat wcdm cosmological model, the addition of our catalog tothe wmap 7-year analysis yields sigma_8 = 0.81 +- 0.09 and w = -1.07 +- 0.29, a~50% improvement in precision on both parameters over wmap7 alone.

1006.3068	x-ray properties of the first sze-selected galaxy cluster sample from  the south pole telescope	we present results of x-ray observations of a sample of 15 clusters selectedvia their imprint on the cosmic microwave background (cmb) from the thermalsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. these clusters are a subset of the firstsz-selected cluster catalog, obtained from observations of 178 deg^2 of skysurveyed by the south pole telescope. using x-ray observations with chandra andxmm-newton, we estimate the temperature, t_x, and mass, m_g, of theintracluster medium (icm) within r_500 for each cluster. from these, wecalculate y_x=m_g t_x and estimate the total cluster mass using a m_500-y_xscaling relation measured from previous x-ray studies. the integratedcomptonization, y_sz, is derived from the sz measurements, using additionalinformation from the x-ray measured gas density profiles and a universaltemperature profile. we calculate scaling relations between the x-ray and szobservables, and find results generally consistent with other measurements andthe expectations from simple self-similar behavior. specifically, we fit ay_sz-y_x relation and find a normalization of 0.82 +- 0.07, marginallyconsistent with the predicted ratio of y_sz/y_x=0.91+-0.01 that would beexpected from the density and temperature models used in this work. using they_x derived mass estimates, we fit a y_sz-m_500 relation and find a slopeconsistent with the self-similar expectation of y_sz ~ m^5/3 with anormalization consistent with predictions from other x-ray studies. we comparethe x-ray mass estimates to previously published sz mass estimates derived fromcosmological simulations of the spt survey. we find that the sz mass estimatesare lower by a factor of 0.89+-0.06, which is within the ~15% systematicuncertainty quoted for the simulation-based sz masses.

1012.4788	improved constraints on cosmic microwave background secondary  anisotropies from the complete 2008 south pole telescope data	we report measurements of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) powerspectrum from the complete 2008 south pole telescope (spt) data set. we analyzetwice as much data as the first spt power spectrum analysis, using an improvedcosmological parameter estimator which fits multi-frequency models to the spt150 and $220\,$ghz bandpowers. we find an excellent fit to the measuredbandpowers with a model that includes lensed primary cmb anisotropy, secondarythermal (tsz) and kinetic (ksz) sunyaev-zel'dovich anisotropies, unclusteredsynchrotron point sources, and clustered dusty point sources. in addition tomeasuring the power spectrum of dusty galaxies at high signal-to-noise, thedata primarily constrain a linear combination of the ksz and tsz anisotropycontributions at $150\,$ghz and $\ell=3000$: $d^{tsz}_{3000} +0.5\,d^{ksz}_{3000} = 4.5\pm 1.0 \,\mu{\rm k}^2$. the 95% confidence upperlimits on secondary anisotropy power are $d^{tsz}_{3000} &lt; 5.3\,\mu{\rm k}^2$and $d^{ksz}_{3000} &lt; 6.5\,\mu{\rm k}^2$. we also consider the potentialcorrelation of dusty and tsz sources, and find it incapable of relaxing the tszupper limit. these results increase the significance of the lower than expectedtsz amplitude previously determined from spt power spectrum measurements. wefind that models including non-thermal pressure support in groups and clusterspredict tsz power in better agreement with the spt data. combining the tszpower measurement with primary cmb data halves the statistical uncertainty on$\sigma_8$. however, the preferred value of $\sigma_8$ varies significantlybetween tsz models. improved constraints on cosmological parameters from tszpower spectrum measurements require continued progress in the modeling of thetsz power.

1101.1286	discovery and cosmological implications of spt-cl j2106-5844, the most  massive known cluster at z &gt; 1	using the south pole telescope (spt), we have discovered the most massiveknown galaxy cluster at z &gt; 1, spt-cl j2106-5844. in addition to producing astrong sunyaev-zel'dovich effect signal, this system is a luminous x-ray sourceand its numerous constituent galaxies display spatial and color clustering, allindicating the presence of a massive galaxy cluster. vlt and magellanspectroscopy of 18 member galaxies shows that the cluster is at z =1.132^+0.002_-0.003. chandra observations obtained through a combined hrc-acisgto program reveal an x-ray spectrum with an fe k line redshifted by z = 1.18+/- 0.03. these redshifts are consistent with galaxy colors in extensiveoptical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared imaging. spt-cl j2106-5844 displaysextreme x-ray properties for a cluster, having a core-excluded temperature ofkt = 11.0^+2.6_-1.9 kev and a luminosity (within r_500) of l_x (0.5 - 2.0 kev)= (13.9 +/- 1.0) x 10^44 erg/s. the combined mass estimate from measurements ofthe sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and x-ray data is m_200 = (1.27 +/- 0.21) x 10^15m_sun. the discovery of such a massive gravitationally collapsed system at highredshift provides an interesting laboratory for galaxy formation and evolution,and is a powerful probe of extreme perturbations of the primordial matterdensity field. we discuss the latter, determining that, under the assumption oflambdacdm cosmology with only gaussian perturbations, there is only a 7% chanceof finding a galaxy cluster similar to spt-cl j2106-5844 in the 2500 deg^2 sptsurvey region, and that only one such galaxy cluster is expected in the entiresky.

1111.0932	a measurement of secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies with  two years of south pole telescope observations	we present the first three-frequency south pole telescope (spt) cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) power spectra. the band powers presented here coverangular scales 2000 &lt; ell &lt; 9400 in frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and220 ghz. at these frequencies and angular scales, a combination of the primarycmb anisotropy, thermal and kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effects, radiogalaxies, and cosmic infrared background (cib) contributes to the signal. wecombine planck and spt data at 220 ghz to constrain the amplitude and shape ofthe cib power spectrum and find strong evidence for non-linear clustering. weexplore the sz results using a variety of cosmological models for the cmb andcib anisotropies and find them to be robust with one exception: allowing forspatial correlations between the thermal sz effect and cib significantlydegrades the sz constraints. neglecting this potential correlation, we find thethermal sz power at 150 ghz and ell = 3000 to be 3.65 +/- 0.69 muk^2, and setan upper limit on the kinetic sz power to be less than 2.8 muk^2 at 95%confidence. when a correlation between the thermal sz and cib is allowed, weconstrain a linear combination of thermal and kinetic sz power: d_{3000}^{tsz}+ 0.5 d_{3000}^{ksz} = 4.60 +/- 0.63 muk^2, consistent with earliermeasurements. we use the measured thermal sz power and an analytic, thermal szmodel calibrated with simulations to determine sigma8 = 0.807 +/- 0.016.modeling uncertainties involving the astrophysics of the intracluster mediumrather than the statistical uncertainty in the measured band powers are thedominant source of uncertainty on sigma8 . we also place an upper limit on thekinetic sz power produced by patchy reionization; a companion paper uses theselimits to constrain the reionization history of the universe.

1112.5435	cosmological constraints from sunyaev-zel'dovich-selected clusters with  x-ray observations in the first 178 square degrees of the south pole  telescope survey	we use measurements from the south pole telescope (spt) sunyaev zel'dovich(sz) cluster survey in combination with x-ray measurements to constraincosmological parameters. we present a statistical method that fits for thescaling relations of the sz and x-ray cluster observables with mass whilejointly fitting for cosmology. the method is generalizable to multiple clusterobservables, and self-consistently accounts for the effects of the clusterselection and uncertainties in cluster mass calibration on the derivedcosmological constraints. we apply this method to a data set consisting of ansz-selected catalog of 18 galaxy clusters at z &gt; 0.3 from the first 178 deg2 ofthe 2500 deg2 spt-sz survey, with 14 clusters having x-ray observations fromeither chandra or xmm. assuming a spatially flat lcdm cosmological model, wefind the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 (omega_m/0.25)^0.30 = 0.785 +-0.037. in combination with measurements of the cmb power spectrum from the sptand the seven-year wmap data, the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 = 0.795+- 0.016 and omega_m = 0.255 +- 0.016, a factor of 1.5 improvement on eachparameter over the cmb data alone. we consider several extensions beyond thelcdm model by including the following as free parameters: the dark energyequation of state (w), the sum of the neutrino masses (sum mnu), the effectivenumber of relativistic species (neff), and a primordial non-gaussianity (fnl).we find that adding the spt cluster data significantly improves the constraintson w and sum mnu beyond those found when using measurements of the cmb,supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the hubble constant. consideringeach extension independently, we best constrain w=-0.973 +- 0.063 and the sumof neutrino masses sum mnu &lt; 0.28 ev at 95% confidence, a factor of 1.25 and1.4 improvement, respectively, over the constraints without clusters.

1202.0546	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the microwave background using  south pole telescope data	we use south pole telescope data from 2008 and 2009 to detect thenon-gaussian signature in the cosmic microwave background (cmb) produced bygravitational lensing and to measure the power spectrum of the projectedgravitational potential. we constrain the ratio of the measured amplitude ofthe lensing signal to that expected in a fiducial lcdm cosmological model to be0.86 +/- 0.16, with no lensing disfavored at 6.3 sigma. marginalizing over lcdmcosmological models allowed by the wmap7 results in a measurement ofa_lens=0.90+/-0.19, indicating that the amplitude of matter fluctuations overthe redshift range 0.5 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 5 probed by cmb lensing is in good agreementwith predictions. we present the results of several consistency checks. theseinclude a clear detection of the lensing signature in cmb maps filtered to haveno overlap in fourier space, as well as a "curl" diagnostic that is consistentwith the signal expected for lcdm. we perform a detailed study of bias in themeasurement due to noise, foregrounds, and other effects and determine thatthese contributions are relatively small compared to the statisticaluncertainty in the measurement. we combine this lensing measurement withresults from wmap7 to improve constraints on cosmological parameters whencompared to those from wmap7 alone: we find a factor of 3.9 improvement in themeasurement of the spatial curvature of the universe, omega_k=-0.0014+/-0.0172;a 10% improvement in the amplitude of matter fluctuations within lcdm,sigma_8=0.810+/ 0.026; and a 5% improvement in the dark energy equation ofstate, w=-1.04+/-0.40. when compared with the measurement of w provided by thecombination of wmap7 and external constraints on the hubble parameter, theaddition of the lensing data improve the measurement of w by 15% to givew=-1.087+/-0.096.

0710.5782	evolution of the intracluster medium between 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.3 in a chandra  sample of 70 galaxy clusters	we study the evolution of the icm with a sample of 70 galaxy clustersspanning 0.18 &lt; z &lt; 1.24. we find that x-ray luminosity and icm mass at a fixedtemperature evolve with redshift in a manner inconsistent with the standardself-similar model of cluster formation. both luminosity and icm mass evolvemore slowly toward high redshift than the self-similar prediction. we find thatevolution in these two observables can be modeled by a simple evolution in thecluster gas mass fraction. excluding cluster cores from measurements results inevolution more consistent with the self-similar model than when the entirecluster is used, indicating that the fraction of clusters with cool coresincreases with time, or that cool cores become more developed over time inthose clusters that have them; this is supported by direct study of theredshift dependence of central surface brightness, which increases in scatterand magnitude at low redshift. we find that isophotal size-temperaturerelations evolve differently according to which isophote is used, indicatingthat the central and outer regions of cluster icm evolve differently. we showthat constraints on the evolution of the gas fraction and isophotalsize-temperature relations constraints can be combined to measure clusterdistances, and thus to constrain cosmological parameters. there are indicationsthat scaling relation scatter decreases at higher redshift, suggesting thatmerging is not the dominant source of cluster structural variation. our resultsprovide constraints for simulations attempting to model cluster physics,indicate some difficulties for cosmological studies that assume constantcluster gas fractions, and point toward other potentially more robust uses ofclusters for cosmological applications.

1204.1210	the blanco cosmology survey: data acquisition, processing, calibration,  quality diagnostics and data release	the blanco cosmology survey (bcs) is a 60 night imaging survey of $\sim$80deg$^2$ of the southern sky located in two fields: ($\alpha$,$\delta$)= (5 hr,$-55^{\circ}$) and (23 hr, $-55^{\circ}$). the survey was carried out between2005 and 2008 in $griz$ bands with the mosaic2 imager on the blanco 4mtelescope. the primary aim of the bcs survey is to provide the data required tooptically confirm and measure photometric redshifts for sunyaev-zel'dovicheffect selected galaxy clusters from the south pole telescope and the atacamacosmology telescope. we process and calibrate the bcs data, carrying out psfcorrected model fitting photometry for all detected objects. the median10$\sigma$ galaxy (point source) depths over the survey in $griz$ areapproximately 23.3 (23.9), 23.4 (24.0), 23.0 (23.6) and 21.3 (22.1),respectively. the astrometric accuracy relative to the usno-b survey is$\sim45$ milli-arcsec. we calibrate our absolute photometry using the stellarlocus in $grizj$ bands, and thus our absolute photometric scale derives from2mass which has $\sim2$% accuracy. the scatter of stars about the stellar locusindicates a systematics floor in the relative stellar photometric scatter in$griz$ that is $\sim$1.9%, $\sim$2.2%, $\sim$2.7% and$\sim$2.7%, respectively.a simple cut in the astromatic star-galaxy classifier {\tt spread\_model}produces a star sample with good spatial uniformity. we use the resultingphotometric catalogs to calibrate photometric redshifts for the survey anddemonstrate scatter $\delta z/(1+z)=0.054$ with an outlier fraction $\eta&lt;5$%to $z\sim1$. we highlight some selected science results to date and provide afull description of the released data products.

1205.3103	weak-lensing mass measurements of five galaxy clusters in the south pole  telescope survey using magellan/megacam	we use weak gravitational lensing to measure the masses of five galaxyclusters selected from the south pole telescope (spt) survey, with the primarygoal of comparing these with the spt sunyaev--zel'dovich (sz) and x-ray basedmass estimates. the clusters span redshifts 0.28 &lt; z &lt; 0.43 and have massesm_500 &gt; 2 x 10^14 h^-1 m_sun, and three of the five clusters were discovered bythe spt survey. we observed the clusters in the g'r'i' passbands with themegacam imager on the magellan clay 6.5m telescope. we measure a mean ratio ofweak lensing (wl) aperture masses to inferred aperture masses from the sz data,both within an aperture of r_500,sz derived from the sz mass, of 1.04 +/- 0.18.we measure a mean ratio of spherical wl masses evaluated at r_500,sz tospherical sz masses of 1.07 +/- 0.18, and a mean ratio of spherical wl massesevaluated at r_500,wl to spherical sz masses of 1.10 +/- 0.24. we explorepotential sources of systematic error in the mass comparisons and conclude thatall are subdominant to the statistical uncertainty, with dominant terms beingcluster concentration uncertainty and n-body simulation calibration bias.expanding the sample of spt clusters with wl observations has the potential tosignificantly improve the spt cluster mass calibration and the resultingcosmological constraints from the spt cluster survey. these are the first wldetections using megacam on the magellan clay telescope.

1207.4369	redshifts, sample purity, and bcg positions for the galaxy cluster  catalog from the first 720 square degrees of the south pole telescope survey	we present the results of the ground- and space-based optical andnear-infrared (nir) follow-up of 224 galaxy cluster candidates detected withthe sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect in the 720 deg^2 of the south pole telescope(spt) survey completed in the 2008 and 2009 observing seasons. we use theoptical/nir data to establish whether each candidate is associated with anoverdensity of galaxies and to estimate the cluster redshift. most photometricredshifts are derived through a combination of three different cluster redshiftestimators using red-sequence galaxies, resulting in an accuracy of \deltaz/(1+z)=0.017, determined through comparison with a subsample of 57 clustersfor which we have spectroscopic redshifts. we successfully measure redshiftsfor 158 systems and present redshift lower limits for the remaining candidates.the redshift distribution of the confirmed clusters extends to z=1.35 with amedian of z_{med}=0.57. approximately 18% of the sample with measured redshiftslies at z&gt;0.8. we estimate a lower limit to the purity of this spt sz-selectedsample by assuming that all unconfirmed clusters are noise fluctuations in thespt data. we show that the cumulative purity at detection significance \xi&gt;5(\xi&gt;4.5) is &gt;= 95 (&gt;= 70%). we present the red brightest cluster galaxy (rbcg)positions for the sample and examine the offsets between the spt candidateposition and the rbcg. the radial distribution of offsets is similar to thatseen in x-ray-selected cluster samples, providing no evidence that sz-selectedcluster samples include a different fraction of recent mergers thanx-ray-selected cluster samples.

1208.2962	a massive, cooling-flow-induced starburst in the core of a highly  luminous galaxy cluster	in the cores of some galaxy clusters the hot intracluster plasma is denseenough that it should cool radiatively in the cluster's lifetime, leading tocontinuous "cooling flows" of gas sinking towards the cluster center, yet nosuch cooling flow has been observed. the low observed star formation rates andcool gas masses for these "cool core" clusters suggest that much of the coolingmust be offset by astrophysical feedback to prevent the formation of a runawaycooling flow. here we report x-ray, optical, and infrared observations of thegalaxy cluster spt-clj2344-4243 at z = 0.596. these observations reveal anexceptionally luminous (l_2-10 kev = 8.2 x 10^45 erg/s) galaxy cluster whichhosts an extremely strong cooling flow (dm/dt = 3820 +/- 530 msun/yr). further,the central galaxy in this cluster appears to be experiencing a massivestarburst (740 +/- 160 msun/yr), which suggests that the feedback sourceresponsible for preventing runaway cooling in nearby cool core clusters may notyet be fully established in spt-clj2344-4243. this large star formation rateimplies that a significant fraction of the stars in the central galaxy of thiscluster may form via accretion of the intracluster medium, rather than thecurrent picture of central galaxies assembling entirely via mergers.

1312.2462	constraints on the cmb temperature evolution using multi-band  measurements of the sunyaev zel'dovich effect with the south pole telescope	the adiabatic evolution of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) is a key prediction of standard cosmology. we study deviations from theexpected adiabatic evolution of the cmb temperature of the form $t(z)=t_0(1+z)^{1-\alpha}$ using measurements of the spectrum of the sunyaevzel'dovich effect with the south pole telescope (spt). we present a method forusing the ratio of the sunyaev zel'dovich signal measured at 95 and 150 ghz inthe spt data to constrain the temperature of the cmb. we demonstrate that thisapproach provides unbiased results using mock observations of clusters from anew set of hydrodynamical simulations. we apply this method to a sample of 158spt-selected clusters, spanning the redshift range $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 1.35$, andmeasure $\alpha = 0.017^{+0.030}_{-0.028}$, consistent with the standard modelprediction of $\alpha=0$. in combination with other published results, weconstrain $\alpha = 0.011 \pm 0.016$, an improvement of $\sim 20\%$ overpublished constraints. this measurement also provides a strong constraint onthe effective equation of state in models of decaying dark energy$w_\mathrm{eff} = -0.987^{+0.016}_{-0.017}$.

1312.3015	measurement of galaxy cluster integrated comptonization and mass scaling  relations with the south pole telescope	we describe a method for measuring the integrated comptonization (ysz) ofclusters of galaxies from measurements of the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect inmultiple frequency bands and use this method to characterize a sample of galaxyclusters detected in south pole telescope (spt) data. we test this method onsimulated cluster observations and verify that it can accurately recovercluster parameters with negligible bias. in realistic simulations of anspt-like survey, with realizations of cosmic microwave background anisotropy,point sources, and atmosphere and instrumental noise at typical spt-sz surveylevels, we find that ysz is most accurately determined in an aperturecomparable to the spt beam size. we demonstrate the utility of this method tomeasure ysz and to constrain mass scaling relations using x-ray mass estimatesfor a sample of 18 galaxy clusters from the spt-sz survey. measuring ysz withina 0.75' radius aperture, we find an intrinsic log-normal scatter of 21+/-11% inysz at a fixed mass. measuring ysz within a 0.3 mpc projected radius(equivalent to 0.75' at the survey median redshift z = 0.6), we find a scatterof 26+/-9%. prior to this study, the spt observable found to have the lowestscatter with mass was cluster detection significance. we demonstrate, from bothsimulations and spt observed clusters, that ysz measured within an aperturecomparable to the spt beam size is equivalent, in terms of scatter with clustermass, to spt cluster detection significance.

1404.6250	the redshift evolution of the mean temperature, pressure, and entropy  profiles in 80 spt-selected galaxy clusters	(abridged) we present the results of an x-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clustersselected in the 2500 deg^2 south pole telescope survey and observed with thechandra x-ray observatory. we divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20clusters based on redshift and central density, performing an x-ray fit to allclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of thetemperature profile. this approach allows us to constrain the shape of thetemperature profile over 0&lt;r&lt;1.5r500, which would be impossible on aper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, onaverage, 2000 x-ray counts. the results presented here represent the firstconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 toz=1.2. we find that high-z (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler bothin the inner (r&lt;0.1r500) and outer (r&gt;r500) regions than their low-z(0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6) counterparts. combining the average temperature profile withmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the averagepressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. overall, our observedpressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of thecore. we find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile atr&lt;0.7r500. we observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r&gt;r500 inour high-z subsample. this flattening is consistent with a temperature bias dueto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 kev) halos, which would goundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. thiswork demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved clusterproperties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but thenumber of observed clusters is high.

1506.06912	cosmodm and its application to pan-starrs data	the cosmology data management system (cosmodm) is an automated and flexibledata management system for the processing and calibration of data from opticalphotometric surveys. it is designed to run on supercomputers and to minimizedisk i/o to enable scaling to very high throughput during periods ofreprocessing. it serves as an early prototype for one element of theground-based processing required by the euclid mission and will also beemployed in the preparation of ground based data needed in the erosita x-rayall sky survey mission. cosmodm consists of two main pipelines. the first isthe single-epoch or detrending pipeline, which is used to carry out thephotometric and astrometric calibration of raw exposures. the second is the co-addition pipeline, which combines the data from individual exposures intodeeper coadd images and science ready catalogs. a novel feature of cosmodm isthat it uses a modified stack of as- tromatic software which can read and writetile compressed images. since 2011, cosmodm has been used to process data fromthe decam, the cfht megacam and the pan-starrs cameras. in this paper we shalldescribe how processed pan-starrs data from cosmodm has been used to opticallyconfirm and measure photometric redshifts of planck-based sunyaev-zeldovicheffect selected cluster candidates.

1507.05090	weak lensing by galaxy troughs in des science verification data	we measure the weak lensing shear around galaxy troughs, i.e. the radialalignment of background galaxies relative to underdensities in projections ofthe foreground galaxy field over a wide range of redshift in scienceverification data from the dark energy survey. our detection of the shearsignal is highly significant (10 to 15$\sigma$ for the smallest angular scales)for troughs with the redshift range z in [0.2,0.5] of the projected galaxyfield and angular diameters of 10 arcmin...1{\deg}. these measurements probethe connection between the galaxy, matter density, and convergence fields. byassuming galaxies are biased tracers of the matter density with poissoniannoise, we find agreement of our measurements with predictions in a fiduciallambda cold dark matter model. the prediction for the lensing signal on largetrough scales is virtually independent of the details of the underlying modelfor the connection of galaxies and matter. our comparison of the shear aroundtroughs with that around cylinders with large galaxy counts is consistent witha symmetry between galaxy and matter over- and underdensities. in addition, wemeasure the two-point angular correlation of troughs with galaxies which, incontrast to the lensing signal, is sensitive to galaxy bias on all scales. thelensing signal of troughs and their clustering with galaxies is therefore apromising probe of the statistical properties of matter underdensities andtheir connection to the galaxy field.

astro-ph;0007126	the infall region of abell 576: independent mass and light profiles	we describe observations of the nearby cluster of galaxies a576 beyond thevirial radius and into the infall region. using 1057 redshifts, we use theinfall pattern in redshift space to determine the mass profile of a576 to aradius of ~4 mpc/h. this mass estimation technique makes no assumptions aboutthe equilibrium state of the cluster. within 1 mpc/h, the mass profile wederive exceeds that determined from x-ray observations by a factor of 2.5. at\~2.5 mpc/h, however, the mass profile agrees with virial mass estimates. ourmass profile is consistent with a nfw or hernquist profile, but it isinconsistent with an isothermal sphere. r-band images of a $3^\circ x 3^\circ$region centered on the cluster allow an independent determination of thecluster light profile. we calculate the integrated mass-to-light ratio as afunction of cluster radius; it decreases smoothly from the core to ~4 mpc/h.the differential dm/dl_r profile decreases more steeply; we find m/l_r ~100 hat ~4 mpc/h, in good agreement with the mass-to-light ratios of individualgalaxies. this value implies $\omega_m \lesssim 0.4$ at 95% confidence. for ahernquist model, the best-fit mass profiles differ from the observed surfacenumber density of galaxies; the galaxies have a larger scale radius than themass. this result is consistent with the centrally peaked $m/l_r$ profile.similarly, the scale radius of the light profile is larger than that of themass profile. we discuss some potential systematic effects; none can easilyreconcile our results with a constant mass-to-light ratio.

astro-ph;9904429	the effects of clumping and substructure on icm mass measurements	we examine an ensemble of 48 simulated clusters to determine the effects ofsmall-scale density fluctuations and large-scale substructure on x-raymeasurements of the intracluster medium (icm) mass. we measure rms densityfluctuations in the icm which can be characterized by a mean mass-weightedclumping factor c = &lt;rho^2&gt;/&lt;rho&gt;^2 between 1.3 and 1.4 within a densitycontrast of 500 times the critical density. these fluctuations arise from thecluster history of accretion shocks and major mergers, and their presenceenhances the cluster's luminosity relative to the smooth case. we expect,therefore, that icm mass measurements utilizing models which assume uniformdensity at a given radius carry a bias of order sqrt(c) = 1.16. we verify thisresult by performing icm mass measurements on x-ray images of the simulationsand finding the expected level of bias.  the varied cluster morphologies in our ensemble also allow us to investigatethe effects of departures from spherical symmetry on our measurements. we findthat the presence of large-scale substructure does not further bias theresulting gas mass unless it is pronounced enough to produce a second peak inthe image of at least 1% the maximum surface brightness. we analyze the subsetof images with no secondary peaks and find a bias of 9% and a gaussian randomerror of 4% in the derived mass.

0810.1578	galaxy clusters discovered with a sunyaev-zel'dovich effect survey	the south pole telescope (spt) is conducting a sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effectsurvey over large areas of the southern sky, searching for massive galaxyclusters to high redshift. in this preliminary study, we focus on a 40square-degree area targeted by the blanco cosmology survey (bcs), which iscentered roughly at right ascension 5h30m, declination -53 degrees. over twoseasons of observations, this entire region has been mapped by the spt at 95ghz, 150 ghz, and 225 ghz. we report the four most significant spt detectionsof sz clusters in this field, three of which were previously unknown and,therefore, represent the first galaxy clusters discovered with an sz survey.the sz clusters are detected as decrements with greater than 5-sigmasignificance in the high-sensitivity 150 ghz spt map. the sz spectrum of thesesources is confirmed by detections of decrements at the corresponding locationsin the 95 ghz spt map and non-detections at those locations in the 225 ghz sptmap. multiband optical images from the bcs survey demonstrate significantconcentrations of similarly colored galaxies at the positions of the szdetections. photometric redshift estimates from the bcs data indicate that twoof the clusters lie at moderate redshift (z ~ 0.4) and two at high redshift (z&gt;~ 0.8). one of the sz detections was previously identified as a galaxy clusterusing x-ray data from the rosat all-sky survey (rass). potential rasscounterparts (not previously identified as clusters) are also found for two ofthe new discoveries. these first four galaxy clusters are the most significantsz detections from a subset of the ongoing spt survey. as such, they serve as ademonstration that sz surveys, and the spt in particular, can be an effectivemeans for finding galaxy clusters.
