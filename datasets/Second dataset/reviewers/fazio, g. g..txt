0901.2447	the dusty nebula surrounding hr car: a spitzer view	we present mid-ir observations of the galactic luminous blue variable (lbv)hr car and its associated nebula carried out with the spitzer space telescopeusing both irac and irs, as part of a gto program aimed to study stellar ejectafrom evolved stars. our observations reveal a rich mid-ir spectrum of the innernebula showing both solid state and atomic gas signatures. stronglow-excitation atomic fine structure lines such as $ 26.0 \mu$m [\ion{fe}{2}]and $ 34.8 \mu$m [\ion{si}{2}], indicate, for the first time, the presence of apdr in this object class. while the physics and chemistry of the low-excitationgas appears to be dominated by photodissociation, a possible contribution dueto shocks can be inferred from the evidence of gas phase fe abundanceenhancement. the presence of amorphous silicates, inferred from the observedcharacteristic broad feature at $10 \mu$m located in the inner nebula, suggeststhat dust has formed during the lbv outburst. this is in contrast with thedetection of crystalline dust in other probably more evolved galactic lbvs,which is similar to the crystalline dust observed in red supergiants. this hasbeen considered to be evidence of dust production during evolutionary phasesprior to the outburst.

0904.1244	a spectroscopic study of young stellar objects in the serpens cloud core  and ngc 1333	we present spectral observations of 130 young stellar objects (ysos) in theserpens cloud core and ngc 1333 embedded clusters. the observations consist ofnear-ir spectra in the h and k-bands, from spex on the irtf and far-red spectra(6000 - 9000 a) from hectospec on the mmt. these ysos were identified inprevious spitzer and chandra observations, and the evolutionary classes of theysos were determined from the spitzer mid-ir photometry. with these spectra, wesearch for corroborating evidence for the pre-main sequence nature of theobjects, study the properties of the detected emission lines as a function ofevolutionary class, and obtain spectral types for the observed ysos. bycomparing the positions of the ysos in the hr diagrams with the pre-mainsequence tracks of baraffe (1998), we determine ages of the embedded sourcesand study the relative ages of the ysos with and without optically thickcircumstellar disks. the apparent isochronal ages of the ysos in both clustersrange from less than 1 myr to 10 myr, with most objects below 3 myr. theobserved distribution of ages for the class ii and class iii objects arestatistically indistinguishable. we examine the spatial distribution andextinction of the ysos as a function of their isochronal ages. we find thesources &lt; 3 myr to be concentrated in the molecular cloud gas while the oldersources are spatially dispersed and are not deeply embedded. nonetheless, thesources with isochronal ages &gt; 3 myr show all the characteristics of youngstellar objects in their spectra, their ir spectral energy distributions, andtheir x-ray emission.

0904.4479	irs spectroscopy and multi-wavelength study of luminous star-forming  galaxies at z~1.9	we analyze a sample of galaxies chosen to have f24&gt;0.5 mjy and satisfy acertain irac color criterion. irs spectra yield redshifts, spectral types, andpah luminosities, to which we add multi-wavelength broadband photometry.stellar population modeling and irs spectra together demonstrate that thedouble criteria used to select this sample have efficiently isolated massivestar-forming galaxies at z~1.9. this is the first starburst-dominated ulirgsample at high redshift with total infrared luminosity measured directly fromfir and millimeter photometry, and as such gives us the first accurate view ofbroadband seds for starburst galaxies at extremely high luminosity and at allwavelengths. similar broadband data are assembled for three other galaxysamples -- local starburst galaxies, local agn/ulirgs, and a second24mu-luminous z~1.9 sample dominated by agn. l(pah)/l(ir) for the new z~1.9starburst sample is the highest ever seen, some three times higher than inlocal starbursts, whereas in agns this ratio is depressed below the starbursttrend, often severely. several pieces of evidence imply that agns exist in thisstarburst dominated sample, except two of which even host very strong agn,while they still have very strong pah emission. the acs images show mostobjects have very extended morphologies in the rest-frame uv band, thusextended distribution of pah molecules. such an extended distribution preventsfurther destruction pah molecules by central agns. we conclude that objects inthis sample are ulirgs powered mainly by starburst; and the total infraredluminosity density contributed by this type of objects is 0.9-2.6x 10^7lsol/mpc^3.

0906.0201	a spitzer survey of young stellar clusters within one kiloparsec of the  sun: cluster core extraction and basic structural analysis	we present a uniform mid-infrared imaging and photometric survey of 36 young,nearby, star-forming clusters and groups using {\it spitzer} irac and mips. wehave confidently identified and classified 2548 young stellar objects usingrecently established mid-infrared color-based methods. we have devised andapplied a new algorithm for the isolation of local surface density enhancementsfrom point source distributions, enabling us to extract the overdense cores ofthe observed star forming regions for further analysis. we have compiledseveral basic structural measurements of these cluster cores from the data,such as mean surface densities of sources, cluster core radii, and aspectratios, in order to characterize the ranges for these quantities. we find thata typical cluster core is 0.39 pc in radius, has 26 members with infraredexcess in a ratio of class ii to class i sources of 3.7, is embedded in a$a_k$=0.8 mag cloud clump, and has a surface density of 60 pc$^{-2}$. weexamine the nearest neighbor distances among the ysos in several ways,demonstrating similarity in the spacings between class ii and class i sourcesbut large member clusters appear more dense than smaller clusters. wedemonstrate that near-uniform source spacings in cluster cores are common,suggesting that simple jeans fragmentation of parsec-scale cloud clumps may bethe dominant process governing star formation in nearby clusters and groups.finally, we compare our results to other similar surveys in the literature anddiscuss potential biases in the data to guide further interpretation.

0906.0364	spitzer/irac limits to planetary companions of fomalhaut and epsilon  eridani	fomalhaut and epsilon eridani are two young, nearby stars that possessextended debris disks whose structures suggest the presence of perturbingplanetary objects. with its high sensitivity and stable point spread function,spitzer/irac is uniquely capable of detecting cool, jupiter-like planetarycompanions whose peak emission is predicted to occur near 4.5 um. we report ondeep irac imaging of these two stars, taken at 3.6 and 4.5 um using subarraymode and in all four channels in wider-field full array mode. observationsacquired at two different telescope roll angles allowed faint surroundingobjects to be separated from the stellar diffraction pattern. no companioncandidates were detected at the reported position of fomalhaut b with 3 sigmamodel-dependent mass upper limits of 3 mj (for an age of 200 myr). aroundepsilon eridani we instead set a limit of 4 and &lt;1 mj (1 gyr model age) at theinner and outer edge of the sub-millimeter debris ring, respectively. theseresults are consistent with non-detections in recent near-infrared imagingsearches, and set the strongest limits to date on the presence of planetsoutside epsilon eridani sub-millimeter ring.

0909.5367	on the nature of the first galaxies selected at 350 microns	[abridged] we present constraints on the nature of the first galaxiesselected at 350 microns. the sample includes galaxies discovered in the deepestblank-field survey at 350 microns (in the bootes deep field) and also laterserendipitous detections in the lockman hole. spectral energy distributiontemplates are fit to identified counterparts, and the sample is found tocomprise ir-luminous galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 predominantly powered by star formation.the first spectrum of a 350-micron-selected galaxy provides an additionalconfirmation, showing prominent dust grain features typically associated withstar-forming galaxies.  compared to submillimeter galaxies selected at 850 and 1100 microns, galaxiesselected at 350 microns have a similar range of far-infrared colortemperatures. however, no 350-micron-selected sources are reliably detected at850 or 1100 microns. galaxies in our sample with redshifts 1&lt;z&lt;2 show a tightcorrelation between the far- and mid-infrared flux densities, but galaxies athigher redshifts show a large dispersion in their mid- to far-infrared colors.  the 350-micron flux densities (15&lt;s(350)&lt;40 mjy) place these objects near theherschel/spire 350-micron confusion threshold, with the lower limit on the starformation rate density suggesting the bulk of the 350-micron contribution willcome from less luminous infrared sources and normal galaxies.

1107.2570	the star formation reference survey. i. survey description and basic  data	star formation is arguably the most important physical process in the cosmos.it is a fundamental driver of galaxy evolution and the ultimate source of mostof the energy emitted by galaxies. a correct interpretation of star formationrate (sfr) measures is therefore essential to our understanding of galaxyformation and evolution. unfortunately, however, no single sfr estimator isuniversally available or even applicable in all circumstances: the numerousgalaxies found in deep surveys are often too faint (or too distant) to yieldsignificant detections with most standard sfr measures, and until now therehave been no global, multi-band observations of nearby galaxies that span allthe conditions under which star-formation is taking place. to address this needin a systematic way, we have undertaken a multi-band survey of all types ofstar-forming galaxies in the local universe. this project, the star formationreference survey (sfrs), is based on a statistically valid sample of 369 nearbygalaxies that span all existing combinations of dust temperature, sfr, andspecific sfr. furthermore, because the sfrs is blind with respect to agnfraction and environment it serves as a means to assess the influence of thesefactors on sfr. our panchromatic global flux measurements (including galexfuv+nuv, sdss ugriz, 2mass jhks, spitzer 3-8{\mu}m, and others) furnish uniformsfr measures and the context in which their reliability can be assessed. thispaper describes the sfrs survey strategy, defines the sample, and presents themulti-band photometry collected to date.

1201.5617	new measurements of the cosmic infrared background fluctuations in deep  spitzer/irac survey data and their cosmological implications	we extend previous measurements of cosmic infrared background (cib)fluctuations to ~ 1 deg using new data from the spitzer extended deep survey.two fields, with depths of ~12 hr/pixel over 3 epochs, are analyzed at 3.6 and4.5 mic. maps of the fields were assembled using a self-calibration methoduniquely suitable for probing faint diffuse backgrounds. resolved sources wereremoved from the maps to a magnitude limit of ab mag ~ 25, as indicated by thelevel of the remaining shot noise. the maps were then fourier-transformed andtheir power spectra were evaluated. instrumental noise was estimated from thetime-differenced data, and subtracting this isolates the spatial fluctuationsof the actual sky. the power spectra of the source-subtracted fields remainidentical (within the observational uncertainties) for the three epochsindicating that zodiacal light contributes negligibly to the fluctuations.comparing to 8 mic power spectra shows that galactic cirrus cannot account forthe fluctuations. the signal appears isotropically distributed on the sky asrequired for an extragalactic origin. the cib fluctuations continue to divergeto &gt; 10 times those of known galaxy populations on angular scales out to &lt; 1deg. the low shot noise levels remaining in the diffuse maps indicate that thelarge scale fluctuations arise from the spatial clustering of faint sourceswell below the confusion noise. the spatial spectrum of these fluctuations isin reasonable agreement with an origin in populations clustered according tothe standard cosmological model (lcdm) at epochs coinciding with the firststars era.

1207.2727	the ages, masses and star-formation rates of spectroscopically confirmed  z~6 galaxies in candels	we report the results of a study exploring the stellar populations of 13luminous (l&gt;l*), spectroscopically confirmed, galaxies in the redshift interval5.5&lt;z&lt;6.5, all with wfc3/ir and irac imaging from the hst/candels andspitzer/seds surveys. based on fitting the observed photometry with sedtemplates covering a wide range of different star-formation histories, and aself consistent treatment of lyman-alpha emission, we find that the derivedstellar masses lie within the range 10^9 msun &lt; m*&lt; 10^10 msun and are robustto within a factor of two. in contrast, we confirm previous reports that theages of the stellar populations are poorly constrained. although thebest-fitting models for three objects have ages &gt;= 300 myr, the degeneraciesintroduced by dust extinction mean that only two of these objects actuallyrequire a &gt;300 myr old stellar population to reproduce the observed photometry.moreover, when considering only smoothly-varying star-formation histories, weobserve a clear tension between the data and models such that a galaxy sedtemplate with an old age is often chosen in order to try and fit objects withblue uv-slopes but red uv-to-optical colours. to break this tension we exploresed fitting with two-component models (burst plus on-going star-formation) andallow for nebular emission. on average, the inclusion of nebular emission leadsto lower stellar-mass estimates (median offset 0.18 dex), moderately higherspecific star-formation rates, and allows for a wider range of plausiblestellar ages. however, based on our sed modelling, we find no strong evidencefor extremely young ages in our sample (&lt;50 myr). finally, considering all ofthe different star-formation histories explored, we find that the medianbest-fitting ages are of the order 200-300 myr and that the objects with thetightest constraints indicate ages in the range 50-200 myr (abridged).

0704.3609	the local galaxy 8 micron luminosity function	a sst survey in the noao deep-wide field in bo\"otes provides a complete,8-micron-selected sample of galaxies to a limiting (vega) magnitude of 13.5. inthe 6.88 deg$^2$ field sampled, 79% of the 4867 galaxies have spectroscopicredshifts, allowing an accurate determination of the local (z&lt;0.3) galaxyluminosity function. stellar and dust emission can be separated on the basis ofobserved galaxy colors. dust emission (mostly pah) accounts for 80% of the 8micron luminosity, stellar photospheres account for 19%, and agn emissionaccounts for roughly 1 %. a sub-sample of the 8 micron-selected galaxies haveblue, early-type colors, but even most of these have significant pah emission.the luminosity functions for the total 8 micron luminosity and for the dustemission alone are both well fit by schechter functions. for the 8 micronluminosity function, the characteristic luminosity is \nu l_{\nu}^*(8.0\micron) = 1.8 \times 10^{10}$ \lsun while for the dust emission alone it is1.6 x 10^{10}$ \lsun\null. the average 8 \micron luminosity density at z&lt;0.3 is3.1 x 10^7 \lsun mpc^{-3}, and the average luminosity density from dust aloneis 2.5 x 10^7 \lsun mpc^{-3}. this luminos ity arises predominantly fromgalaxies with 8 \micron luminosities ($\nu l_{\nu}$) between $2\times 10^9$ and$2 x 10^{10}$ \lsun, i.e., normal galaxies, not lirgs or ulirgs.

1210.5302	cross-correlating cosmic ir and x-ray background fluctuations: evidence  of significant black hole populations among the cib sources	in order to understand the nature of the sources producing the recentlyuncovered cosmic infrared background (cib) fluctuations, we studycross-correlations between the fluctuations in the source-subtracted cib fromspitzer/irac data and the unresolved cosmic x-ray background from deep chandraobservations. our study uses data from the egs/aegis field, where both datasets cover an 8'x45' region of the sky. our measurement is the cross-powerspectrum between the ir and x-ray data. the cross-power signal between the iracmaps at 3.6 um and 4.5 um and the chandra [0.5-2] kev data has been detected,at angular scales 20'', with an overall significance of 3.8 sigma and 5.6sigma, respectively. at the same time we find no evidence of significantcross-correlations at the harder chandra bands. the cross-correlation signal isproduced by individual ir sources with 3.6 um and 4.5 um magnitudes m_ab 25-26and [0.5-2] kev x-ray fluxes 7e-17 cgs.we determine that at least 15%-25% ofthe large scale power of the cib fluctuations is correlated with the spatialpower spectrum of the x-ray fluctuations. if this correlation is attributed toemission from accretion processes at both ir and x-ray wavelengths, thisimplies a much higher fraction of accreting black holes than among the knownpopulations. we discuss the various possible origins for the cross-power signaland show that neither local foregrounds nor the known remaining normal galaxiesand active galactic nuclei can reproduce the measurements. these observationalresults are an important new constraint on theoretical modeling of the near-ircib fluctuations.

1304.4227	discovery of lyman break galaxies at z~7 from the zfourge survey	star-forming galaxies at redshifts z&gt;6 are likely responsible for thereionization of the universe, and it is important to study the nature of thesegalaxies. we present three candidates for z~7 lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) froma 155 arcmin^2 area in the candels/cosmos field imaged by the deep fourstargalaxy evolution (zfourge) survey. the fourstar medium-band filters provide theequivalent of r~10 spectroscopy, which cleanly distinguishes between z~7 lbgsand brown dwarf stars. the distinction between stars and galaxies based on anobject's angular size can become unreliable even when using hst imaging; thereexists at least one very compact z~7 candidate (fwhm~0.5-1 kpc) that isindistinguishable from a point source. the medium-band filters provide narrowerredshift distributions compared with broad-band-derived redshifts. the uvluminosity function derived using the three z~7 candidates is consistent withprevious studies, suggesting an evolution at the bright end (muv -21.6 mag)from z~7 to z~5. fitting the galaxies' spectral energy distributions, wepredict lyman-alpha equivalent widths for the two brightest lbgs, and find thatthe presence of a lyman-alpha line affects the medium-band flux therebychanging the constraints on stellar masses and uv spectral slopes. thisillustrates the limitations of deriving lbg properties using only broad-bandphotometry. the derived specific star-formation rates for the bright lbgs are~13 per gyr, slightly higher than the lower-luminosity lbgs, implying that thestar-formation rate increases with stellar mass for these galaxies.

1309.2280	the most luminous z~9-10 galaxy candidates yet found: the luminosity  function, cosmic star-formation rate, and the first mass density estimate at  500 myr	[abridged] we present the discovery of four surprisingly bright (h_160 ~ 26 -27 mag ab) galaxy candidates at z~9-10 in the complete hst candels wfc3/irgoods-n imaging data, doubling the number of z~10 galaxy candidates that areknown, just ~500 myr after the big bang. two similarly bright sources are alsodetected in a systematic re-analysis of the goods-s data set. three of the fourgalaxies in goods-n are significantly detected at 4.5-6.2sigma in the very deepspitzer/irac 4.5 micron data, as is one of the goods-s candidates. furthermore,the brightest of our candidates (at z=10.2+-0.4) is robustly detected also at3.6 micron (6.9sigma), revealing a flat uv spectral energy distribution with aslope beta=-2.0+-0.2, consistent with demonstrated trends with luminosity athigh redshift. the abundance of such luminous candidates suggests that theluminosity function evolves more significantly in phi_* than in l_* at z&gt;~8with a higher number density of bright sources than previously expected.despite the discovery of these luminous candidates, the cosmic star formationrate density for galaxies with sfr &gt;0.7 m_sun/yr shows an order-of-magnitudeincrease in only 170 myr from z ~ 10 to z ~ 8, consistent with previousresults. based on the irac detections, we derive galaxy stellar masses at z~10,finding that these luminous objects are typically 10^9 m_sun. the cosmicstellar mass density at z~10 is log10 rho_* = 4.7^+0.5_-0.8 m_sun mpc^-3 forgalaxies brighter than m_uv~-18. the remarkable brightness, and henceluminosity, of these z~9-10 candidates highlights the opportunity for deepspectroscopy to determine their redshift and nature, demonstrates the value ofadditional search fields covering a wider area to understand star-formation inthe very early universe, and highlights the opportunities for jwst to map thebuildup of galaxies at redshifts much earlier than z~10.

1310.6031	a rapidly star-forming galaxy 700 million years after the big bang at  z=7.51	out of several dozen z &gt; 7 candidate galaxies observed spectroscopically,only five have been confirmed via lyman-alpha emission, at z=7.008, 7.045,7.109, 7.213 and 7.215. the small fraction of confirmed galaxies may indicatethat the neutral fraction in the intergalactic medium (igm) rises quickly at z&gt; 6.5, as lyman-alpha is resonantly scattered by neutral gas. however, thesmall samples and limited depth of previous observations makes theseconclusions tentative. here we report the results of a deep near-infraredspectroscopic survey of 43 z &gt; 6.5 galaxies. we detect only a single galaxy,confirming that some process is making lyman-alpha difficult to detect. thedetected emission line at 1.0343 um is likely to be lyman-alpha emission,placing this galaxy at a redshift z = 7.51, an epoch 700 million years afterthe big bang. this galaxy's colors are consistent with significant metalcontent, implying that galaxies become enriched rapidly. we measure asurprisingly high star formation rate of 330 msol/yr, more than a factor of 100greater than seen in the milky way. such a galaxy is unexpected in a survey ofour size, suggesting that the early universe may harbor more intense sites ofstar-formation than expected.

1401.6079	hermes: spectral energy distributions of submillimeter galaxies at z &gt;4	we present a study of the infrared properties for a sample of sevenspectroscopically confirmed submillimeter galaxies at $z&gt;$4.0. by combiningground-based near-infrared, spitzer irac and mips, herschel spire, andground-based submillimeter/millimeter photometry, we construct their spectralenergy distributions (sed) and a composite model to fit the seds. the modelincludes a stellar emission component at $\lambda_{\rm rest} &lt;$ 3.5$ \mu$m; ahot dust component peaking at $\lambda_{rest} \sim$ 5$\,\mu$m; and cold dustcomponent which becomes significant for $\lambda_{\rm rest} &gt;$ 50$\,\mu$m. sixobjects in the sample are detected at 250 and 350$ \mu$m. the dust temperaturesfor the sources in this sample are in the range of 40$-$80 k, and their $l_{\rmfir}$ $\sim$ 10$^{13}$ l$_{\odot}$ qualifies them as hyper$-$luminous infraredgalaxies (hyperlirgs). the mean fir-radio index for this sample is around $&lt; q&gt; = 2.2$ indicating no radio excess in their radio emission. most sources inthe sample have 24$ \mu$m detections corresponding to a rest-frame 4.5$ \mu$mluminosity of log$_{10}$(l$_{4.5}$ / l$_{\odot}$) = 11 $\sim$ 11.5. theirl$_{\rm 4.5}$/$l_{\rm fir}$ ratios are very similar to those of starburstdominated submillimeter galaxies at $z \sim$ 2. the $l_{\rm co}-l_{\rm fir}$relation for this sample is consistent with that determined for local ulirgsand smgs at $z \sim$ 2. we conclude that submillimeter galaxies at $z &gt;$ 4 arehotter and more luminous in the fir, but otherwise very similar to those at $z\sim$ 2. none of these sources show any sign of the strong qso phase beingtriggered.

1403.7699	constraining the physical properties of near-earth object 2009 bd	we report on spitzer space telescope irac observations of near-earth object(neo) 2009 bd that were carried out in support of the nasa asteroid roboticretrieval mission (arrm) concept. we did not detect 2009 bd in 25 hrs ofintegration at 4.5 micron. based on an upper-limit flux density determinationfrom our data, we present a probabilistic derivation of the physical propertiesof this object. the analysis is based on the combination of a thermophysicalmodel with an orbital model accounting for the non-gravitational forces actingupon the body. we find two physically possible solutions. the first solutionshows 2009 bd as a 2.9+/-0.3 m diameter rocky body (rho = 2.9+/-0.5 g cm-3)with an extremely high albedo of 0.85(+0.20/-0.10) that is covered withregolith-like material, causing it to exhibit a low thermal inertia (gamma =30(+20/-10) si units). the second solution suggests 2009 bd to be a 4+/-1 mdiameter asteroid with pv = 0.45(+0.35/-0.15) that consists of a collection ofindividual bare rock slabs (gamma = 2000+/-1000 si units, rho = 1.7(+0.7/-0.4)g cm-3). we are unable to rule out either solution based on physical reasoning.2009 bd is the smallest asteroid for which physical properties have beenconstrained, in this case using an indirect method and based on a detectionlimit, providing unique information on the physical properties of objects inthe size range smaller than 10 m.

0803.1019	the disk population of the chamaeleon i star-forming region	we present a census of circumstellar disks in the chamaeleon i star-formingregion. using the infrared array camera and the multiband imaging photometeronboard the spitzer space telescope, we have obtained images of chamaeleon i at3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, and 24 um. to search for new disk-bearing members of thecluster, we have performed spectroscopy on objects that have red colors inthese data. through this work, we have discovered four new members ofchamaeleon i with spectral types of m4, m6, m7.5, and l0. the first threeobjects are highly embedded (a_j~5) and reside near known protostars,indicating that they may be among the youngest low-mass sources in the cluster(&lt;1 myr). the l0 source is the coolest known member of chamaeleon i. itsluminosity implies a mass of 0.004-0.01 m_sun, making it the least massivebrown dwarf for which a circumstellar disk has been reliably detected. tocharacterize the disk population in chamaeleon i, we have classified theinfrared spectral energy distributions of the 203 known members that areencompassed by the spitzer images. through these classifications, we find thatthe disk fraction in chamaeleon i is roughly constant at ~50% from 0.01 to 0.3m_sun. these data are similar to the disk fraction of ic 348, which is a densercluster at the same age as chamaeleon i. however, the disk fraction at m&gt;1m_sun is significantly higher in chamaeleon i than in ic 348 (65% vs. 20%),indicating longer disk lifetimes in chamaeleon i for this mass range. thus,low-density star-forming regions like chamaeleon i may offer more time forplanet formation around solar-type stars than denser clusters.

1412.0532	the galaxy stellar mass function at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 in the candels/uds,  goods-south, and hudf fields	the galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) at high-z provides key information onstar-formation history and mass assembly in the young universe. we aimed to usethe unique combination of deep optical/nir/mir imaging provided by hst, spitzerand the vlt in the candels-uds, goods-south, and hudf fields to determine thegsmf over the redshift range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5. we utilised the hst wfc3/ir nir imagingfrom candels and hudf09, reaching h~27-28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin2,in combination with associated deep hst acs optical data, deep spitzer iracimaging from the seds programme, and deep y and k-band vlt hawk-i images fromthe hugs programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometricredshifts. these have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopicredshifts in the range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, resulting in an overall precision ofsigma_z/(1+z)~0.037. we have determined the low-mass end of the high-z gsmfwith unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as m*~10^9 msun atz=4 and ~6x10^9 msun at z=7. we find that the gsmf at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 depends onlyslightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely thephoto-z, the sfhs, the nebular contribution or the presence of agn on theparent sample. the low-mass end of the gsmf is steeper than has been found atlower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probedhere. our results are very different from previous gsmf estimates based onconverting uv galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight m/lrelations. integrating our evolving gsmf over mass, we find that the growth ofstellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the sfrdensity over cosmic time at z&gt;4. these results confirm the unique synergy ofthe candels+hudf, hugs, and seds surveys for the discovery and study ofmoderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.

1506.01323	s-candels: the spitzer-cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic  survey. survey design, photometry, and deep irac source counts	the spitzer-cosmic assembly deep near-infrared extragalactic legacy survey(s-candels; pi g. fazio) is a cycle 8 exploration program designed to detectgalaxies at very high redshifts (z &gt; 5). to mitigate the effects of cosmicvariance and also to take advantage of deep coextensive coverage in multiplebands by the hubble space telescope multi-cycle treasury program candels,s-candels was carried out within five widely separated extragalactic fields:the ukidss ultra-deep survey, the extended chandra deep field south, cosmos,the hst deep field north, and the extended groth strip. s-candels builds uponthe existing coverage of these fields from the spitzer extended deep survey(seds) by increasing the integration time from 12 hours to a total of 50 hoursbut within a smaller area, 0.16 square degrees. the additional depthsignificantly increases the survey completeness at faint magnitudes. this paperdescribes the s-candels survey design, processing, and publicly-available dataproducts. we present irac dual-band 3.6+4.5 micron catalogs reaching to a depthof 26.5 ab mag. deep irac counts for the roughly 135,000 galaxies detected bys-candels are consistent with models based on known galaxy populations. theincrease in depth beyond earlier spitzer/irac surveys does not reveal asignificant additional contribution from discrete sources to the diffuse cosmicinfrared background (cib). thus it remains true that only roughly half of theestimated cib flux from cobe/dirbe is resolved.

astro-ph;0104437	subarcsecond mid-ir structure of the dust shell around iras 22272+5435	we report sub-arcsecond imaging of extended mid-infrared emission from aproto-planetary nebula (ppn), \iras 22272+5435, performed at the mmtobservatory with its newly upgraded 6.5 m aperture telescope and at the keckobservatory. the mid-infrared emission structure is resolved into two emissionpeaks separated by $0\arcsec.5 - 0\arcsec.6$ in the mmt 11.7 $\um$ image and inthe keck 7.9, 9.7, and 12.5 $\um$ images, corroborating the predictions basedon previous multi-wavelength morphological studies and radiative transfercalculations. the resolved images show that the ppn dust shell has a toroidalstructure with the $0\arcsec.5$ inner radius. in addition, an unresolved mid-irexcess appears at the nebula center. radiative transfer model calculationssuggest that the highly equatorially-enhanced ($\rho_{\rm eq}/\rho_{\rm pole} =9$) structure of the ppn shell was generated by an axisymmetric superwind with${\dot m}_{\rm sw} = 4 \times 10^{-6} m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which was precededby a spherical asymptotic giant branch (agb) wind with ${\dot m}_{\rm agb} = 8\times 10^{-7} m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. these model calculations also indicatethat the superwind shell contains larger dust grains than the agb wind shell.the unresolved mid-infrared excess may have been produced by a post-agb massloss at a rate of $2 - 6 \times 10^{-7} m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. while the centralstar left the agb about 380 years ago after the termination of the superwind,the star seems to have been experiencing an ambient post-agb mass loss with asudden, increased mass ejection about 10 years ago.

astro-ph;0406276	the off-nuclear starbursts in ngc 4038/4039 (the antennae galaxies)	imaging of the antennae galaxies (ngc 4038/4039) with the infrared arraycamera (irac) aboard the spitzer space telescope reveals large concentrationsof star forming activity away from both nuclei of the two merging galaxies.these images confirm earlier findings based on iso data with lower angularresolution. the short wavelength emission shows numerous compact sourcesidentified as stellar clusters. at the longer wavelengths, bright, moreamorphous and filamentary features correlate well with the known distributionsof denser gas, warm dust, and hii regions. there are also fainter, more diffusecomponents at all wavelengths that permeate the entire region and extend intothe two tidal tails. non-stellar dust emission dominates the 5.8 and 8.0 micronimages, accounting for as much as 79% of the light at 5.8 micron and 95% at 8micron, averaged over the entire galaxy. assuming that the non-stellar emissiontraces star formation, the irac data provide a view into the total underlyingstar forming activities unaffected by obscuration. using the flux ratio ofnon-stellar to stellar emission as a guide, we map the local star formationrate in the antennae and compare that to similar measurements in both normaland infrared-luminous galaxies. this rate in the active regions is found to beas high as those seen in starburst and some ultra-luminous infrared galaxies on``per unit mass'' basis. the two galactic centers actually have lower starforming rates than the off-nuclear regions despite the presence of abundantdense gas and dust, suggesting that the latter is a necessary but notsufficient condition for on-going star formation.

astro-ph;0408248	the anatomy of star formation in ngc 300	the spitzer space telescope was used to study the mid-infrared tofar-infrared properties of ngc 300, and to compare dust emission to halpha toelucidate the heating of the ism and the star formation cycle at scales &lt; 100pc. the new data allow us to discern clear differences in the spatialdistribution of 8 micron dust emission with respect to 24 micron dust and tohii regions traced by the halpha light. the 8 micron emission highlights therims of hii regions, and the 24 micron emission is more strongly peaked in starforming regions than at 8 microns. we confirm the existence and approximateamplitude of interstellar dust emission at 4.5 microns, detected statisticallyin infrared space observatory (iso) data, and conclude it arises in starforming regions. when averaging over regions larger than ~ 1 kpc, the ratio ofhalpha to aromatic feature emission in ngc 300 is consistent with the valuesobserved in disks of spiral galaxies. the mid-to-far-infrared spectral energydistribution of dust emission is generally consistent with pre-spitzer models.

0809.1349	aegis-x: the chandra deep survey of the extended groth strip	we present the aegis-x survey, a series of deep chandra acis-i observationsof the extended groth strip. the survey comprises pointings at 8 separatepositions, each with nominal exposure 200ks, covering a total area ofapproximately 0.67 deg2 in a strip of length 2 degrees. we describe in detailan updated version of our data reduction and point source detection algorithmsused to analyze these data. a total of 1325 band-merged sources have been foundto a poisson probability limit of 4e-6, with limiting fluxes of 5.3e-17erg/cm2/s in the soft (0.5-2 kev) band and 3.8e-16 erg/cm2/s in the hard (2-10kev) band. we present simulations verifying the validity of our sourcedetection procedure and showing a very small, &lt;1.5%, contamination rate fromspurious sources. optical/nir counterparts have been identified from the deep2,cfhtls, and spitzer/irac surveys of the same region. using a likelihood ratiomethod, we find optical counterparts for 76% of our sources, complete tor(ab)=24.1, and, of the 66% of the sources that have irac coverage, 94% have acounterpart to a limit of 0.9 microjy at 3.6 microns (m(ab)=23.8). afteraccounting for (small) positional offsets in the 8 chandra fields, theastrometric accuracy of the chandra positions is found to be 0.8 arcsec rms,however this number depends both on the off-axis angle and the number ofdetected counts for a given source. all the data products described in thispaper are made available via a public website.

astro-ph;0605355	spitzer observations of z~3 lyman break galaxies: stellar masses and  mid-infrared properties	we describe the spectral energy distributions (seds) of lyman break galaxies(lbgs) at z~3 using deep mid-infrared and optical observations of the extendedgroth strip, obtained with irac and mips on board spitzer and from the ground,respectively. we focus on lbgs with detections at all four irac bands, inparticular the 26 galaxies with irac 8 micron band (rest--frame k-band)detections. we use stellar population synthesis models and probe the stellarcontent of these galaxies. based on best--fit continuous star-formation modelswe derive estimates of the stellar mass for these lbgs. as in previous studies,we find that a fraction of lbgs have very red colors and large estimatedstellar masses (m_stellar &gt; 5 x 10 ^{10} m_solar): the present spitzer dataallow us, for the first time, to study these massive lbgs in detail. we discussthe link between these lbgs and submm-luminous galaxies.we find that the numberdensity of these massive lbgs at high redshift is higher than predicted bycurrent semi-analytic models of galaxy evolution.

astro-ph;0609464	discovery of two t dwarf companions with the spitzer space telescope	we report the discovery of t dwarf companions to the nearby stars hn peg(g0v, 18.4 pc, ~0.3 gyr) and hd 3651 (k0v, 11.1 pc, ~7 gyr). during an ongoingsurvey of 5'x5' fields surrounding stars in the solar neighborhood with iracaboard the spitzer space telescope, we identified these companions as candidatet dwarfs based on their mid-ir colors. using near-ir spectra obtained with spexat the nasa irtf, we confirm the presence of methane absorption thatcharacterizes t dwarfs and measure spectral types of t2.5+/-0.5 and t7.5+/-0.5for hn peg b and hd 3651 b, respectively. by comparing our spitzer data toimages from 2mass obtained several years earlier, we find that the propermotions of hn peg b and hd 3651 b are consistent with those of the primaries,confirming their companionship. hn peg b and hd 3651 b have angular separationsof 43.2" and 42.9" from their primaries, which correspond to projected physicalseparations of 795 and 476 au, respectively. a comparison of their luminositiesto the values predicted by theoretical evolutionary models implies masses of0.021+/-0.009 and 0.051+/-0.014 msun for hn peg b and hd 3651 b. in addition,the models imply an effective temperature for hn peg b that is significantlylower than the values derived for other t dwarfs at similar spectral types,which is the same behavior reported by metchev &amp; hillenbrand for the younglate-l dwarf hd 203030 b. thus, the temperature of the l/t transition appearsto depend on surface gravity. meanwhile, hd 3651 b is the first substellarcompanion directly imaged around a star that is known to harbor a close-inplanet from rv surveys. the discovery of this companion supports the notionthat the high eccentricities of close-in planets like the one near hd 3651 maybe the result of perturbations by low-mass companions at wide separations.

astro-ph;0610543	an almost head-on collision as the origin of two off-centre rings in the  andromeda galaxy	the unusual morphology of the andromeda spiral (messier 31, the closestspiral galaxy to the milky way) has long been an enigma. although regarded fordecades as showing little evidence of a violent history, m~31 has a well-knownouter ring of star formation at a radius of 10 kpc whose center is offset fromthe galaxy nucleus. in addition, the outer galaxy disk is warped as seen atboth optical and radio wavelengths. the halo contains numerous loops andripples. here we report the discovery, based on analysis of previously-obtaineddata, of a second, inner dust ring with projected dimensions 1.5 by 1 kpc andoffset by ~0.5kpc from the center of the galaxy. the two rings appear to bedensity waves propagating in the disk. numerical simulations offer a completelynew interpretation for the morphology of m31: both rings result from acompanion galaxy plunging head-on through the center of the disk of m31. themost likely interloper is m32. head-on collisions between galaxies are rare,but it appears nonetheless that one took place 210 million years ago in ourlocal group of galaxies.

astro-ph;0610575	the building of galactic disks: insights from the triangulum spiral  galaxy messier 33	the triangulum spiral galaxy messier 33 offers unique insights into thebuilding of a galactic disk. we identify spectacular arcs of intermediate age(0.6 gyr - 2 gyr) stars in the low-metallicity outer disk. the northern arcspans approx. 120 degrees in azimuth and up to 5 arcmin in width. the arcs arelocated 2-3 disk scale lengths from the galaxy centre (where 1 disk scalelength is equivalent to 0.1 degrees in the v-band) and lie precisely wherethere is a warp in the hi profile of m33. warps and infall are inextricablylinked (binney, 1992). we present spectroscopy of candidate stars in the outernorthern arc, secured using the keck i telescope in hawaii. the target starshave estimated visual magnitudes as faint as v ~ 25m. absorption bands of cnare seen in all spectra reported in this review talk, confirming their carbonstar status. also presented are pah emissivity radial profiles generated fromirac observations of m33 using the spitzer space telescope. a dramatic changeof phase in the m=2 fourier component is detected at the domain of the arcs.m33 serves as an excellent example how the disks of spiral galaxies in ouruniverse are built: as dynamically open systems, growing from the inward,outward.

astro-ph;0611346	spitzer/irac characterization of galactic agb stars	the spitzer space telescope and in particular its infrared array camera(irac) is an ideal facility to study the distribution of agb stars in our ownand other galaxies because of its efficiency in surveying vast areas of the skyand its ability to detect sources with infrared excess. the irac colors of agbstars, however, are not well known because cool stars have numerous molecularabsorption features in the spectral region covered by the irac photometricsystem. the presence and strength of these features depends on the chemistry ofthe stellar atmosphere and the mass loss rate and can change with time due tothe star's variability. to characterize the irac colors of agb stars, we arecarrying out a spitzer guaranteed time observation program to observe a sampleof agb stars with irac. the results will be made available to the community inthe form of template magnitudes and colors for each target with the goal ofaiding the identification of agb stars in already available and future iracsurveys. we present here the first results of this project.

astro-ph;0611735	aegis: infrared spectral energy distributions of mips 70micron selected  sources	we present 0.5 -160 micron spectral energy distributions (seds) of galaxies,detected at 70microns with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer (mips),using broadband imaging data from spitzer and ground-based telescopes.spectroscopic redshifts, in the range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.5, have been measured as part ofthe deep extragalactic evolutionary probe2 (deep2) project. based on the sedswe explore the nature and physical properties of the sources. using the opticalspectra we derive hbeta and [oii]-based star formation rates (sfr) which are10-100 times lower than sfr estimates based on ir and radio. the median offsetin sfr between optical and ir is reduced by a factor of ~3 when we apply atypical extinction corrections. we investigate mid-to-far infrared correlationsfor low redshift (&gt;0.5) and high redshift (0.5&lt;z&lt;1.2) bins. using this unique``far-infrared'' selected sample we derive an empirical mid to far-infraredrelationship that can be used to estimate the infrared energy budget ofgalaxies in the high-redshift universe. our sample can be used as a template totranslate far-infrared luminosities into bolometric luminosities for highredshift objects.

astro-ph;0701924	star formation in aegis field galaxies since z=1.1 : the dominance of  gradually declining star formation, and the main sequence of star-forming  galaxies	we analyze star formation (sf) as a function of stellar mass (m*) andredshift z in the all wavelength extended groth strip international survey(aegis). for 2905 field galaxies, complete to 10^10(10^10.8) msun at z&lt;0.7(1),with keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile sf rates (sfr) fromemission lines, galex, and spitzer mips 24 micron photometry, optical-nir m*measurements, and hst morphologies. galaxies with reliable signs of sf form adistinct "main sequence (ms)", with a limited range of sfr at a given m* and z(1 sigma &lt; +-0.3 dex), and log(sfr) approximately proportional to log(m*). therange of log(sfr) remains constant to z&gt;1, while the ms as a whole moves tohigher sfr as z increases. the range of sfr along the ms constrains theamplitude of episodic variations of sf, and the effect of mergers on sfr.typical galaxies spend ~67(95)% of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of&lt;~ 2(4) of their average sfr at a given m* and z. the dominant mode of theevolution of sf since z~1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average sfr inmost individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, ora decreasing factor by which sfr are enhanced in starbursts. lirgs at z~1 seemto mostly reflect the high sfr typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. thesmooth ms may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs starformation prior to additional quenching processes. a gradual process like gasexhaustion may play a dominant role.

astro-ph;0702435	new low-mass stars and brown dwarfs with disks in lupus	using the infrared array camera and the multiband imaging photometer aboardthe {\it spitzer space telescope}, we have obtained images of the lupus 3star-forming cloud at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, and 24 \micron. we present photometryin these bands for the 41 previously known members that are within our images.in addition, we have identified 19 possible new members of the cloud based onred 3.6-8.0 \micron colors that are indicative of circumstellar disks. we haveperformed optical spectroscopy on 6 of these candidates, all of which areconfirmed as young low-mass members of lupus 3. the spectral types of these newmembers range from m4.75 to m8, corresponding to masses of 0.2-0.03 $m_\odot$for ages of $\sim1$ myr according to theoretical evolutionary models. we alsopresent optical spectroscopy of a candidate disk-bearing object in the vicinityof the lupus 1 cloud, 2m 1541-3345, which jayawardhana &amp; ivanov recentlyclassified as a young brown dwarf ($m\sim0.03$ $m_\odot$) with a spectral typeof m8. in contrast to their results, we measure an earlier spectral type ofm5.75$\pm$0.25 for this object, indicating that it is probably a low-mass star($m\sim0.1$ $m_\odot$). in fact, according to its gravity-sensitive absorptionlines and its luminosity, 2m 1541-3345 is older than members of the lupusclouds ($\tau\sim1$ myr) and instead is probably a more evolvedpre-main-sequence star that is not directly related to the current generationof star formation in lupus.

astro-ph;0703777	infrared extinction toward nearby star-forming regions	we present an independent estimate of the interstellar extinction law for thespitzer irac bands as well as a first attempt at extending the law to the24micron mips band. the source data for these measurements are observations offive nearby star-forming regions: the orion a cloud, ngc 2068/71, ngc 2024/23,serpens and ophiuchus. color excess ratios e(h-ks)/e(ks-[lambda]) were measuredfor stars without infrared excess dust emission from circumstellardisks/envelopes.  for four of these five regions, the extinction laws are similar at allwavelengths and differ systematically from a previous determination of theextinction law, which was dominated by the diffuse ism, derived for the iracbands. this difference could be due to the difference in the dust properties ofthe dense molecular clouds observed here and those of the diffuse ism. theextinction law at longer wavelengths toward the ophiuchus region lies betweenthat to the other four regions studied here and that for the ism. in addition,we extended our extinction law determination to 24micron for serpens and ngc2068/71 using spitzer mips data. we compare these results against several isoextinction law determinations, although in each case there are assumptionswhich make absolute comparison uncertain. however, our work confirms arelatively flatter extinction curve from 4 - 8micron than the previouslyassumed standard, as noted by all of these recent studies. the extinction lawat 24micron is consistent with previous measurements and models, although thereare relatively large uncertainties.

astro-ph;9607107	an sspm-based high-speed near-infrared photometer for astronomy	we describe the design, operation, and performance of a new high-speedinfrared photometer using the solid-state photomultiplier (sspm) detector. thesspm was developed by rockwell international science center and hassingle-photon counting capability over the 0.4-28 micron wavelength range,intrinsic time response of order 1 ns, and low detector noise (petroff, 1987).we have operated a 200x200-micron back-illuminated sspm in a liquid-heliumcooled dewar with a room-temperature transimpedance amplifier output. singlephoton pulses can be easily distinguished above the amplifier noise. theindividual photon pulses are binned at a selectable time resolution rangingfrom $5 \mu$s to 64 ms, and then written to exabyte tape. in the firstastronomical application of such a device, we have made observations of thecrab nebula pulsar and her x-1 at near-infrared wavelengths (j-, h-, andk-bands), and we present the instrument sensitivities established by theseobservations. we discuss other astronomical observations which are eitherplanned or currently underway. finally, we present design specifications andpredicted performances for a second-generation sspm high-speed infraredphotometer.

0810.1902	a spitzer search for cold dust within globular clusters	globular cluster stars evolving off the main sequence are known to lose mass,and it is expected that some of the lost material should remain within thecluster as an intracluster medium (icm). most attempts to detect such an icmhave been unsuccessful. the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer on thespitzer space telescope was used to observe eight galactic globular clusters inan attempt to detect the thermal emission from icm dust. most clusters do nothave significant detections at 70 microns; one cluster, ngc 6341, has tentativeevidence for the presence of dust, but 90 micron observations do not confirmthe detection. individual 70 micron point sources which appear in several ofthe cluster images are likely to be background galaxies. the inferred dust massand upper limits are &lt; 4e-4 solar masses, well below expectations for clusterdust production from mass loss in red and asymptotic giant branch stars. thisimplies that either globular cluster dust production is less efficient, or thaticm removal or dust destruction is more efficient, than previously believed. weexplore several possibilities for icm removal and conclude that present data donot yet permit us to distinguish between them.

0812.2476	a millimetre survey of starburst dominated ultraluminous infrared  galaxies at z~2	we present millimetre observations of a sample of 12 high redshiftultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) in the extended growth strip (egs).these objects were initially selected on the basis of their observed mid--ircolours (0.0 &lt; [3.6]-[4.5] &lt; 0.4 and -0.7 &lt; [3.6]-[8.0] &lt; 0.5) to lie at highredshift 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3, and subsequent 20-38 micron mid-ir spectroscopy confirmsthat they lie in a narrow redshift window centered on z=2. we detect 9/12 ofthe objects in our sample at high significance (&gt;3 sigma) with a mean1200\micron flux of &lt;f_1200&gt; = 1.6+/-0.1 mjy. our millimetre photometry,combined with existing far-ir photometry from the far-ir deep extragalacticlegacy (fidel) survey and accurate spectroscopic redshifts, places constraintsboth sides of the thermal dust peak. this allows us to estimate the dustproperties, including the far--ir luminosity, dust temperature, and dust mass.we find that our sample is similar to other high-z and intermediate-z ulirgs,and local systems, but has a different dust selection function thansubmillimeter-selected galaxies. finally, we use existing 20cm radio continuumimaging to test the far-ir/radio correlation at high redshift. we find that oursample is consistent with the local relation, implying little evolution.furthermore, this suggests that our sample selection method is efficient atidentifying ultraluminous, starburst--dominated systems within a very narrowredshift range centered at z~2.
