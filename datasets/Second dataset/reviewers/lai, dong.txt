0812.3995	interface modes and their instabilities in accretion disc boundary  layers	we study global non-axisymmetric oscillation modes trapped near the innerboundary of an accretion disc. observations indicate that some of thequasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) observed in the luminosities of accretingcompact objects (neutron stars, black holes and white dwarfs) are produced inthe inner-most regions of accretion discs or boundary layers. two simple modelsare considered in this paper: the magnetosphere-disc model consists of a thinkeplerian disc in contact with a uniformly rotating magnetosphere with and lowplasma density, while the star-disc model involves a keplerian disc terminatedat the stellar atomosphere with high density and small density scale height. wefind that the interface modes at the magnetosphere-disc boundary are generallyunstable due to rayleigh-taylor and/or kelvin-helmholtz instabilities. however,differential rotation of the disc tends to suppress rayleigh-taylor instabilityand a sufficiently high disc sound speed (or temperature) is needed to overcomethis suppression and to attain net mode growth. on the other hand,kelvin-helmholtz instability may be active at low disc sound speeds. we alsofind that the interface modes trapped at the boundary between a thin disc andan unmagnetized star do not suffer rayleigh-taylor or kelvin-helmholtzinstability, but can become unstable due to wave leakage to large disc radiiand, for sufficiently steep disc density distributions, due to wave absorptionat the corotation resonance in the disc. the non-axisymmetric interface modesstudied in this paper may be relevant to the high-frequency qpos observed insome x-ray binaries and in cataclysmic variables.

0903.2094	polarization evolution in a strongly magnetized vacuum: qed effect and  polarized x-ray emission from magnetized neutron stars	x-ray photons emitted from the surface or atmosphere of a magnetized neutronstar is highly polarized. however, the observed polarization may be modifieddue to photon propagation through the star's magnetosphere. for photonfrequencies much larger than the typical radio frequency, vacuum birefringencedue to strong-field quantum electrodynamics dominates over the plasma effect.we study the evolution of photon polarization in the magnetized qed vacuum of aneutron star magnetosphere, paying particular attention to the propagationeffect across the quasi-tangential (qt) point, where the photon momentum isnearly aligned with the magnetic field. in agreement with previous studies, wefind that in most regions of the magnetosphere, the photon polarization modesare decoupled due to vacuum birefringence, and therefore a large net linearpolarization can be expected when the radiation escapes the magnetosphere.however, we show that x-ray polarization may change significantly when thephoton passes through the qt region. when averaging over a finite emissionarea, the net effect of qt propagation is to reduce the degree of linearpolarization; the reduction factor depends on the photon energy, magnetic fieldstrength, geometry, rotation phase and the emission area, and can be more thana factor of two. we derive the general conditions under which the qtpropagation effect is important, and provide an easy-to-use prescription toaccount for the qt effect for most practical calculations of x-ray polarizationsignals from magnetic neutron stars. for a neutron star with a dipole magneticfield, the qt effect can be important for emission from the polar cap forcertain magnetic field and energy ranges, and is negligible for emission fromthe entire stellar surface.

0906.4392	corotational instability of inertial-acoustic modes in black-hole  accretion discs: non-barotropic flows	we study the effect of corotation resonance on the inertial-acousticoscillations (p-modes) of black-hole accretion discs. previous works have shownthat for barotropic flows (where the pressure depends only on the density),wave absorption at the corotation resonance can lead to mode growth when thedisc vortensity, $\zeta=\kappa^2/(2\omega\sigma)$ (where $\omega, \kappa,\sigma$ are the rotation rate, radial epicyclic frequency and surface densityof the disc, respectively), has a positive gradient at the corotation radius.here we generalize the analysis of the corotation resonance effect tonon-barotropic fluids. we show that the mode instability criterion is modifiedby the finite radial brunt-v\"as\"al\"a frequency of the disc. we derive ananalytic expression for the reflectivity when a density wave impinges upon thecorotation barrier, and calculate the frequencies and growth rates of globalp-modes for disc models with various $\alpha$-viscosity parameterizations. wefind that for disc fluids with constant adiabatic index $\gamma$,super-reflection and mode growth depend on the gradient of the effectivevortensity, $\zeta_{\rm eff} = \zeta/s^{2/\gamma}$ (where $s \equivp/\sigma^{\gamma}$ measures the entropy): when $d\zeta_{\rm eff}/dr &gt; 0$ at thecorotation radius, wave absorption leads to amplification of the p-mode. ourcalculations show that the lowest-order p-modes with azimuthal wave number$m=2, 3, 4,...$ have the largest growth rates, with the frequenciesapproximately in (but distinct from) the $2:3:4...$ commensurate ratios. wediscuss the implications of our results for the high-frequency quasi-periodicoscillations observed in accreting black-hole systems.

0910.2793	polarization changes of pulsars due to wave propagation through  magnetospheres	we study the propagation effects of radio waves in a pulsar magnetosphere,composed of relativistic electron-positron pair plasmas streaming along themagnetic field lines and corotating with the pulsar. we critically examine thevarious physical effects that can potentially influence the observed waveintensity and polarization, including resonant cyclotron absorption, wave modecoupling due to pulsar rotation, wave propagation through quasi-tangentialregions (where the photon ray is nearly parallel to the magnetic field) andmode circularization due to the difference in the electron/positrondensity/velocity distributions. we numerically integrate the transfer equationsfor wave polarization in the rotating magnetosphere, taking account of all thepropagation effects in a self-consistent manner. for typical magnetosphericplasma parameters produced by pair cascade, we find that the observed radiointensity and polarization profiles can be strongly modified by the propagationeffects. for relatively large impact parameter (the minimum angle between themagnetic dipole axis and the line of sight), the polarization angle profile issimilar to the prediction from the rotating vector model, except for a phaseshift and an appreciable circular polarization. for smaller impact parameter,the linear polarization position angle may exhibit a sudden $90^o$ jump due tothe quasi-tangential propagation effect, accompanied by complex circularpolarization profile. some applications of our results are discussed, includingthe origin of non-gaussion pulse profiles, the relationship between theposition angle profile and circular polarization in conal-double pulsars, andthe orthogonal polarization modes.

1001.2365	pair cascades in the magnetospheres of strongly-magnetized neutron stars	we present numerical simulations of electron-positron pair cascades in themagnetospheres of magnetic neutron stars for a wide range of surface fields(b_p = 10^{12}--10^{15} g), rotation periods (0.1--10 s), and field geometries.this has been motivated by the discovery in recent years of a number of radiopulsars with inferred magnetic fields comparable to those of magnetars.evolving the cascade generated by a primary electron or positron after it hasbeen accelerated in the inner gap of the magnetosphere, we follow the spatialdevelopment of the cascade until the secondary photons and pairs leave themagnetosphere, and we obtain the pair multiplicity and the energy spectra ofthe cascade pairs and photons under various conditions. going beyond previousworks, which were restricted to weaker fields (b &lt; a few x 10^{12} g), we haveincorporated in our simulations detailed treatments of physical processes thatare potentially important (especially in the high field regime) but were eitherneglected or crudely treated before, including photon splitting with thecorrect selection rules for photon polarization modes, one-photon pairproduction into low landau levels for the e^+e^-, and resonant inverse comptonscattering from polar cap hot spots. we discuss the implications of our resultsfor the radio pulsar death line and for the hard x-ray emission from magnetizedneutron stars.

1005.4497	mass transfer, transiting stream and magnetopause in close-in  exoplanetary systems with applications to wasp-12	we study mass transfer by roche lobe overflow in close-in exoplanetarysystems. the planet's atmospheric gas passes through the inner lagrangian pointand flows along a narrow stream, accelerating to 100-$200\kms$ velocity beforeforming an accretion disk. we show that the cylinder-shaped accretion streamcan have an area (projected in the plane of the sky) comparable to that of theplanet and a significant optical depth to spectral line absorption. such a"transiting cylinder" may produce an earlier ingress of the planet transit, assuggested by recent hst observations of the wasp-12 system. the asymmetric diskproduced by the accretion stream may also lead to time-dependent obscuration ofthe star light and apparent earlier ingress. we also consider the interactionof the stellar wind with the planetary magnetosphere. since the wind speed issubsonic/sub-alfvenic and comparable to the orbital velocity of the planet, thehead of the magnetopause lies eastward relative to the substellar line (theline joining the planet and the star). the gas around the magnetopause may, ifsufficiently compressed, give rise to asymmetric ingress/egress during theplanet transit, although more works are needed to evaluate this possibility.

1006.3763	corotational instability, magnetic resonances and global  inertial-acoustic oscillations in magnetized black-hole accretion discs	low-order, non-axisymmetric p-modes (also referred as inertial-acousticmodes) trapped in the inner-most region of hydrodynamic accretion discs aroundblack holes, are plausible candidates for high-frequency quasi-periodicoscillations (qpos) observed in a number of accreting black-hole systems. thesemodes are subject to global instabilities due to wave absorption at thecorotation resonance (where the wave pattern frequency $\omega/m$ equals thedisc rotation rate $\omega$), when the fluid vortensity,$\zeta=\kappa^2/(2\omega\sigma)$ (where $\kappa$ and $\sigma$ are the radialepicyclic frequency and disc surface density, respectively), has a positivegradient. we investigate the effects of disc magnetic fields on the waveabsorption at corotation and the related wave super-reflection of thecorotation barrier, and on the overstability of disc p-modes. for discs with apure toroidal field, the corotation resonance is split into two magneticresonances, where the wave frequency in the corotating frame of the fluid,$\tomega=\omega-m\omega$, matches the slow magnetosonic wave frequency.significant wave energy/angular momentum absorption occurs at both magneticresonances, but with opposite signs. the combined effect of the two magneticresonances is to reduce the super-reflection and the growth rate of theoverstable p-modes. we show that even a subthermal toroidal field may suppressthe overstability of hydrodynamic (b=0) p-modes. for accretion discs with mixed(toroidal and vertical) magnetic fields, two additional alfven resonancesappear, where $\tomega$ matches the local alfven wave frequency. they furtherreduce the growth rate of p-modes. our results suggest that in order for thenon-axisymmetric p-modes to be a viable candidate for the observedhigh-frequency qpos, the disc magnetic field must be appreciably subthermal, orother mode excitation mechanisms are at work.

1006.3824	papaloizou-pringle instability of magnetized accretion tori	hot accretion tori around a compact object are known to be susceptible to aglobal hydrodynamical instability, the so-called papaloizou-pringle (pp)instability, arising from the interaction of non-axisymmetric waves across thecorotation radius, where the wave pattern speed matches the fluid rotationrate. however, accretion tori produced in various astrophysical situations(e.g., collapsars and neutron star binary mergers) are likely to be highlymagnetized. we study the effect of magnetic fields on the pp instability inincompressible tori with various magnetic strengths and structures. in general,toroidal magnetic fields have significant effects on the pp instability: forthin tori (with the fractional width relative to the outer torus radius muchless than unity), the instability is suppressed at large field strengths withthe corresponding toroidal alfven speed $v_{a\phi}\go 0.2r\omega$ (where$\omega$ is the flow rotation rate). for thicker tori (with the fractionalwidth of order 0.4 or larger), which are hydrodynamically stable, theinstability sets in for sufficiently strong magnetic fields (with $v_{a\phi}\go0.2 r\omega$). our results suggest that highly magnetized accretion tori may besubjected to global instability even when it is stable against the usualmagneto-rotational instability.

1008.3148	evolution of spin direction of accreting magnetic protostars and  spin-orbit misalignment in exoplanetary systems	recent observations have shown that in many exoplanetary systems the spinaxis of the parent star is misaligned with the planet's orbital axis. thesehave been used to argue against the scenario that short-period planets migratedto their present-day locations due to tidal interactions with their nataldiscs. however, this interpretation is based on the assumption that the spinsof young stars are parallel to the rotation axes of protostellar discs aroundthem. we show that the interaction between a magnetic star and itscircumstellar disc can (but not always) have the effect of pushing the stellarspin axis away from the disc angular momentum axis toward the perpendicularstate and even the retrograde state. planets formed in the disc may thereforehave their orbital axes misaligned with the stellar spin axis, even before anyadditional planet-planet scatterings or kozai interactions take place. ingeneral, magnetosphere--disc interactions lead to a broad distribution of thespin--orbit angles, with some systems aligned and other systems misaligned.

1009.3233	evolution of spin direction of accreting magnetic protostars and  spin-orbit misalignment in exoplanetary systems: ii. warped discs	magnetic interactions between a protostar and its accretion disc tend toinduce warping in the disc and produce secular changes in the stellar spindirection, so that the spin axis may not always be perpendicular to the disc.this may help explain the recently observed spin-orbit misalignment in a numberof exoplanetary systems. we study the dynamics of warped protoplanetary discsunder the combined effects of magnetic warping/precession torques and internalstresses in the disc, including viscous damping of warps and propagation ofbending waves. we show that when the outer disc axis is misaligned with thestellar spin axis, the disc evolves towards a warped steady-state on atimescale that depends on the disc viscosity or the bending wave propagationspeed, but in all cases is much shorter than the timescale for the spinevolution (of order of a million years). moreover, for the most likely physicalparameters characterizing magnetic protostars, circumstellar discs and theirinteractions, the steady-state disc has a rather small warp, such that thewhole disc lies approximately in a single plane determined by the outer discboundary conditions, although more extreme parameters may give rise to largerdisc warps. in agreement with our recent analysis (lai et al. 2010) based onflat discs, we find that the back-reaction magnetic torques of the slightlywarped disc on the star can either align the stellar spin axis with the discaxis or push it towards misalignment, depending on the parameters of thestar-disc system. this implies that newly formed planetary systems may have arange of inclination angles between the stellar spin axis and the symmetry axisof the planetary orbits.

1009.3316	tidal excitation of oscillation modes in compact white dwarf binaries:  i. linear theory	we study the tidal excitation of gravity modes (g-modes) in compact whitedwarf binary systems with periods ranging from minutes to hours. as the orbitof the system decays via gravitational radiation, the orbital frequencyincreases and sweeps through a series of resonances with the g-modes of thewhite dwarf. at each resonance, the tidal force excites the g-mode to arelatively large amplitude, transferring the orbital energy to the stellaroscillation. we calculate the eigenfrequencies of g-modes and their couplingcoefficients with the tidal field for realistic non-rotating white dwarfmodels. using these mode properties, we numerically compute the excited modeamplitude in the linear approximation as the orbit passes though the resonance,including the backreaction of the mode on the orbit. we also derive analyticalestimates for the mode amplitude and the duration of the resonance, whichaccurately reproduce our numerical results for most binary parameters. we findthat the g-modes can be excited to a dimensionless (mass-weighted) amplitude upto 0.1, with the mode energy approaching $10^{-3}$ of the gravitational bindingenergy of the star. this suggests that thousands of years prior to the binarymerger, the white dwarf may be heated up significantly by tidal interactions.however, more study is needed since the physical amplitudes of the excitedoscillation modes become highly nonlinear in the outer layer of the star, whichcan reduce the mode amplitude attained by tidal excitation.

0708.3863	condensed surfaces of magnetic neutron stars, thermal surface emission,  and particle acceleration above pulsar polar caps	for sufficiently strong magnetic fields and/or low temperatures, the neutronstar surface may be in a condensed state with little gas or plasma above it.such surface condensation can significantly affect the thermal emission fromisolated neutron stars, and may lead to the formation of a charge-depletedacceleration zone ("vacuum gap") in the magnetosphere above the stellar polarcap. using the latest results on the cohesive property of magnetic condensedmatter, we quantitatively determine the conditions for surface condensation andvacuum gap formation in magnetic neutron stars. we find that condensation canoccur if the thermal energy kt of the neutron star surface is less than about8% of its cohesive energy q_s, and that a vacuum gap can form if the neutronstar's rotation axis and magnetic moment point in opposite directions and kt isless than about 4% of q_s. thus, vacuum gap accelerators may exist for someneutron stars. motivated by this result, we also study the physics of paircascades in the vacuum gap model for photon emission by accelerating electronsand positrons due to both curvature radiation and resonant/nonresonant inversecompton scattering. our calculations of the condition of cascade-induced vacuumbreakdown and the related pulsar death line/boundary generalize previous worksto the superstrong field regime. we find that inverse compton scatterings donot produce a sufficient number of high energy photons in the gap and thus donot lead to pair cascades for most neutron star parameters. we discuss theimplications of our results for the recent observations of neutron star thermalradiation as well as for the detection/non-detection of radio emission fromhigh-b pulsars and magnetars.

1011.4887	low-$t/|w|$ instabilities in differentially rotating proto-neutron stars  with magnetic fields	recent hydrodynamical simulations have shown that differentially rotatingneutron stars formed in core-collapse supernovae may develop globalnon-axisymmetric instabilities even when $t/|w|$ (the ratio of the rotationalkinetic energy $t$ to the gravitational potential energy $|w|$) is relativelysmall (less than 0.1). such low-$t/|w|$ instability can give rise to efficientgravitational wave emission from the proto-neutron star. we investigate howthis instability is affected by magnetic fields using a cylindrical stellarmodel. wave absorption at the corotation resonance plays an important role infacilitating the hydrodynamic low-$t/|w|$ instability. in the presence of atoroidal magnetic field, the corotation resonance is split into two magneticresonances where wave absorptions take place. we show that the toroidalmagnetic field suppresses the low-$t/|w|$ instability when the total magneticenergy $w_{\rm b}$ is of order $0.2\,t$ or larger, corresponding to toroidalfields of a few $\times 10^{16}$ g or stronger. although poloidal magneticfields do not influence the instability directly, they can affect theinstability by generating toroidal fields through linear winding of the initialpoloidal field and magneto-rotational instability. we show that an initialpoloidal field with strength as small as $10^{14}$ g may suppress thelow-$t/|w|$ instability.

1105.2602	faraday rotation in pulsar magnetosphere	the magnetosphere of a pulsar is composed of relativistic plasmas streamingalong the magnetic field lines and corotating with the pulsar. we study theintrinsic faraday rotation in the pulsar magnetosphere by critically examiningthe wave modes and the variations of polarization properties for the circularlypolarized natural modes under various assumptions about the magnetosphereplasma properties. since it is difficult to describe analytically the faradayrotation effect in such a plasma, we use numerical integrations to study thewave propagation effects in the corotating magnetosphere. faraday rotationeffect is identified among other propagation effects, such as wave modecoupling and the cyclotron absorption. in a highly symmetricalelectron-positron pair plasma, the faraday rotation effect is found to benegligible. only for asymmetrical plasmas, such as the electron-ion streamingplasma, can the faraday rotation effect become significant, and the faradayrotation angle is found to be approximately proportional to $\lambda^{0.5}$instead of the usual $\lambda^2$-law. for such electrons-ion plasma of pulsarmagnetosphere, the induced rotation measure becomes larger at higherfrequencies, and should have opposite signs for the emissions from oppositemagnetic poles.

1107.4594	dynamical tides in eccentric binaries and tidally-excited stellar  pulsations in kepler koi-54	recent observation of the tidally-excited stellar oscillations in themain-sequence binary koi-54 by the kepler satellite provides a uniqueopportunity for studying dynamical tides in eccentric binary systems. wedevelop a general theory of tidal excitation of oscillation modes of rotatingbinary stars, and apply our theory to tidally excited gravity modes (g-modes)in koi-54. the strongest observed oscillations, which occur at 90 and 91 timesthe orbital frequency, are likely due to prograde m=2 modes (relative to thestellar spin axis) locked in resonance with the orbit. the remaining fluxoscillations with frequencies that are integer multiples of the orbitalfrequency are likely due to nearly resonant m=0 g-modes; such axisymmetricmodes generate larger flux variations compared to the m=2 modes, assuming thatthe spin inclination angle of the star is comparable to the orbital inclinationangle. we examine the process of resonance mode locking under the combinedeffects of dynamical tides on the stellar spin and orbit and the intrinsicstellar spindown. we show that koi-54 can naturally evolve into a state inwhich at least one m=2 mode is locked in resonance with the orbital frequency.our analysis provides an explanation for the fact that only oscillations withfrequencies less than 90-100 times the orbital frequency are observed. we havealso found evidence from the published kepler result that three-mode nonlinearcoupling occurs in the koi-54 system. we suggest that such nonlinear modecoupling may explain the observed oscillations that are not harmonics of theorbital frequency.

1108.4910	dynamical tides in compact white dwarf binaries: tidal synchronization  and dissipation	in compact white dwarf (wd) binary systems (with periods ranging from minutesto hours), dynamical tides involving the excitation and dissipation of gravitywaves play a dominant role in determining the physical conditions of the wdsprior to mass transfer or binary merger. we calculate the amplitude of thetidally excited gravity waves as a function of the tidal forcing frequency\omega=2(\omega-\omega_s) (where \omega is the orbital frequency and \omega_sis the spin frequency) for several realistic carbon-oxygen wd models, assumingthat the waves are efficiently dissipated in the outer layer of the star bynonlinear effects or radiative damping. the mechanism of wave excitation in wdsis complex due to the sharp features associated with composition changes insidethe wd, and in our wd models gravity waves are launched just below thehelium-carbon boundary. we find that the tidal torque on the wd and the relatedtidal energy transfer rate, \dot e_{\rm tide}, depend on \omega in an erraticway. on average, \dot e_{\rm tide} scales approximately as \omega^5\omega^5 fora large range of tidal frequencies. we also study the effects of dynamicaltides on the long-term evolution of wd binaries. above a critical orbitalfrequency \omega_c, corresponding to an orbital period of order one hour(depending on wd models), dynamical tides efficiently drive \omega_s toward\omega, although a small, almost constant degree of asynchronization(\omega-\omega_s\sim {\rm constant}) is maintained even at the smallest binaryperiods. while the orbital decay is always dominated by gravitationalradiation, the tidal energy transfer can induce significant phase error in thelow-frequency gravitational waveforms, detectable by the planned lisa project.tidal dissipation may also lead to significant heating of the wd envelope andbrightening of the system long before binary merger.

1109.4703	tidal dissipation in planet-hosting stars: damping of spin-orbit  misalignment and survival of hot jupiters	observations of hot jupiters around solar-type stars with very short orbitalperiods (~day) suggest that tidal dissipation in such stars is not tooefficient so that these planets can survive against rapid orbital decay. thisis consistent with recent theoretical works, which indicate that the tidal q ofplanet-hosting stars can indeed be much larger than the values inferred fromstellar binaries. on the other hand, recent measurements of rossiter-mclaughlineffects in transiting hot jupiter systems not only reveal that many suchsystems have misaligned stellar spin with respect to the orbital axis, but alsoshow that systems with cooler host stars tend to have aligned spin and orbitalaxes. winn et al. suggested that this obliquity - temperature correlation maybe explained by efficient damping of stellar obliquity due to tidal dissipationin the star. this explanation, however, is in apparent contradiction with thesurvival of these short-period hot jupiters. we show that in the solar-typeparent stars of close-in exoplanetary systems, the effective tidal q governingthe damping of stellar obliquity can be much smaller than that governingorbital decay. this is because for misaligned systems, the tidal potentialcontains a fourier component with frequency equal to the stellar spin frequency(in the rotating frame of the star). this component can excite inertial wavesin the convective envelope of the star, and the dissipation of inertial wavesthen leads to a spin-orbit alignment torque, but not orbital decay. bycontrast, for aligned systems, such inertial wave excitation is forbidden sincethe tidal forcing frequency is much larger than the stellar spin frequency. wederive a general effective tidal evolution theory for misaligned binaries,taking account of different tidal responses and dissipation rates for differenttidal forcing components.

1211.3721	assembly of protoplanetary disks and inclinations of circumbinary  planets	the kepler satellite has discovered a number of transiting planets aroundclose binary stars. these circumbinary systems have highly aligned planetaryand binary orbits. in this paper, we explore how the mutual inclination betweenthe planetary and binary orbits may reflect the physical conditions of theassembly of protoplanetary disks and the interaction between protostellarbinaries and circumbinary disks. given the turbulent nature of star-formingmolecular clouds, it is possible that the gas falling onto the outer region ofa circumbinary disk and the central protostellar binary have different axes ofrotation. thus, the newly assembled circumbinary disk can be misaligned withrespect to the binary. however, the gravitational torque from the binaryproduces a warp and twist in the disk, and the back-reaction torque tends toalign the disk and the binary orbital plane. we present a new, analyticcalculation of this alignment torque, and show that the binary-disk inclinationangle can be reduced appreciably after the binary accretes a few percent of itsmass from the disk. our calculation suggests that in the absence of otherdisturbances, circumbinary disks and planets around close (sub-au) stellarbinaries, for which mass accretion onto the proto-binary is very likely to haveoccurred, are expected to be highly aligned with the binary orbits, while disksand planets around wide binaries can be misaligned. measurements of the mutualinclinations of circumbinary planetary systems can provide a clue to the birthenvironments of such systems.

1212.1219	rossby wave instability in accretion discs with large-scale poloidal  magnetic fields	we study the effect of large-scale magnetic fields on the non-axisymmetricrossby wave instability (rwi) in accretion discs. the instability developsaround a density bump, which is likely present in the transition region betweenthe active zone and dead zone of protoplanetary discs. previous works suggestthat the vortices resulting from the rwi may facilitate planetesimal formationand angular momentum transport. we consider discs threaded by a large-scalepoloidal magnetic field, with a radial field component at the disc surface.such field configurations may lead to the production of magnetic winds or jets.in general, the magnetic field can affect the rwi even when it is sub-thermal(plasma $\beta\sim 10$). for infinitely thin discs, the instability can beenhanced by about 10 percent. for discs with finite thickness, with a radialgradient of the magnetic field strength, the rwi growth rate can increasesignificantly (by a factor of $\sim 2$) as the field approaches equipartition($\beta \sim 1$). our result suggests that the rwi can continue to operate indiscs that produce magnetic winds.

1212.2215	simulations of overstable inertial-acoustic modes in black-hole  accretion discs	we present two-dimensional inviscid hydrodynamic simulations of overstableinertial-acoustic oscillation modes (p-modes) in black-hole accretion discs.these global spiral waves are trapped in the inner-most region of the disc, andare driven overstable by wave absorption at the corotation resonance ($r_c$)when the gradient of the background disc vortensity (vorticity divided bysurface density) at $r_c$ is positive and the disc inner boundary issufficiently reflective. previous linear calculations have shown that thegrowth rates of these modes can be as high as 10% of the rotation frequency atthe disc inner edge. we confirm these linear growth rates and the primary discoscillation frequencies in our simulations when the mode amplitude undergoesexponential growth. we show that the mode growth saturates when the radialvelocity perturbation becomes comparable to the disc sound speed. during thesaturation stage, the primary disc oscillation frequency differs only slightly(by less than a few percent) from the linear mode frequency. sharp features inthe fluid velocity profiles at this stage suggest that the saturation resultsfrom nonlinear wave steepening and mode-mode interactions.

1212.5323	high-frequency qpos and overstable oscillations of black-hole accretion  disks	the physical origin of high-frequency qpos (hfqpos) in black-hole x-raybinaries remains an enigma despite many years of detailed observationalstudies. although there exists a number of models for hfqpos, many of these aresimply "notions" or "concepts" without actual calculation derived from fluid ordisk physics. future progress requires a combination of numerical simulationsand semi-analytic studies to extract physical insights. we review recent workson global oscillation modes in black-hole accretion disks, and explain how,with the help of general relativistic effects, the energy stored in the diskdifferential rotation can be pumped into global spiral density modes in thedisk, making these modes grow to large amplitudes under certain conditions("corotational instability"). these modes are robust in the presence of diskmagnetic fields and turbulence. the computed oscillation mode frequencies arelargely consistent with the observed values for hfqpos in bh x-ray binaries.the approximate 2:3 frequency ratio is also expected from this model. theconnection of hfqpos with other disk properties (such as production of episodicjets) is also discussed.

1308.4968	viscoelastic tidal dissipation in giant planets and formation of hot  jupiters through high-eccentricity migration	we study the possibility of tidal dissipation in the solid cores of giantplanets and its implication for the formation of hot jupiters throughhigh-eccentricity migration. we present a general framework by which the tidalevolution of planetary systems can be computed for any form of tidaldissipation, characterized by the imaginary part of the complex tidal lovenumber, ${\rm im}[{\tilde k}_2(\omega)]$, as a function of the forcingfrequency $\omega$. using the simplest viscoelastic dissipation model (themaxwell model) for the rocky core and including the effect of a nondissipativefluid envelope, we show that with reasonable (but uncertain) physicalparameters for the core (size, viscosity and shear modulus), tidal dissipationin the core can accommodate the tidal-q constraint of the solar system gasgiants and at the same time allows exoplanetary hot jupiters to form via tidalcircularization in the high-e migration scenario. by contrast, the often-usedweak friction theory of equilibrium tide would lead to a discrepancy betweenthe solar system constraint and the amount of dissipation necessary for high-emigration. we also show that tidal heating in the rocky core can lead to modestradius inflation of the planets, particularly when the planets are in thehigh-eccentricity phase ($e\sim 0.6$) during their high-e migration. finally,as an interesting by-product of our study, we note that for a generic tidalresponse function ${\rm im}[{\tilde k}_2(\omega)]$, it is possible that spinequilibrium (zero torque) can be achieved for multiple spin frequencies (at agiven $e$), and the actual pseudo-synchronized spin rate depends on theevolutionary history of the system.

1309.0045	non-radial oscillations in rotating giant planets with solid cores:  application to saturn and its rings	recent observations have revealed evidence for the global oscillations ofjupiter and saturn, which can potentially provide a new window into theinterior structure of giant planets. motivated by these observations, we studythe non-radial oscillation modes of giant planets containing a solid core. ourcalculations include the elastic response of the core and consider a wide rangeof possible values of the core shear modulus. while the elasticity of the coreonly slightly changes the frequencies of acoustic modes, which reside mostly inthe fluid envelope, it adds two new classes of shear modes that are largelyconfined to the core. we also calculate the effects of the coriolis force onthe planetary oscillation modes. in addition to changing the mode frequencies,the coriolis force can cause the shear modes to mix with the f-modes. suchmixing occurs when the frequencies of the shear mode and the f-mode are closeto each other, and results in "mixed modes" with similar properties that areslightly split in frequency. we discuss our results in light of the recent workby hedman &amp; nicholson (2013), which revealed the presence of density waves insaturn's c-ring that appear to be excited by the gravitational perturbationsassociated with the f-mode oscillations within saturn. we find that the finesplitting in wave frequencies observed in the rings can in principle beexplained by the rotation-induced mixing between core shear modes and f-modes,possibly indicating the presence of a solid core within saturn. however, in ourcurrent calculations, which assume rigid-body rotation and include onlyfirst-order rotational effects, significant fine-tuning in the planetary modelparameters is needed in order to achieve these mode mixings and to explain theobserved fine frequency splitting. we briefly discuss other effects that maymodify the f-modes and facilitate mode mixing.

1402.1907	star-disc-binary interactions in protoplanetary disc systems and  primordial spin-orbit misalignments	we study the interactions between a protostar and its circumstellar discunder the influence of an external binary companion to determine the evolutionof the mutual stellar spin - disc misalignment angle. the gravitational torqueon the disc from an inclined binary makes the disc precess around the binaryaxis, while the star-disc interaction torque due to the rotation-inducedquadrupole makes the stellar spin and the disc angular momentum axes precessaround each other. a significant star-disc misalignment angle can be generatedfrom a small initial value as the star-disc system evolves in time such thatthe two precession frequencies cross each other. this ``secular resonance''behavior can be understood in a geometric way from the precession dynamics ofspin and disc angular momenta. we derive the conditions for such resonance tooccur, and find that they can be satisfied for reasonable protostar-disc-binaryparameters. the evolution of star-disc inclination is also affected by massaccretion and by magnetic star-disc interaction torques, which can eitherpromote or reduce star-disc misalignment. in general, as long as the initialbinary-disc inclination is greater than a few degrees, a variety of star-discmisalignment angles can be generated within the disc lifetimes. we discuss theimplications of our results for the stellar spin orientations in binaries, forthe alignments/misalignments of protostellar discs and debris discs, and forthe stellar obliquities in exoplanetary systems. in particular, if hot jupitersare produced by the kozai effect induced by an external stellar companion, thenit is likely that ``primordial'' star-disc misalignments are already generatedby the star-disc-binary interactions. even for systems where the kozai effectis suppressed, misaligned planets may still be produced during theprotoplanetary disc phase.

1406.2717	dynamical tides in compact white dwarf binaries: influence of rotation	tidal interactions play an important role in the evolution and ultimate fateof compact white dwarf (wd) binaries. not only do tides affect the pre-mergerstate (such as temperature and rotation rate) of the wds, but they may alsodetermine which systems merge and which undergo stable mass transfer. in thispaper, we attempt to quantify the effects of rotation on tidal angular momentumtransport in binary stars, with specific calculations applied to wd stellarmodels. we incorporate the effect of rotation using the traditionalapproximation, in which the dynamically excited gravity waves within the wdsare transformed into gravito-inertial hough waves. the coriolis force has onlya minor effect on prograde gravity waves, and previous results predicting thetidal spin-up and heating of inspiraling wds are not significantly modified.however, rotation strongly alters retrograde gravity waves and inertial waves,with important consequences for the tidal spin-down of accreting wds. weidentify new dynamical tidal forcing terms that arise from a proper separationof the equilibrium and dynamical tide components; these new forcing terms arevery important for systems near synchronous rotation. additionally, we discussthe impact of stokes drift currents on the wave angular momentum flux. finally,we speculate on how tidal interactions will affect super-synchronously rotatingwds in accreting systems.

1406.3331	evolution of linear warps in accretion discs and applications to  protoplanetary discs in binaries	warped accretion discs are expected in many protostellar binary systems. inthis paper, we study the long-term evolution of disc warp and precession fordiscs with dimensionless thickness $h/r$ larger than their viscosity parameter$\alpha$, such that bending waves can propagate and dominate the warpevolution. for small warps, these discs undergo approximately rigid-bodyprecession. we derive analytical expressions for the warp/twist profiles of thedisc and the alignment timescale for a variety of models. applying our resultsto circumbinary discs, we find that these discs align with the orbital plane ofthe binary on a timescale comparable to the global precession time of the disc,and typically much smaller than its viscous timescale. we discuss theimplications of our finding for the observations of misaligned circumbinarydiscs (such as kh 15d) and circumbinary planetary systems (such as kepler-413);these observed misalignments provide useful constraints on the uncertainaspects of the disc warp theory. on the other hand, we find that circumstellardiscs can maintain large misalignments with respect to the plane of the binarycompanion over their entire lifetime. we estimate that inclination angleslarger than $\sim 20^\circ$ can be maintained for typical disc parameters.overall, our results suggest that while highly misaligned circumstellar discsin binaries are expected to be common, such misalignments should be rare forcircumbinary discs. these expectations are consistent with current observationsof protoplanetary discs and exoplanets in binaries, and can be tested withfuture observations.

1408.0800	viscous driving of global oscillations in accretion discs around black  holes	we examine the role played by viscosity in the excitation of globaloscillation modes (both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric) in accretion discsaround black holes using two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. theturbulent viscosity is modeled by the $\alpha$-ansatz, with different equationsof state. we consider both discs with transonic radial inflows across theinnermost stable circular orbit, and stationary discs truncated by a reflectingwall at their inner edge, representing a magnetosphere. in transonic discs,viscosity can excite several types of global oscillation modes. these modes areeither axisymmetric with frequencies close to multiples of the maximum radialepicyclic frequency $\kappa_\mathrm{max}$, non-axisymmetric with frequenciesclose to multiples of of the innermost stable orbit frequency$\omega_\mathrm{isco}$, or hybrid modes whose frequencies are linearcombinations of these two frequencies. small values of the viscosity parameter$\alpha$ primarily produce non-axisymmetric modes, while axisymmetric modesbecome dominant for large $\alpha$. the excitation of these modes may berelated to an instability of the sonic point, at which the radial infall speedis equal to the sound speed of the gas. in discs with a reflective innerboundary, we explore the effect of viscosity on trapped $p$-modes which areintrinsically overstable due to the corotation resonance effect. the effect ofviscosity is either to reduce the growth rates of these modes, or to completelysuppress them and excite a new class of higher frequency modes. the latterrequires that the dynamic viscosity scales positively with the disc surfacedensity, indicating that it is a result of the classic viscous overstabilityeffect.

1409.6717	suppression of extreme orbital evolution in triple systems with short  range forces	the lidov-kozai (lk) mechanism plays an important role in the secularevolution of many hierarchical triple systems. the standard lk mechanismconsists of large-amplitude oscillations in eccentricity and inclination of abinary subject to the quadrupole potential from an outer perturber. recent workhas shown that when the octupole terms are included in the potential, the innerbinary can reach more extreme eccentricities as well as undergo orientationflips. it is known that pericenter precessions due to short-range effects, suchas general relativity and tidal and rotational distortions, can limit thegrowth of eccentricity and even suppress standard (quadrupolar) lkoscillations, but their effect on the octupole-level lk mechanism has not beenfully explored. in this paper, we systematically study how these short-rangeforces affect the extreme orbital behaviour found in octupole lk cycles. ingeneral, the influence of the octupole potential is confined to a range ofinitial mutual inclinations itot centered around 90deg (when the inner binarymass ratio is &lt;&lt;1), with this range expanding with increasing octupolestrength. we find that, while the short-range forces do not change the widthand location of this "window of influence", they impose a strict upper limit onthe maximum achievable eccentricity. this limiting eccentricity can becalculated analytically, and its value holds even for strong octupole potentialand for the general case of three comparable masses. short-range forces alsoaffect orbital flips, progressively reducing the range of itot within whichflips are possible as the intensity of these forces increases.

1411.0739	chaotic dynamics of stellar spin driven by planets undergoing  lidov-kozai oscillations: resonances and origin of chaos	many exoplanetary systems containing hot jupiters are found to possesssignificant misalignment between the spin axis of the host star and theplanet's orbital angular momentum axis. a possible channel for producing suchmisaligned hot jupiters involves lidov-kozai oscillations of the planet'sorbital eccentricity and inclination driven by a distant binary companion. in arecent work (storch, anderson &amp; lai 2014), we have shown that a proto-hotjupiter undergoing lidov-kozai oscillations can induce complex, and oftenchaotic, evolution of the spin axis of its host star. here we explore theorigin of the chaotic spin behavior and its various features in an idealizednon-dissipative system where the secular oscillations of the planet's orbit arestrictly periodic. using hamiltonian perturbation theory, we identify a set ofsecular spin-orbit resonances in the system, and show that overlaps of theseresonances are responsible for the onset of wide-spread chaos in the evolutionof stellar spin axis. the degree of chaos in the system depends on theadiabaticity parameter $\epsilon$, proportional to the ratio of the lidov-kozainodal precession rate and the stellar spin precession rate, and thus depends onthe planet mass, semi-major axis and the stellar rotation rate. for systemswith zero initial spin-orbit misalignment, our theory explains the occurrence(as a function of $\epsilon$) of "periodic islands" in the middle of a "chaoticocean" of spin evolution, and the occurrence of restricted chaos in middle ofregular/periodic spin evolution. finally, we discuss a novel "adiabaticresonance advection" phenomenon, in which the spin-orbit misalignment, trappedin a resonance, gradually evolves as the adiabaticity parameter slowly changes.this phenomenon can occur for certain parameter regimes when tidal decay of theplanetary orbit is included.

0705.1901	hall drift of axisymmetric magnetic fields in solid neutron-star matter	hall drift, i. e., transport of magnetic flux by the moving electrons givingrise to the electrical current, may be the dominant effect causing theevolution of the magnetic field in the solid crust of neutron stars. it is anonlinear process that, despite a number of efforts, is still not fullyunderstood. we use the hall induction equation in axial symmetry to obtain somegeneral properties of nonevolving fields, as well as analyzing the evolution ofpurely toroidal fields, their poloidal perturbations, and current-free, purelypoloidal fields. we also analyze energy conservation in hall instabilities andwrite down a variational principle for hall equilibria. we show that theevolution of any toroidal magnetic field can be described by burgers' equation,as previously found in plane-parallel geometry. it leads to sharp currentsheets that dissipate on the hall time scale, yielding a stationary fieldconfiguration that depends on a single, suitably defined coordinate. thisfield, however, is unstable to poloidal perturbations, which grow as theirfield lines are stretched by the background electron flow, as in instabilitiesearlier found numerically. on the other hand, current-free poloidalconfigurations are stable and could represent a long-lived crustal fieldsupported by currents in the fluid stellar core.

1504.02917	tidal truncation of inclined circumstellar and circumbinary discs in  young stellar binaries	recent observations have shown that circumstellar and circumbinary discs inyoung stellar binaries are often misaligned with respect to the binary orbitalplane. we analyze the tidal truncation of such misaligned discs due to torquesapplied to the disc at the lindblad resonances from the tidal forcings of thebinary. we consider eccentric binaries with arbitrary binary-disc inclinationangles. we determine the dependence of the tidal forcing strengths on thebinary parameters and show that they are complicated non-monotonic functions ofeccentricity and inclination. we adopt a truncation criterion determined by thebalance between resonant torque and viscous torque, and use it to calculate theouter radii of circumstellar discs and the inner radii of circumbinary discs.misaligned circumstellar discs have systematically larger outer radii thanaligned discs, and are likely to fill their roche lobes if inclined by morethan $45^\circ - 90^\circ$, depending on the binary mass ratio and discviscosity parameter. misaligned circumbinary discs generally have smaller innerradii than aligned discs, but the details depend sensitively on the binary anddisc parameters.

1505.05514	survival of planets around shrinking stellar binaries	the discovery of transiting circumbinary planets by the kepler missionsuggests that planets can form efficiently around binary stars. none of thestellar binaries currently known to host planets has a period shorter than 7days, despite the large number of eclipsing binaries found in the kepler targetlist with periods shorter than a few days. these compact binaries are believedto have evolved from wider orbits into their current configurations via theso-called lidov-kozai migration mechanism, in which gravitational perturbationsfrom a distant tertiary companion induce large-amplitude eccentricityoscillations in the binary, followed by orbital decay and circularization dueto tidal dissipation in the stars. here we explore the orbital evolution ofplanets around binaries undergoing orbital decay by this mechanism. we showthat planets may survive and become misaligned from their host binary, or maydevelop erratic behavior in eccentricity, resulting in their consumption by thestars or ejection from the system as the binary decays. our results suggestthat circumbinary planets around compact binaries could still exist, and weoffer predictions as to what their orbital configurations should be like.

0806.1938	effects of magnetic fields on the diskoseismic modes of accreting black  holes	the origin of the rapid quasi-periodic variabilities observed in a number ofaccreting black hole x-ray binaries is not understood. it has been suggestedthat these variabilities are associated with diskoseismic oscillation modes ofthe black hole accretion disk. in particular, in a disk with no magnetic field,the so-called g-modes (inertial oscillations) can be self-trapped at the innerregion of the disk due to general relativistic effects. real accretion disks,however, are expected to be turbulent and contain appreciable magnetic fields.we show in this paper that even a weak magnetic field (with the magnetic energymuch less than the thermal energy) can modify or "destroy" the self-trappingzone of disk g-modes, rendering their existence questionable in realistic blackhole accretion disks. the so-called corrugation modes (c-modes) are alsostrongly affected when the poloidal field approaches equal-partition. on theother hand, acoustic oscillations (p-modes), which do not have verticalstructure, are not affected qualitatively by the magnetic field, and thereforemay survive in a turbulent, magnetic disk.

1512.04450	rossby wave instability and long-term evolution of dead zones in  protoplanetary discs	the physical mechanism of angular momentum transport in poorly ionizedregions of protoplanetary discs, the dead zones (dzs), is not understood. thepresence of a dz naturally leads to conditions susceptible to the rossby waveinstability (rwi), which produces vortices and spiral density waves that mayrevive the dz and be responsible for observed large-scale disc structures. wepresent a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to investigate therole of the rwi in dzs, including its impact on the long-term evolution of thedisc and its morphology. the nonlinear rwi can generate reynolds stresses(effective $\alpha$ parameter) as large as $0.01 - 0.05$ in the dz, helping tosustain quasi-steady accretion throughout the disc. it also produces novel discmorphologies, including azimuthal asymmetries with $m = 1, 2$, and atypicalvortex shapes. the angular momentum transport strength and morphology are mostsensitive to two parameters: the radial extent of the dz and the discviscosity. the largest reynolds stresses are produced when the radial extent ofthe dz is less than its distance to the central star. such narrow dzs lead to asingle vortex or two coherent antipodal vortices in the quasi-steady state. theedges of wider dzs evolve separately, resulting in two independent vortices andreduced angular momentum transport efficiency. in either case, we find that,because of the reynolds stresses generated by the nonlinear rwi, gravitationalinstability is unlikely to play a role in angular momentum transport across thedz, unless the accretion rate is sufficiently high.

astro-ph;0004066	global nonradial instabilities of dynamically collapsing gas spheres	self-similar solutions provide good descriptions for the gravitationalcollapse of spherical clouds or stars when the gas obeys a polytropic equationof state, $p=k\rho^\gamma$ (with $\gamma\le 4/3$). we study the behaviors ofnonradial perturbations in the similarity solutions of larson, penston andyahil, which describe the evolution of the collapsing cloud prior to coreformation. our global stability analysis reveals the existence of unstablebar-modes ($l=2$) when $\gamma\le 1.09$. in particular, for the collapse ofisothermal spheres, which applies to the early stages of star formation, the$l=2$ density perturbation relative to the background, $\delta\rho({\bfr},t)/\rho(r,t)$, increases as $(t_0-t)^{-0.352}\propto \rho_c(t)^{0.176}$,where $t_0$ denotes the epoch of core formation, and $\rho_c(t)$ is the cloudcentral density. thus, the isothermal cloud tends to evolve into an ellipsoidalshape (prolate bar or oblate disk, depending on initial conditions) as thecollapse proceeds. in the context of type ii supernovae, core collapse isdescribed by the $\gamma\simeq 1.3$ equation of state, and our analysisindicates that there is no growing mode (with density perturbation) in thecollapsing core before the proto-neutron star forms, although nonradialperturbations can grow during the subsequent accretion of the outer core andenvelope onto the neutron star. we also carry out a global stability analysisfor the self-similar expansion-wave solution found by shu, which describes thepost-collapse accretion (``inside-out'' collapse) of isothermal gas onto aprotostar. we show that this solution is unstable to perturbations of all$l$'s, although the growth rates are unknown.

astro-ph;0007272	pulsar jets: implications for neutron star kicks and initial spins	we study implications for the apparent alignment of the spin axes,proper-motions, and polarization vectors of the crab and vela pulsars. the spinaxes are deduced from recent chandra x-ray observatory images that reveal jetsand nebular structure having definite symmetry axes. the alignments indicatethese pulsars were born either in isolation or with negligible velocitycontributions from binary motions. we examine the effects of rotation and theconditions under which spin-kick alignment is produced for various models ofneutron star kicks. if the kick is generated when the neutron star first formsby asymmetric mass ejection or/and neutrino emission, then the alignmentrequires that the protoneutron star possesses an original spin with period$p_s$ much less than the kick timescale, thus spin-averaging the kick forces.the kick timescale ranges from 100 ms to 10 s depending on whether the kick ishydrodynamically driven or neutrino-magnetic field driven. for hydrodynamicalmodels, spin-kick alignment further requires the rotation period of anasymmetry pattern at the radius near shock breakout (&gt;100 km) to be much lessthan ~100 ms; this is difficult to satisfy unless rotation plays a dynamicallyimportant role in the core collapse and explosion ($p_s\lo 1$ ms). aligned kickand spin vectors are inherent to the slow process of asymmetric electromagneticradiation from an off-centered magnetic dipole. we reassess the viability ofthis effect, correcting a factor of 4 error in harrison and tademaru'scalculation that increases the size of the effect. to produce a kick velocityof order a few hundred km/s requires that the neutron star be born with aninitial spin close to 1 ms and that spindown due to r-mode driven gravitationalradiation be inefficient compared to standard magnetic braking.

astro-ph;0012118	precession of magnetically driven warped disks and low-frequency qpos in  low-mass x-ray binaries	an accretion disk around a rotating magnetized star is subjected to magnetictorques which induce disk warping and precession. these torques arise frominteractions between the stellar field and the induced surface currents on thedisk. applying these new effects to weakly magnetized ($b\sim 10^7-10^9$g)neutron stars in low-mass x-ray binaries, we study the global hydrodynamicalwarping/precession modes of the disk under the combined influences ofrelativistic frame dragging, classical precession due to the oblateness of theneutron star, and the magnetic torques. under quite general conditions, themagnetic warping torque can overcome the ``bardeen-petterson'' viscous dampingand makes the modes grow. the modes are confined to the inner region of thedisk, and have frequencies close to the sum of the lense-thirring frequency,the classical precession frequency, and the magnetically driven precessionfrequency evaluated at the inner disk radius $r_{in}$. as $\dot m$ increases,the mode frequency is reduced relative to the total precession frequency at$r_{in}$ since the mode is less concentrated around $r_{in}$ due to theincreasing viscous stress associated with the large $\dot m$. because of this,and because the magnetically driven precession is retrograde and dependsstrongly on $\dot m$, the mode frequency can have a non-monotonic dependence on$\dot m$. this may account for several observed features of low-frequency(10--60 hz) quasi-periodic oscillations (lfqpos) in low-mass x-ray binarieswhich are otherwise difficult to explain, such as the flattening/turnover inthe lfqpo frequency--$\dot m$ correlation or in the lfqpo frequency--khz qpofrequency correlation (e.g., as seen clearly in gx 17+2).

astro-ph;0104199	atmospheres and spectra of strongly magnetized neutron stars	we construct atmosphere models for strongly magnetized neutron stars withsurface fields $b\sim 10^{12}-10^{15}$ g and effective temperatures $t_{\rmeff}\sim 10^6-10^7$ k. the atmospheres directly determine the characteristicsof thermal emission from isolated neutron stars, including radio pulsars, softgamma-ray repeaters, and anomalous x-ray pulsars. in our models, the atmosphereis composed of pure hydrogen or helium and is assumed to be fully ionized. theradiative opacities include free-free absorption and scattering by bothelectrons and ions computed for the two photon polarization modes in themagnetized electron-ion plasma. since the radiation emerges from deep layers inthe atmosphere with $\rho\ga 10^2$ g/cm$^3$, plasma effects can significantlymodify the photon opacities by changing the properties of the polarizationmodes. in the case where the magnetic field and the surface normal areparallel, we solve the full, angle-dependent, coupled radiative transferequations for both polarization modes. we also construct atmosphere models forgeneral field orientations based on the diffusion approximation of thetransport equations and compare the results with models based on full radiativetransport. in general, the emergent thermal radiation exhibits significantdeviation from blackbody, with harder spectra at high energies. the spectraalso show a broad feature ($\delta e/\ebi\sim 1$) around the ion cyclotronresonance $\ebi=0.63 (z/a)(b/10^{14}{g})$ kev, where $z$ and $a$ are the atomiccharge and atomic mass of the ion, respectively; this feature is particularlypronounced when $\ebi\ga 3k\teff$. detection of the resonance feature wouldprovide a direct measurement of the surface magnetic fields on magnetars.

astro-ph;0211315	transfer of polarized radiation in strongly magnetized plasmas and  thermal emission from magnetars: effect of vacuum polarization	we present a theoretical study of radiative transfer in strongly magnetizedelectron-ion plasmas, focusing on the effect of vacuum polarization due toquantum electrodynamics. this study is directly relevant to thermal radiationfrom the surfaces of highly magnetized neutron stars, which have been detectedin recent years. strong-field vacuum polarization modifies the photonpropagation modes in the plasma, and induces a ``vacuum resonance'' at which apolarized x-ray photon propagating outward in the neutron star atmosphere canconvert from a low-opacity mode to a high-opacity mode and vice versa. theeffectiveness of this mode conversion depends on the photon energy and theatmosphere density gradient. for a wide range of field strengths, $7\times10^{13}&lt; b &lt; 10^{16}$ g, the vacuum resonance lies between the photospheres ofthe two photon modes, and the emergent radiation spectrum from the neutron staris significantly modified by the vacuum resonance. (for lower field strengths,only the polarization spectrum is affected.) under certain conditions, whichdepend on the field strength, photon energy and propagation direction, thevacuum resonance is accompanied by the phenomenon of mode collapse (at whichthe two photon modes become degenerate) and the breakdown of faradaydepolarization. thus, the widely used description of radiative transfer basedon photon modes is not adequate to treat the vacuum polarization effectrigorously. we study the evolution of polarized x-rays across the vacuumresonance and derive the transfer equation for the photon intensity matrix(stokes parameters), taking into account the effect of birefringence of theplasma-vacuum medium, free-free absorption, and scatterings by electrons andions.

astro-ph;0307324	warping and precession of accretion disks around magnetic stars:  nonlinear evolution	the inner region of the accretion disk around a magnetized star (t tauristar, white dwarf or neutron star) is subjected to magnetic torques that inducewarping and precession of the disk. these torques arise from the interactionbetween the stellar field and the induced electric currents in the disk. wecarry out numerical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of warped, viscousaccretion disks driven by the magnetic torques. we show that the disk candevelop into a highly warped steady state in which the disk attains a fixed(warped) shape and precesses rigidly. the warp is most pronounced at the diskinner radius (near the magnetosphere boundary). as the system parameters (suchas accretion rate) change, the disk can switch between a completely flat state(warping stable) and a highly warped state. the precession of warped disks maybe responsible for a variety of quasi-periodic oscillations or radiation fluxvariabilities observed in many different systems, including young stellarobjects and x-ray binaries.

astro-ph;0406001	radiation from condensed surface of magnetic neutron stars	recent observations show that the thermal x-ray spectra of many isolatedneutron stars are featureless and in some cases (e.g., rx j1856.5-3754) wellfit by a blackbody. such a perfect blackbody spectrum is puzzling sinceradiative transport through typical neutron star atmospheres causes noticeabledeviation from blackbody. previous studies have shown that in a strong magneticfield, the outermost layer of the neutron star may be in a condensed solid orliquid form because of the greatly enhanced cohesive energy of the condensedmatter. the critical temperature of condensation increases with the magneticfield strength, and can be as high as 10^6 k (for fe surface at b \sim 10^{13}g or h surface at b \sim a few times 10^{14} g). thus the thermal radiation candirectly emerge from the degenerate metallic condensed surface, without goingthrough a gaseous atmosphere. here we calculate the emission properties(spectrum and polarization) of the condensed fe and h surfaces of magneticneutron stars in the regimes where such condensation may be possible. for asmooth condensed surface, the overall emission is reduced from the blackbody byless than a factor of 2. the spectrum exhibits modest deviation from blackbodyacross a wide energy range, and shows mild absorption features associated withthe ion cyclotron frequency and the electron plasma frequency in the condensedmatter. the roughness of the solid condensate (in the fe case) tends todecrease the reflectivity of the surface, and make the emission spectrum evencloser to blackbody. we discuss the implications of our results forobservations of dim, isolated neutron stars and magnetars.

astro-ph;0411726	effects of gravitational lensing in the double pulsar system j0737-3039	we investigate the effects of gravitational lensing in the binary pulsarsystem j0737-3039. current measurement of the orbital inclination allows themillisecond pulsar (a) to pass very close (at r_{min}=4000 km) in projection tothe companion pulsar (b), with r_{min} comparable to the einstein radius (2600km). for this separation at the conjunction, lensing causes small (about 10%)magnification of the pulsar a signal on a timescale of several seconds, anddisplaces the pulsar image on the sky plane by about 1200 km. more importantly,lensing introduces a correction (of several microsec) to the conventionalshapiro delay formula used in pulsar timing analysis, and gives rise to ageometric time delay together with the delays associated with the pulsar spinperiod. these lensing effects can influence the determination of the systemparameters by both timing and scintillation studies. given the currentuncertainty in the orbital inclination, more extreme manifestations of lensing(e.g. magnification by a factor of several) are possible. we compare ourpredictions with the existing observations and discuss the possibility ofdetecting gravitational lensing signatures in the system. the anomalously highpoint in a's lightcurve close to superior conjunction might be caused bygravitational lensing.

astro-ph;0503461	effects of pulsar rotation on timing measurements of the double pulsar  system j0737-3039	we study the effect of pulsar rotation on timing of binary pulsars, withparticular emphasis on the double pulsar system j0737-3039. specialrelativistic aberration due to the orbital motion of pulsar changes both thelongitude and colatitude of the emission direction with respect to the pulsarspin axis. the former gives rise to a shift of the arrival time of the pulsecentroid (this is the conventional ``longitudinal'' aberration delay), thelatter results in a distortion (contraction or dilation) of the pulse profileon the orbital timescale. the amplitude of pulse distortion depends inverselyon the variation of polarization position angle across the pulse. for smallangle between the pulsar magnetic and spin axes, as inferred for psrj0737-3039a from polarimetric observations, the pulse distortion is significant(\sim 1%) and the associated ``latitudinal'' aberration delay is much largerthan the longitudinal one. by monitoring the arrival time of separate pulsecomponents as a function of pulsar orbital phase, the latitudinal aberrationdelay may be easily measured with the current timing precision, thusconstraining the spin geometry of the system. the latitudinal delay can also bedetected by monitoring system's orbital parameters on the geodetic precessiontimescale. because of the near edge-on orbital orientation of the psrj0737-3039 system, general relativistic bending of pulsar a's radio beam nearits superior conjunction also introduces spin-dependent time delays of similarorder of magnitude as the aberration delays. in addition, light bending splitsthe pulse profile into two variable components, corresponding to twogravitationally lensed images of the source. detection of lensing effects ischallenging, but may be possible with existing technology.

astro-ph;0509484	neutron star kicks in isolated and binary pulsars: observational  constraints and implications for kick mechanisms	we study observational constraints on neutron star (ns) kicks for isolatedpulsars and for neutron stars in binary systems. we are particularly interestedin the evidence of kick-spin alignment/misalignment and its dependence on theneutron star initial spin period. for several young pulsars, x-ray observationsof compact nebulae showed that pulsar proper motion is aligned with the spindirection as defined by the symmetry axis of the nebula. we also criticallyexamine the measurements of the proper motion and the projected spin axis froma large sample of pulsars with well-calibrated polarization data. we find thatamong the two dozen pulsars for which reliable measurements are available,there is a significant correlation between the spin axis and the proper motion.for various ns binaries, including double ns systems, binaries with massivemain-sequence star companion and binaries with massive white-dwarf companion,we obtain constraints on the kick magnitudes and directions from the observedorbital characteristics of the system. we find that the kick velocity ismisaligned with the the ns spin axis in a number of systems, and the ns spinperiod (when available) in these systems is generally longer than severalhundreds milliseconds. these constraints, together with spin-kick alignmentobserved in many isolated pulsars, suggest that the kick timescale is hundredsof milliseconds to 1 s, so that spin-kick alignment or misalignment can beobtained depending on the initial spin period of the ns. we discuss theimplication of our result for various ns kick mechanisms.

astro-ph;0510069	wave excitation in three-dimensional disks by external potential	we study the excitation of density and bending waves and the associatedangular momentum transfer in gaseous disks with finite thickness by a rotatingexternal potential. the disk is assumed to be isothermal in the verticaldirection and has no self-gravity. the disk perturbations are decomposed intodifferent modes, each characterized by the azimuthal index m and the verticalindex n, which specifies the nodal number of the density perturbation along thedisk normal direction. the n=0 modes correspond to the two-dimensional densitywaves previously studied by goldreich &amp; tremaine and others. in athree-dimensional disk, waves can be excited at both lindblad resonances (formodes with n=0,1,2...) and vertical resonances (for the $n\ge 1$ modes only).the torque on the disk is positive for waves excited at outer linblad/verticalresonances and negative at inner lindblad/vertical resonances. while the n=0modes are evanescent around corotation, the $n\ge 1$ modes can propagate intothe corotation region where they are damped and deposit their angular momenta.we have derived analytical expressions for the amplitudes of different wavemodes excited at lindblad and/or vertical resonances and the resulting torqueson the disk. it is found that for $n\ge 1$, angular momentum transfer throughvertical resonances is much more efficient than lindblad resonances. thisimplies that in some situations (e.g., a circumstellar disk perturbed by aplanet in an inclined orbit), vertical resonances may be an important channelof angular momentum transfer between the disk and the external potential. wehave also derived new formulae for the angular momentum deposition atcorotation and studied wave excitations at disk boundaries.

astro-ph;0512417	effects of gravitational lensing and companion motion on the binary  pulsar timing	the measurement of the shapiro time delay in binary pulsar systems withhighly inclined orbit can be affected both by the motion of the pulsar'scompanion because of the finite time it takes a photon to cross the binary, andby the gravitational light bending if the orbit is sufficiently edge-onrelative to the line of sight. here we calculate the effect of retardation dueto the companion's motion on various time delays in pulsar binaries, includingthe shaipro delay, the geometric lensing delay, and the lens-induced delaysassociated with the pulsar rotation. our results can be applied to systems sohighly inclined that near conjunction gravitational lensing of the pulsarradiation by the companion becomes important (the recently discovered doublepulsar system j0737-3039 may exemplify such a system). to the leading order,the effect of retardation is to shift all the delay curves backward in timearound the orbit conjunction, without affecting the shape and amplitude of thecurves. the time shift is of order the photon orbit crossing time, and rangesfrom a second to a few minutes for the observed binary pulsar systems. in thedouble pulsar system j0737-3039, the motion of the companion may also affectthe interpretation of the recent correlated interstellar scintillationmeasurements. finally, we show that lensing sets an upper limit on themagnitude of the frame-dragging time delay caused by the companion's spin, andmakes this delay unobservable in stellar-mass binary pulsar systems.

astro-ph;0607168	atmosphere models of magnetized neutron stars: qed effects, radiation  spectra, and polarization signals	theoretical modeling of surface emission from magnetized neutron stars (nss)requires proper treatment of qed effects, in particular the effect of photonmode conversion due to the ``vacuum resonance'' between plasma and vacuumpolarization. previous ns atmosphere models incorporated this effectapproximately, using transfer equations for the photon modes which areinadequate near the vacuum resonance, particularly for field strengths around$b_l\simeq 7\times 10^{13}$ g, where the vacuum resonance occurs near thephotosphere. in this paper, we provide an accurate treatment of the qed-inducedmode conversion effect in ns atmosphere models, employing both the modalradiative transfer equations, coupled with an accurate mode conversionprobability at the resonance, and the full evolution equations for the photonstokes parameters. in doing so, we are able to quantitatively calculate theeffects of vacuum polarization on the atmosphere emission spectra, beampatterns, and polarizations for the entire range of field strengths,$b=10^{12}-10^{15}$ g. we find that for nss with $b\ga 2 b_l$, vacuumpolarization reduces the widths of spectral features, and softens the hardspectral tail typical of magnetized atmosphere models. for $b\la b_l/2$, vacuumpolarization does not change the emission spectra, but can significantly affectthe polarization signals. we show that vacuum polarization induces a uniqueenergy-dependent linear polarization signature, and that circular polarizationcan be generated in the magnetospheres of rapidly rotating nss. we discuss theimplications of our results for recent observations of thermally emittingisolated nss and magnetars, as well as the prospects for future spectral andpolarization observations.

astro-ph;9605096	orbital decay of the psr j0045-7319/b star binary system: age of radio  pulsar and initial spin of neutron star	recent timing observations of psr j0045-7319 reveal that the neutron star/bstar binary orbit is decaying on a time scale of $|\porb/\dot\porb|=0.5$ myr,shorter than the characteristic age ($\tau_c=3$ myr) of the pulsar (kaspi etal.~1996a). we study mechanisms for the orbital decay. the standard weakfriction theory based on static tide requires far too short a viscous time toexplain the observed $\dot\porb$. we show that dynamical tidal excitation ofg-modes in the b star can be responsible for the orbital decay. however, toexplain the observed short decay timescale, the b star must have somesignificant retrograde rotation with respect to the orbit --- the retrograderotation brings lower-order g-modes, which couple much more strongly to thetidal potential, into closer ``resonances'' with the orbital motion, thussignificantly enhancing the dynamical tide. a much less likely possibility isthat the g-mode damping time is much shorter than the ordinary radiativedamping time. the observed orbital decay timescale combined with a genericorbital evolution model based on dynamical tide can be used as a ``timer'',giving an upper limit of $1.4$ myr for the age of the binary system since theneutron star formation. thus the characteristic age of the pulsar is not a goodage indicator. assuming standard magnetic dipole braking for the pulsar and nosignificant magnetic field decay on a timescale $\lo 1$ myr, the upper limitfor the age implies that the initial spin of the neutron star at birth wasclose to its current value.

astro-ph;9704130	hydrogen phases on the surface of a strongly magnetized neutron star	the outermost layers of some neutron stars are likely to be dominated byhydrogen, as a result of fast gravitational settling of heavier elements. theselayers directly mediate thermal radiation from the stars, and determine thecharacteristics of x-ray/euv spectra. for a neutron star with surfacetemperature $t\lo 10^6$ k and magnetic field $b\go 10^{12}$ g, various forms ofhydrogen can be present in the envelope, including atom, poly-molecules, andcondensed metal. we study the physical properties of different hydrogen phaseson the surface of a strongly magnetized neutron star for a wide range of fieldstrength $b$ and surface temperature $t$. depending on the values of $b$ and$t$, the outer envelope can be either in a nondegenerate gaseous phase or in adegenerate metallic phase. for $t\go 10^5$ k and moderately strong magneticfield, $b\lo 10^{13}$ g, the envelope is nondegenerate and the surface materialgradually transforms into a degenerate coulomb plasma as density increases. forhigher field strength, $b&gt;&gt; 10^{13}$ g, there exists a first-order phasetransition from the nondegenerate gaseous phase to the condensed metallicphase. the column density of saturated vapor above the metallic hydrogendecreases rapidly as the magnetic field increases or/and temperature decreases.thus the thermal radiation can directly emerge from the degenerate metallichydrogen surface. the characteristics of surface x-ray/euv emission fordifferent phases are discussed. a separate study concerning the possibility ofmagnetic field induced nuclear fusion of hydrogen on the neutron star surfaceis also presented.

astro-ph;9704132	dynamical tides in rotating binary stars	we study the effect of rotation on the excitation of internal oscillationmodes of a star by the external gravitational potential of its companion.unlike the nonrotating case, there are difficulties with the usual modedecomposition for rotating stars because of the asymmetry between modespropagating in the direction of rotation and those propagating opposite to it.for an eccentric binary system, we derive general expressions for the energytransfer $\delta e_s$ and the corresponding angular momentum transfer $\deltaj_s$ in a periastron passage when there is no initial oscillation present inthe star. except when a nearly precise orbital resonance occurs (i.e., the modefrequency equals multiple of the orbital frequency), $\delta e_s$ is very closeto the steady-state mode energy in the tide in the presence of dissipation. itis shown that stellar rotation can change the strength of dynamical tidesignificantly. in particular, retrograde rotation with respect to the orbitincreases the energy transfer by bringing lower-order g-modes (or f-mode forconvective stars), which couple more strongly to the tidal potential, intocloser resonances with the orbital motion of the companion.  we apply our general formalism to the problems of tidal capture binaryformation and the orbital evolution of psr j0045-7319/b-star binary. stellarrotation changes the critical impact parameter for binary capture. although theenhancement (by retrograde rotation) in the capture cross section is at most$\sim 20%$, the probability that the captured system survivesdisruption/merging and therefore becomes a binary can be significantly larger.it is found that in order to explain the observed rapid orbital decay of thepsr j0045-7319 binary system, retrograde rotation in the b-star is required.

astro-ph;9802345	neutrino transport in strongly magnetized proto-neutron stars and the  origin of pulsar kicks: the effect of asymmetric magnetic field topology	in proto-neutron stars with strong magnetic fields, the cross section for$\nu_e$ ($\bar\nu_e$) absorption on neutrons (protons) depends on the localmagnetic field strength due to the quantization of energy levels for the $e^-$($e^+$) produced in the final state. if the neutron star possesses anasymmetric magnetic field topology in the sense that the magnitude of magneticfield in the north pole is different from that in the south pole, thenasymmetric neutrino emission may be generated. we calculate the absorptioncross sections of $\nue$ and $\bnue$ in strong magnetic fields as a function ofthe neutrino energy. these cross sections exhibit oscillatory behaviors whichoccur because new landau levels for the $e^-$ ($e^+$) become accessible as theneutrino energy increases. by evaluating the appropriately averaged neutrinoopacities, we demonstrate that the change in the local neutrino flux due to themodified opacities is rather small. to generate appreciable kick velocity($\sim 300$ km~s$^{-1}$) to the newly-formed neutron star, the difference inthe field strengths at the two opposite poles of the star must be at least$10^{16}$~g. we also consider the magnetic field effect on the spectralneutrino energy fluxes. the oscillatory features in the absorption opacitiesgive rise to modulations in the emergent spectra of $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$.

astro-ph;9811371	neutrino-nucleon interactions in magnetized neutron-star matter: the  effects of parity violation	we study neutrino-nucleon scattering and absorption in a dense, magnetizednuclear medium. these are the most important sources of neutrino opacitygoverning the cooling of a proto-neutron star in the first tens of secondsafter its formation. because the weak interaction is parity violating, theabsorption and scattering cross-sections depend asymmetrically on thedirections of the neutrino momenta with respect to the magnetic field. wedevelop the moment formalism of neutrino transport in the presence of suchasymmetric opacities and derive explicit expressions for the neutrino flux andother angular moments of the boltzmann transport equation. for a given neutrinospecies, there is a drift flux of neutrinos along the magnetic field inaddition to the usual diffusive flux. this drift flux depends on the deviationof the neutrino distribution function from thermal equilibrium. hence, despitethe fact that the neutrino cross-sections are asymmetric throughout the star,asymmetric neutrino flux can be generated only in the outer region of theproto-neutron star where the neutrino distribution deviates significantly fromthermal equilibrium. in addition to the asymmetric absorption opacity arisingfrom nucleon polarization, we find the contribution of the electron (orpositron) ground state landau level. for neutrinos of energy less than a fewtimes the temperature, this is the dominant source of asymmetric opacity.lastly, we discuss the implication of our result to the origin of pulsar kicks:in order to generate kick velocity of a few hundred km/s from asymmetricneutrino emission using the parity violation effect, the proto-neutron starmust have a dipole magnetic field of at least $10^{15}-10^{16}$ g.

astro-ph;9812116	resonant tidal excitations of rotating neutron stars in coalescing  binaries	in a coalescing neutron star-neutron star (ns-ns) or neutron star-black hole(ns-bh) binary, oscillation modes of the ns can be resonantly excited by thecompanion during the final minutes of the inspiral. the resonant energytransfer between the orbit and ns speeds up or slows down the inspiral andinduces a phase change in the emitted gravitational waves from the binary. atidal resonance, (jk,m), occurs when the mode frequency equals m times theorbital frequency. for f-mode resonance to occur before coalescence, the nsmust have rapid rotation, with spin frequency nu_s&gt;710hz for (22,2)-resonanceand nu_s&gt;570hz for (33,3)-resonance (m=1.4mo and r=10km; however, for r=15km,these spin frequencies become 330hz and 250hz). because of strong tidalcoupling, f-mode resonances induce a large change in the number of orbitalcycles, n_orb, with maximum n_orb~10-1000 for (22,2)-resonance and n_orb~1 for(33,3)- resonance. such resonant effects, if present, must be included inconstructing waveform templates used in searching for gravitational wavesignals. higher order f-mode resonances can occur at slower rotation rates, butn_orb&lt;0.1. for the dominant g-mode (22,2)-resonance, even modest rotation(nu_s&lt;100hz) can enhance the resonant effect on the orbit by shifting resonanceto a smaller orbital frequency. however, because of the weak coupling, n_orblies in the range 10^-3-10^-2 (depending on the ns eos) and is probablynegligible for the purpose of detecting gravitational waves. r-mode resonancesrequire misaligned spin-orbit inclinations, and the dominant resonancescorrespond to (22,3) and (22,1). since tidal coupling depends strongly onrotation rate, n_orb&lt;10^-2(r/10km)^(10)(m/1.4mo)^(-20/3) is negligible forcanonical ns parameters but can be appreciable if the ns radius is larger.

astro-ph;9904110	magnetically driven warping, precession and resonances in accretion  disks	the inner region of the accretion disk onto a rotating magnetized centralstar (neutron star, white dwarf or t tauri star) is subjected to magnetictorques which induce warping and precession of the disk. the origin of thesetorques lies in the interaction between the (induced) surface current on thedisk and the horizontal magnetic field (parallel to the disk) produced by theinclined magnetic dipole. under quite general conditions, there exists amagnetic warping instability in which the magnetic torque drives the disk planeaway from the equatorial plane of the star toward a state where the disk normalvector is perpendicular to the spin axis. viscous stress tends to suppress thewarping instability at large radii, but the magnetic torque always dominates asthe disk approaches the magnetosphere boundary. the magnetic torque also drivesthe tilted inner disk into retrograde precession around the stellar spin axis.moreover, resonant magnetic forcing on the disk can occur which may affect thedynamics of the disk. the magnetically driven warping instability andprecession may be related to a number observational puzzles, including: (1)spin evolution (torque reversal) of accreting x-ray pulsars; (2) quasi-periodicoscillations in low-mass x-ray binaries; (3) super-orbital periods in x-raybinaries; (4) photometric period variations of t tauri stars.

astro-ph;9904111	kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations, magnetic fields and mass of  neutron stars in low-mass x-ray binaries	it has recently been suggested that the maximum observed quasi-periodicoscillation (qpo) frequencies, $\nu_{max}$, for several low-mass x-raybinaries, particularly 4u 1820-30, correspond to the orbital frequency at theinner-most stable orbit of the accretion disk. this would imply that theneutron stars in these systems have masses $\go 2~m_\odot$, considerably largerthan any well-measured neutron star mass. we suggest that the levelling off of$\nu_{qpo}$ may be also understood in terms of a steepening magnetic fieldwhich, although possibly dipolar at the stellar surface, is alteredsubstantially by disk accretion, and presents a ``wall'' to the accretion flowthat may be outside the innermost stable orbit. general relativistic effectsadd to the flattening of the $\nu_{qpo}-\mdot$ relation at frequencies belowthe kepler frequency at the innermost stable orbit. we offer two other possibleways to reconcile the low value of $\nu_{max}$ ($\approx 1060$ hz for 4u1820-30) with a moderate neutron star mass, $\approx 1.4\msun$: at sufficientlylarge $\mdot$, either (i) the disk terminates in a very thin boundary layernear the neutron star surface, or (ii) $\nu_{qpo}$ is not the orbital frequencyright at the inner edge of the disk, but rather at a somewhat larger radius,where the emissivity of the disk peaks.

astro-ph;9907365	tidal interaction between a fluid star and a kerr black hole in circular  orbit	we present a semi-analytic study of the equilibrium models of close binarysystems containing a fluid star (mass $m$ and radius $r_0$) and a kerr blackhole (mass $m$) in circular orbit. we consider the limit $m\gg m$ wherespacetime is described by the kerr metric. the tidally deformed star isapproximated by an ellipsoid, and satisfies the polytropic equation of state.the models also include fluid motion in the stellar interior, allowing binarymodels with nonsynchronized stellar spin (as expected for coalescing neutronstar-black hole binaries) to be constructed. tidal disruption occurs at orbitalradius $r_{\rm tide}\sim r_0(m/m)^{1/3}$, but the dimensionless ratio $\hatr_{\rm tide}=r_{\rm tide}/[r_0(m/m)^{1/3}]$ depends on the spin parameter ofthe black hole as well as on the equation of state and the internal rotation ofthe star. we find that the general relativistic tidal field disrupts the starat a larger $\hat r_{\rm tide}$ than the newtonian tide; the difference isparticularly prominent if the disruption occurs in the vicinity of the blackhole's horizon. in general, $\hat r_{\rm tide}$ is smaller for a (prograderotating) kerr black hole than for a schwarzschild black hole. we apply ourresults to coalescing black hole-neutron star and black hole-white dwarfbinaries. the tidal disruption limit is important for characterizing theexpected gravitational wave signals and is relevant for determining theenergetics of gamma ray bursts which may result from such disruption.

astro-ph;9912296	r-mode oscillations and spindown of young rotating magnetic neutron  stars	recent work has shown that a young, rapidly rotating neutron star losesangular momentum to gravitational waves generated by unstable r-modeoscillations. we study the spin evolution of a young, magnetic neutron starincluding both the effects of gravitational radiation and magnetic braking(modeled as magnetic dipole radiation). our phenomenological description ofnonlinear r-modes is similar to, but distinct from, that of owen et al. (1998)in that our treatment is consistent with the principle of adiabatic invariancein the limit when direct driving and damping of the mode are absent. we showthat, while magnetic braking tends to increase the r-mode amplitude by spinningdown the neutron star, it nevertheless reduces the efficiency of gravitationalwave emission from the star. for b &gt;= 10^14 (\nus/300 hz)^2 g, where \nus isthe spin frequency, the spindown rate and the gravitational waveforms aresignificantly modified by the effect of magnetic braking. we also estimate thegrowth rate of the r-mode due to electromagnetic (fast magnetosonic) waveemission and due to alfven wave emission in the neutron star magnetosphere. thealfven wave driving of the r-mode becomes more important than the gravitationalradiation driving when b &gt;= 10^13 (\nus/150 hz)^3 g; the electromagnetic wavedriving of the r-mode is much weaker. finally, we study the properties of localrossby-alfven waves inside the neutron star and show that the fractional changeof the r-mode frequency due to the magnetic field is of order 0.5 (b/10^16 g)^2(\nus/100 hz)^-2.

0810.0203	corotational instability of inertial-acoustic modes in black hole  accretion discs and quasi-periodic oscillations	we study the global stability of non-axisymmetric p-modes (also calledinertial-acoustic modes) trapped in the inner-most regions of accretion discsaround black holes. we show that the lowest-order (highest-frequency) p-modes,with frequencies $\omega=(0.5-0.7) m\omega_{\rm isco}$, can be overstable dueto general relativistic effects, according to which the radial epicyclicfrequency is a non-monotonic function of radius near the black hole. the modeis trapped inside the corotation resonance radius and carries a negativeenergy. the mode growth arises primarily from wave absorption at the corotationresonance, and the sign of the wave absorption depends on the gradient of thedisc vortensity. when the mode frequency is sufficiently high, such that theslope of the vortensity is positive at corotation positive wave energy isabsorbed at the resonance, leading to the growth of mode amplitude. we alsostudy how the rapid radial inflow at the inner edge of the disc affects themode trapping and growth. our analysis of the behavior of the fluidperturbations in the transonic flow near the isco indicates that, while theinflow tends to damp the mode, the damping effect is sufficiently small undersome conditions so that net mode growth can still be achieved. we furtherclarify the role of the rossby wave instability and show that it does notoperate for black hole accretion discs with smooth-varying vortensity profiles.overstable non-axisymmetric p-modes driven by the corotational instabilityprovide a plausible explanation for the high-frequency (&gt; 100 hz)quasi-periodic oscillations (hfqpos) observed from a number of black-hole x-raybinaries in the very high state. the absence of hfqpos in the soft (thermal)state may result from mode damping due to the radial infall at the isco.
