0902.3142	type ii supernovae as probes of cosmology	- constraining the cosmological parameters and understanding dark energy havetremendous implications for the nature of the universe and its physical laws.  - the pervasive limit of systematic uncertainties reached by cosmographybased on cepheids and type ia supernovae (sne ia) warrants a search forcomplementary approaches.  - type ii sne have been shown to offer such a path. their distances can bewell constrained by luminosity-based or geometric methods. competing,complementary, and concerted efforts are underway, to explore and exploit thoseobjects that are extremely well matched to next generation facilities.spectroscopic follow-up will be enabled by space- based and 20-40 meter classtelescopes.  - some systematic uncertainties of type ii sne, such as reddening by dust andmetallicity effects, are bound to be different from those of sne ia. theirstellar progenitors are known, promising better leverage on cosmic evolution.in addition, their rate - which closely tracks the ongoing star formation rate- is expected to rise significantly with look- back time, ensuring an adequatesupply of distant examples.  - these data will competitively constrain the dark energy equation of state,allow the determination of the hubble constant to 5%, and promote ourunderstanding of the processes involved in the last dramatic phases of massivestellar evolution.

0903.4509	research science and education: the nsf's astronomy and astrophysics  postdoctoral fellowship	the nsf's astronomy and astrophysics postdoctoral fellowship (aapf) isexceptional among the available postdoctoral awards in astronomy andastrophysics. the fellowship is one of the few that allows postdoctoralresearchers to pursue an original research program, of their own design, at theu.s. institution of their choice. however, what makes this fellowship trulyunique is the ability of fellows to lead an equally challenging, originaleducational program simultaneously. the legacy of this singular fellowship hasbeen to encourage and advance leaders in the field who are equally aspassionate about their own research as they are about sharing that research andtheir passion for astronomy with students and the public.  in this positional paper we address the importance of fellowships like theaapf to the astronomical profession by identifying the science and educationalcontributions that fellows have made to the community. further, we recommendthat fellowships that encourage leading postdoctoral researchers to also becomeleaders in astronomy education be continued and expanded.

0908.1812	seeking core-collapse supernova progenitors in pre-explosion images	i summarize what we have learned about the nature of stars that ultimatelyexplode as core-collapse supernovae from the examination of images taken priorto the explosion. by registering pre-supernova and post-supernova images,usually taken at high resolution using either space-based optical detectors, orground-based infrared detectors equipped with laser guide star adaptive opticssystems, nearly three dozen core-collapse supernovae have now had theproperties of their progenitor stars either directly measured or (morecommonly) constrained by establishing upper limits on their luminosities. thesestudies enable direct comparison with stellar evolution models that, in turn,permit estimates of the progenitor stars' physical characteristics to be made.i review progenitor characteristics (or constraints) inferred from this workfor each of the major core-collapse supernova types (ii-plateau, ii-linear,iib, iin, ib/c), with a particular focus on the analytical techniques used andthe processes through which conclusions have been drawn. brief discussion of afew individual events is also provided, including sn 2005gl, a type iinsupernova that is shown to have had an extremely luminous -- and thus verymassive -- progenitor that exploded shortly after a violent, luminous bluevariable-like eruption phase, contrary to standard theoretical predictions.

1010.2689	caltech core-collapse project (cccp) observations of type iin  supernovae: typical properties and implications for their progenitor stars	type iin supernovae (sne iin) are rare events, constituting only a fewpercent of all core-collapse sne, and the current sample of well observed sneiin is small. here, we study the four sne iin observed by the caltechcore-collapse project (cccp). the cccp sn sample is unbiased to the extent thatobject selection was not influenced by target sn properties. therefore, theseevents are representative of the observed population of sne iin. we find that anarrow p-cygni profile in the hydrogen balmer lines appears to be a ubiquitousfeature of sne iin. our light curves show a relatively long rise time (&gt;20days) followed by a slow decline stage (0.01 to 0.15 mag/day), and a typicalv-band peak magnitude of m_v=-18.4 +/- 1.0 mag. we measure the progenitor starwind velocities (600 - 1400 km/s) for the sne in our sample and derivepre-explosion mass loss rates (0.026 - 0.12 solar masses per year). we compilesimilar data for sne iin from the literature, and discuss our results in thecontext of this larger sample. our results indicate that typical sne iin arisefrom progenitor stars that undergo lbv-like mass-loss shortly before theyexplode.

1012.0570	the old environment of the faint calcium-rich supernova sn 2005cz	the supernova sn 2005cz has recently attracted some attention, due to thefact that it was spectroscopically similar to type ib supernovae (sne), a classthat is presumed to result from core-collapse of massive stars, yet it occurredin an elliptical galaxy, where one expects very few massive stars to exist. twoexplanations for this remarkable event were put forward. perets et al. (2010)associate sn 2005cz with the class of ca-rich, faint sne ib, which likelyresult from old double-white-dwarf systems with a he-rich secondary. on theother hand, kawabata et al. (2010) suggest that sn 2005cz is indeed acore-collapse event (in a binary system), albeit of a star at the lower end ofthe mass range, 10-12 m_sun. the existence of this star in its elliptical hostis explained as resulting from low-level star formation (sf) activity in thatgalaxy. here we present extensive observations of the location of sn 2005cz,sensitive to a variety of sf tracers, including optical spectroscopy, h_alphaemission, uv emission and hst photometry. we show that ngc 4589, the hostgalaxy of sn 2005cz, does not show any signatures of a young stellar populationor recent sf activity either close to or far from the location of sn 2005cz.

0709.3258	the dual-axis circumstellar environment of the type iin supernova 1997eg	we present multi-epoch spectral and spectropolarimetric observations of thetype iin supernova (sn) 1997eg that indicate the presence of a flatteneddisk-like concentration of circumstellar material surrounding nonsphericalejecta, with which the disk is misaligned. the polarization across the broad halpha, h beta, and he i 5876 lines of sn 1997eg forms closed loops when viewedin the stokes q-u plane. such loops occur when the geometrical symmetry of oneor both of the stokes parameters across spectral lines is broken, in this casemost likely by occultation of the ejecta by the equatorial circumstellar matterconcentration. the polarization of the narrow balmer lines possesses anintrinsic axis that differs by 12 degrees from that of the elongated ejecta andprobably indicates the orientation of the disk-like circumstellar material. theexistence of two different axes of symmetry in sn 1997eg suggests that neitherrotation of the progenitor nor the influence of a companion star can be thesole mechanism creating a preferred axis within the supernova system. our modelsupports the emerging hypothesis that the progenitors of some type iinsupernovae are luminous blue variable stars, whose pre-supernova mass eruptionsform the circumstellar shells that physically characterize the sn iin subclass.these conclusions, which are independent of interstellar polarization effects,would have been unobservable with only a single epoch of spectropolarimetry.

1109.5406	a spectropolarimetric comparison of the type ii-plateau supernovae sn  2008bk and sn 2004dj	the type ii-plateau supernova (sn ii-p) sn 2004dj was the first sn ii-p forwhich spectropolarimetry data were obtained with fine temporal sampling before,during, and after the fall off of the photometric plateau -- the point thatmarks the transition from the photospheric to the nebular phase in sne ii-p.unpolarized during the plateau, sn 2004dj showed a dramatic spike inpolarization during the descent off of the plateau, and then exhibited a smoothpolarization decline over the next two hundred days. this behavior wasinterpreted by leonard et al. (2006) as evidence for a strongly non-sphericalexplosion mechanism that had imprinted asphericity only in the innermostejecta. in this brief report, we compare nine similarly well-sampled epochs ofspectropolarimetry of the type ii-p sn 2008bk to those of sn 2004dj. incontrast to sn 2004dj, sn 2008bk became polarized well before the end of theplateau and also retained a nearly constant level of polarization through theearly nebular phase. curiously, although the onset and persistence ofpolarization differ between the two objects, the detailed spectropolarimetriccharacteristics at the epochs of recorded maximum polarization for the twoobjects are extremely similar, feature by feature. we briefly interpret thedata in light of non-local-thermodynamic equilibrium, time-dependentradiative-transfer simulations specifically crafted for sn ii-p ejecta.

1110.5809	evidence for type ia supernova diversity from ultraviolet observations  with the hubble space telescope	we present ultraviolet (uv) spectroscopy and photometry of four type iasupernovae (sne 2004dt, 2004ef, 2005m, and 2005cf) obtained with the uv prismof the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope. this datasetprovides unique spectral time series down to 2000 angstrom. significantdiversity is seen in the near maximum-light spectra (~ 2000--3500 angstrom) forthis small sample. the corresponding photometric data, together with archivaldata from swift ultraviolet/optical telescope observations, provide furtherevidence of increased dispersion in the uv emission with respect to theoptical. the peak luminosities measured in uvw1/f250w are found to correlatewith the b-band light-curve shape parameter dm15(b), but with much largerscatter relative to the correlation in the broad-band b band (e.g., ~0.4 magversus ~0.2 mag for those with 0.8 &lt; dm15 &lt; 1.7 mag). sn 2004dt is found as anoutlier of this correlation (at &gt; 3 sigma), being brighter than normal sne iasuch as sn 2005cf by ~0.9 mag and ~2.0 mag in the uvw1/f250w and uvm2/f220wfilters, respectively. we show that different progenitor metallicity orline-expansion velocities alone cannot explain such a large discrepancy.viewing-angle effects, such as due to an asymmetric explosion, may have asignificant influence on the flux emitted in the uv region. detailed modelingis needed to disentangle and quantify the above effects.

0710.3166	constraining the type ia supernova progenitor: the search for hydrogen  in nebular spectra	despite intense scrutiny, the progenitor system(s) that gives rise to type iasupernovae remains unknown. the favored theory invokes a carbon-oxygen whitedwarf accreting hydrogen-rich material from a close companion until athermonuclear runaway ensues that incinerates the white dwarf. however,simulations resulting from this single-degenerate, binary channel demand thepresence of low-velocity h-alpha emission in spectra taken during the latenebular phase, since a portion of the companion's envelope becomes entrained inthe ejecta. this hydrogen has never been detected, but has only rarely beensought. here we present results from a campaign to obtain deep, nebular-phasespectroscopy of nearby type ia supernovae, and include multi-epoch observationsof two events: sn 2005am (slightly subluminous) and sn 2005cf (normallybright). no h-alpha emission is detected in the spectra of either object. anupper limit of 0.01 m_sun of solar abundance material in the ejecta isestablished from the models of mattila et al. which, when coupled with themass-stripping simulations of marietta et al. and meng et al. effectively rulesout progenitor systems for these supernovae with secondaries close enough tothe white dwarf to be experiencing roche lobe overflow at the time ofexplosion. alternative explanations for the absence of h-alpha emission, alongwith suggestions for future investigations necessary to confidently excludethem as possibilities, are critically evaluated.

1111.6109	calcium-rich gap transients in the remote outskirts of galaxies	from the first two seasons of the palomar transient factory, we identifythree peculiar transients (ptf09dav, ptf10iuv, ptf11bij) with fivedistinguishing characteristics: peak luminosity in the gap between novae andsupernovae (m_r = 15.5 to -16.5), rapid photometric evolution (rise-time~12--15 days), large photospheric velocities (~6000 to 11000 km/s), earlyspectroscopic evolution into nebular phase (~1 to 3 months) and peculiarnebular spectra dominated by calcium. we also culled the extensive decade-longlick observatory supernova search database and identified an additional memberof this group, sn 2007ke. our choice of photometric and spectroscopicproperties was motivated by sn 2005e (perets et al. 2010). to our surprise, asin the case of sn 2005e, all four members of this group are also clearly offsetfrom the bulk of their host galaxy. given the well-sampled early and late-timelight curves, we derive ejecta masses in the range of 0.4--0.7 msun.spectroscopically, we find that there may be a diversity in the photosphericphase, but the commonality is in the unusual nebular spectra. our extensivefollow-up observations rule out standard thermonuclear and standardcore-collapse explosions for this class of "calcium-rich gap" transients. ifthe progenitor is a white dwarf, we are likely seeing a detonation of the whitedwarf core and perhaps, even shockfront interaction with a previously ejectednova shell. in the less likely scenario of a massive star progenitor, a verynon-standard channel specific to a low-metallicity environment needs to beinvoked (e.g., ejecta fallback leading to black hole formation). detection (orlack thereof) of a faint underlying host (dwarf galaxy, cluster) will provide acrucial and decisive diagnostic to choose between these alternatives.

1201.2913	the standardizability of type ia supernovae in the near-infrared:  evidence for a peak luminosity-decline rate relation in the near-infrared	we analyze the standardizability of type ia supernovae (sne ia) in thenear-infrared (nir) by investigating the correlation between observed peak nirabsolute magnitude and post-maximum b-band decline rate. a sample of 27low-redshift sne ia observed by the carnegie supernova project between 2004 to2007 is used. all 27 objects have pre-maximum coverage in optical bands, with asubset of 13 having pre-maximum nir observations as well. we describe themethods used to derive absolute peak magnitudes and decline rates from bothspline- and template-fitting procedures, and confirm prior findings thatfitting templates to sne ia light curves in the nir is problematic due to thediversity of post-maximum behaviour of objects that are characterized bysimilar decline rate values, especially at high decline rates. nevertheless, weshow that nir light curves can be reasonably fit with a template, especially ifthe observations begin within 5 days after nir maximum. for the subset of 13objects in our dataset that excludes the highly reddened and fast declining sneia, and includes only those objects for which nir observations began prior tofive days after maximum light, we find modest evidence for a peakluminosity-decline rate relation in y, and stronger evidence in j and h. usingrv values differing from the canonical value of 3.1 is shown to have littleeffect on the results. a hubble diagram is presented for the nir bands and theb band. the resulting scatter for the combined nir bands is 0.13 mag, while theb band produces a scatter of 0.22 mag. the data suggest that applying acorrection to sne ia peak luminosities for decline rate is likely to bebeneficial in the j and h bands to make sne ia more precise distanceindicators, but of only marginal importance in the y band.

1206.2029	caltech core-collapse project (cccp) observations of type ii supernovae:  evidence for three distinct photometric subtypes	we present r-band light curves of type ii supernovae (sne) from the caltechcore collapse project (cccp). with the exception of interacting (type iin) sneand rare events with long rise times, we find that most light curve shapesbelong to one of three distinct classes: plateau, slowly declining and rapidlydeclining events. the last class is composed solely of type iib sne whichpresent similar light curve shapes to those of sne ib, suggesting, perhaps,similar progenitor channels. we do not find any intermediate light curves,implying that these subclasses are unlikely to reflect variance of continuousparameters, but rather might result from physically distinct progenitorsystems, strengthening the suggestion of a binary origin for at least somestripped sne. we find a large plateau luminosity range for sne iip, while theplateau lengths seem rather uniform at approximately 100 days. as analysis ofadditional cccp data goes on and larger samples are collected, demographicstudies of core collapse sne will likely continue to provide new constraints onprogenitor scenarios.

1304.0763	type ia supernovae strongly interacting with their circumstellar medium	owing to their utility for measurements of cosmic acceleration, type iasupernovae (sne) are perhaps the best-studied class of sne, yet the progenitorsystems of these explosions largely remain a mystery. a rare subclass of sne iashow evidence of strong interaction with their circumstellar medium (csm), andin particular, a hydrogen-rich csm; we refer to them as sne ia-csm. in thefirst systematic search for such systems, we have identified 16 sne ia-csm, andhere we present new spectra of 13 of them. six sne ia-csm have beenwell-studied previously, three were previously known but are analyzed in-depthfor the first time here, and seven are new discoveries from the palomartransient factory. the spectra of all sne ia-csm are dominated by h{\alpha}emission (with widths of ~2000 km/s) and exhibit large h{\alpha}/h{\beta}intensity ratios (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the snejecta overtaking slower-moving csm shells); moreover, they have an almostcomplete lack of he i emission. they also show possible evidence of dustformation through a decrease in the red wing of h{\alpha} 75-100 d past maximumbrightness, and nearly all sne ia-csm exhibit strong na i d absorption from thehost galaxy. the absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction)of sne ia-csm are found to be -21.3 &lt;= m_r &lt;= -19 mag, and they also seem toshow ultraviolet emission at early times and strong infrared emission at latetimes (but no detected radio or x-ray emission). finally, the host galaxies ofsne ia-csm are all late-type spirals similar to the milky way, or dwarfirregulars like the large magellanic cloud, which implies that these objectscome from a relatively young stellar population. this work represents the mostdetailed analysis of the sn ia-csm class to date.

1309.4457	hubble space telescope and ground-based observations of the type iax  supernovae sn 2005hk and sn 2008a	we present hubble space telescope (hst) and ground-based optical andnear-infrared observations of sn 2005hk and sn 2008a, typical members of thetype iax class of supernovae (sne). here we focus on late-time observations,where these objects deviate most dramatically from all other sn types. insteadof the dominant nebular emission lines that are observed in other sne at latephases, spectra of sne 2005hk and 2008a show lines of fe ii, ca ii, and fe imore than a year past maximum light, along with narrow [fe ii] and [ca ii]emission. we use spectral features to constrain the temperature and density ofthe ejecta, and find high densities at late times, with n_e &gt;~ 10^9 cm^-3. suchhigh densities should yield enhanced cooling of the ejecta, making theseobjects good candidates to observe the expected "infrared catastrophe," ageneric feature of sn ia models. however, our hst photometry of sn 2008a doesnot match the predictions of an infrared catastrophe. moreover, our hstobservations rule out a "complete deflagration" that fully disrupts the whitedwarf for these peculiar sne, showing no evidence for unburned material at latetimes. deflagration explosion models that leave behind a bound remnant canmatch some of the observed properties of sne iax, but no published model isconsistent with all of our observations of sne 2005hk and 2008a.

1403.4240	multi-epoch spectropolarimetry of sn 2009ip: direct evidence for  aspherical circumstellar material	we present spectropolarimetry of sn 2009ip throughout the evolution of its2012 explosion. during the initial 2012a phase, when the source spectrumexhibits broad p-cygni lines, we measure a v-band polarization of p~0.9% at aposition angle of ~166 deg, indicating substantial asphericity for the 2012aoutflow. near the subsequent peak of the 2012b phase, when the spectrum showssigns of intense interaction with circumstellar material (csm), we measurep~1.7% at a position angle of 72 deg, indicating a separate physical componentof polarization, which has a higher degree of asphericity than the 2012aoutflow and an orthogonal axis of symmetry on the sky. around 30 days pastpeak, which is coincident with a bump in the declining light curve, we measurep~0.7% and significant variations in p across some broad lines, particularlyhei/nai. by 60 days past peak the source appears to be approaching a low valueof interstellar polarization (p&lt;0.2%). the results are consistent with ascenario in which a potentially bipolar explosion during 2012a impacts atoroidal distribution of csm, thereby causing the 2012b brightening.orthogonality between the 2012a and 2012b geometries is inconsistent with thehypothesis that the 2012a event launched the csm that was hit 40 days later bymaterial from the 2012b event. rather, the aspherical csm probably has aseparate origin associated with the outbursts of the stellar progenitor duringprior years. previous calculations that assumed spherical symmetry for the csmhave underestimated the required explosion energy, as the results suggest that&lt;10% of the fast sn ejecta participated in strong csm interaction during the2012b phase. in light of the spectropolarimetric results, a kinetic energy of1e51 erg for the ejecta is difficult to avoid, supporting the interpretationthat the 2012 outburst was the result of a core-collapse supernova explosion(abridged)

1512.00733	type ii supernova energetics and comparison of light curves to  shock-cooling models	during the first few days after explosion, type ii supernovae (sne) aredominated by relatively simple physics. theoretical predictions regardingearly-time sn light curves in the ultraviolet (uv) and optical bands are thusquite robust. we present, for the first time, a sample of $57$ $r$-band type iisn light curves that are well monitored during their rise, having $&gt;5$detections during the first 10 days after discovery, and a well-constrainedtime of explosion to within $1-3$ days. we show that the energy per unit mass($e/m$) can be deduced to roughly a factor of five by comparing early-timeoptical data to the model of rabinak &amp; waxman (2011), while the progenitorradius cannot be determined based on $r$-band data alone. we find that type iisn explosion energies span a range of $e/m=(0.2-20)\times 10^{51} \;\rm{erg/(10 m}_\odot$), and have a mean energy per unit mass of $\left\langlee/m \right\rangle = 0.85\times 10^{51} \; \rm{erg/(10 m}_\odot$), corrected formalmquist bias. assuming a small spread in progenitor masses, this indicates alarge intrinsic diversity in explosion energy. moreover, $e/m$ is positivelycorrelated with the amount of $^{56}\rm{ni}$ produced in the explosion, aspredicted by some recent models of core-collapse sne. we further presentseveral empirical correlations. the peak magnitude is correlated with thedecline rate ($\delta m_{15}$), the decline rate is weakly correlated with therise time, and the rise time is not significantly correlated with the peakmagnitude. faster declining sne are more luminous and have longer rise times.this limits the possible power sources for such events.

astro-ph;0001270	helium emission in the type ic sn 1999cq	we present the first unambiguous detection of helium emission lines inspectra of type ic supernovae (sne ic). the presence of he i lines, with fullwidth at half maximum ~ 2000 km/s, and the distinct absence of any otherintermediate-width emission (e.g., halpha), implies that the ejecta of sn ic1999cq are interacting with dense circumstellar material composed of almostpure helium. this strengthens the argument that the progenitors of sne ic arecore-collapse events in stars that have lost both their hydrogen and heliumenvelopes, either through a dense wind or mass-transfer to a companion. in thisway, sn 1999cq is similar to supernovae such as sn 1987k and sn 1993j thathelped firmly establish a physical connection between type ib and type iisupernovae. the light curve of sn 1999cq is very fast, with an extremely rapidrise followed by a quick decline. sn 1999cq is also found to exhibit a highlevel of emission at blue wavelengths (&lt; 5500 a), likely resulting from eitheran unusually large amount of iron and iron-group element emission oruncharacteristically low reddening compared with other sne ic.

astro-ph;0006264	detailed analysis of early to late-time spectra of supernova 1993j	we present a detailed study of line structure in early to late-time spectraof supernova (sn) 1993j. spectra during the nebular phase, but within the firsttwo years after explosion, exhibit small-scale structure in the emission linesof some species, notably oxygen and magnesium, showing that the ejecta of sn1993j are clumpy. on the other hand, a lack of structure in emission lines ofcalcium implies that the source of calcium emission is uniformly distributedthroughout the ejecta. these results are interpreted as evidence that oxygenemission originates in clumpy, newly synthesized material, while calciumemission arises from material pre-existing in the atmosphere of the progenitor.spectra spanning the range 433-2454 days after the explosion show box-likeprofiles for the emission lines, clearly indicating circumstellar interactionin a roughly spherical shell. this is interpreted within the chevalier &amp;fransson (1994) model for sne interacting with mass lost during prior stellarwinds. at very late times, the emission lines have a two-horned profile,implying the formation of a somewhat flattened or disk-like structure that is asignificant source of emission. the very high signal-to-noise ratio spectra areused to demonstrate the potential significance of misinterpretation of telluricabsorption lines in the spectra of bright sne.

astro-ph;0009285	is it round? spectropolarimetry of the type ii-p supernova 1999em	we present the first multi-epoch spectropolarimetry of a type ii plateausupernova (sn ii-p), with optical observations of sn 1999em on days 7, 40, 49,159, and 163 after discovery. these data are used to probe the geometry of theelectron-scattering atmosphere before, during, and after the plateau phase,which ended roughly 90 days after discovery. weak continuum polarization withan unchanging polarization angle (theta ~ 160 deg) is detected at all epochs,with p ~ 0.2% on day 7, p ~ 0.3% on days 40 and 49, and p ~ 0.5% in the finalobservations. distinct polarization modulations across strong line features arepresent on days 40, 49, 159, and 163. uncorrected for interstellar polarization(which is believed to be quite small), polarization peaks are associated withstrong p cygni absorption troughs and nearly complete depolarization is seenacross the h-alpha emission profile. the temporal evolution of the continuumpolarization and sharp changes across lines indicate polarization intrinsic tosn 1999em. when modeled in terms of the oblate, electron-scattering atmospheresof hoeflich, the observed polarization implies anasphericity of at least 7%during the period studied. the temporal polarization increase may indicategreater asphericity deeper into the ejecta. we discuss the implications ofasphericity on the use of type ii-p supernovae as primary extragalacticdistance indicators through the expanding photosphere method (epm). ifasphericity produces directionally dependant flux and peculiar galaxy motionsare characterized by sigma_v_rec = 300 km/s, it is shown that the agreementbetween previous epm measurements of sne ii and distances to the host galaxiespredicted by a linear hubble law restrict mean sn ii asphericity to values lessthan 30% (3-sigma) during the photospheric phase.

astro-ph;0105295	spectropolarimetry of the type ii supernovae 1997ds, 1998a, and 1999gi	we present single-epoch spectropolarimetry of the type ii supernovae (sne ii)1997ds, 1998a, and 1999gi. sn 1997ds and sn 1998a were both observed during theearly photospheric phase, while spectropolarimetry of sn 1999gi was obtainednear the start of the transition to the nebular phase. uncorrected forinterstellar polarization (isp), sn 1997ds is characterized by p_v = 0.85 +/-0.02%, sn 1998a has p_v = 0.24 +/- 0.05%, and sn 1999gi is polarized at p_v =5.72 +/- 0.01%. the low continuum polarization inferred for sn 1997ds and sn1998a and the amplitude of polarization modulations across strong line featuresare consistent with those measured at similar epochs for sn 1987a and the typeii-plateau sn 1999em, and supports the growing consensus that core-collapseevents with hydrogen envelopes substantially intact at the time of explosionare not significantly aspherical during the early photospheric phase.  the spectral shape of the high continuum polarization of sn 1999gi closelyresembles a ``serkowski'' isp curve, and is inconsistent with thewavelength-independent nature of electron scattering expected for an asphericalsn atmosphere. since galactic reddening is minimal along this line-of-sight,the majority of the observed polarization in sn 1999gi is believed to be due toisp of the host galaxy, although significant (up to p = 2%) intrinsicpolarization cannot be ruled out. the potential power of sn spectropolarimetryto study the properties of interstellar dust in external galaxies is describedand applied to the sn 1999gi data, where it is shown that if the polarizationis indeed predominantly interstellar in origin, then r_v = 3.0 +/- 0.2 for thedust along this line-of-sight in ngc 3184.

astro-ph;0107318	the unique type ia supernova 2000cx in ngc 524	we present extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of the typeia supernova (sn ia) 2000cx in the s0 galaxy ngc 524, which reveal it to bepeculiar. photometrically, sn 2000cx is different from all known sne ia, andits light curves cannot be fit well by the fitting techniques currentlyavailable. there is an apparent asymmetry in the $b$-band peak, in which thepremaximum brightening is relatively fast (similar to that of the normal sn1994d), but the postmaximum decline is relatively slow (similar to that of theoverluminous sn 1991t). the color evolution of sn 2000cx is also peculiar: the$(b - v)_0$ color has a unique plateau phase and the $(v - r)_0$ and $(v -i)_0$ colors are very blue.  although the premaximum spectra of sn 2000cx are similar to those of sn1991t-like objects (with weak si ii lines), its overall spectral evolution isquite different. the si ii lines that emerged near maximum $b$-band brightnessstay strong in sn 2000cx until about three weeks past maximum. the change inthe excitation stages of iron-peak elements is slow. both the iron-peak and theintermediate-mass elements are found to be moving at very high expansionvelocities in the ejecta of sn 2000cx.  we discuss theoretical models for sn 2000cx. sn 2000cx may be an overluminousobject like sn 1991t, but with a larger yield of $^{56}$ni and a higher kineticenergy in the ejecta. we also briefly discuss the implications of ourobservations for the luminosity vs. light-curve width relation.

(2001, 2002) in light ofthese results. following the same procedures, but using the new data presentedhere, we arrive at a less restrictive upper mass limit of 15^{+5}_{-3} m_{sun}for the progenitor. the increased upper limit results mainly from the largerdistance derived through the epm than was assumed by the smartt et al.analyses, which relied on less precise (and less recent) distance measurementsto ngc 3184.

astro-ph;0312500	spectropolarimetric observations of supernovae	we briefly review the existing database of supernova spectropolarimetry,concentrating on recent data and on results from our group's research.spectropolarimetry provides the only direct known probe of early-time supernovageometry. to obtain reliable conclusions, however, it is very important tocorrectly account for interstellar polarization. we find that type iinsupernovae (sne iin) tend to be highly polarized, perhaps in part because ofthe interaction of the ejecta with an asymmetric circumstellar medium. incontrast, sne ii-p are not polarized much, at least shortly after theexplosion. at later times, however, there is evidence for increasingpolarization, as one views deeper into the expanding ejecta. moreover,core-collapse sne that have lost part (sn iib) or all (sn ib) of their hydrogen(or even helium; sn ic) layers prior to the explosion tend to show substantialpolarization; thus, the deeper we probe into core-collapse events, the greaterthe asphericity. there is now conclusive evidence that at least some sne ia areintrinsically polarized, although only by a small amount. finally, snspectropolarimetry provides the opportunity to study the fundamental propertiesof the interstellar dust in external galaxies. for example, we have foundevidence for extremely high polarization efficiency for the dust along theline-of-sight to sn 1999gi in ngc 3184.

astro-ph;0405369	the type iin supernova 1994w: evidence for the explosive ejection of a  circumstellar envelope	we present and analyse spectra of the type iin supernova 1994w obtainedbetween 18 and 203 days after explosion. during the luminous phase (first 100d) the line profiles are composed of three major components: (i) narrow p-cygnilines with the absorption minima at -700 km/s; (ii) broad emission lines withbvzi ~4000 km/s; and (iii) broad, smooth wings, most apparent in h-alpha. thesecomponents are identified with an expanding circumstellar (cs) envelope,shocked cool gas in the forward post-shock region, and multiple thomsonscattering in the cs envelope, respectively. the absence of broad p-cygni linesfrom the supernova is the result of the formation of an optically thick, cool,dense shell at the interface of the ejecta and the cs envelope. we model thesupernova deceleration and thomson scattering wings to recover the density,radial extent and thomson optical depth of the cs envelope during the firstmonth. we reproduce the light curve with a hydrodynamical model and find it tobe powered by a combination of internal energy leakage after the explosion ofan extended pre-supernova (~10^15 cm) and luminosity from circumstellarinteraction. we recover the pre-explosion kinematics of the cs envelope: it isclose to homologous expansion with outer velocity ~1100 km/s and a kinematicage of ~1.5 yr. the cs envelope's high mass and kinetic energy, combined withits small age, strongly suggest that the cs envelope was explosively ejectedabout 1.5 yr before the supernova explosion.

astro-ph;0409439	hubble space telescope and ground-based observations of sn 1993j and sn  1998s: cno processing in the progenitors	ground-based and hubble space telescope observations are presented for sn1993j and sn 1998s. sn 1998s shows strong, relatively narrow circumstellaremission lines of n iii-v and c iii-iv, as well as broad lines from the ejecta.both the broad ultraviolet and optical lines in sn 1998s indicate an expansionvelocity of ~7,000 km/s. the broad emission components of ly-alpha and mg iiare strongly asymmetrical after day 72 past the explosion, and differ in shapefrom h-alpha. different models based on dust extinction from dust in the ejectaor shock region, in combination with h-alpha from a circumstellar torus, arediscussed. it is concluded, however, that the double-peaked line profiles aremore likely to arise as a result of optical depth effects in the narrow, cool,dense shell behind the reverse shock, than in a torus-like region. theultraviolet lines of sn 1993j are broad, with a box-like shape, coming from theejecta and a cool dense shell. the shapes of the lines are well fitted with ashell with inner velocity ~7,000 km/s and outer velocity ~10,000 km/s. for bothsn 1993j and sn 1998s a strong nitrogen enrichment is found, with n/c~12.4 insn 1993j and n/c~6.0 in sn 1998s. from a compilation of all supernovae withdetermined cno ratios, we discuss the implications of these observations forthe structure of the progenitors of type ii supernovae.

astro-ph;0411312	photometric typing analyses of three young supernovae with the robotic  palomar 60-inch telescope	we present photometric typing analyses of three young supernovae observedwith the robotic 60-inch telescope at palomar observatory (p60). thisrepresents the first time that such photo-typing has been attempted, in a blindfashion, on newly-discovered supernovae. for one of the target supernovae,sn2004cs, our photometry provided the first constraint on the sn type, which wepredicted would be type ia. to the contrary, however, our subsequent keckspectroscopy shows it to be an unusual type ii supernova. for each of the othertwo supernovae, sn2004dh (type ii) and sn2004dk (type ib), our photo-typingresults are consistent with the known type of the event as determined fromground-based spectroscopy; however, the colors of sn2004dk are also consistentwith a type ic or type ii classification. we discuss our approach to thechallenges of photo-typing - contamination by host galaxy light and the unknownphotometric quality of the data - in the case where it is desirable to completethe analysis with just one night of observations. the growing interest in theproperties and behavior of very young supernovae, and the increased discoveryrate for such events, mean that prompt photo-typing analyses can provide usefulinput to observational campaigns. our results demonstrate the value andfeasibility of such a project for p60, at the same time illustrating its chiefinherent shortcoming: an inability to identify new and unusual events as suchwithout later spectroscopic observations.

astro-ph;0505568	interstellar polarization and the position angle orientations of seyfert  1 galaxies	we comment on recent spectropolarimetric studies that compare the observedpolarization position angles (pas) of seyfert 1 galaxies near h alpha with theobserved orientations of their radio source axes on the sky. for a seyfertgalaxy in which scattering occurs mainly in an equatorial scattering region,one expects the polarization pa to be parallel to the radio axis, while in acase in which light scatters predominantly in the polar regions, the h alphapolarization pa should be perpendicular to the radio axis. in practice, thesecorrelations are difficult to establish because a galactic interstellarpolarization contribution can introduce a significant uncertainty into thepolarization pa determination, even when the magnitude of interstellarpolarization is small. we show how such uncertainties may affect the analysisof pa alignments and present spectropolarimetric observations of a probe staralong the line of sight to the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 871 that allow us to assessthe intrinsic h alpha polarization and pa of mrk 871. these results suggestthat spectropolarimetric observations of such probe stars should form anintegral part of future seyfert galaxy polarization studies.

astro-ph;0506470	evidence for spectropolarimetric diversity in type ia supernovae	we present single-epoch, post-maximum spectropolarimetry of four type iasupernovae (sne ia) that span a range of spectral and photometric properties:sn 2002bf and sn 2004dt exhibit unusually high-velocity (hv) absorption lines.sn 1997dt is probably somewhat subluminous, and sn 2003du is slightlyoverluminous. we detect polarization modulations across strong lines in allfour objects, demonstrating that all are intrinsically polarized. however, thenature and degree of the polarization varies considerably. including all sne iastudied thus far, the following order emerges in terms of increasing strengthof line-polarization features: ordinary/overluminous &lt; subluminous &lt; hv sne ia,with the strength of the line-polarization features increasing from 0.2% in theslightly overluminous sn 2003du to 2% in both of the hv sne ia in our study.the most convincing explanation for the line polarization of all objects ispartial obscuration of the photosphere by clumps of intermediate-mass elements(imes) forged in the explosion; the polarization characteristics of the hv sneia in particular effectively rule out a simple ellipsoidal asphericity as theroot cause of their line polarization. that sne ia are separable into differentgroups based on their spectropolarimetric characteristics may help narrow downprogenitor possibilities and/or explosion physics. in particular, the recentlyproposed gravitationally confined detonation model may provide an attractiveexplanation for many of the observed polarization characteristics of hv sne ia.

astro-ph;0603297	a non-spherical core in the explosion of supernova sn 2004dj	an important and perhaps critical clue to the mechanism driving the explosionof massive stars as supernovae is provided by the accumulating evidence forasymmetry in the explosion. indirect evidence comes from high pulsarvelocities, associations of supernovae with long-soft gamma-ray bursts, andasymmetries in late-time emission-line profiles. spectropolarimetry provides adirect probe of young supernova geometry, with higher polarization generallyindicating a greater departure from spherical symmetry. large polarizationshave been measured for 'stripped-envelope' (that is, type ic) supernovae, whichconfirms their non-spherical morphology; but the explosions of massive starswith intact hydrogen envelopes (type ii-p supernovae) have shown only weakpolarizations at the early times observed. here we report multi-epochspectropolarimetry of a classic type ii-p supernova that reveals the abruptappearance of significant polarization when the inner core is first exposed inthe thinning ejecta (~90 days after explosion). we infer a departure fromspherical symmetry of at least 30 per cent for the inner ejecta. combined withearlier results, this suggests that a strongly non-spherical explosion may be ageneric feature of core-collapse supernovae of all types, where the asphericityin type ii-p supernovae is cloaked at early times by the massive, opaque,hydrogen envelope.

astro-ph;0603535	towards a cosmological hubble diagram for type ii-p supernovae	we present the first high-redshift hubble diagram for type ii-p supernovae(sne ii-p) based upon five events at redshift up to z~0.3. this diagram wasconstructed using photometry from the canada-france-hawaii telescope supernovalegacy survey and absorption line spectroscopy from the keck observatory. themethod used to measure distances to these supernovae is based on recent work byhamuy &amp; pinto (2002) and exploits a correlation between the absolute brightnessof sne ii-p and the expansion velocities derived from the minimum of the fe ii516.9 nm p-cygni feature observed during the plateau phases. we present threerefinements to this method which significantly improve the practicality ofmeasuring the distances of sne ii-p at cosmologically interesting redshifts.these are an extinction correction measurement based on the v-i colors at day50, a cross-correlation measurement for the expansion velocity and the abilityto extrapolate such velocities accurately over almost the entire plateau phase.we apply this revised method to our dataset of high-redshift sne ii-p and findthat the resulting hubble diagram has a scatter of only 0.26 magnitudes, thusdemonstrating the feasibility of measuring the expansion history, with presentfacilities, using a method independent of that based upon supernovae of typeia.

0809.1881	an upper mass limit on a red supergiant progenitor for the type  ii-plateau supernova sn 2006my	we analyze two pre-supernova (sn) and three post-sn high-resolution images ofthe site of the type ii-plateau supernova sn 2006my in an effort to eitherdetect the progenitor star or to constrain its properties. following imageregistration, we find that an isolated stellar object is not detected at thelocation of sn 2006my in either of the two pre-sn images. in the first, ani-band image obtained with the wide-field and planetary camera 2 on board thehubble space telescope, the offset between the sn 2006my location and adetected source ("source 1") is too large: &gt; 0.08", which corresponds to aconfidence level of non-association of 96% from our most liberal estimates ofthe transformation and measurement uncertainties. in the second, a similarlyobtained v-band image, a source is detected ("source 2") that has overlap withthe sn 2006my location but is definitively an extended object. throughartificial star tests carried out on the precise location of sn 2006my in theimages, we derive a 3-sigma upper bound on the luminosity of a red supergiantthat could have remained undetected in our pre-sn images of log l/l_sun = 5.10,which translates to an upper bound on such a star's initial mass of 15 m_sunfrom the stars stellar evolutionary models. although considered unlikely, wecan not rule out the possibility that part of the light comprising source 1,which exhibits a slight extension relative to other point sources in the image,or part of the light contributing to the extended source 2, may be due to theprogenitor of sn 2006my. only additional, high-resolution observations of thesite taken after sn 2006my has faded beyond detection can confirm or rejectthese possibilities.

astro-ph;9908040	evidence for asphericity in the type iin supernova 1998s	we present optical spectropolarimetry obtained at the keck-ii 10-m telescopeon 1998 march 7 ut along with total flux spectra spanning the first 494 daysafter discovery (1998 march 2 ut) of the peculiar type iin supernova (sn)1998s. the sn is found to exhibit a high degree of linear polarization,implying significant asphericity for its continuum-scattering environment.prior to removal of the interstellar polarization, the polarization spectrum ischaracterized by a flat continuum (at p ~ 2%) with distinct changes inpolarization associated with both the broad (fwzi &gt;= 20,000 km/s) and narrow(unresolved, fwhm &lt; 300 km/s) line emission seen in the total flux spectrum.when analyzed in terms of a polarized continuum with unpolarized broad-linerecombination emission, an intrinsic continuum polarization of p ~ 3% results(the highest yet found for a sn), suggesting a global asphericity of &gt;= 45%from the oblate, electron-scattering dominated models of hoflich (1991). thesmooth, blue continuum evident at early times is shown to be inconsistent witha reddened, single-temperature blackbody, instead having a color temperaturethat increases with decreasing wavelength. broad emission-line profiles withdistinct blue and red peaks are seen in the total flux spectra at later times,perhaps suggesting a disk-like or ring-like morphology for the dense (n_e ~10^7 cm^{-3}) circumstellar medium. implications of the circumstellarscattering environment for the spectropolarimetry are discussed, as are theeffects of uncertain removal of interstellar polarization.

0810.4923	improved standardization of type ii-p supernovae: application to an  expanded sample	in the epoch of precise and accurate cosmology, cross-confirmation using avariety of cosmographic methods is paramount to circumvent systematicuncertainties. owing to progenitor histories and explosion physics differingfrom those of type ia sne (sne ia), type ii-plateau supernovae (sne ii-p) areunlikely to be affected by evolution in the same way. based on a new analysisof 17 sne ii-p, and on an improved methodology, we find that sne ii-p are goodstandardizable candles, almost comparable to sne ia. we derive a tight hubblediagram with a dispersion of 10% in distance, using the simple correlationbetween luminosity and photospheric velocity introduced by hamuy &amp; pinto 2002.we show that the descendent method of nugent et al. 2006 can be furthersimplified and that the correction for dust extinction has low statisticalimpact. we find that our sn sample favors, on average, a very steep dust lawwith total to selective extinction r_v&lt;2. such an extinction law has beenrecently inferred for many sne ia. our results indicate that a distancemeasurement can be obtained with a single spectrum of a sn ii-p during theplateau phase combined with sparse photometric measurements.
