0905.1327	the galactic environment of the neviii absorber toward he0226-4110	we report the discovery of a small galaxy system in the vicinity of theneviii absorber at z=0.20701 toward he0226-4110. the galaxy system consists oftwo 0.25 l* disk galaxies and a 0.05 l* galaxy all within \delta v &lt; 300 km/sand rho&lt; 200 h^{-1} physical kpc of the absorber. we consider various scenariosfor the origin of the neviii absorption, including photo-ionized gas from aagn, a starburst driven wind, a hot intragroup medium, hot gas in a galaxyhalo, and a conductive front produced by cool clouds moving at high speedthrough a hot medium. we argue that the conductive front scenario is mostlikely responsible for producing the neviii feature, because it is consistentwith the observed galactic environment around the absorber and because itnaturally explains the multi-phase nature of the gas and the kinematicsignatures of the absorption profiles. although our preferred scenario suggeststhat neviii may not be directly probing the warm-hot intergalactic medium, itdoes imply the existence of an extended hot confining medium around a diskgalaxy that may contain a significant reservoir of baryons in the form of hotgas.

0906.1843	the evolution of active galactic nuclei in clusters of galaxies to  redshift 1.3	we have measured the luminous agn population in a large sample of clusters ofgalaxies and find evidence for a substantial increase in the cluster agnpopulation from z~0.05 to z~1.3. the present sample now includes 32 clusters ofgalaxies, including 15 clusters above z=0.4, which corresponds to a three-foldincrease compared to our previous work at high redshift. at z&lt;0.4 we haveobtained new observations of agn candidates in six additional clusters andfound no new luminous agn in cluster members. our total sample of 17low-redshift clusters contains only two luminous agn, while at high redshiftsthere are 18 such agn, or an average of more than one per cluster. we havecharacterized the evolution of luminous x-ray agn as the fraction of galaxieswith m_r &lt; m_r^*(z)+1 that host agn with rest-frame, hard x-ray [2--10 kev]luminosities l_x,h &gt;= 10^43 \ergs. the agn fraction increases from f_a =0.134^{+0.18}_{-0.087} percent at a median z=0.19 to f_a = 1.00^{+0.29}_{-0.23}percent at a median z=0.72. our best estimate of the evolution is a factor ofeight increase to z=1 and the statistical significance of the increase is3.8sigma. this dramatic evolution is qualitatively similar to the evolution ofthe star-forming galaxy population in clusters known as the butcher-oemlereffect. we discuss the implications of this result for the coevolution of blackholes and galaxies in clusters, the evolution of agn feedback, searches forclusters with the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect, and the possible detection ofenvironment-dependent downsizing.

0911.0392	active galactic nuclei in groups and clusters of galaxies: detection and  host morphology	the incidence and properties of active galactic nuclei (agn) in the field,groups, and clusters can provide new information about how these objects aretriggered and fueled, similar to how these environments have been employed tostudy galaxy evolution. we have obtained new xmm-newton observations of sevenx-ray selected groups and poor clusters with 0.02 &lt; z &lt; 0.06 for comparisonwith previous samples that mostly included rich clusters and optically-selectedgroups. our final sample has ten groups and six clusters in this low-redshiftrange (split at a velocity dispersion of $\sigma = 500$ km/s). we find that thex-ray selected agn fraction increases from $f_a(l_x&gt;10^{41}; m_r&lt;m_r^*+1) =0.047^{+0.023}_{-0.016}$ in clusters to $0.091^{+0.049}_{-0.034}$ for thegroups (85% significance), or a factor of two, for agn above an 0.3-8kev x-rayluminosity of $10^{41}$ erg/s hosted by galaxies more luminous than $m_r^*+1$.the trend is similar, although less significant, for a lower-luminosity hostthreshold of $m_r = -20$ mag. for many of the groups in the sample we have alsoidentified agn via standard emission-line diagnostics and find that these agnare nearly disjoint from the x-ray selected agn. because there are substantialdifferences in the morphological mix of galaxies between groups and clusters,we have also measured the agn fraction for early-type galaxies alone todetermine if the differences are directly due to environment, or indirectly dueto the change in the morphological mix. we find that the agn fraction inearly-type galaxies is also lower in clusters $f_{a,n&gt;2.5}(l_x&gt;10^{41};m_r&lt;m_r^*+1) = 0.048^{+0.028}_{-0.019}$ compared to $0.119^{+0.064}_{-0.044}$for the groups (92% significance), a result consistent with the hypothesis thatthe change in agn fraction is directly connected to environment.

1001.1738	sdss j1254+0846: a binary quasar caught in the act of merging	we present the first luminous, spatially resolved binary quasar that clearlyinhabits an ongoing galaxy merger. sdss j125455.09+084653.9 and sdssj125454.87+084652.1 (sdss j1254+0846 hereafter) are two luminous z=0.44 radioquiet quasars, with a radial velocity difference of just 215 km/s, separated onthe sky by 21 kpc in a disturbed host galaxy merger showing obvious tidaltails. the pair was targeted as part of a complete sample of binary quasarcandidates with small transverse separations drawn from sdss dr6 photometry. wepresent follow-up optical imaging which shows broad, symmetrical tidal armfeatures spanning some 75 kpc at the quasars' redshift. numerical modelingsuggests that the system consists of two massive disk galaxies prograde totheir mutual orbit, caught during the first passage of an active merger. thisdemonstrates rapid black hole growth during the early stages of a mergerbetween galaxies with pre-existing bulges. neither of the two luminous nucleishow significant instrinsic absorption by gas or dust in our optical or x-rayobservations, illustrating that not all merging quasars will be in an obscured,ultraluminous phase. we find that the eddington ratio for the fainter componentb is rather normal, while for the a component l/ledd is quite (&gt;3sigma) highcompared to quasars of similar luminosity and redshift, possibly evidence forstrong merger-triggered accretion. more such mergers should be identifiable athigher redshifts using binary quasars as tracers.

0707.3814	strangulation in galaxy groups	we use a cosmological chemodynamical simulation to study how the groupenvironment impacts the star formation properties of disk galaxies. thesimulated group has a total mass of m~8x10^12 msun and a total x-ray luminosityof l_x~10^41 erg s^-1. our simulation suggests that ram pressure is notsufficient in this group to remove the cold disk gas from a v_rot~150 km s^-1galaxy. however, the majority of the hot gas in the galaxy is stripped over atimescale of approximately 1 gyr. since the cooling of the hot gas componentprovides a source for new cold gas, the stripping of the hot componenteffectively cuts off the supply of cold gas. this in turn leads to a quenchingof star formation. the galaxy maintains the disk component after the cold gasis consumed, which may lead to a galaxy similar to an s0. our self-consistentsimulation suggests that this strangulation mechanism works even in low massgroups, providing an explanation for the lower star formation rates in groupgalaxies relative to galaxies in the field.

1002.2218	a systematic search for x-ray cavities in the hot gas of galaxy groups	we have performed a systematic search for x-ray cavities in the hot gas of 51galaxy groups with chandra archival data. the cavities are identified based ontwo methods: subtracting an elliptical beta model fitted to the x-ray surfacebrightness, and performing unsharp masking. 13 groups in the sample 25% areidentified as clearly containing cavities, with another 13 systems showingtentative evidence for such structures. we find tight correlations between theradial and tangential radii of the cavities, and between their size andprojected distance from the group center, in quantitative agreement with thecase for more massive clusters. this suggests that similar physical processesare responsible for cavity evolution and disruption in systems covering a largerange in total mass. we see no clear association between the detection ofcavities and the current 1.4 ghz radio luminosity of the central brightestgroup galaxy, but there is a clear tendency for systems with a cool core to bemore likely to harbor detectable cavities. to test the efficiency of theadopted cavity detection procedures, we employ a set of mock images designed tomimic typical chandra data of our sample, and find that the model-fittingapproach is generally more reliable than unsharp masking for recovering cavityproperties. finally, we find that the detectability of cavities is stronglyinfluenced by a few factors, particularly the signal-to-noise ratio of thedata, and that the real fraction of x-ray groups with prominent cavities couldbe substantially larger than the 25--50% suggested by our analysis.

1003.0766	the first mid-ir view of the star-forming properties of nearby galaxy  groups	we present the first mid-ir study of galaxy groups in the nearby universebased on spitzer mips observations of a sample of nine redshift-selected groupsfrom the xmm-imacs (xi) project, at z=0.06. we find that on average thestar-forming (sf) galaxy fraction in the groups is about 30% lower than thevalue in the field and 30% higher than in clusters. the sf fractions do notshow any systematic dependence on group velocity dispersion, total stellarmass, or the presence of an x-ray emitting intragroup medium, but a weakanti-correlation is seen between sf fraction and projected galaxy density.however, even in the densest regions, the sf fraction in groups is still higherthan that in cluster outskirts, suggesting that preprocessing of galaxies ingroup environments is not sufficient to explain the much lower sf fraction inclusters. the typical specific star formation rates (sfr/m*) of sf galaxies ingroups are similar to those in the field across a wide range of stellar mass(m*&gt;10^9.6 msun), favoring a quickly acting mechanism that suppresses starformation to explain the overall smaller fraction of sf galaxies in groups. ifgalaxy-galaxy interactions are responsible, then the extremely low starburstgalaxy fraction (&lt;1%) implies a short timescale (~0.1 gyr) for anymerger-induced starburst stage. comparison to two rich clusters shows thatclusters contain a population of massive sf galaxies with very low sfr (14% ofall the galaxies with m*&gt;10^10 msun), possibly as a consequence of ram pressurestripping being less efficient in removing gas from more massive galaxies.

1004.5376	hot gas halos in early-type field galaxies	we use chandra and xmm-newton to study the hot gas content in a sample offield early-type galaxies. we find that the l_x-l_k relationship is steeper forfield galaxies than for comparable galaxies in groups and clusters. the low hotgas content of field galaxies with l_k &lt; l_star suggests that internalprocesses such as supernovae driven winds or agn feedback expel hot gas fromlow mass galaxies. such mechanisms may be less effective in groups and clusterswhere the presence of an intragroup or intracluster medium can confineoutflowing material. in addition, galaxies in groups and clusters may be ableto accrete gas from the ambient medium. while there is a population of l_k &lt;l_star galaxies in groups and clusters that retain hot gas halos, some galaxiesin these rich environments, including brighter galaxies, are largely devoid ofhot gas. in these cases, the hot gas halos have likely been removed via rampressure stripping. this suggests a very complex interplay between theintragroup/intracluster medium and hot gas halos of galaxies in richenvironments with the ambient medium helping to confine or even enhance thehalos in some cases and acting to remove gas in others. in contrast, the hotgas content of more isolated galaxies is largely a function of the mass of thegalaxy, with more massive galaxies able to maintain their halos, while in lowermass systems the hot gas escapes in outflowing winds.

1005.3538	witnessing the formation of a brightest cluster galaxy in a nearby x-ray  cluster	the central dominant galaxies in galaxy clusters constitute the most massiveand luminous galaxies in the universe. despite this, the formation of thesebrightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) and the impact of this on the surroundingcluster environment remain poorly understood. here we present multi-wavelengthobservations of the nearby poor x-ray cluster mz 10451, in which both processescan be studied in unprecedented detail. chandra observations of theintracluster medium (icm) in the cluster core, which harbors two opticallybright early-type galaxies in the process of merging, show that the system hasretained a cool core and a central metal excess. this suggests that anymerger-induced icm heating and mixing remain modest at this stage. tidallystripped stars seen around either galaxy likely represent an emergingintracluster light component, and the central icm abundance enhancement mayhave a prominent contribution from in situ enrichment provided by these stars.the smaller of the merging galaxies shows evidence for having retained a hotgas halo, along with tentative evidence for some obscured star formation,suggesting that not all bcg major mergers at low redshift are completelydissipationless. both galaxies are slightly offset from the peak of the icmemission, with all three lying on an axis that roughly coincides with thelarge-scale elongation of the icm. our data are consistent with a picture inwhich central bcgs are built up by mergers close to the cluster core, bygalaxies infalling on radial orbits aligned with the cosmological filamentsfeeding the cluster.

1006.3757	the type ia supernova rate in redshift 0.5--0.9 galaxy clusters	supernova (sn) rates are potentially powerful diagnostics of metal enrichmentand sn physics, particularly in galaxy clusters with their deep,metal-retaining potentials and relatively simple star-formation histories. wehave carried out a survey for supernovae (sne) in galaxy clusters, at aredshift range 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9, using the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on thehubble space telescope. we reimaged a sample of 15 clusters that werepreviously imaged by acs, thus obtaining two to three epochs per cluster, inwhich we discovered five likely cluster sne, six possible cluster sne ia, twohostless sn candidates, and several background and foreground events. keckspectra of the host galaxies were obtained to establish cluster membership. weconducted detailed efficiency simulations, and measured the stellarluminosities of the clusters using subaru images. we derive a cluster sn rateof 0.35 snub +0.17/-0.12 (statistical) \pm0.13 (classification) \pm0.01(systematic) [where snub = sne (100 yr 10^10 l_b_sun)^-1] and 0.112 snum+0.055/-0.039 (statistical) \pm0.042 (classification) \pm0.005 (systematic)[where snum = sne (100 yr 10^10 m_sun)^-1]. as in previous measurements ofcluster sn rates, the uncertainties are dominated by small-number statistics.the sn rate in this redshift bin is consistent with the sn rate in clusters atlower redshifts (to within the uncertainties), and shows that there is, atmost, only a slight increase of cluster sn rate with increasing redshift. thelow and fairly constant sn ia rate out to z~1 implies that the bulk of the ironmass in clusters was already in place by z~1. the recently observed doubling ofiron abundances in the intracluster medium between z=1 and 0, if real, islikely the result of redistribution of existing iron, rather than newproduction of iron.

1008.5148	discovery of a large-scale galaxy filament near a candidate  intergalactic x-ray absorption system	we present an analysis of the large-scale galaxy distribution around twopossible warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim) absorption systems reported alongthe markarian 421 sightline. using the sloan digital sky survey, we find aprominent galaxy filament at the redshift of the z=0.027 x-ray absorption linesystem. the filament exhibits a width of 3.2 mpc and length of at least 20 mpc,comparable to the size of whim filaments seen in cosmological simulations. noindividual galaxies fall within 350 projected kpc so it is unlikely that theabsorption is associated with gas in a galaxy halo or outflow. another,lower-significance x-ray absorption system was reported in the same chandraspectrum at z=0.011, but the large-scale structure in its vicinity is farweaker and may be a spurious alignment. by searching for similar galaxystructures in 140 random smoothed sdss fields, we estimate a ~5-10% probabilityof the z=0.027 absorber-filament alignment occurring by chance. if these twosystems are indeed physically associated, this would represent the first knowncoincidence between large-scale galaxy structure and a blind x-ray whimdetection.

1011.5509	direct observational evidence for a large transient galaxy population in  groups at 0.85&lt;z&lt;1	(abridged) we introduce our survey of galaxy groups at 0.85&lt;z&lt;1, as anextension of the group environment and evolution collaboration (geec). here wepresent the first results, based on gemini gmos-s nod-and-shuffle spectroscopyof seven galaxy groups selected from spectroscopically confirmed, extended xmmdetections in cosmos. in total we have over 100 confirmed group members, andfour of the groups have &gt;15 members. the dynamical mass estimates are in goodagreement with the masses estimated from the x-ray luminosity, with most of thegroups having 13&lt;log(mdyn/msun)&lt;14. our spectroscopic sample is statisticallycomplete for all galaxies with mstar&gt;1e10.1 msun, and for blue galaxies wesample masses as low as mstar=1e8.8 msun. like lower-redshift groups, thesesystems are dominated by red galaxies, at all stellar masses mstar&gt;1e10.1 msun.few group galaxies inhabit the "blue cloud" that dominates the surroundingfield; instead, we find a large and possibly distinct population of galaxieswith intermediate colours. the "green valley" that exists at low redshift isinstead well-populated in these groups, containing ~30 per cent of galaxies.these do not appear to be exceptionally dusty galaxies, and about half showprominent balmer-absorption lines. furthermore, their hst morphologies appearto be intermediate between those of red-sequence and blue-cloud galaxies of thesame stellar mass. we postulate that these are a transient population,migrating from the blue cloud to the red sequence, with a star formation ratethat declines with an exponential timescale 0.6 gyr&lt; tau &lt; 2 gyr. theirprominence among the group galaxy population, and the marked lack of blue,star-forming galaxies, provides evidence that the group environment eitherdirectly reduces star formation in member galaxies, or at least prevents itsrejuvenation during the normal cycle of galaxy evolution.

1012.2388	the dawn of the red: star formation histories of group galaxies over the  past 5 billion years	we examine the star formation properties of group and field galaxies in twosurveys, the sloan digital sky survey (sdss; at z ~ 0.08) and the groupenvironment and evolution collaboration (geec; at z ~ 0.4). using uv imagingfrom the galex space telescope, along with optical and, for geec, near infraredphotometry, we compare the observed spectral energy distributions to largesuites of stellar population synthesis models. this allows us to accuratelydetermine star formation rates and stellar masses. we find that star forminggalaxies of all environments undergo a systematic lowering of their starformation rate between z=0.4 and z=0.08 regardless of mass. nonetheless, thefraction of passive galaxies is higher in groups than the field at bothredshifts. moreover, the difference between the group and field grows with timeand is mass-dependent, in the sense the the difference is larger at low masses.however, the star formation properties of star forming galaxies, as measured bytheir average specific star formation rates, are consistent within the errorsin the group and field environment at fixed redshift. the evolution of passivefraction in groups between z=0.4 and z=0 is consistent with a simple accretionmodel, in which galaxies are environmentally affected 3 gyrs after falling intoa ~ 10e13 msun group. this long timescale appears to be inconsistent with theneed to transform galaxies quickly enough to ensure that star forming galaxiesappear similar in both the group and field, as observed.

1101.0812	a multi-wavelength study of low redshift clusters of galaxies i.  comparison of x-ray and mid-infrared selected agns	clusters of galaxies have long been used as laboratories for the study ofgalaxy evolution, but despite intense, recent interest in feedback between agnsand their hosts, the impact of environment on these relationships remainspoorly constrained. we present results from a study of agns and their hostgalaxies found in low-redshift galaxy clusters. we fit model spectral energydistributions (seds) to the combined visible and mid-infrared (mir) photometryof cluster members and use these model seds to determine stellar masses andstar-formation rates (sfrs). we identify two populations of agns, the firstbased on their x-ray luminosities (x-ray agns) and the second based on thepresence of a significant agn component in their model seds (ir agns). we findthat the two agn populations are nearly disjoint; only 8 out of 44 agns areidentified with both techniques. we further find that ir agns are hosted bygalaxies with similar masses and sfrs but higher specific sfrs (ssfrs) thanx-ray agn hosts. the relationship between agn accretion and host star-formationin cluster agn hosts shows no significant difference compared to therelationship between field agns and their hosts. the projected radialdistributions of both agn populations are consistent with the distribution ofother cluster members. we argue that the apparent dichotomy between x-ray andir agns can be understood as a combination of differing extinction due to coldgas in the host galaxies of the two classes of agns and the presence of weakstar-formation in x-ray agn hosts.

1201.0783	the carnegie-spitzer-imacs redshift survey of galaxy evolution since  z=1.5: i. description and methodology	we describe the carnegie-spitzer-imacs (csi) survey, a wide-field, near-irselected spectrophotometric redshift survey with the inamori magellan arealcamera and spectrograph (imacs) on magellan-baade. by defining a flux-limitedsample of galaxies in spitzer 3.6micron imaging of swire fields, the csi surveyefficiently traces the stellar mass of average galaxies to z~1.5. this firstpaper provides an overview of the survey selection, observations, processing ofthe photometry and spectrophotometry. we also describe the processing of thedata: new methods of fitting synthetic templates of spectral energydistributions are used to derive redshifts, stellar masses, emission lineluminosities, and coarse information on recent star-formation. our uniquemethodology for analyzing low-dispersion spectra taken with multilayer prismsin imacs, combined with panchromatic photometry from the ultraviolet to the ir,has yielded 37,000 high quality redshifts in our first 5.3 sq.degs of the swirexmm-lss field. we use three different approaches to estimate our redshifterrors and find robust agreement. over the full range of 3.6micron fluxes ofour selection, we find typical uncertainties of sigma_z/(1+z) &lt; 0.015. incomparisons with previously published vvds redshifts, for example, we find ascatter of sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.012 for galaxies at 0.8&lt; z&lt; 1.2. for galaxiesbrighter and fainter than i=23 mag, we find sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.009 andsigma_z/(1+z) = 0.025, respectively. notably, our low-dispersion spectroscopyand analysis yields comparable redshift uncertainties and success rates forboth red and blue galaxies, largely eliminating color-based systematics thatcan seriously bias observed dependencies of galaxy evolution on environment.

1201.1291	hot and cold galactic gas in the ngc 2563 galaxy group	the role of environmentally induced gas stripping in driving galaxy evolutionin groups remains poorly understood. here we present extensive chandra and verylarge array mosaic observations of the hot and cold interstellar medium withinthe members of the nearby, x-ray bright ngc 2563 group, a prime target forstudies of the role of gas stripping and interactions in relatively small hosthalos. our observations cover nearly all group members within a projectedradius of 1.15 mpc (~1.4 r_vir) of the group center, down to a limiting x-rayluminosity and hi mass of 3e39 erg/s and 2e8 m_sun, respectively. the x-raydata are consistent with efficient ram pressure stripping of the hot gas halosof early-type galaxies near the group core, but no x-ray tails are seen and thelimited statistics preclude strong conclusions. the hi results suggest moderatehi mass loss from the group members when compared to similar field galaxies.six of the 20 hi-detected group members show hi evidence of ongoinginteractions with other galaxies or with the intragroup medium. suggestiveevidence is further seen for galaxies with close neighbors in position-velocityspace to show relatively low hi content, consistent with tidal removal of hi.the results thus indicate removal of both hot and cold gas from the groupmembers via a combination of ram pressure stripping and tidal interactions. wealso find that 16 of the 20 hi detections occur on one side of the group,reflecting an unusual morphological segregation whose origin remains unclear.

1201.3676	substructure in the most massive geec groups: field-like populations in  dynamically active groups	the presence of substructure in galaxy groups and clusters is believed to bea sign of recent galaxy accretion and can be used not only to probe theassembly history of these structures, but also the evolution of their membergalaxies. using the dressler-shectman (ds) test, we study substructure in asample of intermediate redshift (z ~ 0.4) galaxy groups from the groupenvironment and evolution collaboration (geec) group catalog. we find that 4 ofthe 15 rich geec groups, with an average velocity dispersion of ~525 km s-1,are identified as having significant substructure. the identified regions oflocalized substructure lie on the group outskirts and in some cases appear tobe infalling. in a comparison of galaxy properties for the members of groupswith and without substructure, we find that the groups with substructure have asignificantly higher fraction of blue and star-forming galaxies and a parentcolour distribution that resembles that of the field population rather than theoverall group population. in addition, we observe correlations between thedetection of substructure and other dynamical measures, such as velocitydistributions and velocity dispersion profiles. based on this analysis, weconclude that some galaxy groups contain significant substructure and thatthese groups have properties and galaxy populations that differ from groupswith no detected substructure. these results indicate that the substructuregalaxies, which lie preferentially on the group outskirts and could beinfalling, do not exhibit signs of environmental effects, since little or nostar-formation quenching is observed in these systems.

0704.3455	the distribution of agn in clusters of galaxies	we present a study of the distribution of agn in clusters of galaxies with auniformly selected, spectroscopically complete sample of 35 agn in eightclusters at z = 0.06 to 0.31. we find that the 12 agn with l_x &gt; 10^42 erg/s ingalaxies more luminous than a rest-frame m_r &lt; -20 mag are more centrallyconcentrated than typical cluster galaxies of this luminosity, although theseagn have comparable velocity and substructure distributions to other clustermembers. in contrast, a larger sample of 30 cluster agn with l_x &gt; 10^41 erg/sdo not show evidence for greater concentration than inactive members, norevidence for a different kinematic or substructure distribution. as we do seeclear differences in the spatial and kinematic distributions of the bluebutcher-oemler and red galaxy populations, any difference in the agn andinactive galaxy population must be less distinct than that between these twopairs of populations. comparison of the agn fraction selected via x-rayemission in this study to similarly-selected agn in the field indicates thatthe agn fraction is not significantly lower in clusters, contrary to agnidentified via visible-wavelength emission lines, but similar to theapproximately constant radio-selected agn fraction in clusters and the field.we also find significant evidence for variation between clusters and explorethe dependence of cluster agn fraction on redshift, velocity dispersion,cluster substructure, and butcher-oemler fraction. while we see weak evidencefor several trends, correlations between these four parameters in our smallsample precludes identification of which one(s) most strongly influence thecluster agn fraction.

1208.1762	the suppression of star formation and the effect of galaxy environment  in low-redshift galaxy groups	understanding the interaction between galaxies and their surroundings iscentral to building a coherent picture of galaxy evolution. here we use galeximaging of a statistically representative sample of 23 galaxy groups at z=0.06to explore how local and global group environment affect the uv properties anddust-corrected star formation rates of their member galaxies. the data providestar formation rates out to beyond 2r_200 in all groups, down to a completenesslimit and limiting galaxy stellar mass of 0.06 m_sun/yr and 10^8 m_sun,respectively. at fixed galaxy stellar mass, we find that the fraction ofstar-forming group members is suppressed relative to the field out to anaverage radius of r ~ 1.5 mpc ~ 2r_200, mirroring results for massive clusters.for the first time we also report a similar suppression of the specific starformation rate within such galaxies, on average by 40% relative to the field,thus directly revealing the impact of the group environment in quenching starformation within infalling galaxies. at fixed galaxy density and stellar mass,this suppression is stronger in more massive groups, implying that both localand global group environment play a role in quenching. the results favor anaverage quenching timescale of at least ~2 gyr and strongly suggest that acombination of tidal interactions and starvation is responsible. despite theirpast and ongoing quenching, galaxy groups with more than four members stillaccount for at least ~25% of the total uv output in the nearby universe.

1209.4080	warm-hot gas in groups and galaxies toward h2356-309	we present a detailed analysis of the galaxy and group distributions aroundthree reported x-ray absorption line systems in the spectrum of the quasarh2356-309. previous studies associated these absorbers with known large-scalegalaxy structures (i.e., walls and filaments) along the line of sight. suchabsorption lines typically trace 10^{5-7} k gas, and may be evidence of theelusive warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim) thought to harbor the bulk of thelow-redshift "missing baryons;" alternatively, they may be linked to individualgalaxies or groups in the filaments. here we combine existing galaxy surveydata with new, multi-object magellan spectroscopy to investigate the detailedgalaxy distribution near each absorber. all of these three absorption systemsare within the projected virial radii of nearby galaxies and/or groups, andcould therefore arise in these virialized structures rather than (or inaddition to) the whim. however, we find no additional galaxies near a fourth"void" absorber recently found in the spectrum, suggesting that this system mayindeed trace gas unassociated with any individual halo. though the number ofknown systems is still small, spatial coincidences suggest that some x-rayabsorbers lie in galaxy and/or group environments, though others could stilltrace the large-scale filamentary whim gas predicted by simulations.

1210.0302	an x-ray detected group of quiescent early-type galaxies at z=1.6 in the  chandra deep field south	(abridged) we report the discovery of an x-ray group of galaxies located at ahigh redshift of z=1.61 in the chandra deep field south. the group is firstidentified as an extended x-ray source. we use a wealth of deepmulti-wavelength data to identify the optical counterpart -- our red sequencefinder detects a significant over-density of galaxies at z~1.6 and thebrightest group galaxy is spectroscopically confirmed at z=1.61. we measure anx-ray luminosity of l_{0.1-2.4 kev}= 1.8\pm0.6 \times 10^{43} erg/s, which thentranslates into a group mass of 3.2\pm0.8 \times 10^{13} m_sun. this is thelowest mass group ever confirmed at z&gt;1.5. the deep optical-nearir images fromcandels reveal that the group exhibits a surprisingly prominent red sequence. adetailed analysis of the spectral energy distributions of the group membercandidates confirms that most of them are indeed passive galaxies. furthermore,their structural parameters measured from the near-ir candels images show thatthey are morphologically early-type. the newly identified group at z=1.61 isdominated by quiescent early-type galaxies and the group appears similar tothose in the local universe. one possible difference is the high fraction ofagn (38^{+23}_{-20}%), which might indicate a role for agn in quenching. but, astatistical sample of high-z groups is needed to draw a general picture ofgroups at this redshift. such a sample will hopefully be available in nearfuture surveys.

1212.1151	intragroup and galaxy-linked diffuse x-ray emission in hickson compact  groups	isolated compact groups of galaxies (cgs) present a range of dynamicalstates, group velocity dispersions, and galaxy morphologies with which to studygalaxy evolution, particularly the properties of gas both within the galaxiesand in the intragroup medium. as part of a large, multiwavelength examinationof cgs, we present an archival study of diffuse x-ray emission in a subset ofnine hickson compact groups observed with the chandra x-ray observatory. wefind that seven of the groups in our sample exhibit detectable diffuseemission. however, unlike large-scale emission in galaxy clusters, the diffusefeatures in the majority of the detected groups are linked to the individualgalaxies, in the form of both plumes and halos likely as a result of starformation or agn activity, as well as in emission from tidal features. unlikeprevious studies from earlier x-ray missions, hcgs 31, 42, 59, and 92 are foundto be consistent with the lx-t relationship from clusters within the errors,while hcgs 16 and 31 are consistent with the cluster lx-sigma relation, thoughthis is likely coincidental given that the hot gas in these two systems islargely due to star formation. we find that lx increases with decreasing grouphi to dynamical-mass ratio with tentative evidence for a dependance in x-rayluminosity on hi morphology whereby systems with intragroup hi indicative ofstrong interactions are considerably more x-ray luminous than passivelyevolving groups. we also find a gap in the lx of groups as a function of thetotal group specific star formation rate. our findings suggest that the hot gasin these groups is not in hydrostatic equilibrium and these systems are notlow-mass analogs of rich groups or clusters, with the possible exception of hcg62.

1302.2562	efficient satellite quenching at z~1 from the geec2 spectroscopic survey  of galaxy groups	we present deep gmos-s spectroscopy for 11 galaxy groups at 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.0, forgalaxies with r_{ab}&lt;24.75. our sample is highly complete (&gt;66%) for eight ofthe eleven groups. using an optical-nir colour-colour diagram, the galaxies inthe sample were separated with a dust insensitive method into three categories:passive (red), star-forming (blue), and intermediate (green). the strongestenvironmental dependence is observed in the fraction of passive galaxies, whichmake up only ~20 per cent of the field in the mass range10^{10.3}&lt;m_{star}/m_\odot&lt;10^{11.0} but are the dominant component of groups.if we assume that the properties of the field are similar to those of the`pre-accreted' population, the environment quenching efficiency (\epsilon_\rho)is defined as the fraction of field galaxies required to be quenched in orderto match the observed red fraction inside groups. the efficiency obtained is~0.4, similar to its value in intermediate-density environments locally. whilegreen (intermediate) galaxies represent ~20 per cent of the star-formingpopulation in both the group and field, at all stellar masses, the average ssfrof the group population is lower by a factor of ~3. the green population doesnot show strong h-delta absorption that is characteristic of starburstgalaxies. finally, the high fraction of passive galaxies in groups, whencombined with satellite accretion models, require that most accreted galaxieshave been affected by their environment. thus, any delay between accretion andthe onset of truncation of star formation (\tau) must be &lt;2 gyr, shorter thanthe 3-7 gyr required to fit data at z=0. the relatively small fraction ofintermediate galaxies requires that the actual quenching process occursquickly, with an exponential decay timescale of \tau_q&lt;1 gyr.

0801.2570	the hot gas halos of galaxies in groups	we use chandra observations of 13 nearby groups of galaxies to investigatethe hot gas content of their member galaxies. we find that a large fraction ofnear-ir bright, early-type galaxies in groups have extended x-ray emission,indicating that they retain significant hot gas halos even in these denseenvironments. in particular, we detect hot gas halos in ~80% of l_k &gt; l_stargalaxies. we do not find a significant difference in the l_k-l_x relation fordetected group and cluster early-type galaxies. however, we detect x-rayemission from a significantly higher fraction of galaxies brighter than l_starin groups compared to clusters, indicating that a larger fraction of galaxiesin clusters experience significant stripping of their hot gas. in addition,group and cluster galaxies appear to be x-ray faint compared to field galaxies,though a chandra based field sample is needed to confirm this result. thenear-ir bright late-types galaxies in clusters and groups appear to follow thel_k-l_x relation for early-type galaxies, while near-ir fainter late-typegalaxies are significantly more x-ray luminous than this relation likely due tostar formation. finally, we find individual examples of ongoing gas strippingof group galaxies. one galaxy shows a 40-50 kpc x-ray tail, and two merginggalaxy systems show tidal bridges/tails of x-ray emission. therefore, strippingof hot galactic gas through both ram pressure and tidal forces does occur ingroups and clusters, but the frequency or efficiency of such events must bemoderate enough to allow hot gas halos in a large fraction of bright galaxiesto survive even in group and cluster cores.

1307.6555	the circular velocity function of group galaxies	a robust prediction of $\lambda{\rm cdm}$ cosmology is the halo circularvelocity function (cvf), a dynamical cousin of the halo mass function. thecorrespondence between theoretical and observed cvfs is uncertain, however:cluster galaxies are reported to exhibit a power-law cvf consistent with$n$-body simulations, but that of the field is distinctly schechter-like,flattened relative to $\lambda{\rm cdm}$ expectations at circular velocities$v_c \lesssim 200\, {\rm km\, s^{-1}}$. groups offer a powerful probe of therole environment plays in this discrepancy as they bridge the field andclusters. here, we construct the cvf for a large, mass- andmultiplicity-complete sample of group galaxies from the sloan digital skysurvey. using independent photometric $v_c$ estimators, we find no transitionfrom a field- to $\lambda{\rm cdm}$-shaped cvf above $v_c = 50\, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ as a function of group halo mass. all groups with $12.4 \lesssim \logm_{\rm halo} / m_{\odot} \lesssim 15.1$ (local group analogs to rich clusters)display similar schechter-like cvfs marginally suppressed at low-$v_c$ comparedto that of the field. conversely, some agreement with $n$-body results emergesfor samples saturated with late-type galaxies, with isolated late-typesdisplaying a cvf similar in shape to $\lambda{\rm cdm}$ predictions. weconclude that the flattening of the low-$v_c$ slope in groups is due to theirdepressed late-type fractions -- environment affecting the cvf only to theextent that it correlates with this quantity -- and that previous clusteranalyses may suffer from interloper contamination. these results serve asuseful benchmarks for cosmological simulations of galaxy formation.

1308.1406	do group dynamics play a role in the evolution of member galaxies?	we examine galaxy groups from the present epoch to z = 1 to explore theimpact of group dynamics on galaxy evolution. we use group catalagues from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss), the group environment and evolutioncollaboration (geec) and the high redshift geec2 sample to study how theobserved member properties depend on galaxy stellar mass, group dynamical massand dynamical state of the host group. we find a strong correlation between thefraction of non-star-forming (quiescent) galaxies and galaxy stellar mass, butdo not detect a significant difference in the quiescent fraction with groupdynamical mass, within our sample halo mass range of 10^13-10^14.5 m_sun, orwith dynamical sate. however, at a redshift of approximately 0.4 we do see someevidence that the quiescent fraction in low mass galaxies (log(m_star/m_sun) &lt;10.5) is lower in groups with substructure. additionally, our results show thatthe fraction of groups with non-gaussian velocity distributions increases withredshift to roughly z = 0.4, while the amount of detected substructure remainsconstant to z = 1. based on these results, we conclude that for massivegalaxies (log(m_star/m_sun_ &gt; 10.5), evolution is most strongly correlated tothe stellar mass of a galaxy with little or no additional effect related toeither the group dynamical mass or dynamical state. for low mass galaxies, wedo see some evidence of a correlation between the quiescent fraction and theamount of detected substructure, highlighting the need to probe further downthe stellar mass function to elucidate the role of the environment in galaxyevolution.

1308.2681	probing the igm-galaxy connection at z&lt;0.5 ii. new insights into the  galaxy environments of ovi absorbers in pks 0405-123	we present new absorption-line analysis and new galaxy survey data obtainedfor the field around pks0405-123 at z=0.57. combining previously known oviabsorbers with new identifications in the higher s/n uv spectra obtained withcos, we have established a sample of 7 ovi absorbers and 12 individualcomponents at z=0.0918-0.495 along the sightline toward pks0405-123. wecomplement the available uv absorption spectra with galaxy survey data thatreach 100% completeness at projected distances rho&lt;200 kpc of the quasarsightline for galaxies as faint as 0.1l* (0.2l*) out to redshifts of z=0.35(z=0.5). the high level of completeness achieved at faint magnitudes by oursurvey reveals that ovi absorbers are closely associated with gas-richenvironments containing at least one low-mass, emission-line galaxy. anintriguing exception is a strong ovi system at z=0.183 that does not have agalaxy found at rho&lt;4 mpc, and our survey rules out the presence of anygalaxies of l&gt;0.04l* at rho&lt;250 kpc and any galaxies of l&gt;0.3l* at rho&lt;1 mpc.we further examine the galactic environments of ovi absorbers and those"lya-only" absorbers with hi column density log n(hi)&gt;13.6 and no detectableovi absorption features. the lya-only absorbers serve as a control sample inseeking the discriminating galactic features that result in the observed oviabsorbing gas at large galactic radii. we find a clear distinction in theradial profiles of mean galaxy surface brightness around different absorbers.specifically, ovi absorbers are found to reside in regions of higher meansurface brightness at rho&lt;500 kpc (+5 mag mpc^-2 relative to the background),while only a mild increase in galaxy surface brightness is seen at small rhoaround lya-only absorbers (+2 mag mpc^-2). the additional insights gained fromour deep galaxy survey demonstrates the need to probe to low luminosities tobetter understand absorbing systems.

1312.4418	star formation and environmental quenching of geec2 group galaxies at  z~1	we present new analysis from the geec2 spectroscopic survey of galaxy groupsat $0.8&lt;z&lt;1$. our previous work revealed an intermediate population between thestar-forming and quiescent sequences and a strong environmental dependence inthe fraction of quiescent galaxies. only $\sim5$ per cent of star-forminggalaxies in both the group and field sample show a significant enhancement instar formation, which suggests that quenching is the primary process in thetransition from the star-forming to the quiescent state. to model theenvironmental quenching scenario, we have tested the use of differentexponential quenching timescales and delays between satellite accretion and theonset of quenching. we find that with no delay, the quenching timescale needsto be long in order to match the observed quiescent fraction, but then thismodel produces too many intermediate galaxies. fixing a delay time of 3 gyr, assuggested from the local universe, produces too few quiescent galaxies. theobserved fractions are best matched with a model that includes a delay that isproportional to the dynamical time and a rapid quenching timescale ($\sim0.25$gyr), but this model also predicts intermediate galaxies h{\delta} strengthhigher than that observed. using stellar synthesis models, we have tested otherscenarios, such as the rejuvenation of star formation in early-type galaxiesand a portion of quenched galaxies possessing residual star formation. ifenvironment quenching plays a role in the geec2 sample, then our work suggeststhat only a fraction of intermediate galaxies may be undergoing this transitionand that quenching occurs quite rapidly in satellite galaxies ($\lesssim0.25$gyr).

1405.6718	some like it hot: linking diffuse x-ray luminosity, baryonic mass, and  star formation rate in compact groups of galaxies	we present an analysis of the diffuse x-ray emission in 19 compact groups ofgalaxies (cgs) observed with chandra. the hottest, most x-ray luminous cgsagree well with the galaxy cluster x-ray scaling relations in $l_x-t$ and$l_x-\sigma$, even in cgs where the hot gas is associated with only thebrightest galaxy. using spitzer photometry, we compute stellar masses andclassify hcgs 19, 22, 40, and 42 and rscgs 32, 44, and 86 as fossil groupsusing a new definition for fossil systems that includes a broader range ofmasses. we find that cgs with total stellar and hi masses $\gtrsim10^{11.3}$m$_\odot$ are often x-ray luminous, while lower-mass cgs only sometimes exhibitfaint, localized x-ray emission. additionally, we compare the diffuse x-rayluminosity against both the total uv and 24 $\mu$m star formation rates of eachcg and optical colors of the most massive galaxy in each of the cgs. the mostx-ray luminous cgs have the lowest star formation rates, likely because thereis no cold gas available for star formation, either because the majority of thebaryons in these cgs are in stars or the x-ray halo, or due to gas strippingfrom the galaxies in cgs with hot halos. finally, the optical colors that tracerecent star formation histories of the most massive group galaxies do notcorrelate with the x-ray luminosities of the cgs, indicating that perhaps thecurrent state of the x-ray halos is independent of the recent history ofstellar mass assembly in the most massive galaxies.

0804.2693	evolution in the disks and bulges of group galaxies since z=0.4	we present quantitative morphology measurements of a sample of opticallyselected group galaxies at 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.55 using the hubble space telescope(hst) advanced camera for surveys (acs) and the gim2d surfacebrightness--fitting software package. the group sample is derived from thecanadian network for observational cosmology field redshift survey (cnoc2) andfollow-up magellan spectroscopy. we compare these measurements to a similarlyselected group sample from the millennium galaxy catalogue (mgc) at 0.05 &lt; z &lt;0.12. we find that, at both epochs, the group and field fractional bulgeluminosity (b/t) distributions differ significantly, with the dominantdifference being a deficit of disk--dominated (b/t &lt; 0.2) galaxies in the groupsamples. at fixed luminosity, z=0.4 groups have ~ 5.5 +/- 2 % fewerdisk--dominated galaxies than the field, while by z=0.1 this difference hasincreased to ~ 19 +/- 6 %. despite the morphological evolution we see noevidence that the group environment is actively perturbing or otherwiseaffecting the entire existing disk population. at both redshifts, the disks ofgroup galaxies have similar scaling relations and show similar medianasymmetries as the disks of field galaxies. we do find evidence that thefraction of highly asymmetric, bulge--dominated galaxies is 6 +/- 3 % higher ingroups than in the field, suggesting there may be enhanced merging in groupenvironments. we replicate our group samples at z=0.4 and z=0 using thesemi-analytic galaxy catalogues of bower et al (2006). this model accuratelyreproduces the b/t distributions of the group and field at z=0.1. however, themodel does not reproduce our finding that the deficit of disks in groups hasincreased significantly since z=0.4.

1503.04199	on the possible environmental effect in distributing heavy elements  beyond individual gaseous halos	we present a study of extended galaxy halo gas through hi and ovi absorptionover two decades in projected distance at $z\approx0.2$. the study is based ona sample of $95$ galaxies from a highly complete ($ &gt; 80\%$) survey of faintgalaxies ($l &gt; 0.1l_*$) with archival quasar absorption spectra and $53$galaxies from the literature. a clear anti-correlation is found between hi(ovi) column density and virial radius normalized projected distance, $d/r_{\rmh}$. strong hi (ovi) absorption systems with column densities greater than$10^{14.0}$ ($10^{13.5}$) cm$^{-2}$ are found for $48$ of $54$ ($36$ of $42$)galaxies at $d &lt; \,r_{\rm h}$ indicating a mean covering fraction of$\langle\kappa_{\rm hi}\rangle=0.89$ ($\langle\kappa_{\rm ovi}\rangle=0.86$).ovi absorbers are found at $d\approx r_{\rm h}$, beyond the extent observed forlower ionization species. at $d/r_{\rm h}=1-3$ strong hi (ovi) absorptionsystems are found for only $7$ of $43$ ($5$ of $34$) galaxies($\langle\kappa_{\rm hi}\rangle=0.16$ and $\langle\kappa_{\rmovi}\rangle=0.15$). beyond $d=3\,r_{\rm h}$, the hi and ovi covering fractionsdecrease to levels consistent with coincidental systems. the high completenessof the galaxy survey enables an investigation of environmental dependence ofextended gas properties. galaxies with nearby neighbors exhibit a modestincrease in ovi covering fraction at $d&gt;r_{\rm h}$ compared to isolatedgalaxies ($\kappa_{\rm ovi}\approx0.13$ versus $0.04$) but no excess hiabsorption. these findings suggest that environmental effects play a role indistributing heavy elements beyond the enriched gaseous halos of individualgalaxies. finally, we find that differential hi and ovi absorption betweenearly- and late-type galaxies continues from $d &lt; r_{\rm h}$ to$d\approx3\,r_{\rm h}$.

1505.07838	on the origin of excess cool gas in quasar host halos	previous observations of quasar host halos at z=2 have uncovered largequantities of cool gas that exceed what is found around inactive galaxies ofboth lower and higher masses. to better understand the source of this excesscool gas, we compiled an exhaustive sample of 195 quasars at z=1 withconstraints on chemically enriched, cool gas traced by mgii absorption inbackground quasar spectra from the sloan digital sky survey. this quasar samplespans a broad range of luminosities from lbol=10^44.4 to 10^46.8 erg/s andallows an investigation of whether halo gas properties are connected withquasar properties. we find a strong correlation between luminosity and cool gascovering fraction. in particular, low-luminosity quasars exhibit a mean gascovering fraction comparable to inactive galaxies of similar masses, but moreluminous quasars exhibit excess cool gas approaching what is reportedpreviously at z=2. moreover, 30-40% of the mgii absorption occurs at radialvelocities of |v|&gt;300 km/s from the quasar, inconsistent with gas bound to atypical quasar host halo. the large velocity offsets and observed luminositydependence of the cool gas near quasars can be explained if the gas arisesfrom: (1) neighboring halos correlated through large-scale structure at mpcscales, (2) feedback from luminous quasars, or (3) debris from the mergersthought to trigger luminous quasars. the first of these scenarios is in tensionwith the lack of correlation between quasar luminosity and clustering while thelatter two make distinct predictions that can be tested with additionalobservations.

1511.07344	evidence for a change in the dominant satellite galaxy quenching  mechanism at z=1	we present an analysis of galaxies in groups and clusters at $0.8&lt;z&lt;1.2$,from the gclass and geec2 spectroscopic surveys. we compute a "conversionfraction" $f_{\rm convert}$ that represents the fraction of galaxies that wereprematurely quenched by their environment. for massive galaxies, $m_{\rmstar}&gt;10^{10.3}m_\odot$, we find $f_{\rm convert}\sim 0.4$ in the groups and$\sim 0.6$ in the clusters, similar to comparable measurements at $z=0$. thismeans the time between first accretion into a more massive halo and final starformation quenching is $t_p\sim 2$ gyr. this is substantially longer than theestimated time required for a galaxy's star formation rate to become zero onceit starts to decline, suggesting there is a long delay time during which littledifferential evolution occurs. in contrast with local observations we findevidence that this delay timescale may depend on stellar mass, with $t_p$approaching $t_{\rm hubble}$ for $m_{\rm star}\sim 10^{9.5}m_\odot$. the resultsuggests that the delay time must not only be much shorter than it is today,but may also depend on stellar mass in a way that is not consistent with asimple evolution in proportion to the dynamical time. instead, we find the dataare well-matched by a model in which the decline in star formation is due to"overconsumption", the exhaustion of a gas reservoir through star formation andexpulsion via modest outflows in the absence of cosmological accretion.dynamical gas removal processes, which are likely dominant in quenching newlyaccreted satellites today, may play only a secondary role at $z=1$.

astro-ph;0001495	the properties of poor groups of galaxies: iii. the galaxy luminosity  function	we obtain r-band photometry for galaxies in six nearby poor groups for whichwe have spectroscopic data, including 328 new galaxy velocities. for the fivegroups with luminous x-ray halos, the composite group galaxy luminosityfunction (glf) is fit adequately by a schechter function with mstar = -21.6 +/-0.4 + 5log h and alpha = -1.3 +/- 0.1. we also find that (1) the ratio ofdwarfs to giants is significantly larger for the five groups with luminousx-ray halos than for the one marginally x-ray detected group, (2) the compositeglf for the luminous x-ray groups is consistent in shape with that for richclusters, (3) the composite group glf rises more steeply at the faint end thanthat of the field, (4) the shape difference between the field and compositegroup glf's results mostly from the population of non-emission line galaxies,whose dwarf-to-giant ratio is larger in the denser group environment than inthe field, and (5) the non-emission line dwarfs are more concentrated about thegroup center than the non-emission line giants. this last result indicates thatthe dwarfs and giants occupy different orbits (i.e., have not mixed completely)and suggests that the populations formed at a different times. our results showthat the shape of the glf varies with environment and that this variation isdue primarily to an increase in the dwarf-to-giant ratio of quiescent galaxiesin higher density regions, at least up to the densities characteristic of x-rayluminous poor groups. this behavior suggests that, in some environments, dwarfsare more biased than giants with respect to dark matter. this trend conflictswith the prediction of standard biased galaxy formation models.

astro-ph;0010534	the optical and near-infrared morphologies of isolated early type  galaxies	in order to study early type galaxies in their simplest environments, we haveconstructed a well-defined sample of 30 isolated galaxies. the sample containsall rc3 early-type galaxies with no other cataloged galaxy with known redshiftlying within a projected radius of 1 (h_100)^{-1} mpc and =/- 1000 km/s (wherewe use the recessional velocities in the rc3). we have obtained optical andnear-infrared images of 23 of the galaxies and of a comparison sample of 13early-type galaxies in x-ray detected poor groups of galaxies. we have appliedthe techniques of unsharp masking, galaxy model division, and color maps tosearch for morphological features that might provide clues to the evolution ofthese galaxies. evidence for dust features is found in approximately 75% ofboth the isolated and group galaxies (17 of 22 and 9 of 12, respectively).however, shells or tidal features are much more prevalent in our isolatedsample than in our group sample (9 of 22 or 41% versus 1 of 12 or 8%,respectively). the isolation and colors of these shell galaxies make itunlikely that tidal interactions or asymmetric star formation are the causes ofsuch features. one model that is not ruled out is that mergers produce theshells. if shells and dust are both merger signatures, the absence of shells ingroup ellipticals implies that shells: 1) form more easily, 2) are younger,and/or 3) are longer-lived in isolated environments.

astro-ph;0208017	an unexpectedly high agn fraction in red cluster galaxies	as part of a program to study the evolution of active galactic nuclei (agn)in clusters of galaxies, we present our results for abell 2104. a deep chandraobservation of this massive, z = 0.154 cluster reveals a significant x-raypoint source excess over the expectations of blank fields, including eightx-ray counterparts with r&lt;20 mag. our spectroscopy shows that all six x-raysources associated with red counterparts are cluster members and their x-rayproperties are consistent with all of them being agn. only one of the six hasthe emission lines characteristic of optically selected agn; the remaining fivewould not have been classified as agn based on their optical spectra. thissuggests the existence of a large population of obscured, or at least opticallyunremarkable, agn in clusters of galaxies. these six sources correspond to alower limit of ~5% of the agn fraction in cluster galaxies with r&lt;20 mag(rest-frame m_v = -19.5 mag) and is comparable to the blue galaxy fraction inthe cluster. such an obscured agn population in clusters of galaxies has manyimplications for cluster galaxy evolution, the hidden growth of their central,supermassive black holes, estimates of the star formation rate at infrared andradio wavelengths, and the observed variance in the hard x-ray background.

astro-ph;0212391	circumnuclear dust in nearby active and inactive galaxies. ii. bars,  nuclear spirals, and the fueling of active galactic nuclei	(abridged) we present a detailed study of the relation between circumnucleardust morphology, host galaxy properties, and nuclear activity in nearbygalaxies. we use our sample of 123 nearby galaxies with visible--near-infraredcolormaps from the hubble space telescope to create well-matched, "paired"samples of 28 active and 28 inactive galaxies, as well as 19 barred and 19unbarred galaxies, that have the same host galaxy properties. comparison of thebarred and unbarred galaxies shows that grand design nuclear dust spirals areonly found in galaxies with a large-scale bar. tightly wound nuclear dustspirals, in contrast, show a strong tendency to avoid galaxies with large-scalebars. comparison of the agn and inactive samples shows that nuclear dustspirals, which may trace shocks and angular momentum dissipation in the ism,occur with comparable frequency in both active and inactive galaxies. the onlydifference between the active and inactive galaxies is that several inactivegalaxies appear to completely lack dust structure in their circumnuclearregion, while none of the agn lack this structure. the comparable frequency ofnuclear spirals in active and inactive galaxies, combined with previous workthat finds no significant differences in the frequency of bars or interactionsbetween well-matched active and inactive galaxies, suggests that no universalfueling mechanism for low-luminosity agn operates at spatial scales greaterthan ~100 pc radius from the galactic nuclei. the similarities instead suggestthat the lifetime of nuclear activity is less than the characteristic inflowtime from these spatial scales. an order-of-magnitude estimate of this inflowtime is the dynamical timescale. this sets an upper limit of several millionyears to the lifetime of an individual episode of nuclear activity.

(2) a maximum-likelihood analysis shows that lya absorbers of logn(hi) &lt; 13.6 are consistent with being more randomly distributed with respectto known galaxies. finally, (3) we find based on this single sightline that theamplitude of xi_{ga} does not depend sensitively on n(hi) for strong absorbersof log n(hi) &gt;= 13.6.

astro-ph;0604549	gas stripping in galaxy groups - the case of the starburst spiral ngc  2276	ram pressure stripping of galactic gas is generally assumed to be inefficientin galaxy groups due to the relatively low density of the intragroup medium andthe small velocity dispersions of groups. to test this assumption, we obtainedchandra x-ray data of the starbursting spiral ngc 2276 in the ngc 2300 group ofgalaxies, a candidate for a strong galaxy interaction with hot intragroup gas.the data reveal a shock-like feature along the western edge of the galaxy and alow-surface-brightness tail extending to the east, similar to the morphologyseen in other wavebands. spatially resolved spectroscopy shows that the dataare consistent with intragroup gas being pressurized at the leading westernedge of ngc 2276 due to the galaxy moving supersonically through the intragroupmedium at a velocity ~850 km/s. detailed modelling of the gravitationalpotential of ngc 2276 shows that the resulting ram-pressure could significantlyaffect the morphology of the outer gas disc but is probably insufficient tostrip large amounts of cold gas from the disc. we estimate the mass loss ratesdue to turbulent viscous stripping and starburst outflows being swept back byram pressure, showing that both mechanisms could plausibly explain the presenceof the x-ray tail. comparison to existing hi measurements shows that most ofthe gas escaping the galaxy is in a hot phase. with a total mass loss rate ofroughly 5 m_sun/yr, the galaxy could be losing its entire present hi supplywithin a gyr. this demonstrates that the removal of galactic gas throughinteractions with a hot intragroup medium can occur rapidly enough to transformthe morphology of galaxies in groups. implications of this for galaxy evolutionin groups and clusters are briefly discussed.

astro-ph;0610839	the stellar mass content of distant galaxy groups	we have obtained near-infrared imaging of 58 galaxy groups, in the redshiftrange 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.6, from the william herschel telescope and from the spitzer iracdata archive. the groups are selected from the cnoc2 redshift survey, withadditional spectroscopy from the baade telescope (magellan). our group samplesare statistically complete to k(vega}=17.7 (ingrid) and [3.6](ab)=19.9 (irac).  from these data we construct near-infrared luminosity functions, for groupsin bins of velocity dispersion, up to 800 km/s, and redshift. the total amountof near-infrared luminosity per group is compared with the dynamical mass,estimated from the velocity dispersion, to compute the mass-to-light ratio,m/lk. we find that the m/lk values in these groups are in good agreement withthose of their statistical descendants at z=0, with no evidence for evolutionbeyond that expected for a passively evolving population. there is a trend ofm/lk with group mass, which increases from m/lk~10 for groups with sigma&lt;250km/s to m/lk~100 for sigma=425-800 km/s. this trend is weaker, but stillpresent, if we estimate the total mass from weak lensing measurements. in termsof stellar mass, stars make up ~2 per cent of the mass in the smallest groups,and ~1 per cent in the most massive groups. we also use the near-infrared datato consider the correlations between stellar populations and stellar masses,for group and field galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.6. we find that fewer group galaxiesshow strong [oii] emission compared with field galaxies of the same stellarmass and at the same redshift. we conclude that most of the stellar mass inthese groups was already in place by z~0.4, with little environment-drivenevolution to the present day.

astro-ph;0611001	the evolution of galaxies in x-ray luminous groups	we investigate the galaxy populations in seven x-ray selected,intermediate-redshift groups (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6). overall, the galaxy populations inthese systems are similar to those in clusters at the same redshift; they havelarge fractions of early-type galaxies (f_e~70%) and small fractions ofgalaxies with significant star formation (f_[oii]~30%). we do not observe astrong evolution in the galaxy populations from those seen in x-ray luminousgroups at low-redshift. both f_e and f_[oii] are correlated with radius but donot reach the field value out to ~r_500. however, we find significant variationin the galaxy populations between groups with some groups having field-likepopulations. comparisons between the morphological and spectral properties ofgroup galaxies reveal both gas-poor mergers and a population of passivespirals. unlike low-redshift, x-ray emitting groups, in some of these groupsthe brightest galaxy does not lie at the center of the x-ray emission, and inseveral of the groups that do have a central bgg, the bgg has multiplecomponents. these groups appear to represent a range of evolutionary stages inthe formation of the bgg. some groups have relatively large central galaxydensities, and one group contains a string of seven bright galaxies within aradius of 200 kpc that have a lower velocity dispersion than the rest of thesystem. none of the central galaxies, including those with multiple components,have significant [oii] emission. these observations support a scenario in whichbggs are formed relatively late through gas-poor mergers.

astro-ph;0611635	differences in the agn populations of groups and clusters: clues to agn  evolution	we combine optical and x-ray data for eight low redshift ($z\sim 0.06$) poorgroups of galaxies from the {\it xi}({\it xmm/imacs}) groups project to studythe agn population in the group environment. among $\sim 140$ group members, weidentify five agn based on their optical emission lines. none of theseoptically-selected agn are detected by {\it xmm-newton}. one additional agn isdiscovered in the {\it xmm-newton} observations. this x-ray detected agn, whichhas no obvious agn emission line signatures in its optical spectrum, is amember of the only x-ray luminous group in our sample. the lack of asignificant population of x-ray bright, but optically dull agn among lessdynamically evolved groups is in stark contrast to the large fraction of suchobjects in rich clusters of galaxies (martini et al. 2006). we suggest thisresult can be explained by a physical scenario for agn accretion evolution: agnactivity is initially triggered by galaxy merging, leading to a high accretionrate and an optically dominant phase (via thin disk accretion). as theaccretion rate drops in time, the agn gradually enters an x-ray dominantlow-accretion phase (via a radiative inefficient accretion flow). in thispicture, optical- and x-ray-selected agn are the same population ofsupermassive black holes observed at different epochs. within the context ofthis scenario, the majority of agn in poor groups are in the high-accretionoptically dominant phase, while the agn population in rich clusters is mostlyin the low-accretion x-ray dominant phase.

astro-ph;0611858	the two-dimensional xmm-newton group survey: z&lt;0.012 groups	we present the results of the 2-dimensional xmm-newton group survey (2dxgs),an archival study of nearby galaxy groups. in this paper we consider elevennearby systems (z&lt;0.012) in mulchaey et al. (2003), which span a broad range inx-ray luminosity from 10^40 to 10^43 ergs/s. we measure the iron abundance andtemperature distribution in these systems and derive pressure and entropy maps.we find statistically significant evidence for structure in the entropy andpressure of the gas component of seven groups on the 10-20% level. thexmm-newton data for the three groups with best statistics also suggest patchymetalicity distributions within the central 20--50 kpc of the brightest groupgalaxy, probed with 2-10 kpc resolution. this provides insights into theprocesses associated with thermalization of the stellar mass loss. analysis ofthe global properties of the groups reveals a subclass of x-ray faint groups,which are characterized by both higher entropy and lower pressure. we suggestthat the merger history of the central elliptical is responsible for both thesource and the observed thermodynamical properties of the hot gas of the x-rayfaint groups.

astro-ph;9705220	gravitational interactions in poor galaxy groups	we report the results of the spatial analysis of deep rosat hri observations,optical imaging and spectroscopy, and high-resolution vla h i and continuumimaging of ngc 1961 and ngc 2276. these spirals were selected as showing someprevious evidence for interaction with a surrounding (hot) diffuse medium. ourresults favor most aspects of these galaxies as being shaped by gravitationalinteractions with companions, rather than the asymmetric pressure from motionthrough an external medium. the old stars follow the asymmetric structures ofyoung stars and ionized gas, which suggests a tidal origin for the lopsidedappearance of these galaxies. in ngc 2276, the h i and star-forming regions arestrongly concentrated along the western edge of the disk. in this case, therosat hri detects the brightest star-forming regions as well as the diffusedisk emission, the most distant galaxy with such a detection. an asymmetricionization gradient in the h ii regions suggests radial movement of gas, whichmight have occurred in either tidal or wind scenarios. the x-ray emission fromngc 1961 is dominated by a point source near the nucleus of the galaxy butextended emission is seen out to a radius of ~0.8'. previous studies of theenrichment of the intragroup medium in the ngc 2300 group indicates thatstripping may be important in this system, but the density of the igm is muchtoo tenuous to effectively strip the gas from the galaxy. however, we proposethat gravitational interactions in the group environment may enhance stripping.during a gravitational encounter the disk of the spiral galaxy may be warped,making ram pressure stripping more efficient than in a quiescent disk.

astro-ph;9708132	the properties of poor groups of galaxies: i. spectroscopic survey and  results	we use multi-fiber spectroscopy of 12 nearby, poor groups of galaxies toaddress whether the groups are bound systems or chance projections of galaxiesalong the line-of-sight, why the members of each group have not already mergedto form a single galaxy, despite the groups' high galaxy densities, shortcrossing times, and likely environments for galaxy-galaxy mergers, and howgalaxies might evolve in these groups, where the collisional effects of theintra-group gas and the tidal influences of the global potential are weakerthan in rich clusters. we conclude the following. (1) the nine groups withdiffuse x-ray emission (cf. paper ii) are bound systems with at least 20-50group members. (2) galaxies in each x-ray-detected group have not all mergedtogether, because a significant fraction of the group mass lies outside of thegalaxies and in a common halo. (3) unlike cd galaxies in some rich clusters,the giant, brightest elliptical in each x-ray group lies in the center of thegroup potential, suggesting that such galaxies may form first in poor groups.(4) in some groups, the fraction and recent star formation histories of theearly types are consistent with those in rich clusters, suggesting that theeffects of cluster environment on these galaxies are relatively unimportant atthe current epoch.

astro-ph;9708139	the properties of poor groups of galaxies: ii. x-ray and optical  comparisons	we use rosat pspc data to study the x-ray properties of a sample of twelvepoor groups that have extensive membership information (zabludoff and mulchaey1997; paper i). diffuse x-ray emission is detected in nine of these groups. inall but one of the x-ray detected groups, the x-ray emission is centered on aluminous elliptical galaxy. fits to the surface brightness profiles of thex-ray emission suggest the presence of two x-ray components in these groups.the first component is centered on the central elliptical galaxy. the locationand extent of this component, combined with its x-ray temperature andluminosity, favor an origin in the interstellar medium of the central galaxy.alternatively, the central component may be the result of a large-scale coolingflow. the second x-ray component is detected out to a radius of at least100-300 kpc. this component follows the same relationships found among thex-ray temperature, x-ray luminosity and optical velocity dispersion of richclusters. this result suggests that the x-ray detected groups are low-massversions of clusters and that the extended gas component can properly be calledthe intragroup medium, in analogy to the intracluster medium in clusters. wealso find a trend for the position angle of the optical light in the centralelliptical galaxy to align with the position angle of the large-scale x-rayemission.

astro-ph;9803096	hierarchical evolution in poor groups of galaxies	to examine the evidence for hierarchical evolution on mass scales of10^13-10^14 solar masses, we apply a statistic that measures correlationsbetween galaxy velocity and projected position (dressler &amp; shectman 1988) todata for six poor groups of galaxies, hcg 42, hcg 62, ngc 533, ngc 2563, ngc5129, and ngc 741. each group has more than 30 identified members (zabludoff &amp;mulchaey 1998ab). the statistic is sensitive to clumps of galaxies on the skywhose mean velocity and velocity dispersion deviate from the kinematics of thegroup as a whole. the kinematics of galaxies within about 0.1 mpc of the groupcenter do not deviate from the global values, supporting our earlier claim thatthe group cores are close to virialization or virialized. we detect significantsubstructure (at 99.9% confidence) in the two groups with the most confirmedmembers, hcg 62 and ngc 741, that is attributable mostly to a subgroup lying0.3-0.4 mpc outside of the core. we conclude that at least some poor groups,like rich clusters, are evolving via the accretion of smaller structures fromthe field. with larger poor group surveys, the incidence of such accretion andthe distribution of subgroup masses are potential constraints of cosmologicalmodels on mass scales of less than 10^13-10^14 solar masses and on physicalscales of less than 0.5 mpc.

astro-ph;9808085	the enrichment history of hot gas in poor galaxy groups	we have analyzed the asca sis and gis data for seventeen groups anddetermined the average temperature and abundance of the hot x-ray emitting gas.for groups with gas temperatures less than 1.5 kev we find that the abundanceis correlated with the gas temperature and luminosity. we have also determinedthe abundance of the alpha-elements and iron independently for those groupswith sufficient counts. we find that for the cool groups (i.e. kt &lt;1.5 kev) theratio of alpha-elements to iron is ~1, about half that seen in clusters.spectral fits with the s, si and fe abundances allowed to vary separatelysuggest the s/fe ratio is similar to that seen in clusters while the si/feratio in groups is half the value determined for richer systems. the mass ofmetals per unit blue luminosity drops rapidly in groups as the temperaturedrops. there are two possible explanations for this decrease. one is that thestar formation in groups is very different from that in rich clusters. theother explanation is that groups lose much of their enriched material via windsduring the early evolution of ellipticals. if the latter is true, we find thatpoor groups will have contributed significantly (roughly 1/3 of the metals) tothe enrichment of the intergalactic medium.

astro-ph;9810458	the isolated elliptical ngc 1132: evidence for a merged group of  galaxies?	numerical simulations predict that some poor groups of galaxies have mergedby the present epoch into giant ellipticals (cf. barnes 1989). to identify thepossible remnants of such mergers, we have compiled a sample of nearby,isolated ellipticals (colbert, mulchaey, &amp; zabludoff 1998). asca observationsof the first galaxy studied, ngc 1132 reveal an x-ray halo that extends out toat least 250 kpc. the temperature, metallicity and luminosity of ngc 1132'sx-ray halo are comparable to those of poor group halos. the total mass inferredfrom the x-ray emission is also like that of an x-ray detected group. opticalimaging uncovers a dwarf galaxy population clustered about ngc 1132 that isconsistent in number density and in projected radial distribution with that ofan x-ray group. the similarities of ngc 1132 to poor groups in both the x-rayband and at the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function, combined with thedeficit of luminous galaxies in the ngc 1132 field, are compatible with themerged group picture. another possibility is that the ngc 1132 system is a`failed' group (i.e., a local overdensity in which other bright galaxies neverformed).

astro-ph;9901236	radio structures of seyfert galaxies. viii. a distance and magnitude  limited sample of early-type galaxies	the vla has been used at 3.6 and 20 cm to image a sample of about 50early-type seyfert galaxies with recessional velocities less than 7,000 km/sand total visual magnitude less than 14.5. the nuclear radio structures ofseyfert 2.0's in the early-type sample tend to be aligned with the [oiii] andhalpha+[nii] structures even though the radio extents are smaller than the[oiii] and halpha+[nii] extents by a factor of ~2-&gt;5. this alignment,previously known for individual seyferts with `linear' radio sources, is hereshown to be characteristic of early-type seyfert galaxies as a class. seyfert2.0's in the early-type sample also show a significant alignment between theemission-line ([oiii] and halpha+[nii]) axes and the major axis of the hostgalaxy. these alignments are consistent with a picture in which the ionized gasrepresents ambient gas predominantly co-planar with the galaxy stellar disk.this ambient gas is ionized by nuclear radiation that may escape preferentiallyalong and around the radio axis, and is compressed in shocks driven by theradio ejecta. we use this alignment to constrain the product of the velocity ofthe radio ejecta and the period of any large angle precession of the inneraccretion disk and jet : v_ejecta x p &gt;= 2 kpc. an investigation of a largersample of seyferts reveals the unexpected result that the seyfert 1's with thelargest radio extent (&gt;= 1.5 kpc) are all of type seyfert 1.2. it appears thatclassification as this type of intermediate seyfert depends on some factorother than the relative orientation of the nuclear obscuring torus to the lineof sight.

astro-ph;9903053	using hubble space telescope imaging of nuclear dust morphology to rule  out bars fueling seyfert nuclei	if agn are powered by the accretion of matter onto massive black holes, howdoes the gas in the host galaxy lose the required angular momentum to approachthe black hole? gas easily transfers angular momentum to stars in strong bars,making them likely candidates. although ground-based searches for bars inactive galaxies using both optical and near infrared surface brightness havenot found any excess of bars relative to quiescent galaxies, the searches havenot been able to rule out small-scale nuclear bars. to look for these nuclearbars we use hst wfpc2-nicmos color maps to search for the straight dust lanesignature of strong bars. of the twelve seyfert galaxies in our sample, onlythree have dust lanes consistent with a strong nuclear bar. therefore, strongnuclear bars cannot be the primary fueling mechanism for seyfert nuclei. we dofind that a majority of the galaxies show an spiral morphology in their dustlanes. these spiral arms may be a possible fueling mechanism.

0706.0209	first measurement of a rapid increase in the agn fraction in  high-redshift clusters of galaxies	we present the first measurement of the agn fraction in high-redshiftclusters of galaxies (z~0.6) with spectroscopy of one cluster and archival datafor three additional clusters. we identify 8 agn in all four of these clustersfrom the chandra data, which are sensitive to agn with hard x-ray (2-10kev)luminosity l_{x,h} &gt; 10^43 erg/s in host galaxies more luminous than a restframe m_r &lt; -20 mag. this stands in sharp contrast to the one agn with l_{x,h}&gt; 10^43 erg/s we discovered in our earlier study of eight low-redshift clusterswith z=0.06-0.31 (average z~0.2). three of the four high-redshift clusterdatasets are sensitive to nearly l_{x,h} &gt; 10^42 erg/s and we identify sevenagn above this luminosity limit, compared to two in eight, low-redshiftclusters. based on membership estimates for each cluster, we determine that theagn fraction at z~0.6 is f_a(l_x&gt;10^42;m_r&lt;-20) = 0.028 (+0.019/-0.012) andf_a(l_x&gt;10^43;m_r&lt;-20) = 0.020 (+0.012/-0.008). these values are approximatelya factor of 20 greater than the agn fractions in lower-redshift (average z~0.2)clusters of galaxies and represent a substantial increase over the factors of1.5 and 3.3 increase, respectively, in the measured space density evolution ofthe hard x-ray luminosity function over this redshift range. potentialsystematic errors would only increase the significance of our result. thecluster agn fraction increases more rapidly with redshift than the field andthe increase in cluster agn indicates the presence of an agn butcher-oemlereffect.
