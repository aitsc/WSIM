0906.3897	precision southern hemisphere vlbi pulsar astrometry ii: measurement of  seven parallaxes	accurate measurement of pulsar distances via astrometry using very longbaseline interferometry enables the improvement of galactic electron densitydistribution models, improving distance estimates for the vast majority ofpulsars for which parallax measurements are unavailable. however, pulsars atsouthern declinations have been under-represented in previous interferometricastrometry campaigns. in order to redress this imbalance, we have conducted atwo-year astrometric campaign targeting eight southern pulsars with theaustralian long baseline array. the program summarized in this paper hasresulted in the measurement of seven new pulsar parallaxes, with success onobjects down to a mean flux density of 0.8 mjy at 1600 mhz. our resultshighlight the substantial uncertainties that remain when utilizing freeelectron density models for individual pulsar distances. until this study, psrj0630-2834 was believed to convert 16% of its spin-down energy into x-rays, butour measured parallax distance of 332 (+52 -40) pc has revised this value to&lt;1%. in contrast, psr j0108-1431 was found to be almost a factor of two moredistant than previously thought, making its conversion of spin-down energy tox-rays the most efficient known (&gt;1%). the 8.5 second radio pulsar j2144-3933was found to be closer than previously predicted, making its apparent 1400 mhzradio luminosity the lowest of any known pulsar (20 microjy kpc^2). we haveexamined the growing population of neutron stars with accurate parallaxes todetermine the effect of distance errors on the underlying neutron star velocitydistribution, and find that typical distance errors may be biasing theestimated mean pulsar velocity upwards by 5%, and are likely to exaggerate thedistribution's high-velocity tail.

0707.2953	multiwavelength monitoring of the unusual ultraluminous supernova sn  1978k in ngc 1313 and the search for an associated gamma-ray burst	we discuss our radio (australia telescope compact array and australian longbaseline array) and x-ray (xmm-newton) monitoring observations of the unusualultraluminous supernova sn 1978k in ngc 1313 at ~25 years after the explosion.sn 1978k is a rare example of a type iin supernova that has remained brightenough to have long-term x-ray and radio observations. the observations probethe dense medium that was ejected by the progenitor star prior to itsexplosion; the star might have been a luminous blue variable. the radio imagingshows that the source remains compact, but it may be marginally resolved. theradio monitoring shows deviations from a smooth decay suggesting thatinhomogeneities are present in the radio emitting region. it appears that amajor change occurred in the mass-loss rate of the progenitor star shortlybefore the supernova event. the x-ray emission between 2000 and 2006 isconsistent with the radiation coming from two shocks. all the x-ray data can befit using the same model (with no systematic evolution or short-termvariability) but this has a surprising requirement: the x-ray emitting regionshave a very large abundance of helium. this would be consistent with the x-rayemitting shocks being located in a helium-rich layer that was ejected by theprogenitor star, or helium-rich material was ejected in the supernovaexplosion. the unusual properties of the supernova motivated a search for anassociated gamma-ray burst (grb). we show that sn 1978k was inside the ~4 sigmaerror box of grb 771029. if this association is correct, the grb wasexceptionally underluminous. however, the quality of the gamma-ray burstlocations at that time was poor, and this is likely just a chance alignment.

1101.5971	prospects for accurate distance measurements of pulsars with the ska:  enabling fundamental physics	parallax measurements of pulsars allow for accurate measurements of theinterstellar electron density and contribute to accurate tests of generalrelativity using binary systems. the square kilometre array (ska) will be anideal instrument for measuring the parallax of pulsars, because it has a veryhigh sensitivity, as well as baselines extending up to several thousands ofkilometres. we performed simulations to estimate the number of pulsars forwhich the parallax can be measured with the ska and the distance to which aparallax can be measured. we compare two different methods. the first methodmeasures the parallax directly by utilising the long baselines of the ska toform high angular resolution images. the second method uses the arrival timesof the radio signals of pulsars to fit a transformation between timecoordinates in the terrestrial frame and the comoving pulsar frame directlyyielding the parallax. we find that with the first method a parallax with anaccuracy of 20% or less can be measured up to a maximum distance of 13 kpc,which would include 9,000 pulsars. by timing pulsars with the most stablearrival times for the radio emission, parallaxes can be measured for about3,600 millisecond pulsars up to a distance of 9 kpc with an accuracy of 20%.

1103.2597	a vlba search for binary black holes in active galactic nuclei with  double-peaked optical emission line spectra	we have examined a subset of 11 active galactic nuclei (agn) drawn from asample of 87 objects that possess double-peaked optical emission line spectra,as put forward by wang et al. (2009a) and are detectable in the first survey atradio wavelengths. the double-peaked nature of the optical emission linespectra has been suggested as evidence for the existence of binary black holesin these agn, although this interpretation is controversial. we make a simplesuggestion, that direct evidence of binary black holes in these objects couldbe searched for in the form of dual sources of compact radio emissionassociated with the agn. to explore this idea, we have used the very longbaseline array to observe these 11 objects from the wang et al. (2009a) sample.of the 11 objects, we detect compact radio emission from two, sdssj151709+335324 and sdss j160024+264035. both objects show single components ofcompact radio emission. the morphology of sdss j151709+335324 is consistentwith a recent comprehensive multi-wavelength study of this object by rosario etal. (2010). assuming that the entire sample consists of binary black holes, wewould expect of order one double radio core to be detected, based on radiowavelength detection rates from first and vlbi surveys. we have not detectedany double cores, thus this work does not substantially support the idea thatagn with double-peaked optical emission lines contain binary black holes.however, the study of larger samples should be undertaken to provide a moresecure statistical result, given the estimated detection rates.

1203.1293	a new layout optimization technique for interferometric arrays, applied  to the mwa	antenna layout is an important design consideration for radio interferometersbecause it determines the quality of the snapshot point spread function (psf,or array beam). this is particularly true for experiments targeting the 21 cmepoch of reionization signal as the quality of the foreground subtractiondepends directly on the spatial dynamic range and thus the smoothness of thebaseline distribution. nearly all sites have constraints on where antennas canbe placed---even at the remote australian location of the mwa (murchisonwidefield array) there are rock outcrops, flood zones, heritages areas,emergency runways and trees. these exclusion areas can introduce spatialstructure into the baseline distribution that enhance the psf sidelobes andreduce the angular dynamic range. in this paper we present a new method ofconstrained antenna placement that reduces the spatial structure in thebaseline distribution. this method not only outperforms random placementalgorithms that avoid exclusion zones, but surprisingly outperforms randomplacement algorithms without constraints to provide what we believe are thesmoothest constrained baseline distributions developed to date. we use our newalgorithm to determine antenna placements for the originally planned mwa, andpresent the antenna locations, baseline distribution, and snapshot psf for thisarray choice.

1312.4827	the unusual multiwavelength properties of the gamma-ray source  pmnj1603-4904	we investigate the nature and classification of pmnj1603-4904, a bright radiosource close to the galactic plane, which is associated with one of thebrightest hard-spectrum gamma-ray sources detected by fermi/lat. it haspreviously been classified as a low-peaked bl lac object based on its broadbandemission and the absence of optical emission lines. optical measurements,however, suffer strongly from extinction and the absence of pronouncedshort-time gamma-ray variability over years of monitoring is unusual for ablazar. we are combining new and archival multiwavelength data in order toreconsider the classification and nature of this unusual gamma-ray source. forthe first time, we study the radio morphology at 8.4ghz and 22.3ghz, and itsspectral properties on milliarcsecond (mas) scales, based on vlbi observationsfrom the tanami program. we combine the resulting images with multiwavelengthdata in the radio, ir, optical/uv, x-ray, and gamma-ray regimes. pmnj1603-4904shows a symmetric brightness distribution at 8.4ghz on mas-scales, with thebrightest, and most compact component in the center of the emission region. themorphology is reminiscent of a compact symmetric object (cso). such objectshave been predicted to produce gamma-ray emission but have not been detected asa class by fermi/lat so far. sparse (u, v)-coverage at 22.3ghz prevents anunambiguous modeling of the source morphology. ir measurements reveal an excessin the spectral energy distribution (sed), which can be modeled with ablackbody with a temperature of about 1600k, and which is usually not presentin blazar seds. the vlbi data and the shape of the sed challenge the currentblazar classification. pmnj1603-4904 seems to be either a highly peculiar bllac object or a misaligned jet source. in the latter case, the intriguing vlbistructure opens room for a possible classification as a gamma-ray bright cso.

1403.6250	observing the sun with the murchison widefield array	the sun has remained a difficult source to image for radio telescopes,especially at the low radio frequencies. its morphologically complex emissionfeatures span a large range of angular scales, emission mechanisms involved andbrightness temperatures. in addition, time and frequency synthesis, the keytool used by most radio interferometers to build up information about thesource being imaged is not effective for solar imaging, because many of thefeatures of interest are short lived and change dramatically over smallfractional bandwidths.  building on the advances in radio frequency technology, digital signalprocessing and computing, the kind of instruments needed to simultaneouslycapture the evolution of solar emission in time, frequency, morphology andpolarization over a large spectral span with the requisite imaging fidelity,and time and frequency resolution have only recently begun to appear. of thisclass of instruments, the murchison widefield array (mwa) is best suited forsolar observations. the mwa has now entered a routine observing phase and herewe present some early examples from mwa observations.

1412.4216	the spectral variability of the ghz-peaked spectrum radio source pks  1718-649 and a comparison of absorption models	using the new wideband capabilities of the australia telescope compact array(atca), we obtain spectra for pks 1718-649, a well-known gigahertz-peakedspectrum radio source. the observations, between approximately 1 and 10 ghzover three epochs spanning approximately 21 months, reveal variability bothabove the spectral peak at ~3 ghz and below the peak. the combination of thelow and high frequency variability cannot be easily explained using a singleabsorption mechanism, such as free-free absorption or synchrotronself-absorption. we find that the pks 1718-649 spectrum and its variability arebest explained by variations in the free-free optical depth on ourline-of-sight to the radio source at low frequencies (below the spectral peak)and the adiabatic expansion of the radio source itself at high frequencies(above the spectral peak). the optical depth variations are found to beplausible when x-ray continuum absorption variability seen in samples of activegalactic nuclei is considered. we find that the cause of the peaked spectrum inpks 1718-649 is most likely due to free-free absorption. in agreement withprevious studies, we find that the spectrum at each epoch of observation isbest fit by a free-free absorption model characterised by a power-lawdistribution of free-free absorbing clouds. this agreement is extended tofrequencies below the 1 ghz lower limit of the atca by considering newobservations with parkes at 725 mhz and 199 mhz observations with the newlyoperational murchison widefield array. these lower frequency observations argueagainst families of absorption models (both free-free and synchrotronself-absorption) that are based on simple homogenous structures.

1501.02922	bighorns - broadband instrument for global hydrogen reionisation signal	the redshifted 21cm line of neutral hydrogen (hi), potentially observable atlow radio frequencies (~50-200 mhz), should be a powerful probe of the physicalconditions of the inter-galactic medium during cosmic dawn and the epoch ofreionisation (eor). the sky-averaged hi signal is expected to be extremely weak(~100 mk) in comparison to the foreground of up to 10000 k at the lowestfrequencies of interest. the detection of such a weak signal requires anextremely stable, well characterised system and a good understanding of theforegrounds. development of a nearly perfectly (~mk accuracy) calibrated totalpower radiometer system is essential for this type of experiment. we presentthe bighorns (broadband instrument for global hydrogen reionisation signal)experiment which was designed and built to detect the sky-averaged hi signalfrom the eor at low radio frequencies. the bighorns system is a mobile totalpower radiometer, which can be deployed in any remote location in order tocollect radio-interference (rfi) free data. the system was deployed in remote,radio quiet locations in western australia and low rfi sky data have beencollected. we present a description of the system, its characteristics, detailsof data analysis and calibration. we have identified multiple challenges toachieving the required measurement precision, which triggered two majorimprovements for the future system.

1501.04393	the multi-frequency parsec-scale structure of pks 2254-367 (ic 1459): a  luminosity-dependent break in morphology for the precursors of radio  galaxies?	we present the first multi-frequency vlbi images of pks 2254-367, agiga-hertz peaked spectrum (gps) radio source hosted by the nearby galaxy ic1459 (d=20.5 mpc). pks 2254-367 and the radio source in ngc 1052 (pks 0238-084;d=17.2 mpc) are the two closest gps radio sources to us, far closer than thenext closest example, pks 1718-649 (d=59 mpc). as such, ic 1459 and ngc 1052offer opportunities to study the details of the pc-scale radio sources as wellas the environments that the radio sources inhabit, across the electromagneticspectrum. given that some models for the origin and evolution of gps radiosources require a strong connection between the radio source morphology and thegaseous nuclear environment, such opportunities for detailed study areimportant. our vlbi images of pks 2254-367 show that the previously identifiedsimilarities between ic 1459 and ngc 1052 continue onto the pc-scale. bothcompact radio sources appear to have symmetric jets of approximately the sameluminosity, much lower than typically noted in compact double gps sources.similarities between pks 2254-367 and ngc 1052, and differences with respect toother gps galaxies, lead us to speculate that a sub-class of gps radio sources,with low luminosity and with jet-dominated morphologies, exists and would belargely absent from radio source surveys with ~1 jy flux density cutoffs. wesuggest that this possible low-luminosity, jet-dominated population of gpssources could be an analog of the fr-i radio galaxies, with the higherluminosity lobe-dominated gps sources being the analog of the fr-ii radiogalaxies.

1502.07596	foregrounds in wide-field redshifted 21 cm power spectra	detection of 21~cm emission of hi from the epoch of reionization, atredshifts z&gt;6, is limited primarily by foreground emission. we investigate thesignatures of wide-field measurements and an all-sky foreground model using thedelay spectrum technique that maps the measurements to foreground objectlocations through signal delays between antenna pairs. we demonstrateinterferometric measurements are inherently sensitive to all scales, includingthe largest angular scales, owing to the nature of wide-field measurements.these wide-field effects are generic to all observations but antenna shapesimpact their amplitudes substantially. a dish-shaped antenna yields the mostdesirable features from a foreground contamination viewpoint, relative to adipole or a phased array. comparing data from recent murchison widefield arrayobservations, we demonstrate that the foreground signatures that have thelargest impact on the hi signal arise from power received far away from theprimary field of view. we identify diffuse emission near the horizon as asignificant contributing factor, even on wide antenna spacings that usuallyrepresent structures on small scales. for signals entering through the primaryfield of view, compact emission dominates the foreground contamination. thesetwo mechanisms imprint a characteristic "pitchfork" signature on the"foreground wedge" in fourier delay space. based on these results, we proposethat selective down-weighting of data based on antenna spacing and time canmitigate foreground contamination substantially by a factor ~100 withnegligible loss of sensitivity.

1510.01515	characterization of a low-frequency radio astronomy prototype array in  western australia	we report characterization results for an engineering prototype of anext-generation low-frequency radio astronomy array. this prototype, which werefer to as the aperture array verification system 0.5 (aavs0.5), is a sparsepseudo-random array of 16 log-periodic antennas designed for 70-450 mhz. it isco-located with the murchison widefield array (mwa) at the murchisonradioastronomy observatory (mro) near the australian square kilometre array(ska) core site. we characterize the aavs0.5 using two methods: in-situ radiointerferometry with astronomical sources and an engineering approach based ondetailed full-wave simulation. in-situ measurement of the small prototype arrayis challenging due to the dominance of the galactic noise and the relativelyweaker calibration sources easily accessible in the southern sky. the mwa, withits 128 "tiles" and up to 3 km baselines, enabled in-situ measurement via radiointerferometry. we present array sensitivity and beam pattern characterizationresults and compare to detailed full-wave simulation. we discuss areas wheredifferences between the two methods exist and offer possibilities forimprovement. our work demonstrates the value of the dual astronomy-simulationapproach in upcoming ska design work.

1511.02985	a search for fast radio bursts at low frequencies with murchison  widefield array high time resolution imaging	we present the results of a pilot study search for fast radio bursts (frbs)using the murchison widefield array (mwa) at low frequencies (139 - 170 mhz).we utilised mwa data obtained in a routine imaging mode from observations wherethe primary target was a field being studied for epoch of reionisationdetection. we formed images with 2 second time resolution and 1.28~mhzfrequency resolution for 10.5 hours of observations, over 400 square degrees ofthe sky. we de-dispersed the dynamic spectrum in each of 372,100 resolutionelements of 2$\times$2 arcmin$^{2}$, between dispersion measures of 170 and675~pc~cm$^{-3}$. based on the event rate calculations in trott, tingay &amp; wayth(2013), which assumes a standard candle luminosity of $8\times10^{37}$js$^{-1}$, we predict that with this choice of observational parameters, themwa should detect ($\sim10$,$\sim2$,$\sim0$) frbs with spectral indicescorresponding to ($-$2, $-$1, 0), based on a 7$\sigma$ detection threshold. wefind no frb candidates above this threshold from our search, placing an eventrate limit of $&lt;700$ above 700 jy.ms per day per sky and providing evidenceagainst spectral indices $\alpha&lt;-1.2$ ($s\propto\nu^{\alpha}$). we compare ourevent rate and spectral index limits with others from the literature. webriefly discuss these limits in light of recent suggestions that supergiantpulses from young neutron stars could explain frbs. we find that suchsupergiant pulses would have to have much flatter spectra between 150 and 1400mhz than have been observed from crab giant pulses to be consistent with thefrb spectral index limit we derive.

1512.08908	scintillation arcs in low-frequency observations of the timing-array  millisecond pulsar j0437-4715	low-frequency observations of pulsars provide a powerful means for probingthe microstructure in the turbulent interstellar medium (ism). here we reporton high-resolution dynamic spectral analysis of our observations of thetiming-array millisecond pulsar j0437-4715 with the murchison widefield array(mwa), enabled by our recently commissioned tied-array beam processing pipelinefor voltage data recorded from the high time resolution mode of the mwa. asecondary spectral analysis reveals faint parabolic arcs, akin to those seen inhigh-frequency observations of pulsars with the green bank and arecibotelescopes. data from parkes observations at a higher frequency of 732 mhzreveal a similar parabolic feature, with a curvature that scales approximatelyas the square of the observing wavelength ($\lambda^2$) to the mwa's frequencyof 192 mhz. our analysis suggests that scattering toward psr j0437-4715predominantly arises from a compact region about 115 pc from the earth, whichmatches well with the expected location of the edge of the local bubble thatenvelopes the local solar neighborhood. as well as demonstrating new andimproved pulsar science capabilities of the mwa, our analysis underscores thepotential of low-frequency pulsar observations for gaining valuable insightsinto the local ism and for characterizing the ism toward timing-array pulsars.

astro-ph;0005227	the chandra x-ray observatory resolves the x-ray morphology and spectra  of a jet in pks 0637-752	the core-dominated radio-loud quasar pks 0637-752 (z = 0.654) was the firstcelestial object observed with the chandra x-ray observatory, offering theearly surprise of the detection of a remarkable x-ray jet. several observationswith a variety of detector configurations contribute to a total exposure timewith the chandra advanced ccd imaging spectrometer (acis; garmire et al. 2000,in preparation) of about 100ks. a spatial analysis of all the available x-raydata, making use of chandra's spatial resolving power of about 0.4 arcsec,reveals a jet that extends about 10 arcsec to the west of the nucleus. at leastfour x-ray knots are resolved along the jet, which contains about 5% of theoverall x-ray luminosity of the source. previous observations of pks 0637-752in the radio band (tingay et al. 1998) had identified a kpc-scale radio jetextending to the west of the quasar. the x-ray and radio jets are similar inshape, intensity distribution, and angular structure out to about 9 arcsec,after which the x-ray brightness decreases more rapidly and the radio jet turnsabruptly to the north. the x-ray luminosity of the total source is log lx ~45.8 erg/s (2 - 10kev), and appears not to have changed since it was observedwith asca in november 1996. we present the results of fitting a variety ofemission models to the observed spectral distribution, comment on thenon-existence of emission lines recently reported in the asca observations ofpks 0637-752, and briefly discuss plausible x-ray emission mechanisms.

astro-ph;0005255	chandra discovery of a 100 kpc x-ray jet in pks 0637--752	the quasar pks 0637-753, the first celestial x-ray target of the chandrax-ray observatory, has revealed asymmetric x-ray structure extending from 3 to12 arcsec west of the quasar, coincident with the inner portion of the jetpreviously detected in a 4.8 ghz radio image (tingay et al. 1998). at aredshift of z=0.651, the jet is the largest (~100 kpc) and most luminous(~10^{44.6} ergs/s) of the few so far detected in x-rays. this letter presentsa high resolution x-ray image of the jet, from 42 ks of data when pks 0637-753was on-axis and acis-s was near the optimum focus. for the inner portion of theradio jet, the x-ray morphology closely matches that of new atca radio imagesat 4.8 and 8.6 ghz. observations of the parsec scale core using the vsop spacevlbi mission show structure aligned with the x-ray jet, placing importantconstraints on the x-ray source models. hst images show that there are threesmall knots coincident with the peak radio and x-ray emission. two of these areresolved, which we use to estimate the sizes of the x-ray and radio knots. theouter portion of the radio jet, and a radio component to the east, show nox-ray emission to a limit of about 100 times lower flux.  the x-ray emission is difficult to explain with models that successfullyaccount for extra-nuclear x-ray/radio structures in other active galaxies. wethink the most plausible is a synchrotron self-compton (ssc) model, but thiswould imply extreme departures from the conventional minimum-energy and/orhomogeneity assumptions. we also rule out synchrotron or thermal bremsstrahlungmodels for the jet x-rays, unless multicomponent or ad hoc geometries areinvoked.

astro-ph;0011145	the 1997 hard state outburst of the x-ray transient gs 1354-64 / bw cir	we present observations of the 1997 outburst of the x-ray transient gs1354-64 (bw cir) at x-ray, optical and, for the first time, radio wavelengths;this includes upper limits to the linear and circular polarisation of the radiodata. the x-ray outburst was unusual in that the source remained in thelow/hard x-ray state throughout; the x-ray peak was also preceded by at leastone optical outburst, suggesting that it was an `outside-in' outburst - similarto those observed in dwarf novae systems, although possibly taking place on aviscous timescale in this case. it therefore indicates that the opticalemission was not dominated by the reprocessing of x-rays but that instead wesee the instability directly. while the radio source was too faint to detectany extended structure, spectral analysis of the radio data and a comparisonwith other similar systems suggests that mass ejections, probably in the formof a jet, took place and that the emitted synchrotron spectrum may haveextended as far as infrared wavelengths. finally, we compare this 1997 outburstof gs 1354-64 with possible previous outbursts and also with other hard stateobjects, both transient and persistent. it appears that a set ofcharacteristics -- such as a weak, flat spectrum radio jet, a mhz qpoincreasing in frequency, a surprisingly high optical:x-ray luminosity ratio andthe observed optical peak preceding the x-ray peak -- may be common to all hardstate x-ray transients.

astro-ph;0102276	the pearson-readhead survey of compact extragalactic radio sources from  space. ii. analysis of source properties	we have performed a multi-dimensional correlation analysis on the observedproperties of a statistically complete core-selected sample of compactradio-loud active galactic nuclei, based on data from the vlbi space observingprogramme (paper i) and previously published studies. our sample is drawn fromthe well-studied pearson-readhead (pr) survey, and is ideally suited forinvestigating the general effects of relativistic beaming in compact radiosources. in addition to confirming many previously known correlations, we havediscovered several new trends that lend additional support to the beamingmodel. these trends suggest that the most highly beamed sources incore-selected samples tend to have a) high optical polarizations; b) largepc/kpc-scale jet misalignments; c) prominent vlbi core components; d)one-sided, core, or halo radio morphology on kiloparsec scales; e) narrowemission line equivalent widths; and f) a strong tendency for intradayvariability at radio wavelengths. we have used higher resolution space andground-based vlbi maps to confirm the bi-modality of the jet misalignmentdistribution for the pr survey, and find that the sources with aligned parsec-and kiloparsec-scale jets generally have arcsecond-scale radio emission on bothsides of the core. the aligned sources also have broader emission line widths.we find evidence that the bl lacertae objects in the pr survey are all highlybeamed, and have very similar properties to the high-optically polarizedquasars, with the exception of smaller redshifts. a cluster analysis on ourdata shows that after partialing out the effects of redshift, the luminositiesof our sample objects in various wave bands are generally well-correlated witheach other, but not with other source properties.

astro-ph;0211451	rapid variability and annual cycles in the characteristic time-scale of  the scintillating source pks 1257-326	rapid radio intra-day variability (idv) has been discovered in the southernquasar pks 1257-326. flux density changes of up to 40% in as little as 45minutes have been observed in this source, making it, along with pks 0405-385and j1819+3845, one of the three most rapid idv sources known. we havemonitored the idv in this source with the australia telescope compact array(atca) at 4.8 and 8.6 ghz over the course of the last year, and find a clearannual cycle in the characteristic time-scale of variability. this annual cycledemonstrates unequivocally that interstellar scintillation is the cause of therapid idv at radio wavelengths observed in this source. we use the observedannual cycle to constrain the velocity of the scattering material, and theangular size of the scintillating component of pks 1257-326. we observe a timedelay, which also shows an annual cycle, between the similar variabilitypatterns at the two frequencies. we suggest that this is caused by a small (~10microarcsecond) offset between the centroids of the 4.8 and 8.6 ghz components,and may be due to opacity effects in the source. the statistical properties ofthe observed scintillation thus enable us to resolve source structure on ascale of ~10 microarcseconds, resolution orders of magnitude higher thancurrent vlbi techniques allow. general implications of scintillation for thephysical properties of sources and the turbulent ism are discussed.
