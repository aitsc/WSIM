0706.1809	the spitzer c2d survey of large, nearby, interstellar clouds. iv. lupus  observed with mips	we present maps of 7.78 square degrees of the lupus molecular cloud complexat 24, 70, and $160\:\mu$m. they were made with the spitzer space telescope'smultiband imaging photometer for spitzer (mips) instrument as part of thespitzer legacy program, ``from molecular cores to planet-forming disks'' (c2d).the maps cover three separate regions in lupus, denoted i, iii, and iv. wediscuss the c2d pipeline and how our data processing differs from it. wecompare source counts in the three regions with two other data sets andpredicted star counts from the wainscoat model. this comparison shows thecontribution from background galaxies in lupus i. we also create two colormagnitude diagrams using the 2mass and mips data. from these results, we canidentify background galaxies and distinguish them from probable young stellarobjects. the sources in our catalogs are classified based on their spectralenergy distribution (sed) from 2mass and spitzer wavelengths to create a sampleof young stellar object candidates. from 2mass data, we create extinction mapsfor each region and note a strong corresponence between the extinction and the$160\:\mu$m emission. the masses we derived in each lupus cloud from ourextinction maps are compared to masses estimated from $^{13}$co and c$^{18}$oand found to be similar to our extinction masses in some regions, butsignificantly different in others. finally, based on our color-magnitudediagrams, we selected 12 of our reddest candidate young stellar objects forindividual discussion. five of the 12 appear to be newly-discovered ysos.

0906.0588	multidimensional chemical modelling, ii. irradiated outflow walls	observations of the high-mass star forming region afgl 2591 reveal a largeabundance of co+, a molecule known to be enhanced by far uv (fuv) and x-rayirradiation. in chemical models assuming a spherically symmetric envelope, thevolume of gas irradiated by protostellar fuv radiation is very small due to thehigh extinction by dust. the abundance of co+ is thus underpredicted by ordersof magnitude. in a more realistic model, fuv photons can escape through anoutflow region and irradiate gas at the border to the envelope. thus, weintroduce the first 2d axi-symmetric chemical model of the envelope of ahigh-mass star forming region to explain the co+ observations as a prototypicalfuv tracer. the model assumes an axi-symmetric power-law density structure witha cavity due to the outflow. the local fuv flux is calculated by a monte carloradiative transfer code taking scattering on dust into account. a grid ofprecalculated chemical abundances, introduced in the first part of this seriesof papers, is used to quickly interpolate chemical abundances. this approachallows to calculate the temperature structure of the fuv heated outflow wallsself-consistently with the chemistry.  synthetic maps of the line flux are calculated using a raytracer code.single-dish and interferometric observations are simulated and the modelresults are compared to published and new jcmt and sma observations. thetwo-dimensional model of afgl 2591 is able to reproduce the jcmt single-dishobservations and also explains the non-detection by the sma. we conclude thatthe observed co+ line flux and its narrow width can be interpreted by emissionfrom the warm and dense outflow walls irradiated by protostellar fuv radiation.

0909.3386	prosac: a submillimeter array survey of low-mass protostars. ii. the  mass evolution of envelopes, disks, and stars from the class 0 through i  stages	the key question about early protostellar evolution is how matter is accretedfrom the large-scale molecular cloud, through the circumstellar disk onto thecentral star. a sample of 20 class 0 and i protostars has been observed incontinuum at (sub)millimeter wavelengths at high angular resolution with thesubmillimeter array. using detailed dust radiative transfer models, we havedeveloped a framework for disentangling the continuum emission from theenvelopes and disks, and from that estimated their masses. for the class isources in the sample, hco+ 3-2 line emission has furthermore been observedwith the submillimeter array. four of these sources show signs of keplerianrotation, constraining the masses of the central stars. both class 0 and iprotostars are surrounded by disks with typical masses of about 0.05 m_sun. noevidence is found for a correlation between the disk mass and evolutionarystage of the young stellar objects. this contrasts the envelope mass, whichdecreases sharply from 1 m_sun in the class 0 stage to &lt;0.1 m_sun in the classi stage. typically, the disks have masses that are 1-10% of the correspondingenvelope masses in the class 0 stage and 20-60% in the class i stage. for theclass i sources for which keplerian rotation is seen, the central stars contain70-98% of the total mass in the star-disk-envelope system, confirming thatthese objects are late in their evolution through the embedded protostellarstages. theoretical models tend to overestimate the disk masses relative to thestellar masses in the late class i stage. the results argue in favor of apicture in which circumstellar disks are formed early during the protostellarevolution and rapidly process material accreted from the larger scale envelopeonto the central star.

1004.0158	grain growth across protoplanetary discs: 10-micron silicate feature  versus millimetre slope	young stars are formed within dusty discs. the grains in the disc areoriginally of the same size as interstellar dust. models predict that thesegrains will grow in size through coagulation. observations of the silicatefeatures at micron wavelengths are consistent with growth to micron sizeswhereas the slope of the sed at longer wavelengths traces growth up to mmsizes. we here look for a correlation between these two grain growthindicators. a large sample of t-tauri and herbig-ae/be stars was observed withthe spitzer space telescope at 5-13 micron; a subsample was observed at mmwavelengths. we complement this subsample with data from the literature tomaximise the overlap between micron and mm observations and search forcorrelations. synthetic spectra are produced to determine which processes mayproduce the dust evolution. dust disc masses in the range &lt;1 to 7 x 10^-4 msunare obtained. most sources have a mm spectral slope consistent with graingrowth. there is a tentative correlation between the 10-micron silicate featureand the mm slope of the sed. the observed sources seem to be grouped perstar-forming region in the micron-vs-mm diagram. the modelling results showthat the 10-micron feature becomes flatter and subsequently the mm slopebecomes shallower. grain size distributions shallower than that of the ismand/or bright central stars are required to explain specific features. settlingof larger grains towards the disc midplane affects the 10-micron feature, buthardly the mm slope. the tentative correlation between the strength of the10-micron feature and the mm slope suggests that the inner and outer discevolve simultaneously. dust with a mass dominated by mm-sized grains isrequired to explain the shallowest mm slopes. other processes besides graingrowth may also be responsible for the removal of small grains.

1004.2443	l1448 irs2e: a candidate first hydrostatic core	intermediate between the prestellar and class 0 protostellar phases, thefirst core is a quasi-equilibrium hydrostatic object with a short lifetime andan extremely low luminosity. recent mhd simulations suggest that the first corecan even drive a molecular outflow before the formation of the second core(i.e., protostar). using the submillimeter array and the spitzer spacetelescope, we present high angular resolution observations towards the embeddeddense core irs2e in l1448. we find that source l1448 irs2e is not visible inthe sensitive spitzer infrared images (at wavelengths from 3.6 to 70 um), andhas weak (sub-)millimeter dust continuum emission. consequently, this sourcehas an extremely low bolometric luminosity (&lt; 0.1 l_sun). infrared and(sub-)millimeter observations clearly show an outflow emanating from thissource; l1448 irs2e represents thus far the lowest luminosity source known tobe driving a molecular outflow. comparisons with prestellar cores and class 0protostars suggest that l1448 irs2e is more evolved than prestellar cores butless evolved than class 0 protostars, i.e., at a stage intermediate betweenprestellar cores and class 0 protostars. all these results are consistent withthe theoretical predictions of the radiative/magneto hydrodynamicalsimulations, making l1448 irs2e the most promising candidate of the firsthydrostatic core revealed so far.

1005.0703	extreme active molecular jets in l1448c	the protostellar jet driven by l1448c was observed in the sio j=8-7 and coj=3-2 lines and 350 ghz dust continuum at ~1" resolution with the submillimeterarray (sma). a narrow jet from the northern source l1448c(n) was observed inthe sio and the high-velocity co. the jet consists of a chain of emission knotswith an inter-knot spacing of ~2" (500 au) and a semi-periodic velocityvariation. the innermost pair of knots, which are significant in the sio mapbut barely seen in the co, are located at ~1" (250 au) from the central source,l1448c(n). since the dynamical time scale for the innermost pair is only ~10yr, sio may have been formed in the protostellar wind through the gas-phasereaction, or been formed on the dust grain and directly released into the gasphase by means of shocks. it is found that the jet is extremely active with amechanical luminosity of ~7 l_sun, which is comparable to the bolometricluminosity of the central source (7.5 l_sun). the mass accretion rate onto theprotostar derived from the mass-loss rate is ~10^{-5} m_sun/yr. such a highmass accretion rate suggests that the mass and the age of the central star are0.03-0.09 m_sun and (4-12)x10^3 yr, respectively, implying that the centralstar is in the very early stage of protostellar evolution. the low-velocity coemission delineates two v-shaped shells with a common apex at l1448c(n). thekinematics of these shells are reproduced by the model of a wide opening anglewind. the co-existence of the highly-collimated jets and the wide-opening angleshells can be explained by the unified x-wind model" in which highly-collimatedjet components correspond to the on-axis density enhancement of thewide-opening angle wind. the co $j$=3--2 map also revealed the second outflowdriven by the southern source l1448c(s) located at ~8.3" (2000 au) froml1448c(n).

1008.1049	the spitzer c2d survey of nearby dense cores. ix. discovery of a very  low luminosity object driving a molecular outflow in the dense core l673-7	we present new infrared, submillimeter, and millimeter observations of thedense core l673-7 and report the discovery of a low-luminosity, embedded class0 protostar driving a molecular outflow. l673-7 is seen in absorption againstthe mid-infrared background in 5.8, 8, and 24 micron spitzer images, allowingfor a derivation of the column density profile and total enclosed mass ofl673-7, independent of dust temperature assumptions. estimates of the core massfrom these absorption profiles range from 0.2-4.5 solar masses. millimetercontinuum emission indicates a mass of about 2 solar masses, both from a directcalculation assuming isothermal dust and from dust radiative transfer modelsconstrained by the millimeter observations. we use dust radiative transfermodels to constrain the internal luminosity of l673-7, defined to be theluminosity of the central source and excluding the luminosity from externalheating, to be 0.01-0.045 solar luminosities, with 0.04 solar luminosities themost likely value. l673-7 is thus classified as a very low luminosity object(vello), and is among the lowest luminosity vellos yet studied. we calculatethe kinematic and dynamic properties of the molecular outflow in the standardmanner, and we show that the expected accretion luminosity based on theseoutflow properties is greater than or equal to 0.36 solar luminosities. thediscrepancy between this expected accretion luminosity and the internalluminosity derived from dust radiative transfer models indicates that thecurrent accretion rate is much lower than the average rate over the lifetime ofthe outflow. although the protostar embedded within l673-7 is consistent withcurrently being substellar, it is unlikely to remain as such given thesubstantial mass reservoir remaining in the core.

0708.2959	molecular line observations of the small protostellar group l1251b	we present molecular line observations of l1251b, a small group of pre- andprotostellar objects, and its immediate environment in the dense c18o corel1251e. these data are complementary to near-infrared, submillimeter andmillimeter continuum observations reported by lee et al. (2006, apj, 648, 491;paper i). the single-dish data of l1251b described here show very complexkinematics including infall, rotation and outflow motions, and theinterferometer data reveal these in greater detail. interferometer data of n2h+1-0 suggest a very rapidly rotating flattened envelope between two youngstellar objects, irs1 and irs2. also, interferometer data of co 2-1 resolve theoutflow associated with l1251b seen in single-dish maps into a few narrow andcompact components. furthermore, the high resolution data support recenttheoretical studies of molecular depletions and enhancements that accompany theformation of protostars within dense cores. beyond l1251b, single-dish data arealso presented of a dense core located ~150" to the east that, in paper i, wasdetected at 850 micron but has no associated point sources at near- andmid-infrared wavelengths. the relative brightness between molecules, which havedifferent chemical timescales, suggests it is less chemically evolved thanl1251b. this core may be a site for future star formation, however, since lineprofiles of hco+, cs, and hcn show asymmetry with a stronger blue peak, whichis interpreted as an infall signature.

1012.5771	first interferometric images of the 36 ghz methanol masers in the dr21  complex	class i methanol masers are believed to be produced in the shock-excitedenvironment around star-forming regions. many authors have argued that theappearance of various subsets of class i masers may be indicative of specificevolutionary stages of star formation or excitation conditions. until recently,however, no major interferometer was capable of imaging the important 36 ghztransition. we report on expanded very large array observations of the 36 ghzmethanol masers and submillimeter array observations of the 229 ghz methanolmasers in dr21(oh), dr21n, and dr21w. the distribution of 36 ghz masers in theoutflow of dr21(oh) is similar to that of the other class i methanoltransitions, with numerous multitransition spatial overlaps. at the site of themain continuum source in dr21(oh), class i masers at 36 and 229 ghz are foundin virtual overlap with class ii 6.7 ghz masers. to the south of the outflow,the 36 ghz masers are scattered over a large region but usually do not appearcoincident with 44 ghz masers. in dr21w we detect an "s-curve" signature instokes v that implies a large value of the magnetic field strength ifinterpreted as due to zeeman splitting, suggesting either that class i masersmay exist at higher densities than previously believed or that the directzeeman interpretation of s-curve stokes v profiles in class i masers may beincorrect. we find a diverse variety of different maser phenomena in thesesources, suggestive of differing physical conditions among them.

1101.1067	the spitzer c2d survey of nearby dense cores xi : infrared and  submillimeter observations of cb130	we present new observations of the cb130 region, composed of three separatecores. using the \textit{spitzer space telescope} we detected a class 0 and aclass ii object in one of these, cb130-1. the observed photometric data from\textit{spitzer} and ground-based telescopes are used to establish the physicalparameters of the class 0 object. sed fitting with a radiative transfer modelshows that the luminosity of the class 0 object is 0.14 $-$ 0.16 l$_{\odot}$,which is a low luminosity for a protostellar object. in order to constrain thechemical characteristics of the core having the low luminosity object, wecompare our molecular line observations to models of lines including abundancevariations. we tested both ad hoc step function abundance models and a seriesof self-consistent chemical evolution models. in the chemical evolution models,we consider a continuous accretion model and an episodic accretion model toexplore how variable luminosity affects the chemistry. the step functionabundance models can match observed lines reasonably well. the best fittingchemical evolution model requires episodic accretion and the formation ofco$_2$ ice from co ice during the low luminosity periods. this process removesc from the gas phase, providing a much improved fit to the observed gas-phasemolecular lines and the co$_2$ ice absorption feature. based on the chemicalmodel result, the low luminosity of cb130-1 is explained better as a quiescentstage between episodic accretion bursts rather than being at the firsthydrostatic core stage.

1206.4730	revealing the millimeter environment of the new fu orionis candidate  hbc722 with the submillimeter array	we present 230 ghz submillimeter array continuum and molecular lineobservations of the newly discovered fuor candidate hbc722. we report thedetection of seven 1.3 mm continuum sources in the vicinity of hbc722, none ofwhich correspond to hbc722 itself. we compile infrared and submillimetercontinuum photometry of each source from previous studies and conclude thatthree are class 0 embedded protostars, one is a class i embedded protostar, oneis a class i/ii transition object, and two are either starless cores or veryyoung, very low luminosity protostars or first hydrostatic cores. we detect anorthwest-southeast outflow, consistent with the previous detection of such anoutflow in low-resolution, single-dish observations, and note that its axis maybe precessing. we show that this outflow is centered on and driven by one ofthe nearby class 0 sources rather than hbc722, and find no conclusive evidencethat hbc722 itself is driving an outflow. the non-detection of hbc722 in the1.3 mm continuum observations suggests an upper limit of 0.02 solar masses forthe mass of the circumstellar disk. this limit is consistent with typical ttauri disks and with a disk that provides sufficient mass to power the burst.

1208.5498	detection of the simplest sugar, glycolaldehyde, in a solar-type  protostar with alma	glycolaldehyde (hcoch2oh) is the simplest sugar and an important intermediatein the path toward forming more complex biologically relevant molecules. inthis paper we present the first detection of 13 transitions of glycolaldehydearound a solar-type young star, through atacama large millimeter array (alma)observations of the class 0 protostellar binary iras 16293-2422 at 220 ghz (6transitions) and 690 ghz (7 transitions). the glycolaldehyde lines have theirorigin in warm (200-300 k) gas close to the individual components of thebinary. glycolaldehyde co-exists with its isomer, methyl formate (hcooch3),which is a factor 10-15 more abundant toward the two sources. the data alsoshow a tentative detection of ethylene glycol, the reduced alcohol ofglycolaldehyde. in the 690 ghz data, the seven transitions predicted to havethe highest optical depths based on modeling of the 220 ghz lines all showred-shifted absorption profiles toward one of the components in the binary(iras16293b) indicative of infall and emission at the systemic velocity offsetfrom this by about 0.2" (25 au). we discuss the constraints on the chemicalformation of glycolaldehyde and other organic species - in particular, in thecontext of laboratory experiments of photochemistry of methanol-containingices. the relative abundances appear to be consistent with uv photochemistry ofa ch3oh-co mixed ice that has undergone mild heating. the order of magnitudeincrease in line density in these early alma data illustrate its huge potentialto reveal the full chemical complexity associated with the formation of solarsystem analogs.

1301.6792	filamentary accretion flows in the embedded serpens south protocluster	one puzzle in understanding how stars form in clusters is the source of mass-- is all of the mass in place before the first stars are born, or is there anextended period when the cluster accretes material which can continuously fuelthe star formation process? we use a multi-line spectral survey of the southernfilament associated with the serpens south embedded cluster-forming region inorder to determine if mass is accreting from the filament onto the cluster, andwhether the accretion rate is significant. our analysis suggests that materialis flowing along the filament's long axis at a rate of ~30msol/myr (inferredfrom the n2h+ velocity gradient along the filament), and radially contractingonto the filament at ~130msol/myr (inferred from hnc self-absorption). theseaccretion rates are sufficient to supply mass to the central cluster at asimilar rate to the current star formation rate in the cluster. filamentaryaccretion flows may therefore be very important in the ongoing evolution ofthis cluster.

1406.0709	dynamical structure of the inner 100 au of the deeply embedded protostar  iras 16293-2422	a fundamental question about the early evolution of low-mass protostars iswhen circumstellar disks may form. high angular resolution observations ofmolecular transitions in the (sub)millimeter wavelength windows make itpossible to investigate the kinematics of the gas around newly-formed stars,for example to identify the presence of rotation and infall. iras 16293-2422was observed with the extended submillimeter array (esma) resulting insubarcsecond resolution (0.46" x 0.29", i.e. $\sim$ 55 $\times$ 35~au) imagesof compact emission from the c$^{17}$o (3-2) and c$^{34}$s (7-6) transitions at337~ghz (0.89~mm). to recover the more extended emission we have combined theesma data with sma observations of the same molecules. the emission ofc$^{17}$o (3-2) and c$^{34}$s (7-6) both show a velocity gradient orientedalong a northeast-southwest direction with respect to the continuum marking thelocation of one of the components of the binary, iras16293a. our combined esmaand sma observations show that the velocity field on the 50--400~au scales isconsistent with a rotating structure. it cannot be explained by simplekeplerian rotation around a single point mass but rather needs to take intoaccount the enclosed envelope mass at the radii where the observed lines areexcited. we suggest that iras 16293-2422 could be among the best candidates toobserve a pseudo-disk with future high angular resolution observations.

(1999), but only if the true values of the field for the non-detections areclose to the 3-sigma upper limits. if instead these values are significantlylower (for example, similar to the 1-sigma limits), then the typical cloud isgenerally magnetically supercritical.

astro-ph;0510066	observations of global and local infall in ngc 1333	we report ``infall asymmetry'' in the hco$^+$ (1--0) and (3--2) lines towardngc 1333, extended over $\sim 0.39 {\rm pc}^2$, a larger extent than has beenreported be fore, for any star-forming region. the infall asymmetry extendsover a major portion of the star-forming complex, and is not limited to asingle protostar, or to a single dense core, or to a single spectral line. itseems likely that the infall asymmetry represents inward motions, and thatthese motions are physically associated with the complex. both blue-asymmetricand red-asymmetric lines are seen, but in both the (3--2) and (1--0) lines ofhco$^+$ the vast majority of the asymmetric lines are blue, indicating inwardmotions. the (3--2) line, tracing denser gas, has the spectra with thestrongest asymmetry and these spectra are associated with the protostars iras4a and 4b, which most likely indicates a warm central source is affecting theline profiles. the (3--2) and (1--0) lines usually have the same sense ofasymmetry in common positions, but their profiles differ significantly, and the(1--0) line appears to trace motions on much larger spatial scales than doesthe (3--2) line. line profile models fit the spectra well, but do not stronglyconstrain their parameters. the mass accretion rate of the inward motions is oforder 10$^{-4}$ m$_\odot$/yr, similar to the ratio of stellar mass to clusterage.

astro-ph;0511059	infall and outflow around the hh 212 protostellar system	hh 212 is a highly collimated jet discovered in h2 powered by a young class 0source, iras 05413-0104, in the l1630 cloud of orion. we have mapped around itin 1.33 mm continuum, 12co ($j=2-1$), 13co ($j=2-1$), c18o ($j=2-1$), and so($j_k = 6_5-5_4$) emission at $\sim$ \arcs{2.5} resolution with thesubmillimeter array. a dust core is seen in the continuum around the source. aflattened envelope is seen in c18o around the source in the equatorperpendicular to the jet axis, with its inner part seen in 13co. the structureand kinematics of the envelope can be roughly reproduced by a simple edge-ondisk model with both infall and rotation. in this model, the density of thedisk is assumed to have a power-law index of $p=-1.5$ or -2, as found in otherlow-mass envelopes. the envelope seems dynamically infalling toward the sourcewith slow rotation because the kinematics is found to be roughly consistentwith a free fall toward the source plus a rotation of a constant specificangular momentum. a 12co outflow is seen surrounding the h2 jet, with a narrowwaist around the source. jetlike structures are also seen in 12co near thesource aligned with the h2 jet at high velocities. the morphologicalrelationship between the h2 jet and the 12co outflow, and the kinematics of the12co outflow along the jet axis are both consistent with those seen in ajet-driven bow shock model. so emission is seen around the source and the h2knotty shocks in the south, tracing shocked emission around them.

astro-ph;0605475	the spitzer c2d survey of nearby dense cores: iii: low mass star  formation in a small group, l1251b	we present a comprehensive study of a low-mass star-forming region,l1251b, atwavelengths from the near-infrared to the millimeter. l1251b, where only oneprotostar, iras 22376+7455, was known previously, is confirmed to be a smallgroup of protostars based on observations with the spitzer space telescope. themost luminous source of l1251b is located 5" north of the iras position. anear-infrared bipolar nebula, which is not associated with the brightest objectand is located at the southeast corner of l1251b, has been detected in the iracbands. ovro and sma interferometric observations indicate that the brightestsource and the bipolar nebula source in the irac bands are deeply embedded disksources.submillimeter continuum observations with single-dish telescopes andthe sma interferometric observations suggest two possible prestellar objectswith very high column densities. outside of the small group, many young stellarobject candidates have been detected over a larger region of 12' x 12'.extended emission to the east of l1251b has been detected at 850 micron; this"east core" may be a site for future star formation since no point source hasbeen detected with irac or mips. this region is therefore a possible example oflow-mass cluster formation, where a small group of pre- and protostellarobjects (l1251b) is currently forming, alongside a large starless core (theeast core).

astro-ph;0610577	a large scale survey of ngc1333	we observed the clustered star forming complex ngc1333 with the bima andfcrao telescopes in the transitions hco+(1-0) and n2h+(1-0) over an 11'x11'area with resolution ~10" (0.015pc). the n2h+ emission follows very closely thesubmillimeter dust continuum emission, while hco+ emission appears morespatially extended and also traces outflows. we have identified 93 n2h+ coresusing the clumpfind algorithm, and we derive n2h+ core masses between 0.05 and2.5m_sun, with uncertainties of a factor of a few, dominated by the adoptedn2h+ abundance. from a comparison with virial masses, we argue that most ofthese n2h+ cores are likely to be bound, even at the lowest masses, suggestingthat the cores do not trace transient structures, and implies the entire massdistribution consists of objects that can potentially form stars. we find thatthe mass distribution of n2h+ cores resembles the field star imf, whichsuggests that the imf is locked in at the pre-stellar stage of evolution. wefind that the n2h+ cores associated with stars identified from spitzer infraredimages have a flat mass distribution. this might be because lower mass coreslose a larger fraction of their mass when forming a star. even in thisclustered environment, we find no evidence for ballistic motions of the coresrelative to their lower density surroundings traced by isotopic co emission,though this conclusion must remain tentative until the surroundings areobserved at the same high resolution as the n2h+.

astro-ph;0610667	investigating grain growth in disks around southern t tauri stars at  millimetre wavelengths	context - low-mass stars form with disks in which the coagulation of grainsmay eventually lead to the formation of planets. it is not known when and wheregrain growth occurs, as models that explain the observations are oftendegenerate. a way to break this degeneracy is to resolve the sources understudy. aims - to find evidence for the existence of grains of millimetre sizesin disks around in t tauri stars, implying grain growth. methods - theaustralia telescope compact array (atca) was used to observe 15 southern ttauri stars, five in the constellation lupus and ten in chamaeleon, at 3.3millimetre. the five lupus sources were also observed with the submillimeterarray (sma) at 1.4 millimetre. our new data are complemented with data from theliterature to determine the slopes of the spectral energy distributions in themillimetre regime. results - ten sources were detected at better than 3sigmawith the atca, with sigma ~1-2 mjy, and all sources that were observed with thesma were detected at better than 15sigma, with sigma ~4 mjy. six of the sourcesin our sample are resolved to physical radii of ~100 au. assuming that theemission from such large disks is predominantly optically thin, the millimetreslope can be related directly to the opacity index. for the other sources, theopacity indices are lower limits. four out of six resolved sources have opacityindices &lt;~1, indicating grain growth to millimetre sizes and larger. the massesof the disks range from &lt; 0.01 to 0.08 msun, which is comparable to the minimummass solar nebula. a tentative correlation is found between the millimetreslope and the strength and shape of the 10-micron silicate feature, indicatingthat grain growth occurs on similar (short) timescales in both the inner andouter disk.

astro-ph;0612365	sharc-ii mapping of spitzer c2d small clouds and cores	we present the results of a submillimeter survey of 53 low-mass dense coreswith the submillimeter high angular resolution camera ii (sharc-ii). the surveyis a follow-up project to the spitzer legacy program ``from molecular cores toplanet-forming disks'', with the purpose being to create a complete data set ofnearby low-mass dense cores from the infrared to the millimeter. we presentmaps of 52 cores at 350 microns and three cores at 450 microns, two of whichwere observed at both wavelengths. of these 52 cores, 41 were detected bysharc-ii: 32 contained one submillimeter source while 9 contained multiplesources. for each submillimeter source detected, we report various sourceproperties including source position, fluxes in various apertures, size, aspectratio, and position angle. for the 12 cores that were not detected we presentupper limits. the sources detected by sharc-ii have, on average, smaller sizesat the 2sigma contours than those derived from longer-wavelength bolometerobservations. we conclude that this is not caused by a failure to integratelong enough to detect the full extent of the core; instead it arises primarilyfrom the fact that the observations presented in this survey are insensitive tosmoothly varying extended emission. we find that sharc-ii observations oflow-mass cores are much better suited to distinguishing between starless andprotostellar cores than observations at longer wavelengths. very low luminosityobjects, a new class of objects being discovered by the spitzer space telescopein cores previously classified as starless, look very similar at 350 microns toother cores with more luminous protostars.

astro-ph;0701115	prosac: a submillimeter array survey of low-mass protostars. i. overview  of program: envelopes, disks, outflows and hot cores	this paper presents a large spectral line and continuum survey of 8 deeplyembedded, low-mass protostellar cores using the submillimeter array. eachsource was observed in high excitation lines of some of the most commonmolecular species, co, hco+, cs, so, h2co, ch3oh and sio. line emission from 11species originating from warm and dense gas have been imaged at high angularresolution (1-3"; typically 200-600 au) together with continuum emission at 230ghz (1.3 mm) and 345 ghz (0.8 mm). compact continuum emission is observed forall sources which likely originates in marginally optically thick circumstellardisks, with typical lower limits to their masses of 0.1 m_sun (1-10% of themasses of their envelopes) and having a dust opacity law with betaapproximately 1. prominent outflows are present in co 2-1 observations in allsources: the most diffuse outflows are found in the sources with the lowestratios of disk-to-envelope mass, and it is suggested that these sources are ina phase where accretion of matter from the envelope has almost finished and theremainder of the envelope material is being dispersed by the outflows. othercharacteristic dynamical signatures are found with inverse p cygni profilesindicative of infalling motions seen in the 13co 2-1 lines towardngc1333-iras4a and -iras4b. outflow-induced shocks are present on all scales inthe protostellar environments and are most clearly traced by the emission ofch3oh in ngc1333-iras4a and -iras4b. these observations suggest that theemission of ch3oh and h2co from these proposed "hot corinos" are related to theshocks caused by the protostellar outflows. only one source, ngc1333-iras2a,has evidence for hot, compact ch3oh emission coincident with the embeddedprotostar.

0812.2012	the spitzer c2d survey of nearby dense cores. v. discovery of a vello in  the "starless" dense core l328	this paper reports the discovery of a very low luminosity object (vello) inthe "starless" dense core l328, using the spitzer space telescope and groundbased observations from near-infrared to millimeter wavelengths. the spitzer 8micron image indicates that l328 consists of three subcores of which thesmallest one may harbor a source, l328-irs while two other subcores remainstarless. l328-irs is a class 0 protostar according to its bolometrictemperature (44 k) and the high fraction ~72 % of its luminosity emitted atsub-millimeter wavelengths. its inferred "internal luminosity" (0.04 - 0.06lsun) using a radiative transfer model under the most plausible assumption ofits distance as 200 pc is much fainter than for a typical protostar, and evenfainter than other vellos studied previously. note, however, that its inferredluminosity may be uncertain by a factor of 2-3 if we consider two extremevalues of the distance of l328-irs (125 or 310 pc). low angular resolutionobservations of co do not show any clear evidence of a molecular outflowactivity. but broad line widths toward l328, and spitzer and near-infraredimages showing nebulosity possibly tracing an outflow cavity, strongly suggestthe existence of outflow activity. provided that an envelope of at most ~0.1msunis the only mass accretion reservoir for l328-irs, and the star formationefficiency is close to the canonical value ~30%, l328-irs has not yet accretedmore than 0.05 msun. at the assumed distance of 200 pc, l328-irs is destined tobe a brown dwarf.
