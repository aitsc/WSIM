0902.0541	co emission and variable ch and ch+ absorption towards hd34078: evidence  for a nascent bow shock ?	the runaway star hd34078, initially selected to investigate small scalestructure in a foreground diffuse cloud has been shown to be surrounded byhighly excited h2. we first search for an association between the foregroundcloud and hd34078. second, we extend previous investigations of temporalabsorption line variations (ch, ch+, h2) in order to better characterize them.we have mapped the co(2-1) emission at 12 arcsec resolution around hd34078'sposition, using the 30 m iram antenna. the follow-up of ch and ch+ absorptionlines has been extended over 5 more years. in parallel, ch absorption towardsthe reddened star zeta per have been monitored to check the homogeneity of ourmeasurements. three more fuse spectra have been obtained to search for n(h2)variations. co observations show a pronounced maximum near hd34078's position,clearly indicating that the star and diffuse cloud are associated. the opticalspectra confirm the reality of strong, rapid and correlated ch and ch+fluctuations. on the other hand, n(h2, j=0) has varied by less than 5 % over 4years. we also discard n(ch) variations towards zeta per at scales less than 20au. observational constraints from this work and from 24 micron dust emissionappear to be consistent with h2 excitation but inconsistent with steady-statebow shock models and rather suggest that the shell of compressed gassurrounding hd34078, is seen at an early stage of the interaction. the ch andch+ time variations as well as their large abundances are likely due tochemical structure in the shocked gas layer located at the stellar wind/ambientcloud interface. finally, the lack of variations for both n(h2, j=0) towardshd34078 and n(ch) towards zeta per suggests that quiescent molecular gas is notsubject to pronounced small-scale structure.

0902.4457	photometric and spectroscopic detection of the primary transit of the  111-day-period planet hd 80606 b	we report the detection of the primary transit of the extra-solar planet hd80606 b, thanks to photometric and spectroscopic observations performed atobservatoire de haute-provence, simultaneously with the ccd camera at the120-cm telescope and the sophie spectrograph at the 193-cm telescope. weobserved the whole egress of the transit and partially its central part, inboth data sets with the same timings. the ingress occurred before sunset andwas not observed. the full duration of the transit was between 9.5 and 17.2hours. the data allows the planetary radius to be measured (rp = 0.9 +- 0.1rjup) and other parameters of the system to be refined. radial velocitymeasurements show the detection of a prograde rossiter-mclaughlin effect, andprovide a hint for a spin-orbit misalignment. if confirmed, this misalignmentwould corroborate the hypothesis that hd 80606 b owes its unusual orbitalconfiguration to kozai migration. hd 80606 b is by far the transiting planet onthe longest period detected today. its unusually small radius reinforces theobserved relationship between the planet radius and the incident flux receivedfrom the star and opens new questions for theory. orbiting a quite bright star(v=9), it opens opportunities to numerous follow-up studies.

0906.5605	spin-orbit misalignment in the hd80606 planetary system	we recently reported the photometric and spectroscopic detection of theprimary transit of the 111-day-period, eccentric extra-solar planet hd80606 b,at observatoire de haute-provence, france (moutou et al. 2009). the wholeegress of the primary transit and a section of its central part were observed,allowing the measurement of the planetary radius, and evidence for a spin-orbitmisalignment through the observation of the rossiter-mclaughlin anomaly. theingress having not been observed for this long-duration transit, uncertaintiesremained in the parameters of the system. we present here a refined, combinedanalysis of our photometric and spectroscopic data, together with furtherpublished radial velocities, ground-based photometry, and spitzer photometryaround the secondary eclipse, as well as new photometric measurements of hd80606 acquired at mount hopkins, arizona, just before the beginning of theprimary transit. although the transit is not detected in those new data, theyprovide an upper limit for the transit duration, which narrows down thepossible behaviour of the rossiter-mclaughlin anomaly in the unobserved part ofthe transit. we analyse the whole data with a bayesian approach using amarkov-chain monte carlo integration on all available information. we find r_p= 0.98 +- 0.03 r_jup for the planetary radius, and a total primary transitduration of 11.9 +- 1.3 hours from first to fourth contact. our analysisreinforces the hypothesis of spin-orbit misalignment in this system (alignmentexcluded at &gt;95 % level), with a positive projected angle between the planetaryorbital axis and the stellar rotation (median solution lambda ~ 50 degrees). ashd80606 is a component of a binary system, the peculiar orbit of its planetcould result from a kozai mechanism.

0707.0417	efficient identification of exoplanetary transit candidates from  superwasp light curves	transiting extrasolar planets constitute only a small fraction of the rangeof stellar systems found to display periodic, shallow dimmings in wide-fieldsurveys employing small-aperture camera arrays. here we present an efficientselection strategy for follow-up observations, derived from analysis of thelight curves of a sample of 67 superwasp targets that passed the selectiontests we used in earlier papers, but which have subsequently been identifiedeither as planet hosts or as astrophysical false positives. we determine thesystem parameters using markov-chain monte carlo analysis of the superwasplight curves. we use a constrained optimisation of chi-squared combined with abayesian prior based on the main-sequence mass and radius expected from the2mass j-h colour. the bayesian nature of the analysis allows us to quantifyboth the departure of the host star from the main-sequence mass-radius relationand the probability that the companion radius is less than 1.5 jupiter radii.when augmented by direct light curve analyses that detect binaries with unequalprimary and secondary eclipses, and objects with aperture blends that areresolved by superwasp, we find that only 13 of the original 67 stars, includingthe three known planets in the sample, would qualify for follow-up. thissuggests that planet discovery "hit rates" better than one-in-five should beachievable. in addition, the stellar binaries that qualify are likely to haveastrophysically interesting stellar or sub-stellar secondaries.

0908.4521	extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs around a-f type stars - vii. theta  cygni radial velocity variations: planets or stellar phenomenon?	(abridged) in the frame of the search for extrasolar planets and brown dwarfsaround early-type main-sequence stars, we present the results obtained on theearly f-type star theta cygni. elodie and sophie at ohp were used to obtain thespectra. our dedicated radial-velocity measurement method was used to monitorthe star's radial velocities over five years. we also use complementary, highangular resolution and high-contrast images taken with pueo at cfht. we showthat theta cygni radial velocities are quasi-periodically variable, with a~150-day period. these variations are not due to the ~0.35-msun stellarcompanion that we detected in imaging at more than 46 au from the star. theabsence of correlation between the bisector velocity span variations and theradial velocity variations for this 7 km/s vsini star, as well as othercriteria indicate that the observed radial velocity variations are not due tostellar spots. the observed amplitude of the bisector velocity span variationsalso seems to rule out stellar pulsations. however, we observe a peak in thebisector velocity span periodogram at the same period as the one found in theradial velocity periodogram, which indicates a probable link between theseradial velocity variations and the low amplitude lineshape variations which areof stellar origin. long-period variations are not expected from this type ofstar to our knowledge. if a stellar origin (hence of new type) was to beconfirmed for these long-period radial velocity variations, this would haveseveral consequences on the search for planets around main-sequence stars, bothin terms of observational strategy and data analysis. an alternativeexplanation for these variable radial velocities is the presence of at leastone planet of a few jupiter masses orbiting at less than 1 au.

(2009) designed to address this issue, we find vsinito be consistent with the value obtained from spectroscopic broadeningmeasurements (vsini = 15.7 +1.4/-1.3 km/s).

1012.5938	the upper atmosphere of the exoplanet hd209458b revealed by the sodium d  lines: temperature-pressure profile, ionization layer, and thermosphere	a complete reassessment of the hst observations of the transits of theextrasolar planet hd209458b has provided a transmission spectrum of theatmosphere over a wide range of wavelengths. analysis of the nai absorptionline profile has already shown that the sodium abundance has to drop by atleast a factor of ten above a critical altitude. here we analyze the profile inthe deep core of the nai doublet line from hst and high-resolution ground-basedspectra to further constrain the vertical structure of the hd209458batmosphere. with a wavelength-dependent cross section that spans more than 5orders of magnitude, we use the absorption signature of the nai doublet as anatmospheric probe. the nai transmission features are shown to sample theatmosphere of hd209458b over an altitude range of more than 6500km,corresponding to a pressure range of 14 scale heights spanning 1 millibar to1e-9 bar pressures. by comparing the observations with a multi-layer model inwhich temperature is a free parameter at the resolution of the atmosphericscale height, we constrain the temperature vertical profile and variations inthe na abundance in the upper part of the atmosphere of hd209458b. we find arise in temperature above the drop in sodium abundance at the 3mbar level. wealso identify an isothermal atmospheric layer at 1500+/-100k spanning almost 6scale heights in altitude, from 1e-5 to 1e-7 bar. above this layer, thetemperature rises again to 2500(+1500/-1000)k at 1e-9 bar, indicating thepresence of a thermosphere. the resulting temperature-pressure (t-p) profileagrees with the na condensation scenario at the 3 mbar level, with a possiblesignature of sodium ionization at higher altitudes, near the 3e-5 bar level.our t-p profile is found to be in good agreement with the profiles obtainedwith aeronomical models including hydrodynamic escape.

0801.0457	exploring interstellar titanium and deuterium abundances and other  correlations	the origin of the observed variability of the gas-phase d/h ratio in thelocal interstellar medium is still debated, and in particular the role ofdeuterium depletion onto dust grains. here we extend the study of therelationship between deuterium and titanium, a refractory species and tracer ofelemental depletion, and explore other relationships. we have acquired highresolution spectra for nine early-type stars using the vlt/uves spectrograph,and detected the absorption lines of interstellar tiii. using a weightedorthogonal distance regression (odr) code and a special method to treat nonsymmetric errors, we compare the tiii columns with the corresponding hi, di andalso oi columns. we perform in parallel the same comparisons for available feiidata. we find a significant correlation between tiii/hi and d/h in our dataset, and, when combined with published results, we confirm and better constraina previously published trend and extend it to low hi columns. we excludeuncertainties in hi and oi columns as the main contributor to the derivedmetals-deuterium correlations by showing that the tiii/hi ratio is positivelycorrelated with di/oi. we find a similar correlation between feii/hi anddi/oi.the tiii gradients are similar or slightly smaller than for feii, whileone would expect larger variations on the basis of the higher condensationtemperature of titanium. however we argue that ionisation effects introducebiases that affect iron and not titanium and may explain the gradientsimilarity. we find a less significant negative correlation between the tiii/diratio and the hydrogen column, possibly a sign of different evaporation of dand metals according to the cloud properties.

0802.0587	exoplanet hd 209458b : evaporation strengthened	following re-analysis of hubble space telescope observations of primarytransits of the extrasolar planet hd209458b at lyman-alpha, ben-jaffel (2007,bj007) claims that no sign of evaporation is observed. here we show that, infact, this new analysis is consistent with the one of vidal-madjar et al.(2003, vm003) and supports the detection of evaporation. the apparentdisagreement is mainly due to the disparate wavelength ranges that are used toderive the transit absorption depth. vm003 derives a (15+/-4)% absorption depthduring transit over the core of the stellar lyman-alpha line (from -130 km/s to+100 km/s), and this result agrees with the (8.9+/-2.1)% absorption depthreported by bj007 from a slightly expanded dataset but over a larger wavelengthrange (+/-200 km/s). these measurements agree also with the (5+/-2)% absorptionreported by vidal-madjar et al. (2004) over the whole lyman-alpha line fromindependent, lower-resolution data. we show that stellar lyman-alphavariability is unlikely to significantly affect those detections. the hi atomsmust necessarily have velocities above the escape velocities and/or be outsidethe roche lobe, given the lobe shape and orientation. absorption by hi inhd209458b's atmosphere has thus been detected with different datasets, and nowwith independent analyses. all these results strengthen the concept ofevaporating hot-jupiters, as well as the modelization of this phenomenon.

1411.3934	sophie velocimetry of kepler transit candidates xiv. a joint  photometric, spectroscopic, and dynamical analysis of the kepler-117 system	as part of our follow-up campaign of kepler planets, we observed kepler-117with the sophie spectrograph at the observatoire de haute-provence. thisf8-type star hosts two transiting planets in non-resonant orbits. the planets,kepler-117 b and c, have orbital periods $\simeq 18.8$ and $\simeq 50.8$ days,and show transit-timing variations (ttvs) of several minutes. we performed acombined markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) fit on transits, radial velocities,and stellar parameters to constrain the characteristics of the system. weincluded the fit of the ttvs in the mcmc by modeling them with dynamicalsimulations. in this way, consistent posterior distributions were drawn for thesystem parameters. according to our analysis, planets b and c have notablydifferent masses ($0.094 \pm 0.033$ and $1.84 \pm 0.18$ m$_{\rm j}$) and loworbital eccentricities ($0.0493 \pm 0.0062$ and $0.0323 \pm 0.0033$). theuncertainties on the derived parameters are strongly reduced if the fit of thettvs is included in the combined mcmc. the ttvs allow measuring the mass ofplanet b, although its radial velocity amplitude is poorly constrained.finally, we checked that the best solution is dynamically stable.

1412.7761	discovery of wasp-85ab: a hot jupiter in a visual binary system	we report the discovery of the transiting hot jupiter exoplanet wasp-85ab.using a combined analysis of spectroscopic and photometric data, we determinethat the planet orbits its host star every 2.66 days, and has a mass of1.09+/-0.03 m_jup and a radius of 1.44+/-0.02 r_jup. the host star is of g5spectral type, with magnitude v=11.2, and lies 125+/-80 pc distant. we findstellar parameters of t_eff=5685+/-65 k, super-solar metallicity([fe/h]=0.08+/-0.10), m_star=1.04+/-0.07 m_sun and r_star=0.96+/-0.13 r_sun.the system has a k-dwarf binary companion, wasp-85b, at a separation ofapproximately 1.5". the close proximity of this companion leads tocontamination of our photometry, decreasing the apparent transit depth that weaccount for during our analysis. without this correction, we find the depth tobe 50 percent smaller, the stellar density to be 32 percent smaller, and theplanet radius to be 18 percent smaller than the true value. many of our radialvelocity observations are also contaminated; these are disregarded whenanalysing the system in favour of the uncontaminated harps observations, asthey have reduced semi-amplitudes that lead to underestimated planetary masses.we find a long-term trend in the binary position angle, indicating amisalignment between the binary and orbital planes. wasp observations of thesystem show variability with a period of 14.64 days, indicative of rotationalmodulation caused by stellar activity. analysis of the ca ii h+k lines showsstrong emission that implies that both binary components are strongly active.we find that the system is likely to be less than a few gyr old. wasp-85 liesin the field of view of k2 campaign 1. long cadence observations of the planetclearly show the planetary transits, along with the signature of stellarvariability. analysis of the k2 data, both long and short cadence, is ongoing.

0806.0719	misaligned spin-orbit in the xo-3 planetary system?	the transiting extrasolar planet xo-3b is remarkable, with a high mass andeccentric orbit. the unusual characteristics make it interesting to testwhether its orbital plane is parallel to the equator of its host star, as it isobserved for other transiting planets. we performed radial velocitymeasurements of xo-3 with the sophie spectrograph at the 1.93-m telescope ofhaute-provence observatory during a planetary transit, and at other orbitalphases. this allowed us to observe the rossiter-mclaughlin effect and, togetherwith a new analysis of the transit light curve, to refine the parameters of theplanet. the unusual shape of the radial velocity anomaly during the transitprovides a hint for a nearly transverse rossiter-mclaughlin effect. thesky-projected angle between the planetary orbital axis and the stellar rotationaxis should be lambda = 70 +/- 15 degrees to be compatible with ourobservations. this suggests that some close-in planets might result fromgravitational interaction between planets and/or stars rather than migrationdue to interaction with the accretion disk. this surprising result requiresconfirmation by additional observations, especially at lower airmass, to fullyexclude the possibility that the signal is due to systematic effects.

astro-ph;0006070	no diffuse h2 in the metal deficient galaxy i zw 18	the metal deficient starburst galaxy izw18 has been observed with fuse in asearch for h2 molecules. the spectrum obtained with an aperture covering thefull galaxy shows no absorption lines of diffuse h2 at the radial velocity ofthe galaxy. the upper limit for the diffuse h2 column density is found to bevery low: n(h2) &lt;~ 10^15 cm-2 (10 sigma), unlike our galaxy where h2 isgenerally present for even low hi column densities. although the hi columndensity is here as high as n(hi) ~ 2.10^21 cm-2, we observe 2n(h2)/n(hi)&lt;&lt;10^-6. we cannot exclude the possibility that some h2 could be in very dense,small and discrete clumps which cannot be detected with the presentobservation. however, the remarkable absence of diffuse h2 in this metal-poorgalaxy can be explained by the low abundance of dust grains (needed to formthis molecule from h-atoms), the high ultraviolet flux and the low density ofthe hi cloud surrounding the star-forming regions. thus having eliminateddiffuse h2 as a significant contributor to the total mass, it appears that thegas of the galaxy is dominated by hi, and that the high dynamical mass is notcomposed of cold and diffuse baryonic dark matter.

astro-ph;0501320	the d/h ratio in the interstellar medium toward the white dwarf  pg0038+199	we determine the d/h ratio in the interstellar medium toward the do whitedwarf pg0038+199 using spectra from the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer(fuse), with ground-based support from keck hires. we employ curve of growth,apparent optical depth and profile fitting techniques to measure columndensities and limits of many other species (h2, nai, ci, cii, ciii, ni, nii,oi, siii, pii, siii, ari and feii) which allow us to determine related ratiossuch as d/o, d/n and the h2 fraction. our efforts are concentrated on measuringgas-phase d/h, which is key to understanding galactic chemical evolution andcomparing it to predictions from big bang nucleosynthesis. we find columndensities log n(hi) = 20.41+-0.08, log n(di)=15.75+-0.08 and log n(h2) =19.33+-0.04, yielding a molecular hydrogen fraction of 0.14+-0.02 (2 sigmaerrors), with an excitation temperature of 143+-5k. the high hi column densityimplies that pg0038+199 lies outside of the local bubble; we estimate itsdistance to be 297 (+164,-104)pc (1 sigma). d/[hi+2h2] toward pg0038+199 is1.91(+0.52,-0.42) e-5 (2 sigma). there is no evidence of component structure onthe scale of delta v &gt; 8 km/s based on nai, but there is marginal evidence forstructure on smaller scales. the d/h value is high compared to the majority ofrecent d/h measurements, but consistent with the values for two othermeasurements at similar distances. d/o is in agreement with other distantmeasurements. the scatter in d/h values beyond ~100pc remains a challenge forgalactic chemical evolution.

astro-ph;0503419	velocity dispersion of excited h2	we present a study of the high rotational bands (j &gt; 2) of h2 toward 4 earlytype galactic stars: hd 73882, hd 192639, hd 206267, and hd 207538. in eachcase, the velocity dispersion - characterized by the spectrum fitting parameterb - increases with the level of excitation, a phenomenon that has previouslybeen detected by the copernicus and imaps observatories. in particular, we showwith 4 sigma confidence that for hd 192639 it is not possible to fit all jlevels with a single b value, and that higher b values are needed for thehigher levels. the amplitude of the line broadening, which can be as high as 10km s^-1, makes explanations such as inhomogeneous spatial distributionunlikely. we investigate a mechanism in which the broadening is due to themolecules that are rotationally excited through the excess energy acquiredafter their formation on a grain (h2-formation pumping). we show that differentdispersions would be a natural consequence of this mechanism. we note howeverthat such process would require a formation rate 10 times higher then what wasinferred from other observations. in view of the difficulty to account for thevelocity dispersion as thermal broadening (t would be around 10,000 k), weconclude then that we are most certainly observing some highly turbulent warmlayer associated with the cold diffuse cloud. embedded in a magnetic field, itcould be responsible for the high quantities of ch+ measured in the coldneutral medium.

astro-ph;0508611	fuse determination of a low deuterium abundance along an extended sight  line in the galactic disk	we present a study of the deuterium abundance along the extended sight line(2.7kpc) toward hd 90087 with fuse. both in terms of distance and columndensities, hd 90087 has the longest and densest sight line observed in thegalactic disk for which a deuterium abundance has been measured from uvabsorption lines. because many interstellar clouds are probed along this sightline, possible variations in the properties of individual clouds should beaveraged out. this would yield a deuterium abundance which is characteristic ofthe interstellar medium on scales larger than the local bubble. we reportd/o=(1.7+/-0.7)e-2 and d/h=(9.8+/-3.8)e-6 (2 sigma). our new results confirmthat the gas-phase deuterium abundance in the distant interstellar medium issignificantly lower than the one measured within the local bubble. wesupplement our study with a revision of the oxygen abundance toward themoderately distant star feige 110 (~200 pc). excluding saturated lines from thefits of the fuse spectra is critical; this led us to derive an oi columndensity about two times larger than the one previously reported for feige 110.the corresponding updated d/o ratio on this sight line is d/o=(2.6+/-1.0)e-2 (2sigma), which is lower than the one measured within the local bubble. thedataset available now outside the local bubble shows a contrast between theconstancy of d/o and the variability of d/h. as oxygen is considered to be agood proxy for hydrogen within the interstellar medium, this discrepancy ispuzzling.
