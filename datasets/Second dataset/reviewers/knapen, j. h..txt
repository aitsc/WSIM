0901.0641	bars, ovals and lenses in early-type disk galaxies: probes of galaxy  evolution	the origin of s0 galaxies is discussed in the framework of early mergers in acold dark matter cosmology, and in a scenario where s0s are assumed to beformer spirals stripped of gas. from an analysis of 127 early-type diskgalaxies (s0-sa), we find a clear correlation between the scale parameters ofthe bulge (r_eff) and the disk (h_r), a correlation which is difficult toexplain if these galaxies were formed in mergers of disk galaxies. however, thestripping hypothesis, including quiescent star formation, is not sufficient toexplain the origin of s0s either, because it is not compatible with our findingthat s0s have a significantly smaller fraction of bars (46$\pm$6 %) than theirassumed progenitors, s0/a galaxies (93$\pm$5 %) or spirals (64-69 %). ourconclusion is that even if a large majority of s0s were descendants of spiralgalaxies, bars and ovals must play an important role in their evolution. thesmaller fraction particularly of strong bars in s0 galaxies is compensated by alarger fraction of ovals/lenses (97$\pm$2 % compared to 82-83 % in spirals),many of which might be weakened bars. we also found massive disk-like bulges innine of the s0 galaxies, bulges which might have formed at an early gas-richstage of galaxy evolution.

0903.2008	do bars drive spiral density waves?	we present deep near-infrared k_s-band aat iris2 observations of a selectedsample of nearby barred spiral galaxies, including some with the strongestknown bars. the sample covers a range of hubble types from sb0- to sbc. thegoal is to determine if the torque strengths of the spirals correlate withthose of the bars, which might be expected if the bars actually drive thespirals as has been predicted by theoretical studies. this issue hasimplications for interpreting bar and spiral fractions at high redshift.analysis of previous samples suggested that such a correlation exists in thenear-infrared, where effects of extinction and star formation are lessimportant. however, the earlier samples had only a few excessively strong bars.our new sample largely confirms our previous studies, but still any correlationis relatively weak. we find two galaxies, ngc 7513 and ugc 10862, where thereis a only a weak spiral in the presence of a very strong bar. we suggest thatsome spirals probably are driven by their bars at the same pattern speed, butthat this may be only when the bar is growing or if there is abundant gas anddissipation.

0904.4261	the h alpha galaxy survey vii. the spatial distribution of star  formation within disks and bulges	we analyse the current build-up of stellar mass within the disks and bulgesof nearby galaxies through a comparison of the spatial distributions of formingand old stellar populations. h alpha and r-band imaging are used to determinethe distributions of young and old stellar populations in 313 s0a - im fieldgalaxies out to 40 mpc. concentration indices and mean normalised lightprofiles are calculated as a function of galaxy type and bar classification.the mean profiles and concentration indices show a strong and smooth dependenceon galaxy type. apart from a central deficit due to bulge/bar light in somegalaxy types, mean h alpha and r-band profiles are very similar. mean profileswithin a given type are remarkably constant even given wide ranges in galaxyluminosity and size. sbc, sbbc and particularly sbb galaxies have profiles thatare markedly different from those of unbarred galaxies. h alpha emission fromsbb galaxies is studied in detail; virtually all show resolved centralcomponents and concentrations of star formation at or just outside the bar-endradius. in these galaxies, star formation has the same radial distribution asr-band light, i.e. stellar mass is building at approximately constantmorphology, with no strong evidence for outer truncation or inside-out diskformation.

0707.0651	star formation and stellar populations across nuclear rings in galaxies	(abridged) we present a study of the optical spectra of a sample of eightstar-forming nuclear rings and the nuclei of their host galaxies. the spectrawere obtained with the isis spectrograph on the william herschel telescope andcover a wide range in wavelength, enabling the measurement of several stellarabsorption features and gas emission lines.  we compared the strength of the absorption lines to a variety of populationsynthesis models for the star-formation history in the nuclear rings, includingalso the contribution of the older bulge and disc stellar components. we findthat the stars in our sample of nuclear rings have most likely formed over aprolonged period of time characterised by episodic bursts of star-formationactivity. constant star formation is firmly ruled out by the data, whereas aone-off formation event is an unlikely explanation for a common galacticcomponent such as nuclear rings.  we have used emission-line measurements to constrain the physical conditionsof the ionised gas within the rings. emission in all nuclear rings originatesfrom hii-regions with electron densities typical for these kinds of objects,and that the rings are characterised by values for the gas metallicity rangingfrom slightly below to just above solar.  as 20% of nearby spiral galaxies hosts nuclear rings that are currentlyforming massive stars, our finding of an episodic star formation history innuclear rings implies that a significant population remains to be identified ofyoung nuclear rings that are not currently in a massive star formation phase.

0908.0272	ainur: atlas of images of nuclear rings	we present the most complete atlas of nuclear rings to date. we include 113rings found in 107 galaxies, six of which are elliptical galaxies, five arehighly inclined disc galaxies, 18 are unbarred disc galaxies, and 78 are barreddisc galaxies. star-forming nuclear rings occur in 20% of disc galaxies withtypes between t=-3 and t=7. we aim to explore possible relationships betweenthe size and morphology of the rings and various galactic parameters. weproduce colour index and structure maps, as well as halpha and paalphacontinuum-subtracted images from hst archival data. we derive ellipticityprofiles from h-band 2mass images in order to detect bars and find their metricparameters. we measure the non-axisymmetric torque parameter, qg, and searchfor correlations between bar, ring metric parameters, and qg.  our atlas of nuclear rings includes star-forming and dust rings. nuclearrings span a range from a few tens of parsecs to a few kiloparsecs in radius.star-forming nuclear rings can be found in a wide range of morphological types,from s0 to sd, with a peak in the distribution between sab and sb, and withoutstrong preference for barred galaxies. dust nuclear rings are found inelliptical and s0 galaxies. for barred galaxies, the maximum radius that anuclear ring can reach is a quarter of the bar radius. we found a nearly randomdistribution of pa offsets between nuclear rings and bars. there is someevidence that nuclear ring ellipticity is limited by bar ellipticity. weconfirm that the maximum relative size of a star-forming nuclear ring isinversely proportional to the non-axisymmetric torque parameter, qg, and thatthe origin of nuclear rings, even the ones in non-barred hosts, are closelylinked to the existence of dynamical resonances.

1002.4370	photometric scaling relations of lenticular and spiral galaxies	photometric scaling relations are studied for s0 galaxies and compared withthose for spirals. new 2d k_s-band multi-component decompositions are presentedfor 122 early-type disk galaxies. combining with our previous decompositions,the final sample consists of 175 galaxies. as a comparison sample we use theohio state university bright spiral galaxy survey (osubsgs), for which similardecompositions have previously been made by us. our main results are: (1)important scaling relations are present, indicating that the formativeprocesses of bulges and disks in s0s are coupled like has been previously foundfor spirals. (2) we obtain median r_{eff}/h_r = 0.20, 0.15 and 0.10 for s0,s0/a-sa and sab-sc galaxies: these are smaller than predicted by simulationmodels in which bulges are formed by galaxy mergers. (3) the properties ofbulges of s0s are different from the elliptical galaxies, which is manifestedin the m_k(bulge) vs r_{eff} relation, in the photometric plane, and to someextent also in the kormendy relation. the bulges of s0s are similar to bulgesof spirals with m_k(bulge) &lt; -20 mag. some s0s have small bulges, but theirproperties are not compatible with the idea that they could evolve to dwarfs bygalaxy harassment. (4) the relative bulge flux b/t for s0s covers the fullrange found in the hubble sequence. (5) the values and relations of theparameters of the disks of the s0 galaxies in nirs0s are similar to thoseobtained for spirals in the osubsgs. overall, our results support the view thatspiral galaxies with bulges brighter than -20 mag in the k-band can evolvedirectly into s0s, due to stripping of gas followed by truncated starformation.

1003.1751	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey ii: warm molecular gas and star  formation in three field spiral galaxies	we present the results of large-area co j=3-2 emission mapping of threenearby field galaxies, ngc 628, ngc 3521, and ngc 3627, completed at the jamesclerk maxwell telescope as part of the nearby galaxies legacy survey. thesegalaxies all have moderate to strong co j=3-2 detections over large areas ofthe fields observed by the survey, showing resolved structure and dynamics intheir warm/dense molecular gas disks. all three galaxies were part of thespitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey sample, and as such have excellentpublished multi-wavelength ancillary data. these data sets allow us to examinethe star formation properties, gas content, and dynamics of these galaxies onsub-kiloparsec scales. we find that the global gas depletion times fordense/warm molecular gas in these galaxies is consistent with other results fornearby spiral galaxies, indicating this may be independent of galaxy propertiessuch as structures, gas compositions, and environments. similar to the resultsfrom the things hi survey, we do not see a correlation of the star formationefficiency with the gas surface density consistent with the schmidt-kennicuttlaw. finally, we find that the star formation efficiency of the dense moleculargas traced by co j=3-2 is potentially flat or slightly declining as a functionof molecular gas density, the co j=3-2/j=1-0 ratio (in contrast to thecorrelation found in a previous study into the starburst galaxy m83), and thefraction of total gas in molecular form.

1004.5463	bars do drive spiral density waves	recently, buta etal. (2009) examined the question "do bars drive spiraldensity waves?", an idea supported by theoretical studies and also from apreliminary observational analysis block etal (2004). they estimated maximumbar strengths q_b, maximum spiral strengths q_s, and maximum m=2 arm contrastsa_2s for 23 galaxies with deep aat k_s-band images. these were combined withpreviously published q_b and q_s values for 147 galaxies from the osubsgssample and with the 12 galaxies from block etal(2004). weak correlation betweenq_b and q_s was confirmed for the combined sample, whereas the aat subset aloneshowed no significant correlations between q_b and q_s, nor between q_b anda_2s. a similar negative result was obtained in durbala etal. (2009) for 46galaxies. based on these studies, the answer to the above question remainsuncertain. here we use a novel approach, and show that although the correlationbetween the maximum bar and spiral parameters is weak, these parameters docorrelate when compared locally. for the osubsgs sample a statisticallysignificant correlation is found between the local spiral amplitude, and theforcing due to the bar's potential at the same distance, out to 1.6 bar radii(the typical bar perturbation is then of the order of a few percent). also forthe sample of 23 aat galaxies we find a significant correlation between localparameters out to 1.4 bar radii. our new results confirm that, at least in astatistical sense, bars do indeed drive spiral density waves.

1008.4058	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey v: the co(j=3-2) distribution and  molecular outflow in ngc~4631	we have made the first map of co(j=3-2) emission covering the disk of theedge-on galaxy, ngc~4631, which is known for its spectacular gaseous halo. thestrongest emission, which we model with a gaussian ring,occurs within a radiusof 5 kpc. weaker disk emission is detected out to radii of 12 kpc, the mostextensive molecular component yet seen in this galaxy. from comparisons withinfrared data, we find that co(j=3-2) emission more closely follows the hotdust component, rather than the cold dust,consistent with it being a goodtracer of star formation. the first maps of $r_{3-2/1-0}$, h$_2$ mass surfacedensity and sfe have been made for the inner 2.4 kpc radius region. only 20\%of the sf occurs in this region and excitation conditions are typical of galaxydisks, rather than of central starbursts. the sfe suggests long gas consumptiontimescales ($&gt;$ $10^9$ yr).  the velocity field is dominated by a steeply rising rotation curve in theregion of the central molecular ring followed by a flatter curve in the disk. avery steep gradient in the rotation curve is observed at the nucleus, providingthe first evidence for a central concentration of mass:m$_{dyn}\,=\,5\,\times\,10^7$ m$_\odot$ within a radius of 282 pc. the velocityfield shows anomalous features indicating the presence of molecular outflows;one of them is associated with a previously observed co(j=1-0) expanding shell.consistent with these outflows is the presence of a thick ($z$ up to $1.4$ kpc)co(j=3-2) disk. we suggest that the interaction between ngc~4631 and itscompanion(s) has agitated the disk and also initiated star formation which waslikely higher in the past than it is now. these may be necessary conditions forseeing prominent halos.

1009.3279	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey iv. velocity dispersions in the  molecular interstellar medium in spiral galaxies	an analysis of large-area co j=3-2 maps from the james clerk maxwelltelescope for 12 nearby spiral galaxies reveals low velocity dispersions in themolecular component of the interstellar medium. the three lowest luminositygalaxies show a relatively flat velocity dispersion as a function of radiuswhile the remaining nine galaxies show a central peak with a radial fall-offwithin 0.2-0.4 r(25). correcting for the average contribution due to theinternal velocitydispersions of a population of giant molecular clouds, theaverage cloud-cloud velocity dispersion across the galactic disks is 6.1 +/-1.0 km/s (standard deviation 2.9 km/s), in reasonable agreement with previousmeasurements for the galaxy andm33. the cloud-cloud velocity dispersion derivedfrom the co data is on average two times smaller than the hi velocitydispersion measured in the same galaxies. the low cloud-cloudvelocitydispersion implies that the molecular gas is the critical component determiningthe stability of the galactic disk against gravitational collapse, especiallyin those regions of the disk which are h2 dominated. the cloud-cloud velocitydispersion shows a significant positivecorrelation with both the far-infraredluminosity, which traces the star formation activity, and the k-band absolutemagnitude, which traces the total stellar mass. for three galaxies in the virgocluster, smoothing the data to a resolution of 4.5 kpc (to match the typicalresolution of high redshift co observations) increases the measured velocitydispersion by roughly a factor of two, comparable to the dispersion measuredrecently in a normal galaxy at z=1. this comparison suggests that the mass andstar formation rate surface densities may be similar in galaxies from z=0-1 andthat the high star formation rates seen at z=1 may be partly due to thepresence of physically larger molecular gas disks.

0709.0814	a morphological and statistical analysis of ansae in barred galaxies	many barred galaxies show a set of symmetric enhancements at the ends of thestellar bar, called {\it ansae}, or the ``handles'' of the bar. the ansa barshave been in the literature for some decades, but their origin has still notbeen specifically addressed, although, they could be related to the growthprocess of bars. but even though ansae have been known for a long time, nostatistical analysis of their relative frequency of occurrence has beenperformed yet. similarly, there has been no study of the varieties inmorphology of ansae even though significant morphological variations are knownto characterise the features. in this paper, we make a quantitative analysis ofthe occurrence of ansae in barred galaxies, making use of {\it the devaucouleurs atlas of galaxies} by buta and coworkers. we find that $\sim 40%$of sb0's show ansae in their bars, thus confirming that ansae are commonfeatures in barred lenticulars. the ansa frequency decreases dramatically withlater types, and hardly any ansae are found in galaxies of type sb or later.the bars in galaxies with ansae are stronger in the median than those ingalaxies without ansae, but the presence of inner and outer rings is notrelated to the presence of ansae. implications of these results and theoriesfor the possible origin of ansae are discussed briefly.

1111.6447	overview of the near-ir s0 galaxy survey (nirs0s)	a review of the results of the near-ir s0 galaxy survey (nirs0s) ispresented. nirs0s is a magnitude (mb 12.5 mag) and inclination (&lt; 65o) limitedsample of 200 nearby galaxies, mainly s0s. it uses deep ks -band images,typically reaching a surface brightness of 23.5 mag arcsec^(-2) . detailedvisual and photometric classifications were made, for the first time codingalso the lenses in a systematic manner. as a comparison sample, a similar sizedspiral galaxy sample with similar image quality was used. the main emphasiswere to study whether the s0s are former spirals in which star formation hasbeen ceased, and also, how robust are bars in galaxies. based on our analysisthe hubble sequence was revisited: following the early idea by van den bergh wesuggested that the s0s are spread throughout the hubble sequence in paralleltuning forks as spirals (s0a, s0b, s0c etc.). this is evidenced by our improvedbulge-to-total (b/t) flux ratios, reaching as small values as typically foundin late-type spirals. the properties of bulges and disks in s0s were found tobe similar to those in spirals. also, the masses and scale parameters of thebulges and disks were found to be coupled. bars were found to be fairly robustboth in s0s and spirals, but inspite of that bars might evolve significantlywithin the hubble sequence.

1210.6409	hydrogen volume densities in nearby galaxies i - an automated approach	using a simple model of photodissociated atomic hydrogen on a galactic scale,it is possible to derive total hydrogen volume densities. these densities,obtained through a combination of atomic hydrogen, far-ultraviolet andmetallicity data, provide an independent probe of the combined atomic andmolecular hydrogen gas in galactic disks. we present a new, flexible and fullyautomated procedure using this simple model. this automated method will allowus to take full advantage of a host of available data on galaxies in order tocalculate total hydrogen volume densities of giant molecular clouds surroundingsites of recent star formation. so far this was only possible on agalaxy-by-galaxy basis using by-eye analysis of candidate photodissociationregions. we test the automated method by adopting different models for thedust-to-gas ratio and comparing the resulting densities for m74, including anew metallicity map of m74 produced by integral field spectroscopy. we test theprocedure against previously published m83 volume densities based on the samemethod and find no significant differences. the range of total hydrogen volumedensities obtained for m74 is approximately 5-700 cm-3 . different dust-to-gasratio models do not result in measurably different densities. the clouddensities presented here add m74 to the list of galaxies analyzed using theassumption of photodissociated atomic hydrogen occurring near sites of recentstar formation and further solidify the method. for the first time, fullmetallicity maps were included in the analysis as opposed to metallicitygradients. the results will need to be compared to other tracers of theinterstellar medium and photodissociation regions, such as co and cii, in orderto test our basic assumptions, specifically, our assumption that the hi wedetect originates in photodissociation regions.

1304.6083	the impact of bars on disk breaks as probed by s4g imaging	we have analyzed the radial distribution of old stars in a sample of 218nearby face-on disks, using deep 3.6um images from the spitzer survey ofstellar structure in galaxies (s4g). in particular, we have studied thestructural properties of those disks with a broken or down-bending profile. wefind that, on average, disks with a genuine single exponential profile have ascale-length and a central surface brightness which are intermediate to thoseof the inner and outer components of a down-bending disk with the same totalstellar mass. in the case of barred galaxies, the ratio between the break andthe bar radii (rbr/rbar) depends strongly on the total stellar mass of thegalaxy. for galaxies more massive than 10^10 msun, the distribution is bimodal,peaking at rbr/rbar~2 and ~3.5. the first peak, which is the most populatedone, is linked to the outer lindblad resonance of the bar, whereas the secondone is consistent with a dynamical coupling between the bar and the spiralpattern. for galaxies below 10^10 msun, breaks are found up to ~10 rbar, but weshow that they could still be caused by resonances given the rising nature ofrotation curves in these low-mass disks. while not ruling out star formationthresholds, our results imply that radial stellar migration induced bynon-axysymmetric features can be responsible not only for those breaks at 2rbar, but also for many of those found at larger radii.

1309.1444	morphological parameters of spitzer survey of stellar structure in  galaxies (s4g)	the morphology of galaxies can be quantified to some degree using a set ofscale-invariant parameters. concentration (c), asymmetry (a), smoothness (s),the gini index (g), relative contribution of the brightest pixels to the secondorder moment of the flux (m20), ellipticity (e), and the gini index of thesecond order moment (gm) have all been applied to morphologically classifygalaxies at various wavelengths. here we present a catalog of these parametersfor the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g), a volume-limitednear-infrared imaging survey of nearby galaxies using the 3.6 and 4.5 micronchannels of the irac camera. our goal is to provide a reference catalog ofnear-infrared quantified morphology for high-redshift studies and galaxyevolution models with enough detail to resolve stellar mass morphology.  we explore where normal, non-interacting galaxies -those typically found onthe hubble tuning fork- lie in this parameter space and show that there is atight relation between concentration and m20 for normal galaxies. m20 can beused to classify galaxies into earlier and later types (e.g., to separatespirals from irregulars). several criteria using these parameters exist toselect systems with a disturbed morphology, i.e., those that appear to beundergoing a tidal interaction. we examine the applicability of these criteriato spitzer near-infrared imaging. we find that four relations, based on theparameters a&amp;s, g&amp;m20, gm, and c&amp;m20, respectively, select outliers in themorphological parameter space, but each selects different subsets of galaxies.two criteria (gm &gt; 0.6, g &gt; -0.115 x m20 + 0.384) seem most appropriate toidentify possible mergers and the merger fraction in near-infrared surveys. wefind no strong relation between lopsidedness and most of these morphologicalparameters, except for a weak dependence of lopsidedness on concentration andm20.

1311.2041	the circumnuclear environment of ngc613: a nuclear starburst caught in  the act?	we present near-infrared ($h$- and $k$-band) integral-field observations ofthe inner $\sim$700pc of the active spiral galaxy ngc613, obtained with sinfonion the very large telescope. we use emission-line ratios to determine thedominant excitation mechanisms in different regions within our field-of-view,in particular the active nucleus and the star-forming circum-nuclear ring.diagnostic diagrams involving [feii] and h$_2$ fluxes indicate that the gas isnot only photoionized by the agn in the nucleus of ngc613, but alsoshock-heated. on the other hand, the emission line ratios measured in the ``hotspots'' along the ring are fully consistent with them being young star formingregions. we find no sign of radial gas transport from the ring into the coreregion dominated by the agn. the ring morphology appears disturbed by a radialoutflow of material from the agn, which is confirmed by the existence of a weakjet in archival radio maps. however, this jet does not seem to have anysignificant effect on the morphology of the large ($\sim$8$\times$10$^7$ solarmasses) reservoir of molecular gas that has accumulated inside the central$\sim$100pc. such a concentration of molecular gas around an agn is unusual,and supports a scenario in which star formation is recurrent and episodic inspiral galaxies. in this context, ngc613 appears to be in final stages of thegas accumulation phase, and is likely to undergo a nuclear starburst in thenear future.

1312.0866	arrakis: atlas of resonance rings as known in the s4g	resonance rings are the consequence of secular evolution processes thatredistribute material and angular momentum in discs. we produced a catalogueand an atlas of the rings detected in the spitzer survey of stellar structurein galaxies (s4g) and to conduct a statistical study of the data in thecatalogue.  we traced the contours of rings previously identified by buta et al. (inpreparation) and fitted them with ellipses. we found the orientation of bars bystudying the galaxy ellipse fits from s4g's pipeline 4. we used the galaxyorientation data obtained by s4g's pipeline 4 to obtain intrinsic ellipticitiesand orientations of rings and the bars.  arrakis contains data on 724 ringed galaxies in the s4g. the frequency ofresonance rings in the s4g is of 16+-1% and 35+-1% for outer and innerfeatures, respectively. outer rings are mostly found in hubble stages -1&lt;=t&lt;=4.inner rings are found in a distribution that covers the range -1&lt;=t&lt;=7. weconfirm that outer rings have two preferred orientations, parallel andperpendicular to the bar. we confirm a tendency for inner rings to be orientedparallel to the bar, but we find that a significant fraction (~50%) of themhave random orientations with respect to the bar. these misaligned inner ringsare mostly found in late-type galaxies (t&gt;=4). this may be due to spiral modesdecoupled from the bar dominating the fourier amplitude spectrum at the radiusof the inner ring.  we find that the fraction of barred galaxies hosting outer (inner) rings is~1.7 times (~1.3 times) that in unbarred galaxies. the fact that rings are onlymildly favoured by bars suggests that those in unbarred galaxies either formeddue to weak departures from the axisymmetry of the galactic potential or thatthey are born because of bars that have been destroyed after the ringformation.

1501.01377	spectroscopic variability of two oe stars	the oe stars hd45314 and hd60848 have recently been found to exhibit verydifferent x-ray properties: whilst hd60848 has an x-ray spectrum and emissionlevel typical of most ob stars, hd45314 features a much harder and brighterx-ray emission, making it a so-called gamma cas analogue. monitoring theoptical spectra could provide hints towards the origin of these very differentbehaviours. we analyse a large set of spectroscopic observations of hd45314 andhd60848, extending over 20 years. we further attempt to fit the h-alpha lineprofiles of both stars with a simple model of emission line formation in akeplerian disk. strong variations in the strengths of the h-alpha, h-beta, andhe i 5876 emission lines are observed for both stars. in the case of hd60848,we find a time lag between the variations in the equivalent widths of theselines. the emission lines are double peaked with nearly identical strengths ofthe violet and red peaks. the h-alpha profile of this star can be successfullyreproduced by our model of a disk seen under an inclination of 30 degrees. inthe case of hd45314, the emission lines are highly asymmetric and displaystrong line profile variations. we find a major change in behaviour between the2002 outburst and the one observed in 2013. this concerns both the relationshipbetween the equivalent widths of the various lines and their morphologies atmaximum strength (double-peaked in 2002 versus single-peaked in 2013). oursimple disk model fails to reproduce the observed h-alpha line profiles ofhd45314. our results further support the interpretation that oe stars do havedecretion disks similar to those of be stars. whilst the emission lines ofhd60848 are explained by a disk with a keplerian velocity field, the disk ofhd45314 seems to have a significantly more complex velocity field that could berelated to the phenomenon that produces its peculiar x-ray emission.

0805.0222	on the morphology of sigma-drop galaxies	context: local reductions of the stellar velocity dispersion in the centralregions of galaxies are known as sigma-drops. knowing the origin of thesefeatures can lead to better understanding of inner galactic dynamics.  aims: we present a sample of 20 sigma-drop galaxies matched with a controlsample of galaxies without sigma-drop in order to search for correlationsbetween sigma-drops and the properties, primarily morphological, of the nuclearzones and discs of their host galaxies.  methods: we study the dust and halpha distribution at 0.1 arcsec scale, usinghubble space telescope imaging, in the circumnuclear zones of the two samplesof galaxies, searching for differences and trying to establish a link betweenthe nuclear kinematics and the host morphology. we have also considered the coand hi emission of the galaxies and their luminosity profiles.  results: we classify the two samples following both morphological parametersand the luminosity profiles. we find a larger fraction of nuclear dust spiralsand halpha rings in the sigma-drop sample. we also find that the fraction ofseyfert galaxies in the sigma-drop sample is bigger than that of liners andthat the reverse is true for the control sample.  conclusions: our findings are evidence that a $\sigma$-drop is very probablydue to inflow-induced star formation in a dynamically cool disc, or in a gasring, shock focused by an inner lindblad resonance above a certain criticaldensity level. the same mechanism that feeds the nuclear ring or the nucleardisc is probably reponsible for the higher rate of seyfert galaxies among the$\sigma$-drop hosts.

1504.08001	the balrog project - i. quantifying the influence of bars on the  kinematics of nearby galaxies	we present the balrog (bars in low redshift optical galaxies) sample of 16morphologically distinct barred spirals to characterise observationally theinfluence of bars on nearby galaxies. each galaxy is a mosaic of severalpointings observed with the ifu spectrograph sauron leading to a tenfoldsharper spatial resolution (~100 pc) compared to ongoing ifu surveys. in thispaper we focus on the kinematic properties. we calculate the bar strength qbfrom classical torque analysis using 3.6 {\mu}m spitzer (s4g) images, but alsodevelop a new method based solely on the kinematics. a correlation between thetwo measurements is found and backed up by n-body simulations, verifying themeasurement of qb . we find that bar strengths from ionised gas kinematics are~2.5 larger than those measured from stellar kinematics and that stronger barshave enhanced influence on inner kinematic features. we detect that stellarangular momentum "dips" at 0.2$\pm$0.1 bar lengths and half of our sampleexhibits an anti-correlation of h3 - stellar velocity (v/{\sigma}) in thesecentral parts. an increased flattening of the stellar {\sigma} gradient withincreasing bar strength supports the notion of bar-induced orbit mixing. thesemeasurements set important constraints on the spatial scales, namely anincreasing influence in the central regions (0.1-0.5 bar lengths), revealed bykinematic signatures due to bar-driven secular evolution in present daygalaxies.

1505.01837	stellar population synthesis models between 2.5 and 5 {\mu}m based on  the empirical irtf stellar library	we present the first single-burst stellar population models in the infraredwavelength range between 2.5 and 5 {\mu}m which are exclusively based onempirical stellar spectra. our models take as input 180 spectra from thestellar irtf (infrared telescope facility) library. our final single-burststellar population models are calculated based on two different sets ofisochrones and various types of initial mass functions of different slopes,ages larger than 1 gyr and metallicities between [fe/h] = -0.70 and 0.26. theyare made available online to the scientific community on the miles web page. weanalyse the behaviour of the spitzer [3.6]-[4.5] colour calculated from oursingle stellar population models and find only slight dependences on bothmetallicity and age. when comparing to the colours of observed early-typegalaxies, we find a good agreement for older, more massive galaxies thatresemble a single-burst population. younger, less massive and more metal-poorgalaxies show redder colours with respect to our models. this mismatch can beexplained by a more extended star formation history of these galaxies whichincludes a metal-poor or/and young population. moreover, the colours derivedfrom our models agree very well with most other models available in thiswavelength range. we confirm that the mass-to-light ratio determined in thespitzer [3.6] {\mu}m band changes much less as a function of both age andmetallicity than in the optical bands.

1512.05768	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey x. environmental effects on the  molecular gas and star formation properties of spiral galaxies	we present a study of the molecular gas properties in a sample of 98 hi -flux selected spiral galaxies within $\sim25$ mpc, using the co $j=3-2$ lineobserved with the james clerk maxwell telescope. we use the technique ofsurvival analysis to incorporate galaxies with co upper limits into ourresults. comparing the group and virgo samples, we find a larger mean h$_{2}$mass in the virgo galaxies, despite their lower mean hi mass. this leads to asignificantly higher h$_{2}$ to hi ratio for virgo galaxies. combining our datawith complementary h$\alpha$ star formation rate measurements, virgo galaxieshave longer molecular gas depletion times compared to group galaxies, due totheir higher h$_{2}$ masses and lower star formation rates. we suggest that thelonger depletion times may be a result of heating processes in the clusterenvironment or differences in the turbulent pressure. from the full sample, wefind that the molecular gas depletion time has a positive correlation with thestellar mass, indicative of differences in the star formation process betweenlow and high mass galaxies, and a negative correlation between the moleculargas depletion time and the specific star formation rate.

astro-ph;0003359	populations of high-luminosity density-bounded h ii regions in spiral  galaxies? evidence and implications	(abridged) we present evidence that the hii regions of high luminosity indisk galaxies may be density bounded, so that a significant fraction of theionizing photons emitted by their exciting ob stars escape from the regions.the key piece of evidence is the presence, in the h\alpha luminosity functions(lfs) of the populations of hii regions, of glitches, local sharp peaks at anapparently invariant luminosity, defined as the stromgren luminosity (l_ str),l_h\alpha = l_str = 10^38.6 (\pm 10^0.1) erg/s (no other peaks are found in anyof the lfs) accompanying a steepening of slope for l_h\alpha&gt; l_str. thisbehavior is readily explicable via a physical model whose basic premises are:(a) the transition at l_h\alpha = l_str marks a change from essentiallyionization bounding at low luminosities to density bounding at higher values,(b) for this to occur the law relating stellar mass in massive star-formingclouds to the mass of the placental cloud must be such that the ionizing photonflux produced within the cloud is a function which rises more steeply than themass of the cloud. supporting evidence for the hypothesis of this transition ispresented. if confirmed, the density-bounding hypothesis would imply that thedensity-bounded regions were the main sources of the photons which ionize thediffuse gas in disk galaxies. we estimate that these regions emit sufficientlyman continuum not only to ionize the diffuse medium, but to cause a typicalspiral to emit significant ionizing flux into the intergalactic medium. the lowscatter observed in l_str, less than 0.1 mag rms in the still quite smallsample measured to date, is an invitation to widen the data base, and tocalibrate against primary standards, with the aim of obtaining a precisestandard candle.

astro-ph;0106019	the gravitational torque of bars in optically unbarred and barred  galaxies	the relative bar torques for 45 galaxies observed at $k$- band with the 4.2mwilliam herschel telescope are determined by transforming the lightdistributions into potentials and deriving the maximum ratios of the tangentialforces relative to the radial forces. the results are combined with the bartorques for 30 other galaxies determined from our previous $k$-band survey(buta &amp; block 2001). relative bar torques determine the degree of spiral armforcing, gas accretion, and bar evolution. they differ from other measures ofbar strength, such as the relative amplitude of the bar determinedphotometrically, because they include the bulge and other disk light thatcontributes to the radial component of the total force. if the bulge is strongand the radial forcing large, then even a prominent bar can have a relativelyweak influence on the azimuthal motions in the disk. here we find that therelative bar torque correlates only weakly with the optical bar type listed inthe revised shapley-ames and de vaucouleurs systems. in fact, some classicallybarred galaxies have weaker relative bar torques than classically unbarredgalaxies. the optical class is a poor measure of azimuthal disk forcing for tworeasons: some infrared bars are not seen optically, and some bars with strongbulges have their azimuthal forces so strongly diluted by the average radialforce that they exert only small torques on their disks. the hubbleclassification scheme poorly recognizes the gravitational influence of bars.applications of our bar torque method to the high-redshift universe are brieflydiscussed.

astro-ph;0107407	penetrating the mask: the gravitational torque of bars	the hubble classification scheme of galaxies is based on blue-lightappearance. atlases reveal the rich variety of responses of the population icomponent (the "mask") of gas and dust to the underlying, older, stellarpopulation. however, the population i component may only constitute 5 percentof the dynamical mass of the galaxy; furthermore, dusty masks are highlyeffective in hiding bars. in the 1960s, ken freeman presented a meticulousstudy of the dynamics of bars at a time when nonbarred galaxies were called"normal" spirals and barred galaxies were regarded as curiosities. now we knowthat it is more "normal" for a galaxy to be barred than to be nonbarred. whatis the range for gravitational torques of bars? we describe here a recentlydeveloped method for deriving relative bar torques by using gravitationalpotentials inferred from near-infrared light distributions. we incorporate abar torque class into the block/puerari dust-penetrated galaxy classificationsystem. we find a huge overlap in relative bar torque between hubble (sa, sb,  ...) and (sba, sbb, ...) classifications. application of the method to thehigh redshift universe is briefly discussed.

astro-ph;0305427	a technique for separating the gravitational torques of bars and spirals  in disk galaxies	we describe a fourier-based method of separating bars from spirals innear-infrared images. the method takes advantage of the fact that a bar istypically a feature with a relatively fixed position angle, and uses the simpleassumption that the relative fourier amplitudes due to the bar decline withradius past a maximum in the same or a similar manner as they rose to thatmaximum. with such an assumption, the bar can be extrapolated into the spiralregion and removed from an image, leaving just the spiral and the axisymmetricbackground disk light. the procedure allows us to estimate the maximumgravitational torque per unit mass per unit square of the circular speed forthe bar and spiral forcing separately, parameters which quantitatively definethe bar strength q_b and the spiral strength q_s following the recent study ofbuta &amp; block. we outline the complete procedure here using a 2.1 micron imageof ngc 6951, a prototypical sab(rs)bc spiral. we justify our assumption on howto make the bar extrapolation using an analysis of ngc 4394, a barred spiralwith only weak near-infrared spiral structure, and we justify the number ofneeded fourier terms using ngc 1530, one of the most strongly-barred galaxies(bar class 7) known. we also evaluate the main uncertainties in the technique.allowing for uncertainties in vertical scaleheight, bar extrapolation, skysubtraction, orientation parameters, and the asymmetry in the spiral armsthemselves, we estimate q_b=0.28\pm0.04 and q_s=0.21\pm0.06 for ngc 6951.(abridged)

astro-ph;0405227	gravitational bar and spiral arm torques from k_s-band observations and  implications for the pattern speeds	we have obtained deep near-infrared k_s-band william herschel telescopeobservations of a sample of 15 nearby spiral galaxies having a range of hubbletypes and apparent bar strengths. the near-infrared light distributions areconverted into gravitational potentials, and the maximum relative gravitationaltorques due to the bars and the spirals are estimated. we find that spiralstrength, q_s, and bar strength, q_b, correlate well with other measures ofspiral arm and bar amplitudes, and that spiral and bar strengths also correlatewell with each other. we also find a correlation between the position angle ofthe end of the bar and the position angle of the inner spiral. thesecorrelations suggest that the bars and spirals grow together with the samerates and pattern speeds. we also show that the strongest bars tend to have themost open spiral patterns. because open spirals imply high disk-to-halo massratios, bars and spirals most likely grow together as a combined diskinstability. they stop growing for different reasons, however, giving theobserved variation in bar-spiral morphologies. bar growth stops because ofsaturation when most of the inner disk is in the bar, and spiral growth stopsbecause of increased stability as the gas leaves and the outer disk heats up.

astro-ph;0405541	stellar disk truncations: where do we stand ?	in the light of several recent developments we revisit the phenomenon ofgalactic stellar disk truncations. even 25 years since the first paper on outerbreaks in the radial light profiles of spiral galaxies, their origin is stillunclear. the two most promising explanations are that these 'outer edges'either trace the maximum angular momentum during the galaxy formation epoch, orare associated with global star formation thresholds. depending on their truephysical nature, these outer edges may represent an improved sizecharacteristic (e.g., as compared to d_25) and might contain fossil evidenceimprinted by the galaxy formation and evolutionary history. we will addressseveral observational aspects of disk truncations: their existence, not only innormal hsb galaxies, but also in lsb and even dwarf galaxies; their detailedshape, not sharp cut-offs as thought before, but in fact demarcating the startof a region with a steeper exponential distribution of starlight; theirpossible association with bars; as well as problems related to theline-of-sight integration for edge-on galaxies (the main targets for truncationsearches so far). taken together, these observations currently favour thestar-formation threshold model, but more work is necessary to implement thetruncations as adequate parameters characterising galactic disks.

astro-ph;0408267	evolution and impact of bars over the last eight billion years: early  results from gems	bars drive the dynamical evolution of disk galaxies by redistributing massand angular momentum, and they are ubiquitous in present-day spirals. earlystudies of the hubble deep field reported a dramatic decline in the rest-frameoptical bar fraction f_opt to below 5% at redshifts z&gt;0.7, implying that disksat these epochs are fundamentally different from present-day spirals. the gemsbar project, based on ~8300 galaxies with hst-based morphologies and accurateredshifts over the range 0.2-1.1, aims at constraining the evolution and impactof bars over the last 8 gyr. we present early results indicating that f_optremains nearly constant at ~30% over the range z=0.2-1.1,corresponding tolookback times of ~2.5-8 gyr. the bars detected at z&gt;0.6 are primarily strongwith ellipticities of 0.4-0.8. remarkably, the bar fraction and range of barsizes observed at z&gt;0.6 appear to be comparable to the values measured in thelocal universe for bars of corresponding strengths. implications for barevolution models are discussed.

astro-ph;0408382	bar evolution over the last eight billion years: a constant fraction of  strong bars in gems	one third of present-day spirals host optically visible strong bars thatdrive their dynamical evolution. however, the fundamental question of how barsevolve over cosmological times has yet to be addressed, and even the frequencyof bars at intermediate redshifts remains controversial. we investigate thefrequency of bars out to z~1.0 drawing on a sample of 1590 galaxies from thegems survey, which provides morphologies from hst acs two-color images, andhighly accurate redshifts from the combo-17 survey. we identify spiral galaxiesusing the sersic index, concentration parameter, and rest-frame color. wecharacterize bars and disks by fitting ellipses to f606w and f850lp images,taking advantage of the two bands to minimize bandpass shifting. we excludehighly inclined (i&gt;60 deg) galaxies to ensure reliable morphologicalclassifications, and apply completeness cuts of m_v &lt;= -19.3 and -20.6. morethan 40% of the bars that we detect have semi major axes a&lt;0.5" and would beeasily missed in earlier surveys without the small psf of acs. the bars that wecan reliably detect are fairly strong (with ellipticities e&gt;=0.4) and have a inthe range ~1.2-13 kpc. we find that the optical fraction of such strong barsremains at ~(30% +- 6%) from the present-day out to look-back times of 2-6 gyr(z~0.2-0.7) and 6-8 gyr (z~0.7-1.0); it certainly shows no sign of a drasticdecline at z&gt;0.7. our findings of a large and similar bar fraction at thesethree epochs favor scenarios in which cold gravitationally unstable disks arealready in place by z~1, and where on average bars have a long lifetime (wellabove 2 gyr). the distributions of structural bar properties in the two slicesare, however, not statistically identical and therefore allow for thepossibility that the bar strengths and sizes may evolve over time.

astro-ph;0409031	structure and star formation in disk galaxies iii. nuclear and  circumnuclear h alpha emission	from h alpha images of a carefully selected sample of 57 relatively large,northern spiral galaxies with low inclination, we study the distribution of theh alpha emission in the circumnuclear and nuclear regions. at a resolution ofaround 100 parsec, we find that the nuclear h alpha emission in the samplegalaxies is often peaked, and significantly more often so among agn hostgalaxies. the circumnuclear h alpha emission, within a radius of two kpc, isoften patchy in late-type, and absent or in the form of a nuclear ring inearly-type galaxies. there is no clear correlation of nuclear or circumnuclearh alpha morphology with the presence or absence of a bar in the host galaxy,except for the nuclear rings which occur in barred hosts. the presence orabsence of close bright companion galaxies does not affect the circumnuclear halpha morphology, but their presence does correlate with a higher fraction ofnuclear h alpha peaks. nuclear rings occur in at least 21% (+-5%) of spiralgalaxies, and occur predominantly in galaxies also hosting an agn. only two ofour 12 nuclear rings occur in a galaxy which is neither an agn nor a starbursthost. we confirm that weaker bars host larger nuclear rings. the implicationsof these results on our understanding of the occurrence and morphology ofmassive star formation, as well as non-stellar activity, in the central regionsof galaxies are discussed.

astro-ph;0410386	the h-alpha galaxy survey ii. extinction and nii corrections to h-alpha  fluxes	we study the two main corrections generally applied to narrow-band h-alphafluxes from galaxies in order to convert them to star formation rates, namelyfor nii contamination and for extinction internal to the galaxy. from animaging study using narrow-band filters, we find the nii and h-alpha emissionto be differently distributed. in most disk star formation regions the niifraction is small, whereas some galaxies display a diffuse central componentwhich can be dominated by nii emission. we consider explanations for variationsin the nii/h-alpha ratio, including metallicity variations and differentexcitation mechanisms. we then estimate the extinction towards star formationregions in spiral galaxies, firstly using br-gamma/h-alpha line ratios. we findthat extinction values are larger in galaxy nuclei than in disks, and thatthere is no evidence for heavily dust-embedded regions emerging in the near-ir.we use optical emission line data from the literature to show only a moderatedependence of extinction on inclination, consistent with broad-band photometricstudies; typical extinctions are smaller for late-type dwarfs than for spiraltypes. finally, we show that the application of type-dependent extinctioncorrections significantly improves the agreement between star formation ratesfrom h-alpha and iras fluxes. this agreement argues against star formation innormal galaxies being dominated by heavily dust-embedded components.

astro-ph;9905076	a subarcsecond resolution near-infrared study of seyfert and `normal'  galaxies: i. imaging data	we present new high-resolution near-infrared observations in the j,h and kbands, obtained to study the properties of seyfert host galaxies. the datasetconsists of images in the three bands of practically the entire cfa sample ofseyfert galaxies, and k-band images of a control sample of non-active,`normal', galaxies, matched to the seyfert sample in the distribution of typeand inclination. the spatial resolution and sampling of the new images is afactor 2 better than previously published k-band data. in this paper, wepresent the data in the form of profiles of surface brightness and color,ellipticity and major axis position angle, as well as greyscale maps of surfacebrightness in h or k and both j-h and h-k colors. we compare our surfacebrightness and color profiles with the literature, and find good agreement.  our data are discussed in detail in three subsequent publications, where weanalyze the morphologies of seyfert and normal hosts, quantify the strength ofnonaxisymmetric features in disks and their relationship to nuclear activity,address the question of bar fraction in seyferts and normal galaxies, andanalyze the color information in the framework of emission mechanisms inseyfert 1s and 2s, and in non-active galaxies.

astro-ph;9909007	kinematics of ionized and molecular hydrogen in the core of m100	we present high angular and velocity resolution two-dimensional kinematicobservations in the spectral lines of h alpha and co j=1-0 of the circumnuclearstarburst region in the barred spiral galaxy m100, and compare them withkinematics derived from our previously published numerical modeling. the halpha data, fully sampled and at sub-arcsecond resolution, show a rotationcurve that is rapidly rising in the central ~140 pc, and stays roughlyconstant, at the main disk value, further out. non-circular motions are studiedfrom the h alpha and co data by detailed consideration of the velocity fields,residual velocity fields after subtraction of the rotation curve, and sets ofposition-velocity diagrams. these motions are interpreted as the kinematicsignatures of gas streaming along the inner part of the bar, and of densitywave streaming motions across a two-armed mini-spiral. comparison with atwo-dimensional velocity field and rotation curve derived from our 1995dynamical model shows good qualitative and quantitative agreement for thecircular and non-circular kinematic components. both morphology and kinematicsof this region require the presence of a double inner lindblad resonance inorder to explain the observed twisting of the near-infrared isophotes and thegas velocity field. these are compatible with the presence of a global densitywave driven by the moderately strong stellar bar in this galaxy. we reviewrecent observational and modeling results on the circumnuclear region in m100,and discuss the implications for bar structure and gas dynamics in the core ofm100 and other disk galaxies.

0812.1718	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey i. star forming molecular gas in  virgo cluster spiral galaxies	we present large-area maps of the co j=3-2 emission obtained at the jamesclerk maxwell telescope for four spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster. wecombine these data with published co j=1-0, 24 micron, and halpha images tomeasure the co line ratios, molecular gas masses, and instantaneous gasdepletion times. for three galaxies in our sample (ngc 4254, ngc4321, and ngc4569), we obtain molecular gas masses of 7e8-3e9 msun and disk-averagedinstantaneous gas depletion times of 1.1-1.7 gyr. we argue that the co j=3-2line is a better tracer of the dense star forming molecular gas than the coj=1-0 line, as it shows a better correlation with the star formation ratesurface density both within and between galaxies. ngc 4254 appears to have alarger star formation efficiency(smaller gas depletion time), perhaps becauseit is on its first passage through the virgo cluster. ngc 4569 shows alarge-scale gradient in the gas properties traced by the co j=3-2/j=1-0 lineratio, which suggests that its interaction with the intracluster medium isaffecting the dense star-forming portion of the interstellar medium directly.the fourth galaxy in our sample, ngc 4579, has weak co j=3-2 emission despitehaving bright 24 micron emission; however, much of the central luminosity inthis galaxy may be due to the presence of a central agn.
