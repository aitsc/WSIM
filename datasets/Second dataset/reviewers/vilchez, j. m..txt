0907.0084	on the electron temperatures in high-metallicity hii regions	the electron temperatures of high-metallicity (12+log(o/h) &gt; 8.2) hii regionshave been studied. the empirical ff relations which express the nebular-to-auroral [oiii] line ratio q_3,o (as well as the nebular-to-auroral [oii] lineratio q_2,o, and the nebular-to-auroral [nii] line ratio q_2,n) in terms of thenebular r_3 and r_2 line fluxes in spectra of high-metallicity hii regions arederived, and the electron temperatures t_3,o, t_2,o, and t_2,n in a number ofextragalactic hii regions are also determined. furthermore, the t_2 - t_3diagram is discussed. it is found that there is a one-to-one correspondencebetween t_2 and t_3 electron temperatures for hii regions with a weak nebularr_3 lines (logr_ &lt; 0.5). the derived t_2,n - t_3,o relation for these hiiregions is similar to commonly used t_2 - t_3 relations. the hii regions with astrong nebular r_3 line flux (logr_3 &gt; 0.5) do not follow this relation. adiscrepancy between t_2,n and t_2,o temperatures is found, being the t_2,ntemperatures systematically lower than t_2,o ones. the differences are small atlow electron temperatures and increases with increasing electron temperaturesup to 10% at t=1. the uncertainties in the atomic data may be the cause of thisdiscrepancy.

0907.1370	star forming galaxies in the hercules cluster: halpha imaging of a2151	this paper presents the first results of an halpha imaging survey of galaxiesin the central regions of the a2151 cluster. a total of 50 sources weredetected in halpha. the morphologies of the 43 h$\alpha$ selected galaxiesrange from grand design spirals and interacting galaxies to blue compacts andtidal dwarfs or isolated extragalactic hii regions, spanning a range ofmagnitudes of -21 &lt;= mb &lt;= -12.5 mag. a comparison with the clusters coma anda1367 and a sample of field galaxies has shown the presence of cluster galaxieswith l(halpha) lower than expected for their mb, a consecuence of the clusterenvironment. this fact results in differences in the  l(halpha) vs. ew(halpha) and l(h\alpha) distributions of the clusters withrespect to the field, and in cluster to cluster variations of these quantities,which we propose are driven by a global cluster property as the total mass.overall, we conclude that both, the global cluster environment as well as thecluster merging history play a non negligible role in the integral starformation properties of clusters of galaxies.

0911.3006	spatially resolved study of the physical properties of the ionized gas  in ngc 595	we present integral field spectroscopy (ifs) of ngc 595, one of the mostluminous hii regions in m33. this type of observations allows studying thevariation of the principal emission-line ratios across the surface of thenebula. at each position of the field of view, we fit the main emission-linefeatures of the spectrum within the spectral range 3650-6990a, and create mapsof the principal emission-line ratios for the total surface of the region. theextinction map derived from the balmer decrement and the absorbed h-alphaluminosity show good spatial correlation with the 24 micron emission fromspitzer. we also show here the capability of the ifs to study the existence ofwolf-rayet (wr) stars, identifying the previously catalogued wr stars anddetecting a new candidate towards the north of the region. the ionizationstructure of the region nicely follows the h-alpha shell morphology and isclearly related to the location of the central ionizing stars. the electrondensity distribution does not show strong variations within the hii region norany trend with the h-alpha emission distribution. we study the behaviour withinthe hii region of several classical emission-line ratios proposed asmetallicity calibrators: while [nii]/ha and [nii]/[oiii] show importantvariations, the r23 index is substantially constant across the surface of thenebula, despite the strong variation of the ionization parameter as a functionof the radial distance from the ionizing stars. these results show thereliability in using the r23 index to characterize the metallicity of hiiregions even when only a fraction of the total area is covered by theobservations.

0708.2642	on the metallicity dependence of the 24micron luminosity as a star  formation tracer	we investigate the use of the rest-frame 24microns luminosity as an indicatorof the star formation rate (sfr) in galaxies with different metallicities bycomparing it to the (extinction corrected) halpha luminosity. we carry out thisanalysis in 2 steps: first, we compare the emission from hii regions indifferent galaxies with metallicities between 12+log(o/h) = 8.1 and 8.9. wefind that the 24microns and the extinction corrected halpha luminosities fromindividual hii regions follow the same correlation for all galaxies,independent of their metallicity. second, the role of metallicity is exploredfurther for the integrated luminosity in a sample of galaxies withmetallicities in the range of 12+log(o/h) = 7.2 - 9.1. for this sample wecompare the 24microns and halpha luminosities integrated over the entiregalaxies and find a lack of the 24microns emission for a given halphaluminosity for low metallicity objects, likely reflecting a low dust content.these results suggest that the 24microns luminosity is a good metallicityindependent tracer for the sfr in individual hii regions. on the other hand,metallicity has to be taken into account when using the 24microns luminosity asa tracer for the sfr of entire galaxies.

1101.2447	fossil groups origins: i. rx j105453.3+552102 a very massive and relaxed  system at z~0.5	the most accepted scenario for the origin of fossil groups (fgs) is that theyare galaxy associations in which the merging rate was fast and efficient. thesesystems have assembled half of their mass at early epoch of the universe,subsequently growing by minor mergers. they could contain a fossil record ofthe galaxy structure formation. we have started a project in order tocharacterize a large sample of fgs. in this paper we present the analysis ofthe fossil system rx j105453.3+552102. optical deep images were used forstudying the properties of the brightest group galaxy and for computing thephotometric luminosity function of the group. we have also performed a detaildynamical analysis of the system based on redshift data for 116 galaxies. thisgalaxy system is located at z=0.47, and shows a quite large line-of-sightvelocity dispersion \sigma_{v}~1000 km/s. assuming the dynamical equilibrium,we estimated a virial mass of m ~ 10^{15} h_{70} m_{\odot}. no evidence ofsubstructure was found within 1.4 mpc radius. we found a statisticallysignificant departure from gaussianity of the group members velocities in themost external regions of the group. this could indicate the presence ofgalaxies in radial orbits in the external region of the group. we also foundthat the photometrical luminosity function is bimodal, showing a lack of m_{r}~ -19.5 galaxies. the brightest group galaxy shows low sersic parameter (n~2)and a small peculiar velocity. indeed, our accurate photometry shows that thedifference between the brightest and the second brightest galaxies is 1.9 magin the r-band, while the classical definition of fgs is based on a magnitudegap of 2. we conclude that this fossil system does not follow the empiricaldefinition of fgs. nevertheless, it is a massive, old and undisturbed galaxysystem with little infall of l^{*} galaxies since its initial collapse.

1109.1392	sdss galaxies with double-peaked emission lines: double starbursts or  agns?	with the aim of investigating galaxies with two strong simultaneousstarbursts, we have extracted a sample of galaxies with double-peaked emissionlines in their global spectra from the sdss spectral database. we then fittedthe emission lines halpha, hbeta, [oiii]5007, [nii]6584, [sii]6717 and[sii]6731 of 129 spectra by two gaussians to separate the radiation of the two(blue and red) components. a more or less reliable decomposition of the allthose emission lines have been found for 55 spectra. using a standard bptclassification diagram, we have been able to divide the galaxies from oursample into two subsamples: sample a consisting of 18 galaxies where bothcomponents belong to the photoionised class of objects, and sample b containing37 galaxies which show non-thermal ionisation (agns). we have examined theproperties of the blue and red components, and found that the differencesbetween radial velocities of components lie within 200 - 400 km/s for galaxiesof both subsamples. the equivalent number of ionising stars is in the range10^4 - 10^5 o7v stars for each component in the galaxies of sample a. we haveestimated the oxygen and nitrogen abundances as well as the electrontemperatures for each component using the recent ns-calibration and from globalspectra for galaxies from sample a using both the ns and on-calibration. wehave found that the global oxygen abundance is typically in between themeasured abundances of individual components for our sample of galaxies, andthat both calibrations provide consistent global abundances. finally, wesuggest the classical o/h -- n/o diagram is used to test the reliability of thedividing lines between starburst-like objects and agns in the so-called bptdiagram.

1110.0465	fossil groups origins ii. unveiling the formation of the brightest group  galaxies through their scaling relations	(abridged) fossil systems are galaxy associations dominated by a relativelyisolated, bright elliptical galaxy, surrounded by a group of smaller galaxieslacking l* objects. we analyzed the near-infrared photometric and structuralproperties of a sample of 20 bggs present in fgs in order to better understandtheir formation mechanisms. their surface-brightness distribution was fitted toa sersic profile using the gasp2d algorithm. then, the standard scalingrelations were derived for the first time for these galaxies and compared withthose of normal ellipticals and brightest cluster galaxies in non-fossilsystems. the bggs presented in this study represent a subset of the mostmassive galaxies in the universe. we found that their ellipticity profiles arecontinuously increasing with the galactocentric radius. our fossil bcgs followclosely the fundamental plane described by normal ellipticals. however, theydepart from both the log \sigma_0 vs. log l_{k_{s}} and log r_{\rm e} vs. logl_{k_{s}} relations described by intermediate mass ellipticals. this occurs inthe sense that our bggs have larger effective radii and smaller velocitydispersions than those predicted by these relations. we also found that moreelliptical galaxies systematically deviate from the previous relations whilemore rounder object do not. no similar correlation was found with the sersicindex. the derived scaling relations can be interpreted in terms of theformation scenario of the bggs. because our bggs follow the fundamental planetilt but they have larger effective radii than expected for intermediate massellipticals, we suggest that they only went through dissipational mergers in aearly stage of their evolution and then assembled the bulk of their massthrough subsequent dry mergers, contrary to previous claims that bggs in fgswere formed mainly by the merging of gas-rich galaxies.

1201.1554	abundance determination from global emission-line sdss spectra:  exploring objects with high n/o ratios	we have compared the oxygen and nitrogen abundances derived from globalemission-line sdss spectra of galaxies using (1) the te method and (2) tworecent strong line calibrations: the on and ns calibrations. using the temethod, anomously high n/o abundances ratios have been found in some sdssgalaxies. to investigate this, we have monte carlo simulated the global spectraof composite nebulae by a mix of spectra of individual components, based onspectra of well-studied hii regions in nearby galaxies. we found that the temethod results in an underestimated oxygen abundance (and hence in anoverestimated nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio) if hii regions with different physicalproperties contribute to the global spectrum of composite nebulae. this effectis somewhat similar to the small-scale temperature fluctuations in hii regionsdiscussed by peimbert. our work thus suggests that the high te-based n/oabundances ratios found in sdss galaxies may not be real. however, such aneffect is not expected to be present in dwarf galaxies since they havegenerally an uniform chemical composition. the on and ns calibrations give oand n abundances in composite nebulae which agree with the meanluminosity-weighted abundances of their components to within 0.2 dex.

1201.2697	uv to fir catalogue of a galaxy sample in nearby clusters: seds and  environmental trends	in this paper, we present a sample of cluster galaxies devoted to study theenvironmental influence on the star-formation activity. this sample of galaxiesinhabits in clusters showing a rich variety in their characteristics and havebeen observed by the sdss-dr6 down to m_b ~ -18 and by the galex ais throughoutsky regions corresponding to several megaparsecs. we assign the broad-band andemission-line fluxes from ultraviolet to far-infrared to each galaxy performingan accurate spectral energy distribution for spectral fitting analysis. theclusters follow the general x-ray luminosity vs. velocity dispersion trend ofl_x/sigma_c^4.4. the analysis of the distributions of galaxy density countingup to the 5th nearest neighbor sigma_5 shows: (1) the virial regions and thecluster outskirts share a common range in the high density part of thedistribution. this can be attributed to the presence of massive galaxystructures in the surroundings of virial regions (2) the virial regions ofmassive clusters (sigma_c&gt;550 km s^-1) present a sigma_5 distributionstatistically distinguishable (~96%) from the corresponding distribution oflowmass clusters (sigma_c&lt;550 km s^-1). both massive and low-mass clustersfollow a similar density-radius trend, but the low-mass clusters avoid the highdensity extreme. we illustrate, with abell 1185, the environmental trends ofgalaxy populations. maps of sky projected galaxy density show howlow-luminosity star-forming galaxies appear distributed along more spreadstructures than their giant counterparts, whereas low-luminosity passivegalaxies avoid the low-density environment. giant passive and star-forminggalaxies share rather similar sky regions with passive galaxies exhibiting moreconcentrated distributions.

1304.0191	the metallicity - redshift relations for emission-line sdss galaxies:  examination of the dependence on the star formation rate	we analyse the oxygen abundance and specific star formation rates (ssfr)variations with redshift in star-forming sdss galaxies of different masses. wefind that the maximum value of the ssfr, ssfrmax, decreases when the stellarmass, ms, of a galaxy increases, and decreases with decreasing of redshift. thessfrmax can exceed the time-averaged ssfr by about an order of magnitude formassive galaxies. the metallicity - redshift relations for subsamples ofgalaxies with ssfr = ssfrmax and with ssfr = 0.1ssfrmax coincide for massive(log(ms/mo) &gt; 10.5, with stellar mass ms in solar units) galaxies and differfor low-mass galaxies. this suggests that there is no correlation betweenoxygen abundance and ssfr in massive galaxies and that the oxygen abundancecorrelates with the ssfr in low-mass galaxies. we find evidence in favour ofthat the irregular galaxies show, on average, higher ssfr and lower oxygenabundances than the spiral galaxies of similar masses and that the mass -metallicity relation for spiral galaxies differs slightly from that forirregular galaxies. the fact that our sample of low-mass galaxies is themixture of spiral and irregular galaxies can be responsible for the dependenceof the metallicity - redshift relation on the ssfr observed for the low-masssdss galaxies. the mass - metallicity and luminosity - metallicity relationsobtained for irregular sdss galaxies agree with corresponding relations fornearby irregular galaxies with direct abundance determinations. we find thatthe aperture effect does not make a significant contribution to the redshiftvariation of oxygen abundances in sdss galaxies.

1304.2158	the mass-metallicity relation explored with califa: i. is there a  dependence on the star formation rate?	we present the results on the study of the global and local m-z relationbased on the first data available from the califa survey (150 galaxies). thissurvey provides integral field spectroscopy of the complete optical extent ofeach galaxy (up to 2-3 effective radii), with enough resolution to separateindividual hii regions and/or aggregations. nearly $\sim$3000 individual hiiregions have been detected. the spectra cover the wavelength range between[oii]3727 and [sii]6731, with a sufficient signal-to-noise to derive the oxygenabundance and star-formation rate associated with each region. in addition, wehave computed the integrated and spatially resolved stellar masses (and surfacedensities), based on sdss photometric data. we explore the relations betweenthe stellar mass, oxygen abundance and star-formation rate using this dataset.  we derive a tight relation between the integrated stellar mass and thegas-phase abundance, with a dispersion smaller than the one already reported inthe literature ($\sigma_{\delta{\rm log(o/h)}}=$0.07 dex). indeed, thisdispersion is only slightly larger than the typical error derived for ouroxygen abundances. however, we do not find any secondary relation with thestar-formation rate, other than the one induced due to the primary relation ofthis quantity with the stellar mass. we confirm the result using the $\sim$3000individual hii regions, for the corresponding local relations.  our results agree with the scenario in which gas recycling in galaxies, bothlocally and globally, is much faster than other typical timescales, like thatof gas accretion by inflow and/or metal loss due to outflows. in essence,late-type/disk dominated galaxies seem to be in a quasi-steady situation, witha behavior similar to the one expected from an instantaneousrecycling/closed-box model.

1304.5154	uncovering multiple wolf-rayet star-clusters and the ionized ism in  mrk178: the closest metal-poor wolf-rayet hii galaxy	new integral field spectroscopy (ifs) has been obtained for the nearbymetal-poor wr galaxy mrk178 to examine the spatial correlation between its wrstars and the neighbouring ionized ism. the strength of the broad wr featuresand its low metallicity make mrk178 an intriguing object. we have detected theblue and red wr bumps in different locations across the fov (~ 300 pc x 230 pc)in mrk178. the study of the wr content has been extended, for the first time,beyond its brightest star-forming knot uncovering new wr star-clusters. usingsmc/lmc-template wr stars we empirically estimate a minimum of ~ 20 wr starswithin the region sampled. maps of the spatial distribution of theemission-lines and of the physical-chemical properties of the ionized ism havebeen created and analyzed. here we refine the statistical methodology byperez-montero et al.(2011) to probe the presence of variations in the ismproperties. an error-weighted mean of 12+log(o/h)=7.72 +/- 0.01 is taken as therepresentative oxygen abundance for mrk178. a localized n and he enrichment,spatially correlated with wr stars, is suggested by this analysis. nebularheii4686 emission is shown to be spatially extended reaching well beyond thelocation of the wr stars. this spatial offset between wrs and heii emission canbe explained based on the mechanical energy input into the ism by the wr starwinds, and does not rule out wr stars as the heii ionization source. we studysystematic aperture effects on the detection and measurement of the wrfeatures, using sdss spectra combined with the power of ifs. in this regard,the importance of targeting low metallicity nearby systems is discussed.

1306.2338	nebular emission and the lyman continuum photon escape fraction in  califa early-type galaxies	we use deep integral field spectroscopy data from the califa survey to studythe warm interstellar medium (wim) of 32 nearby early-type galaxies (etgs). wepropose a tentative subdivision of our sample etgs into two groups, accordingto their ha equivalent width (ew) and lyman continuum (lyc) photon escapefraction (plf). type i etgs show nearly constant ews and a plf~0, suggestingthat photoionization by post-agb stars is the main driver of their faintextranuclear nebular emission. type ii etgs are characterized by very low,outwardly increasing ews, and a plf as large as ~0.9 in their centers. suchproperties point to a low, and inwardly decreasing wim density and/or volumefilling factor. we argue that, because of extensive lyc photon leakage,emission-line luminosities and ews are reduced in type ii etg nuclei by atleast one order of magnitude. consequently, the line weakness of these etgs isby itself no compelling evidence for their containing merely "weak"(sub-eddington accreting) active galactic nuclei (agn). in fact, lyc photonescape, which has heretofore not been considered, may constitute a key elementin understanding why many etgs with prominent signatures of agn activity inradio continuum and/or x-ray wavelengths show only faint emission lines andweak signatures of agn activity in their optical spectra. the lyc photonescape, in conjunction with dilution of nuclear ews by line-of-sightintegration through a triaxial stellar host, can systematically impededetection of agn in gas-poor galaxy spheroids through optical emission-linespectroscopy. we further find that type i and ii etgs differ little (~0.4 dex)in their mean bpt line ratios, which in both cases are characteristic ofliners. this potentially hints at a degeneracy of the projected,luminosity-weighted bpt ratios for the specific 3d properties of the wim inetgs.

1311.7052	a characteristic oxygen abundance gradient in galaxy disks unveiled with  califa	we present the largest and most homogeneous catalog of hii regions andassociations compiled so far. the catalog comprises more than 7000 ionizedregions, extracted from 306 galaxies observed by the califa survey. we describethe procedures used to detect, select, and analyse the spectroscopic propertiesof these ionized regions. in the current study we focus on the characterizationof the radial gradient of the oxygen abundance in the ionized gas, based on thestudy of the deprojected distribution of hii regions. we found that allgalaxies without clear evidence of an interaction present a common gradient inthe oxygen abundance, with a characteristic slope of alpha = -0.1 dex/rebetween 0.3 and 2 disk effective radii, and a scatter compatible with randomfluctuations around this value, when the gradient is normalized to the diskeffective radius. the slope is independent of morphology, incidence of bars,absolute magnitude or mass. only those galaxies with evidence of interactionsand/or clear merging systems present a significant shallower gradient,consistent with previous results. the majority of the 94 galaxies with h iiregions detected beyond 2 disk effective radii present a flattening in theoxygen abundance. the flattening is statistically significant. we cannotprovide with a conclusive answer regarding the origin of this flattening.however, our results indicate that its origin is most probably related to thesecular evolution of galaxies. finally, we find a drop/truncation of the oxygenabundance in the inner regions for 26 of the galaxies. all of them arenon-interacting, mostly unbarred, sb/sbc galaxies. this feature is associatedwith a central star-forming ring, which suggests that both features areproduced by radial gas flows induced by resonance processes.

1312.1346	star formation activity and gas stripping in the cluster projected  phase-space (cpps)	this work is focused on the study of the distribution in the cpps of passiveand star-forming galaxy populations and also, the intense and quiescentstar-forming populations for a set of 9 nearby z&lt;0.05 galaxy clusters.furthermore, we compare the cpps distribution of the passive galaxy populationwith the accreted halo population of a set of 28 simulated clusters and thestar-forming population with the non-accreted population. we consider variouscluster accretion epochs and accretion radii where it is assumed that starformation in galaxies becomes quenched, in order to segregate the accretedpopulation from the non-accreted population. just applying this segregation insimulations, we get a qualitative agreement between the cpps distributions ofthe passive and the accreted populations and also between the star-forming andthe non-accreted populations. the uncertainty in cluster centering stronglyaffects the pronounced cuspy profiles of the projected density and also, it canexplain the main difference (i.e. inner slope) between the cpps distribution ofpassive and accreted populations. the cpps density of star-forming galaxies andthe intensity of ram-pressure stripping present an opposite trend throughoutthe cpps. this implies that ram-pressure stripping significantly contributes tomodulate the observed cpps distribution of star-forming galaxies inside andaround cluster virial regions. the significant fraction of star-forminggalaxies at the projected center of clusters are mainly those galaxies with lowl-o-s velocities and they can be mainly identified as those galaxies with aremaining star formation activity (quiescent star-forming galaxies) inside thephysical virial region or, in a lower degree, as galaxy interlopers i.e.outside the physical virial region.(abridged)

1403.0588	fossil groups origins iii. characterization of the sample and  observational properties of fossil systems	(abridged) fossil systems are group- or cluster-sized objects whoseluminosity is dominated by a very massive central galaxy. in the current colddark matter scenario, these objects formed hierarchically at an early epoch ofthe universe and then slowly evolved until present day. that is the reason whythey are called {\it fossils}. we started an extensive observational program tocharacterize a sample of 34 fossil group candidates spanning a broad range ofphysical properties. deep $r-$band images were taken for each candidate andoptical spectroscopic observations were obtained for $\sim$ 1200 galaxies. thisnew dataset was completed with sdss dr7 archival data to obtain robust clustermembership and global properties of each fossil group candidate. for eachsystem, we recomputed the magnitude gaps between the two brightest galaxies($\delta m_{12}$) and the first and fourth ranked galaxies ($\delta m_{14}$)within 0.5 $r_{{\rm 200}}$. we consider fossil systems those with $\deltam_{12} \ge 2$ mag or $\delta m_{14} \ge 2.5$ mag within the errors. we findthat 15 candidates turned out to be fossil systems. their observationalproperties agree with those of non-fossil systems. both follow the samecorrelations, but fossils are always extreme cases. in particular, they hostthe brightest central galaxies and the fraction of total galaxy light enclosedin the central galaxy is larger in fossil than in non-fossil systems. finally,we confirm the existence of genuine fossil clusters. combining our results withothers in the literature, we favor the merging scenario in which fossil systemsformed due to mergers of $l^\ast$ galaxies. the large magnitude gap is aconsequence of the extreme merger ratio within fossil systems and therefore itis an evolutionary effect. moreover, we suggest that at least one candidate inour sample could represent a transitional fossil stage.

1502.00522	the extended heii4686-emitting region in izw18 unveiled: clues for  peculiar ionizing sources	new integral field spectroscopy has been obtained for izw18, the nearbylowest-metallicity galaxy considered our best local analog of systems formingat high-z. here we report the spatially resolved spectral map of the nebularheii4686 emission in izw18, from which we derived for the first time its totalheii-ionizing flux. nebular heii emission implies the existence of a hardradiation field. heii-emitters are observed to be more frequent among high-zgalaxies than for local objects. so investigating the heii-ionizing source(s)in izw18 may reveal the ionization processes at high-z. heii emission instar-forming galaxies, has been suggested to be mainly associated withwolf-rayet stars (wrs), but wrs cannot satisfactorily explain theheii-ionization at all times, in particular at lowest metallicities. shocksfrom supernova remnants, or x-ray binaries, have been proposed as additionalpotential sources of heii-ionizing photons. our data indicate that conventionalheii-ionizing sources (wrs, shocks, x-ray binaries) are not sufficient toexplain the observed nebular heii4686 emission in izw18. we find that theheii-ionizing radiation expected from models for either low-metallicitysuper-massive o stars or rotating metal-free stars could account for theheii-ionization budget measured, while only the latter models could explain thehighest values of heii4686/hbeta observed. the presence of such peculiar starsin izw18 is suggestive and further investigation in this regard is needed. thisletter highlights that some of the clues of the early universe can be foundhere in our cosmic backyard.

1506.03076	fossil group origins v. the dependence of the luminosity function on the  magnitude gap	in nature we observe galaxy aggregations that span a wide range of magnitudegaps between the two first-ranked galaxies of a system ($\delta m_{12}$). thereare systems with gaps close to zero (e.g., the coma cluster), and at the otherextreme of the distribution, the largest gaps are found among the so-calledfossil systems. fossil and non-fossil systems could have different galaxypopulations that should be reflected in their luminosity functions. in thiswork we study, for the first time, the dependence of the luminosity functionparameters on $\delta m_{12}$ using data obtained by the fossil group origins(fogo) project. we constructed a hybrid luminosity function for 102 groups andclusters at $z \le 0.25$. we stacked all the individual luminosity functions,dividing them into bins of $\delta m_{12}$, and studied their best-fitschechter parameters. we additionally computed a relative luminosity function,expressed as a function of the central galaxy luminosity, which boosts ourcapacity to detect differences, especially at the bright end. we find trends asa function of $\delta m_{12}$ at both the bright and faint ends of theluminosity function. in particular, at the bright end, the larger the magnitudegap, the fainter the characteristic magnitude $m^\ast$. we also finddifferences at the faint end. in this region, the larger the gap, the flatterthe faint-end slope $\alpha$. the differences found at the bright end support adissipationless, dynamical friction-driven merging model for the growth of thecentral galaxy in group- and cluster-sized halos. the differences in the faintend cannot be explained by this mechanism. other processes, such as enhancedtidal disruption due to early infall and/or prevalence of eccentric orbits, mayplay a role. however, a larger sample of systems with $\delta m_{12} &gt; 1.5$ isneeded to establish the differences at the faint end.

1507.03801	star formation in the local universe from the califa sample. i.  calibrating the sfr using ifs data	the star formation rate (sfr) is one of the main parameters used to analyzethe evolution of galaxies through time. the need for recovering the lightreprocessed by dust commonly requires the use of low spatial resolutionfar-infrared data. recombination-line luminosities provide an alternative,although uncertain dust-extinction corrections based on narrow-band imaging orlong-slit spectroscopy have traditionally posed a limit to their applicability.integral field spectroscopy (ifs) is clearly the way to overcome suchlimitation. we obtain integrated h{\alpha}, ultraviolet (uv) and infrared(ir)-based sfr measurements for 272 galaxies from the califa survey at 0.005 &lt;z &lt; 0.03 using single-band and hybrid tracers. we provide updated calibrations,both global and split by properties (including stellar mass and morphologicaltype), referred to h{\alpha}. the extinction-corrected h{\alpha} luminosityagrees with the updated hybrid sfr estimators based on either uv or h{\alpha}plus ir luminosity over the full range of sfrs (0.03-20 m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$).the coefficient that weights the amount of energy produced by newly-born starsthat is reprocessed by dust on the hybrid tracers, a$_{ir}$, shows a largedispersion. however, it does not became increasingly small at highattenuations, as expected if significant highly-obscured h$\alpha$ emissionwould be missed. lenticulars, early-type spirals and type-2 agn host galaxiesshow smaller coefficients due to the contribution of optical photons and agn todust heating. in the local universe the h{\alpha} luminosity derived from ifsobservations can be used to measure sfr, at least in statistically-significant,optically-selected galaxy samples. the analysis of the sfr calibrations bygalaxies properties could be potentially used by other works to study theimpact of different selection criteria in the sfr values derived.

1509.00180	localized starbursts in dwarf galaxies produced by impact of low  metallicity cosmic gas clouds	models of galaxy formation predict that gas accretion from the cosmic web isa primary driver of star formation over cosmic history. except in very denseenvironments where galaxy mergers are also important, model galaxies feed fromcold streams of gas from the web that penetrate their dark matter haloes.although these predictions are unambiguous, the observational support has beenindirect so far. here we report spectroscopic evidence for this process inextremely metal-poor galaxies (xmps) of the local universe, taking the form oflocalized starbursts associated with gas having low metallicity. detailedabundance analyses based on gran telescopio canarias (gtc) optical spectra often xmps show that the galaxy hosts have metallicities around 60 % solar onaverage, while the large star-forming regions that dominate their integratedlight have low metallicities of some 6 % solar. because gas mixes azimuthallyin a rotation timescale (a few hundred myr), the observed metallicityinhomogeneities are only possible if the metal-poor gas fell onto the diskrecently. we analyze several possibilities for the origin of the metal-poorgas, favoring the metal-poor gas infall predicted by numerical models. if thisinterpretation is correct, xmps trace the cosmic web gas in their surroundings,making them probes to examine its properties.

astro-ph;0210225	on the origin of nitrogen	the problem of the origin of nitrogen is considered within the framework ofan empirical approach. the oxygen abundances and nitrogen to oxygen abundancesratios are derived in hii regions of a number of spiral galaxies through therecently suggested p-method using more than six hundred published spectra. then/o - o/h diagram for hii regions in irregular and spiral galaxies isconstructed. it is found that the n/o values in hii regions of spiral galaxiesof early morphological types are higher than those in hii regions with the samemetallicity in spiral galaxies of late morphological types. this suggests along-time-delayed contribution to the nitrogen production. the n/o ratio of agalaxy can then be used as an indicator of the time that has elapsed since thebulk of star formation occurred, or in other words of the nominal "age" of thegalaxy as suggested by edmunds and pagel more than twenty years ago. thescatter in n/o values at a given o/h can be naturally explained by differencesin star formation histories in galaxies. while low-metallicity dwarf galaxieswith low n/o do not contain an appreciable amount of old stars, low-metallicitydwarf galaxies with an appreciable fraction of old stars have high n/o.consideration of planetary nebulae in the small magellanic cloud and in themilky way galaxy suggests that the contribution of low-mass stars to thenitrogen production is significant, confirming the conclusion that there is along-time-delayed contribution to the nitrogen production.

astro-ph;0304062	on emission-line spectra obtained from evolutionary synthesis models i.  dispersion in the ionising flux and lowest luminosity limits	(abriged) stellar clusters with the same general physical properties (e.g.,total mass, age, and star-formation mode) may have very different stellar massspectra due to the incomplete sampling of the underlying mass function; suchdifferences are especially relevant in the high-mass tail due to the smallerabsolute number of massive stars. the dispersion in the number of massive starsalso produces a dispersion in the properties of the corresponding ionisingspectra. in this paper, we lay the bases for the future analysis of this effectby evaluating the dispersion in the ionising fluxes of synthetic spectra. as animportant consequence, we found that the intensities of synthetic fluxes atdifferent ionisation edges are strongly correlated, a fact suggesting that noadditional dispersion will result from the inclusion of sampling effects in theanalysis of diagnostic diagrams; this is true for hii regions on all scales.additionally, we find convincing suggestions that the he ii lines are stronglyaffected by sampling, and so cannot be used to constrain the evolutionarystatus of stellar clusters. we also establish the range of applicability ofsynthesis models set by the lowest luminosity limit for the ionising flux, thatis the lowest limit in cluster mass for which synthesis models can be appliedto predict ionising spectra. this limit marks the boundary between thesituations in which the ionising flux is better modeled with a single star asopposed to a star cluster; this boundary depends on the metallicity and age,ranging from 10^3 to more than 10^6 mo. as a consequence, synthesis modelsshould not be used to try to account for the properties of clusters withsmaller masses.

astro-ph;0306307	deep near infrared mapping of young and old stars in blue compact dwarf  galaxies	we analyze j, h and ks near-infrared data for 9 blue compact dwarf (bcd)galaxies, selected from a larger sample that we have already studied in theoptical. we present contour maps, surface brightness and color profiles, aswell as color maps of the sample galaxies. the morphology of the bcds in thenir has been found to be basically the same as in the optical. the innerregions of these systems are dominated by the starburst component. at lowsurface brightness levels the emission is due to the underlying host galaxy;the latter is characterized by red, radially constant colors and isophotes wellfit by ellipses. we derive accurate optical near--infrared host galaxy colorsfor eight of the sample galaxies; these colors are typical of an evolvedstellar population. interestingly, optical near--infrared color maps reveal thepresence of a complex, large-scale absorption pattern in three of the samplegalaxies. we study the applicability of the sersic law to describe the surfacebrightness profiles of the underlying host galaxy, and find that, because ofthe limited surface brightness interval over which the fit can be made, thederived sersic parameters are very sensitive to the selected radial intervaland to errors in the sky subtraction. fitting an exponential model givesgenerally more stable results, and can provide a useful tool to quantify thestructural properties of the host galaxy and compare them with those of otherdwarf classes as well as with those of star-forming dwarfs at higher redshifts.

astro-ph;0405312	chemical abundances in spiral and irregular galaxies. o and n abundances  derived from global emission--line spectra	the validity of oxygen and nitrogen abundances derived from the globalemission-line spectra of galaxies via the p-method has been investigated usinga collection of published spectra of individual hii regions in irregular andspiral galaxies. the conclusions of kobulnicky, kennicutt &amp; pizagno (1999) thatglobal emission-line spectra can reliably indicate the chemical properties ofgalaxies has been confirmed. it has been shown that the comparison of theglobal spectrum of a galaxy with a collection of spectra of individual hiiregions can be used to distinguish high and low metallicity objects and toestimate accurate chemical abundances in a galaxy. the oxygen and nitrogenabundances in samples of uv-selected and normal nearby galaxies have beendetermined. it has been found that the uv-selected galaxies occupy the samearea in the n/o -- o/h diagram as individual hii regions in nearby galaxies.finally, we show that intermediate-redshift galaxies systematically deviatefrom the metallicity -- luminosity trend of local galaxies.

astro-ph;0407014	oxygen and nitrogen abundances in nearby galaxies. correlations between  oxygen abundance and macroscopic properties	we performed a compilation of more than 1000 published spectra of hii regionsin spiral galaxies. the oxygen and nitrogen abundances in each hii region wererecomputed in a homogeneous way, using the p-method. the radial distributionsof oxygen and nitrogen abundances were derived. the correlations between oxygenabundance and macroscopic properties are examined. there is a significantdifference between the l-z relationship obtained here and that based on theoxygen abundances determined through the r_23-calibrations. the oxygenabundance of ngc 5457 recently determined using direct measurements of te(kennicutt, bresolin &amp; garnett 2003) agrees with the l-z relationship derivedhere, but is in conflict with the l-z relationship derived with the r_23-basedoxygen abundances. the obtained l-z relation for spirals is compared to thatfor irregulars. our sample of galaxies shows evidence that the slope of theo/h-m_b relationship for spirals is slightly more shallow than that forirregulars. the effective oxygen yields were estimated for spiral and irregulargalaxies. the effective oxygen yield increases with increasing luminosity fromm_b=-11 to m_b=-18 (or with increasing rotation velocity from vrot=10 km/s tovrot=100 km/s) and then remains approximately constant. irregular galaxies fromour sample have effective oxygen yields lowered by a factor of 3 at maximum,i.e. irregular galaxies usually keep at least 1/3 of the oxygen theymanufactured during their evolution.

astro-ph;0504549	structural parameters of dwarf galaxies in the coma cluster: on the  origin of ds0 galaxies	in this paper we analyze the structural parameters of the dwarf galaxies inthe coma cluster with $-18 \le m_{b} \le -16$ and classify them in two types:those with surface brightness profiles well fitted by a single sersic law werecalled dwarf ellipticals (des), and those fitted with sersic-plus-exponentialprofiles were classified as dwarf lenticulars (ds0s). the comparison of thestructural parameters of the dwarf galaxies in the coma and virgo clustersshows that they are analogous. photometrically, the de and ds0 galaxies in comaare equivalent, having similar colors and global scales. however, the scale ofthe innermost parts (bulges) of ds0 galaxies is similar to the bulges oflate-type spiral galaxies. in contrast, des have larger scales than the bulgesof bright galaxies. this may indicate that ds0 and de galaxies have differentorigins. while de galaxies can come from dwarf irregulars (dis) or from similarprocesses as bright es, the origin of ds0 galaxies can be harassed brightlate-type spiral galaxies.

astro-ph;0509588	what is the temperature structure in the giant hii region ngc 588?	we present the results of an exhaustive study of the ionized gas in ngc 588,a giant h ii region in the nearby spiral galaxy m33. this analysis uses a highnumber of diagnostics in the optical and infrared ranges. four temperaturediagnostics obtained with optical lines agree with a gas temperature of 11000k,while the [o iii] 5007/88um ratio yields a much lower temperature of 8000kapproximately. this discrepancy suggests the presence of large temperatureinhomogeneities in the nebula. we investigated the cause of this discrepancy byconstructing photoionization models of increasing complexity. in particular, weused the constraints from the halpha and hbeta surface brightness distributionsand state-of-the-art models of the stellar ionizing spectrum. none of thesuccessive attempts was able to reproduce the discrepancy between thetemperature diagnostics, so the thermal balance of ngc 588 remains unexplained.we give an estimate of the effect of this failure on the o/h and ne/o estimatesand show that o/h is known to within +/-0.2 dex

astro-ph;0602168	distribution of the extinction and star formation in ngc 1569	we investigate spatial the distribution of the intrinsic extinction in thestarburst dwarf galaxy ngc1569 creating an extinction map of the whole galaxyderived from the halpha/hbeta emission line ratio. we differentiate theextinction in the hii regions from the extinction of the diffuse gas. theintrinsic extinction shows considerable variations over the plane of thegalaxy, from negligible extinction up to highest values of a(v)=0.8mag. theextinction map shows small scale clumpy structures possibly due to a clumpydust distribution. we also identify in this map a shell structure, for which weestablish a causal relation with the expanding gas structure produced by thestellar winds coming from the super star clusters (ssc) in the center of thegalaxy. the comparison of the spatial profiles of the extinction, dust andgaseous emissions crossing the border of the shell shows a layered structure;the peak of this halpha distribution lying closest to the ssc a, followedoutwards by the peak of the extinction and at a still larger distances by thebulk of the atomic gas. we suggest that the extinction shell has been producedby the sscs and that it can be explained by the accumulation of dust at theborder of this ionized gas structure.

astro-ph;0606453	a spectroscopic study of the near-ir [siii] lines in a sample of hii  galaxies: chemical abundances	a detailed spectroscopic study, from lambda 3700 a to 1 um, was performed fora sample of 34 hii galaxies in order to derive fundamental parameters for theirhii regions and ionizing sources, as well as gaseous metal abundances. all thespectra included the nebular [siii]9069,9532 a lines, given their importance inthe derivation of the s/h abundance and relevant ionization diagnostics. asystematic method was followed to correct the near-ir [siii] line fluxes forthe effects of the atmospheric transmission.a comparative analysis of thepredictions of the empirical abundance indicators r23 and s23 has beenperformed. the relative hardness of their ionizing sources was studied usingthe eta parameter, and exploring the role played by metallicity. for 22galaxies of the sample a direct value of te[siii] was derived, along with theirionic and total s/h abundances. their ionic and total o/h abundances werederived using direct determinations of te[oiii].for the rest of the objects,the total s/h abundance was derived using s23. the abundance range covered byour sample goes from 1/20 solar up to solar metallicity. the mean s/o ratioderived is log (s/o)=-1.68+/-0.20 dex, 1 sigma below the solar s/o value. thes/o abundance ratio shows no significant trend with o/h over the range ofabundance covered in this work, in agreement with previous findings.there is atrend for hii galaxies with lower gaseous metallicity to present harderionizing spectra. we compared the distribution of the ionic ratios o+/o++ vs.s+/s++ derived for our sample with the predictions of a grid of photoionizationmodels performed for different stellar effective temperatures. this analysisindicates that a large fraction of galaxies in our sample seem to be ionized byextremely hard spectra.

astro-ph;0701332	on the maximum value of the cosmic abundance of oxygen and the oxygen  yield	we search for the maximum oxygen abundance in spiral galaxies. because thismaximum value is expected to occur in the centers of the most luminousgalaxies, we have constructed the luminosity - central metallicity diagram forspiral galaxies, based on a large compilation of existing data on oxygenabundances of hii regions in spiral galaxies. we found that this diagram showsa plateau at high luminosities (-22.3 &lt; m_b &lt; -20.3), with a constant maximumvalue of the gas-phase oxygen abundance 12+log(o/h) ~ 8.87. this providesstrong evidence that the oxygen abundance in the centers of the most luminousmetal-rich galaxies reaches the maximum attainable value of oxygen abundance.since some fraction of the oxygen (about 0.08 dex) is expected to be lockedinto dust grains, the maximum value of the true gas+dust oxygen abundance inspiral galaxies is 12+log(o/h) ~ 8.95. this value is a factor of ~ 2 higherthan the recently estimated solar value. based on the derived maximum oxygenabundance in galaxies, we found the oxygen yield to be about 0.0035, dependingon the fraction of oxygen incorporated into dust grains.
