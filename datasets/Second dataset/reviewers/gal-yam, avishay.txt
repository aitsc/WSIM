0902.3142	type ii supernovae as probes of cosmology	- constraining the cosmological parameters and understanding dark energy havetremendous implications for the nature of the universe and its physical laws.  - the pervasive limit of systematic uncertainties reached by cosmographybased on cepheids and type ia supernovae (sne ia) warrants a search forcomplementary approaches.  - type ii sne have been shown to offer such a path. their distances can bewell constrained by luminosity-based or geometric methods. competing,complementary, and concerted efforts are underway, to explore and exploit thoseobjects that are extremely well matched to next generation facilities.spectroscopic follow-up will be enabled by space- based and 20-40 meter classtelescopes.  - some systematic uncertainties of type ii sne, such as reddening by dust andmetallicity effects, are bound to be different from those of sne ia. theirstellar progenitors are known, promising better leverage on cosmic evolution.in addition, their rate - which closely tracks the ongoing star formation rate- is expected to rise significantly with look- back time, ensuring an adequatesupply of distant examples.  - these data will competitively constrain the dark energy equation of state,allow the determination of the hubble constant to 5%, and promote ourunderstanding of the processes involved in the last dramatic phases of massivestellar evolution.

0906.5355	exploring the optical transient sky with the palomar transient factory	the palomar transient factory (ptf) is a wide-field experiment designed toinvestigate the optical transient and variable sky on time scales from minutesto years. ptf uses the cfh12k mosaic camera, with a field of view of 7.9 deg^2and a plate scale of 1 asec/pixel, mounted on the the palomar observatory48-inch samuel oschin telescope. the ptf operation strategy is devised to probethe existing gaps in the transient phase space and to search for theoreticallypredicted, but not yet detected, phenomena, such as fallback supernovae,macronovae, .ia supernovae and the orphan afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. ptfwill also discover many new members of known source classes, from cataclysmicvariables in their various avatars to supernovae and active galactic nuclei,and will provide important insights into understanding galactic dynamics(through rr lyrae stars) and the solar system (asteroids and near-earthobjects). the lessons that can be learned from ptf will be essential for thepreparation of future large synoptic sky surveys like the large synoptic surveytelescope. in this paper we present the scientific motivation for ptf anddescribe in detail the goals and expectations for this experiment.

0907.1083	variable sodium absorption in a low-extinction type ia supernova	recent observations have revealed that some type ia supernovae exhibitnarrow, time-variable na i d absorption features. the origin of the absorbingmaterial is controversial, but it may suggest the presence of circumstellar gasin the progenitor system prior to the explosion, with significant implicationsfor the nature of the supernova progenitors. we present the third detection ofsuch variable absorption, based on six epochs of high-resolution spectroscopyof the type ia supernova sn 2007le from keck and the het. the data span ~3months, from 5 days before maximum light to 90 days after maximum. we find thatone component of the na d absorption lines strengthened significantly withtime, indicating a total column density increase of ~2.5 x 10^12 cm^-2. thechanges are most prominent after maximum light rather than at earlier timeswhen the uv flux from the sn peaks. as with sn 2006x, we detect no change inthe ca ii h&amp;k lines over the same time period, rendering line-of-sight effectsimprobable and suggesting a circumstellar origin for the absorbing material.unlike the previous two sne exhibiting variable absorption, sn 2007le is nothighly reddened (e_b-v = 0.27 mag), also pointing toward circumstellar ratherthan interstellar absorption. photoionization models show that the data areconsistent with a dense (10^7 cm^-3) cloud or clouds of gas located ~0.1 pcfrom the explosion. these results broadly support the single-degeneratescenario previously proposed to explain the variable absorption, with mass lossfrom a nondegenerate companion star responsible for providing the circumstellargas. we also present tentative evidence for narrow halpha emission associatedwith the sn, which will require followup observations at late times to confirm.[abridged]

0707.0393	supernovae in the subaru deep field: an initial sample, and type ia  rate, out to redshift 1.6	large samples of high-redshift supernovae (sne) are potentially powerfulprobes of cosmic star formation, metal enrichment, and sn physics. we presentinitial results from a new deep sn survey, based on re-imaging in the r, i', z'bands, of the 0.25 deg2 subaru deep field (sdf), with the 8.2-m subarutelescope and suprime-cam. in a single new epoch consisting of two nights ofobservations, we have discovered 33 candidate sne, down to a z'-band magnitudeof 26.3 (ab). we have measured the photometric redshifts of the sn hostgalaxies, obtained keck spectroscopic redshifts for 17 of the host galaxies,and classified the sne using the bayesian photometric algorithm of poznanski etal. (2007) that relies on template matching. after correcting for biases in theclassification, 55% of our sample consists of type ia supernovae and 45% ofcore-collapse sne. the redshift distribution of the sne ia reaches z ~ 1.6,with a median of z ~ 1.2. the core-collapse sne reach z ~ 1.0, with a median ofz ~ 0.5. our sn sample is comparable to the hubble space telescope/goods sampleboth in size and redshift range. the redshift distributions of the sne in thesdf and in goods are consistent, but there is a trend (which requiresconfirmation using a larger sample) for more high-z sne ia in the sdf. thistrend is also apparent when comparing the sn ia rates we derive to those basedon goods data. our results suggest a fairly constant rate at high redshift thatcould be tracking the star-formation rate. additional epochs on this field,already being obtained, will enlarge our sn sample to the hundreds, anddetermine whether or not there is a decline in the sn ia rate at z &gt;~ 1.

1004.0615	core-collapse supernovae from the palomar transient factory: indications  for a different population in dwarf galaxies	we use the first compilation of 72 core-collapse supernovae (sne) from thepalomar transient factory (ptf) to study their observed subtype distribution indwarf galaxies compared to giant galaxies. our sample is the largestsingle-survey, untargeted, spectroscopically classified, homogeneous collectionof core-collapse events ever assembled, spanning a wide host-galaxy luminosityrange (down to m_r ~ -14 mag) and including a substantial fraction (&gt;20%) ofdwarf (m_r &gt;= -18 mag) hosts. we find more core-collapse sne in dwarf galaxiesthan expected and several interesting trends emerge. we use detailedsubclassifications of stripped-envelope core-collapse sne and find that alltype i core-collapse events occurring in dwarf galaxies are either sne ib orbroad-lined sne ic (sne ic-bl), while "normal" sne ic dominate in giantgalaxies. we also see a significant excess of sne iib in dwarf hosts. wehypothesize that in lower metallicity hosts, metallicity-driven mass loss isreduced, allowing massive stars that would have appeared as "normal" sne ic inmetal-rich galaxies to retain some he and h, exploding as ib/iib events. at thesame time, another mechanism allows some stars to undergo extensive strippingand explode as sne ic-bl (and presumably also as long-duration gamma-raybursts). our results are still limited by small-number statistics, and ourmeasurements of the observed n(ib/c)/n(ii) number ratio in dwarf and gianthosts (0.25_{-0.15}^{+0.3} and 0.23_{-0.08}^{+0.11}, respectively; 1 sigmauncertainties) are consistent with previous studies and theoreticalpredictions. as additional ptf data accumulate, more robust statisticalanalyses will be possible, allowing the evolution of massive stars to be probedvia the dwarf-galaxy sn population.

1005.1455	ptf10fqs: a luminous red nova in the spiral galaxy messier 99	the palomar transient factory (ptf) is systematically charting the opticaltransient and variable sky. a primary science driver of ptf is building acomplete inventory of transients in the local universe (distance less than 200mpc). here, we report the discovery of ptf10fqs, a transient in the luminosity"gap" between novae and supernovae. located on a spiral arm of messier 99, ptf10fqs has a peak luminosity of mr = -12.3, red color (g-r = 1.0) and is slowlyevolving (decayed by 1 mag in 68 days). it has a spectrum dominated byintermediate-width h (930 km/s) and narrow calcium emission lines. theexplosion signature (the light curve and spectra) is overall similar to thatofm85ot2006-1, sn2008s, and ngc300ot. the origin of these events is shrouded inmystery and controversy (and in some cases, in dust). ptf10fqs shows someevidence of a broad feature (around 8600a) that may suggest very largevelocities (10,000 km/s) in this explosion. ongoing surveys can be expected tofind a few such events per year. sensitive spectroscopy, infrared monitoringand statistics (e.g. disk versus bulge) will eventually make it possible forastronomers to unravel the nature of these mysterious explosions.

1006.3757	the type ia supernova rate in redshift 0.5--0.9 galaxy clusters	supernova (sn) rates are potentially powerful diagnostics of metal enrichmentand sn physics, particularly in galaxy clusters with their deep,metal-retaining potentials and relatively simple star-formation histories. wehave carried out a survey for supernovae (sne) in galaxy clusters, at aredshift range 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9, using the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on thehubble space telescope. we reimaged a sample of 15 clusters that werepreviously imaged by acs, thus obtaining two to three epochs per cluster, inwhich we discovered five likely cluster sne, six possible cluster sne ia, twohostless sn candidates, and several background and foreground events. keckspectra of the host galaxies were obtained to establish cluster membership. weconducted detailed efficiency simulations, and measured the stellarluminosities of the clusters using subaru images. we derive a cluster sn rateof 0.35 snub +0.17/-0.12 (statistical) \pm0.13 (classification) \pm0.01(systematic) [where snub = sne (100 yr 10^10 l_b_sun)^-1] and 0.112 snum+0.055/-0.039 (statistical) \pm0.042 (classification) \pm0.005 (systematic)[where snum = sne (100 yr 10^10 m_sun)^-1]. as in previous measurements ofcluster sn rates, the uncertainties are dominated by small-number statistics.the sn rate in this redshift bin is consistent with the sn rate in clusters atlower redshifts (to within the uncertainties), and shows that there is, atmost, only a slight increase of cluster sn rate with increasing redshift. thelow and fairly constant sn ia rate out to z~1 implies that the bulk of the ironmass in clusters was already in place by z~1. the recently observed doubling ofiron abundances in the intracluster medium between z=1 and 0, if real, islikely the result of redistribution of existing iron, rather than newproduction of iron.

1008.2754	an emerging class of bright, fast-evolving supernovae with low-mass  ejecta	a recent analysis of supernova (sn) 2002bj revealed that it was an apparentlyunique type ib sn. it showed a high peak luminosity, with absolute magnitudem_r -18.5, but an extremely fast-evolving light curve. it had a rise time of &lt;7days followed by a decline of 0.25 mag per day in b-band, and showed evidencefor very low mass of ejecta (&lt;0.15 m_sun). here we discuss two additionalhistorical events, sn 1885a and sn 1939b, showing similarly fast light curvesand low ejected masses. we discuss the low mass of ejecta inferred from ouranalysis of the sn 1885a remnant in m31, and present for the first time thespectrum of sn 1939b. the old environments of both sn 1885a (in the bulge ofm31) and sn 1939b (in an elliptical galaxy with no traces of star formationactivity), strongly support old white dwarf progenitors for these sne. we findno clear evidence for helium in the spectrum of sn 1939b, as might be expectedfrom a helium-shell detonation on a white dwarf, suggested to be the origin ofsn 2002bj. finally, the discovery of all the observed fast-evolving sne innearby galaxies suggests that the rate of these peculiar sne is at least 1-2 %of all sne.

1009.0960	rapidly decaying supernova 2010x: a candidate ".ia" explosion	we present the discovery, photometric and spectroscopic follow-upobservations of sn 2010x (ptf 10bhp). this supernova decays exponentially withtau_d=5 days, and rivals the current recordholder in speed, sn 2002bj. sn 2010xpeaks at m_r=-17mag and has mean velocities of 10,000 km/s. our light curvemodeling suggests a radioactivity powered event and an ejecta mass of 0.16msun. if powered by nickel, we show that the nickel mass must be very small(0.02 msun) and that the supernova quickly becomes optically thin togamma-rays. our spectral modeling suggests that sn 2010x and sn 2002bj havesimilar chemical compositions and that one of aluminum or helium is present. ifaluminum is present, we speculate that this may be an accretion inducedcollapse of an o-ne-mg white dwarf. if helium is present, all observables of sn2010x are consistent with being a thermonuclear helium shell detonation on awhite dwarf, a ".ia" explosion. with the 1-day dynamic-cadence experiment onthe palomar transient factory, we expect to annually discover a few suchevents.

1009.3829	helium shell detonations on low mass white dwarfs as a possible  explanation for sn 2005e	recently several type ib supernovae (sne; with the prototypical sn 2005e)have been shown to have atypical properties. these sne are faint (absolute peakmagnitude of ~ -15) and fast sne that show unique composition. they areinferred to have low ejecta mass (a few tenths of a solar mass) and to behighly enriched in calcium, but poor in silicon elements and nickel. these snewere therefore suggested to belong to a new class of calcium-rich faint sneexplosions. their properties were proposed to be the result of heliumdetonations that may occur on helium accreting white dwarfs. in this paper wetheoretically study the scenario of helium detonations, and focus on theresults of detonations in accreted helium layers on low mass carbon-oxygen (co)cores. we present new results from one dimensional simulations of suchexplosions, including their light curves and spectra. we find that when thedensity of the helium layer is low enough the helium detonation produces largeamounts of intermediate elements, such as calcium and titanium, together with alarge amount of unburnt helium. our results suggest that the properties ofcalcium-rich faint sne could indeed be consistent with the helium-detonationscenario on small co cores. above a certain density (larger co cores) thedetonation leaves mainly 56ni and unburnt helium, and the predicted spectrumwill unlikely fit the unique features of this class of sne. finally, none ofour studied models reproduces the bright, fast evolving light curves of anothertype of peculiar sne suggested to originate in helium detonations (sne 1885a,1939b and 2002bj).

1010.2211	hubble space telescope studies of nearby type ia supernovae: the mean  maximum light ultraviolet spectrum and its dispersion	we present the first results of an ongoing campaign using the stisspectrograph on-board the hubble space telescope (hst) whose primary goal isthe study of near ultraviolet (uv) spectra of local type ia supernovae (sneia). using events identified by the palomar transient factory and subsequentlyverified by ground-based spectroscopy, we demonstrate the ability to locate andclassify sne ia as early as 16 days prior to maximum light. this enables us totrigger hst in a non-disruptive mode to obtain near uv spectra within a fewdays of maximum light for comparison with earlier equivalent ground-basedspectroscopic campaigns conducted at intermediate redshifts, z ~ 0.5. weanalyze the spectra of 12 type ia supernovae located in the hubble flow with0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.08. although a fraction of our eventual sample, these data,together with archival data, already provide a substantial advance over thatpreviously available. restricting samples to those of similar phase andstretch, the mean uv spectrum agrees reasonably closely with that atintermediate redshift, although some differences are found in the metallicabsorption features. a larger sample will determine whether these differencesreflect possible sample biases or are a genuine evolutionary effect.significantly, the wavelength-dependent dispersion, which is larger in the uv,follows similar trends to that observed at intermediate redshift and is driven,in part, by differences in the various metallic features. while the origin ofthe uv dispersion remains uncertain, our comparison suggests that it mayreflect compositional variations amongst our sample rather than beingpredominantly an evolutionary effect.

1010.2689	caltech core-collapse project (cccp) observations of type iin  supernovae: typical properties and implications for their progenitor stars	type iin supernovae (sne iin) are rare events, constituting only a fewpercent of all core-collapse sne, and the current sample of well observed sneiin is small. here, we study the four sne iin observed by the caltechcore-collapse project (cccp). the cccp sn sample is unbiased to the extent thatobject selection was not influenced by target sn properties. therefore, theseevents are representative of the observed population of sne iin. we find that anarrow p-cygni profile in the hydrogen balmer lines appears to be a ubiquitousfeature of sne iin. our light curves show a relatively long rise time (&gt;20days) followed by a slow decline stage (0.01 to 0.15 mag/day), and a typicalv-band peak magnitude of m_v=-18.4 +/- 1.0 mag. we measure the progenitor starwind velocities (600 - 1400 km/s) for the sne in our sample and derivepre-explosion mass loss rates (0.026 - 0.12 solar masses per year). we compilesimilar data for sne iin from the literature, and discuss our results in thecontext of this larger sample. our results indicate that typical sne iin arisefrom progenitor stars that undergo lbv-like mass-loss shortly before theyexplode.

1011.3512	the extreme hosts of extreme supernovae	we use galex ultraviolet (uv) and optical integrated photometry of the hostsof seventeen luminous supernovae (lsne, having peak m_v &lt; -21) and compare themto a sample of 26,000 galaxies from a cross-match between the sdss dr4 spectralcatalog and galex interim release 1.1. we place the lsne hosts on the galaxynuv-r versus m_r color magnitude diagram (cmd) with the larger sample toillustrate how extreme they are. the lsn hosts appear to favor low-densityregions of the galaxy cmd falling on the blue edge of the blue cloud toward thelow luminosity end. from the uv-optical photometry, we estimate the starformation history of the lsn hosts. the hosts have moderately low starformation rates (sfrs) and low stellar masses (m_*) resulting in high specificstar formation rates (ssfr). compared with the larger sample, the lsn hostsoccupy low-density regions of a diagram plotting ssfr versus m_* in the areahaving higher ssfr and lower m_*. this preference for low m_*, high ssfr hostsimplies the lsne are produced by an effect having to do with their localenvironment. the correlation of mass with metallicity suggests that perhapswind-driven mass loss is the factor that prevents lsne from arising inhigher-mass, higher-metallicity hosts. the massive progenitors of the lsne(&gt;100 m_sun), by appearing in low-sfr hosts, are potential tests for theoriesof the initial mass function that limit the maximum mass of a star based on thesfr.

1012.0570	the old environment of the faint calcium-rich supernova sn 2005cz	the supernova sn 2005cz has recently attracted some attention, due to thefact that it was spectroscopically similar to type ib supernovae (sne), a classthat is presumed to result from core-collapse of massive stars, yet it occurredin an elliptical galaxy, where one expects very few massive stars to exist. twoexplanations for this remarkable event were put forward. perets et al. (2010)associate sn 2005cz with the class of ca-rich, faint sne ib, which likelyresult from old double-white-dwarf systems with a he-rich secondary. on theother hand, kawabata et al. (2010) suggest that sn 2005cz is indeed acore-collapse event (in a binary system), albeit of a star at the lower end ofthe mass range, 10-12 m_sun. the existence of this star in its elliptical hostis explained as resulting from low-level star formation (sf) activity in thatgalaxy. here we present extensive observations of the location of sn 2005cz,sensitive to a variety of sf tracers, including optical spectroscopy, h_alphaemission, uv emission and hst photometry. we show that ngc 4589, the hostgalaxy of sn 2005cz, does not show any signatures of a young stellar populationor recent sf activity either close to or far from the location of sn 2005cz.

0709.1472	constraints on circumstellar material around the type ia supernova  2007af	patat et al. recently inferred the existence of circumstellar material arounda normal type ia supernova (sn) for the first time, finding time-variable na id absorption lines in the spectrum of sn 2006x. we present high-resolutionspectroscopy of the bright sn ia 2007af at three epochs and search forvariability in any of the na d absorption components. over the time range from4 days before to 24 days after maximum light, we find that the host-galaxy na dlines appear to be of interstellar rather than circumstellar origin and do notvary down to the level of 18 ma (column density of 2 x 10^11 cm^-2). we limitany circumstellar absorption lines to be weaker than ~10 ma (6 x 10^10 cm^-2).for the case of material distributed in spherically symmetric shells of radius~10^16 cm surrounding the progenitor system, we place an upper limit on theshell mass of ~(3 x 10^-8)/x msun, where x is the na ionization fraction. wealso show that sn 2007af is a photometrically and spectroscopically normal snia. assuming that the variable na d lines in sn 2006x came from circumstellarmatter, we therefore conclude that either there is a preferred geometry for thedetection of variable absorption components in type ia supernovae, or sn 2007afand sn 2006x had different types of progenitor systems.

1103.0779	ptf10iya: a short-lived, luminous flare from the nuclear region of a  star-forming galaxy	we present the discovery and characterisation of ptf10iya, a short-lived (dt~ 10 d, with an optical decay rate of ~ 0.3 mag per d), luminous (m_g ~ -21mag) transient source found by the palomar transient factory. theultraviolet/optical spectral energy distribution is reasonably well fit by ablackbody with t ~ 1-2 x 10^4 k and peak bolometric luminosity l_bb ~ 1-5 x10^44 erg per s (depending on the details of the extinction correction). acomparable amount of energy is radiated in the x-ray band that appears toresult from a distinct physical process. the location of ptf10iya is consistentwith the nucleus of a star-forming galaxy (z = 0.22405 +/- 0.00006) to within350 mas (99.7 per cent confidence radius), or a projected distance of less than1.2 kpc. at first glance, these properties appear reminiscent of thecharacteristic "big blue bump" seen in the near-ultraviolet spectra of manyactive galactic nuclei (agns). however, emission-line diagnostics of the hostgalaxy, along with a historical light curve extending back to 2007, show noevidence for agn-like activity. we therefore consider whether the tidaldisruption of a star by an otherwise quiescent supermassive black hole mayaccount for our observations. though with limited temporal information,ptf10iya appears broadly consistent with the predictions for the early"super-eddington" phase of a solar-type star disrupted by a ~ 10^7 m_sun blackhole. regardless of the precise physical origin of the accreting material, thelarge luminosity and short duration suggest that otherwise quiescent galaxiescan transition extremely rapidly to radiate near the eddington limit; many suchoutbursts may have been missed by previous surveys lacking sufficient cadence.

1103.5165	supernova discoveries 2010-2011: statistics and trends	we have inspected all supernova discoveries reported during 2010 and 2011(538 and 926 events, respectively). we examine the statistics of all discoveredobjects, as well as those of the subset of spectroscopically-confirmed events.in these two years we see the rise of wide-field non-targeted supernova surveysto prominence, with the largest numbers of events reported by the crts and ptfsurveys (572 and 393 events in total respectively, contributing together 74% ofall reported discoveries in 2011), followed by the integrated contribution ofnumerous amateurs (184 events). among spectroscopically-confirmed events theptf (393 events) leads, followed by crts (170 events), and amateur discoveries(144 events). traditional galaxy-targeted surveys, such as loss and chase,maintain a strong contribution (86 and 61 events, respectively) with highspectroscopic completeness (~90% per cent). it is interesting to note that thecommunity managed to provide substantial spectroscopic follow-up for relativelybrighter amateur discoveries (&lt;m&gt;=16.5 mag), but significant less help forfainter (and much more numerous) events promptly released by the crts (&lt;m&gt;=18.6mag). inspecting discovery magnitude and redshift distributions we find thatps1 discoveries have similar properties (&lt;m&gt;=21.6 mag, &lt;z&gt;=0.23) to eventsfound in previous seasons by cosmology-oriented projects (e.g., sdss-ii), whileptf (&lt;m&gt;=19.2 mag, &lt;z&gt;=0.095) and crts (&lt;m&gt;=18.6 mag, &lt;z&gt;=0.049) populate therelatively unexplored phase space of faint sne (&gt;19 mag) in nearby galaxies(mainly ptf), and events at 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.2 (crts and ptf). examining the specificquestion of reporting channels over the previous dozen years, we find thattraditional reports via cbet telegrams now account only for a minority of sndiscoveries.

1106.2897	the progenitor of supernova 2011dh/ptf11eon in messier 51	we have identified a luminous star at the position of supernova (sn)2011dh/ptf11eon, in pre-sn archival, multi-band images of the nearby, nearlyface-on galaxy messier 51 (m51) obtained by the hubble space telescope with theadvanced camera for surveys. this identification has been confirmed, to thehighest available astrometric precision, using a keck-ii adaptive-optics image.the available early-time spectra and photometry indicate that the sn is astripped-envelope, core-collapse type iib, with a more compact progenitor(radius ~1e11 cm) than was the case for the well-studied sn iib 1993j. we inferthat the extinction to sn 2011dh and its progenitor arises from a low galacticforeground contribution, and that the sn environment is of roughly solarmetallicity. the detected object has absolute magnitude m_v^0 ~ -7.7 andeffective temperature ~6000 k. the star's radius, ~1e13 cm, is more extendedthan what has been inferred for the sn progenitor. we speculate that thedetected star is either an unrelated star very near the position of the actualprogenitor, or, more likely, the progenitor's companion in a mass-transferbinary system. the position of the detected star in a hertzsprung-russelldiagram is consistent with an initial mass of 17--19 msun. the light of thisstar could easily conceal, even in the ultraviolet, the presence of a stripped,compact, very hot (~1e5 k), nitrogen-rich wolf-rayet star progenitor.

1108.2868	sn2010jp (ptf10aaxi): a jet-driven type ii supernova	we present photometry and spectroscopy of the peculiar typeii supernova (sn)2010jp, also named ptf10aaxi. the light curve exhibits a linear decline with arelatively low peak absolute magnitude of only -15.9, and a low radioactivedecay luminosity at late times that suggests a nickel mass below 0.003$m_{\odot}$. spectra of sn2010jp display an unprecedented triple-peakedh$\alpha$ line profile, showing: (1) a narrow (800 km/s) central component thatsuggests shock interaction with dense csm; (2) high-velocity blue and redemission features centered at -12600 and +15400 km/s; and (3) broad wingsextending from -22000 to +25000 km/s. these features persist during 100 daysafter explosion. we propose that this line profile indicates a bipolarjet-driven explosion, with the central component produced by normal sn ejectaand csm interaction at mid latitudes, while the high-velocity bumps and broadline wings arise in a nonrelativistic bipolar jet. two variations of the jetinterpretation seem plausible: (1) a fast jet mixes 56ni to high velocities inpolar zones of the h-rich envelope, or (2) the reverse shock in the jetproduces blue and red bumps in balmer lines when a jet interacts with densecsm. jet-driven sneii are predicted for collapsars resulting from a wide rangeof initial masses above 25 $m_{\odot}$ at sub-solar metallicity. this seemsconsistent with the sn host environment, which is either an extremelylow-luminosity dwarf galaxy or very remote parts of an interacting pair ofstar-forming galaxies. it also seems consistent with the low 56ni mass that mayaccompany black hole formation. we speculate that the jet survives to produceobservable signatures because the star's h envelope was mostly stripped away byprevious eruptive mass loss.

1111.6109	calcium-rich gap transients in the remote outskirts of galaxies	from the first two seasons of the palomar transient factory, we identifythree peculiar transients (ptf09dav, ptf10iuv, ptf11bij) with fivedistinguishing characteristics: peak luminosity in the gap between novae andsupernovae (m_r = 15.5 to -16.5), rapid photometric evolution (rise-time~12--15 days), large photospheric velocities (~6000 to 11000 km/s), earlyspectroscopic evolution into nebular phase (~1 to 3 months) and peculiarnebular spectra dominated by calcium. we also culled the extensive decade-longlick observatory supernova search database and identified an additional memberof this group, sn 2007ke. our choice of photometric and spectroscopicproperties was motivated by sn 2005e (perets et al. 2010). to our surprise, asin the case of sn 2005e, all four members of this group are also clearly offsetfrom the bulk of their host galaxy. given the well-sampled early and late-timelight curves, we derive ejecta masses in the range of 0.4--0.7 msun.spectroscopically, we find that there may be a diversity in the photosphericphase, but the commonality is in the unusual nebular spectra. our extensivefollow-up observations rule out standard thermonuclear and standardcore-collapse explosions for this class of "calcium-rich gap" transients. ifthe progenitor is a white dwarf, we are likely seeing a detonation of the whitedwarf core and perhaps, even shockfront interaction with a previously ejectednova shell. in the less likely scenario of a massive star progenitor, a verynon-standard channel specific to a low-metallicity environment needs to beinvoked (e.g., ejecta fallback leading to black hole formation). detection (orlack thereof) of a faint underlying host (dwarf galaxy, cluster) will provide acrucial and decisive diagnostic to choose between these alternatives.

1203.2916	linking type ia supernova progenitors and their resulting explosions	comparing the ejecta velocities at maximum brightness and narrowcircumstellar/interstellar na d absorption line profiles of a sample of 23 typeia supernovae (sne ia), we determine that the properties of sn ia progenitorsystems and explosions are intimately connected. as demonstrated by sternberget al. (2011), half of all sne ia with detectable na d absorption at thehost-galaxy redshift in high-resolution spectroscopy have na d line profileswith significant blueshifted absorption relative to the strongest absorptioncomponent, which indicates that a large fraction of sn ia progenitor systemshave strong outflows. in this study, we find that sne ia with blueshiftedcircumstellar/interstellar absorption systematically have higher ejectavelocities and redder colors at maximum brightness relative to the rest of thesn ia population. this result is robust at a 98.9-99.8% confidence level,providing the first link between the progenitor systems and properties of theexplosion. this finding is further evidence that the outflow scenario is thecorrect interpretation of the blueshifted na d absorption, adding additionalconfirmation that some sne ia are produced from a single-degenerate progenitorchannel. an additional implication is that either sn ia progenitor systems havehighly asymmetric outflows that are also aligned with the sn explosion or sneia come from a variety of progenitor systems where sne ia from systems withstrong outflows tend to have more kinetic energy per unit mass than those fromsystems with weak or no outflows.

1210.7281	supernova 2003ie was likely a faint type iip event	we present new photometric observations of supernova (sn) 2003ie starting onemonth before discovery, obtained serendipitously while observing its hostgalaxy. with only a weak upper limit derived on the mass of its progenitor (&lt;25m_sun) from pre-explosion studies, this event could be a potential exception tothe "red supergiant (rsg) problem" (the lack of high mass rsgs exploding astype iip supernovae). however, this is true only if sn2003ie was a type ipevent, something which has never been determined. using recently derived corecollapse sn light curve templates, as well as by comparison to other known sne,we find that sn2003ie was indeed a likely type iip event. however, it is foundto be a member of the faint type iip class. previous members of this class havebeen shown to arise from relatively low mass progenitors (&lt;12 m_sun). ittherefore seems unlikely that this sn had a massive rsg progenitor. the use ofcore collapse sn light curve templates is shown to be helpful in classifyingsne with sparse coverage. these templates are likely to become more robust aslarge homogeneous samples of core collapse events are collected.

1303.3453	sn 2009ip \'a la pessto: no evidence for core-collapse yet	we present observations of the interacting transient sn 2009ip, from thestart of the outburst in october 2012 until the end of the 2012 observingseason. the transient reached a peak of $m_v$=-17.7 mag before fading rapidly,with a total integrated luminosity of 1.9$\times10^{49}$ erg over the period ofaugust-december 2012. the optical and near infrared spectra are dominated bynarrow emission lines, signaling a dense circumstellar environment, togetherwith multiple components of broad emission and absorption in h and he atvelocities between 0.5-1.2$\times10^4$ km s$^{-1}$\. we see no evidence fornucleosynthesized material in sn 2009ip, even in late-time pseudo-nebularspectra. we set a limit of $&lt;$0.02 m$_{\odot}$\ on the mass of any synthesized$^{56}$ni from the late time lightcurve. a simple model for the narrow balmerlines is presented, and used to derive number densities for the circumstellarmedium of between $\sim 10^{9}-10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. our near-infrared data doesnot show any excess at longer wavelengths. our last data, taken in december2012, shows that sn 2009ip has spectroscopically evolved to something quitesimilar to its appearance in late 2009, albeit with higher velocities. it ispossible that neither of the eruptive and high luminosity events of sn 2009ipwere induced by a core-collapse. we show that the peak and total integratedluminosity can be due to the efficient conversion of kinetic energy fromcolliding ejecta, and that around 0.05-0.1 m$_{\odot}$\ of material moving at0.5-1$\times10^4$ km s$^{-1}$\ could comfortably produce the observedluminosity. the ejection of multiple shells, lack of evidence fornucleosynthesied elements and broad nebular lines, are all consistent with thepulsational-pair instability scenario. in this case the progenitor star maystill exist, and will be observed after the current outburst fades.

1303.7234	late-time spectral observations of the strongly interacting type ia  supernova ptf11kx	ptf11kx was a type ia supernova (sn ia) that showed time-variable absorptionfeatures, including saturated ca ii h&amp;k lines that weakened and eventually wentinto emission. the strength of the emission component of h{\alpha} increased,implying that the sn was undergoing significant interaction with itscircumstellar medium (csm). these features were blueshifted slightly and showeda p-cygni profile, likely indicating that the csm was directly related to, andprobably previously ejected by, the progenitor system itself. these and otherobservations led dilday et al. (2012) to conclude that ptf11kx came from asymbiotic nova progenitor like rs oph. in this work we extend the spectralcoverage of ptf11kx to 124-680 rest-frame days past maximum brightness. thesespectra of ptf11kx are dominated by h{\alpha} emission (with widths of ~2000km/s), strong ca ii emission features (~10,000 km/s wide), and a blue"quasi-continuum" due to many overlapping narrow lines of fe ii. emission fromoxygen, he i, and balmer lines higher than h{\alpha} is weak or completelyabsent at all epochs, leading to large observed h{\alpha}/h{\beta} intensityratios. the broader (~2000 km/s) h{\alpha} emission appears to increase instrength with time for ~1 yr, but it subsequently decreases significantly alongwith the ca ii emission. our latest spectrum also indicates the possibility ofnewly formed dust in the system as evidenced by a slight decrease in the redwing of h{\alpha}. during the same epochs, multiple narrow emission featuresfrom the csm temporally vary in strength. the weakening of the h{\alpha} and caii emission at late times is possible evidence that the sn ejecta haveovertaken the majority of the csm and agrees with models of other stronglyinteracting sne ia. the varying narrow emission features, on the other hand,may indicate that the csm is clumpy or consists of multiple thin shells.

1304.4236	discovery of a cosmological, relativistic outburst via its rapidly  fading optical emission	we report the discovery by the palomar transient factory (ptf) of thetransient source ptf11agg, which is distinguished by three primarycharacteristics: (1) bright, rapidly fading optical transient emission; (2) afaint, blue quiescent optical counterpart; and (3) an associated year-long,scintillating radio transient. we argue that these observed properties areinconsistent with any known class of galactic transients, and instead suggest acosmological origin. the detection of incoherent radio emission at suchdistances implies a large emitting region, from which we infer the presence ofrelativistic ejecta. the observed properties are all consistent with thepopulation of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs), marking the first timesuch an outburst has been discovered in the distant universe independent of ahigh-energy trigger. we searched for possible high-energy counterparts toptf11agg, but found no evidence for associated prompt emission. we thereforeconsider three possible scenarios to account for a grb-like afterglow without ahigh-energy counterpart: an "untriggered" grb (lack of satellite coverage), an"orphan" afterglow (viewing-angle effects), and a "dirty fireball" (suppressedhigh-energy emission). the observed optical and radio light curves appearinconsistent with even the most basic predictions for off-axis afterglowmodels. the simplest explanation, then, is that ptf11agg is a normal, on-axislong-duration grb for which the associated high-energy emission was simplymissed. however, we have calculated the likelihood of such a serendipitousdiscovery by ptf and find that it is quite small (~ 2.6%). while notdefinitive, we nonetheless speculate that ptf11agg may represent a new, morecommon (&gt; 4 times the on-axis grb rate at 90% confidence) class of relativisticoutbursts lacking associated high-energy emission.

1305.6997	spectroscopy of type ia supernovae by the carnegie supernova project	this is the first release of optical spectroscopic data of low-redshift typeia supernovae (sne ia) by the carnegie supernova project including 604previously unpublished spectra of 93 sne ia. the observations cover a range ofphases from 12 days before to over 150 days after the time of b-band maximumlight. with the addition of 228 near-maximum spectra from the literature westudy the diversity among sne ia in a quantitative manner. for that purpose,spectroscopic parameters are employed such as expansion velocities fromspectral line blueshifts, and pseudo-equivalent widths (pw). the values ofthose parameters at maximum light are obtained for 78 objects, thus providing acharacterization of sne ia that may help to improve our understanding of theproperties of the exploding systems and the thermonuclear flame propagation.two objects, namely sne 2005m and 2006is, stand out from the sample by showingpeculiar si ii and s ii velocities but otherwise standard velocities for therest of the ions. we further study the correlations between spectroscopic andphotometric parameters such as light-curve decline rate and color. in agreementwith previous studies, we find that the pw of si ii absorption features arevery good indicators of light-curve decline rate. furthermore, we demonstratethat parameters such as pw2(siii4130) and pw6(siii5972) provide precisecalibrations of the peak b-band luminosity with dispersions of ~0.15 mag. inthe search for a secondary parameter in the calibration of peak luminosity forsne ia, we find a ~2--3-sigma correlation between b-band hubble residuals andthe velocity at maximum light of s ii and si ii lines.

1306.2474	environment-derived constraints on the progenitors of low-luminosity  type i supernovae	we present a study of the properties of the host galaxies of unusualtransient objects of two types, both being sub-luminous compared with the majorclasses of supernovae. those of one type exhibit unusually strong calciumfeatures, and have been termed 'ca-rich'. those of the second type, withsn2002cx as the prototype and sn2008ha as the most extreme example to date,have some properties in common with the first, but show typically lower ejectavelocities, and different early spectra. we confirm important differences inthe environments of the two types, with the ca-rich transients preferentiallyoccurring in galaxies dominated by old stellar populations. quantitatively, theassociation of the the ca-rich transients with regions of ongoing starformation is well matched to that of type ia supernovae. the sn2002cx-liketransients are very different, with none of the present sample occurring in anearly-type host, and a statistical association with star-formation regionssimilar to that of type ii-p supernovae, and therefore a delay time of 30-50myrs.

1306.5755	ptf12gzk - a rapidly declining, high-velocity type ic radio supernova	only a few cases of type ic supernovae (sne) with high-velocity ejecta havebeen discovered and studied. here we present our analysis of radio and x-rayobservations of a type ic sn, ptf12gzk. the radio emission rapidly declinedless than 10 days after explosion, suggesting sn ejecta expanding at highvelocity (~0.3c). the radio data also indicate that the density of thecircumstellar material (csm) around the supernova is lower by a factor of ~10than the csm around normal type ic sne. our observations of this rapidlydeclining radio sn at a distance of 58 mpc demonstrates the potential to detectmany additional radio sne, given the new capabilities of the vla (improvedsensitivity and dynamic scheduling), that are currently missed, leading to abiased view of radio sne ic. early optical discovery followed by rapid radioobservations would provide a full description of the ejecta velocitydistribution and csm densities around stripped massive star explosions, as wellas strong clues about the nature of their progenitor stars.

1307.3555	sn 2000cx and sn 2013bh: extremely rare, nearly twin type ia supernovae	the type ia supernova (sn ia) sn 2000cx was one of the most peculiartransients ever discovered, with a rise to maximum brightness typical of a snia, but a slower decline and a higher photospheric temperature. thirteen yearslater sn 2013bh (aka iptf13abc), a near identical twin, was discovered and weobtained optical and near-ir photometry and low-resolution optical spectroscopyfrom discovery until about 1 month past r-band maximum brightness. the spectraof both objects show iron-group elements (co ii, ni ii, fe ii, fe iii, andhigh-velocity features [hvfs] of ti ii), intermediate-mass elements (si ii, siiii, and s ii), and separate normal velocity features (~12000 km/s) and hvfs(~24000 km/s) of ca ii. persistent absorption from fe iii and si iii, alongwith the colour evolution, imply high blackbody temperatures for sne 2013bh and2000cx (~12000 k). both objects lack narrow na i d absorption and exploded inthe outskirts of their hosts, indicating that the sn environments wererelatively free of interstellar or circumstellar material and may imply thatthe progenitors came from a relatively old and low-metallicity stellarpopulation. models of sn 2000cx, seemingly applicable to sn 2013bh, imply theproduction of up to ~1 m_sun of ni-56 and (4.3-5.5)e-3 m_sun of fast-moving caejecta.

1308.3899	a statistical analysis of circumstellar material in type ia supernovae	a key tracer of the elusive progenitor systems of type ia supernovae (sne ia)is the detection of narrow blueshifted time-varying na i d absorption lines,interpreted as evidence of circumstellar material (csm) surrounding theprogenitor system. the origin of this material is controversial, but thesimplest explanation is that it results from previous mass loss in a systemcontaining a white dwarf and a non-degenerate companion star. we present newsingle-epoch intermediate-resolution spectra of 17 low-redshift sne ia takenwith xshooter on the eso very large telescope. combining this sample withevents from the literature, we confirm an excess (~20 per cent) of sne iadisplaying blueshifted narrow na i d absorption features compared tonon-blueshifted na i d features. the host galaxies of sne ia displayingblueshifted absorption profiles are skewed towards later-type galaxies,compared to sne ia that show no na i d absorption, and sne ia displayingblueshifted narrow na i d absorption features have broader light curves. thestrength of the na i d absorption is stronger in sne ia displaying blueshiftedna i d absorption features than those without blueshifted features, and thestrength of the blueshifted na i d is correlated with the b-v colour of the snat maximum light. this strongly suggests the absorbing material is local to thesn. in the context of the progenitor systems of sne ia, we discuss thesignificance of these findings and other recent observational evidence on thenature of sn ia progenitors. we present a summary that suggests there are atleast two distinct populations of normal, cosmologically useful sne ia.

1309.4268	on the progenitor of the type iip sn 2013ej in m74	we use natural seeing imaging of sn 2013ej in m74 to identify a progenitorcandidate in archival {\it hubble space telescope} + acs images. we find asource coincident with the sn in the {\it f814w}-filter, however the positionof the progenitor candidate in contemporaneous {\it f435w} and {\itf555w}-filters is significantly offset. we conclude that the "progenitorcandidate" is in fact two physically unrelated sources; a blue source which islikely unrelated to the sn, and a red source which we suggest exploded as sn2013ej. deep images with the same instrument onboard {\it hst} taken when thesupernova has faded (in approximately two years time) will allow us toaccurately characterise the unrelated neighbouring source and hence determinethe intrinsic flux of the progenitor in three filters. we suggest that the {\itf814w} flux is dominated by the progenitor of sn 2013ej, and assuming abolometric correction appropriate to an m-type supergiant, we estimate that themass of the progenitor of sn 2013ej was between 8 -- 15.5 m$_{\odot}$.

1312.0012	iptf13beo: the double-peaked light curve of a type ibn supernova  discovered shortly after explosion	we present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the type ibn(sn 2006jc-like) supernova iptf13beo. detected by the intermediate palomartransient factory ~3 hours after the estimated first light, iptf13beo is theyoungest and the most distant (~430 mpc) type ibn event ever observed. theiptf13beo light curve is consistent with light curves of other type ibn sne andwith light curves of fast type ic events, but with a slightly faster rise-timeof two days. in addition, the iptf13beo r-band light curve exhibits adouble-peak structure separated by ~9 days, not observed before in any type ibnsn. a low-resolution spectrum taken during the iptf13beo rising stage isfeatureless, while a late-time spectrum obtained during the declining stageexhibits narrow and intermediate-width he i and si ii features with fwhm ~2000-5000 km/s and is remarkably similar to the prototypical sn ibn 2006jcspectrum. we suggest that our observations support a model of a massive starexploding in a dense he-rich circumstellar medium (csm). a shock breakout in acsm model requires an eruption releasing a total mass of ~0.1 msun over a timescale of couple of weeks prior to the sn explosion.

1312.3984	the type iib supernova 2013df and its cool supergiant progenitor	we have obtained early-time photometry and spectroscopy of supernova (sn)2013df in ngc 4414. the sn is clearly of type iib, with notable similarities tosn 1993j. from its luminosity at secondary maximum light, it appears that less$^{56}$ni ($\lesssim 0.06\ m_{\odot}$) was synthesized in the sn 2013dfexplosion than was the case for the sne iib 1993j, 2008ax, and 2011dh. based ona comparison of the light curves, the sn 2013df progenitor must have been moreextended in radius prior to explosion than the progenitor of sn 1993j. thetotal extinction for sn 2013df is estimated to be $a_v=0.30$ mag. themetallicity at the sn location is likely to be solar. we have conducted hubblespace telescope (hst) target of opportunity observations of the sn with thewide field camera 3, and from a precise comparison of these new observations toarchival hst observations of the host galaxy obtained 14 years prior toexplosion, we have identified the progenitor of sn 2013df to be a yellowsupergiant, somewhat hotter than a red supergiant progenitor for a normal typeii-plateau sn. from its observed spectral energy distribution, assuming thatthe light is dominated by one star, the progenitor had effective temperature$t_{\rm eff} = 4250 \pm 100$ k and a bolometric luminosity $l_{\rmbol}=10^{4.94 \pm 0.06}\ l_{\odot}$. this leads to an effective radius $r_{\rmeff} = 545 \pm 65\ r_{\odot}$. the star likely had an initial mass in the rangeof 13 to 17 $m_{\odot}$; however, if it was a member of an interacting binarysystem, detailed modeling of the system is required to estimate this mass moreaccurately. the progenitor star of sn 2013df appears to have been relativelysimilar to the progenitor of sn 1993j.

0802.2748	a comprehensive study of grb 070125, a most energetic gamma ray burst	we present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of the bright, longduration gamma-ray burst grb 070125, comprised of observations in $\gamma$-ray,x-ray, optical, millimeter and centimeter wavebands. simultaneous fits to theoptical and x-ray light curves favor a break on day 3.78, which we interpret asthe jet break from a collimated outflow. independent fits to optical and x-raybands give similar results in the optical bands but shift the jet break toaround day 10 in the x-ray light curve. we show that for the physicalparameters derived for grb 070125, inverse compton scattering effects areimportant throughout the afterglow evolution. while inverse compton scatteringdoes not affect radio and optical bands, it may be a promising candidate todelay the jet break in the x-ray band. radio light curves show rapid fluxvariations, which are interpreted as due to interstellar scintillation, and areused to derive an upper limit of $2.4 \times 10^{17}$ cm on the radius of thefireball in the lateral expansion phase of the jet. radio light curves andspectra suggest a high synchrotron self absorption frequency indicative of theafterglow shock wave moving in a dense medium. our broadband modeling favors aconstant density profile for the circumburst medium over a wind-like profile($r^{-2}$). however, keeping in mind the uncertainty of the parameters, it isdifficult to unambiguously distinguish between the two density profiles. ourbroadband fits suggest that \event is a burst with high radiative efficiency($&gt; 60 %$).

1405.1415	a continuum of h- to he-rich tidal disruption candidates with a  preference for e+a galaxies	we present the results of a palomar transient factory (ptf) archival searchfor blue transients which lie in the magnitude range between "normal"core-collapse and superluminous supernovae (i.e. with$-21\,{\leq}m_{r\,(peak)}\,{\leq}-19$). of the six events found after excludingall interacting type~iin and ia-csm supernovae, three (ptf09ge, 09axc and09djl) are coincident with the centers of their hosts, one (10iam) is offsetfrom the center, and for two (10nuj and 11glr) a precise offset can not bedetermined. all the central events have similar rise times to the he-rich tidaldisruption candidate ps1-10jh, and the event with the best-sampled light curvealso has similar colors and power-law decay. spectroscopically, ptf09ge ishe-rich, while ptf09axc and 09djl display broad hydrogen features around peakmagnitude. all three central events are in low star-formation hosts, two ofwhich are e+a galaxies. our spectrum of the host of ps1-10jh displays similarproperties. ptf10iam, the one offset event, is different photometrically andspectroscopically from the central events and its host displays a higher starformation rate. finding no obvious evidence for ongoing galactic nucleiactivity or recent star formation, we conclude that the three centraltransients likely arise from the tidal disruption of a star by a super-massiveblack hole. we compare the spectra of these events to tidal disruptioncandidates from the literature and find that all of these objects can beunified on a continuous scale of spectral properties. the accumulated evidenceof this expanded sample strongly supports a tidal disruption origin for thisclass of nuclear transients.

1405.7409	slow-speed supernovae from the palomar transient factory: two channels	since the discovery of the unusual prototype sn 2002cx, the eponymous classof low-velocity, hydrogen-poor supernovae has grown to include at most anothertwo dozen members identified from several heterogeneous surveys, in some casesambiguously. here we present the results of a systematic study of 1077hydrogen-poor supernovae discovered by the palomar transient factory, leadingto nine new members of this peculiar class. moreover we find there are twodistinct subclasses based on their spectroscopic, photometric, and host galaxyproperties: the "sn 2002cx-like" supernovae tend to be in later-type or moreirregular hosts, have more varied and generally dimmer luminosities, havelonger rise times, and lack a ti ii trough when compared to the "sn2002es-like" supernovae. none of our objects show helium, and we counter aprevious claim of two such events. we also find that these transients comprise5.6+17-3.7% (90% confidence) of all sne ia, lower compared to earlierestimates. combining our objects with the literature sample, we propose thatthese subclasses have two distinct physical origins.

1406.7640	a wolf-rayet-like progenitor of supernova sn 2013cu from spectral  observations of a wind	the explosive fate of massive stripped wolf-rayet (w-r) stars is a key openquestion in stellar physics. an appealing option is that hydrogen-deficient w-rstars are the progenitors of some h-poor supernova (sn) explosions of typesiib, ib, and ic. a blue object, having luminosity and colors consistent withthose of some w-r stars, has been recently identified at the location of asn~ib in pre-explosion images but has not yet been conclusively determined tohave been the progenitor. similar previous works have so far only resulted innondetections. comparison of early photometric observations of type icsupernovae with theoretical models suggests that the progenitor stars had radii&lt;10^12 cm, as expected for some w-r stars. however, the hallmark signature ofw-r stars, their emission-line spectra, cannot be probed by such studies. here,we report the detection of strong emission lines in an early-time spectrum ofsn 2013cu (iptf13ast; type iib) obtained ~15.5 hr after explosion ("flashspectroscopy"). we identify w-r-like wind signatures suggesting a progenitor ofthe wn(h) subclass. the extent of this dense wind may indicate increased massloss from the progenitor shortly prior to its explosion, consistent with recenttheoretical predictions.

1412.4767	ultraviolet spectroscopy of type iib supernovae: diversity and the  impact of circumstellar material	we present new hubble space telescope (hst) multi-epoch ultraviolet (uv)spectra of the bright type iib sn 2013df, and undertake a comprehensive anal-ysis of the set of four type iib supernovae for which hst uv spectra areavailable (sn 1993j, sn 2001ig, sn 2011dh, and sn 2013df). we find strongdiversity in both continuum levels and line features among these objects. weuse radiative-transfer models that fit the optical part of the spectrum well,and find that in three of these four events we see a uv continuum flux excess,apparently unaffected by line absorption. we hypothesize that this emissionoriginates above the photosphere, and is related to interaction withcircumstel- lar material (csm) located in close proximity to the sn progenitor.in contrast, the spectra of sn 2001ig are well fit by single-temperaturemodels, display weak continuum and strong reverse-fluorescence features, andare similar to spectra of radioactive 56ni-dominated type ia supernovae. acomparison of the early shock-cooling components in the observed light curveswith the uv continuum levels which we assume trace the strength of csminteraction suggests that events with slower cooling have stronger csmemission. the radio emission from events having a prominent uv excess isperhaps consistent with slower blast-wave velocities, as expected if theexplosion shock was slowed down by the csm that is also responsible for thestrong uv, but this connection is currently speculative as it is based on onlya few events.

1501.02820	ptf11iqb: cool supergiant mass loss that bridges the gap between type  iin and normal supernovae	ptf11iqb was initially classified as a typeiin event caught very early afterexplosion. it showed narrow wolf-rayet (wr) spectral features on day 2, but thenarrow emission weakened quickly and the spectrum morphed to resemble those oftypes ii-l and ii-p. at late times, halpha emission exhibited a complex,multipeaked profile reminiscent of sn1998s. in terms of spectroscopicevolution, we find that ptf11iqb was a near twin of sn~1998s, although withweaker interaction with circumstellar material (csm) at early times, andstronger csm interaction at late times. we interpret the spectral changes ascaused by early interaction with asymmetric csm that is quickly (by day 20)enveloped by the expanding sn ejecta photosphere, but then revealed again afterthe end of the plateau when the photosphere recedes. the light curve can bematched with a simple model for weak csm interaction added to the light curveof a normal sn~ii-p. this plateau requires that the progenitor had an extendedh envelope like a red supergiant, consistent with the slow progenitor windspeed indicated by narrow emission. the cool supergiant progenitor issignificant because ptf11iqb showed wr features in its early spectrum ---meaning that the presence of such wr features in an early sn spectrum does notnecessarily indicate a wr-like progenitor. [abridged] overall, ptf11iqb bridgessne~iin with weaker pre-sn mass loss seen in sne ii-l and ii-p, implying acontinuum between these types.

1506.03115	detection of a type iin supernova in optical follow-up observations of  icecube neutrino events	the icecube neutrino observatory pursues a follow-up program selectinginteresting neutrino events in real-time and issuing alerts for electromagneticfollow-up observations. in march 2012, the most significant neutrino alertduring the first three years of operation was issued by icecube. in thefollow-up observations performed by the palomar transient factory (ptf), a typeiin supernova (sn) ptf12csy was found $0.2^\circ$ away from the neutrino alertdirection, with an error radius of $0.54^\circ$. it has a redshift of$z=0.0684$, corresponding to a luminosity distance of about $300 \,\mathrm{mpc}$ and the pan-starrs1 survey shows that its explosion time was atleast 158 days (in host galaxy rest frame) before the neutrino alert, so that acausal connection is unlikely. the a posteriori significance of the chancedetection of both the neutrinos and the sn at any epoch is $2.2 \, \sigma$within icecube's 2011/12 data acquisition season. also, a complementaryneutrino analysis reveals no long-term signal over the course of one year.therefore, we consider the sn detection coincidental and the neutrinosuncorrelated to the sn. however, the sn is unusual and interesting by itself:it is luminous and energetic, bearing strong resemblance to the sn iin 2010jl,and shows signs of interaction of the sn ejecta with a dense circumstellarmedium. high-energy neutrino emission is expected in models of diffusive shockacceleration, but at a low, non-detectable level for this specific sn. in thispaper, we describe the sn ptf12csy and present both the neutrino andelectromagnetic data, as well as their analysis.

1507.02501	measuring nickel masses in type ia supernovae using cobalt emission in  nebular phase spectra	the light curves of type ia supernovae (sne ia) are powered by theradioactive decay of $^{56}$ni to $^{56}$co at early times, and the decay of$^{56}$co to $^{56}$fe from ~60 days after explosion. we examine the evolutionof the [co iii] 5892 a emission complex during the nebular phase for sne iawith multiple nebular spectra and show that the line flux follows the square ofthe mass of $^{56}$co as a function of time. this result indicates bothefficient local energy deposition from positrons produced in $^{56}$co decay,and long-term stability of the ionization state of the nebula. we compile 77nebular spectra of 25 sn ia from the literature and present 17 new nebularspectra of 7 sne ia, including sn2014j. from these we measure the flux in the[co iii] 5892 a line and remove its well-behaved time dependence to infer theinitial mass of $^{56}$ni ($m_{ni}$) produced in the explosion. we then examine$^{56}$ni yields for different sn ia ejected masses ($m_{ej}$ - calculatedusing the relation between light curve width and ejected mass) and find the$^{56}$ni masses of sne ia fall into two regimes: for narrow light curves (lowstretch s~0.7-0.9), $m_{ni}$ is clustered near $m_{ni}$ ~ 0.4$m_\odot$ andshows a shallow increase as $m_{ej}$ increases from ~1-1.4$m_\odot$; at highstretch, $m_{ej}$ clusters at the chandrasekhar mass (1.4$m_\odot$) while$m_{ni}$ spans a broad range from 0.6-1.2$m_\odot$. this could constituteevidence for two distinct sn ia explosion mechanisms.

1508.04775	search for precursor eruptions among type iib supernovae	the progenitor stars of several type iib supernovae (sne) show indicationsfor extended hydrogen envelopes. these envelopes might be the outcome ofluminous energetic pre-explosion events, so-called precursor eruptions. we usethe palomar transient factory (ptf) pre-explosion observations of a sample of27 nearby type iib sne to look for such precursors during the final years priorto the sn explosion. no precursors are found when combining the observations in15-day bins, and we calculate the absolute-magnitude-dependent upper limit onthe precursor rate. at the 90% confidence level, type iib sne have on average$&lt;0.86$ precursors as bright as absolute $r$-band magnitude $-14$ in the final3.5 years before the explosion and $&lt;0.56$ events over the final year. incontrast, precursors among sne iin have a $\gtrsim 5$ times higher rate. thekinetic energy required to unbind a low-mass stellar envelope is comparable tothe radiated energy of a few-weeks-long precursor which would be detectable forthe closest sne in our sample. therefore, mass ejections, if they are common insuch sne, are radiatively inefficient or have durations longer than months.indeed, when using 60-day bins a faint precursor candidate is detected prior tosn 2012cs ($\sim2$% false-alarm probability). we also report the detection ofthe progenitor of sn 2011dh which does not show detectable variability over thefinal two years before the explosion. the suggested progenitor of sn 2012p isstill present, and hence is likely a compact star cluster, or an unrelatedobject.

1512.00733	type ii supernova energetics and comparison of light curves to  shock-cooling models	during the first few days after explosion, type ii supernovae (sne) aredominated by relatively simple physics. theoretical predictions regardingearly-time sn light curves in the ultraviolet (uv) and optical bands are thusquite robust. we present, for the first time, a sample of $57$ $r$-band type iisn light curves that are well monitored during their rise, having $&gt;5$detections during the first 10 days after discovery, and a well-constrainedtime of explosion to within $1-3$ days. we show that the energy per unit mass($e/m$) can be deduced to roughly a factor of five by comparing early-timeoptical data to the model of rabinak &amp; waxman (2011), while the progenitorradius cannot be determined based on $r$-band data alone. we find that type iisn explosion energies span a range of $e/m=(0.2-20)\times 10^{51} \;\rm{erg/(10 m}_\odot$), and have a mean energy per unit mass of $\left\langlee/m \right\rangle = 0.85\times 10^{51} \; \rm{erg/(10 m}_\odot$), corrected formalmquist bias. assuming a small spread in progenitor masses, this indicates alarge intrinsic diversity in explosion energy. moreover, $e/m$ is positivelycorrelated with the amount of $^{56}\rm{ni}$ produced in the explosion, aspredicted by some recent models of core-collapse sne. we further presentseveral empirical correlations. the peak magnitude is correlated with thedecline rate ($\delta m_{15}$), the decline rate is weakly correlated with therise time, and the rise time is not significantly correlated with the peakmagnitude. faster declining sne are more luminous and have longer rise times.this limits the possible power sources for such events.

astro-ph;0109089	supernovae in deep hubble space telescope galaxy cluster fields: cluster  rates and field counts	we have searched for high-redshift supernova (sn) candidates in multiple deephubble space telescope (hst) archival images of nine galaxy-cluster fields. wedetect six apparent sne, with i814 between 21.6 and 28.4 mag. there is roughly1 sn per deep (flux limit i814 &gt; 26 mag), doubly-imaged, wfpc2 cluster field.two sne are associated with cluster galaxies (at redshifts z=0.18 and z=0.83),three are probably in galaxies not in the clusters (at z=0.49, z=0.60, andz=0.98), and one is at unknown z. after accounting for observationalefficiencies and uncertainties (statistical and systematic) we derive the rateof type-ia sne within the projected central 500 kpc of rich clusters:r=0.20(+0.84)(-0.19) snu in clusters at z=0.18 to 0.37, andr=0.41(+1.23)(-0.39) snu in clusters at z=0.83 to 1.27 (95 per cent confidenceinterval; h_0=50; 1 snu = 1 sn per century per 10^10 l_b_sun). combining thetwo redshift bins, the sn rate at a mean redshift of z=0.41 is r(z=0.41) =0.30(+0.58)(-0.28) snu. the upper bounds argue against sne-ia being thedominant source of the large iron mass observed in the intra-cluster medium. wealso compare our observed counts of field sne (i.e., non-cluster sne of alltypes) to recent model predictions. the observed field count is zero or one snwith i814 &lt; 26 mag, and 1 to 3 sne with i814 &lt; 27 mag. these counts are abouttwo times lower than some of the predictions. since the counts at thesemagnitudes are likely dominated by type-ii sne, our observations may suggestobscuration of distant sne-ii, or a sn-ii luminosity distribution devoid of alarge high-luminosity tail.

astro-ph;0202198	not color blind: using multiband photometry to classify supernovae	large numbers of supernovae (sne) have been discovered in recent years, andmany more will be found in the near future. once discovered, further study of asn and its possible use as an astronomical tool (e.g., as a distance estimator)require knowledge of the sn type. current classification methods rely almostsolely on the analysis of sn spectra to determine their type. however,spectroscopy may not be possible or practical when sne are faint, numerous, ordiscovered in archival studies. we present a classification method for snebased on the comparison of their observed colors with synthetic ones,calculated from a large database of multi-epoch optical spectra of nearbyevents. we discuss the capabilities and limitations of this method. forexample, type ia sne at redshifts z &lt; 0.1 can be distinguished from most othersn types during the first few weeks of their evolution, based on v-r vs. r-icolors. type ii-p sne have distinct (very red) colors at late (t &gt; 100 days)stages. broadband photometry through standard johnson-cousins $ubvri$ filterscan be useful to classify sne out to z ~ 0.6. the use of sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) ugriz filters allows the extension of our classification methodto even higher redshifts (z = 0.75), and the use of infrared bands, to z = 2.5.we demonstrate the application of this method to a recently discovered sn fromthe sdss. finally, we outline the observational data required to furtherimprove the sensitivity of the method, and discuss prospects for its use onfuture sn samples. community access to the tools developed is provided by adedicated website (http://wise-obs.tau.ac.il/~dovip/typing) .

astro-ph;0211334	a population of intergalactic supernovae in galaxy clusters	we have discovered seven type ia cluster supernovae (sne) in the course ofthe wise observatory optical transients search in the fields of galaxy clusterswith redshifts between z=0.06 and z=0.2. two of these events, sn 1998fc inabell 403 (z=0.10) and sn 2001al in abell 2122/4 (z = 0.066), have no obvioushosts. both events appear projected on the halos of the central cd galaxies,but have velocity offsets of 750-2000 km/s relative to those galaxies,suggesting they are not bound to them. we use deep keck imaging of thelocations of the two sne to put upper limits on the luminosities of possibledwarf hosts, m_r &gt; -14 mag for sn 1998fc and m_r &gt; -11.8 mag for sn 2001al. thefractions of the cluster luminosities in dwarf galaxies fainter than our limitsare less than 3 x 10^-3 and 3 x 10^-4, respectively. thus, 2/7 of the sne wouldbe associated with less than 3 x 10^-3 of the luminosity attributed togalaxies. we argue, instead, that the progenitors of both events were probablymembers of a diffuse population of intergalactic stars, recently detected inlocal clusters via planetary nebulae and red giants. considering the higherdetectability of hostless sne compared to normal sne, we estimate that20^{+12}_{-15} percent of the sn ia parent stellar population in clusters isintergalactic. this fraction is consistent with other measurements of theintergalactic stellar population, and implies that the process that producesintergalactic stars (e.g., tidal disruption of cluster dwarfs) does not disruptor enhance significantly the sn ia formation mechanism. hostless sne arepotentially powerful tracers of the formation of the intergalactic stellarpopulation out to high redshift.

astro-ph;0309796	the redshift distribution of type-ia supernovae: constraints on  progenitors and cosmic star formation history	we use the redshift distribution of type-ia supernovae (sne) discovered bythe supernova cosmology project to constrain the star formation history (sfh)of the universe and sn ia progenitor models. given some of the recentdeterminations of the sfh, the observed sn ia redshift distribution indicates along (&gt;~1 h^-1 gyr) mean delay time between the formation of a stellarpopulation and the explosion of some of its members as sne ia. for example, ifthe madau et al. (1998) sfh is assumed, the delay time tau is constrained to betau &gt; 1.7 (tau &gt; 0.7) h^-1 gyr at the 95%(99%) confidence level (cl). sfhs thatrise at high redshift, similar to those advocated by lanzetta et al. (2002),are inconsistent with the data at the 95% cl unless tau &gt; 2.5 h^-1 gyr. longtime delays disfavor progenitor models such as edge-lit detonation of a whitedwarf accreting from a giant donor, and the carbon core ignition of a whitedwarf passing the chandrasekhar mass due to accretion from a subgiant. the snia delay may be shorter, thereby relaxing some of these constraints, if thefield star formation rate falls, between z=1 and the present, less sharply thanimplied, e.g., by the original madau plot. we show that the discovery of largersamples of high-z sne ia by forthcoming observational projects should yieldstrong constraints on the progenitor models and the sfh. in a companion paper(astro-ph/0309797), we demonstrate that if sne ia produce most of the iron ingalaxy clusters, and the stars in clusters formed at z~2, the sn ia delay timemust be lower than 2 gyr. if so, then the lanzetta et al.

astro-ph;0509891	the progenitors of short-hard gamma-ray bursts from an extended sample  of events	the detection of the afterglow emission and host galaxies of short-hardgamma-ray bursts (shbs) is one of the most exciting recent astronomicaldiscoveries. indications that shb progenitors belong to old stellarpopulations, in contrast to those of the long-soft grbs, provide a strong clueabout their physical nature. definitive conclusions however are limited by thesmall number of shbs with known hosts. here, we present our investigation ofshbs previously localized by the interplanetary network (ipn) using new andarchival optical and x-ray observations. we show that we can likely identifythe host galaxies/clusters for additional two bursts, significantly increasingthe sample of shbs with known hosts and/or distances. in particular, wedetermine that the bright shb 790613 occurred within the rich galaxy clusterabell 1892, making it probably the nearest shb currently known. we show thatthe brightest galaxy within the error box of shb 000607, at z=0.14, is mostlikely the host galaxy of this event. additionally, we rule out the existenceof galaxy overdensities (down to ~21mag) near the locations of two other shbs,and set a lower limit on their probable redshift. we combine our shb samplewith events discovered recently by the swift and hete-2 missions, andinvestigate the properties of the extended sample. comparison to sne ia showsthat the progenitors of shbs are typically older, implying a typical life timeof several gy. we also show that it is unlikely that there is a significantpopulation of progenitors with life time shorter than 1gy. this resultdisfavors the popular model of ns-ns mergers as the progenitors of shbs.

astro-ph;0511254	the local rate and the progenitor lifetimes of short-hard gamma-ray  bursts: synthesis and predictions for ligo	the recent discovery of the first four afterglows of short-hard gamma-raybursts (shbs), suggests that they typically result from long-lived progenitorsystems. the most popular progenitor model invokes the merger of either doubleneutron star (dns) binaries or neutron star-black hole (ns-bh) systems. suchevents are strong sources of gravitational-waves (gws) and might be detected byground-based gw observatories. in this work we combine the census of shbobservations with refined theoretical analysis to perform a critical evaluationof the compact binary model. we then explore the implications for gw detectionof these events. beginning from the measured star-formation rate through cosmictime, we consider what intrinsic luminosity and lifetime distributions canreproduce the known shb redshifts and luminosities as well as the peak fluxdistribution of the large batse shb sample. we find that: (1) the typicalprogenitor lifetime is long. assuming lognormal lifetime distribution thetypical lifetime is &gt;4[1] gyr (2[3]\sigma c.l.). if the lifetime distributionis a power-law with index \eta then \eta&gt;-0.5 [-1] (2[3] \sigma c.l.). thisresult is difficult to reconcile with the properties of the observed galacticdns population, suggesting that if shbs do result from dns mergers then theobserved galactic binaries do not represent the cosmic one. (2) we find thatthe local rate of shbs is larger than 10gpc^-3/yr and may be higher by severalorders of magnitude, significantly above previous estimates. (3) assuming thatshbs do result from compact binaries, our predictions for the ligo and virgoevent rates are encouraging: the chance for detection by current facilities isnot negligible, while a coincident detection of gw and electromagneticradiation from an shb is guaranteed for next-generation observatories.

astro-ph;0603297	a non-spherical core in the explosion of supernova sn 2004dj	an important and perhaps critical clue to the mechanism driving the explosionof massive stars as supernovae is provided by the accumulating evidence forasymmetry in the explosion. indirect evidence comes from high pulsarvelocities, associations of supernovae with long-soft gamma-ray bursts, andasymmetries in late-time emission-line profiles. spectropolarimetry provides adirect probe of young supernova geometry, with higher polarization generallyindicating a greater departure from spherical symmetry. large polarizationshave been measured for 'stripped-envelope' (that is, type ic) supernovae, whichconfirms their non-spherical morphology; but the explosions of massive starswith intact hydrogen envelopes (type ii-p supernovae) have shown only weakpolarizations at the early times observed. here we report multi-epochspectropolarimetry of a classic type ii-p supernova that reveals the abruptappearance of significant polarization when the inner core is first exposed inthe thinning ejecta (~90 days after explosion). we infer a departure fromspherical symmetry of at least 30 per cent for the inner ejecta. combined withearlier results, this suggests that a strongly non-spherical explosion may be ageneric feature of core-collapse supernovae of all types, where the asphericityin type ii-p supernovae is cloaked at early times by the massive, opaque,hydrogen envelope.

astro-ph;0603516	models for the type ic hypernova sn 2003lw associated with grb 031203	the gamma-ray burst 031203 at a redshift z=0.1055 revealed a highly reddenedtype ic supernova, sn 2003lw, in its afterglow light. this is the third wellestablished case of a link between a long-duration grb and a type ic sn. the snlight curve is obtained subtracting the galaxy contribution and is modelledtogether with two spectra at near-maximum epochs. a red vlt grism 150i spectrumof the sn near peak is used to extend the spectral coverage, and in particularto constrain the uncertain reddening, the most likely value for which ise_{g+h}(b-v) about 1.07 +/- 0.05. accounting for reddening, sn 2003lw is about0.3 mag brighter than the prototypical grb-sn 1998bw. light curve models yielda 56ni mass of about 0.55 solar mass. the optimal explosion model is somewhatmore massive (ejecta mass about 13 solar mass) and energetic (kinetic energyabout 6 times 10^52 erg) than the model for sn 1998bw, implying a massiveprogenitor (40 - 50 solar mass). the mass at high velocity is not very large(1.4 solar mass above 30000 km/s, but only 0.1 solar mass above 60000 km/s),but is sufficient to cause the observed broad lines. the similarity of sne2003lw and 1998bw and the weakness of their related grbs, grb031203 andgrb980425, suggest that both grbs may be normal events viewed slightly off-axisor a weaker but possibly more frequent type of grb.

astro-ph;0603535	towards a cosmological hubble diagram for type ii-p supernovae	we present the first high-redshift hubble diagram for type ii-p supernovae(sne ii-p) based upon five events at redshift up to z~0.3. this diagram wasconstructed using photometry from the canada-france-hawaii telescope supernovalegacy survey and absorption line spectroscopy from the keck observatory. themethod used to measure distances to these supernovae is based on recent work byhamuy &amp; pinto (2002) and exploits a correlation between the absolute brightnessof sne ii-p and the expansion velocities derived from the minimum of the fe ii516.9 nm p-cygni feature observed during the plateau phases. we present threerefinements to this method which significantly improve the practicality ofmeasuring the distances of sne ii-p at cosmologically interesting redshifts.these are an extinction correction measurement based on the v-i colors at day50, a cross-correlation measurement for the expansion velocity and the abilityto extrapolate such velocities accurately over almost the entire plateau phase.we apply this revised method to our dataset of high-redshift sne ii-p and findthat the resulting hubble diagram has a scatter of only 0.26 magnitudes, thusdemonstrating the feasibility of measuring the expansion history, with presentfacilities, using a method independent of that based upon supernovae of typeia.

astro-ph;0608029	on the progenitor of sn 2005gl and the nature of type iin supernovae	we present a study of the type iin supernova (sn) 2005gl, in the relativelynearby (d~66 mpc) galaxy ngc 266. photometry and spectroscopy of the snindicate it is a typical member of its class. pre-explosion hubble spacetelescope (hst) imaging of the location of the sn, along with a preciselocalization of this event using the laser-guide-star assisted adaptive optics(lgs-ao) system at keck observatory, are combined to identify a luminous(m_v=-10.3) point source as the possible progenitor of sn 2005gl. if the sourceis indeed a single star, it was likely a member of the class of luminous bluevariable stars (lbvs). this finding leads us to consider the possible generalassociation of sne iin with lbv progenitors. we find this is indeed supportedby observations of other sne, and the known properties of lbv stars. forexample, we argue that should the prototypical galactic lbv eta carina explodein a phase similar to its current state, it will likely produce a type iin sn.we discuss our findings in the context of current ideas about the evolution ofmassive stars, and review the census of sne with identified progenitors. weintroduce the concept of the progenitor-sn map as a convenient means to discussthe present status and future prospects of direct searches for sn progenitors.we conclude that this field has matured considerably in recent years, and thetransition from anecdotal information about rare single events to robustassociations of progenitor classes with specific sn types has already begun.

astro-ph;0610129	bayesian single-epoch photometric classification of supernovae	(abridged) ongoing supernova (sn) surveys find hundreds of candidates, thatrequire confirmation for their use. traditional classification based onfollowup spectroscopy of all candidates is virtually impossible for these largesamples. we present an automatic bayesian classifying algorithm for supernovae,the sn-abc. we rely solely on single-epoch multiband photometry and host-galaxy(photometric) redshift information to sort sn candidates into the two majortypes, ia and core-collapse supernovae. we test the sn-abc performance onpublished samples of sne from the snls and goods projects that have bothbroad-band photometry and spectroscopic classification (so the true type isknown). the sn-abc correctly classifies up to 97% (85%) of the type ia (ii-p)sne in snls, and similar fractions of the goods sne, depending on photometricredshift quality. using simulations with large artificial samples, we findsimilarly high success fractions for type ia and ii-p, and reasonable (~75%)success rates in classifying type ibc sne as core-collapse. type iin sne,however, are often misclassified as ia's. in deep surveys, sne ia are bestclassified at redshifts z &gt;~ 0.6, or when near maximum, with success rates ofthe order of 95%. core-collapse sne are best recognized several weeks aftermaximum, or at z &lt;~ 0.6, and reach success rates near 80%. assuming the sne areyoung, as would be the case for rolling surveys, the success fractions improve,by a degree dependent on the type and redshift. the sn-abc also allows therejection of sn "impostors" such as active galactic nuclei (agns), with half ofof the agns we simulate rejected by the algorithm. our algorithm also suppliesa good measure of the quality of the classification, which is valuable forerror estimation.

astro-ph;0610228	supernovae in low-redshift galaxy clusters: the type-ia supernova rate	supernova (sn) rates are a potentially powerful diagnostic of star formationhistory (sfh), metal enrichment, and sn physics, particularly in galaxyclusters with their deep, metal-retaining potentials, and simple sfh. however,a low-redshift cluster sn rate has never been published. we derive the sn ratein galaxy clusters at 0.06&lt;z&lt;0.19, based on type ia supernovae (sne ia) thatwere discovered by the wise observatory optical transient survey. as describedin a separate paper, a sample of 140 rich abell clusters was monitored, inwhich six cluster sne ia were found and confirmed spectroscopically. here, wedetermine the sn detection efficiencies of the individual survey images, andcombine the efficiencies with the known spectral properties of sne ia tocalculate the effective visibility time of the survey. the cluster stellarluminosities are measured from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) database inthe griz sdss bands. uncertainties are estimated using monte-carlo simulationsin which all input parameters are allowed to vary over their knowndistributions. we derive sn rates normalized by stellar luminosity, in snuunits (sne per century per 10^10 l_sun) in five photometric bandpasses, of0.36+/-(0.22,0.14)+/-0.02 (b), 0.351+/-(0.210,0.139)+/-0.020 (g),0.288+/-(0.172,0.114)+/-0.018 (r), 0.229+/-(0.137,0.091)+/-0.014 (i),0.186+/-(0.111,0.074)+/-0.010 (z), where the quoted errors are statistical andsystematic, respectively. the sn rate per stellar mass unit, derived using acolor-luminosity-mass relation, is 0.098+/-(0.059,0.039)+/-0.009 sne (century10^10 m_sun)^-1. the low cluster sn rates we find are similar to, andconsistent with, the sn ia rate in local elliptical galaxies.

0809.1881	an upper mass limit on a red supergiant progenitor for the type  ii-plateau supernova sn 2006my	we analyze two pre-supernova (sn) and three post-sn high-resolution images ofthe site of the type ii-plateau supernova sn 2006my in an effort to eitherdetect the progenitor star or to constrain its properties. following imageregistration, we find that an isolated stellar object is not detected at thelocation of sn 2006my in either of the two pre-sn images. in the first, ani-band image obtained with the wide-field and planetary camera 2 on board thehubble space telescope, the offset between the sn 2006my location and adetected source ("source 1") is too large: &gt; 0.08", which corresponds to aconfidence level of non-association of 96% from our most liberal estimates ofthe transformation and measurement uncertainties. in the second, a similarlyobtained v-band image, a source is detected ("source 2") that has overlap withthe sn 2006my location but is definitively an extended object. throughartificial star tests carried out on the precise location of sn 2006my in theimages, we derive a 3-sigma upper bound on the luminosity of a red supergiantthat could have remained undetected in our pre-sn images of log l/l_sun = 5.10,which translates to an upper bound on such a star's initial mass of 15 m_sunfrom the stars stellar evolutionary models. although considered unlikely, wecan not rule out the possibility that part of the light comprising source 1,which exhibits a slight extension relative to other point sources in the image,or part of the light contributing to the extended source 2, may be due to theprogenitor of sn 2006my. only additional, high-resolution observations of thesite taken after sn 2006my has faded beyond detection can confirm or rejectthese possibilities.

astro-ph;9612159	a survey for large image-separation lensed quasars	the statistics of gravitationally lensed quasars with multiple images in the0.1''-7'' range have been measured in various surveys. little is known,however, about lensed-quasar statistics at larger image separations, whichprobe masses on the scale of galaxy clusters. we extend the results of the hstsnapshot survey for lensed quasars to the 7''-50'' range for a sub-sample of 76quasars that is free of known selection effects. using a combination ofmulticolor photometry and spectroscopy, we show that none of the point sourcesin the entire field of view of the hst observations of these quasars are lensedimages. large-separation quasar lensing is therefore not common. we carry out adetailed calculation of the expected statistics of large-separation lensing forthis quasar sample, incorporating realistic input for the mass profiles andmass function of galaxy clusters. we find that the observational null resultsare consistent with the expected effect of galaxy clusters, even if these haveexisted in their present form and number since z of about 2. the rarity oflarge-separation lensed quasars can rule out some extreme scenarios, e.g. thatthe mass-function of clusters has been severely underestimated, or that largemass concentrations that are not associated with galaxies (i.e. ``failed''clusters) are common. the rareness of wide lensing also sets limits on thecosmological constant that are independent of limits derived from galaxylensing. the lensing statistics of larger quasar samples can probe thestructure, number, and evolution of clusters, as well as the geometry of space.
