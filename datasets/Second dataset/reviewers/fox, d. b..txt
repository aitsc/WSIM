0902.0761	the redshift and afterglow of the extremely energetic gamma-ray burst  grb 080916c	the detection of gev photons from gamma-ray bursts (grbs) has importantconsequences for the interpretation and modelling of these most-energeticcosmological explosions. the full exploitation of the high-energy measurementsrelies, however, on the accurate knowledge of the distance to the events. herewe report on the discovery of the afterglow and subsequent redshiftdetermination of grb 080916c, the first grb detected by the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope with high significance detection of photons at &gt;0.1 gev.observations were done with 7-channel imager grond at the 2.2m mpi/esotelescope, the sirius instrument at the nagoya-saao 1.4m telescope in southafrica, and the gmos instrument at gemini-s. the afterglow photometric redshiftof z=4.35+-0.15, based on simultaneous 7-filter observations with the gamma-rayoptical and near-infrared detector (grond), places grb 080916c among the top 5%most distant grbs, and makes it the most energetic grb known to date. thedetection of gev photons from such a distant event is rather surprising.  the observed gamma-ray variability in the prompt emission together with theredshift suggests a lower limit for the lorentz factor of theultra-relativistic ejecta of gamma &gt; 1090. this value rivals any previousmeasurements of gamma in grbs and strengthens the extreme nature of grb080916c.

0905.0690	the collimation and energetics of the brightest swift gamma-ray bursts	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are widely believed to behighly-collimated explosions (opening angle theta ~ 1-10 deg). as a result ofthis beaming factor, the true energy release from a grb is usually severalorders of magnitude smaller than the observed isotropic value. measuring thisopening angle, typically inferred from an achromatic steepening in theafterglow light curve (a "jet" break), has proven exceedingly difficult in theswift era. here we undertake a study of five of the brightest (in terms of theisotropic prompt gamma-ray energy release, e(gamma, iso)) grbs in the swift erato search for jet breaks and hence constrain the collimation-corrected energyrelease. we present multi-wavelength (radio through x-ray) observations of grbs050820a, 060418, and 080319b, and construct afterglow models to extract theopening angle and beaming-corrected energy release for all three events.together with results from previous analyses of grbs 050904 and 070125, we findevidence for an achromatic jet break in all five events, strongly supportingthe canonical picture of grbs as collimated explosions. the most naturalexplanation for the lack of observed jet breaks from most swift grbs istherefore selection effects. however, the opening angles for the events in oursample are larger than would be expected if all grbs had a canonical energyrelease of ~ 10e51 erg. the total energy release we measure for those"hyper-energetic" (e(total) &gt;~ 10e52 erg) events in our sample is large enoughto start challenging models with a magnetar as the compact central remnant.

0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

0906.2003	a faint type of supernova from a white dwarf with a helium-rich  companion	supernovae (sne) are thought to arise from two different physical processes.the cores of massive, short-lived stars undergo gravitational core collapse andtypically eject a few solar masses during their explosion. these are thought toappear as as type ib/c and ii sne, and are associated with young stellarpopulations. a type ia sn is thought to arise from the thermonuclear detonationof a white dwarf star composed mainly of carbon and oxygen, whose massapproaches the chandrasekhar limit. such sne are observed in both young and oldstellar environments. here we report our discovery of the faint type ib sn2005e in the halo of the nearby isolated galaxy, ngc 1032.  the lack of any trace of recent star formation near the sn location (fig. 1),and the very low derived ejected mass (~0.3 m_sun), argue strongly against acore-collapse origin for this event. spectroscopic observations and the derivednucleosynthetic output show that the sn ejecta have high velocities and aredominated by helium-burning products, indicating that sn 2005e was neither asubluminous nor a regular sn ia (fig. 2). we have therefore found a new type ofstellar explosion, arising from a low-mass, old stellar system, likelyinvolving a binary with a primary white dwarf and a helium-rich secondary. thesn ejecta contain more calcium than observed in any known type of sn and likelyadditional large amounts of radioactive 44ti. such sne may thus help resolvefundamental physical puzzles, extending from the composition of the primitivesolar system and that of the oldest stars, to the galactic production ofpositrons.

0906.5350	the palomar transient factory: system overview, performance and first  results	the palomar transient factory (ptf) is a fully-automated, wide-field surveyaimed at a systematic exploration of the optical transient sky. the transientsurvey is performed using a new 8.1 square degree camera installed on the48-inch samuel oschin telescope at palomar observatory; colors and light curvesfor detected transients are obtained with the automated palomar 60-inchtelescope. ptf uses eighty percent of the 1.2-m and fifty percent of the 1.5-mtelescope time. with an exposure of 60-s the survey reaches a depth ofapproximately 21.3 in g' and 20.6 in r (5 sigma, median seeing). four majorexperiments are planned for the five-year project: 1) a 5-day cadence supernovasearch; 2) a rapid transient search with cadences between 90 seconds and 1 day;3) a search for eclipsing binaries and transiting planets in orion; and 4) a3-pi sr deep h-alpha survey. ptf provides automatic, realtime transientclassification and follow up, as well as a database including every sourcedetected in each frame. this paper summarizes the ptf project, includingseveral months of on-sky performance tests of the new survey camera, theobserving plans and the data reduction strategy. we conclude by detailing thefirst 51 ptf optical transient detections, found in commissioning data.

0908.0940	discovery of the very red near-infrared and optical afterglow of the  short-duration grb 070724a	[abridged] we report the discovery of the near-infrared and optical afterglowof the short-duration gamma-ray burst grb070724a. the afterglow is detected ini,j,h,k observations starting 2.3 hr after the burst with k=19.59+/-0.16 magand i=23.79+/-0.07 mag, but is absent in images obtained 1.3 years later.fading is also detected in the k-band between 2.8 and 3.7 hr at a 4-sigmasignificance level. the optical/near-ir spectral index, beta_{o,nir}=-2, ismuch redder than expected in the standard afterglow model, pointing to eithersignificant dust extinction, a_{v,host}~2 mag, or a non-afterglow origin forthe near-ir emission. the case for extinction is supported by a shallow opticalto x-ray spectral index, consistent with the definition for ``dark bursts'',and a normal near-ir to x-ray spectral index. moreover, a comparison to theoptical discovery magnitudes of all short grbs with optical afterglowsindicates that the near-ir counterpart of grb070724a is one of the brightest todate, while its observed optical emission is one of the faintest. in thecontext of a non-afterglow origin, the near-ir emission may be dominated by amini-supernova, leading to an estimated ejected mass of m~10^-4 msun and aradioactive energy release efficiency of f~0.005 (for v~0.3c). however, themini-sn model predicts a spectral peak in the uv rather than near-ir,suggesting that this is either not the correct interpretation or that themini-sn models need to be revised. finally, the afterglow coincides with a starforming galaxy at z=0.457, previously identified as the host based on itscoincidence with the x-ray afterglow position (~2" radius). our discovery ofthe optical/near-ir afterglow makes this association secure.

1004.2900	afterglow observations of fermi-lat gamma-ray bursts and the emerging  class of hyper-energetic events	we present broadband (radio, optical, and x-ray) light curves and spectra ofthe afterglows of four long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs 090323, 090328,090902b, and 090926a) detected by the gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) and largearea telescope (lat) instruments on the fermi satellite. with its wide spectralbandpass, extending to gev energies, fermi is sensitive to grbs with very largeisotropic energy releases (10e54 erg). although rare, these events areparticularly important for testing grb central-engine models. when combinedwith spectroscopic redshifts, our afterglow data for these four events are ableto constrain jet collimation angles, the density structure of the circumburstmedium, and both the true radiated energy release and the kinetic energy of theoutflows. in agreement with our earlier work, we find that the relativisticenergy budget of at least one of these events (grb 090926a) exceeds thecanonical value of 10e51 erg by an order of magnitude. such energies pose asevere challenge for models in which the grb is powered by a magnetar orneutrino-driven collapsar, but remain compatible with theoretical expectationsfor magneto-hydrodynamical (mhd) collapsar models. our jet opening angles(theta) are similar to those found for pre-fermi grbs, but the large initiallorentz factors (gamma_0) inferred from the detection of gev photons implytheta gamma_0 ~ 70-90, values which are above those predicted in mhd models ofjet acceleration. finally, we find that these fermi-lat events preferentiallyoccur in a low-density circumburst environment, and we speculate that thismight result from the lower mass-loss rates of their lower-metallicityprogenitor stars. future studies of fermi-lat afterglows in the radio with theorder-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity offered by the evla shoulddefinitively establish the relativistic energy budgets of these events.

1007.2185	the unusual x-ray emission of the short swift grb 090515: evidence for  the formation of a magnetar?	the majority of short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to originate fromthe merger of compact binary systems collapsing directly to form a black hole.however, it has been proposed that both sgrbs and long gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs)may, on rare occasions, form an unstable millisecond pulsar (magnetar) prior tofinal collapse. grb 090515, detected by the swift satellite was extremelyshort, with a t_90 of 0.036 +/- 0.016 s, and had a very low fluence of 2 x10^-8 erg cm^-2 and faint optical afterglow. despite this, the 0.3 - 10 kevflux in the first 200 s was the highest observed for a sgrb by the swift x-raytelescope (xrt). the x-ray light curve showed an unusual plateau and steepdecay, becoming undetectable after ~500 s. this behaviour is similar to thatobserved in some long bursts proposed to have magnetars contributing to theiremission. in this paper, we present the swift observations of grb 090515 andcompare it to other gamma-ray bursts (grbs) in the swift sample. additionally,we present optical observations from gemini, which detected an afterglow ofmagnitude 26.4 +/- 0.1 at t+ 1.7 hours after the burst. we discuss potentialcauses of the unusual 0.3 - 10 kev emission and suggest it might be energyinjection from an unstable millisecond pulsar. using the duration and flux ofthe plateau of grb 090515, we place constraints on the millisecond pulsar spinperiod and magnetic field.

1011.4959	the first systematic study of type ibc supernova multi-band light curves	we present detailed optical photometry for 25 type ibc supernovae withind\approx150 mpc obtained with the robotic palomar 60-inch telescope in2004-2007. this study represents the first uniform, systematic, and statisticalsample of multi-band sne ibc light curves available to date. we correct thelight curves for host galaxy extinction using a new technique based on thephotometric color evolution, namely, we show that the (v-r) color ofextinction-corrected sne ibc at t\approx10 days after v-band maximum is tightlydistributed, (v-r)=0.26+-0.06 mag. using this technique, we find that sne ibctypically suffer from significant host galaxy extinction, e(b-v)\approx0.4 mag.a comparison of the extinction-corrected light curves for sne ib and ic revealsthat they are statistically indistinguishable, both in luminosity and declinerate. we report peak absolute magnitudes of m_r=-17.9+-0.9 mag andm_r=-18.3+-0.6 mag for sne ib and ic, respectively. focusing on the broad-linedsne ic, we find that they are more luminous than the normal sne ibc sample,m_r=-19.0+-1.1 mag, with a probability of only 1.6% that they are drawn fromthe same population of explosions. by comparing the peak absolute magnitudes ofsne ic-bl with those inferred for local engine-driven explosions (grb-sn1998bw, xrf-sn 2006aj, and sn2009bb) we find a 25% probability that they aredrawn from the sne ic-bl population. finally, we fit analytic models to thelight-curves to derive typical ni-56 masses of m_ni \approx0.2 and 0.5 m_sunfor sne ibc and sne ic-bl, respectively. with reasonable assumptions for thephotospheric velocities, we extract kinetic energy and ejecta mass values ofm_ej \approx 2 m_sun and e_k\approx1e+51 erg for sne ibc, while for sne ic-blwe find higher values, m_ej\approx5 m_sun and e_k\approx1e+52 erg. we discussthe implications for the progenitors of sne ibc and their relation toengine-driven explosions [abridged].

1105.4915	a photometric redshift of z ~ 9.4 for grb 090429b	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) serve as powerful probes of the early universe, withtheir luminous afterglows revealing the locations and physical properties ofstar forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and potentially locating firstgeneration (population iii) stars. since grb afterglows have intrinsically verysimple spectra, they allow robust redshifts from low signal to noisespectroscopy, or photometry. here we present a photometric redshift of z~9.4for the swift-detected grb 090429b based on deep observations withgemini-north, the very large telescope, and the grb optical and near-infrareddetector. assuming a small magellanic cloud dust law (which has been found in amajority of grb sight-lines), the 90% likelihood range for the redshift is 9.06&lt; z &lt; 9.52, although there is a low-probability tail to somewhat lowerredshifts. adopting milky way or large magellanic cloud dust laws leads to verysimilar conclusions, while a maiolino law does allow somewhat lower redshiftsolutions, but in all cases the most likely redshift is found to be z&gt;7. thenon-detection of the host galaxy to deep limits (y_ab &gt;~ 28 mag, which wouldcorrespond roughly to 0.001 l* at z=1) in our late time optical and infraredobservations with the hubble space telescope strongly supports the extremeredshift origin of grb 090429b, since we would expect to have detected anylow-z galaxy, even if it were highly dusty. finally, the energetics of grb090429b are comparable to those of other grbs, and suggest that its progenitoris not greatly different to those of lower redshift bursts.

1106.3073	the spectroscopic classification and explosion properties of sn2009nz  associated with grb091127 at z=0.490	we present spectroscopic observations of grb091127 (z=0.490) at the peak ofthe putative associated supernova, sn2009nz. subtracting a late-time spectrumof the host galaxy, we isolate the contribution of sn2009nz and uncover broadfeatures typical of nearby grb-sne. this establishes unambiguously thatgrb091127 was accompanied by a broad-lined type ic sn, and links a cosmologicallong burst with a standard energy release (e_gamma,iso ~ 1.1e52 erg) to amassive star progenitor. the spectrum of sn2009nz closely resembles that ofsn2006aj, with sn2003dh also providing an acceptable match, but hassignificantly narrower features than sne 1998bw and 2010bh, indicative of alower expansion velocity. the photospheric velocity inferred from the siii 6355absorption feature, v_ph ~ 17,000 km/s, is indeed closer to that of sne 2006ajand 2003dh than to the other grb-sne. combining the measured velocity with thelight curve peak brightness and width, we estimate the following explosionparameters: m_ni ~ 0.35 m_sun, e_k ~ 2.3e51 erg, and m_ej ~ 1.4 m_sun, similarto those of sn2006aj. these properties indicate that sn2009nz follows a trendof lower m_ni for grb-sne with lower e_k and m_ej. equally important, sincegrb091127 is a typical cosmological burst, the similarity of sn2009nz tosn2006aj either casts doubt on the claim that xrf060218/sn2006aj was powered bya neutron star, or indicates that the nature of the central engine is encodedin the sn properties but not in the prompt emission. future spectra of grb-sneat z &gt; 0.3, including proper subtraction of the host galaxy contribution, willshed light on the full dispersion of sn properties for standard long grbs, onthe relation between sne associated with sub-energetic and standard grbs, andon a potential dispersion in the associated sn types.

1211.6528	an independent measurement of the incidence of mgii absorbers along  gamma-ray burst sightlines: the end of the mystery?	in 2006, prochter et al. reported a statistically significant enhancement ofvery strong mg ii absorption systems intervening the sightlines to gamma-raybursts (grbs) relative to the in- cidence of such absorption along quasarsightlines. this counterintuitive result, has inspired a diverse set ofastrophysical explanations (e.g. dust, gravitational lensing) but none of thesehas obviously resolved the puzzle. using the largest set of grb afterglowspectra available, we reexamine the purported enhancement. in an independentsample of grb spectra with a survey path 3 times larger than prochter et al.,we measure the incidence per unit redshift of $\geq 1$\aa rest-frame equivalentwidth mg ii absorbers at $z \approx 1$ to be l(z)= 0.18 $\pm$ 0.06. this isfully consistent with current estimates for the incidence of such absorbersalong quasar sightlines. therefore, we do not confirm the original enhancementand suggest those results suffered from a statistical fluke. signatures of theoriginal result do remain in our full sample (l(z) shows an $\approx 1.5$enhancement over l(z)qso), but the statistical significance now lies at$\approx 90%$ c.l. restricting our analysis to the subset of high-resolutionspectra of grb afterglows (which overlaps substantially with prochter et al.),we still reproduce a statistically significant enhancement of mg ii absorption.the reason for this excess, if real, is still unclear since there is noconnection between the rapid afterglow follow-up process with echelle (orechellette) spectrographs and the detectability of strong mg ii doublets. onlya larger sample of such high-resolution data will shed some light on thismatter.

1302.2352	a new population of ultra-long duration gamma-ray bursts	we present comprehensive multiwavelength observations of three gamma-raybursts (grbs) with durations of several thousand seconds. we demonstrate thatthese events are extragalactic transients; in particular we resolve thelong-standing conundrum of the distance of grb 101225a (the "christmas-dayburst"), finding it to have a redshift z=0.847, and showing that two apparentlysimilar events (grb 111209a and grb 121027a) lie at z=0.677 and z=1.773respectively. the systems show extremely unusual x-ray and optical lightcurves,very different from classical grbs, with long lasting highly variable x-rayemission and optical light curves that exhibit little correlation with thebehaviour seen in the x-ray. their host galaxies are faint, compact, and highlystar forming dwarf galaxies, typical of "blue compact galaxies". we proposethat these bursts are the prototypes of a hitherto largely unrecognizedpopulation of ultra-long grbs, that while observationally difficult to detectmay be astrophysically relatively common. the long durations may naturally beexplained by the engine driven explosions of stars of much larger radii thannormally considered for grb progenitors which are thought to have compactwolf-rayet progenitor stars. however, we cannot unambiguously identifysupernova signatures within their light curves or spectra. we also consider thealternative possibility that they arise from the tidal disruption of stars bysupermassive black holes.

1305.6606	sub-pev neutrinos from tev unidentified sources in the galaxy	the icecube collaboration discovery of 28 high-energy neutrinos over theenergy range 30 tev &lt;~ e_nu &lt;~ 1 pev, a 4.3-sigma excess over expectedbackgrounds, represents the first high-confidence detection of cosmic neutrinosat these energies. in light of this discovery, we explore the possibility thatsome of the sub-pev cosmic neutrinos might originate in our galaxy's tevunidentified (tev unid) sources. while typically resolved at tev energies,these sources lack prominent radio or x-ray counterparts, and so have beenconsidered promising sites for hadron acceleration within our galaxy. modelingthe tev unid sources as galactic hypernova remnants, we predict sub-pevneutrino fluxes and spectra consistent with their contributing a minority ofn_nu &lt;~ 2 of the observed events. this is consistent with our analysis of thespatial distribution of the sub-pev neutrinos and tev unid sources, which findsthat a best-fit of one, and maximum of 3.8 (at 90%-confidence), of the ~16non-atmospheric sub-pev neutrinos may originate in tev unid sources, with theremaining 75% to 95% of events being drawn from an isotropic background. if ourscenario is correct, we expect excess sub-pev neutrinos to accumulate along thegalactic plane, within |l| &lt;~ 30 deg of the galactic center and in the cygnusregion, as observations by icecube and other high-energy neutrino facilities goforward. our scenario also has implications for radio, x-ray, and tevobservations of the tev unid sources.

1307.2366	a multi-wavelength investigation of the radio-loud supernova ptf11qcj  and its circumstellar environment	we present the discovery, classification, and extensive panchromatic (fromradio to x-ray) follow-up observations of ptf11qcj, a supernova discovered bythe palomar transient factory. ptf11qcj is located at a distance of dl ~ 124mpc. our observations with the karl g. jansky very large array show that thisevent is radio-loud: ptf11qcj reached a radio peak luminosity comparable tothat of the famous gamma-ray-burst-associated supernova 1998bw (l_{5ghz} ~10^{29} erg/s/hz). ptf11qcj is also detected in x-rays with the chandraobservatory, and in the infrared band with spitzer. our multi-wavelengthanalysis probes the supernova interaction with circumstellar material. theradio observations suggest a progenitor mass-loss rate of ~10^{-4} msun/yr x(v_w/1000 km/s), and a velocity of ~(0.3-0.5)c for the fastest moving ejecta(at ~10d after explosion). however, these estimates are derived assuming thesimplest model of supernova ejecta interacting with a smooth circumstellarmaterial characterized by radial power-law density profile, and do not accountfor possible inhomogeneities in the medium and asphericity of the explosion.the radio light curve shows deviations from such a simple model, as well as are-brightening at late times. the x-ray flux from ptf11qcj is compatible withthe high-frequency extrapolation of the radio synchrotron emission (within thelarge uncertainties). an ir light echo from pre-existing dust is in agreementwith our infrared data. our analysis of pre-explosion data from the palomartransient factory suggests that a precursor eruption of absolute magnitude m_r~ -13 mag may have occurred ~ 2.5 yr prior to the supernova explosion. based onour panchromatic follow-up campaign, we conclude that ptf11qcj fits theexpectations from the explosion of a wolf-rayet star. precursor eruptions maybe a feature characterizing the final pre-explosion evolution of such stars.

1403.0939	multi-wavelength coverage of state transitions in the new black hole  x-ray binary swift j1910.2-0546	understanding how black holes accrete and supply feedback to theirenvironment is one of the outstanding challenges of modern astrophysics. swiftj1910.2-0546 is a candidate black hole low-mass x-ray binary that wasdiscovered in 2012 when it entered an accretion outburst. to investigate thebinary configuration and the accretion morphology we monitored the evolution ofthe outburst for ~3 months at x-ray, uv, optical (b,v,r,i), and near-infrared(j,h,k) wavelengths using swift and smarts. the source evolved from a hard to asoft x-ray spectral state with a relatively cold accretion disk that peaked at~0.5 kev. a chandra/hetg spectrum obtained during this soft state did notreveal signatures of an ionized disk wind. both the low disk temperature andthe absence of a detectable wind could indicate that the system is viewed atrelatively low inclination. the multi-wavelength light curves revealed twonotable features that appear to be related to x-ray state changes. firstly, aprominent flux decrease was observed in all wavebands ~1-2 weeks before thesource entered the soft state. this dip occurred in (0.6-10 kev) x-rays ~6 dayslater than at longer wavelengths, which could possibly reflect the viscous timescale of the disk. secondly, about two weeks after the source transitioned backinto the hard state, the uv emission significantly increased while the x-rayssteadily decayed. we discuss how these observations may reflect changes in theaccretion flow morphology, perhaps related to the quenching/launch of a jet orthe collapse/recovery of a hot flow.

1405.7400	grb 140515a at z=6.33: constraints on the end of reionization from a  gamma-ray burst in a low hydrogen column density environment	we present the discovery and subsequent spectroscopy with gemini-north of theoptical afterglow of the swift gamma-ray burst (grb) 140515a. the spectrumexhibits a well-detected continuum at wavelengths longer than 8915 angs with asteep decrement to zero flux blueward of 8910 angs due to ly-alpha absorptionat redshift z~6.33. some transmission through the lyman-alpha forest is presentat 5.2&lt;z&lt;5.733, but none is detected at higher redshift, consistent withprevious measurements from quasars and grb 130606a. we model the red dampingwing of lyman-alpha in three ways that provide equally good fits to the data:(a) a single host galaxy absorber at z=6.327 with log(n_hi)=18.62+/-0.08; (b)pure intergalactic medium (igm) absorption from z=6.0 to z=6.328 with aconstant neutral hydrogen fraction of x_hi=0.056+0.011-0.027; and (c) a hybridmodel with a host absorber located within an ionized bubble of radius 10comoving mpc in an igm with x_hi=0.12+/-0.05 (x_hi&lt;0.21 at the 2-sigma level).regardless of the model, the sharpness of the dropoff in transmission isinconsistent with a substantial neutral fraction in the igm at this redshift.no narrow absorption lines from the host galaxy are detected, indicating a hostmetallicity of [z/h]&lt;~ -0.8. even if we assume that all of the hydrogenabsorption is due to the host galaxy, the column is unusually low for a grbsightline, similar to two out of the other three highest-redshift bursts withmeasured log(n_hi). this is possible evidence that the escape fraction ofionizing photons from normal star-forming galaxies increases at z&gt;~6.

0804.1354	ogle-2005-blg-071lb, the most massive m-dwarf planetary companion?	we combine all available information to constrain the nature ofogle-2005-blg-071lb, the second planet discovered by microlensing and the firstin a high-magnification event. these include photometric and astrometricmeasurements from hubble space telescope, as well as constraints from higherorder effects extracted from the ground-based light curve, such as microlensparallax, planetary orbital motion and finite-source effects. our primaryanalysis leads to the conclusion that the host of jovian planetogle-2005-blg-071lb is an m dwarf in the foreground disk with mass m= 0.46 +/-0.04 msun, distance d_l = 3.3 +/- 0.4 kpc, and thick-disk kinematics v_lsr ~103 km/s. from the best-fit model, the planet has mass m_p = 3.8 +/- 0.4 m_jup,lies at a projected separation r_perp = 3.6 +/- 0.2 au from its host and so hasan equilibrium temperature of t ~ 55 k, i.e., similar to neptune. a degeneratemodel less favored by \delta\chi^2 = 2.1 (or 2.2, depending on the sign of theimpact parameter) gives similar planetary mass m_p = 3.4 +/- 0.4 m_jup with asmaller projected separation, r_\perp = 2.1 +/- 0.1 au, and higher equilibriumtemperature t ~ 71 k. these results from the primary analysis suggest thatogle-2005-blg-071lb is likely to be the most massive planet yet discovered thatis hosted by an m dwarf. however, the formation of such high-mass planetarycompanions in the outer regions of m-dwarf planetary systems is predicted to beunlikely within the core-accretion scenario. there are a number of caveats tothis primary analysis, which assumes (based on real but limited evidence) thatthe unlensed light coincident with the source is actually due to the lens, thatis, the planetary host. however, these caveats could mostly be resolved by asingle astrometric measurement a few years after the event.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

astro-ph;0509273	very early optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts: evidence for relative  paucity of detection	very early observations with the swift satellite of gamma-ray burst (grb)afterglows reveal that the optical component is not detected in a large numberof cases. this is in contrast to the bright optical flashes previouslydiscovered in some grbs (e.g. grb 990123 and grb 021211). comparisons of thex-ray afterglow flux to the optical afterglow flux and prompt gamma-ray fluenceis used to quantify the seemingly deficient optical, and in some cases x-ray,light at these early epochs. this comparison reveals that some of these burstsappear to have higher than normal gamma-ray efficiencies. we discuss possiblemechanisms and their feasibility for explaining the apparent lack of earlyoptical emission. the mechanisms considered include: foreground extinction,circumburst absorption, ly-alpha blanketing and absorption due to highredshift, low density environments, rapid temporal decay, and intrinsicweakness of the reverse shock. of these, foreground extinction, circumburstabsorption, and high redshift provide the best explanations for most of thenon-detections in our sample. there is tentative evidence of suppression of thestrong reverse shock emission. this could be because of apoynting-flux-dominated flow or a pure non-relativistic hydrodynamical reverseshock.

astro-ph;0509891	the progenitors of short-hard gamma-ray bursts from an extended sample  of events	the detection of the afterglow emission and host galaxies of short-hardgamma-ray bursts (shbs) is one of the most exciting recent astronomicaldiscoveries. indications that shb progenitors belong to old stellarpopulations, in contrast to those of the long-soft grbs, provide a strong clueabout their physical nature. definitive conclusions however are limited by thesmall number of shbs with known hosts. here, we present our investigation ofshbs previously localized by the interplanetary network (ipn) using new andarchival optical and x-ray observations. we show that we can likely identifythe host galaxies/clusters for additional two bursts, significantly increasingthe sample of shbs with known hosts and/or distances. in particular, wedetermine that the bright shb 790613 occurred within the rich galaxy clusterabell 1892, making it probably the nearest shb currently known. we show thatthe brightest galaxy within the error box of shb 000607, at z=0.14, is mostlikely the host galaxy of this event. additionally, we rule out the existenceof galaxy overdensities (down to ~21mag) near the locations of two other shbs,and set a lower limit on their probable redshift. we combine our shb samplewith events discovered recently by the swift and hete-2 missions, andinvestigate the properties of the extended sample. comparison to sne ia showsthat the progenitors of shbs are typically older, implying a typical life timeof several gy. we also show that it is unlikely that there is a significantpopulation of progenitors with life time shorter than 1gy. this resultdisfavors the popular model of ns-ns mergers as the progenitors of shbs.

astro-ph;0511498	spectroscopy of grb 050505 at z=4.275: a logn(hi)=22.1 dla host galaxy  and the nature of the progenitor	we present the discovery of the optical afterglow of grb 050505 and anoptical absorption spectrum obtained with the keck i 10-m telescope. thespectrum exhibits three redshifted absorption systems with the highest, atz=4.2748, arising in the grb host galaxy. the host absorption system is markedby a damped ly-alpha (dla) feature with a neutral hydrogen column density oflogn(hi)=22.05+/-0.10, higher than that of any qso-dla detected to date, butsimilar to several other recent measurements from grb spectra. in addition, wedetect absorption lines from both low- and high-ionization species from whichwe deduce a metallicity, z~0.06 z_solar, with a depletion pattern that isroughly similar to that of the galactic warm halo, warm disk, or disk+halo.more importantly, we detect strong absorption from siii* indicating a denseenvironment, n_h&gt;10^2 cm^-3, in the vicinity of the burst, with a size of about4 pc. in addition, the civ absorption system spans a velocity range of about1000 km/s, which is not detected in any other absorption feature. we show thatthe most likely interpretation for this wide velocity range is absorption inthe wind from the progenitor star. in this context, the lack of correspondingsiiv absorption indicates that the progenitor had a mass of &lt;25 m_solar and ametallicity &lt;0.1 z_solar, and therefore required a binary companion to ejectits hydrogen envelope prior to the grb explosion. finally, by extending thegrb-dla sample to z~4.3 we show that these objects appear to follow a similarmetallicity-redshift relation as in qso-dlas, but with systematically highermetallicities. it remains to be seen whether this trend is simply due to thehigher neutral hydrogen columns in grb-dlas, or if it is a manifestation ofdifferent star formation properties in grb-dlas.

astro-ph;0512280	fine-structure feii and siii absorption in the spectrum of grb 051111:  implications for the burst environment	we present an analysis of fine-structure transitions of feii and siiidetected in a high-resolution optical spectrum of the afterglow of grb 051111(z=1.54948). the fine-structure absorption features arising from feii* tofeii****, as well as siii*, are confined to a narrow velocity structureextending over +/-30 km/s, which we interpret as the burst local environment,most likely a star forming region. we investigate two scenarios for theexcitation of the fine-structure levels by collisions with electrons andradiative pumping by an infra-red or ultra-violet radiation field produced byintense star formation in the grb environment, or by the grb afterglow itself.we find that the conditions required for collisional excitation of feiifine-structure states cannot be easily reconciled with the relatively weaksiii* absorption. radiative pumping by either ir or uv emission requires &gt;10^3massive hot ob stars within a compact star-forming region a few pc in size, andin the case of ir pumping a large dust content. on the other hand, it ispossible that the grb itself provides the source of ir and/or uv radiation, inwhich case we estimate that the excitation takes place at a distance of ~10-20pc from the burst. detailed radiative transfer calculations are required inorder to verify that excitation of the low-ionization fine-structure states ispossible given the intense uv flux from the burst. still, it is clear that grbabsorption spectroscopy can provide direct information on the mode andconditions of star formation at high redshift.

astro-ph;0601455	the afterglow, energetics and host galaxy of the short-hard gamma-ray  burst 051221a	we present detailed optical, x-ray and radio observations of the brightafterglow of the short gamma-ray burst 051221a obtained with gemini, swift/xrt,and the very large array, as well as optical spectra from which we measure theredshift of the burst, z=0.5464. at this redshift the isotropic-equivalentprompt energy release was about 1.5 x 10^51 erg, and using the standardafterglow synchrotron model we find that the blastwave kinetic energy issimilar, e_k,iso ~ 8.4 x 10^51 erg. an observed jet break at t ~ 5 daysindicates that the opening angle is ~ 7 degrees and the total beaming-correctedenergy is therefore ~ 2.5 x 10^49 erg, comparable to the values inferred forprevious short grbs. we further show that the burst experienced an episode ofenergy injection by a factor of 3.4 between t=1.4 and 3.4 hours, which wasaccompanied by reverse shock emission in the radio band. this result providescontinued evidence that the central engines of short grbs may be activesignificantly longer than the duration of the burst and/or produce a wide rangeof lorentz factors. finally, we show that the host galaxy of grb051221a isactively forming stars at a rate of about 1.6 m_solar/yr, but at the same timeexhibits evidence for an appreciable population of old stars (~ 1 gyr) and nearsolar metallicity. the lack of bright supernova emission and the lowcircumburst density (n ~ 10^-3 cm^-3) continue to support the idea that shortbursts are not related to the death of massive stars and are instead consistentwith a compact object merger. given that the total energy release is a factorof ~ 10 larger than the predicted yield for a neutrino annihilation mechanism,this suggests that magnetohydrodynamic processes may be required to power theburst.

astro-ph;0603689	hst and spitzer observations of the host galaxy of grb 050904: a  metal-enriched, dusty starburst at z=6.295	we present deep hubble space telescope and spitzer space telescopeobservations of the host galaxy of grb 050904 at z=6.295. the host is detectedin the h-band and marginally at 3.6 micron. from these detections, and limitsin the z'-band and 4.5 micron, we infer an extinction-corrected absolutemagnitude, m(uv)=-20.7 mag, or ~l*, a substantial star formation rate of 15solar masses per year, and a stellar mass of a few 10^9 solar masses. acomparison to the published sample of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies atz&gt;5.5 reveals that the host of grb 050904 would evade detection and/orconfirmation in any of the current surveys due to the lack of detectablely-alpha emission, which is likely the result of dust extinction (a[1200]~1.5mag). this suggests that not all luminous starburst galaxies at z~6 arecurrently being accounted for. most importantly, using the metallicity ofz~0.05 solar inferred from the afterglow absorption spectrum, our observationsindicate for the first time that the observed evolution in the mass- andluminosity-metallicity relations from z=0 to z~2 continues on to z&gt;6. the easeof measuring redshifts and metallicities from the afterglow emission suggeststhat in tandem with the next generation ground- and space-based telescopes, agrb mission with dedicated near-ir follow-up can provide unique information onthe evolution of stars and galaxies through the epoch of re-ionization.

astro-ph;0604389	relativistic ejecta from xrf 060218 and the rate of cosmic explosions	over the last decade, long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) including thesubclass of x-ray flashes (xrfs) have been revealed to be a rare variety oftype ibc supernova (sn). while all these events result from the death ofmassive stars, the electromagnetic luminosities of grbs and xrfs exceed thoseof ordinary type ibc sne by many orders of magnitude. the essential physicalprocess that causes a dying star to produce a grb or xrf, and not just an sn,remains the crucial open question. here we present radio and x-ray observationsof xrf 060218 (associated with sn 2006aj), the second nearest grb identifiedto-date, which allow us to measure its total energy and place it in the largercontext of cosmic explosions. we show that this event is 100 times lessenergetic but ten times more common than cosmological grbs. moreover, it isdistinguished from ordinary type ibc sne by the presence of 10^48 erg coupledto mildly-relativistic ejecta, along with a central engine (an accretion-fed,rapidly rotating compact source) which produces x-rays for weeks after theexplosion. this suggests that the production of relativistic ejecta is the keyphysical distinction between grbs/xrfs and ordinary sne, while the nature ofthe central engine (black hole or magnetar) may distinguish typical bursts fromlow-luminosity, spherical events like xrf 060218.

astro-ph;0604580	an energetic afterglow from a distant stellar explosion	we present the discovery of radio afterglow emission from the high redshift(z=6.295) burst grb 050904. the peak flux density for this burst is similar totypical low-redshift gamma-ray bursts (grb). we further show that beyond aredshift of order unity, the flux density of radio afterglows are largelyinsensitive to redshift, consistent with predictions. by combining the existingx-ray, near-infrared and radio measurements, we derive estimates for thekinetic energy and opening angle of the blast wave, and for the density of thecircumburst medium into which it expands. both the kinetic and radiated energyindicate that grb 050904 was an unusally energetic burst (10**52 erg). moreimportantly, we are able to make an in situ measurement of the densitystructure of the circumburst medium. we conclude that grb 050904 exploded intoa constant density medium with n=680 cm**-3, which is two orders of magnitudeabove the nominal value for low-redshift grbs. the next generation ofcentimeter (evla) and millimeter radio instuments (alma) will be able toroutinely detect events like grb 050904 and use them to study magnetic fields,and the atomic and molecular gas in the high redshift universe.

0811.1382	testing the possible intrinsic origin of the excess of very strong mgii  absorbers along grb lines-of-sight	the startling discovery of prochter et al.
