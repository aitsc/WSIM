0902.0761	the redshift and afterglow of the extremely energetic gamma-ray burst  grb 080916c	the detection of gev photons from gamma-ray bursts (grbs) has importantconsequences for the interpretation and modelling of these most-energeticcosmological explosions. the full exploitation of the high-energy measurementsrelies, however, on the accurate knowledge of the distance to the events. herewe report on the discovery of the afterglow and subsequent redshiftdetermination of grb 080916c, the first grb detected by the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope with high significance detection of photons at &gt;0.1 gev.observations were done with 7-channel imager grond at the 2.2m mpi/esotelescope, the sirius instrument at the nagoya-saao 1.4m telescope in southafrica, and the gmos instrument at gemini-s. the afterglow photometric redshiftof z=4.35+-0.15, based on simultaneous 7-filter observations with the gamma-rayoptical and near-infrared detector (grond), places grb 080916c among the top 5%most distant grbs, and makes it the most energetic grb known to date. thedetection of gev photons from such a distant event is rather surprising.  the observed gamma-ray variability in the prompt emission together with theredshift suggests a lower limit for the lorentz factor of theultra-relativistic ejecta of gamma &gt; 1090. this value rivals any previousmeasurements of gamma in grbs and strengthens the extreme nature of grb080916c.

0706.3123	comparative study of the inial spikes of sgr giant flares in 1998 and  2004 observed with geotail: do magnetospheric instabilities trigger large  scale fracturing of magnetar's crust?	we present the unsaturated peak profile of sgr 1900+14 giant flare on 1998august 27. this was obtained by particle counters of the low energy particleinstrument onboard the geotail spacecraft. the observed peak profile revealedfour characteristic structures: initial steep rise, intermediate rise to thepeak, exponential decay and small hump in the decay phase. from this lightcurve, we found that the isotropic peak luminosity was $2.3\times10^{46}$ ergs$^{-1}$ and the total energy was $4.3 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($e\gtrsim$50 kev), assuming that the distance to sgr 1900+14 is 15 kpc and that thespectrum is optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung with $kt =$ 240 kev. theseare consistent with the previously reported lower limits derived from ulyssesand konus-wind observations. a comparative study of the initial spikes of sgr1900+14 giant flare in 1998 and sgr 1806-20 in 2004 is also presented. thetimescale of the initial steep rise shows the magnetospheric origin, while thetimescale of the intermediate rise to the peak indicates that it originatesfrom the crustal fracturing. finally, we argue that the four structures andtheir corresponding timescales provide a clue to identify extragalactic sgrgiant flares among short grbs.

0704.1603	measuring energy dependent polarization in soft gamma-rays using compton  scattering in pogolite	linear polarization in x- and gamma-rays is an important diagnostic of manyastrophysical sources, foremost giving information about their geometry,magnetic fields, and radiation mechanisms. however, very few x-ray polarizationmeasurements have been made, and then only mono-energetic detections, whilstseveral objects are assumed to have energy dependent polarization signatures.in this paper we investigate whether detection of energy dependent polarizationfrom cosmic sources is possible using the compton technique, in particular withthe proposed pogolite balloon-experiment, in the 25-100 kev range. we usegeant4 simulations of a pogolite model and input photon spectra based on cygnusx-1 and accreting magnetic pulsars (100 mcrab). effective observing times of 6and 35 hours were simulated, corresponding to a standard and a long durationflight respectively. both smooth and sharp energy variations of thepolarization are investigated and compared to constant polarization signalsusing chi-square statistics. we can reject constant polarization, with energy,for the cygnus x-1 spectrum (in the hard state), if the reflected component isassumed to be completely polarized, whereas the distinction cannot be made forweaker polarization. for the accreting pulsar, constant polarization can berejected in the case of polarization in a narrow energy band with at least 50%polarization, and similarly for a negative step distribution from 30% to 0%polarization.

1002.4415	constraints on cosmological dark matter annihilation from the fermi-lat  isotropic diffuse gamma-ray measurement	the first published fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat) measurement of theisotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single powerlaw, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from darkmatter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 gev. we use the absolute sizeand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits onthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,charged leptons and monochromatic photons. predicted gamma-ray fluxes fromannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distributionof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structureformation we assess these uncertainties. we also quantify how the dark matterconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on theuniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. in reasonable background anddark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it ispossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons andpositrons measured by the fermi-lat and pamela experiments. derived limits alsostart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. inminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. for themonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only darkmatter scenarios with very strong signals.

1003.3717	"dark" grb 080325 in a dusty massive galaxy at z ~ 2	we present optical and near infrared observations of grb 080325 classified asa "dark grb". near-infrared observations with subaru/moircs provided a cleardetection of afterglow in ks band, although no optical counterpart wasreported. the flux ratio of rest-wavelength optical to x-ray bands of theafterglow indicates that the dust extinction along the line of sight to theafterglow is av = 2.7 - 10 mag. this large extinction is probably the majorreason for optical faintness of grb 080325. the j - ks color of the hostgalaxy, (j - ks = 1.3 in ab magnitude), is significantly redder than those fortypical grb hosts previously identified. in addition to j and ks bands, opticalimages in b, rc, i', and z' bands with subaru/suprime-cam were obtained atabout one year after the burst, and a photometric redshift of the host isestimated to be z_{photo} = 1.9. the host luminosity is comparable to l^{*} atz \sim 2 in contrast to the sub-l^{*} property of typical grb hosts at lowerredshifts. the best-fit stellar population synthesis model for the host showsthat a large dust extinction (av = 0.8 mag) attributes to the red nature of thehost and that the host galaxy is massive (m_{*} = 7.0 \times 10^{10} msun)which is one of the most massive grb hosts previously identified. by assumingthat the mass-metallicity relation for star-forming galaxies at z \sim 2 isapplicable for the grb host, this large stellar mass suggests the highmetallicity environment around grb 080325, consistent with inferred largeextinction.

1310.1175	extraordinary luminous soft x-ray transient maxi j0158-744 as an  ignition of a nova on a very massive o-ne white dwarf	we present the observation of an extraordinary luminous soft x-ray transient,maxi j0158-744, by the monitor of all-sky x-ray image (maxi) on 2011 november11. this transient is characterized by a soft x-ray spectrum, a short duration(1.3 x 10^3 s &lt; \delta t_d &lt; 1.10 x 10^4 s), a very rapid rise (&lt; 5.5 x 10^3s), and a huge peak luminosity of 2 x 10^40 erg s^-1 in 0.7-7.0 kev band. withswift observations and optical spectroscopy from the small and moderateaperture research telescope system (smarts), we confirmed that the transient isa nova explosion, on a white dwarf in a binary with a be star, located near thesmall magellanic cloud. an extremely early turn-on of the super-soft x-raysource (sss) phase (&lt; 0.44 d), the short sss phase duration of about one month,and a 0.92 kev neon emission line found in the third maxi scan, 1296 s afterthe first detection, suggest that the explosion involves a small amount ofejecta and is produced on an unusually massive o-ne white dwarf close to, orpossibly over, the chandrasekhar limit. we propose that the huge luminositydetected with maxi was due to the fireball phase, a direct manifestation of theignition of the thermonuclear runaway process in a nova explosion.

1409.6467	the nature of the late achromatic bump in grb 120326a	the long ${\it swift}$ gamma-ray burst grb 120326a at redshift $z=1.798$exhibited a multi-band light curve with a striking feature: a late-time,long-lasting achromatic rebrightening, rarely seen in such events. peaking inoptical and x-ray bands $\sim 35$ ks ($\sim 12.5$ ks in the grb rest frame)after the 70-s grb prompt burst, the feature brightens nearly two orders ofmagnitude above the underlying optical power-law decay. modelling themultiwavelength light curves, we investigate possible causes of therebrightening in the context of the standard fireball model. we exclude a rangeof scenarios for the origin of this feature: reverse-shock flash, late-timeforward shock peak due to the passage of the maximal synchrotron frequencythrough the optical band, late central engine optical/x-ray flares, interactionbetween the expanding blast wave and a density enhancement in the circumburstmedium and gravitational microlensing. instead we conclude that the achromaticrebrightening may be caused by a refreshed forward shock or a geometricaleffect. in addition, we identify an additional component after the end of theprompt emission, that shapes the observed x-ray and optical light curvesdifferently, ruling out a single overall emission component to explain theobserved early time emission.

astro-ph;0311109	earliest detection of the optical afterglow of grb 030329 and its  variability	we report the earliest detection of an extremely bright optical afterglow ofthe gamma-ray burst (grb) 030329 using a 30cm-telescope at tokyo institute oftechnology (tokyo, japan). our observation started 67 minutes after the burst,and continued for succeeding two nights until the afterglow faded below thesensitivity limit of the telescope (approximately 18 mag). combining our datawith those reported in gcn circulars, we find that the early afterglow lightcurve of the first half day is described by a broken power-law (t^{- alpha})function with indices alpha_{1} = 0.88 +/- 0.01 (0.047 &lt; t &lt; t_{b1} days),alpha_{2} = 1.18 +/- 0.01 (t_{b1} &lt; t &lt; t_{b2} days), and alpha_{3} = 1.81 +/-0.04 (t_{b2} &lt; t &lt; 1.2 days), where t_{b1} ~ 0.26 days and t_{b2} ~ 0.54 days,respectively. the change of the power-law index at the first break at t ~ 0.26days is consistent with that expected from a ``cooling-break'' when the coolingfrequency crossed the optical band. if the interpretation is correct, the decayindex before the cooling-break implies a uniform ism environment.

(2002), a redshift of z=0.38+0.36/-0.18can be determined, in agreement with constraints determined from opticalobservations. we are able to fit the x-ray afterglow spectrum and to measureits temporal fade. although the best-fit fade is shallower than the concurrentfade in the optical, the spectral similarity between the two bands indicatesthat the x-ray fade may actually trace the optical fade. if this is the case,the late time rebrightening observed in the optical cannot be due to asupernova bump. we interpret the prompt and afterglow x-ray emission as arisingfrom a jetted grb observed off-axis and possibly viewed through a complexcircumburst medium due to a progenitor wind.

astro-ph;0507049	chandra observation of the interaction between the hot plasma nebula  rcw89 and the pulsar jet of psr b1509-58	we present a chandra observation of the h ii region rcw89. the nebula lies on10' north from the central pulsar psr b1509-58, and it has been suggested thatthe nebula is irradiated by the pulsar jet. we performed a spectral analysis ofthe seven brightest emitting regions aligned in a ``horse-shoe'' shape, andfound that the temperature of the knots increases along the ``horse-shoe'' inthe clockwise direction, while, in contrast, the ionization parameterdecreases. this strongly supports a picture of energy transfer via theprecessing pulsar jet. we examined the energy budget assuming that rcw89 ispowered by the pulsar jet, and confirmed that the pulsar rotational energy lossis sufficient to drive the nebula. the rate of energy injection into rcw89 bythe jet was estimated from the synchrotron radiation flux. we obtained aheating time-scale of 1400 yr, which is consistent with the pulsarcharacteristic age of 1700 yr. to explain the temperature gradient, we discussthe cooling process for plasma clouds in rcw89. we argue that the plasma cloudscan be cooled down by the adiabatic expansion within 70 yr, and form thetemperature gradient reflecting the sequential heating by the precessing pulsarjet. we also determined the velocities of the individual plasma clouds byspectral fitting. the plasma clouds in rcw89 are moving away at 240 ~ 860 km/s,which constrains the inclination angle of the pulsar spin axis i &gt; 50 degreeand the expanding velocity of the shell as v &gt; 1100 km/s.

0811.3304	intrinsic properties of a complete sample of hete-2 gamma-ray bursts. a  measure of the grb rate in the local universe	aims: taking advantage of the forthcoming catalog of the hete-2 mission, theaim of this paper is to evaluate the main properties of hete-2 grbs - thee_peak, the t_90 and the e_iso - in their source frames and to derive theirunbiased distribution. methods: we first construct a complete sample containingall the bursts localized by the wxm on-board hete-2, which are selected with auniform criterion and whose observed parameters can be constrained. we thenderive the intrinsic e_peak, t_90 and e_iso distributions using their redshiftwhen it is available, or their pseudo-redshift otherwise. we finally computethe number of grb (n_vmax) within the visibility volume (v_max) of each grb, inorder to derive a weight for each detected burst accounting both for thedetection significance and the star formation history of the universe. results:the unbiased distributions obtained clearly show the predominence of x-rayflashes (xrfs) in the global grb population. we also derive the rate of localgrbs: r0^h2 &gt; 11 gpc-3 yr-1, which is intermediate between the local rateobtained by considering only the high-luminosity bursts (~1 gpc-3 yr-1) andthat obtained by including the low-luminosity bursts (&gt;200 gpc-3 yr-1).
