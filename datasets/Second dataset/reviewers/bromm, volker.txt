0902.2372	a new era in extragalactic background light measurements: the cosmic  history of accretion, nucleosynthesis and reionization	(brief summary) what is the total radiative content of the universe since theepoch of recombination? the extragalactic background light (ebl) spectrumcaptures the redshifted energy released from the first stellar objects,protogalaxies, and galaxies throughout cosmic history. yet, we have notdetermined the brightness of the extragalactic sky from uv/optical tofar-infrared wavelengths with sufficient accuracy to establish the radiativecontent of the universe to better than an order of magnitude. among manyscience topics, an accurate measurement of the ebl spectrum from optical tofar-ir wavelengths, will address: what is the total energy released by stellarnucleosynthesis over cosmic history? was significant energy released bynon-stellar processes? is there a diffuse component to the ebl anywhere fromoptical to sub-millimeter? when did first stars appear and how luminous was thereionization epoch? absolute optical to mid-ir ebl spectrum to anastrophysically interesting accuracy can be established by wide field imagingata distance of 5 au or above the ecliptic plane where the zodiacal foreground isreduced by more than two orders of magnitude.

0902.3263	the first galaxies: signatures of the initial starburst	detection of the radiation emitted from the first galaxies at z &gt; 10 will bemade possible in the next decade, with the launch of the james webb spacetelescope (jwst). we carry out cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulationsof population iii (pop iii) starbursts in a 10^8 m_sun dwarf galaxy at z =12.5. for different star formation efficiencies and stellar initial massfunctions (imfs), we calculate the luminosities and equivalent widths (ews) ofthe recombination lines h_alpha, ly_alpha, and he ii 1640, under the simpleassumption that the stellar population does not evolve over the first ~3 myr ofthe starburst. although only &lt; 40 percent of the gas in the central 100 pc ofthe galaxy is photoionized, we find that photoheating by massive stars causes astrong dynamical response, which results in a weak correlation betweenluminosity emitted in hydrogen recombination lines and the total mass in stars.however, owing to the low escape fraction of he ii-ionizing photons, theluminosity emitted in he ii 1640 is much more strongly correlated with thetotal stellar mass. the ratio of the luminosity in he ii 1640 to that inly_alpha or h_alpha is found to be a good indicator of the imf in many cases.the ratio of observable fluxes is f_1640/f_halpha ~ 1 for clusters of 100 m_sunpop iii stars and f_1640/f_halpha ~ 0.1 for clusters of 25 m_sun pop iii stars.the ew of the he ii 1640 emission line is the most reliable imf indicator, itsvalue varying between ~ 20 and ~ 200 angstrom for a massive and very massivepop iii imf, respectively. even the bright, initial stages of pop iiistarbursts in the first dwarf galaxies will likely not be directly detectableby the jwst. instead, the jwst may discover only more massive, and hence morechemically evolved, galaxies which host normal, pop i/ii, star formation.

0902.4602	first light sources at the end of the dark ages: direct observations of  population iii stars, proto-galaxies, and supernovae during the reionization  epoch	the cosmic dark ages are the mysterious epoch during which the pristine gasbegan to condense and ultimately form the first stars. although thesebeginnings have long been a topic of theoretical interest, technology has onlyrecently allowed the beginnings of observational insight into this epoch. manyquestions surround the formation of stars in metal-free gas and the history ofthe build-up of metals in the intergalactic medium: (1) what were theproperties of the first stellar and galactic sources to form in pristine(metal-free) gas? (2) when did the epoch of population iii (metal-free) starformation take place and how long did it last? (3) was the stellar initial massfunction dramatically different for the first stars and galaxies? thesequestions are all active areas of theoretical research. however, newobservational constraints via the direct detection of population iii starformation are vital to making progress in answering the broader questionssurrounding how galaxies formed and how the cosmological properties of theuniverse have affected the objects it contains.

1003.0472	the first galaxies: chemical enrichment, mixing, and star formation	using three-dimensional cosmological simulations, we study the assemblyprocess of one of the first galaxies, with a total mass of 10^8 m_sun,collapsing at z = 10. our main goal is to trace the transport of the heavychemical elements produced and dispersed by a pair-instability supernovaexploding in one of the minihalo progenitors. to this extent, we incorporate anefficient algorithm into our smoothed particle hydrodynamics code whichapproximately models turbulent mixing as a diffusion process. we study thismixing with and without the radiative feedback from population iii stars thatsubsequently form in neighboring minihalos. our simulations allow us toconstrain the initial conditions for second-generation star formation, withinthe first galaxy itself, and inside of minihalos that virialize after thesupernova explosion. we find that most minihalos remain unscathed by ionizingradiation or the supernova remnant, while some are substantially photoheatedand enriched to supercritical levels, likely resulting in the formation oflow-mass population iii or even population ii stars. at the center of the newlyformed galaxy, 10^5 m_sun of cold, dense gas uniformly enriched to 10^-3 z_sunare in a state of collapse, suggesting that a cluster of population ii starswill form. the first galaxies, as may be detected by the james webb spacetelescope, would therefore already contain stellar populations familiar fromlower redshifts.

1004.0267	fragmentation in the first galaxies	we study the gravitational fragmentation of cold accretion streams flowinginto a typical first galaxy. we use a one-zone hydrodynamical model to examinethe thermal evolution of the gas entering a 10^8 m_sun dm halo at z=10. thegoal is to find the expected fragmentation mass scale and thus a characteristicmass of the first population of stars to form by shock fragmentation at highredshift. our model accurately describes the chemical and thermal evolution ofthe gas as we are specifically concerned with how the cooling of the gas altersits fragmentation properties. we find there to be a sharp drop in thefragmentation mass at a metallicity of ~10^-4 z_sun when a strong moleculedestroying, lw background is present. however, if molecules can efficientlyform, they dominate the cooling at t &lt; 10^4 k, demonstrating no 'criticalmetallicity'. dust grains are not included in our chemical model, but we arguetheir inclusion would not significantly the results. we also find that thisphysical scenario allows for the formation of a cluster of solar massfragments, or a single 10^4 m_sun fragment, possibly the precursors to primevalclusters and smbhs. lastly, we conclude that the usual assumption ofisobaricity for galactic shocks breaks down in gas of sufficiently highmetallicity, suggesting that metal cooling may lead to thermal instabilities.

1006.1508	gravitational fragmentation in turbulent primordial gas and the initial  mass function of population iii stars	we report results from numerical simulations of star formation in the earlyuniverse that focus on the dynamical behavior of metal-free gas under differentinitial and environmental conditions. in particular we investigate the role ofturbulence, which is thought to ubiquitously accompany the collapse ofhigh-redshift halos. we distinguish between two main cases: the birth ofpopulation iii.1 stars - those which form in the pristine halos unaffected byprior star formation - and the formation of population iii.2 stars - thoseforming in halos where the gas is still metal free but has an increasedionization fraction. this latter case can arise either from exposure to theintense uv radiation of stellar sources in neighboring halos, or from the highvirial temperatures associated with the formation of massive halos, that is,those with masses greater than 1e8 solar masses. we find that turbulentprimordial gas is highly susceptible to fragmentation in both cases, even forturbulence in the subsonic regime, i.e. for rms velocity dispersions as low as20 % of the sound speed. contrary to our original expectations, fragmentationis more vigorous and more widespread in pristine halos compared to pre-ionizedones. we therefore predict pop iii.1 stars to be on average of somewhat lowermass, and form in larger groups, than pop iii.2 stars. we find that fragmentmasses cover over two orders of magnitude, indicating that the resultingpopulation iii initial mass function was significantly extended in mass aswell. this prompts the need for a large, high-resolution study of the formationof dark matter minihalos that is capable of resolving the turbulent flows inthe gas at the moment when the baryons become self-gravitating. this would helpdetermine which, if any, of the initial conditions presented in our study arerealized in nature.

1010.0997	rotation speed of the first stars	we estimate the rotation speed of population iii (pop iii) stars within aminihalo at z ~ 20 using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulation,beginning from cosmological initial conditions. we follow the evolution of theprimordial gas up to densities of 10^12 cm^-3. representing the growinghydrostatic cores with accreting sink particles, we measure the velocities andangular momenta of all particles that fall onto these protostellar regions.this allows us to record the angular momentum of the sinks and estimate therotational velocity of the pop iii stars expected to form within them. therotation rate has important implications for the evolution of the star, thefate encountered at the end of its life, and the potential for triggering agamma-ray burst (grb). we find that there is sufficient angular momentum toyield rapidly rotating stars (&gt; 1000 km s^-1, or near break-up speeds). thisindicates that pop iii stars likely experienced strong rotational mixing,impacting their structure and nucleosynthetic yields. a subset of them was alsolikely to result in hypernova explosions, and possibly grbs.

1010.1261	chemical signatures of the first galaxies: criteria for one-shot  enrichment	we utilize metal-poor stars in the local, ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (ufds;l_tot &lt; 10^5 l_sun) to empirically constrain the formation process of the firstgalaxies. since ufds have much simpler star formation histories than the haloof the milky way, their stellar populations should preserve the fossil recordof the first supernova (sn) explosions in their long-lived, low-mass stars.guided by recent hydrodynamical simulations of first galaxy formation, wedevelop a set of stellar abundance signatures that characterize thenucleosynthetic history of such an early system if it was observed in thepresent-day universe. specifically, we argue that the first galaxies are theproduct of chemical "one-shot" events, where only one (long-lived) stellargeneration forms after the first, population iii, sn explosions. our abundancecriteria thus constrain the strength of negative feedback effects inside thefirst galaxies. we compare the stellar content of ufds with these one-shotcriteria. several systems (ursa major ii, and also coma berenices, bootes i,leo iv, segue 1) largely fulfill the requirements, indicating that theirhigh-redshift predecessors did experience strong feedback effects that shut offstar formation. we term the study of the entire stellar population of a dwarfgalaxy for the purpose of inferring details about the nature and origin of thefirst galaxies "dwarf galaxy archaeology". this will provide clues to theconnection of the first galaxies, the surviving, metal-poor dwarf galaxies, andthe building blocks of the milky way.

1011.0438	the first galaxies: assembly of disks and prospects for direct detection	the james webb space telescope (jwst) will enable observations of galaxies atredshifts z &gt; 10 and hence allow to test our current understanding of structureformation at very early times. previous work has shown that the very firstgalaxies inside halos with virial temperatures t &lt; 10^4 k and masses m &lt; 10^8m_sun at z &gt; 10 are probably too faint, by at least one order of magnitude, tobe detected even in deep exposures with jwst. the light collected with jwst maytherefore be dominated by radiation from galaxies inside ten times more massivehalos. we use cosmological zoomed smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulationsto investigate the assembly of such galaxies and assess their observabilitywith jwst. we compare two simulations that are identical except for theinclusion of non-equilibrium h/d chemistry and radiative cooling by molecularhydrogen. in both simulations a large fraction of the halo gas settles in twonested, extended gas disks which surround a compact massive gas core. thepresence of molecular hydrogen allows the disk gas to reach low temperaturesand to develop marked spiral structure but does not qualitatively change itsstability against fragmentation. we post-process the simulated galaxies bycombining idealized models for star formation with stellar population synthesismodels to estimate the luminosities in nebular recombination lines as well asin the ultraviolet continuum. we demonstrate that jwst will be able toconstrain the nature of the stellar populations in galaxies such as simulatedhere based on the detection of the he1640 recombination line. extrapolation ofour results to halos with masses both lower and higher than those simulatedshows that jwst may find up to a thousand star-bursting galaxies in future deepexposures of the z &gt; 10 universe.

1101.5491	simulations on a moving mesh: the clustered formation of population iii  protostars	the cosmic dark ages ended a few hundred million years after the big bang,when the first stars began to fill the universe with new light. it hasgenerally been argued that these stars formed in isolation and were extremelymassive - perhaps 100 times as massive as the sun. in a recent study, clark andcollaborators showed that this picture requires revision. they demonstratedthat the accretion disks that build up around population iii stars are stronglysusceptible to fragmentation and that the first stars should therefore form inclusters rather than in isolation. we here use a series of high-resolutionhydrodynamical simulations performed with the moving mesh code arepo to followup on this proposal and to study the influence of environmental parameters onthe level of fragmentation. we model the collapse of five independent minihalosfrom cosmological initial conditions, through the runaway condensation of theircentral gas clouds, to the formation of the first protostar, and beyond for afurther 1000 years. during this latter accretion phase, we represent theoptically thick regions of protostars by sink particles. gas accumulatesrapidly in the circumstellar disk around the first protostar, fragmentingvigorously to produce a small group of protostars. after an initial burst,gravitational instability recurs periodically, forming additional protostarswith masses ranging from ~ 0.1 to 10 m_sun. although the shape, multiplicity,and normalization of the protostellar mass function depend on the details ofthe sink-particle algorithm, fragmentation into protostars with diverse massesoccurs in all cases, confirming earlier reports of population iii stars formingin clusters. depending on the efficiency of later accretion and merging,population iii stars may enter the main sequence in clusters and with much morediverse masses than are commonly assumed.

0709.4025	uncovering the chemical signature of the first stars in the universe	the chemical abundance patterns observed in metal-poor galactic halo starscontain the signature of the first supernovae, and thus allows us to probe thefirst stars that formed in the universe. we construct a theoretical model forthe early chemical enrichment history of the milky way, aiming in particular atthe contribution from pair-instability supernovae (pisne). these are a naturalconsequence of current theoretical models for primordial star formation at thehighest masses. however, no metal-poor star displaying the distinct pisnsignature has yet been observed. we here argue that this apparent absence ofany pisn signature is due to an observational selection effect. whereas mostsurveys traditionally focus on the most metal-poor stars, we predict that earlypisn enrichment tends to `overshoot', reaching enrichment levels of [ca/h] ~=-2.5 that would be missed by current searches. we utilize existingobservational data to place constraints on the primordial initial mass function(imf). the number fraction of pisne in the primordial stellar population isestimated to be &lt;0.07, or ~&lt; 40% by mass, assuming that metal-free stars havemasses in excess of 10 m_sun. we further predict, based on theoreticalestimates for the relative number of pisne, that the expected fraction ofsecond generation stars below [ca/h]=-2 with a dominant (i.e., &gt;90%)contribution from pisne is merely ~1e-4 - 5e-4. the corresponding fraction ofstars formed from gas exclusively enriched by pisne is a factor of ~4 smaller.with the advent of next generation telescopes and new, deeper surveys, weshould be able to test these predictions.

1111.1527	effect of population iii multiplicity on dark star formation	we numerically study the mutual interaction between dark matter (dm) andpopulation iii (pop iii) stellar systems in order to explore the possibility ofpop iii dark stars within this physical scenario. we perform a cosmologicalsimulation, initialized at z ~ 100, which follows the evolution of gas and dm.we analyze the formation of the first minihalo at z ~ 20 and the subsequentcollapse of the gas to densities of 10^12 cm^-3. we then use this simulation toinitialize a set of smaller-scale `cut-out' simulations in which we furtherrefine the dm to have spatial resolution similar to that of the gas. we testmultiple dm density profiles, and we employ the sink particle method torepresent the accreting star-forming region. we find that, for a range of dmconfigurations, the motion of the pop iii star-disk system serves to separatethe positions of the protostars with respect to the dm density peak, such thatthere is insufficient dm to influence the formation and evolution of theprotostars for more than ~ 5000 years. in addition, the star-disk system causesgravitational scattering of the central dm to lower densities, furtherdecreasing the influence of dm over time. any dm-powered phase of pop iii starswill thus be very short-lived for the typical multiple system, and dm will notserve to significantly prolong the life of pop iii stars.

1111.6305	the first galaxies: assembly with black hole feedback	we study how the first galaxies were assembled under feedback from theaccretion onto a central black hole (bh) that is left behind by the firstgeneration of metal-free stars through self-consistent, cosmologicalsimulations. x-ray radiation from the accretion of gas onto bh remnants ofpopulation iii (pop iii) stars, or from high-mass x-ray binaries (hmxbs), againinvolving pop iii stars, influences the mode of second generation starformation. we track the evolution of the black hole accretion rate and theassociated x-ray feedback starting with the death of the pop iii progenitorstar inside a minihalo and following the subsequent evolution of the black holeas the minihalo grows to become an atomically cooling galaxy. we find thatx-ray photoionization heating from a stellar-mass bh is able to quench furtherstar formation in the host halo at all times before the halo enters the atomiccooling phase. x-ray radiation from a hmxb, assuming a luminosity close to theeddington value, exerts an even stronger, and more diverse, feedback on starformation. it photoheats the gas inside the host halo, but also promotes theformation of molecular hydrogen and cooling of gas in the intergalactic mediumand in nearby minihalos, leading to a net increase in the number of starsformed at early times. our simulations further show that the radiative feedbackfrom the first bhs may strongly suppress early bh growth, thus constrainingmodels for the formation of supermassive bhs.

1112.5207	the source density and observability of pair-instability supernovae from  the first stars	theoretical models predict that some of the first stars ended their lives asextremely energetic pair-instability supernovae (pisne). with energiesapproaching 10^53 ergs, these supernovae are expected to be within thedetection limits of the upcoming james webb space telescope (jwst), allowingobservational constraints to be placed on the properties of the first stars. weestimate the source density of pisne using a semi-analytic halo mass functionbased approach, accounting for the effects of feedback from star formation onthe pisn rates using cosmological simulations. we estimate an upper limit of~0.2 pisne per jwst field of view at any given time. feedback can reduce thisrate significantly, e.g., lowering it to as little as one pisn per 4000 jwstfields of view for the most pessimistic explosion models. we also find that themain obstacle to observing pisne from the first stars is their scarcity, nottheir faintness; exposures longer than a few times 10^4s will do little toincrease the number of pisne found. given this we suggest a mosaic style searchstrategy for detecting pisne from the first stars. even rather high redshiftpisne are unlikely to be missed by moderate exposures, and a large number ofpointings will be required to ensure a detection.

1202.5552	formation and evolution of primordial protostellar systems	we investigate the formation of the first stars at the end of the cosmic darkages with a suite of three-dimensional, moving mesh simulations that directlyresolve the collapse of the gas beyond the formation of the first protostar atthe centre of a dark matter minihalo. the simulations cover more than 25 ordersof magnitude in density and have a maximum spatial resolution of 0.05 r_sun,which extends well below the radius of individual protostars and captures theirinteraction with the surrounding gas. in analogy to previous studies thatemployed sink particles, we find that the keplerian disc around the primaryprotostar fragments into a number of secondary protostars, which is facilitatedby h2 collisional dissociation cooling and collision-induced emission. thefurther evolution of the protostellar system is characterized by stronggravitational torques that transfer angular momentum between the secondaryprotostars formed in the disc and the surrounding gas. this leads to themigration of about half of the secondary protostars to the centre of the cloudin a free-fall time, where they merge with the primary protostar and enhanceits growth to about five times the mass of the second most massive protostar.by the same token, a fraction of the protostars obtain angular momentum fromother protostars via n-body interactions and migrate to higher orbits. onaverage, only every third protostar survives until the end of the simulation.however, the number of protostars present at any given time increasesmonotonically, suggesting that the system will continue to grow beyond thelimited period of time simulated here.

1203.2957	confined population iii enrichment and the prospects for prompt  second-generation star formation	it is widely recognized that nucleosynthetic output of the first, populationiii supernovae was a catalyst defining the character of subsequent stellargenerations. most of the work on the earliest enrichment was carried outassuming that the first stars were extremely massive and that the associatedsupernovae were unusually energetic, enough to completely unbind the baryons inthe host cosmic minihalo and disperse the synthesized metals into theintergalactic medium. recent work, however, suggests that the first stars mayin fact have been somewhat less massive, with a characteristic mass scale of afew tens of solar masses. we present a cosmological simulation following thetransport of the metals synthesized in a population iii supernova assuming thatit had an energy of 1e51 ergs, compatible with standard type ii supernovae. ayoung supernova remnant is inserted in the first star's relic hii region in thefree expansion phase and is followed for 40 myr employing adaptive meshrefinement and lagrangian tracer particle techniques. the supernova remnantremains partially trapped within the minihalo and the thin snowplow shelldevelops pronounced instability and fingering. roughly half of the ejecta turnaround and fall back toward the center of the halo, with 1% of the ejectareaching the center in 30 kyr and 10% in 10 myr. the average metallicity of thecombined returning ejecta and the pristine filaments feeding into the halocenter from the cosmic web is 0.001 - 0.01 z_sun, but the two remain unmixeduntil accreting onto the central hydrostatic core that is unresolved at the endof the simulation. we conclude that if population iii stars had less extrememasses, they promptly enriched the host minihalos with metals and triggeredpopulation ii star formation.

1205.3835	star formation in the first galaxies i: collapse delayed by lyman-werner  radiation	we investigate the process of metal-free star formation in the first galaxieswith a high-resolution cosmological simulation. we consider the cosmologicallymotivated scenario in which a strong molecule-destroying lyman-werner (lw)background inhibits effective cooling in low-mass haloes, delaying starformation until the collapse or more massive haloes. only when molecularhydrogen (h2) can self-shield from lw radiation, which requires a halo capableof cooling by atomic line emission, will star formation be possible. to followthe formation of multiple gravitationally bound objects, at high gas densitieswe introduce sink particles which accrete gas directly from the computationalgrid. we find that in a 1 mpc^3 (comoving) box, runaway collapse first occursin a 3x10^7 m_sun dark matter halo at z~12 assuming a background intensity ofj21=100. due to a runaway increase in the h2 abundance and cooling rate, aself-shielding, supersonically turbulent core develops abruptly with ~10^4m_sun in cold gas available for star formation. we analyze the formation ofthis self-shielding core, the character of turbulence, and the prospects forstar formation. due to a lack of fragmentation on scales we resolve, we arguethat lw-delayed metal-free star formation in atomic cooling haloes is verysimilar to star formation in primordial minihaloes, although in making thisconclusion we ignore internal stellar feedback. finally, we briefly discuss thedetectability of metal-free stellar clusters with the james webb spacetelescope.

1207.3879	probing pre-galactic metal enrichment with high-redshift gamma-ray  bursts	we explore high-redshift gamma-ray bursts (grbs) as promising tools to probepre-galactic metal enrichment. we utilize the bright afterglow of a pop iii grbexploding in a primordial dwarf galaxy as a luminous background source, andcalculate the strength of metal absorption lines that are imprinted by thefirst heavy elements in the intergalactic medium (igm). to derive the grbabsorption line diagnostics, we use an existing highly-resolved simulation ofthe formation of a first galaxy which is characterized by the onset of atomichydrogen cooling in a halo with virial temperature &gt;10^4 k. we explore theunusual circumburst environment inside the systems that hosted pop iii stars,modeling the density evolution with the self-similar solution for a champagneflow. for minihalos close to the cooling threshold, the circumburst density isroughly proportional to (1+z) with values of about a few cm^{-3}. in moremassive halos, corresponding to the first galaxies, the density may be larger,n&gt;100 cm^{-3}. the resulting afterglow fluxes may be detectable with the jwstand vla in the near-ir and radio wavebands, respectively, out to redshift z&gt;20.we predict that the maximum of the afterglow emission shifts from near-ir tomillimeter bands with peak fluxes from mjy to jy at different observed times.grbs are ideal tools for probing the metal enrichment in the early igm, due totheir high luminosities and featureless power-law spectra. the metals in thefirst galaxies produced by the first supernova (sn) explosions are likely toreside in low-ionization stages. we show that if the afterglow can be observedsufficiently early, analysis of the metal lines can distinguish whether thefirst heavy elements were produced in a pisn, or a core-collapse (type ii) sn,thus constraining the initial mass function of the first stars.

1208.3698	the first galaxies: assembly under radiative feedback from the first  stars	we investigate how radiative feedback from the first stars affects theassembly of the first dwarf galaxies. we perform cosmological zoomed sphsimulations of a dwarf galaxy assembling inside a halo of virial mass 10^9solar at z = 10. the simulations follow the non-equilibrium chemistry/coolingof primordial gas and the conversion of the gas into metal-free stars. toquantify the radiative feedback, we compare a simulation in which stars emitboth molecular hydrogen dissociating and hydrogen/helium ionizing radiationwith a simulation in which stars emit only dissociating radiation, and with asimulation in which stars remain dark. photodissociation and -ionization exerta strong negative feedback on the assembly of the simulated galaxy. gascondensation is strongly impeded, and star formation is strongly suppressed incomparison with the simulation in which stars remain dark. the feedback on thegas implies a suppression of the central dark matter densities in the minihaloprogenitor by factors of up to a few, which is a significant deviation from thesingular isothermal density profile characterizing the dark matter distributionin the absence of radiative feedback. the evolution of gas densities, starformation rates, and the distribution of dark matter becomes insensitive to theinclusion of dissociating radiation in the late stages of the minihaloassembly, and it becomes insensitive to the inclusion of ionizing radiationonce the minihalo turns into an atomically cooling galaxy. the formation of anextended disk inside the dwarf galaxy is a robust outcome not affected by theinclusion of radiation. we estimate that dwarf galaxies such as simulated herewill be among the faintest galaxies the upcoming james webb space telescopewill detect. our conclusions are subject to our neglect of feedback fromsupernovae and chemical enrichment as well as to cosmic variance.

0711.4622	occurrence of metal-free galaxies in the early universe	the character of the first galaxies at redshifts z &gt; 10 strongly depends ontheir level of pre-enrichment, which is in turn determined by the rate ofprimordial star formation prior to their assembly. in order for the firstgalaxies to remain metal-free, star formation in minihaloes must be highlysuppressed, most likely by h2-dissociating lyman-werner (lw) radiation. we showthat the build-up of such a strong lw background is hindered by two effects.firstly, the level of the lw background is self-regulated, being produced bythe population iii (pop iii) star formation which it, in turn, suppresses.secondly, the high opacity to lw photons which is built up in the relic h iiregions left by the first stars acts to diminish the global lw background.accounting for a self-regulated lw background, we estimate a lower limit forthe rate of pop iii star formation in minihaloes at z &gt; 15. further, wesimulate the formation of a 'first galaxy' with virial temperature t &gt; 10^4 kand total mass &gt; 10^8 m_sun at z &gt; 10, and find that complete suppression ofprevious pop iii star formation is unlikely, with stars of &gt; 100 m_sun (popiii.1) and &gt; 10 m_sun (pop iii.2) likely forming. finally, we discuss theimplications of these results for the nature of the first galaxies, which maybe observed by future missions such as the james webb space telescope.

1211.1889	constraining the statistics of population iii binaries	we perform a cosmological simulation in order to model the growth andevolution of population iii (pop iii) stellar systems in a range of hostminihalo environments. a pop iii multiple system forms in each of the tenminihaloes, and the overall mass function is top-heavy compared to thecurrently observed initial mass function in the milky way. using a sinkparticle to represent each growing protostar, we examine the binarycharacteristics of the multiple systems, resolving orbits on scales as small as20 au. we find a binary fraction of ~36%, with semi-major axes as large as 3000au. the distribution of orbital periods is slightly peaked at &lt; 900 yr, whilethe distribution of mass ratios is relatively flat. of all sink particlesformed within the ten minihaloes, ~50% are lost to mergers with larger sinks,and ~50% of the remaining sinks are ejected from their star-forming disks. thelarge binary fraction may have important implications for pop iii evolution andnucleosynthesis, as well as the final fate of the first stars.

1305.0823	on the operation of the chemothermal instability in primordial  star-forming clouds	we investigate the operation of the chemothermal instability in primordialstar-forming clouds with a suite of three-dimensional, moving-mesh simulations.in line with previous studies, we find that the gas at the centre ofhigh-redshift minihaloes becomes chemothermally unstable as three-bodyreactions convert the atomic hydrogen into a fully molecular gas. thecompetition between the increasing rate at which the gas cools and theincreasing optical depth to h2 line emission creates a characteristic dip inthe cooling time over the free-fall time on a scale of 100 au. as a result, thefree-fall time decreases to below the sound-crossing time, and the cloud maybecome gravitationally unstable and fragment on a scale of a few tens of auduring the initial free-fall phase. in three of the nine haloes investigated,secondary clumps condense out of the parent cloud, which will likely collapsein their own right before they are accreted by the primary clump. in the otherhaloes, fragmentation at such an early stage is less likely. however, giventhat previous simulations have shown that the infall velocity decreasessubstantially once the gas becomes rotationally supported, the amount of timeavailable for perturbations to develop may be much greater than is evident fromthe limited period of time simulated here.

1305.5178	formation of the first stars	understanding the formation of the first stars is one of the frontier topicsin modern astrophysics and cosmology. their emergence signaled the end of thecosmic dark ages, a few hundred million years after the big bang, leading to afundamental transformation of the early universe through the production ofionizing photons and the initial enrichment with heavy chemical elements. wehere review the state of our knowledge, separating the well understood elementsof our emerging picture from those where more work is required. primordial starformation is unique in that its initial conditions can be directly inferredfrom the lambda cold dark matter (lcdm) model of cosmological structureformation. combined with gas cooling that is mediated via molecular hydrogen,one can robustly identify the regions of primordial star formation, theso-called minihalos, having total masses of ~10^6 m_sun and collapsing atredshifts z~20-30. within this framework, a number of studies have defined apreliminary standard model, with the main result that the first stars werepredominantly massive. this model has recently been modified to include aubiquitous mode of fragmentation in the protostellar disks, such that thetypical outcome of primordial star formation may be the formation of a binaryor small multiple stellar system. we will also discuss extensions to thisstandard picture due to the presence of dynamically significant magneticfields, of heating from self-annihalating wimp dark matter, or cosmic rays. weconclude by discussing possible strategies to empirically test our theoreticalmodels.

1306.4703	dwarf spheroidal satellite formation in a reionized local group	dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies have emerged a powerful probe ofsmall-scale dark matter clustering and of cosmic reionization. they exhibitstructural and chemical continuity with dwarf irregular galaxies in the fieldand with spheroidal galaxies in high-density environments. by combiningempirical constraints derived for star formation at low gas column densitiesand metallicities in the local universe with a model for dark matter andbaryonic mass assembly, we provide an analytical description of how the dwarfspheroidals acquired their stellar content. their progenitors formed starsuntil the gas content, initially reduced from the cosmic average by the thermalpressure of the reionized intergalactic medium, was finally ram pressurestripped during the progenitors' accretion on to the host galaxy. dwarfspheroidal satellites of differing luminosities seem to share very similar mostmassive progenitor histories that reach thresholds for gas cooling by atomicline emission at epochs at which the lagrangian volume of the local groupshould have been reionized. we hypothesize that dwarf spheroidals formed thebulk of their stars in partially rotationally supported hi disks in a reionizeduniverse. this model provides an explanation for the "common mass scale"relation and reproduces the empirical luminosity-size andluminosity-metallicity relations. explosive feedback phenomena, such asoutflows driven by the concerted action of supernovae, need not have beensignificant in the dwarf spheroidals' formation. we further speculate that thetrue pre-reionization fossils should exhibit a structure distinct from that ofthe dwarf spheroidals, e.g., in the form of dense isolated or nuclear starclusters.

1307.1798	the first stars: a low-mass formation mode	we perform numerical simulations of the growth of a population iii stellarsystem under photodissociating feedback. we start from cosmological initialconditions at z = 100, self-consistently following the formation of a minihaloat z = 15 and the subsequent collapse of its central gas to high densities. thesimulations resolve scales as small as ~ 1 au, corresponding to gas densitiesof 10^16 cm^-3. using sink particles to represent the growing protostars, weevolve the stellar system for the next 5000 years. we find that this emergingstellar group accretes at an unusually low rate compared with minihalos whichform at earlier times (z = 20 - 30), or with lower baryonic angular momentum.the stars in this unusual system will likely reach masses ranging from &lt; 1m_sun to 5 m_sun by the end of their main-sequence lifetimes, placing them inthe mass range for which stars will undergo an asymptotic giant branch (agb)phase. based upon the simulation, we predict the rare existence of populationiii stars that have survived to the present day and have been enriched by massoverflow from a previous agb companion.

1307.1982	star formation in the first galaxies - ii: clustered star formation and  the influence of metal line cooling	population iii stars are believed to have been more massive than typicalstars today and to have formed in relative isolation. the thermodynamic impactof metals is expected to induce a transition leading to clustered, low-masspopulation ii star formation. in this work, we present results from threecosmological simulations, only differing in gas metallicity, that focus on theimpact of metal fine-structure line cooling on the formation of stellarclusters in a high-redshift atomic cooling halo. introduction of sink particlesallows us to follow the process of gas hydrodynamics and accretion onto clusterstars for 4 myr corresponding to multiple local free-fall times. atmetallicities at least $10^{-3}\, z_{\odot}$, gas is able to reach the cmbtemperature floor and fragment pervasively resulting in a stellar cluster ofsize $\sim1$ pc and total mass $\sim1000\, m_{\odot}$. the masses of individualsink particles vary, but are typically $\sim100\, m_{\odot}$, consistent withthe jeans mass when gas cools to the cmb temperature, though some solar massfragments are also produced. at the low metallicity of $10^{-4}\, z_{\odot}$,fragmentation is completely suppressed on scales greater than 0.01 pc and totalstellar mass is lower by a factor of 3 than in the higher metallicitysimulations. the sink particle accretion rates, and thus their masses, aredetermined by the mass of the gravitationally unstable gas cloud and theprolonged gas accretion over many myr. the simulations thus exhibit features ofboth monolithic collapse and competitive accretion. even considering possibledust induced fragmentation that would occur at higher densities, the formationof a bona fide stellar cluster seems to require metal line cooling andmetallicities of at least $10^{-3}\, z_{\odot}$.

1307.2239	the chemical imprint of silicate dust on the most metal-poor stars	we investigate the impact of dust-induced gas fragmentation on the formationof the first low-mass, metal-poor stars (&lt; 1msun) in the early universe.previous work has shown the existence of a critical dust-to-gas ratio, belowwhich dust thermal cooling cannot cause gas fragmentation. assuming the firstdust is silicon-based, we compute critical dust-to-gas ratios and associatedcritical silicon abundances ([si/h]crit). at the density and temperatureassociated with protostellar disks, we find that a standard milky way grainsize distribution gives [si/h]crit = -4.5 +/- 0.1, while smaller grain sizescreated in a supernova reverse shock give [si/h]crit = -5.3 +/- 0.1. otherenvironments are not dense enough to be influenced by dust cooling. we test thesilicate dust cooling theory by comparing to silicon abundances observed in themost iron-poor stars ([fe/h] &lt; -4.0). several stars have silicon abundances lowenough to rule out dust-induced gas fragmentation with a standard grain sizedistribution. moreover, two of these stars have such low silicon abundancesthat even dust with a shocked grain size distribution cannot explain theirformation. adding small amounts of carbon dust does not significantly changethese conclusions. additionally, we find that these stars exhibit either highcarbon with low silicon abundances or the reverse. a silicate dust scenariothus suggests that the earliest low-mass star formation in the most metal-poorregime may have proceeded through two distinct cooling pathways: fine structureline cooling and dust cooling. this naturally explains both the carbon-rich andcarbon-normal stars at extremely low [fe/h].

1310.7944	radiative feedback from high mass x-ray binaries on the formation of the  first galaxies and early reionization	recent work suggests that the first generation of stars, the so-calledpopulation iii (pop iii), could have formed primarily in binaries or as membersof small multiple systems. here we investigate the impact of x-ray feedbackfrom high-mass x-ray binaries (hmxbs) left behind in stellar binary systemsafter the primary forms a black hole (bh), accreting gas at a high rate fromthe companion, a process that is thought to be favored at the low metallicitiescharacteristic of high-redshift gas. thanks to their large mean free path,x-rays are capable of preionizing and preheating the gas in the intergalacticmedium (igm) and in haloes long before the reionization of the universe iscomplete, and thus could have strongly affected the formation of subsequentgenerations of stars as well as reionization. we have carried out zoomedhydrodynamical cosmological simulations of minihaloes, accounting for theformation of pop iii stars and their collapse into bhs and hmxbs, and theassociated radiation-hydrodynamic feedback from uv and x-ray photons. we findno strong net feedback from hmxbs on the simulated star formation history. onthe other hand, the preheating of the igm by hmxbs leads to a strongsuppression of small-scale structures and significantly lowers therecombination rate in the igm, thus yielding a net positive feedback onreionization. we further show that x-ray feedback from hmxbs can augment theionizing feedback from the pop iii progenitor stars to suppress gas accretiononto the first bhs, limiting their growth into supermassive bhs. finally, weshow that x-ray ionization by hmxbs leaves distinct signatures in theproperties of the high-redshift hydrogen that may be probed in upcomingobservations of the redshifted 21cm spin-flip line.

1312.3117	the mutual interaction between population iii stars and  self-annihilating dark matter	we use cosmological simulations of high-redshift minihalos to investigate theeffect of dark matter annihilation (dma) on the collapse of primordial gas. wenumerically investigate the evolution of the gas as it assembles in apopulation iii stellar disk. we find that when dma effects are neglected, thedisk undergoes multiple fragmentation events beginning at ~ 500 yr after theappearance of the first protostar. on the other hand, dma heating andionization of the gas speeds the initial collapse of gas to protostellardensities and also affects the stability of the developing disk againstfragmentation, depending on the dm distribution. we compare the evolution whenwe model the dm density with an analytical dm profile which remains centrallypeaked, and when we simulate the dm profile using n-body particles (the 'live'dm halo). when utilizing the analytical dm profile, dma suppresses diskfragmentation for ~ 3500 yr after the first protostar forms, in agreement withearlier work. however, when using a 'live' dm halo, the central dm density peakis gradually flattened due to the mutual interaction between the dm and therotating gaseous disk, reducing the effects of dma on the gas, and enablingsecondary protostars of mass ~ 1 m_sol to be formed within ~ 900 yr. thesesimulations demonstrate that dma is ineffective in suppressing gas collapse andsubsequent fragmentation, rendering the formation of long-lived dark starsunlikely. however, dma effects may still be significant in the early collapseand disk formation phase of primordial gas evolution.

1401.0540	formation of the first low-mass stars from cosmological initial  conditions	we simulate the formation of a metal-poor (10^-2 zsun) stellar cluster in oneof the first galaxies to form in the early universe, specifically ahigh-redshift atomic cooling halo (z~14). this is the first calculation thatresolves the formation of individual metal-enriched stars in simulationsstarting from realistic cosmological initial conditions. we follow theevolution of a single dense clump among several in the parent halo. the clumpforms a cluster of ~40 stars and sub-stellar objects within 7000 years andcould continue forming stars ~5 times longer. protostellar dust heating has anegligible effect on the star formation efficiency, at least during the earlyevolutionary stages, but it moderately suppresses gaseous fragmentation andbrown dwarf formation. we observe fragmentation in thin gaseous filaments andsustained accretion in larger, rotating structures as well as ejections bybinary interactions. the stellar initial mass function above 0.1 msun,evaluated after ~10^4 years of fragmentation and accretion, seems in agreementwith the recent measurement in ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galactic satellitesof geha et al.

1407.0034	recovery from population iii supernova explosions and the onset of  second generation star formation	we use cosmological simulations to assess how the explosion of the firststars in supernovae (sne) influences early cosmic history. specifically, weinvestigate the impact by sne on the host systems for population~iii (pop~iii)star formation and explore its dependence on halo environment and pop~iiiprogenitor mass. we then trace the evolution of the enriched gas untilconditions are met to trigger second-generation star formation. to this extent,we quantify the recovery timescale, which measures the time delay between apop~iii sn explosion and the appearance of cold, dense gas, out of whichsecond-generation stars can form. we find that this timescale is highlysensitive to the pop~iii progenitor mass, and less so to the halo environment.for more massive progenitors, including those exploding in pair instabilitysne, second-generation star formation is delayed significantly, for up to ahubble time. the dependence of the recovery time on the mass of the snprogenitor is mainly due to the ionizing impact of the progenitor star.photoionization heating increases the gas pressure and initiates ahydrodynamical response that reduces the central gas density, an effect that isstronger in more massive. the gas around lower mass pop~iii stars remainsdenser and hence the sn remnants cool more rapidly, facilitating the subsequentre-condensation of the gas and formation of a second generation of stars. inmost cases, the second-generation stars are already metal-enriched to ~2-5 x10^{-4}\zsun, thus belonging to population~ii. the recovery timescale is a keyquantity governing the nature of the first galaxies, able to host low-mass,long-lived stellar systems. these in turn are the target of future deep-fieldcampaigns with the james webb space telescope.

1407.1847	the first stars: formation under x-ray feedback	we investigate the impact of a cosmic x-ray background (cxb) on populationiii stars forming in a minihalo at $z\simeq25$. using the smoothed particlehydrodynamics code gadget-2, we attain sufficient numerical resolution tofollow gas collapsing into the centre of the minihalo from cosmological initialconditions up to densities of $10^{12}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$, at which point we formsink particles. this allows us to study how the presence of a cxb affects theformation of h$_2$ and hd in the gas prior to becoming fully molecular. using asuite of simulations for a range of possible cxb models, we follow eachsimulation for 5000\yr after the first sink particle forms. the cxb providestwo competing effects, with x-rays both heating the gas and increasing the freeelectron fraction, allowing more h$_2$ to form. x-ray heating dominates below$n\sim1\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$, while the additional h$_2$ cooling becomes moreimportant above $n\sim10^2\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. the gas becomes optically thick tox-rays as it exits the quasi-hydrostatic `loitering phase,' such that theprimary impact of the cxb is to cool the gas at intermediate densities,resulting in an earlier onset of baryonic collapse into the dark matter halo.at the highest densities, self-shielding results in similar thermodynamicbehaviour across a wide range of cxb strengths. consequently, we find that starformation is relatively insensitive to the presence of a cxb; both the numberand the characteristic mass of the stars formed remains quite similar even asthe strength of the cxb varies by several orders of magnitude.

0803.2237	the first galaxies: assembly, cooling and the onset of turbulence	we investigate the properties of the first galaxies at z &gt; 10 with highlyresolved numerical simulations, starting from cosmological initial conditionsand taking into account all relevant primordial chemistry and cooling. a firstgalaxy is characterized by the onset of atomic hydrogen cooling, once thevirial temperature exceeds 10^4 k, and its ability to retain photoheated gas.we follow the complex accretion and star formation history of a 5*10^7 m_sunsystem by means of a detailed merger tree and derive an upper limit on thenumber of population iii (pop iii) stars formed prior to its assembly. weinvestigate the thermal and chemical evolution of infalling gas and find thatpartial ionization at temperatures &gt; 10^4 k catalyses the formation of h2 andhydrogen deuteride, allowing the gas to cool to the temperature of the cosmicmicrowave background. depending on the strength of radiative and chemicalfeedback, primordial star formation might be dominated by intermediate-mass popiii stars formed during the assembly of the first galaxies. accretion on to thenascent galaxy begins with hot accretion, where gas is accreted directly fromthe intergalactic medium and shock-heated to the virial temperature, but isquickly accompanied by a phase of cold accretion, where the gas cools infilaments before flowing into the parent halo with high velocities. the latterdrives supersonic turbulence at the centre of the galaxy and could lead to veryefficient chemical mixing. the onset of turbulence in the first galaxies thuslikely marks the transition to pop ii star formation.

1407.7545	cosmological impact of population iii binaries	we present the results of the stellar feedback from pop iii binaries byemploying improved, more realistic pop iii evolutionary stellar models. tofacilitate a meaningful comparison, we consider a fixed mass of 60 solar masses(msun) incorporated in pop iii stars, either contained in a single star, orsplit up in binary stars of 30 msun each or an asymmetric case of one 45 msunand one 15 msun star. whereas the sizes of the resulting hii regions arecomparable across all cases, the heiii regions around binary stars aresignificantly smaller than that of the single star. consequently, the he$^{+}$1640 angstrom recombination line is expected to become much weaker. supernovafeedback exhibits great variety due to the uncertainty in possible explosionpathways. if at least one of the component stars dies as a hypernova about tentimes more energetic than conventional core-collapse supernovae, the gas insidethe host minihalo is effectively blown out, chemically enriching theintergalactic medium (igm) to an average metallicity of $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ solarmetallicity (zsun), out to $\sim 2$ kpc. the single star, however, is morelikely to collapse into a black hole, accompanied by at most very weakexplosions. the effectiveness of early chemical enrichment would thus besignificantly reduced, in difference from the lower mass binary stars, where atleast one component is likely to contribute to heavy element production anddispersal. important new feedback physics is also introduced if close binariescan form high-mass x-ray binaries, leading to the pre-heating and -ionizationof the igm beyond the extent of the stellar hii regions.

1408.0319	metal transport and chemical heterogeneity in early star forming systems	to constrain the properties of the first stars with the chemical abundancepatterns observed in metal-poor stars, one must identify any non-trivialeffects that the hydrodynamics of metal dispersal can imprint on theabundances. we use realistic cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to quantifythe distribution of metals resulting from one population iii supernova and froma small number of such supernovae exploding in close succession. overall,supernova ejecta are highly inhomogeneously dispersed throughout thesimulations. when the supernova bubbles collapse, quasi-virializedmetal-enriched clouds, fed by fallback from the bubbles and by streaming ofmetal-free gas from the cosmic web, grow in the centers of the dark matterhalos. partial turbulent homogenization on scales resolved in the simulation isobserved only in the densest clouds where the vortical time scales are shortenough to ensure true homogenization on subgrid scales. however, the abundancesin the clouds differ from the gross yields of the supernovae. continuing thesimulations until the cloud have gone into gravitational collapse, we predictthat the abundances in second-generation stars will be deficient in theinnermost mass shells of the supernova (if only one has exploded) or in theejecta of the latest supernovae (when multiple have exploded). this indicatesthat hydrodynamics gives rise to biases complicating the identification ofnucleosynthetic sources in the chemical abundance spaces of the survivingstars.

1411.1238	constraining the primordial initial mass function with stellar  archaeology	we present a new near-field cosmological probe of the initial mass function(imf) of the first stars. specifically, we constrain the lower-mass limit ofthe population iii (pop iii) imf with the total number of stars in large,unbiased surveys of the milky way. we model the early star formation history ina milky way-like halo with a semi-analytic approach, based on monte-carlosampling of dark matter merger trees, combined with a treatment of the mostimportant feedback mechanisms. assuming a logarithmically flat pop iii imf andvarying its low mass limit, we derive the number of expected survivors of thesefirst stars, using them to estimate the probability to detect any such pop iiifossil in stellar archaeological surveys. following our analysis, the mostpromising region to find possible pop iii survivors is the stellar halo of themilky way, which is the best target for future surveys. we find that if nogenuine pop iii survivor is detected in a sample size of $4 \times 10^6$ ($2\times 10^7$) halo stars with well-controlled selection effects, then we canexclude the hypothesis that the primordial imf extended down below $0.8m_\odot$ at a confidence level of 68% (99%). with the sample size of thehamburg/eso survey, we can tentatively exclude pop iii stars with masses below$0.65 m_\odot$ with a confidence level of 95%, although this is subject tosignificant uncertainties. to fully harness the potential of our approach,future large surveys are needed that employ uniform, unbiased selectionstrategies for high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up.

1501.03212	star formation in the first galaxies - iii. formation, evolution, and  characteristics of the first stellar cluster	we simulate the formation of a low metallicity (0.01 zsun) stellar cluster ina dwarf galaxy at redshift z~14. beginning with cosmological initialconditions, the simulation utilizes adaptive mesh refinement and sink particlesto follow the collapse and evolution of gas past the opacity limit forfragmentation, thus resolving the formation of individual protostellar cores. atime- and location-dependent protostellar radiation field, which heats the gasby absorption on dust, is computed by integration of protostellar evolutionarytracks with the mesa code. the simulation also includes a robustnon-equilibrium chemical network that self-consistently treats gasthermodynamics and dust-gas coupling. the system is evolved for 18 kyr afterthe first protostellar source has formed. in this time span, 30 sink particlesrepresenting protostellar cores form with a total mass of 81 msun. their massesrange from ~0.1 msun to 14.4 msun with a median mass ~0.5-1 msun. massiveprotostars grow by competitive accretion while lower-mass protostars arestunted in growth by close encounters and many-body ejections. in the regimeexplored here, the characteristic mass scale is determined by the temperaturefloor set by the cosmic microwave background and by the onset of efficientdust-gas coupling. it seems unlikely that host galaxies of the first bursts ofmetal-enriched star formation will be detectable with the james webb spacetelescope or other next-generation infrared observatories. instead, the mostpromising access route to the dawn of cosmic star formation may lie in thescrutiny of metal-poor, ancient stellar populations in the galacticneighborhood. the observable targets that correspond to the system simulatedhere are ultra-faint dwarf satellite galaxies such as bootes ii, segue i andii, and willman i.

1505.07226	on the physical requirements for a pre-reionization origin of the  unresolved near-infrared background	the study of the cosmic near-infrared background (cib) light aftersubtraction of resolved sources can push the limits of current observations andinfer the level of galaxy and black hole activity in the early universe.however, disentangling the relative contribution from low- and high-redshiftsources is not trivial. spatial fluctuations of the cib exhibit a clusteringexcess at angular scales $\sim 1^\circ$ whose origin has not been conclusivelyidentified. we explore the likelihood that this signal is dominated by emissionfrom galaxies and accreting black holes in the early universe. we find that, ifthe first small mass galaxies have a normal imf, the light of their ageingstars (fossils) integrated over cosmic time contributes a comparable amount tothe cib as their pre-reionization progenitors. however, the measuredfluctuation signal is too large to be produced by galaxies at redshifts $z&gt;8$unless their star formation efficiencies are much larger than those inferredfrom the observed lyman-dropout population. in order to produce the observedlevel of cib fluctuation without violating constraints from galaxy counts andthe electron optical depth of the igm, minihalos at $z&gt;12$ must form stars withefficiency $f_\star \gtrsim 0.1$ and, although a top-heavy imf is preferred,have a very low escape fraction of ionizing radiation, $f_{\rm esc}&lt;0.01$. ifinstead the cib fluctuations are produced by high-$z$ black holes, one requiresvigorous accretion in the early universe reaching $\rho_{\rm acc} \gtrsim10^5m_\odot{\rm mpc^{-3}}$ by $z\simeq 10$. this growth must stop by $z \sim 6$and be significantly obscured not to overproduce the soft cosmic x-raybackground (cxb) and its observed coherence with the cib. we therefore find therange of suitable possibilities at high-$z$ to be narrow, but could possibly bewidened by including additional physics and evolution at those epochs.

0705.3048	the first supernova explosions: energetics, feedback, and chemical  enrichment	we perform three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations in arealistic cosmological setting to investigate the expansion, feedback, andchemical enrichment properties of a 200 m_sun pair-instability supernova in thehigh-redshift universe. we find that the sn remnant propagates for a hubbletime at z = 20 to a final mass-weighted mean shock radius of 2.5 kpc (proper),roughly half the size of the hii region, and in this process sweeps up a totalgas mass of 2.5*10^5 m_sun. the morphology of the shock becomes highlyanisotropic once it leaves the host halo and encounters filaments andneighboring minihalos, while the bulk of the shock propagates into the voids ofthe intergalactic medium. the sn entirely disrupts the host halo and terminatesfurther star formation for at least 200 myr, while in our specific case itexerts positive mechanical feedback on neighboring minihalos byshock-compressing their cores. in contrast, we do not observe secondary starformation in the dense shell via gravitational fragmentation, due to theprevious photoheating by the progenitor star. we find that cooling by metallines is unimportant for the entire evolution of the sn remnant, while themetal-enriched, interior bubble expands adiabatically into the cavities createdby the shock, and ultimately into the voids with a maximum extent similar tothe final mass-weighted mean shock radius. finally, we conclude that darkmatter halos of at least m_vir &gt; 10^8 m_sun must be assembled to recollect allcomponents of the swept-up gas.

0705.3634	impact of cosmic rays on population iii star formation	we explore the implications of a possible cosmic ray (cr) backgroundgenerated during the first supernova explosions that end the brief lives ofmassive population iii stars. we show that such a cr background could havesignificantly influenced the cooling and collapse of primordial gas clouds inminihaloes around redshifts of z ~ 15 - 20, provided the cr flux was sufficientto yield an ionization rate greater than about 10^-19 s^-1 near the center ofthe minihalo. the presence of crs with energies less than approximately 10^7 evwould indirectly enhance the molecular cooling in these regions, and weestimate that the resulting lower temperatures in these minihaloes would yielda characteristic stellar mass as low as ~ 10 m_sun. crs have a less pronouncedeffect on the cooling and collapse of primordial gas clouds inside more massivedark matter haloes with virial masses greater than approximately 10^8 m_sun atthe later stages of cosmological structure formation around z ~ 10 - 15. inthese clouds, even without cr flux the molecular abundance is alreadysufficient to allow cooling to the floor set by the temperature of the cosmicmicrowave background.

astro-ph;0007248	generic spectrum and ionization efficiency of a heavy initial mass  function for the first stars	we calculate the generic spectral signature of an early population of massivestars at high redshifts. for metal-free stars in the mass range of 100-1000solar masses, we find that the combined spectral luminosity per unit stellarmass is almost independent of the mass distribution of these stars. to zerothorder, the generic spectrum resembles a black-body with an effectivetemperature of ~10^5 k, making these stars highly efficient at ionizinghydrogen and helium. the production rate of ionizing radiation per stellar massby stars more massive than 100 solar masses is larger by about an order ofmagnitude for hydrogen and he i, and by about two orders of magnitude for heii, than the emission from a standard initial mass function. this would resultin unusually strong hydrogen and helium recombination lines from thesurrounding interstellar medium. it could also alleviate the current difficultyof ionizing the intergalactic medium at z&gt;6 with the cosmic star formation rateinferred at somewhat lower redshifts.

astro-ph;0102503	the formation of the first stars. i. the primordial star forming cloud	to constrain the nature of the very first stars, we investigate the collapseand fragmentation of primordial, metal-free gas clouds. we explore the physicsof primordial star formation by means of three-dimensional simulations of thedark matter and gas components, using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, under awide range of initial conditions, including the initial spin, the total mass ofthe halo, the redshift of virialization, the power spectrum of the dmfluctuations, the presence of hd cooling, and the number of particles employedin the simulation. we find characteristic values for the temperature, t ~ a few100 k, and the density, n ~ 10^3-10^4 cm^-3, characterising the gas at the endof the initial free-fall phase. these values are rather insensitive to theinitial conditions. the corresponding jeans mass is m_j ~ 10^3 m_sun. theexistence of these characteristic values has a robust explanation in themicrophysics of h2 cooling, connected to the minimum temperature that can bereached with the h2 coolant, and to the critical density at which thetransition takes place betweeb levels being populated according to nlte, andaccording to lte.  in all cases, the gas dissipatively settles into an irregular, centralconfiguration which has a filamentary and knotty appearance. the fluid regionswith the highest densities are the first to undergo runaway collapse due togravitational instability, and to form clumps with initial masses ~ 10^3 m_sun,close to the characteristic jeans scale. these results suggest that the firststars might have been quite massive, possibly even very massive with m_star &gt;100 m_sun.

astro-ph;0206365	the formation mechanism of brown dwarfs	we present results from the first hydrodynamical star formation calculationto demonstrate that brown dwarfs are a natural and frequent product of thecollapse and fragmentation of a turbulent molecular cloud. the brown dwarfsform via the fragmentation of dense molecular gas in unstable multiple systemsand are ejected from the dense gas before they have been able to accrete tostellar masses. thus, they can be viewed as `failed stars'. approximately threequarters of the brown dwarfs form in gravitationally-unstable circumstellardiscs while the remainder form in collapsing filaments of molecular gas. theseformation mechanisms are very efficient, producing roughly the same number ofbrown dwarfs as stars, in agreement with recent observations. however, becauseclose dynamical interactions are involved in their formation, we find a verylow frequency of binary brown dwarf systems ($\lsim 5$%) and that those binarybrown dwarf systems that do exist must be close $\lsim 10$ au. similarly, wefind that young brown dwarfs with large circumstellar discs (radii $\gsim 10$au) are rare ($\approx 5$%).

astro-ph;0208447	three epochs of star formation in the high redshift universe	we investigate the impact of an early population of massive stars on theirsurroundings. dissociation of molecular hydrogen by strong uv emission fromsuch stars is expected to produce a global transition in the cooling mechanismof minihalos at a redshift of approximately 30, strongly inhibiting starformation until more massive halos can collapse. furthermore, chemicalenrichment from pop iii supernovae produces a second transition at z ~ 15-20,when the mean metallicity of the universe exceeds a critical threshold and popiii star formation gives way to pop ii. we show that observations of highredshift supernovae with the next generation space telescope (ngst) have thepotential to trace the cosmic star formation rate out to z &gt;~ 20, provided thatpop iii supernovae are at least as bright as, and ideally brighter than, typeia supernovae. we also propose a mechanism for the formation of a novelpopulation of extremely low metallicity stars of intermediate mass at very highredshifts, which we term pop ii.5. in our model shock compression, heating, andsubsequent cooling to high density reduces the fragment mass in primordial gasto ~10 m_sun, allowing low mass stars to form. we predict the number density ofrelic pop ii.5 stars in the milky way halo today and find that, with certainassumptions, there should be ~ 10 kpc^{-3} in the solar neighborhood.

astro-ph;0212380	the formation of a star cluster: predicting the properties of stars and  brown dwarfs	we present results from the largest numerical simulation of star formation toresolve the fragmentation process down to the opacity limit. the simulationfollows the collapse and fragmentation of a large-scale turbulent molecularcloud to form a stellar cluster and, simultaneously, the formation ofcircumstellar discs and binary stars. this large range of scales enables us topredict a wide variety of stellar properties for comparison with observations.the calculation clearly demonstrates that star formation is a highly-dynamicand chaotic process. star-disc encounters form binaries and truncate discs.stellar encounters disrupt bound multiple systems. the cloud produces roughlyequal numbers of stars and brown dwarfs, with masses down to the opacity limitfor fragmentation (~5 jupiter masses). the initial mass function is consistentwith a salpeter slope (gamma=-1.35) above 0.5 msun, a roughly flat distribution(gamma=0) in the range 0.006-0.5 msun, and a sharp cutoff below ~0.005 msun.this is consistent with recent observational surveys. the brown dwarfs form bythe dynamical ejection of low-mass fragments from dynamically unstable multiplesystems before the fragments have been able to accrete to stellar masses. closebinary systems (with separations &lt;10 au) are not formed by fragmentation insitu. rather, they are produced by hardening of initially wider multiplesystems through a combination of dynamical encounters, gas accretion, and/orthe interaction with circumbinary and circumtriple discs. finally, we find thatthe majority of circumstellar discs have radii less than 20 au due totruncation in dynamical encounters. this is consistent with observations of theorion trapezium cluster and implies that most stars and brown dwarfs do notform large planetary systems.

astro-ph;0212403	the formation of close binary systems by dynamical interactions and  orbital decay	we present results from the first hydrodynamical star formation calculationto demonstrate that close binary stellar systems (separations $\lsim 10$ au)need not be formed directly by fragmentation. instead, a high frequency ofclose binaries can be produced through a combination of dynamical interactionsin unstable multiple systems and the orbital decay of initially wider binaries.orbital decay may occur due to gas accretion and/or the interaction of a binarywith its circumbinary disc. these three mechanisms avoid the problemsassociated with the fragmentation of optically-thick gas to form close systemsdirectly. they also result in a preference for close binaries to have roughlyequal-mass components because dynamical exchange interactions and the accretionof gas with high specific angular momentum drive mass ratios towards unity.furthermore, due to the importance of dynamical interactions, we find thatstars with greater masses ought to have a higher frequency of close companions,and that many close binaries ought to have wide companions. these propertiesare in good agreement with the results of observational surveys.

astro-ph;0310443	the era of massive population iii stars: cosmological implications and  self-termination	the birth and death of the first generation of stars have importantimplications for the thermal state and chemical properties of the intergalacticmedium (igm) in the early universe. sometime after recombination, the neutral,chemically pristine gas was reionized by ultraviolet photons emitted from thefirst stars, but also enriched with heavy elements when these stars ended theirlives as energetic supernovae. using the results from previous high-resolutioncosmological simulations of early structure formation that include radiativetransfer, we show that a significant volume fraction of the igm can bemetal-polluted, as well as ionized, by massive population iii stars formed insmall-mass (10^6-10^7 msun) halos early on. if most of the early generationstars die as pair-instability supernovae with energies up to 10^{53} ergs, thevolume-averaged mean metallicity will quickly reach z ~ 10^{-4}zsun by aredshift of 15-20, possibly causing a prompt transition to the formation of astellar population that is dominated by low-mass stars. in this scenario, theearly chemical enrichment history should closely trace the reionization historyof the igm, and the end of the population iii era is marked by the completionof reionization and pre-enrichment by z=15. we conclude that, while thepre-enrichment may partially account for the ``metallicity-floor'' inhigh-redshift lyman-alpha clouds, it does not significantly affect theelemental abundance in the intracluster medium.

astro-ph;0310622	the formation of the first low-mass stars from gas with low carbon and  oxygen abundances	the first stars in the universe are predicted to have been much more massivethan the sun. gravitational condensation accompanied by cooling of theprimordial gas due to molecular hydrogen, yields a minimum fragmentation scaleof a few hundred solar masses. numerical simulations indicate that once a gasclump acquires this mass, it undergoes a slow, quasi-hydrostatic contractionwithout further fragmentation. here we show that as soon as the primordial gas- left over from the big bang - is enriched by supernovae to a carbon or oxygenabundance as small as ~0.01-0.1% of that found in the sun, cooling bysingly-ionized carbon or neutral oxygen can lead to the formation of low-massstars. this mechanism naturally accommodates the discovery of solar mass starswith unusually low (10^{-5.3} of the solar value) iron abundance but with ahigh (10^{-1.3} solar) carbon abundance. the minimum stellar mass at earlyepochs is partially regulated by the temperature of the cosmic microwavebackground. the derived critical abundances can be used to identify thosemetal-poor stars in our milky way galaxy with elemental patterns imprinted bythe first supernovae.

astro-ph;0312456	accretion onto a primordial protostar	we present a three-dimensional numerical simulation that resolves theformation process of a population iii star down to a scale of ~100 au. thesimulation is initialized on the scale of a dark matter halo of mass ~10^6m_sun that virializes at z~20. it then follows the formation of afully-molecular central core, and traces the accretion from the diffusedust-free cloud onto the protostellar core for as long as ~10^4 yr, at whichtime the core has grown to ~50 m_sun. we find that the accretion rate startsvery high, ~0.1 m_sun yr^-1, and declines rapidly thereafter approaching apower-law temporal scaling. asymptotically, at times t &gt; 10^3 yr after coreformation, the stellar mass grows approximately as m_star=20 m_sun (t/10^3yr)^0.4. earlier on, accretion is faster with m_star \propto t^0.75. byextrapolating this growth over the full lifetime of very massive stars,t~3x10^6 yr, we obtain the conservative upper limit m_star &lt; 500 m_sun. theactual stellar mass is, however, likely to be significantly smaller than thismass limit due to radiative and mechanical feedback from the protostar.

astro-ph;0505304	the cooling of shock-compressed primordial gas	we find that at redshifts z &gt; 10, hd line cooling allows strongly-shockedprimordial gas to cool to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background(cmb). this temperature is the minimum value attainable via radiative cooling.provided that the abundance of hd, normalized to the total number density,exceeds a critical level of ~ 10^{-8}, the cmb temperature floor is reached ina time which is short compared to the hubble time. we estimate thecharacteristic masses of stars formed out of shocked primordial gas in the wakeof the first supernovae, and resulting from the mergers of dark matter haloesduring hierarchical structure formation to be ~ 10 m_{solar}. in addition, weshow that cooling by hd enables the primordial gas in relic h ii regions tocool to temperatures considerably lower than those reached via h_2 coolingalone. we confirm that hd cooling is unimportant in cases where the primordialgas does not go through an ionized phase, as in the formation process of thevery first stars in z ~ 20 minihaloes of mass ~ 10^{6} m_{solar}.

astro-ph;0507684	the h ii region of the first star	simulations predict that the first stars in an lcdm universe formed atredshifts z&gt;20 in minihalos with masses of about 10^6 m_sun. we have studiedtheir radiative feedback by simulating the propagation of ionization fronts(i-fronts) created by these first population iii stars (m_* = 15-500 m_sun) atz=20, within the density field of a cosmological simulation of primordial starformation, outward thru the host minihalo and into the surrounding gas. athree-dimensional ray-tracing calculation tracks the i-front once the h iiregion evolves a "champagne flow'' inside the minihalo, after the early d-typei-front detaches from the shock and runs ahead, becoming r-type. we takeaccount of the hydrodynamical back-reaction by an approximate model of thecentral wind. we find that the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from thehost halo increases with stellar mass, with 0.7 &lt; f_esc &lt;0.9 for 80 &lt; m_*/m_sun&lt; 500. to quantify the ionizing efficiency of these stars as they begin cosmicreionization, we find that, for m_* &gt; 80 m_sun, the ratio of gas mass ionizedto stellar mass is ~60,000, roughly half the number of ionizing photonsreleased per stellar baryon. nearby minihalos are shown to trap the i-front, sotheir centers remain neutral. this is contrary to the recent suggestion thatthese stars would trigger formation of a second generation by fully ionizingneighboring minihalos, stimulating h_2 formation in their cores. finally, wediscuss how the evacuation of gas from the host halo reduces the growth andluminosity of "miniquasars'' that may form from black hole remnants of thefirst stars.

astro-ph;0509303	high-redshift gamma-ray bursts from population iii progenitors	detection of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) from redshifts z &gt; 7 would open a newwindow into the earliest epoch of cosmic star formation. we construct separatestar formation histories at high redshifts for normal (pop i and ii) stars, andfor predominantly massive (pop iii) stars. based on these separate histories,we predict the grb redshift distribution to be observed by the {\it swift}mission. regardless of whether pop iii progenitors are able to trigger grbs, wefind that a fraction 10% of all bursts detected by {\it swift} will originateat z &gt; 5. this baseline contribution is due to pop i/ii star formation whichmust have extended out to high redshifts in rare massive galaxies that wereenriched by heavy elements earlier than the typical galaxies. in addition, weconsider the possible contribution of pop iii progenitors to the observable grbrate. pop iii stars are viable progenitors for long-duration grbs which aretriggered by the collapsar mechanism, as long as they can lose their outerenvelope through mass transfer to a companion star in a close binary. we findthat the likelihood of pop iii binaries to satisfy the conditions required bythe collapsar mechanism could be enhanced significantly relative to pop i/iibinaries. if pop iii binaries are common, {\it swift} will be first observatoryto probe pop iii star formation at redshifts z &gt; 7.

astro-ph;0605691	the aftermath of the first stars: massive black holes	we investigate the evolution of the primordial gas surrounding the firstmassive black holes formed by the collapse of population iii stars at redshiftsz &gt; 20. carrying out three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations using gadget,we study the dynamical, thermal and chemical evolution of the first relic h iiregions. we also carry out simulations of the mergers of relic h ii regionswith neighboring neutral minihaloes, which contain high density primordial gasthat can accrete onto a pop iii remnant black hole. we find that there may havebeen a significant time delay, of order ~10^8 yr, between black hole formationand the onset of efficient accretion. the build-up of supermassive black holes,believed to power the z &gt; 6 quasars observed in the sloan digital sky survey,therefore faces a crucial early bottleneck. more massive seed black holes maythus be required, such as those formed by the direct collapse of a primordialgas cloud facilitated by atomic line cooling. the high optical depth tolyman-werner (lw) photons that results from the high fraction of h_2 moleculesthat form in relic h ii regions, combined with the continued formation of h_2inside the dynamically expanding relic h ii region, leads to shielding of themolecules inside these regions at least until a critical background lw flux of\~10^{-24} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} hz^{-1} sr^{-1}, is established. furthermore, wefind that a high fraction of hd molecules, x_{hd} &gt; 10^{-7}, is formed,potentially enabling the formation of pop ii.5 stars during later stages ofstructure formation when the relic h ii region gas is assembled into asufficiently deep potential well to gravitationally confine the gas again.

astro-ph;0612254	local radiative feedback in the formation of the first protogalaxies	the formation of the first galaxies is influenced by the radiative feedbackfrom the first generations of stars. this feedback is manisfested by theheating and ionization of the gas which lies within the h ii regionssurrounding the first stars, as well as by the photodissociation of hydrogenmolecules within the larger lyman-werner (lw) bubbles that surround thesesources. using a ray-tracing method in three-dimensional cosmologicalsimulations, we self-consistently track the formation of, and radiativefeedback from, individual stars in the course of the formation of aprotogalaxy. we compute in detail the h ii regions of each of these sources, aswell as the regions affected by their molecule-dissociating radiation. wefollow the thermal, chemical, and dynamical evolution of the primordial gas, asit becomes incorporated into the protogalaxy. while the igm is, in general,optically thick to lw photons only over physical distances of &gt; 30 kpc atredshifts z &lt; 20, the high molecule fraction that is built up in relic h iiregions and their increasing volume-filling fraction renders even the local igmoptically thick to lw photons over physical distances of the order of a fewkiloparsecs. we find that efficient accretion onto population iii relic blackholes may occur after ~ 60 myr from the time of their formation, by which timethe photo-heated relic h ii region gas can cool and re-collapse into the 10^6m_solar minihalo which hosts the black hole. also, pop ii.5 stars, postulatedto have masses of the order of 10 m_solar, can likely form from thisre-collapsing relic h ii region gas. overall, we find that the local radiativefeedback from the first generations of stars suppresses the star formation rateby only a factor of, at most, a few.

astro-ph;0701395	probing the formation of the first low-mass stars with stellar  archaeology	we investigate the conditions under which the first low-mass stars formed inthe universe by confronting theoretical predictions governing the transitionfrom massive population iii to low-mass population ii stars with recentobservational c and/or o abundance data of metal-poor galactic stars. based onan existing theory, we introduce a new "observer-friendly" function, thetransition discriminant d_trans, which provides empirical constraints as wellas a powerful comparison between the currently available data of metal-poorhalo stars and theoretical predictions of the formation of the first low-massstars (&lt;1 m_sun). specifically, we compare the empirical stellar results withthe theory that fine-structure lines of c and o dominate the transition frompop iii to pop ii in the early universe. we find the observational data forhalo objects as well as for dsph galaxies and globular clusters to beconsistent with this theory. an explanation for the observed lack of metal-poorstars in dsph galaxies and globular clusters is also suggested. finally, wepredict that any star to be found with [fe/h]&lt;-4 should have enhanced c and/oro abundances. the high c and o abundances of the two most iron-poor stars arein line with our prediction.

0809.2404	accretion onto seed black holes in the first galaxies	the validity of the hypothesis that the massive black holes in high redshiftquasars grew from stellar-sized "seeds" is contingent on a seed's ability todouble its mass every few ten million years. this requires that the seedaccrete at approximately the eddington-limited rate. in the specific case ofradiatively efficient quasiradial accretion in a metal-poor protogalacticmedium, for which the bondi accretion rate is often prescribed in cosmologicalsimulations of massive black hole formation, we examine the effects of theradiation emitted near the black hole's event horizon on the structure of thesurrounding gas flow. we find that the radiation pressure from photoionizationsignificantly reduces the steady-state accretion rate and renders thequasiradial accretion flow unsteady and inefficient. the time-averagedaccretion rates are a small fraction of the eddington-limited accretion ratefor thomson scattering. the pressure of ly-alpha photons trapped near the hiiregion surrounding the black hole may further attenuate the inflow. theseresults suggest that an alternative to quasiradial, radiatively efficientbondi-like accretion should be sought to explain the rapid growth ofquasar-progenitor seed black holes.

0811.0020	the minimum stellar metallicity observable in the galaxy	the first stars fundamentally transformed the early universe through theirproduction of energetic radiation and the first heavy chemical elements. theimpact on cosmic evolution sensitively depends on their initial mass function(imf), which can be empirically constrained through detailed studies ofancient, metal-poor halo stars in our galaxy. we compare the lowest magnesiumand iron abundances measured in galactic halo stars with theoreticalpredictions for the minimum stellar enrichment provided by population iii starsunder the assumption of a top-heavy imf. to demonstrate that abundancesmeasured in metal-poor stars reflect the chemical conditions at theirformation, and that they can thus be used to derive constraints on theprimordial imf, we carry out a detailed kinematic analysis of a large sample ofmetal-poor stars drawn from the sdss survey. we assess whether interstellaraccretion has altered their surface abundances. we find that accretion isgenerally negligible, even at the extremely low levels where the primordial imfcan be tested. we conclude that the majority of the first stars were verymassive, but had likely masses below ~140 m.

0812.2516	accretion onto intermediate-mass black holes in dense protogalactic  clouds	we present the first results from two-dimensional simulations ofradiatively-efficient accretion of metal-free gas onto intermediate-mass blackholes. we fix the shape of the spectral energy distribution of the radiationproduced near the event horizon and study the structure of the irradiatedlow-angular-momentum accretion flow over three orders of magnitude in radiusfrom the black hole, 10^{14}-10^{17} cm for a 100 m_sun black hole. theluminosity of the central source is made to be proportional to the rate atwhich gas accretes across the inner boundary, which we set just inside thesonic radius. we find that photoionization heating and radiation pressuremodify the structure of the flow. when the ambient gas density is 10^7 cm^{-3},accretion is intermittent and on average reduced to 32% of theeddington-limited rate, two orders of magnitude below the "bondi" rateevaluated ignoring radiation, in agreement with simplified theoretical models.even if the vicinity of the black hole is supplied with high density gas,accretion is rendered inefficient through heating and radiation pressure.
