0910.3211	galactic stellar haloes in the cdm model	we present six simulations of galactic stellar haloes formed by the tidaldisruption of accreted dwarf galaxies in a fully cosmological setting. ourmodel is based on the aquarius project, a suite of high resolution n-bodysimulations of individual dark matter haloes. we tag subsets of particles inthese simulations with stellar populations predicted by the galformsemi-analytic model. our method self-consistently tracks the dynamicalevolution and disruption of satellites from high redshift. the luminosityfunction and structural properties of surviving satellites, which agree wellwith observations, suggest that this technique is appropriate. we find thataccreted stellar haloes are assembled between 1&lt;z&lt;7 from less than 5significant progenitors. these progenitors are old, metal-rich satellites withstellar masses similar to the brightest milky way dwarf spheroidals. incontrast to previous stellar halo simulations, we find that several of thesemajor contributors survive as self-bound systems to the present day. both thenumber of these significant progenitors and their infall times are inherentlystochastic. this results in great diversity among our stellar haloes, whichamplifies small differences between the formation histories of their dark halohosts. the masses and density/surface-brightness profiles of the stellar haloesare consistent with expectations from the milky way and m31. each halo has acomplex structure, consisting of well-mixed components, tidal streams, shellsand other subcomponents. this structure is not adequately described by smoothmodels. we find one example of an accreted thick disk. contrasts in age andmetallicity between halo stars and those in surviving satellites are in broadagreement with recent observations.

0911.1128	grand unification of agn activity in the lambdacdm cosmology	we track the co-evolution of supermassive black holes (smbhs) and their hostgalaxies. the calculation is embedded in the galform semi-analytical modelwhich simulates the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cold dark matter(cdm) universe. during the evolution of the host galaxy, hot and cold gas areadded to the smbh by flows triggered by halo gas cooling, disc instabilitiesand galaxy mergers. this builds up the mass and spin of the bh, and theresulting accretion power regulates the gas cooling and subsequent starformation. the accretion flow is assumed to form a geometrically thin cool discwhen the accretion rate exceeds 0.01\dot{m}_edd, and a geometrically thick,radiatively inefficient hot flow when the accretion rate falls below thisvalue. the resulting quasar optical luminosity function matches observationsvery well, and the mass of the smbh correlates with the mass of the galaxybulge as observed. the bh spin distribution depends strongly on whether the gasin any given accretion episode remains in the same plane (prolonged accretion)or whether, due to self-gravity, it fragments into multiple, randomly alignedaccretion episodes (chaotic accretion). in the chaotic accretion model there isa clear correlation of spin with smbh mass. massive bhs (m&gt;5\times10^8\msun)are hosted by giant elliptical galaxies and are rapidly spinning, while lowermass bhs are hosted in spiral galaxies and have much lower spin. using theblandford-znajek mechanism for jet production to calculate the jet power, ourmodel is able to reproduce the radio loudness of radio galaxies, liners andseyferts. this is the first confirmation that a cdm galaxy formation model canreproduce the observed phenomenology of agn.

1003.0008	the spatial distribution of cold gas in hierarchical galaxy formation  models	the distribution of cold gas in dark matter haloes is driven by key processesin galaxy formation: gas cooling, galaxy mergers, star formation and reheatingof gas by supernovae. we compare the predictions of four different galaxyformation models for the spatial distribution of cold gas. we find thatsatellite galaxies make little contribution to the abundance or clusteringstrength of cold gas selected samples, and are far less important than they arein optically selected samples. the halo occupation distribution function ofpresent-day central galaxies with cold gas mass &gt; 10^9 h^-1 msun is peakedaround a halo mass of ~ 10^11 h^-1 msun, a scale that is set by the agnsuppression of gas cooling. the model predictions for the projected correlationfunction are in good agreement with measurements from the hi parkes all-skysurvey. we compare the effective volume of possible surveys with the squarekilometre array with those expected for a redshift survey in the near-infrared.future redshift surveys using neutral hydrogen emission will be competitivewith the most ambitious spectroscopic surveys planned in the near-infrared.

1004.0711	the parameter space of galaxy formation	semi-analytic models are a powerful tool for studying the formation ofgalaxies. however, these models inevitably involve a significant number ofpoorly constrained parameters that must be adjusted to provide an acceptablematch to the observed universe. in this paper, we set out to quantify thedegree to which observational data-sets can constrain the model parameters. byrevealing degeneracies in the parameter space we can hope to better understandthe key physical processes probed by the data. we use novel mathematicaltechniques to explore the parameter space of the galform semi-analytic model.we base our investigation on the bower et al. 2006 version of galform, adoptingthe same methodology of selecting model parameters based on an acceptable matchto the local bj and k luminosity functions. the model contains 16 parametersthat are poorly constrained, and we investigate this parameter space using themodel emulator technique, constructing a bayesian approximation to the galformmodel that can be rapidly evaluated at any point in parameter space. bycombining successive waves of emulation, we show that only 0.26% of the initialvolume is of interest for further exploration. however, within this region weshow that the bower et al. 2006 model is only one choice from an extendedsub-space of model parameters that can provide equally acceptable fits. weexplore the geometry of this region and begin to explore the physicalconnections between parameters that are exposed by this analysis. we alsoconsider the impact of adding additional observational data to furtherconstrain the parameter space.

1011.5222	the evolution of agn across cosmic time: what is downsizing?	we use a coupled model of the formation and evolution of galaxies and blackholes (bh) to study the evolution of active galactic nuclei (agn) in a colddark matter universe. the model predicts the bh mass, spin and mass accretionhistory. bh mass grows via accretion triggered by discs becoming dynamicallyunstable or galaxy mergers (called the starburst mode) and accretion fromquasi-hydrostatic hot gas haloes (called the hot-halo mode). by taking intoaccount agn obscuration, we obtain a very good fit to the observed luminosityfunctions (lf) of agn (optical, soft and hard x-ray, and bolometric) for a widerange of redshifts (0&lt;z&lt;6). the model predicts a hierarchical build up of bhmass, with the typical mass of actively growing bhs increasing with decreasingredshift. remarkably, despite this, we find downsizing in the agn population,in terms of the differential growth with redshift of the space density of faintand bright agn. this arises naturally from the interplay between the starburstand hot-halo accretion modes. the faint end of the lf is dominated by massivebhs experiencing quiescent accretion via a thick disc, primarily during thehot-halo mode. the bright end of the lf, on the other hand, is dominated by agnwhich host bhs accreting close to or in excess of the eddington limit duringthe starburst mode. the model predicts that the comoving space density of agnpeaks at z~3, similar to the star formation history. however, when taking intoaccount obscuration, the space density of faint agn peaks at lower redshift(z&lt;2) than that of bright agn (z~2-3). this implies that the cosmic evolutionof agn is shaped in part by obscuration.

1111.0721	the contribution of star-forming galaxies to fluctuations in the cosmic  background light	star-forming galaxies which are too faint to be detected individually produceintensity fluctuations in the cosmic background light. this contribution needsto be taken into account as a foreground when using the primordial signal toconstrain cosmological parameters. the extragalactic fluctuations are alsointeresting in their own right as they depend on the star formation history ofthe universe and the way in which this connects with the formation of cosmicstructure. we present a new framework which allows us to predict the occupationof dark matter haloes by star-forming galaxies and uses this information, inconjunction with an n-body simulation of structure formation, to predict thepower spectrum of intensity fluctuations in the infrared background. we computethe emission from galaxies at far-infrared, millimetre and radio wavelengths.our method gives accurate predictions for the clustering of galaxies both forthe one halo and two halo terms. we illustrate our new framework using apreviously published model which reproduces the number counts and redshiftdistribution of galaxies selected by their emission at $850\,\mu$m. withoutadjusting any of the model parameters, the predictions show encouragingagreement at high frequencies and on small angular scales with recent estimatesof the extragalactic fluctuations in the background made from early dataanalysed by the planck collaboration. there are, however, substantialdiscrepancies between the model predictions and observations on large angularscales and at low frequencies, which illustrates the usefulness of theintensity fluctuations as a constraint on galaxy formation models.

1111.2529	principles of supernova-driven winds	the formation of galaxies is regulated by a balance between the supply of gasand the rate at which it is ejected. traditional explanations of gas ejectionequate the energy required to escape the galaxy or host halo to an estimate forthe energy yield from supernovae. this yield is usually assumed to be aconstant fraction of the total available from the supernova, or is derived fromthe assumption of a consistent momentum yield. by applying these ideas in thecontext of a cold dark matter cosmogony, we derive a 1st-order analyticconnection between these working assumptions and the expected relationshipbetween baryon content and galaxy circular velocity, and find that these quickpredictions straddle recent observational estimates. to examine the premisesbehind these theories in more detail, we then explore their applicability to aset of gasdynamical simulations of idealised galaxies. we show that differentpremises dominate to differing degrees in the simulated outflow, depending onthe mass of the system and the resolution with which it is simulated. usingthis study to anticipate the emergent behaviour at arbitrarily high resolution,we motivate more comprehensive analytic model which allows for the range ofvelocities with which the gas may exit the system, and incorporates bothmomentum and energy-based constraints on the outflow. using a trial exitvelocity distribution, this is shown to be compatible with the observed baryonfractions in intermediate-mass systems, but implies that current estimates forlow-mass systems can not be solely accounted for by supernova winds undercommonly-held assumptions.

1203.5339	the journey of qso haloes from z=6 to the present	we apply a recently developed scaling technique to the millennium-xxl, one ofthe largest cosmological n-body simulations carried out to date 3x10^11particles within a cube of volume ~70gpc^3). this allows us to investigate thecosmological parameter dependence of the mass and evolution of haloes in theextreme high-mass tail of the z=6 distribution. we assume these objects to belikely hosts for the population of rare but ultraluminous high-redshift quasarsdiscovered by the sloan digital sky survey. haloes with a similar abundance tothese quasars have a median mass of 9x10^12 msun in the currently preferredcosmology, but do not evolve into equally extreme objects at z=0. rather, theirdescendants span the full range conventionally assigned to present-dayclusters, 6x10^13 to 2.5x10^15 msun for this same cosmology. the masses both atz=6 and at z=0 shift up or down by factors exceeding two if cosmologicalparameters are pushed to the boundaries of the range discussed in publishedinterpretations of data from the wmap satellite. the main factor determiningthe future growth of a high-mass z=6 halo is the mean overdensity of itsenvironment on scales of 7 to 14 mpc, and descendant masses can be predicted 6to 8 times more accurately if this density is known than if it is not. allthese features are not unique to extreme high-z haloes, but are generic tohierarchical growth. finally, we find that extreme haloes at z=6 typicallyacquired about half of their total mass in the preceding 100 myr, implying verylarge recent accretion rates which may be related to the large black holemasses and high luminosities of the sdss quasars.

1301.7127	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): spectroscopic analysis	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey is a multiwavelength photometricand spectroscopic survey, using the aaomega spectrograph on theanglo-australian telescope to obtain spectra for up to ~300000 galaxies over280 square degrees, to a limiting magnitude of r_pet &lt; 19.8 mag. the targetgalaxies are distributed over 0&lt;z&lt;0.5 with a median redshift of z~0.2, althoughthe redshift distribution includes a small number of systems, primarilyquasars, at higher redshifts, up to and beyond z=1. the redshift accuracyranges from sigma_v~50km/s to sigma_v~100km/s depending on the signal-to-noiseof the spectrum. here we describe the gama spectroscopic reduction and analysispipeline. we present the steps involved in taking the raw two-dimensionalspectroscopic images through to flux-calibrated one-dimensional spectra. theresulting gama spectra cover an observed wavelength range of 3750&lt;lambda&lt;8850 aat a resolution of r~1300. the final flux calibration is typically accurate to10-20%, although the reliability is worse at the extreme wavelength ends, andpoorer in the blue than the red. we present details of the measurement ofemission and absorption features in the gama spectra. these measurements arecharacterised through a variety of quality control analyses detailing therobustness and reliability of the measurements. we illustrate the quality ofthe measurements with a brief exploration of elementary emission lineproperties of the galaxies in the gama sample. we demonstrate the luminositydependence of the balmer decrement, consistent with previously publishedresults, and explore further how balmer decrement varies with galaxy mass andredshift. we also investigate the mass and redshift dependencies of the[nii]/halpha vs [oiii]/hbeta spectral diagnostic diagram, commonly used todiscriminate between star forming and nuclear activity in galaxies.

1303.7228	how well can we really estimate the stellar masses of galaxies from  broadband photometry?	the estimated stellar masses of galaxies are widely used to characterize howthe galaxy population evolves over cosmic time. if stellar masses can beestimated in a robust manner, free from any bias, global diagnostics such asthe stellar mass function can be used to constrain the physics of galaxyformation. we explore how galaxy stellar masses, estimated by fittingbroad-band spectral energy distributions (seds) with stellar population models,can be biased as a result of commonly adopted assumptions for thestar-formation and chemical enrichment histories, recycled fractions and dustattenuation curves of galaxies. we apply the observational technique ofbroad-band sed fitting to model galaxy seds calculated by the theoreticalgalaxy formation model galform, isolating the effect of each of theseassumptions. we find that, averaged over the entire galaxy population, thecommon assumption of exponentially declining star-formation histories does notadversely affect stellar mass estimation. we show that fixing the metallicityin sed fitting or using sparsely sampled metallicity grids can introduce massdependent systematics into stellar mass estimates. we find that the commonassumption of a star-dust geometry corresponding to a uniform foreground dustscreen can cause the stellar masses of dusty model galaxies to be significantlyunderestimated. finally, we show that stellar mass functions recovered byapplying sed fitting to model galaxies at high redshift can differsignificantly in both shape and normalization from the intrinsic mass functionspredicted by a given model. given these differences, our methodology of usingstellar masses estimated from model galaxy seds offers a new, self-consistentway to compare model predictions with observations.

astro-ph;0001308	the infrared side of galaxy formation. i. the local universe in the  semi-analytical framework	we present a new evolutionary model for the far-uv to sub-mm properties ofthe galaxy population. this combines a semi-analytic galaxy formation modelbased on hierarchical clustering (galform) with a spectro-photometric codewhich includes dust reprocessing (grasil). the former provides the starformation and metal enrichment histories, together with the gas mass andvarious geometrical parameters, for a representative sample of galaxies formedin different density environments. these quantities allow us to model the sedsof galaxies, taking into account stellar emission and also dust extinction andre-emission. two phases are considered for the dust: molecular cloud complexes,where stars are assumed to be born, and the diffuse interstellar medium. themodel includes both galaxies forming stars quiescently in disks, and starburststriggered by galaxy mergers. we test our models against the observedspectro-photometric properties of galaxies in the local universe. the modelsreproduce fairly well the seds of normal spirals and starbursts, and theirinternal extinction properties. the starbursts follow the observed relationshipbetween the fir to uv luminosity ratio and the slope of the uv continuum. theyalso reproduce the observed starburst attenuation law (calzetti et al 99). thisresult is remarkable, because we use a dust mixture which reproduces the milkyway extinction law. it suggests that the observed attenuation law is related tothe geometry of the stars and dust. we compute galaxy luminosity functions overour wide range of wavelengths, which turn out to be in good agreement withobservational data. the uv continuum turns out to be a poor star formationindicator for our models, whilst the infrared luminosity is much more reliable.

astro-ph;0006109	the impact of galaxy formation on the x-ray evolution of clusters	we present a new model for the x-ray properties of the intracluster mediumthat explicitly includes heating of the gas by the energy released during theevolution of cluster galaxies. we calculate the evolution of clusters bycombining the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation of cole et al. with asimple model for the radial profile of the intracluster gas. we focus on thecluster x-ray luminosity function and on the relation between x-ray temperatureand luminosity. we show that cooling alone is not enough to account for theflatness of the observed t-l relation or for the lack of strong redshiftevolution in the observed x-ray luminosity function. gas heating, on the otherhand, can solve these two problems: in the \lambda-cdm cosmology, our modelreproduces fairly well the t-l relation and the x-ray luminosity function.furthermore, it predicts only weak evolution in these two properties out toz=0.5, in agreement with recent observational data. a successful model requiresan energy input of 1--2 x 10^49 ergs per solar mass of stars formed. this iscomparable to the total energy released by the supernovae associated with theformation of the cluster galaxies. thus, unless the transfer of supernovaeenergy to the intracluster gas is very (perhaps unrealistically) efficient,additional sources of energy, such as mechanical energy from agn winds arerequired. however, the amplification of an initial energy input by the responseof the intracluster medium to protocluster mergers might ease the energyrequirements. our model makes definite predictions for the x-ray properties ofgroups and clusters at high redshift which may soon be tested with data fromthe chandra and newton satellites.

astro-ph;0008216	modelling the extinction properties of galaxies	recently (granato, lacey, silva et al. 2000, astro-ph/0001308) we havecombined our spectrophotometric galaxy evolution code which includes dustreprocessing (grasil, silva et al. 1998) with semi-analytical galaxy formationmodels (galform, cole et al. 1999). one of the most characteristic features ofthe former is that the dust is divided in two main phases: molecular cloudcomplexes, where stars are assumed to be born, and the diffuse interstellarmedium. as a consequence, stellar populations of different ages have differentgeometrical relationships with the two phases, which is essential inunderstanding several observed properties of galaxies, in particular thoseundergoing major episodes of star formation at any redshift. indeed, our mergedgrasil+galform model reproduces fairly well the seds of normal spirals andstarbursts from the far-uv to the sub-mm and their internal extinctionproperties. in particular in the model the observed starburst attenuation law(calzetti 1999) is accounted for as an effect of geometry of stars and dust,and has nothing to do with the optical properties of dust grains.

astro-ph;0103092	the evolution of the galaxy distribution	we follow the evolution of the galaxy population in a lambda-cdm cosmology bymeans of high-resolution n-body simulations in which the formation of galaxiesand their observable properties are calculated using a semi-analytic model. wedisplay images of the spatial distribution of galaxies in the simulations thatillustrate its evolution and provide a qualitative understanding of theprocesses responsible for various biases that develop. we consider threespecific statistical measures of clustering at z=1 and z=0: the correlationlength (in real- and redshift-space) of galaxies of different luminosity, themorphology-density relation and the genus curve of the topology of galaxyisodensity surfaces. for galaxies with luminosity below l*, the z=0 correlationlength depends very little on the luminosity of the sample, but for brightergalaxies it increases very rapidly, reaching values in excess of 10mpc/h. the"accelerated" dynamical evolution experienced by galaxies in rich clusters,which is partly responsible for this effect, also results in a strongmorphology-density relation. remarkably, this relation is alreadywell-established at z=1. the genus curves of the galaxies are significantlydifferent from the genus curves of the dark matter but this is not due togenuine topological differences but rather to the sparse sampling of thedensity field provided by galaxies. the predictions of our model at z=0 will betested by forthcoming data from the 2df and sloan galaxy surveys, and those atz=1 by the deep and virmos surveys.

astro-ph;0105500	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: luminosity dependence of galaxy  clustering	we investigate the dependence of the strength of galaxy clustering onintrinsic luminosity using the anglo-australian two degree field galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs). the 2dfgrs is over an order of magnitude larger thanprevious redshift surveys used to address this issue. we measure the projectedtwo-point correlation function of galaxies in a series of volume-limitedsamples. the projected correlation function is free from any distortion of theclustering pattern induced by peculiar motions and is well described by apower-law in pair separation over the range 0.1 &lt; r /h mpc &lt; 10. the clusteringof l* galaxies in real space is well fit by a correlation length r0 = 4.9 +/-0.3 /h mpc and power-law slope gamma = 1.71 +/- 0.06. the clustering amplitudeincreases slowly with absolute magnitude for galaxies fainter than m*, butrises more strongly at higher luminosities. at low luminosities, our resultsagree with measurements from the ssrs2 by benoist et al. however, we find aweaker dependence of clustering strength on luminosity at the highestluminosities. the correlation function amplitude increases by a factor of 4.0between $m_{b_{j}} -5\log_{10}h = -18$ and -22.5, and the most luminousgalaxies are 3.0 times more strongly clustered than l* galaxies. the power-lawslope of the correlation function shows remarkably little variation for samplesspanning a factor of 20 in luminosity. our measurements are in very goodagreement with the predictions of the hierarchical galaxy formation models ofbenson et al.

astro-ph;0106430	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the population of nearby radio galaxies  at the 1 mjy level	we use redshift determinations and spectral analysis of galaxies in the 2dfgalaxy redshift survey to study the properties of local radio sources with$s\ge 1$ mjy. 557 objects drawn from the first survey, corresponding to 2.3 percent of the total radio sample, are found in the 2dfgrs cataloge within thearea $9^h 48^m \simlt {\rm ra}({\rm 2000}) \simlt 14^h 32^m$ and $-2.77^\circ\simlt {\rm dec}({\rm 2000}) \simlt 2.25^\circ$, down to a magnitude limit$b_j= 19.45$. the excellent quality of 2df spectra allows us to divide thesesources into classes, according to their optical spectra. radio galaxies (i.e.absorption systems, mainly belonging to the class of fr i sources, whosespectra may or may not show emission lines due to agn activity) make up 63 percent of the spectroscopic sample; they are characterized by relatively highradio-to-optical ratios, red colours and luminosities $10^{21}\simlt p_{1.4{\rmghz}} w hz^${-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ \simlt 10^{24}$. actively star-forming galaxiesinstead contribute with 30 per cent to the total sample. these objects --principally found at low redshifts ($z \simlt 0.1$) -- in general show lowradio-to-optical ratios, blue colours and low radio luminosities. we also found18 seyfert 2 galaxies and 4 seyfert 1's. analysis of the local radio luminosityfunction shows that radio galaxies are well described by models that assumepure luminosity evolution, at least down to radio powers $p_{1.4{\rmghz}}\simlt 10^{20.5} w hz$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ late-type galaxies, whose relativecontribution to the rlf is found to be lower than was predicted by previouswork, present a luminosity function which is compatible with the iras galaxylf, and therefore plausibly constitute the radio counterpart of the dustyspirals and starbursts that dominate the counts at 60 $\mu$m.

astro-ph;0108217	the effects of photoionization on galaxy formation - i: model and  results at z=0	we develop a coupled model for the evolution of the global properties of theintergalactic medium (igm) and the formation of galaxies, in the presence of aphotoionizing background due to stars and quasars. we use this model to predictthe thermodynamic history of the igm when photoionized by galaxies forming in acold dark matter (cdm) universe. the evolution of the galaxies is calculatedusing a semi-analytical model, including a detailed treatment of the effects oftidal stripping and dynamical friction on satellite galaxies orbiting insidelarger dark matter halos. we include in the model the negative feedback ongalaxy formation from the photoionizing background. photoionization inhibitsgalaxy formation in low-mass dark matter halos in two ways: (i) heating of theigm and inhibition of the collapse of gas into dark halos by the igm pressure,and (ii) reduction in the radiative cooling of gas within halos. the result ofour method is a self-consistent model of galaxy formation and the igm. the igmis reheated twice (during reionization of hi and heii), and we find that thestar formation rate per unit volume is slightly suppressed after each episodeof reheating. we find that galaxies brighter than l_* are mostly unaffected byreionization, while the abundance of faint galaxies is significantly reduced,leading to present-day galaxy luminosity functions with shallow faint endslopes, in good agreement with recent observational data. reionization alsoaffects other properties of these faint galaxies, in a readily understandableway.

astro-ph;0110676	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: constraints on cosmic star-formation  history from the cosmic spectrum	we present the first results on the history of star formation in the universebased on the `cosmic spectrum', in particular, the volume-averaged,luminosity-weighted, stellar absorption line spectrum of present day galaxiesfrom the 2dfgrs. this method is novel in that unlike previous studies it is notan estimator based on total luminosity density. the cosmic spectrum is fittedwith models of population synthesis, tracing the history of star formationprior to the epoch of the observed galaxies, using a method we have developedwhich decouples continuum and spectral-line variations and is robust againstspectrophotometric uncertainties. the cosmic spectrum can only be fitted withmodels incorporating chemical evolution and indicates there was a peak ofstar-formation rate in the past of at least three times the current value andthat the increase back to z=1, assuming it scales as (1+z)^beta, has a strongupper limit of beta&lt;5. we find in the general case there is some modeldegeneracy between star formation at low and high redshift. however, if weincorporate previous work on star formation at z&lt;1 we can put strong upperlimits on the sfr at z&gt;1: e.g., if beta&gt;2 then the sfr for 1&lt;z&lt;5 scales as(1+z)^alpha with alpha&lt;2. this is equivalent to stating that no more than 80%of stars in the universe formed at z&gt;1. our results are consistent with thebest-fit results from compilations of cosmic sfr estimates based on uvluminosity density, which give 1.8&lt;beta&lt;2.9 and -1.0&lt;alpha&lt;0.7, and are alsoconsistent with estimates of omega_stars based on the k-band luminositydensity.

astro-ph;0112161	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the bias of galaxies and the density of  the universe	we compute the bispectrum of the 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) and useit to measure the bias parameter of the galaxies. this parameter quantifies thestrength of clustering of the galaxies relative to the mass in the universe. byanalysing 80 million triangle configurations in the wavenumber range 0.1 &lt; k &lt;0.5 h/mpc (i.e. on scales roughly between 5 and 30 mpc/h) we find that thelinear bias parameter is consistent with unity: b_1=1.04 pm 0.11, and thequadratic (nonlinear) bias is consistent with zero: b_2=-0.054 pm 0.08. thus,at least on large scales, optically-selected galaxies do indeed trace theunderlying mass distribution. the bias parameter can be combined with the2dfgrs measurement of the redshift distortion parameter beta =omega_m^{0.6}/b_1, to yield omega_m = 0.27 pm 0.06 for the matter density ofthe universe, a result which is determined entirely from this survey,independently of other datasets. our measurement of the matter density of theuniverse should be interpreted as omega_m at the effective redshift of thesurvey (z=0.17).

astro-ph;0212375	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: correlation functions, peculiar  velocities and the matter density of the universe	we present a detailed analysis of the two-point correlation function, fromthe 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). we estimate the redshift-spacecorrelation function, xi(s), from which we measure the redshift-spaceclustering length, s_0=6.82+/-0.28 mpc/h. we also estimate the projectedcorrelation function, xi(sigma), and the real-space correlation function,xi(r), which can be fit by a power-law, with r_0=5.05+/-0.26mpc/h,gamma_r=1.67+/-0.03. for r&gt;20mpc/h, xi drops below a power-law as is expectedin the popular lcdm model. the ratio of amplitudes of the real andredshift-space correlation functions on scales of 8-30mpc/h gives an estimateof the redshift-space distortion parameter beta. the quadrupole moment of xi onscales 30-40mpc/h provides another estimate of beta. we also estimate thedistribution function of pairwise peculiar velocities, f(v), includingrigorously the effect of infall velocities, and find that it is well fit by anexponential. the accuracy of our xi measurement is sufficient to constrain amodel, which simultaneously fits the shape and amplitude of xi(r) and the tworedshift-space distortion effects parameterized by beta and velocitydispersion, a. we find beta=0.49+/-0.09 and a=506+/-52km/s, though the best fitvalues are strongly correlated. we measure the variation of the peculiarvelocity dispersion with projected separation, a(sigma), and find that theshape is consistent with models and simulations. using the constraints on biasfrom recent estimates, and taking account of redshift evolution, we concludethat beta(l=l*,z=0)=0.47+/-0.08, and that the present day matter density of theuniverse is 0.3, consistent with other 2dfgrs estimates and independentanalyses.

astro-ph;0302450	what shapes the luminosity function of galaxies?	we investigate the physical mechanisms that shape the luminosity function.beginning with the mass function of dark matter halos, we show how gas cooling,photoionization, feedback, merging and thermal conduction affect the shape ofthe luminosity function. we consider three processes whereby supernovae canaffect the forming galaxy: (1) reheating of disk gas to the halo temperature;(2) expansion of the diffuse halo gas; (3) expulsion of cold disk gas from thehalo. while feedback of form (1) is able to flatten the faint end of theluminosity function, this alone does not produce the sharp cut-off observed atlarge luminosities. feedback of form (2) is also unable to solve this problem.the relative paucity of very bright galaxies can only be explained if coolingin massive halos is strongly suppressed. conduction is a promising mechanism,but an uncomfortably high efficiency is required to suppress cooling to thedesired level. if, instead, superwinds are responsible for the lack of brightgalaxies, then the total energy budget required to obtain a good match to thegalaxy luminosity function greatly exceeds the energy available from supernovaexplosions. the mechanism is only viable if the formation of centralsupermassive black holes play a crucial role in limiting the amount of starsthat form in the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0303668	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: galaxy clustering per spectral type	we have calculated the two-point correlation functions in redshift space,xi(sigma,pi), for galaxies of different spectral types in the 2df galaxyredshift survey. using these correlation functions we are able to estimatevalues of the linear redshift-space distortion parameter, beta = omega_m^0.6/b,the pairwise velocity dispersion, a, and the real-space correlation function,xi(r), for galaxies with both relatively low star-formation rates (for whichthe present rate of star formation is less than 10% of its past averaged value)and galaxies with higher current star-formation activity. at small separations,the real-space clustering of passive galaxies is very much stronger than thatof the more actively star-forming galaxies; the correlation-function slopes arerespectively 1.93 and 1.50, and the relative bias between the two classes is adeclining function of radius. on scales larger than 10 h^-1 mpc there isevidence that the relative bias tends to a constant, b(passive)/b(active) ~ 1.this result is consistent with the similar degrees of redshift-spacedistortions seen in the correlation functions of the two classes -- thecontours of xi(sigma,pi) require beta(active)=0.49+/-0.13, andbeta(passive)=0.48+/-0.14. the pairwise velocity dispersion is highlycorrelated with beta. however, despite this a significant difference is seenbetween the two classes. over the range 8-20 h^-1 mpc, the pairwise velocitydispersion has mean values 416+/-76 km/s and 612+/-92 km/s for the active andpassive galaxy samples respectively. this is consistent with the expectationfrom morphological segregation, in which passively evolving galaxiespreferentially inhabit the cores of high-mass virialised regions.

astro-ph;0307298	heating of galactic disks by infalling satellites	we develop an analytic model to calculate the rate at which galaxy disks areheated by dark matter substructures orbiting in their halos. the model takesinto account the internal structure, mass function and accretion rate ofsatellites expected in the lambdacdm cosmology, as well as the growth of thedisk by accretion and mergers, but it ignores resonant heating of the disk andthe dynamical effects of spiral arms and bars. we calibrate this model againstn-body simulations and demonstrate that it is able to reproduce the n-bodyheating rates to within a factor of 3 in the majority of cases. our model givesthe distribution of disk scale-heights for galaxies of different luminosities.for l* spiral galaxies, it predicts a median disk thickness of only 5% of theradial scale-length if substructure is the only source of heating. the mediandisk thickness increases to nearly 20% of the radial scale-length when heatingdue to gravitational scattering of stars by molecular clouds is also included.the latter value is close to the thickness estimated observationally for thedisk of the milky way galaxy. the distribution of disk thickness predicted bythe model is also consistent with a recent observational determination forsub-l* galaxies by bizyaev &amp; mitronova. thus, the observed thickness of thestellar disks of spiral galaxies seems to be entirely compatible with theabundance of substructure in dark matter halos predicted by the standardlambda-dominated cold dark matter model of structure formation. in an omega_0=1universe, our best model of galaxy formation produces similar scale-heights, aconsequence of the fact that similar amounts of substructure are accreted byhalos during the lifetime of the disk in omega_0=1 and omega_0=0.3,lambda_0=0.7 cold dark matter cosmologies.

astro-ph;0507583	cosmological parameters from cmb measurements and the final 2dfgrs power  spectrum	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters using the power spectrum ofgalaxy clustering measured from the final two-degree field galaxy redshiftsurvey (2dfgrs) and a compilation of measurements of the temperature powerspectrum and temperature-polarization cross-correlation of the cosmic microwavebackground radiation. we analyse a range of parameter sets and priors, allowingfor massive neutrinos, curvature, tensors and general dark energy models. inall cases, the combination of datasets tightens the constraints, with the mostdramatic improvements found for the density of dark matter and theenergy-density of dark energy. if we assume a flat universe, we find a matterdensity parameter of $\omega_{\rm m}=0.237 \pm 0.020$, a baryon densityparameter of $\omega_{\rm b} = 0.041 \pm 0.002$, a hubble constant of$h_{0}=74\pm2 {\rm kms}^{-1}{\rm mpc}^{-1}$, a linear theory matter fluctuationamplitude of $\sigma_{8}=0.77\pm0.05$ and a scalar spectral index of $n_{\rms}=0.954 \pm 0.023$ (all errors show the 68% interval). our estimate of $n_{\rms}$ is only marginally consistent with the scale invariant value $n_{\rm s}=1$;this spectrum is formally excluded at the 95% confidence level. however, thedetection of a tilt in the spectrum is sensitive to the choice of parameterspace. if we allow the equation of state of the dark energy to float, we find$w_{\rm de}= -0.85_{-0.17}^{+0.18}$, consistent with a cosmological constant.we also place new limits on the mass fraction of massive neutrinos: $f_{\nu} &lt;0.105$ at the 95% level, corresponding to $\sum m_{\nu} &lt; 1.2$ ev.

astro-ph;0510643	galaxy groups in the 2dfgrs: the number density of groups	the abundance of galaxy clusters as a function of mass is determined usingthe 2dfgrs percolation-inferred galaxy group (2pigg) catalogue. this is used toestimate the amplitude of the matter fluctuation spectrum, parametrised by thelinear theory rms density fluctuations in spheres of 8mpc/h, sigma_8. thebest-fitting value for this parameter is highly correlated with the mean matterdensity in the universe, omega_m, and is found to satisfysigma_8=0.25omega_m^{-0.92-4.5(omega_m-0.22)^2}+/-10%(statistical)+/-20%(systematic) for 0.18&lt;omega_m&lt;0.50, assuming that omega_m+omega_lambda=1. thisgives sigma_8=0.89 when omega_m=0.25. a ~20% correction has been applied toundo the systematic bias inherent in the measurement procedure. mockcatalogues, constructed from large cosmological n-body simulations, are used tohelp understand and model these systematic errors. the abundance of galaxygroups as a function of group bj band luminosity is also determined. this isused in conjunction with the halo mass function, determined from simulations,to infer the variation of halo mass-to-light ratio over four orders ofmagnitude in halo mass. the mass-to-light ratio shows a minimum value of100hm_sol/l_sol in the bj band at a total group luminosity of l_bj ~5.10^9lsol/h^2. together with the observed tully-fisher relation, this impliesthat the observed rotation speed of tully-fisher galaxies is within ~10% of thetypical circular speed of haloes hosting brightest galaxies of the sameluminosity.

astro-ph;0511338	the broken hierarchy of galaxy formation	recent observations of the distant universe suggest that much of the stellarmass of bright galaxies was already in place at $z&gt;1$. this presents achallenge for models of galaxy formation because massive halos are assembledlate in hierarchical cosmologies such as cold dark matter (cdm). in this paper,we discuss a new implementation of the durham semi-analytic model in whichfeedback due to active galactic nuclei (agn) is assumed to quench cooling flowsin massive halos. this mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxyluminosity function at bright magnitudes. the model is implemented within themillennium n-body simulation; the accurate dark matter merger trees and largenumber of realizations of the galaxy formation process that the simulationprovides results in highly accurate statistics. after adjusting the values ofthe physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of localgalaxies, we use it to investigate the evolution of the k-band luminosity andgalaxy stellar mass functions. we also calculate the volume averaged starformation rate density of the universe as a function of redshift and the way inwhich this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. the modelrobustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift$z\sim 5$ and a star formation rate density which rises with increasingredshift in objects of all masses. although observational data on theseproperties have been cited as evidence for ``anti-hierarchical'' galaxyformation, we find that when agn feedback is taken into account, thefundamentally hierachical cdm model provides a very good match to theseobservations.

astro-ph;0512073	the effect of gravitational recoil on black holes forming in a  hierarchical universe	galactic bulges are known to harbour central black holes whose mass istightly correlated with the stellar mass and velocity dispersion of the bulge.in a hierarchical universe, mergers of subgalactic units are accompanied by theamalgamation of bulges and the likely coalescence of galactocentric blackholes. in these mergers, the beaming of gravitational radiation during theplunge phase of the black hole collision can impart a linear momentum kick or``gravitational recoil'' to the remnant. if large enough, this kick will ejectthe remnant from the galaxy and populate intergalactic space with wanderingblack holes. using a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, we investigatethe effect of black hole ejections on the scatter in the relation between blackhole and bulge mass. we find that although not the dominant source of themeasured scatter, they do make a significant contribution and may be used toset a constraint, v_kick&lt;500 km/s, on the typical kick velocity, in agreementwith values found from general relativistic calculations. even for the moremodest kick velocities implied by these calculations, we find that asubstantial number of central black holes are ejected from the progenitors ofpresent day galaxies, giving rise to a population of wandering intrahalo andintergalactic black holes whose distribution we investigate in high-resolutionn-body simulations of milk-way mass halos. we find that intergalactic blackholes make up only ~2-3% of the total galactic black hole mass but, within ahalo, wandering black holes can contribute up to about half of the total blackhole mass orbiting the central galaxy. intrahalo black holes offer a naturalexplanation for the compact x-ray sources often seen near the centres ofgalaxies and for the hyperluminous non-central x-ray source in m82.

astro-ph;0603679	the nature of (sub)-mm galaxies in hierarchical models	we present a hierarchical galaxy formation model which can account for thenumber counts of sources detected through their emission at sub-millimetrewavelengths. the first stage in our approach is an ab initio calculation of thestar formation histories for a representative sample of galaxies, which iscarried out using the semi-analytical galaxy formation model galform. thesestar formation histories are then input into the spectro-photometric codegrasil, to produce a spectral energy distribution for each galaxy. dustextinction and emission are treated self consistently in our model, withouthaving to resort to ad-hoc assumptions about the amount of attenuation by dustor the temperature at which the dust radiates. we argue that it is necessary tomodify the form of the stellar initial mass function in starbursts in order tomatch the observed number of sub-mm sources, if we are to retain the previousgood matches enjoyed between observations and model predictions in the localuniverse. we also list some other observational tests that have been passed byour model.

astro-ph;9602085	evolution of the hubble sequence in hierarchical models for galaxy  formation	we present a model for the broad morphological distinction between the diskand spheroidal components of galaxies. elaborating on the hierarchicalclustering scheme of galaxy formation proposed by cole et al., we assume thatgalaxies form stars quiescently in a disk until they are disrupted into aspheroidal configuration by mergers. we calculate formation and merginghistories, and the evolution in colour, luminosity and morphology of the galaxypopulations in different environments. roughly $ 50\ %$ of ellipticals in ourmodel have undergone a major merger since $z = 0.5$, yet in spite of this wefind that cluster ellipticals have colour-magnitude diagrams with remarkablysmall scatter. the morphological mix of galaxies that become rich clustermembers at high redshift is dominated by spiral galaxies, due to the longtimescale for galaxy mergers compared with the timescale for cluster assemblyat high redshift. the assembly of low redshift clusters is slower, allowingmore galaxy mergers to occur in the progenitor halos. as a result $z=0$ richclusters become e/s0 dominated and we find a ``butcher-oemler'' effect thatbecomes weaker for poorer groups at high redshift. the field luminosityfunction of red galaxies shows little evolution out to $z\simeq 1$ and thereddest galaxies at these redshifts are as bright as their local counterparts.the blue luminosity function, on the other hand, evolves rapidly with redshift,increasing its characteristic luminosity and becoming steeper at the faint end.these trends are similar to those recently observed in the canada-franceredshift survey.

astro-ph;9607056	faint counts as a function of morphological type in a hierarchical  merger model	the unprecedented resolution of the refurbished wide field and planetarycamera 2 (wfpc2) on the hubble space telescope (hst) has led to major advancesin our understanding of galaxy formation. the high image quality in the mediumdeep survey and hubble deep field has made it possible, for the first time, toclassify faint distant galaxies according to morphological type. theseobservations have revealed a large population of galaxies classed as irregularsor which show signs of recent merger activity. their abundance rises steeplywith apparent magnitude, providing a likely explanation for the large number ofblue galaxies seen at faint magnitudes. we demonstrate that such a populationarises naturally in a model in which structure forms hierarchically and whichis dynamically dominated by cold dark matter. the number counts of irregular,spiral and elliptical galaxies as a function of magnitude seen in the hst dataare well reproduced in this model.we present detailed predictions for theoutcome of spectroscopic follow-up observations of the hst surveys. bymeasuring the redshift distributions of faint galaxies of differentmorphological types, these programmes will provide a test of the hierarchicalgalaxy formation paradigm and might distinguish between models with differentcosmological parameters.

astro-ph;9612109	numerical and analytical modelling of galaxy formation and evolution	we review recent developments in theoretical studies of galaxy formation andevolution. in combination with new data from hst, keck and other largetelescopes, numerical and semi-analytic modelling is beginning to build up acoherent picture of galaxy formation. we summarize the current status ofmodelling of various galactic properties such as the structure of dark matterhalos, the galaxy luminosity function, the tully-fisher relation, thecolour-magnitude relation for ellipticals, the gross morphological propertiesof galaxies and the counts of faint galaxies as a function of magnitude,redshift and morphology. many of these properties can be explained, at least atsome level, within a broad class of cdm cosmologies, but a number offundamental issues remain unresolved. we use our semi-analytic model of galaxyformation to interpret the evolutionary status of the lyman-break galaxies at$z\simeq 3-3.5$ recently discovered by steidel et al. the abundance and globalproperties of these objects are compatible with model predictions in a varietyof cdm cosmologies, including the standard version. all these models predictmild evolution in the distribution of star formation rates which peaks ataround $z\simeq 1$, but is never much larger than it is at present. the steidelet al. lyman-break galaxies are among the very first objects in whichappreciable star formation is taking place; they thus signal the onset ofgalaxy formation. we present three example evolutionary histories oflyman-break galaxies which illustrate that these objects are the precursors ofpresent day, normal, bright ellipticals and spirals.

astro-ph;9703111	the epoch of galaxy formation	we use a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in hierarchical clusteringtheories to interpret recent data on galaxy formation and evolution, focussingprimarily on the recently discovered population of lyman-break galaxies at$z\simeq 3$. for a variety of cold dark matter (cdm) cosmologies we constructmock galaxy catalogues subject to identical selection criteria to those appliedto the real data. we find that the expected number of lyman-break galaxies isvery sensitive to the assumed stellar initial mass function and to thenormalization of the primordial power spectrum. for reasonable choices of theseand other model parameters, it is possible to reproduce the observed abundanceof lyman-break galaxies in cdm models with $\omega_0=1$ and with $\omega_0&lt;1$.these galaxies generally form from rare peaks at high redshift and, as aresult, their spatial distribution is strongly biased, with a typical biasparameter, $b\simeq 4$, and a comoving correlation length, $r_0\simeq 4 \mpc$.the typical sizes of these galaxies, $\sim 0.5\kpc$, are substantially smallerthan those of present day bright galaxies. in combination with data at lowerredshifts, the lyman-break galaxies can be used to trace the cosmic starformation history. most galaxies (in our models and in the data) neverexperience star formation rates in excess of a few solar masses per year. ourmodels predict that even at $z=5$, the integrated star formation rate issimilar to that measured locally, although less than 1% of all the stars haveformed prior to this redshift. these galaxies mark the onset of the epoch ofgalaxy formation that continues into the present day. the basic ingredients ofa consistent picture of galaxy formation may well be now in place.

astro-ph;9707186	modelling the redshift-space distortion of galaxy clustering	we use a set of large, high-resolution cosmological n-body simulations toexamine the redshift-space distortions of galaxy clustering on scales of order10-200h^{-1} mpc. galaxy redshift surveys currently in progress will, oncompletion, allow us to measure the quadrupole distortion in the 2-pointcorrelation function, \xi(\sigma,\pi), or its fourier transform, the powerspectrum, p(k,\mu), to a high degree of accuracy. on these scales we typicallyfind a positive quadrupole, as expected for coherent infall onto overdenseregions and outflow from underdense regions, but the distortion issubstantially weaker than that predicted by pure linear theory. we assess twomodels that may be regarded as refinements to linear theory, the zel'dovichapproximation and a dispersion model in which the non-linear velocitiesgenerated by the formation of virialized groups and clusters are treated asrandom perturbations to the velocities predicted by linear theory. we find thatneither provides an adequate physical description of the clustering pattern. ifused to model redshift spacedistortions on scales for 10&lt;\lambda &lt;200 h^{-1}mpcthe estimated value of \beta (\beta=f(\omega_0)/b where f(\omega_0) ~\omega_0^{0.6} and b is the galaxy bias parameter) is liable to systematicerrors of order ten per cent or more. we discuss how such systematics can beavoided by i) development of a more complete model of redshift distortions andii) the direct use of galaxy catalogues generated from non-linear n-bodysimulations.

astro-ph;9802350	measuring omega_0 using cluster evolution	the evolution of the galaxy cluster abundance depends sensitively on thevalue of the cosmological density parameter, omega_0. recent asca data are usedto quantify this evolution as measured by the x-ray temperature function. achi^2 minimisation fit to the cumulative temperature function, as well as amaximum likelihood estimate (which requires additional assumptions aboutcluster luminosities), lead to the estimate omega_0 \approx 0.45+/-0.2 (1-sigmastatistical error). various systematic uncertainties are considered, none ofwhich enhance significantly the probability that omega_0=1. these conclusionshold for models with or without a cosmological constant. the statisticaluncertainties are at least as large as the individual systematic errors thathave been considered here, suggesting that additional temperature measurementsof distant clusters will allow an improvement in this estimate. an alternativemethod that uses the highest redshift clusters to place an upper limit onomega_0 is also presented and tentatively applied, with the result thatomega_0=1 can be ruled out at the 98 per cent confidence level. whilst thismethod does not require a well-defined statistical sample of distant clusters,there are still modelling uncertainties that preclude a firmer conclusion atthis time.

astro-ph;9803030	the seeds of rich galaxy clusters in the universe	the discovery of a population of young galaxies at an epoch when the universewas about one tenth of its current age has shed new light on the question ofwhen and how galaxies formed. within the context of popular models this is thepopulation of primeval galaxies that built themselves up to the size ofpresent--day galaxies through the process of repeated mergers. but the recentdetection of a large concentration of these primeval galaxies (steidel et al.1997) appears to be incompatible with hierarchical clustering models, whichgenerally predict that clusters of this size are fully formed later in time.here we use a combination of two powerful theoretical techniques--semi-analytic modelling and n-body simulations-- to show that such largeconcentrations should be quite common in a universe dominated by cold darkmatter, and that they are the progenitors of the rich galaxy clusters seentoday. we predict the clustering properties of primeval galaxies which should,when compared with data that will be collected in the near future, test ourunderstanding of galaxy formation within the framework of a universe dominatedby cold dark matter.

astro-ph;9808209	early type galaxies in the hierarchical universe	any realistic theory of galaxy formation must be set in the context of amodel for the formation of structure in the universe. we describe a powerfulapproach -- semi-analytic modelling -- that combines a set of simple rulesdescribing the gas processes involved in galaxy formation with a scheme tofollow the hierarchical growth of dark matter haloes. surprisingly few freeparameters are required to specify the model, and these are fixed withreference to a subset of local observational data. the model produces the fullstar formation history of a galaxy, allowing a wide range of predictions to bemade. we review some of the successes of the models, namely the star formationhistory of the universe and the evolution of galaxy clustering, before focusingour attention on early-type galaxies. we discuss the observational evidenceagainst the classical picture in which early-type galaxies form at somearbitrarily high redshift in a single monolithic collapse and burst of starformation. the alternative scenario in which spheroidal systems are formed bythe merger of disk galaxies is outlined. we review some of the predictions ofthis model, namely the colour-magnitude relation, the faint counts and theevolution of cluster membership.

astro-ph;9811222	modelling the evolution of galaxy clustering	measurements of galaxy clustering are now becoming possible over a range ofredshifts out to z=3. we use a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation tocompute the expected evolution of the galaxy correlation function withredshift. we illustrate how the degree of clustering evolution is sensitive tothe details of the sample selection. for a fixed apparent magnitude limit,galaxies selected at higher redshifts are located in progressively rarer darkmatter haloes, compared with the general population of galaxies in place ateach redshift. as a result these galaxies are highly biased tracers of theunderlying dark matter distribution and exhibit stronger clustering than thedark matter. in general, the correlation length measured in comoving units,decreases at first with increasing redshift, before increasing again at higherredshift. we show that the epsilon-model often used to interpret the angularcorrelation function of faint galaxies gives an inadequate description of theevolution of clustering, and offers no physical insight into the clusteringprocess. we compare our predictions with those of a simple, popular model inwhich a one-to-one correspondence between galaxies and dark halos is assumed.qualitatively, this model reproduces the correct evolutionary behaviour at highredshift, but the quantitative results can be significantly in error. ourtheoretical expectations are in good agreement with the high redshiftclustering data of carlberg etal and postman etal but are higher than themeasurements of le fevre etal.

astro-ph;9903343	the nature of galaxy bias and clustering	we have used a combination of high resolution cosmological n-body simulationsand semi-analytic modelling of galaxy formation to investigate the processesthat determine the spatial distribution of galaxies in cold dark matter (cdm)models. the galaxy distribution depends sensitively on the efficiency withwhich galaxies form in halos of different mass. in small mass halos, galaxyformation is inhibited by the reheating of cooled gas by feedback processes,whereas in large mass halos, it is inhibited by the long cooling time of thegas. as a result, the mass-to-light ratio of halos has a deep minimum at thehalo mass associated with l* galaxies. this leads to a scale dependent bias inthe distribution of galaxies relative to the distribution of mass. on largescales, the bias in the galaxy distribution is related in a simple way to thebias in the distribution of massive halos. on small scales, the correlationfunction is determined by the interplay between various effects including thespatial exclusion of dark matter halos, the distribution function of the numberof galaxies occupying a single dark matter halo and, to a lesser extent,dynamical friction. remarkably, these processes conspire to produce acorrelation function in a flat, omega_0=0.3, cdm model that is close to apower-law over nearly four orders of magnitude in amplitude. this model agreeswell with the correlation function of galaxies measured in the apm survey. onsmall scales, the model galaxies are less strongly clustered than the darkmatter whereas on large scales, they trace the occupied halos. our clusteringpredictions are robust to changes in the parameters of the galaxy formationmodel, provided only those models that match the bright end of the galaxyluminosity function are considered.

astro-ph;9903472	cosmological parameters from cluster abundances, cmb and iras	we combine information on cosmological parameters from cluster abundances,cmb primordial anisotropies and the iras 1.2 jy galaxy redshift survey. we takeas free parameters the present values of the total matter density of theuniverse, omega_m, the hubble parameter, h, sigma_8, and the iras biasingfactor, b_iras. we assume that the universe is spatially flat, with acosmological constant, and that structure formed from adiabatic initialfluctuations with a harrison-zel'dovich power spectrum. the nucleosynthesisvalue omega_b=0.019/h^2 is adopted. we use the full three- and four-dimensional likelihood functions for each data set and marginalise these totwo- and one- dimensional distributions in a bayesian way, integrating over theother parameters. it is shown that the three data sets are in excellentagreement, with a best fit point of omega_m= 1-omega_lambda=0.36, h=0.54,sigma_8=0.74, and b_iras=1.08. this point is within one sigma of the minimumfor each data set alone. pairs of these data sets have their degeneracies insufficiently different directions that using only two data sets at a time issufficient to place good constraints on the cosmological parameters. we showthat the results from each of the three possible pairings of the data are alsoin good agreement. finally, we combine all three data sets to obtainmarginalised 68 per cent confidence intervals of 0.30&lt;omega_m&lt;0.43,0.48&lt;h&lt;0.59, 0.69&lt;sigma_8&lt;0.79, and 1.01&lt;b_iras&lt;1.16. for the best fitparameters the cmb quadrupole is q_rms-ps=18.0 uk, gamma=0.15, omega_b=0.066and the age of the universe is 16.7 gyr.

astro-ph;9905186	estimating beta from redshift-space distortions in the 2df galaxy survey	given the failure of existing models for redshift-space distortions toprovide a highly accurate measure of the beta-parameter, and the ability offorthcoming surveys to obtain data with very low random errors, it becomesnecessary to develop better models for these distortions. here we review thefailures of the commonly-used velocity dispersion models and present anempirical method for extracting beta from the quadrupole statistic that haslittle systematic offset over a wide range of beta and cosmologies. thisempirical model is then applied to an ensemble of mock 2df southern stripsurveys, to illustrate the technique and see how accurately we can recover thetrue value of beta. we compare this treatment with the error we expect to finddue only to the finite volume of the survey. we find that non-linear effectsreduce the range of scales over which beta can be fitted, and introducecovariances between nearby modes in addition to those introduced by theconvolution with the survey window function. the result is that we are onlyable to constrain beta to a 1-sigma accuracy of 25% (beta=0.55 +/- 0.14 for thecosmological model considered). we explore one possible means of reducing thiserror, that of cluster collapse, and show that accurate application of thismethod can greatly reduce the effect of non-linearities, improving thedetermination of beta. we conclude by demonstrating that, when thecontaminating effects of clusters are dealt with, this simple analysis of thefull 2df survey yields beta=0.55 +/- 0.04. for this model this represents adetermination of beta to an accuracy of 8% and hence an important constraint onthe cosmological density parameter omega_0.

astro-ph;9910488	the dependence of velocity and clustering statistics on galaxy  properties	we use a combination of n-body simulations of the hierarchical clustering ofdark matter and semi-analytic modelling of the physics of galaxy formation toprobe the relationship between the galaxy distribution and the massdistribution. the pairwise line-of-sight velocity dispersion of galaxies issensitive to the number of galaxies present in halos of different mass. thegalaxy velocity dispersion is ~40% lower than that of the dark matter and is inreasonable agreement with the values measured in the las campanas redshiftsurvey by jing et al. over two decades in pair separation. the origin of thisoffset is statistical rather than dynamical, and depends upon the relativeefficiency of galaxy formation in dark matter halos of different mass. althoughthe model galaxies and the dark matter have markedly different correlationfunctions in real space, such biases conspire to cause the redshift spacecorrelation functions to be remarkably similar to each other. the predictedredshift-space galaxy correlation function agrees well with observations. wefind no evidence in the model for a dependence of clustering strength onintrinsic galaxy luminosity, unless extremely bright galaxies, two magnitudesbrighter than l*, are considered. however, there are significant differenceswhen model galaxies are selected either by morphology or by colour. early typeor red galaxies show a much stronger clustering amplitude than late type orblue galaxies, particularly on small scales, again in good agreement withobservations.
