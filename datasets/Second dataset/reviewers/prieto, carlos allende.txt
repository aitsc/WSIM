0903.1843	the runaway white dwarf lp400-22 has a companion	we report the detection of a radial velocity companion to the extremely lowmass white dwarf lp400-22. the radial velocity of the white dwarf showsvariations with a semi-amplitude of 119 km/s and a 0.98776 day period, whichimplies a companion mass of m &gt; 0.37 msun. the optical photometry rules out amain sequence companion. thus the invisible companion is another white dwarf ora neutron star. using proper motion measurements and the radial velocity of thebinary system, we find that it has an unusual galactic orbit. lp400-22 ismoving away from the galactic center with a velocity of 396 km/s, which is verydifficult to explain by supernova runaway ejection mechanisms. dynamicalinteractions with a massive black hole like that in the galactic center can inprinciple explain its peculiar velocity, if the progenitor was a triple starsystem comprised of a close binary and a distant tertiary companion. untilbetter proper motions become available, we consider lp400-22 to be most likelya halo star with a very unusual orbit.

0911.1781	the discovery of binary white dwarfs that will merge within 500 myr	we present radial velocity observations of four extremely low-mass (0.2 msol)white dwarfs. all four stars show peak-to-peak radial velocity variations of540 - 710 km/s with 1.0 - 5.9 hr periods. the optical photometry rules outmain-sequence companions. in addition, no milli-second pulsar companions aredetected in radio observations. thus the invisible companions are most likelywhite dwarfs. two of the systems are the shortest period binary white dwarfsyet discovered. due to the loss of angular momentum through gravitationalradiation, three of the systems will merge within 500 myr. the remaining systemwill merge within a hubble time. the mass functions for three of the systemsimply companions more massive than 0.46 msol; thus those are carbon/oxygen corewhite dwarfs. the unknown inclination angles prohibit a definitive conclusionabout the future of these systems. however, the chance of a supernova ia eventis only 1% to 5%. these systems are likely to form single r coronae borealisstars, providing evidence for a white dwarf + white dwarf merger mechanism forthese unusual objects. one of the systems, sdss j105353.89+520031.0 has a 70%chance of having a low-mass white dwarf companion. this system will probablyform a single helium-enriched subdwarf o star. all four white dwarf systemshave unusal mass ratios of &lt; 0.2-0.8 that may also lead to the formation of amcvn systems.

0707.2764	velocities from cross-correlation: a guide for self-improvement	the measurement of doppler velocity shifts in spectra is a ubiquitous themein astronomy, usually handled by computing the cross-correlation of thesignals, and finding the location of its maximum. this paper addresses theproblem of the determination of wavelength or velocity shifts among multiplespectra of the same, or very similar, objects. we implement the classicalcross-correlation method and experiment with several simple models to determinethe location of the maximum of the cross-correlation function. we propose a newtechnique, 'self-improvement', to refine the derived solutions by requiringthat the relative velocity for any given pair of spectra is consistent with allothers. by exploiting all available information, spectroscopic surveysinvolving large numbers of similar objects may improve their precisionsignificantly. as an example, we simulate the analysis of a survey of g-typestars with the sdss instrumentation. applying 'self-improvement' refinesrelative radial velocities by more than 50% at low signal-to-noise ratio. theconcept is equally applicable to the problem of combining a series ofspectroscopic observations of the same object, each with a different dopplervelocity or instrument-related offset, into a single spectrum with an enhancedsignal-to-noise ratio.

1001.1879	phases: a concept for a satellite-borne ultra-precise spectrophotometer	the planet hunting and asteroseismology explorer spectrophotometer, phases,is a concept for a space-borne instrument to obtain flux calibrated spectra andmeasure micro-magnitude photometric variations of nearby stars. the sciencedrivers are the determination of the physical properties of stars and thecharacterisation of planets orbiting them, to very high precision. phases,intended to be housed in a micro-satellite, consists of a 20 cm aperturemodified baker telescope feeding two detectors: the tracking detector, with afield of 1 degree square, and the science detector for performingspectrophotometry. the optical design has been developed with the primary goalof avoiding stray light on the science detector, while providing spectra in thewavelength range 370-960 nm with a resolving power that ranges from ~900 at 370nm to ~200 at 960 nm. the signal to noise per resolution element obtained for av=10 magnitude star in a 1 minute integration varies between ~ 35 and 140. ananalysis of the light curve constrains the radii of the planets relative totheir parent stars' radii, which are, in turn, tightly constrained by thecombination of absolute spectrophotometry and trigonometric parallaxes. theprovisional optical design satisfies all the scientific requirements, includinga ~1% rms flux calibration strategy based on observations of bright a-typestars and model atmospheres, allowing the determination of stellar angulardiameters for nearby solar-like stars to 0.5%. this level of accuracy will bepropagated to the stellar radii for the nearest stars, with highly reliablehipparcos parallaxes, and more significantly, to the planetary radii.

1010.5219	faint nuv/fuv standards from swift/uvot, galex and sdss photometry	at present, the precision of deep ultraviolet photometry is somewhat limitedby the dearth of faint ultraviolet standard stars. in an effort to improve thissituation, we present a uniform catalog of eleven new faint (u sim17)ultraviolet standard stars. high-precision photometry of these stars has beentaken from the sloan digital sky survey and galaxy evolution explorer andcombined with new data from the swift ultraviolet optical telescope to provideprecise photometric measures extending from the near infrared to the farultraviolet. these stars were chosen because they are known to be hot (20,000 &lt;t_eff &lt; 50,000 k) da white dwarfs with published sloan spectra that should bephotometrically stable. this careful selection allows us to compare thecombined photometry and sloan spectroscopy to models of pure hydrogenatmospheres to both constrain the underlying properties of the white dwarfs andtest the ability of white dwarf models to predict the photometric measures. wefind that the photometry provides good constraint on white dwarf temperatures,which demonstrates the ability of swift/uvot to investigate the properties ofhot luminous stars. we further find that the models reproduce the photometricmeasures in all eleven passbands to within their systematic uncertainties.within the limits of our photometry, we find the standard stars to bephotometrically stable. this success indicates that the models can be used tocalibrate additional filters to our standard system, permitting easiercomparison of photometry from heterogeneous sources. the largest source ofuncertainty in the model fitting is the uncertainty in the foreground reddeningcurve, a problem that is especially acute in the uv.

1103.6150	metallicity gradients of disc stars for a cosmologically simulated  galaxy	we analyse for the first time the radial abundance gradients of the discstars of a disc galaxy simulated with our three dimensional, fully cosmologicalchemodynamical galaxy evolution code gcd+. we study how [fe/h], [n/o], [o/fe],[mg/fe] and [si/fe] vary with galactocentric radius. for the young stars of thedisc, we found a negative slope for [fe/h] and [n/o] but a positive [o/fe],[mg/fe] and [si/fe] slope with radius. by analysing the star formation rate(sfr) at different radii, we found that the simulated disc contains a greaterfraction of young stars in the outer regions, while the old stars tend to beconcentrated in the inner parts of the disc. this can explain the positive[alpha/fe] gradient as well as the negative [n/o] gradient with radius. thisradial trend is a natural outcome of an inside-out formation of the disc,regardless of its size and can thus explain the recently observed positive[alpha/fe] gradients in the milky way disc open clusters.

1104.1424	insight into the formation of the milky way through cold halo  substructure. ii. the elemental abundances of echos	we determine the average metallicities of the elements of cold halosubstructure (echos) that we previously identified in the inner halo of themilky way within 17.5 kpc of the sun. as a population, we find that starskinematically associated with echos are chemically distinct from the backgroundkinematically smooth inner halo stellar population along the same sloanextension for galactic understanding and exploration (segue) line of sight.echos are systematically more iron-rich, but less alpha-enhanced than thekinematically-smooth component of the inner halo. echos are also chemicallydistinct from other milky way components: more iron-poor than typicalthick-disk stars and both more iron-poor and alpha-enhanced than typicalthin-disk stars. in addition, the radial velocity dispersion distribution ofechos extends beyond sigma ~ 20 km s^-1. globular clusters are unlikely echosprogenitors, as echos have large velocity dispersions and are found in a regionof the galaxy in which iron-rich globular clusters are very rare. likewise, thechemical composition of stars in echos do not match predictions for starsformed in the milky way and subsequently scattered into the inner halo. dwarfspheroidal (dsph) galaxies are possible echos progenitors, and if echos areformed through the tidal disruption of one or more dsph galaxies, the typicalechos [fe/h] ~ -1.0 and radial velocity dispersion sigma ~ 20 km s^-1 implies adsph with m_tot &gt;~ 10^9 m_sun. our observations confirm the predictions oftheoretical models of milky way halo formation that suggest that prominentsubstructures are likely to be metal-rich, and our result implies that the mostlikely metallicity for a recently accreted star currently in the inner halo is[fe/h] ~ -1.0.

1301.1367	very metal-poor stars in the outer galactic bulge found by the apogee  survey	despite its importance for understanding the nature of early stellargenerations and for constraining galactic bulge formation models, at presentlittle is known about the metal-poor stellar content of the central milky way.this is a consequence of the great distances involved and intervening dustobscuration, which challenge optical studies. however, the apache pointobservatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee), a wide-area, multifiber,high-resolution spectroscopic survey within sloan digital sky survey iii(sdss-iii), is exploring the chemistry of all galactic stellar populations atinfrared wavelengths, with particular emphasis on the disk and the bulge. anautomated spectral analysis of data on 2,403 giant stars in twelve fields inthe bulge obtained during apogee commissioning yielded five stars with lowmetallicity([fe/h]$\le-1.7$), including two that are very metal-poor[fe/h]$\sim-2.1$ by bulge standards.  luminosity-based distance estimates place the five stars within the outerbulge, where other 1,246 of the analyzed stars may reside. a manual reanalysisof the spectra verifies the low metallicities, and finds these stars to beenhanced in the $\alpha$-elements o, mg, and si without significant$\alpha$-pattern differences with other local halo or metal-weak thick-diskstars of similar metallicity, or even with other more metal-rich bulge stars.while neither the kinematics nor chemistry of these stars can yet definitivelydetermine which, if any, are truly bulge members, rather than denizens of otherpopulations co-located with the bulge, the newly-identified stars reveal thatthe chemistry of metal-poor stars in the central galaxy resembles that ofmetal-weak thick-disk stars at similar metallicity.

1303.7218	a pca approach to stellar effective temperatures	the derivation of the effective temperature of a star is a critical firststep in a detailed spectroscopic analysis. spectroscopic methods suffer fromsystematic errors related to model simplifications. photometric methods may bemore robust, but are exposed to the distortions caused by interstellarreddening. direct methods are difficult to apply, since fundamental data ofhigh accuracy are hard to obtain. we explore a new approach in which thespectrum is used to characterize a star's effective temperature based on acalibration established by a small set of standard stars. we perform principalcomponent analysis on homogeneous libraries of stellar spectra, then calibratea relationship between the principal components and the effective temperatureusing a set of stars with reliable effective temperatures. we find that ourprocedure gives excellent consistency when spectra from a homogeneous set ofobservations are used. systematic offsets may appear when combiningobservations from different sources. using as reference the spectra of starswith high-quality spectroscopic temperatures in the elodie library, we define atemperature scale for fg-type disk dwarfs with an internal consistency of about50 k, in excellent agreement with temperatures from direct determinations, butdistinct from widely used scales based on the infrared flux method.

1306.3157	a cautionary tale: marvels brown dwarf candidate reveals itself to be a  very long period, highly eccentric spectroscopic stellar binary	we report the discovery of a highly eccentric, double-lined spectroscopicbinary star system (tyc 3010-1494-1), comprising two solar-type stars that wehad initially identified as a single star with a brown dwarf companion. at themoderate resolving power of the marvels spectrograph and the spectrographs usedfor subsequent radial-velocity (rv) measurements (r ~ &lt;30,000), this particularstellar binary mimics a single-lined binary with an rv signal that would beinduced by a brown dwarf companion (msin(i)~50 m_jup) to a solar-type primary.at least three properties of this system allow it to masquerade as a singlestar with a very low-mass companion: its large eccentricity (e~0.8), itsrelatively long period (p~238 days), and the approximately perpendicularorientation of the semi-major axis with respect to the line of sight (omega~189degrees). as a result of these properties, for ~95% of the orbit the two setsof stellar spectral lines are completely blended, and the rv measurements basedon centroiding on the apparently single-lined spectrum is very well fit by anorbit solution indicative of a brown dwarf companion on a more circular orbit(e~0.3). only during the ~5% of the orbit near periastron passage does thetrue, double-lined nature and large rv amplitude of ~15 km/s reveal itself. thediscovery of this binary system is an important lesson for rv surveys searchingfor substellar companions; at a given resolution and observing cadence, asurvey will be susceptible to these kinds of astrophysical false positives fora range of orbital parameters. finally, for surveys like marvels that lack theresolution for a useful line bisector analysis, it is imperative to monitor thepeak of the cross-correlation function for suspicious changes in width orshape, so that such false positives can be flagged during the candidate vettingprocess.

0802.3701	the hobby-eberly telescope "chemical abundances of stars in the halo"  (cash) project. i. the lithium-, s-, and r-enhanced metal-poor giant hkii  17435-00532	we present the first detailed abundance analysis of the metal-poor giant hkii17435-00532. this star was observed as part of the university of texaslong-term project "chemical abundances of stars in the halo" (cash). a spectrumwas obtained with the high resolution spectrograph (hrs) on the hobby-eberlytelescope with a resolving power of r~15,000. our analysis reveals that thisstar may be located on the red giant branch, red horizontal branch, or earlyasymptotic giant branch. we find that this metal-poor ([fe/h]=-2.2) star has anunusually high lithium abundance (log eps (li)=+2.1), mild carbon ([c/fe]=+0.7)and sodium ([na/fe]=+0.6) enhancement, as well as enhancement of both s-process([ba/fe]=+0.8) and r-process ([eu/fe]=+0.5) material. the high li abundance canbe explained by self-enrichment through extra mixing that connects theconvective envelope with the outer regions of the h-burning shell. if so, hkii17435-00532 is the most metal-poor star in which this short-lived phase of lienrichment has been observed. the na and n-capture enrichment can be explainedby mass transfer from a companion that passed through the thermally-pulsing agbphase of evolution with only a small initial enrichment of r-process materialpresent in the birth cloud. despite the current non-detection of radialvelocity variations (over ~180 days), it is possible that hkii 17435-00532 isin a long-period or highly-inclined binary system, similar to other stars withsimilar n-capture enrichment patterns.

1405.1032	the apogee red-clump catalog: precise distances, velocities, and  high-resolution elemental abundances over a large area of the milky way's  disk	the sloan digital sky survey iii's apache point observatory galacticevolution experiment (apogee) is a high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopicsurvey covering all of the major components of the galaxy, including thedust-obscured regions of the inner milky way disk and bulge. here we present asample of 10,341 likely red-clump stars (rc) from the first two years of apogeeoperations, selected based on their position incolor-metallicity-surface-gravity-effective-temperature space using a newmethod calibrated using stellar-evolution models and high-qualityasteroseismology data. the narrowness of the rc locus incolor-metallicity-luminosity space allows us to assign distances to the starswith an accuracy of 5 to 10%. the sample extends to typical distances of about3 kpc from the sun, with some stars out to 8 kpc, and spans a volume ofapproximately 100 kpc^3 over 5 kpc &lt;~ r &lt;~ 14 kpc, |z| &lt;~ 2 kpc, and -15 deg &lt;~galactocentric azimuth &lt;~ 30 deg. the apogee red-clump (apogee-rc) catalogcontains photometry from 2mass, reddening estimates, distances, line-of-sightvelocities, stellar parameters and elemental abundances determined from thehigh-resolution apogee spectra, and matches to major proper motion catalogs. wedetermine the survey selection function for this data set and discuss how therc selection samples the underlying stellar populations. we use this sample tolimit any azimuthal variations in the median metallicity within the ~45degree-wide azimuthal region covered by the current sample to be &lt;= 0.02 dex,which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the radial metallicitygradient. this result constrains coherent non-axisymmetric flows within a fewkpc from the sun.

1405.6724	the vertical metallicity gradient of the milky way disk: transitions in  [a/fe] populations	using g dwarfs from the sloan extension for galactic understanding andexploration (segue) survey, we have determined a vertical metallicity gradientover a large volume of the milky way's disk, and examined how this gradientvaries for different [a/fe] subsamples. this sample contains over 40,000 starswith low-resolution spectroscopy over 144 lines of sight. we employ the seguestellar parameter pipeline (sspp) to obtain estimates of effective temperature,surface gravity, [fe/h], and [a/fe] for each star and extract multiplevolume-complete subsamples of approximately 1000 stars each. based on thesurvey's consistent target-selection algorithm, we adjust each subsample todetermine an unbiased picture of the disk in [fe/h] and [a/fe]; consequently,each individual star represents the properties of many. the segue sample allowsus to constrain the vertical metallicity gradient for a large number of starsover a significant volume of the disk, between ~0.3 and 1.6 kpc from thegalactic plane, and examine the in situ structure, in contrast to previousanalyses which are more limited in scope. this work does not pre-suppose a diskstructure, whether composed of a single complex population or a distinct thinand thick disk component. the metallicity gradient is -0.243 +0.039 -0.053dex/kpc for the sample as a whole, which we compare to various literatureresults. each [a/fe] subsample dominates at a different range of heights abovethe plane of the galaxy, which is exhibited in the gradient found in the sampleas a whole. stars over a limited range in [a/fe] show little change in median[fe/h] with height. if we associate [a/fe] with age, our consistent verticalmetallicity gradients with [a/fe] suggest that stars formed in different epochsexhibit comparable vertical structure, implying similar star-formationprocesses and evolution.

1406.3346	a new gravitational wave verification source	we report the discovery of a detached 20 min orbital period binary whitedwarf. wd0931+444 (sdss j093506.93+441106.9) was previously classified as a wd+ m dwarf system based on its optical spectrum. our time-resolved opticalspectroscopy observations obtained at the 8m gemini and 6.5m mmt revealpeak-to-peak radial velocity variations of 400 km/s every 20 min for the wd,but no velocity variations for the m dwarf. in addition, high-speed photometryfrom the mcdonald 2.1m telescope shows no evidence of variability nor evidenceof a reflection effect. an m dwarf companion is physically too large to fitinto a 20 min orbit. thus, the orbital motion of the wd is almost certainly dueto an invisible wd companion. the m dwarf must be either an unrelatedbackground object or the tertiary component of a hiearchical triple system.wd0931+444 contains a pair of wds, a 0.32 msol primary and a &gt;0.14 msolsecondary, at a separation of &gt;0.19 rsol. after j0651+2844, wd0931+444 becomesthe second-shortest period detached binary wd currently known. the two wds willlose angular momentum through gravitational wave radiation and merge in &lt;9 myr.the log h ~ -22 gravitational wave strain from wd0931+444 is strong enough tomake it a verification source for gravitational wave missions in themilli-hertz frequency range, e.g. the evolved laser interferometer spaceantenna (elisa), bringing the total number of known elisa verification sourcesto nine.

1409.3566	tracing chemical evolution over the extent of the milky way's disk with  apogee red clump stars	we employ the first two years of data from the near-infrared, high-resolutionsdss-iii/apogee spectroscopic survey to investigate the distribution ofmetallicity and alpha-element abundances of stars over a large part of themilky way disk. using a sample of ~10,000 kinematically-unbiased red-clumpstars with ~5% distance accuracy as tracers, the [alpha/fe] vs. [fe/h]distribution of this sample exhibits a bimodality in [alpha/fe] at intermediatemetallicities, -0.9&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.2, but at higher metallicities ([fe/h]=+0.2) thetwo sequences smoothly merge. we investigate the effects of the apogeeselection function and volume filling fraction and find that these have littlequalitative impact on the alpha-element abundance patterns. the describedabundance pattern is found throughout the range 5&lt;r&lt;11 kpc and 0&lt;|z|&lt;2 kpcacross the galaxy. the [alpha/fe] trend of the high-alpha sequence issurprisingly constant throughout the galaxy, with little variation from regionto region (~10%). using simple galactic chemical evolution models we derive anaverage star formation efficiency (sfe) in the high-alpha sequence of ~4.5e-101/yr, which is quite close to the nearly-constant value found inmolecular-gas-dominated regions of nearby spirals. this result suggests thatthe early evolution of the milky way disk was characterized by stars thatshared a similar star formation history and were formed in a well-mixed,turbulent, and molecular-dominated ism with a gas consumption timescale (1/sfe)of ~2 gyr. finally, while the two alpha-element sequences in the inner galaxycan be explained by a single chemical evolutionary track this cannot hold inthe outer galaxy, requiring instead a mix of two or more populations withdistinct enrichment histories.

1410.1350	bayesian distances and extinctions for giants observed by kepler and  apogee	we present a first determination of distances and extinctions for individualstars in the first release of the apokasc catalogue, built from the jointefforts of the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee)and the kepler asteroseismic science consortium (kasc). our method takes intoaccount the spectroscopic constraints derived from the apogee stellarparameters and chemical abundances pipeline, together with the asteroseismicparameters from kasc. these parameters are then employed to estimate intrinsicstellar properties, including absolute magnitudes, using the bayesian toolparam. we then find the distance and extinction that best fit the observedphotometry in sdss, 2mass, and wise passbands. the first 1989 giants targetedby apokasc are found at typical distances between 0.5 and 5 kpc, withindividual uncertainties of just ~1.8 per cent. our extinction estimates aresystematically smaller than provided in the kepler input catalogue and by theschlegel, finkbeiner and davis maps. distances to individual stars in the ngc6791 and ngc 6819 star clusters agree to within their credible intervals.comparison with the apogee red clump and saga catalogues provide another usefulcheck, exhibiting agreement with our measurements to within a few percent.overall, present methods seem to provide excellent distance and extinctiondeterminations for the bulk of the apokasc sample. approximately one third ofthe stars present broad or multiple-peaked probability density functions andhence increased uncertainties. uncertainties are expected to be reduced infuture releases of the catalogue, when a larger fraction of the stars will haveseismically-determined evolutionary status classifications.

1410.2503	the apokasc catalog: an asteroseismic and spectroscopic joint survey of  targets in the kepler fields	we present the first apokasc catalog of spectroscopic and asteroseismicproperties of 1916 red giants observed in the kepler fields. the spectroscopicparameters provided from the apache point observatory galactic evolutionexperiment project are complemented with asteroseismic surface gravities,masses, radii, and mean densities determined by members of the keplerasteroseismology science consortium. we assess both random and systematicsources of error and include a discussion of sample selection for giants in thekepler fields. total uncertainties in the main catalog properties are of order80 k in teff , 0.06 dex in [m/h], 0.014 dex in log g, and 12% and 5% in massand radius, respectively; these reflect a combination of systematic and randomerrors. asteroseismic surface gravities are substantially more precise andaccurate than spectroscopic ones, and we find good agreement between their meanvalues and the calibrated spectroscopic surface gravities. there are, however,systematic underlying trends with teff and log g. our effective temperaturescale is between 0-200 k cooler than that expected from the infrared fluxmethod, depending on the adopted extinction map, which provides evidence for alower value on average than that inferred for the kepler input catalog (kic).we find a reasonable correspondence between the photometric kic andspectroscopic apokasc metallicity scales, with increased dispersion in kicmetallicities as the absolute metal abundance decreases, and offsets in teffand log g consistent with those derived in the literature. we present meanfitting relations between apokasc and kic observables and discuss futureprospects, strengths, and limitations of the catalog data.

1501.05127	exploring anticorrelations and light element variations in northern  globular clusters observed by the apogee survey	we investigate the light-element behavior of red giant stars in northernglobular clusters (gcs) observed by the sdss-iii apache point observatorygalactic evolution experiment (apogee). we derive abundances of nine elements(fe, c, n, o, mg, al, si, ca, and ti) for 428 red giant stars in 10 globularclusters. the intrinsic abundance range relative to measurement errors isexamined, and the well-known c-n and mg-al anticorrelations are explored usingan extreme-deconvolution code for the first time in a consistent way. we findthat mg and al drive the population membership in most clusters, except in m107and m71, the two most metal-rich clusters in our study, where the grouping ismost sensitive to n. we also find a diversity in the abundance distributions,with some clusters exhibiting clear abundance bimodalities (for example m3 andm53) while others show extended distributions. the spread of al abundancesincreases significantly as cluster average metallicity decreases as previouslyfound by other works, which we take as evidence that low metallicity,intermediate mass agb polluters were more common in the more metal poorclusters. the statistically significant correlation of [al/fe] with [si/fe] inm15 suggests that $^{28}$si leakage has occurred in this cluster. we alsopresent c, n and o abundances for stars cooler than 4500 k and examine thebehavior of a(c+n+o) in each cluster as a function of temperature and [al/fe].the scatter of a(c+n+o) is close to its estimated uncertainty in all clustersand independent on stellar temperature. a(c+n+o) exhibits small correlationsand anticorrelations with [al/fe] in m3 and m13, but we cannot be certain aboutthese relations given the size of our abundance uncertainties. star-to-starvariations of $\alpha-$elements (si, ca, ti) abundances are comparable to ourestimated errors in all clusters.

1502.05035	the apogee spectroscopic survey of kepler planet hosts: feasibility,  efficiency, and first results	the kepler mission has yielded a large number of planet candidates from amongthe kepler objects of interest (kois), but spectroscopic follow-up of theserelatively faint stars is a serious bottleneck in confirming and characterizingthese systems. we present motivation and survey design for an ongoing projectwith the sdss-iii multiplexed apogee near-infrared spectrograph to monitorhundreds of koi host stars. we report some of our first results usingrepresentative targets from our sample, which include current planet candidatesthat we find to be false positives, as well as candidates listed as falsepositives that we do not find to be spectroscopic binaries. with this survey,koi hosts are observed over ~20 epochs at a radial velocity precision of100-200 m/s. these observations can easily identify a majority of falsepositives caused by physically-associated stellar or substellar binaries, andin many cases, fully characterize their orbits. we demonstrate that apogee iscapable of achieving rv precision at the 100-200 m/s level over long timebaselines, and that apogee's multiplexing capability makes it substantiallymore efficient at identifying false positives due to binaries than othersingle-object spectrographs working to confirm kois as planets. these apogeervs enable ancillary science projects, such as studies of fundamental stellarastrophysics or intrinsically rare substellar companions. the coadded apogeespectra can be used to derive stellar properties (t_eff, log(g)) and chemicalabundances of over a dozen elements to probe correlations of planet propertieswith individual elemental abundances.

1510.07635	aspcap: the apogee stellar parameter and chemical abundances pipeline	the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee) has builtthe largest moderately high-resolution (r=22, 500) spectroscopic map of thestars across the milky way, and including dust-obscured areas. the apogeestellar parameter and chemical abundances pipeline (aspcap) is the softwaredeveloped for the automated analysis of these spectra. aspcap determinesatmospheric parameters and chemical abundances from observed spectra bycomparing observed spectra to libraries of theoretical spectra, using chi-2minimization in a multidimensional parameter space. the package consists of afortran90 code that does the actual minimization, and a wrapper idl code forbook-keeping and data handling. this paper explains in detail the aspcapcomponents and functionality, and presents results from a number of testsdesigned to check its performance. aspcap provides stellar effectivetemperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities precise to 2%, 0.1 dex, and0.05 dex, respectively, for most apogee stars, which are predominantly giants.it also provides abundances for up to 15 chemical elements with various levelsof precision, typically under 0.1 dex. the final data release (dr12) of thesloan digital sky survey iii contains an apogee database of more than 150,000stars. aspcap development continues in the sdss-iv apogee-2 survey.

0808.0001	galactic globular and open clusters in the sloan digital sky survey. i.  crowded field photometry and cluster fiducial sequences in ugriz	we present photometry for globular and open cluster stars observed with thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). in order to exploit over 100 million stellarobjects with r &lt; 22.5 mag observed by sdss, we need to understand thecharacteristics of stars in the sdss ugriz filters. while star clusters provideimportant calibration samples for stellar colors, the regions close to globularclusters, where the fraction of field stars is smallest, are too crowded forthe standard sdss photometric pipeline to process. to complement the sdssimaging survey, we reduce the sdss imaging data for crowded cluster fieldsusing the daophot/allframe suite of programs and present photometry for 17globular clusters and 3 open clusters in a sdss value-added catalog. ourphotometry and cluster fiducial sequences are on the native sdss 2.5-meterugriz photometric system, and the fiducial sequences can be directly applied tothe sdss photometry without relying upon any transformations. model photometryfor red giant branch and main-sequence stars obtained by girardi et al. cannotbe matched simultaneously to fiducial sequences; their colors differ by~0.02-0.05 mag. good agreement (&lt; ~0.02 mag in colors) is found with clem etal. empirical fiducial sequences in u'g'r'i'z' when using the transformationequations in tucker et al.

astro-ph;0001508	the near-ultraviolet continuum of late-type stars	analyses of the near-ultraviolet continuum of late-type stars have led tocontroversial results regarding the performance of state-of-the-art modelatmospheres. the release of the homogeneous iue final archive and theavailability of the high-accuracy hipparcos parallaxes provide an opportunityto revisit this issue, as accurate stellar distances make it possible tocompare observed absolute fluxes with the predictions of model atmospheres.  the near-uv continuum is highly sensitive to teff and [fe/h], and once thegravity is constrained from the parallax, these parameters may be derived fromthe analysis of low-dispersion "long-wavelength" (2000-3000 a) iue spectra forstars previously studied by alonso et al. (1996; a&amp;as 117, 227) using theinfrared flux method (irfm). a second comparison is carried out against thestars spectroscopically investigated by gratton et al. (1996; a&amp;a 314, 191). itis shown that there is a good agreement between teffs obtained from the irfmand from the near-uv continuum, and a remarkable correspondence betweenobserved and synthetic fluxes for stars with 4000 &lt;= teff &lt;= 6000 k of anymetallicity and gravity. these facts suggest that model atmospheres provide anadequate description of the near-uv continuum forming region and that theopacities involved are essentially understood. for cooler stars, the results ofthe irfm are no longer reliable, as shown by alonso et al., but the discrepancynoticed for stars hotter than 6000 k may reflect problems in the modelatmospheres and/or the opacities at these higher temperatures.

astro-ph;0105262	chemical abundances from inversions of stellar spectra: analysis of  solar-type stars with homogeneous and static model atmospheres	spectra of late-type stars are usually analyzed with static model atmospheresin local thermodynamic equilibrium (lte) and a homogeneous plane-parallel orspherically symmetric geometry. the energy balance requires particularattention, as two elements which are particularly difficult to model play animportant role: line blanketing and convection. inversion techniques are ableto bypass the difficulties of a detailed description of the energy balance.assuming that the atmosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium and lte, it ispossible to constrain its structure from spectroscopic observations. among themost serious approximations still implicit in the method is a static andhomogeneous geometry. in this paper, we take advantage of a realisticthree-dimensional radiative hydrodynamical simulation of the solar surface tocheck the systematic errors incurred by an inversion assuming a plane-parallelhorizontally-homogeneous atmosphere. the thermal structure recovered resemblesthe spatial and time average of the three-dimensional atmosphere. furthermore,the abundances retrieved are typically within 10% (0.04 dex) of the abundancesused to construct the simulation. the application to a fairly complete datasetfrom the solar spectrum provides further confidence in previous analyses of thesolar composition. there is only a narrow range of one-dimensional thermalstructures able to fit the absorption lines in the spectrum of the sun. withour carefully selected dataset, random errors are about a factor of two smallerthan systematic errors. a small number of strong metal lines can provide veryreliable results. we foresee no major difficulty in applying the technique toother similar stars, and obtaining similar accuracies, using spectra with aresolving power about 50,000 and a signal-to-noise ratio as low as 30.

astro-ph;0106360	the 'forbidden' abundance of oxygen in the sun	we reexamine closely the solar photospheric line at 6300 a, which isattributed to a forbidden line of neutral oxygen, and is widely used inanalyses of other late-type stars.  we use a three-dimensional time-dependent hydrodynamical model solaratmosphere which has been tested successfully against observed granulationpatterns and an array of absorption lines. we show that the solar line is ablend with a ni i line, as previously suggested but oftentimes neglected.thanks to accurate atomic data on the [o i] and ni i lines we are able toderive an accurate oxygen abundance for the sun: log epsilon (o) = 8.69 +/-0.05 dex, a value at the lower end of the distribution of previously publishedabundances, but in good agreement with estimates for the local interstellarmedium and hot stars in the solar neighborhood. we conclude by discussing theimplication of the ni i blend on oxygen abundances derived from the [o i] 6300a line in disk and halo stars.

astro-ph;0208185	automated stellar spectral classification and parameterization for the  masses	stellar spectroscopic classification has been successfully automated by anumber of groups. automated classification and parameterization work best whenapplied to a homogeneous data set, and thus these techniques primarily havebeen developed for and applied to large surveys. while most ongoing largespectroscopic surveys target extragalactic objects, many stellar spectra havebeen and will be obtained. we briefly summarize past work on automatedclassification and parameterization, with emphasis on the work done in ourgroup. accurate automated classification in the spectral type domain andparameterization in the temperature domain have been relatively easy. automatedparameterization in the metallicity domain, formally outside the mk system, hasalso been effective. due to the subtle effects on the spectrum, automatedclassification in the luminosity domain has been somewhat more difficult, butstill successful. in order to extend the use of automated techniques beyond afew surveys, we present our current efforts at building a web-based automatedstellar spectroscopic classification and parameterization machine. our proposedmachinery would provide users with mk classifications as well as theastrophysical parameters of effective temperature, surface gravity, meanabundance, abundance anomalies, and microturbulence.

[x/fe] is very similar for the thin and thick disc for -- notably -- na,and iron-group elements.

astro-ph;0501213	a study of the near-ultraviolet spectrum of vega	uv, optical, and near-ir spectra of vega have been combined to test ourunderstanding of stellar atmospheric opacities, and to examine the possibilityof constraining chemical abundances from low-resolution uv fluxes. we havecarried out a detailed analysis assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (lte)to identify the most important contributors to the uv continuous opacity: h,h$^{-}$, c i, and si ii. our analysis also assumes that vega is sphericallysymmetric and its atmosphere is well described with the plane parallelapproximation. comparing observations and computed fluxes we have been able todiscriminate between two different flux scales that have been proposed, theiue-ines and the hst scales, favoring the latter. the effective temperature andangular diameter derived from the analysis of observed optical and near-uvspectra are in very good agreement with previous determinations based ondifferent techniques. the silicon abundance is poorly constrained by the uvobservations of the continuum and strong lines, but the situation is morefavorable for carbon and the abundances inferred from the uv continuum andoptical absorption lines are in good agreement. some spectral intervals in theuv spectrum of vega that the calculations do not reproduce well are likelyaffected by deviations from lte, but we conclude that our understanding of uvatmospheric opacities is fairly complete for early a-type stars.

astro-ph;0512505	elemental abundance survey of the galactic thick disk	[abridged abstract] we have performed an abundance analysis for 176 f- and g-dwarfs of the galactic thick disk component. using accurate radial velocitiescombined with $hipparcos$ astrometry, kinematics (u, v, and w) and galacticorbital parameters were computed. we estimate the probability for a star tobelong to the thin disk, the thick disk or the halo.  abundances of c, o, na, mg, al, si, ca, sc, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu,zn, y, ba, ce, nd, and eu have been obtained. the abundances for thick diskstars are compared with those for thin disk members from reddy et al. (2003).the ratios of $\alpha$-elements (o, mg, si, ca and ti) to iron for thick diskdisk stars show a clear enhancement compared to thin disk members in the range$-0.3 &lt;$ [fe/h] $ &lt; -1.2$. there are also other elements -- al, sc, v, co, andpossibly zn -- which show enhanced ratios to iron in the thick disk relative tothe thin disk. the abundances of na, cr, mn, ni, and cu (relative to fe) arevery similar for thin and thick disk stars. the dispersion in abundance ratios[x/fe] at given [fe/h] for thick disk stars is consistent with the expectedscatter due to measurement errors, suggesting a lack of `cosmic' scatter. theobserved compositions of the thin and thick disks seem to be consistent withmodels of galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering in a $\lambda$cdmuniverse. in particular, the distinct abundance patterns observed in the thinand thick disks, and the chemical homogeneity of the thick disk at differentgalactocentric distances favor a scenario in which the majority of thick-diskstars were formed {\it in situ}, from gas rich merging blocks.

astro-ph;0702429	the abundances of oxygen and carbon in the solar photosphere	a series of recent studies has placed the best estimates of the photosphericabundances of carbon and oxygen at log epsilon = 8.39 and 8.66, respectively.these values are ~ 40 % lower than earlier estimates. a coalition ofcorrections due to the adoption of an improved model atmosphere, updated atomicdata and non-lte corrections, and a reevaluation of the effect of blendingfeatures, is responsible for the change. the adopted hydrodynamical model ofthe solar surface is an important element to the update, but using atheoretical 1d model atmosphere leads to an average oxygen abundance modestlyincreased by 0.09 dex, and a carbon abundance only 0.02 dex higher. consideringa state-of-the-art 3d hydrodynamical model of the solar surface yieldsconsistent results from different sets of atomic and molecular lines.systematic errors are likely to dominate the final uncertainties, but theavailable information indicates they are limited to &lt;0.1 dex. the newabundances are closer to expectations based on the compositions of other nearbyobjects, although a fully consistent picture, considering galactic chemicalevolution and diffusion at the bottom of the solar convection zone, is stilllacking.

astro-ph;9907046	spectroscopic observations of convective patterns in the atmospheres of  metal-poor stars	convective line asymmetries in the optical spectrum of two metal-poor stars,gmb1830 and hd140283, are compared to those observed for solar metallicitystars. the line bisectors of the most metal-poor star, the subgiant hd140283,show a significantly larger velocity span that the expectations for asolar-metallicity star of the same spectral type and luminosity class. theenhanced line asymmetries are interpreted as the signature of the lower metalcontent, and therefore opacity, in the convective photospheric patterns. thesefindings point out the importance of three-dimensional convective velocityfields in the interpretation of the observed line asymmetries in metal-poorstars, and in particular, urge for caution when deriving isotopic ratios fromobserved line shapes and shifts using one-dimensional model atmospheres.  the mean line bisector of the photospheric atomic lines is compared withthose measured for the strong mg i b1 and b2 features. the upper part of thebisectors are similar, and assuming they overlap, the bottom end of thestronger lines, which are formed higher in the atmosphere, goes much further tothe red. this is in agreement with the expected decreasing of the convectiveblue-shifts in upper atmospheric layers, and compatible with the high velocityredshifts observed in the chromosphere, transition region, and corona oflate-type stars.

astro-ph;9907155	a consistency test of spectroscopic gravities for late-type stars	chemical analyses of late-type stars are usually carried out following theclassical recipe: lte line formation and homogeneous, plane-parallel,flux-constant, and lte model atmospheres. we review different results in theliterature that have suggested significant inconsistencies in the spectroscopicanalyses, pointing out the difficulties in deriving independent estimates ofthe stellar fundamental parameters and hence,detecting systematic errors.  the trigonometric parallaxes measured by the hipparcos mission provideaccurate appraisals of the stellar surface gravity for nearby stars, which areused here to check the gravities obtained from the photospheric iron ionizationbalance. we find an approximate agreement for stars in the metallicity range -1&lt;= [fe/h] &lt;= 0, but the comparison shows that the differences between thespectroscopic and trigonometric gravities decrease towards lower metallicitiesfor more metal-deficient dwarfs (-2.5 &lt;= [fe/h] &lt;= -1.0), which casts a shadowupon the abundance analyses for extreme metal-poor stars that make use of theionization equilibrium to constrain the gravity. the comparison with thestrong-line gravities derived by edvardsson (1988) and fuhrmann (1998a)confirms that this method provides systematically larger gravities than theionization balance. the strong-line gravities get closer to the physical onesfor the stars analyzed by fuhrmann, but they are even further away than theiron ionization gravities for the stars of lower gravities in edvardsson'ssample. the confrontation of the deviations of the iron ionization gravities inmetal-poor stars reported here with departures from the excitation balancefound in the literature, show that they are likely to be induced by the samephysical mechanism(s).

astro-ph;9911002	fundamental parameters of nearby stars from the comparison with  evolutionary calculations: masses, radii and effective temperatures	the hipparcos mission has made it possible to constrain the positions ofnearby field stars in the colour-magnitude diagram with very high accuracy.these positions can be compared with the predictions of stellar evolutionarycalculations to provide information on the basic parameters of the stars:masses, radii, effective temperatures, ages, and chemical composition.  the degeneracy between mass, age, and metallicity is not so large as toprevent a reliable estimate of masses, radii and effective temperatures, atleast for stars of solar metallicity. the evolutionary models of bertelli etal. (1994) predict those parameters finely, and furthermore, the appliedtransformation from the theoretical (log g-teff) to the observational (mv-b-v)plane is precise enough to derive radii with an uncertainty of ~ 6%, masseswithin ~ 8%, and teffs within ~ 2% for a certain range of the stellarparameters. this is demonstrated by means of comparison with the measurementsin eclipsing binaries and the infrared flux method.  the application of the interpolation procedure in the theoretical isochronesto the stars within 100 pc from the sun observed with hipparcos providesestimates for 17,219 stars
