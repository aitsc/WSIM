0908.1719	physical structure and water line spectrum predictions of the  intermediate mass protostar omc2-fir4	aims. intermediate mass (im) stars are an important component of our galaxy,as they significantly contribute to the interstellar fuv field and,consequently, play an important role in the energy balance of the ism. despitetheir importance, very little is known about their formation process and only afew studies have been devoted to characterize the first phases in the evolutionof intermediate mass protostars. here we consider in great detail the case ofthe brightest and closest known young im protostar: fir4 in the omc2 componentof the orion molecular cloud complex. methods. we analyzed the availablecontinuum emission (maps and sed) through one-dimensional dust radiativetransfer calculations. we ran large grids of models to find the envelope modelthat best fits the data. the derived dust density and temperature profiles havebeen then used to compute the gas temperature profile, equating gas cooling andheating terms across the envelope. last, we computed the water line spectrumfor various possible values of water abundance. results. the luminosity of fir4has been reevaluated to 1000 lo, making fir4 definitively an intermediate massprotostar. the envelope surrounding fir4 has a relatively shallow density powerlaw index, ~ 0.6. the most surprising result is that the gas and dust arethermally decoupled in the interior of the envelope, where the dust icessublimate at 100 k. this has important consequences in the interpretation ofthe line data. we provide the predictions for the water spectrum, and discussin detail the lines which will be observed by the herschel space observatory .

0909.2267	dissecting an intermediate-mass (im) protostar: chemical differentiation  in ic1396n	we have carried out high-angular resolution (1.4") observations in thecontinuum at 3.1mm and in the n2h+ 1-0, ch3cn 5_k-4_k and 13cs 2-1 lines usingthe plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi) towards the intermediate mass (im)protostar iras21391+5802 (ic1396n). in addition, we have merged the pdbi imageswith previous bima (continuum data at 1.2mm and 3.1mm) and single-dish (n2h+1-0) data to have a comprehensive description of the region. the combination ofour data with bima and 30m data show that the bipolar outflow associated hascompletely eroded the initial molecular globule. the 1.2mm and 3.1mm continuumemissions are extended along the outflow axis tracing the warm walls of thebiconical cavity. most of the molecular gas, however, is located in anelongated feature in the direction perpendicular to the outflow. a strongchemical differentiation is detected across the molecular toroid, with the n2h+1-0 emission absent in the inner region.this chemical differentiation can beunderstood in terms of the different gas kinetic temperature. the[ch3cn]/[n2h+] ratio increases by 5 orders of magnitude with gas temperature,for temperatures between 20k and 100k. the ch3cn abundance towards iram 2a, themost massive protostellar core, is similar to that found in hot corinos andlower than that expected towards im and high mass hot cores. this couldindicate that iram 2a is a low mass or at most herbig ae star (iram 2a) insteadof the precursor of a massive be star. alternatively, the low ch3cn abundancecould also be the consequence of iram 2a being a class 0/i transition objectwhich has already formed a small photodissociation region (pdr).

0708.0345	quasi-classical rate coefficient calculations for the rotational  (de)excitation of h2o by h2	the interpretation of water line emission from existing observations andfuture hifi/herschel data requires a detailed knowledge of collisional ratecoefficients. among all relevant collisional mechanisms, the rotational(de)excitation of h2o by h2 molecules is the process of most interest ininterstellar space. to determine rate coefficients for rotational de-excitationamong the lowest 45 para and 45 ortho rotational levels of h2o colliding withboth para and ortho-h2 in the temperature range 20-2000 k. rate coefficientsare calculated on a recent high-accuracy h2o-h2 potential energy surface usingquasi-classical trajectory calculations. trajectories are sampled by acanonical monte-carlo procedure. h2 molecules are assumed to be rotationallythermalized at the kinetic temperature. by comparison with quantum calculationsavailable for low lying levels, classical rates are found to be accurate withina factor of 1-3 for the dominant transitions, that is those with rates largerthan a few 10^{-12}cm^{3}s^{-1}. large velocity gradient modelling shows thatthe new rates have a significant impact on emission line fluxes and that theyshould be adopted in any detailed population model of water in warm and hotenvironments.

1004.2822	chemical study of intermediate-mass (im) class 0 protostars. co  depletion and n2h+ deuteration	we are carrying out a physical and chemical study of the protostellarenvelopes in a representative sample of im class 0 protostars. in our firstpaper (crimier et al. 2010), we determined the physical structure(density-temperature radial profiles) of the protostellar envelopes. here, westudy the co depletion and n2h+ deuteration. we observed the millimeter linesof c18o, c17o, n2h+ and n2d+ toward the protostars using the iram 30mtelescope. based on these observations, we derived the c18o, n2h+ and n2d+radial abundance profiles across their envelopes using a radiative transfercode. in addition, we modeled the chemistry of the protostellar envelopes. allthe c18o 1-0 maps are well fit assuming that the c18o abundance decreasesinwards within the protostellar envelope until the gas and dust reach the coevaporation temperature, 20-25k, where the co is released back to the gasphase. the n2h+ deuterium fractionation in class 0 ims is[n2d+]/[n2h+]=0.005-0.014, two orders of magnitude higher than the elemental[d/h] value in the interstellar medium, but a factor of 10 lower than inpre-stellar clumps. chemical models account for the c18o and n2h+ observationsif we assume the co abundance is 2 times lower than the canonical value in theinner envelope. this could be the consequence of the co being converted intoch3oh on the grain surfaces prior to the evaporation and/or thephotodissociation of co by the stellar uv radiation. the deuteriumfractionation is not fitted by chemical models. this discrepancy is very likelycaused by the simplicity of our model that assumes spherical geometry andneglects important phenomena like the effect of bipolar outflows and uvradiation from the star. more important, the deuterium fractionation isdependent on the ortho-to-para h2 ratio, which is not likely to reach thesteady-state value in the dynamical time scales of these protostars.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

(2010). here we report on the identification oflines from nh3, h2co, ch3oh, cs, hcn, and hco+. the comparison between theprofiles produced by molecules released from dust mantles (nh3, h2co, ch3oh)and that of h2o is consistent with a scenario in which water is also formed inthe gas-phase in high-temperature regions where sputtering or grain-graincollisions are not efficient. the high excitation range of the observed tracersallows us to infer, for the first time for these species, the existence of awarm (&gt; 200 k) gas component coexisting in the b1 bow structure with the coldand hot gas detected from ground.

1007.1539	herschel/hifi observations of spectrally resolved methylidyne signatures  toward the high-mass star-forming core ngc6334i	in contrast to extensively studied dense star-forming cores, little is knownabout diffuse gas surrounding star-forming regions. we study molecular gas inthe high-mass star-forming region ngc6334i, which contains diffuse, quiescentcomponents that are inconspicuous in widely used molecular tracers such as co.we present herschel/hifi observations of ch toward ngc6334i observed as part ofthe chess key program. hifi resolves the hyperfine components of its j=3/2-1/2transition, observed in both emission and absorption. the ch emission appearsclose to the systemic velocity of ngc6334i, while its measured linewidth of 3km/s is smaller than previously observed in dense gas tracers such as nh3 andsio. the ch abundance in the hot core is 7 10^-11, two to three orders ofmagnitude lower than in diffuse clouds. while other studies find distinctoutflows in, e.g., co and h2o toward ngc6334i, we do not detect outflowsignatures in ch. to explain the absorption signatures, at least two absorbingcomponents are needed at -3.0 and +6.5 km/s with n(ch)=7 10^13 and 3 10^13cm^-2. two additional absorbing clouds are found at +8.0 and 0.0 km/s, bothwith n(ch)=2 10^13 cm^-2. turbulent linewidths for the four absorptioncomponents vary between 1.5 and 5.0 km/s in fwhm. we constrain physicalproperties of our ch clouds by matching our ch absorbers with other absorptionsignatures. in the hot core, molecules such as h2o and co trace gas that isheated and dynamically influenced by outflow activity, whereas ch traces morequiescent material. the four ch absorbers have column densities and turbulentproperties consistent with diffuse clouds: two are located near ngc6334, andtwo are unrelated foreground clouds. local density and dynamical effectsinfluence the chemical composition of physical components of ngc6334, causingsome components to be seen in ch but not in other tracers, and vice versa.

1007.5131	reversal of infall in sgrb2(m) revealed by herschel/hifi observations of  hcn lines at thz frequencies	to investigate the accretion and feedback processes in massive starformation, we analyze the shapes of emission lines from hot molecular cores,whose asymmetries trace infall and expansion motions. the high-mass starforming region sgrb2(m) was observed with herschel/hifi (hexos key project) invarious lines of hcn and its isotopologues, complemented by apex data. theobservations are compared to spherically symmetric, centrally heated modelswith density power-law gradient and different velocity fields (infall orinfall+expansion), using the radiative transfer code ratran. the hcn lineprofiles are asymmetric, with the emission peak shifting from blue to red withincreasing j and decreasing line opacity (hcn to h$^{13}$cn). this is mostevident in the hcn 12--11 line at 1062 ghz. these line shapes are reproduced bya model whose velocity field changes from infall in the outer part to expansionin the inner part. the qualitative reproduction of the hcn lines suggests thatinfall dominates in the colder, outer regions, but expansion dominates in thewarmer, inner regions. we are thus witnessing the onset of feedback in massivestar formation, starting to reverse the infall and finally disrupting the wholemolecular cloud. to obtain our result, the thz lines uniquely covered by hifiwere critically important.

1101.2327	shocked water in the cep e protostellar outflow	previous far-infrared observations at low-angular resolution have reportedthe presence of water associated with low-velocity outflow shocks andprotostellar envelopes. the outflow driven by the intermediate-mass class 0protostar cep e is among the most luminous outflows detected so far. using theiram 30m telescope, we searched for and detected the para-water line emissionat 183 ghz in the cep e star-forming core. the emission arises fromhigh-velocity gas close to the protostar, which is unresolved in the main beamof the telescope. complementary observations at 2" resolution with the plateaude bure interferometer helped establish the origin of the emission detected andthe physical conditions in the emitting gas. the water line profile and itsspatial distribution are very similar to those of sio. we find that the wateremission arises from warm ($\sim 200\k$), dense ($(1-2)\times 10^6\cmmt$) gas,and its abundance is enhanced by one to two orders of magnitude with respect tothe protostellar envelope. we detect water emission in strong shocks from thehigh-velocity jet at 1000 au from the protostar. despite the large beam size ofthe telescope, such emission should be detectable with herschel.

1108.3600	supernova enhanced cosmic ray ionization and induced chemistry in a  molecular cloud of w51c	cosmic rays pervade the galaxy and are thought to be accelerated in supernovashocks. the interaction of cosmic rays with dense interstellar matter has twoimportant effects: 1) high energy (&gt;1 gev) protons produce {\gamma}-rays by{\pi}0-meson decay; 2) low energy (&lt; 1 gev) cosmic rays (protons and electrons)ionize the gas. we present here new observations towards a molecular cloudclose to the w51c supernova remnant and associated with a recently discoveredtev {\gamma}-ray source. our observations show that the cloud ionization degreeis highly enhanced, implying a cosmic ray ionization rate ~ 10-15 s-1, i.e. 100times larger than the standard value in molecular clouds. this is consistentwith the idea that the cloud is irradiated by an enhanced flux of freshlyaccelerated low-energy cosmic rays. in addition, the observed high cosmic rayionization rate leads to an instability in the chemistry of the cloud, whichkeeps the electron fraction high, ~ 10-5, in a large fraction (av \geq 6mag) ofthe cloud and low, ~ 10-7, in the interior. the two states have been predictedin the literature as high- and low-ionization phases (hip and lip). this is theobservational evidence of their simultaneous presence in a cloud.

1404.1447	localized sio emission triggered by the passage of the w51c snr shock	the region towards w51c is a convincing example of interaction between asupernova remnant and a surrounding molecular cloud. large electron abundanceshave been reported towards the position w51c-e located in this interactionregion, and it was proposed that the enhanced ionization fraction was due tocosmic ray particles freshly accelerated by the snr shock. we present pdbinterferometer observations of the h$^{13}$co$^+$(1-0) and dco$^+$(2-1)emission lines centered at position w51c-e. these observations confirm theprevious scenario of cosmic-ray induced ionization at this location. inaddition, sio(2-1) emission has been successfully mapped in the close vicinityof w51c-e, with a spatial resolution of 7". the morphology and kinematics ofthe sio emission are analyzed and strongly suggest that this emission isproduced by the passage of the snr primary shock. put in conjunction with theenhanced ionization fraction in this region, we give a consistent picture inwhich the w51c-e position is located downstream of the shock, where a largereservoir of freshly accelerated particles is available.

1405.0846	ch in absorption in iras16293-2422	while recent studies of the solar-mass protostar iras16293-2422 have focusedon its inner arcsecond, the wealth of herschel/hifi data has shown that thestructure of the outer envelope and of the transition region to the morediffuse ism is not clearly constrained. we use rotational ground-statetransitions of ch (methylidyne), as a tracer of the lower-density envelope.assuming lte, we perform a $\chi^2$ minimization of the high spectralresolution hifi observations of the ch transitions at ~532 and ~536 ghz inorder to derive column densities in the envelope and in the foreground cloud.we obtain column densities of (7.7$\pm$0.2)$\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ and(1.5$\pm$0.3)$\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. the chemical modelingpredicts column densities of (0.5-2)$\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the envelope(depending on the cosmic-ray ionization rate), and 5$\times10^{11}$ to2.5$\times10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the foreground cloud (depending on time). bothobserved abundances are reproduced by the model at a satisfactory level. theconstraints set by these observations on the physical conditions in theforeground cloud are however weak. furthermore, the ch abundance in theenvelope is strongly affected by the rate coefficient of the reactionh+ch$\rightarrow$c+h$_2$ ; further investigation of its value at lowtemperature would be necessary to facilitate the comparison between the modeland the observations.

1406.7195	the census of complex organic molecules in the solar type protostar  iras16293-2422	complex organic molecules (coms) are considered crucial molecules, since theyare connected with organic chemistry, at the basis of the terrestrial life.more pragmatically, they are molecules in principle difficult to synthetize inthe harsh interstellar environments and, therefore, a crucial test forastrochemical models. current models assume that several coms are synthesisedon the lukewarm grain surfaces ($\gtrsim$30-40 k), and released in the gasphase at dust temperatures $\gtrsim$100 k. however, recent detections of comsin $\lesssim$20 k gas demonstrate that we still need important pieces tocomplete the puzzle of the coms formation. we present here a complete census ofthe oxygen and nitrogen bearing coms, previously detected in different ismregions, towards the solar type protostar iras16293-2422. the census wasobtained from the millimeter-submillimeter unbiased spectral survey timasss.six coms, out of the 29 searched for, were detected: methyl cyanide, ketene,acetaldehyde, formamide, dimethyl ether, and methyl formate. the multifrequencyanalysis of the last five coms provides clear evidence that they are present inthe cold ($\lesssim$30 k) envelope of iras16293-2422, with abundances 0.03-2$\times 10^{-10}$. our data do not allow to support the hypothesis that thecoms abundance increases with increasing dust temperature in the cold envelope,as expected if coms were predominately formed on the lukewarm grain surfaces.finally, when considering also other ism sources, we find a strong correlationover five orders of magnitude, between the methyl formate and dimethyl etherand methyl formate and formamide abundances, which may point to a link betweenthese two couples of species, in cold and warm gas.

1410.8453	the density structure of the l1157 molecular outflow	we present a multiline cs survey towards the brightest bow-shock b1 in theprototypical chemically active protostellar outflow l1157. we made use of(sub-)mm data obtained in the framework of the chemical herschel surveys ofstar forming regions (chess) and astrochemical surveys at iram (asai) keyscience programs. we detected $^{12}$c$^{32}$s, $^{12}$c$^{34}$s,$^{13}$c$^{32}$s, and $^{12}$c$^{33}$s emissions, for a total of 18transitions, with $e_{\rm u}$ up to $\sim$ 180 k. the unprecedented sensitivityof the survey allows us to carefully analyse the line profiles, revealinghigh-velocity emission, up to 20 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the systemic. theprofiles can be well fitted by a combination of two exponential laws that areremarkably similar to what previously found using co. these components havebeen related to the cavity walls produced by the $\sim$ 2000 yr b1 shock andthe older ($\sim$ 4000 yr) b2 shock, respectively. the combination of low- andhigh-excitation cs emission was used to properly sample the different physicalcomponents expected in a shocked region. our cs observations show that thismolecule is highlighting the dense, $n_{\rm h_2}$ = 1--5 $\times$ 10$^{5}$cm$^{-3}$, cavity walls produced by the episodic outflow in l1157. in addition,the highest excitation (e$_u$ $\geq$ 130 k) cs lines provide us with thesignature of denser (1--5 $\times$ 10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas, associated with amolecular reformation zone of a dissociative j-type shock, which is expected toarise where the precessing jet impacting the molecular cavities. the csfractional abundance increases up to $\sim$ 10$^{-7}$ in all the kinematicalcomponents. this value is consistent with what previously found forprototypical protostars and it is in agreement with the prediction of theabundances obtained via the chemical code astrochem.

1411.6483	depletion of chlorine into hcl ice in a protostellar core	the freezeout of gas-phase species onto cold dust grains can drasticallyalter the chemistry and the heating-cooling balance of protostellar material.in contrast to well-known species such as carbon monoxide (co), the freezeoutof various carriers of elements with abundances $&lt;10^{-5}$ has not yet beenwell studied. our aim here is to study the depletion of chlorine in theprotostellar core, omc-2 fir 4. we observed transitions of hcl and h2cl+towards omc-2 fir 4 using the herschel space observatory and caltechsubmillimeter observatory facilities. our analysis makes use of state of theart chlorine gas-grain chemical models and newly calculated hcl-h$_{2}$hyperfine collisional excitation rate coefficients. a narrow emission componentin the hcl lines traces the extended envelope, and a broad one traces a morecompact central region. the gas-phase hcl abundance in fir 4 is 9e-11, a factorof only 0.001 that of volatile elemental chlorine. the h2cl+ lines are detectedin absorption and trace a tenuous foreground cloud, where we find no depletionof volatile chlorine. gas-phase hcl is the tip of the chlorine iceberg inprotostellar cores. using a gas-grain chemical model, we show that thehydrogenation of atomic chlorine on grain surfaces in the dark cloud stagesequesters at least 90% of the volatile chlorine into hcl ice, where it remainsin the protostellar stage. about 10% of chlorine is in gaseous atomic form.gas-phase hcl is a minor, but diagnostically key reservoir, with an abundanceof &lt;1e-10 in most of the protostellar core. we find the 35cl/37cl ratio inomc-2 fir 4 to be 3.2\pm0.1, consistent with the solar system value.

1412.8318	astrochemistry at work in the l1157-b1 shock: acetaldehyde formation	the formation of complex organic molecules (coms) in protostellarenvironments is a hotly debated topic. in particular, the relative importanceof the gas phase processes as compared to a direct formation of coms on thedust grain surfaces is so far unknown. we report here the first high-resolutionimages of acetaldehyde (ch$_3$cho) emission towards the chemically richprotostellar shock l1157-b1, obtained at 2 mm with the iram plateau de bureinterferometer. six blueshifted ch$_3$cho lines with $e_{\rm u}$ = 26-35 k havebeen detected. the acetaldehyde spatial distribution follows the young ($\sim$2000 yr) outflow cavity produced by the impact of the jet with the ambientmedium, indicating that this com is closely associated with the region enrichedby iced species evaporated from dust mantles and released into the gas phase. ahigh ch$_3$cho relative abundance, 2-3 $\times$ 10$^{-8}$, is inferred,similarly to what found in hot-corinos. astrochemical modelling indicates thatgas phase reactions can produce the observed quantity of acetaldehyde only if alarge fraction of carbon, of the order of 0.1%, is locked into icedhydrocarbons.

1412.8611	complex organic molecules in protostellar environments in the ska era	molecular complexity builds up at each step of the sun-like star formationprocess, starting from simple molecules and ending up in large polyatomicspecies. complex organic molecules (coms; such as methyl formate, hcooch$_3$,dymethyl ether, ch$_3$och$_3$, formamide, nh$_2$cho, or glycoaldehyde,hcoch$_2$oh) are formed in all the components of the star formation recipe(e.g. pre-stellar cores, hot-corinos, circumstellar disks, shocks induced byfast jets), due to ice grain mantle sublimation or sputtering as well asgas-phase reactions. understanding in great detail the involved processes islikely the only way to predict the ultimate molecular complexity reached in theism, as the detection of large molecules is increasingly more difficult withthe increase of the number of atoms constituting them.  thanks to the recent spectacular progress of astronomical observations, dueto the herschel (sub-mm and ir), iram and sma (mm and sub-mm), and nrao (cm)telescopes, an enormous activity is being developed in the field ofastrochemistry, extending from astronomical observatories to chemicallaboratories. we are involved in several observational projects providingunbiased spectral surveys (in the 80-300 and 500-2000 ghz ranges) withunprecedented sensitivity of templates of dense cores and protostars. forestsof com lines have been detected. in this chapter we will focus on the chemistryof both cold prestellar cores and hot shocked regions, (i) reviewing resultsand open questions provided by mm-fir observations, and (ii) showing the needof carrying on the observations of coms at lower frequencies, where ska willoperate. we will also emphasize the importance of analysing the spectra by thelight of the experimental studies performed by our team, who is investigatingthe chemical effects induced by ionising radiation bombarding astrophysicallyrelevant ices.

1502.05762	shedding light on the formation of the pre-biotic molecule formamide  with asai	formamide (nh2cho) has been proposed as a pre-biotic precursor with a keyrole in the emergence of life on earth. while this molecule has been observedin space, most of its detections correspond to high-mass star-forming regions.motivated by this lack of investigation in the low-mass regime, we searched forformamide, as well as isocyanic acid (hnco), in 10 low- and intermediate-masspre-stellar and protostellar objects. the present work is part of the iramlarge programme asai (astrochemical surveys at iram), which makes use ofunbiased broadband spectral surveys at millimetre wavelengths. we detected hncoin all the sources and nh2cho in five of them. we derived their abundances andanalysed them together with those reported in the literature for high-masssources. for those sources with formamide detection, we found a tight andalmost linear correlation between hnco and nh2cho abundances, with their ratiobeing roughly constant -between 3 and 10- across 6 orders of magnitude inluminosity. this suggests the two species are chemically related. the sourceswithout formamide detection, which are also the coldest and devoid of hotcorinos, fall well off the correlation, displaying a much larger amount of hncorelative to nh2cho. our results suggest that, while hnco can be formed in thegas phase during the cold stages of star formation, nh2cho forms mostefficiently on the mantles of dust grains at these temperatures, where itremains frozen until the temperature rises enough to sublimate the icy grainmantles. we propose hydrogenation of hnco as a likely formation route leadingto nh2cho.

1506.05180	first measurements of 15n fractionation in n2h+ toward high-mass star  forming cores	we report on the first measurements of the isotopic ratio 14n/15n in n2h+toward a statistically significant sample of high-mass star forming cores. thesources belong to the three main evolutionary categories of the high-mass starformation process: high-mass starless cores, high-mass protostellar objects,and ultracompact hii regions. simultaneous measurements of 14n/15n in cn havebeen made. the 14n/15n ratios derived from n2h+ show a large spread (from ~180up to ~1300), while those derived from cn are in between the value measured inthe terrestrial atmosphere (~270) and that of the proto-solar nebula (~440) forthe large majority of the sources within the errors. however, this differentspread might be due to the fact that the sources detected in the n2h+isotopologues are more than those detected in the cn ones. the 14n/15n ratiodoes not change significantly with the source evolutionary stage, whichindicates that time seems to be irrelevant for the fractionation of nitrogen.we also find a possible anticorrelation between the 14n/15n (as derived fromn2h+) and the h/d isotopic ratios. this suggests that 15n enrichment could notbe linked to the parameters that cause d enrichment, in agreement with theprediction by recent chemical models. these models, however, are not able toreproduce the observed large spread in 14n/15n, pointing out that someimportant routes of nitrogen fractionation could be still missing in themodels.

1507.02328	the composition of the protosolar disk and the formation conditions for  comets	conditions in the protosolar nebula have left their mark in the compositionof cometary volatiles, thought to be some of the most pristine material in thesolar system. cometary compositions represent the end point of processing thatbegan in the parent molecular cloud core and continued through the collapse ofthat core to form the protosun and the solar nebula, and finally during theevolution of the solar nebula itself as the cometary bodies were accreting.disentangling the effects of the various epochs on the final composition of acomet is complicated. but comets are not the only source of information aboutthe solar nebula. protostellar disks around young stars similar to the protosunprovide a way of investigating the evolution of disks similar to the solarnebula while they are in the process of evolving to form their own solarsystems. in this way we can learn about the physical and chemical conditionsunder which comets formed, and about the types of dynamical processing thatshaped the solar system we see today.  this paper summarizes some recent contributions to our understanding of bothcometary volatiles and the composition, structure and evolution of protostellardisks.

1512.02629	stratified nh and nd emission in the prestellar core 16293e in l1689n	high degrees of deuterium fractionation are commonly found in cold prestellarcores and in the envelopes around young protostars. as it brings strongconstraints to chemical models, deuterium chemistry is often used to infer corehistory or molecule formation pathways. whereas a large number of observationsis available regarding interstellar deuterated stable molecules, relativelylittle is known about the deuteration of hydride radicals, as their fundamentalrotational transitions are at high frequencies where the atmosphere is mostlyopaque. nitrogen hydride radicals are important species in nitrogen chemistry,as they are thought to be related to ammonia formation. observations have shownthat ammonia is strongly deuterated, with [nh2d]/[nh3] ~ 10%. models predictsimilarly high [nd]/[nh] ratios, but so far only one observationaldetermination of this ratio is available, towards the envelope of the protostariras16293-2422. in order to test model predictions, we aim here at determining[nd]/[nh] in a dense, starless core. we observed nh and nd in 16293e with thehifi spectrometer on board the herschel space observatory as part of the chessguaranteed time key programme, and derived the abundances of these two speciesusing a non-lte non-local radiative transfer model. both nh and nd are detectedin the source, with nd in emission and nh in absorption against the continuumarising from the cold dust emission. our model shows however that the ndemission and the nh absorption originate from different layers in the cloud, asfurther evidenced by their different velocities. in the central region of thecore, we can set a lower limit to the [nd]/[nh] ratio of ~2%. this estimate isconsistent with recent pure gas-phase models of nitrogen chemistry

astro-ph;0003031	iso spectroscopy of the hh 7-11 flow and its red-shifted counterpart	we have used the two spectrometers on the infrared space observatory toobserve the hh 7-11 flow, its red-shifted counterpart, and the candidateexciting source svs 13, in the star formation region ngc 1333. we detect atomic([oi]63um and 145um, [siii]34.8um, [cii]158um) and molecular (h_2, co, h_2o)lines at various positions along the bipolar flow.  most of the observed lines can be explained in terms of shock-excitedemission. in particular, our analysis shows that dissociative (j-type) andnon-dissociative (c-type) shocks are simultaneously present everywhere alongboth lobes of the flow. we confirm the low-excitation nature of the herbig-haronebulosities, with shock velocities &lt;40-50 km/s. toward both lobes of theoutflow we find pre-shock densities of n_0~10^4 cm-3 for both the j and ccomponents, implying b_0~100ug. in the central region of the flow, close to theexciting source, the pre-shock density deduced for the c-shock component isn_0~10^5 cm-3, suggesting a magnetic field ~3 times stronger. we propose thatthe deficiency of gas-phase water in the post c-shock regions is due tofreezing onto warm grains processed through the j-shock front and travelingalong the magnetic field lines. the total observed cooling from thedissociative shock components is consistent with the power lost by a slowmolecular outflow accelerated by a fast neutral hi wind.  finally, the skin of the cloud seen in projection toward the flow appears tobe weakly photo-ionised by bd +30 549, the dominant illuminating source of thengc 1333 reflection nebula.

astro-ph;0302305	water emission in ngc1333-iras4: probing its surrounding envelope	sun like stars are born from the collapse of fragment of molecular clouds.during the first embedded phase (the so called class 0/1), the protostar issurrounded by a collapsing envelope, whose physical and chemical structurewould set up the initial conditions of the proto-stellar disk which mayeventually form planets. in this contribution, we show how spectroscopic farinfrared to millimeter observations can be a powerful diagnostic to derive thechemical and physical structure of the innermost regions of envelopescollapsing around solar type protostars, where disk are believe to form. ourclaim is based on the simultaneous modeling of the dynamics, chemistry andradiative transfer in a protostellar envelope. here we present a study of aclass 0 protostar ngc1333-iras4, obtained using iso-lws observations of waterfar-infrared lines. we show the derived physical and chemical structure of theprotostar, namely the density and temperature profiles, as well as the waterabundance across the envelope. besides, the mass of the central protostar andits accretion rate can be constrained by these observations and modeling,yielding an alternative method to measure these two poorly know parameters.

astro-ph;0310328	sulphur-bearing species in the star forming region l1689n	we report observations of the expected main s-bearing species (so, so2 andh2s) in the low-mass star forming region l1689n. we obtained large scale(~300''x200'') maps of several transitions from these molecules with the goalto study the sulphur chemistry, i.e. how the relative abundances change in thedifferent physical conditions found in l1689n. we identified eight interestingregions, where we carried out a quantitative comparative study: the molecularcloud (as reference position), five shocked regions caused by the interactionof the molecular outflows with the cloud, and the two protostars iras16293-2422and 16293e. in the cloud we carefully computed the gas temperature and densityby means of a non-lte lvg code, while in other regions we used previousresults. we hence derived the column density of so, so2 and h2s, together withsio and h2co - which were observed previously - and their relevant abundanceratios. we find that sio is the molecule that shows the largest abundancevariations in the shocked regions, whereas s-bearing molecules show moremoderate variations. remarkably, the region of the brightest sio emission inl1689n is undetected in so2, h2s and h2co and only marginally detected in so.in the other weaker sio shocks, so2 is enhanced with respect to so. we proposea schema in which the different molecular ratios correspond to different agesof the shocks. finally, we find that so, so2 and h2s have significant abundancejumps in the inner hot core of iras16293-2422 and discuss the implications ofthe measured abundances.

astro-ph;0410619	hdo abundance in the envelope of the solar-type protostar iras16293-2422	we present iram 30m and jcmt observations of hdo lines towards the solar-typeprotostar iras 16293-2422. five hdo transitions have been detected on-source,and two were unfruitfully searched for towards a bright spot of the outflow ofiras 16293-2422. we interpret the data by means of the ceccarelli, hollenbachand tielens (1996) model, and derive the hdo abundance in the warm inner andcold outer parts of the envelope. the emission is well explained by a jumpmodel, with an inner abundance of 1e-7 and an outer abundance lower than 1e-9(3 sigma). this result is in favor of hdo enhancement due to ice evaporationfrom the grains in theinner envelope. the deuteration ratio hdo/h2o is found tobe f_in=3% and f_out &lt; 0.2% (3 sigma) in the inner and outer enveloperespectively and therefore, the fractionation also undergoes a jump in theinner part of the envelope. these results are consistent with the formation ofwater in the gas phase during the cold prestellar core phase and storage of themolecules on the grains, but do not explain why observations of h2o icesconsistently derive a h2o ice abundance of several 1e-5 to 1e-4, some twoorders of magnitude larger than the gas phase abundance of water in the hotcore around iras 16293-2422.

astro-ph;0411740	a submillimeter line survey of low-mass protostars: prelude to alma and  herschel	the results from a single-dish molecular line survey of a set of 18 deeplyembedded young stellar objects are summarized. more than 40 lines from 16different species were observed with the jcmt, onsala, iram 30m and sesttelescopes. the multi-transition data are analyzed using a temperature anddensity structure derived from models of the dust continuum emission. for theouter envelope (&gt;300 au), the data indicate a `drop' abundance profile for manyspecies, with normal abundances in the outer- and innermost regions and highlydepleted abundances in an intermediate zone. this zone is bounded at the outerthan the lifetime of the core, and at the inner edge by the evaporationtemperature of the species involved. in the innermost envelope (&lt;300 au), allices evaporate resulting in jumps in the abundances of complex organicmolecules such as ch3oh. a key project for herschel will be to survey gas-phasewater in these objects, whose abundance shows extreme variations withtemperature. alma wil be able to directly image the chemical variationsthroughout the envelope and zoom in on the inner hot core and protoplanetarydisks on scales on tens of au.

astro-ph;0504352	the circumstellar environment of t tau s at high spatial and spectral  resolution	we have obtained the first high spatial (0.05'') and spectral (r~35000)resolution 2 micron spectrum of the t tau s tight binary system using adaptiveoptics on the keck ii telescope. we have also obtained the first 3.8 and 4.7micron images that resolve the three components of the t tau multiple system,as well as new 1.6 and 2.2 micron images. together with its very rednear-infrared colors, the spectrum of t tau sb shows that this t tauri star isextincted by a roughly constant extinction of av~15 mag, which is probably the0.7''x0.5'' circumbinary structure recently observed in absorption in theultraviolet. t tau sa, which is also observed through this screen and isactively accreting, further possesses a small edge-on disk that is evidenced bywarm (390 k), narrow overtone co rovibrational absorption features in ourspectrum. we find that t tau sa is most likely an intermediate-mass starsurrounded by a semi-transparent 2-3 au-radius disk whose asymmetries and shortkeplerian rotation explain the large photometric variability of the source onrelatively short timescales. we also show that molecular hydrogen emissionexclusively arises from the gas that surrounds t tau s and that its spatial andkinematic structure, while providing suggestive evidence for a jet-likestructure, is highly complex.

astro-ph;0505072	line profiles of molecular ions toward the pre-stellar core ldn 1544	velocity profiles of ground state lines of h2d+, hc18o+ and n2h+, observedpreviously with the cso and iram 30m telescopes, are modeled with a monte carloradiative transfer program to study the temperature, density and velocitystructure of the pre-stellar core ldn 1544. the h2d+ line is double-peaked likethat of the other ions, but previous models that fit the hc18o+ and n2h+profiles are found not to fit the h2d+ data. matching the h2d+ observationsrequires at least three modifications to the model at small radii: (1) thedensity profile must continue to rise inward and not flatten off toward thecenter; (2) the gas temperature must be nearly constant and not drop inwardssignificantly; (3) the infall velocity must increase inward, in a fashionintermediate between `quasi-static' (ambipolar diffusion) and `fully dynamic'(larson-penston) collapse. the c18o emission indicates a chemical age of &lt;~0.1myr. the effects of a flattened structure and rotation on the line profiles areshown to be unimportant, at least on the scales probed by single-dishtelescopes. alternatively, the h2d+ profile is affected by absorption in theouter layers of the core, if gas motions in these layers are sufficientlysmall.

astro-ph;0506144	theoretical hdo emission from low-mass protostellar envelopes	we present theoretical predictions of the rotational line emission ofdeuterated water in low-mass protostar collapsing envelopes. the model accountsfor the density and temperature structure of the envelope, according theinside-out collapse framework. the deuterated water abundance profile isapproximated by a step function, with a low value in the cold outer envelopeand a higher value in the inner envelope where the grain mantles evaporate. thetwo abundances are the two main parameters of the modeling, along with thetemperature at which the mantles evaporate. we report line flux predictions fora 30 and 5 l$_\odot$ source luminosity respectively. we show that ground basedobservations are capable to constrain the three parameters of the model in thecase of bright low-mass protostars (l$&gt;$10 l$_{\odot}$), and that no spacebased observations, like for example hso observations, are required in thiscase. on the contrary, we show that the study of low-luminosity sources (l$&lt;$10l$_{\odot}$), assuming the same hdo abundance profile, requires too muchintegration time to be carried out either with available ground-basedtelescopes or with the hifi instrument on board hso. for these sources, onlythe large interferometer alma will allow to constrain the hdo abundance.

astro-ph;0507172	methanol emission from low mass protostars	we present observations of methanol lines in a sample of class 0 low massprotostars. using a 1-d radiative transfer model, we derive the abundances inthe envelopes. in two sources of the sample, the observations can only bereproduced by the model if the methanol abundance is enhanced by about twoorder of magnitude in the inner hot region of the envelope. two other sourcesshow similar jumps, although at a lower confidence level. the observations forthe other three sources are well reproduced with a constant abundance, but thepresence of a jump cannot be ruled out. the observed methanol abundances in thewarm gas around low mass protostars are orders of magnitude higher than gasphase chemistry models predict. hence, in agreement with other evidences, thissuggest that the high methanol abundance reflects recent evaporation of icesdue to the heating by the newly formed star. the observed abundance ratios ofch3 oh, h2 co, and co are in good agreement with grain surface chemistrymodels. however, the absolute abundances are more difficult to reproduce andmay point towards the presence of multiple ice components in these regions.

astro-ph;0508256	discovery of deuterated water in a young proto-planetary disk	we report the first detection of the ground transition of the deuteratedwater at 464 ghz in the young proto-planetary disk surrounding the solar typeprotostar dm tau. the line is observed in absorption against the continuum fromthe cold dust in the disk midplane, with a line to continuum ratio close tounity. the observation implies that deuterated gaseous water is present, with arelatively large abundance ($\sim 3\times10^{-9}$), in the outer disk above themidplane, where the density is, within a factor ten, $\sim 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ andthe temperature is lower than about 25 k. in these conditions, the h$_2$ocondensation timescale is much smaller than the dm tau disk age, and,therefore, water should be fully frozen onto the grain mantles. we suggest thatuv photons and/or x-rays sublimate part of the mantles re-injecting the icesinto the gas phase. even though there is currently no measurement of h$_2$o, weprovide arguments that the hdo/h$_2$o ratio should be about 0.01 or larger,which would be hundreds of times larger than the values measured in solarsystem objects. this suggests the need of strong caution in comparing andlinking the hdo/h$_2$o in solar system and star forming environments.

astro-ph;0510635	gas phase water in the surface layer of protoplanetary disks	recent observations of the ground state transition of hdo at 464 ghz towardsthe protoplanetary disk of dm tau have detected the presence of water vapor inthe regions just above the outer disk midplane (ceccarelli et al 2005). in theabsence of non-thermal desorption processes, water should be almost entirelyfrozen onto the grain mantles and hdo undetectable. in this letter we present achemical model that explores the possibility that the icy mantles arephoto-desorbed by fuv (6ev &lt; h nu &lt; 13.6ev) photons. we show that the averageinterstellar fuv field is enough to create a layer of water vapor above thedisk midplane over the entire disk. assuming a photo-desorption yield of10^{-3}, the water abundance in this layer is predicted to be ~ 3 x 10^{-7} andthe average h2o column density is ~ 1.6x 10^{15} cm^{-2}. the predictions arevery weakly dependent on the details of the model, like the incident fuvradiation field, and the gas density in the disk. based on this model, wepredict a gaseous hdo/h2o ratio in dm tau of ~1%. in addition, we predict theground state transition of water at 557 ghz to be undetectable with odin and/orhso-hifi.

astro-ph;0603135	testing grain surface chemistry : a survey of deuterated formaldehyde  and methanol in low-mass class 0 protostars	context : despite the low cosmic abundance of deuterium (d/h ~ 1e-5), largedegrees of deuterium fractionation in molecules are observed in star formingregions with enhancements that can reach 13 orders of magnitude, which currentmodels have difficulties to account for.  aims : multi-isotopologue observations are a very powerful constraint forchemical models. the aim of our observations is to understand the processesforming the observed large abundances of methanol and formaldehyde in low-massprotostellar envelopes (gas-phase processes ? chemistry on the grain surfaces?) and better constrain the chemical models. methods : using the iram 30msingle-dish telescope, we observed deuterated formaldehyde (hdco and d2co) andmethanol (ch2doh, ch3od, and chd2oh) towards a sample of seven low-mass class 0protostars. using population diagrams, we then derive the fractionation ratiosof these species (abundance ratio between the deuterated molecule and its mainisotopologue) and compare them to the predictions of grain chemistry models.results : these protostars show a similar level of deuteration as iniras16293-2422, where doubly-deuterated methanol -- and even triply-deuteratedmethanol -- were first detected. our observations point to the formation ofmethanol on the grain surfaces, while formaldehyde formation cannot be fullypined down. while none of the scenarii can be excluded (gas-phase or grainchemistry formation), they both seem to require abstraction reactions toreproduce the observed fractionations.

astro-ph;0605126	deuterium enhancement in h3+ in prestellar cores	deuterium enhancement of monodeuterated species has been recognized for morethan 30 years as a result of the chemical fractionation that results from thedifference in zero point energies of deuterated and hydrogenated molecules. thekey reaction is the deuteron exchange in the reaction between hd, the reservoirof deuterium in dark interstellar clouds, and the h3+ molecular ion, leading tothe production of the h2d+ molecule, and the low temperature in darkinterstellar clouds favors this production. furthermore, the presence ofmultiply deuterated species have incited our group to proceed further andconsider the subsequent reaction of h2d+ with hd, leading to d2h+ (firstdetected by vastel et al. 2004), which can further react with hd to produced3+. in prestellar cores, where co was found to be depleted (bacmann et al.2003), this production should be increased, as co would normally destroy h3+.the first model including d2h+ and d3+ (roberts, herbst &amp; millar 2003)predicted that these molecules should be as abundant as h2d+ (see contributionby h. roberts). the first detection of the d2h+ was made possible by the recentlaboratory measurement by hirao &amp; amano (2003) for the frequency of thefundamental line of the para-d2h+ (see contribution by t. amano). here wepresent observations of h2d+ and d2h+ towards a sample of dark clouds andprestellar cores and show how the distribution of ortho-h2d+ (1_1,0-1_1,1) cantrace the deuterium factory in prestellar cores. we also present how futureinstrumentation will improve our knowledge concerning the deuterium enhancementof h3+.
