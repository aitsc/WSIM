0901.4705	discovery and characterization of wasp-6b, an inflated sub-jupiter mass  planet transiting a solar-type star	we report the discovery of wasp-6b, an inflated sub-jupiter mass planettransiting every 3.3610060 +0.0000022-0.0000035 days a mildly metal-poorsolar-type star of magnitude v=11.9. a combined analysis of the waspphotometry, high-precision followup transit photometry and radial velocitiesyield a planetary mass m_p = 0.503 +0.019-0.038 m_jup and radius r_p = 1.224+0.051-0.052 r_jup, resulting in a density rho_p = 0.27 +-0.05 rho_jup. themass and radius for the host star are m_s = 0.88 +0.05-0.08 m_sun and r_s =0.870 +0.025-0.036 r_sun. the non-zero orbital eccentricity e = 0.054+0.018-0.015 that we measure suggests that the planet underwent a massive tidalheating ~1 gyr ago that could have contributed to its inflated radius.high-precision radial velocities obtained during a transit allow us to measurea sky-projected angle between the stellar spin and orbital axis beta = 11+14-18 deg. in addition to similar published measurements, this result favors adominant migration mechanism based on tidal interactions with a protoplanetarydisk.

0906.3414	a superwasp search for additional transiting planets in 24 known systems	we present results from a search for additional transiting planets in 24systems already known to contain a transiting planet. we model the transits dueto the known planet in each system and subtract these models from lightcurvesobtained with the superwasp survey instruments. these residual lightcurves arethen searched for evidence of additional periodic transit events. although wedo not find any evidence for additional planets in any of the planetary systemsstudied, we are able to characterise our ability to find such planets by meansof monte carlo simulations. artificially generated transit signalscorresponding to planets with a range of sizes and orbital periods wereinjected into the superwasp photometry and the resulting lightcurves searchedfor planets. as a result, the detection efficiency as a function of both theradius and orbital period of any second planet, is calculated. we determinethat there is a good (&gt; 50 per cent) chance of detecting additional,saturn-sized planets in p ~ 10 d orbits around planet-hosting stars that haveseveral seasons of superwasp photometry. additionally, we confirm previousevidence of the rotational stellar variability of wasp-10, and refine theperiod of rotation. we find that the period of the rotation is 11.91 \pm 0.05d, and the false alarm probability for this period is extremely low (~10^{-13}).

0907.2659	swift observations of gw lib: a unique insight into a rare outburst	the second known outburst of the wz sge type dwarf nova gw lib was observedin april 2007. we have obtained unique multiwavelength data of this outburstwhich lasted ~ 26 days. aavso observers recorded the outburst in the optical,which was also monitored by wasp, with a peak v magnitude of ~ 8. the outburstwas followed in the uv and x-ray wavelengths by the swift uvot and xrttelescopes. the x-ray flux at optical maximum was found to be three orders ofmagnitude above the pre-outburst quiescent level, whereas x-rays are normallysuppressed during dwarf nova outbursts. a distinct supersoft x-ray componentwas also detected at optical maximum, which probably arises from anoptically-thick boundary layer. follow-up swift observations taken one and twoyears after the outburst show that the post-outburst quiescent x-ray fluxremains an order of magnitude higher than the pre-outburst flux. the longinteroutburst timescale of gw lib with no observed normal outbursts support theidea that the inner disc in gw lib is evacuated or the disc viscosity is verylow.

0707.0417	efficient identification of exoplanetary transit candidates from  superwasp light curves	transiting extrasolar planets constitute only a small fraction of the rangeof stellar systems found to display periodic, shallow dimmings in wide-fieldsurveys employing small-aperture camera arrays. here we present an efficientselection strategy for follow-up observations, derived from analysis of thelight curves of a sample of 67 superwasp targets that passed the selectiontests we used in earlier papers, but which have subsequently been identifiedeither as planet hosts or as astrophysical false positives. we determine thesystem parameters using markov-chain monte carlo analysis of the superwasplight curves. we use a constrained optimisation of chi-squared combined with abayesian prior based on the main-sequence mass and radius expected from the2mass j-h colour. the bayesian nature of the analysis allows us to quantifyboth the departure of the host star from the main-sequence mass-radius relationand the probability that the companion radius is less than 1.5 jupiter radii.when augmented by direct light curve analyses that detect binaries with unequalprimary and secondary eclipses, and objects with aperture blends that areresolved by superwasp, we find that only 13 of the original 67 stars, includingthe three known planets in the sample, would qualify for follow-up. thissuggests that planet discovery "hit rates" better than one-in-five should beachievable. in addition, the stellar binaries that qualify are likely to haveastrophysically interesting stellar or sub-stellar secondaries.

0908.0189	the main-sequence rotation-colour relation in the coma berenices open  cluster	we present the results of a photometric survey of rotation rates in the comaberenices (melotte 111) open cluster, using data obtained as part of thesuperwasp exoplanetary transit-search programme. the goal of the coma surveywas to measure precise rotation periods for main-sequence f, g and k dwarfs inthis intermediate-age (~600 myr) cluster, and to determine the extent to whichmagnetic braking has caused the stellar spin periods to converge. we find atight, almost linear relationship between rotation period and j-k colour with aroot-mean square scatter of only 2 percent. the relation is similar to thatseen among f, g and k stars in the hyades. such strong convergence can only beexplained if angular momentum is not at present being transferred from areservoir in the deep stellar interiors to the surface layers. we conclude thatthe coupling timescale for angular momentum transport from a rapidly-spinningradiative core to the outer convective zone must be substantially shorter thanthe cluster age, and that from the age of coma onward, stars rotate effectivelyas solid bodies. the existence of a tight relationship between stellar mass androtation period at a given age supports the use of stellar rotation period asan age indicator in f, g and k stars of hyades age and older. we demonstratethat individual stellar ages can be determined within the coma population withan internal precision of order 9 percent (rms), using a standard magneticbraking law in which rotation period increases with the square root of stellarage. we find that a slight modification to the magnetic-braking power law, pproportional to t^0.56, yields rotational and asteroseismological ages in goodagreement for the sun and other stars of solar age for which p-mode studies andphotometric rotation periods have been published.

0908.1553	wasp-17b: an ultra-low density planet in a probable retrograde orbit	we report the discovery of the transiting giant planet wasp-17b, theleast-dense planet currently known. it is 1.6 saturn masses but 1.5-2 jupiterradii, giving a density of 6-14 per cent that of jupiter. wasp-17b is in a3.7-day orbit around a sub-solar metallicity, v = 11.6, f6 star. preliminarydetection of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect suggests that wasp-17b is in aretrograde orbit (lambda ~ -150 deg), indicative of a violent history involvingplanet-planet or star-planet scattering.  wasp-17b's bloated radius could be due to tidal heating resulting from recentor ongoing tidal circularisation of an eccentric orbit, such as the highlyeccentric orbits that typically result from scattering interactions. it willthus be important to determine more precisely the current orbital eccentricityby further high-precision radial velocity measurements or by timing thesecondary eclipse, both to reduce the uncertainty on the planet's radius and totest tidal-heating models. owing to its low surface gravity, wasp-17b'satmosphere has the largest scale height of any known planet, making it a goodtarget for transmission spectroscopy.

1001.0403	wasp-19b: the shortest period transiting exoplanet yet discovered	we report on the discovery of a new extremely short period transitingextrasolar planet, wasp-19b. the planet has mass mpl = 1.15 \pm 0.08 mj, radiusrpl = 1.31 \pm 0.06 rj, and orbital period p = 0.7888399 \pm 0.0000008 days.through spectroscopic analysis, we determine the host star to be a slightlysuper-solar metallicity ([m/h] = 0.1 \pm 0.1 dex) g-dwarf with teff = 5500 \pm100 k. in addition, we detect periodic, sinusoidal flux variations in the lightcurve which are used to derive a rotation period for the star of prot = 10.5\pm 0.2 days. the relatively short stellar rotation period suggests that eitherwasp-19 is somewhat young (~ 600 myr old) or tidal interactions between the twobodies have caused the planet to spiral inward over its lifetime resulting inthe spin-up of the star. due to the detection of the rotation period, thissystem has the potential to place strong constraints on the stellar tidalquality factor, q's, if a more precise age is determined.

1004.4551	line-profile tomography of exoplanet transits -- ii. a gas-giant planet  transiting a rapidly-rotating a5 star	most of our knowledge of extrasolar planets rests on precise radial-velocitymeasurements, either for direct detection or for confirmation of the planetaryorigin of photometric transit signals. this has limited our exploration of theparameter space of exoplanet hosts to solar- and later-type, sharp-lined stars.here we extend the realm of stars with known planetary companions to includehot, fast-rotating stars. planet-like transits have previously been reported inthe lightcurve obtained by the superwasp survey of the a5 star hd15082(wasp-33; v=8.3, v sin i = 86 km/sec). here we report further photometry andtime-series spectroscopy through three separate transits, which we use toconfirm the existence of a gas giant planet with an orbital period of 1.22d inorbit around hd15082. from the photometry and the properties of the planetsignal travelling through the spectral line profiles during the transit wedirectly derive the size of the planet, the inclination and obliquity of itsorbital plane, and its retrograde orbital motion relative to the spin of thestar. this kind of analysis opens the way to studying the formation of planetsaround a whole new class of young, early-type stars, hence under differentphysical conditions and generally in an earlier stage of formation than insharp-lined late-type stars. the reflex orbital motion of the star caused bythe transiting planet is small, yielding an upper mass limit of 4.1 jupitermasses on the planet. we also find evidence of a third body of sub-stellar massin the system, which may explain the unusual orbit of the transiting planet. inhd 15082, the stellar line profiles also show evidence of non-radialpulsations, clearly distinct from the planetary transit signal. this raises theintriguing possibility that tides raised by the close-in planet may excite oramplify the pulsations in such stars.

1008.1089	detection limits for close eclipsing and transiting sub-stellar and  planetary companions to white dwarfs in the wasp survey	we have performed extensive simulations to explore the possibility ofdetecting eclipses and transits of close, sub-stellar and planetary companionsto white dwarfs in wasp light-curves. our simulations cover companions$\sim0.3\re&lt;{\rm r}_{pl}&lt;12\re$ and orbital periods $2{\rm h}&lt;p&lt;15{\rm d}$,equivalent to orbital radii $0.003{\rm au} &lt; a &lt; 0.1{\rm au}$. for gaussianrandom noise wasp is sensitive to transits by companions as small as the moonorbiting a $\textrm{v}\simeq$12 white dwarf. for fainter white dwarfs wasp issensitive to increasingly larger radius bodies. however, in the presence ofcorrelated noise structure in the light-curves the sensitivity drops, althoughearth-sized companions remain detectable in principle even in low s/n data.mars-sized, and even mercury-sized bodies yield reasonable detection rates inhigh-quality light-curves with little residual noise. we searched for eclipsesand transit signals in long-term light-curves of a sample of 194 white dwarfsresulting from a cross-correlation of the mccook $&amp;$ sion catalogue and thewasp archive. no evidence for eclipsing or transiting sub-stellar and planetarycompanions was found. we used this non-detection and results from oursimulations to place tentative upper limits to the frequency of such objects inclose orbits at white dwarfs. while only weak limits can be placed on thelikely frequency of earth-sized or smaller companions, brown dwarfs and gasgiants (radius $\approx \rjup$) with periods $&lt;0.1-0.2$ days must certainly berare ($&lt;10%$). more stringent constraints likely requires significantly largerwhite dwarf samples, higher observing cadence and continuous coverage. theshort duration of eclipses and transits of white dwarfs compared to the cadenceof wasp observations appears to be one of the main factors limiting thedetection rate in a survey optimised for planetary transits of main sequencestars.

1107.4986	discovery of a stripped red giant core in a bright eclipsing binary  system	we have identified a star in the wasp archive photometry with an unusuallightcurve due to the total eclipse of a small, hot star by an apparentlynormal a-type star and with an orbital period of only 0.668d. from an analysisof the wasp lightcurve together with v-band and i_c-band photometry of theeclipse and a spectroscopic orbit for the a-type star we estimate that thecompanion star has a mass of (0.23+-0.03)msun and a radius of (0.33+-0.01)rsun,assuming that the a-type star is a main-sequence star with the metalicityappropriate for a thick-disk star. the effective temperature of the companionis (13400+-1200)k from which we infer a luminosity of (3+-1)lsun. from acomparison of these parameters to various models we conclude that the companionis most likely to be the remnant of a red giant star that has been veryrecently stripped of its outer layers by mass transfer onto the a-type star. inthis scenario, the companion is currently in a shell hydrogen-burning phase ofits evolution, evolving at nearly constant luminosity to hotter effectivetemperatures prior to ceasing hydrogen burning and fading to become a low-masswhite dwarf composed of helium (he-wd). the system will then resemble thepre-he-wd/he-wd companions to a-type and b-type stars recently identified fromtheir kepler satellite lightcurves (koi-74, koi-81 and kic10657664). this newlydiscovered binary offers the opportunity to study the evolution of a strippedred giant star through the pre-he-wd stage in great detail.

1108.2641	wasp-50b: a hot jupiter transiting a moderately active solar-type star	we report the discovery by the wasp transit survey of a giant planet in aclose orbit (0.0295+-0.0009 au) around a moderately bright (v=11.6, k=10) g9dwarf (0.89+-0.08 m_sun, 0.84+-0.03 r_sun) in the southern constellationeridanus. thanks to high-precision follow-up photometry and spectroscopyobtained by the telescopes trappist and euler, the mass and size of thisplanet, wasp-50b, are well constrained to 1.47+-0.09 m_jup and 1.15+-0.05r_jup, respectively. the transit ephemeris is 2455558.6120 (+-0.0002) + n x1.955096 (+-0.000005) hjd_utc. the size of the planet is consistent with basicmodels of irradiated giant planets. the chromospheric activity (log r'_hk =-4.67) and rotational period (p_rot = 16.3+-0.5 days) of the host star suggestan age of 0.8+-0.4 gy that is discrepant with a stellar-evolution estimatebased on the measured stellar parameters (rho_star = 1.48+-0.10 rho_sun, teff =5400+-100 k, [fe/h]= -0.12+-0.08) which favours an age of 7+-3.5 gy. thisdiscrepancy could be explained by the tidal and magnetic influence of theplanet on the star, in good agreement with the observations that stars hostinghot jupiters tend to show faster rotation and magnetic activity (pont 2009;hartman 2010). we measure a stellar inclination of 84 (-31,+6) deg,disfavouring a high stellar obliquity. thanks to its large irradiation and therelatively small size of its host star, wasp-50b is a good target foroccultation spectrophotometry, making it able to constrain the relationshipbetween hot jupiters' atmospheric thermal profiles and the chromosphericactivity of their host stars proposed by knutson et al.

1202.0686	discovery of a stripped red giant core in a bright eclipsing binary star	we report the serendipitous discovery from wasp archive photometry of abinary star in which an apparently normal a-type star (j0247-25a) eclipses asmaller, hotter subdwarf star (j0247-25b). the kinematics of j0247-25a showthat it is a blue-straggler member of the galactic thick-disk. we presentfollow-up photometry and spectroscopy from which we derive approximate valuesfor the mass, radius and luminosity for j0247-25b assuming that j0247-25a hasthe mass appropriate for a normal thick-disk star. we find that the propertiesof j0247-25b are well matched by models for a red giant stripped of its outerlayers and currently in a shell hydrogen-burning stage. in this scenario,j0247-25b will go on to become a low mass white dwarf (m~0.25 solar masses)composed mostly of helium. j0247-25b can be studied in much greater detail thanthe handful of pre helium white dwarfs (pre-he-wd) identified to-date. theseresults have been published by maxted et al., 2011. we also present apreliminary analysis of more recent observations of j0247-25 with the uvesspectrograph, from which we derive much improved masses for both stars in thebinary. we find that both stars are more massive than expected and thatj0247-25a rotates sub-synchronously by a factor of about 2. we also presentlightcurves for 5 new eclipsing pre-he-wd subsequently identified from the wasparchive photometry, 4 of which have mass estimates for the subdwarf companionbased on a pair of radial velocity measurements.

1205.3503	detection of weak circumstellar gas around the daz white dwarf wd  1124-293: evidence for the accretion of multiple asteroids	single metal polluted white dwarfs with no dusty disks are believed to beactively accreting metals from a circumstellar disk of gas caused by thedestruction of asteroids perturbed by planetary systems. we report, for thefirst time, the detection of circumstellar ca~ii gas in absorption around thedaz wd~1124-293, which lacks an infrared excess. we constrain the gas to $&gt;$7$r_{\rm wd}$ and $&lt;$32000~au, and estimate it to be at $\sim$54~r$_{\rm wd}$,well within wd~1124-293's tidal disruption radius. this detection is based onseveral epochs of spectroscopy around the ca~ii h and k lines($\lambda$=3968\aa, 3933\aa) with the mike spectrograph on the magellan/claytelescope at las campanas observatory. we confirm the circumstellar nature ofthe gas by observing nearby sightlines and finding no evidence for gas from thelocal interstellar medium. through archival data we have measured theequivalent width of the two photospheric ca lines over a period of 11 years. wesee $&lt;$ 5-7\% epoch-to-epoch variation in equivalent widths over this timeperiod, and no evidence for long term trends. the presence of a circumstellargas implies a near edge-on inclination to the system, thus we place limits toshort period transiting planetary companions with r $&gt;$ r$_{\rm \oplus}$ usingthe wasp survey. the presence of gas in orbit around wd~1124-293 implies thatmost dazs could harbor planetary systems. since 25-30\% of white dwarfs showmetal line absorption, the dynamical process for perturbing small bodies mustbe robust.

1210.2329	wasp-54b, wasp-56b and wasp-57b: three new sub-jupiter mass planets from  superwasp	we present three newly discovered sub-jupiter mass planets from the superwaspsurvey: wasp-54b is a heavily bloated planet of mass 0.636$^{+0.025}_{-0.024}$\mj and radius 1.653$^{+0.090}_{-0.083}$ \rj. it orbits a f9 star, evolving offthe main sequence, every 3.69 days. our mcmc fit of the system yields aslightly eccentric orbit ($e=0.067^{+0.033}_{-0.025}$) for wasp-54b. weinvestigated further the veracity of our detection of the eccentric orbit forwasp-54b, and we find that it could be real. however, given the brightness ofwasp-54 v=10.42 magnitudes, we encourage observations of a secondary eclipse todraw robust conclusions on both the orbital eccentricity and the thermalstructure of the planet. wasp-56b and wasp-57b have masses of0.571$^{+0.034}_{-0.035}$ \mj and $0.672^{+0.049}_{-0.046}$ \mj, respectively;and radii of $1.092^{+0.035}_{-0.033}$ \rj for wasp-56b and$0.916^{+0.017}_{-0.014}$ \rj for wasp-57b. they orbit main sequence stars ofspectral type g6 every 4.67 and 2.84 days, respectively. wasp-56b and wasp-57bshow no radius anomaly and a high density possibly implying a large core ofheavy elements; possibly as high as $\sim$50 m$_{\oplus}$ in the case ofwasp-57b. however, the composition of the deep interior of exoplanets remainstill undetermined. thus, more exoplanet discoveries such as the ones presentedin this paper, are needed to understand and constrain giant planets' physicalproperties.

1210.5931	accurate spectroscopic parameters of wasp planet host stars	we have made a detailed spectral analysis of eleven wide angle search forplanets (wasp) planet host stars using high signal-to-noise (s/n) harpsspectra. our line list was carefully selected from the spectra of the sun andprocyon, and we made a critical evaluation of the atomic data. the spectrallines were measured using equivalent widths. the procedures were tested on thesun and procyon prior to be being used on the wasp stars. the effectivetemperature, surface gravity, microturbulent velocity and metallicity weredetermined for all the stars. we show that abundances derived from high s/nspectra are likely to be higher than those obtained from low s/n spectra, asnoise can cause the equivalent width to be underestimated. we also show thatthere is a limit to the accuracy of stellar parameters that can be achieved,despite using high s/n spectra, and the average uncertainty in effectivetemperature, surface gravity, microturbulent velocity and metallicity is 83 k,0.11 dex, 0.11 km/s and 0.10 dex respectively.

(2010), wasp-26bis predicted to host a thermal inversion. the brightness temperatures deducedfrom the eclipse depths are consistent with an isothermal atmosphere, althoughit is within the uncertainties that the planet may host a weak thermalinversion. the data are equally well fit by atmospheric models with or withouta thermal inversion. we find that variation in activity of solar-like starsdoes not change enough over the time-scales of months or years to change theinterpretation of the knutson et al.

1403.4095	a window on exoplanet dynamical histories: rossiter-mclaughlin  observations of wasp-13b and wasp-32b	we present rossiter-mclaughlin observations of wasp-13b and wasp-32b anddetermine the sky-projected angle between the normal of the planetary orbit andthe stellar rotation axis ($\lambda$). wasp-13b and wasp-32b both have progradeorbits and are consistent with alignment with measured sky-projected angles of$\lambda={8^{\circ}}^{+13}_{-12}$ and $\lambda={-2^{\circ}}^{+17}_{-19}$,respectively.  both wasp-13 and wasp-32 have $t_{\mathrm{eff}}&lt;6250$k and therefore thesesystems support the general trend that aligned planetary systems arepreferentially found orbiting cool host stars. a lomb-scargle periodogramanalysis was carried out on archival superwasp data for both systems. astatistically significant stellar rotation period detection (above 99.9\%confidence) was identified for the wasp-32 system with $p_{\mathrm{rot}}=11.6\pm 1.0 $ days. this rotation period is in agreement with the predicted stellarrotation period calculated from the stellar radius, $r_{\star}$, and $v \sin i$if a stellar inclination of $i_{\star}=90^{\circ}$ is assumed. with thedetermined rotation period, the true 3d angle between the stellar rotation axisand the planetary orbit, $\psi$, was found to be $\psi=11^{\circ} \pm 14$. weconclude with a discussion on the alignment of systems around cool host starswith $t_{\mathrm{eff}}&lt;6150$k by calculating the tidal dissipation timescale.we find that systems with short tidal dissipation timescales are preferentiallyaligned and systems with long tidal dissipation timescales have a broad rangeof obliquities.

1403.4764	hd 54272, a classical lambda bootis star and gamma doradus pulsator	we detect the second known lambda bootis star (hd 54272) which exhibits gammadoradus-type pulsations. the star was formerly misidentified as a rr lyraevariable. the lambda bootis stars are a small group (only 2 per cent) of late bto early f-type, population i stars which show moderate to extreme (up to afactor 100) surface underabundances of most fe-peak elements and solarabundances of lighter elements (c, n, o, and s). the photometric data from thewide angle search for planets (wasp) and all sky automated survey (asas)projects were analysed. they have an overlapping time base of 1566 d and 2545d, respectively. six statistically significant peaks were identified (f1 =1.410 116 c/d, f2 = 1.283 986 c/d, f3 = 1.293 210 c/d, f4 = 1.536 662 c/d, f5 =1.157 22 c/d and f6 = 0.226 57 c/d). the spacing between f1 and f2, f1 and f4,f5 and f2 is almost identical. since the daily aliasing is very strong, theinterpretation of frequency spectra is somewhat ambiguous. from spectroscopicdata, we deduce a high rotational velocity (250+-25 km/s) and a metaldeficiency of about -0.8 to -1.1 dex compared to the sun. a comparison with thesimilar star, hr 8799, results in analogous pulsational characteristics butwidely different astrophysical parameters. since both are lambda bootis-typestars, the main mechanism of this phenomenon, selective accretion, may severelyinfluence gamma doradus-type pulsations.

1406.6942	wasp-117b: a 10-day-period saturn in an eccentric and misaligned orbit	we report the discovery of wasp-117b, the first planet with a period beyond10 days found by the wasp survey. the planet has a mass of $m_p= 0.2755 \pm0.0089 \, m_{j}$, a radius of $r_p= 1.021_{-0.065}^{+0.076}\, r_{j}$ and is inan eccentric ($ e= 0.302 \pm 0.023 $), $ 10.02165 \pm 0.00055 $~d orbit arounda main-sequence f9 star. the host star's brightness (v=10.15 mag) makeswasp-117 a good target for follow-up observations, and with a periastronplanetary equilibrium temperature of $t_{eq}= 1225_{-39}^{+36}$ k and a lowplanetary mean density ($\rho_p= 0.259_{-0.048}^{+0.054} \, \rho_{j}$) it isone of the best targets for transmission spectroscopy among planets withperiods around 10 days. from a measurement of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect,we infer a projected angle between the planetary orbit and stellar spin axes of$\beta = -44 \pm 11$ deg, and we further derive an orbital obliquity of $\psi =69.6 ^{+4.7}_{-4.1}$ deg. owing to the large orbital separation, tidal forcescausing orbital circularization and realignment of the planetary orbit with thestellar plane are weak, having had little impact on the planetary orbit overthe system lifetime. wasp-117b joins a small sample of transiting giant planetswith well characterized orbits at periods above ~8 days.

astro-ph;0311035	variability in black hole accretion discs	observations of accreting systems often show significant variability (10-20percent of accretion luminosity) on timescales much longer than expected forthe disc regions releasing most of the luminosity. we propose an explicitphysical model for disc variability, consistent with lyubarskii's (1997)general scheme for solving this problem. we suggest that local dynamo processescan affect the evolution of an accretion disc by driving angular momentum lossin the form of an outflow (a wind or jet). we model the dynamo as a small-scalestochastic phenomenon, operating on roughly the local dynamical timescale. weargue that large-scale outflow can only occur when the small-scale randomprocesses in neighbouring disc annuli give rise by chance to a coherentlarge-scale magnetic field. this occurs on much longer timescales, and causes abright large-amplitude flare as a wide range of disc radii evolve in a coherentfashion. most of the time, dynamo action instead produces small-amplitudeflickering. we reproduce power spectra similar to those observed, including a1/f power spectrum below a break frequency given by the magnetic alignmenttimescale at the inner disc edge. however the relation between the black holemass and the value of the break frequency is less straightforward than oftenassumed in the literature. the effect of an outer disc edge is to flatten thespectrum below the magnetic alignment frequency there. we also find acorrelation between the variability amplitude and luminosity, similar to thatfound in some agn.

astro-ph;0609418	a fast hybrid algorithm for exoplanetary transit searches	we present a fast and efficient hybrid algorithm for selecting exoplanetarycandidates from wide-field transit surveys. our method is based on thewidely-used sysrem and box least-squares (bls) algorithms. patterns ofsystematic error that are common to all stars on the frame are mapped andeliminated using the sysrem algorithm. the remaining systematic errors causedby spatially localised flat-fielding and other errors are quantified using aboxcar-smoothing method. we show that the dimensions of the search-parameterspace can be reduced greatly by carrying out an initial bls search on a coarsegrid of reduced dimensions, followed by newton-raphson refinement of thetransit parameters in the vicinity of the most significant solutions. weillustrate the method's operation by applying it to data from one field of thesuperwasp survey, comprising 2300 observations of 7840 stars brighter thanv=13.0. we identify 11 likely transit candidates. we reject stars that exhibitsignificant ellipsoidal variations indicative of a stellar-mass companion. weuse colours and proper motions from the 2mass and usno-b1.0 surveys to estimatethe stellar parameters and the companion radius. we find that two stars showingunambiguous transit signals pass all these tests, and so qualify for detailedhigh-resolution spectroscopic follow-up.

astro-ph;0609618	the impact of correlated noise on superwasp detection rates for  transiting extra-solar planets	we present a model of the stellar populations in the fields observed by oneof the superwasp-n cameras in the 2004 observing season. we use the besancongalactic model to define the range of stellar types and metallicities present,and populate these objects with transiting extra-solar planets using themetallicity relation of fischer &amp; valenti (2005).  we investigate the ability of superwasp to detect these planets in thepresence of realistic levels of correlated systematic noise (`red noise'). wefind that the number of planets that transit with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10or more increases linearly with the number of nights of observations. based ona simulation of detection rates across 20 fields observed by one camera, wepredict that a total of 18.6 \pm 8.0 planets should be detectable from thesuperwasp-n 2004 data alone. the best way to limit the impact of co-variantnoise and increase the number of detectable planets is to boost thesignal-to-noise ratio, by increasing the number of observed transits for eachcandidate transiting planet. this requires the observing baseline to beincreased, by spending a second observing season monitoring the same fields.

astro-ph;0611200	magnetically moderated outbursts of wz sagittae	we argue that the quiescent value of the viscosity parameter of the accretiondisc in wz sge may be alpha_{cold}~0.01, in agreement with estimates ofalpha_{cold} for other dwarf novae. assuming the white dwarf in wz sge to bemagnetic, we show that, in quiescence, material close to the white dwarf can bepropelled to larger radii, depleting the inner accretion disc. the propellertherefore has the effect of stabilizing the inner disc and allowing the outerdisc to accumulate mass. the outbursts of wz sge are then regulated by the(magnetically determined) evolution of the surface density of the outer disc ata radius close to the tidal limit. numerical models confirm that the recurrencetime can be significantly extended in this way. the outbursts are expected tobe superoutbursts since the outer disc radius is forced to exceed the tidal(3:1 resonance) radius. the large, quiescent disc is expected to be massive,and to be able to supply the observed mass accretion rate during outburst. wepredict that the long-term spin evolution of the white dwarf spin will involvea long cycle of spin up and spin down phases.
