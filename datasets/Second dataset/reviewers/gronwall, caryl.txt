0903.3948	a population of metal-poor galaxies with ~l* luminosities at  intermediate redshifts	we present new spectroscopy and metallicity estimates for a sample of 15star-forming galaxies with redshifts in the range 0.29 - 0.42. these objectswere selected in the kpno international spectroscopic survey via their strongemission lines seen in red objective-prism spectra. originally thought to beintermediate-redshift seyfert 2 galaxies, our new spectroscopy in the far redhas revealed these objects to be metal-poor star-forming galaxies. thesegalaxies follow a luminosity-metallicity (l-z) relation that parallels the onedefined by low-redshift galaxies, but is offset by a factor of more than ten tolower abundances. the amount of chemical and/or luminosity evolution requiredto place these galaxies on the local l-z relation is extreme, suggesting thatthese galaxies are in a very special stage of their evolution. they may belate-forming massive systems, which would challenge the current paradigm ofgalaxy formation. alternatively, they may represent intense starbursts indwarf-dwarf mergers or a major infall episode of pristine gas into apre-existing galaxy. in any case, these objects represent an extreme stage ofgalaxy evolution taking place at relatively low redshift.

1002.2432	evidence for spatially compact lyman alpha emission in z=3.1  lyman-alpha-emitting galaxies	we present the results of a high-spatial-resolution study of the lineemission in a sample of z=3.1 lyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (laes) in theextended chandra deep field-south. of the eight objects with coverage in ourhst/wfpc2 narrow-band imaging, two have clear detections and an additional twoare barely detected (~2-sigma). the clear detections are within ~0.5 kpc of thecentroid of the corresponding rest-uv continuum source, suggesting that theline-emitting gas and young stars in laes are spatially coincident. thebrightest object exhibits extended emission with a half-light radius of ~1.5kpc, but a stack of the remaining lae surface brightness profiles is consistentwith the wfpc2 point spread function. this suggests that the lyman alphaemission in these objects originates from a compact (&lt;~2 kpc) region and cannotbe significantly more extended than the far-uv continuum emission (&lt;~1 kpc).comparing our wfpc2 photometry to previous ground-based measurements of theirmonochromatic fluxes, we find at 95% (99.7%) confidence that we cannot bemissing more than 22% (32%) of the lyman alpha emission.

1007.4842	the absolute magnitudes of type ia supernovae in the ultraviolet	we examine the absolute magnitudes and light-curve shapes of 14nearby(redshift z = 0.004--0.027) type ia supernovae (sne~ia) observed in theultraviolet (uv) with the swift ultraviolet/optical telescope. colors andabsolute magnitudes are calculated using both a standard milky way (mw)extinction law and one for the large magellanic cloud that has been modified bycircumstellar scattering. we find very different behavior in the near-uvfilters (uvw1_rc covering ~2600-3300 a after removing optical light, and u~3000--4000 a) compared to a mid-uv filter (uvm2 ~2000-2400 a). the uvw1_rc-bcolors show a scatter of ~0.3 mag while uvm2-b scatters by nearly 0.9 mag.similarly, while the scatter in colors between neighboring filters is small inthe optical and somewhat larger in the near-uv, the large scatter in theuvm2-uvw1 colors implies significantly larger spectral variability below 2600a. we find that in the near-uv the absolute magnitudes at peak brightness ofnormal sne ia in our sample are correlated with the optical decay rate with ascatter of 0.4 mag, comparable to that found for the optical in our sample.however, in the mid-uv the scatter is larger, ~1 mag, possibly indicatingdifferences in metallicity. we find no strong correlation between either the uvlight-curve shapes or the uv colors and the uv absolute magnitudes. with largersamples, the uv luminosity might be useful as an additional constraint to helpdetermine distance, extinction, and metallicity in order to improve the utilityof sne ia as standardized candles.

1011.0426	hetdex pilot survey for emission-line galaxies - i. survey design,  performance, and catalog	we present a catalog of emission-line galaxies selected solely by theiremission-line fluxes using a wide-field integral field spectrograph. this workis partially motivated as a pilot survey for the upcoming hobby-eberlytelescope dark energy experiment (hetdex). we describe the observations,reductions, detections, redshift classifications, line fluxes, and counterpartinformation for 397 emission-line galaxies detected over 169 sq.arcmin with a3500-5800 ang. bandpass under 5 ang. full-width-half-maximum (fwhm) spectralresolution. the survey's best sensitivity for unresolved objects underphotometric conditions is between 4-20 e-17 erg/s/sq.cm depending on thewavelength, and ly-alpha luminosities between 3-6 e42 erg/s are detectable.this survey method complements narrowband and color-selection techniques in thesearch for high redshift galaxies with its different selection properties andlarge volume probed. the four survey fields within the cosmos, goods-n, munics,and xmm-lss areas are rich with existing, complementary data. we find 104galaxies via their high redshift ly-alpha emission at 1.9&lt;z&lt;3.8, and themajority of the remainder objects are low redshift [oii]3727 emitters atz&lt;0.56. the classification between low and high redshift objects depends onrest frame equivalent width, as well as other indicators, where available.based on matches to x-ray catalogs, the active galactic nuclei (agn) fractionamongst the ly-alpha emitters (laes) is 6%. we also analyze the survey'scompleteness and contamination properties through simulations. we find fivehigh-z, highly-significant, resolved objects with full-width-half-maximum sizes&gt;44 sq.arcsec which appear to be extended ly-alpha nebulae. we also find threehigh-z objects with rest frame ly-alpha equivalent widths above the levelbelieved to be achievable with normal star formation, ew(rest)&gt;240 ang.

1011.0431	the hetdex pilot survey iii: the low metallicities of high-redshift  lyman alpha galaxies	we present keck/nirspec spectroscopic observations of three lyman alphaemitting galaxies (laes) at z ~ 2.3 discovered with the hetdex pilot survey. wedetect halpha, [oiii], and hbeta emission from two galaxies at z = 2.29 and2.49, designated hps194 and hps256, respectively, representing the firstdetection of multiple rest-frame optical emission lines in galaxies athigh-redshift selected on the basis of their lyman alpha emission. theredshifts of the lyman alpha emission from these galaxies are offset redward ofthe systemic redshifts by delta_v = 162 +/- 37 (photometric) +/- 42(systematic) km/s for hps194, and delta_v = 36 +/- 35 +/- 18 km/s for hps256.an interpretation for hps194 is that a large-scale outflow may be occurring inits interstellar medium. the emission line ratios imply that neither lae hostsan active galactic nucleus. using the upper limits on the [nii] emission weplace meaningful constraints on the gas-phase metallicities in these two laesof z &lt; 0.17 and &lt; 0.28 zsol (1 sigma). measuring the stellar masses of theseobjects via spectral energy distribution (sed) fitting (~ 10^10 and 6 x 10^8msol, respectively), we study the nature of laes in a mass-metallicity plane.at least one of these two laes appears to be more metal poor thancontinuum-selected star-forming galaxies at the same redshift and stellar mass,implying that objects exhibiting lyman alpha emission may be systematicallyless chemically enriched than the general galaxy population. we use the seds ofthese two galaxies to show that neglecting the emission lines when fittingstellar population models to the observed photometry can result inoverestimates of the population age by orders of magnitude, and the stellarmass by a factor of ~ 2. this effect is particularly important at z &gt; 7, wheresimilarly strong emission lines may masquerade in the photometry as a 4000 abreak (abridged).

1101.3017	ly-alpha emitting galaxies at z = 2.1: stellar masses, dust and star  formation histories from spectral energy distribution fitting	we study the physical properties of 216 z ~ 2.1 laes discovered in anultra-deep narrow-band musyc image of the ecdf-s. we fit their stacked spectralenergy distribution (sed) using charlot &amp; bruzual templates. we consider starformation histories parametrized by the e-folding time parameter tau, allowingfor exponentially decreasing (tau&gt;0), exponentially increasing (tau&lt;0), andconstant star formation rates. these laes are characterized by best fitparameters and 68% confidence intervals of log(m_*/m_sun)=8.6[8.4-9.1],e(b-v)=0.22[0.00-0.31], tau=-0.02[(-4)-18] gyr, and age_ sf=0.018[0.009-3] gyr.thus, we obtain robust measurements of low stellar mass and dust content, butwe cannot place meaningful constraints on the age or star formation history ofthe laes. we also calculate the instantaneous sfr to be 35[0.003-170] m_sun/yr,with its average over the last 100 myr before observation giving&lt;sfr&gt;_100=4[2-30] m_sun/yr. when we compare the results for the same starformation history, laes at z~2.1 are dustier and show higher instantaneous sfrsthan z~3.1 laes, while the observed stellar masses of the two samples seemconsistent. laes appear to occupy the low-mass end of the distribution of starforming galaxies at z~2. we perform sed fitting on several sub-samples selectedbased on photometric properties and find that lae sub-samples at z~2.1 exhibitheterogeneous properties. the irac-bright, uv-bright and red laes have thelargest stellar mass and dust reddening. the uv-faint, irac-faint, and highequivalent width lae sub-samples appear less massive (&lt;10^9 m_sun) and lessdusty, with e(b-v) consistent with zero.

1106.2811	x-ray constraints on the lyman-alpha escape fraction	we have coadded x-ray flux of all known lyman alpha emitters (laes) in the 4msec chandra deep field south (cdf-s) region, to place sensitive upper limitson the average unobscured star-formation rate (sfr_x) in these galaxies. a verysmall fraction of lyman-alpha galaxies in the field are individually detectedin the x-rays, implying a low fraction of agn activity. after excluding the fewx-ray detected laes, we stack the undetected laes located in the 4 ms cdf-sdata and 250 ks extended cdf-s (ecdfs) data, and compute a 1-\sigma upper limiton sfr_x &lt; 14, 28, 28, 140, 440, 880 m$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ for laes located at z= 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 4.5, 5.7 and 6.5, respectively. the upper limit of sfr_x inlaes can be then be compared to sfr$_{ly\alpha}$ derived from lyman-alpha lineand thus can constrain on the lyman-alpha escape fraction($f^{esc}_{ly\alpha}$). we derive a lower limit on f(lyman-alpha escape) &gt; 14%(84 % confidence level, 1-\sigma lower limit) for laes at redshift z ~ 2.1 andz ~ 3.1-3.2. at z &gt; 4, the current lae samples are not of sufficient size toconstrain sfr_x well. by averaging all the laes at z&gt; 2, the x-raynon-detection constrains f(lyman-alpha escape) &gt; 17% (84 % confidence level,1-\sigma lower limit), and rejects f(lyman-alpha escape) &lt; 5.7% at the 99.87%confidence level from 2.1 &lt; z &lt; 6.5.

1209.5842	escape of lyman-alpha and continuum photons from star-forming galaxies	a large number of high-redshift galaxies have been discovered via theirnarrow-band lya line or broad-band continuum colors in recent years. the natureof the escaping process of photons from these early galaxies is crucial tounderstanding galaxy evolution and the cosmic reionization. here, weinvestigate the escape of lya, non-ionizing uv-continuum (l = 1300 - 1600angstrom in rest frame), and ionizing photons (l &lt; 912 angstrom) from galaxiesby combining a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation with three-dimensionalmulti-wavelength radiative transfer calculations. the galaxies are simulated ina box of 5^3 h^-3 mpc^3 with high resolutions using the aquila initialcondition which reproduces a milky way-like galaxy at redshift z=0. we findthat the escape fraction (fesc) of these different photons shows a complexdependence on redshift and galaxy properties: fesc(lya) and fesc(uv) appear toevolve with redshift, and they show similar, weak correlations with galaxyproperties such as mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust content, whilefesc(ion) remains roughly constant at ~ 0.2 from z ~ 0 - 10, and it does notshow clear dependence on galaxy properties. fesc(lya) correlates more stronglywith fesc(uv) than with fesc(ion). in addition, we find a relation between theemergent lya luminosity and the ionizing photon emissivity of lyman alphaemitters (laes). by combining this relation with the observed luminosityfunctions of laes at different redshift, we estimate the contribution from laesto the reionization of intergalactic medium (igm). our result suggests thationizing photons from laes alone are not sufficient to ionize igm at z &gt; 6, butthey can maintain the ionization of igm at z ~ 0 - 5.

1209.6253	spatially resolved spectroscopy of the globular cluster rz 2109 and the  nature of its black hole	we present optical hst/stis spectroscopy of rz 2109, a globular cluster inthe elliptical galaxy ngc 4472. this globular cluster is notable for hosting anultraluminous x-ray source as well as associated strong and broad [oiii] 4959,5007 emission. we show that the hst/stis spectroscopy spatially resolves the[oiii] emission in rz 2109. while we are unable to make a precise determinationof the morphology of the emission line nebula, the best fitting models allrequire that the [oiii] 5007 emission has a half light radius in the range 3-7pc. the extended nature of the [oiii] 5007 emission is inconsistent withpublished models that invoke an intermediate mass black hole origin. it is alsoinconsistent with the ionization of ejecta from a nova in the cluster. thespatial scale of the nebula could be produced via the photoionization of astrong wind driven from a stellar mass black hole accreting at roughly itseddington rate.

1212.1151	intragroup and galaxy-linked diffuse x-ray emission in hickson compact  groups	isolated compact groups of galaxies (cgs) present a range of dynamicalstates, group velocity dispersions, and galaxy morphologies with which to studygalaxy evolution, particularly the properties of gas both within the galaxiesand in the intragroup medium. as part of a large, multiwavelength examinationof cgs, we present an archival study of diffuse x-ray emission in a subset ofnine hickson compact groups observed with the chandra x-ray observatory. wefind that seven of the groups in our sample exhibit detectable diffuseemission. however, unlike large-scale emission in galaxy clusters, the diffusefeatures in the majority of the detected groups are linked to the individualgalaxies, in the form of both plumes and halos likely as a result of starformation or agn activity, as well as in emission from tidal features. unlikeprevious studies from earlier x-ray missions, hcgs 31, 42, 59, and 92 are foundto be consistent with the lx-t relationship from clusters within the errors,while hcgs 16 and 31 are consistent with the cluster lx-sigma relation, thoughthis is likely coincidental given that the hot gas in these two systems islargely due to star formation. we find that lx increases with decreasing grouphi to dynamical-mass ratio with tentative evidence for a dependance in x-rayluminosity on hi morphology whereby systems with intragroup hi indicative ofstrong interactions are considerably more x-ray luminous than passivelyevolving groups. we also find a gap in the lx of groups as a function of thetotal group specific star formation rate. our findings suggest that the hot gasin these groups is not in hydrostatic equilibrium and these systems are notlow-mass analogs of rich groups or clusters, with the possible exception of hcg62.

1306.4157	galaxy redshift surveys with sparse sampling	survey observations of the three-dimensional locations of galaxies are apowerful approach to measure the distribution of matter in the universe, whichcan be used to learn about the nature of dark energy, physics of inflation,neutrino masses, etc. a competitive survey, however, requires a large volume(e.g., vsurvey is roughly 10 gpc3) to be covered, and thus tends to beexpensive. a "sparse sampling" method offers a more affordable solution to thisproblem: within a survey footprint covering a given survey volume, vsurvey, weobserve only a fraction of the volume. the distribution of observed regionsshould be chosen such that their separation is smaller than the length scalecorresponding to the wavenumber of interest. then one can recover the powerspectrum of galaxies with precision expected for a survey covering a volume ofvsurvey (rather than the volume of the sum of observed regions) with the numberdensity of galaxies given by the total number of observed galaxies divided byvsurvey (rather than the number density of galaxies within an observed region).we find that regularly-spaced sampling yields an unbiased power spectrum withno window function effect, and deviations from regularly-spaced sampling, whichare unavoidable in realistic surveys, introduce calculable window functioneffects and increase the uncertainties of the recovered power spectrum. whilewe discuss the sparse sampling method within the context of the forthcominghobby-eberly telescope dark energy experiment, the method is general and can beapplied to other galaxy surveys.

1308.1957	the spectrally resolved lyman-alpha emission of three lyman-alpha  selected field galaxies at z~2.4 from the hetdex pilot survey	we present new results on the spectrally resolved lyman-alpha (lya) emissionof three lya emitting field galaxies at z~2.4 with high lya equivalent width(&gt;100 angstroms) and lya luminosity (~10^43 erg/s). at 120 km/s (fwhm) spectralresolution, the prominent double-peaked lya profile straddles the systemicvelocity, where the velocity zero-point is determined from spectroscopy of thegalaxies' rest-frame optical nebular emission lines. the average velocityoffset from systemic of the stronger redshifted emission component for oursample is 176 km/s while the average total separation between the redshiftedand main blueshifted emission components is 380 km/s. these measurements are afactor of ~2 smaller than for uv continuum-selected galaxies that show lya inemission with lower lya equivalent width. we compare our lya spectra to thepredicted line profiles of a spherical "expanding shell" lya radiative transfergrid that models large-scale galaxy outflows. specifically blueward of thesystemic velocity where two galaxies show a weak, highly blueshifted (by ~1000km/s) tertiary emission peak, the model line profiles are a relatively poorrepresentation of the observed spectra. since the neutral gas column densityhas a dominant influence over the shape of the lya line profile, we cautionagainst equating the observed lya velocity offset with a physical outflowvelocity, especially at lower spectral resolution where the unresolved lyavelocity offset is a convoluted function of several degenerate parameters.referring to rest-frame ultraviolet and optical hubble space telescope imaging,we find that galaxy-galaxy interactions may play an important role in inducinga starburst that results in copious lya emission, as well as perturbing the gasdistribution and velocity field which have strong influence over the lyaemission line profile.

1511.00651	the dust attenuation curve versus stellar mass for emission line  galaxies at z ~ 2	we derive the mean wavelength dependence of stellar attenuation in a sampleof 239 high redshift (1.90 &lt; z &lt; 2.35) galaxies selected via hubble spacetelescope (hst) wfc3 ir grism observations of their rest-frame optical emissionlines. our analysis indicates that the average reddening law follows a formsimilar to that derived by calzetti et al. for local starburst galaxies.however, over the mass range 7.2 &lt; log m/msolar &lt; 10.2, the slope of theattenuation law in the uv is shallower than that seen locally, and the uv slopesteepens as the mass increases. these trends are in qualitative agreement withkriek &amp; conroy, who found that the wavelength dependence of attenuation varieswith galaxy spectral type. however, we find no evidence of an extinction "bump"at 2175 a in any of the three stellar mass bins, or in the sample as a whole.we quantify the relation between the attenuation curve and stellar mass anddiscuss its implications.

1511.08243	young, star-forming galaxies and their local counterparts: the evolving  relationship of mass-sfr-metallicity since z ~ 2.1	we explore the evolution of the stellar mass-star formation rate-metallicityrelation using a set of 256 cosmos and goods galaxies in the redshift range1.90 &lt; z &lt; 2.35. we present the galaxies' rest-frame optical emission-linefluxes derived from ir-grism spectroscopy with the hubble space telescope andcombine these data with star formation rates and stellar masses obtained fromdeep, multi-wavelength (rest-frame uv to ir) photometry. we then compare thesemeasurements to those for a local sample of galaxies carefully matched instellar mass (7.5 &lt; log(m*/msol) &lt; 10.5) and star formation rate (-0.5 &lt;log(sfr) &lt; 2.5 in msol yr^-1). we find that the distribution of z ~ 2.1galaxies in stellar mass-sfr-metallicity space is clearly different from thatderived for our sample of similarly bright (l_h\b{eta} &gt; 3 . 10^40 ergs s^-1)local galaxies, and this offset cannot be explained by simple systematicoffsets in the derived quantities. at stellar masses above ~10^9 msol and starformation rates above ~10 msol yr^-1, the z ~ 2.1 galaxies have higher oxygenabundances than their local counterparts, while the opposite is true forlower-mass, lower-sfr systems.

1512.03063	hst emission line galaxies at z ~ 2: comparing physical properties of  lyman alpha and optical emission line selected galaxies	we compare the physical and morphological properties of z ~ 2 lyman-alphaemitting galaxies (laes) identified in the hetdex pilot survey and narrow bandstudies with those of z ~ 2 optical emission line galaxies (oelgs) identifiedvia hst wfc3 infrared grism spectroscopy. both sets of galaxies extend over thesame range in stellar mass (7.5 &lt; logm &lt; 10.5), size (0.5 &lt; r &lt; 3.0 kpc), andstar-formation rate (~1 &lt; sfr &lt; 100). remarkably, a comparison of the mostcommonly used physical and morphological parameters -- stellar mass, half-lightradius, uv slope, star formation rate, ellipticity, nearest neighbor distance,star formation surface density, specific star formation rate, [o iii]luminosity, and [o iii] equivalent width -- reveals no statisticallysignificant differences between the populations. this suggests that theprocesses and conditions which regulate the escape of ly-alpha from a z ~ 2star-forming galaxy do not depend on these quantities. in particular, the lackof dependence on the uv slope suggests that ly-alpha emission is not beingsignificantly modulated by diffuse dust in the interstellar medium. we developa simple model of ly-alpha emission that connects laes to all high-redshiftstar forming galaxies where the escape of ly-alpha depends on the sightlinethrough the galaxy. using this model, we find that mean solid angle forly-alpha escape is 2.4+/-0.8 steradians; this value is consistent with thosecalculated from other studies.

astro-ph;0110456	a measurement of the contamination in [oiii] lambda 5007 surveys of  intracluster stars and the surface density of z=3.13 ly-alpha galaxies	we present two pieces of evidence supporting the hypothesis that the bright[oiii] lambda 5007 sources found in virgo's intracluster space are intraclusterplanetary nebulae, rather than [oii] lambda 3727 galaxies at z ~ 0.35 orly-alpha sources at z ~ 3.13. first, we confirm the nature of five``overluminous'' [oiii] sources that are postulated to lie in front of m87: byexamining the composite spectrum of these objects, we show that the weaker[oiii] line at lambda 4959 is definitely present at a strength ~ 1/3 that of[oiii] lambda 5007. the ratio demonstrates that, at most, only one of the fiveobjects is a background galaxy. we then estimate the surface density ofbackground emission-line objects by conducting a wide-field (0.13 deg^2) searchat lambda 5019 for faint emission line sources in a ``blank field'' locatedwell away from any galaxy or cluster. we show that the density of blank fieldemission-line sources is significantly lower than the density of sourcesdetected between the galaxies of virgo, but in good agreement with the densityof ly-alpha galaxies found by hu, cowie, &amp; mcmahon(1998). the implication isthat background galaxies only account for ~20% of the planetary nebulacandidates in virgo's intracluster fields.

astro-ph;0208482	hi properties of low luminosity star-forming galaxies in the kpno  international spectroscopic survey	new hi observations are presented for a complete sample of 109 low luminositystar-forming galaxies taken from the kpno international spectroscopic survey(kiss), the first ccd-based wide-field objective-prism survey for emission-linegalaxies. this sample consists of all star-forming galaxies with m_b &gt; -18.0and cz &lt; 11,000 km/s from the first halpha-selected survey list. overall, 97out of 109 galaxies have been detected in hi. we confirm the weak trend ofincreasing gas richness with decreasing luminosity found by previous authors.gas richness is also shown to be weakly anti-correlated with metallicity. thedependence of star formation rates (sfrs) and hi gas depletion timescales onmetallicity is examined. the median solar metallicity based sfr and gasdepletion timescale are 0.1639 m_sun/yr and 5 gyrs, respectively. correctionsfor variations in metallicity decreases sfrs by about 0.5 dex and increases gasdepletion timescales by an average of about 8 gyrs. the majority of galaxies inthis sample still have large reservoirs of hi gas, and despite their largecurrent star formation rates, could have formed stars in a quasi-continuousmanner for a hubble time. finally, we present the first hi mass function forlow luminosity star-forming galaxies and show that this subpopulationcontributes 10-15% of the overall hi density in the local universe. we concludethat if the hi mass function of the universe does indeed have a steeply risinglow-mass slope as suggested by previous authors, it is not due to thepopulation of low luminosity star-forming galaxies.

(1996) to provide a high-redshift tully-fisher relation thatspans three magnitudes. this sample was selected primarily by morphology andmagnitude, rather than color or spectral features. we find no obvious change inthe shape or slope of the relation with respect to the local tully-fisherrelation. the small offset of &lt; 0.4 b mag with respect to the local relation ispresumably caused by luminosity evolution in the field galaxy population, anddoes not correlate with galaxy mass. a comparison of disk surface brightnessbetween local and high-redshift samples yields a similar offset, ~0.6 mag.these results provide further evidence for only a modest increase in luminositywith lookback time.
