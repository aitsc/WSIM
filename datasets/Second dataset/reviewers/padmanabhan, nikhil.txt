0905.0479	a critical look at cosmological perturbation theory techniques	recently a number of analytic prescriptions for computing the non-linearmatter power spectrum have appeared in the literature. these typically involveresummation or closure prescriptions which do not have a rigorous errorcontrol, thus they must be compared with numerical simulations to assess theirrange of validity. we present a direct side-by-side comparison of several ofthese analytic approaches, using a suite of high-resolution n-body simulationsas a reference, and discuss some general trends. all of the analytic resultscorrectly predict the behavior of the power spectrum at the onset ofnon-linearity, and improve upon a pure linear theory description at very largescales. all of these theories fail at sufficiently small scales. at lowredshift the dynamic range in scale where perturbation theory is both relevantand reliable can be quite small. we also compute for the first time the 2-loopcontribution to standard perturbation theory for cdm models, finding improvedagreement with simulations at large redshift. at low redshifts however the2-loop term is larger than the 1-loop term on quasi-linear scales, indicating abreakdown of the perturbation expansion. finally, we comment on possibleimplications of our results for future studies.

0906.1198	calibrating the baryon oscillation ruler for matter and halos	we characterize the nonlinear evolution of the baryon acoustic feature astraced by the dark matter and halos, using a combination of perturbation theoryand n-body simulations. we confirm that the acoustic peak traced by the darkmatter is both broadened and shifted as structure forms, and that this shift iswell described by second-order perturbation theory. these shifts persist fordark matter halos, and are a simple function of halo bias, with the shift(mostly) increasing with increasing bias. extending our perturbation theoryresults to halos with simple two parameter bias models (both in lagrangian andeulerian space) quantitatively explains the observed shifts. in particular, wedemonstrate that there are additional terms that contribute to the shift thatare absent for the matter. at z=0 for currently favored cosmologies, the mattershows shifts of ~0.5%, b=1 halos shift the acoustic scale by ~0.2%, while b=2halos shift it by ~0.5%; these shifts decrease by the square of the growthfactor at higher redshifts. these results are easily generalized to galaxieswithin the halo model, where we show that simple galaxy models show marginallylarger shifts than the correspondingly biased halos, due to the contribution ofsatellites in high mass halos. while our focus here is on real space, ourresults make specific predictions for redshift space. for currently favoredcosmological models, we find that the shifts for halos at z=0 increase by~0.3%; at high z, they increase by ~0.5% d^2. our results demonstrate thatthese theoretical systematics are smaller than the statistical precision ofupcoming surveys, even if one ignored the corrections discussed here. simplemodeling, along the lines discussed here, has the potential to reduce thesesystematics to below the levels of cosmic variance limited surveys.

0910.5005	high-precision predictions for the acoustic scale in the non-linear  regime	we measure shifts of the acoustic scale due to nonlinear growth and redshiftdistortions to a high precision using a very large volume ofhigh-force-resolution simulations. we compare results from various sets ofsimulations that differ in their force, volume, and mass resolution. we find aconsistency within 1.5-sigma for shift values from different simulations andderive shift alpha(z) -1 = (0.300\pm 0.015)% [d(z)/d(0)]^{2} using our fiducialset. we find a strong correlation with a non-unity slope between shifts in realspace and in redshift space and a weak correlation between the initial redshiftand low redshift. density-field reconstruction not only removes the mean shiftsand reduces errors on the mean, but also tightens the correlations: afterreconstruction, we recover a slope of near unity for the correlation betweenthe real and redshift space and restore a strong correlation between the lowand the initial redshifts. we derive propagators and mode-coupling terms fromour n-body simulations and compared with zeldovich approximation and the shiftsmeasured from the chi^2 fitting, respectively. we interpret the propagator andthe mode-coupling term of a nonlinear density field in the context of anaverage and a dispersion of its complex fourier coefficients relative to thoseof the linear density field; from these two terms, we derive a signal-to-noiseratio of the acoustic peak measurement. we attempt to improve ourreconstruction method by implementing 2lpt and iterative operations: we obtainlittle improvement. the fisher matrix estimates of uncertainty in the acousticscale is tested using 5000 (gpc/h)^3 of cosmological pm simulations fromtakahashi et al. (2009). (abridged)

0911.2260	testing adiabatic contraction with sdss elliptical galaxies	we study the profiles of 75 086 elliptical galaxies from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) at both large (50-500 kpc/h) and small (~3 kpc/h) scales.weak lensing observations in the outskirts of the halo are combined withmeasurements of the stellar velocity dispersion in the interior regions of thegalaxy for stacked galaxy samples. the weak lensing measurements are wellcharacterized by a navarro, frenk and white (nfw) profile. the dynamical massmeasurements exceed the extrapolated nfw profile even after the estimatedstellar masses are subtracted, providing evidence for the modification of thedark matter profile by the baryons. this excess mass is quantitativelyconsistent with the predictions of the adiabatic contraction (ac) hypothesis.our finding suggests that the effects of ac during galaxy formation are stableto subsequent bombardment from major and minor mergers. we explore severaltheoretical and observational systematics and conclude that they cannot accountfor the inferred mass excess. the most significant source of systematic erroris in the imf, which would have to increase the stellar mass estimates by afactor of two relative to masses from the kroupa imf to fully explain the massexcess without ac. such an increase would create tension with results fromsauron (cappellari et al. 2006). we demonstrate a connection between the levelof contraction of the dark matter halo profile and scatter in thesize-luminosity relation, which is a projection of the fundamental plane.whether or not ac is the mechanism supplying the excess mass, models of galaxyformation and evolution must reconcile the observed halo masses from weaklensing with the comparatively large dynamical masses at the half light radiiof the galaxies.

0708.0004	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: color and luminosity dependence of  galaxy clustering at z~1	we present measurements of the color and luminosity dependence of galaxyclustering at z~1 in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey. using volume-limitedsubsamples in bins of both color and luminosity, we find that: 1) theclustering dependence is much stronger with color than with luminosity and isas strong with color at z~1 as is found locally. we find no dependence of theclustering amplitude on color for galaxies on the red sequence, but asignificant dependence on color for galaxies within the blue cloud. 2) forgalaxies in the range l/l*~0.7-2, a stronger large-scale luminosity dependenceis seen for all galaxies than for red and blue galaxies separately. thesmall-scale clustering amplitude depends significantly on luminosity for bluegalaxies, with brighter samples having a stronger rise on scales r_p&lt;0.5 mpc/h.3) redder galaxies exhibit stronger small-scale redshift-space distortions("fingers of god"), and both red and blue populations show large-scaledistortions in xi(r_p,pi) due to coherent infall. 4) while the clusteringlength, r_0, increases smoothly with galaxy color (in narrow bins), itspower-law exponent, gamma, exhibits a sharp jump from the blue cloud to the redsequence. the intermediate color `green' galaxy population likely includestransitional galaxies moving from the blue cloud to the red sequence; on largescales green galaxies are as clustered as red galaxies but show infallkinematics and a small-scale correlation slope akin to the blue galaxypopulation. 5) we compare our results to a semi-analytic galaxy formation modelapplied to the millenium run simulation. differences between the data and themodel suggest that in the model star formation is shut down too efficiently insatellite galaxies.

1105.2320	ameliorating systematic uncertainties in the angular clustering of  galaxies: a study using sdss-iii	we investigate the effects of potential sources of systematic error on theangular and photometric redshift, z_phot, distributions of a sample of redshift0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 massive galaxies whose selection matches that of the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) constant mass sample. utilizing over112,778 boss spectra as a training sample, we produce a photometric redshiftcatalog for the galaxies in the sdss dr8 imaging area that, after masking,covers nearly one quarter of the sky (9,913 square degrees). we investigatefluctuations in the number density of objects in this sample as a function ofgalactic extinction, seeing, stellar density, sky background, airmass,photometric offset, and north/south galactic hemisphere. we find that thepresence of stars of comparable magnitudes to our galaxies (which are nottraditionally masked) effectively remove area. failing to correct for suchstars can produce systematic errors on the measured angular auto-correlationfunction, w, that are larger than its statistical uncertainty. we describe howone can effectively mask for the presence of the stars, without removing anygalaxies from the sample, and minimize the systematic error. additionally, weapply two separate methods that can be used to correct the systematic errorsimparted by any parameter that can be turned into a map on the sky. we findthat failing to properly account for varying sky background introduces asystematic error on w. we measure w, in four z_phot slices of width 0.05between 0.45 &lt; z_phot &lt; 0.65 and find that the measurements, after correctingfor the systematic effects of stars and sky background, are generallyconsistent with a generic lambdacdm model, at scales up to 60 degrees. atscales greater than 3 degrees and z_phot &gt; 0.5, the magnitude of thecorrections we apply are greater than the statistical uncertainty in w.

1106.1642	the dark matter haloes and host galaxies of mgii absorbers at z~1	strong foreground absorption features from singly-ionized magnesium (mg ii)are commonly observed in the spectra of quasars and are presumed to probe awide range of galactic environments. to date, measurements of the average darkmatter halo masses of intervening mg ii absorbers by way of large-scalecross-correlations with luminous galaxies have been limited to z&lt;0.7. in thiswork we cross-correlate 21 strong (w{\lambda}2796&gt;0.6 {\deg}a) mg ii absorptionsystems detected in quasar spectra from the sloan digital sky survey datarelease 7 with ~32,000 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.45 fromthe deep2 galaxy redshift survey. we measure dark matter (dm) halo biases ofb_g=1.44\pm0.02 and b_a=1.49\pm0.45 for the deep2 galaxies and mg ii absorbers,respectively, indicating that their clustering amplitudes are roughlyconsistent. haloes with the bias we measure for the mg ii absorbers have acorresponding mass of 1.8(+4.2/-1.6) \times 10^12h-1m_sun, although the actualmean absorber halo mass will depend on the precise distribution of absorberswithin dm haloes. this mass estimate is consistent with observations at z=0.6,suggesting that the halo masses of typical mg ii absorbers do not significantlyevolve from z~1. we additionally measure the average w{\lambda}2796&gt;0.6 \aa gascovering fraction to be f =0.5 within 60 h-1kpc around the deep2 galaxies, andwe find an absence of coincident strong mg ii absorption beyond a projectedseparation of ~40 h-1kpc. although the star-forming z&gt;1 deep2 galaxies areknown to exhibit ubiquitous blueshifted mg ii absorption, we find no directevidence in our small sample linking w{\lambda}2796&gt;0.6 \aa absorbers togalaxies with ongoing star formation.

1202.0090	a 2% distance to z=0.35 by reconstructing baryon acoustic oscillations -  i : methods and application to the sloan digital sky survey	we apply the reconstruction technique to the clustering of galaxies from thesdss dr7 lrg sample, sharpening the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) featureand achieving a 1.9% measurement of the distance to z=0.35. this is the firstapplication of reconstruction of the bao feature in a galaxy redshift survey.we update the reconstruction algorithm of eisenstein et al, 2007 to account forthe effects of survey geometry as well as redshift-space distortions andvalidate it on 160 lasdamas simulations. we demonstrate that reconstructionsharpens the bao feature in the angle averaged galaxy correlation function,reducing the nonlinear smoothing scale \sigma_nl from 8.1 mpc/h to 4.4 mpc/h.reconstruction also significantly reduces the effects of redshift-spacedistortions at the bao scale, isotropizing the correlation function. thissharpened bao feature yields an unbiased distance estimate (&lt; 0.2%) and reducesthe scatter from 3.3% to 2.1%. we demonstrate the robustness of these resultsto the various reconstruction parameters, including the smoothing scale, thegalaxy bias and the linear growth rate. applying this reconstruction algorithmto the sdss lrg dr7 sample improves the significance of the bao feature inthese data from 3.3 sigma for the unreconstructed correlation function, to 4.2sigma after reconstruction. we estimate a relative distance scale d_v/r_s toz=0.35 of 8.88+/-0.17, where r_s is the sound horizon and d_v = (d_a^2/h)^{1/3}is a combination of the angular diameter distance d_a and hubble parameter h.assuming a sound horizon of 154.25 mpc, this translates into a distancemeasurement d_v (z=0.35) = 1.356+/-0.025 gpc. we find that reconstructionreduces the distance error in the dr7 sample from 3.5% to 1.9%, equivalent to asurvey with three times the volume of sdss.

1203.6641	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: measurements of the growth of structure and expansion  rate at z=0.57 from anisotropic clustering	we analyze the anisotropic clustering of massive galaxies from the sloandigital sky survey iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) datarelease 9 (dr9) sample, which consists of 264,283 galaxies in the redshiftrange 0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 spanning 3,275 square degrees. both peculiar velocitiesand errors in the assumed redshift-distance relation ("alcock-paczynskieffect") generate correlations between clustering amplitude and orientationwith respect to the line-of-sight. together with the sharp baryon acousticoscillation (bao) standard ruler, our measurements of the broadband shape ofthe monopole and quadrupole correlation functions simultaneously constrain thecomoving angular diameter distance (2190 +/- 61 mpc) to z=0.57, the hubbleexpansion rate at z=0.57 (92.4 +/- 4.5 km/s/mpc), and the growth rate ofstructure at that same redshift (d sigma8/d ln a = 0.43 +/- 0.069). ouranalysis provides the best current direct determination of both da and h ingalaxy clustering data using this technique. if we further assume a lcdmexpansion history, our growth constraint tightens to d sigma8/d ln a = 0.415+/- 0.034. in combination with the cosmic microwave background, ourmeasurements of da, h, and growth all separately require dark energy at z &gt;0.57, and when combined imply \omega_{\lambda} = 0.74 +/- 0.016, independent ofthe universe's evolution at z&lt;0.57. in our companion paper (samushia et al.prep), we explore further cosmological implications of these observations.

1207.7326	spectral classification and redshift measurement for the sdss-iii baryon  oscillation spectroscopic survey	(abridged) we describe the automated spectral classification, redshiftdetermination, and parameter measurement pipeline in use for the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) of the sloan digital sky survey iii(sdss-iii) as of data release 9, encompassing 831,000 moderate-resolutionoptical spectra. we give a review of the algorithms employed, and describe thechanges to the pipeline that have been implemented for boss relative toprevious sdss-i/ii versions, including new sets of stellar, galaxy, and quasarredshift templates. for the color-selected cmass sample of massive galaxies atredshift 0.4 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 0.8 targeted by boss for the purposes of large-scalecosmological measurements, the pipeline achieves an automated classificationsuccess rate of 98.7% and confirms 95.4% of unique cmass targets as galaxies(with the balance being mostly m stars). based on visual inspections of asubset of boss galaxies, we find that ~0.2% of confidently reported cmasssample classifications and redshifts are incorrect, and ~0.4% of all cmassspectra are objects unclassified by the current algorithm which are potentiallyrecoverable. the boss pipeline confirms that ~51.5% of the quasar targets havequasar spectra, with the balance mainly consisting of stars. statistical (asopposed to systematic) redshift errors propagated from photon noise aretypically a few tens of km/s for both galaxies and quasars, with a significanttail to a few hundreds of km/s for quasars. we test the accuracy of thesestatistical redshift error estimates using repeat observations, finding themunderestimated by a factor of 1.19 to 1.34 for galaxies, and by a factor of 2for quasars. we assess the impact of sky-subtraction quality, s/n, and otherfactors on galaxy redshift success. finally, we document known issues, anddescribe directions of ongoing development.

1409.2750	coming of age in the dark sector: how dark matter haloes grow their  gravitational potential wells	we present a detailed study of how dark matter haloes assemble their mass andgrow their (central) potential well. we characterize these via their massaccretion histories (mahs) and potential well growth histories (pwghs), whichwe extract from the bolshoi simulation and from semi-analytical merger treessupplemented with a method to compute the maximum circular velocity, vmax, ofprogenitor haloes. the results of both methods are in excellent agreement, bothin terms of the average and the scatter. we show that the mah and pwgh aretightly correlated, and that growth of the central potential precedes theassembly of mass; the maximum circular velocity is already half the present dayvalue by the time the halo has accreted only 2 percent of its final mass.finally, we demonstrate that mahs have a universal form, which we use todevelop a new and improved universal model that can be used to compute theaverage or median mah and pwgh for a halo of any mass in any lcdm cosmology,without having to run a numerical simulation or a set of halo merger trees.

1411.1074	cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)  measurements	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energymodels from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) measurementswith cosmic microwave background (cmb) and type ia supernova (sn) data. we takeadvantage of high-precision bao measurements from galaxy clustering and thely-alpha forest (lyaf) in the boss survey of sdss-iii. bao data alone yield ahigh confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the cmbangular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. combining baoand sn data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of$h_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/mpc. this measurement assumes standard pre-recombinationphysics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,so agreement with cmb-based estimates that assume a flat lcdm cosmology is animportant corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. for open lcdm, ourbao+sn+cmb combination yields $\omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature$\omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. when we allow more general forms of evolving darkenergy, the bao+sn+cmb parameter constraints remain consistent with flat lcdm.while the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the lyaf baomeasurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at highredshifts remain consistent with our constraints. expansion history aloneyields an upper limit of 0.56 ev on the summed mass of neutrino species,improving to 0.26 ev if we include planck cmb lensing. standard dark energymodels constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that ishigh compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.

1501.00963	the eleventh and twelfth data releases of the sloan digital sky survey:  final data from sdss-iii	the third generation of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss-iii) took datafrom 2008 to 2014 using the original sdss wide-field imager, the original andan upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a new near-infraredhigh-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical interferometer. all the datafrom sdss-iii are now made public. in particular, this paper describes datarelease 11 (dr11) including all data acquired through 2013 july, and datarelease 12 (dr12) adding data acquired through 2014 july (including all dataincluded in previous data releases), marking the end of sdss-iii observing.relative to our previous public release (dr10), dr12 adds one million newspectra of galaxies and quasars from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples thenumber of h-band spectra of stars as part of the apache point observatory (apo)galactic evolution experiment (apogee), and includes repeated accurate radialvelocity measurements of 5500 stars from the multi-object apo radial velocityexoplanet large-area survey (marvels). the apogee outputs now include measuredabundances of 15 different elements for each star. in total, sdss-iii added2350 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of thesloan exploration of galactic understanding and evolution 2 (segue-2) survey;2,497,484 boss spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 apogee spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040marvels spectra of 5,513 stars. since its first light in 1998, sdss has imagedover 1/3 of the celestial sphere in five bands and obtained over five millionastronomical spectra.

0704.0655	exploring the variable sky with the sloan digital sky survey	we quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using acatalog based on multiple sdss imaging observations. the catalog covers sdssstripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the sdss ugrizsystem for 1.4 million unresolved sources. in each photometric bandpass wecompute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select andstudy variable sources. we find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighterthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the gand r bands. the majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (&lt;2)quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adoptedflux-limited sample. we find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method forfinding low-redshift quasars as is the uv excess color selection (at highgalactic latitudes). we analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness forquasars and find that is centered on zero. we find that about 1/4 of thevariable stars are rr lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the mainstellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. the distribution oflightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellarlocus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with algol-likebehavior). using over six hundred rr lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halosubstructure out to distances of 100 kpc. we extrapolate these results toexpected performance by the large synoptic survey telescope and estimate thatit will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 millionlow-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.

1505.04798	assessing colour-dependent occupation statistics inferred from galaxy  group catalogues	we investigate the ability of current implementations of galaxy group findersto recover colour-dependent halo occupation statistics. to test the fidelity ofgroup catalogue inferred statistics, we run three different group finders usedin the literature over a mock that includes galaxy colours in a realisticmanner. overall, the resulting mock group catalogues are remarkably similar,and most colour-dependent statistics are recovered with reasonable accuracy.however, it is also clear that certain systematic errors arise as a consequenceof correlated errors in group membership determination, central/satellitedesignation, and halo mass assignment. we introduce a new statistic, the halotransition probability (htp), which captures the combined impact of all theseerrors. as a rule of thumb, errors tend to equalize the properties of distinctgalaxy populations (i.e. red vs. blue galaxies or centrals vs. satellites), andto result in inferred occupation statistics that are more accurate for redgalaxies than for blue galaxies. a statistic that is particularly poorlyrecovered from the group catalogues is the red fraction of central galaxies asfunction of halo mass. group finders do a good job in recovering galacticconformity, but also have a tendency to introduce weak conformity when none ispresent. we conclude that proper inference of colour-dependent statistics fromgroup catalogues is best achieved using forward modelling (i.e., running groupfinders over mock data), or by implementing a correction scheme based on thehtp, as long as the latter is not too strongly model-dependent.

0805.3580	constraints on local primordial non-gaussianity from large scale  structure	recent work has shown that the local non-gaussianity parameter f_nl induces ascale-dependent bias, whose amplitude is growing with scale. here we firstrederive this result within the context of peak-background split formalism andshow that it only depends on the assumption of universality of mass function,assuming halo bias only depends on mass. we then use extended press-schechterformalism to argue that this assumption may be violated and the scale dependentbias will depend on other properties, such as merging history of halos. inparticular, in the limit of recent mergers we find the effect is suppressed.next we use these predictions in conjunction with a compendium of large scaledata to put a limit on the value of f_nl. when combining all data assuming thathalo occupation depends only on halo mass, we get a limit of -29 ~ (-65)&lt; f_nl&lt; +70 ~(+93) at 95% (99.7%) confidence. while we use a wide range of datasets,our combined result is dominated by the signal from the sdss photometric quasarsample. if the latter are modeled as recent mergers then the limits weaken to-31 ~(-96) &lt; f_nl &lt; +70 ~ (+96) . these limits are comparable to the strongestcurrent limits from the wmap 5 year analysis, with no evidence of a positivesignal in f_nl. while the method needs to be thoroughly tested against largescale structure simulations with realistic quasar and galaxy formation models,our results indicate that this is a competitive method relative to cmb andshould be further pursued both observationally and theoretically.

1509.06417	the scale-dependence of halo assembly bias	the two-point clustering of dark matter halos is influenced by haloproperties besides mass, a phenomenon referred to as halo assembly bias. usingthe depth of the gravitational potential well, $v_{\rm max}$, as our secondaryhalo property, in this paper we present the first study of the scale-dependenceassembly bias. in the large-scale linear regime, $r\geq10h^{-1}{\rm mpc},$ ourfindings are in keeping with previous results. in particular, at the low-massend ($m_{\rm vir}&lt;m_{\rm coll}\approx10^{12.5}{\rm m}_{\odot}$), halos withhigh-$v_{\rm max}$ show stronger large-scale clustering relative to halos withlow-$v_{\rm max}$ of the same mass, this trend weakens and reverses for $m_{\rmvir}\geq m_{\rm coll}.$ in the nonlinear regime, assembly bias in low-masshalos exhibits a pronounced scale-dependent "bump" at $500h^{-1}{\rmkpc}-5h^{-1}{\rm mpc},$ a new result. this feature weakens and eventuallyvanishes for halos of higher mass. we show that this scale-dependent signaturecan primarily be attributed to a special subpopulation of ejected halos,defined as present-day host halos that were previously members of a higher-masshalo at some point in their past history. a corollary of our results is thatgalaxy clustering on scales of $r\sim1-2h^{-1}{\rm mpc}$ can be impacted by upto $\sim15\%$ by the choice of the halo property used in the halo model, evenfor stellar mass-limited samples.

1509.06529	sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey data release 12: galaxy  target selection and large scale structure catalogues	the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), part of the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) iii project, has provided the largest survey of galaxyredshifts available to date, in terms of both the number of galaxy redshiftsmeasured by a single survey, and the effective cosmological volume covered. keyto analysing the clustering of these data to provide cosmological measurementsis understanding the detailed properties of this sample. potential issuesinclude variations in the target catalogue caused by changes either in thetargeting algorithm or properties of the data used, the pattern ofspectroscopic observations, the spatial distribution of targets for whichredshifts were not obtained, and variations in the target sky density due toobservational systematics. we document here the target selection algorithmsused to create the galaxy samples that comprise boss. we also present thealgorithms used to create large scale structure catalogues for the final datarelease (dr12) samples and the associated random catalogues that quantify thesurvey mask. the algorithms are an evolution of those used by the boss team toconstruct catalogues from earlier data, and have been designed to accuratelyquantify the galaxy sample. the code used, designated mksample, is releasedwith this paper.

1512.01241	estimating sparse precision matrices	we apply a method recently introduced to the statistical literature todirectly estimate the precision matrix from an ensemble of samples drawn from acorresponding gaussian distribution. motivated by the observation thatcosmological precision matrices are often approximately sparse, the methodallows one to exploit this sparsity of the precision matrix to more quicklyconverge to an asymptotic 1/sqrt(nsim) rate while simultaneously providing anerror model for all of the terms. such an estimate can be used as the startingpoint for further regularization efforts which can improve upon the1/sqrt(nsim) limit above, and incorporating such additional steps isstraightforward within this framework. we demonstrate the technique with toymodels and with an example motivated by large-scale structure two-pointanalysis, showing significant improvements in the rate of convergence.for thelarge-scale structure example we find errors on the precision matrix which arefactors of 5 smaller than for the sample precision matrix for thousands ofsimulations or, alternatively, convergence to the same error level with morethan an order of magnitude fewer simulations.

astro-ph;0012253	weak lensing constraints on cluster structural parameters	we study the reliability of dark matter (dm) profile determinations for richclusters of galaxies based on weak gravitational lensing measurements. weconsider three functional forms for the mass distribution: a softenedisothermal sphere (sis), the navarro, frenk, &amp; white model (nfw) and theklypin, kravstov, bullock, &amp; primack model (kkbp). a maximum likelihoodparametric method is developed and applied to simulated images of backgroundgalaxies (z=2.0) lensed by clusters at z=0.2, 0.5, and 0.8. the images havefield size (~10 arcmin) and angular resolution (~0.5 arcsec) characteristic ofthe new generation of 8-10 meter-class ground-based telescopes. the methodrecovers the correct virial mass of the dm halo, m_{200}, to within ~10% at allredshifts. the recovered values of \delta_c and r_s are only accurate to ~25%;however, their correlated errors are such that greater accuracy is obtained forthe mass. clusters with an sis density profile are recognized by the method,while nfw and kkbp clusters are recognized as not being sis. the method doesnot discriminate between nfw and kkbp profiles for clusters of a given mass,because they are too similar in their outer regions. strongly lensed arcs nearthe cluster centers would be needed to distinguish nfw from kkbp.

astro-ph;0204055	stellar masses and star formation histories for 10^5 galaxies from the  sloan digital sky survey	we develop a new method to constrain the star formation histories, dustattenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. it is based on two stellarabsorption line indices, the 4000 angstrom break strength and the balmerabsorption line index hdelta_a. together, these indices allow us to constrainthe mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed inbursts over the past few gyr. a comparison with broad band photometry thenyields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. we generate a largelibrary of monte carlo realizations of different star formation histories,including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. we usethis library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions,dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios fora sample of 122,208 galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey. thetypical 95% confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +-40%. we studyhow the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolutemagnitude, concentration index and photometric pass-band and how dustattenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000 angstrom breakstrength. we also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present universeis distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration,colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. we find that most of thestellar mass in the local universe resides in galaxies that have stellar masses\~5\times 10^10 m_sol, half light radii ~3 kpc, and half- light surface massdensities ~10^9 m_sol/kpc^2. the distribution of d(4000) is strongly bimodal,showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar populationsand galaxies with more recent star formation.

astro-ph;0407594	calibrating photometric redshifts of luminous red galaxies	we discuss the construction of a photometric redshift catalogue of luminousred galaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), emphasizing theprincipal steps necessary for constructing such a catalogue -- (i)photometrically selecting the sample, (ii) measuring photometric redshifts andtheir error distributions, (iii) and estimating the true redshift distribution.we compare two photometric redshift algorithms for these data and find thatthey give comparable results. calibrating against the sdss and sdss-2dfspectroscopic surveys, we find that the photometric redshift accuracy is$\sigma \sim 0.03$ for redshifts less than 0.55 and worsens at higher redshift($\sim 0.06$). these errors are caused by photometric scatter, as well assystematic errors in the templates, filter curves, and photometric zeropoints.we also parametrize the photometric redshift error distribution with a sum ofgaussians, and use this model to deconvolve the errors from the measuredphotometric redshift distribution to estimate the true redshift distribution.we pay special attention to the stability of this deconvolution, regularizingthe method with a prior on the smoothness of the true redshift distribution.the methods we develop are applicable to general photometric redshift surveys.
