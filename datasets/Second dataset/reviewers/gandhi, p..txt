0902.2777	resolving the mid-infrared cores of local seyferts	we present new photometry of 16 local seyferts including 6 compton-thicksources in n-band filters around 12-microns, obtained with the visir instrumenton the 8-m very large telescope. the near-diffraction-limited imaging providesthe least-contaminated core fluxes for these sources to date. augmenting thesewith our previous observations and with published intrinsic x-ray fluxes, weform a total sample of 42 sources for which we find a strong mid-infrared:x-ray(12.3 micron:2-10 kev) luminosity correlation. performing aphysically-motivated sub-selection of sources in which the seyfert torus islikely to be best-resolved results in the correlation l_{mir} ~l_x^{1.11+/-0.07}, with a reduction of the scatter in luminosities as comparedto the full sample. consideration of systematics suggests a range of 1.02-1.21for the correlation slope. the mean 2 kev:12.3 micron spectral index (alpha_ix)is found to be -1.10+/-0.01, largely independent of luminosity. observed12-micron bolometric corrections range over ~10-30 if a known luminosity trendof intrinsic x-ray bolometric corrections is assumed. comparison with iso dataspanning a larger luminosity range suggests that our correlation can beextended into the quasar regime. the fact that unobscured, obscured andcompton-thick sources all closely follow the same luminosity correlation hasimportant implications for the structures of seyfert cores. the typicalresolution-limit of our imaging corresponds to ~70 pc at a median z=0.01, andthe tightness of the correlation constrains any residual star-formation withinthese physical scales, for which we infer a mean upper-limit of &lt;~40% of theremaining unresolved flux. we suggest that uncontaminated mid-ir continuumimaging of agn is an accurate proxy for their intrinsic power.

0910.5256	the power output of local obscured and unobscured agn: crossing the  absorption barrier with swift/bat and iras	the swift/bat 9-month catalogue of active galactic nuclei (agn) provides anunbiased census of local supermassive black hole accretion, and probes to allbut the highest levels of absorption in agn. we explore a method forcharacterising the bolometric output of both obscured and unobscured agn bycombining the hard x-ray data from swift/bat (14-195kev) with the reprocessedir emission as seen with the iras all-sky surveys. this approach bypasses thecomplex modifications to the sed introduced by absorption in the optical, uvand 0.1-10 kev regimes and provides a long-term, average picture of thebolometric output of these sources. we broadly follow the approach of pozzi etal. for calculating the bolometric luminosities by adding nuclear ir and hardx-ray luminosities, and consider different approaches for removing non-nuclearcontamination in the large-aperture iras fluxes. using mass estimates from them_bh-l_bulge relation, we present the eddington ratios \lambda_edd and 2-10 kevbolometric corrections for a subsample of 63 agn (35 obscured and 28unobscured) from the swift/bat catalogue, and confirm previous indications of alow eddington ratio distribution for both samples. importantly, we find atendency for low bolometric corrections (typically 10-30) for the obscured agnin the sample (with a possible rise from ~15 for \lambda_edd&lt;0.03 to ~32 abovethis), providing a hitherto unseen window onto accretion processes in thisclass of agn. this finding is of key importance in calculating the expectedlocal black hole mass density from the x-ray background since it is composed ofemission from a significant population of such obscured agn. analogous studieswith high resolution ir data and a range of alternative models for the torusemission will form useful future extensions to this work.

0911.2306	is the black hole in gx 339-4 really spinning rapidly?	the wide-band suzaku spectra of the black hole binary gx 339-4, acquired in2007 february during the very high state, were reanalyzed. effects of eventpileup (significant within ~ 3' of the image center) and telemetry saturationof the xis data were carefully considered. the source was detected up to ~ 300$kev, with an unabsorbed 0.5--200 kev luminosity of ~3.8 10^{38} erg/s at 8 kpc.the spectrum can be approximated by a power-law of photon index 2.7, with amild soft excess and a hard x-ray hump. when using the xis data outside 2' ofthe image center, the fe-k line appeared extremely broad, suggesting a highblack hole spin as already reported by miller et al. (2008) based on the suzakudata and other ccd data. when the xis data accumulation is further limited to&gt;3' to avoid event pileup, the fe-k profile becomes narrower, and there appearsa marginally better solution that suggests the inner disk radius to be 5-14times the gravitational radius (1-sigma), though a maximally spinning blackhole is still allowed by the data at the 90% confidence level. consistently,the optically-thick accretion disk is inferred to be truncated at a radius 5-32times the gravitational radius. thus, the suzaku data allow an alternativeexplanation without invoking a rapidly spinning black hole. this inference isfurther supported by the disk radius measured previously in the high/softstate.

1003.0920	the dusty heart of nearby active galaxies. i. high-spatial resolution  mid-ir spectro-photometry of seyfert galaxies	we present 8-13 micron imaging and spectroscopy of 9 type 1 and 10 type 2 agnobtained with the vlt/visir instrument at spatial resolution &lt;100 pc. theemission from the host galaxy sources is resolved out in most cases. thesilicate absorption features are moderately deep and emission features areshallow. we compare the mid-ir luminosities to agn luminosity tracers and foundthat the mid-ir radiation is emitted quite isotropically. in two cases, ic5063and mcg-3-34-64, we find evidence for extended dust emission in the narrow-lineregion. we confirm the correlation between observed silicate feature strengthand hydrogen column density recently found in spitzer data. in a further step,our 3d clumpy torus model has been used to interpret the data. we show that thestrength of the silicate feature and the mid-ir spectral index can be used toget reasonable constraints on the dust distribution in the torus. the mid-irspectral index, alpha, is almost exclusively determined by the radial dustdistribution power-law index, a, and the silicate feature depth is mostlydepending on the average number of clouds, n0, along an equatorialline-of-sight and the torus inclination. a comparison of model predictions toour type 1 and type 2 agn reveals typical average parameters a=-1.0+/-0.5 andn0=5-8, which means that the radial dust distribution is rather shallow. as aproof-of-concept of this method, we compared the model parameters derived fromalpha and the silicate feature to more detailed studies of ir seds andinterferometry and found that the constraints on a and n0 are consistent.finally, we might have found evidence that the radial structure of the toruschanges from low to high agn luminosities towards steeper dust distributions,and we discuss implications for the ir size-luminosity relation.

1005.4685	rapid optical and x-ray timing observations of gx 339-4: multi-component  optical variability in the low/hard state	a rapid timing analysis of vlt/ultracam and rxte observations of the blackhole binary gx 339-4 in its 2007 low/hard state is presented. the optical lightcurves in the r', g' and u' filters show slow (~20 s) quasi-periodicvariability. upon this is superposed fast flaring activity on times approachingthe best time resolution probed (~50 ms) and with maximum strengths of morethan twice the local mean. power spectral analysis over ~0.004-10 hz ispresented, and shows that although the average optical variability amplitude islower than that in x-rays, the peak variability power emerges at a higherfourier frequency in the optical. energetically, we measure a large optical vs.x-ray flux ratio, higher than that seen when the source was fullyjet-dominated. such a large ratio cannot be easily explained with a disc alone.the optical:x-ray cross-spectrum shows a markedly different behaviour above andbelow ~0.2 hz. the peak of the coherence function above this threshold isassociated with a short optical time lag, also seen as the dominant feature inthe time-domain cross-correlation at ~150 ms. the rms energy spectrum of thesefast variations is best described by distinct physical components over theoptical and x-ray regimes, and also suggests a maximal disc fraction of 20% at~5000 a. if the constant time delay is due to propagation of fluctuations to(or within) the jet, this is the clearest optical evidence to date of thelocation of this component. the low-frequency qpo is seen in the optical butnot in x-rays. evidence of reprocessing emerges at the lowest fourierfrequencies, with optical lags at ~10 s and strong coherence in the blue u'filter. simultaneous optical spectroscopy also shows the bowen fluorescenceblend, though its emission location is unclear. but canonical disc reprocessingcannot dominate the optical power easily, nor explain the fast variability.(abridged)

0709.1984	constraints on light bending and reflection from the hard x-ray  background	light bending due to strong gravity has recently been invoked to explainvariability and flux correlations between different bands in some accretingblack holes. a characteristic feature of light bending is reflection-dominatedspectra, especially if photon sources lie in the deepest parts of thegravitational potential within a few gravitational radii of the event horizon.we use the spectrum of the hard x-ray background in order to constrain theprevalence of such reflection-dominated sources. we first emphasize the needfor reflection and explore the broad-band properties of realistic spectra thatincorporate light bending. we then use these spectra, in conjunction with theobserved 2-10 kev agn distribution, evolutionary and obscuration functions inorder to predict the hard x-ray background spectrum over 3-100 kev, and providelimits on the fraction of reflection-dominated objects, dependent on the heightof the photon sources. our results allow for a cosmologically-significantfraction of sources that incorporate strong light bending. the luminosityfunction based on intrinsic flare luminosities is derived and implicationsdiscussed. we discuss prospects for future hard x-ray missions such as next andsimbol-x that can image such sources as well as confirm the precise spectralshape of the background near its peak, important for constraining the universalrelevance of light bending.

0709.2077	the xmm large scale structure survey: optical vs. x-ray classifications  of active galactic nuclei and the unified scheme	our goal is to characterize agn populations by comparing their x-ray andoptical classifications. we present a sample of 99 spectroscopically identifiedx-ray point sources in the xmm-lss survey which are significantly detected inthe [2-10] kev band, and with more than 80 counts. we performed an x-rayspectral analysis for all of these 99 x-ray sources. introducing the fourfoldpoint correlation coefficient, we find only a mild correlation between thex-ray and the optical classifications, as up to 30% of the sources havediffering x-ray and optical classifications: on one hand, 10% of the type 1sources present broad emission lines in their optical spectra and strongabsorption in the x-rays. these objects are highly luminous agn lying at highredshift and thus dilution effects are totally ruled out, their discrepantnature being an intrinsic property. their x-ray luminosities and redshiftsdistributions are consistent with those of the unabsorbed x-ray sources withbroad emission lines. on the other hand, 25/32 are moderate luminosity agn,which are both unabsorbed in the x-rays and only present narrow emission linesin their optical spectra. the majority of them have an optical spectrum whichis representative of the host galaxy. we finally infer that dilution of the agnby the host galaxy seems to account for their nature. 5/25 have been defined asseyfert 2. in conclusion, most of these 32 discrepant cases can be accountedfor by the standard agn unified scheme, as its predictions are not met for only12% of the 99 x-ray sources. abridged

1109.6225	can we measure the accretion efficiency of active galactic nuclei?	the accretion efficiency for individual black holes is very difficult todetermine accurately. there are many factors that can influence each step ofthe calculation, such as the dust and host galaxy contribution to the observedluminosity, the black hole mass and more importantly, the uncertainties on thebolometric luminosity measurement. ideally, we would measure the agn emissionat every wavelength, remove the host galaxy and dust, reconstruct the agnspectral energy distribution and integrate to determine the intrinsic emissionand the accretion rate. in reality, this is not possible due to observationallimitations and our own galaxy line of sight obscuration. we have then to inferthe bolometric luminosity from spectral measurements made in discontinuouswavebands and at different epochs. in this paper we tackle this issue byexploring different methods to determine the bolometric luminosity. we firstexplore the trend of accretion efficiency with black hole mass (efficiencyproportional to m^{\sim 0.5}) found in recent work by davis &amp; laor and discusswhy this is most likely an artefact of the parameter space covered by their pgquasar sample. we then target small samples of agn at different redshifts,luminosities and black hole masses to investigate the possible methods tocalculate the accretion efficiency. for these sources we are able to determinethe mass accretion rate and, with some assumptions, the accretion efficiencydistributions. even though we select the sources for which we are able todetermine the parameters more accurately, there are still factors affecting themeasurements that are hard to constrain. we suggest methods to overcome theseproblems based on contemporaneous multi-wavelength data measurements andspecifically targeted observations for agn in different black hole mass ranges.

1111.5982	angular correlation functions of x-ray point-like sources in the full  exposure xmm-lss field	our aim is to study the large-scale structure of different types of agn usingthe medium-deep xmm-lss survey. we measure the two-point angular correlationfunction of ~ 5700 and 2500 x-ray point-like sources over the ~ 11 sq. deg.xmm-lss field in the soft (0.5-2 kev) and hard (2-10 kev) bands. for theconversion from the angular to the spatial correlation function we used thelimber integral equation and the luminosity-dependent density evolution modelof the agn x-ray luminosity function. we have found significant angularcorrelations with the power-law parameters gamma = 1.81 +/- 0.02, theta_0 =1.3" +/- 0.2" for the soft, and gamma = 2.00 +/- 0.04, theta_0 = 7.3" +/- 1.0"for the hard bands. the amplitude of the correlation function w(theta) ishigher in the hard than in the soft band for f_x &lt; 10^-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 andlower above this flux limit. we confirm that the clustering strength theta_0grows with the flux limit of the sample, a trend which is also present in theamplitude of the spatial correlation function, but only for the soft band. inthe hard band, it remains almost constant with r_0 = 10h^-1$ mpc, irrespectiveof the flux limit. our analysis of agn subsamples with different hardnessratios shows that the sources with a hard-spectrum are more clustered thansoft-spectrum ones. this result may be a hint that the two main types of agnpopulate different environments. finally, we find that our clustering resultscorrespond to an x-ray selected agn bias factor of ~ 2.5 for the soft-bandsources (at a median z = 1.1) and ~ 3.3 for the hard-band sources (at a medianz = 1), which translates into a host dark matter halo mass of ~ 10^13 h^-1 m_oand ~ 10^13.7 h^-1 m_o for the soft and hard bands, respectively.

1112.1417	nuclear mid-infrared properties of nearby low-luminosity agn	we present ground-based high-spatial resolution mid-infrared (mir)observations of 20 nearby low-luminosity agn (llagn) with vlt/visir and thepreliminary analysis of a new sample of 10 low-luminosity seyferts observedwith gemini/michelle. llagn are of great interest because these objects are themost common among active galaxies, especially in the nearby universe. studyingthem in great detail makes it possible to investigate the agn evolution overcosmic timescale. indeed, many llagn likely represent the final stage of anagn's lifetime. we show that even at low luminosities and accretion ratesnuclear unresolved mir emission is present in most objects. compared to lowerspatial resolution spitzer/irs spectra, the high-resolution mir photometryexhibits significantly lower fluxes and different pah emission featureproperties in many cases. by using scaled spitzer/irs spectra of typicalstarburst galaxies, we show that the star formation contribution to the 12micron emission is minor in the central parsecs of most llagn. therefore, theobserved mir emission in the visir and michelle data is most likely emitted bythe agn itself, which, for higher luminosity agn, is interpreted as thermalemission from a dusty torus. furthermore, the 12 micron emission of the llagnis strongly correlated with the absorption corrected 2-10 kev luminosity andthe mir--x-ray correlation found previously for agn is extended to a range from10^40 to 10^45 erg/s. this correlation is independent of the object type, andin particular the low-luminosity seyferts observed with michelle fall exactlyon the power-law fit valid for brighter agn. in addition, no dependency of themir--x-ray ratio on the accretion rate is found. these results are consistentwith the unification model being applicable even in the probed low-luminosityregime.

1211.1655	jet spectral breaks in black hole x-ray binaries	in x-ray binaries, compact jets are known to commonly radiate at radio toinfrared frequencies, whereas at optical to gamma-ray energies, thecontribution of the jet is debated. the total luminosity, and hence power ofthe jet is critically dependent on the position of the break in its spectrum,between optically thick (self-absorbed) and optically thin synchrotronemission. this break, or turnover, has been reported in just one black holex-ray binary (bhxb) thus far, gx 339-4, and inferred via spectral fitting intwo others, a0620-00 and cyg x-1. here, we collect a wealth of multiwavelengthdata from the outbursts of bhxbs during hard x-ray states, in order to searchfor jet breaks as yet unidentified in their spectral energy distributions. inparticular, we report the direct detection of the jet break in the spectrum ofv404 cyg during its 1989 outburst, at nu_b = (1.8 +- 0.3) x 10^14 hz (1.7 +-0.2 microns). we increase the number of bhxbs with measured jet breaks fromthree to eight. jet breaks are found at frequencies spanning more than twoorders of magnitude, from nu_b = (4.5 +- 0.8) x 10^12 hz for xte j1118+480during its 2005 outburst, to nu_b &gt; 4.7 x 10^14 hz for v4641 sgr in outburst. apositive correlation between jet break frequency and luminosity is expectedtheoretically; nu_b \propto l_nu,jet^~0.5 if other parameters are constant.with constraints on the jet break in a total of 12 bhxbs including twoquiescent systems, we find a large range of jet break frequencies at similarluminosities and no obvious global relation (but such a relation cannot beruled out for individual sources). we speculate that different magnetic fieldstrengths and/or different radii of the acceleration zone in the inner regionsof the jet are likely to be responsible for the observed scatter betweensources.

1301.3023	confirmation of the nature of the absorber in iras 09104+4109	we present the first long \emph{suzaku} observation of the hyperluminousinfrared galaxy iras 09104+4109 which is dominated by a type 2 agn. theinfrared to x-ray sed indicates that the source is an obscured quasar with acompton-thin absorber. however, the 3$\sigma$ hard x-ray detection of thesource with the \emph{bepposax} pds suggested a reflection-dominated,compton-thick view. the high-energy detection was later found to be possiblycontaminated by another type 2 agn, ngc 2785, which is only 17 arcmin away. ournew \emph{suzaku} observation offers simultaneous soft and hard x-ray coverageand excludes contamination from ngc 2785. we find that the hard x-ray componentis not detected by the \emph{suzaku} hxd/pin (effective energy band 14-45 kev).both reflection and transmission models have been tested on the latest\emph{suzaku} and \emph{chandra} data. the 0.5-10 kev spectrum can be wellmodelled by the two scenarios. in addition, our analysis implied that theabsorption column required in both models is $n_{\rm h} \sim 5 \times 10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$. unless iras 09104+4109 is a "changing-look" quasar, we confirm thatit is a compton-thin agn. although the lack of detection of x-ray emissionabove 10 kev seems to favour the transmission scenario, we found that the twomodels offer fairly similar flux predictions over the x-ray band below $\sim$40 kev. we also found that the strong iron line shown in the \emph{suzaku}spectrum is in fact a blend of two emission lines, in which the 6.4 kev one ismostly contributed from the agn and the 6.7 kev from the hot cluster gas. thisimplies that the neutral line is perhaps caused by disc reflection, and thereflection-dominated model is more likely the explanation. the transmissionmodel should not be completely ruled out, but a deeper hard x-ray spectrumobservation is needed to discriminate between the two scenarios.

1302.5116	the black hole and central stellar population of mcg--6-30-15	we present the first near-infrared integral field spectroscopy observationsof the galaxy mcg--6-30-15. the h-band data studied in this paper cover thecentral 500 pc of the galaxy at the best resolution (0".1) so far. the spectraof the innermost regions are dominated by broad brackett series emission linesand non-stellar continuum, under which we are able to trace the distributionand kinematics of the stars and also the [fe ii] line emission. we find thatthere is a counter-rotating stellar core extending out to 125 pc, which appearsto be associated with the [fe ii] emission. based on the mass-to-light ratio,and the presence of this emission line, we estimate the age of the centralstellar population to be of order of 65 myr. we show that the gas needed tofuel the black hole is, at most, only 1 per cent of that needed to form thesestars. we derive independent constraints on the black hole mass using thedynamical information and determine an upper limit for the black hole mass, mbh&lt; 6e7 msun, that is consistent with other estimates.

1303.1565	sn 2009js at the crossroads between normal and subluminous type iip  supernovae: optical and mid-infrared evolution	we present a study of sn 2009js in ngc 918. multi-band kanata opticalphotometry covering the first ~120 days show the source to be a type iip sn.reddening is dominated by that due to our galaxy. one-year-post-explosionphotometry with the ntt, and a subaru optical spectrum 16 days post-discovery,both imply a good match with the well-studied subluminous sn 2005cs. theplateau phase luminosity of sn 2009js and its plateau duration are more similarto the intermediate luminosity iip sn 2008in. thus, sn 2009js sharescharacteristics with both subluminous and intermediate luminosity sne. itsradioactive tail luminosity lies between sn 2005cs and sn 2008in, whereas itsquasi-bolometric luminosity decline from peak to plateau (quantified by anewly-defined parameter delta[logl] measuring adiabatic cooling following shockbreakout) is much smaller than both the others. we estimate the ejected mass of56ni to be low (~0.007 msun). the sn explosion energy appears to have beensmall, similar to sn 2005cs. sn 2009js is the first subluminous sn iip to bestudied in the mid-infrared. it was serendipitously caught by spitzer at veryearly times. in addition, it was detected by wise 105 days later with asignificant 4.6 micron flux excess above the photosphere. the infrared excessluminosity relative to the photosphere is clearly smaller than that of sn2004dj extensively studied in the mid-infrared. the excess may be tentativelyassigned to heated dust with mass ~3e-5 msun, or to co fundamental emission asa precursor to dust formation.

1304.1970	highly ionized fe-k absorption line from cygnus x-1 in the high/soft  state observed with suzaku	we present observations of a transient he-like fe k alpha absorption line insuzaku observations of the black hole binary cygnus x-1 on 2011 october 5 nearsuperior conjunction during the high/soft state, which enable us to map thefull evolution from the start and the end of the episodic accretion phenomenaor dips for the first time. we model the x-ray spectra during the event andtrace their evolution. the absorption line is rather weak in the first half ofthe observation, but instantly deepens for ~10 ks, and weakens thereafter. theoverall change in equivalent width is a factor of ~3, peaking at an orbitalphase of ~0.08. this is evidence that the companion stellar wind feeding theblack hole is clumpy. by analyzing the line with a voigt profile, it is foundto be consistent with a slightly redshifted fe xxv transition, or possibly amixture of several species less ionized than fe xxv. the data may be explainedby a clump located at a distance of ~10^(10-12) cm with a density of~10^((-13)-(-11)) g cm^-3, which accretes onto and/or transits theline-of-sight to the black hole, causing an instant decrease in the observeddegree of the ionization and/or an increase in density of the accreting matter.continued monitoring for individual events with future x-ray calorimetermissions such as astro-h and axsio will allow us to map out the accretionenvironment in detail and how it changes between the various accretion states.

1304.3510	an evolving compact jet in the black hole x-ray binary maxi j1836-194	we report striking changes in the broadband spectrum of the compact jet ofthe black hole transient maxi j1836-194 over state transitions during itsdiscovery outburst in 2011. a fading of the optical-infrared (ir) flux occurredas the source entered the hard-intermediate state, followed by a brightening asit returned to the hard state. the optical-ir spectrum was consistent with apower law from optically thin synchrotron emission, except when the x-rayspectrum was softest. by fitting the radio to optical spectra with a brokenpower law, we constrain the frequency and flux of the optically thick/thinbreak in the jet synchrotron spectrum. the break gradually shifted to higherfrequencies as the source hardened at x-ray energies, from ~ 10^11 to ~ 4 x10^13 hz. the radiative jet luminosity integrated over the spectrum appeared tobe greatest when the source entered the hard state during the outburst decay(although this is dependent on the high energy cooling break, which is not seendirectly), even though the radio flux was fading at the time. the physicalprocess responsible for suppressing and reactivating the jet (neither of whichare instantaneous but occur on timescales of weeks) is uncertain, but couldarise from the varying inner accretion disk radius regulating the fraction ofaccreting matter that is channeled into the jet. this provides an unprecedentedinsight into the connection between inflow and outflow, and has implicationsfor the conditions required for jets to be produced, and hence their launchingprocess.

1305.4901	reflection-dominated nuclear x-ray emission in the early-type galaxy eso  565--g019	we present the discovery of a reflection-dominated active galactic nucleus(agn) in the early-type radio-quiet galaxy eso 565--g019 with suzaku andswift/bat. the source x-ray spectrum below 10 kev is characteristic of othercompton-thick (ct) agn, clearly showing an inverted continuum and prodigiousfluorescence iron emission above ~3 kev. a compton shoulder to the neutral fekalpha line also appears to be present. there is evidence for long-term hardx-ray flux variability which we associate with changes in the intrinsic agnpower-law. the increasing sensitivity of ongoing and new hard x-ray surveysmeans that more such reflection-dominated agn ought to be uncovered in the nearfuture. eso 565--g019 is hosted in an early-type galaxy whose morphology hasbeen variously classified as either type e or type s0. only about 20 bona fidect-agn have been identified in the local universe so far, and all exist in hostgalaxies with late hubble types (s0 or later). ct columns of nuclear obscuringgas are uncommon in early-type galaxies in the local universe, so confirmationof the exact morphological class of eso 565--g019 is important. infraredphotometry also shows the presence of large quantities of cool dust in thehost, indicative of significant ongoing star-formation. eso 565--g019 may bethe first identified local example of minor-merger driven ct-agn growth in anearly-type host, or may be the result of interaction with its neighboringgalaxy eso 565--g018 in a wide pair.

1306.2330	the hot and energetic universe: astrophysics of feedback in local agn	understanding the astrophysics of feedback in active galactic nuclei (agn) iskey to understanding the growth and co-evolution of supermassive black holesand galaxies. agn-driven winds/outflows are potentially the most effective wayof transporting energy and momentum from the nuclear scales to the host galaxy,quenching star formation by sweeping away the gas reservoir. key questions inthis field are: 1) how do accretion disks around black holes launchwinds/outflows, and how much energy do these carry? 2) how are the energy andmetals accelerated in winds/outflows transferred and deposited into thecircumgalactic medium? x-ray observations are a unique way to address thesequestions because they probe the phase of the outflows which carries most ofthe kinetic energy. we show how a high throughput, high spectral resolutioninstrument like the x-ray integral field unit (x-ifu) on athena+ will allow usto address these questions by determining the physical parameters (ionizationstate, density, temperature, abundances, velocities, geometry, etc.) of theoutflows on a dynamical time-scale, in a broad sample of nearby bright agn. thex-ifu will also allow direct spectral imaging of the impact of these winds onthe host galaxy for local agn, forming a template for understanding agn athigher redshifts where wind shocks cannot be resolved.

1307.0527	classification and environmental properties of x-ray selected point-like  sources in the xmm-lss field	the xmm-large scale structure survey, covering an area of 11.1 sq. deg.,contains more than 6000 x-ray point-like sources detected with xmm-newton downto a flux of 3x10^-15 erg s^-1 cm^-2 in the [0.5-2] kev band, the vast majorityof which have optical (cfhtls), infrared (swire), near-infrared (ukidss) and/orultraviolet (galex) counterparts. we wish to investigate the environmentalproperties of the different types of the xmm-lss x-ray sources, defining theirenvironment using the i-band cfhtls w1 catalog of optical galaxies down to amagnitude limit of 23.5 mag. we have classified 4435 x-ray selected sources onthe basis of their spectra, seds and x-ray luminosity and estimated theirphotometric redshifts, having 4-11 band photometry, with an accuracysigma=0.076 and 22.6% outliers for i&lt;26 mag. we estimated the localoverdensities of 777 x-ray sources which have spectro-z or photo-z calculatedusing more than 7 bands (accuracy sigma=0.061 with 13.8% outliers) within thevolume-limited region defined by 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.85 and -23.5&lt;mi&lt;-20. although x-raysources may be found in variety of environments, a large fraction (~55-60%), asverified by comparing with the random expectations, reside in overdenseregions. the galaxy overdensities within which x-ray sources reside show apositive recent redshift evolution. we also find that x-ray selected galaxies,with respect to agn, inhabit significantly higher galaxy overdensities,although their spatial extent appear to be smaller than that of agn. hard agn(hr&gt;=-0.2) are located in more overdense regions with respect to the soft agn(hr&lt;-0.2), a fact clearly seen in both redshift ranges, although it appears tobe stronger in the higher redshift range (0.55&lt;z&lt;0.85). furthermore, the galaxyoverdensities (with d&gt;1.5) within which soft agn are embedded appear to evolvemore rapidly with respect to the corresponding overdensities around hard agn.

1310.1779	infrared timing with spica: probing the formation of stellar-mass  compact object jets in real-time	the time domain remains, in many respects, the least explored of parameterspaces in astronomical studies. the purpose of this article is to encourage thespica community to consider the potential of rapid infrared timingobservations. the specific example considered is that of variable emission fromrelativistic jets in compact accreting objects, whose formation and poweringmechanisms we still do not understand. infrared observations have the potentialto give us fundamental insight on the conditions required for jet formation inaccreting stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars. this is because particleacceleration is thought to be magnetically-driven, and the spectral transitionbetween optically-thin and self-absorbed jet synchrotron radiation lies in theinfrared. we review recent observations from wise showing that we have thecapability to measure key physical parameters of the jet, and theirtime-dependence on rapidly-changing conditions in the accretion flow around theblack hole (on timescales of just a few seconds). spica will provide abreakthrough in this field because of its sensitivity and broadband coverage,and we detail an example spica observation on short (tens of milliseconds)timescales. we believe that spica has the potential to make great impact ontime domain science, and we discuss some technical requirements that willenable this.

1310.2770	the subarcsecond mid-infrared view of local active galactic nuclei: i.  the n- and q-band imaging atlas	we present the first subarcsecond-resolution mid-infrared (mir) atlas oflocal active galactic nuclei (agn). our atlas contains 253 agn with a medianredshift of z=0.016, and includes all publicly available mir imaging performedto date with ground-based 8-m class telescopes, a total of 895 independentmeasurements. of these, more than 60% are published here for the first time. wedetect extended nuclear emission in at least 21% of the objects, while another19% appear clearly point-like, and the remaining objects cannot be constrained.where present, elongated nuclear emission aligns with the ionization cones inseyferts. subarcsecond resolution allows us to isolate the agn emission onscales of a few tens of parsecs and to obtain nuclear photometry in multiplefilters for the objects. median spectral energy distributions (seds) for thedifferent optical agn types are constructed and individual mir 12 and 18microncontinuum luminosities are computed. these range over more than six orders ofmagnitude. in comparison to the arcsecond-scale mir emission as probed byspitzer, the continuum emission is much lower on subarcsecond scales in manycases. the silicate feature strength is similar on both scales and generallyappears in emission (absorption) in type i (ii) agn. however, the polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbon emission appears weaker or absent on subarcsecond scales.the differences of the mir seds on both scales are particularly large foragn/starburst composites and close-by (and weak) agn. the nucleus dominatesover the total emission of the galaxy only at luminosities &gt;=10^(44)erg/s. theagn mir atlas is well suited not only for detailed investigation of individualsources but also for statistical studies of agn unification.

1311.3700	a wide search for obscured active galactic nuclei using xmm-newton and  wise	we use a combination of the xmm-newton serendipitous x-ray survey with theoptical sdss, and the infrared wise all-sky survey in order to check theefficiency of the low x-ray to infrared luminosity selection method in findingheavily obscured agn. we select sources in the 2-8 kev x-ray band which have aredshift determination in the sdss catalogue. we match this sample with thewise catalogue, and fit the seds of the 2844 sources which have three, or more,photometric data-points in the infrared. we then select the heavily obscuredagn candidates by comparing their 12 micron agn luminosity to the observed 2-10kev x-ray luminosity and their expected intrinsic relation. with this approachwe find 20 candidates, and we examine their x-ray and optical spectra. of the20 initial candidates, we find nine (64%; out of the 14, for which x-rayspectra could be fit) based on the x-ray spectra, and seven (78%; out of thenine detected spectroscopically in the sdss) based on the [oiii] line fluxes.combining all criteria, we determine the final number of heavily obscured agnto be 12-19, and the number of compton-thick agn to be 2-5, showing that themethod is reliable in finding obscured agn, but not compton-thick. howeverthose numbers are smaller than what would be expected from x-ray backgroundpopulation synthesis models, which demonstrates how the optical-infraredselection and the scatter of the l_x-l_mir relation introduced by observationalconstraints limit the efficiency of the method. finally, we test popularobscured agn selection methods based on mid-infrared colours, and find that theprobability of an agn to be selected by its mid-infrared colours increases withthe x-ray luminosity. however, a selection scheme based on a relatively lowx-ray luminosity and mid-infrared colours characteristic of qsos would notselect ~25% of the heavily obscured agn of our sample.

1311.4880	what obscures low x-ray-scattering active galactic nuclei?	x-ray surveys have revealed a new class of active galactic nuclei (agn) witha very low observed fraction of scattered soft x-rays, f_scat &lt; 0.5%. based onx-ray modeling these "x-ray new-type", or low observed x-ray scattering(hereafter:"low-scattering") sources have been interpreted as deeply-buried agnwith a high covering factor of gas. in this paper we address the questionswhether the host galaxies of low-scattering agn may contribute to the observedx-ray properties, and whether we can find any direct evidence for high coveringfactors from the infrared (ir) emission. we find that x-ray low-scattering agnare preferentially hosted by highly-inclined galaxies or merger systems ascompared to other seyfert galaxies, increasing the likelihood that theline-of-sight toward the agn intersects with high columns of host-galactic gasand dust. moreover, while a detailed analysis of the ir emission oflow-scattering agn eso 103-g35 remains inconclusive, we do not find anyindication of systematically higher dust covering factors in a sample oflow-scattering agn based on their ir emission. for eso 103-g35, we constrainedthe temperature, mass and location of the ir emitting dust which is consistentwith expectations for the dusty torus. however, a deep silicate absorptionfeature probably from much cooler dust suggests an additional screen absorberon larger scales within the host galaxy. taking these findings together, wepropose that the low f_scat observed in low-scattering agn is not necessarilythe result of circumnuclear dust but could originate from interference ofhost-galactic gas with a column density of the order of 10^22 cm^-2 with theline-of-sight. we discuss implications of this hypothesis for x-ray models,high-ionization emission lines, and observed star-formation activity in theseobjects.

1402.4811	{\it nustar} reveals an intrinsically x-ray weak broad absorption line  quasar in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy markarian 231	we present high-energy (3--30 kev) {\it nustar} observations of the nearestquasar, the ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ulirg) markarian 231 (mrk 231),supplemented with new and simultaneous low-energy (0.5--8 kev) data from {\itchandra}. the source was detected, though at much fainter levels thanpreviously reported, likely due to contamination in the large apertures ofprevious non-focusing hard x-ray telescopes. the full band (0.5--30 kev) x-rayspectrum suggests the active galactic nucleus (agn) in mrk 231 is absorbed by apatchy and compton-thin (n$_{\rm h} \sim1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.3}\times10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$) column. the intrinsic x-ray luminosity (l$_{\rm 0.5-30kev}\sim1.0\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{1}$) is extremely weak relative to thebolometric luminosity where the 2--10 kev to bolometric luminosity ratio is$\sim$0.03% compared to the typical values of 2--15%. additionally, mrk 231 hasa low x-ray-to-optical power law slope ($\alpha_{\rm ox}\sim-1.7$). it is alocal example of a low-ionization broad absorption line (lobal) quasar that isintrinsically x-ray weak. the weak ionizing continuum may explain the lack ofmid-infrared [o iv], [ne v], and [ne vi] fine-structure emission lines whichare present in sources with otherwise similar agn properties. we argue that theintrinsic x-ray weakness may be a result of the super-eddington accretionoccurring in the nucleus of this ulirg, and may also be naturally related tothe powerful wind event seen in mrk 231, a merger remnant escaping from itsdusty cocoon.

1403.3078	nustar and xmm-newton observations of luminous, heavily obscured,  wise-selected quasars at z ~ 2	we report on a nustar and xmm-newton program that has observed a sample ofthree extremely luminous, heavily obscured wise-selected agn at z~2 in a broadx-ray band (0.1 - 79 kev). the parent sample, selected to be faint orundetected in the wise 3.4um (w1) and 4.6um (w2) bands but bright at 12um (w3)and 22um (w4), are extremely rare, with only ~1000 so-called w1w2-dropoutsacross the extragalactic sky. optical spectroscopy reveals typical redshifts ofz~2 for this population, implying rest-frame mid-ir luminosities of l(6um)~6e46erg/s and bolometric luminosities that can exceed l(bol)~1e14 l(sun). thecorresponding intrinsic, unobscured hard x-ray luminosities are l(2-10)~4e45erg/s for typical quasar templates. these are amongst the most luminous agnknown, though the optical spectra rarely show evidence of a broad-line regionand the selection criteria imply heavy obscuration even at rest-frame 1.5um. wedesigned our x-ray observations to obtain robust detections for gas columndensities n(h)&lt;1e24 /cm2. in fact, the sources prove to be fainter than thesepredictions. two of the sources were observed by both nustar and xmm-newton,with neither being detected by nustar and one being faintly detected byxmm-newton. a third source was observed only with xmm-newton, yielding a faintdetection. the x-ray data require gas column densities n(h)&gt;1e24 /cm2, implyingthe sources are extremely obscured, consistent with compton-thick, luminousquasars. the discovery of a significant population of heavily obscured,extremely luminous agn does not conform to the standard paradigm of a recedingtorus, in which more luminous quasars are less likely to be obscured. if alarger sample conforms with this finding, then this suggests an additionalsource of obscuration for these extreme sources.

1406.3345	the 2-79 kev x-ray spectrum of the circinus galaxy with nustar,  xmm-newton and chandra: a fully compton-thick agn	the circinus galaxy is one of the nearest obscured agn, making it an idealtarget for detailed study. combining archival chandra and xmm-newton data withnew nustar observations, we model the 2-79 kev spectrum to constrain theprimary agn continuum and to derive physical parameters for the obscuringmaterial. chandra's high angular resolution allows a separation of nuclear andoff-nuclear galactic emission. in the off-nuclear diffuse emission we findsignatures of strong cold reflection, including high equivalent-width neutralfe lines. this compton-scattered off-nuclear emission amounts to 18% of thenuclear flux in the fe line region, but becomes comparable to the nuclearemission above 30 kev. the new analysis no longer supports a prominenttransmitted agn component in the observed band. we find that the nuclearspectrum is consistent with compton-scattering by an optically-thick torus,where the intrinsic spectrum is a powerlaw of photon index $\gamma = 2.2-2.4$,the torus has an equatorial column density of $n_{\rm h} =(6-10)\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ and the intrinsic agn $2-10$ kev luminosity is$(2.3-5.1)\times 10^{42}$ erg/s. these values place circinus along the samerelations as unobscured agn in accretion rate-vs-$\gamma$ and $l_x$-vs-$l_{ir}$phase space. nustar's high sensitivity and low background allow us to study theshort time-scale variability of circinus at x-ray energies above 10 kev for thefirst time. the lack of detected variability favors a compton-thick absorber,in line with the the spectral fitting results.

1408.3633	weak hard x-ray emission from broad absorption line quasars: evidence  for intrinsic x-ray weakness	we report nustar observations of a sample of six x-ray weak broad absorptionline (bal) quasars. these targets, at z=0.148-1.223, are among the opticallybrightest and most luminous bal quasars known at z&lt;1.3. however, theirrest-frame 2 kev luminosities are 14 to &gt;330 times weaker than expected fortypical quasars. our results from a pilot nustar study of two low-redshift balquasars, a chandra stacking analysis of a sample of high-redshift bal quasars,and a nustar spectral analysis of the local bal quasar mrk 231 have alreadysuggested the existence of intrinsically x-ray weak bal quasars, i.e., quasarsnot emitting x-rays at the level expected from their optical/uv emission. theaim of the current program is to extend the search for such extraordinaryobjects. three of the six new targets are weakly detected by nustar with &lt;45counts in the 3-24 kev band, and the other three are not detected. the hardx-ray (8-24 kev) weakness observed by nustar requires compton-thick absorptionif these objects have nominal underlying x-ray emission. however, a softstacked effective photon index ({\gamma}~1.8) for this sample disfavorscompton-thick absorption in general. the uniform hard x-ray weakness observedby nustar for this and the pilot samples selected with &lt;10 kev weakness alsosuggests that the x-ray weakness is intrinsic in at least some of the targets.we conclude that the nustar observations have likely discovered a significantpopulation (&gt;33%) of intrinsically x-ray weak objects among the bal quasarswith significantly weak &lt;10 kev emission. we suggest that intrinsically x-rayweak quasars might be preferentially observed as bal quasars.

1408.4453	a compton thick agn in the barred spiral ngc 4785	we present x-ray observations of the active galactic nucleus (agn) in ngc4785. the source is a local seyfert 2 which has not been studied so far in muchdetail. it was recently detected with high significance in the 15-60 kev bandin the 66 month swift/bat all sky survey, but there have been no prior pointedx-ray observations of this object. with suzaku, we clearly detect the sourcebelow 10 kev, and find it to have a flat continuum and prominent neutral ironfluorescence line with equivalent width &gt;~1 kev. fitting the broadband spectrawith physical reflection models shows the source to be a bona fide comptonthick agn with nh of at least 2x10^{24} cm^{-2} and absorption-corrected 2-10kev x-ray power l(2-10) ~ few times 10^{42} erg s^{-1}. realistic uncertaintieson l(2-10) computed from the joint confidence interval on the intrinsic powerlaw continuum photon index and normalization are at least a factor of 10. thelocal bona fide compton thick agn population is highly heterogeneous in termsof wise mid-infrared source colours, and the nucleus of ngc 4785 appearsespecially sub-dominant in the mid-infrared when comparing to other comptonthick agn. such sources would not be easily found using mid-infrared selectionalone. the extent of host galaxy extinction to the nucleus is not clear, thoughngc 4785 shows a complex core with a double bar and inner disk, adding to thelist of known compton thick agn in barred host galaxies.

1408.5281	nustar reveals the comptonizing corona of the broad-line radio galaxy 3c  382	broad-line radio galaxies (blrgs) are active galactic nuclei that producepowerful, large-scale radio jets, but appear as seyfert 1 galaxies in theiroptical spectra. in the x-ray band, blrgs also appear like seyfert galaxies,but with flatter spectra and weaker reflection features. one explanation forthese properties is that the x-ray continuum is diluted by emission from thejet. here, we present two nustar observations of the blrg 3c 382 that showclear evidence that the continuum of this source is dominated by thermalcomptonization, as in seyfert 1 galaxies. the two observations were separatedby over a year and found 3c 382 in different states separated by a factor of1.7 in flux. the lower flux spectrum has a photon-index of$\gamma=1.68^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, while the photon-index of the higher fluxspectrum is $\gamma=1.78^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$. thermal and anisotropiccomptonization models provide an excellent fit to both spectra and show thatthe coronal plasma cooled from $kt_e=330\pm 30$ kev in the low flux data to$231^{+50}_{-88}$ kev in the high flux observation. this cooling behavior istypical of comptonizing corona in seyfert galaxies and is distinct from thevariations observed in jet-dominated sources. in the high flux observation,simultaneous swift data are leveraged to obtain a broadband spectral energydistribution and indicates that the corona intercepts $\sim 10$% of the opticaland ultraviolet emitting accretion disk. 3c 382 exhibits very weak reflectionfeatures, with no detectable relativistic fe k$\alpha$ line, that may be bestexplained by an outflowing corona combined with an ionized inner accretiondisk.

1408.5414	the nustar view of nearby compton-thick agn: the cases of ngc 424, ngc  1320 and ic 2560	we present x-ray spectral analyses for three seyfert 2 active galacticnuclei, ngc 424, ngc 1320, and ic 2560, observed by nustar in the 3-79 kevband. the high quality hard x-ray spectra allow detailed modeling of thecompton reflection component for the first time in these sources. usingquasi-simultaneous nustar and swift/xrt data, as well as archival xmm-newtondata, we find that all three nuclei are obscured by compton-thick material withcolumn densities in excess of ~5 x $10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and that their x-rayspectra above 3 kev are dominated by reflection of the intrinsic continuum oncompton-thick material. due to the very high obscuration, absorbed intrinsiccontinuum components are not formally required by the data in any of thesources. we constrain the intrinsic photon indices and the column density ofthe reflecting medium through the shape of the reflection spectra. usingarchival multi-wavelength data we recover the intrinsic x-ray luminositiesconsistent with the broadband spectral energy distributions. our results areconsistent with the reflecting medium being an edge-on clumpy torus with arelatively large global covering factor and overall reflection efficiency ofthe order of 1%. given the unambiguous confirmation of the compton-thick natureof the sources, we investigate whether similar sources are likely to be missedby commonly used selection criteria for compton-thick agn, and explore thepossibility of finding their high-redshift counterparts.

1410.6792	properties of the solar neighbor wise j072003.20-084651.2	the severe crowding towards the galactic plane suggests that the census ofnearby stars in that direction may be incomplete. recently, scholz reported anew m9 object at an estimated distance d~7 pc (wise j072003.20-084651.2;hereafter wise0720) at galactic latitude b=2.3 degr.  our goals are to determine the physical characteristics of wise0720, itskinematic properties, and to address the question if it is a binary object, assuggested in the discovery paper.  optical and infrared spectroscopy from the southern african large telescopeand magellan, respectively, and spectral energy distribution fitting were usedto determine the spectral type of wise0720. the measured radial velocity,proper motion and parallax yielded its galactic velocities. we alsoinvestigated if wise0720 may show x-ray activity based on archival data.  our spectra are consistent with spectral type l0+/-1. we find no evidence forbinarity, apart for a minor 2-sigma level difference in the radial velocitiestaken at two different epochs. the spatial velocity of wise0720 does notconnect it to any known moving group, instead it places the object with highprobability in the old thin disk or in the thick disk. the spectral energydistribution fit hints at excess in the 12 and 22 micron wise bands which maybe due to a redder companion, but the same excess is visible in other late typeobjects, and it more likely implies a shortcoming of the models (e.g., issueswith the effective wavelengths of the filters for these extremely cool objects,etc.) rather than a disk or redder companion. the optical spectrum shows somehalpha emission, indicative of stellar activity. archival x-ray observationsyield no detection.

1412.1177	astro-h white paper - agn reflection	x-ray observations provide a powerful tool to probe the central engines ofactive galactic nuclei (agn). a hard x-ray continuum is produced from deepwithin the accretion flow onto the supermassive black hole, and all opticallythick structures in the agn (the dusty torus of agn unification schemes, broademission line clouds, and the black hole accretion disk) "light up" in responseto irradiation by this continuum. this white paper describes the prospects forprobing agn physics using observations of these x-ray reflection signatures.high-resolution sxs spectroscopy of the resulting fluorescent iron line intype-2 agn will give us an unprecedented view of the obscuring torus, allowingus to assess its dynamics (through line broadening) and geometry (through theline profile as well as observations of the "compton shoulder"). the broad-bandview obtained by combining all of the astro-h instruments will fullycharacterize the shape of the underlying continuum (which may be heavilyabsorbed) and reflection/scattering, providing crucial constraints on modelsfor the cosmic x-ray background with a subsequent impact on understanding ofsupermassive black hole evolution. astro-h will also permit therelativistically broadened reflection spectrum from the inner accretion disk tobe robustly studied, even in complex systems with, for example, warm absorptionand composite soft excesses. finally, the hxi will allow the detection andstudy of reverberation delays between the continuum and the compton reflectionhump from the inner disk.

1412.5819	internal shocks driven by accretion flow variability in the compact jet  of the black hole binary gx 339-4	in recent years, compact jets have been playing a growing role in theunderstanding of accreting black hole engines. in the case of x-ray binarysystems, compact jets are usually associated with the hard state phase of asource outburst. recent observations of gx 339-4 have demonstrated the presenceof a variable synchrotron spectral break in the mid-infrared band that wasassociated with its compact jet. in the model used in this study, we assumethat the jet emission is produced by electrons accelerated in internal shocksdriven by rapid fluctuations of the jet velocity. the resulting spectral energydistribution (sed) and variability properties are very sensitive to the fourierpower spectrum density (psd) of the assumed fluctuations of the jet lorentzfactor. these fluctuations are likely to be triggered by the variability of theaccretion flow which is best traced by the x-ray emission. taking the psd ofthe jet lorentz factor fluctuations to be identical to the observed x-ray psd,our study finds that the internal shock model successfully reproduces the radioto infrared sed of the source at the time of the observations as well as thereported strong mid-infrared spectral variability.

1502.05982	simultaneous nustar/chandra observations of the bursting pulsar gro  j1744-28 during its third reactivation	we report on a 10 ks simultaneous chandra/hetg-nustar observation of thebursting pulsar, gro j1744-28, during its third detected outburst sincediscovery and after nearly 18 years of quiescence. the source is detected up to60 kev with an eddington persistent flux level. seven bursts, followed by dips,are seen with chandra, three of which are also detected with nustar. timinganalysis reveals a slight increase in the persistent emission pulsed fractionwith energy (from 10% to 15%) up to 10 kev, above which it remains constant.the 0.5-70 kev spectra of the persistent and dip emission are the same withinerrors, and well described by a blackbody (bb), a power-law with an exponentialrolloff, a 10 kev feature, and a 6.7 kev emission feature, all modified byneutral absorption. assuming that the bb emission originates in an accretiondisc, we estimate its inner (magnetospheric) radius to be about 4x10^7 cm,which translates to a surface dipole field b~9x10^10 g. the chandra/hetgspectrum resolves the 6.7 kev feature into (quasi-)neutral and highly ionizedfe xxv and fe xxvi emission lines. xstar modeling shows these lines to alsoemanate from a truncated accretion disk. the burst spectra, with a peak fluxmore than an order of magnitude higher than eddington, are well fit with apower-law with an exponential rolloff and a 10~kev feature, with similar fitvalues compared to the persistent and dip spectra. the burst spectra lack athermal component and any fe features. anisotropic (beamed) burst emissionwould explain both the lack of the bb and any fe components.

1502.07353	determining the covering factor of compton-thick active galactic nuclei  with nustar	the covering factor of compton-thick obscuring material associated with thetorus in active galactic nuclei (agn) is at present best understood through thefraction of sources exhibiting compton-thick absorption along the line of sight($n_{h}&gt;1.5\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) in the x-ray band, which reveals theaverage covering factor. determining this compton-thick fraction is difficulthowever, due to the extreme obscuration. with its spectral coverage at hardx-rays ($&gt;$10 kev), nustar is sensitive to the agn covering factor sincecompton scattering of x-rays off optically thick material dominates at theseenergies. we present a spectral analysis of 10 agn observed with nustar wherethe obscuring medium is optically thick to compton scattering, so calledcompton-thick (ct) agn. we use the torus models of brightman &amp; nandra whichpredict the x-ray spectrum from reprocessing in a torus and include the torusopening angle as a free parameter and aim to determine the covering factor ofthe compton-thick gas in these sources individually. across the sample we findmild to heavy compton-thick columns, with $n_{h}$ measured from$10^{24}-10^{26}$ cm$^{-2}$, and a wide range of covering factors, whereindividual measurements range from 0.2-0.9. we find that the covering factor,$f_{c}$, is a strongly decreasing function of the intrinsic 2-10 kevluminosity, $l_{x}$, where $f_{c}=(-0.41\pm0.13)$log$_{10}$($l_{x}$/ergs$^{-1}$)$+18.31\pm5.33$, across more than two orders of magnitude in $l_{x}$(10$^{41.5}-10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$). the covering factors measured here agreewell with the obscured fraction as a function of $l_{x}$ as determined bystudies of local agn with $l_{x}&gt;10^{42.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$.

(2014) tosimultaneously measure the black hole spin, disk inner radius, and coronalheight in a self-consistent manner. detailed fits to the iron line profileindicate a high level of relativistic blurring, indicative of reflection fromthe inner accretion disk. we find a high spin, a small inner disk radius, and alow source height, and rule out truncation to greater than three gravitationalradii at the 3{\sigma} confidence level. in addition, we find that the lineprofile has not changed greatly in the switch from soft to hard states, andthat the differences are consistent with changes in the underlying reflectionspectrum rather than the relativistic blurring. we find that the blurringparameters are consistent when fitting either just the iron line or the entirebroad-band spectrum, which is well modelled with a comptonized continuum plusreflection model.

1506.01381	the complex accretion geometry of gx 339-4 as seen by nustar and swift	we present spectral analysis of five nustar and swift observations of gx339-4 taken during a failed outburst in summer 2013. these observations covereddington luminosity fractions in the range ~0.9-6%. throughout this outburst,gx 339-4 stayed in the hard state, and all five observations show similar x-rayspectra with a hard power-law with a photon index near 1.6 and significantcontribution from reflection. using simple reflection models we findunrealistically high iron abundances. allowing for different photon indices forthe continuum incident on the reflector relative to the underlying observedcontinuum results in a statistically better fit and reduced iron abundances.with a photon index around 1.3, the input power-law on the reflector issignificantly harder than that which is directly observed. we study theinfluence of different emissivity profiles and geometries and consistently findan improvement when using separate photon indices. the inferred inner accretiondisk radius is strongly model dependent, but we do not find evidence for atruncation radius larger than 100 r_g in any model. the data do not allowindependent spin constraints but the results are consistent with the literature(i.e., a&gt;0). our best-fit models indicate an inclination angle in the range40-60 degrees, consistent with limits on the orbital inclination but higherthan reported in the literature using standard reflection models. the iron linearound 6.4 kev is clearly broadened, and we detect a superimposed narrow coreas well. this core originates from a fluorescence region outside the influenceof the strong gravity of the black hole and we discuss possible geometries.

0805.2151	discovery of a strong baldwin effect in mid-infrared agn lines	we present the discovery of a baldwin effect in 8 nearby seyfert galaxies forthe three most prominent mid-infrared forbidden emission lines observable fromthe ground that are commonly found in agn, [ariii](8.99 micron), [siv](10.51micron), and [neii](12.81 micron). the observations were carried out using thevlt/visir imager and spectroraph at the eso/paranal observatory. the bulk ofthe observed line emission comes from the inner &lt;0.4 arcsec which correspondsto spatial scales &lt;100 pc in our object sample. the correlation index isapproximately -0.6 without significant difference among the lines. this is thestrongest anti-correlation between line equivalent width and continuumluminosity found so far. in the case of circinus, we show that despite the useof mid-infrared lines, obscuration by either the host galaxy or thecircumnuclear dust torus might affect the equivalent widths. given the smallobserved spatial scales from which most of the line emission emanates, it isunclear how these observations fit into the favored "disappearing nlr''scenario for the narrow-line baldwin effect.

1506.05120	nustar reveals extreme absorption in z &lt; 0.5 type 2 quasars	the intrinsic column density (nh) distribution of quasars is poorly known. atthe high obscuration end of the quasar population and for redshifts z&lt;1, thex-ray spectra can only be reliably characterized using broad-band measurementswhich extend to energies above 10 kev. using the hard x-ray observatory nustar,along with archival chandra and xmm-newton data, we study the broad-band x-rayspectra of nine optically selected (from the sdss), candidate compton-thick (nh&gt; 1.5e24 cm^-2) type 2 quasars (ctqso2s); five new nustar observations arereported herein, and four have been previously published. the candidate ctqso2slie at z&lt;0.5, have observed [oiii] luminosities in the range 8.4 &lt; log(l_[oiii]/l_solar) &lt; 9.6, and show evidence for extreme, compton-thickabsorption when indirect absorption diagnostics are considered. amongst thenine candidate ctqso2s, five are detected by nustar in the high energy (8-24kev) band: two are weakly detected at the ~ 3 sigma confidence level and threeare strongly detected with sufficient counts for spectral modeling (&gt;~ 90 netsource counts at 8-24 kev). for these nustar-detected sources direct (i.e.,x-ray spectral) constraints on the intrinsic agn properties are feasible, andwe measure column densities ~2.5-1600 times higher and intrinsic (unabsorbed)x-ray luminosities ~10-70 times higher than pre-nustar constraints from chandraand xmm-newton. assuming the nustar-detected type 2 quasars are representativeof other compton-thick candidates, we make a correction to the nh distributionfor optically selected type 2 quasars as measured by chandra and xmm-newton for39 objects. with this approach, we predict a compton-thick fraction of f_ct =36^{+14}_{-12} %, although higher fractions (up to 76%) are possible ifindirect absorption diagnostics are assumed to be reliable.

1509.03322	nustar observations of the compton-thick active galactic nucleus and  ultraluminous x-ray source candidate in ngc 5643	we present two nustar observations of the local seyfert 2 active galacticnucleus (agn) and an ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx) candidate in ngc 5643.together with archival data from chandra, xmm-newton and swift-bat, we performa high-quality broadband spectral analysis of the agn over two decades inenergy ($\sim$0.5-100 kev). previous x-ray observations suggested that the agnis obscured by a compton-thick (ct) column of obscuring gas along ourline-of-sight. however, the lack of high-quality $\gtrsim$ 10 kev observations,together with the presence of a nearby x-ray luminous source, ngc 5643 x-1, hadleft significant uncertainties in the characterization of the nuclear spectrum.nustar now enables the agn and ngc 5643 x-1 to be separately resolved above 10kev for the first time and allows a direct measurement of the absorbing columndensity toward the nucleus. the new data show that the nucleus is indeedobscured by a ct column of $n_{\rm{h}}$ $\gtrsim$ 5 $\times$ 10$^{24}$cm$^{-2}$. the range of 2-10 kev absorption-corrected luminosity inferred fromthe best fitting models is $l_{2-10,\rm{int}} =$ (0.8-1.7) $\times$ 10$^{42}$erg s$^{-1}$, consistent with that predicted from multiwavelength intrinsicluminosity indicators. we also study the nustar data for ngc 5643 x-1, and showthat it exhibits evidence for a spectral cut-off at energy, $e$ $\sim$ 10 kev,similar to that seen in other ulxs observed by nustar. along with the evidencefor significant x-ray luminosity variations in the 3-8 kev band from 2003-2014,our results further strengthen the ulx classification of ngc 5643 x-1.

1510.04477	the hard x-ray emission of the luminous infrared galaxy ngc 6240 as  observed by nustar	we present a broad-band (~0.3-70 kev) spectral and temporal analysis ofnustar observations of the luminous infrared galaxy ngc 6240, combined witharchival chandra, xmm-newton and bepposax data. ngc 6240 is a galaxy in arelatively early merger state with two distinct nuclei separated by ~1."5.previous chandra observations have resolved the two nuclei, showing that theyare both active and obscured by compton-thick material. although they cannot beresolved by nustar, thanks to the unprecedented quality of the nustar data atenergies &gt;10 kev, we clearly detect, for the first time, both the primary andthe reflection continuum components. the nustar hard x-ray spectrum isdominated by the primary continuum piercing through an absorbing column densitywhich is mildly optically thick to compton scattering (tau ~ 1.2, n_h ~ 1.5 x10^(24) cm^-2). we detect moderate hard x-ray (&gt; 10 kev) flux variability up to20% on short (15-20 ksec) timescales. the amplitude of the variability ismaximum at ~30 kev and is likely to originate from the primary continuum of thesouthern nucleus. nevertheless, the mean hard x-ray flux on longer timescales(years) is relatively constant. moreover, the two nuclei remain compton-thick,although we find evidence of variability of the material along the line ofsight with column densities n_h &lt;~ 2 x 10^(23) cm-2 over long (~3-15 years)timescales. the observed x-ray emission in the nustar energy range is fullyconsistent with the sum of the best-fit models of the spatially resolvedchandra spectra of the two nuclei.

1510.08122	a connection between plasma conditions near black hole event horizons  and outflow properties	accreting black holes are responsible for producing the fastest, mostpowerful outflows of matter in the universe. the formation process of powerfuljets close to black holes is poorly understood, and the conditions leading tojet formation are currently hotly debated. in this paper, we report anunambiguous empirical correlation between the properties of the plasma close tothe black hole and the particle acceleration properties within jets launchedfrom the central regions of accreting stellar-mass and supermassive blackholes. in these sources the emission of the plasma near the black hole ischaracterized by a power law at x-ray energies during times when the jets areproduced. we find that the photon index of this power law, which givesinformation on the underlying particle distribution, correlates with thecharacteristic break frequency in the jet spectrum, which is dependent onmagnetohydrodynamical processes in the outflow. the observed range in breakfrequencies varies by five orders of magnitude, in sources that span nineorders of magnitude in black hole mass, revealing a similarity of jetproperties over a large range of black hole masses powering these jets. thiscorrelation demonstrates that the internal properties of the jet rely mostcritically on the conditions of the plasma close to the black hole, rather thanother parameters such as the black hole mass or spin, and will provide abenchmark that should be reproduced by the jet formation models.

1511.01951	the nustar view of reflection and absorption in ngc 7582	ngc 7582 is a well-studied x-ray bright seyfert 2 with moderately heavy($n_{\text{h}}\sim10^{23}-10^{24}$~cm$^{-2}$), highly variable absorption andstrong reflection spectral features. the spectral shape changed around the year2000, dropping in observed flux and becoming much more highly absorbed. twoscenarios have been put forth to explain this spectral change: 1) the centralx-ray source partially ``shut off'' around this time, decreasing in intrinsicluminosity, with a delayed decrease in reflection features due to thelight-crossing time of the compton-thick material or 2) the source became moreheavily obscured, with only a portion of the power law continuum leakingthrough. nustar observed ngc~7582 twice in 2012, two weeks apart, in order toquantify the reflection using high-quality data above 10 kev. we find that themost plausible scenario is that ngc 7582 has recently become more heavilyabsorbed by a patchy torus with a covering fraction of $\sim\,80-90\%$ and anequatorial column density of $\sim 3 \times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. we find the needfor an additional highly variable full-covering absorber with $n_{\text{h}}=4-6 \times10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the line of sight, possibly associated with ahidden broad line region.

1511.04183	the nustar extragalactic surveys: the number counts of active galactic  nuclei and the resolved fraction of the cosmic x-ray background	we present the 3-8 kev and 8-24 kev number counts of active galactic nuclei(agn) identified in the nustar extragalactic surveys. nustar has now resolvedapproximately 35% of the x-ray background in the 8-24 kev band, directlyidentifying agn with obscuring columns up to 1e25 / cm2. in the softer 3-8 kevband the number counts are in general agreement with those measured byxmm-newton and chandra over the flux range 5e-15 &lt; s(3 - 8 kev)/(erg/cm2/s) &lt;1e-12 probed by nustar. in the hard 8-24 kev band nustar probes fluxes over therange 2e-14 &lt; s(8-24 kev)/(erg/cm2/s) &lt; 1e-12, a factor of approximately 100fainter than previous measurements covering this energy range. the slope of the8-24 kev number counts closely matches predictions from agn populationsynthesis models that account for the shape and intensity of the diffuse cosmicx-ray background. this directly confirms the existence of a population ofobscured and/or hard x-ray sources inferred from the shape of the integrateddiffuse cosmic x-ray background. the measured nustar counts lie significantlyabove simple extrapolations of the swift/bat 15-55 kev number counts measuredat higher fluxes, s(15-55 kev) &gt; 1e-11 erg/cm2/s, for any realistic agnspectral model. the most natural explanation for the difference is an evolutionin the agn poulation between the very local objects seen by bat and the moredistant (0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1) nustar sample that is not accounted for in the currentmodels.
