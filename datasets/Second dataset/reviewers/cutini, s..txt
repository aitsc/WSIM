0902.2959	first agile catalog of high confidence gamma-ray sources	we present the first catalog of high-confidence gamma-ray sources detected bythe agile satellite during observations performed from july 9, 2007 to june 30,2008. catalogued sources are detected by merging all the available data overthe entire time period. agile, launched in april 2007, is an asi missiondevoted to gamma-ray observations in the 30 mev - 50 gev energy range, withsimultaneous x-ray imaging capability in the 18-60 kev band. this catalog isbased on gamma-ray imaging detector (grid) data for energies greater than 100mev. for the first agile catalog we adopted a conservative analysis, with ahigh-quality event filter optimized to select gamma-ray events within thecentral zone of the instrument field of view (radius of 40 degrees). this is asignificance-limited (4 sigma) catalog, and it is not a complete flux-limitedsample due to the non-uniform first year agile sky coverage. the catalogincludes 47 sources, 21 of which are associated with confirmed or candidatepulsars, 13 with blazars (7 fsrq, 4 bl lacs, 2 unknown type), 2 with hmxrbs, 2with snrs, 1 with a colliding-wind binary system, 8 with unidentified sources.

0906.1446	observation of grbs with agile	since its early phases of operation, the agile satellite is observing gammaray bursts (grbs) over an energy range potentially spanning six orders ofmagnitude. in the hard x-ray band the superagile imager provides localizationof about one grb/month plus the detection of 1-2 grbs per month out of itsfield of view. the mini-calorimeter detects about one grb/week in the 350kev -100mev energy range, plus several other transients at very short time scales.in fact, the on-board mcal trigger logic, implemented for the first time ontime windows as short as 300 microseconds, is particularly suitable for veryshort bursts detection. the gamma-ray imaging detector (grid), sensitive in the30mev - 30gev range, firmly detected three grbs (grb080514b, grb090401b andgrb090510) plus some other candidates at a lower significance level. moreover,all grbs localized by other spacecrafts inside the grid field of view arecurrently searched for possible detection, and upper limits are provided. inthis paper we review the status of the observation of grbs with agile, withparticular emphasis on high energy and short time scales detections.

0907.0087	a multiwavelength study of swift grb 060111b constraining the origin of  its prompt optical emission	in this work, we present the results obtained from a multi-wavelengthcampaign, as well as from the public swift/bat, xrt, and uvot data of grb060111b for which a bright optical emission was measured with good temporalresolution during the prompt phase. we identified the host galaxy at r~25 mag;its featureless spectral continuum and brightness, as well as the non-detectionof any associated supernova 16 days after the trigger and other independentredshift estimates, converge to z~1-2. from the analysis of the early afterglowsed, we find that non-negligible host galaxy dust extinction, in addition tothe galactic one, affects the observed flux in the optical regime. theextinction-corrected optical-to-gamma-ray spectral energy distribution duringthe prompt emission shows a flux density ratio $f_{\gamma}/f_{opt}$=0.01-0.0001with spectral index $\beta_{\gamma,opt}&gt; \beta_{\gamma}$, strongly suggesting aseparate origin of the optical and gamma-ray components. this result issupported by the lack of correlated behavior in the prompt emission lightcurves observed in the two energy domains. the properties of the prompt opticalemission observed during grb 060111b favor interpretation of this optical lightas radiation from the reverse shock in a thick shell limit and in the slowcooling regime. the expected peak flux is consistent with the observed onecorrected for the host extinction, likely indicating that the starting time ofthe tarot observations is very near to or coincident with the peak time. theestimated fireball initial lorentz factor is &gt;260-360 at z=1-2, similar to thelorentz factors obtained from other grbs. grb 060111b is a rare, good test caseof the reverse shock emission mechanism in both the x-ray and optical energyranges.

0908.0652	the number counts, luminosity functions and evolution of  microwave-selected (wmap) blazars and radio galaxies	(abridged) we carried out an extensive search to identify the counterparts ofall the sources listed in the wmap 3-yr catalogue using literature and archivaldata. our work led to the identification of 309 wmap sources, 98% of which areblazars, radio quasars or radio galaxies. at present, 15 objects still remainwithout identification due to the lack of optical spectroscopic data or a clearradio counterpart. our results allow us to define a flux limited sample of 203high galactic latitude microwave sources ($f_{41ghz} \ge 1$ jy, $|b_{\rm ii}| &gt;15^\circ$) which is virtually completely identified (99%). the microwave bandis ideally suited for blazar statistical studies since this is the part of theem spectrum that is least affected by the superposition of spectral componentsof different origin. using this data-set we derived number counts, luminosityfunctions and cosmological evolution of blazars and radio galaxies at microwavefrequencies. our results are in good agreement with those found at radiofrequencies. the 5 ghz bivariate blazar luminosity functions are similar tothose derived from the dxrbs survey, which shows that this sample isrepresentative of the blazar population at 41 ghz. microwave selected broad-lined quasars are about 6 times more abundant than bl lacs, a ratio that issimilar to, or larger than, that seen at radio and gamma-ray frequencies, oncespectral selection effects are taken into account. this strongly suggests thatthe mechanism responsible for the generation of gamma-rays is, at first order,the same in all blazar types. our results confirm the findings of giommi &amp;colafrancesco (2004, 2006) that blazars and radio galaxies are the largestcontaminants of the cmb anisotropy maps. we predict that these sources are alsobright gamma-ray sources, most of which will be detected by agile and fermi.

0910.4895	monitoring the hard x-ray sky with superagile	superagile is the hard x-ray monitor of the agile gamma ray mission, in orbitsince 23$^{rd}$ april 2007. it is an imaging experiment based on a set of fourindependent silicon strip detectors, equipped with one-dimensional coded masks,operating in the nominal energy range 18-60 kev. the main goal of superagile isthe observation of cosmic sources simultaneously with the main gamma-ray agileexperiment, the gamma ray imaging detector (grid). given its$\sim$steradian-wide field of view and its $\sim$15 mcrab day-sensitivity,superagile is also well suited for the long-term monitoring of galactic compactobjects and the detection of bright transients. the superagile detectorproperties and design allow for a 6 arcmin angular resolution in each of thetwo independent orthogonal projections of the celestial coordinates. photon byphoton data are continuously available by the experiment telemetry, and areused to derive images and fluxes of individual sources, with integration timesdepending on the source intensity and position in the field of view. in thispaper we report on the main scientific results achieved by superagile over itsfirst two years in orbit, until april 2009.

0911.3743	temporal properties of gx 301-2 over a year-long observation with  superagile	we present the long-term monitoring of the high mass x-ray binary gx 301-2performed with the superagile instrument on-board the agile mission. the sourcewas monitored in the 20-60 kev energy band during the first year of the missionfrom 2007 july 17 to 2008 august 31, covering about one whole orbital periodand three more pre-periastron passages for a total net observation time ofabout 3.7 ms. the superagile dataset represents one of the most continuous andcomplete monitoring at hard x-ray energies of the 41.5 day long binary periodavailable to date. the source behavior was characterized at all orbital phasesin terms of hard x-ray flux, spectral hardness, spin period history, pulsedfraction and pulse shape profile. we also complemented the superagileobservations with the soft x-ray data of the rossixte/asm. our analysis shows aclear orbital modulation of the spectral hardness, with peaks in correspondencewith the pre-periastron flare and near phase 0.25. the hardness peaks we foundcould be related with the wind-plus-stream accretion model proposed in order toexplain the orbital light curve modulation of gx 301-2. timing analysis of thepulsar spin period shows that the secular trend of the about 680 s pulse periodis consistent with the previous observations, although there is evidence of aslight decrease in the spin-down rate. the analysis of the hard x-ray pulsedemission also showed a variable pulse shape profile as a function of theorbital phase, with substructures detected near the passage at the periastron,and a clear modulation of the pulsed fraction, which appears in turn stronglyanti-correlated with the source intensity.

0912.2040	the spectral energy distribution of fermi bright blazars	(abridged) we have conducted a detailed investigation of the broad-bandspectral properties of the \gamma-ray selected blazars of the fermi lat brightagn sample (lbas). by combining our accurately estimated fermi gamma-rayspectra with swift, radio, infra-red, optical and other hard x-ray/gamma-raydata, collected within three months of the lbas data taking period, we wereable to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous spectral energydistributions (sed) for 48 lbas blazars.the sed of these gamma-ray sources issimilar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, inthe usual log $\nu $ - log $\nu$ f$_\nu$ representation, the typical broad-bandspectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energysynchrotron radiation followed by inverse compton emission of one or morecomponents. we have used these seds to characterize the peak intensity of boththe low and the high-energy components. the results have been used to deriveempirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from thebroad-band colors (i.e. the radio to optical and optical to x-ray spectralslopes) and from the gamma-ray spectral index. our data show that thesynchrotron peak frequency $\nu_p^s$ is positioned between 10$^{12.5}$ and10$^{14.5}$ hz in broad-lined fsrqs and between $10^{13}$ and $10^{17}$ hz infeatureless bl lacertae objects.we find that the gamma-ray spectral slope isstrongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the x-rayspectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron - inverse comptonscenarios. however, simple homogeneous, one-zone, synchrotron self compton(ssc) models cannot explain most of our seds, especially in the case of fsrqsand low energy peaked (lbl) bl lacs.

1002.4415	constraints on cosmological dark matter annihilation from the fermi-lat  isotropic diffuse gamma-ray measurement	the first published fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat) measurement of theisotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single powerlaw, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from darkmatter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 gev. we use the absolute sizeand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits onthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,charged leptons and monochromatic photons. predicted gamma-ray fluxes fromannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distributionof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structureformation we assess these uncertainties. we also quantify how the dark matterconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on theuniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. in reasonable background anddark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it ispossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons andpositrons measured by the fermi-lat and pamela experiments. derived limits alsostart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. inminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. for themonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only darkmatter scenarios with very strong signals.

1101.2047	planck early results. xv. spectral energy distributions and radio  continuum spectra of northern extragalactic radio sources	spectral energy distributions (seds) and radio continuum spectra arepresented for a northern sample of 104 extragalactic radio sources, based onthe planck early release compact source catalogue (ercsc) and simultaneousmultifrequency data. the nine planck frequencies, from 30 to 857 ghz, arecomplemented by a set of simultaneous observations ranging from radio togamma-rays. this is the first extensive frequency coverage in the radio andmillimetre domains for an essentially complete sample of extragalactic radiosources, and it shows how the individual shocks, each in their own phase ofdevelopment, shape the radio spectra as they move in the relativistic jet. theseds presented in this paper were fitted with second and third degreepolynomials to estimate the frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse compton(ic) peaks, and the spectral indices of low and high frequency radio data,including the planck ercsc data, were calculated. sed modelling methods arediscussed, with an emphasis on proper, physical modelling of the synchrotronbump using multiplecomponents. planck ercsc data also suggest that the originalaccelerated electron energy spectrum could be much harder than commonlythought, with power-law index around 1.5 instead of the canonical 2.5. theimplications of this are discussed for the acceleration mechanisms effective inblazar shock. furthermore in many cases the planck data indicate that gamma-rayemission must originate in the same shocks that produce the radio emission.

1111.0430	fermi-lat spectral analysis of fermi, planck, swift and radio selected  samples of agn	blazars are jet-dominated extragalactic objects characterized by the emissionof strongly variable non-thermal radiation across the entire electromagneticspectrum. therefore, the study of blazars (and in general of radio loud agn)through the use of multi-frequency simultaneous data is essential in order tounderstand the physical processes that take place in these objects. withplanck, fermi and swift simultaneously on orbit, complemented with other spaceand ground-based observatories, it is possible to assemble high-qualitymulti-frequency simultaneous broad-band spectra of large and statisticallywell-defined samples of radio-loud agn. in particular, four samples of sourceshave been selected. the first three samples are flux limited in the high energypart of the electromagnetic spectrum: the soft x-ray (0.1-2 kev) sampleincludes 43 sources from the rosat all sky survey bright source catalog, thehard x-ray (15-150 kev) sample includes 34 sources from the swift-bat 54 monthssource catalog and the gamma-ray sample includes 50 sources from the fermi-lat3 months bright agn source list. the fourth sample is radio flux limited,including 104 bright northern and equatorial radio-loud agn (most of which havebeen monitored at metsahovi radio observatory for many years) with averageradio flux density at 37 ghz greater than 1 jy. we present the methods appliedand the results of the analysis performed using fermi-lat data for all sourcesin the four different samples of agn.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1205.6474	constraints on the galactic halo dark matter from fermi-lat diffuse  measurements	we have performed an analysis of the diffuse gamma-ray emission with thefermi large area telescope in the milky way halo region searching for a signalfrom dark matter annihilation or decay. in the absence of a robust dark mattersignal, constraints are presented. we consider both gamma rays produceddirectly in the dark matter annihilation/decay and produced by inverse comptonscattering of the e+e- produced in the annihilation/decay. conservative limitsare derived requiring that the dark matter signal does not exceed the observeddiffuse gamma-ray emission. a second set of more stringent limits is derivedbased on modeling the foreground astrophysical diffuse emission using thegalprop code. uncertainties in the height of the diffusive cosmic-ray halo, thedistribution of the cosmic-ray sources in the galaxy, the index of theinjection cosmic-ray electron spectrum and the column density of theinterstellar gas are taken into account using a profile likelihood formalism,while the parameters governing the cosmic-ray propagation have been derivedfrom fits to local cosmic-ray data. the resulting limits impact the range ofparticle masses over which dark matter thermal production in the early universeis possible, and challenge the interpretation of the pamela/fermi-lat cosmicray anomalies as annihilation of dark matter.

1206.1346	gev observations of star-forming galaxies with \textit{fermi} lat	recent detections of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 by gamma-raytelescopes suggest that galaxies rapidly forming massive stars are moreluminous at gamma-ray energies compared to their quiescent relatives. buildingupon those results, we examine a sample of 69 dwarf, spiral, and luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies at photon energies 0.1-100 gev using 3 years ofdata collected by the large area telescope (lat) on the \textit{fermi gamma-rayspace telescope} (\textit{fermi}). measured fluxes from significantly detectedsources and flux upper limits for the remaining galaxies are used to explorethe physics of cosmic rays in galaxies. we find further evidence forquasi-linear scaling relations between gamma-ray luminosity and both radiocontinuum luminosity and total infrared luminosity which apply both toquiescent galaxies of the local group and low-redshift starburst galaxies(conservative $p$-values $\lesssim0.05$ accounting for statistical andsystematic uncertainties). the normalizations of these scaling relationscorrespond to luminosity ratios of $\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{1.4 \rm{ghz}})= 1.7 \pm 0.1_{\rm (statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ and$\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{8-1000 \mu\rm{m}}) = -4.3 \pm 0.1_{\rm(statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ for a galaxy with a star formationrate of 1 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a chabrier initial mass function.using the relationship between infrared luminosity and gamma-ray luminosity,the collective intensity of unresolved star-forming galaxies at redshifts$0&lt;z&lt;2.5$ above 0.1 gev is estimated to be 0.4-2.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ phcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (4-23% of the intensity of the isotropic diffusecomponent measured with the lat). we anticipate that $\sim10$ galaxies could bedetected by their cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission during a 10-year\textit{fermi} mission.

1508.00779	psr j1906+0722: an elusive gamma-ray pulsar	we report the discovery of psr j1906+0722, a gamma-ray pulsar detected aspart of a blind survey of unidentified fermi large area telescope (lat) sourcesbeing carried out on the volunteer distributed computing system, einstein@home.this newly discovered pulsar previously appeared as the most significantremaining unidentified gamma-ray source without a known association in thesecond fermi-lat source catalog (2fgl) and was among the top ten mostsignificant unassociated sources in the recent third catalog (3fgl). psrj1906+0722 is a young, energetic, isolated pulsar, with a spin frequency of$8.9$ hz, a characteristic age of $49$ kyr, and spin-down power $1.0 \times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. in 2009 august it suffered one of the largest glitchesdetected from a gamma-ray pulsar ($\delta f / f \approx 4.5\times10^{-6}$).remaining undetected in dedicated radio follow-up observations, the pulsar islikely radio-quiet. an off-pulse analysis of the gamma-ray flux from thelocation of psr j1906+0722 revealed the presence of an additional nearbysource, which may be emission from the interaction between a neighboringsupernova remnant and a molecular cloud. we discuss possible effects which mayhave hindered the detection of psr j1906+0722 in previous searches and describethe methods by which these effects were mitigated in this survey. we alsodemonstrate the use of advanced timing methods for estimating the positional,spin and glitch parameters of difficult-to-time pulsars such as this.

1510.00004	search for extended gamma-ray emission from the virgo galaxy cluster  with fermi-lat	galaxy clusters are one of the prime sites to search for dark matter (dm)annihilation signals. depending on the substructure of the dm halo of a galaxycluster and the cross sections for dm annihilation channels, these signalsmight be detectable by the latest generation of $\gamma$-ray telescopes. herewe use three years of fermi large area telescope (lat) data, which are the mostsuitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of nearbyvirgo galaxy cluster. our analysis reveals statistically significant extendedemission which can be well characterized by a uniformly emitting disk profilewith a radius of 3\deg that moreover is offset from the cluster center. wedemonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends onthe adopted interstellar emission model (iem) and is most likely an artifact ofour incomplete description of the iem in this region. we also search for andfind new point source candidates in the region. we then derive conservativeupper limits on the velocity-averaged dm pair annihilation cross section fromvirgo. we take into account the potential $\gamma$-ray flux enhancement due todm sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. for dmannihilating into $b\overline{b}$, assuming a conservative sub-halo modelsetup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1.5 orders of magnitude above theexpectation from the thermal cross section for$m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim100\,\mathrm{gev}$. in a more optimistic scenario, weexclude $\langle \sigma v \rangle\sim3\times10^{-26}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$for $m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim40\,\mathrm{gev}$ for the same channel. finally, wederive upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-rayinteractions in the inter cluster medium. we find that the volume-averagedcosmic-ray-to-thermal pressure ratio is less than $\sim6\%$.

0806.1855	agile and swift simultaneous observations of the blazar s50716+714  during the bright flare of october 2007	we present the results of a series of optical, uv, x-ray and gamma-rayobservations of the bl lac object s50716+714 carried out by the swift and agilesatellites in late 2007 when this blazar was flaring close to its historicalmaximum at optical frequencies. we have found that the optical through softx-ray emission, likely due to synchrotron radiation, was highly variable anddisplayed a different behavior in the optical uv and soft x-ray bands. the 4-10kev flux, most probably dominated by the inverse compton component, remainedinstead constant. the counting statistics in the relatively short agile gridobservation was low and consistent with a constant gamma-ray flux at a levelsimilar to the maximum observed by egret. an estimate of the gamma-ray spectralslope gives a value of the photon index that is close to 2 suggesting that thepeak of the inverse compton component in the spectral energy distribution (sed)is within the agile energy band. the different variability behavior observed indifferent parts of the sed exclude interpretations predicting highly correlatedflux variability like changes of the beaming factor or of the magnetic field insimple ssc scenarios. the observed sed changes may instead be interpreted asdue to the sum of two ssc components, one of which is constant while the otheris variable and with a systematically higher synchrotron peak energy.

1511.06778	the 1st fermi lat supernova remnant catalog	to uniformly determine the properties of supernova remnants (snrs) at highenergies, we have developed the first systematic survey at energies from 1 to100 gev using data from the fermi large area telescope. based on the spatialoverlap of sources detected at gev energies with snrs known from radio surveys,we classify 30 sources as likely gev snrs. we also report 14 marginalassociations and 245 flux upper limits. a mock catalog in which the positionsof known remnants are scrambled in galactic longitude, allows us to determinean upper limit of 22% on the number of gev candidates falsely identified assnrs. we have also developed a method to estimate spectral and spatialsystematic errors arising from the diffuse interstellar emission model, a keycomponent of all galactic fermi lat analyses. by studying remnants uniformly inaggregate, we measure the gev properties common to these objects and provide acrucial context for the detailed modeling of individual snrs. combining our gevresults with multiwavelength (mw) data, including radio, x-ray, and tev,demonstrates the need for improvements to previously sufficient, simple modelsdescribing the gev and radio emission from these objects. we model the gev andmw emission from snrs in aggregate to constrain their maximal contribution toobserved galactic cosmic rays.

0808.3464	long-term agile monitoring of the puzzling gamma-ray source 3eg  j1835+5918	we present the agile gamma-ray observations of the field containing thepuzzling gamma-ray source 3eg j1835+5918. this source is one of the mostremarkable unidentified egret sources. an unprecedentedly long agile monitoringof this source yields important information on the positional error box, fluxevolution, and spectrum. 3eg j1835+5918 has been in the agile field of viewseveral times in 2007 and 2008 for a total observing time of 138 days from 2007sept 04 to 2008 june 30 encompassing several weeks of continuous coverage. withan exposure time approximately twice that of egret, agile confirms theexistence of a prominent gamma-ray source (agl j1836+5926) at a positionconsistent with that of egret, although with a remarkably lower average fluxvalue for photon energies greater than 100 mev. a 5-day bin temporal analysisof the whole data set of agl j1836+5926 shows some evidence for variability ofthe gamma-ray flux. the source spectrum between 100 mev and 1 gev can be fittedwith a power law with photon index in the range 1.6-1.7, fully consistent withthe egret value. the faint x-ray source rx j1836.2+5925 that has been proposedas a possible counterpart of 3eg j1835+5918 is well within the agile error box.future continuous monitoring (both by agile and glast) is needed to confirm thegamma-ray flux variability and to unveil the source origin, a subject that iscurrently being pursued through a multiwavelength search for counterparts.

0808.4053	agile detection of variable gamma-ray activity from the blazar s5  0716+714 in september-october 2007	we report the gamma-ray activity from the intermediate bl lac s5 0716+714during observations acquired by the agile satellite in september and october2007. these detections of activity were contemporaneous with a period ofintense optical activity, which was monitored by gasp-webt. this simultaneousoptical and gamma-ray coverage allows us to study in detail the light curves,time lags, gamma-ray photon spectrum, and spectral energy distributions (seds)during different states of activity. agile observed the source with its twoco-aligned imagers, the gamma-ray imaging detector (grid) and the hard x-rayimager (super-agile), which are sensitive to the 30 mev-50 gev and 18-60 kevenergy ranges, respectively. observations were completed in two differentperiods, the first between 2007 september 4-23, and the second between 2007october 24-november 1. over the period 2007 september 7-12, agile detectedgamma-ray emission from the source at a significance level of 9.6-sigma with anaverage flux (e&gt;100 mev) of (97 +/- 15) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}, whichincreased by a factor of at least four within three days. no emission wasdetected by super-agile for the energy range 18-60 kev to a 3-sigma upper limitof 10 mcrab in 335 ksec. in october 2007, agile repointed toward s5 0716+714following an intense optical flare, measuring an average flux of (47 +/- 11) x10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} at a significance level of 6.0-sigma. thegamma-ray flux of s5 0716+714 detected by agile is the highest ever detectedfor this blazar and one of the most intense gamma-ray fluxes detected from a bllac object. the sed of mid-september appears to be consistent with thesynchrotron self-compton (ssc) emission model, but only by including two ssccomponents of different variabilities.

0809.1230	agile detection of delayed gamma-ray emission from grb 080514b	grb 080514b is the first gamma ray burst (grb), since the time of egret, forwhich individual photons of energy above several tens of mev have been detectedwith a pair-conversion tracker telescope. this burst was discovered with theitalian agile gamma-ray satellite. the grb was localized with a cooperation byagile and the interplanetary network (ipn). the gamma-ray imager (grid)estimate of the position, obtained before the superagile-ipn localization, isfound to be consistent with the burst position. the hard x-ray emissionobserved by superagile lasted about 7 s, while there is evidence that theemission above 30 mev extends for a longer duration (at least ~13 s). similarbehavior was seen in the past from a few other grbs observed with egret.however, the latter measurements were affected, during the brightest phases, byinstrumental dead time effects, resulting in only lower limits to the burstintensity. thanks to the small dead time of the agile/grid we could assess thatin the case of grb 080514b the gamma-ray to x-ray flux ratio changessignificantly between the prompt and extended emission phase.

0809.1737	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3. i. the agile 2007 november  campaign on the "crazy diamond"	[abridged] we report on a multiwavelength observation of the blazar 3c 454.3(which we dubbed "crazy diamond") carried out on november 2007 by means of theastrophysical satellites agile, integral, swift, the webt consortium, and theoptical-nir telescope rem. 3c 454.3 is detected at a $\sim 19-\sigma$ levelduring the 3-week observing period, with an average flux above 100 mev of$f_{\rm e&gt;100mev} = (170 \pm 13) \times 10^{-8}$ \phcmsec. the gamma-rayspectrum can be fit with a single power-law with photon index $\gamma_{\rmgrid} = 1.73 \pm 0.16$ between 100 mev and 1 gev. we detect significantday-by-day variability of the gamma-ray emission during our observations, andwe can exclude that the fluxes are constant at the 99.6% ($\sim 2.9 \sigma$)level. the source was detected typically around 40 degrees off-axis, and it wassubstantially off--axis in the field of view of the agile hard x-ray imager.however, a 5-day long too observation by integral detected 3c 454.3 at anaverage flux of about $f_{\rm 20-200 kev} = 1.49 \times 10^{-3}$ \phcmsec withan average photon index of $\gamma_{\rm ibis} = 1.75 \pm 0.24$ between 20--200kev. swift also detected 3c 454.3 with a flux in the 0.3--10 kev energy band inthe range $(1.23-1.40) \times 10^{-2}$ \phcmsec{} and a photon index in therange $\gamma_{\rm xrt} = 1.56-1.73$. in the optical band, both webt and remshow an extremely variable behavior in the $r$ band. a correlation analysisbased on the entire data set is consistent with no time-lags between thegamma-ray and the optical flux variations. our simultaneous multifrequencyobservations strongly indicate that the dominant emission mechanism between 30mev and 30 gev is dominated by inverse compton scattering of relativisticelectrons in the jet on the external photons from the broad line region.

0809.3917	gamma-ray burst detection with the agile mini-calorimeter	the mini-calorimeter (mcal) instrument on-board the agile satellite is anon-imaging gamma-ray scintillation detector sensitive in the 300kev-100mevenergy range with a total on-axis geometrical area of 1400cm^2. gamma-raybursts (grbs) are one of the main scientific targets of the agile mission andthe mcal design as an independent self-triggering detector makes it a valuableall-sky monitor for grbs. furthermore mcal is one of the very few operativeinstruments with microsecond timing capabilities in the mev range. in thispaper the results of grb detections with mcal after one year of operation inspace are presented and discussed. a flexible trigger logic implemented in theagile payload data-handling unit allows the on-board detection of grbs. fortriggered events, energy and timing information are sent to telemetry on aphoton-by-photon basis, so that energy and time binning are limited by countingstatistics only. when the trigger logic is not active, grbs can be detectedoffline in ratemeter data, although with worse energy and time resolution.between the end of june 2007 and june 2008 mcal detected 51 grbs, with adetection rate of about 1 grb/week, plus several other events at a fewmilliseconds timescales. since february 2008 the on-board trigger logic hasbeen fully active. comparison of mcal detected events and data provided byother space instruments confirms the sensitivity and effective areaestimations. mcal also joined the 3rd inter-planetary network, to contribute togrb localization by means of triangulation.
