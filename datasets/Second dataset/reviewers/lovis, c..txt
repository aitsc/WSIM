0706.2174	planets around evolved intermediate-mass stars. i. two substellar  companions in the open clusters ngc 2423 and ngc 4349	context. many efforts are being made to characterize extrasolar planetarysystems and unveil the fundamental mechanisms of planet formation. an importantaspect of the problem, which remains largely unknown, is to understand how theplanet formation process depends on the mass of the parent star. in particular,as most planets discovered to date orbit a solar-mass primary, little is knownabout planet formation around more massive stars. aims. to investigate thispoint, we present first results from a radial velocity planet search around redgiants in the clump of intermediate-age open clusters. we choose clustersharbouring red giants with masses between 1.5 and 4 m_sun, using the well-knowncluster parameters to accurately determine the stellar masses. we are thereforeexploring a poorly-known domain of primary masses, which will bring newinsights into the properties of extrasolar planetary systems. methods. we arefollowing a sample of about 115 red giants with the coralie and harpsspectrographs to obtain high-precision radial velocity (rv) measurements anddetect giant planets around these stars. we use bisector and activity indexdiagnostics to distinguish between planetary-induced rv variations and stellarphotospheric jitter. results. we present the discoveries of a giant planet anda brown dwarf in the open clusters ngc 2423 and ngc 4349, orbiting the 2.4m_sun-star ngc2423 no3 (tyc 5409-2156-1) and the 3.9 m_sun-star ngc4349 no127(tyc 8975-2606-1). these low-mass companions have orbital periods of 714 and678 days and minimum masses of 10.6 and 19.8 m_jup, respectively. combined withthe other known planetary systems, these detections indicate that the frequencyof massive planets is higher around intermediate-mass stars, and thereforeprobably scales with the mass of the protoplanetary disk.

0902.4457	photometric and spectroscopic detection of the primary transit of the  111-day-period planet hd 80606 b	we report the detection of the primary transit of the extra-solar planet hd80606 b, thanks to photometric and spectroscopic observations performed atobservatoire de haute-provence, simultaneously with the ccd camera at the120-cm telescope and the sophie spectrograph at the 193-cm telescope. weobserved the whole egress of the transit and partially its central part, inboth data sets with the same timings. the ingress occurred before sunset andwas not observed. the full duration of the transit was between 9.5 and 17.2hours. the data allows the planetary radius to be measured (rp = 0.9 +- 0.1rjup) and other parameters of the system to be refined. radial velocitymeasurements show the detection of a prograde rossiter-mclaughlin effect, andprovide a hint for a spin-orbit misalignment. if confirmed, this misalignmentwould corroborate the hypothesis that hd 80606 b owes its unusual orbitalconfiguration to kozai migration. hd 80606 b is by far the transiting planet onthe longest period detected today. its unusually small radius reinforces theobserved relationship between the planet radius and the incident flux receivedfrom the star and opens new questions for theory. orbiting a quite bright star(v=9), it opens opportunities to numerous follow-up studies.

0908.4521	extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs around a-f type stars - vii. theta  cygni radial velocity variations: planets or stellar phenomenon?	(abridged) in the frame of the search for extrasolar planets and brown dwarfsaround early-type main-sequence stars, we present the results obtained on theearly f-type star theta cygni. elodie and sophie at ohp were used to obtain thespectra. our dedicated radial-velocity measurement method was used to monitorthe star's radial velocities over five years. we also use complementary, highangular resolution and high-contrast images taken with pueo at cfht. we showthat theta cygni radial velocities are quasi-periodically variable, with a~150-day period. these variations are not due to the ~0.35-msun stellarcompanion that we detected in imaging at more than 46 au from the star. theabsence of correlation between the bisector velocity span variations and theradial velocity variations for this 7 km/s vsini star, as well as othercriteria indicate that the observed radial velocity variations are not due tostellar spots. the observed amplitude of the bisector velocity span variationsalso seems to rule out stellar pulsations. however, we observe a peak in thebisector velocity span periodogram at the same period as the one found in theradial velocity periodogram, which indicates a probable link between theseradial velocity variations and the low amplitude lineshape variations which areof stellar origin. long-period variations are not expected from this type ofstar to our knowledge. if a stellar origin (hence of new type) was to beconfirmed for these long-period radial velocity variations, this would haveseveral consequences on the search for planets around main-sequence stars, bothin terms of observational strategy and data analysis. an alternativeexplanation for these variable radial velocities is the presence of at leastone planet of a few jupiter masses orbiting at less than 1 au.

0912.2643	radial velocities with crires: pushing precision down to 5-10 m/s	with the advent of high-resolution infrared spectrographs, radial velocity(rv) searches enter into a new domain. as of today, the most importanttechnical question to address is which wavelength reference is the mostsuitable for high-precision rv measurements.  in this work we explore the usage of atmospheric absorption features. we makeuse of crires data on two programs and three different targets. we re-analyzethe data of the tw hya campaign, reaching a dispersion of about 6 m/s on the rvstandard in a time scale of roughly 1 week. we confirm the presence of alow-amplitude rv signal on tw hya itself, roughly 3 times smaller than the onereported at visible wavelengths. we present rv measurements of gl 86 as well,showing that our approach is capable of detecting the signal induced by aplanet and correctly quantifying it.  our data show that crires is capable of reaching a rv precision of less than10 m/s in a time-scale of one week. the limitations of this particular approachare discussed, and the limiting factors on rv precision in the ir in a generalway. the implications of this work on the design of future dedicated irspectrographs are addressed as well.

0912.2901	do stellar magnetic cycles influence the measurement of precise radial  velocities?	the ever increasing level of precision achieved by present and futureradial-velocity instruments is opening the way to discovering very low-mass,long-period planets (e.g. solar-system analogs). these systems will bedetectable as low-amplitude signals in radial-velocity (rv). however, animportant obstacle to their detection may be the existence of stellar magneticcycles on similar timescales. here we present the results of a long-termprogram to simultaneously measure radial-velocities and stellar-activityindicators (caii, h_alpha, hei) for a sample of stars with known activitycycles. our results suggest that all these stellar activity indexes can be usedto trace the stellar magnetic cycle in solar-type stars. likewise, we findclear indications that different parameters of the harps cross-correlationfunction (bis, fwhm, and contrast) are also sensitive to activity levelvariations. finally, we show that, although in a few cases slight correlationsor anti-correlations between radial-velocity and the activity level of the starexist, their origin is still not clear. we can, however, conclude that for ourtargets (early-k dwarfs) we do not find evidence of any radial-velocityvariations induced by variations of the stellar magnetic cycle with amplitudessignificantly above ~1 m/s.

1001.0794	consequences of spectrograph illumination for the accuracy of  radial-velocimetry	for fiber-fed spectrographs with a stable external wavelength source,scrambling properties of optical fibers and, homogeneity and stability of theinstrument illumination are important for the accuracy of radial-velocimetry.optical cylindric fibers are known to have good azimuthal scrambling. incontrast, the radial one is not perfect. in order to improve the scramblingability of the fiber and to stabilize the illumination, optical doublescrambler are usually coupled to the fibers. despite that, our experience onsophie and harps has lead to identified remaining radial-velocity limitationsdue to the non-uniform illumination of the spectrograph. we conducted tests onsophie with telescope vignetting, seeing variation and centering errors on thefiber entrance. we simulated the light path through the instrument in order toexplain the radial velocity variation obtained with our tests. we thenidentified the illumination stability and uniformity has a critical point forthe extremely high-precision radial velocity instruments (espresso@vlt,codex@e-elt). tests on square and octagonal section fibers are now underdevelopment and sophie will be used as a bench test to validate these new feedoptics.

1001.4774	the harps search for southern extra-solar planets xix. characterization  and dynamics of the gj876 planetary system	precise radial-velocity measurements for data acquired with the harpsspectrograph infer that three planets orbit the m4 dwarf star gj876. inparticular, we confirm the existence of planet "d", which orbits every 1.93785days. we find that its orbit may have significant eccentricity (e=0.14), anddeduce a more accurate estimate of its minimum mass of 6.3 earth masses.dynamical modeling of the harps measurements combined with literaturevelocities from the keck observatory strongly constrain the orbitalinclinations of the "b" and "c" planets. we find that i_b = 48.9 degrees andi_c = 48.1 degrees, which infers the true planet masses of m_b = 2.64 jupitermasses and m_c = 0.83 jupiter masses, respectively. radial velocities alone, inthis favorable case, can therefore fully determine the orbital architecture ofa multi-planet system, without the input from astrometry or transits.  the orbits of the two giant planets are nearly coplanar, and their 2:1 meanmotion resonance ensures stability over at least 5 gyr. the libration amplitudeis smaller than 2 degrees, suggesting that it was damped by some dissipativeprocess during planet formation. the system has space for a stable fourthplanet in a 4:1 mean motion resonance with planet "b", with a period around 15days. the radial velocity measurements constrain the mass of this possibleadditional planet to be at most that of the earth.

1003.0541	evaluating the stability of atmospheric lines with harps	context: in the search for extrasolar systems by radial velocity technique, aprecise wavelength calibration is necessary for high-precision measurements.the choice of the calibrator is a particularly important question in theinfra-red domain, where the precision and exploits still fall behind theachievements of the optical.  aims: we investigate the long-term stability of atmospheric lines as aprecise wavelength reference and analyze their sensitivity to differentatmospheric and observing conditions.  methods: we use harps archive data on three bright stars, tau ceti, mu araeand epsilon eri, spanning 6 years and containing high-cadence measurements overseveral nights. we cross-correlate this data with an o2 mask and evaluate bothradial velocity and bisector variations down to a photon noise of 1 m/s.  results: we find that the telluric lines in the three data-sets are stabledown to 10 m/s (r.m.s.) over the 6 years. we also show that the radial velocityvariations can be accounted for by simple atmospheric models, yielding a finalprecision of 1-2 m/s.  conclusions: the long-term stability of atmospheric lines was measured asbeing of 10 m/s over six years, in spite of atmospheric phenomena. atmosphericlines can be used as a wavelength reference for short-time-scales programs,yielding a precision of 5 m/s "out-of-the box". a higher precision, down to 2m/s can be reached if the atmospheric phenomena are corrected for by the simpleatmospheric model described, making it a very competitive method even on longtime-scales.

1003.3678	evidence against the young hot-jupiter around bd +20 1790	context. the young active star bd +20 1790 is believed to host a substellarcompanion, revealed by radial-velocity measurements that detected the reflexmotion induced on the parent star.  aims. a complete characterisation of the radial-velocity signal is necessaryin order to assess its nature.  methods. we used coralie spectrograph to obtain precise (~10 m/s) velocitymeasurements on this active star, while characterizing the bisector spanvariations. particular attention was given to correctly sample both theproposed planetary orbital period, of 7.8 days, and the stellar rotationperiod, of 2.4 days.  results. a smaller radial-velocity signal (with peak-to-peak variations &lt;500m/s) than had been reported previously was detected, with different amplitudeon two different campaigns. a periodicity similar to the rotational period isfound on the data, as well as a clear correlation between radial-velocities andbisector span. this evidence points towards a stellar origin of theradial-velocity variations of the star instead of a barycentric movement of thestar, and repudiates the reported detection of a hot-jupiter.

1004.0790	observation of the full 12-hour-long transit of the exoplanet hd80606b.  warm-spitzer photometry and sophie spectroscopy	we present new observations of a transit of the 111-day-period exoplanethd80606b. using the spitzer space telescope and its irac camera on thepost-cryogenic mission, we performed a 19-hour-long photometric observation ofhd80606 that covers the full transit of 13-14 january 2010. we complement thisphotometric data by new spectroscopic observations that we simultaneouslyperformed with sophie at haute-provence observatory. this provides radialvelocity measurements of the first half of the transit that was previouslyuncovered with spectroscopy. this new data set allows the parameters of thissingular planetary system to be significantly refined. we obtained aplanet-to-star radius ratio r_p/r_* = 0.1001 +/- 0.0006 that is slightly lowerthan the one measured from previous ground observations. we detected a featurein the spitzer light curve that could be due to a stellar spot. we also found atransit timing about 20 minutes earlier than the ephemeris prediction; thiscould be caused by actual ttvs due to an additional body in the system or byunderestimated systematic uncertainties. the sky-projected angle between thespin-axis of hd80606 and the normal to the planetary orbital plane is found tobe lambda = 42 +/- 8 degrees thanks to the fit of the rossiter-mclaughlinanomaly. this allows scenarios with aligned spin-orbit to be definitivelyrejected. over the twenty planetary systems with measured spin-orbit angles, afew of them are misaligned; this is probably the signature of two differentevolution scenarios for misaligned and aligned systems, depending if theyexperienced or not gravitational interaction with a third body. as in the caseof hd80606b, most of the planetary systems including a massive planet aretilted; this could be the signature of a separate evolution scenario formassive planets in comparison with jupiter-mass planets.

1101.0954	planetary detection limits taking into account stellar noise. ii. effect  of stellar spot groups on radial-velocities	the detection of small mass planets with the radial-velocity technique is nowconfronted with the interference of stellar noise. harps can now reach aprecision below the meter-per-second, which corresponds to the amplitudes ofdifferent stellar perturbations, such as oscillation, granulation, andactivity. solar spot groups induced by activity produce a radial-velocity noiseof a few meter-per-second. the aim of this paper is to simulate this activityand calculate detection limits according to different observational strategies.based on sun observations, we reproduce the evolution of spot groups on thesurface of a rotating star. we then calculate the radial-velocity effectinduced by these spot groups as a function of time. taking into accountoscillation, granulation, activity, and a harps instrumental error of 80 cm/s,we simulate the effect of different observational strategies in order toefficiently reduce all sources of noise. applying three measurements per nightof 10 minutes every three days, 10 nights a month seems the best testedstrategy. depending on the level of activity considered, from log(r'_hk)= -5 to-4.75, this strategy would allow us to find planets of 2.5 to 3.5 earth massesin the habitable zone of a k1v dwarf. using bern's model of planetaryformation, we estimate that for the same range of activity level, 15 to 35 % ofthe planets between 1 and 5 earth masses and with a period between 100 and 200days should be found with harps. a comparison between the performance of harpsand espresso is also emphasized by our simulations. using the same optimizedstrategy, espresso could find 1.3 earth mass planets in the habitable zone ofearly-k dwarfs. in addition, 80 % of planets with mass between 1 and 5 earthmasses and with a period between 100 and 200 days could be detected.

1108.3447	the harps search for earth-like planets in the habitable zone: i -- very  low-mass planets around hd20794, hd85512 and hd192310	in 2009 we started an intense radial-velocity monitoring of a few nearby,slowly-rotating and quiet solar-type stars within the dedicated harps-upgradegto program. the goal of this campaign is to gather very-preciseradial-velocity data with high cadence and continuity to detect tiny signaturesof very-low-mass stars that are potentially present in the habitable zone oftheir parent stars. ten stars were selected among the most stable stars of theoriginal harps high-precision program that are uniformly spread in hour angle,such that three to four of them are observable at any time of the year. foreach star we recorded 50 data points spread over the observing season. the datapoints consist of three nightly observations with a total integration time of10 minutes each and are separated by two hours. this is an observationalstrategy adopted to minimize stellar pulsation and granulation noise. wepresent the first results of this ambitious program. the radial-velocity dataand the orbital parameters of five new and one confirmed low-mass planetsaround the stars hd20794, hd85512, and hd192310 are reported and discussed,among which is a system of three super-earths and one that harbors a 3.6earth-mass planet at the inner edge of the habitable zone. this result alreadyconfirms previous indications that low-mass planets seem to be very frequentaround solar-type stars and that this may occur with a frequency higher than30%

1109.2497	the harps search for southern extra-solar planets xxxiv. occurrence,  mass distribution and orbital properties of super-earths and neptune-mass  planets	we report on the results of an 8-year survey carried out at the la sillaobservatory with the harps spectrograph to detect and characterize planets inthe super-earth and neptune mass regime. the size of our star sample and theprecision achieved with harps have allowed the detection of a sufficientlylarge number of low-mass planets to study the statistical properties of theirorbital elements, the correlation of the host-star metallicity with the planetmasses, as well as the occurrence rate of planetary systems around solar-typestars. a robust estimate of the frequency of systems shows that more than 50%of solar-type stars harbor at least one planet of any mass and with period upto 100 days. different properties are observed for the population of planetsless massive than about 30m-earth compared to the population of gaseous giantplanets. the mass distribution of super-earths and neptune-mass planets (sen)is strongly increasing between 30 and 15m-earth. the sen occurence rate doesnot exhibit a preference for metal rich stars. most of the sen planets belongto multi-planetary systems. the orbital eccentricities of the sen planets seemslimited to 0.45. at the opposite, the occurence rate of gaseous giant planetsis growing with the logarithm of the period, and is strongly increasing withthe host-star metallicity. about 14% of solar-type stars have a planetarycompanion more massive than 50m-earth? on an orbit with a period shorter than10 years. orbital eccentricities of giant planets are observed up to 0.9 andbeyond. the precision of harps-type spectrographs opens the possibility todetect planets in the habitable zone of solar-type stars. identification of asignificant number of super-earths orbiting solar-type of the sun vicinity isachieved by doppler spectroscopy. 37 newly discovered planets are announced inthe appendix of this paper, among which 15 super-earths.

1110.3820	comparing radial velocities of atmospheric lines with radiosonde  measurements	the precision of radial velocity (rv) measurements depends on the precisionattained on the wavelength calibration. one of the available options is usingatmospheric lines as a natural, freely available wavelength reference. figueiraet al. (2010) measured the rv of o2 lines using harps and showed that thescatter was only of ~10 m/s over a timescale of 6 yr. using a simple butphysically motivated empirical model, they demonstrated a precision of 2 m/s,roughly twice the average photon noise contribution. in this paper we takeadvantage of a unique opportunity to confirm the sensitivity of the telluricabsorption lines rv to different atmospheric and observing conditions: by meansof contemporaneous in-situ wind measurements by radiosondes.  the rv model fitting yielded similar results to that of figueira et al.(2010), with lower wind magnitude values and varied wind direction. the probesconfirmed the average low wind magnitude and suggested that the average winddirection is a function of time as well. the two approaches deliver the sameresults in what concerns wind magnitude and agree on wind direction whenfitting is done in segments of a couple of hours. statistical tests show thatthe model provides a good description of the data on all timescales, beingalways preferable to not fitting any atmospheric variation. the smaller thetimescale on which the fitting can be performed (down to a couple of hours),the better the description of the real physical parameters. we conclude thenthat the two methods deliver compatible results, down to better than 5 m/s andless than twice the estimated photon noise contribution on o2 lines rvmeasurement. however, we cannot rule out that parameters alpha and gamma(dependence on airmass and zero-point, respectively) have a dependence on timeor exhibit some cross-talk with other parameters (abridged).

1202.2467	the harps search for southern extra-solar planets xxxv. super-earths  around the m-dwarf neighbors gl433 and gl667c	m dwarfs have been found to often have super-earth planets with short orbitalperiods. such stars are thus preferential targets in searches for rocky orocean planets in the solar neighbourhood. in a recent paper (bonfils et al.2011), we announced the discovery of respectively 1 and 2 low mass planetsaround the m1.5v stars gl433 and gl667c. we found those planets with the harpsspectrograph on the eso~3.6-m telescope at la silla observatory, fromobservations obtained during the guaranteed time observing program of thatinstrument. we have obtained additional harps observations of those two stars,for a total of respectively 67 and 179 radial velocity measurements for gl433and gl667c, and present here an orbital analysis of those extended data setsand our main conclusion about both planetary systems. one of the three planets,gl667cc, has a mass of only m2.sin(i)~4.25 m_earth and orbits in the centralhabitable zone of its host star. it receives just 10% less stellar energy fromgl667c than the earth receives from the sun. however planet evolution inhabitable zone can be very different if the host star is a m dwarf or asolar-like star, without necessarily questioning the presence of water. the twoother planets, gl433b and gl667cb, both have m2.sin(i) of ~5.5 m_earth andperiods of ~7 days. the radial velocity measurements of both stars containlonger time scale signals, which we fit as longer period keplerians. for gl433that signal probably originates in a magnetic cycle, while a longer time spanwill be needed to conclude for gl667c. the metallicity of gl433 is close tosolar, while gl667c is metal poor with [fe/h] ~ -0.6. this reinforces therecent conclusion that the occurence of super-earth planets does not stronglycorrelate with stellar metallicity.

1206.5820	search for giant planets in m67 i. overview	precise stellar radial velocities are used to search for massive (jupitermasses or higher) exoplanets around the stars of the open cluster m67. we aimto obtain a census of massive exoplanets in a cluster of solar metallicity andage in order to study the dependence of planet formation on stellar mass and tocompare in detail the chemical composition of stars with and without planets.this first work presents the sample and the observations, discusses the clustercharacteristics and the radial velocity (rv) distribution of the stars, andindividuates the most likely planetary host candidates. we observed a total of88 main-sequence stars, subgiants, and giants all highly probable members ofm67, using four telescopes and instrument combinations. we investigate whetherexoplanets are present by obtaining radial velocities with precisions as goodas 10 m/s. to date, we have performed 680 single observations (dec. 2011) and apreliminary analysis of data, spanning a period of up to eight years. althoughthe sample was pre-selected to avoid the inclusion of binaries, we identify 11previously unknown binary candidates. eleven stars clearly displayed larger rvvariability and these are candidates to host long-term substellar companions.the average rv is also independent of the stellar magnitude and evolutionarystatus, confirming that the difference in gravitational redshift between giantsand dwarfs is almost cancelled by the atmospheric motions. we use the subsampleof solar-type stars to derive a precise true rv for this cluster. we finallycreate a catalog of binaries and use it to clean the color magnitude diagram(cmd). as conclusion, by pushing the search for planets to the faintestpossible magnitudes, it is possible to observe solar analogues in openclusters, and we propose 11 candidates to host substellar companions.

1211.6444	the coralie survey for southern extrasolar planets xvii. new and updated  long period and massive planets	since 1998, a planet-search program around main sequence stars within 50 pcin the southern hemisphere, is carried out with the coralie echellespectrograph at la silla observatory. with an observing time span of more than14 years, the coralie survey is now able to unveil jovian planets on jupiter'speriod domain. this growing period-interval coverage is important regarding toformation and migration models since observational constraints are still weakfor periods beyond the ice line. long-term precise doppler measurements withthe coralie echelle spectrograph, together with a few additional observationsmade with the harps spectrograph on the eso 3.6m telescope, reveal radialvelocity signatures of massive planetary companions in long period orbits. inthis paper we present seven new planets orbiting hd27631, hd98649, hd106515a,hd166724, hd196067, hd219077, and hd220689 together with the coralie orbitalparameters for three already known planets around hd10647, hd30562, andhd86226. the period range of the new planetary companions goes from 2200 to5500 days and covers a mass domain between 1 and 10.5 mjup. surprisingly, fiveof them present quite high eccentricities above e&gt;0.57. a pumping scenario bykozai mechanism may be invoked for hd106515ab and hd196067b which are bothorbiting stars in multiple systems. as the presence of a third massive bodycan't be inferred from the data of hd98649b, hd166724b, and hd219077b, theorigin of the eccentricity of these systems remains unknown. except forhd10647b, no constraint on the upper mass of the planets is provided byhipparcos astrometric data. finally it is interesting to note that the hosts ofthese long period planets show no metallicity excess.

1212.2848	impact of stellar companions on precise radial velocities	context: with the announced arrival of instruments such as espresso one canexpect that several systematic noise sources on the measurement of preciseradial velocity will become the limiting factor instead of photon noise. astellar companion within the fiber is such a possible noise source. aims: withthis work we aim at characterizing the impact of a stellar companion within thefiber to radial velocity measurements made by fiber-fed spectrographs. weconsider the contaminant star either to be part of a binary system whoseprimary star is the target star, or as a background/foreground star. methods:to carry out our study, we used harps spectra, co-added the target withcontaminant spectra, and then compared the resulting radial velocity with thatobtained from the original target spectrum. we repeated this procedure and useddifferent tunable knobs to reproduce the previously mentioned scenarios.results: we find that the impact on the radial velocity calculation is afunction of the difference between individual radial velocities, of thedifference between target and contaminant magnitude, and also of their spectraltypes. for the worst-case scenario in which both target and contaminant starare well centered on the fiber, the maximum contamination for a g or k star maybe higher than 10 cm/s, on average, if the difference between target andcontaminant magnitude is $\delta m$ &lt; 10, and higher than 1 m/s if $\delta m$ &lt;8. if the target star is of spectral type m, $\delta m$ &lt; 8 produces the samecontamination of 10 cm/s, and a contamination may be higher than 1 m/s

1307.7279	line-profile variations in radial-velocity measurements: two alternative  indicators for planetary searches	aims. we introduce two methods to identify false-positive planetary signalsin the context of radial-velocity exoplanet searches. the first is thebi-gaussian cross-correlation function fitting, and the second is themeasurement of asymmetry in radial-velocity spectral line information content,vasy.  methods. we make a systematic analysis of the most used common line profilediagnosis, bisector inverse slope and velocity span, along with the twoproposed ones. we evaluate all these diagnosis methods following a set ofwell-defined common criteria and using both simulated and real data. we applythem to simulated cross-correlation functions created with the program soap andwhich are affected by the presence of stellar spots, and to realcross-correlation functions, calculated from harps spectra, for stars with asignal originating both in activity and created by a planet.  results. we demonstrate that the bi-gaussian method allows a more precisecharacterization of the deformation of line profiles than the standard bisectorinverse slope. the calculation of the deformation indicator is simpler and itsinterpretation more straightforward. more importantly, its amplitude can be upto 30% larger than that of the bisector span, allowing the detection ofsmaller-amplitude correlations with radial-velocity variations. however, aparticular parametrization of the bisector inverse slope is shown to be moreefficient on high-signal-to-noise data than both the standard bisector and thebi-gaussian. the results of the vasy method show that this indicator is moreeffective than any of the previous ones, being correlated with theradial-velocity with more significance for signals resulting from a linedeformation. moreover, it provides a qualitative advantage over the bisector,showing significant correlations with rv for active stars for which bisectoranalysis is inconclusive.

1311.6642	on the long-term correlation between the flux in the ca ii h &amp; k and  halpha lines for fgk stars	the re-emission in the cores of the ca ii h &amp; k and h$\alpha$ lines, are wellknown proxies of stellar activity. however, these activity indices probedifferent activity phenomena, the first being more sensitive to plagevariation, while the other one being more sensitive to filaments. in this paperwe study the long-term correlation between $\log r'_{hk}$ and $\logi_{h\alpha}$, two indices based on the ca ii h &amp; k and h$\alpha$ linesrespectively, for a sample of 271 fgk stars using measurements obtained over a$\sim$9 year time span. because stellar activity is one of the main obstaclesto the detection of low-mass and long-period planets, understanding furtherthis activity index correlation can give us some hints about the optimal targetto focus on, and ways to correct for these activity effects. we found a greatvariety of long-term correlations between $\log r'_{hk}$ and $\logi_{h\alpha}$. around 20% of our sample has strong positive correlation betweenthe indices while about 3% show strong negative correlation. these fractionsare compatible with those found for the case of early-m dwarfs. starsexhibiting a positive correlation have a tendency to be more active whencompared to the median of the sample, while stars showing a negativecorrelation are more present among higher metallicity stars. there is also atendency for the positively correlated stars to be more present among thecoolest stars, a result which is probably due to the activity level effect onthe correlation. activity level and metallicity seem therefore to be playing arole on the correlation between $\log r'_{hk}$ and $\log i_{h\alpha}$. possibleexplanations based on the influence of filaments for the diversity in thecorrelations between these indices are discussed in this paper.

0802.1532	cosmic dynamics in the era of extremely large telescopes	the redshifts of all cosmologically distant sources are expected toexperience a small, systematic drift as a function of time due to the evolutionof the universe's expansion rate. a measurement of this effect would representa direct and entirely model-independent determination of the expansion historyof the universe over a redshift range that is inaccessible to other methods.here we investigate the impact of the next generation of extremely largetelescopes on the feasibility of detecting and characterising the cosmologicalredshift drift. we consider the lyman alpha forest in the redshift range 2 &lt; z&lt; 5 and other absorption lines in the spectra of high redshift qsos as the mostsuitable targets for a redshift drift experiment. assuming photon-noise limitedobservations and using extensive monte carlo simulations we determine theaccuracy to which the redshift drift can be measured from the ly alpha forestas a function of signal-to-noise and redshift. based on this relation and usingthe brightness and redshift distributions of known qsos we find that a 42-mtelescope is capable of unambiguously detecting the redshift drift over aperiod of ~20 yr using 4000 h of observing time. such an experiment wouldprovide independent evidence for the existence of dark energy without assumingspatial flatness, using any other cosmological constraints or making any otherastrophysical assumption.

1407.0181	impact of micro-telluric lines on precise radial velocities and its  correction	context: in the near future, new instruments such as espresso will arrive,allowing us to reach a precision in radial-velocity measurements on the orderof 10 cm/s. at this level of precision, several noise sources that until nowhave been outweighed by photon noise will start to contribute significantly tothe error budget. the telluric lines that are not neglected by the masks forthe radial velocity computation, here called micro-telluric lines, are one suchnoise source. aims: in this work we investigate the impact of micro-telluriclines in the radial velocities calculations. we also investigate how to correctthe effect of these atmospheric lines on radial velocities. methods: the workpresented here follows two parallel lines. first, we calculated the impact ofthe micro-telluric lines by multiplying a synthetic solar-like stellar spectrumby synthetic atmospheric spectra and evaluated the effect created by thepresence of the telluric lines. then, we divided harps spectra by syntheticatmospheric spectra to correct for its presence on real data and calculated theradial velocity on the corrected spectra. when doing so, one considers twoatmospheric models for the synthetic atmospheric spectra: the lblrtm and tapas.results: we find that the micro-telluric lines can induce an impact on theradial velocities calculation that can already be close to the currentprecision achieved with harps, and so its effect should not be neglected,especially for future instruments such as espresso. moreover, we find that themicro-telluric lines' impact depends on factors, such as the radial velocity ofthe star, airmass, relative humidity, and the barycentric earth radial velocityprojected along the line of sight at the time of the observation.

1407.1044	planets and stellar activity: hide and seek in the corot-7 system	since the discovery of the transiting super-earth corot-7b, severalinvestigations have yielded different results for the number and masses ofplanets present in the system, mainly owing to the star's high level ofactivity. we re-observed corot-7 in january 2012 with both harps and corot, sothat we now have the benefit of simultaneous radial-velocity and photometricdata. this allows us to use the off-transit variations in the star's lightcurve to estimate the radial-velocity variations induced by the suppression ofconvective blueshift and the flux blocked by starspots. to account foractivity-related effects in the radial-velocities which do not have aphotometric signature, we also include an additional activity term in theradial-velocity model, which we treat as a gaussian process with the samecovariance properties (and hence the same frequency structure) as the lightcurve. our model was incorporated into a monte carlo markov chain in order tomake a precise determination of the orbits of corot-7b and corot-7c. we measurethe masses of planets b and c to be 4.73 +/- 0.95 mearth and 13.56 +/- 1.08mearth, respectively. the density of corot-7b is (6.61 +/- 1.72)(rp/1.58rearth)^(-3) g.cm^(-3), which is compatible with a rocky composition. we searchfor evidence of an additional planet d, identified by previous authors with aperiod close to 9 days. we are not able to confirm the existence of a planetwith this orbital period, which is close to the second harmonic of the stellarrotation at around 7.9 days. using bayesian model selection we find that amodel with two planets plus activity-induced variations is most favoured.

(2014) and is composed of a hot super-neptune, kepler-101b, and anearth-sized planet, kepler-101c. these two planets orbit the slightly evolvedand metal-rich g-type star in 3.49 and 6.03 days, respectively. with mass$m_{\rm p}=51.1_{-4.7}^{+5.1}~m_{\oplus}$, radius $r_{\rmp}=5.77_{-0.79}^{+0.85}~r_{\oplus}$, and density $\rho_{\rmp}=1.45_{-0.48}^{+0.83} \rm g\;cm^{-3}$, kepler-101b is the firstfully-characterized super-neptune, and its density suggests that heavy elementsmake up a significant fraction of its interior; more than $60\%$ of its totalmass. kepler-101c has a radius of $1.25_{-0.17}^{+0.19}~r_{\oplus}$, whichimplies the absence of any h/he envelope, but its mass could not be determineddue to the relative faintness of the parent star for highly preciseradial-velocity measurements ($k_{\rm p}=13.8$) and the limited number ofradial velocities. the $1~\sigma$ upper limit, $m_{\rm p} &lt; 3.8~m_{\oplus}$,excludes a pure iron composition with a $68.3\%$ probability. the architectureof the kepler-101 planetary system - containing a close-in giant planet and anouter earth-sized planet with a period ratio slightly larger than the 3:2resonance - is certainly of interest for planet formation and evolutionscenarios. this system does not follow the trend, seen by ciardi et al. (2013),that in the majority of kepler systems of planet pairs with at least oneneptune-size or larger planet, the larger planet has the longer period.

1409.6335	the well-aligned orbit of wasp-84b: evidence for disc migration	we report the sky-projected orbital obliquity (spin-orbit angle) of wasp-84b,a 0.70-$m_{\rm jup}$ planet in a 8.52-day orbit around a g9v/k0v star, to be$\lambda = 0.3 \pm 1.7^\circ$. we obtain a true obliquity of $\psi = 14.8 \pm8.0^\circ$ from a measurement of the inclination of the stellar spin axis withrespect to the sky plane. due to the young age and the weak tidal forcing ofthe system, we suggest that the orbit of wasp-84b is unlikely to have bothrealigned and circularised from the misaligned and/or eccentric orbit likely tohave arisen from high-eccentricity migration. therefore we conclude that theplanet probably migrated via interaction with the protoplanetary disc. thiswould make it the first short-orbit, giant planet to have been shown to havemigrated via this pathway. further, we argue that the distribution ofobliquities for planets orbiting cool stars ($t_{\rm eff}$ &lt; 6250 k) suggeststhat high-eccentricity migration is an important pathway for the formation ofshort-orbit, giant planets.

1503.05581	spectrally resolved detection of sodium in the atmosphere of hd189733b  with the harps spectrograph	atmospheric properties of exoplanets can be constrained with transitspectroscopy. the signature of atomic sodium nai, known to be present above theclouds, is a powerful probe of the upper atmosphere, where it can be bestdetected and characterized at high spectral resolution. our goal is to obtain ahigh-resolution transit spectrum of hd189733b in the region around theresonance doublet of nai at 589 nm, to characterize the absorption signaturepreviously detected from space at low resolution. we analyze archival transitdata of hd189733b obtained with the harps spectrograph. we retrieve the transitspectrum and light curve of the planet, implementing corrections for telluriccontamination and planetary orbital motion. we spectrally resolve the nai ddoublet and measure line contrasts of $0.64\pm0.07\%$ (d2) and $0.40\pm0.07\%$(d1) and fwhms of $0.52\pm0.08~\aa$. this corresponds to a detection at the10-$\sigma$ level of excess of absorption of $0.32\pm0.03\%$ in a passband of$2\times0.75\ \aa$ centered on each line. we derive temperatures of$2\,600\pm600$ k and $3270\pm330$ k at altitudes of $9\,800\pm2\,800$ km and$12\,700\pm2\,600$ km in the nai d1 and d2 line cores, respectively. we measurea temperature gradient of $\sim0.2$ k km$^{-1}$ from comparison withtheoretical models. we also detect a blueshift of $0.16\pm0.04\ \aa$ (4$\sigma$) in the line positions. this blueshift may be due to winds blowing at$8\pm2$ km s$^{-1}$ in the upper layers of the atmosphere. we demonstrate therelevance of studying exoplanet atmospheres with high-resolution spectrographsmounted on 4-meter-class telescopes. our results pave the way towards in-depthcharacterization of physical conditions in the atmospheres of many exoplanetarysystems with future spectrographs such as espresso on the vlt or hires andmetis on the e-elt.

1504.05962	evidence for a spectroscopic direct detection of reflected light from 51  peg b	the detection of reflected light from an exoplanet is a difficult technicalchallenge at optical wavelengths. even though this signal is expected toreplicate the stellar signal, not only is it several orders of magnitudefainter, but it is also hidden among the stellar noise. we apply a variant ofthe cross-correlation technique to harps observations of 51 peg to detect thereflected signal from planet 51 peg b. our method makes use of thecross-correlation function of a binary mask with high-resolution spectra toamplify the minute planetary signal that is present in the spectra by a factorproportional to the number of spectral lines when performing the crosscorrelation. the resulting cross-correlation functions are then normalized by astellar template to remove the stellar signal. carefully selected sections ofthe resulting normalized ccfs are stacked to increase the planetary signalfurther. the recovered signal allows probing several of the planetaryproperties, including its real mass and albedo. we detect evidence for thereflected signal from planet 51 peg b at a significance of 3\sigma_noise. thedetection of the signal permits us to infer a real mass of 0.46^+0.06_-0.01m_jup (assuming a stellar mass of 1.04\;m_sun) for the planet and an orbitalinclination of 80^+10_-19 degrees. the analysis of the data also allows us toinfer a tentative value for the (radius-dependent) geometric albedo of theplanet. the results suggest that 51peg b may be an inflated hot jupiter with ahigh albedo (e.g., an albedo of 0.5 yields a radius of 1.9 \pm 0.3 r_jup for asignal amplitude of 6.0\pm0.4 x 10^-5). we confirm that the method we perfectedcan be used to retrieve an exoplanet's reflected signal, even with currentobserving facilities. the advent of next generation of observing facilitieswill yield new opportunities for this type of technique to probe deeper intoexoplanets.

0809.0750	the harps search for southern extra-solar planets: xiv. gl 176b, a  super-earth rather than a neptune, and at a different period	a 10.24 days neptune-mass planet was recently announced to orbit the nearbym2 dwarf gl 176, based on 28 radial velocities measured with the hrsspectrograph on the hobby-heberly telescope (het). we obtained 57 radialvelocities of gl 176 with the eso 3.6m telescope and the harps spectrograph,which is known for its sub-m/s stability. the median photon-noise standarderror of our measurements is 1.1 m/s, significantly lower than the 4.7 m/s ofthe het velocities, and the 4 years period over which they were obtained hasmuch overlap with the epochs of the het measurements. the harps measurementsshow no evidence for a signal at the period of the putative het planet,suggesting that its detection was spurious. we do find, on the other hand,strong evidence for a lower mass 8.4 mearth planet, in a quasi-circular orbitand at the different period of 8.78 days. the host star has moderate magneticactivity and rotates on a 39-days period, which we confirm through modulationof both contemporaneous photometry and chromospheric indices. we detect thatperiod as well in the radial velocities, but it is well removed from theorbital period and no cause for confusion. this new detection of a super-earth(2 mearth &lt; m sin(i) &lt; 10 mearth) around an m dwarf adds to the growingevidence that such planets are common around very low mass stars: a third ofthe 20 known planets with m sin(i) &lt; 0.1 mjup and 3 of the 7 known planets withm sin(i) &lt; 10 mearth orbit an m dwarf, in contrast to just 4 of the ~300 knownjupiter-mass planets.

astro-ph;0510354	the harps search for southern extra-solar planets v. a 14 earth-masses  planet orbiting hd 4308	we present here the discovery and characterisation of a very light planetaround hd4308. the planet orbits its star in 15.56 days. the circularradial-velocity variation presents a tiny semi-amplitude of 4.1 m/s thatcorresponds to a planetary minimum mass m2sin(i)=14.1 earth masses. the planetwas unveiled by high-precision radial-velocity measurements obtained with theharps spectrograph on the eso 3.6-m telescope. the radial-velocity residualsaround the keplerian solution are 1.3 m/s, demonstrating the very high qualityof the harps measurements. activity and bisector indicators exclude anysignificant perturbations of stellar intrinsic origin, which supports theplanetary interpretation. contrary to most planet-host stars, hd4308 has amarked sub-solar metallicity ([fe/h]=-0.31), raising the possibility that verylight planet occurrence might show a different coupling with the parent star'smetallicity than do giant gaseous extra-solar planets. together withneptune-mass planets close to their parent stars, the new planet occupies aposition in the mass-separation parameter space that is constraining forplanet-formation and evolution theories. the question of whether they can beconsidered as residuals of evaporated gaseous giant planets, ice giants, orsuper-earth planets is discussed in the context of the latest core-accretionmodels.

astro-ph;0608396	the harps search for southern extra-solar planets. ix. mu ara, a system  with four planets	the mu ara planetary system is rather complex: it contains two already knownplanets, mu ara b with p=640 days and mu ara c with p=9.64 days, and a thirdcompanion on a wide but still poorly defined orbit. even with three planets inthe system, the data points keep anomalously high dispersion around the fittedsolution. the high residuals are only partially due to the strong p-modeoscillations of the host star. we have therefore studied in this paper thepossible presence of a fourth planet in the system. during the past years wehave carried out additional and extremely precise radial-velocity measurementswith the harps spectrograph. we provide in this paper a full orbital solutionof the planetary system around mu ara. it turns out to be the second systemknown to harbor 4 planetary companions. thanks to the new data points acquiredwith harps we can confirm the presence of mu ara c at p=9.64 days, whichproduces a coherent rv signal over more than two years. the new orbital fitsets the mass of mu ara c to 10.5 m_earth. furthermore, we present thediscovery of mu ara d, a new planet on an almost circular 310 days-period andwith a mass of 0.52 m_jup. finally, we give completely new orbital parametersfor the longest-period planet, mu ara e. it is the first time that thiscompanion is constrained by radial-velocity data into a dynamical stable orbit,which leaves no doubt about its planetary nature.

astro-ph;0702459	a new neptune-mass planet orbiting hd 219828	two years ago a new benchmark for the planetary survey was set with thediscoveries of three extrasolar planets with masses below 20$m_\oplus$. inparticular, the serendipitous discovery of the 14$m_\oplus$ planet around $\mu$ara found with harps with a semi-amplitude of only 4 m s$^{-1}$ put in evidencethe tremendous potential of harps for the search of this class of very low-massplanets. aiming to discovering new worlds similar to $\mu$ ara b, we carriedout an intensive campaign with harps to observe a selected sample of northernstars covering a range of metallicity from about solar to twice solar. twostars in our program were found to present radial velocity variationscompatible with the presence of a planet-mass companion. the first of these, hd219218, was found to be orbited by a planet with a minimum mass of 19.8$m_\oplus$ and an orbital period of 3.83 days. it is the 11th neptune-massplanet found so far orbiting a solar-type star. the radial velocity dataclearly show the presence of an additional body to the system, likely ofplanetary mass. the second planet orbits hd 102195, has a mass of 0.45$m_{jup}$and an orbital period of 4.11 days. this planet has been already announced byge et al. (2006). our data confirm and improve the orbital solution found bythese authors. we also show that the high residuals of the orbital solution arecaused by stellar activity, and use the bisectors of the harpscross-correlation function to correct the noise introduced by stellar activity.an improved orbital solution is obtained after this correction. this kind ofanalysis may be used in the future to correct the radial-velocities for stellaractivity induced noise.

astro-ph;0703412	a new list of thorium and argon spectral lines in the visible	aims. we present a new list of thorium and argon emission lines in thevisible obtained by analyzing high-resolution (r=110,000) spectra of a tharhollow cathode lamp. the aim of this new line list is to allow significantimprovements in the quality of wavelength calibration for medium- tohigh-resolution astronomical spectrographs. methods. we use a series of tharlamp exposures obtained with the harps instrument (high accuracyradial-velocity planet searcher) to detect previously unknown lines, perform asystematic search for blended lines and correct individual wavelengths bydetermining the systematic offset of each line relative to the averagewavelength solution. results. we give updated wavelengths for more than 8400lines over the spectral range 3785-6915 a. the typical internal uncertainty onthe line positions is estimated to be ~10 m/s (3.3 parts in 10^8 or 0.18 ma),which is a factor of 2-10 better than the widely used los alamos atlas of thethorium spectrum (palmer &amp; engleman 1983). the absolute accuracy of the globalwavelength scale is the same as in the los alamos atlas. using this new linelist on harps thar spectra, we are able to obtain a global wavelengthcalibration which is precise at the 20 cm/s level (6.7 parts in 10^10 or 0.0037ma). conclusions. several research fields in astronomy requiring high-precisionwavelength calibration in the visible (e.g. radial velocity planet searches,variability of fundamental constants) should benefit from using the new linelist.

astro-ph;0703623	selection of thar lines for wavelength calibration of echelle spectra  and implications for variations in the fine-structure constant	echelle spectrographs currently provide some of the most precise and detailedspectra in astronomy, the interpretation of which sometimes depends on thewavelength calibration accuracy. in some applications, such as constrainingcosmological variations in the fundamental constants from quasar absorptionlines, the wavelength calibration is crucial. here we detail an algorithm forselecting thorium-argon (thar) emission lines for wavelength calibration whichincorporates the properties of both a new laboratory wavelength list and thespectrograph of interest. we apply the algorithm to the very large telescopeultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph (uves) and demonstrate a factor of&gt;3 improvement in the wavelength calibration residuals (i.e. random errors)alone. it is also found that uves spectra calibrated using a previous, widelydistributed line-list contain systematic +/-30-75 m/s distortions of thewavelength scale over both short and long wavelength ranges. these distortionshave important implications for current uves constraints on cosmologicalvariations in the fine-structure constant. the induced systematic errors aremost severe for mg/feii quasar absorbers in the redshift range 1.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.3,with individual absorbers studied by recent authors containing systematicerrors up to 4 times larger than quoted statistical errors.

0811.3923	stellar activity of planetary host star hd 189733	extra-solar planet search programs require high-precision velocitymeasurements. they need to study how to disentangle radial-velocity variationsdue to doppler motion from the noise induced by stellar activity. we monitoredthe active k2v star hd 189733 and its transiting planetary companion that has a2.2-day orbital period. we used the high-resolution spectograph sophie mountedon the 1.93-m telescope at the observatoire de haute-provence to obtain 55spectra of hd 189733 over nearly two months. we refined the hd 189733b orbitparameters and put limits on the eccentricity and on a long-term velocitygradient. after subtracting the orbital motion of the planet, we compared thevariability of spectroscopic activity indices to the evolution of theradial-velocity residuals and the shape of spectral lines. the radial velocity,the spectral-line profile and the activity indices measured in hei (5875.62\aa), halpha (6562.81 \aa) and the caii h&amp;k lines (3968.47 \aa and 3933.66 \aa,respectively) show a periodicity around the stellar rotation period and thecorrelations between them are consistent with a spotted stellar surface inrotation. we used such correlations to correct for the radial-velocity jitterdue to stellar activity. this results in achieving high precision on the orbitparameters, with a semi-amplitude k = 200.56 \pm 0.88 m.s-1 and a derivedplanet mass of m_{p}=1.13 \pm 0.03 m$_{jup}$.
