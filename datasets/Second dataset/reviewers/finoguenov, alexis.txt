0902.2781	a statistical analysis of the two dimensional xmm-newton group survey:  the impact of feedback on group properties	(abridged) we present a statistical analysis of 28 nearby galaxy groups fromthe two-dimensional xmm-newton group survey (2dxgs). we focus on entropy andthe role of feedback, dividing the sample into cool core (cc) and non cool core(ncc) systems, the first time the latter have been studied in detail in thegroup regime. the coolest groups have steeper entropy profiles than the warmestsystems, and ncc groups have higher central entropy and exhibit more scatterthan their cc counterparts. we compare the entropy distribution of the gas ineach system to the expected theoretical distribution ignoring non-gravitationalprocesses. in all cases, the observed maximum entropy far exceeds that expectedtheoretically, and simple models for modifications of the theoretical entropydistribution perform poorly. applying initial pre-heating, followed byradiative cooling, generally fails to match the low entropy behaviour, and onlyperforms well when the difference between the maximum entropy of the observedand theoretical distributions is small. successful feedback models need to workdifferentially to increase the entropy range in the gas, and we suggest twobasic possibilities. we analyse the effects of feedback on the entropydistribution, finding systems with a high measure of `feedback impact' to reachhigher entropy than their low feedback counterparts and also to showsignificantly lower central metallicities. if low entropy, metal-rich gas hasbeen boosted to large entropy in the high feedback systems, it must now resideoutside 0.5r_500, to remain undetected. we find similar levels of enrichment inboth high and low feedback systems, and argue that the lack of extra metals inthe highest feedback systems points to an agn origin for the bulk of thefeedback, probably acting within precursor structures.

0902.3658	a suzaku search for non-thermal emission at hard x-ray energies in the  coma cluster	the brightest cluster radio halo known resides in the coma cluster ofgalaxies. the relativistic electrons producing this diffuse synchrotronemission should also produce inverse compton emission that becomes competitivewith thermal emission from the icm at hard x-ray energies. thus far, claimeddetections of this emission in coma are controversial (fusco-femiano et al.2004; rossetti &amp; molendi 2004). we present a suzaku hxd-pin observation of thecoma cluster in order to nail down its non-thermal hard x-ray content. thecontribution of thermal emission to the hxd-pin spectrum is constrained bysimultaneously fitting thermal and non-thermal models to it and a spatiallyequivalent spectrum derived from an xmm-newton mosaic of the coma field(schuecker et al. 2004). we fail to find statistically significant evidence fornon-thermal emission in the spectra, which are better described by only asingle or multi-temperature model for the icm. including systematicuncertainties, we derive a 90% upper limit on the flux of non-thermal emissionof 6.0x10^-12 erg/s/cm^2 (20-80 kev, for photon index of 2.0), which implies alower limit on the cluster-averaged magnetic field of b&gt;0.15 microg. our fluxupper limit is 2.5x lower than the detected non-thermal flux from rxte(rephaeli &amp; gruber 2002) and bepposax (fusco-femiano et al. 2004). however, ifthe non-thermal hard x-ray emission in coma is more spatially extended than theobserved radio halo, the suzaku hxd-pin may miss some fraction of the emission.a detailed investigation indicates that ~50-67% of the emission might goundetected, which could make our limit consistent with these detections. thethermal interpretation of the hard coma spectrum is consistent with recentanalyses of integral (eckert et al. 2007) and swift (ajello et al. 2009) data.

0904.3655	x-ray substructure studies of four galaxy clusters using xmm-newton data	mahdavi et al. find that the degree of agreement between weak lensing andx-ray mass measurements is a function of cluster radius. numerical simulationsalso point out that x-ray mass proxies do not work equally well at all radii.the origin of the effect is thought to be associated with cluster mergers.recent work presenting the cluster maps showed an ability of x-ray maps toreveal and study cluster mergers in detail. here we present a first attempt touse the study of substructure in assessing the systematics of the hydrostaticmass measurements using two-dimensional (2-d) x-ray diagnostics. thetemperature map is uniquely able to identify the substructure in an almostrelaxed cluster which would be unnoticed in the icm electron number density andpressure maps. we describe the radial fluctuations in the 2-d maps by acumulative/differential scatter profile relative to the mean profile within/ata given radius. the amplitude indicates ~10 fluctuations in the temperature,electron number density and entropy maps, and ~15 fluctuations in the pressuremap. the amplitude of and the discontinuity in the scatter complement 2-dsubstructure diagnostics, e.g. indicating the most disturbed radial range.there is a tantalizing link between the substructure identified using thescatter of the entropy and pressure fluctuations and the hydrostatic mass biasrelative to the expected mass based on the m-yx and m-mgas relationsparticularly at r500. xmm-newton observations with ~120,000 source photons fromthe cluster are sufficient to apply our substructure diagnostics via thespectrally measured 2-d temperature, electron number density, entropy andpressure maps.

0911.1060	the x-ray view of abell 3120	identification of abell 3120 as a galaxy cluster has recently been questionedwith alternative suggestions including: a fossil remnant of a group merger,non-thermal emission from a radio galaxy, and projected emission from of afilamentary string of galaxies. we report on our analysis of the chandraobservation and evaluate these hypotheses based on our results. abell 3120shows x-ray emission extending 158 kpc, well beyond the central galaxy. thespatial distribution of x-rays in the core more closely follows the radioemission showing a jet-like structure extending to the north that is misalignedwith the stellar light distribution of the central galaxy. at larger radii thex-ray emission is aligned with the se-nw running axis of the galaxydistribution in the cluster core. modeling the x-ray spectrum excludes purelynon-thermal emission. the emission weighted temperature is 1.93 - 2.19 kev andthe 0.3 - 10 kev luminosity is 1.23$\times10^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. abell 3120appears to be a poor cluster with virgo and mkw 4 as peers. the best fittingmodel consists of a thermal component and a second component that may be eitherthermal or non-thermal, with luminosity 25% of the total x-ray luminosity.while, a more detailed spatial-spectral search failed to detect a central agn,there is some evidence for an extended hard x-ray component. cooler gas, 1.28 -1.80 was detected in the central 20 kpc. the second thermal componentmarginally requires a higher redshift, &gt;0.12, which may be due to a secondcluster in the rich surrounding environment consisting of nearly a thousandcatalogued galaxies.

1001.0780	locuss: a comparison of cluster mass measurements from xmm-newton and  subaru - testing deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium and non-thermal  pressure support	we compare x-ray hydrostatic and weak-lensing mass estimates for a sample of12 clusters that have been observed with both xmm-newton and subaru. at anover-density of \delta=500, we obtain 1-m^{x}/m^{wl}=0.01+/-0.07 for the wholesample. we also divided the sample into undisturbed and disturbed sub-samplesbased on quantitative x-ray morphologies using asymmetry and fluctuationparameters, obtaining 1-m^{x}/m^{wl}=0.09+/-0.06 and -0.06+/-0.12 for theundisturbed and disturbed clusters, respectively. in addition to non-thermalpressure support, there may be a competing effect associated with adiabaticcompression and/or shock heating which leads to overestimate of x-rayhydrostatic masses for disturbed clusters, for example, in the famous mergingcluster a1914. despite the modest statistical significance of the massdiscrepancy, on average, in the undisturbed clusters, we detect a clear trendof improving agreement between m^{x} and m^{wl} as a function of increasingover-density, m^{x}/m^{wl}=(0.908+/-0.004)+(0.187+/-0.010) \log_{10}(\delta/500). we also examine the gas mass fractions, f_{gas}=m^{gas}/m^{wl}, findingthat they are an increasing function of cluster radius, with no dependence ondynamical state, in agreement with predictions from numerical simulations.overall, our results demonstrate that xmm-newton and subaru are a powerfulcombination for calibrating systematic uncertainties in cluster massmeasurements.

1007.3816	locuss: calibrating mass-observable scaling relations for cluster  cosmology with subaru weak lensing observations	we present a joint weak-lensing/x-ray study of galaxy cluster mass-observablescaling relations, motivated by the critical importance of accurate calibrationof mass proxies for future x-ray missions, including erosita. we use a sampleof 12 clusters at z\simeq0.2 that we have observed with subaru and xmm-newtonto construct relationships between the weak-lensing mass (m), and three x-rayobservables: gas temperature (t), gas mass (mgas), and quasi-integrated gaspressure (yx) at overdensities of \delta=2500, 1000, and 500 with respect tothe critical density. we find that mgas at \delta\le1000 appears to be the mostpromising mass proxy of the three, because it has the lowest intrinsic scatterin mass at fixed observable: \sigma_lnm\simeq0.1, independent of clusterdynamical state. the scatter in mass at fixed t and yx is a factor of \sim2-3larger than at fixed mgas, which are indicative of the structural segregationthat we find in the m-t and m-yx relationships. undisturbed clusters are foundto be \sim40% and \sim20% more massive than disturbed clusters at fixed t andyx respectively at \sim2\sigma significance. in particular, a1914 - awell-known merging cluster - significantly increases the scatter and lowers thethe normalization of the relation for disturbed clusters. we also investigatedthe covariance between intrinsic scatter in m-mgas and m-t relations, findingthat they are positively correlated. this contradicts the adaptive meshrefinement simulations that motivated the idea that yx may be a low scattermass proxy, and agrees with more recent smoothed particle hydrodynamicsimulations based on the millennium simulation. we also propose a method toidentify a robust mass proxy based on principal component analysis. thestatistical precision of our results are limited by the small sample size andthe presence of the extreme merging cluster in our sample.

1010.0688	an x-ray selected galaxy cluster in the lockman hole at redshift 1.753	we have discovered an x-ray selected galaxy cluster with a spectroscopicredshift of 1.753. the redshift is of the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg), whichis coincident with the peak of the x-ray surface brightness. we also haveconcordant photometric redshifts for seven additional candidate clustermembers. the x-ray luminosity of the cluster is 3.68 +/- 0.70 x 10^43 erg s^-1in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band. the optical/ir properties of the bcg imply itsformation redshift was ~5 if its stars formed in a short burst. this resultcontinues the trend from lower redshift in which the observed properties ofbcgs are most simply explained by a monolithic collapse at very high redshiftinstead of the theoretically preferred gradual hierarchical assembly at latertimes. however the models corresponding to different formation redshifts aremore clearly separated as our observation epoch approaches the galaxy formationepoch. although our infrared photometry is not deep enough to define a redsequence, we do identify a few galaxies at the cluster redshift that have theexpected red sequence photometric properties.

1011.5509	direct observational evidence for a large transient galaxy population in  groups at 0.85&lt;z&lt;1	(abridged) we introduce our survey of galaxy groups at 0.85&lt;z&lt;1, as anextension of the group environment and evolution collaboration (geec). here wepresent the first results, based on gemini gmos-s nod-and-shuffle spectroscopyof seven galaxy groups selected from spectroscopically confirmed, extended xmmdetections in cosmos. in total we have over 100 confirmed group members, andfour of the groups have &gt;15 members. the dynamical mass estimates are in goodagreement with the masses estimated from the x-ray luminosity, with most of thegroups having 13&lt;log(mdyn/msun)&lt;14. our spectroscopic sample is statisticallycomplete for all galaxies with mstar&gt;1e10.1 msun, and for blue galaxies wesample masses as low as mstar=1e8.8 msun. like lower-redshift groups, thesesystems are dominated by red galaxies, at all stellar masses mstar&gt;1e10.1 msun.few group galaxies inhabit the "blue cloud" that dominates the surroundingfield; instead, we find a large and possibly distinct population of galaxieswith intermediate colours. the "green valley" that exists at low redshift isinstead well-populated in these groups, containing ~30 per cent of galaxies.these do not appear to be exceptionally dusty galaxies, and about half showprominent balmer-absorption lines. furthermore, their hst morphologies appearto be intermediate between those of red-sequence and blue-cloud galaxies of thesame stellar mass. we postulate that these are a transient population,migrating from the blue cloud to the red sequence, with a star formation ratethat declines with an exponential timescale 0.6 gyr&lt; tau &lt; 2 gyr. theirprominence among the group galaxy population, and the marked lack of blue,star-forming galaxies, provides evidence that the group environment eitherdirectly reduces star formation in member galaxies, or at least prevents itsrejuvenation during the normal cycle of galaxy evolution.

1012.0003	the lack of diffuse, nonthermal hard x-ray emission in the coma cluster:  the swift bat's eye view	the coma cluster of galaxies hosts the brightest radio halo known and hastherefore been the target of numerous searches for associated inverse compton(ic) emission, particularly at hard x-ray energies where the ic signal musteventually dominate over thermal emission. the most recent search with thesuzaku hard x-ray detector (hxd) failed to confirm previous ic detections withrxte and bepposax, instead setting an upper limit 2.5 times below theirnonthermal flux. however, this discrepancy can be resolved if the ic emissionis very extended, beyond the scale of the cluster radio halo. usingreconstructed sky images from the 58-month swift bat all sky survey, thefeasibility of such a solution is investigated. building on renaud et al., wetest and implement a method for extracting the fluxes of extended sources,assuming specified spatial distributions. bat spectra are jointly fit with anxmm-newton epic-pn spectrum derived from mosaic observations. we find noevidence for large-scale ic emission at the level expected from the previouslydetected nonthermal fluxes. for all nonthermal spatial distributionsconsidered, which span the gamut of physically reasonable ic models, wedetermine upper limits for which the largest (most conservative) limit is&lt;4.2x10^{-12} erg/s/cm^2 (20-80 kev), which corresponds to a lower limit on themagnetic field b&gt;0.2ug. a nominal flux upper limit of &lt;2.7x10^{-12} erg/s/cm^2,with corresponding b&gt;0.25ug, is derived for the most probable ic distributiongiven the size of the radio halo and likely magnetic field radial profile.

1109.0010	the integrated stellar content of dark matter halos	measurements of the total amount of stars locked up in galaxies as a functionof host halo mass contain key clues about the efficiency of processes thatregulate star formation. we derive the total stellar mass fraction f_star as afunction of halo mass m500c from z=0.2 to z=1 using two complementary methods.first, we derive f_star using a statistical halo occupation distribution modeljointly constrained by data from lensing, clustering, and the stellar massfunction. this method enables us to probe f_star over a much wider halo massrange than with group or cluster catalogs. second, we derive f_star at groupscales using a cosmos x-ray group catalog and we show that the two methodsagree to within 30%. we quantify the systematic uncertainty on f_star usingabundance matching methods and we show that the statistical uncertainty onf_star (~10%) is dwarfed by systematic uncertainties associated with stellarmass measurements (~45% excluding imf uncertainties). assuming a chabrier imf,we find 0.012&lt;f_star&lt;0.025 at m500c=10^13 msun and 0.0057&lt;f_star&lt;0.015 atm500c=10^14 msun. these values are significantly lower than previouslypublished estimates. we investigate the cause of this difference and find thatprevious work has overestimated f_star due to a combination of inaccuratestellar mass estimators and/or because they have assumed that all galaxies ingroups are early type galaxies with a constant mass-to-light ratio. contrary toprevious claims, our results suggest that the mean value of f_star is alwayssignificantly lower than f_gas for halos above 10^13 msun. combining ourresults with recently published gas mas fractions, we find a shortfall inf_star+f_gas at r500c compared to the cosmic mean. this shortfall varies withhalo mass and becomes larger towards lower halos masses.

1109.6040	galaxies in x-ray groups i: robust membership assignment and the impact  of group environments on quenching	understanding the mechanisms that lead dense environments to host galaxieswith redder colors, more spheroidal morphologies, and lower star formationrates than field populations remains an important problem. as most candidateprocesses ultimately depend on host halo mass, accurate characterizations ofthe local environment, ideally tied to halo mass estimates and spanning a rangein halo mass and redshift are needed. in this work, we present and test arigorous, probabalistic method for assigning galaxies to groups based onprecise photometric redshifts and x-ray selected groups drawn from the cosmosfield. the groups have masses in the range 10^13 &lt; m_200c/m_sun &lt; 10^14 andspan redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1. we characterize our selection algorithm via tests onspectroscopic subsamples, including new data obtained at the vlt, and byapplying our method to detailed mock catalogs. we find that our group membergalaxy sample has a purity of 84% and completeness of 92% within 0.5 r200c. wemeasure the impact of uncertainties in redshifts and group centering on thequality of the member selection with simulations based on current data as wellas future imaging and spectroscopic surveys. as a first application of our newgroup member catalog which will be made publicly available, we show that membergalaxies exhibit a higher quenched fraction compared to the field at fixedstellar mass out to z~1, indicating a significant relationship between starformation and environment at group scales. we also address the suggestion thatdusty star forming galaxies in such groups may impact the high-l power spectrumof the cosmic microwave background and find that such a population cannotexplain the low power seen in recent sz measurements.

1111.3370	measuring the geometry of the universe from weak gravitational lensing  behind galaxy groups in the hst cosmos survey	gravitational lensing can provide pure geometric tests of the structure ofspace-time, for instance by determining empirically the angular diameterdistance-redshift relation. this geometric test has been demonstrated severaltimes using massive clusters which produce a large lensing signal. in thiscase, matter at a single redshift dominates the lensing signal, so the analysisis straightforward. it is less clear how weaker signals from multiple sourcesat different redshifts can be stacked to demonstrate the geometric dependence.we introduce a simple measure of relative shear which for flat cosmologiesseparates the effect of lens and source positions into multiplicative terms,allowing signals from many different source-lens pairs to be combined. applyingthis technique to a sample of groups and low-mass clusters in the cosmossurvey, we detect a clear variation of shear with distance behind the lens.this represents the first detection of the geometric effect using weak lensingby multiple, low-mass systems. the variation of distance with redshift ismeasured with sufficient precision to constrain the equation of state of theuniverse under the assumption of flatness, equivalent to a detection of a darkenergy component omega_x at greater than 99% confidence for anequation-of-state parameter -2.5 &lt; w &lt; -0.1. for the case w = -1, we find avalue for the cosmological constant density parameter omega_lambda =0.85+0.044-0.19 (68% c.l.), and detect cosmic acceleration (q_0 &lt; 0) at the 98%c.l.. we consider the systematic uncertainties associated with this techniqueand discuss the prospects for applying it in forthcoming weak-lensing surveys.

1111.3698	magnification by galaxy group dark matter halos	we report on the detection of gravitational lensing magnification by apopulation of galaxy groups, at a significance level of 4.9 sigma. using x-rayselected groups in the cosmos 1.64 deg^2 field, and high-redshift lyman breakgalaxies as sources, we measure a lensing-induced angular cross-correlationbetween the samples. after satisfying consistency checks that demonstrate wehave indeed detected a magnification signal, and are not suffering fromcontamination by physical overlap of samples, we proceed to implement anoptimally weighted cross-correlation function to further boost the signal tonoise of the measurement. interpreting this optimally weighted measurementallows us to study properties of the lensing groups. we model the fulldistribution of group masses using a composite-halo approach, considering boththe singular isothermal sphere and navarro-frenk-white profiles, and find ourbest fit values to be consistent with those recovered using the weak-lensingshear technique. we argue that future weak-lensing studies will need toincorporate magnification along with shear, both to reduce residual systematicsand to make full use of all available source information, in an effort tomaximize scientific yield of the observations.

1201.3920	clustering of x-ray-selected agn	the study of the angular and spatial structure of the x-ray sky has beenunder investigation since the times of the einstein x-ray observatory. thistopic has fascinated more than two generations of scientists and slowlyunveiled an unexpected scenario regarding the consequences of the angular andspatial distribution of x-ray sources. it was first established from theclustering of sources making the cxb that the source spatial distributionresembles that of optical qso. it then it became evident that the distributionof x-ray agn in the universe was strongly reflecting that of dark matter. inparticular one of the key result is that x-ray agn are hosted by dark matterhalos of mass similar to that of galaxy groups. this result, together withmodel predictions, has lead to the hypothesis that galaxy mergers mayconstitute the main agn triggering mechanism. however detailed analysis ofobservational data, acquired with modern telescopes, and the use of the newhalo occupation formalism has revealed that the triggering of an agn could alsobe attributed to phenomena like tidal disruption or disk instability, and togalaxy evolution. this paper reviews results from 1988 to 2011 in the field ofx-ray selected agn clustering.

1204.2552	extended x-ray emission from non-thermal sources in the cosmos field: a  detailed study of a large radio galaxy at z=1.168	x-ray selected galaxy group samples are usually generated by searching forextended x- ray sources that reflect the thermal radiation of the intragroupmedium. on the other hand, large radio galaxies that regularly occupy galaxygroups also emit in the x-ray window, and their contribution to x-ray selectedgroup samples is still not well understood. in order to investigate theirrelative importance, we have carried out a systematic search for non-thermalextended x-ray sources in the cosmos field. based on the morphologicalcoincidence of x-ray and radio extensions, out of 60 radio galaxies, and \sim300 extended x-ray sources, we find only one candidate where the observedextended x-ray emission arises from non- thermal processes related to radiogalaxies. we present a detailed analysis of this source, and its environment.our results yield that external inverse compton emission of the lobes is thedominant process that generates the observed x-ray emission of our extendedx-ray candidate, with a minor contribution from the gas of the galaxy grouphosting the radio galaxy. finally, we show that finding only one potentialcandidate in the cosmos field (in a redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 6 and with radioluminosity between 1025 and 1030 w/hz) is consistent with expected x-ray-countsarising from synchrotron lobes. this implies that these sources are not aprominent source of contamination in samples of x-ray selected clusters/groups,but they could potentially dominate the z &gt; 1 cluster counts at the bright end(s_x &gt; 7 \cdot 10^-15 erg s^-1 cm^2).

1205.4245	the correlated formation histories of massive galaxies and their dark  matter halos	using observations in the cosmos field, we report an intriguing correlationbetween the star formation activity of massive (~10^{11.4}\msol) centralgalaxies, their stellar masses, and the large-scale (~10 mpc) environments oftheir group-mass (~10^{13.6}\msol) dark matter halos. probing the redshiftrange z=[0.2,1.0], our measurements come from two independent sources: an x-raydetected group catalog and constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relationderived from a combination of clustering and weak lensing statistics. at z=1,we find that the stellar mass in star-forming centrals is a factor of two lessthan in passive centrals at the same halo mass. this implies that the presenceor lack of star formation in group-scale centrals cannot be a stochasticprocess. by z=0, the offset reverses, probably as a result of the differentgrowth rates of these objects. a similar but weaker trend is observed whendividing the sample by morphology rather than star formation. remarkably, wefind that star-forming centrals at z~1 live in groups that are significantlymore clustered on 10 mpc scales than similar mass groups hosting passivecentrals. we discuss this signal in the context of halo assembly and recentsimulations, suggesting that star-forming centrals prefer halos with higherangular momentum and/or formation histories with more recent growth; such halosare known to evolve in denser large-scale environments. if confirmed, thiswould be evidence of an early established link between the assembly history ofhalos on large scales and the future properties of the galaxies that forminside them.

1205.4262	galaxies in x-ray groups. ii. a weak lensing study of halo centering	locating the centers of dark matter halos is critical for understanding themass profiles of halos as well as the formation and evolution of the massivegalaxies that they host. the task is observationally challenging because wecannot observe halos directly, and tracers such as bright galaxies or x-rayemission from hot plasma are imperfect. in this paper we quantify theconsequences of miscentering on the weak lensing signal from a sample of 129x-ray selected galaxy groups in the cosmos field with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1 and halomasses in the range 10^13 - 10^14 m_sun. by measuring the stacked lensingsignal around eight different candidate centers (such as the brightest membergalaxy, the mean position of all member galaxies, or the x-ray centroid), wedetermine which candidates best trace the center of mass in halos. in thissample of groups, we find that massive galaxies near the x-ray centroids tracethe center of mass to &lt;~75 kpc, while the x-ray position and centroids based onthe mean position of member galaxies have larger offsets primarily due to thestatistical uncertainties in their positions (typically ~50-150 kpc).approximately 30% of groups in our sample have ambiguous centers with multiplebright or massive galaxies, and these groups show disturbed mass profiles thatare not well fit by standard models, suggesting that they are merging systems.we find that halo mass estimates from stacked weak lensing can be biased low by5-30% if inaccurate centers are used and the issue of miscentering is notaddressed.

1207.0809	a filament of dark matter between two clusters of galaxies	it is a firm prediction of the concordance cold dark matter (cdm)cosmological model that galaxy clusters live at the intersection of large-scalestructure filaments. the thread-like structure of this "cosmic web" has beentraced by galaxy redshift surveys for decades. more recently the warm-hotintergalactic medium (whim) residing in low redshift filaments has beenobserved in emission and absorption. however, a reliable direct detection ofthe underlying dark matter skeleton, which should contain more than half of allmatter, remained elusive, as earlier candidates for such detections were eitherfalsified or suffered from low signal-to-noise ratios and unphysicalmisalignements of dark and luminous matter. here we report the detection of adark matter filament connecting the two main components of the abell 222/223supercluster system from its weak gravitational lensing signal, both in anon-parametric mass reconstruction and in parametric model fits. this filamentis coincident with an overdensity of galaxies and diffuse, soft x-ray emissionand contributes mass comparable to that of an additional galaxy cluster to thetotal mass of the supercluster. combined with x-ray observations, we place anupper limit of 0.09 on the hot gas fraction, the mass of x-ray emitting gasdivided by the total mass, in the filament.

1207.5793	the evolution of the mass-size relation for early type galaxies from z~1  to the present: dependence on environment, mass-range and detailed morphology	[abridged] we study the dependence of the galaxy size evolution onmorphology, stellar mass and large scale environment for a sample of 298 groupand 384 field quiescent early-type galaxies from the cosmos survey, selectedfrom z~1 to the present, and with masses $log(m/m_\odot)&gt;10.5$.  the galaxy size growth depends on galaxy mass and early-type galaxymorphology, e.g., elliptical galaxies evolve differently than lenticulargalaxies. at the low mass end -$10.5&lt;log(m/m_\odot)&lt;11$, ellipticals do notshow strong size growth from $z\sim1$ to the present (10% to 30% depending onthe morphological classification). on the other end, massive ellipticals-log(m/m_\odot)&gt;11.2$- approximately doubled their size. interestingly,lenticular galaxies display different behavior: they appear more compact onaverage and they do show a size growth of \sim60% since z=1 independent ofstellar mass. we compare our results with state-of-the art semi-analyticmodels.  while major and minor mergers can account for most of the galaxy size growth,we find that with present data and the theoretical uncertainties in themodeling we cannot state clear evidence favoring either merger or mass loss viaquasar and/or stellar winds as the primary mechanism driving the evolution.  the galaxy mass--size relation and the size growth do not depend onenvironment in the halo mass range explored in this work (field to group mass$log(m_h/m_\odot)&lt;14$), i.e., group and field galaxies follow the same trends,which is at variance with predictions from current hierarchical models thatshow a clear dependence of size growth on halo mass for massive ellipticals-$log(m_*/m_\odot)&gt;11.2$.

1211.4823	merger shocks in abell 3667 and the cygnus~a cluster	we present new xmm-newton observations of the northwest (nw) radio relicregion in the cluster abell 3667. we detect a jump in the x-ray surfacebrightness and x-ray temperature at the sharp outer edge of the radio relicwhich indicate that this is the location of a merger shock with a mach numberof about 2. comparing the radio emission to the shock properties implies thatapproximately 0.2% of the dissipated shock kinetic energy goes intoaccelerating relativistic electrons. this is an order of magnitude smaller thanthe efficiency of shock acceleration in many galactic supernova remnants, whichmay be due to the lower mach numbers of cluster merger shocks. the x-ray andradio properties indicate that the magnetic field strength in the radio relicis &gt;= 3 mug, which is a very large field at a projected distance of ~2.2 mpcfrom the center of a cluster. the radio spectrum is relatively flat at theshock, and steepens dramatically with distance behind the shock. this isconsistent with radiative losses by the electrons and the post-shock speeddetermined from the x-ray properties. the cygnus a radio source is located in amerging cluster of galaxies. this appears to be an early-stage merger. ourrecent suzaku observation confirm the presence of a hot region between the twosubclusters which agrees with the predicted shocked region. the high spectralresolution of the ccds on suzaku allowed us to measure the radial component ofthe merger velocity, delta v_r \approx 2650 km/s.

1302.6620	galaxies in x-ray groups. iii. satellite color and morphology  transformations	while the star formation rates and morphologies of galaxies have long beenknown to correlate with their local environment, the process by which thesecorrelations are generated is not well understood. galaxy groups are thought toplay an important role in shaping the physical properties of galaxies beforeentering massive clusters at low redshift, and transformations of satellitegalaxies likely dominate the buildup of local environmental correlations. toilluminate the physical processes that shape galaxy evolution in denseenvironments, we study a sample of 116 x-ray selected galaxy groups at z=0.2-1with halo masses of 10^13-10^14 m_sun and centroids determined with weaklensing. we analyze morphologies based on hst imaging and colors determinedfrom 31 photometric bands for a stellar mass-limited population of 923satellite galaxies and a comparison sample of 16644 field galaxies. controllingfor variations in stellar mass across environments, we find significant trendsin the colors and morphologies of satellite galaxies with group-centricdistance and across cosmic time. specifically at low stellar mass(log(m_stellar/m_sun) = 9.8-10.3), the fraction of disk-dominated star-forminggalaxies declines from &gt;50% among field galaxies to &lt;20% among satellites nearthe centers of groups. this decline is accompanied by a rise in quenchedgalaxies with intermediate bulge+disk morphologies, and only a weak increase inred bulge-dominated systems. these results show that both color and morphologyare influenced by a galaxy's location within a group halo. we suggest thatstrangulation and disk fading alone are insufficient to explain the observedmorphological dependence on environment, and that galaxy mergers or close tidalencounters must play a role in building up the population of quenched galaxieswith bulges seen in dense environments at low redshift.

1307.0833	the lack of star formation gradients in galaxy groups up to z~1.6	in the local universe, galaxy properties show a strong dependence onenvironment. in cluster cores, early type galaxies dominate, whereasstar-forming galaxies are more and more common in the outskirts. at higherredshifts and in somewhat less dense environments (e.g. galaxy groups), thesituation is less clear. one open issue is that of whether and how the starformation rate (sfr) of galaxies in groups depends on the distance from thecentre of mass. to shed light on this topic, we have built a sample of x-rayselected galaxy groups at 0&lt;z&lt;1.6 in various blank fields (ecdfs, cosmos,goods). we use a sample of spectroscopically confirmed group members withstellar mass m &gt;10^10.3 m_sun in order to have a high spectroscopiccompleteness. as we use only spectroscopic redshifts, our results are notaffected by uncertainties due to projection effects. we use several sfrindicators to link the star formation (sf) activity to the galaxy environment.taking advantage of the extremely deep mid-infrared spitzer mips andfar-infrared herschel pacs observations, we have an accurate, broad-bandmeasure of the sfr for the bulk of the star-forming galaxies. we usemulti-wavelength sed fitting techniques to estimate the stellar masses of allobjects and the sfr of the mips and pacs undetected galaxies. we analyse thedependence of the sf activity, stellar mass and specific sfr on thegroup-centric distance, up to z~1.6, for the first time. we do not find anycorrelation between the mean sfr and group-centric distance at any redshift. wedo not observe any strong mass segregation either, in agreement withpredictions from simulations. our results suggest that either groups have amuch smaller spread in accretion times with respect to the clusters and thatthe relaxation time is longer than the group crossing time.

1312.4418	star formation and environmental quenching of geec2 group galaxies at  z~1	we present new analysis from the geec2 spectroscopic survey of galaxy groupsat $0.8&lt;z&lt;1$. our previous work revealed an intermediate population between thestar-forming and quiescent sequences and a strong environmental dependence inthe fraction of quiescent galaxies. only $\sim5$ per cent of star-forminggalaxies in both the group and field sample show a significant enhancement instar formation, which suggests that quenching is the primary process in thetransition from the star-forming to the quiescent state. to model theenvironmental quenching scenario, we have tested the use of differentexponential quenching timescales and delays between satellite accretion and theonset of quenching. we find that with no delay, the quenching timescale needsto be long in order to match the observed quiescent fraction, but then thismodel produces too many intermediate galaxies. fixing a delay time of 3 gyr, assuggested from the local universe, produces too few quiescent galaxies. theobserved fractions are best matched with a model that includes a delay that isproportional to the dynamical time and a rapid quenching timescale ($\sim0.25$gyr), but this model also predicts intermediate galaxies h{\delta} strengthhigher than that observed. using stellar synthesis models, we have tested otherscenarios, such as the rejuvenation of star formation in early-type galaxiesand a portion of quenched galaxies possessing residual star formation. ifenvironment quenching plays a role in the geec2 sample, then our work suggeststhat only a fraction of intermediate galaxies may be undergoing this transitionand that quenching occurs quite rapidly in satellite galaxies ($\lesssim0.25$gyr).

1406.3059	the agn population in x-ray selected galaxy groups at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.1$	we use chandra data to study the incidence and properties of active galacticnuclei (agn) in 16 intermediate redshift ($0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.1$) x-ray-selectedgalaxy groups in the chandra deep field-south. we measure an agn fraction of$f(l_{x,h} &gt; 10^{42}; m_r&lt;-20) = 8.0_{-2.3}^{+3.0}\%$ at $\bar{z} \sim 0.74$,approximately a factor of two higher than the agn fraction found for richclusters at comparable redshift. this extends the trend found at low redshiftfor groups to have higher agn fractions than clusters. our estimate of the agnfraction is also more than a factor of 3 higher than that of low redshiftx-ray-selected groups. using optical spectra from various surveys, we alsoconstrain the properties of emission-line selected agn in these groups.contrary to the large population of x-ray agn ($n(l_{x,h} &gt; 10^{41}$ erg/s) =25), we find only 4 emission-line agn, 3 of which are also x-ray bright.furthermore, most of the x-ray agn in our groups are optically-dull (i.e. lackstrong emission-lines) similar to those found in low redshift x-ray groups andclusters of galaxies. this contrasts with the agn population found in lowredshift optically-selected groups which are dominated by emission-line agn.the differences between the optically and x-ray-selected agn populations ingroups are consistent with a scenario where most agn in the densestenvironments are currently in a low accretion state.

1406.5591	the x-ray zurich environmental study (x-zens). ii. x-ray observations of  the diffuse intragroup medium in galaxy groups	we present the results of a pilot xmm-$newton$ and $chandra$ program aimed atstudying the diffuse intragroup medium (dim) of optically-selected nearbygroups from the zurinch environmental study (zens) catalog. the groups are in anarrow mass range about $10^{13}m_\odot$, a mass scale at which the interplaybetween the dim and the group member galaxies is still largely unprobed. x-rayemission from the dim is detected in the energy band 0.5--2 kev with flux $\le10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$, which is one order of magnitude fainter thanfor typical rosat groups (rass). for many groups we set upper limits to thex-ray luminosity, indicating that the detections are likely probing the upperenvelope of the x-ray emitting groups. we find evidence for our opticallyselected groups to be under-luminous with respect to predictions from x-rayscaling relations. x-ray mass determinations are in best agreement with thosebased on the member galaxies bulge luminosity, followed by their total opticalluminosity and velocity dispersion. we measure a stellar mass fraction with amedian value of about 1$\%$, with a contribution from the most massive galaxiesbetween 30 to 50 \%. optical and x-ray data give often complementary answersconcerning the dynamical state of the groups, and are essential for a completepicture of the system. extending this pilot program to a larger sample ofgroups is mandatory to unveil any imprint of interaction between membergalaxies and dim in halo potentials of key importance forenvironmentally-driven galactic evolution.

1406.6831	locuss: hydrostatic mass measurements of the high-$l_x$ cluster sample  -- cross-calibration of chandra and xmm-newton	we present a consistent analysis of chandra and xmm-newton observations of anapproximately mass-selected sample of 50 galaxy clusters at $0.15&lt;z&lt;0.3$ -- the"locuss high-$l_x$ sample". we apply the same analysis methods to data fromboth satellites, including newly developed analytic background models thatpredict the spatial variation of the chandra and xmm-newton backgrounds to$&lt;2\%$ and $&lt;5\%$ precision respectively. to verify the cross-calibration ofchandra and xmm-newton-based cluster mass measurements, we derive the massprofiles of the 21 clusters that have been observed with both satellites,extracting surface brightness and temperature profiles from identical regionsof the respective datasets. we obtain consistent results for the gas and totalhydrostatic cluster masses: the average ratio of chandra- to xmm-newton-basedmeasurements of $m_{\rm gas}$ and $m_x$ at $r_{500}$ are $0.99\pm0.02$ and$1.02\pm0.05$, respectively with an intrinsic scatter of $\sim3\%$ for gasmasses and $\sim8\%$ for hydrostatic masses. comparison of our hydrostatic massmeasurements at $r_{500}$ with the latest locuss weak-lensing results indicatethat the data are consistent with non-thermal pressure support at this radiusof $\sim7\%$. we also investigate the scaling relation between our hydrostaticcluster masses and published integrated compton parameter $y_{sph}$measurements from the sunyaev-zel'dovich array. we measure a scatter in mass atfixed $y_{sph}$ of $\sim16\%$ at $\delta=500$, which is consistent withtheoretical predictions of $\sim10-15\%$ scatter.

1407.1767	locuss: the near-infrared luminosity and weak-lensing mass scaling  relation of galaxy clusters	we present the first scaling relation between weak-lensing galaxy clustermass, $m_{wl}$, and near-infrared luminosity, $l_k$. our results are based on17 clusters observed with wide-field instruments on subaru, the united kingdominfrared telescope, the mayall telescope, and the mmt. we concentrate on therelation between projected 2d weak-lensing mass and spectroscopically confirmedluminosity within 1mpc, modelled as $m_{wl} \propto l_{k}^b$, obtaining a powerlaw slope of $b=0.83^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$ and an intrinsic scatter of$\sigma_{lnm_{wl}|l_{k}}=10^{+8}_{-5}\%$. intrinsic scatter of ~10% is aconsistent feature of our results regardless of how we modify our approach tomeasuring the relationship between mass and light. for example, deprojectingthe mass and measuring both quantities within $r_{500}$, that is itselfobtained from the lensing analysis, yields$\sigma_{lnm_{wl}|l_{k}}=10^{+7}_{-5}\%$ and $b=0.97^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$. we alsofind that selecting members based on their (j-k) colours instead ofspectroscopic redshifts neither increases the scatter nor modifies the slope.overall our results indicate that near-infrared luminosity measured on scalescomparable with $r_{500}$ (typically 1mpc for our sample) is a low scatter andrelatively inexpensive proxy for weak-lensing mass. near-infrared luminositymay therefore be a useful mass proxy for cluster cosmology experiments.

1501.01069	chemical enrichment rgs cluster sample (cheers): constraints on  turbulence	feedback from agn, galactic mergers, and sloshing are thought to give rise toturbulence, which may prevent cooling in clusters. we aim to measure theturbulence in clusters of galaxies and compare the measurements to some oftheir structural and evolutionary properties. it is possible to measure theturbulence of the hot gas in clusters by estimating the velocity widths oftheir x-ray emission lines. the rgs spectrometers aboard xmm-newton arecurrently the only instruments provided with sufficient effective area andspectral resolution in this energy domain. we benefited from excellent 1.6msnew data provided by the cheers project. the new observations improve thequality of the archival data and allow us to place constraints for someclusters, which were not accessible in previous work. one-half of the sampleshows upper limits on turbulence less than 500km/s. for several sources, ourdata are consistent with relatively strong turbulence with upper limits on thevelocity widths that are larger than 1000km/s. the ngc507 group of galaxiesshows transonic velocities, which are most likely associated with the mergingphenomena and bulk motions occurring in this object. where both low- andhigh-ionization emission lines have good enough statistics, we find largerupper limits for the hot gas, which is partly due to the different spatialextents of the hot and cool gas phases. our upper limits are larger than themach numbers required to balance cooling, suggesting that dissipation ofturbulence may prevent cooling, although other heating processes could bedominant. the systematics associated with the spatial profile of the sourcecontinuum make this technique very challenging, though still powerful, forcurrent instruments. the astro-h and athena missions will revolutionize thevelocity estimates and discriminate between different spatial regions andtemperature phases.

1511.07344	evidence for a change in the dominant satellite galaxy quenching  mechanism at z=1	we present an analysis of galaxies in groups and clusters at $0.8&lt;z&lt;1.2$,from the gclass and geec2 spectroscopic surveys. we compute a "conversionfraction" $f_{\rm convert}$ that represents the fraction of galaxies that wereprematurely quenched by their environment. for massive galaxies, $m_{\rmstar}&gt;10^{10.3}m_\odot$, we find $f_{\rm convert}\sim 0.4$ in the groups and$\sim 0.6$ in the clusters, similar to comparable measurements at $z=0$. thismeans the time between first accretion into a more massive halo and final starformation quenching is $t_p\sim 2$ gyr. this is substantially longer than theestimated time required for a galaxy's star formation rate to become zero onceit starts to decline, suggesting there is a long delay time during which littledifferential evolution occurs. in contrast with local observations we findevidence that this delay timescale may depend on stellar mass, with $t_p$approaching $t_{\rm hubble}$ for $m_{\rm star}\sim 10^{9.5}m_\odot$. the resultsuggests that the delay time must not only be much shorter than it is today,but may also depend on stellar mass in a way that is not consistent with asimple evolution in proportion to the dynamical time. instead, we find the dataare well-matched by a model in which the decline in star formation is due to"overconsumption", the exhaustion of a gas reservoir through star formation andexpulsion via modest outflows in the absence of cosmological accretion.dynamical gas removal processes, which are likely dominant in quenching newlyaccreted satellites today, may play only a secondary role at $z=1$.

astro-ph;0201242	xmm-newton observation of m87 i. single-phase temperature structure of  intracluster medium	we report the results of a detailed analysis of the temperature structure ofthe x-ray emitting plasma halo of m~87, the cd galaxy of the virgo cluster.using the mekal model, the data provide strong indications that theintracluster medium has a single phase structure locally, except the regionsassociated to the radio structures. the deprojected spectrum at each radius iswell fitted by a single temperature mekal model, except for the very centralregion ($&lt;$ 2 arcmin) which seems to be affected by the jet and radio lobestructure. the temperature of the intracluster plasma is 1 kev at the centerand gradually increases to 2.5 kev at 80 kpc. we have also fitted spectra usingthe apec code. although the large changes of the strength of k$\alpha$ linescauses a discrepancy between the fe-l and fe-k lines for the apec results, theoverall temperature structure has not changed. there is no sign of excessabsorption in the spectral data. the single-phase nature of the intraclustermedium is in conflict with the standard cooling flow model which is based on amulti-phase temperature structure. in addition, the signature of gas coolingbelow 0.8 kev to zero temperature is not observed as expected for a coolingflow. the gravitational mass profile derived from the temperature and densitydistribution of the intracluster gas shows two distinct contributions that canbe assigned to the gravitational potential of the cd galaxy and the cluster.the central temperature of the intracluster medium agrees well with thepotential depth and the velocity dispersion of the cd galaxy. the latter resultimplies that the central region of the intracluster medium is equivalent to avirialized interstellar medium in m 87.

astro-ph;0212069	xmm observation of m~87 ii. abundance structure of the interstellar and  intergalactic medium	based on a detailed study of the temperature structure of the intraclustermedium in the halo of m~87, abundance profiles of 7 elements, o, mg, si, s, ar,ca, and fe are derived. in addition, abundance ratios are derived from theratios of line strengths, whose temperature dependences are small within thetemperature range of the icm of m~87. the abundances of si, s, ar, ca and feshow strong decreasing gradients outside 2$'$ and become nearly constant withinthe radius at $\sim1.5$ solar. the fe/si ratio is determined to be 0.9 solarwith no radial gradient. in contrast, the o abundance is less than a half ofthe si abundance at the center and has a flatter gradient. the mg abundance is$\sim$1 solar within 2$'$, which is close to stellar abundance within the sameradius. the o/si/fe pattern of m~87 is located at the simple extension of thatof galactic stars. the observed mg/o ratio is about 1.25 solar, which is alsothe same ratio as for galactic stars. the o/si/fe ratio indicates that the snia contribution to si and fe becomes important towards the center and sn iaproducts have similar abundances of si and fe at least around m~87, which mayreflect dimmer sn ia observed in old stellar systems. the s abundance issimilar to the si abundance at the center, but has a steeper gradient. thisresult suggests that the s/si ratio of sn ii products is much smaller than thesolar ratio.

astro-ph;0408206	the unusual morphology of the intragroup medium in ngc 5171	we present the results of a 24 ks xmm-newton observation of the ngc 5171group of galaxies. ngc 5171 is unusual in that it is an x-ray bright group (l &gt;10^42 erg/s), with irregular contours which are not centred on a bright galaxy.the global spectrum is adequately described by a single temperature apec modelwith t = 0.96 +/- 0.04 kev, and z = 0.13 +/- 0.02 zsol, in good agreement withprevious rosat data. we find the x-ray contours are centred on a bright ridgeof emission stretching from the bgg to a nearby galaxy. spectral mappingreveals this ridge to be both cool (t ~ 1.1 kev) and metallic (z ~ 0.4 zsol) incomparison to its surrounding, suggesting it is the result of a tidalinteraction between the two galaxies. optical data reveals the member galaxiesto have a high velocity dispersion (sigma = 494 +/- 99 km/s), and asignificantly non-gaussian velocity distribution, suggesting the group is inthe process of merging. a region of hot gas with t = 1.58 +/- 0.36 kev is foundto the west of the bright central ridge, and we interpret this as shock-heatingresulting from the merging. a further region of emission to the south-east ofthe bright central ridge, with t = 1.14 +/- 0.13 kev, is probably associatedwith a background group, four times more distant.

astro-ph;0701594	dark matter maps reveal cosmic scaffolding	ordinary baryonic particles (such as protons and neutrons) account for onlyone-sixth of the total matter in the universe. the remainder is a mysterious"dark matter" component, which does not interact via electromagnetism and thusneither emits nor reflects light. as dark matter cannot be seen directly usingtraditional observations, very little is currently known about its properties.it does interact via gravity, and is most effectively probed throughgravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by thegravitational attraction of foreground mass concentrations. this is a purelygeometrical effect that is free of astrophysical assumptions and sensitive toall matter -- whether baryonic or dark. here we show high fidelity maps of thelarge-scale distribution of dark matter, resolved in both angle and depth. wefind a loose network of filaments, growing over time, which intersect inmassive structures at the locations of clusters of galaxies. our results areconsistent with predictions of gravitationally induced structure formation, inwhich the initial, smooth distribution of dark matter collapses into filamentsthen into clusters, forming a gravitational scaffold into which gas canaccumulate, and stars can be built.

0812.1438	hard x-ray properties of the merging cluster abell 3667 as observed with  suzaku	wide-band suzaku data on the merging cluster abell 3667 were examined forhard x-ray emission in excess to the known thermal component. suzaku detectedx-ray signals in the wide energy band from 0.5 to 40 kev. the hard x-ray (&gt; 10kev) flux observed by the hxd around the cluster center cannot be explained bya simple extension of the thermal emission with average temperature of ~7 kev.the emission is most likely an emission from a very hot (kt &gt; 13.2 kev) thermalcomponent around the cluster center, produced via a strong heating process inthe merger. in the north-west radio relic, no signature of non-thermal emissionwas observed. using the hxd, the overall upper-limit flux within a 34'x34'field-of-view around the relic is derived to be 5.3e-12 erg s-1 cm-2 in the10-40 kev band, after subtracting the icm contribution estimated using the xisor the xmm-newton spectra. directly on the relic region, the upper limit isfurther tightened by the xis data to be less than 7.3e-13 erg s-1 cm-2, whenconverted into the 10--40 kev band. the latter value suggest that the averagemagnetic field within the relic is higher than 1.6 ug. the non-thermal pressuredue to magnetic fields and relativistic electrons may be as large as ~20% ofthe thermal pressure in the region.
