0902.4469	the differential rotation of fu ori	the emission of fu orionis objects in outburst has been identified as arisingin rapidly accreting protoplanetary disks, based on a number of observationalproperties. a fundamental test of the accretion disk scenario is that thedifferentially rotating disk spectrum should produce a variation of rotationalvelocity with the wavelength of observation, as spectra taken at longerwavelengths probe outer, more slowly rotating disk regions. previousobservations of fu ori have shown smaller rotation at near-infrared (~ 2.2micron) wavelengths than observed at optical (~ 0.6 micron) wavelengthsconsistent with the assumption of keplerian rotation. here we report a spectrumfrom the phoenix instrument on gemini south which shows that differential(slower) rotation continues to be observed out to ~ 5 micron. the observedspectrum is well matched by the prediction of our accretion disk modelpreviously constructed to match the observed spectral energy distribution andthe differential rotation at wavelengths &lt; 2.2 micron. this kinematic resultallows us to confirm our previous inference of a large outer radius (~ 1 au)for the rapidly accreting region of the fu ori disk, which presentsdifficulties for outburst models relying purely on thermal instability. whilesome optical spectra have been interpreted to pose problems for the diskinterpretation of fu ori, we show that the adjustment of the maximum effectivetemperature of the disk model, proposed in a previous paper, greatly reducesthese difficulties.

0903.4455	a spatially resolved inner hole in the disk around gm aurigae	we present 0.3 arcsec resolution observations of the disk around gm aurigaewith the submillimeter array (sma) at a wavelength of 860 um and with theplateau de bure interferometer at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. these observationsprobe the distribution of disk material on spatial scales commensurate with thesize of the inner hole predicted by models of the spectral energy distribution.the data clearly indicate a sharp decrease in millimeter optical depth at thedisk center, consistent with a deficit of material at distances less than ~20au from the star. we refine the accretion disk model of calvet et al. (2005)based on the unresolved spectral energy distribution (sed) and demonstrate thatit reproduces well the spatially resolved millimeter continuum data at bothavailable wavelengths. we also present complementary sma observations of coj=3-2 and j=2-1 emission from the disk at 2" resolution. the observed comorphology is consistent with the continuum model prediction, with twosignificant deviations: (1) the emission displays a larger co j=3-2/j=2-1 lineratio than predicted, which may indicate additional heating of gas in the upperdisk layers; and (2) the position angle of the kinematic rotation patterndiffers by 11 +/- 2 degrees from that measured at smaller scales from the dustcontinuum, which may indicate the presence of a warp. we note thatphotoevaporation, grain growth, and binarity are unlikely mechanisms forinducing the observed sharp decrease in opacity or surface density at the diskcenter. the inner hole plausibly results from the dynamical influence of aplanet on the disk material. warping induced by a planet could also potentiallyexplain the difference in position angle between the continuum and co datasets.

0707.0019	probing the dust and gas in the transitional disk of cs cha with spitzer	here we present the spitzer irs spectrum of cs cha, a member of the ~2 myrold chamaeleon star-forming region, which reveals an optically thickcircumstellar disk truncated at ~43 au, the largest hole modeled in atransitional disk to date. within this inner hole, ~5x10^-5 lunar masses ofdust are located in a small optically thin inner region which extends from 0.1to 1 au. in addition, the disk of cs cha has bigger grain sizes and moresettling than the previously modeled transitional disks dm tau, gm aur, andcoku tau/4, suggesting that cs cha is in a more advanced state of dustevolution. the spitzer irs spectrum also shows [ne ii] 12.81 micronfine-structure emission with a luminosity of 1.3x10^29 ergs s^-1, indicatingthat optically thin gas is present in this ~43 au hole, in agreement withh_alpha measurements and a uv excess which indicate that cs cha is stillaccreting 1.2x10^-8 m_sun yr^-1. we do not find a correlation of the [ne ii]flux with l_x, however, there is a possible correlation with mass accretionrate, which if confirmed would suggest that euv fluxes due to accretion are themain agent for formation of the [ne ii] line.

0909.0688	far-ultraviolet h2 emission from circumstellar disks	we analyze the far-ultraviolet (fuv) spectra of 33 classical t tauri stars(ctts), including 20 new spectra obtained with the advanced camera for surveyssolar blind channel (acs/sbc) on the hubble space telescope. of the sources, 28are in the ~1 myr old taurus-auriga complex or orion molecular cloud, 4 in the8-10 myr old orion ob1a complex and one, tw hya, in the 10 myr old tw hydraeassociation. we also obtained fuv acs/sbc spectra of 10 non-accreting sourcessurrounded by debris disks with ages between 10 and 125 myr. we use a featurein the fuv spectra due mostly to electron impact excitation of \h2 to study theevolution of the gas in the inner disk. we find that the \h2 feature is absentin non-accreting sources, but is detected in the spectra of ctts and correlateswith accretion luminosity. since all young stars have active chromosphereswhich produce strong x-ray and uv emission capable of exciting \h2 in the disk,the fact that the non-accreting sources show no \h2 emission implies that the\h2 gas in the inner disk has dissipated in the non-accreting sources, althoughdust (and possibly gas) remains at larger radii. using the flux at 1600 {\aa},we estimate that the column density of \h2 left in the inner regions of thedebris disks in our sample is less than ~ 3x10^-6 g cm^-2, nine orders ofmagnitude below the surface density of the minimum mass solar nebula at 1 au.

0704.1518	crystalline silicates and dust processing in the protoplanetary disks of  the taurus young cluster	we characterize the crystalline silicate content and spatial distribution ofsmall dust grains in a large sample of protoplanetary disks in thetaurus-auriga young cluster, using spitzer space telescope mid-infraredspectra. in turn we use the results to analyze the evolution of structure andcomposition of these 1-2 myr-old disks around solar- and later-type youngstars, and test the standard models of dust processing which result in theconversion of originally amorphous dust into minerals. we find strong evidenceof evolution of the dust crystalline mass fraction in parallel with that of thestructure of the disks, in the sense that increasing crystalline mass fractionis strongly linked to dust settling to the disk midplane. we also confirm thatthe crystalline silicates are confined to small radii, r &lt; 10 au. however, wesee no significant correlation of crystalline mass fraction with stellar massor luminosity, stellar accretion rate, disk mass, or disk/star mass ratio, aswould be expected in the standard models of dust processing based uponphoto-evaporation and condensation close to the central star,accretion-heating-driven annealing at r &lt; 1 au, or spiral-shock heating at r &lt;10 au, with or without effective radial mixing mechanisms. either anothergrain-crystallizing mechanism dominates over these, or another process must beat work within the disks to erase the correlations they produce. we propose oneof each sort that seem to be worth further investigation, namely x-ray heatingand annealing of dust grains, and modulation of disk structure bygiant-planetary formation and migration.

0707.3429	the hot inner disk of fu ori	we have constructed a detailed radiative transfer disk model which reproducesthe main features of the spectrum of the outbursting young stellar object fuorionis from ~ 4000 angstrom, to ~ 8 micron. using an estimated visualextinction av~1.5, a steady disk model with a central star mass ~0.3 msun and amass accretion rate ~ 2e-4 msun/yr, we can reproduce the spectral energydistribution of fu ori quite well. with the mid-infrared spectrum obtained bythe infrared spectrograph (irs) on board the spitzer space telescope, weestimate that the outer radius of the hot, rapidly accreting inner disk is ~ 1au using disk models truncated at this outer radius. inclusion of radiationfrom a cooler irradiated outer disk might reduce the outer limit of the hotinner disk to ~ 0.5 au. in either case, the radius is inconsistent with a purethermal instability model for the outburst. our radiative transfer modelimplies that the central disk temperature tc &gt; 1000 k out to ~ 0.5 - 1 au,suggesting that the magnetorotational instability (mri) can be supported out tothat distance. assuming that the ~ 100 yr decay timescale in brightness of fuori represents the viscous timescale of the hot inner disk, we estimate theviscosity parameter (alpha) to be ~ 0.2 - 0.02 in the outburst state,consistent with numerical simulations of mri in disks. the radial extent of thehigh mass accretion region is inconsistent with the model of bell &amp; lin, butmay be consistent with theories incorporating both gravitational instabilityand mri.

1007.0232	wall emission in circumbinary disks: the case of coku tau/4	a few years ago, the mid-ir spectrum of a weak line t tauri star, coku tau/4,was explained as emission from the inner wall of a circumstellar disk, with theinner disk truncated at ~10 au. based on the sed shape and the assumption thatit was produced by a single star and its disk, coku tau/4 was classified as aprototypical transitional disk, with a clean inner hole possibly carved out bya planet, some other orbiting body, or by photodissociation. however, recentlyit has been discovered that coku tau/4 is a close binary system. this impliesthat the observed mid-ir sed is probably produced by the circumbinary disk. theaim of the present paper is to model the sed of coku tau/4 as arising from theinner wall of a circumbinary disk, with parameters constrained by what is knownabout the central stars and by a dynamical model for the interaction betweenthese stars and their surrounding disk. in order to fit the spitzer irs sed,the binary orbit should be almost circular, implying a small mid-ir variability(10%) related to the variable distances of the stars to the inner wall of thecircumbinary disk. our models suggest that the inner wall of coku tau/4 islocated at 1.7a, where a is the semi-major axis of the binary system (a~8au). asmall amount of optically thin dust in the hole (&lt;0.01 lunar masses) helps toimprove the fit to the 10microns silicate band. also, we find that water iceshould be absent or have a very small abundance (a dust to gas mass ratio&lt;5.6x10^{-5}). in general, for a binary system with eccentricity e&gt;0, the modelpredicts mid-ir variability with periods similar to orbital timescales,assuming that thermal equilibrium is reached instantaneously.

1008.3916	spitzer observations of the lambda orionis cluster. ii. disks around  solar-type and low mass stars	we present irac/mips spitzer space telescope observations of the solar typeand the low mass stellar population of the young (~5 myr) lambda orioniscluster. combining optical and 2mass photometry, we identify 436 stars asprobable members of the cluster. given the distance (450 pc) and the age of thecluster, our sample ranges in mass from 2 solar mass to objects below thesubstellar limit. with the addition of the spitzer mid-infrared data, we haveidentified 49 stars bearing disks in the stellar cluster. using spectral energydistribution (sed) slopes, we place objects in several classes: non-excessstars (diskless), stars with optically thick disks, stars with ``evolveddisks''( with smaller excesses than optically thick disk systems), and``transitional disks'' candidates (in which the inner disk is partially orfully cleared). the disk fraction depends on the stellar mass, ranging from ~6%for k type stars (rc-j&lt;2) to ~27% for stars with spectral type m5 or later(rc-j&gt;4). we confirm the dependence of disk fraction on stellar mass in thisage range found in other studies. regarding clustering levels, the overallfraction of disks in the lambda orionis cluster is similar to those reported inother stellar groups with ages normally quoted as ~5 myr.

1011.0446	chemistry of a protoplanetary disk with grain settling and lyman alpha  radiation	we present results from a model of the chemical evolution of protoplanetarydisks. in our models we directly calculate the changing propagation andpenetration of a high energy radiation field with lyman alpha radiationincluded. we also explore the effect on our models of including dust grainsettling. we find that, in agreement with earlier studies, the evolution ofdust grains plays a large role in determining how deep the uv radiationpenetrates into the disk. significant grain settling at the midplane leads tomuch smaller freeze-out regions and a correspondingly larger molecular layer,which leads to an increase in column density for molecular species such as co,cn and so. the inclusion of lyman alpha radiation impacts the disk chemistrythrough specific species that have large photodissociation cross sections at1216 a. these include hcn, nh3 and ch4, for which the column densities aredecreased by an order of magnitude or more due to the presence of lyman alpharadiation in the uv spectrum. a few species, such as co2 and so, are enhancedby the presence of lyman alpha radiation, but rarely by more than a factor of afew.

1012.4395	transitional and pre-transitional disks: gap opening by multiple  planets?	we use 2d hydrodynamic simulations of viscous disks to examine whetherdynamically-interacting multiple giant planets can explain the large gaps(spanning over one order of magnitude in radius) inferred for the transitionaland pre-transitional disks around t tauri stars. in the absence of inner diskdust depletion, we find that it requires three to four giant planets to open uplarge enough gaps to be consistent with inferences from spectral energydistributions, because the gap width is limited by the tendency of the planetsto be driven together into 2:1 resonances. with very strong tidal torquesand/or rapid planetary accretion, fewer planets can also generate a largecavity interior to the locally formed gap(s) by preventing outer disk materialfrom moving in. in these cases, however, the reduction of surface densityproduces a corresponding reduction in the inner disk accretion rate onto thestar; this makes it difficult to explain the observed accretion rates of thepre/transitional disks. we find that even with four planets in disks,additional substantial dust depletion is required to explain observed diskgaps/holes. substantial dust settling and growth, with consequent significantreductions in optical depths, is inferred for typical t tauri disks in anycase, and an earlier history of dust growth is consistent with the hypothesisthat pre/transitional disks are explained by the presence of giant planets. weconclude that the depths and widths of gaps, and disk accretion rates inpre/transitional disks cannot be reproduced by a planet-induced gap openingscenario alone. significant dust depletion is also required within thegaps/holes. order of magnitude estimates suggest the mass of small dustparticles (&lt;1 micron) relative to the gas must be depleted to 1e-5 -- 1e-2 ofthe interstellar medium value, implying a very efficient mechanism of smalldust removal or dust growth.

1102.0956	evolution of x-ray and fuv disk-dispersing radiation fields	we present new x-ray and far ultraviolet (fuv) observations of t tauri starscovering the age range 1 to 10 myr. our goals are to observationally constrainthe intensity of radiation fields responsible for evaporating gas from thecircumstellar disk and to assess the feasibility of current photoevaporationmodels, focusing on x-ray and uv radiation. we greatly increase the number of7-10 myr old t tauri stars observed in the x-rays by including observations ofthe well populated 25 ori aggregate in the orion ob1a subassociation. withthese new 7-10 myr objects, we confirm that x-ray emission remains constantfrom 1-10 myr. we also show, for the first time, observational evidence for theevolution of fuv radiation fields with a sample of 56 accreting andnon-accreting young stars spanning 1 myr to 1 gyr. we find that the fuvemission decreases on timescales consistent with the decline of accretion inclassical t tauri stars until reaching the chromospheric level in weak t tauristars and debris disks. overall, we find that the observed strength of highenergy radiation is consistent with that required by photoevaporation models todissipate the disks in timescales of approximately 10 myr. finally, we findthat the high energy fields that affect gas evolution are not similarlyaffecting dust evolution; in particular, we find that disks with innerclearings, the transitional disks, have similar levels of fuv emission as fulldisks.

1106.3343	on rapid disk accretion and initial conditions in protostellar evolution	low-mass protostars may accrete most of their material through short-livedepisodes of rapid disk accretion; yet until recently evolutionary tracks forthese protostars assumed only constant or slowly-varying accretion. importantinitial steps toward examining the potential effects of rapid accretion wererecently made by baraffe, chabrier, &amp; gallardo, who showed that in the limit oflow-temperature ("cold") accretion, protostars may have much smaller radii thanfound in previous treatments. such small radii at the end of protostellaraccretion would have the effect of making some young stars appear much older -perhaps as much as 10 myr - than they really are. however, we argue that veryrapid disk accretion is unlikely to be cold, because observations of thebest-studied pre-main sequence disks with rapid disk accretion outbursts - thefu ori objects - have spectral energy distributions which imply large, notsmall, protostellar radii. in addition, theory indicates models that at highaccretion rates, protostellar disks become internally hot and geometricallythick, making it much more likely that hot material is added to the star. inaddition, the very large luminosity of the accretion disk is likely toirradiate the central star strongly, heating up the outer layers andpotentially expanding them. nevertheless, the baraffe et al. calculationsemphasize the importance of initial protostellar radii for subsequentevolution.

1204.1969	on the nature of the herbig b[e] star binary system v921 scorpii:  geometry and kinematics of the circumprimary disk on sub-au scales	v921 scorpii is a close binary system (separation 0.025") showing theb[e]-phenomenon. the system is surrounded by an enigmatic bipolar nebula, whichmight have been shaped by episodic mass-loss events, possibly triggered bydynamical interactions between the companion and the circumprimary disk (krauset al. 2012a). in this paper, we investigate the spatial structure andkinematics of the circumprimary disk, with the aim to obtain new insights intothe still strongly debated evolutionary stage. for this purpose, we combine,for the first time, infrared spectro-interferometry (vlti/amber, r=12,000) andspectro-astrometry (vlt/crires, r=100,000), which allows us to study theau-scale distribution of circumstellar gas and dust with an unprecedentedvelocity resolution of 3 km*s^-1. using a model-independent photocenteranalysis technique, we find that the br-gamma-line emission rotates in the sameplane as the dust disk. we can reproduce the wavelength-differentialvisibilities and phases and the double-peaked line profile using akeplerian-rotating disk model. the derived mass of the central star is5.4+/-0.4 m_sun*(d/1150 pc), which is considerably lower than expected from thespectral classification, suggesting that v921 sco might be more distant (dapprox 2kpc) than commonly assumed. using the geometric information provided byour br-gamma spectro-interferometric data and paschen, brackett, and pfund linedecrement measurements in 61 hydrogen recombination line transitions, we derivethe density of the line-emitting gas (n_e=2...6*10^19 m^-3). given that ourmeasurements can be reproduced with a keplerian velocity field withoutoutflowing velocity component and the non-detection of age-indicatingspectroscopic diagnostics, our study provides new evidence for thepre-main-sequence nature of v921 sco.

1205.4789	a far-ultraviolet atlas of low-resolution hubble space telescope spectra  of t tauri stars	we present a far-ultraviolet (fuv) spectral atlas consisting of spectra of 91pre-main sequence stars. most stars in this sample were observed with the spacetelescope imaging spectrograph (stis) and advanced camera for surveys (acs) onthe \emph{hubble space telescope} (\emph{hst}). we find strong correlationsamong the \ion{o}{1} $\lambda$1304 triplet, %\ion{c}{2} $\lambda$1335, the\ion{si}{4} $\lambda\lambda$1394/1403 doublet, the \ion{c}{4} $\lambda$1549doublet, and the \ion{he}{2} $\lambda$1640 line luminosities. for classical ttauri stars (cttss), we also find strong correlations between these lines andthe accretion luminosity, suggesting that these lines form in processes relatedto accretion. these fuv line fluxes and x-ray luminosity correlate loosely withlarge scatters. the fuv emission also correlates well with h$\alpha$, h$\beta$,and \ion{ca}{2} k line luminosities. these correlations between fuv and opticaldiagostics can be used to obtain rough estimates of fuv line fluxes fromoptical observations. molecular hydrogen (h$_{2}$) emission is generallypresent in the spectra of actively accreting cttss but not the weak-lined ttauri stars (wttss) that are not accreting. the presence of h$_2$ emission inthe spectrum of hd 98800 n suggests that the disk should be classified asactively accreting rather than a debris disk. the spectra in the atlas areavailable at http://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/ttauriatlas.

1208.2270	from protoplanetary disks to extrasolar planets: understanding the life  cycle of circumstellar gas with ultraviolet spectroscopy	few scientific discoveries have captured the public imagination like theexplosion of exoplanetary science during the past two decades. this work hasfundamentally changed our picture of earth's place in the universe and led nasato make significant investments towards understanding the demographics ofexoplanetary systems and the conditions that lead to their formation. the storyof the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems is essentially the storyof the circumstellar gas and dust that are initially present in theprotostellar environment; in order to understand the variety of planetarysystems observed, we need to understand the life cycle of circumstellar gasfrom its initial conditions in protoplanetary disks to its endpoint as planetsand their atmospheres. in this white paper response to nasa's request forinformation "science objectives and requirements for the next nasa uv/visibleastrophysics mission concepts (nnh12zda008l)", we describe scientific programsthat would use the unique capabilities of a future nasa ultraviolet(uv)/visible space observatory to make order-of-magnitude advances in ourunderstanding of the life cycle of circumstellar gas.

1210.5252	constraints on the radial variation of grain growth in the as 209  circumstellar disk	we present dust continuum observations of the protoplanetary disk surroundingthe pre-main sequence star as 209, spanning more than an order of magnitude inwavelength from 0.88 to 9.8 mm. the disk was observed with sub-arcsecondangular resolution (0.2"-0.5") to investigate radial variations in its dustproperties. at longer wavelengths, the disk emission structure is notably morecompact, providing model-independent evidence for changes in the grainproperties across the disk. we find that physical models which reproduce thedisk emission require a radial dependence of the dust opacity \kappa_{\nu}.assuming that the observed wavelength-dependent structure can be attributed toradial variations in the dust opacity spectral index (\beta), we find that\beta(r) increases from \beta&lt;0.5 at \sim20 au to \beta&gt;1.5 for r&gt;80 au,inconsistent with a constant value of \beta\ across the disk (at the 10\sigma\level). furthermore, if radial variations of \kappa_{\nu} are caused byparticle growth, we find that the maximum size of the particle-sizedistribution (a_{max}) increases from sub-millimeter-sized grains in the outerdisk (r&gt;70 au) to millimeter and centimeter-sized grains in the inner diskregions (r&lt; 70 au). we compare our observational constraint on a_{max}(r) withpredictions from physical models of dust evolution in proto-planetary disks.for the dust composition and particle-size distribution investigated here, ourobservational constraints on a_{max}(r) are consistent with models where themaximum grain size is limited by radial drift.

1212.0861	a 0.2 solar mass protostar with a keplerian disk in the very young l1527  irs system	in their earliest stages, protostars accrete mass from their surroundingenvelopes through circumstellar disks. until now, the smallest observedprotostar/envelope mass ratio was ~2.1. the protostar l1527 irs is thought tobe in the earliest stages of star formation. its envelope contains ~1 solarmass of material within a ~0.05 pc radius, and earlier observations suggestedthe presence of an edge-on disk. here we report observations of dust continuumemission and 13co (j=2-1) line emission from the disk around l1527, from whichwe determine a protostellar mass of m = 0.19 +/- 0.04 solar masses and aprotostar/envelope mass ratio of ~0.2. we conclude that most of the luminosityis generated through the accretion process, with an accretion rate of ~6.6 x10^-7 solar masses per year. if it has been accreting at that rate through muchof its life, its age is ~300,000 yr, though theory suggests larger accretionrates earlier, so it may be younger. the presence of a rotationally--supporteddisk is confirmed and significantly more mass may be added to itsplanet-forming region as well as the protostar itself.

1303.0769	accretion rates for t tauri stars using nearly simultaneous ultraviolet  and optical spectra	we analyze the accretion properties of 21 low mass t tauri stars using adataset of contemporaneous near ultraviolet (nuv) through optical observationsobtained with the hubble space telescope imaging spectrograph (stis) and theground based small and medium aperture research telescope system (smarts), aunique dataset because of the nearly simultaneous broad wavelength coverage.our dataset includes accreting t tauri stars (ctts) in taurus, chamaeleon i,$\eta$ chamaeleon and the tw hydra association. for each source we calculatethe accretion rate by fitting the nuv and optical excesses above thephotosphere, produced in the accretion shock, introducing multiple accretioncomponents characterized by a range in energy flux (or density) for the firsttime. this treatment is motivated by models of the magnetospheric geometry andaccretion footprints, which predict that high density, low filling factoraccretion spots co-exist with low density, high filling factor spots. byfitting the uv and optical spectra with multiple accretion components, we canexplain excesses which have been observed in the near infrared. comparing ourestimates of the accretion rate to previous estimates, we find somediscrepancies; however, they may be accounted for when considering assumptionsfor the amount of extinction and variability in optical spectra. therefore, weconfirm many previous estimates of the accretion rate. finally, we measureemission line luminosities from the same spectra used for the accretion rateestimates, to produce correlations between accretion indicators (h$\beta$, caii k, c ii] and mg ii) and accretion properties obtained simultaneously.

1303.6313	transitional disks and their origins: an infrared spectroscopic survey  of orion a	transitional disks are protoplanetary disks around young stars, with innerholes or gaps which are surrounded by optically thick outer, and often inner,disks. here we present observations of 62 new transitional disks in the orion astar-forming region. these were identified using the \textit{spitzer spacetelescope}'s infrared spectrograph and followed up with determinations ofstellar and accretion parameters using the infrared telescope facility's spex.we combine these new observations with our previous results on transitionaldisks in taurus, chamaeleon i, ophiuchus and perseus, and with archival x-rayobservations. this produces a sample of 105 transitional disks of "cluster" age3 myr or less, by far the largest hitherto assembled. we use this sample tosearch for trends between the radial structure in the disks and many othersystem properties, in order to place constraints on the possible origins oftransitional disks. we see a clear progression of host star accretion rate andthe different disk morphologies. we confirm that transitional disks withcomplete central clearings have median accretion rates an order of magnitudesmaller than radially continuous disks of the same population. pre-transitionaldisks --- those objects with gaps that separate inner and outer disks --- havemedian accretion rates intermediate between the two. our results from thesearch for statistically significant trends, especially related to $\dot{m}$,strongly support that in both cases the gaps are far more likely to be due tothe gravitational influence of jovian planets or brown dwarfs orbiting withinthe gaps, than to any of the photoevaporative, turbulent or grain-growthprocesses that can lead to disk dissipation. we also find that the fraction ofclass ii ysos which are transitional disks is large, 0.1-0.2, especially in theyoungest associations.

1304.2768	resolving the gap and au-scale asymmetries in the pre-transitional disk  of v1247 orionis	pre-transitional disks are protoplanetary disks with a gapped disk structure,potentially indicating the presence of young planets in these systems. in orderto explore the structure of these objects and their gap-opening mechanism, weobserved the pre-transitional disk v1247 orionis using the very large telescopeinterferometer, the keck interferometer, keck-ii, gemini south, and irtf. thisallows us spatially resolve the au-scale disk structure from near- tomid-infrared wavelengths (1.5 to 13 {\mu}m), tracing material at differenttemperatures and over a wide range of stellocentric radii. our observationsreveal a narrow, optically-thick inner-disk component (located at 0.18 au fromthe star) that is separated from the optically thick outer disk (radii &gt;46 au),providing unambiguous evidence for the existence of a gap in thispre-transitional disk. surprisingly, we find that the gap region is filled withsignificant amounts of optically thin material with a carbon-dominated dustmineralogy. the presence of this optically thin gap material cannot be deducedsolely from the spectral energy distribution, yet it is the dominantcontributor at mid-infrared wavelengths. furthermore, using keck/nirc2 aperturemasking observations in the h, k', and l' band, we detect asymmetries in thebrightness distribution on scales of about 15-40 au, i.e. within the gapregion. the detected asymmetries are highly significant, yet their amplitudeand direction changes with wavelength, which is not consistent with a companioninterpretation but indicates an inhomogeneous distribution of the gap material.we interpret this as strong evidence for the presence of complex densitystructures, possibly reflecting the dynamical interaction of the disk materialwith sub-stellar mass bodies that are responsible for the gap clearing.

1305.3604	modeling the resolved disk around the class 0 protostar l1527	we present high-resolution sub/millimeter interferometric imaging of theclass 0 protostar l1527 irs (iras 04368+2557) at 870 micron and 3.4 mm from thesubmillimeter array (sma) and combined array for research in millimeterastronomy (carma). we detect the signature of an edge-on disk surrounding theprotostar with an observed diameter of 180 au in the sub/millimeter images. themass of the disk is estimated to be 0.007 m_sun, assuming optically thin,isothermal dust emission. the millimeter spectral index is observed to be quiteshallow at all the spatial scales probed; alpha ~ 2, implying a dust opacityspectral index beta ~ 0. we model the emission from the disk and surroundingenvelope using monte carlo radiative transfer codes, simultaneously fitting thesub/millimeter visibility amplitudes, sub/millimeter images, resolved l\arcmin\image, spectral energy distribution, and mid-infrared spectrum. the bestfitting model has a disk radius of r = 125 au, is highly flared (h ~ r^1.3),has a radial density profile rho ~ r^-2.5, and has a mass of 0.0075 m_sun. thescale height at 100 au is 48 au, about a factor of two greater than verticalhydrostatic equilibrium. the resolved millimeter observations indicate thatdisks may grow rapidly throughout the class 0 phase. the mass and radius of theyoung disk around l1527 is comparable to disks around pre-main sequence stars;however, the disk is considerably more vertically extended, possibly due to acombination of lower protostellar mass, infall onto the disk upper layers, andlittle settling of ~1 micron-sized dust grains.

1307.4368	viscous evolution and photoevaporation of circumstellar disks due to  external fuv radiation fields	this paper explores the effects of fuv radiation fields from external starson circumstellar disk evolution. disks residing in young clusters can beexposed to extreme levels of fuv flux from nearby ob stars, and observationsshow that disks in such environments are being actively photoevaporated.typical fuv flux levels can be factors of \sim 10^{2} - 10^{4} higher than theinterstellar value. these fields are effective in driving mass loss fromcircumstellar disks because they act at large radial distance from the hoststar, i.e., where most of the disk mass is located, and where the gravitationalpotential well is shallow. we combine viscous evolution (an \alpha-disk model)with an existing fuv photoevaporation model to derive constraints on disklifetimes, and to determine disk properties as functions of time, includingmass loss rates, disk masses, and radii. we also consider the effects of x-rayphotoevaporation from the host star using an existing model, and show that fordisks around solar-mass stars, externally-generated fuv fields are often thedominant mechanism in depleting disk material. for sufficiently largeviscosities, fuv fields can efficiently photoevaporate disks over the entirerange of parameter space. disks with viscosity parameter \alpha = 10^{-3} areeffectively dispersed within 1-3 myr; for higher viscosities (\alpha = 10^{-2})disks are dispersed within \sim 0.25 - 0.5 myr. furthermore, disk radii aretruncated to less than \sim100 au, which can possibly affect the formation ofplanets. our model predictions are consistent with the range of observed massesand radii of proplyds in the orion nebula cluster.

1402.7103	an observational perspective of transitional disks	transitional disks are objects whose inner disk regions have undergonesubstantial clearing. the spitzer space telescope produced detailed spectralenergy distributions (seds) of transitional disks that allowed us to infertheir radial dust disk structure in some detail, revealing the diversity ofthis class of disks. the growing sample of transitional disks also opened upthe possibility of demographic studies, which provided unique insights. therenow exist (sub)millimeter and infrared images that confirm the presence oflarge clearings of dust in transitional disks. in addition, protoplanetcandidates have been detected within some of these clearings. transitionaldisks are thought to be a strong link to planet formation around young starsand are a key area to study if further progress is to be made on understandingthe initial stages of planet formation. here we provide a review and synthesisof transitional disk observations to date with the aim of providing timelydirection to the field, which is about to undergo its next burst of growth asalma reaches its full potential. we discuss what we have learned abouttransitional disks from seds, color-color diagrams, and imaging in the (sub)mmand infrared. we then distill the observations into constraints for the maindisk clearing mechanisms proposed to date (i.e., photoevaporation, graingrowth, and companions) and explore how the expected observational signaturesfrom these mechanisms, particularly planet-induced disk clearing, compare toactual observations. lastly, we discuss future avenues of inquiry to be pursuedwith alma, jwst, and next generation of ground-based telescopes.

1411.1026	characterizing the youngest herschel-detected protostars i. envelope  structure revealed by carma dust continuum observations	we present carma 2.9 mm dust continuum emission observations of a sample of14 herschel-detected class 0 protostars in the orion a and b molecular clouds,drawn from the pacs bright red sources (pbrs) sample (stutz et al.). theseobjects are characterized by very red 24 \micron\ to 70 \micron\ colors andprominent submillimeter emission, suggesting that they are very young class 0protostars embedded in dense envelopes. we detect all of the pbrs in 2.9 mmcontinuum emission and emission from 4 protostars and 1 starless core in thefields toward the pbrs; we also report 1 new pbrs source. the ratio of 2.9 mmluminosity to bolometric luminosity is higher by a factor of $\sim$5 onaverage, compared to other well-studied protostars in the perseus and ophiuchusclouds. the 2.9 mm visibility amplitudes for 6 of the 14 pbrs are very flat asa function of uv-distance, with more than 50\% of the source emission arisingfrom radii $&lt;$ 1500 au. these flat visibility amplitudes are most consistentwith spherically symmetric envelope density profiles with$\rho$~$\propto$~r$^{-2.5}$. alternatively, there could be a massive unresolvedstructure like a disk or a high-density inner envelope departing from a smoothpower-law. the large amount of mass on scales $&lt;$ 1500 au (implying highaverage central densities) leads us to suggest that that the pbrs with flatvisibility amplitude profiles are the youngest pbrs and may be undergoing abrief phase of high mass infall/accretion and are possibly among the youngestclass 0 protostars. the pbrs with more rapidly declining visibility amplitudesstill have large envelope masses, but could be slightly more evolved.

0804.1795	a large-scale optical-near infrared survey for brown dwarfs and very  low-mass stars in the orion ob1 association	we report the initial results of a large-scale optical-near infrared surveyto extend the known young population of the entire orion star-forming regiondown to the substellar domain. using deep optical i-band photometry and datafrom the 2mass survey, we selected candidates across ~14.8 deg^2 in the ~8 myrold ori ob1a subassociation and over ~6.7 deg^2 in the ori ob1b subassociation(age ~3), with completeness down to 0.05mo and 0.072mo respectively. weobtained low resolution optical spectra for a subsample of 4 candidates in oriob1a and 26 in ori ob1b; as a result we confirmed 3 new members in ori ob1a,one of which is substellar, and 19 new members in ori ob1b, out of which 7 areat the substellar limit and 5 are substellar. we looked into the presence ofaccretion signatures by measuring the strength of the ha line in emission.accordingly, we classified the new members as having classical t-tauri star(ctts) or weak lined t tauri star-like (wtts) nature. we found that all the newmembers confirmed in ori ob1a are wttss, while 39 +25/-22 % of the new membersin ori ob1b exhibit ctts-like behavior, suggestive of ongoing accretion from acircum(sub)stellar disk. additionally we found that none of the membersconfirmed in ob1a show near-ir color excess while 38 +26/-21 % of ob1b membersshow h-k color excess. these results are consistent with recent findings forlow mass young stars in orion ob1. the similarity in ctts-like properties andnear-ir excess across the substellar boundary gives support to the idea of acommon formation mechanism for low mass stars and at least the most massivebrown dwarfs. finally, we remark the discovery of two new members classified ascttss, both exhibiting w(ha) &lt; -140 a, suggesting significant ongoingaccretion.

1501.06609	csi 2264: characterizing young stars in ngc 2264 with short-duration,  periodic flux dips in their light curves	we identify nine young stellar objects (ysos) in the ngc 2264 star-formingregion with optical {\em corot} light curves exhibiting short-duration,shallow, periodic flux dips. all of these stars have infrared (ir) excessesthat are consistent with their having inner disk walls near the keplerianco-rotation radius. the repeating photometric dips have fwhm generally lessthan one day, depths almost always less than 15%, and periods (3&lt;p&lt;11 days)consistent with dust near the keplerian co-rotation period. the flux dips varyconsiderably in their depth from epoch to epoch, but usually persist forseveral weeks and, in two cases, were present in data collected on successiveyears. for several of these stars, we also measure the photospheric rotationperiod and find that the rotation and dip periods are the same, as predicted bystandard "disk-locking" models. we attribute these flux dips to clumps ofmaterial in or near the inner disk wall, passing through our line of sight tothe stellar photosphere. in some cases, these dips are also present insimultaneous {\em spitzer} irac light curves at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. wecharacterize the properties of these dips, and compare the stars with lightcurves exhibiting this behavior to other classes of yso in ngc 2264. a numberof physical mechanisms could locally increase the dust scale height near theinner disk wall, and we discuss several of those mechanisms; the most plausiblemechanisms are either a disk warp due to interaction with the stellar magneticfield or dust entrained in funnel-flow accretion columns arising near the innerdisk wall.

1504.00562	using fuv to ir variability to probe the star-disk connection in the  transitional disk of gm aur	we analyze 3 epochs of ultraviolet (uv), optical and near-infrared (nir)observations of the taurus transitional disk gm aur using the hubble spacetelescope imaging spectrograph (stis) and the infrared telescope facility spexspectrograph. observations were separated by one week and 3 months in order tostudy variability over multiple timescales. we calculate accretion rates foreach epoch of observations using the stis spectra and find that those separatedby one week had similar accretion rates (~1e-8 solar masses/yr) while the epochobtained 3 months later had a substantially lower accretion rate (~4e-9 solarmasses/yr). we find that the decline in accretion rate is caused by lowerdensities of material in the accretion flows, as opposed to a lower surfacecoverage of the accretion columns. during the low accretion rate epoch we alsoobserve lower fluxes at both far uv (fuv) and ir wavelengths, which tracemolecular gas and dust in the disk, respectively. we find that this can beexplained by a lower dust and gas mass in the inner disk. we attribute theobserved variability to inhomogeneities in the inner disk, near the corotationradius, where gas and dust may co-exist near the footprints of themagnetospheric flows. these fuv--nir data offer a new perspective on thestructure of the inner disk, the stellar magnetosphere, and their interaction.

1509.07520	grain growth in the circumstellar disks of the young stars cy tau and  doar 25	we present new results from the disks@evla program for two young stars: cytau and doar 25. we trace continuum emission arising from their circusmtellardisks from spatially resolved observations, down to tens of au scales, at{\lambda} = 0.9, 2.8, 8.0, and 9.8 mm for doar25 and at {\lambda} = 1.3, 2.8,and 7.1 mm for cy tau. additionally, we constrain the amount of emission whoseorigin is different from thermal dust emission from 5 cm observations. directlyfrom interferometric data, we find that observations at 7 mm and 1 cm traceemission from a compact disk while millimeter-wave observations trace anextended disk structure. from a physical disk model, where we characterize thedisk structure of cy tau and doar 25 at wavelengths shorter than 5 cm, we findthat (1) dust continuum emission is optically thin at the observed wavelengthsand over the spatial scales studied, (2) a constant value of the dust opacityis not warranted by our observations, and (3) a high-significance radialgradient of the dust opacity spectral index, {\beta}, is consistent with theobserved dust emission in both disks, with low-{\beta} in the inner disk andhigh-{\beta} in the outer disk. assuming that changes in dust properties arisesolely due to changes in the maximum particle size (amax), we constrain radialvariations of amax in both disks, from cm-sized particles in the inner disk (r&lt; 40 au) to millimeter sizes in the outer disk (r &gt; 80 au). these observationalconstraints agree with theoretical predictions of the radial-drift barrier,however, fragmentation of dust grains could explain our amax(r) constraints ifthese disks have lower turbulence and/or if dust can survive high-velocitycollisions.

0806.2639	a spitzer view of protoplanetary disks in the gamma velorum cluster	we present new spitzer space telescope observations of stars in the young ~5myr gamma velorum stellar cluster. combining optical and 2mass photometry, wehave selected 579 stars as candidate members of the cluster. with the additionof the spitzer mid-infrared data, we have identified 5 debris disks arounda-type stars, and 5-6 debris disks around solar-type stars, indicating that thestrong radiation field in the cluster does not completely suppress theproduction of planetesimals in the disks of cluster members. however, we findsome evidence that the frequency of circumstellar primordial disks is lower,and the ir flux excesses are smaller than for disks around stellar populationswith similar ages. this could be evidence for a relatively fast dissipation ofcircumstellar dust by the strong radiation field from the highest mass star(s)in the cluster. another possibility is that gamma velorum stellar cluster isslightly older than reported ages and the the low frequency of primordial disksreflects the fast disk dissipation observed at ~5 myr.

0806.3715	long-wavelength excesses of fu orionis objects: flared outer disks or  infalling envelopes?	the mid- to far-infrared emission of the outbursting fu orionis objects hasbeen attributed either to a flared outer disk or to an infalling envelope. werevisit this issue using detailed radiative transfer calculations to model therecent, high signal-to-noise data from the irs instrument on the {spitzer spacetelescope}. in the case of fu ori, we find that a physically-plausible flareddisk irradiated by the central accretion disk matches the observations.building on our previous work, our accretion disk model with outer diskirradiation by the inner disk reproduces the spectral energy distributionbetween ~4000 angstroms to ~40 microns. our model is consistent withnear-infrared interferometry but there are some inconsistencies withmid-infared interferometric results. including the outer disk allows us torefine our estimate of the outer radius of the outbursting, high mass accretionrate disk in fu ori as ~ 0.5 au, which is a crucial parameter in assessingtheories of the fu orionis phenomenon. we are able to place an upper limit onthe mass infall rate of any remnant envelope infall rate to ~ 7e-7 msun/yrassuming a centrifugal radius of 200 au. the fuor bbw 76 is also well modelledby a 0.6 au inner disk and a flared outer disk. however, v1515 cyg requires anenvelope with an outflow cavity to adequately reproduce the irs spectrum. incontrast with the suggestion by green et al., we do not require a flattenedenvelope to match the observations; the inferred cavity shape is qualitativelyconsistent with typical protostellar envelopes. this variety of dustystructures suggests that the fu orionis phase can be present at either early orlate stages of protostellar evolution.

0807.2291	confirmation of a gapped primordial disk around lkca 15	recently, analysis of near-infrared broad-band photometry and spitzer irsspectra has led to the identification of a new "pre-transitional disk" classwhose members have an inner optically thick disk separated from an outeroptically thick disk by an optically thin gap. this is in contrast to the"transitional disks" which have inner disk holes (i.e. large reductions ofsmall dust from the star out to an outer optically thick wall). in lkca 15, oneof these proposed pre-transitional disks, detailed modeling showed thatalthough the near-infrared fluxes could be understood in terms of opticallythick material at the dust sublimation radius, an alternative model of emissionfrom optically thin dust over a wide range of radii could explain theobservations as well. to unveil the true nature of lkca 15's inner disk weobtained a medium-resolution near-infrared spectrum spanning the wavelengthrange 2-5 microns using spex at the nasa infrared telescope facility. we reportthat the excess near-infrared emission above the photosphere of lkca 15 is ablack-body continuum which can only be due to optically thick material in aninner disk around the star. when this confirmation of a primordial inner diskis combined with earlier observations of an inner edge to lkca 15's outer diskit reveals a gapped structure. forming planets emerge as the most likelymechanism for clearing the gap we detect in this evolving disk.

astro-ph;0010051	infall models of class 0 protostars	we have carried out radiative transfer calculations of infalling, dustyenvelopes surrounding embedded protostars to understand the observed propertiesof the recently identified ``class 0'' sources. to match the far-infrared peaksin the spectral energy distributions of objects such as the prototype class 0source vla 1623, pure collapse models require mass infall rates$\sim10^{-4}\msun$yr$^{-1}$. the radial intensity distributions predicted bysuch infall models are inconsistent with observations of vla 1623 at sub-mmwavelengths, in agreement with the results of andre et al. (1993) who found adensity profile of $\rho \propto r^{-1/2}$ rather than the expected $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$ gradient. to resolve this conflict, while still invokinginfall to produce the outflow source at the center of vla 1623, we suggest thatthe observed sub-mm intensity distribution is the sum of two components: aninner infall zone, plus an outer, more nearly constant-density region. thisexplanation of the observations requires that roughly half the total massobserved within 2000 au radius of the source lies in a region external to theinfall zone. the column densities for this external region are comparable tothose found in the larger oph a cloud within which vla 1623 is embedded. theextreme environments of class 0 sources lead us to suggest an alternative oradditional interpretation of these objects: rather than simply concluding withandre et al. that class 0 objects only represent the earliest phases ofprotostellar collapse, and ultimately evolve into older ``class i'' protostars,we suggest that many class 0 sources could be the protostars of very denseregions.

astro-ph;0201425	evidence for a developing gap in a 10 myr old protoplanetary disk	we have developed a self-consistent model of the disk around the nearby 10myr old star tw hya which matches the observed spectral energy distribution and7mm images of the disk. the model requires a significant dust size evolutionand a partially-evacuated inner disk region, as predicted by theories of planetformation. the outer disk, which extends to at least 140 au in radius, is veryoptically thick at ir wavelengths and quite massive ~0.06 msun for therelatively advanced age of this t tauri star. this implies long viscous anddust evolution timescales, although dust must have grown to sizes of order ~1cmto explain the sub-mm and mm spectral slopes. in contrast, the negligiblenear-infrared excess emission of this system requires that the disk beoptically thin inside ~4 au.this inner region cannot be completely evacuated;we need ~0.5 lunar mass of ~1 micron particles remaining to produce theobserved 10 micron silicate emission. our model requires a distinct transitionin disk properties at ~4 au, separating the inner and outer disk. the inneredge of the optically-thick outer disk must be heated almost frontally by thestar to account for the excess flux at mid-ir wavelengths. we speculate thatthis truncation of the outer disk may be the signpost of a developing gap dueto the effects of a growing protoplanet; the gap is still presumably evolvingbecause material still resides in it, as indicated by the silicate emission,the molecular hydrogen emission, and by the continued accretion onto thecentral star (albeit at a much lower rate than typical of younger t tauristars). tw hya thus may become the rosetta stone for our understanding of theevolution and dissipation of protoplanetary disks.

astro-ph;0304531	the spatial distribution of fluorescent h$_2$ near t tau	new subarcsecond fuv observations of t tau with hst/stis show spatiallyresolved structures in the 2"x2" area around the star. the structures show inmultiline emission of fluorescent h_2 pumped by lyman alpha. one emissionstructure follows the cavity walls observed around t tau n in scattered lightin the optical. a temperature greater or equal to 1000k is required to haveenough population in the h_2 to produce the observed fluorescent lines; in thecool environment of the t tau system, shock heating is required to achieve thistemperature at distances of a few tens of au. fluorescent h_2 along the cavitywall represents the best evidence to date for the action of low-density,wide-opening-angle outflows driving cavities into the molecular medium atscales smaller than 100 au. a southern region of emission consists of two arcs,with shape and orientation similar to the arcs of h_2 2.12 microns andforbidden line emission crossing the outflow associated with the embeddedsystem t tau s. this region is located near the centroid of forbidden lineemission at the blueshifted lobe of the n-s outflow.

astro-ph;0310067	unveiling the inner disk structure of t tauri stars	we present near-infrared spectra of the excess continuum emission from theinnermost regions of classical t tauri disks. in almost all cases, the shape ofthe excess is consistent with that of a single-temperature blackbody with t ~1400 k, similar to the expected dust sublimation temperature for typical dustcompositions. the amount of excess flux roughly correlates with the accretionluminosity in objects with similar stellar properties. we compare ourobservations with the predictions of simple disk models having an inner rimlocated at the dust sublimation radius, including irradiation heating of thedust from both the stellar and accretion luminosities. the models yield innerrim radii in the range 0.07-0.54 au, increasing with higher stellar andaccretion luminosities. using typical parameters which fit our observed sample,we predict a rim radius ~ 0.2 au for the t tauri star dg tau, which agrees withrecent keck near-infrared interferometric measurements. for large massaccretion rates, the inner rim lies beyond the corotation radius at (or within)which magnetospheric accretion flows are launched, which implies that puregaseous disks must extend inside the dust rim. thus, for a significant fractionof young stars, dust cannot exist in the innermost disk, calling into questiontheories in which solid particles are ejected by a wind originating at themagnetospheric radius.

astro-ph;0603104	24-micron detections of disks around very low-mass stars and brown  dwarfs in ic 348: grain growth/settling and inner holes?	we present observations of six late-type members of the young cluster ic 348detected at 24 microns with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer(mips).at least four of the objects are probably substellar. combining these data withground-based optical and near-infrared photometry and complementaryobservations with the infrared array camera (irac), we have modeled thespectral energy distributions using detailed models of irradiated accretiondisks. we are able to fit the observations with models using a range of maximumgrain sizes from ism-type dust to grains as large as 1 millimeter. two objectsshow a lack of excess emission at wavelengths shortward of 5.8-8 microns butsignificant excess at longer wavelengths, indicative of large optically thin orevacuated inner holes. our models indicate a inner hole of radius ~ 0.5-0.9 aufor the brown dwarf l316; this is the first brown dwarf with evidence for anau-scale inner disk hole. we examine several possible mechanisms for the innerdisk clearing in this case, including photoevaporation and planet formation.

astro-ph;0605294	why do t tauri disks accrete?	observations of t tauri stars and young brown dwarfs suggest that theaccretion rates of their disks scale strongly with the central stellar mass,approximately $\mdot \propto m_*^2$. no dependence of accretion rate on stellarmass is predicted by the simplest version of the layered disk model of gammie(1996), in which non-thermal ionization of upper disk layers allows accretionto occur via the magnetorotational instability. we show that a minormodification of gammie's model to include heating by irradiation from thecentral star yields a modest dependence of $\mdot$ upon the mass of the centralstar. a purely viscous disk model could provide a strong dependence ofaccretion rate on stellar mass if the initial disk radius (before much viscousevolution has occurred) has a strong dependence on stellar mass. however, it isfar from clear that at least the most massive pre-main sequence disks can betotally magnetically activated by x-rays or cosmic rays. we suggest that acombination of effects are responsible for the observed dependence, with thelowest-mass stars having the lowest mass disks, which can be thoroughlymagnetically active, while the higher-mass stars have higher mass disks whichhave layered accretion and relatively inactive or ``dead'' central zones atsome radii. in such dead zones, we suggest that gravitational instabilities mayplay a role in allowing accretion to proceed. in this connection, we emphasizethe uncertainty in disk masses derived from dust emission, and argue that ttauri disk masses have been systematically underestimated by conventionalanalyses. further study of accretion rates, especially in the lowest-massstars, would help to clarify the mechanisms of accretion in t tauri stars.

astro-ph;0701710	25 orionis: a kinematically distinct 10 myr old group in orion ob1a	we report here on the photometric and kinematic properties of a well definedgroup of nearly 200 low-mass pre-main sequence stars, concentrated within ~ 1deg of the early-b star 25 ori, in the orion ob1a sub-association. we refer tothis stellar aggregate as the 25 orionis group. the group also harbors theherbig ae/be star v346 ori and a dozen other early type stars with photometry,parallaxes, and some with ir excess emission, consistent with group membership.the number of high and low-mass stars is in agreement with expectations from astandard initial mass function. the velocity distribution for the young starsin 25 ori shows a narrow peak centered at 19.7 km/s, very close to the velocityof the star 25 ori. our results provide new and compelling evidence that the 25ori group is a distinct kinematic entity, and that considerable space andvelocity structure is present in the ori ob1a sub-association. the low-massmembers follow a well defined band in the color-magnitude diagram, consistentwith an isochronal age of ~ 7-10 myr, depending on the assumed evolutionarymodel. the highest density of members is located near the star 25 ori, but theactual extent of the cluster cannot be well constrained with our present data.in a simple-minded kinematic evolution scenario, the 25 ori group may representthe evolved counterpart of a younger aggregate like the sigma ori cluster. the25 ori stellar aggregate is the most populous ~ 10 myr sample yet known within500 pc, setting it as an excellent laboratory to study the evolution ofsolar-like stars and protoplanetary disks.

astro-ph;9806060	accretion disks around young objects. i. the detailed vertical structure	we discuss the properties of an accretion disk around a star with parameterstypical of classical t tauri stars (ctts), and with the average accretion ratefor these disks. the disk is assumed steady and geometrically thin. theturbulent viscosity coefficient is expressed using the alpha prescription andthe main heating mechanisms considered are viscous dissipation and irradiationby the central star. the energy is transported by radiation, turbulentconduction and convection.  we find that irradiation from the central star is the main heating agent ofthe disk, except in the innermost regions, r less than 2 au. the irradiationincreases the temperature of the outer disk relative to the purely viscouscase. as a consequence, the outer disk (r larger than 5 au) becomes less dense,optically thin and almost vertically isothermal, with a temperaturedistribution t proportional to r^{-1/2}. the decrease in surface density at theouter disk, decreases the disk mass by a factor of 4 respect to a purelyviscous case. in addition, irradiation tends to make the outer disk regionsstable against gravitational instabilities.

astro-ph;9902335	evolution of disk accretion	we review the present knowledge of disk accretion in young low mass stars,and in particular, the mass accretion rate and its evolution with time. themethods used to obtain mass accretion rates from ultraviolet excesses andemission lines are described, and the current best estimates of mass accretionrate for classical t tauri stars and for objects still surrounded by infallingenvelopes are given. we argue that the low mass accretion rates of the latterobjects require episodes of high mass accretion rate to build the bulk of thestar. similarity solutions for viscous disk evolution suggest that the innerdisk mass accretion rates can be self-consistently understood in terms of thedisk mass and size if the viscosity parameter alpha is approximately 1e-2.close companion stars may accelerate the disk accretion process, resulting inaccretion onto the central star in less or equal than 1myr; this may helpexplain the number of very young stars which are not currently surrounded byaccretion disks (the weak emission t tauri stars).

astro-ph;9906280	the complex protostellar source iras 04325+2402	we report hubble space telescope near-infrared nicmos observations of aremarkable low-luminosity class i (protostellar) source in the taurus molecularcloud. iras 04325+2402 exhibits a complex bipolar scattered light nebula. thecentral continuum source is resolved and may be multiple, or may be crossed bya small dust lane. complex arcs seen in scattered light surround the centralsource; the physical nature of these structures is not clear, but they mayreflect perturbations from multiple stellar sources or from time-dependent massejection. a second, resolved continuum source is found at a projected distanceof approximately 1150 au from the central region, near the edge of a nebularlobe probably produced by outflow. the images indicate that this second sourceis another low-luminosity young stellar object, seen nearly edge-on through adusty disk and envelope system with disk diameter $\sim 60$ au. we suggest thatthe scattered light ``streaks'' associated with this second source arelimb-brightened outflow cavities in the dusty envelope, possibly perturbed byinteraction with the outflow lobes of the main source. the nature of thecompanion is uncertain, since it is observed mostly in scattered light, but ismost probably a very low mass star or brown dwarf, with a minimum luminosity of$\sim 10^{-2} \lsun$. our results show that protostellar sources may havemultiple centers of infall and non-aligned disks and outflows, even onrelatively small scales.

astro-ph;9907330	accretion disks around young objects. ii. tests of well-mixed models  with ism dust	we construct detailed vertical structure models of irradiated accretion disksaround t tauri stars with interstellar medium dust uniformly mixed with gas.the dependence of the structure and emission properties on mass accretion rate,viscosity parameter, and disk radius is explored using these models. thetheoretical spectral energy distributions (seds) and images for allinclinations are compared with observations of the entire population ofclassical t tauri stars (ctts) and class i objects in taurus. in particular, wefind that the median near-infrared fluxes can be explained within the errorswith the most recent values for the median accretion rates for ctts. we furthershow that the majority of the class i sources in taurus cannot be class iisources viewed edge-on because they are too luminous and their colors would beconsistent with disks seen only in a narrow range of inclinations. our modelsappear to be too geometrically thick at large radii, as suggested by: (a)larger far-infrared disk emission than in the typical seds of t tauri stars;(b) wider dark dust lanes in the model images than in the images of hh30 and hktau/c; and (c) larger predicted number of stars extincted by edge-on disks thanconsistent with current surveys. the large thickness of the model is aconsequence of the assumption that dust and gas are well-mixed, suggesting thatsome degree of dust settling may be required to explain the observations.

astro-ph;9912145	the cida-quest large scale variability survey in the orion ob  association: initial results	using the 8k x 8k ccd mosaic camera on the 1m schmidt telescope in venezuela,we are conducting a large-scale, deep optical, multiepoch, photometric (bvriha)survey over 120 sq.deg. in the orion ob association, aimed at identifying thelow mass stellar populations with ages less than about 10 myr.  we present initial results for a 34 sq.deg. area spanning orion 1b, 1a andthe b cloud. using variability as our main selection criterion we derive muchcleaner samples than with the usual single-epoch photometric selection,allowing us to attain a much higher efficiency in follow up spectroscopy andresulting in an preliminary list of 74 new low-mass (~ 0.4 msun) pre-mainsequence stars.  though preliminary, this list of new t tauri stars already suggests that thefraction of accreting young stars in 1a is much lower than in 1b, which wouldbe expected if 1a is indeed older than 1b. we are analyzing in detail the lightcurves of these new stars, and spectroscopy of further candidates is under way.

0706.0279	hubble and spitzer observations of an edge-on circumstellar disk around  a brown dwarf	we present observations of a circumstellar disk that is inclined close toedge-on around a young brown dwarf in the taurus star-forming region. usingdata obtained with spex at the nasa infrared telescope facility, we find thatthe slope of the 0.8-2.5 um spectrum of the brown dwarf 2mass j04381486+2611399cannot be reproduced with a photosphere reddened by normal extinction. instead,the slope is consistent with scattered light, indicating that circumstellarmaterial is occulting the brown dwarf. by combining the spex data with mid-irphotometry and spectroscopy from the spitzer space telescope and previouslypublished millimeter data from scholz and coworkers, we construct the spectralenergy distribution for 2mass j04381486+2611399 and model it in terms of ayoung brown dwarf surrounded by an irradiated accretion disk. the presence ofboth silicate absorption at 10 um and silicate emission at 11 um constrains theinclination of the disk to be ~70 deg, i.e. ~20 deg from edge-on. additionalevidence of the high inclination of this disk is provided by our detection ofasymmetric bipolar extended emission surrounding 2mass j04381486+2611399 inhigh-resolution optical images obtained with the hubble space telescope.according to our modeling for the sed and images of this system, the diskcontains a large inner hole that is indicative of a transition disk (r_in~58r_star~0.275 au) and is somewhat larger than expected from embryo ejectionmodels (r_out=20-40 au vs. r_out&lt;10-20 au).
