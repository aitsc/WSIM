0903.3239	the santa fe light cone simulation project: ii. the prospects for direct  detection of the whim with sze surveys	detection of the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim) using sunyaev-zeldovicheffect (sze) surveys is an intriguing possibility, and one that may allowobservers to quantify the amount of "missing baryons" in the whim phase. weestimate the necessary sensitivity for detecting low density whim gas with thesouth pole telescope (spt) and planck surveyor for a synthetic 100 squaredegree sky survey. this survey is generated from a very large, high dynamicrange adaptive mesh refinement cosmological simulation performed with the enzocode. we find that for a modest increase in the spt survey sensitivity (afactor of 2-4), the whim gas makes a detectable contribution to the integratedsky signal. for a planck-like satellite, similar detections are possible with amore significant increase in sensitivity (a factor of 8-10). we point out thatfor the whim gas, the kinematic sze signal can sometimes dominate the thermalsze where the thermal sze decrement is maximal (150 ghz), and that using thecombination of the two increases the chance of whim detection using szesurveys. however, we find no evidence of unique features in the thermal szeangular power spectrum that may aid in its detection. interestingly, there aredifferences in the power spectrum of the kinematic sze, which may not allow usto detect the whim directly, but could be an important contaminant incosmological analyses of the ksze-derived velocity field. corrections derivedfrom numerical simulations may be necessary to account for this contamination.

0905.2960	piecewise parabolic method on a local stencil for magnetized supersonic  turbulence simulation	stable, accurate, divergence-free simulation of magnetized supersonicturbulence is a severe test of numerical mhd schemes and has been surprisinglydifficult to achieve due to the range of flow conditions present. here wepresent a new, higher order-accurate, low dissipation numerical method whichrequires no additional dissipation or local "fixes" for stable execution. wedescribe ppml, a local stencil variant of the popular ppm algorithm for solvingthe equations of compressible ideal magnetohydrodynamics. the principaldifference between ppml and ppm is that cell interface states are evolvedrather that reconstructed at every timestep, resulting in a compact stencil.interface states are evolved using riemann invariants containing all transversederivative information. the conservation laws are updated in an unsplitfashion, making the scheme fully multidimensional. divergence-free evolution ofthe magnetic field is maintained using the higher order-accurate constrainedtransport technique of gardiner and stone. the accuracy and stability of thescheme is documented against a bank of standard test problems drawn from theliterature. the method is applied to numerical simulation of supersonic mhdturbulence, which is important for many problems in astrophysics, includingstar formation in dark molecular clouds. ppml accurately reproduces inthree-dimensions a transition to turbulence in highly compressible isothermalgas in a molecular cloud model. the low dissipation and wide spectral bandwidthof this method make it an ideal candidate for direct turbulence simulations.

1001.3411	parallel hop: a scalable halo finder for massive cosmological data sets	modern n-body cosmological simulations contain billions ($10^9$) of darkmatter particles. these simulations require hundreds to thousands of gigabytesof memory, and employ hundreds to tens of thousands of processing cores on manycompute nodes. in order to study the distribution of dark matter in acosmological simulation, the dark matter halos must be identified using a halofinder, which establishes the halo membership of every particle in thesimulation. the resources required for halo finding are similar to therequirements for the simulation itself. in particular, simulations have becometoo extensive to use commonly-employed halo finders, such that thecomputational requirements to identify halos must now be spread across multiplenodes and cores. here we present a scalable-parallel halo finding method calledparallel hop for large-scale cosmological simulation data. based on the halofinder hop, it utilizes mpi and domain decomposition to distribute the halofinding workload across multiple compute nodes, enabling analysis of muchlarger datasets than is possible with the strictly serial or previous parallelimplementations of hop. we provide a reference implementation of this method asa part of the toolkit yt, an analysis toolkit for adaptive mesh refinement(amr) data that includes complementary analysis modules. additionally, wediscuss a suite of benchmarks that demonstrate that this method scales well upto several hundred tasks and datasets in excess of $2000^3$ particles. theparallel hop method and our implementation can be readily applied to any kindof n-body simulation data and is therefore widely applicable.

1001.4549	the effect of projection on derived mass-size and linewidth-size  relationships	power law mass-size and linewidth-size correlations, two of "larson's laws,"are often studied to assess the dynamical state of clumps within molecularclouds. using the result of a hydrodynamic simulation of a molecular cloud, weinvestigate how geometric projection may affect the derived larsonrelationships. we find that large scale structures in the column density maphave similar masses and sizes to those in the 3d simulation (ppp). smallerscale clumps in the column density map are measured to be more massive than theppp clumps, due to the projection of all emitting gas along lines of sight.further, due to projection effects, structures in a synthetic spectralobservation (ppv) may not necessarily correlate with physical structures in thesimulation. in considering the turbulent velocities only, the linewidth-sizerelationship in the ppv cube is appreciably different from that measured fromthe simulation. including thermal pressure in the simulated linewidths imposesa minimum linewidth, which results in a better agreement in the slopes of thelinewidth-size relationships, though there are still discrepancies in theoffsets, as well as considerable scatter. employing commonly used assumptionsin a virial analysis, we find similarities in the computed virial parameters ofthe structures in the ppv and ppp cubes. however, due to the discrepancies inthe linewidth- and mass- size relationships in the ppp and ppv cubes, wecaution that applying a virial analysis to observed clouds may be misleadingdue to geometric projection effects. we speculate that consideration ofphysical processes beyond kinetic and gravitational pressure would be requiredfor accurately assessing whether complex clouds, such as those with highlyfilamentary structure, are bound.

0708.1954	why do only some galaxy clusters have cool cores?	flux-limited x-ray samples indicate that about half of rich galaxy clustershave cool cores. why do only some clusters have cool cores while others do not?in this paper, cosmological n-body + eulerian hydrodynamic simulations,including radiative cooling and heating, are used to address this question aswe examine the formation and evolution of cool core (cc) and non-cool core(ncc) clusters. these adaptive mesh refinement simulations produce both cc andncc clusters in the same volume. they have a peak resolution of 15.6 h^{-1} kpcwithin a (256 h^{-1} mpc)^3 box. our simulations suggest that there areimportant evolutionary differences between cc clusters and their ncccounterparts. many of the numerical cc clusters accreted mass more slowly overtime and grew enhanced cool cores via hierarchical mergers; when late majormergers occurred, the cc's survived the collisions. by contrast, ncc clustersexperienced major mergers early in their evolution that destroyed embryoniccool cores and produced conditions that prevented cc re-formation. as a result,our simulations predict observationally testable distinctions in the propertiesof cc and ncc beyond the core regions in clusters. in particular, we finddifferences between cc versus ncc clusters in the shapes of x-ray surfacebrightness profiles, between the temperatures and hardness ratios beyond thecores, between the distribution of masses, and between their superclusterenvirons. it also appears that cc clusters are no closer to hydrostaticequilibrium than ncc clusters, an issue important for precision cosmologymeasurements.

0708.2444	ionization front instabilities in primordial h ii regions	radiative cooling by metals in shocked gas mediates the formation ofionization front instabilities in the galaxy today that are responsible for avariety of phenomena in the interstellar medium, from the morphologies ofnebulae to triggered star formation in molecular clouds. an important questionin early reionization and chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium iswhether such instabilities arose in the h ii regions of the first stars andprimeval galaxies, which were devoid of metals. we present three-dimensionalnumerical simulations that reveal both shadow and thin-shell instabilitiesreadily formed in primordial gas. we find that the hard uv spectra ofpopulation iii stars broadened primordial ionization fronts, causing h2formation capable of inciting violent thin- shell instabilities in d-typefronts, even in the presence of intense lyman-werner flux. the high post- frontgas temperatures associated with he ionization sustained and exacerbated shadowinstabilities, unaided by molecular hydrogen cooling. our models indicate thatmetals eclipsed h2 cooling in i-front instabilities at modest concentrations,from 0.001- 0.01 solar. we conclude that ionization front instabilities wereprominent in the h ii regions of the first stars and galaxies, influencing theescape of ionizing radiation and metals into the early universe.

0711.1904	late reheating of the igm by quasars: a radiation hydrodynamical  simulation of helium ii reionization	we study the ionization and thermal evolution of the intergalactic mediumduring the epoch of \heii reionization by means of radiation hydrodynamicalcosmological simulations. we post-process baryonic density fields from astandard optically-thin igm simulation with a homogeneous galaxy-dominated uvbackground (uvb) which reionizes \hi and \hei at z=6.5 but does not have anycontribution to the ionization of \heii. quasars with luminosities proportionalto the mass of the host halos are then introduced as point sources throughoutthe 100 mpc simulation volume consistent with the pei luminosity function. weevolve the spatial distribution of the \heii ionizing radiation field using atime-implicit variable tensor eddington factor radiative transfer scheme.simultaneously, we also solve for the local ionization of \heii to \heii andthe associated photoheating of the gas. we find that the percolation of the\heiii regions is essentially complete by z=2.5. when comparing to aself-consistent optically thin simulation we find that in optically thickcalculation the gas temperature is higher by a factor of approximately 1.7 atthe mean gas density level. we use 300 random lines of sight to compute at$\bar{z} = 2.5 \pm 0.1$ a mean \heii \lya line transmission of $\bar{f} = 0.304\pm 0.002$. we compare the broadening width of the \hi and \heii \lya lines tothe results from the self-consistent optically thin simulation and find a shiftby approximately 1.25 km/s of the b-parameter distribution. estimating therelative broadening width between the two forests shows that the \heii medianb-parameter is about 0.8 times the median \hi broadening width. this impliesthat the \heii absorbers are physically extended consistent with conclusionsfrom observed lines of sight.

1206.1043	the birth of a galaxy. ii. the role of radiation pressure	massive stars provide feedback that shapes the interstellar medium ofgalaxies at all redshifts and their resulting stellar populations. here wepresent three adaptive mesh refinement radiation hydrodynamics simulations thatillustrate the impact of momentum transfer from ionising radiation to theabsorbing gas on star formation in high-redshift dwarf galaxies. momentumtransfer is calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation with a raytracing algorithm that is adaptive in spatial and angular coordinates. we findthat momentum input partially affects star formation by increasing theturbulent support to a three-dimensional rms velocity equal to the circularvelocity of early haloes. compared to a calculation that neglects radiationpressure, the star formation rate is decreased by a factor of five to 1.8 x10^{-2} msun/yr in a dwarf galaxy with a dark matter and stellar mass of 2.0 x10^8 and 4.5 x 10^5 solar masses, respectively, when radiation pressure isincluded. its mean metallicity of 10^{-2.1} z_sun is consistent with theobserved dwarf galaxy luminosity-metallicity relation. however, what one maynaively expect from the calculation without radiation pressure, the centralregion of the galaxy overcools and produces a compact, metal-rich stellarpopulation with an average metallicity of 0.3 z_sun, indicative of an incorrectphysical recipe. in addition to photo-heating in hii regions, radiationpressure further drives dense gas from star forming regions, so supernovaefeedback occurs in a warmer and more diffuse medium, launching metal-richoutflows. capturing this aspect and a temporal separation between the start ofradiative and supernova feedback are numerically important in the modeling ofgalaxies to avoid the "overcooling problem". we estimate that dust in earlylow-mass galaxies is unlikely to aid in momentum transfer from radiation to thegas.

0711.2529	the effect of large-scale power on simulated spectra of the lya forest	we study the effects of box size on enzo simulations of the intergalacticmedium (igm) at z = 2. we follow statistics of the cold dark matter (cdm) andthe lya absorption. we find that the larger boxes have fewer pixels withsignificant absorption (flux &lt; 0.96) and more pixels in longer stretches withlittle or no absorption, and they have wider lya lines. we trace these effectback to the additional power in larger boxes from longer wavelength modes. theigm in our larger boxes is hotter, from increased pressure heating due tofaster hydrodynamical infall. when we increase the photoheating in smallerboxes to compensate, their lya statistics change to mimic those of a box oftwice the size. statistics converge towards their value in the largest (76.8mpc) box, except for the most common value of the cdm density which continuesto rise. when we compare to errors with data, we find that our 76.8 mpc box islarger than we need for the mean flux, barely large enough for the columndensity distribution and the power spectrum of the flux, and too small for theline widths. this box with 75 kpc cells has approximately the same mean flux asqso spectra, but the lya lines are too wide by 2.6 km/s, there are too fewlines with log h i column densities &gt; 10^17 cm^-2, and the power of the flux istoo low by 20 - 50%, from small to large scales. four times smaller cell sizedoes not resolve these differences, nor do simple changes to the ultravioletbackground that drives the h and he ii ionization. it is hard to see howsimulations using popular cosmological and astrophysical parameters can matchlyman-alpha forest data at z=2.

1209.2737	comparisons of cosmological mhd galaxy cluster simulations to radio  observations	radio observations of galaxy clusters show that there are $\mu$g magneticfields permeating the intra-cluster medium (icm), but it is hard to accuratelyconstrain the strength and structure of the magnetic fields without the help ofadvanced computer simulations. we present qualitative comparisons of syntheticvla observations of simulated galaxy clusters to radio observations of faradayrotation measure (rm) and radio halos. the cluster formation is modeled usingadaptive mesh refinement (amr) magneto-hydrodynamic (mhd) simulations with theassumption that the initial magnetic fields are injected into the icm by activegalactic nuclei (agns) at high redshift. in addition to simulated clusters inxu et al. (2010, 2011), we present a new simulation with magnetic fieldinjections from multiple agns. we find that the cluster with multiple injectionsources is magnetized to a similar level as in previous simulations with asingle agn. the rm profiles from simulated clusters, both $|rm|$ and thedispersion of rm ($\sigma_{rm}$), are consistent at a first-order with theradial distribution from observations. the correlations between the$\sigma_{rm}$ and x-ray surface brightness from simulations are in a broadagreement with the observations, although there is an indication that thesimulated clusters could be slightly over-dense and less magnetized withrespect to those in the observed sample. in addition, the simulated radio halosagree with the observed correlations between the radio power versus the clusterx-ray luminosity and between the radio power versus the radio halo size. thesestudies show that the cluster wide magnetic fields that originate from agns andare then amplified by the icm turbulence (xu et al. 2010) match observations ofmagnetic fields in galaxy clusters.

1211.3122	cosmological mhd simulations of galaxy cluster radio relics: insights  and warnings for observations	non-thermal radio emission from cosmic ray electrons in the vicinity ofmerging galaxy clusters is an important tracer of cluster merger activity, andis the result of complex physical processes that involve magnetic fields,particle acceleration, gas dynamics, and radiation. in particular, objectsknown as radio relics are thought to be the result of shock-acceleratedelectrons that, when embedded in a magnetic field, emit synchrotron radiationin the radio wavelengths. in order to properly model this emission, we utilizethe adaptive mesh refinement simulation of the magnetohydrodynamic evolution ofa galaxy cluster from cosmological initial conditions. we locate shock frontsand apply models of cosmic ray electron acceleration that are then input intoradio emission models. we have determined the thermodynamic properties of thisradio-emitting plasma and constructed synthetic radio observations to compareto observed galaxy clusters. we find a significant dependence of the observedmorphology and radio relic properties on the viewing angle of the cluster,raising concerns regarding the interpretation of observed radio features inclusters. we also find that a given shock should not be characterized by asingle mach number. we find that the bulk of the radio emission comes from gaswith t&gt;5x10^7, \rho~10^(-28)-10^(-27) g/cm^3, with magnetic field strengths of0.1-1.0 \mu g and shock mach numbers of m~3-6. we present an analysis of theradio spectral index which suggests that the spatial variation of the spectralindex can mimic synchrotron aging. finally, we examine the polarizationfraction and position angle of the simulated radio features, and compare toobservations.

1305.1325	population iii stars and remnants in high redshift galaxies	recent simulations of population iii star formation have suggested that somefraction form in binary systems, in addition to having a characteristic mass oftens of solar masses. the deaths of metal-free stars result in the initialchemical enrichment of the universe and the production of the firststellar-mass black holes. here we present a cosmological adaptive meshrefinement simulation of an overdense region that forms a few 10^9 msun darkmatter halos and over 13,000 population iii stars by redshift 15. we find thatmost halos do not form population iii stars until they reach mvir ~ 10^7 msunbecause this biased region is quickly enriched from both population iii andgalaxies, which also produce high levels of ultraviolet radiation that suppressh2 formation. nevertheless, population iii stars continue to form, albeit inmore massive halos, at a rate of ~ 10^{-4} msun yr^{-1} mpc^{-3} at redshift15. the most massive starless halo has a mass of 7 x 10^7 msun, which couldhost massive black hole formation through the direct gaseous collapse scenario.we show that the multiplicity of the population iii remnants grows with halomass above 10^8 msun, culminating in 50 remnants located in 10^9 msun halos onaverage. this has implications that high mass x-ray binaries and intermediatemass black holes that originate from metal-free stars may be abundant inhigh-redshift galaxies.

1306.0645	fully-coupled simulation of cosmic reionization. i: numerical methods  and tests	we describe an extension of the enzo code to enable fully-coupled radiationhydrodynamical simulation of inhomogeneous reionization in large $\sim (100mpc)^3$ cosmological volumes with thousands to millions of point sources. wesolve all dynamical, radiative transfer, thermal, and ionization processesself-consistently on the same mesh, as opposed to a postprocessing approachwhich coarse-grains the radiative transfer. we do, however, employ a simplesubgrid model for star formation which we calibrate to observations. radiationtransport is done in the grey flux-limited diffusion (fld) approximation, whichis solved by implicit time integration split off from the gas energy andionization equations, which are solved separately. this results in a faster andmore robust scheme for cosmological applications compared to the earliermethod. the fld equation is solved using the hypre optimally scalable geometricmultigrid solver from llnl. by treating the ionizing radiation as a grid fieldas opposed to rays, our method is scalable with respect to the number ofionizing sources, limited only by the parallel scaling properties of theradiation solver. we test the speed and accuracy of our approach on a number ofstandard verification and validation tests. we show by direct comparison withenzo's adaptive ray tracing method moray that the well-known inability of fldto cast a shadow behind opaque clouds has a minor effect on the evolution ofionized volume and mass fractions in a reionization simulation validation test.we illustrate an application of our method to the problem of inhomogeneousreionization in a 80 mpc comoving box resolved with $3200^3$ eulerian gridcells and dark matter particles.

0801.3698	the destruction of cosmological minihalos by primordial supernovae	we present numerical simulations of primordial supernovae in cosmologicalminihalos at $z \sim$ 20. we consider type ii supernovae, hypernovae, and pairinstability supernovae (pisn) in halos from 6.9 $\times$ 10$^5$ - 1.2 $\times$10$^7$ $\ms$, those in which population iii stars are expected to form viah$_2$ cooling. the supernovae evolve along two evolutionary paths according towhether they explode in \ion{h}{2} regions or neutral halos. those in\ion{h}{2} regions first expand adiabatically and then radiate strongly uponcollision with baryons ejected from the halo during its photoevaporation by theprogenitor. explosions in neutral halos promptly emit most of their kineticenergy as x-rays, but retain enough momentum to seriously disrupt the halo. wefind that the least energetic of the supernovae are capable of destroying halos$\lesssim$ 10$^7$ $\ms$, while a single pisn can destroy even more massivehalos. blasts in \ion{h}{2} regions disperse heavy elements into the igm, butneutral halos confine the explosion and its metals. in \ion{h}{2} regions, aprompt second generation of stars may form in the remnant at radii of 100 - 200pc in the halo. explosions confined by large halos instead recollapse, withinfall rates in excess of 10$^{-2}$ $\ms$ yr$^{-1}$ that heavily contaminatetheir interior. this fallback may either fuel massive black hole growth at veryhigh redshifts or create the first globular cluster with a radius of 10 - 20 pcat the center of the halo. our findings allow the possibility that the firstprimitive galaxies formed sooner, with greater numbers of stars and distinctchemical abundance patterns, than in current models.

1309.5926	a supersonic turbulence origin of larson's laws	we revisit the origin of larson's scaling laws describing the structure andkinematics of molecular clouds. our analysis is based on recent observationalmeasurements and data from a suite of six simulations of the interstellarmedium, including effects of self-gravity, turbulence, magnetic field, andmultiphase thermodynamics. simulations of isothermal supersonic turbulencereproduce observed slopes in linewidth-size and mass-size relations. whether ornot self-gravity is included, the linewidth-size relation remains the same. themass-size relation, instead, substantially flattens below the sonic scale, asprestellar cores start to form. our multiphase models with magnetic field anddomain size 200 pc reproduce both scaling and normalization of the first larsonlaw. the simulations support a turbulent interpretation of larson's relations.this interpretation implies that: (i) the slopes of linewidth-size andmass-size correlations are determined by the inertial cascade; (ii) none of thethree larson laws is fundamental; (iii) instead, if one is known, the other twofollow from scale invariance of the kinetic energy transfer rate. it does notimply that gravity is dynamically unimportant. the self-similarity of structureestablished by the turbulence breaks in star-forming clouds due to thedevelopment of gravitational instability in the vicinity of the sonic scale.the instability leads to the formation of prestellar cores with thecharacteristic mass set by the sonic scale. the high-end slope of the core massfunction predicted by the scaling relations is consistent with the salpeterpower-law index.

0801.4924	population iii star formation and imf	we review recent 3d cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of primordial starformation from cosmological initial conditions (pop iii.1) and from initialconditions that have been altered by radiative feedback from stellar sources(pop iii.2). we concentrate on simulations that resolve the formation of thegravitationally unstable cloud cores in mini-halos over the mass range $10^5 &lt;m/\msun &lt; 10^7 $ and follow their evolution to densities of at least $10^{10}\cmm3$ and length scales of $&lt;10^{-2}$ pc such that accretion rates can beestimated. the advent of ensembles of such simulations exploring a variety ofconditions permits us to assess the robustness of the standard model for popiii.1 star formation and investigate scatter in their formation redshifts andaccretion rates, thereby providing much needed information about the pop iiiimf. the simulations confirm the prediction that pop iii.1 stars were massive($\sim 100 \msun$), and form in isolation in primordial mini-halos. simulationsof pop iii.2 star forming in relic hii regions suggest somewhat lower masses($\sim 30 \msun$) which may help explain the chemical abundances of extremelymetal poor stars. we note that no 3d simulation at present has achieved stellardensity let alone followed the entire accretion history of the star in anyscenario, and thus the imf of pop iii stars remains poorly determinedtheoretically.

0806.1522	cosmological shocks in adaptive mesh refinement simulations and the  acceleration of cosmic rays	we present new results characterizing cosmological shocks within adaptivemesh refinement n-body/hydrodynamic simulations that are used to predictnon-thermal components of large-scale structure. this represents the firststudy of shocks using adaptive mesh refinement. we propose a modified algorithmfor finding shocks from those used on unigrid simulations that reduces theshock frequency of low mach number shocks by a factor of ~3. we then apply ournew technique to a large, (512 mpc/h)^3, cosmological volume and study theshock mach number (m) distribution as a function of pre-shock temperature,density, and redshift. because of the large volume of the simulation, we havesuperb statistics that results from having thousands of galaxy clusters. wefind that the mach number evolution can be interpreted as a method to visualizelarge-scale structure formation. shocks with mach&lt;5 typically trace mergers andcomplex flows, while 5&lt;mach&lt;20 and mach&gt;20 generally follow accretion ontofilaments and galaxy clusters, respectively. by applying results from nonlineardiffusive shock acceleration models using the first-order fermi process, wecalculate the amount of kinetic energy that is converted into cosmic rayprotons. the acceleration of cosmic ray protons is large enough that in orderto use galaxy clusters as cosmological probes, the dynamic response of the gasto the cosmic rays must be included in future numerical simulations.

0806.1653	three modes of metal-enriched star formation in the early universe	simulations of the formation of population iii (pop iii) stars suggest thatthey were much more massive than the pop ii and pop i stars observed today.this is due to the collapse dynamics of metal-free gas, which is regulated bythe radiative cooling of molecular hydrogen. we study how the collapse of gasclouds is altered by the addition of metals to the star-forming environment byperforming a series of simulations of pre-enriched star formation at variousmetallicities. for metallicities below the critical metallicity, z_cr, collapseproceeds similarly to the metal-free case, and only massive objects form. formetallicities well above z_cr, efficient cooling rapidly lowers the gastemperature to the temperature of the cmb. the gas is unable to radiativelycool below the cmb temperature, and becomes thermally stable. for highmetallicities, z &gt;= 10^-2.5 zsun, this occurs early in the evolution of the gascloud, when the density is still relatively low. the resulting cloud-cores showlittle or no fragmentation, and would most likely form massive stars. if themetallicity is not vastly above z_cr, the cloud cools efficiently but does notreach the cmb temperature, and fragmentation into multiple objects occurs. weconclude that there were three distinct modes of star formation at highredshift (z &gt;= 4): a `primordial' mode, producing massive stars (10s to 100smsun) at very low metallicities (z &lt;= 10^-3.75 zsun); a cmb-regulated mode,producing moderate mass (10s of msun) stars at high metallicites (z &gt;= 10^-2.5zsun at redshift z ~ 15-20); and a low-mass (a few msun) mode existing betweenthose two metallicities. as the universe ages and the cmb temperaturedecreases, the range of the low mass mode extends to higher metallicities,eventually becoming the only mode of star formation.

0808.0524	population iii supernovae and the assembly of the first galaxies	current numerical studies suggest that the first galaxies formed a few starsat a time and were enriched only gradually by the first heavy elements.however, the large box sizes in these models cannot resolve primordialsupernova explosions or the mixing of their metals with ambient gas, whichcould result in intervening, prompt generations of low-mass stars. we presentmultiscale 1d models of population iii supernovae in cosmological halos thatevolve the blast from its earliest stages as a free expansion. we find that ifthe star ionizes the halo, the ejecta strongly interacts with the dense shellswept up by the h ii region, potentially cooling and fragmenting it into clumpsthat are unstable to gravitational collapse. if the star fails to ionize thehalo, the explosion propagates metals out to 20 - 40 pc and then collapses,enriching tens of thousands of solar masses of primordial gas, in contrast toprevious models that suggest such explosions 'fizzle'. rapid formation oflow-mass stars trapped in the gravitational potential well of the halo appearsto be inevitable in such circumstances. consequently, it is possible that farmore stars were swept up into the first galaxies, at earlier times and withdistinct chemical signatures, than in present models. upcoming measurements byjwst and alma may discriminate between these two paradigms.

astro-ph;0002135	the formation and fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds	many questions in physical cosmology regarding the thermal history of theintergalactic medium, chemical enrichment, reionization, etc. are thought to beintimately related to the nature and evolution of pregalactic structure. inparticular the efficiency of primordial star formation and the primordial imfare of special interest. we present results from high resolutionthree--dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations that follow thecollapse of primordial molecular clouds and their subsequent fragmentationwithin a cosmologically representative volume. comoving scales from 128 kpcdown to 1 pc are followed accurately. dark matter dynamics, hydrodynamics andall relevant chemical and radiative processes (cooling) are followedself-consistently for a cluster normalized cdm structure formation model.primordial molecular clouds with ~10^5 solar masses are assembled by mergers ofmultiple objects that have formed hydrogen molecules in the gas phase with afractional abundance of ~10^-4. as the subclumps merge cooling lowers thetemperature to ~200 kelvin in a `cold pocket' at the center of the halo. withinthis cold pocket, a quasi-hydrostatically contracting core with ~200 solar massand number densities &gt; 10^5 cm^-3 is found. we find that less than 1% of theprimordial gas in such small scale structures cools and collapses tosufficiently high densities to be available for primordial star formation.furthermore, it is worthwhile to note that this study achieved the highestdynamic range covered by structured adaptive mesh techniques in cosmologicalhydrodynamics to date.

astro-ph;0112088	the formation of the first star in the universe	we describe results from a fully self-consistent three dimensionalhydrodynamical simulation of the formation of one of the first stars in theuniverse. dark matter dominated pre-galactic objects form because ofgravitational instability from small initidal density perturbations. as theyassemble via hierarchical merging, primordial gas cools through ro-vibrationallines of hydrogen molecules and sinks to the center of the dark matterpotential well. the high redshift analog of a molecular cloud is formed. whenthe dense, central parts of the cold gas cloud become self-gravitating, a densecore of approximately 100 solar mass undergoes rapid contraction. at densitiesn&gt;10^9 cm^-3 a one solar mass proto-stellar core becomes fully molecular due tothree-body h_2 formation. contrary to analytical expectations this process doesnot lead to renewed fragmentation and only one star is formed. the calculationis stopped when optical depth effects become important, leaving the final massof the fully formed star somewhat uncertain. at this stage the protostar isacreting material very rapidly (~0.01 solar masses per year). radiativefeedback from the star will not only halt its growth but also inhibit theformation of other stars in the same pre-galactic object (at least until thefirst star ends its life, presumably as a supernova). we conclude that at mostone massive (m &gt;&gt; 1 solar mass) metal free star forms per pre-galactic halo,consistent with recent abundance measurements of metal poor galactic halostars.

astro-ph;0212457	numerical simulations of high redshift star formation in dwarf galaxies	we present first results from three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations ofthe high redshift formation of dwarf galaxies. the simulations use an eulerianadaptive mesh refinement technique to follow the non-equilibrium chemistry ofhydrogen and helium with cosmological initial conditions drawn from a popularlambda-dominated cdm model. we include the effects of reionization using auniform radiation field, a phenomenological description of the effect of starformation and, in a separate simulation, the effects of stellar feedback. theresults highlight the effects of stellar feedback and photoionization on thebaryon content and star formation of galaxies with virial temperatures ofapproximately 10^4k. dwarf sized dark matter halos that assemble prior toreionization are able to form stars. most halos of similar mass that assembleafter reionization do not form stars by redshift of three. dwarf galaxies thatform stars show large variations in their gas content because of stellarfeedback and photoionization effects. baryon-to-dark matter mass ratios arefound to lie below the cosmic mean as a result of stellar feedback. thesupposed substructure problem of cdm is critically assessed on the basis ofthese results. the star formation histories modulated by radiative and stellarfeedbacks are discussed. in addition, metallicities of individual objects areshown to be naturally correlated with their mass-to-light ratios as is alsoevident in the properties of local dwarf galaxies.

astro-ph;0302427	formation of cool cores in galaxy clusters via hierarchical mergers	we present a new scenario for the formation of cool cores in rich galaxyclusters based on results from recent high spatial dynamic range, adaptive mesheulerian hydrodynamic simulations of large-scale structure formation. we findthat cores of cool gas, material that would be identified as a classicalcooling flow based on its x-ray luminosity excess and temperature profile, arebuilt from the accretion of discrete, stable subclusters. any ``cooling flow''present is overwhelmed by the velocity field within the cluster - the bulk flowof gas through the cluster typically has speeds up to about 2,000 km s^-1 andsignificant rotation is frequently present in the cluster core. the inclusionof consistent initial cosmological conditions for the cluster within itssurrounding supercluster environment is crucial when simulating the evolutionof cool cores in rich galaxy clusters. this new model for the hierarchicalassembly of cool gas naturally explains the high frequency of cool cores inrich galaxy clusters despite the fact that a majority of these clusters showevidence of substructure which is believed to arise from recent mergeractivity. furthermore, our simulations generate complex cluster cores inconcordance with recent x-ray observations of cool fronts, cool ``bullets'',and filaments in a number of galaxy clusters. our simulations were computedwith a coupled n-body, eulerian, adaptive mesh refinement, hydrodynamicscosmology code that properly treats the effects of shocks and radiative coolingby the gas. we employ up to seven levels of refinement to attain a peakresolution of 15.6 h^-1 kpc within a volume 256 h-1 mpc on a side and assume astandard lambdacdm cosmology.

astro-ph;0310758	did massive primordial stars preenrich the lyman alpha forest?	we examine the dynamical evolution and statistical properties of thesupernova ejecta of massive primordial stars in a cosmological framework todetermine whether this first population of stars could have enriched theuniverse to the levels and dispersions seen by the most recent observations ofthe lyman-alpha forest. we evolve a lambda cdm model in a 1 mpc^3 volume to aredshift of z = 15 and add ``bubbles'' of metal corresponding to the supernovaejecta of the first generation of massive stars in all dark matter halos withmasses greater than 5 times 10^5 solar masses. these initial conditions arethen evolved to z = 3 and the distribution and levels of metals are compared toobservations. in the absence of further star formation the primordial metal isinitially contained in halos and filaments. photoevaporation of metal-enrichedgas due to the metagalactic ultraviolet background radiation at the epoch ofreionization (z ~ 6) causes a sharp increase of the metal volume fillingfactor. at z = 3, ~ 2.5% of the simulation volume (approx. 20% of the total gasmass) is filled with gas enriched above a metallicity of 10^-4 z_solar, andless than 0.6% of the volume is enriched above a metallicity of 10^-3 z_solar.this suggests that, even with the most optimistic prescription for placement ofprimordial supernova and the amount of metals produced by each supernova, thispopulation of stars cannot entirely be responsible for the enrichment of thelyman-$\alpha$ forest to the levels and dispersions seen by currentobservations unless we have severely underestimated the duration of the pop iiiepoch. however, comparison to observations show that pop iii supernovae can besignificant contributors to the very low overdensity lyman-alpha forest.

astro-ph;0312651	comparing amr and sph cosmological simulations: i. dark matter &amp;  adiabatic simulations	we compare two cosmological hydrodynamic simulation codes in the context ofhierarchical galaxy formation: the sph code gadget, and the eulerian amr codeenzo. both codes represent dark matter with the n-body method, but usedifferent gravity solvers and fundamentally different approaches tohydrodynamics. we compare the gadget `entropy conserving' sph formulation withtwo enzo methods: the piecewise parabolic method (ppm), and the artificialviscosity-based scheme used in the zeus code. in this paper we focus on acomparison of cosmological simulations that follow either only dark matter, oralso adiabatic baryonic gas. the dark matter-only runs agree generally quitewell, provided enzo is run with a comparatively fine root grid and a lowoverdensity threshold for mesh refinement, otherwise the abundance of low-masshalos is suppressed. this is due to the hierarchical particle-mesh method usedto compute gravitational forces in enzo, which tends to deliver lower forceresolution than the tree algorithm of gadget. at comparable force resolution,we find that the latter offers substantially better performance and lowermemory consumption than the present gravity solver in enzo. in simulations thatinclude adiabatic gas dynamics, we find general agreement in the distributionfunctions of temperature, entropy, and density for gas of moderate to highoverdensity, as found inside dark matter halos. however, there are somesignificant differences at lower overdensities. we argue that thesediscrepancies are presumably owing to differences in the shock-capturingabilities of the different methods. in particular, zeus hydro leads to someunphysical heating at early times in preshock regions. overall, the gadgethydro results are bracketed by those for enzo/zeus and enzo/ppm.

astro-ph;0503330	forming a primordial star in a relic hii region	there has been considerable theoretical debate over whether photoionizationand supernova feedback from the first population iii stars facilitate orsuppress the formation of the next generation of stars. we present results froman eulerian adaptive mesh refinement simulation demonstrating the formation ofa primordial star within a region ionized by an earlier nearby star. despitethe higher temperatures of the ionized gas and its flow out of the dark matterpotential wells, this second star formed within 23 million years of itsneighbor's death. the enhanced electron fraction within the hii regioncatalyzes rapid molecular hydrogen formation that leads to faster cooling inthe subsequent star forming halos than in the first halos. this "secondgeneration" primordial protostar has a much lower accretion rate because,unlike the first protostar, it forms in a rotationally supported disk ofapprox. 10-100 solar masses. this is primarily due to the much higher angularmomentum of the halo in which the second star forms. in contrast to previouslypublished scenarios, such configurations may allow binaries or multiple systemsof lower mass stars to form. these first high resolution calculations offerinsight into the impact of feedback upon subsequent populations of stars andclearly demonstrate how primordial chemistry promotes the formation ofsubsequent generations of stars even in the presence of the entropy injected bythe first stars into the igm.

astro-ph;0509460	challenges for precision cosmology with x-ray and sunyaev-zeldovich  effect gas mass measurements of galaxy clusters	we critically analyze the measurement of galaxy cluster gas masses, which iscentral to cosmological studies that rely on the galaxy cluster gas massfraction. using synthetic observations of numerically simulated clusters viewedthrough their x-ray emission and thermal sunyaev-zeldovich effect (sze), wereduce the observations to obtain measurements of the cluster gas mass. we arethus able to quantify the possible sources of uncertainty and systematic biasassociated with the common simplifying assumptions used in reducing realcluster observations including isothermality and hydrostatic equilibrium. wefind that intrinsic variations in clusters limit the precision of observationalgas mass estimation to ~10% to 1 sigma confidence excluding instrumentaleffects. gas mass estimates performed via all methods surprisingly show littleor no trending in the scatter as a function of cluster redshift. for the fullcluster sample, methods that use sze profiles out to roughly the virial radiusare the simplest, most accurate, and unbiased way to estimate cluster mass.x-ray methods are systematically more precise mass estimators than are szemethods if merger and cool core systems are removed, but x-ray methods slightlyoverestimate (5-10%) the cluster gas mass on average. we find that cool coreclusters in our samples are particularly poor candidates for observational massestimation, even when excluding emission from the core region. the effects ofcooling in the cluster gas alter the radial profile of the x-ray and szesurface brightness outside the cool core region, leading to poor gas massestimates in cool core clusters. finally, we find that methods using auniversal temperature profile estimate cluster masses to higher precision thanthose assuming isothermality.

astro-ph;0602319	population iii star formation in a lambda wdm universe	in this paper we examine aspects of primordial star formation in a gravitinowarm dark matter universe with a cosmological constant. we compare a set ofsimulations using a single cosmological realization but with a wide range ofwarm dark matter particle masses which have not yet been conclusively ruled outby observations. the addition of a warm dark matter component to the initialpower spectrum results in a delay in the collapse of high density gas at thecenter of the most massive halo in the simulation and, as a result, an increasein the virial mass of this halo at the onset of baryon collapse. both of theseeffects become more pronounced as the warm dark matter particle mass becomessmaller. a cosmology using a gravitino warm dark matter power spectrum assuminga particle mass of m_{wdm} ~ 40kev is effectively indistinguishable from thecold dark matter case, whereas the m_{wdm} ~ 15 kev case delays star formationby approx. 10^8 years. there is remarkably little scatter between simulationsin the final properties of the primordial protostar which forms at the centerof the halo, possibly due to the overall low rate of halo mergers which is aresult of the wdm power spectrum. the detailed evolution of the collapsing halocore in two representative wdm cosmologies is described. at low densities(n_{b} &lt;= 10^5 cm^{-3}), the evolution of the two calculations is qualitativelysimilar, but occurs on significantly different timescales, with the halo in thelower particle mass calculation taking much longer to evolve over the samedensity range and reach runaway collapse. once the gas in the center of thehalo reaches relatively high densities (n_{b} &gt;= 10^5 cm^{-3}) the overallevolution is essentially identical in the two calculations.

(2003). we do, however, observe significant evolution inthe accretion rates of population iii protostars with redshift, with objectsthat form later having higher maximum accretion rates, with a variation of twoorders of magnitude (10^-4 - 10^-2 msolar/year). this can be explained byconsidering the evolving virial properties of the halos with redshift and thephysics of molecular hydrogen formation at low densities. our result impliesthat the mass distribution of population iii stars inferred from theiraccretion rates may be broader than previously thought, and may evolve withredshift. finally, we observe that our collapsing protostellar cloud cores donot fragment, consistent with previous results, which suggests that populationiii stars which form in halos of mass 10^5 - 10^6 msun always form inisolation.

astro-ph;0607028	can we trust the dust? evidence of dust segregation in molecular clouds	maps of estimated dust column density in molecular clouds are usually assumedto reliably trace the total gas column density structure. in this work wepresent results showing a clear discrepancy between the dust and the gasdistribution in the taurus molecular cloud complex. we compute the powerspectrum of a 2mass extinction map of the taurus region and find it is muchshallower than the power spectrum of a 13co map of the same region previouslyanalyzed. this discrepancy may be explained as the effect of grain growth onthe grain extinction efficiency. however, this would require a wide range ofmaximum grain sizes, which is ruled out based on constraints from theextinction curve and the available grain models. we show that major effects dueto co formation and depletion are also ruled out. our result may thereforesuggest the existence of intrinsic spatial fluctuations of the dust to gasratio, with amplitude increasing toward smaller scales. preliminary results ofnumerical simulations of trajectories of inertial particles in turbulent flowsillustrate how the process of clustering of dust grains by the cloud turbulencemay lead to observable effects. however, these results cannot be directlyapplied to large scale supersonic and magnetized turbulence at present.

astro-ph;0701795	two regimes of turbulent fragmentation and the stellar imf from  primordial to present day star formation	the padoan and nordlund model of the stellar initial mass function (imf) isderived from low order statistics of supersonic turbulence, neglecting gravity(e.g. gravitational fragmentation, accretion and merging). in this work thepredictions of that model are tested using the largest numerical experiments ofsupersonic hydrodynamic (hd) and magneto-hydrodynamic (mhd) turbulence to date(~1000^3 computational zones) and three different codes (enzo, zeus and thestagger code). the model predicts a power law distribution for large masses,related to the turbulence energy power spectrum slope, and the shock jumpconditions. this power law mass distribution is confirmed by the numericalexperiments. the model also predicts a sharp difference between the hd and mhdregimes, which is recovered in the experiments as well, implying that themagnetic field, even below energy equipartition on the large scale, is acrucial component of the process of turbulent fragmentation. these resultssuggest that the stellar imf of primordial stars may differ from that in laterepochs of star formation, due to differences in both gas temperature andmagnetic field strength. in particular, we find that the imf of primordialstars born in turbulent clouds may be narrowly peaked around a mass of order 10solar masses, as long as the column density of such clouds is not much inexcess of 10^22 cm^-2.

astro-ph;9601035	on the origin of strong magnetic fields in young supernova remnants	young supernova remnants such as tycho generally exhibit a bright circularclumpy shell in both radio and x-ray emission. for several young remnants,various arguments suggest that the magnetic field is larger than can beexplained by compression of a few $\mu g$ ambient magnetic field by the shockwave. radio polarization studies reveal a net radial orientation of magneticfields in the shell which cannot be explained by the simple compression either.we model rayleigh-taylor instability at the interface of the ejecta and theshocked ambient medium to explain these observations. we have performedmultidimensional mhd simulations of the instability in the shell of a type-isupernova remnant for the first time utilizing a moving grid technique whichallows us to follow the growth of the instability and its effect on the localmagnetic field in detail. we find that the evolution of the instability is verysensitive to the deceleration of the ejecta and the evolutionary stage of theremnant. as the reverse shock enters the inner uniform density region,chevalier's self-similar stage ends and the thickness of radio shell increasesand the instability weakens. our simulation shows that rayleigh-taylor andkelvin-helmholtz instabilities amplify ambient magnetic fields locally by asmuch as a factor of 60 around dense fingers due to stretching, winding, andcompression. globally, the amount of magnetic-field amplification is low andthe magnetic energy density reaches only about 0.3% of the turbulent energydensity at the end of simulation. strong magnetic field lines draped around thefingers produce the radial b-vector polarization, whereas thermalbremsstrahlung from the dense fingers themselves produce the clumpy x-rayemission. as a result, the x-ray emission peaks inside of the radio emission.

astro-ph;9606093	interaction of rayleigh-taylor fingers and circumstellar clodlets in  young supernova remnants	we discover a new dynamical mechanism that significantly enhances the growthof rayleigh-taylor fingers developed near the contact interface between thesupernova ejecta and swept-up ambient gas in young supernova remnants if thesupernova remnant expands into a clumpy (cloudy) circumstellar medium. ournumerical simulation demonstrates that large rayleigh-taylor fingers can obtaina sufficient terminal velocity to protrude through the forward shock front bytaking extra kinetic energy from vorticies generated by shock-cloudinteractions. we suggest this mechanism as a means to generate the asphericalexpansion of the supernova ejecta. ambient magnetic fields are stretched andamplified as the rayleigh-taylor fingers protrude, possibly leading to stronglyenhanced radio emission. the material in the protrusions originates from theejected stellar material with greatly enhanced heavy elements. therefore, itcan be a strong x-ray emitter. the timescale for the rayleigh-taylor fingers toreach the forward shock depends on the size, mass density and distribution ofclouds being engulfed by the supernova shock, although the details will requirefurther numerical investigation.

astro-ph;9606096	on the origin of radial magnetic fields in young supernova remnants	we study the radio emission from young supernova remnants by means of 3dnumerical mhd simulations of the rayleigh-taylor instability in the shell ofthe remnant. the computation is carried out in spherical polar coordinates ($r,\theta, \phi$) by using a moving grid technique which allows us to finelyresolve the shell. three-dimensional result shows more turbulent (complex)structures in the mixing region than the two-dimensional result, and theinstability is found to deform the reverse shock front. stokes parameters (i,q,and u) are computed to study the radio properties of the remnant. the totalintensity map shows two distinctive regions (inner and outer shells). the innershell appears to be complex and turbulent exhibiting loop structures and plumesas a result of the rayleigh-taylor instability, while the outer shell is faintand laminar due to the shocked uniform ambient magnetic fields. the inner shellresembles the observed radio structure in the main shell of young snrs, whichis evidence that the rayleigh-taylor instability is an ongoing process in youngsnrs. when only the peculiar components of the magnetic fields generated by theinstability are considered, the polarization b-vector in the inner radio shellis preferentially radial with about $20 \sim 50\%$ of fractional polarizationwhich is higher than the observed value. the fractional polarization is lowestin the turbulent inner shell and increases outward, which is attributed to thegeometric effect. the polarized intensity is found to be correlated with thetotal intensity. we demonstrate that the polarized intensity from the turbulentregion can dominate over the polarized intensity from the shocked uniformfields if the amplified field is sufficiently strong. therefore, we concludethat the rayleigh-taylor instability can explain the dominant radial magnetic

astro-ph;9810215	the formation and fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds	many questions in physical cosmology regarding the thermal history of theintergalactic medium, chemical enrichment, reionization, etc. are thought to beintimately related to the nature and evolution of pregalactic structure. inparticular the efficiency of primordial star formation and the primordial imfare of special interest. we present results from high resolutionthree-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations that follow the collapseof primordial molecular clouds and their subsequent fragmentation within acosmologically representative volume. comoving scales from 128 kpc down to 0.5pc are followed accurately. dark matter dynamics, hydrodynamics and allrelevant chemical and radiative processes (cooling) are followedself-consistently for a cluster normalized cdm structure formation model.primordial molecular clouds with ~100,000 solar masses are assembled by mergersof multiple objects that have formed hydrogen molecules in the gas phase with afractional abundance of &lt;~ 10^-4. as the subclumps merge cooling decreases thetemperature to ~200 kelvin in multiple "cold pockets" of the merger product.within these cold pockets, quasi-hydrostatically contracting cores with masses\~ 100 m_sun and number densities &gt; 100,000/cm^3 are found. we find that lessthan 1% of the primordial gas in such small scale structures cools andcollapses to sufficiently high densities to be available for primordial starformation. furthermore, our results indicate that the formation of very massiveobjects, massive black holes, fragmentation of a large fraction of baryons intobrown dwars or jupiter size fragments seems, in contrast to various claims inthe literature, very unlikely. the expected escape fraction of uv photons with(h nu) &gt; 11ev is very small.
