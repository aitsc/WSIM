0905.2920	cosmological radiative transfer comparison project ii: the  radiation-hydrodynamic tests	the development of radiation hydrodynamical methods that are able to followgas dynamics and radiative transfer self-consistently is key to the solution ofmany problems in numerical astrophysics. such fluid flows are highly complex,rarely allowing even for approximate analytical solutions against whichnumerical codes can be tested. an alternative validation procedure is tocompare different methods against each other on common problems, in order toassess the robustness of the results and establish a range of validity for themethods. previously, we presented such a comparison for a set of pure radiativetransfer tests (i.e. for fixed, non-evolving density fields). this is thesecond paper of the cosmological radiative transfer (rt) comparison project, inwhich we compare 9 independent rt codes directly coupled to gasdynamics on 3relatively simple astrophysical hydrodynamics problems: (5) the expansion of anh ii region in a uniform medium; (6) an ionization front (i-front) in a 1/r^2density profile with a flat core, and (7), the photoevaporation of a uniformdense clump. results show a broad agreement between the different methods andno big failures, indicating that the participating codes have reached a certainlevel of maturity and reliability. however, many details still do differ, andvirtually every code has showed some shortcomings and has disagreed, in onerespect or another, with the majority of the results. this underscores the factthat no method is universal and all require careful testing of the particularfeatures which are most relevant to the specific problem at hand.

0906.0511	analysis of methods for detecting the proximity effect in quasar spectra	using numerical simulations of structure formation, we investigate multiplemethods of determining the strength of the proximity effect in the hi lyalphaforest. we analyze three high resolution (~10kpc) redshift snapshots(z=4,3,2.25) of a hydro-particle-mesh simulation to obtain realistic absorptionspectra of the hi lyalpha forest. we begin our analysis investigating theintrinsic biases thought to arise in the widely adopted standard technique ofcombining multiple lines of sight when searching for the proximity effect. weconfirm the existence of this biases. we then concentrate on the analysis ofthe proximity effect along individual lines of sight. we construct theproximity effect strength distribution (pesd) and confirm that the pesdinferred from a simple averaging technique accurately recovers the inputstrength of the proximity effect at all redshifts. moreover, the pesd closelyfollows the behaviors found in observed samples of quasar spectra. however, thepesd obtained from our new simulated sight lines presents some differences tothat of simple monte carlo simulations. after developing three new theoreticalmethods of recovering the strength of the proximity effect on individual linesof sight, we compare their accuracy to the pesd from the simple averagingtechnique. all our new approaches are based on the maximization of thelikelihood function, albeit invoking some modifications. the new techniquespresented here fail to recover the input proximity effect in an un-biased way.thus, employing complex 3d simulations, we provide strong evidence in favor ofthe proximity effect strength distribution obtained from the simple averagingtechnique, as method of estimating the uv background intensity, free of anybiases.

0707.0879	escape of ionizing radiation from high redshift galaxies	we model the escape of ionizing radiation from high-redshift galaxies usinghigh-resolution adaptive mesh refinement n-body + hydrodynamics simulations.our simulations include time-dependent and spatially-resolved transfer ofionizing radiation in three dimensions, including effects of dust absorption.for galaxies of total mass m &gt; 10^11 msun and star formation rates sfr ~ 1-5msun/yr, we find angular averaged escape fractions of 0.01-0.03 over the entireredshift interval studied (3&lt;z&lt;9). in addition, we find that the escapefraction varies by more than an order of magnitude along differentlines-of-sight within individual galaxies, from the largest values neargalactic poles to the smallest along the galactic disk. the escape fractiondeclines steeply at lower masses and sfr. we show that the low values of escapefractions are due to a small fraction of young stars located just outside theedge of hi disk. we compare our predicted escape fraction of ionizing photonswith previous results, and find a general agreement with both other simulationresults and available direct detection measurements at z ~ 3. we also compareour simulations with a novel method to estimate the escape fraction in galaxiesfrom the observed distribution of neutral hydrogen column densities along thelines of sights to long duration gamma-ray bursts. using this method we findescape fractions of the grb host galaxies of 2-3%, consistent with ourtheoretical predictions.

0909.0513	computational eulerian hydrodynamics and galilean invariance	eulerian hydrodynamical simulations are a powerful and popular tool formodeling fluids in astrophysical systems. in this work, we critically examinerecent claims that these methods violate galilean invariance of the eulerequations. we demonstrate that eulerian hydrodynamics methods do converge to agalilean-invariant solution, provided a well-defined convergent solutionexists. specifically, we show that numerical diffusion, resulting fromdiffusion-like terms in the discretized hydrodynamical equations solved byeulerian methods, accounts for the effects previously identified as evidencefor the galilean non-invariance of these methods. these velocity-dependentdiffusive terms lead to different results for different bulk velocities whenthe spatial resolution of the simulation is kept fixed, but their effectbecomes negligible as the resolution of the simulation is increased to obtain aconverged solution. in particular, we find that kelvin-helmholtz instabilitiesdevelop properly in realistic eulerian calculations regardless of the bulkvelocity provided the problem is simulated with sufficient resolution (a factorof 2-4 increase compared to the case without bulk flows for realisticvelocities). our results reiterate that high-resolution eulerian methods canperform well and obtain a convergent solution, even in the presence of highlysupersonic bulk flows.

0707.2594	a new constraint on the escape fraction in distant galaxies using  gamma-ray burst afterglow spectroscopy	we describe a new method to measure the escape fraction fesc of ionizingradiation from distant star-forming galaxies using the afterglow spectra oflong-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs). optical spectra of grb afterglows allowus to evaluate the optical depth of the host ism, according to the neutralhydrogen column density n(hi) observed along the sightlines toward thestar-forming regions where the grbs are found. different from previous effortin searching for faint, transmitted lyman continuum photons, our method is notsubject to background subtraction uncertainties and does not require priorknowledge of either the spectral shape of the host galaxy population or the igmlya forest absorption along these grb sightlines. because most grbs occur insub-l_* galaxies, our study also offers the first constraint on fesc fordistant low-mass galaxies that dominate the cosmic luminosity density. we havecompiled a sample of 27 grbs at redshift z&gt;2 for which the underlying n(hi) inthe host ism are known. these grbs together offer a statistical sampling of theintegrated optical depth to ionizing photons along random sightlines fromstar-forming regions in the host galaxies, and allow us to estimate the meanescape fraction &lt;fesc&gt; averaged over different viewing angles. we find&lt;fesc&gt;=0.02\pm 0.02 and place a 95% c.l. upper limit &lt;fesc&gt; &lt;= 0.075 for thesehosts. we discuss possible biases of our approach and implications of theresult. finally, we propose to extend this technique for measuring &lt;fesc&gt; atz~0.2 using spectra of core-collapse supernovae.

0912.3005	on the kennicutt-schmidt relation of low-metallicity high-redshift  galaxies	we present results of self-consistent, high-resolution cosmologicalsimulations of galaxy formation at z~3. the simulations employ recentlydeveloped recipe for star formation based on the local abundance of molecularhydrogen, which is tracked self-consistently during the course of simulation.the phenomenological h2 formation model accounts for the effects ofdissociating uv radiation of stars in each galaxy, as well as self-shieldingand shielding of h2 by dust, and therefore allows us to explore effects oflower metallicities and higher uv fluxes prevalent in high redshift galaxies ontheir star formation. we compare stellar masses, metallicities, and starformation rates of the simulated galaxies to available observations of thelyman break galaxies (lbgs) and find a reasonable agreement. we find that thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation exhibited by our simulated galaxies at z~3 issubstantially steeper and has a lower amplitude than the z=0 relation atsigma_gas &lt; 100 msun/pc^2. the predicted relation, however, is consistent withexisting observational constraints for the z~3 damped lyman $\alpha$ (dla) andlbgs. our tests show that the main reason for the difference from the local ksrelation is lower metallicity of the ism in high redshift galaxies. we discussseveral implications of the metallicity-dependence of the ks relation forgalaxy evolution and interpretation of observations.

1004.0003	environmental dependence of the kennicutt-schmidt relation in galaxies	we present a detailed description of a phenomenological h2 formation modeland local star formation prescription based on the density of molecular (ratherthan total) gas. such approach allows us to avoid the arbitrary density andtemperature thresholds typically used in star formation recipes. we presentresults of the model based on realistic cosmological simulations of high-zgalaxy formation for a grid of numerical models with varied dust-to-gas ratiosand interstellar far uv (fuv) fluxes. our results show that both theatomic-to-molecular transition on small, ~10 pc scales and thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation on ~kpc scales are sensititive to thedust-to-gas ratio and the fuv flux. the atomic-to-molecular transition as afunction of gas density or column density has a large scatter but is rathersharp and shifts to higher densities with decreasing dust-to-gas ratio and/orincreasing fuv flux. consequently, star formation is concentrated to higher gassurface density regions, resulting in steeper slope and lower amplitude of theks relation at a given gas surface density, in less dusty and/or higher fuvflux environments. these trends should have a particularly strong effect on theevolution of low-mass, low surface brightness galaxies which typically have lowdust content and anemic star formation, but are also likely to be important forevolution of the milky way-sized systems. we parameterize the dependenciesobserved in our simulations in convenient fitting formulae, which can be usedto model the dependence of the ks relation on the dust-to-gas ratio and fuvflux in semi-analytic models and in cosmological simulations that do notinclude radiative transfer and h2 formation.

1004.3785	measuring gas accretion and angular momentum near simulated supermassive  black holes	using cosmological simulations with a dynamic range in excess of 10 million,we study the transport of gas mass and angular momentum through thecircumnuclear region of a disk galaxy containing a supermassive black hole(smbh). the simulations follow fueling over relatively quiescent phases of thegalaxy's evolution (no mergers) and without feedback from active galacticnuclei (agns), as part of the first stage of using state-of-the-art,high-resolution cosmological simulations to model galaxy and black holeco-evolution. we present results from simulations at different redshifts (z=6,4, and 3) and three different black hole masses (30 million, 90 million, and300 million solar masses; at z=4), as well as a simulation including aprescription that approximates optically thick cooling in the densest regions.the interior gas mass throughout the circumnuclear disk shows transient andchaotic behavior as a function of time. the fourier transform of the interiorgas mass follows a power law with slope -1 throughout the region, indicatingthat, in the absence of the effects of galaxy mergers and agn feedback, massfluctuations are stochastic with no preferred timescale for accretion over theduration of each simulation (~ 1-2 myr). the angular momentum of the gas diskchanges direction relative to the disk on kiloparsec scales over timescalesless than 1 myr, reflecting the chaotic and transient gas dynamics of thecircumnuclear region. infalling clumps of gas, which are driven inward as aresult of the dynamical state of the circumnuclear disk, may play an importantrole in determining the spin evolution of an smbh, as has been suggested instochastic accretion scenarios.

1011.4065	a comparison of methods for determining the molecular content of model  galaxies	recent observations indicate that star formation occurs only in the molecularphase of a galaxy's interstellar medium. a realistic treatment of starformation in simulations and analytic models of galaxies therefore requiresthat one determine where the transition from the atomic to molecular gasoccurs. in this paper we compare two methods for making this determination incosmological simulations where the internal structures of molecular clouds areunresolved: a complex time-dependent chemistry network coupled to a radiativetransfer calculation of the dissociating ultraviolet (uv) radiation field, anda simple time-independent analytic approximation. we show that these twomethods produce excellent agreement at all metallicities &gt;~10^-2 of the milkyway value across a very wide range of uv fields. at lower metallicities theagreement is worse, likely because time-dependent effects become important;however, there are no observational calibrations of molecular gas content atsuch low metallicities, so it is unclear if either method is accurate. thecomparison suggests that, in many but not all applications, the analyticapproximation provides a viable and nearly cost-free alternative to fulltime-dependent chemistry and radiative transfer.

1108.5176	simulations of early baryonic structure formation with stream velocity:  i. halo abundance	it has been recently shown that the relative velocity between the dark matterand the baryons (vbc) at the time of recombination can affect the structureformation in the early universe (tseliakhovich &amp; hirata 2010). we statisticallyquantify this effect using large cosmological simulations. we use threedifferent high resolution sets of simulations (with separate transfer functionsfor baryons and dark matter) that vary in box size, particle number, and thevalue of the relative velocity between dark matter and baryons. we show thatthe total number density of halos is suppressed by ~ 20% at z = 25 for vbc =1{\sigma}(vbc), where {\sigma}(vbc) is the variance of the relative velocity,while for vbc = 3.4{\sigma}(vbc) the relative suppression at the same redshiftreaches 50%, remaining at or above the 30% level all the way to z = 11. we alsofind high abundance of "empty halos", i.e., halos that have gas fraction belowhalf of the cosmic mean baryonic fraction fb. specifically we find that for vbc= 1{\sigma}(vbc) all halos below 10^5m\odot are empty at z \geq 19. the highabundance of empty halos results in significant delay in the formation of gasrich mini-halos and the first galaxies.

1108.5384	the impact of baryon physics on the structure of high-redshift galaxies	we study the detailed structure of galaxies at redshifts z &gt; 2 usingcosmological simulations with improved modeling of the interstellar medium andstar formation. the simulations follow the formation and dissociation ofmolecular hydrogen, and include star formation only in cold molecular gas. themolecular gas is more concentrated towards the center of galaxies than theatomic gas, and as a consequence, the resulting stellar distribution is verycompact. for halos with total mass above 10^{11} mo, the median half-massradius of the stellar disks is 0.8 kpc at z = 3. the vertical structure of themolecular disk is much thinner than that of the atomic neutral gas. relative tothe non-radiative run, the inner regions of the dark matter halo change shapefrom prolate to mildly oblate and align with the stellar disk. however, we donot find evidence for a significant dark disk of dark matter around the stellardisk. the outer halo regions retain the orientation acquired during accretionand mergers, and are significantly misaligned with the inner regions. theradial profile of the dark matter halo contracts in response to baryondissipation, establishing an approximately isothermal profile throughout mostof the halo. this effect can be accurately described by a modified model ofhalo contraction. the angular momentum of a fixed amount of inner dark matteris approximately conserved over time, while in the dissipationless case most ofit is transferred outward during mergers. the conservation of the dark matterangular momentum provides supporting evidence for the validity of the halocontraction model in a hierarchical galaxy formation process.

1108.5731	ultra-faint dwarf galaxies as a test of early enrichment and  metallicity-dependent star formation	the tight relation of star formation with molecular gas indicated byobservations and assumed in recent models implies that the efficiency withwhich galaxies convert their gas into stars depends on gas metallicity. this isbecause the abundance of molecular hydrogen is sensitive to the abundance ofdust, which catalyzes the formation of h_2 and helps to shield it fromdissociating radiation. in this study we point out that in the absence ofsignificant pre-enrichment by population iii stars forming out of zerometallicity gas, such h_2-based star formation is expected to leave an imprintin the form of bi-modality in the metallicity distribution among dwarf galaxiesand in the metallicity distribution of stars within individual galaxies. thebi-modality arises because when gas metallicity (and dust abundance) is low,formation of molecular gas is inefficient, the gas consumption time scale islong, and star formation and metal enrichment proceed slowly. when metallicityreaches a critical threshold value star formation and enrichment accelerate,which leads to rapid increase in both stellar mass and metallicity of galaxies.we demonstrate this process both using a simple analytical model and fullcosmological simulations. in contrast, observed metallicity distributions ofdwarf galaxies or stars within them are not bi-modal. we argue that thisdiscrepancy points to substantial early stochastic pre-enrichment by populationiii stars to levels z ~ 0.01 z_sun in dense, star forming regions of earlygalaxies.

1108.5736	halo contraction effect in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation	the condensation of gas and stars in the inner regions of dark matter halosleads to a more concentrated dark matter distribution. while this effect isbased on simple gravitational physics, the question of its validity inhierarchical galaxy formation has led to an active debate in the literature. weuse a collection of several state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamicsimulations to study the halo contraction effect in systems ranging from dwarfgalaxies to clusters of galaxies, at high and low redshift. the simulations arerun by different groups with different codes and include hierarchical merging,gas cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback. we show that in all ourcases the inner dark matter density increases relative to the matchingsimulation without baryon dissipation, at least by a factor of several. thestrength of the contraction effect varies from system to system and cannot bereduced to a simple prescription. we present a revised analytical model thatdescribes the contracted mass profile to an rms accuracy of about 10%. themodel can be used to effectively bracket the response of the dark matter haloto baryon dissipation. the halo contraction effect is real and must be includedin modeling of the mass distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.

1111.6599	non-thermal dark matter mimicking an additional neutrino species in the  early universe	the south pole telescope (spt), atacama cosmology telescope (act), andwilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) have each reported measurements ofthe cosmic microwave background's (cmb) angular power spectrum which favor theexistence of roughly one additional neutrino species, in addition to the threecontained in the standard model of particle physics. neutrinos influence thecmb by contributing to the radiation density, which alters the expansion rateof the universe during the epoch leading up to recombination. in this paper, weconsider an alternative possibility that the excess kinetic energy implied bythese measurements was possessed by dark matter particles that were producedthrough a non-thermal mechanism, such as late-time decays. in particular, wefind that if a small fraction (&lt;1%) of the dark matter in the universe todaywere produced through the decays of a heavy and relatively long-lived state,the expansion history of the universe can be indistinguishable from thatpredicted in the standard cosmological model with an additional neutrino.furthermore, if these decays take place after the completion of big bangnucleosynthesis, this scenario can avoid tension with the value of threeneutrino species preferred by measurements of the light element abundances.

1112.1732	the x-factor in galaxies: i. dependence on environment and scale	characterizing the conversion factor between co emission and column densityof molecular hydrogen, x_co, is crucial in studying the gaseous content ofgalaxies, its evolution, and relation to star formation. in most cases theconversion factor is assumed to be close to that of giant molecular clouds(gmcs) in the milky way, except possibly for mergers and star-burstinggalaxies. however, there are physical grounds to expect that it should alsodepend on the gas metallicity, surface density, and strength of theinterstellar radiation field. the xco factor may also depend on the scale onwhich co emission is averaged due to effects of limited resolution. we studythe dependence of x_co on gas properties and averaging scale using a model thatis based on a combination of results of sub-pc scale magneto-hydrodynamicsimulations and on the gas distribution from self-consistent cosmologicalsimulations of galaxy formation. our model predicts a value of x_co that isconsistent with the galactic value for interstellar medium conditions typicalfor the milky way. for such conditions the predicted x_co varies by only afactor of two for gas surfaced densities in the range \sim 50 - 500 m_sun /pc^2. however, the model also predicts that more generally on the scale ofgmcs, x_co is a strong function of metallicity, and depends on the columndensity and the interstellar uv flux. we show explicitly that neglecting thesedependencies in observational estimates can strongly bias the inferreddistribution of h2 column densities of molecular clouds to have a narrower andoffset range compared to the true distribution. we find that when averaged on\sim kpc scales the x-factor depends only weakly on radiation field and columndensity, but is still a strong function of metallicity. the predictedmetallicity dependence can be approximated as x_co \sim z^{-{\gamma}} with{\gamma} ~ 0.5 - 0.8.

1201.3653	on the origin of the high column density turnover in the hi column  density distribution	we study the high column density regime of the hi column density distributionfunction and argue that there are two distinct features: a turnover at nhi ~10^21 cm^-2 which is present at both z=0 and z ~ 3, and a lack of systems abovenhi ~ 10^22 cm^-2 at z=0. using observations of the column densitydistribution, we argue that the hi-h2 transition does not cause the turnover atnhi ~ 10^21 cm^-2, but can plausibly explain the turnover at nhi &gt; 10^22 cm^-2.we compute the hi column density distribution of individual galaxies in thethings sample and show that the turnover column density depends only weakly onmetallicity. furthermore, we show that the column density distribution ofgalaxies, corrected for inclination, is insensitive to the resolution of the himap or to averaging in radial shells. our results indicate that the similarityof hi column density distributions at z=3 and z=0 is due to the similarity ofthe maximum hi surface densities of high-z and low-z disks, set presumably byuniversal processes that shape properties of the gaseous disks of galaxies.using fully cosmological simulations, we explore other candidate physicalmechanisms that could produce a turnover in the column density distribution. weshow that while turbulence within gmcs cannot affect the dla column densitydistribution, stellar feedback can affect it significantly if the feedback issufficiently effective in removing gas from the central 2-3 kpc ofhigh-redshift galaxies. finally, we argue that it is meaningful to comparecolumn densities averaged over ~ kpc scales with those estimated from quasarspectra which probe sub-pc scales due to the steep power spectrum of hi columndensity fluctuations observed in nearby galaxies.

1201.5116	cooling and heating functions of photoionized gas	cooling and heating functions of cosmic gas are a crucial ingredient for anystudy of gas dynamics and thermodynamics in the interstellar and intergalacticmedium. as such, they have been studied extensively in the past under theassumption of collisional ionization equilibrium. however, for a wide range ofapplications, the local radiation field introduces a non-negligible, oftendominant, modification to the cooling and heating functions. in the mostgeneral case, these modifications cannot be described in simple terms, andwould require a detailed calculation with a large set of chemical species usinga radiative transfer code (the well-known code cloudy, for example). we show,however, that for a sufficiently general variation in the spectral shape andintensity of the incident radiation field, the cooling and heating functionscan be approximated as depending only on several photoionization rates, whichcan be thought of as representative samples of the overall radiation field.this dependence is easy to tabulate and implement in cosmological orgalactic-scale simulations, thus economically accounting for an important butrarely-included factor in the evolution of cosmic gas. we also show a fewexamples where the radiation environment has a large effect, the mostspectacular of which is a quasar that suppresses gas cooling in its host halowithout any mechanical or non-radiative thermal feedback.

1204.3910	the x-factor in galaxies: ii. the molecular hydrogen -- star formation  relation	there is ample observational evidence that the star formation rate (sfr)surface density, sigma_sfr, is closely correlated with the surface density ofmolecular hydrogen, sigma_h2. this empirical relation holds both forgalaxy-wide averages and for individual &gt;=kpc sized patches of the interstellarmedium (ism), but appears to degrade substantially at a sub-kpc scale.identifying the physical mechanisms that determine the scale-dependentproperties of the observed sigma_h2-sigma_sfr relation remains a challenge froma theoretical perspective. to address this question, we analyze the slope andscatter of the sigma_h2-sigma_sfr relation using a set of cosmological, galaxyformation simulations with a peak resolution of ~100 pc. these simulationsinclude a chemical network for molecular hydrogen, a model for the co emission,and a simple, stochastic prescription for star formation that operates on ~100pc scales. specifically, star formation is modeled as a poisson process inwhich the average sfr is directly proportional to the present mass of h2. thepredictions of our numerical model are in good agreement with the observedkennicutt-schmidt and sigma_h2-sigma_sfr relations. we show that observationsbased on co emission are ill suited to reliably measure the slope of the latterrelation at low (&lt;20 m_sun pc^-2) h2 surface densities on sub-kpc scales. ourmodels also predict that the inferred sigma_h2-sigma_sfr relation steepens athigh h2 surface densities as a result of the surface density dependence of theco/h2 conversion factor. finally, we show that on sub-kpc scales most of thescatter in the relation is a consequence of discreteness effects in the starformation process. in contrast, variations of the co/h2 conversion factor areresponsible for most of the scatter measured on super-kpc scales.

1207.5515	simulations of early baryonic structure formation with stream velocity:  ii. the gas fraction	understanding the gas content of high redshift halos is crucial for studyingthe formation of the first generation of galaxies and reionization. recently,tseliakhovich &amp; hirata showed that the relative "stream" velocity between thedark matter and baryons at the time of recombination - formally a second ordereffect, but an unusually large one - can influence the later structureformation history of the universe. we quantify the effect of the streamvelocity on the so-called "characteristic mass" - the minimum mass of a darkmatter halo capable of retaining most of its baryons throughout its formationepoch - using three different high-resolution sets of cosmological simulations(with separate transfer functions for baryons and dark matter) that vary in boxsize, particle number, and the value of the relative velocity between the darkmatter and baryons. in order to understand this effect theoretically, wegeneralize the linear theory filtering mass to properly account for thedifference between the dark matter and baryonic density fluctuation evolutioninduced by the stream velocity. we show that the new filtering mass provides anaccurate estimate for the characteristic mass, while other theoretical ansatzesfor the characteristic mass are substantially less precise.

1208.4604	the relation between mid-plane pressure and molecular hydrogen in  galaxies: environmental dependence	molecular hydrogen (h2) is the primary component of the reservoirs of cold,dense gas that fuel star formation in our galaxy. while the h2 abundance isultimately regulated by physical processes operating on small scales in theinterstellar medium (ism), observations have revealed a tight correlationbetween the ratio of molecular to atomic hydrogen in nearby spiral galaxies andthe pressure in the mid-plane of their disks. this empirical relation has beenused to predict h2 abundances in galaxies with potentially very different ismconditions, such as metal-deficient galaxies at high redshifts. here, we testthe validity of this approach by studying the dependence of the pressure -- h2relation on environmental parameters of the ism. to this end, we follow theformation and destruction of h2 explicitly in a suite of hydrodynamicalsimulations of galaxies with different ism parameters. we find that a pressure-- h2 relation arises naturally in our simulations for a variety of dust-to-gasratios or strengths of the interstellar radiation field in the ism. fixing thedust-to-gas ratio and the uv radiation field to values measured in the solarneighborhood results in fair agreement with the relation observed in nearbygalaxies with roughly solar metallicity. however, the parameters (slope andnormalization) of the pressure -- h2 relation vary in a systematical way withism properties. a particularly strong trend is the decrease of thenormalization of the relation with a lowering of the dust-to-gas ratio of theism. we show that this trend and other properties of the pressure -- h2relation are natural consequences of the transition from atomic to molecularhydrogen with gas surface density.

1210.4957	towards a complete accounting of energy and momentum from stellar  feedback in galaxy formation simulations	stellar feedback plays a key role in galaxy formation by regulating starformation, driving interstellar turbulence and generating galactic scaleoutflows. although modern simulations of galaxy formation can resolve scales of10-100 pc, star formation and feedback operate on smaller, "subgrid" scales.great care should therefore be taken in order to properly account for theeffect of feedback on global galaxy evolution. we investigate the momentum andenergy budget of feedback during different stages of stellar evolution, andstudy its impact on the interstellar medium using simulations of local starforming regions and galactic disks at the resolution affordable in moderncosmological zoom-in simulations. in particular, we present a novel subgridmodel for the momentum injection due to radiation pressure and stellar windsfrom massive stars during early, pre-supernova evolutionary stages of youngstar clusters. early injection of momentum acts to clear out dense gas in starforming regions, hence limiting star formation. the reduced gas densitymitigates radiative losses of thermal feedback energy from subsequent supernovaexplosions, leading to an increased overall efficiency of stellar feedback. thedetailed impact of stellar feedback depends sensitively on the implementationand choice of parameters. somewhat encouragingly, we find that implementationsin which feedback is efficient lead to approximate self-regulation of globalstar formation efficiency. we compare simulation results using our feedbackimplementation to other phenomenological feedback methods, where thermalfeedback energy is allowed to dissipate over time scales longer than the formalgas cooling time. we find that simulations with maximal momentum injectionsuppress star formation to a similar degree as is found in simulations adoptingadiabatic thermal feedback.

1301.2605	satellites in mw-like hosts: environment dependence and close pairs	previous studies showed that an estimate of the likelihood distribution ofthe milky way halo mass can be derived using the properties of the satellitessimilar to the large and small magellanic clouds (lmc and smc). however, itwould be straightforward to interpret such an estimate only if the propertiesof the magellanic clouds (mcs) are fairly typical and are not biased by theenvironment. in this study we explore whether the environment of the milky wayaffects the properties of the smc and lmc such as their velocities. to test forthe effect of the environment, we compare velocity distributions for mc-sizedsubhalos around milky way hosts in a sample selected simply by mass and in thesecond sample of such halos selected with additional restrictions on thedistance to the nearest cluster and the local galaxy density, designed to mimicthe environment of the local group (lg). we find that satellites in halos inthe lg-like environments do have somewhat larger velocities, as compared to thehalos of similar mass in the sample without environmental constraints. wederive the host halo likelihood distribution for the samples in the lg-likeenvirionment and in the control sample and find that the environment does notsignificantly affect the derived likelihood. we use the updated properties ofthe smc and lmc to derive the constraint on the mw halo mass $\log{({\rmm}_{200} /\msol)}=12.06^{+0.31}_{-0.19}$ (90% confidence interval). we alsoexplore the incidence of close pairs with relative velocities and separationssimilar to those of the lmc and smc and find that such pairs are quite rareamong $\lambda$cdm halos. taking into account the close separation of the mcsin the busha et al.\ 2011 method results in the shift of the mw halo massestimate to smaller masses, with the peak shifting approximately by a factor oftwo.[abridged]

1308.2669	the agora high-resolution galaxy simulations comparison project	we introduce the agora project, a comprehensive numerical study ofwell-resolved galaxies within the lcdm cosmology. cosmological hydrodynamicsimulations with force resolutions of ~100 proper pc or better will be run witha variety of code platforms to follow the hierarchical growth, star formationhistory, morphological transformation, and the cycle of baryons in and out of 8galaxies with halo masses m_vir ~= 1e10, 1e11, 1e12, and 1e13 msun at z=0 andtwo different ("violent" and "quiescent") assembly histories. the numericaltechniques and implementations used in this project include the smoothedparticle hydrodynamics codes gadget and gasoline, and the adaptive meshrefinement codes art, enzo, and ramses. the codes will share common initialconditions and common astrophysics packages including uv background,metal-dependent radiative cooling, metal and energy yields of supernovae, andstellar initial mass function. these are described in detail in the presentpaper. subgrid star formation and feedback prescriptions will be tuned toprovide a realistic interstellar and circumgalactic medium using anon-cosmological disk galaxy simulation. cosmological runs will besystematically compared with each other using a common analysis toolkit, andvalidated against observations to verify that the solutions are robust - i.e.,that the astrophysical assumptions are responsible for any success, rather thanartifacts of particular implementations. the goals of the agora project are,broadly speaking, to raise the realism and predictive power of galaxysimulations and the understanding of the feedback processes that regulategalaxy "metabolism." the proof-of-concept dark matter-only test of theformation of a galactic halo with a z=0 mass of m_vir ~= 1.7e11 msun by 9different versions of the participating codes is also presented to validate theinfrastructure of the project.

1308.4974	simulations of disk galaxies with cosmic ray driven galactic winds	we present results from high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of isolatedsmc- and milky way-sized galaxies that include a model for feedback fromgalactic cosmic rays (crs). we find that crs are naturally able to drive windswith mass loading factors of up to ~10 in dwarf systems. the scaling of themass loading factor with circular velocity between the two simulated systems isconsistent with \propto v_c^{1-2} required to reproduce the faint end of thegalaxy luminosity function. in addition, simulations with cr feedback reproduceboth the normalization and the slope of the observed trend of wind velocitywith galaxy circular velocity. we find that winds in simulations with crfeedback exhibit qualitatively different properties compared to sn drivenwinds, where most of the acceleration happens violently in situ near starforming sites. in contrast, the cr-driven winds are accelerated gently by thelarge-scale pressure gradient established by crs diffusing from thestar-forming galaxy disk out into the halo. the cr-driven winds also exhibitmuch cooler temperatures and, in the smc-sized system, warm (t~10^4 k) gasdominates the outflow. the prevalence of warm gas in such outflows may providea clue as to the origin of ubiquitous warm gas in the gaseous halos of galaxiesdetected via absorption lines in quasar spectra.

1312.2587	on the mass of the local group	we use recent proper motion measurements of the tangential velocity of m31,along with its radial velocity and distance, to derive the likelihood of thesum of halo masses of the milky way and m31. this is done using a sample halopairs in the bolshoi cosmological simulation of $\lambda$cdm cosmology selectedto match properties and environment of the local group. the resultinglikelihood gives estimate of the sum of masses of $m_{\rm mw,200}+m_{\rmm31,200}=$ $2.40_{-1.05}^{+1.95}\times10^{12}\,m_{\odot}$ ($90\%$ confidenceinterval). this estimate is consistent with individual mass estimates for themilky way and m31 and is consistent, albeit somewhat on the low side, with themass estimated using the timing argument. we show that although the timingargument is unbiased on average for all pairs, for pairs constrained to haveradial and tangential velocities similar to that of the local group theargument overestimates the sum of masses by a factor of $1.6$. using similartechnique we estimate the total dark matter mass enclosed within $1$ mpc fromthe local group barycenter to be $m_{\rm lg}(r&lt;1\, {\rmmpc})=4.2_{-2.0}^{+3.4}\times10^{12}\,m_{\odot}$ ($90\%$ confidence interval).

1512.00526	the effects of dark matter annihilation on cosmic reionization	we revisit the possibility of constraining the properties of dark matter (dm)by studying the epoch of cosmic reionization. previous studies have shown thatdm annihilation was unlikely to have provided a large fraction of the photonsthat ionized the universe, but instead played a subdominant role relative tostars and quasars. the dm, however, begins to efficiently annihilate with theformation of primordial microhalos at $z\sim100-200$, much earlier than theformation of the first stars. therefore, if dm annihilation ionized theuniverse at even the percent level over the interval $z \sim 20-100$, it canleave a significant imprint on the global optical depth, $\tau$. moreover, weshow that cosmic microwave background (cmb) polarization data and future 21 cmmeasurements will enable us to more directly probe the dm contribution to theoptical depth. in order to compute the annihilation rate throughout the epochof reionization, we adopt the latest results from structure formation studiesand explore the impact of various free parameters on our results. we show thatfuture measurements could make it possible to place constraints on the darkmatter's annihilation cross section that are at a level comparable to thoseobtained from the observations of dwarf galaxies, cosmic ray measurements, andstudies of recombination.

astro-ph;0001066	generation of the primordial magnetic fields during cosmological  reionization	we investigate the generation of magnetic field by the biermann battery incosmological ionization fronts, using new simulations of the reionization ofthe universe by stars in protogalaxies. two mechanisms are primarilyresponsible for magnetogenesis: i) the breakout of i-fronts from protogalaxies,and ii) the propagation of i-fronts through the high density neutral filamentswhich are part of the cosmic web. the first mechanism is dominant prior tooverlapping of ionized regions (z ~ 7), whereas the second continues to operateeven after that epoch. however, after overlap the field strength increase islargely due to the gas compression occurring as cosmic structures form. as aconsequence, the magnetic field at z ~ 5 closely traces the gas density, and itis highly ordered on megaparsec scales. the mean mass-weighted field strengthis b_0 ~ 10^{-19} g in the simulation box. there is a relatively well-defined,nearly linear correlation between b_0 and the baryonic mass of virializedobjects, with b_0 ~ 10^{-18} g in the most massive objects (m ~ 10^9 m_sun) inour simulations. this is a lower limit, as lack of numerical resolutionprevents us from following small scale dynamical processes which could amplifythe field in protogalaxies. although the field strengths we compute areprobably adequate as seed fields for a galactic dynamo, the field is too smallto have had significant effects on galaxy formation, on thermal conduction, oron cosmic ray transport in the intergalactic medium. it could, however, beobserved in the intergalactic medium through innovative methods based onanalysis of gamma-ray burst photon arrival times.

astro-ph;0002151	effect of reionization on the structure formation in the universe	i use simulations of cosmological reionization to quantify the effect ofphotoionization on the gas fraction in low mass objects, in particular thecharacteristic mass scale below which the gas fraction is reduced compared tothe universal value. i show that this characteristic scale can be up to anorder of magnitude lower than the linear theory jeans mass, and that even ifone defines the jeans mass at a higher overdensity, it does not track theevolution of this characteristic suppression mass. instead, the filtering mass,which corresponds directly to the scale over which baryonic perturbations aresmoothed in linear perturbation theory, provides a remarkably good fit to thecharacteristic mass scale. thus, it appears that the effect of reionization onstructure formation in both the linear and nonlinear regimes is described by asingle characteristic scale, the filtering scale of baryonic perturbations. incontrast to the jeans mass, the filtering mass depends on the full thermalhistory of the gas instead of the instantaneous value of the sound speed, so itaccounts for the finite time required for pressure to influence the gasdistribution in the expanding universe. in addition to the characteristicsuppression mass, i study the full shape of the probability distribution tofind an object with a given gas mass among all the objects with the same totalmass, and i show that the numerical results can be described by a simplefitting formula that again depends only on the filtering mass. this simpledescription of the probability distribution may be useful for semi-analyticalmodeling of structure formation in the early universe.

astro-ph;0012335	feedback from galaxy formation: production and photodissociation of  primordial molecular hydrogen	we use one-dimensional radiative transfer simulations to study the evolutionof h_2 gas-phase (h^- catalyzed) formation and photo-dissociation regions inthe primordial universe. we find a new positive feedback mechanism capable ofproducing shells of h_2 in the intergalactic medium, which are optically thickin some lyman-werner bands. while these shells exist, this feedback effect isimportant in reducing the h_2 dissociating background flux and the size ofphoto-dissociation spheres around each luminous object. the maximum backgroundopacity of the igm in the h_2 lyman-werner bands is \tau_{h_2} ~ 1-2 for arelic molecular fraction x_{h_2}=2 x 10^{-6}, about 6 times greater than foundby haiman, abel &amp; rees. therefore, the relic molecular hydrogen can decreasethe photo-dissociation rate by about an order of magnitude. the problem isrelevant to the formation of small primordial galaxies with masses m_{dm} &lt;10^8 m_\odot, that rely on molecular hydrogen cooling to collapse.alternatively, the universe may have remained dark for several hundred millionyears after the birth of the first stars, until galaxies with virialtemperature t_{vir} &gt; 10^4 k formed.

astro-ph;0103359	the expected mass function for low mass galaxies in a cdm cosmology: is  there a problem?	it is well known that the mass function for_halos_ in cdm cosmology is arelatively steep power law for low masses, possibly too steep to be consistentwith observations. but how steep is the_galaxy_ mass function? we have analyzedthe stellar and gas mass functions of the first massive luminous objects formedin a \lambda cdm universe, as calculated in the numerical simulation describedin gnedin (2000ab). we found that while the dark matter mass function is steep,the stellar and gas mass functions are flatter for low mass objects. thestellar mass function is consistently flat at the low mass end. moreover, whilethe gas mass function follows the dark matter mass function until reionizationat z~7, between z=7 and z=4, the gas mass function also flattens considerablyat the low mass end. at z=4, the gas and stellar mass functions are fit by aschechter function with \alpha ~ -1.2 +/- 0.1, significantly shallower than thedark matter halo mass function and consistent with some recent observations.the baryonic mass functions are shallower because (a) the dark matter halo massfunction is consistent with the press-schechter formulation at low masses n(m)  m^-2 and (b) heating/cooling and ionization processes appear to cause baryonsto collect in halos with the relationship m_b m_d^4 at low masses. combining(a) and (b) gives n(m_b) m_b^-5/4, comparable to the simulation results. thus,the well known observational fact that low mass galaxies are underabundant ascompared to expectations from numerical dark matter simulations orpress-schechter modeling of cdm universes emerges naturally from these results,implying that perhaps no ``new physics'' beyond the standard model is needed.

astro-ph;0110431	the fate of the first galaxies. i. self-consistent cosmological  simulations with radiative transfer	in cold dark matter (cdm) cosmogonies, low-mass objects play an importantrole in the evolution of the universe. not only are they the first luminousobjects to shed light in a previously dark universe, but, if their formation isnot inhibited by their own feedback, they dominate the galaxy mass functionuntil redshift z \sim 5. in this paper we present and discuss theimplementation of a 3d cosmological code that includes most of the neededphysics to simulate the formation and evolution of the first galaxies with aself-consistent treatment of radiative feedback. the simulation includescontinuum radiative transfer using the ``optically thin variable eddingtontensor'' (otvet) approximation and line-radiative transfer in the h_2lyman-werner bands of the background radiation. we include detailed chemistryfor h_2 formation/destruction, molecular and atomic cooling/heating processes,ionization by secondary electrons, and heating by ly\alpha resonant scattering.  we find that the first galaxies ("small-halos") are characterized by abursting star formation, self-regulated by a feedback process that acts oncosmological scales. their formation is not suppressed by feedback processes;therefore, their impact on cosmic evolution cannot be neglected. the main focusof this paper is on the methodology of the simulations, and we only brieflyintroduce some of the results. an extensive discussion of the results and thenature of the feedback mechanism are the focus of a companion paper.

astro-ph;0110432	the fate of the first galaxies. ii. effects of radiative feedback	[abridged]we use 3d cosmological simulations with radiative transfer to studythe formation and evolution of the first galaxies in a lcdm cosmology. we findthat the first luminous objects ("small-halos") are characterized by a burstingstar formation (sf) that is self-regulated by a feedback process acting oncosmological instead of galactic scales. the global star formation history isregulated by the mean number of ionizing photons that escape from each source,\epsilon_{uv}\fesc. it is almost independent of the assumed star formationefficiency parameter, \epsilon_*, and the intensity of the dissociatingbackground. the main feedback process that regulates the sf is the re-formationof h_2 in front of hii regions and inside relic hii regions. the hii regionsremain confined inside filaments, maximizing the production of h_2 in overdenseregions through cyclic destruction/reformation of h_2. if \epsilon_{uv}\fesc &gt;10^{-8}/\epsilon_* the sf is self-regulated, photo-evaporation of "small-halo"objects dominate the metal pollution of the low density igm, and the mass ofproduced metals depends only on \fesc. if \epsilon_{uv}\fesc \simlt10^{-8}/\epsilon_*, positive feedback dominates, and "small-halo" objectsconstitute the bulk of the mass in stars and metals at least until redshift z\sim 10. "small-halo" objects cannot reionize the universe because the feedbackmechanism confines the hii regions inside the large scale structure filaments.in contrast to massive objects, which can reionize voids, "small-halo" objectspartially ionize only the dense filaments while leaving the voids mostlyneutral.

astro-ph;0303386	lyman break galaxies and reionization of the universe	we present the star formation histories, luminosities, colors, mass to lightratios, and halo masses of "galaxies" formed in a simulation of cosmologicalreionization. we compare these galaxies with lyman break galaxies observed athigh redshift. while the simulation is severely limited by the small box size,the simulated galaxies do appear as fainter cousins of the observed ones. theyhave similar colors, and both simulated and observed galaxies can be fittedwith the same luminosity function. this is significant to the process ofreionization since in the simulation the stars alone are responsible forreionization at a redshift consistent with that of the gunn-peterson troughseen in the absorption spectra of qso's. the brightest galaxies at z = 4 areindeed quite young in accord with observational studies. but these brightestgalaxies are free riders - they contributed only about 25% to the reionizationof the universe at z &gt; 6. instead, the bulk of the work was done by dimmergalaxies, those that fall within the 28 &lt; i &lt; 30 magnitude range at z = 4.these dimmer galaxies are not necessarily less massive than the brightest ones.

astro-ph;0609763	scaling relations of dwarf galaxies without supernova-driven winds	nearby dwarf galaxies exhibit tight correlations between their global stellarand dynamical properties, such as circular velocity, mass-to-light ratio,stellar mass, surface brightness, and metallicity. such correlations have oftenbeen attributed to gas or metal-rich outflows driven by supernova energyfeedback to the interstellar medium. we use high-resolution cosmologicalsimulations of high-redshift galaxies with and without energy feedback, as wellas analytic modeling, to investigate whether the observed correlations canarise without supernova-driven outflows. we find that the simulated dwarfgalaxies exhibit correlations similar to those observed as early as z~10,regardless of whether supernova feedback is included. we also show that thecorrelations can be well reproduced by our analytic model that accounts forrealistic gas inflow but assumes no outflows, and star formation rate obeyingthe kennicutt-schmidt law with a critical density threshold. we argue thatcorrelations in simulated galaxies arise due to the increasingly inefficientconversion of gas into stars in low-mass dwarf galaxies rather thansupernova-driven outflows. we also show that the decrease of the observedeffective yield in low-mass objects, often used as an indicator of gas andmetal outflows, can be reasonably reproduced in our simulations withoutoutflows. we show that this trend can arise if a significant fraction of metalsin small galaxies is spread to the outer regions of the halo outside thestellar extent via mixing. in this case the effective yield can besignificantly underestimated if only metals within the stellar radius are takeninto account. measurements of gas metallicity in the outskirts of gaseous disksof dwarfs would thus provide a key test of such explanation.

astro-ph;9608047	reheating of the universe and population iii	we note that current observational evidence strongly favors a conventionalrecombination of ionized matter subsequent to redshift z=1200, followed byreionization prior to redshift z=5 and compute how this would have occurred ina standard scenario for the growth of structure. extending prior semi-analyticwork, we show by direct, high-resolution numerical simulations (of a cobenormalized cdm+lambda model) that reheating, will occur in the interval 15&gt;z&gt;7,followed by reionization and accompanied by a significant increase in the jeansmass. however, the evolution of the jeans mass does not significantly affectstar formation in dense, self-shielded clumps of gas, which are detached fromthe thermal evolution of the rest of the universe. on average, the growth ofthe jeans mass tracks the growth of the nonlinear mass scale, a result wesuspect is due to nonlinear feedback effects. cooling on molecular hydrogenleads to a burst of star formation prior to reheating which produces populationiii stars with omega_* reaching 10^{-5.5} and z/z_sun reaching 10^{-3.7} byz=14. star formation subsequently slows down as molecular hydrogen is depletedby photo-destruction and the rise of the temperature. at later times, z&lt;10,when the characteristic virial temperature of gas clumps reach 10,000 degrees,star formation increases again as hydrogen line cooling become efficient.objects containing pop iii stars accrete mass with time and, as soon as theyreach 10,000 k virial temperature, they engage in renewed star formation andturn into normal pop ii objects having an old pop iii metal poor component.

astro-ph;9608157	the statistics of density peaks and the column density distribution of  the lyman-alpha forest	we develop a method to calculate the column density distribution of thelyman-alpha forest for column densities in the range $10^{12.5} - 10^{14.5}cm^{-2}$. the zel'dovich approximation, with appropriate smoothing, is used tocompute the density and peculiar velocity fields. the effect of the latter onabsorption profiles is discussed and it is shown to have little effect on thecolumn density distribution. an approximation is introduced in which the columndensity distribution is related to a statistic of density peaks (involving itsheight and first and second derivatives along the line of sight) in real space.we show that the slope of the column density distribution is determined by thetemperature-density relation as well as the power spectrum on scales $2 hmpc^{-1} &lt; k &lt; 20 h mpc^{-1}$. an expression relating the three is given. wefind very good agreement between the column density distribution obtained byapplying the voigt-profile-fitting technique to the output of a fullhydrodynamic simulation and that obtained using our approximate method for atest model. this formalism then is applied to study a group of cdm as well aschdm models. we show that the amplitude of the column density distributiondepends on the combination of parameters $(\omega_b h^2)^2 t_0^{-0.7}j_{hi}^{-1}$, which is not well-constrained by independent observations. theslope of the distribution, on the other hand, can be used to distinguishbetween different models: those with a smaller amplitude and a steeper slope ofthe power spectrum on small scales give rise to steeper distributions, for therange of column densities we study. comparison with high resolution keck datais made.

astro-ph;9612127	reionization of the universe and the early production of metals	we simulate a plausible cosmological model in considerable physical andnumerical detail through the successive phases of reheating (at 10&lt;z&lt;20),formation of pop iii stars at z=15 (due to molecular hydrogen cooling), withsubsequent reionization at z=7. we assume an efficiency of high mass starformation appropriate to leave the universe, after it becomes transparent, withan ionizing background j_21=0.4 (at z=4), near (and perhaps slightly below) theobserved value. since the same stars produce the ionizing radiation and thefirst generation of heavy elements, a mean metallicity of z/z_\sun=1/200 isproduced in this early phase, but there is a large variation about this mean,with the high density regions having z/z_\sun=1/30 and low density regionsessentially no metals.  reionization, when it occurs, is very rapid, which will leave a signaturewhich may be detectable by very large area meter-wavelength radio instruments.also, the background uv radiation field will show a sharp drop from 1ryd to4ryd due to absorption edges.  the simulated volume is too small to form l_* galaxies, but the smallerobjects which are found in the simulation obey the faber-jackson relation.  in order to explore theoretically this domain of "the end of the dark ages"quantitatively, numerical simulations must have a mass resolution of the orderof 10^{4.5} m_\sun} in baryons, high spatial resolution (1 kpc) to resolvestrong clumping, and allow for detailed and accurate treatment of both theradiation field and atomic/molecular physics.

astro-ph;9612232	equation of state of the photoionized intergalactic medium	we develop an efficient method to study the effects of reionization historyon the temperature-density relation of the intergalactic medium in the lowdensity limit (overdensity less than 5). it is applied to the study ofphoto-reionization models in which the amplitude, spectrum and onset epoch ofthe ionizing flux, as well as the cosmology, are systematically varied. we findthat the mean temperature-density relation at z=2-4 is well approximated by apower-law equation of state for uniform reionization models. we deriveanalytical expressions for its evolution and exhibit its asymptotic behavior:it is found that for sufficiently early reionization, imprints of reionizationhistory prior to z=10 on the temperature-density relation are washed out. inthis limit the temperature at cosmic mean density is proportional to (\omega_bh/\sqrt\omega_0)^{1/1.7}. while the amplitude of the radiation flux at theionizing frequency of hi is found to have a negligible effect on thetemperature-density relation as long as the universe reionizes before z=5, thespectrum can change the overall temperature by about 20%, through variations inthe abundances of helium species. however the slope of the mean equation ofstate is found to lie within a narrow range for all reionization models westudy, where reionization takes place before z=5. we discuss the implicationsof these findings for the observational properties of the lyman-alpha forest.in particular, uncertainties in the temperature of the intergalactic medium,due to the uncertain reionization history of our universe, introduces a 30%scaling in the amplitude of the column density distribution while the the slopeof the distribution is only affected by about 5%. finally, we discuss how afluctuating ionizing field affects the above results. we argue that under

astro-ph;9706219	probing the universe with the lyman-alpha forest: i. hydrodynamics of  the low density igm	we introduce an efficient and accurate alternative to full hydrodynamicsimulations, hydro-pm (hpm), for the study of the low column densitylyman-alpha forest. it consists of a particle-mesh solver, modified to compute,in addition to the gravitational potential, an effective potential due to thegas pressure. such an effective potential can be computed from the densityfield because of a tight correlation between density and pressure in the lowdensity limit, which can be calculated for any photo-reionization history by amethod outlined in hui &amp; gnedin (1997). such a correlation exists, in part,because of minimal shock-heating in the low density limit. we compare carefullythe density and velocity fields as well as absorption spectra, computed usinghpm versus hydrodynamic simulations, and find good agreement. we show that hpmis capable of reproducing measurable quantities, such as the column densitydistribution, computed from full hydrodynamic simulations, to a precisioncomparable to that of observations. we discuss how, by virtue of its speed andaccuracy, hpm can enable us to use the lyman-alpha forest as a cosmologicalprobe. we also discuss in detail the smoothing of the gas (or baryon)fluctuation relative to that of the dark matter on small scales due to finitegas pressure. it is shown the conventional wisdom that the linear gasfluctuation is smoothed on the jeans scale is incorrect for generalreionization (or reheating) history; the correct linear filtering scale is ingeneral smaller than the jeans scale after reheating, but larger prior to it.(abridged)

astro-ph;9804038	the x-ray forest: a new prediction of hierarchical structure formation  models	we use numerical simulations of structure formation in a cold dark mattermodel to predict the absorption lines in the soft x-rays produced by heavyelements in the shock-heated intergalactic medium at low redshift. thesimulation incorporates a model for metal production in galaxies and thesubsequent dispersion of the metals to the intergalactic medium. we analyze inparticular absorption lines produced by oxygen, and calculate the ionizationstage taking into account the observed x-ray background at the present time. wefind that oxygen is fully ionized by the x-ray background in low-density voids,and is mostly in the form of ovii and oviii in the sheets and filamentaryregions. strong absorption lines of ovii and oviii with equivalent widths w ~100 km/s are produced in filamentary regions of overdensities ~ 100 andtemperatures ~ 10^6 k, located in the outskirts of groups and clusters ofgalaxies. the ovii line at e = 574 ev is generally the strongest one in thesesystems. our model predicts that any x-ray source (such as a quasar) shouldtypically show about one ovii absorption line with w &gt; 100 km/s in the intervalfrom z=0 to z=0.3. these lines could be detected with the upcoming generationof x-ray telescopes, and their origin in intervening systems could be confirmedby the association with groups of galaxies and x-ray emitting halos near theline-of-sight at the same redshift. the hot intergalactic medium may be one ofthe main reservoirs of baryons in the present universe, and the heavy elementx-ray absorption lines offer a promising possibility of detecting this newcomponent in the near future.

0810.4148	modeling molecular hydrogen and star formation in cosmological  simulations	we describe a phenomenological model for molecular hydrogen formation suitedfor applications in galaxy formation simulations, which includes on-equilibriumformation of molecular hydrogen on dust and approximate treatment of both itsself-shielding and shielding by dust from the dissociating uv radiation. themodel is applicable in simulations in which individual star forming regions -the giant molecular complexes - can be identified (resolution of tens of pc)and their mean internal density estimated reliably, even if internal structureis not resolved. in agreement with previous studies, calculations based on ourmodel show that the transition from atomic to fully molecular phase dependsprimarily on the metallicity, which we assume is directly related to the dustabundance, and clumpiness of the interstellar medium. the clumpiness simplyboosts the formation rate of molecular hydrogen, while dust serves both as acatalyst of molecular hydrogen formation and as an additional shielding fromdissociating uv radiation. the upshot is that it is difficult to formfully-shielded giant molecular clouds while gas metallicity is low. however,once the gas is enriched to z ~ 0.01-0.1 solar, the subsequent star formationand enrichment can proceed at a much faster rate. this may keep star formationefficiency in the low-mass, low-metallicity progenitors of galaxies very lowfor a certain period of time with the effect similar to a strong "feedback"mechanism.
