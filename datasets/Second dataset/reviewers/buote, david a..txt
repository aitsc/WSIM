0906.0576	hydrostatic gas constraints on supermassive black hole masses:  implications for hydrostatic equilibrium and dynamical modelling in a sample  of early-type galaxies	we present new mass measurements for the supermassive black holes (smbhs) inthe centres of three early-type galaxies. the gas pressure in the surrounding,hot interstellar medium (ism) is measured through spatially resolvedspectroscopy with the chandra x-ray observatory, allowing the smbh mass (mbh)to be inferred directly under the hydrostatic approximation. this techniquedoes not require calibration against other smbh measurement methods and itsaccuracy depends only on the ism being close to hydrostatic, which is supportedby the smooth x-ray isophotes of the galaxies. combined with results from ourrecent study of the elliptical galaxy ngc4649, this brings to four the numberof galaxies with smbhs measured in this way. of these, three already have massdeterminations from the kinematics of either the stars or a central gas disc,and hence join only a handful of galaxies with mbh measured by more than onetechnique. we find good agreement between the different methods, providingsupport for the assumptions implicit in both the hydrostatic and the dynamicalmodels. the stellar mass-to-light ratios for each galaxy inferred by ourtechnique are in agreement with the predictions of stellar population synthesismodels assuming a kroupa initial mass function (imf). this concurrence impliesthat no more than ~10-20% of the ism pressure is nonthermal, unless there is aconspiracy between the shape of the imf and nonthermal pressure. finally, wecompute bondi accretion rates, finding that the two galaxies with the highestrates exhibit little evidence of x-ray cavities, suggesting that thecorrelation with the agn jet power takes time to be established.

0909.0600	agn feedback in galaxy groups: the two interesting cases of awm 4 and  ngc 5044	we present agn feedback in the interesting cases of two groups: awm 4 and ngc5044. awm 4 is characterized by a combination of properties which seems to defythe paradigm for agn heating in cluster cores: a flat inner temperature profileindicative of a past, major heating episode which completely erased the coolcore, as testified by the high central cooling time (&gt; 3 gyrs) and by the highcentral entropy level (~ 50 kev cm^2), and yet an active central radio galaxywith extended radio lobes out to 100 kpc, revealing recent feeding of thecentral massive black hole. a recent chandra observation has revealed thepresence of a compact cool corona associated with the bcg, solving the puzzleof the apparent lack of low entropy gas surrounding a bright radio source, butopening the question of its origin. ngc 5044 shows in the inner 10 kpc a pairof cavities together with a set of bright filaments. the cavities areconsistent with a recent agn outburst as also indicated by the extent of dustand h_alpha emission even though the absence of extended 1.4 ghz emissionremains to be explained. the soft x-ray filaments coincident with h_alpha anddust emission are cooler than those which do not correlate with optical andinfrared emission, suggesting that dust-aided cooling can contribute to theoverall cooling. for the first time sloshing cold fronts at the scale of agalaxy group have been observed in this object.

0910.0883	x-ray isophotes in a rapidly rotating elliptical galaxy: evidence of  inflowing gas	we describe two-dimensional gasdynamical computations of the x-ray emittinggas in the rotating elliptical galaxy ngc 4649 that indicate an inflow of aboutone solar mass per year at every radius. such a large instantaneous inflowcannot have persisted over a hubble time. the central constant-entropytemperature peak recently observed in the innermost 150 parsecs is explained bycompressive heating as gas flows toward the central massive black hole. sincethe cooling time of this gas is only a few million years, ngc 4649 provides themost acutely concentrated known example of the cooling flow problem in whichthe time-integrated apparent mass that has flowed into the galactic coreexceeds the total mass observed there. this paradox can be resolved byintermittent outflows of energy or mass driven by accretion energy releasednear the black hole. inflowing gas is also required at intermediate kpc radiito explain the ellipticity of x-ray isophotes due to spin-up by mass ejected bystars that rotate with the galaxy and to explain local density and temperatureprofiles. we provide evidence that many luminous elliptical galaxies undergosimilar inflow spin-up. a small turbulent viscosity is required in ngc 4649 toavoid forming large x-ray luminous disks that are not observed, but theturbulent pressure is small and does not interfere with mass determinationsthat assume hydrostatic equilibrium.

0911.0678	the slope of the mass profile and the tilt of the fundamental plane in  early-type galaxies	we present a survey, using the chandra x-ray observatory, of the centralgravitating mass profiles in a sample of 10 galaxies, groups and clusters,spanning ~2 orders of magnitude in virial mass. we find the total massdistributions from ~0.2--10re, where re is the optical effective radius of thecentral galaxy, are remarkably similar to powerlaw density profiles. thenegative logarithmic slope of the mass density profiles, alpha, systematicallyvaries with re, from alpha=2, for systems with re~4kpc to alpha=1.2 for systemswith re&gt;30kpc. departures from hydrostatic equilibrium are likely to be smalland cannot easily explain this trend. we show that the conspiracy between thebaryonic (sersic) and dark matter (nfw/ einasto) components required tomaintain a powerlaw total mass distribution naturally predicts ananti-correlation between alpha and re that is very close to what is observed.the systematic variation of alpha with re implies a dark matter fraction withinre that varies systematically with the properties of the galaxy in such amanner as to reproduce, without fine tuning, the observed tilt of thefundamental plane. we speculate that establishing a nearly powerlaw total massdistribution is therefore a fundamental feature of galaxy formation and theprimary factor which determines the tilt of the fundamental plane.

1001.3692	confirmation of x-ray absorption by whim in the sculptor wall	in a previous paper we reported a 3-sigma detection of an absorption linefrom the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim) using the chandra and xmm x-raygrating spectra of the blazar h2356-309, the sight-line of which intercepts thesculptor wall, a large-scale superstructure of galaxies at z ~ 0.03. to verifyour initial detection, we obtained a deep (500 ks), follow-up exposure ofh2356-309 as part of the cycle-10 chandra large project program. from a jointanalysis of the cycle-10 and previous (cycle-8) chandra grating data we detectthe redshifted ovii whim line at a significance level of 3.4-sigma, asubstantial improvement over the 1.7-sigma level reported previously when usingonly the cycle-8 data. the significance increases to 4.0-sigma when theexisting xmm grating data are included in the analysis, thus confirming athigher significance the existence of the line at the redshift of the sculptorwall with an equivalent width of 28.5+/-10.5 ma (90% confidence). we obtain a90% lower limit on the ovii column density of 0.8 10^16 cm^-2 and a 90% upperlimit on the doppler-b parameter of 460 km/s. assuming the absorber isuniformly distributed throughout the ~ 15 mpc portion of the blazar'ssight-line that intercepts the sculptor wall, that the ovii column density is ~2 10^16 cm^-2 (corresponding to b &gt; 150 km/s where the inferred column densityis only weakly dependent on b), and that the oxygen abundance is 0.1 solar, weestimate a baryon over-density of ~ 30 for the whim, which is consistent withthe peak of the whim mass fraction predicted by cosmological simulations. theclear detection of ovii absorption in the sculptor wall demonstrates theviability of using current observatories to study whim in the x-ray absorptionspectra of blazars behind known large-scale structures.

1010.6078	a census of baryons and dark matter in an isolated, milky way-sized  elliptical galaxy	we present a study of the dark and luminous matter in the isolated ellipticalgalaxy ngc720, based on deep x-ray observations made with chandra and suzaku.the gas is reliably measured to ~r2500, allowing us to place good constraintson the enclosed mass and baryon fraction (fb) within this radius(m2500=1.6e12+/-0.2e12 msun, fb(2500)=0.10+/-0.01; systematic errors are&lt;~20%). the data indicate that the hot gas is close to hydrostatic, which issupported by good agreement with a kinematical analysis of the dwarf satellitegalaxies. we confirm a dark matter (dm) halo at ~20-sigma. assuming an nfw dmprofile, our physical model for the gas distribution enables us to obtainmeaningful constraints at scales larger than r2500, revealing that most of thebaryons are in the hot gas. we find that fb within rvir is consistent with thecosmological value, confirming theoretical predictions that a ~milky way-mass(mvir=3.1e12+/-0.4e12 msun) galaxy can sustain a massive, quasi-hydrostatic gashalo. while fb is higher than the cold baryon fraction typically measured insimilar-mass spiral galaxies, both the gas fraction (fg) and fb in ngc720 areconsistent with an extrapolation of the trends with mass seen in massive galaxygroups and clusters. after correcting for fg, the entropy profile is close tothe self-similar prediction of gravitational structure formation simulations,as observed in galaxy clusters. finally, we find a strong heavy metal abundancegradient in the ism similar to those observed in massive galaxy groups.

1102.3646	detection of a transient x-ray absorption line intrinsic to the bl  lacertae object h 2356-309	since the launch of the einstein x-ray observatory in the 1970s, a number ofbroad absorption features have been reported in the x-ray spectra of bl lacobjects. these features are often interpreted as arising from high velocityoutflows intrinsic to the bl lac object, therefore providing importantinformation about the inner environment around the central engine. however,such absorption features have not been observed more recently withhigh-resolution x-ray telescopes such as chandra and xmm-newton. in this paper,we report the detection of a transient x-ray absorption feature intrinsic tothe bl lac object h 2356-309 with the chandra x-ray telescope. this bl lacobject was observed during xmm cycle 7, chandra cycle 8 and 10, as part of ourcampaign to investigate x-ray absorption produced by the warm-hot intergalacticmedium (whim) residing in the foreground large scale superstructure. during oneof the 80 ksec, chandra cycle 10 observations, a transient absorption featurewas detected at 3.3-sigma (or 99.9% confidence level, accounting for the numberof trials), which we identify as the oviii k-alpha line produced by an absorberintrinsic to the bl lac object. none of the other 11 observations showed thisline. we constrain the ionization parameter (25 &lt;~ xi &lt;~ 40) and temperature(10^5 &lt; t &lt; 2.5 10^7 k) of the absorber. this absorber is likely produced by anoutflow with a velocity up to 1,500 km/s. there is a suggestion of possibleexcess emission on the long-wavelength side of the absorption line; however,the derived properties of the emission material are very different from thoseof the absorption material, implying it is unlikely a typical p cygni-typeprofile.

1106.3322	tracing the gas to the virial radius (r100) in a fossil group	we present a chandra, suzaku and rosat study of the hot intra group medium(igrm) of the relaxed fossil group/ poor cluster rxj1159+5531. this groupexhibits an advantageous combination of flat surface brightness profile, highluminosity and optimal distance, allowing the gas to be detected out to thevirial radius (rvir=r108=1100 kpc) in a single suzaku pointing, while thecomplementary chandra data reveal a round morphology and relaxed igrm imagedown to kpc scales. we measure the igrm entropy profile over 3 orders ofmagnitude in radius, including 3 data bins beyond 0.5r200 with azimuthalcoverage (&gt;30%). we find no evidence that the profile flattens at large scales(&gt;r500), and when corrected for the enclosed gas fraction, the entropy profileis very close to the predictions from self-similar structure formationsimulations, as seen in massive clusters. within rvir, we measure a baryonfraction of 0.17+/-0.02, consistent with the cosmological value. these resultsare in sharp contrast to the gas behaviour at large scales recently reported inthe virgo and perseus clusters, and indicate that substantial gas clumpingcannot be ubiquitous near rvir, at least in highly evolved (fossil) groups.

1109.6656	spherically averaging ellipsoidal galaxy clusters in x-ray and  sunyaev-zel'dovich studies: ii. biases	this is the second of two papers investigating the spherical averaging ofellipsoidal galaxy clusters in the context of x-ray and sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz)observations. in the present study we quantify the orientation-average bias andscatter in observables that result from spherically averaging clustersdescribed by ellipsoidal generalizations of the nfw profile or a nearlyscale-free logarithmic potential. although the mean biases are small and mostly&lt;1%, the flattest cluster models generally have a significant mean bias; i.e.,averaging over all orientations does not always eliminate projection biases.substantial biases can result from different viewing orientations, where theintegrated compton-y parameter (y_sz) and the concentration have the largestscatter (as large as sigma ~10% for y_sz), and the emission-weightedtemperature (t_x) has the smallest (sigma &lt; ~0.5%). the very small scatter fort_x leads to y_x and m_gas having virtually the same orientation biases.substantial scatter is expected for individual clusters (up to sigma ~8%) inthe correlation between y_sz and y_x in comparison to the small mean bias(sigma &lt; ~1%) applicable to a random sample of clusters of sufficient size. forellipsoidal nfw models we show that the orientation bias for the total clustermass attains a minimum near the radius r_2500 so that the spherically averagedmass computed at this radius is always within ~0.5% of the true value for anyorientation. finally, to facilitate the accounting for orientation bias inx-ray and sz cluster studies, we provide cubic polynomial approximations to themean orientation bias and 1-sigma scatter for each cluster observable as afunction of axial ratio for the ellipsoidal nfw models.

1109.6921	spherically averaging ellipsoidal galaxy clusters in x-ray and  sunyaev-zel'dovich studies: i. analytical relations	this is the first of two papers investigating the deprojection and sphericalaveraging of ellipsoidal galaxy clusters. we specifically consider applicationsto hydrostatic x-ray and sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) studies, though many of theresults also apply to isotropic dispersion-supported stellar dynamical systems.here we present analytical formulas for galaxy clusters described by agravitational potential that is a triaxial ellipsoid of constant shape andorientation. for this model type we show that the mass bias due to sphericallyaveraging x-ray observations is independent of the temperature profile, and forthe special case of a scale-free logarithmic potential, there is exactly zeromass bias for any shape, orientation, and temperature profile. the ratio ofspherically averaged intracluster medium (icm) pressures obtained from sz andx-ray measurements depends only on the icm intrinsic shape, projectionorientation, and h_0, which provides another illustration of how clustergeometry can be recovered through a combination of x-ray and sz measurements.we also demonstrate that y_sz and y_x have different biases owing to sphericalaveraging, which leads to an offset in the spherically averaged y_sz - y_xrelation. a potentially useful application of the analytical formulas presentedis to assess the error range of an observable (e.g., mass, y_sz) accounting fordeviations from assumed spherical symmetry, without having to perform theellipsoidal deprojection explicitly. finally, for dedicated ellipsoidalstudies, we also generalize the spherical onion peeling method to the triaxialcase for a given shape and orientation.

1204.3095	the elixr galaxy survey. ii: baryons and dark matter in an isolated  elliptical galaxy	the elliptical isolated x-ray (elixr) galaxy survey is a volume-limited(&lt;110mpc) study of optically selected, isolated, lstar elliptical galaxies, toprovide an x-ray census of galaxy-scale (virial mass, mvir &lt; 1e13 msun)objects, and identify candidates for detailed hydrostatic mass modelling. inthis paper, we present a chandra and xmm study of one such candidate, ngc1521,and constrain its distribution of dark and baryonic matter. we find amorphologically relaxed hot gas halo, extending almost to r500, that is welldescribed by hydrostatic models similar to the benchmark, baryonically closed,milky way-mass elliptical galaxy ngc720. we obtain good constraints on theenclosed gravitating mass (m500=3.8e12+/-1e12 msun, slightly higher thanngc\thin 720), and baryon fraction (fb500=0.13+/-0.03). we confirm at 8.2-sigmathe presence of a dark matter (dm) halo consistent with lcdm. assuming anavarro-frenk-white dm profile, our self-consistent, physical model enablesmeaningful constraints beyond r500, revealing that most of the baryons are inthe hot gas. within the virial radius, fb is consistent with the cosmic mean,suggesting that the predicted massive, quasi-hydrostatic gas halos may be morecommon than previously thought. we confirm that the dm and stars conspire toproduce an approximately powerlaw total mass profile (rho \propto r^-alpha)that follows the recently discovered scaling relation between alpha and opticaleffective radius. our conclusions are insensitive to modest, observationallymotivated, deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium. finally, after correctingfor the enclosed gas fraction, the entropy profile is close to the self-similarprediction of gravitational structure formation simulations, as observed inmassive galaxy clusters.

1205.0256	reconciling stellar dynamical and hydrostatic x-ray mass measurements of  an elliptical galaxy with gas rotation, turbulence and magnetic fields	recent hydrostatic x-ray studies of the hot interstellar medium (ism) inearly-type galaxies underestimate the gravitating mass as compared to stellardynamics, implying modest, but significant deviations from exact hydrostaticequilibrium. we present a method for combining x-ray measurements and stellardynamical constraints in the context of bayesian statistics that allows theradial distribution of the implied nonthermal pressure or bulk motions in thehot ism to be constrained. we demonstrate the accuracy of the method withhydrodynamical simulations tailored to produce a realistic galaxy model.applying the method to the nearby elliptical galaxy ngc4649, we find asignificant but subdominant nonthermal pressure fraction (0.27+/-0.06) in thecentral (&lt;5 kpc) part of the galaxy, similar to the level of deviations fromhydrostatic equilibrium expected in galaxy clusters. plausible sources ofsystematic error, if important, may reduce this fraction. this would imply &gt;360km/s random turbulence or a magnetic field b=(39+/-6)(n_e/0.1cm^{-3})^{0.59+/-0.09} mug, whereas gas rotation alone is unlikely to explainthe detailed nonthermal profile. future observations with astro-h will allowturbulence or gas rotation at this level to be detected.

0801.3461	weighing the quiescent central black hole in an elliptical galaxy with  x-ray emitting gas	we present a chandra study of the hot ism in the giant elliptical galaxyngc4649. in common with other group-centred ellipticals, its temperatureprofile rises with radius in the outer parts of the galaxy, from ~0.7kev at2kpc to ~0.9kev by 20kpc. however, within the central ~2kpc the trend reversesand the temperature peaks at ~1.1kev within the innermost 200pc. under theassumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, we demonstrate that the centraltemperature spike arises due to the gravitational influence of a quiescentcentral super-massive black hole. we constrain the black hole mass (mbh) to$(3.35^{+0.67}_{-0.95})\times 10^9$msun (90% confidence), in good agreementwith stellar kinematics measurements. this is the first direct measurement ofmbh based on studies of hydrostatic x-ray emitting gas, which are sensitive tothe most massive black holes, and is a crucial validation of bothmass-determination techniques. this agreement clearly demonstrates the gas mustbe close to hydrostatic, even in the very centre of the galaxy, which isconsistent with the lack of morphological disturbances in the x-ray image.ngc4649 is now one of only a handful of galaxies for which mbh has beenmeasured by more than one method. at larger radii, we were able to decomposethe gravitating mass profile into stellar and dark matter (dm) components.unless one accounts for the dm, a standard virial analysis of the starsdramatically over-estimates the stellar mass of the galaxy. we find themeasured j-band stellar mass-to-light ratio, 1.37+/-0.10 msun/lsun, is in goodagreement with simple stellar population model calculations for this object.

astro-ph;0001328	oxygen absorption in cooling flows	the inhomogeneous cooling flow scenario predicts the existence of largequantities of gas in massive elliptical galaxies, groups, and clusters thathave cooled and dropped out of the flow. using spatially resolved, deprojectedx-ray spectra from the rosat pspc we have detected strong absorption overenergies ~0.4-0.8 kev intrinsic to the central ~1 arcmin of the galaxy, ngc1399, the group, ngc 5044, and the cluster, a1795. these systems have amongstthe largest nearby cooling flows in their respective classes and low galacticcolumns. since no excess absorption is indicated for energies below ~0.4 kevthe most reasonable model for the absorber is warm, collisionally ionized gaswith t=10^{5-6} k where ionized states of oxygen provide most of theabsorption. attributing the absorption only to ionized gas reconciles the largecolumns of cold h and he inferred from einstein and asca with the lack of suchcolumns inferred from rosat, and also is consistent with the negligible atomicand molecular h inferred from hi, and co observations of cooling flows. theprediction of warm ionized gas as the product of mass drop-out in these andother cooling flows can be verified by chandra, xmm, and astro-e.

astro-ph;0001329	iron gradients in cooling flow galaxies and groups	previous studies of the fe abundances in the hot gas of galaxies and groupshave reported conflicting results with most studies finding very sub-solar feabundances that disagree with standard theory. to investigate the possible roleof fe abundance gradients on these measurements we present deprojectionanalysis of the rosat pspc data of 10 of the brightest cooling flow galaxiesand groups. the pspc allows for spatially resolved spectral analysis on ahalf-arcminute scale, and interesting constraints on both the temperatures andfe abundances are possible because the ~1 kev temperatures of these systems arewell matched to the bandpass of the pspc. in 9 out of 10 systems we find clearevidence that the fe abundance decreases with increasing radius: z_fe ~1 solar- (several) solar within the central radial bin (r &lt; ~10 kpc) which decreasesto z_fe ~0.5 solar at the largest radii examined (r ~50-100 kpc). the feabundances (and temperatures) are consistent with the average values for thesesystems that we obtained in our previous analyses of the asca data usingmultitemperature models which confirms that previous inferences of verysub-solar fe abundances from asca arise from the incorrect assumption ofisothermal gas and not the presence of fe abundance gradients. we discuss whythis ``fe bias'' affects much more seriously the measurements of z_fe from ascadata than from rosat data. we show that the fe abundance profiles for thesegalaxies and groups are consistent with a gas-dynamical model where the gas isenriched by stellar ejecta and supernovae in the ``solar supernovaproportion'', the stars formed with a galactic imf, and the gas is diluted bymixing with primordial gas at large radii.

astro-ph;0001330	rosat evidence for intrinsic oxygen absorption in cooling flow galaxies  and groups	using spatially resolved, deprojected rosat pspc spectra of 10 of thebrightest cooling flow galaxies and groups with low galactic column densitieswe have detected intrinsic absorption over energies ~0.4-0.8 kev in half of thesample. since no intrinsic absorption is indicated for energies below ~0.4 kev,the most reasonable model for the absorber is collisionally ionized gas attemperatures t=10^{5-6} k with most of the absorption arising from ionizedstates of oxygen but with a significant contribution from carbon and nitrogen.the soft x-ray emission of this warm gas can explain the sub-galactic columndensities of cold gas inferred within the central regions of most of thesystems. attributing the absorption to ionized gas reconciles the large columnsof cold h and he inferred from einstein and asca with the lack of such columnsinferred from rosat. within the central ~10-20 kpc, where the constraints aremost secure, the estimated mass of the ionized absorber is consistent with most(perhaps all) of the matter deposited by a cooling flow over the lifetime ofthe flow. since the warm absorber produces no significant h or he absorptionthe large absorber masses are consistent with the negligible atomic andmolecular h inferred from hi and co observations of cooling flows. it is alsofound that if t &gt; ~2x10^5 k then the optical and uv emission implied by thewarm gas does not violate published constraints. finally, we discuss how theprediction of warm ionized gas as the product of mass drop-out in these andother cooling flows can be verified with new chandra and xmm observations.(abridged)

astro-ph;0008408	oxygen absorption in m87: evidence for a warm+hot ism	we present a re-analysis of the rosat pspc data within the central 100 kpc ofm87 to search for intrinsic oxygen absorption similar to that recently measuredin several galaxies and groups. using a spatial-spectral deprojection analysiswe find the strongest evidence to date for intrinsic oxygen absorption in thehot gas of a galaxy, group, or cluster. single-phase plasma models modified byintervening galactic absorption cannot fit the 0.2-2.2 kev pspc data as theyunder-predict the 0.2-0.4 kev region and over-predict the 0.5-0.8 kev regionwhere the emission and absorption residuals are obvious upon visual inspectionof the spectral fits. since the excess emission between 0.2-0.4 kev rules outintrinsic absorption from cold gas or dust, the most reasonable model for theexcess emission and absorption features is warm, collisionally ionized gas witha temperature of ~10^6 k. simple multiphase models (cooling flow, two phases)modified by both intervening galactic absorption and by a single oxygen edgeprovide good fits and yield temperatures and fe abundances of the hot gas thatagree with previous determinations by asca and sax. the multiphase models ofm87 inferred from the pspc can account for the excess euv emission observedwith euve and the excess x-ray absorption inferred from einstein and asca dataabove 0.5 kev. although the total mass of the warm gas implied by the oxygenabsorption is consistent with the matter deposited by a cooling flow, thesuppression of the mass deposition rate and the distortion of the x-rayisophotes in the region where the radio emission is most pronounced suggestsome feedback effect from the agn on the cooling gas.

0808.1106	rotation and turbulence of the hot icm in galaxy clusters	cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters typically find that the weight ofa cluster at a given radius is not balanced entirely by the thermal gaspressure of the hot icm, with theoretical studies emphasizing the role ofrandom turbulent motions to provide the necessary additional pressure support.using a set of high-resolution, hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clustersthat include radiative cooling and star formation, we find instead that in themost relaxed clusters rotational support exceeds that from random turbulentmotions for radii 0.1 - 0.5 r_500, and that the observed clusters are muchrounder than the simulated, relaxed clusters within ~ 0.4 r_500. moreover,while the observed clusters display an average ellipticity profile that doesnot vary significantly with radius, the ellipticity of the relaxed cdm clustersdeclines markedly with increasing radius, suggesting that the icm of theobserved clusters rotates less rapidly than that of the relaxed cdm clustersout to ~ 0.6 r_500. we also find the ellipticity profile of a simulated clusterwithout radiative cooling is in much better agreement with the observations,implying that over-cooling has a substantial impact on the gas dynamics andmorphology out to larger radii than previously recognized. it also suggeststhat the 10%-20% systematic errors from non-thermal gas pressure supportreported for simulated cluster masses, obtained from fitting simulated x-raydata over large radial ranges within r_500, may need to be revised downward.these results demonstrate the utility of x-ray ellipticity profiles as a probeof icm rotation and over-cooling which should be used to constrain futurecosmological cluster simulations.

astro-ph;0101545	spatial diffusion of x-ray emission lines in the m87 cooling flow;  evidence for absorption	recent xmm-newton observations of the cooling flow gas in m87 indicatesharply decreasing oxygen, iron and silicon abundances within $\sim 5$ kpc ofthe galactic center. this result is unexpected since stellar mass loss and typeia supernovae are expected to produce pronounced central abundance maxima forall three elements. however, it has been suggested that many of the strongx-ray lines are optically thick and diffuse to larger radii in the cooling flowbefore escaping, falsifying the central abundances. we verify with radiationtransfer calculations that this effect does indeed occur in the m87 coolingflow, but that it is insufficient to account for the m87 observations. wesuggest that some source of continuous opacity is required to reduce thecentral x-ray line emission, perhaps by warm gas at $t \sim 10^5 - 10^6$ k. theradial surface brightness profiles of x-ray resonance lines are also sensitiveto turbulence in cooling flows which reduces the line center optical depthsconsiderably. turbulence may provide sufficient energy to continuously heat thewarm absorbing gas.

astro-ph;0104211	on the origin of radio halos in galaxy clusters	previously it has been recognized that radio halos in galaxy clusters arepreferentially associated with merging systems as indicated by substructure inthe x-ray images and temperature maps. since, however, many clusters withoutradio halos also possess substructure, the role of mergers in the formation ofradio halos has remained unclear. by using power ratios to relate gravitationalpotential fluctuations to substructure in x-ray images, we provide the firstquantitative comparison of the dynamical states of clusters possessing radiohalos. a correlation between the 1.4 ghz power (p_{1.4}) of the radio halo (orrelic) and the magnitude of the dipole power ratio (p_1/p_0) is discovered suchthat approximately p_{1.4} ~ p_1/p_0; i.e., the strongest radio halos appearonly in those clusters currently experiencing the largest departures from avirialized state. from additional consideration of a small number of highlydisturbed clusters without radio halos detected at 1.4 ghz, and recalling thatradio halos are more common in clusters with high x-ray luminosity (giovannini,tordi, &amp; feretti), we argue that radio halos form preferentially in massive(l_x &gt;~ 0.5 x 10^{45} erg/s) clusters experiencing violent mergers (p_1/p_0 &gt;~0.5 x 10^{-4}) that have seriously disrupted the cluster core. the associationof radio halos with massive, large-p_1/p_0, core-disrupted clusters is able toaccount for both the vital role of mergers in accelerating the relativisticparticles responsible for the radio emission as well as the rare occurrence ofradio halos in cluster samples.

astro-ph;0205362	xmm-newton and chandra observations of the galaxy group ngc 5044. i.  evidence for limited multi-phase hot gas	using new xmm and chandra observations we present an analysis of thetemperature structure of the hot gas within a radius of 100 kpc of the brightnearby galaxy group ngc 5044. a spectral deprojection analysis of dataextracted from circular annuli reveals that a two-temperature model (2t) of thehot gas is favored over single-phase or cooling flow (m_dot = 4.5 +/- 0.2m_{sun}/yr) models within the central ~30 kpc. alternatively, the data can befit equally well if the temperature within each spherical shell variescontinuously from ~t_h to t_c ~ t_h/2, but no lower. the high spatialresolution of the chandra data allows us to determine that the temperatureexcursion t_h --&gt; t_c required in each shell exceeds the temperature rangebetween the boundaries of the same shell in the best-fitting single-phasemodel. this is strong evidence for a multi-phase gas having a limitedtemperature range. the cooler component of the 2t model has a temperature (t_c\~ 0.7 kev) similar to the kinetic temperature of the stars. the hot phase hasa temperature (t_h ~ 1.4 kev) characteristic of the virial temperature of the\~10^{13} m_{sun} halo expected in the ngc 5044 group. however, in view of themorphological disturbances and x-ray holes visible in the chandra image withinr ~10 kpc, bubbles of gas heated to ~t_h in this region may be formed byintermittent agn feedback. some additional heating at larger radii may beassociated with the evolution of the cold front near r ~50 kpc, as suggested bythe sharp edge in the epic images.

astro-ph;0205374	chandra observations of abell 2029: no cooling flow and a steep  abundance gradient	we have obtained high spatial resolution temperature and abundance profilesfor the galaxy cluster abell 2029 with the chandra acis-s instrument. ourobservations reveal that the spectra are well-fit by a single-phase gas in eachannulus. while the temperature of the intracluster medium drops from ~9 kev at3 arcmin (260 kpc) to 3 kev in the central 5 arcsec (5 kpc) of the cluster,there is no evidence for gas emitting at temperatures below 3 kev. the additionof a cooling flow component does not improve the fits, despite previous claimsfor a massive cooling flow. there is also no evidence for excess absorptionabove the galactic n_h value. we also observe a steep fe abundance gradient,such that z_fe &gt;= 2 z_solar (assuming meteoritic solar fe abundance) in thecore, consistent with significant enrichment from fe-rich type ia supernovae inthe cd galaxy. the fe abundance drops to ~0.5 z_solar at 3 arcmin (260 kpc), ingood agreement with previous bepposax measurements. the high resolution imagereveals neither a strong central point source, nor any filamentary structurerelated to a cooling flow or a merger. the absence of a strong merger signatureargues against the creation of the wide-angle-tail radio source morphology in amerger event.

astro-ph;0205469	chandra evidence for a flattened, triaxial dark matter halo in the  elliptical galaxy ngc 720	(abridged) we present an analysis of a chandra acis-s observation of theelliptical galaxy ngc 720 to verify the existence of a dark matter (dm) haloand to measure its ellipticity. the acis-s3 image reveals over 60 pointsources. for semi-major axes a&lt;~150" (18.2h_{70}^{-1} kpc) the ellipticity ofthe diffuse emission is ex ~0.15, which is less than the values 0.2-0.3obtained from rosat because the point sources contaminated the rosat values.the chandra data confirm the ~20 deg position angle (pa) twist discovered byrosat, but the chandra twist is more gradual also because of the point sourcescontaminating the rosat values. overall the ex and pa values for a&lt;~150" can beexplained by the triaxial model of ngc 720 published by romanowsky &amp; kochanek.since the optical image displays no substantial isophote twisting, the x-ray patwist requires a massive dm halo if the hot gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium.the mass-follows-light hypothesis is also inconsistent with the chandraellipticities at the 96% (98%) level for oblate (prolate) symmetry. thus, boththe pa twist and the ellipticities of the chandra image imply a dm haloindependent of the gas t profile -- evidence that cannot be obviated byalternative gravity theories such as mond. the dm density model, rho ~a^{-2},provides the best fit and gives ellipticities of 0.37 +/- 0.03 (0.36 +/- 0.02)for oblate (prolate) models. these moderate ellipticities for the dm halo areinconsistent with both the nearly spherical halos predicted if the dm isself-interacting and with the highly flattened halos predicted if the dm iscold molecular gas. these ellipticities may also be too large to be explainedby warm dm, but are consistent with galaxy-sized halos formed in the lambda-cdmparadigm.

astro-ph;0206422	an xmm-newton observation of ngc 1399 reveals two phases of hot gas and  super-solar abundances in the central regions	we present an initial analysis of a new xmm observation of ngc 1399, thecentral elliptical galaxy of the fornax group. spectral fitting of thespatially resolved spectral data of the epic mos and pn ccds reveals that atwo-temperature model (2t) of the hot gas is favored over single-phase andcooling flow models within the central ~20 kpc. the preference for the 2t modelapplies whether or not the data are deprojected. the cooler component has atemperature (~0.9 kev) similar to the kinetic temperature of the stars whilethe hotter component has a temperature (~1.5 kev) characteristic of the virialtemperature of a ~10^{13} m_sun halo. the two-phase model (and othermultitemperature models) removes the ``fe bias'' within r &lt; ~20 kpc and givesz_fe/z_sun 1.5-2. at larger radii the iron abundance decreases until z_fe/z_sun\~0.5 for r ~50 kpc. the si abundance is super-solar (1.2-1.7 solar) within thecentral regions while z_si/z_fe ~0.8 over the entire region studied. these feand si abundances imply that ~80% of the fe mass within r ~50 kpc originatesfrom type ia supernovae (snia). this snia fraction is similar to that inferredfor the sun and therefore suggests a stellar initial mass function similar tothe milky way.

astro-ph;0209205	chandra observations of abell 2029: the dark matter profile down to  &lt;0.01 r_vir in an unusually relaxed cluster	we have used a high resolution chandra observation to examine the core massdistribution of the unusually regular cd cluster abell 2029. this system isespecially well-suited for analysis of its mass distribution under theassumption of hydrostatic equilibrium: it exhibits an undisturbed x-raymorphology and a single-phase icm. we estimate the total mass, and thecontributions of the gas and dark matter components from &lt;3 arcsec to ~3 arcmin(&lt;4.4-260 kpc, 0.001-0.1 r_vir). the gas density is well fitted by either adouble beta-model, or a ``cusped'' beta-model. the temperature data areincreasing, and can be approximated by a power-law, with alpha_t = 0.27+/-0.01.  fitting smooth functions to density and t, we obtain a mass profile, which isremarkably well described down to 0.002 r_vir by the nfw model, for which wemeasure r_scale = 540+/-90 kpc (~0.2 r_vir) and c = 4.4 +/- 0.9. the massprofile is also approximated by a power-law fit with alpha_m = 1.81+/-0.04(corresponding to a logarithmic density slope of -1.19+/-0.04). the densityprofile is too shallow to be fitted with a moore et al. model. the consistencywith nfw at &lt;0.01 r_vir is incompatible with sidm, and contrasts with theresults from rotation curves of lsb and dwarf galaxies. this suggests thatwhile cdm may adequately describe clusters, it does not currently accountproperly for small halos.  using the cd light, we observe a total m/l_v ~ 12 at r &lt; 20 kpc, rising to &gt;100 beyond 200 kpc. the consistency with an nfw halo model and the large m/lsuggest the cluster is dm-dominated down to &lt;~ 0.005 r_vir. we observe a gasmass fraction = 0.139+/-0.004 at the limit of our observations, finding anupper limit to omega_m &lt;= 0.29+/-0.03 (abridged).

astro-ph;0306535	circulation flows: cooling flows with bubble return	the failure of the xmm-newton and chandra x-ray telescopes to detect coolinggas in elliptical galaxies and clusters of galaxies has led many to adopt theposition that the gas is not cooling at all and that heating by an activenucleus in the central e or cd galaxy is sufficient to offset radiativecooling. in this paper we explore an idealized limiting example of this pointof view in which hot, buoyant bubbles formed near the center return theinflowing, radiatively cooling gas to distant regions in the flow. we show thatidealized steady state, centrally heated non-cooling flows can indeed beconstructed. in addition, the emission-weighted temperature profiles in thesecirculating flows resemble those of normal cooling flows. however, thesesolutions are valid only (1) for a range of bubble parameters for which thereis no independent justification, (2) for a limited spatial region in thecooling flow and (3) for a limited period of time after which cooling seemsinevitable. our exploration of non-cooling flows is set in the context ofgalaxy/group flows.

astro-ph;0501360	the evolution of structure in x-ray clusters of galaxies	using chandra archival data, we quantify the evolution of cluster morphologywith redshift. clusters form and grow through mergers with other clusters andgroups, and the amount of substructure in clusters in the present epoch and howquickly it evolves with redshift depend on the underlying cosmology. our sampleincludes 40 x-ray selected, luminous clusters from the chandra archive, and wequantify cluster morphology using the power ratio method (buote &amp; tsai 1995).the power ratios are constructed from the moments of the x-ray surfacebrightness and are related to a cluster's dynamical state. we find that, asexpected qualitatively from hierarchical models of structure formation,high-redshift clusters have more substructure and are dynamically more activethan low-redshift clusters. specifically, the clusters with z&gt;0.5 havesignificantly higher average third and fourth order power ratios than the lowerredshift clusters. of the power ratios, $p_3/p_0$ is the most unambiguousindicator of an asymmetric cluster structure, and the difference in $p_3/p_0$between the two samples remains significant even when the effects of noise andother systematics are considered. after correcting for noise, we apply a linearfit to $p_3/p_0$ versus redshift and find that the slope is greater than zeroat better than 99% confidence. this observation of structure evolutionindicates that dynamical state may be an important systematic effect in clusterstudies seeking to constrain cosmology, and when calibrated against numericalsimulations, structure evolution will itself provide interesting bounds oncosmological models.

astro-ph;0508226	the shape of galaxy cluster dark matter haloes: systematics of its  imprint on cluster gas, and comparison to observations	(abridged) we study predictions for galaxy cluster observables that can testthe statistics of dark matter halo shapes expected in a flat lcdm universe. wepresent a simple analytical model for the prediction of cluster-scale x-rayobservations, approximating clusters as isothermal systems in hydrostaticequilibrium, and dark matter haloes as ellipsoids with uniform axial ratios. wetest the model against high-resolution, hydrodynamic cluster simulations togauge its reliability. we find that this simple prescription does a good job ofpredicting the distribution of cluster x-ray ellipticities compared to thesimulations as long as one focuses on cluster regions that are less sensitiveto recent mergers. based on this simple model, the distribution of cluster-sizehalo shapes expected in the concordance lcdm cosmology implies an x-rayellipticity distribution with a mean of 0.32 +- 0.01 and a scatter of 0.14 +-0.01 for the mass range (1-4)x10^{14} msun/h. we find it important to includethe mass dependence of halo shape to make comparisons to observational samplesthat contain many, very massive clusters. we analyse the systematics of fourobservational samples of cluster ellipticities and find that our results arestatistically compatible with observations. in particular, we find remarkablygood agreement between two recent rosat samples and lcdm predictions that donot include gas cooling. we also test how well our analytical model can predictsunyaev-zel'dovich decrement maps and find that it is less successful althoughstill useful; the model does not perform as well as a function of flux level inthis case because of the changing triaxiality of dark matter haloes as afunction of radial distance. both this effect and the changing alignment ofisodensity shells of dark matter haloes leave an imprint on cluster gas...

astro-ph;0602613	the absence of adiabatic contraction of the radial dark matter profile  in the galaxy cluster a2589	we present an x-ray analysis of the radial mass profile of the radio-quietgalaxy cluster a2589 between 0.015-0.25 r_vir using an xmm-newton observation.except for a ~16 kpc shift of the x-ray center of the r=45-60 kpc annulus,a2589 possesses a remarkably symmetrical x-ray image and is therefore anexceptional candidate for precision studies of its mass profile by applyinghydrostatic equilibrium. the total gravitating matter profile is well describedby the nfw model (fractional residuals &lt;~10%) with c_vir=6.1 +/- 0.3 and m_vir= 3.3 +/- 0.3 x 10^{14} m_sun (r_vir = 1.74 +/- 0.05 mpc) in excellentagreement with lcdm. when the mass of the hot icm is subtracted from thegravitating matter profile, the nfw model fitted to the resulting dark matter(dm) profile produces essentially the same result. however, if a componentaccounting for the stellar mass (m_*) of the cd galaxy is included, then thenfw fit to the dm profile is substantially degraded in the central r ~50 kpcfor reasonable m_*/l_v. modifying the nfw dm halo by adiabatic contractionarising from the early condensation of stellar baryons in the cd galaxy furtherdegrades the fit. the fit is improved substantially with a sersic-like modelrecently suggested by high resolution n-body simulations but with an inversesersic index, alpha ~0.5, a factor of ~3 higher than predicted. we argue thatneither random turbulent motions nor magnetic fields can provide sufficientnon-thermal pressure support to reconcile the xmm mass profile with adiabaticcontraction of a cdm halo assuming reasonable m_*/l_v. our results support thescenario where, at least for galaxy clusters, processes during halo formationcounteract adiabatic contraction so that the total gravitating mass in the coreapproximately follows the nfw profile.

astro-ph;9502002	quantifying the morphologies and dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters.  i. the method	we describe and test a method to quantitatively classify clusters of galaxiesaccording to their projected morphologies. this method will be subsequentlyused to place constraints on cosmological parameters ($\omega$ and the powerspectrum of primordial fluctuations on scales at or slightly smaller than thatof clusters) and to test theories of cluster formation. we specifically addressstructure that is easily discernible in projection and dynamically important tothe cluster. the method is derived from the two-dimensional multipole expansionof the projected gravitational potential and yields dimensionless {\it powerratios} as morphological statistics. if the projected mass profile is used tocharacterize the cluster morphology, the power ratios are directly related tothe cluster potential. however, since detailed mass profiles currently existfor only a few clusters, we use the x-ray--emitting gas as an alternativetracer of cluster morphology. in this case, the relation of the power ratios tothe potential is qualitatively preserved. we demonstrate the feasibility of themethod by analyzing simulated observations of simple models of x-ray clustersusing the instrument parameters of the rosat pspc. for illustrative purposes,we apply the method to rosat pspc images of a85, a514, a1750, and a2029. theseclusters, which differ substantially in their x-ray morphologies, are easilydistinguished by their respective power ratios. we discuss the suitability ofthis method to address the connection between cluster morphology and cosmologyand to assess whether an individual cluster is sufficiently relaxed foranalysis of its intrinsic shape using hydrostatic methods. approximately 50x-ray observations of abell clusters with the pspc will be amenable tomorphological analysis using the method of this paper.

(the derived e_{mass} range is very insensitive to these issues.)our spatial analysis also indicates that the allowed contribution to the rosatemission from a population of discrete sources with sigma_x propto sigma_r issignificantly less than that indicated by the hard spectral component measuredby asca.

astro-ph;9804290	x-ray emission line ratios and multiphase gas in elliptical galaxies and  galaxy clusters	we examine the k shell emission lines produced by isothermal and simplemultiphase models of the hot gas in elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters todetermine the most effective means for constraining the width of thedifferential emission measure (xi(t)) in these systems which we characterize bya dimensionless parameter, sigma_xi. comparison of line ratios oftwo-temperature (sigma_xi &lt;&lt; 1) and cooling flow (sigma_xi ~1) models ispresented in detail. we find that a two-temperature model can approximate veryaccurately a cooling flow spectrum over 0.5-10 kev.  we have re-analyzed the asca spectra of three of the brightest galaxyclusters to assess the evidence for multiphase gas in their cores: m87 (virgo),the centaurus cluster, and the perseus cluster. k-alpha emission line blends ofsi, s, ar, ca, and fe are detected in each system as is significant fe k-betaemission. the fe k-beta/k-alpha ratios are consistent with optically thinplasma models and do not suggest resonance scattering in these systems.consideration of both the ratios of h-like to he-like k-alpha lines and thelocal continuum temperatures clearly rules out isothermal gas in each case. toobtain more detailed constraints we fitted plasma models over 1.6-9 kev wherethe emission is dominated by these k shell lines and by continuum. in each casethe asca spectra cannot determine whether the gas emits at only twotemperatures or over a continuous range of temperatures as expected for acooling flow. the metal abundances are near solar for all of the multiphasemodels. we discuss the implications of these results and examine the prospectsfor determining the temperature structure in these systems with upcoming x-raymissions.

astro-ph;9811080	x-ray evidence for multiphase hot gas with solar abundances in the  brightest elliptical galaxies	we examine whether isothermal models of the hot gas can successfully describethe asca and rosat spectra of ngc 1399, ngc 4472, ngc 4636, and ngc 5044.broad-band spectral fitting of the asca sis and gis data accumulated within aradius of ~5 arcmin for each galaxy shows that isothermal models are unable tofit the sis data near 1 kev. in addition, these isothermal models typicallyfail to produce the large equivalent widths of the k-alpha line blends of theh-like and he-like ions of si and s which are measured independently of the fel emission lines. two-temperature models provide excellent broad-band fits toboth the sis and gis data of each galaxy with the relative abundances (exceptfor ngc 4636) fixed at their solar values. a simple multiphase cooling flowmodel fits nearly as well as the two-temperature model for ngc 1399, ngc 4472,and ngc 5044. the multiphase models also predict more accurately the si and sequivalent widths and the ratios of si xiv/xiii and s xvi/xv than theisothermal models.  using various approaches we find that the temperature gradients inferred fromthe rosat pspc data of these galaxies, especially for ngc 1399 and ngc 5044,are inconsistent with the isothermal models derived from fitting the asca datawithin a single-aperture but are very consistent with the multiphase models.therefore, models which assume isothermal gas within r ~5 arcmin areinconsistent with both the asca and rosat pspc data of these ellipticalgalaxies. simple two-temperature models and multiphase cooling flows providegood descriptions of these data sets with fe abundances of ~1-2 solar and(except for ngc 4636) relative abundances fixed at their solar values. wediscuss the implications of these nearly solar abundances.

astro-ph;9903278	x-ray evidence for multiphase hot gas with nearly solar fe abundances in  the brightest groups of galaxies	we analyze the asca spectra accumulated within ~100 kpc radii of 12 of thebrightest groups of galaxies. upon fitting isothermal models (1t) jointly tothe asca sis and gis spectra we obtain fits for most groups that are of poor orat best marginal quality and give very sub-solar metallicities similar toprevious studies, &lt;z&gt; = 0.29 +/- 0.12 z_sun. two-temperature models (2t)provide significantly better fits for 11 out of the 12 groups and in every casehave metallicities that are substantially larger than obtained for the 1tmodels, &lt;z&gt; = 0.75 +/- 0.24 z_sun. although not very well constrained, for mostof the groups absorption in excess of the galactic value is indicated for thecooler temperature component of the 2t models. a simple multiphase cooling flowmodel gives results analogous to the 2t models including large metallicities,&lt;z&gt; = 0.65 +/- 0.17 z_sun. the nearly solar fe abundances and also solaralpha/fe ratios indicated by the 2t and cooling flow models are consistent withmodels of the chemical enrichment of ellipticals, groups, and clusters whichassume ratios of type ia to type ii supernova and an imf similar to those ofthe milky way.  thus, we have shown that the very sub-solar fe abundances and si/feenhancements obtained from most previous studies within r ~100 kpc of galaxygroups are an artifact of their fitting isothermal models to the x-ray spectrawhich also has been recently demonstrated for the brightest ellipticalgalaxies. owing to the importance of these results for interpreting x-rayspectra, in an appendix we use simulated asca observations to examine in detailthe ``fe bias'' and ``si bias'' associated with the spectral fitting ofellipticals, groups, and clusters of galaxies.

0811.2796	chi-square and poissonian data: biases even in the high-count regime and  how to avoid them	we demonstrate that two approximations to the chi^2 statistic as popularlyemployed by observational astronomers for fitting poisson-distributed data cangive rise to intrinsically biased model parameter estimates, even in the highcounts regime, unless care is taken over the parameterization of the problem.for a small number of problems, previous studies have shown that the fractionalbias introduced by these approximations is often small when the counts arehigh. however, we show that for a broad class of problem, unless the number ofdata bins is far smaller than \sqrt{n_c}, where n_c is the total number ofcounts in the dataset, the bias will still likely be comparable to, or evenexceed, the statistical error. conversely, we find that fits using cash'sc-statistic give comparatively unbiased parameter estimates when the counts arehigh. taking into account their well-known problems in the low count regime, weconclude that these approximate chi^2 methods should not routinely be used forfitting an arbitrary, parameterized model to poisson-distributed data,irrespective of the number of counts per bin, and instead the c-statisticshould be adopted. we discuss several practical aspects of using thec-statistic in modelling real data. we illustrate the bias for two specificproblems, measuring the count-rate from a lightcurve and obtaining thetemperature of a thermal plasma from its x-ray spectrum measured with thechandra x-ray observatory. in the context of x-ray astronomy, we argue the biascould give rise to systematically mis-calibrated satellites and a ~5-10% shiftin galaxy cluster scaling relations.
