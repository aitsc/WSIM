0706.4088	a study of the type ia/iin supernova 2005gj from x-ray to the infrared:  paper i	we present extensive ugrizyhjk photometry and optical spectroscopy of sn2005gj obtained by the sdss-ii and csp supernova projects, which give excellentcoverage during the first 150 days after the time of explosion. these data showthat sn 2005gj is the second clear case, after sn 2002ic, of a thermonuclearexplosion in a dense circumstellar environment. both the presence of singly anddoubly ionized iron-peak elements (feiii and weak sii, siii) near maximum lightas well as the spectral evolution show that sn 2002ic-like events are type iaexplosions. independent evidence comes from the exponential decay in luminosityof sn 2005gj, pointing to an exponential density distribution of the ejecta.the interaction of the supernova ejecta with the dense circumstellar medium isstronger than in sn 2002ic: (1) the supernova lines are weaker; (2) the balmeremission lines are more luminous; and (3) the bolometric luminosity is higherclose to maximum light. the velocity evolution of the halpha components suggestthat the csm around sn 2005gj is clumpy and it has a flatter densitydistribution compared with the steady wind solution, in agreement with sn2002ic. an early x-ray observation with chandra gives an upper-limit on themass loss rate from the companion of &lt; 2x10^{-4} msun/yr.

0907.4524	the carnegie supernova project: first near-infrared hubble diagram to  z~0.7	the carnegie supernova project (csp) is designed to measure the luminositydistance for type ia supernovae (sne ia) as a function of redshift, and to setobservational constraints on the dark energy contribution to the total energycontent of the universe. the csp differs from other projects to date in itsgoal of providing an i-band {rest-frame} hubble diagram. here we present thefirst results from near-infrared (nir) observations obtained using the magellanbaade telescope for sne ia with 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.7. we combine these results withthose from the low-redshift csp at z &lt;0.1 (folatelli et al. 2009). we presentlight curves and an i-band hubble diagram for this first sample of 35 sne iaand we compare these data to 21 new sne ia at low redshift. these data supportthe conclusion that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. whencombined with independent results from baryon acoustic oscillations (eisensteinet al. 2005), these data yield omega_m = 0.27 +/- 0.0 (statistical), andomega_de = 0.76 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09 (systematic), for the matterand dark energy densities, respectively. if we parameterize the data in termsof an equation of state, w, assume a flat geometry, and combine with baryonacoustic oscillations, we find that w = -1.05 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09(systematic). the largest source of systematic uncertainty on w arises fromuncertainties in the photometric calibration, signaling the importance ofsecuring more accurate photometric calibrations for future supernova cosmologyprograms. finally, we conclude that either the dust affecting the luminositiesof sne ia has a different extinction law (r_v = 1.8) than that in the milky way(where r_v = 3.1), or that there is an additional intrinsic color term withluminosity for sne ia independent of the decline rate.

0908.0537	the normal type ia sn 2003hv out to very late phases	an extensive dataset for sn 2003hv that covers the flux evolution frommaximum light to day +786 is presented. the data are combined with publishednebular-phase infrared spectra, and the observations are compared to modellight curves and synthetic nebular spectra. sn 2003hv is a normal type iasupernova (sn ia) with photometric and spectroscopic properties consistent withits rarely observed b-band decline-rate parameter, delta m_15 = 1.61 +- 0.02.the blueshift of the most isolated [fe ii] lines in the nebular-phase opticalspectrum appears consistent with those observed in the infrared at similarepochs. at late times there is a prevalent color evolution from the opticaltoward the near-infrared bands. we present the latest-ever detection of a sn iain the near-infrared in hubble space telescope images. the study of theultraviolet/optical/infrared (uvoir) light curve reveals that a substantialfraction of the flux is "missing" at late times. between 300-700 days pastmaximum brightness, the uvoir light curve declines linearly following the decayof radioactive co56, assuming full and instantaneous positron trapping. at 700days we detect a possible slowdown of the decline in optical bands, mainly inthe v band. the data are incompatible with a dramatic infrared catastrophe.however, the idea that an infrared catastrophe occurred in the densest regionsbefore 350 days can explain the missing flux from the uvoir wavelengths and theflat-topped profiles in the near-infrared. we argue that such a scenario ispossible if the ejecta are clumpy. the observations suggest that positrons aremost likely trapped in the ejecta.

0910.3317	the carnegie supernova project: analysis of the first sample of  low-redshift type-ia supernovae	we present the analysis of the first set of low-redshift type ia supernovae(sne ia) by the carnegie supernova project. well-sampled, high-precisionoptical (ugribv) and near-infrared (nir; yjhks) light curves obtained in awell-understood photometric system are used to provide light-curve parameters,and ugribvyjh template light curves. the intrinsic colors at maximum light arecalibrated to compute optical--nir color excesses for the full sample, thusallowing the properties of the reddening law in the host galaxies to bestudied. a low value of rv~1.7, is derived when using the entire sample of sne.however, when the two highly reddened sne in the sample are excluded, a valuegalactic standard of rv~3.2 is obtained. the colors of these two events arewell matched by a reddening model due to circumstellar dust. the peakluminosities are calibrated using a two-parameter linear fit to the declinerates and the colors, or alternatively, the color excesses. in both cases,dispersions in absolute magnitude of 0.12--0.16 mag are obtained, depending onthe filter-color combination. in contrast to the results obtained from colorexcesses, these fits give rv~1--2, even when the two highly reddened sne areexcluded. this discrepancy suggests that, beyond the "normal" interstellarreddening produced in the host galaxies, there is an intrinsic dispersion inthe colors of sne ia which is correlated with luminosity but independent of thedecline rate. finally, a hubble diagram is produced by combining the results ofthe fits for each filter. the resulting scatter of 0.12 mag appears to belimited by peculiar velocities as evidenced by the strong correlation betweenthe distance-modulus residuals among the different filters. the implication isthat the actual precision of sn ia distances is 3--4%.

1010.4040	the carnegie supernova project: light curve fitting with snoopy	in providing an independent measure of the expansion history of the universe,the carnegie supernova project (csp) has observed 71 high-z type ia supernovae(sne ia) in the near-infrared bands y and j. these can be used to constructrest-frame i-band light curves which, when compared to a low-z sample, yielddistance moduli that are less sensitive to extinction and/or decline-ratecorrections than in the optical. however, working with nir observed and i-bandrest frame photometry presents unique challenges and has necessitated thedevelopment of a new set of observational tools in order to reduce and analyzeboth the low-z and high-z csp sample. we present in this paper the methods usedto generate ubvgriyjh light-curve templates based on a sample of 24high-quality low-z csp sne. we also present two methods for determining thedistances to the hosts of sn ia events. a larger sample of 30 low-z sne ia inthe hubble flow are used to calibrate these methods. we then apply the methodand derive distances to seven galaxies that are so nearby that their motionsare not dominated by the hubble flow.

1011.6126	sn 2009bb: a peculiar broad-lined type ic supernova	ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared photometry and optical spectroscopyof the broad-lined type ic supernova (sn) 2009bb are presented, following theflux evolution from -10 to +285 days past b-band maximum. thanks to the veryearly discovery, it is possible to place tight constraints on the sn explosionepoch. the expansion velocities measured from near maximum spectra are found tobe only slightly smaller than those measured from spectra of the prototypebroad-lined sn 1998bw associated with grb 980425. fitting an analytical modelto the pseudo-bolometric light curve of sn 2009bb suggests that 4.1+-1.9 msunof material was ejected with 0.22 +-0.06 msun of it being 56ni. the resultingkinetic energy is 1.8+-0.7x10^52 erg. this, together with an absolute peakmagnitude of mb=-18.36+-0.44, places sn 2009bb on the energetic and luminousend of the broad-lined type ic (sn ic) sequence. detection of helium in theearly time optical spectra accompanied with strong radio emission, and highmetallicity of its environment makes sn 2009bb a peculiar object. similar tothe case for grbs, we find that the bulk explosion parameters of sn 2009bbcannot account for the copious energy coupled to relativistic ejecta, andconclude that another energy reservoir (a central engine) is required to powerthe radio emission. nevertheless, the analysis of the sn 2009bb nebularspectrum suggests that the failed grb detection is not imputable to a largeangle between the line-of-sight and the grb beamed radiation. therefore, if agrb was produced during the sn 2009bb explosion, it was below the threshold ofthe current generation of gamma-ray instruments.

1110.3789	unburned material in the ejecta of type ia supernovae	(abridged) the presence of unburned material in the ejecta of normal type iasupernovae (sneia) is investigated using early-time spectroscopy obtained bythe csp. the tell-tale signature of pristine material from a c+o white dwarfprogenitor star is the presence of carbon. the most prominent carbon lines inoptical spectra of sneia are due to c ii. we find that at least 30% of theobjects in the sample show an absorption at ~6300 aa which is attributed to cii 6580. an association to h_alpha is considered to be unlikely. these findingsimply a larger incidence of carbon in sneia ejecta than previously noted. weshow how observational biases and physical conditions may hide these c iilines, and account for the scarcity of previous carbon detections. thisrelatively large frequency of carbon detections has crucial implications on ourunderstanding of the explosive process. the observations indicate that carbonis present merely ~1000 km s^-1 above the bulk of si ii. spectral modelingshows the detections are consistent with a mass of carbon of 10^-3--10^-2m_sun. this would imply substantial mixing, which may be related to asymmetriesof the flame propagation or clumps of unburned material along the line ofsight. however, the uniformity of the relation between c ii and si iivelocities is not consistent with the latter scenario. the observationalproperties of sneia with and without carbon signatures are compared. a trendtoward bluer color and lower luminosity is found for objects with carbon.

1201.2913	the standardizability of type ia supernovae in the near-infrared:  evidence for a peak luminosity-decline rate relation in the near-infrared	we analyze the standardizability of type ia supernovae (sne ia) in thenear-infrared (nir) by investigating the correlation between observed peak nirabsolute magnitude and post-maximum b-band decline rate. a sample of 27low-redshift sne ia observed by the carnegie supernova project between 2004 to2007 is used. all 27 objects have pre-maximum coverage in optical bands, with asubset of 13 having pre-maximum nir observations as well. we describe themethods used to derive absolute peak magnitudes and decline rates from bothspline- and template-fitting procedures, and confirm prior findings thatfitting templates to sne ia light curves in the nir is problematic due to thediversity of post-maximum behaviour of objects that are characterized bysimilar decline rate values, especially at high decline rates. nevertheless, weshow that nir light curves can be reasonably fit with a template, especially ifthe observations begin within 5 days after nir maximum. for the subset of 13objects in our dataset that excludes the highly reddened and fast declining sneia, and includes only those objects for which nir observations began prior tofive days after maximum light, we find modest evidence for a peakluminosity-decline rate relation in y, and stronger evidence in j and h. usingrv values differing from the canonical value of 3.1 is shown to have littleeffect on the results. a hubble diagram is presented for the nir bands and theb band. the resulting scatter for the combined nir bands is 0.13 mag, while theb band produces a scatter of 0.22 mag. the data suggest that applying acorrection to sne ia peak luminosities for decline rate is likely to bebeneficial in the j and h bands to make sne ia more precise distanceindicators, but of only marginal importance in the y band.

(2011). this coincidence suggeststhat outflowing circumstellar gas is responsible for at least some of the casesof anomalously large na i column densities. two supernovae with unusuallystrong na i d absorption showed essentially normal k i column densities for thedust extinction implied by their colors, but this does not appear to be auniversal characteristic. overall, we find the most accurate predictor ofindividual supernova extinction to be the equivalent width of the diffuseinterstellar band at 5780 angstroms, and provide an empirical relation for itsuse. finally, we identify ways of producing significant enhancements of the naabundance of circumstellar material in both the single-degenerate anddouble-degenerate scenarios for the progenitor system.

1311.4525	optical and near-ir observations of the faint and fast 2008ha-like  supernova 2010ae	a comprehensive set of optical and near-infrared (nir) photometry andspectroscopy is presented for the faint and fast 2008ha-like supernova (sn)2010ae. contingent on the adopted value of host extinction, sn 2010ae reached apeak brightness of -13.8 &gt; m_v &gt; -15.3 mag, while modeling of the uvoir lightcurve suggests it produced 0.003--0.007 m_sun of (56)ni, ejected 0.30--0.60m_sun of material, and had an explosion energy of 0.04--0.30x10^51 erg. thevalues of these explosion parameters are similar to the peculiar sn 2008ha--for which we also present previously unpublished early phase optical and nirlight curves-- and places these two transients at the faint end of the2002cx-like sn population. detailed inspection of the post maximum nirspectroscopic sequence indicates the presence of a multitude of spectralfeatures, which are identified through synapps modeling to be mainly attributedto co ii. comparison with a collection of published and unpublished nir spectraof other 2002cx-like sne, reveals that a co ii footprint is ubiquitous to thissubclass of transients, providing a link to type ia sne. a visual-wavelengthspectrum of sn 2010ae obtained at +252 days past maximum shows a strikingresemblance to a similar epoch spectrum of sn 2002cx. however, subtledifferences in the strength and ratio of calcium emission features, as well asdiversity among similar epoch spectra of other 2002cx-like sne indicates arange of physical conditions of the ejecta, highlighting the heterogeneousnature of this peculiar class of transients.

1401.2368	sn2011hs: a fast and faint type iib supernova from a supergiant  progenitor	observations spanning a large wavelength range, from x-ray to radio, of thetype iib supernova 2011hs are presented, covering its evolution during thefirst year after explosion. the optical light curve presents a narrower shapeand a fainter luminosity at peak than previously observed for type iib sne.high expansion velocities are measured from the broad absorption h i and he ilines. from the comparison of the bolometric light curve and the time evolutionof the photospheric velocities with hydrodynamical models, we found that sn2011hs is consistent with the explosion of a 3-4 msun he-core progenitor star,corresponding to a main sequence mass of 12-15 msun, that ejected a mass of56ni of about 0.04 msun, with an energy of e= 8.5 x 10^50 erg. such a low-massprogenitor scenario is in full agreement with the modelling of the nebularspectrum taken at $\sim$215 days from maximum. from the modelling of theadiabatic cooling phase, we infer a progenitor radius of $\approx$500-600 rsun,clearly pointing to an extended progenitor star. the radio light curve of sn2011hs yields a peak luminosity similar to that of sn 1993j, but with a highermass loss rate and a wind density possibly more similar to that of sn 2001ig.although no significant deviations from a smooth decline have been found in theradio light curves, we cannot rule out the presence of a binary companion star.

1403.1167	type ii-plateau supernovae as metallicity probes of the universe	we explore a method for metallicity determinations based on quantitativespectroscopy of type ii-plateau (ii-p) supernovae (sne). for consistency, wefirst evolve a set of 15msun main sequence stars at 0.1, 0.4, 1, and 2 x thesolar metallicity. at the onset of core collapse, we trigger a piston-drivenexplosion and model the resulting ejecta and radiation. our theoretical modelsof such red-supergiant-star explosions at different metallicity show thatsynthetic spectra of sne ii-p possess optical signatures during therecombination phase that are sensitive to metallicity variations. thissensitivity can be quantified and the metallicity inferred from the strength ofmetal-line absorptions. furthermore, these signatures are not limited to o, butalso include na, ca, sc, ti, or fe. when compared to a sample of sne ii-p fromthe carnegie sn project and previous sn followup programs, we find that mostevents lie at a metallicity between 0.4 and 2 x solar, with a marked scarcityof sn ii-p events at smc metallicity. this most likely reflects the paucity oflow metallicity star forming regions in the local universe.  sne ii-p have high plateau luminosities that make them observablespectroscopically at large distances. because they exhibit signatures ofdiverse metal species, in the future they may offer a means to constrain theevolution of the composition (e.g., the o/fe ratio) in the universe out to aredshift of one and beyond.

1403.7202	light echoes from eta carinae's great eruption: spectrophotometric  evolution and the rapid formation of nitrogen-rich molecules	we present follow-up optical imaging and spectroscopy of one of the lightechoes of $\eta$ carinae's 19th-century great eruption discovered by rest etal. (2012). by obtaining images and spectra at the same light echo positionbetween 2011 and 2014, we follow the evolution of the great eruption on athree-year timescale. we find remarkable changes in the photometric andspectroscopic evolution of the echo light. the $i$-band light curve shows adecline of $\sim 0.9$ mag in $\sim 1$ year after the peak observed in early2011 and a flattening at later times. the spectra show a pure-absorption earlyg-type stellar spectrum at peak, but a few months after peak the lines of the[ca ii] triplet develop strong p-cygni profiles and we see the appearance of[ca ii] 7291,7324 doublet in emission. these emission features and theirevolution in time resemble those observed in the spectra of some type iinsupernovae and supernova impostors. most surprisingly, starting $\sim 300$ daysafter peak brightness, the spectra show strong molecular transitions of cn at$\gtrsim 6800$ \aa. the appearance of these cn features can be explained if theejecta are strongly nitrogen enhanced, as it is observed in modernspectroscopic studies of the bipolar homunculus nebula. given the spectroscopicevolution of the light echo, velocities of the main features, and detection ofstrong cn, we are likely seeing ejecta that contributes directly to thehomunculus nebula.

1404.1002	early ultraviolet emission in the type ia supernova lsq12gdj: no  evidence for ongoing shock interaction	we present photospheric-phase observations of lsq12gdj, a slowly-declining,uv-bright type ia supernova. classified well before maximum light, lsq12gdj hasextinction-corrected absolute magnitude $m_b = -19.8$, and pre-maximumspectroscopic evolution similar to sn 1991t and the super-chandrasekhar-mass sn2007if. we use ultraviolet photometry from swift, ground-based opticalphotometry, and corrections from a near-infrared photometric template toconstruct the bolometric (1600-23800 \aa) light curve out to 45 days past$b$-band maximum light. we estimate that lsq12gdj produced $0.96 \pm 0.07$$m_\odot$ of $^{56}$ni, with an ejected mass near or slightly above thechandrasekhar mass. as much as 27% of the flux at the earliest observed phases,and 17% at maximum light, is emitted bluewards of 3300 \aa. the absence ofexcess luminosity at late times, the cutoff of the spectral energy distributionbluewards of 3000 \aa, and the absence of narrow line emission and strong na id absorption all argue against a significant contribution from ongoing shockinteraction. however, up to 10% of lsq12gdj's luminosity near maximum lightcould be produced by the release of trapped radiation, including kinetic energythermalized during a brief interaction with a compact, hydrogen-poor envelope(radius $&lt; 10^{13}$ cm) shortly after explosion; such an envelope arisesgenerically in double-degenerate merger scenarios.

1405.3677	extensive hst ultraviolet spectra and multi-wavelength observations of  sn 2014j in m82 indicate reddening and circumstellar scattering by typical  dust	sn 2014j in m82 is the closest detected type ia supernova (sn ia) in at least28 years and perhaps in 410 years. despite its small distance of 3.3 mpc, sn2014j is surprisingly faint, peaking at v = 10.6 mag, and assuming a typical snia luminosity, we infer an observed visual extinction of a_v = 2.0 +/- 0.1 mag.but this picture, with r_v = 1.6 +/- 0.2, is too simple to account for allobservations. we combine 10 epochs (spanning a month) of hst/stis ultravioletthrough near-infrared spectroscopy with hst/wfc3, kait, and fancam photometryfrom the optical to the infrared and 9 epochs of high-resolution tresspectroscopy to investigate the sources of extinction and reddening for sn2014j. we argue that the wide range of observed properties for sn 2014j iscaused by a combination of dust reddening, likely originating in theinterstellar medium of m82, and scattering off circumstellar material. for thismodel, roughly half of the extinction is caused by reddening from typical dust(e(b-v ) = 0.45 mag and r_v = 2.6) and roughly half by scattering off lmc-likedust in the circumstellar environment of sn 2014j.

1405.3934	the carnegie supernova project: intrinsic colors of type ia supernovae	we present an updated analysis of the intrinsic colors of sne ia using thelatest data release of the carnegie supernova project. we introduce a newlight-curve parameter very similar to stretch that is better suited forfast-declining events, and find that these peculiar types can be seen asextensions to the population of "normal" sne ia. with a larger number ofobjects, an updated fit to the lira relation is presented along with evidencefor a dependence on the late-time slope of the b-v color-curves with stretchand color. using the full wavelength range from u to h band, we placeconstraints on the reddening law for the sample as a whole and also forindividual events/hosts based solely on the observed colors. the photometricdata continue to favor low values of rv, though with large variations fromevent to event, indicating an intrinsic distribution. we confirm the findingsof other groups that there appears to be a correlation between the derivedreddening law, rv, and the color excess, e(b-v), such that larger e(b-v) tendsto favor lower rv. the intrinsic u-band colors show a relatively large scatterthat cannot be explained by variations in rv or by the goobar (2008) power-lawfor circumstellar dust, but rather is correlated with spectroscopic features ofthe supernova and is therefore likely due to metallicity effects.

1408.1093	comprehensive observations of the bright and energetic type iax sn  2012z: interpretation as a chandrasekhar mass white dwarf explosion	we present uv through nir broad-band photometry, and optical and nirspectroscopy of type iax supernova 2012z. the data set consists of both earlyand late-time observations, including the first late phase nir spectrumobtained for a spectroscopically classified sn iax. simple model calculationsof its bolometric light curve suggest sn 2012z produced ~0.3 m_sun of (56)ni,ejected about a chandrasekhar mass of material, and had an explosion energy of~10^51 erg, making it one of the brightest and most energetic sn iax yetobserved. the late phase nir spectrum of sn 2012z is found to broadly resemblesimilar epoch spectra of normal sne ia; however, like other sne iax,corresponding visual-wavelength spectra differ substantially compared to allsupernova types. constraints from the distribution of imes, e.g. silicon andmagnesium, indicate that the outer ejecta did not experience significant mixingduring or after burning, and the late phase nir line profiles suggests most ofthe (56)ni is produced during high density burning. the various observationalproperties of sn 2012z are found to be consistent with the theoreticalexpectations of a chandrasekhar mass white dwarf progenitor that experiences apulsational delayed detonation, which produced several tenths of a solar massof (56)ni during the deflagration burning phase and little (or no) (56)niduring the detonation phase. within this scenario only a moderate amount ofrayleigh-taylor mixing occurs both during the deflagration and fallback phaseof the pulsation, and the layered structure of the imes is a product of thesubsequent denotation phase. the fact that the sne iax population does notfollow a tight brightness-decline relation similar to sne ia can then beunderstood in the framework of variable amounts of mixing during pulsationalrebound and variable amounts of (56)ni production during the early subsonicphase of expansion.

0804.4142	improved cosmological constraints from new, old and combined supernova  datasets	we present a new compilation of type ia supernovae (sne ia), a new dataset oflow-redshift nearby-hubble-flow sne and new analysis procedures to work withthese heterogeneous compilations. this ``union'' compilation of 414 sn ia,which reduces to 307 sne after selection cuts, includes the recent largesamples of sne ia from the supernova legacy survey and essence survey, theolder datasets, as well as the recently extended dataset of distant supernovaeobserved with hst. a single, consistent and blind analysis procedure is usedfor all the various sn ia subsamples, and a new procedure is implemented thatconsistently weights the heterogeneous data sets and rejects outliers. wepresent the latest results from this union compilation and discuss thecosmological constraints from this new compilation and its combination withother cosmological measurements (cmb and bao). the constraint we obtain fromsupernovae on the dark energy density is $\omega_\lambda=0.713^{+0.027}_{-0.029} (stat)}^{+0.036}_{-0.039} (sys)}$, for a flat, lcdmuniverse. assuming a constant equation of state parameter, $w$, the combinedconstraints from sne, bao and cmb give$w=-0.969^{+0.059}_{-0.063}(stat)^{+0.063}_{-0.066} (sys)$. while our resultsare consistent with a cosmological constant, we obtain only relatively weakconstraints on a $w$ that varies with redshift. in particular, the current sndata do not yet significantly constrain $w$ at $z&gt;1$. with the addition of ournew nearby hubble-flow sne ia, these resulting cosmological constraints arecurrently the tightest available.

1504.06668	type iib supernova 2013df entering into an interaction phase: a link  between the progenitor and the mass loss	we report the late-time evolution of type iib supernova (sn iib) 2013df. sn2013df showed a dramatic change in its spectral features at ~1 year after theexplosion. early on it showed typical characteristics shared by sne iib/ib/icdominated by metal emission lines, while later on it was dominated by broad andflat-topped halpha and he i emissions. the late-time spectra are strikinglysimilar to sn iib 1993j, which is the only previous example clearly showing thesame transition. this late-time evolution is fully explained by a change in theenergy input from the $^{56}$co decay to the interaction between the sn ejectaand dense circumstellar matter (csm). the mass loss rate is derived to be ~(5.4+- 3.2) x 10^{-5} msun/yr (for the wind velocity of ~20 km/s), similar to sn1993j but larger than sn iib 2011dh by an order of magnitude. the strikingsimilarity between sne 2013df and 1993j in the (candidate) progenitors and thecsm environments, and the contrast in these natures to sn 2011dh, infer thatthere is a link between the natures of the progenitor and the mass loss: sneiib with a more extended progenitor have experienced a much stronger mass lossin the final centuries toward the explosion. it might indicate that sne iibfrom a more extended progenitor are the explosions during a strong binaryinteraction phase, while those from a less extended progenitor have a delaybetween the strong binary interaction and the explosion.

1508.04774	spectral models for early time sn 2011fe observations	we use observed uv through near ir spectra to examine whether sn 2011fe canbe understood in the framework of branch-normal sne ia and to examine itsindividual peculiarities. as a benchmark, we use a delayed-detonation modelwith a progenitor metallicity of z_solar/20. we study the sensitivity offeatures to variations in progenitor metallicity, the outer density profile,and the distribution of radioactive nickel. the effect of metallicityvariations in the progenitor have a relatively small effect on the syntheticspectra. we also find that the abundance stratification of sn 2011fe resemblesclosely that of a delayed detonation model with a transition density that hasbeen fit to other branch-normal type ia supernovae. at early times, the modelphotosphere is formed in material with velocities that are too high, indicatingthat the photosphere recedes too slowly or that sn 2011fe has a lower specificenergy in the outer ~0.1 m_sun than does the model. we discuss severalexplanations for the discrepancies. finally, we examine variations in both thespectral energy distribution and in the colors due to variations in theprogenitor metallicity, which suggests that colors are only weak indicators forthe progenitor metallicity, in the particular explosion model that we havestudied. we do find that the flux in the u band is significantly higher atmaximum light in the solar metallicity model than in the lower metallicitymodel and the lower metallicity model much better matches the observedspectrum.

0807.3955	a new distance to the antennae galaxies (ngc 4038/39) based on the type  ia supernova 2007sr	traditionally, the distance to ngc 4038/39 has been derived from the systemicrecession velocity, yielding about 20 mpc for h_0 = 72 km/s/mpc. recently, thiswidely adopted distance has been challenged based on photometry of the presumedtip of the red giant branch (trgb), which seems to yield a shorter distance of13.3+-1.0 mpc and, with it, nearly 1 mag lower luminosities and smaller radiifor objects in this prototypical merger. here we present a new distanceestimate based on observations of the type ia supernova (sn) 2007sr in thesouthern tail, made at las campanas observatory as part of the carnegiesupernova project. the resulting distance of d(sn ia) = 22.3+-2.8 mpc [(m-m)_0= 31.74+-0.27 mag] is in good agreement with a refined distance estimate basedon the recession velocity and the large-scale flow model developed by tonry andcollaborators, d(flow) = 22.5+-2.8 mpc. we point out three serious problemsthat a short distance of 13.3 mpc would entail, and trace the claimed shortdistance to a likely misidentification of the trgb. reanalyzing hubble spacetelescope (hst) data in the archive with an improved method, we find a trgbfainter by 0.9 mag and derive from it a preliminary new trgb distance ofd(trgb) = 20.0+-1.6 mpc. finally, assessing our three distance estimates werecommend using a conservative, rounded value of d = 22+-3 mpc as the bestcurrently available distance to the antennae.

astro-ph;0001384	tests of the accelerating universe with near-infrared observations of a  high-redshift type ia supernova	we have measured the rest-frame b,v, and i-band light curves of ahigh-redshift type ia supernova (sn ia), sn 1999q (z=0.46), using hst andground-based near-infrared detectors.  a goal of this study is the measurement of the color excess, e_{b-i}, whichis a sensitive indicator of interstellar or intergalactic dust which couldaffect recent cosmological measurements from high-redshift sne ia. ourobservations disfavor a 30% opacity of sn ia visual light by dust as analternative to an accelerating universe. this statement applies to bothgalactic-type dust  (rejected at the 3.4 sigma confidence level) and greyer dust (grain size &gt;0.1 microns; rejected at the 2.3 to 2.6 sigma confidence level) as proposed byaguirre (1999). the rest-frame $i$-band light cur ve shows the secondarymaximum a month after b maximum typical of nearby sne ia of normal luminosi ty,providing no indication of evolution as a function of redshift out to z~0.5. an expanded set of similar observations could improve the constraints on anycontribution of extragalactic dust to the dimming of high-redshift sne ia.

astro-ph;0005213	a search for environmental effects on type ia supernovae	we use integrated colors and b and v absolute magnitudes of type ia supernova(sn) host galaxies in order to search for environmental effects on the snoptical properties. with the new sample of 44 sne we confirm the conclusion byhamuy et al. (1996a) that bright events occur preferentially in young stellarenvironments. we find also that the brightest sne occur in the least luminousgalaxies, a possible indication that metal-poorer neighbourhoods produce themore luminous events. the interpretation of these results is made difficult,however, due to the fact that galaxies with younger stellar populations arealso lower in luminosity. in an attempt to remove this ambiguity we use modelsfor the line strengths in the absorption spectrum of five early-type galaxies,in order to estimate metallicities and ages of the sn host galaxies. with theaddition of abundance estimates from nebular analysis of the emission spectraof three spiral galaxies, we find possible further evidence that luminous sneare produced in metal-poor neighborhoods. further spectroscopic observations ofthe sn host galaxies will be necessary to test these results and assist indisentangling the age/metallicity effects on type ia sne.

astro-ph;0008387	variable galaxies in the hubble deep field	we present results from a study to detect variable galaxies in the hubbledeep field north. the goal of this project is to investigate the number densityof agn at z=1 through the detection of variable galaxy nuclei. the advantage ofhst is the ability to do accurate photometry within smaller apertures, thusallowing us to probe much lower agn/host galaxy luminosity ratios than can bedone from the ground. the primary data sets analyzed for galactic variabilityfollow from the original hdf-n observations in december 1995 and a second epochobtained two years later.  we have detected nuclear variability at or above the 3 sigma level in 8 of633 hdf galaxies at i&lt;27. only 2 detections would be expected by chance in anormal distribution. at least one of these 8 has been spectroscopicallyconfirmed as a seyfert 1 galaxy. based on the agn structure function forvariability, the estimated luminosity of the varying component in each galaxylies in the range -19.5&lt;m&lt;-15.0. we construct an upper limit to the luminosityfunction for the variable nuclei and compare this to the local seyfert lf andthe lf for qsos at z=1. assuming we have detected all seyfert-like nuclei inthe hdf-n, we find no evidence for an increase in the number density of agn atm=-19. we estimate that ~1-3% of field galaxies with i&lt;27 may contain a nuclearagn.

astro-ph;0010614	preliminary spectral analysis of the type ii supernova 1999em	we have calculated fast direct spectral model fits to two early-time spectraof the type-ii plateau sn 1999em, using the synow synthetic spectrum code. thefirst is an extremely early blue optical spectrum and the second a combined hstand optical spectrum obtained one week later. spectroscopically this supernovaappears to be a normal type ii and these fits are in excellent agreement withthe observed spectra. our direct analysis suggests the presence of enhancednitrogen. we have further studied these spectra with the full nlte generalmodel atmosphere code phoenix. while we do not find confirmation for enhancednitrogen (nor do we rule it out), we do require enhanced helium. an even moreintriguing possible line identification is complicated balmer and he i lines,which we show falls naturally out of the detailed calculations with a shallowdensity gradient. we also show that very early spectra such as those presentedhere combined with sophisticated spectral modeling allows an independentestimate of the total reddening to the supernova, since when the spectrum isvery blue, dereddening leads to changes in the blue flux that cannot bereproduced by altering the ``temperature'' of the emitted radiation. theseresults are extremely encouraging since they imply that detailed modeling ofearly spectra can shed light on both the abundances and total extinction of sneii, the latter improving their utility and reliability as distance indicators.

astro-ph;0105006	the distance to sn 1999em from the expanding photosphere method	we present optical and ir spectroscopy of the first two months of evolutionof the type ii sn 1999em. we combine these data with high-quality optical/irphotometry beginning only three days after shock breakout, in order to studythe performance of the ``expanding photosphere method'' (epm) in thedetermination of distances. with this purpose we develop a technique to measureaccurate photospheric velocities by cross-correlating observed and modelspectra. the application of this technique to sn 1999em shows that we can reachan average uncertainty of 11% in velocity from an individual spectrum. ouranalysis shows that epm is quite robust to the effects of dust. in particular,the distances derived from the vi filters change by only 7% when the adoptedvisual extinction in the host galaxy is varied by 0.45 mag. the superb timesampling of the bvizjhk light-curves of sn 1999em permits us to study theinternal consistency of epm and test the dilution factors computed fromatmosphere models for type ii plateau supernovae. we find that, in the firstweek since explosion, the epm distances are up to 50% lower than the average,possibly due the presence of circumstellar material. over the following 65days, on the other hand, our tests lend strong credence to the atmospheremodels, and confirm previous claims that epm can produce consistent distanceswithout having to craft specific models to each supernova. this is particularlytrue for the vi filters which yield distances with an internal consistency of4%. from the whole set of bvizjhk photometry, we obtain an average distance of7.5+/-0.5 mpc, where the quoted uncertainty (7%) is a conservative estimate ofthe internal precision of the method obtained from the analysis of the first 70days of the supernova evolution.

astro-ph;0203346	modelling the hubble space telescope ultraviolet and optical spectrum of  spot 1 on the circumstellar ring of sn 1987a	we report and interpret hst/stis long-slit observations of the optical andultraviolet (1150 - 10270 angstrom) emission-line spectra of the rapidlybrightening spot 1 on the equatorial ring of sn 1987a between 1997 septemberand 1999 october (days 3869 -- 4606 after outburst). the emission is caused byradiative shocks created where the supernova blast wave strikes dense gasprotruding inward from the equatorial ring. we measure and tabulate lineidentifications, fluxes and, in some cases, line widths and shifts. we computeflux correction factors to account for substantial interstellar line absorptionof several emission lines. nebular analysis shows that optical emission linescome from a region of cool (t_e ~ 10^4 k) and dense (n_e ~ 10^6 cm^-3) gas inthe compressed photoionized layer behind the radiative shock. the observed linewidths indicate that only shocks with shock velocities v_s &lt; 250 km/s havebecome radiative, while line ratios indicate that much of the emission musthave come from yet slower (v_s &lt; 135 k/ms) shocks. we are able to fit the uvfluxes with an idealized radiative shock model consisting of two shocks (v_s =135 and 250 km/s). the observed uv flux increase with time can be explained bythe increase in shock surface areas as the blast wave overtakes more of theprotrusion. the observed flux ratios of optical to highly-ionized uv lines aregreater by a factor of ~ 2 -- 3 than predictions from the radiative shockmodels and we discuss the possible causes. we also present models for theobserved h-alpha line widths and profiles, which suggests that a chaotic flowexists in the photoionized regions of these shocks. we discuss what can belearned with future observations of all the spots present on the equatorialring.

astro-ph;0205337	the axially symmetric ejecta of supernova 1987a	extensive early observations proved that the ejecta of supernova 1987a (sn1987a) are aspherical. fifteen years after the supernova explosion, the hubblespace telescope has resolved the rapidly expanding ejecta. the late-time imagesand spectroscopy provide a geometrical picture that is consistent with earlyobservations and suggests a highly structured, axially symmetric geometry. wepresent here a new synthesis of the old and new data. we show that the bochumevent, presumably a clump of $^{56}$ni, and the late-time image, the locus ofexcitation by $^{44}$ti, are most naturally accounted for by sharing a commonposition angle of about 14\degree, the same as the mystery spot and earlyspeckle data on the ejecta, and that they are both oriented along the axis ofthe inner circumstellar ring at 45\degree to the plane of the sky. we alsodemonstrate that the polarization represents a prolate geometry with the sameposition angle and axis as the early speckle data and the late-time image andhence that the geometry has been fixed in time and throughout the ejecta. thebochum event and the doppler kinematics of the [ca ii]/[o ii] emission inspatially resolved hst spectra of the ejecta can be consistently integratedinto this geometry. the radioactive clump is deduced to fall approximatelyalong the axis of the inner circumstellar ring and therefore to be redshiftedin the north whereas the [ca ii]/[o ii] 7300 \aa emission is redshifted in thesouth. we present a jet-induced model for the explosion and argue that such amodel can account for many of the observed asymmetries. in the jet models, theoxygen and calcium are not expected to be distributed along the jet, butprimarily in an expanding torus that shares the plane and northern blue shiftof the inner circumstellar ring.

astro-ph;9710123	constraints on cosmological models from hubble space telescope  observations of high-z supernovae	we have coordinated hubble space telescope photometry with ground-baseddiscovery for three supernovae: two sn ia near z~0.5 (sn 1997ce, sn 1997cj) anda third event at z=0.97 (sn 1997ck). the superb spatial resolution of hstseparates each supernova from its host galaxy and leads to good precision inthe light curves. the hst data combined with ground-based photometry providegood temporal coverage. we use these light curves and relations betweenluminosity, light curve shape, and color calibrated from low-z samples toderive relative luminosity distances which are accurate to 10% at z~0.5 and 20%at z=1. the redshift-distance relation is used to place constraints on theglobal mean matter density, omega_matter, and the normalized cosmologicalconstant, omega_lambda. when the hst sample is combined with the distance to sn1995k (z=0.48), analyzed by the same precepts, it suggests that matter alone isinsufficient to produce a flat universe. specifically, foromega_matter+omega_lambda=1, omega_matter is less than 1 with &gt;95% confidence,and our best estimate of omega_matter is -0.1 +/- 0.5 if omega_lambda=0.although the present result is based on a very small sample whose systematicsremain to be explored, it demonstrates the power of hst measurements for highredshift supernovae.

astro-ph;9803216	the peculiar type ii supernova 1997 d: a case for a very low 56ni mass	sn 1997d in ngc 1536 is possibly the least luminous and energetic type iisupernova discovered to date. the entire light curve is subluminous, neverreaching $m_v = -14.65$. the radioactive tail follows the 56co decay slope. inthe case of nearly complete trapping of the $\gamma$-rays, the 56ni massderived from the tail brightness is extremely small, $\sim 0.002$ \m. atdiscovery the spectra showed a red continuum and line velocities of the orderof 1000 \kms. the luminosity and the photospheric expansion velocity suggestthat the explosion occurred about 50 days before discovery, and that a plateauprobably followed. model light curves and spectra of the explosion of a 26 \m\star successfully fit the observations. low mass models are inconsistent withthe observations. the radius of the progenitor, constrained by the prediscoveryupper limits, is \r0 \ltsim 300 \r. a low explosion energy of $\sim 4 \times10^{50}$ ergs is then required in the modeling. the strong \ion{ba}{2} lines inthe photospheric spectra are reproduced with a solar abundance and low$t_{eff}$. a scenario in which the low 56ni mass observed in sn 1997d is due tofall--back of material onto the collapsed remnant of the explosion of a 25--40\m star appears to be favored over the case of the explosion of an 8--10 \m\star with low 56ni production.

astro-ph;9805200	the high-z supernova search: measuring cosmic deceleration and global  cur vature of the universe using type ia supernovae	the high-z supernova search is an international collaboration to discover andmonitor type ia supernovae (sn ia) at $z &gt; 0.2$ with the aim of measuringcosmic deceleration and global curvature. our collaboration has pursued a basicunderstanding of supernovae in the nearby universe, discovering and observing alarge sample of objects, and developing methods to measure accurate distanceswith sn ia. this paper describes the extension of this program to $z \geq 0.2$,outlining our search techniques and follow-up program. we have devisedhigh-throughput filters which provide accurate two-color restframe $b$ and $v$light curves of sn ia, enabling us to produce precise, extinction-correctedluminosity distances in the range $0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.55$. sources of systematicerror from k-corrections, extinction, selection effects, and evolution areinvestigated, and their effects estimated. we present photometric and spectralobservations of sn 1995k, our program's first supernova, and use the data toobtain a precise measurement of the luminosity distance to the $z=0.479$ hostgalaxy. this object, when combined with a nearby sample of sn, yields anestimate for the matter density of the universe of $\omega_m =-0.2^{+1.0}_{-0.8}$ if $\omega_\lambda = 0$. for a spatially flat universecomposed of normal matter and a cosmological constant, we find $\omega_m =0.4^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$, $\omega_\lambda = 0.6^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$. we demonstrate thatwith a sample of $\sim 30$ objects, we should be able to determine relativeluminosity distances over the range $0 &lt; z&lt; 0.5$ with sufficient precision tomeasure $\omega_m$ with an uncertainty of $\pm 0.2$.

astro-ph;9805201	observational evidence from supernovae for an accelerating universe and  a cosmological constant	we present observations of 10 type ia supernovae (sne ia) between 0.16 &lt; z &lt;0.62. with previous data from our high-z supernova search team, this expandedset of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to placeconstraints on the hubble constant (h_0), the mass density (omega_m), thecosmological constant (omega_lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0), and thedynamical age of the universe (t_0). the distances of the high-redshift sne iaare, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density(omega_m=0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. different light curvefitting methods, sn ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favoreternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e.,omega_lambda &gt; 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 &lt; 0).with no prior constraint on mass density other than omega_m &gt; 0, thespectroscopically confirmed sne ia are consistent with q_0 &lt;0 at the 2.8 sigmaand 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with omega_lambda &gt;0 at the 3.0 sigma and4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. fixing a``minimal'' mass density, omega_m=0.2, results in the weakest detection,omega_lambda&gt;0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. for a flat-universe prior(omega_m+omega_lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed sne ia requireomega_lambda &gt;0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. auniverse closed by ordinary matter (i.e., omega_m=1) is ruled out at the 7sigma to 8 sigma level. we estimate the size of systematic errors, includingevolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitationallensing, and sample contamination. presently, none of these effects reconcilesthe data with omega_lambda=0 and q_0 &gt; 0.

astro-ph;9806396	supernova limits on the cosmic equation of state	we use type ia supernovae studied by the high-z supernova search team toconstrain the properties of an energy component which may have contributed toaccelerating the cosmic expansion. we find that for a flat geometry theequation of state parameter for the unknown component, alpha_x=p_x/rho_x, mustbe less than -0.55 (95% confidence) for any value of omega_m and is furtherlimited to alpha_x&lt;-0.60 (95%) if omega_m is assumed to be greater than 0.1 .these values are inconsistent with the unknown component being topologicaldefects such as domain walls, strings, or textures. the supernova data areconsistent with a cosmological constant (alpha_x=-1) or a scalar field whichhas had, on average, an equation of state parameter similar to the cosmologicalconstant value of -1 over the redshift range of z=1 to the present. supernovaand cosmic microwave background observations give complementary constraints onthe densities of matter and the unknown component. if only matter and vacuumenergy are considered, then the current combined data sets provide directevidence for a spatially flat universe with omega_tot=omega_m+omega_lambda =0.94 +/- 0.26 (1-sigma).

astro-ph;9811205	optical light curve of the type ia supernova 1998bu in m96 and the  supernova calibration of the hubble constant	we present the ubvri light curves of the type ia supernova sn 1998bu whichappeared in the nearby galaxy m96 (ngc 3368). m96 is a spiral galaxy in the leoi group which has a cepheid-based distance. our photometry allows us tocalculate the absolute magnitude and reddening of this supernova. these data,when combined with measurements of the four other well-observed supernovae withcepheid based distances, allow us to calculate the hubble constant with respectto the hubble flow defined by the distant calan/tololo type ia sample. we finda hubble constant of 64.0 +/- 2.2(internal) +/- 3.5(external) km/s/mpc,consistent with most previous estimates based on type ia supernovae. we notethat the two well-observed type ia supernovae in fornax, if placed at thecepheid distance to the possible fornax spiral ngc 1365, are apparently toofaint with respect to the calan/tololo sample calibrated with the five type iasupernovae with cepheid distances to the host galaxies.

astro-ph;9903229	high redshift supernovae in the hubble deep field	two supernovae detected in the hubble deep field using the original december1995 epoch and data from a shorter (63000 s in f814w) december 1997 visit withhst are discussed. the supernovae (sne) are both associated with distinctgalaxies at redshifts of 0.95 (spectroscopic) from cohen etal. (1996) and 1.32(photometric) from the work of fernandez-soto, lanzetta, and yahil (1998).these redshifts are near, in the case of 0.95, and well beyond for 1.32 thegreatest distance reported previously for sne. we show that our observationsare sensitive to sne to z &lt; 1.8 in either epoch for an event near peakbrightness. detailed simulations are discussed that quantify the level at whichfalse events from our search phase would start to to arise, and thecompleteness of our search as a function of both sn brightness and host galaxyredshift. the number of type ia and type ii sne expected as a function ofredshift in the two hdf epochs are discussed in relation to several publishedpredictions and our own detailed calculations. a mean detection frequency ofone sn per epoch for the small hdf area is consistent with expectations fromcurrent theory.
