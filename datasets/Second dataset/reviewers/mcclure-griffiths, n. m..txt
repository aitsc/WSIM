0901.0968	the outer disk of the milky way seen in 21-cm absorption	three recent surveys of 21-cm line emission in the galactic plane, combiningsingle dish and interferometer observations to achieve resolution of 1 arcminto 2 arcmin, 1 km/s, and good brightness sensitivity, have provided some 650absorption spectra with corresponding emission spectra for study of thedistribution of warm and cool phase h i in the interstellar medium. theseemission-absorption spectrum pairs are used to study the temperature of theinterstellar neutral hydrogen in the outer disk of the milky way, outside thesolar circle, to a radius of 25 kpc.  the cool neutral medium is distributed in radius and height above the planewith very similar parameters to the warm neutral medium. in particular, theratio of the emission to the absorption, which gives the mean spin temperatureof the gas, stays nearly constant with radius to 25 kpc radius. this suggeststhat the mixture of cool and warm phases is a robust quantity, and that thechanges in the interstellar environment do not force the h i into a regimewhere there is only one temperature allowed. the mixture of atomic gas phasesin the outer disk is roughly 15% to 20% cool (40 k to 60 k), the rest warm,corresponding to mean spin temperature 250 to 400 k.  the galactic warp appears clearly in the absorption data, and other featureson the familiar longitude-velocity diagram have analogs in absorption with evenhigher contrast than for 21-cm emission. in the third and fourth galacticquadrants the plane is quite flat, in absorption as in emission, in contrast tothe strong warp in the first and second quadrants. the scale height of the coolgas is similar to that of the warm gas, and both increase with galactic radiusin the outer disk.

0907.4861	the parkes galactic meridian survey (pgms): observations and cmb  polarization foreground analysis	we present observations and cmb foreground analysis of the parkes galacticmeridian survey (pgms), an investigation of the galactic latitude behaviour ofthe polarized synchrotron emission at 2.3 ghz with the parkes radio telescope.the survey consists of a 5-deg wide strip along the galactic meridian l=254-degextending from galactic plane to south galactic pole. we identify three zonesdistinguished by polarized emission properties: the disc, the halo, and atransition region connecting them. the halo section lies at latitudes |b| &gt;40-deg and has weak and smooth polarized emission mostly at large scale withsteep angular power spectra of median slope $\beta_{\rm med} \sim -2.6$. thedisc region covers the latitudes |b|&lt;20-deg and has a brighter, more complexemission dominated by the small scales with flatter spectra of median slope$\beta_{\rm med} = -1.8$. the transition region has steep spectra as in thehalo, but the emission increases toward the galactic plane from halo to disclevels. the change of slope and emission structure at $b \sim -20\degr$ issudden, indicating a sharp disc-halo transition. the whole halo section is justone environment extended over 50-deg with very low emission which, once scaledto 70ghz, is equivalent to the cmb b-mode emission for a tensor-to-scalarperturbation power ratio r_halo = 3.3 +/- 0.4 x 10^{-3}. applying aconservative cleaning procedure, we estimate an r detection limit of $\delta r\sim 2\times 10^{-3}$ at 70~ghz (3-sigma c.l.) and, assuming a dust polariztionfraction &lt;12%, $\delta r \sim 1\times 10^{-2}$ at 150~ghz. the 150-ghz limitmatches the goals of planned sub-orbital experiments, which can therefore beconducted at this high frequency. the 70-ghz limit is close to the goal ofproposed next generation space missions, which thus might not strictly requirespace-based platforms.

1002.2475	the 6-ghz methanol multibeam maser catalogue i: galactic centre region,  longitudes 345 to 6	we have conducted a galactic plane survey of methanol masers at 6668 mhzusing a 7-beam receiver on the parkes telescope. here we present results fromthe first part, which provides sensitive unbiased coverage of a large regionaround the galactic centre. details are given for 183 methanol maser sites inthe longitude range 345$^{\circ}$ through the galactic centre to 6$^{\circ}$.within 6$^{\circ}$ of the centre, we found 88 maser sites, of which more thanhalf (48) are new discoveries. the masers are confined to a narrow galacticlatitude range, indicative of many sources at the galactic centre distance andbeyond, and confined to a thin disk population; there is no high latitudepopulation that might be ascribed to the galactic bulge.  within 2$^{\circ}$ of the galactic centre the maser velocities all liebetween -60 and +77 \kms, a range much smaller than the 540 \kms range observedin co. elsewhere, the maser with highest positive velocity (+107 \kms) occurs,surprisingly, near longitude 355$^{\circ}$ and is probably attributable to thegalactic bar. the maser with the most negative velocity (-127 \kms) is nearlongitude 346$^{\circ}$, within the longitude-velocity locus of the near sideof the `3-kpc arm'. it has the most extreme velocity of a clear population ofmasers associated with the near and far sides of the 3-kpc arm. closer to thegalactic centre the maser space density is generally low, except within 0.25kpc of the centre itself, the `galactic centre zone', where it is 50 timeshigher, which is hinted at by the longitude distribution, and confirmed by theunusual velocities.

1003.4519	a survey of extragalactic faraday rotation at high galactic latitude:  the vertical magnetic field of the milky way towards the galactic poles	we present a study of the vertical magnetic field of the milky way towardsthe galactic poles, determined from observations of faraday rotation towardmore than 1000 polarized extragalactic radio sources at galactic latitudes |b|&gt; 77 degs, using the westerbork radio synthesis telescope and the australiatelescope compact array. we find median rotation measures (rms) of 0.0 +/- 0.5rad/m^2 and +6.3 +/- 0.7 rad/m^2 toward the north and south galactic poles,respectively, demonstrating that there is no coherent vertical magnetic fieldin the milky way at the sun's position. if this is a global property of themilky way's magnetism, then the lack of symmetry across the disk rules out puredipole or quadrupole geometries for the galactic magnetic field. the angularfluctuations in rm seen in our data show no preferred scale within the range ~0.1 to 25 degs. the observed standard deviation in rm of ~ 9 rad/m^2 thenimplies an upper limit of ~1microgauss on the strength of the random magneticfield in the warm ionized medium at high galactic latitudes.

0708.0870	milky way kinematics: measurements at the subcentral point of the fourth  quadrant	we use atomic hydrogen (hi) data from the southern galactic plane survey tostudy the kinematics of the fourth quadrant of the milky way. by measuring theterminal velocity as a function of longitude throughout the fourth galacticquadrant we have derived the most densely sampled rotation curve available forthe milky way between 3 &lt; r &lt; 8 kpc. we determine a new joint rotation curvefit for the first and fourth quadrants, which can be used for kinematicdistances interior to the solar circle. from our data we place new limits onthe peak to peak variation of streaming motions in the fourth quadrant to be~10 km/s. we show that the shape of the average hi profile beyond the terminalvelocity is consistent with gas of three velocity dispersions, a cold componentwith $\delta v=6.3$ km/s, a warmer component with $\delta v=12.3$ km/s and afast component with $\delta v=25.9$ km/s. examining the widths with galacticradius we find that the narrowest two components show little variation withradius and their small scale fluctuations track each other very well,suggesting that they share the same cloud-to-cloud motions. the width of thewidest component is constant until r&lt;4 kpc, where it increases sharply.

1007.0686	gass: the parkes galactic all-sky survey. ii. stray-radiation correction  and second data release	the parkes galactic all-sky survey (gass) is a survey of galactic atomichydrogen (hi) emission in the southern sky observed with the parkes 64-m radiotelescope. the first data release was published by mcclure-griffiths et al.(2009). we remove instrumental effects that affect the gass and present thesecond data release. we calculate the stray-radiation by convolving the all-skyresponse of the parkes antenna with the brightness temperature distributionfrom the leiden/argentine/bonn (lab) all sky 21-cm line survey, with majorcontributions from the 30-m dish of the instituto argentino de radioastronomia(iar) in the southern sky. remaining instrumental baselines are corrected usingthe lab data for a first guess of emission-free baseline regions. radiofrequency interference is removed by median filtering. after applying thesecorrections to the gass we find an excellent agreement with theleiden/argentine/bonn (lab) survey. the gass is the highest spatial resolution,most sensitive, and is currently the most accurate hi survey of the galactic hiemission in the southern sky. we provide a web interface for generation anddownload of fits cubes.

1008.2760	milky way disk-halo transition in hi: properties of the cloud population	using 21cm hi observations from the parkes radio telescope's galactic all-skysurvey, we measure 255 hi clouds in the lower galactic halo that are locatednear the tangent points at 16.9 &lt; l &lt; 35.3 degrees and |b| &lt; 20 degrees. theclouds have a median mass of 700 msun and a median distance from the galacticplane of 660 pc. this first galactic quadrant (qi) region is symmetric to aregion of the fourth quadrant (qiv) studied previously using the same data setand measurement criteria. the properties of the individual clouds in the twoquadrants are quite similar suggesting that they belong to the same population,and both populations have a line of sight cloud-cloud velocity dispersion ofsigma_cc ~ 16 km/s. however, there are three times as many disk-halo clouds atthe qi tangent points and their scale height, at h=800 pc, is twice as large asin qiv. thus the observed line of sight random cloud motions are not connectedto the cloud scale height or its variation around the galaxy. the surfacedensity of clouds is nearly constant over the qi tangent point region but ispeaked near r~4 kpc in qiv. we ascribe all of these differences to thecoincidental location of the qi region at the tip of the milky way's bar, whereit merges with a major spiral arm. the qiv tangent point region, in contrast,covers only a segment of a minor spiral arm. the disk-halo hi cloud populationis thus likely tied to and driven by large-scale star formation processes,possibly through the mechanism of supershells and feedback.

1009.5849	measurement of a magnetic field in a leading arm high velocity cloud	using a recent catalogue of extragalactic faraday rotation derived from thenrao vla sky survey we have found an agreement between faraday rotationstructure and the hi emission structure of a high velocity cloud (hvc)associated with the leading arm of the magellanic system. we suggest that thismorphological agreement is indicative of faraday rotation through the hvc.under this assumption we have used 48 rotation measures through the hvc,together with estimates of the electron column density from h-\alpha\measurements and qso absorption lines to estimate a strength for theline-of-sight component of the coherent magnetic field in the hvc of &lt;b_{||}&gt; &gt;6 {\rm \mu g}$. a coherent magnetic field of this strength is more thansufficient to dynamically stabilize the cloud against ram pressure stripping bythe milky way halo and may also provide thermal insulation for the cold cloud.we estimate an upper limit to the ratio of random to coherent magnetic field of$b_{r}/b_{||} &lt; 0.8$, which suggests that the random field does not dominateover the coherent field as it does in the magellanic clouds from which this hvclikely originates.

1107.0508	a detailed study of the molecular and atomic gas toward the {\gamma}-ray  snr rx j1713.7-3946: spatial tev {\gamma}-ray and ism gas correspondence	rx j1713.7$-$3946 is the most remarkable tev $\gamma$-ray snr which emits$\gamma$-rays in the highest energy range. we made a new combined analysis ofco and \ion{h}{1} in the snr and derived the total protons in the interstellarmedium (ism). we have found that the inclusion of the \ion{h}{1} gas provides asignificantly better spatial match between the tev $\gamma$-rays and ismprotons than the h$_2$ gas alone. in particular, the southeastern rim of the$\gamma$-ray shell has a counterpart only in the \ion{h}{1}. the finding showsthat the ism proton distribution is consistent with the hadronic scenario thatcomic ray (cr) protons react with ism protons to produce the $\gamma$-rays.this provides another step forward for the hadronic origin of the $\gamma$-raysby offering one of the necessary conditions missing in the previous hadronicinterpretations. we argue that the highly inhomogeneous distribution of the ismprotons is crucial in the origin of the $\gamma$-rays. most of the neutral gaswas likely swept up by the stellar wind of an ob star prior to the sne to forma low-density cavity and a swept-up dense wall. the cavity explains thelow-density site where the diffusive shock acceleration of charged particlestakes place with suppressed thermal x-rays, whereas the cr protons can reachthe target protons in the wall to produce the $\gamma$-rays. the presentfinding allows us to estimate the total cr proton energy to be $\sim 10^{48}$ergs, 0.1% of the total energy of a sne.

1301.1400	thermal plasma in the giant lobes of the radio galaxy centaurus a	we present a faraday rotation measure (rm) study of the diffuse, polarized,radio emission from the giant lobes of the nearest radio galaxy, centaurus a.after removal of the smooth galactic foreground rm component, using an ensembleof background source rms located outside the giant lobes, we are left with aresidual rm signal associated with the giant lobes. we find the most likelyorigin of this residual rm is from thermal material mixed throughout therelativistic lobe plasma. the alternative possibility of a thin-skin/boundarylayer of magnetoionic material swept up by the expansion of the lobes is highlyunlikely since it requires, at least, an order of magnitude enhancement of theswept up gas over the expected intragroup density on these scales. strongdepolarisation observed from 2.3 to 0.96 ghz also supports the presence of asignificant amount of thermal gas within the lobes; although depolarisationsolely due to rm fluctuations in a foreground faraday screen on scales smallerthan the beam cannot be ruled out. considering the internal faraday rotationscenario, we find a thermal gas number density of ~10^{-4} cm^{-3} implying atotal gas mass of ~10^{10} m_solar within the lobes. the thermal pressureassociated with this gas (with temperature kt ~ 0.5 kev, obtained from recentx-ray results) is approximately equal to the non-thermal pressure, indicatingthat over the volume of the lobes, there is approximate equipartition betweenthe thermal gas, radio-emitting electrons and magnetic field (and potentiallyany relativistic protons present).

0704.0458	rotation measures of extragalactic sources behind the southern galactic  plane: new insights into the large-scale magnetic field of the inner milky  way	we present new faraday rotation measures (rms) for 148 extragalactic radiosources behind the southern galactic plane (253o &lt; l &lt; 356o, |b| &lt; 1.5o), anduse these data in combination with published data to probe the large-scalestructure of the milky way's magnetic field. we show that the magnitudes ofthese rms oscillate with longitude in a manner that correlates with thelocations of the galactic spiral arms. the observed pattern in rms requries thepresence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth galacticquadrant, located between the sagittarius- carina and scutum-crux spiral arms.to quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we considerall available extragalactic and pulsar rms in the region we have surveyed, andjointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field followsthe spiral arms. in the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourthgalactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the sagittarius-carina spiral arm(as viewed from the north galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise inthe scutum-crux arm. this contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar rms alone,in which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directedcounter-clockwise in the sagittarius- carina arm. also in contrast to recentpulsar rm studies, our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic rmsdemonstrates that large numbers of large-scale magnetic field reversals are notrequired to account for observations.

1307.5121	broadband radio circular polarization spectrum of the relativistic jet  in pks b2126-158	we present full-stokes radio polarization observations of the quasar pksb2126-158 (z=3.268) from 1 to 10 ghz using the australia telescope compactarray. the source has large fractional circular polarization, m_c \equiv |v|/i,detected at high significance across the entire band (from 15 to 90\sigma per128 mhz sub-band). this allows us to construct the most robust circularpolarization (cp) spectrum of an agn jet to date. we find m_c \propto\nu^{+0.60\pm0.03} from 1.5 to 6.5 ghz, with a peak of m_c ~ 1% before thespectrum turns over somewhere between 6.5 and 8 ghz, above which m_c \propto\nu^{-3.0\pm0.4}. the fractional linear polarization (p) varies from &lt;~0.2% to~1% across our frequency range and is strongly anti-correlated with thefractional cp, with a best-fit power law giving m_c \propto p^{-0.24\pm0.03}.this is the first clear relation between the observed linear and circularpolarisations of an agn jet, revealing the action of faraday conversion oflinear polarization (lp) to cp within the jet. more detailed modelling inconjunction with high-spatial resolution observations are required to determinethe true driving force behind the conversion (i.e. magnetic twist or internalfaraday rotation). in particular determining whether the observed faradayrotation is internal or entirely external to the jet is key to this goal. thesimplest interpretation of our observations favours some internal faradayrotation, implying that faraday rotation-driven conversion of lp to cp is thedominant cp generation mechanism. in this case, a small amount ofvector-ordered magnetic field along the jet axis is required, along withinternal faraday rotation from the low energy end of the relativistic electronenergy spectrum in an electron-proton dominated jet.

1312.5801	splash: the southern parkes large-area survey in hydroxyl - first  science from the pilot region	splash (the southern parkes large-area survey in hydroxyl) is a sensitive,unbiased and fully-sampled survey of the southern galactic plane and galacticcentre in all four ground-state transitions of the hydroxyl (oh) radical. thesurvey provides a deep census of 1612-, 1665-, 1667- and 1720-mhz oh absorptionand emission from the galactic ism, and is also an unbiased search for masersources in these transitions. we present here first results from the splashpilot region, which covers galactic longitudes 334 to 344 degrees and latitudesof -2 to +2 degrees. diffuse oh is widely detected in all four transitions,with optical depths that are always small (averaged over the parkes beam), andwith departures from lte common even in the 1665- and 1667-mhz main lines. to a3$\sigma$ sensitivity of 30 mk, we find no evidence of oh envelopes extendingbeyond the co-bright regions of molecular cloud complexes, and conclude thatthe similarity of the oh excitation temperature and the level of the continuumbackground is at least partly responsible for this. we detect masers and masercandidates in all four transitions, approximately 50 per cent of which are newdetections. this implies that splash will produce a substantial increase in theknown population of ground-state oh masers in the southern galactic plane.

0802.2740	the outer scale of turbulence in the magneto-ionized galactic  interstellar medium	we analyze faraday rotation and depolarization of extragalactic radio pointsources in the direction of the inner galactic plane to determine the outerscale and amplitude of the rotation measure power spectrum. structure functionsof rotation measure show lower amplitudes than expected when extrapolatingelectron density fluctuations to large scales assuming a kolmogorov spectralindex. this implies an outer scale of those fluctuations on the order of aparsec, much smaller than commonly assumed. analysis of partial depolarizationof point sources independently indicates a small outer scale of a kolmogorovpower spectrum. in the galaxy's spiral arms, no rotation measure fluctuationson scales above a few parsecs are measured. in the interarm regionsfluctuations on larger scales than in spiral arms are present, and show powerlaw behavior with a shallow spectrum. these results suggest that in the spiralarms stellar sources such as stellar winds or protostellar outflows dominatethe energy injection for the turbulent energy cascade on parsec scales, whilein the interarm regions supernova and super bubble explosions are the mainsources of energy on scales on the order of 100 parsecs.

0804.1871	aligned molecular clouds towards ss433 and l=348.5 degrees; possible  evidence for galactic "vapor trail" created by relativistic jet	we have carried out a detailed analysis of the nanten 12co(j=1-0) dataset intwo large areas of ~25 square degrees towards ss433 (l~40 degree) and of ~18square degrees towards l~348.5 degree, respectively. we have discovered twogroups of remarkably aligned molecular clouds at |b|~1--5 degree in the tworegions. in ss433, we have detected 10 clouds in total, which are well alignednearly along the axis of the x-ray jet emanating from ss433. these clouds havesimilar line-of-sight velocities of 42--56 km s^-1 and the total projectedlength of the feature is ~300 pc, three times larger than that of the x-rayjet, at a distance of 3 kpc. towards l~348.5 degree, we have detected fourclouds named as mjg348.5 at line-of-sight velocities of -80 -- -95 km s^-1 inv_lsr, which also show alignment nearly perpendicular to the galactic plane.the total length of the feature is ~400 pc at a kinematic distance of 6 kpc. inthe both cases, the co clouds are distributed at high galactic latitudes wheresuch clouds are very rare. in addition, their alignments and coincidence invelocity should be even rarer, suggesting that they are physically associated.we tested a few possibilities to explain these clouds, including protostellaroutflows, supershells, and interactions with energetic jets. among them, afavorable scenario is that the interaction between relativistic jet and theinterstellar medium induced the formation of molecular clouds over the last~10^5-6 yrs. it is suggested that the timescale of the relativistic jet may beconsiderably larger, in the order of 10^5-6 yrs, than previously thought inss433. the driving engine of the jet is obviously ss433 itself in ss433,although the engine is not yet identified in mjg348.5 among possible severalcandidates detected in the x-rays and tev gamma rays.

1508.03889	faraday tomography of the north polar spur: constraints on the distance  to the spur and on the magnetic field of the galaxy	we present radio continuum and polarization images of the north polar spur(nps) from the global magneto-ionic medium survey (gmims) conducted with thedominion radio astrophysical observatory 26-m telescope. we fit polarizationangle versus wavelength squared over 2048 frequency channels from 1280 to 1750mhz to obtain a faraday rotation measure (rm) map of the nps. combining this rmmap with a published faraday depth map of the entire galaxy in this direction,we derive the faraday depth introduced by the nps and the galactic interstellarmedium (ism) in front of and behind the nps. the faraday depth contributed bythe nps is close to zero, indicating that the nps is an emitting only feature.the faraday depth caused by the ism in front of the nps is consistent with zeroat b&gt;50 degree, implying that this part of the nps is local at a distance ofapproximately several hundred parsecs. the faraday depth contributed by the ismbehind the nps gradually increases with galactic latitude up to b=44 degree,and decreases at higher galactic latitudes. this implies that either the partof the nps at b&lt;44 degree is distant or the nps is local but there is a signchange of the large-scale magnetic field. if the nps is local, there is then noevidence for a large-scale anti-symmetry pattern in the faraday depth of themilky way. the faraday depth introduced by the ism behind the nps at latitudesb&gt;50 degree can be explained by including a coherent vertical magnetic field.

0807.1532	a radio and optical polarization study of the magnetic field in the  small magellanic cloud	we present a study of the magnetic field of the small magellanic cloud (smc),carried out using radio faraday rotation and optical starlight polarizationdata. consistent negative rotation measures (rms) across the smc indicate thatthe line-of-sight magnetic field is directed uniformly away from us with astrength 0.19 +/- 0.06 microgauss. applying the chandrasekhar-fermi method tostarlight polarization data yields an ordered magnetic field in the plane ofthe sky of strength 1.6 +/- 0.4 microgauss oriented at a position angle 4 +/-12 degs, measured counter-clockwise from the great circle on the sky joiningthe smc to the large magellanic cloud (lmc). we construct a three-dimensionalmagnetic field model of the smc, under the assumption that the rms andstarlight polarization probe the same underlying large-scale field. the vectordefining the overall orientation of the smc magnetic field shows a potentialalignment with the vector joining the center of the smc to the center of thelmc, suggesting the possibility of a "pan-magellanic'' magnetic field. acosmic-ray driven dynamo is the most viable explanation of the observed fieldgeometry, but has difficulties accounting for the observed uni-directionalfield lines. a study of faraday rotation through the magellanic bridge isneeded to further test the pan-magellanic field hypothesis.

astro-ph;0211298	fitting together the hi absorption and emission in the sgps	in this paper we study 21-cm absorption spectra and the correspondingemission spectra toward bright continuum sources in the test region (326deg&lt; l&lt; 333 deg) of the southern galactic plane survey. this survey combines the highresolution of the australia telescope compact array with the full brightnesstemperature information of the parkes single dish telescope. in particular, wefocus on the abundance and temperature of the cool atomic clouds in the innergalaxy. the resulting mean opacity of the hi, &lt;kappa&gt;, is measured as afunction of galactic radius; it increases going in from the solar circle, to apeak in the molecular ring of about four times its local value. this suggeststhat the cool phase is more abundant there, and colder, than it is locally.  the distribution of cool phase temperatures is derived in three differentways. the naive, ``spin temperature'' technique overestimates the cloudtemperatures, as expected. using two alternative approaches we get goodagreement on a histogram of the cloud temperatures, t(cool), corrected forblending with warm phase gas. the median temperature is about 65 k, but thereis a long tail reaching down to temperatures below 20 k. clouds withtemperatures below 40 k are common, though not as common as warmer clouds (40to 100 k).  using these results we discuss two related quantities, the peak brightnesstemperature seen in emission surveys, and the incidence of clouds seen in hiself-absorption. both phenomena match what would be expected based on ourmeasurements of &lt;kappa&gt; and t(cool).

astro-ph;0503134	the southern galactic plane survey: hi observations and analysis	we describe the hi component of the southern galactic plane survey (sgps).the sgps is a large-scale project to image at arcminute resolution the hispectral line and 21 cm continuum emission in parts of the plane of the milkyway. the survey covers galactic longitudes 253 deg &lt; l &lt; 358 deg and latitudes|b| &lt;1.5 deg (sgps i), plus a first quadrant extension covering 5 deg &lt; l &lt; 20deg and |b| &lt;1.5 deg (sgps ii). the survey combines data from the australiatelescope compact array and the parkes radio telescope for sensitivity toangular scales ranging from 2 arcminutes to several degrees. the combined datacover 325 sq-deg and have an rms sensitivity of 1.6 k. here we describe the hiobservations and data reduction in detail, and present examples from the finaldata products. the complete dataset is publicly available through the australiatelescope national facility's hi surveys archive. this dataset provides anunprecedented view of the neutral component of interstellar hydrogen in theinner milky way.

astro-ph;0503171	constraints on the distance to sgr 1806-20 from hi absorption	the giant flare detected from the magnetar sgr 1806-20 on 2004 december 27had a fluence more than 100 times higher than the only two other sgr flaresever recorded. whereas the fluence is independent of distance, an estimate forthe luminosity of the burst depends on the source's distance, which haspreviously been argued to be ~15 kpc. the burst produced a bright radioafterglow, against which cameron et al. (2005) have measured an hi absorptionspectrum. this has been used to propose a revised distance to sgr 1806-20 ofbetween 6.4 and 9.8 kpc. here we analyze this absorption spectrum, and compareit both to hi emission data from the southern galactic plane survey and toarchival 12-co survey data. we confirm ~6 kpc, as a likely lower limit on thedistance to sgr 1806-20, but argue that it is difficult to place an upper limiton the distance to sgr 1806-20 from the hi data currently available. theprevious value of ~15 kpc thus remains the best estimate of the distance to thesource.

astro-ph;0509730	compact hi clouds at high forbidden velocities in the inner galaxy	the vla galactic plane survey (vgps) of the first galactic quadrant wassearched for hi emission with velocities well above the maximum velocityallowed by galactic rotation. a sample of 17 small fast-moving clouds wasidentified. the distribution of the ensemble of clouds in longitude andvelocity indicates that the clouds are part of the galactic disk, despite theirlarge forbidden velocity. the median angular diameter of the clouds detected inthe vgps is 3.4 arcminutes. these clouds would not be noticed in previous lowresolution surveys because of strong beam dilution. assuming each cloud islocated at the tangent point, a median cloud has a diameter of 10 pc, hi massof 60 m_sun, and a velocity more than 25 km/s beyond the local terminalvelocity derived from 12co observations. three clouds in the sample have avelocity between 50 and 60 km/s in excess of the local terminal velocity. thelongitude distribution of the sample peaks near l = 30 degrees, while thelatitude distribution of the clouds is nearly flat. the observed longitude andlatitude distributions are compared with simulated distributions taking intoaccount the selection criteria of the cloud search. it is found that the numberof clouds declines with distance from the galactic center, with an exponentialscale length 2.8 - 8 kpc at the 99% confidence level. we find a lower limit tothe scale height of the clouds of 180 pc (hwhm), but the true value is likelysignificantly higher.

astro-ph;0605422	the vla galactic plane survey	the vla galactic plane survey (vgps) is a survey of hi and 21-cm continuumemission in the galactic plane between longitude 18 degrees 67 degr. withlatitude coverage from |b| &lt; 1.3 degr. to |b| &lt; 2.3 degr. the survey area wasobserved with the very large array (vla) in 990 pointings. short-spacinginformation for the hi line emission was obtained by additional observationswith the green bank telescope (gbt). hi spectral line images are presented witha resolution of 1 arcmin x 1 arcmin x 1.56 km/s (fwhm) and rms noise of 2 k per0.824 km/s channel. continuum images made from channels without hi lineemission have 1 arcmin (fwhm) resolution. vgps images are compared with imagesfrom the canadian galactic plane survey (cgps) and the southern galactic planesurvey (sgps). in general, the agreement between these surveys is impressive,considering the differences in instrumentation and image processing techniquesused for each survey. the differences between vgps and cgps images are small, &lt;6 k (rms) in channels where the mean hi brightness temperature in the fieldexceeds 80 k. a similar degree of consistency is found between the vgps andsgps. the agreement we find between arcminute resolution surveys of thegalactic plane is a crucial step towards combining these surveys into a singleuniform dataset which covers 90% of the galactic disk: the internationalgalactic plane survey (igps). the vgps data will be made available on the worldwide web through the canadian astronomy data centre (cadc).

astro-ph;0608585	magnetically dominated strands of cold hydrogen in the riegel-crutcher  cloud	we present new high resolution (100 arcsec) neutral hydrogen (h i)self-absorption images of the riegel-crutcher cloud obtained with the australiatelescope compact array and the parkes radio telescope. the riegel-crutchercloud lies in the direction of the galactic center at a distance of 125 +/- 25pc. our observations resolve the very large, nearby sheet of cold hydrogen intoa spectacular network of dozens of hair-like filaments. individual filamentsare remarkably elongated, being up to 17 pc long with widths of less than ~0.1pc. the strands are reasonably cold, with spin temperatures of 40 k and in manyplaces appearing to have optical depths larger than one. comparing the h iimages with observations of stellar polarization we show that the filaments arevery well aligned with the ambient magnetic field. we argue that the structureof the cloud has been determined by its magnetic field. in order for the cloudto be magnetically dominated the magnetic field strength must be &gt; 30microgauss.
