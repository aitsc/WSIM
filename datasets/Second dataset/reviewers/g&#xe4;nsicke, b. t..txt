0901.2051	post common envelope binaries from sdss. iv: sdssj121258.25-012310.1, a  new eclipsing system	from optical photometry we show that sdssj121258.25-012310.1 is a neweclipsing, post common-envelope binary with an orbital period of 8.06 hours andan eclipse length of 23 minutes. we observed the object over 11 nights indifferent bands and determined the ephemeris of the eclipse to hjd_mid =2454104. 7086(2) + 0.3358706(5) x e, where numbers in parenthesis indicate theuncertainties in the last digit. the depth of the eclipse is 2.85 +/- 0.17 magin the v band, 1.82 +/- 0.08 mag in the r band and 0.52 +/- 0.02 mag in the iband. from spectroscopic observations we measured the semi-amplitude of theradial velocity k_2 = 181 +/- 3 km/s for the secondary star. the stellar andbinary parameters of the system were constrained from a) fitting the sdsscomposite spectrum of the binary, b) using a k-band luminosty-mass relation forthe secondary star, and c) from detailed analyses of the eclipse light curve.the white dwarf has an effective temperature of 17700 +/- 300 k, and itssurface gravity is logg =7.53 +/- 0.2. we estimate that the spectral type ofthe red dwarf is m4 +/- 1 and the distance to the system is 230 +/- 20 parsec.the mass of the secondary star is estimated to be in the range msec = 0.26-0.29msun, while the mass of the white dwarf is most likely mwd = 0.46-0.48 msun.  from an empirical mass-radius relation we estimate the radius of the reddwarf to be in the range 0.28-0.31 rsun, whereas we get rwd = 0.016-0.018 rsunfrom a theoretical mass-radius realation. finally we discuss the spectralenergy distribution and the likely evolutionary state of sdss1212-0123.

1006.1075	the orbital period of v458 vulpeculae, a post double common-envelope  nova	we present time-resolved optical spectroscopy of v458 vulpeculae (nova vul2007 no. 1) spread over a period of 15 months starting 301 days after itsdiscovery. our data reveal radial velocity variations in the heii {\lambda}5412and heii {\lambda}4686 emission lines. a period analysis of the radial velocitycurves resulted in a period of 98.09647 \pm 0.00025 min (0.06812255 \pm0.00000017 d) which we identify with the orbital period of the binary system.v458 vul is therefore the planetary nebula central binary star with theshortest period known. we explore the possibility of the system being composedof a relatively massive white dwarf (m1 \gsim 1.0 msun) accreting matter from apost-asymptotic giant branch star which produced the planetary nebula observed.in this scenario, the central binary system therefore underwent twocommon-envelope episodes. a combination of previous photoionisation modellingof the nebular spectra, post-asymptotic giant branch evolutionary tracks andthe orbital period favour a mass of m2 \sim 0.6 msun for the donor star.therefore, the total mass of the system may exceed the chandrasekhar mass,which makes v458 vul a type ia supernova progenitor candidate.

1006.1621	post-common-envelope binaries from sdss. ix: constraining the  common-envelope efficiency	reconstructing the evolution of post-common-envelope binaries (pcebs) canconstrain current prescriptions of common-envelope (ce) evolution. analyzing anew sample of pcebs we derive constraints on one of the most importantparameters in the field of close compact binary formation, i.e. the ceefficiency alpha. after reconstructing the post-ce evolution and based on fitsto stellar evolution calculations as well as a parametrized energy equation force evolution that incorporates realistic approximations of the binding energyparameter lambda, we determine the possible evolutionary histories of theobserved pcebs. we also reconstruct ce evolution replacing the classical energyequation with a scaled angular momentum equation and compare the resultsobtained with both algorithms. we find that all pcebs in our sample can bereconstructed with the energy equation if the internal energy of the envelopeis included. although most individual systems have solutions for a broad rangeof values for alpha, only for alpha=0.2-0.3 do we find simultaneous solutionsfor all pcebs in our sample. if we adjust alpha to this range of values, thevalues of the angular momentum parameter gamma cluster in a small range ofvalues. in contrast if we fix gamma to a small range of values that allows usto reconstruct all our systems, the possible ranges of values for alpha remainsbroad for individual systems. the classical parametrized energy equation seemsto be an appropriate prescription of ce evolution and turns out to constrainthe outcome of the ce evolution much more than the alternative angular momentumequation. if there is a universal value of the ce efficiency, it should be inthe range of alpha=0.2-0.3. we do not find any indications for a dependence ofalpha on the mass of the secondary star or the final orbital period.

1007.3170	first kepler results on compact pulsators i. survey target selection and  the first pulsators	we present results from the first two quarters of a survey to search forpulsations in compact stellar objects with the kepler spacecraft. the surveysample and the various methods applied in its compilation are described, andspectroscopic observations are presented to separate the objects into accurateclasses. from the kepler photometry we clearly identify nine compact pulsators,and a number of interesting binary stars. of the pulsators, one shows thestrong, rapid pulsations typical for a v361 hya type sdb variable (sdbv), sevenshow long-period pulsations characteristic of v1093 her type sdbvs, and oneshows low-amplitude pulsations with both short and long periods. we deriveeffective temperatures and surface gravities for all the subdwarf b stars inthe sample and demonstrate that below the boundary region where hybrid sdbpulsators are found, all our targets are pulsating. for the stars hotter thanthis boundary temperature a low fraction of strong pulsators (&lt;10 per cent) isconfirmed. interestingly, the short-period pulsator also shows a low-amplitudemode in the long-period region, and several of the v1093 her pulsators show lowamplitude modes in the short-period region, indicating that hybrid behaviourmay be common in these stars, also outside the boundary temperature regionwhere hybrid pulsators have hitherto been found.

1010.2747	kepler observations of the beaming binary kpd 1946+4340	the kepler mission has acquired 33.5d of continuous one-minute photometry ofkpd 1946+4340, a short-period binary system that consists of an sdb and a whitedwarf. in the light curve, eclipses are clearly seen, with the deepestoccurring when the compact white dwarf crosses the disc of the sdb (0.4%) andthe more shallow ones (0.1%) when the sdb eclipses the white dwarf. asexpected, the sdb is deformed by the gravitational field of the white dwarf,which produces an ellipsoidal modulation of the light curve. spectacularly, avery strong doppler beaming (aka doppler boosting) effect is also clearlyevident at the 0.1% level. this originates from the sdb's orbital velocity,which we measure to be 164.0\pm1.9 km/s from supporting spectroscopy. wepresent light curve models that account for all these effects, as well asgravitational lensing. we derive system parameters and uncertainties from thelight curve using markov chain monte carlo simulations. adopting a theoreticalwhite dwarf mass-radius relation, the mass of the subdwarf is found to be0.47\pm0.03 msun and the mass of the white dwarf 0.59\pm0.02 msun. theeffective temperature of the white dwarf is 15 900\pm300k. with a spectroscopiceffective temperature of teff = 34 730\pm250k and a surface gravity of log g =5.43\pm0.04, the sdb is in a shell he burning stage. the detection of dopplerbeaming in kepler light curves potentially allows one to measure radialvelocities without the need of spectroscopic data. for the first time, aphotometrically observed doppler beaming amplitude is compared to aspectroscopically established value. the sdb's radial velocity amplitudederived from the photometry 168\pm4 km/s is in perfect agreement with thespectroscopic value. after subtracting our best model for the orbital effects,we searched the residuals for stellar oscillations but did not find anysignificant pulsation frequencies.

1011.5235	a stellar prominence in the white dwarf/red dwarf binary qs vir:  evidence for a detached system	using high resolution uves spectra of the eclipsing post common envelopebinary qs vir we detect material along the line of sight to the white dwarf atorbital phase $\phi=0.16$. we ascribe this to a stellar prominence originatingfrom the m dwarf secondary star which passes in front of the white dwarf atthis phase. this creates sharp absorption features in the hydrogen balmerseries and ca ii h and k lines. the small size of the white dwarf allows us toplace tight constraints on the column density of hydrogen in the n=2 level oflog_(10)(n_2) = 14.10 +/- 0.03 cm^(-2) and, assuming local thermodynamicalequilibrium, the temperature of the prominence material of ~9000k. theprominence material is at least 1.5 stellar radii from the surface of the mdwarf. the location of the prominence is consistent with emission featurespreviously interpreted as evidence for roche lobe overflow in the system. wealso detect mg ii 4481a absorption from the white dwarf. the width of the mg iiline indicates that the white dwarf is not rapidly rotating, in contrast toprevious work, hence our data indicate that qs vir is a pre-cataclysmic binary,yet to initiate mass transfer, rather than a hibernating cataclysmic variableas has been suggested.

1107.3586	accretion in the detached post-common-envelope binary ltt 560	in a previous study, we found that the detached post-common-envelope binaryltt 560 displays an halpha emission line consisting of two anti-phasedcomponents. while one of them was clearly caused by stellar activity from thesecondary late-type main-sequence star, our analysis indicated that the whitedwarf primary star is potentially the origin of the second component. however,the low resolution of the data means that our interpretation remains ambiguous.we here use time-series uves data to compare the radial velocities of thehalpha emission components to those of metal absorption lines from the primaryand secondary stars. we find that the weaker component most certainlyoriginates in the white dwarf and is probably caused by accretion. an abundanceanalysis of the white dwarf spectrum yields accretion rates that are consistentwith mass loss from the secondary due to a stellar wind. the second andstronger halpha component is attributed to stellar activity on the secondarystar. an active secondary is likely to be present because of the occurrence ofa flare in our time-resolved spectroscopy. furthermore, roche tomographyindicates that a significant area of the secondary star on its leading side andclose to the first lagrange point is covered by star spots. finally, we derivethe parameters for the system and place it in an evolutionary context. we findthat the white dwarf is a very slow rotator, suggesting that it has had anangular-momentum evolution similar to that of field white dwarfs. we predictthat ltt 560 will begin mass transfer via roche-lobe overflow in about 3.5gyrs, and conclude that the system is representative of the progenitors of thecurrent population of cataclysmic variables. it will most likely evolve tobecome an su uma type dwarf nova.

1108.4600	post-common-envelope binaries from sdss. xi: the white dwarf mass  distributions of cvs and pre-cvs	we have known for a long time that many of the measured white dwarf (wd)masses in cataclysmic variables (cvs) significantly exceed the mean mass ofsingle wds. this was thought to be related to observational biases, but recenthigh-precision measurements of wd masses in a great number of cvs arechallenging this interpretation. we review the measured wd masses of cvs,determine the wd-mass distribution of an extensive sample ofpost-common-envelope binaries (pcebs) that are representative for theprogenitors of the current cv population (pre-cvs) and compare bothdistributions. we calculate the cv formation time of the pcebs in our sample bydetermining the post common-envelope (ce) and the main-sequence evolution ofthe binary systems and define a pre-cv to be a pceb that evolves into asemi-detached configuration with stable mass transfer within less than the ageof the galaxy. possible observational biases affecting the wd-mass distributionfor the pre-cv and the cv samples are discussed. the mean wd mass among cvs is&lt;mwd&gt;=0.83\pm0.23 msun, much larger than that found for pre-cvs,&lt;mwd&gt;=0.67\pm0.21 msun. selection effects cannot explain the high wd massesobserved in cvs and we here suggest two possible explanations, both of whichimply substantial revisions to the standard model of cv evolution: either mostcvs have formed above the orbital-period gap (which requires a high wd mass toinitiate stable mass transfer or a previous phase of thermal-timescale masstransfer), or the mass of the wds in cvs grows through accretion (whichstrongly disagrees with the predictions of classical nova models). both optionsmay imply that cvs contribute to the single-degenerate progenitors of type iasupernovae. the number of he-core wds found in cvs (&lt;=10%) is roughlyconsistent with the number of he-core wds in pre-cvs (&lt;=17+-8%), whichindicates a low value of the ce efficiency.

1109.6662	post common envelope binaries from sdss. xii: the orbital period  distribution	the complexity of the common envelope phase and of magnetic stellar windbraking currently limits our understanding of close binary evolution. becauseof their intrinsically simple structure, observational population studies ofwhite dwarf plus main sequence (wdms) binaries hold the potential to testtheoretical models and constrain their parameters. the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) has provided a large and homogeneously selected sample of wdms binaries,which we are characterising in terms of orbital and stellar parameters. we haveobtained radial velocity information for 385 wdms binaries from follow-upspectroscopy, and for an additional 861 systems from the sdss sub-spectra.radial velocity variations identify 191 of these wdms binaries as post commonenvelope binaries (pcebs). orbital periods of 58 pcebs were subsequentlymeasured, predominantly from time-resolved spectroscopy, bringing the totalnumber of sdss pcebs with orbital parameters to 79. observational biasesinherent to this pceb sample were evaluated through extensive monte carlosimulations. we find that 21-24% of all sdss wdms binaries have undergonecommon envelope evolution, which is in good agreement with published binarypopulation models and high-resolution hst imaging of wdms binaries unresolvedfrom the ground. the bias corrected orbital period distribution of pcebs rangesfrom 1.9 h to 4.3 d and follows approximately a normal distribution inlog(porb), peaking at ~10.3 h. there is no observational evidence for asignificant population of pcebs with periods in the range of days to weeks. thelarge and homogeneous sample of sdss wdms binaries provides the means to testfundamental predictions of binary population models, and hence toobservationally constrain the evolution of all close compact binaries.

1111.2512	post-common-envelope binaries from sdss. xiii: mass dependencies of the  orbital period distribution	post-common-envelope binaries (pcebs) consisting of a white dwarf (wd) and amain-sequence secondary star are ideal systems to constrain models ofcommon-envelope (ce) evolution. until very recently, observed samples of pcebshave been too small to fully explore this potential, however the recentlyidentified large and relatively homogenous sample of pcebs from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) has significantly changed this situation. we hereanalyze the orbital period distributions of pcebs containing he- and c/o-corewds separately and investigate whether the orbital period of pcebs is relatedto the masses of their stellar components. we performed standard statisticaltests to compare the orbital period distributions and to determine theconfidence levels of possible relations. the orbital periods of pcebscontaining he-core wds are significantly shorter than those of pcebs containingc/o-core wds. while the he-core pceb orbital period distribution has a medianvalue of porb ~ 0.28 d, the median orbital period for pcebs containing c/o-corewds is porb ~ 0.57 d. we also find that systems containing more massivesecondaries have longer post-ce orbital periods, in contradiction to recentpredictions. our observational results provide new constraints on theories ofce evolution. however we suggest future binary population models to takeselection effects into account that still affect the current observed pcebsample.

1202.3784	constraints on the lifetimes of disks resulting from tidally destroyed  rocky planetary bodies	spitzer irac observations of 15 metal-polluted white dwarfs reveal infraredexcesses in the spectral energy distributions of he 0110-5630, gd 61, and he1349-2305. all three of these stars have helium-dominated atmospheres, andtheir infrared emissions are consistent with warm dust produced by the tidaldestruction of (minor) planetary bodies. this study brings the number ofmetal-polluted, helium and hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs surveyed with iracto 53 and 38 respectively. it also nearly doubles the number of metal-pollutedhelium-rich white dwarfs found to have closely orbiting dust by spitzer. fromthe increased statistics for both atmospheric types with circumstellar dust, wederive a typical disk lifetime of log[t_{disk} (yr)] = 5.6+-1.1 (ranging from3*10^4 - 5*10^6 yr). this assumes a relatively constant rate of accretion overthe timescale where dust persists, which is uncertain. we find that thefraction of highly metal-polluted helium-rich white dwarfs that have aninfrared excess detected by spitzer is only 23 per cent, compared to 48 percent for metal-polluted hydrogen-rich white dwarfs, and we conclude from thisdifference that the typical lifetime of dusty disks is somewhat shorter thanthe diffusion time scales of helium-rich white dwarf. we also find evidence forhigher time-averaged accretion rates onto helium-rich stars compared to theinstantaneous accretion rates onto hydrogen-rich stars; this is an indicationthat our picture of evolved star-planetary system interactions is incomplete.we discuss some speculative scenarios that can explain the observations.

1202.4921	the fight for accretion: discovery of intermittent mass transfer in bb  doradus in the low state	our long-term photometric monitoring of southern nova-like cataclysmicvariables with the 1.3-m smarts telescope found bb doradus fading from v ~ 14.3towards a deep low state at v ~ 19.3 in april 2008. here we presenttime-resolved optical spectroscopy of bb dor in this faint state in 2009. theoptical spectrum in quiescence is a composite of a hot white dwarf with teff =30000 +- 5000 k and a m3-4 secondary star with narrow emission lines (mainly ofthe balmer series and hei) superposed. we associate these narrow profiles withan origin on the donor star. analysis of the radial velocity curve of theh-alpha emission from the donor star allowed the measurement of an orbitalperiod of 0.154095 +- 0.000003 d (3.69828 +- 0.00007 h), different from allprevious estimates. we detected episodic accretion events which veiled thespectra of both stars and radically changed the line profiles within atimescale of tens of minutes. this shows that accretion is not completelyquenched in the low state. during these accretion episodes the line wings arestronger and their radial velocity curve is delayed by ~ 0.2 cycle, similar tothat observed in sw sex and am her stars in the high state, with respect to themotion of the white dwarf. two scenarios are proposed to explain the extraemission: impact of the material on the outer edge of a cold, remnant accretiondisc, or the combined action of a moderately magnetic white dwarf (b1 &lt;~ 5 mg)and the magnetic activity of the donor star.

1202.5553	mass ratio from doppler beaming and r{\o}mer delay versus ellipsoidal  modulation in the kepler data of koi-74	we present a light curve analysis and radial velocity study of koi-74, aneclipsing a star + white dwarf binary with a 5.2 day orbit. aside from newspectroscopy covering the orbit of the system, we used 212 days of publiclyavailable kepler observations and present the first complete light curvefitting to these data, modelling the eclipses and transits, ellipsoidalmodulation, reflection, and doppler beaming. markov chain monte carlosimulations are used to determine the system parameters and uncertaintyestimates. our results are in agreement with earlier studies, except that wefind an inclination of 87.0 \pm 0.4\degree, which is significantly lower thanthe previously published value. we find that the mass ratio derived from theradial velocity amplitude (q=0.104 \pm 0.004) disagrees with that derived fromthe ellipsoidal modulation (q=0.052 \pm 0.004} assuming corotation). this wasfound before, but with our smaller inclination, the discrepancy is even largerthan previously reported. accounting for the rapid rotation of the a-star isfound to increase the discrepancy even further by lowering the mass ratio toq=0.047 \pm 0.004. these results indicate that one has to be extremely carefulin using the amplitude of an ellipsoidal modulation signal in a close binary todetermine the mass ratio, when a proof of corotation is not firmly established.the radial velocities that can be inferred from the detected doppler beaming inthe light curve are found to be in agreement with our spectroscopic radialvelocity determination. we also report the first measurement of r{\o}mer delayin a light curve of a compact binary. this delay amounts to -56 \pm 17 s and isconsistent with the mass ratio derived from the radial velocity amplitude. thefirm establishment of this mass ratio at q=0.104 \pm 0.004 leaves little doubtthat the companion of koi-74 is a low mass white dwarf.

1202.6333	initial data release of the kepler-int survey	this paper describes the first data release of the kepler-int survey (kis),that covers a 116 deg2 region of the cygnus and lyra constellations. the keplerfield is the target of the most intensive search for transiting planets todate. despite the fact that the kepler mission provides superior time seriesphotometry, with an enormous impact on all areas of stellar variability, itsfield lacks optical photometry complete to the confusion limit of the keplerinstrument necessary for selecting various classes of targets. for this reason,we follow the observing strategy and data reduction method used in the iphasand uvex galactic plane surveys in order to produce a deep optical survey ofthe kepler field. this initial release concerns data taken between may andaugust 2011, using the isaac newton telescope on the island of la palma. fourbroadband filters were used, u, g, r, i, as well as one narrowband one, halpha,reaching down to a 10-sigma limit of around 20th mag in the vega system.observations covering around 50 deg2, thus about half of the field, passed ourquality control thresholds and constitute this first data release. we derive aglobal photometric calibration by placing the kis magnitudes as close aspossible to the kepler input catalog (kic) photometry. the initial data releasecatalogue containing around 6 million sources from all the good photometricfields is available for download from the kis webpage, as well as via mast.

1205.0004	scars of intense accretion episodes at metal-rich white dwarfs	a re-evaluation of time-averaged accretion rates at dbz-type white dwarfspoints to historical, time-averaged rates significantly higher than thecurrently observed episodes at their daz counterparts. the difference betweenthe ongoing, instantaneous accretion rates witnessed at daz white dwarfs, whichoften exceed 1e8 g/s, and those inferred over the past 1e5-1e6 yr for the dbzstars can be a few orders of magnitude, and therefore must result fromhigh-rate episodes of tens to hundreds of years so they remain undetected todate. this paper explores the likelihood that such brief, intense accretionepisodes of gas-phase material can account for existing data. for reasonableassumptions about the circumstellar gas, accretion rates approaching orexceeding 1e15 g/s are possible, similar to rates observed in quiescentcataclysmic variables, and potentially detectable with future x-ray missions orwide-field monitoring facilities. gaseous debris that is prone to such rapidaccretion may be abundant immediately following a tidal disruption event viacollisions and sublimation, or if additional bodies impinge upon an extantdisk. particulate disk matter accretes at or near the poynting-robertson dragrate for long periods between gas-producing events, consistent with ratesinferred for dusty daz white dwarfs. in this picture, warm daz stars withoutinfrared excesses have rates consistent with accretion from particulate disksthat remain undetected. this overall picture has implications for quasi-steadystate models of accretion and the derived chemical composition of asteroidaldebris in dbz white dwarfs.

1205.6803	the unseen population of f to k-type companions to hot subdwarf stars	we present a method to select hot subdwarf stars with a to m-type companionsusing photometric selection criteria. we cover a wide range in wavelength bycombining galex ultraviolet data, optical photometry from the sdss and thecarlsberg meridian telescope, near-infrared data from 2mass and ukidss. weconstruct two complimentary samples, one by matching galex, cmc and 2mass, aswell as a smaller, but deeper, sample using galex, sdss and ukidss. in bothcases, a large number of composite subdwarf plus main-sequence star candidateswere found. we fit their spectral energy distributions with a composite modelin order to estimate the subdwarf and companion star effective temperaturesalong with the distance to each system. the distribution of subdwarf effectivetemperature was found to primarily lie in the 20,000 - 30,000 k regime, but wealso find cooler subdwarf candidates, making up ~5-10 per cent. the mostprevalent companion spectral types were seen to be main-sequence stars betweenf0 and k0, while subdwarfs with m-type companions appear much rarer. this isclear observational confirmation that a very efficient first stable roche-lobeoverflow channel appears to produce a large number of subdwarfs with f tok-type companions. our samples thus support the importance of binary evolutionfor subdwarf formation.

1207.5393	an accurate mass and radius measurement for an ultracool white dwarf	studies of cool white dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood have placed a limiton the age of the galactic disk of 8-9 billion years. however, determiningtheir cooling ages requires the knowledge of their effective temperatures,masses, radii, and atmospheric composition. so far, these parameters could onlybe inferred for a small number of ultracool white dwarfs for which an accuratedistance is known, by fitting their spectral energy distributions (seds) inconjunction with a theoretical mass-radius relation. however, the mass-radiusrelation remains largely untested, and the derived cooling ages are hencemodel-dependent. here we report direct measurements of the mass and radius ofan ultracool white dwarf in the double-lined eclipsing binary sdssj013851.54-001621.6. we find m(wd)=0.529+/-0.010msol andr(wd)=0.0131+/-0.0003rsol. our measurements are consistent with the mass-radiusrelation and we determine a robust cooling age of 9.5 billion years for the3570k white dwarf. we find that the mass and radius of the low mass companionstar, m(sec)=0.132+/-0.003msol and r(sec)=0.165+/-0.001rsol, are in agreementwith evolutionary models. we also find evidence that this &gt;9.5 gyr old m5 staris still active, far beyond the activity lifetime for a star of its spectraltype. this is likely caused by the high tidally-enforced rotation rate of thestar. the companion star is close to filling its roche lobe and the system willevolve into a cataclysmic variable in only 70 myr. our direct measurementsdemonstrate that this system can be used to calibrate ultracool white dwarfatmospheric models.

1212.2899	nltt5306: the shortest period detached white dwarf + brown dwarf binary	we have spectroscopically confirmed a brown dwarf mass companion to thehydrogen atmosphere white dwarf nltt5306. the white dwarf's atmosphericparameters were measured using sloan digital sky survey and x-shooterspectroscopy as t_eff=7756+/-35k and log(g)=7.68+/-0.08, giving a mass for theprimary of m_wd=0.44+/-0.04 m_sun, at a distance of 71+/-4 pc with a coolingage of 710+/-50 myr. the existence of the brown dwarf secondary was confirmedthrough the near-infrared arm of the x-shooter data and a spectral type ofdl4-dl7 was estimated using standard spectral indices. combined radial velocitymeasurements from the sloan digital sky survey, x-shooter and the hobby-eberlytelescope's high resolution spectrograph of the white dwarf gives a minimummass of 56+/-3 m_jup for the secondary, confirming the substellar nature. theperiod of the binary was measured as 101.88+/-0.02 mins using both the radialvelocity data and i'-band variability detected with the int. this variabilityindicates 'day' side heating of the brown dwarf companion. we also observeh{\alpha} emission in our higher resolution data in phase with the white dwarfradial velocity, indicating this system is in a low level of accretion, mostlikely via a stellar wind. this system represents the shortest period whitedwarf + brown dwarf binary and the secondary has survived a stage of commonenvelope evolution, much like its longer period counterpart, wd0137-349. bothsystems likely represent bona-fide progenitors of cataclysmic variables with alow mass white dwarf and a brown dwarf donor.

1407.3301	monte carlo simulations of post-common-envelope white dwarf + main  sequence binaries: the effects of including recombination energy	detached wd+ms pcebs are perhaps the most suitable objects for testingpredictions of close-compact binary-star evolution theories, in particular, ceevolution. the population of wd+ms pcebs has been simulated by several authorsin the past and compared with observations. however, most of those predictionsdid not take the possible contributions to the envelope ejection fromadditional sources of energy (mostly recombination energy) into account. herewe update existing binary population models of wd+ms pcebs by assuming that afraction of the recombination energy available within the envelope contributesto ejecting the envelope. we performed monte carlo simulations of 10^7 ms+msbinaries for 9 different models using standard assumptions for the initialprimary mass function, binary separations, and initial-mass-ratio distributionand evolved these systems using the publicly available bse code. including afraction of recombination energy leads to a clear prediction of a large numberof long orbital period (&gt;~10 days) systems mostly containing high-mass wds. thefraction of systems with he-core wd primaries increases with the ce efficiencyand the existence of very low-mass he wds is only predicted for high values ofthe ce efficiency (&gt;~0.5). all models predict on average longer orbital periodsfor pcebs containing c/o-core wds than for pcebs containing he wds. this effectincreases with increasing values of both efficiencies. longer periods after thece phase are also predicted for systems containing more massive secondarystars. the initial-mass-ratio distribution affects the distribution of orbitalperiods, especially the distribution of secondary star masses. our simulations,in combination with a large and homogeneous observational sample, can provideconstraints on the values of the ce efficiencies, as well as on theinitial-mass-ratio distribution for ms+ms binary stars.

1410.7666	analysis of cool do-type white dwarfs from the sloan digital sky survey  data release 10	we report on the identification of 22 new cool do-type white dwarfs (wd)detected in data release 10 (dr10) of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss).among them, we found one more member of the so-called hot-wind do wds, whichshow ultrahigh excitation absorption lines. our non-lte model atmosphereanalyses of these objects and two not previously analyzed hot-wind do wds,revealed effective temperatures and gravities in the ranges teff=45-80kk andlog g= 7.50-8.75. in eight of the spectra we found traces of c (0.001-0.01, bymass). two of these are the coolest do wds ever discovered that still show aconsiderable amount of c in their atmospheres. this is in strong contradictionwith diffusion calculations, and probably, similar to what is proposed for dbwds, a weak mass-loss is present in do wds. one object is the most massive dowd discovered so far with a mass of 1.07 m_sun if it is an one-wd or 1.09 m_sunif it is a co-wd. we furthermore present the mass distribution of all known hotnon-da (pre-) wds and derive the hot da to non-da ratio for the sdss dr7spectroscopic sample. the mass distribution of do wds beyond the wind limitstrongly deviates from the mass distribution of the objects before the windlimit. we address this phenomenon by applying different evolutionary inputchannels. we argue that the do wd channel may be fed by about 13% bypost-extreme-horizontal branch stars and that pg1159 stars and o(he) stars maycontribute in a similar extent to the non-da wd channel.

1501.03692	hot subdwarf binaries from the muchfuss project - analysis of 12 new  systems and a study of the short-period binary population	the project massive unseen companions to hot faint underluminous stars fromsdss (muchfuss) aims at finding hot subdwarf stars with massive compactcompanions like massive white dwarfs (m&gt;1.0 m$_\odot$), neutron stars, orstellar-mass black holes. we present orbital and atmospheric parameters and putconstraints on the nature of the companions of 12 close hot subdwarf b star(sdb) binaries found in the course of the muchfuss project. the systems showperiods between 0.14 and 7.4 days. three systems most likely have white dwarfcompanions. sdss j083006.17+475150.3 is likely to be a rare example of alow-mass helium-core white dwarf. sdss j095101.28+034757.0 shows an excess inthe infrared that probably originates from a third companion in a wide orbit.sdss j113241.58-063652.8 is the first helium deficient sdo star with aconfirmed close companion. this study brings to 142 the number of sdb binarieswith orbital periods of less than 30 days and with measured mass functions. wepresent an analysis of the minimum companion mass distribution and show that itis bimodal. one peak around 0.1 m$_\odot$ corresponds to the low-mass mainsequence and substellar companions. the other peak around 0.4 m$_\odot$corresponds to the white dwarf companions. the derived masses for the whitedwarf companions are significantly lower than the average mass for singlecarbon-oxygen white dwarfs. in a t$_{\rm eff}$-log(g) diagram of sdb+dmcompanions, we find signs that the sdb components are more massive than therest of the sample. the full sample was compared to the known population ofextremely low-mass white dwarf binaries as well as short-period white dwarfswith main sequence companions. both samples show a significantly differentcompanion mass distribution. we calculate merger timescales and timescales whenthe companion will fill its roche lobe and the system evolves into acataclysmic variable.

1502.04086	the catalogue of radial velocity variable hot subluminous stars from the  muchfuss project	the project massive unseen companions to hot faint underluminous stars fromsdss (muchfuss) aims to find sdbs with compact companions like massive whitedwarfs, neutron stars or black holes. here we provide classifications,atmospheric parameters and a complete radial velocity (rv) catalogue containing1914 single measurements for an sample of 177 hot subluminous stars discoveredbased on sdss dr7. 110 stars show significant rv variability, while 67 qualifyas candidates. we constrain the fraction of close massive compact companions{of hydrogen-rich hot subdwarfs} in our sample to be smaller than $\sim1.3\%$,which is already close to the theoretical predictions. however, the samplemight still contain such binaries with longer periods exceeding $\sim8\,{\rmd}$. we detect a mismatch between the $\delta rv_{\rm max}$-distribution of thesdb and the more evolved sdob and sdo stars, which challenges our understandingof their evolutionary connection. furthermore, irregular rv variations ofunknown origin with amplitudes of up to $\sim180\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ ontimescales of years, days and even hours have been detected in some he-sdostars. they might be connected to irregular photometric variations in somecases.

1506.02980	dynamical masses of a nova-like variable on the edge of the period gap	we present the first dynamical determination of the binary parameters of aneclipsing sw sextantis star in the 3-4 hour orbital period range during a lowstate. we obtained time-resolved optical spectroscopy and photometry of hs0220+0603 during its 2004-2005 low brightness state, as revealed in thecombined smarts, iac80 and m1 group long-term optical light curve.  the optical spectra taken during primary eclipse reveal a secondary starspectral type of m5.5 $\pm$ 0.5 as derived from molecular band-head indices.the spectra also provide the first detection of a dab white dwarf in acataclysmic variable. by modelling its optical spectrum we estimate a whitedwarf temperature of 30000 $\pm$ 5000 k.  by combining the results of modelling the white dwarf eclipse from ultracamlight curves with those obtained by simultaneously fitting the emission- andabsorption-line radial velocity curves and i-band ellipsoidal light curves, wemeasure the stellar masses to be m$_1 = 0.87 \pm 0.09$ m$_\odot$ and m$_2 =0.47 \pm 0.05$ m$_\odot$ for the white dwarf and the m dwarf, respectively, andan inclination of the orbital plane of $i \approx 79^\mathrm{o}$. a radius of$0.0103 \pm 0.0007$ r$_\odot$ is obtained for the white dwarf. the secondarystar in hs 0220+0603 is likely too cool and undersized for its mass.

1506.04748	an independent test of the photometric selection of white dwarf  candidates using lamost dr3	in gentile fusillo et al. (2015) we developed a selection method for whitedwarf candidates which makes use of photometry, colours and proper motions tocalculate a probability of being a white dwarf (pwd). the application of ourmethod to the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 10 resulted innearly 66,000 photometrically selected objects with a derived pwd,approximately 21000 of which are high confidence white dwarf candidates. herewe present an independent test of our selection method based on a sample ofspectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs from the lamost (large sky areamulti-fiber spectroscopic telescope) survey. we do this by cross matching allour $\sim$66,000 sdss photometric white dwarf candidates with the over 4million spectra available in the third data release of lamost. this results in1673 white dwarf candidates with no previous sdss spectroscopy, but withavailable lamost spectra. among these objects we identify 309 genuine whitedwarfs. we find that our pwd can efficiently discriminate between confirmedlamost white dwarfs and contaminants. our white dwarf candidate selectionmethod can be applied to any multi-band photometric survey and in this work weconclusively confirm its reliability in selecting white dwarfs without recourseto spectroscopy. we also discuss the spectroscopic completeness of white dwarfsin lamost, as well as deriving effective temperatures, surface gravities andmasses for the hydrogen-rich atmosphere white dwarfs in the newly identifiedlamost sample.

1507.04663	total eclipse of the heart: the am cvn gaia14aae / assasn-14cn	we report the discovery and characterisation of a deeply eclipsing amcvn-system, gaia14aae (= assasn-14cn). gaia14aae was identified independentlyby the all-sky automated survey for supernovae (asas-sn; shappee et al. 2014)and by the gaia science alerts project, during two separate outbursts. a thirdoutburst is seen in archival pan-starrs-1 (ps1; schlafly et al. 2012; tonry etal. 2012; magnier et al. 2013) and asas-sn data. spectroscopy reveals a hot,hydrogen-deficient spectrum with clear double-peaked emission lines, consistentwith an accreting double degenerate classification. we use follow-up photometryto constrain the orbital parameters of the system. we find an orbital period of49.71 min, which places gaia14aae at the long period extremum of theoutbursting am cvn period distribution. gaia14aae is dominated by the lightfrom its accreting white dwarf. assuming an orbital inclination of 90 degreesfor the binary system, the contact phases of the white dwarf lead to lowerlimits of 0.78 m solar and 0.015 m solar on the masses of the accretor anddonor respectively and a lower limit on the mass ratio of 0.019. gaia14aae isonly the third eclipsing am cvn star known, and the first in which the wd istotally eclipsed. using a helium wd model, we estimate the accretor's effectivetemperature to be 12900+-200 k. the three out-burst events occurred within 4months of each other, while no other outburst activity is seen in the previous8 years of catalina real-time transient survey (crts; drake et al. 2009),pan-starrs-1 and asas-sn data. this suggests that these events might berebrightenings of the first outburst rather than individual events.

0805.4700	how many cvs are crossing the period gap? a test for the disruption of  magnetic braking	we apply population synthesis techniques to calculate the present day numberof two types of white dwarf-main sequence star (wdms) binaries within thecataclysmic variable period gap. the first are post-common envelope binarieswith secondary stars that have masses between 0.17 and 0.36 msun (gpcebs), suchthat they will commence mass transfer within the period gap. the second typeare systems that were cvs at some point in their past, but detached once theyevolved down in orbital period to ~3 h as a consequence of disrupted magneticbraking, and are crossing the period gap via gravitational radiation (dcvs).full population synthesis calculations are performed where we assume eitherconstant, global values of the common envelope ejection efficiency, or considerthe ejection efficiency as a function of secondary mass. several forms ofmagnetic braking are also considered. we predict an excess of dcvs over gpcebswithin the period gap of ~4 to ~13 assuming an ejection efficiency between 0.1and 0.6, and a flat initial mass ratio distribution. this excess is revealed asa prominent peak at the location of the period gap in the orbital perioddistribution of the combined gpceb and dcv population. we suggest that if sucha feature is observed in the orbital period distribution of an observed sampleof short orbital period wdms binaries, this would strongly corroborate thedisruption of magnetic braking.

astro-ph;9909069	time-resolved hst and iue uv spectroscopy of the intermediate polar fo  aqr	time resolved spectroscopy of the intermediate polar fo aqr reveals thepresence of multiple periodicities in the uv range. a strong orbital modulationdominates both continuum and emission line flux variabilities, while linevelocity motions are only detected at the rotational frequency. a prominentorbital periodicity is also observed in coordinated optical photometry, wherefo aqr was previously found to be spin dominated. the spectral dependence ofthe main periodicities shows the presence of multi-temperature components in foaqr and for the first time a hot and a cool component in the rotationalmodulation. from a comparison with previous uv and optical data obtained in1990, no spectral variations in the orbital and rotational variabilities aredetected, indicating no significant changes in the effects of x-rayillumination but rather a shrinking of the accretion curtain accompained by anincrease in size of the thickened part of the accretion disc. theseobservations, consistent with the recently discovered long term trend in thex-ray pulsation amplitudes, independently confirm a change in the accretionmode in fo aqr, which switched from a disc-fed into a disc-overflow state,likely triggered by mass accretion variations.

0810.2547	high spatial resolution galactic 3d extinction mapping with iphas	we present an algorithm ({\scshape mead}, for `mapping extinction againstdistance') which will determine intrinsic ($r' - i'$) colour, extinction, anddistance for early-a to k4 stars extracted from the iphas $r'/i'/\halpha$photometric database. these data can be binned up to map extinction in threedimensions across the northern galactic plane. the large size of the iphasdatabase ($\sim 200$ million unique objects), the accuracy of the digitalphotometry it contains and its faint limiting magnitude ($r' \sim 20$) allowextinction to be mapped with fine angular ($ \sim 10 $ arcmin) and distance($\sim 0.1$ ~kpc) resolution to distances of up to 10 kpc, outside the solarcircle. high reddening within the solar circle on occasion brings this rangedown to $\sim 2$ kpc. the resolution achieved, both in angle and depth, greatlyexceeds that of previous empirical 3d extinction maps, enabling the structureof the galactic plane to be studied in increased detail. {\scshape mead}accounts for the effect of the survey magnitude limits, photometric errors,unresolved ism substructure, and binarity. the impact of metallicityvariations, within the range typical of the galactic disc is small. theaccuracy and reliability of {\scshape mead} are tested through the use ofsimulated photometry created with monte-carlo sampling techniques. the successof this algorithm is demonstrated on a selection of fields and the results arecompared to the literature.

0812.2510	post common envelope binaries from sdss. v: four eclipsing white dwarf  main sequence binaries	we identify sdss011009.09+132616.1, sdss030308.35+005444.1,sdss143547.87+373338.5 and sdss154846.00+405728.8 as four eclipsing white dwarfplus main sequence (wdms) binaries from the sloan digital sky survey, andreport on follow-up observations of these systems. orbital periods andephemerides have been established from multi-season photometry. sdss1435+3733,with porb=3h has the shortest orbital period of all known eclipsing wdmsbinaries. time-resolved spectroscopic observations have been obtained and theradial velocities of the secondary stars in all four systems were measured. aspectral decomposition/fitting technique was then employed to determine thewhite dwarf effective temperatures and surface gravities, as well as thespectral types of the companion stars. we used a light curve modeling code tofurther constrain the masses and radii of the components in all systems. allthree da white dwarfs have masses of mwd~0.4-0.6msun, in line with theexpectations from close binary evolution. the dc white dwarf in sdss0303+0054has a mass of mwd&gt;0.85msun, making it unusually massive for a post-commonenvelope system. our new additions raise the number of known eclipsing wdmsbinaries to fourteen, and we find that the average white dwarf mass in thissample is &lt;mwd&gt;=0.57+/-0.16msun, only slightly lower than the average mass ofsingle white dwarfs. the majority of all eclipsing wdms binaries containlow-mass (&lt;0.6msun) secondary stars, and will eventually provide valuableobservational input for the calibration of the mass-radius relations oflow-mass main sequence stars and of white dwarfs.
