0902.4720	integral field spectroscopy of ionized and molecular gas in cool cluster  cores: evidence for cold feedback?	we present vlt-sinfoni k-band ifu spectroscopy of the central galaxies in thecool core clusters a1664, a2204 and pks 0745-191, to probe the pa-alpha andro-vibrational h2 line emission. in a1664 the two emission-line velocitysystems seen in our previous h-alpha data appear in both pa-alpha and h2emission, with notable morphological differences. the recession velocity of thered component of pa-alpha increases linearly with decreasing radius,particularly along an 8 kpc filament aligned with the major axis of theunderlying galaxy and the cluster x-ray emission. these kinematics are modelledas gravitational free-fall as gas cools rapidly out of the hot phase. in a2204the gas shows 3 or 4 filaments reaching 10 kpc, three of which lie towards`ghost bubbles' seen in x-ray imaging. for pks 0745-191, we confirm thetwin-arm morphology of previous narrow-band images; the pa-alpha kinematicssuggest rotational motion about an axis aligned with the kpc-scale radio jet;on nucleus, we find a broad pa-alpha component (fwhm 1700 km/s) and a secondaryh2 system redshifted by +500 km/s.  the h2 v=1-0 s(3)/pa-alpha ratio is highest in isolated and extended regionswhere it matches the levels in the ngc 1275 filaments as modelled by ferland etal. regions with lower ratios highlight active star formation and are oftenkinematically quiescent (fwhm &lt; 200 km/s). our findings suggest that theseclusters may be captured in different stages of the `cold feedback' cycle ofpizzolato &amp; soker, with a1664 in a brief phase of extreme cooling and starformation prior to an agn heating event; pks 0745-191 in outburst with the agnaccreting from a cool gas disk, and a2204 in a later phase where cool gas isdragged out of the galaxy by the buoyant rise of old radio bubbles (abridged).

0907.1093	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields -- i. maps,  catalogues, and source counts	we present the first results from the largest deep extragalacticmillimetre-wavelength survey undertaken to date. these results are derived frommaps covering over 0.7 deg^2, made at 1.1mm, using the aztec continuum cameramounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope. the maps were made in the twofields originally targeted at 0.85mm with scuba in the shades project, namelythe lockman hole east (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mjy rms) and the subaru xmmdeep field (1.0-1.7 mjy rms). the wealth of existing and forthcoming deepmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm sourcepopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequentpapers. here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114high-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statisticalanalysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm sourcenumber counts. through careful comparison, we find that both the cosmos andgoods north fields, also imaged with aztec, contain an excess of mm sourcesover the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. in particular, ournew aztec/shades results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dustenshrouded starbursts (s_{1.1} &gt; 3 mjy) are 25-50% less common than would havebeen inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential rolesof cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. we compare number countpredictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population tothese smg surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoingrefinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, andfind that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetregalaxies found in this survey.

0910.1091	blast: the far-infrared/radio correlation in distant galaxies	we investigate the correlation between far-infrared (fir) and radioluminosities in distant galaxies, a lynchpin of modern astronomy. we use datafrom the balloon-borne large aperture submillimetre telescope (blast), spitzer,the large apex bolometer camera (laboca), the very large array (vla) and thegiant metre-wave radio telescope (gmrt) in the extended chandra deep fieldsouth (ecdfs). for a catalogue of blast 250-micron-selected galaxies, were-measure the 70--870-micron flux densities at the positions of their mostlikely 24-micron counterparts, which have a median [interquartile] redshift of0.74 [0.25, 1.57]. from these, we determine the monochromatic flux densityratio, q_250 = log_10 (s_250micron / s_1400mhz), and the bolometric equivalent,q_ir. at z ~= 0.6, where our 250-micron filter probes rest-frame 160-micronemission, we find no evolution relative to q_160 for local galaxies. we alsostack the fir and submm images at the positions of 24-micron- andradio-selected galaxies. the difference between q_ir seen for 250-micron- andradio-selected galaxies suggests star formation provides most of the irluminosity in ~&lt; 100-ujy radio galaxies, but rather less for those in the mjyregime. for the 24-micron sample, the radio spectral index is constant across 0&lt; z &lt; 3, but q_ir exhibits tentative evidence of a steady decline such thatq_ir is proportional to (1+z)^(-0.15 +/- 0.03) - significant evolution,spanning the epoch of galaxy formation, with major implications for techniquesthat rely on the fir/radio correlation. we compare with model predictions andspeculate that we may be seeing the increase in radio activity that gives riseto the radio background.

0910.5756	molecular gas in submillimetre-faint, star-forming ultraluminous  galaxies at z&gt;1	[abridged] we present interferometric co observations of twelve z~2submillimetre-faint, star-forming radio galaxies (sfrgs) which are thought tobe ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) possibly dominated by warmer dust(t_dust ~&gt; 40 k) than submillimetre galaxies (smgs) of similar luminosities.four other co-observed sfrgs are included from the literature, and allobservations are taken at the plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi) in thecompact configuration. ten of the sixteen sfrgs observed in co (63%) aredetected at &gt;4sigma with a mean inferred molecular gas mass of ~2*10^10 m_sun.sfrgs trend slightly above the local ulirg l_fir-l'_co relation. since sfrgsare about two times fainter in radio luminosity but exhibit similar columinosities to smgs, this suggests sfrgs are slightly more efficient starformers than smgs at the same redshifts. sfrgs also have a narrow mean co linewidth, 320+-80km/s. sfrgs bridge the gap between properties of very luminous&gt;5*10^12 l_sun smgs and those of local ulirgs and are consistent withintermediate stage major mergers. we suspect that more moderate-luminositysmgs, not yet surveyed in co, would show similar molecular gas properties tosfrgs. the agn fraction of sfrgs is consistent with smgs and is estimated to be0.3+-0.1, suggesting that sfrgs are observed near the peak phase of starformation activity and not in a later, post-smg enhanced agn phase. this cosurvey of sfrgs serves as a pilot project for the much more extensive survey ofherschel and scuba-2 selected sources which only partially overlap with smgs.better constraints on co properties of a diverse high-z ulirg population areneeded from alma to determine the evolutionary origin of extreme starbursts,and what role ulirgs serve in catalyzing the formation of massive stellarsystems in the early universe.

0912.1591	gas, dust and stars in the scuba galaxy, smm j02399-0136: the evla  reveals a colossal galactic nursery	we present new multi-wavelength observations of the first submm-selectedgalaxy, smm j02399-0136 at z=2.8. these observations include mapping of the coj=1-0 emission using elements of the expanded vla, as well as high-resolution1.4-ghz imaging and optical/ir data from the vla, hst, spitzer and keck.together these new data provide fundamental insights into the mass anddistribution of stars, gas and dust within this archetypal smg. the co j=1-0emission, with its minimal excitation and density requirements, traces the bulkof the metal-rich molecular gas, and reveals a mass of ~10^11 m(sun), extendingover ~5" (~25 kpc in the source plane), although there is tentative evidencethat it may be significantly larger. our data suggest that three or moredistinct structures are encompassed by this molecular gas reservoir, includingthe bal quasar from which the redshift of the smg was initially determined. inparticular, the new rest-frame near-ir observations identify a massive,obscured, starburst coincident with a previously known ly-alpha cloud. thisstarburst dominates the far-ir emission from the system and requires are-assessment of previous claims that the gas reservoir resides in a massive,extended disk around the bal qso. instead it appears that smm j02399-0136comprises a merger between a far-ir-luminous, but highly obscured starburst,the bal qso host and a faint third component. our findings suggest that thissmg and its immediate environment mark a vast and complex galactic nursery andthat detailed studies of other smgs are likely to uncover a similarly richdiversity of properties.

1003.0447	mid-infrared spectroscopy of candidate agn-dominated submillimeter  galaxies	spitzer spectroscopy has revealed that ~80% of submm galaxies (smgs) arestarburst (sb) dominated in the mid-infrared. here we focus on the remaining~20% that show signs of harboring powerful active galactic nuclei (agn). wehave obtained spitzer-irs spectroscopy of a sample of eight smgs which arecandidates for harboring powerful agn on the basis of irac color-selection(s8/s4.5&gt;2; i.e. likely power-law mid-infrared seds). smgs with an agndominating (&gt;50%) their mid-infrared emission could represent `missing link'sources in an evolutionary sequence involving a major merger. first of all, wedetect pah features in all of the smgs, indicating redshifts from 2.5-3.4,demonstrating the power of the mid-infrared to determine redshifts for theseoptically faint dusty galaxies. secondly, we see signs of both star-formation(from the pah features) and agn activity (from continuum emission) in oursample: 62% of the sample are agn-dominated in the mid-infrared with a medianagn content of 56%, compared with &lt;30% on average for typical smgs, revealingthat our irac color selection has successfully singled out sources withproportionately more agn emission than typical sb-dominated smgs. however, wefind that only about 10% of these agn dominate the bolometric emission of thesmg when the results are extrapolated to longer infrared wavelengths, implyingthat agn are not a significant power source to the smg population overall, evenwhen there is evidence in the mid-infrared for substantial agn activity. whenexisting samples of mid-infrared agn-dominated smgs are considered, we findthat s8/s4.5&gt;1.65 works well at selecting mid-infrared energetically dominantagn in smgs, implying a duty cycle of ~15% if all smgs go through a subsequentmid-infrared agn-dominated phase in the proposed evolutionary sequence.

0708.0753	the baryonic and dark matter properties of high redshift gravitationally  lensed disk galaxies	we present a detailed study of the structural properties of fourgravitationally lensed disk galaxies at z=1. modelling the rotation curves onsub-kpc scales we derive the values for the disk mass, the reference darkmatter density and core radius, and the angular momentum per unit mass. thederived models suggest that the rotation curve profile and amplitude are bestfit with a dark matter component similar to those of local spiral galaxies. thestellar component also has a similar length scale, but with substantiallysmaller masses than similarly luminous disk galaxies in the local universe.comparing the average dark matter density inside the optical radius we findthat the disk galaxies at z=1 have larger densities (by up to a factor of 7)than similar disk galaxies in the local universe. furthermore, the angularmomentum per unit mass versus reference velocity is well matched to the localrelation, suggesting that the angular momentum of the disk remains constantbetween high redshifts and the present day. though statistically limited, theseobservations point towards a spirals' formation scenario in which stellar disksare slowly grown by the accretion of angular momentum conserving material.

1006.2137	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south: a  photometric redshift survey of submillimetre galaxies	[abridged] we derive photometric redshifts from 17-band optical to mid-irphotometry of 74 robust counterparts to 68 of the 126 submillimetre galaxies(smgs) selected at 870um by laboca observations in the ecdfs. the medianphotometric redshift of identified smgs is z=2.2\pm0.1, the interquartile rangeis z=1.8-2.7 and we identify 10 (~15%) high-redshift (z&gt;3) smgs. we derive asimple redshift estimator for smgs based on the 3.6 and 8um fluxes, which isaccurate to delta_z~0.4 for smgs at z&lt;4. a statistical analysis of sourcesaround unidentified smgs identifies a population of likely counterparts with aredshift distribution peaking at z=2.5\pm0.3, which likely comprises ~60% ofthe unidentified smgs. this confirms that the bulk of the undetected smgs arecoeval with those detected in the radio/mid-ir. we conclude that ~15% of allthe smgs are below the flux limits of our survey and lie at z&gt;3 and hence ~30%of all smgs have z&gt;3. we estimate that the full s_870um&gt;4mjy smg population hasa median redshift of 2.5\pm0.6. in contrast to previous suggestions we find nosignificant correlation between s_870um and redshift. the median stellar massof the smgs derived from sed fitting is (9.2\pm0.9)x10^10msun and theinterquartile range is (4.7-14)x10^10msun, although we caution that uncertaintyin the star-formation histories results in a factor of ~5 uncertainty in thesestellar masses. the median characteristic dust temperature of smgs is35.9\pm1.4k and the interquartile range is 28.5-43.3k. the infrared luminosityfunction shows that smgs at z=2-3 typically have higher far-ir luminosities andluminosity density than those at z=1-2. this is mirrored in the evolution ofthe star-formation rate density (sfrd) for smgs which peaks at z~2. the maximumcontribution of bright smgs to the global sfrd (~5% for smgs with s_870um&gt;4mjy;~50% for smgs with s_870um&gt;1mjy) also occurs at z~2.

1010.4312	spectroscopic confirmation of a galaxy at redshift z=8.6	galaxies had their most significant impact on the universe when theyassembled their first generations of stars. energetic photons emitted by young,massive stars in primeval galaxies ionized the intergalactic medium surroundingtheir host galaxies, cleared sight-lines along which the light of the younggalaxies could escape, and fundamentally altered the physical state of theintergalactic gas in the universe continuously until the present day.observations of the cosmic microwave background, and of galaxies and quasars atthe highest redshifts, suggest that the universe was reionised through acomplex process that was completed about a billion years after the big bang, byredshift z~6. detecting ionizing ly-alpha photons from increasingly distantgalaxies places important constraints on the timing, location and nature of thesources responsible for reionisation. here we report the detection of ly-aphotons emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang. udfy-38135539is at a redshift z=8.5549+-0.0002, which is greater than those of thepreviously known most distant objects, at z=8.2 and z=6.97. we find that thissingle source is unlikely to provide enough photons to ionize the volumenecessary for the emission line to escape, requiring a significant contributionfrom other, probably fainter galaxies nearby.

1103.3277	metallicity gradient of a lensed face-on spiral galaxy at redshift 1.49	we present the first metallicity gradient measurement for a grand-designface-on spiral galaxy at z~1.5. this galaxy has been magnified by a factor of22$\times$ by a massive, x-ray luminous galaxy cluster macs\,j1149.5+2223 atz=0.544. using the laser guide star adaptive optics aided integral fieldspectrograph osiris on keck ii, we target the halpha emission and achieve aspatial resolution of 0.1", corresponding to a source plane resolution of 170pc. the galaxy has well-developed spiral arms and the nebular emission linedynamics clearly indicate a rotationally supported disk with v_{rot}/\sigma~4.the best-fit disk velocity field model yields a maximum rotation of v_{rot}sin{i}=150$\pm$15 km s^{-1}, and a dynamical mass ofm_{dyn}=1.3$\pm0.2\times10^{10}csc^2(i) m_{\odot} (within 2.5\,kpc), where theinclination angle i=45$\pm10^{\circ}$. based on the [nii] and halpha ratios, wemeasured the radial chemical abundance gradient from the inner hundreds ofparsecs out to ~5 kpc. the slope of the gradient is -0.16$\pm$0.02 dexkpc$^{-1}$, significantly steeper than the gradient of late-type or early-typegalaxies in the local universe. if representative of disk galaxies at z~1.5,our results support an "inside-out" disk formation scenario in which earlyinfall/collapse in the galaxy center builds a chemically enriched nucleus,followed by slow enrichment of the disk over the next 9 gyr.

1104.1758	the potential influence of far-infrared emission lines on the selection  of high-redshift galaxies	we investigate whether strong molecular and atomic emission lines atfar-infrared wavelengths can influence the identification and derivedproperties of galaxies selected from broad-band, far-infrared or submillimetreobservations. several of these lines, e.g. [cii]158um, have been found to bevery bright in some high-redshift galaxies, with fluxes of &gt;0.1-1% of the totalfar-infrared luminosity, and may be even brighter in certain populations athigh redshifts. at redshifts where these lines fall in instrument pass-bandsthey can significantly increase the broad-band flux measurements. we estimatethat the contributions from line emission could boost the apparent broad-bandflux by &gt;20-40% in the herschel and scuba-2 bands. combined with the steepsource counts in the submillimetre and far-infrared bands, line contaminationhas potentially significant consequences for the properties of sources detectedin flux-limited continuum surveys, biasing the derived redshift distributionsand bolometric luminosities. indeed, it is possible that some z&gt;4 sources foundin 850-um surveys are being identified in part due to line contamination fromstrong [cii] emission. these biases may be even stronger for less-luminous andlower-metallicity populations at high redshifts which are observable with almaand which may have even stronger line-to-continuum ratios.

1107.2924	gas and dust in a submillimeter galaxy at z = 4.24 from the herschel  atlas	we report ground-based follow-up observations of the exceptional source,id141, one the brightest sources detected so far in the h-atlas cosmologicalsurvey. id141 was observed using the iram 30-meter telescope and plateau debure interferometer (pdbi), the submillimeter array (sma) and the atacamapathfinder experiment (apex) submillimeter telescope to measure the dustcontinuum and emission lines of the main isotope of carbon monoxide and carbon([c i] and [c ii]). the detection of strong co emission lines with the pdbiconfirms that id141 is at high redshift (z=4.243 +/- 0.001). the strength ofthe continuum and emission lines suggests that id141 is gravitationally lensed.the width (delta v (fwhm) ~ 800 km/s}) and asymmetric profiles of the co andcarbon lines indicate orbital motion in a disc or a merger. the propertiesderived for id141 are compatible with a ultraluminous (l_fir ~ 8.5 +/- 0.3 x10^13/mu_l lsun, where mu_l is the amplification factor, dense (n ~ 10^4 cm^-3)and warm (t_kin ~ 40k) starburst galaxy, with an estimated star-formation rateof (0.7 to 1.7) x 10^4/mu_l msun/yr. the carbon emission lines indicate a dense(n ~ 10^4 cm^-3) photo-dominated region, illuminated by a far-uv radiationfield a few thousand times more intense than that in our galaxy. in conclusion,the physical properties of the high-z galaxy, id141, are remarkably similar tothose of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies.

1107.4979	observation of h2o in a strongly lensed herschel-atlas source at z=2.3	the herschel survey, h-atlas, with its large areal coverage, has recentlydiscovered a number of bright, strongly lensed high-z submillimeter galaxies.the strong magnification makes it possible to study molecular species otherthan co, which are otherwise difficult to observe in high-z galaxies. among thelensed galaxies already identified by h-atlas, the source j090302.9-014127b(sdp.17b) at z = 2.305 is remarkable due to its excitation conditions and atentative detection of the h2o 202-111 emission line (lupu et al. 2010). wereport observations of this line in sdp.17b using the iram interferometerequipped with its new 277- 371ghz receivers. the h2o line is detected at aredshift of z = 2.3049+/-0.0006, with a flux of 7.8+/-0.5 jy km s-1 and a fwhmof 250+/-60 km s-1. the new flux is 2.4 times weaker than the previoustentative detection, although both remain marginally consistent within1.6-sigma. the intrinsic line luminosity and ratio of h2o(202-111)/co8-7 seemcomparable with those of the nearby starburst/enshrouded-agn mrk 231,suggesting that sdp.17b could also host a luminous agn. the detection of astrong h2o 202-111 line in sdp.17b implies an efficient excitation mechanism ofthe water levels that must occur in very dense and warm interstellar gas.

1108.0420	luminous starbursts in the redshift desert at z~1-2: star formation  rates, masses &amp; evidence for outflows	we present a spectroscopic catalogue of 40 luminous starburst galaxies atz=0.7--1.7 (median z=1.3). 19 of these are submillimetre galaxies (smgs) and 21are submillimetre-faint radio galaxies (sfrgs). this sample helps to fill inthe redshift desert at z=1.2--1.7 in previous studies as well as probing alower luminosity population of galaxies. radio fluxes are used to determinestar-formation rates for our sample which range from around 50 to 500 m$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ and are generally lower than those in z$\sim$2 smgs. we identifynebular [oii] 3727 emission in the rest-uv spectra and use the linewidths toshow that smgs and sfrgs in our sample have larger linewidths and thereforedynamical masses than optically selected star-forming galaxies at similarredshifts. the linewidths are indistinguishable from those measured in thez$\sim$2 smg populations suggesting little evolution in the dynamical masses ofthe galaxies between redshift 1--2. [nev] and [neiii] emission lines areidentified in a subset of the spectra indicating the presence of an activegalactic nucleus (agn). in addition, a host of interstellar absorption linescorresponding to transitions of mgii and feii ions are also detected. thesefeatures show up prominently in composite spectra and we use these compositesto demonstrate that the absorption lines are present at an average blueshift of$-240\pm$50 kms$^{-1}$ relative to the systemic velocities of the galaxiesderived from [oii]. this indicates the presence of large-scale outflowinginterstellar gas in these systems (abridged)

1109.3301	strong lensing by a node of the cosmic web. the core of macs  j0717.5+3745 at z=0.55	we present results of a strong-lensing analysis of macs j0717.5+3745(hereafter macs j0717), an extremely x-ray luminous galaxy cluster at z=0.55.observations at different wavelengths reveal a complex and dynamically veryactive cluster, whose core is connected to a large scale filament extended overseveral mpc. using multi-passband imaging data obtained with the hubble spacetelescope advanced camera for surveys (acs), we identify 15 multiply imagedsystems across the full field of view of acs, five of which we confirmedspectroscopically in groundbased follow-up observations with the kecktelescope. we use these multiply imaged systems to constrain a parametric modelof the mass distribution in the cluster core, employing a new parallelizedversion of the lenstool software. the main result is that the most probabledescription of the mass distribution comprises four cluster-scale dark matterhaloes. the total mass distribution follows the light distribution but stronglydeviates from the distribution of the intra-cluster gas as traced by the x-raysurface brightness. this confirms the complex morphology proposed by previousstudies. we interpret this segregation of collisional and collisionless matteras strong evidence of multiple mergers and ongoing dynamical activity. macsj0717 thus constitutes one of the most disturbed clusters presently known and,featuring a projected mass within the acs field of view (r=150"=960 kpc) of2.11 +- 0.23 x 10^{15} m_{sun}, the system is also one of the most massiveknown.

1112.0321	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south: clustering  of submillimetre galaxies	we present a measurement of the spatial clustering of submillimetre galaxies(smgs) at z = 1-3. using data from the 870 micron less survey, we employ anovel technique to measure the cross-correlation between smgs and galaxies,accounting for the full probability distributions for photometric redshifts ofthe galaxies. from the observed projected two-point cross-correlation functionwe derive the linear bias and characteristic dark matter (dm) halo masses forthe smgs. we detect clustering in the cross-correlation between smgs andgalaxies at the &gt; 4 sigma level. for the smg autocorrelation we obtain r_0 =7.7 (+1.8,-2.3) h^-1 mpc, and derive a corresponding dm halo mass of log(m_halo[h^-1 m_sun]) = 12.8 (+0.3,-0.5). based on the evolution of dm haloes derivedfrom simulations, we show that that the z = 0 descendants of smgs are typicallymassive (~2-3 l*) elliptical galaxies residing in moderate- to high-mass groups(log(m_halo [h^-1 m_sun]) = 13.3 (+0.3,-0.5). from the observed clustering weestimate an smg lifetime of ~100 myr, consistent with lifetimes derived fromgas consumption times and star-formation timescales, although with considerableuncertainties. the clustering of smgs at z ~ 2 is consistent with measurementsfor optically-selected quasi-stellar objects (qsos), supporting evolutionaryscenarios linking starbursts and qsos. given that smgs reside in haloes ofcharacteristic mass ~ 6 x 10^12 h^-1 m_sun, we demonstrate that the redshiftdistribution of smgs can be described remarkably well by the combination of twoeffects: the cosmological growth of structure and the evolution of themolecular gas fraction in galaxies. we conclude that the powerful starbursts insmgs likely represent a short-lived but universal phase in massive galaxyevolution, associated with the transition between cold gas-rich, star-forminggalaxies and passively evolving systems.

1112.4848	the relation between line emission and brightest cluster galaxies in  three exceptional clusters: evidence for gas cooling from the icm	there is a strong spatial correlation between brightest cluster galaxies(bcgs) and the peak density and cooling rate of the intra-cluster medium (icm).in this paper we combine integral field spectroscopy, co observations and x-raydata to study three exceptional clusters (abell 1991, abell 3444 and ophiuchus)where there is a physical and dynamical offset between the bcg and the coolingpeak to investigate the connection between the cooling of the intraclustermedium, the cold gas being deposited and the central galaxy. we find themajority of the optical line emission is spatially coincident with the peak inthe soft x-rays. in the case of a1991 we make separate detections of co(2-1)emission on the bcg and on the peak of the soft x-ray emission suggesting thatcooling continues to occur in the core despite being offset from the bcg. weconclude that there is a causal link between the lowest temperature (&lt; 2 kev)icm gas and the molecular gas(~ 30k). this link is only apparent in systemswhere a transitory event has decoupled the bcg from the soft x-ray peak. wediscuss the prospects for identifying more examples of this rare configuration.

1202.0761	a herschel view of the far-infrared properties of submillimetre galaxies	we study a sample of 61 submillimetre galaxies (smgs) selected fromground-based surveys, with known spectroscopic redshifts and observed withherschel as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key programmes. we use the broadfar-infrared wavelength coverage (100-600um) provided by the combination ofpacs and spire observations. using a power-law temperature distribution modelto derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dustemissivity spectral index for smgs of beta=2.0+/-0.2. our results unveil thediversity of the smg population. some smgs exhibit extreme infraredluminosities of ~10^13 lsun and relatively warm dust components, while othersare fainter (~10^12 lsun) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. theextreme infrared luminosities of some smgs (lir&gt;10^12.7 lsun, 26/61 systems)imply sfrs of &gt;500msun yr^-1. such high sfrs are difficult to reconcile with asecular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-drivenstage in the evolution of these galaxies. another observational argument infavour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than thatof smgs of lower luminosities (~40k as opposed to ~25k), consistent withobservations of local ulirgs triggered by major mergers and with results fromhydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfercalculations. luminous smgs are also offset from normal star-forming galaxiesin the stellar mass-sfr plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburstevents with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. onthe other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity smgs havecold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of starformation, and thus might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation.[abridged]

1205.1801	energetic galaxy-wide outflows in high-redshift ultra-luminous infrared  galaxies hosting agn activity	we present integral field spectroscopy observations, covering the [oiii]4959,5007 emission-line doublet of eight high-redshift (z=1.4-3.4)ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) that host active galactic nuclei(agn) activity, including known sub-millimetre luminous galaxies (smgs). thetargets have moderate radio luminosities that are typical of high-redshiftulirgs (l(1.4ghz)=10^(24)-10^(25)w/hz) and therefore are not radio-loud agn. wede-couple kinematic components due to the galaxy dynamics and mergers fromthose due to outflows. we find evidence in the four most luminous systems (l([oiii])&gt;~10^(43)erg/s) for the signatures of large-scale energetic outflows:extremely broad [o iii] emission (fwhm ~ 700-1400km/s) across ~4-15kpc, withhigh velocity offsets from the systemic redshifts (up to ~850km/s). the fourless luminous systems have lower quality data displaying weaker evidence forspatially extended outflows. we estimate that these outflows are potentiallydepositing energy into their host galaxies at considerable rates(~10^(43)-10^(45)erg/s); however, due to the lack of constraints on the densityof the outflowing material and the structure of the outflow, these estimatesshould be taken as illustrative only. based on the measured maximum velocities(v(max)~400-1400km/s) the outflows observed are likely to unbind some fractionof the gas from their host galaxies, but are unlikely to completely remove gasfrom the galaxy haloes. by using a combination of energetic arguments and acomparison to ulirgs without clear evidence for agn activity, we show that theagn activity could be the dominant power source for driving all of the observedoutflows, although star formation may also play a significant role in some ofthe sources.

1209.3016	no clear submillimetre signature of suppressed star formation amongst  x-ray luminous agns	many theoretical models require powerful active galactic nuclei (agns) tosuppress star formation in distant galaxies and reproduce the observedproperties of today's massive galaxies. a recent study based on herschel-spiresubmillimetre observations claimed to provide direct support for this picture,reporting a significant decrease in the mean star-formation rates (sfrs) of themost luminous agns (lx&gt;10^44 erg/s) at z=1-3 in the chandra deep field-north(cdf-n). in this letter we extend these results using herschel-spire 250um datain the cosmos and cdf-s fields to achieve an order of magnitude improvement inthe number of sources at lx&gt;10^44 erg/s. on the basis of our analysis, we findno strong evidence for suppressed star formation in lx&gt;10^44 erg/s agns atz=1-3. the mean sfrs of the agns are constant over the broad x-ray luminosityrange of lx~10^43-10^45 erg/s (with mean sfrs consistent with typicalstar-forming galaxies at z~2; &lt;sfrs&gt;~100-200 msol/yr). we suggest that theprevious cdf-n results were likely due to low number statistics. we discuss ourresults in the context of current theoretical models.

1209.3805	the a2667 giant arc at z=1.03: evidence for large-scale shocks at high  redshift	we present the spatially resolved emission line ratio properties of a ~10^10m_sun star-forming galaxy at redshift z=1.03. this galaxy is gravitationallylensed as a triple-image giant arc behind the massive lensing cluster abell2667. the main image of the galaxy has magnification factors of 14+/-2.1 influx and ~ 2 by 7 in area, yielding an intrinsic spatial resolution of 115-405pc after ao correction with osiris at keck ii. the hst morphology shows aclumpy structure and the h\alpha\ kinematics indicates a large velocitydispersion with v_{max} sin(i)/\sigma ~ 0.73, consistent with high redshiftdisk galaxies of similar masses. from the [nii]/h\alpha\ line ratios, we findthat the central 350 parsec of the galaxy is dominated by star formation. the[nii]/h\alpha\ line ratios are higher in the outer-disk than in the centralregions. most noticeably, we find a blue-shifted region of strong[nii]/h\alpha\ emission in the outer disk. applying our recent hii region andslow-shock models, we propose that this elevated [nii]/h\alpha\ ratio region iscontaminated by a significant fraction of shock excitation due to galacticoutflows. our analysis suggests that shocked regions may mimic flat or invertedmetallicity gradients at high redshift.

1209.5741	hubble space telescope h-alpha imaging of star-forming galaxies at z =  1-1.5: evolution in the size and luminosity of giant hii regions	we present hst/wfc3 narrowband imaging of the h-alpha emission in a sample ofeight gravitationally-lensed galaxies at z = 1 - 1.5. the magnification causedby the foreground clusters enables us to obtain a median source plane spatialresolution of 360pc, as well as providing magnifications in flux ranging from~10x to ~50x. this enables us to identify resolved star-forming hii regions atthis epoch and therefore study their h-alpha luminosity distributions forcomparisons with equivalent samples at z ~ 2 and in the local universe. we findevolution in the both luminosity and surface brightness of hii regions withredshift. the distribution of clump properties can be quantified with an hiiregion luminosity function, which can be fit by a power law with an exponentialbreak at some cut-off, and we find that the cut-off evolves with redshift. wetherefore conclude that `clumpy' galaxies are seen at high redshift because ofthe evolution of the cut-off mass; the galaxies themselves follow similarscaling relations to those at z = 0, but their hii regions are larger andbrighter and thus appear as clumps which dominate the morphology of the galaxy.a simple theoretical argument based on gas collapsing on scales of the jeansmass in a marginally unstable disk shows that the clumpy morphologies of high-zgalaxies are driven by the competing effects of higher gas fractions causingperturbations on larger scales, partially compensated by higher epicyclicfrequencies which stabilise the disk.

1211.6668	the scuba-2 cosmology legacy survey: blank-field number counts of  450um-selected galaxies and their contribution to the cosmic infrared  background	the first deep blank-field 450um map (1-sigma~1.3mjy) from the scuba-2cosmology legacy survey (s2cls), conducted with the james clerk maxwelltelescope (jcmt) is presented. our map covers 140 arcmin^2 of the cosmos field,in the footprint of the hst candels area. using 60 submillimetre galaxies(smgs) detected at &gt;3.75-sigma, we evaluate the number counts of 450um-selectedgalaxies with flux densities s_450&gt;5mjy. the 8-arcsec jcmt beam and highsensitivity of scuba-2 now make it possible to directly resolve a largerfraction of the cosmic infrared background (cib, peaking at ~200um) into theindividual galaxies responsible for its emission than has previously beenpossible at this wavelength. at s_450&gt;5mjy we resolve (7.4[+/-]0.7)x10^-2mjy/sr of the cib at 450um (equivalent to 16[+/-]7% of the absolute brightnessmeasured by cobe at this wavelength) into point sources. a further ~40% of thecib can be recovered through a statistical stack of 24um emitters in thisfield, indicating that the majority (~60%) of the cib at 450um is emitted bygalaxies with s_450&gt;2mjy. the average redshift of 450um emitters identifiedwith an optical/near-infrared counterpart is estimated to be &lt;z&gt;=1.3, implyingthat the galaxies in the sample are in the ultraluminous class (l_ir~1.1x10^12l_sun). if the galaxies contributing to the statistical stack lie at similarredshifts, then the majority of the cib at 450um is emitted by galaxies in thelirg class with l_ir&gt;3.6x10^11 l_sun.

1301.3922	concurrent supermassive black hole and galaxy growth: linking  environment and nuclear activity in z = 2.23 h-alpha emitters	we present results from a ~100 ks chandra observation of the 2qz cluster1004+00 structure at z = 2.23 (hereafter, 2qz clus). 2qz clus was originallyidentified as an overdensity of four optically-selected qsos at z = 2.23 withina 15x15 arcmin^2 region. narrow-band imaging in the near-ir revealed that thestructure contains an additional overdensity of 22 z = 2.23 halpha-emittinggalaxies (haes), resulting in 23 unique z = 2.23 haes/qsos. our chandraobservations reveal that 3 haes in addition to the 4 qsos harbor powerfullyaccreting supermassive black holes (smbhs), with 2-10 kev luminosities of~(8-60) x 10^43 ergs/s and x-ray spectral slopes consistent with unobscuredagn. using a large comparison sample of 210 haes in chandra-cosmos (c-cosmos),we find suggestive evidence that the agn fraction increases with local haegalaxy density. the 2qz clus haes reside in a moderately overdense environment(a factor of ~2 times over the field), and after excluding optically-selectedqsos, we find the agn fraction is a factor of ~3.5^+3.8_-2.2 times higher thanc-cosmos haes in similar environments. using stacking analyses of the chandradata and herschel spire observations at 250 um, we respectively estimate meansmbh accretion rates (mdot) and star-formation rates (sfrs) for the 2qz clusand c-cosmos samples. we find that the mean 2qz clus hae stacked 2-10 kevluminosity is qso-like (~6-10 x 10^43 ergs/s), and the implied mdot/sfr \sim(1.6-3.2) x10^-3 is broadly consistent with the local mbh/m* relation and z ~ 2x-ray selected agn. the c-cosmos haes are on average an order of magnitude lessx-ray luminous and have mdot/sfr \sim (0.2-0.4) x10^-3, comparable to z ~ 1-2star-forming galaxies with similar mean x-ray luminosities. we estimate that aperiodic qso phase with duty cycle ~2-8% would be sufficient to bring thestar-forming galaxies onto the local mbh/m* relation.

1302.4436	herschel-atlas: a binary hylirg pinpointing a cluster of starbursting  proto-ellipticals	panchromatic observations of the best candidate hylirg from the widestherschel extragalactic imaging survey have led to the discovery of at leastfour intrinsically luminous z=2.41 galaxies across a ~100-kpc region - acluster of starbursting proto-ellipticals. via sub-arcsecond interferometricimaging we have measured accurate gas and star-formation surface densities. thetwo brightest galaxies span ~3 kpc fwhm in submm/radio continuum and co j=4-3,and double that in co j=1-0. the broad co line is due partly to the multitudeof constituent galaxies and partly to large rotational velocities in twocounter-rotating gas disks -- a scenario predicted to lead to the most intensestarbursts, which will therefore come in pairs. the disks have m(dyn) ofseveral x 10^11 msun, and gas fractions of ~40%. velocity dispersions aremodest so the disks are unstable, potentially on scales commensurate with theirradii: these galaxies are undergoing extreme bursts of star formation, notconfined to their nuclei, at close to the eddington limit. their specificstar-formation rates place them ~&gt;5x above the main sequence, which supposedlycomprises large gas disks like these. their high star-formation efficienciesare difficult to reconcile with a simple volumetric star-formation law. n-bodyand dark matter simulations suggest this system is the progenitor of ab(inary)-type ~10^14.6-msun cluster.

1302.5315	on the evolution and environmental dependence of the star formation rate  versus stellar mass relation since z~2	this paper discusses the evolution of the correlation between galaxy starformation rates (sfrs) and stellar mass (m*) over the last ~10 gyrs,particularly focusing on its environmental dependence. we first present themid-infrared (mir) properties of the h-alpha-selected galaxies in a richcluster cl0939+4713 at z=0.4. with a mir stacking analysis, we find that themedian sfr of h-alpha emitters is higher in higher-density environment atz=0.4. we also find that star-forming galaxies in high-density environment tendto have higher specific sfr (ssfr), although the trend is much less significantcompared to that of sfr. this increase of ssfr in high-density environment isnot visible when we consider the sfr derived from h-alpha alone, suggestingthat the dust attenuation in galaxies depends on environment; galaxies inhigh-density environment tend to be dustier (by up to ~0.5 mag). we thendiscuss the environmental dependence of the sfr-m* relation for star-forminggalaxies since z~2, by compiling our comparable, narrow-band selected, largeh-alpha emitter samples in both distant cluster environments (frommahalo-subaru) and field environments (from hizels). we find that the ssfr ofh-alpha-selected galaxies (at the fixed mass of log(m*/msun)=10) rapidlyevolves as (1+z)^3, but the sfr-m* relation is independent of the environmentsince z~2, as far as we rely on the h-alpha-based sfrs (with m*-dependentextinction correction). even if we consider the possible environmentalvariation in the dust attenuation, we conclude that the difference in thesfr-m* relation between cluster and field star-forming galaxies is always small(~&lt;0.2dex level) at any time in the history of the universe since z~2.[abridged]

1310.4178	which galaxies dominate the neutral gas content of the universe?	we study the contribution of galaxies with different properties to the globaldensities of star formation rate (sfr), atomic (hi) and molecular hydrogen (h2)as a function of redshift. we use the galform model of galaxy formation, whichis set in the lcdm framework. this model includes a self-consistent calculationof the sfr, which depends on the h2 content of galaxies. the predicted sfrdensity and how much of this is contributed by galaxies with different stellarmasses and infrared luminosities are in agreement with observations. the modelpredicts a modest evolution of the hi density at z&lt;3, which is also inagreement with the observations. the hi density is predicted to be alwaysdominated by galaxies with sfr&lt;1msun/yr. this contrasts with the h2 density,which is predicted to be dominated by galaxies with sfr&gt;10msun/yr. currenthigh-redshift galaxy surveys are limited to detect carbon monoxide in galaxieswith sfr&gt;30msun/yr, which in our model make up, at most, 20% of the h2 in theuniverse. in terms of stellar mass, the predicted h2 density is dominated bymassive galaxies, mstellar&gt;10^10msun, while the hi density is dominated by lowmass galaxies, mstellar&lt;10^9msun. in the context of upcoming neutral gassurveys, we suggest that the faint nature of the galaxies dominating the hicontent of the universe will hamper the identification of optical counterparts,while for h2, we expect follow up observations of molecular emission lines ofalready existing galaxy catalogues to be able to uncover the h2 density of theuniverse.

1310.4501	cold gas dynamics in hydra-a: evidence for a rotating disk	we present multi-frequency observations of the radio galaxy hydra-a (3c218)located in the core of a massive, x-ray luminous galaxy cluster. ifuspectroscopy is used to trace the kinematics of the ionised and warm molecularhydrogen which are consistent with a ~ 5 kpc rotating disc. broad,double-peaked lines of co(2-1), [cii]157 $\mu$m and [oi]63 $\mu$m are detected.we estimate the mass of the cold gas within the disc to be m$_{gas}$ = 2.3$\pm$ 0.3 x 10$^9$ m$_{\odot}$. these observations demonstrate that the complexline profiles found in the cold atomic and molecular gas are related to therotating disc or ring of gas. finally, an hst image of the galaxy shows thatthis gas disc contains a substantial mass of dust. the large gas mass, sfr andkinematics are consistent with the levels of gas cooling from the icm. weconclude that the cold gas originates from the continual quiescent accumulationof cooled icm gas. the rotation is in a plane perpendicular to the projectedorientation of the radio jets and icm cavities hinting at a possible connectionbetween the kpc-scale cooling gas and the accretion of material onto the blackhole. we discuss the implications of these observations for models of coldaccretion, agn feedback and cooling flows.

1310.6364	an alma survey of submillimeter galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: the agn fraction and x-ray properties of submillimeter galaxies	the large gas and dust reservoirs of submm galaxies (smgs) could potentiallyprovide ample fuel to trigger an active galactic nucleus (agn), but previousstudies of the agn fraction in smgs have been controversial largely due to theinhomogeneity and limited angular resolution of the available submillimetersurveys. here we set improved constraints on the agn fraction and x-rayproperties of the smgs with alma and chandra observations in the extendedchandra deep field-south (e-cdf-s). this study is the first among similar worksto have unambiguously identified the x-ray counterparts of smgs; this isaccomplished using the fully submm-identified, statistically reliable smgcatalog with 99 smgs from the alma laboca e-cdf-s submillimeter survey (aless).we found 10 x-ray sources associated with smgs (median redshift z = 2.3), ofwhich 8 were identified as agns using several techniques that enablecross-checking. the other 2 x-ray detected smgs have levels of x-ray emissionthat can be plausibly explained by their star-formation activity. 6 of the 8smg-agns are moderately/highly absorbed, with n_h &gt; 10e23 cm-2. an analysis ofthe agn fraction, taking into account the spatial variation of x-raysensitivity, yields an agn fraction of 17+16-6% for agns with rest-frame 0.5-8kev absorption-corrected luminosity &gt;7.8x10e42 erg s-1; we provide estimatedagn fractions as a function of x-ray flux and luminosity. alma's high angularresolution also enables direct x-ray stacking at the precise positions of smgsfor the first time, and we found 4 potential smg-agns in our stacking sample.

1311.0867	the state of the warm and cold gas in the extreme starburst at the core  of the phoenix galaxy cluster (spt-clj2344-4243)	[abridged] we present new optical integral field spectroscopy (gemini south)and submillimeter spectroscopy (submillimeter array) of the central galaxy inthe phoenix cluster (spt-clj2344-4243). this cluster was previously reported tohave a massive starburst (~800 msun/yr) in the central, brightest clustergalaxy, most likely fueled by the rapidly-cooling intracluster medium. thesenew data reveal a complex emission-line nebula, extending for &gt;30 kpc from thecentral galaxy. the total halpha luminosity, assuming halpha/hbeta = 2.85, isl_ha = 7.6 +/- 0.4 x10^43 erg/s, making this the most luminous emission linenebula detected in the center of a cool core cluster. overall, the relativefluxes of the low-ionization lines (e.g., [o ii], hbeta) to the uv continuumare consistent with photoionization by young stars. in both the center of thegalaxy and in a newly-discovered highly-ionized plume to the north of thegalaxy, the ionization ratios are consistent with both shocks and agnphotoionization. we speculate that this extended plume may be a galactic wind,driven and partially photoionized by both the starburst and central agn. wefind evidence for shocks throughout the ism of the central galaxy, most likelydriven by a combination of stellar winds from massive young stars,core-collapse supernovae, and the central agn. in addition to the warm, ionizedgas, we detect a substantial amount of cold, molecular gas via the co(3-2)transition, coincident in position with the galaxy center. we infer a moleculargas mass of m_h2 = 2.2 +/- 0.6 x10^10 msun, which implies that the starburstwill consume its fuel in ~30 myr if it is not replenished. the combination ofthe high level of turbulence in the warm phase and the high l_ir/m_h2 ratiosuggests that this violent starburst may be in the process of quenching itself.

1311.2604	an alma survey of sub-millimeter galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: sub-millimeter properties of color-selected galaxies	we study the sub-mm properties of color-selected galaxies via a stackinganalysis applied for the first time to interferometric data at sub-mmwavelengths. we base our study on 344 ghz alma continuum observations of~20''-wide fields centered on 86 sub-mm sources detected in the laboca extendedchandra deep field south sub-mm survey (less). we select various classes ofgalaxies (k-selected, star-forming sbzk galaxies, extremely red objects anddistant red galaxies) according to their optical/nir fluxes. we find clear,&gt;10-sigma detections in the stacked images of all these galaxy classes. weinclude in our stacking analysis herschel/spire data to constrain the dust sedof these galaxies. we find that their dust emission is well described by amodified black body with tdust~30 k and beta=1.6 and ir luminosities of(5-11)x10^{11} lsun, or implied star formation rates of 75-140 msun/yr. wecompare our results with those of previous studies based on single-dishobservations at 870 micron and find that our flux densities are a factor 2-3higher than previous estimates. the discrepancy is observed also after removingsources individually detected in aless maps. we report a similar discrepancy byrepeating our analysis on 1.4\,ghz observations of the whole ecdfs. hence wefind tentative evidence that galaxies that are associated in projected andredshift space with sub-mm bright sources are brighter than the averagepopulation. finally, we put our findings in the context of the cosmic starformation rate density as a function of redshift.

1402.6335	a submillimeter galaxy illuminating its circumgalactic medium: ly-alpha  scattering in a cold, clumpy outflow	we report the detection at 850um of the central source in ssa22-lab1, thearchetypal lyman-alpha blob (lab), a 100kpc-scale radio-quiet emission-linenebula at z=3.1. the flux density of the source, $s_{850}=4.6\pm1.1$mjy impliesthe presence of a galaxy, or group of galaxies, with a total luminosity of$l_{\rm ir}\approx10^{12}l_\odot$. the position of an active source at thecenter of a ~50kpc-radius ring of linearly polarized ly-alpha emission detectedby hayes et al. (2011) suggests that the central source is leaking ly-alphaphotons preferentially in the plane of the sky, which undergo scattering in hiclouds at large galactocentric radius. the ly-alpha morphology around thesubmillimeter detection is reminiscent of biconical outflow, and the averagely-alpha line profiles of the two `lobes' are dominated by a red peak, expectedfor a resonant line emerging from a medium with a bulk velocity gradient thatis outflowing relative to the line center. taken together, these observationsprovide compelling evidence that the central active galaxy (or galaxies) isresponsible for a large fraction of the extended ly-alpha emission andmorphology. less clear is the history of the cold gas in the circumgalacticmedium being traced by ly-alpha: is it mainly pristine material accreting intothe halo that has not yet been processed through an interstellar medium (ism),now being blown back as it encounters an outflow, or does it mainly comprisegas that has been swept-up within the ism and expelled from the galaxy?

1403.0247	imaging the environment of a z = 6.3 submillimeter galaxy with scuba-2	we describe a search for submillimeter emission in the vicinity of one of themost distant, luminous galaxies known, hermes fls3 at z=6.34, exploiting it asa signpost to a potentially biased region of the early universe, as might beexpected in hierarchical structure formation models. imaging to the confusionlimit with the innovative, wide-field submillimeter bolometer camera, scuba-2,we are sensitive to colder and/or less luminous galaxies in the surroundings ofhfls3. we use the millennium simulation to illustrate that hfls3 may beexpected to have companions if it is as massive as claimed, but find nosignificant evidence from the surface density of scuba-2 galaxies in itsvicinity, or their colors, that hfls3 marks an over-density of dusty,star-forming galaxies. we cannot rule out the presence of dusty neighbours withconfidence, but deeper 450-um imaging has the potential to more tightlyconstrain the redshifts of nearby galaxies, at least one of which likely liesat z&gt;~5. if associations with hfls3 can be ruled out, this could be taken asevidence that hfls3 is less biased than a simple extrapolation of themillennium simulation may imply. this could suggest either that it represents arare short-lived, but highly luminous, phase in the evolution of an otherwisetypical galaxy, or that this system has suffered amplification due to aforeground gravitational lens and so is not as intrinsically luminous asclaimed.

1403.3086	kiloparsec-scale outflows are prevalent among luminous agn: outflows and  feedback in the context of the overall agn population	we present integral field unit (ifu) observations covering the [oiii]4959,5007 and h-beta emission lines of sixteen z&lt;0.2 type 2 active galacticnuclei (agn). our targets are selected from a well-constrained parent sample of24,000 agn so that we can place our observations into the context of theoverall agn population. our targets are radio-quiet with star formation rates(&lt;~[10-100] msol/yr) that are consistent with normal star-forming galaxies. wedecouple the kinematics of galaxy dynamics and mergers from outflows. we findhigh-velocity ionised gas (velocity widths of 600-1500 km/s and maximumvelocities of &lt;=1700 km/s) with observed spatial extents of &gt;~(6-16) kpc in alltargets and observe signatures of spherical outflows and bi-polar superbubbles.we show that our targets are representative of z&lt;0.2, luminous (i.e., l([oiii]) &gt; 5x10^41 erg/s) type 2 agn and that ionised outflows are not only commonbut also in &gt;=70% (3 sigma confidence) of cases, they are extended overkiloparsec scales. our study demonstrates that galaxy-wide energetic outflowsare not confined to the most extreme star-forming galaxies or radio-luminousagn; however, there may be a higher incidence of the most extreme outflowvelocities in quasars hosted in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies. both starformation and agn activity appear to be energetically viable to drive theoutflows and we find no definitive evidence that favours one process over theother. although highly uncertain, we derive mass outflow rates (typically ~10xthe sfrs), kinetic energies (~0.5-10% of l[agn]) and momentum rates (typically&gt;~10-20x l[agn]/c) consistent with theoretical models that predict agn-drivenoutflows play a significant role in shaping the evolution of galaxies.

0803.0634	weighing the black holes in z~2 submillimeter-emitting galaxies hosting  active galactic nuclei	we place direct observational constraints on the black-hole masses of thecosmologically important z~2 submillimeter-emitting galaxy (smg; f850&gt;4mjy)population, and use measured host-galaxy masses to explore their evolutionarystatus. we employ the well-established virial black-hole mass estimator to'weigh' the black holes of a sample of z~2 smgs with broad halpha or hbetaemission. the average black-hole mass and eddington ratio (eta) of thelower-luminosity broad-line smgs (l_x~10^44 erg/s} are log(m_bh/m_sol)~8.0 andeta~0.2, respectively. these lower-luminosity broad-line smgs lie in the samelocation of the l_x-l_fir plane as more typical smgs hosting x-ray obscured agnand may be intrinsically similar systems, but orientated so that the rest-frameoptical nucleus is visible. under this hypothesis, we conclude that smgs hostblack holes with log(m_bh/m_odot)~7.8; we find supporting evidence fromobservations of local ulirgs. combining these black-hole mass constraints withmeasured host-galaxy masses, we find that the black holes in smgs are &gt;3 timessmaller than those found in comparably massive normal galaxies in the localuniverse, albeit with considerable uncertainty, and &gt;10 times smaller thanthose predicted for z~2 luminous quasars and radio galaxies. these resultsimply that the growth of the black hole lags that of the host galaxy in smgs,in stark contrast with that previously suggested for radio galaxies andluminous quasars at z~2. on the basis of current host-galaxy mass constraints,we show that smgs and their descendants cannot lie significantly above thelocally defined m_bh-m_gal relationship. we argue that the black holes in thez~0 descendents of smgs will have log(m_bh/m_odot)~8.6, indicating that theyonly need to grow by a factor of ~6 by the present day (abridged).

1407.1047	a relationship between specific star formation rate and metallicity  gradient within z=1 galaxies from kmos-hizels	we have observed a sample of typical z=1 star forming galaxies, selected fromthe hizels survey, with the new kmos near-infrared, multi-ifu instrument on thevlt, in order to obtain their dynamics and metallicity gradients. the majorityof our galaxies have a metallicity gradient consistent with being flat ornegative (i.e. higher metallicity cores than outskirts). intriguingly, we finda trend between metallicity gradient and specific star formation rate (ssfr),such that galaxies with a high ssfr tend to have relatively metal-poor centres,a result which is strengthened when combined with datasets from the literature.this result appears to explain the discrepancies reported between differenthigh redshift studies and varying claims for evolution. from a galaxy evolutionperspective, the trend we see would mean that a galaxy's ssfr is governed bythe amount of metal poor gas that can be funnelled into its core, triggeredeither by merging or through efficient accretion. in fact merging may play asignificant role as it is the starburst galaxies at all epochs, which have themore positive metallicity gradients. our results may help to explain the originof the fundamental metallicity relation, in which galaxies at a fixed mass areobserved to have lower metallicities at higher star formation rates, especiallyif the metallicity is measured in an aperture encompassing only the centralregions of the galaxy. finally, we note that this study demonstrates the powerof kmos as an efficient instrument for large scale resolved galaxy surveys.

0705.1721	a detailed study of gas and star formation in a highly magnified lyman  break galaxy at z=3.07	we report the detection of co(3-2) emission from a bright, gravitationallylensed lyman break galaxy, lbgj213512.73-010143 (the 'cosmic eye'), at z=3.07using the plateau de bure interferometer. this is only the second detection ofmolecular gas emission from an lbg and yields an intrinsic molecular gas massof (2.4+/-0.4)x10^9 mo. the lens reconstruction of the uv morphology of the lbgindicates that it comprises two components separated by ~2 kpc. the co emissionis unresolved, and appears to be centered on the intrinsically fainter (andalso less highly magnified) of the two uv components. the width of the co lineindicates a dynamical mass of (8+/-2)x10^9csc(i)^2 mo within the central 2 kpc.employing mid-infrared observations from spitzer we derive a stellar mass of~(6+/-2)x10^9 mo and a star-formation rate of ~60 mo/yr, indicating that themolecular gas will be consumed in ~40 myr. the gas fractions, star-formationefficiencies and line widths suggests that lbgj213512 is a high-redshift,gas-rich analog of a local luminous infrared galaxy. this galaxy has a similargas-to-dynamical mass fraction as observed in the submillimeter-selectedpopulation, although the gas surface density and star-formation efficiency is afactor of 3x less, suggesting less vigorous activity. we discuss theuncertainties in our conclusions arising from adopting a co-to-h2 conversionfactor appropriate for either the milky way or local luminous infraredgalaxies. these observations demonstrate that current facilities, when aided byfortuitous gravitational magnification, can study 'ordinary' galaxies athigh-redshift and so act as pathfinders for alma.

1411.5025	the scuba-2 cosmology legacy survey: alma resolves the rest-frame  far-infrared emission of sub-millimeter galaxies	we present high-resolution (0.3'') alma 870um imaging of 52 sub-millimetergalaxies (smgs) in the ultra deep survey (uds) field and investigate the sizeand morphology of the sub-millimeter (sub-mm) emission on 2-10kpc scales. wederive a median intrinsic angular size of fwhm=0.30$\pm$0.04'' for the 23 smgsin the sample detected at a signal-to-noise ratio (snr) &gt;10. using thephotometric redshifts of the smgs we show that this corresponds to a medianphysical half-light diameter of 2.4$\pm$0.2kpc. a stacking analysis of the smgsdetected at an snr &lt;10 shows they have sizes consistent with the 870um-brightsmgs in the sample. we compare our results to the sizes of smgs derived fromother multi-wavelength studies, and show that the rest-frame ~250um sizes ofsmgs are consistent with studies of resolved 12co (j=3-2 to 7-6) emissionlines, but that sizes derived from 1.4ghz imaging appear to be approximatelytwo times larger on average, which we attribute to cosmic ray diffusion. therest-frame optical sizes of smgs are around four times larger than thesub-millimeter sizes, indicating that the star formation in these galaxies iscompact relative to the pre-existing stellar distribution. the size of thestarburst region in smgs is consistent with the majority of the star formationoccurring in a central region, a few kpc in extent, with a median starformation rate surface density of 90$\pm$30msol/yr/kpc$^2$, which may suggestthat we are witnessing an intense period of bulge growth in these galaxies.

1501.04624	tracing cool molecular gas and star formation on $\sim 100$pc scales  within a $z=2.3$ galaxy	we present new, high-angular resolution interferometric observations with thekarl g. jansky very large array of $^{12}$co $j=1-0$ line emission and 4-8 ghzcontinuum emission in the strongly lensed, $z=2.3$ submillimetre galaxy, smmj21352-0102. using these data, we identify and probe the conditions in $\sim100$pc clumps within this galaxy, which we consider to be potential giantmolecular cloud complexes, containing up to half of the total molecular gas inthis system. in combination with far-infrared and submillimetre data, weinvestigate the far-infrared/radio correlation, measuring $q_{ir} = 2.39 \pm0.17$ across smm j21352. we search for variations in the properties of theinterstellar medium throughout the galaxy by measuring the spatially-resolved$q_{ir}$ and radio spectral index, ${\alpha}_{\rm radio}$, finding ranges$q_{ir} = [2.1, 2.6]$ and ${\alpha}_{\rm radio} = [-1.5, -0.7]$. we argue thatthese ranges in ${\alpha}_{\rm radio}$ and $q_{ir}$ may reflect variations inthe age of the ism material. using multi-$j$ $^{12}$co data, we quantitativelytest a recent theoretical model relating the star-formation rate surfacedensity to the excitation of $^{12}$co, finding good agreement between themodel and the data. lastly, we study the schmidt-kennicutt relation, bothintegrated across the system and within the individual clumps. we find smalloffsets between smm j21352 and its clumps relative to other star-forming galaxypopulations on the schmidt-kennicutt plot - such offsets have previously beeninterpreted as evidence for a bi-modal star-formation law, but we argue thatthey can be equally-well explained as arising due to a combination ofobservational uncertainties and systematic biases in the choice of model usedto interpret the data.

1502.07756	a remarkably flat relationship between the average star formation rate  and agn luminosity for distant x-ray agn	in this study we investigate the relationship between the star formationrate, sfr, and agn luminosity, l(agn), for ~2000 x-ray detected agn. the agnspan over three orders of magnitude in x-ray luminosity (10^(42) &lt; l(2-8kev) &lt;10^(45.5) erg/s) and are in the redshift range z = 0.2 - 2.5. using infrared(ir) photometry (8 - 500um), including deblended spitzer and herschel imagesand taking into account photometric upper limits, we decompose the ir spectralenergy distributions into agn and star formation components. using the irluminosities due to star formation, we investigate the average sfrs as afunction of redshift and agn luminosity. in agreement with previous studies, wefind a strong evolution of the average sfr with redshift, tracking the observedevolution of the overall star forming galaxy population. however, we find thatthe relationship between the average sfr and agn luminosity is flat at allredshifts and across all the agn luminosities investigated; in comparison toprevious studies, we find less scatter amongst the average sfrs across the widerange of agn luminosities investigated. by comparing to empirical models, weargue that the observed flat relationship is due to short timescale variationsin agn luminosity, driven by changes in the mass accretion rate, which wash outany underlying correlations between sfr and l(agn). furthermore, we show thatthe exact form of the predicted relationship between sfr and agn luminosity(and it's normalisation) is highly sensitive to the assumed intrinsic eddingtonratio distribution.

1503.08720	revealing the complex nature of the strong gravitationally lensed system  h-atlas j090311.6+003906 using alma	we have modelled atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array (alma) longbaseline imaging of the strong gravitational lens system h-atlasj090311.6+003906 (sdp.81). we have reconstructed the distribution of band 6 and7 continuum emission in the z=3.042 source and we have determined its kinematicproperties by reconstructing co(5-4) and co(8-7) line emission in bands 4 and6. the continuum imaging reveals a highly non-uniform distribution of dust withclumps on scales of 200 pc. in contrast, the co line emission shows arelatively smooth, disk-like velocity field which is well fit by a rotatingdisk model with an inclination angle of 40+/-5 degrees and an asymptoticrotation velocity of 320 km/s. the inferred dynamical mass within 1.5kpc is(3.5+/-0.5)x10^{10} m_sol which is comparable to the total molecular gas massesof (2.7+/-0.5)x10^{10} m_sol and (3.5+/-0.6)x10^{10} m_sol from the dustcontinuum emission and co emission respectively. our new reconstruction of thelensed hst near-infrared emission shows two objects which appear to beinteracting, with the rotating disk of gas and dust revealed by alma distinctlyoffset from the near-infrared emission. the clumpy nature of the dust and a lowvalue of the toomre parameter of q=0.3 suggest that the disk is in a state ofcollapse. we estimate a star formation rate in the disk of 470+/-80 m_sol/yrwith an efficiency 65 times greater than typical low-redshift galaxies. ourfindings add to the growing body of evidence that the most infra-red luminous,dust obscured galaxies in the high redshift universe represent a population ofmerger induced starbursts.

astro-ph;0509898	a robust sample of submillimetre galaxies: constraints on the prevalence  of dusty, high-redshift starbursts	the modest significance of most sources detected in current submm surveys canpotentially compromise some analyses due to the inclusion of spurious sourcesin catalogues typically selected at &gt;3.0-3.5sigma. here, we develop and apply adual-survey extraction technique to scuba and mambo images of the lockman hole.cut above 5sigma, our catalogue of smgs is more robust than previous samples,with a reduced likelihood of real, but faint smgs (beneath and around theconfusion limit) entering via superposition with noise. the effective fluxlimit of the survey is well matched to our deep 1.4-ghz image. the former issensitive to luminous, dusty galaxies at extreme redshifts whilst the latterprobes the z&lt;3 regime. a high fraction of our robust smgs (~80%) have radiocounterparts which, given the ~10% contamination by spurious sources, suggeststhat very distant smgs (z&gt;&gt;3) are unlikely to make up more than ~10% of thebright smg population. this implies that almost all of the bright smgpopulation is amenable to study via the deepest current radio imaging. we usethese radio counterparts to provide an empirical calibration of the positionaluncertainty in smg catalogues. we then go on to outline the acquisition ofredshifts for radio-identified smgs, from sample selection in the submm, tocounterpart selection in the radio and optical/ir, to slit placement onspectrograph masks. we determine a median of z=2.05 +/- 0.41 from a sample ofsix secure redshifts for unambigious radio-identified submm sources and z=2.14+/- 0.27 when we include submm sources with multiple radio counterparts and/orless reliable redshifts. these figures are consistent with previous estimates,suggesting that our knowledge of the median redshift of bright smgs populationhas not been biased by the low significance of the source catalogues employed.

astro-ph;0611486	a very bright, highly magnified lyman-break galaxy at z=3.07	we report the discovery using hubble space telescope imaging and keckspectroscopy of a very bright, highly magnified (~30*) lyman break galaxy (lbg)at z=3.07 in the field of the massive z=0.33 cluster macsj2135.2-0102. thesystem comprises two high-surface brightness arcs with a maximum extent of 3",bracketing a central object which we identify as a massive early-type galaxy atz=0.73. we construct a lens model which reproduces the main features of thesystem using a combination of a galaxy-scale lens and the foreground cluster.we show that the morphological, spectral and photometric properties of the arcsare consistent with them arising from the lensing of a single ~l* lbg. the mostimportant feature of this system is that the lensing magnification results inan apparent magnitude of r=20.3, making this one of the brightest lbgs known.such a high magnification provides the opportunity of obtaining very highsignal to noise (and potentially spatially resolved) spectroscopy of a highredshift galaxy to study its physical properties. we present initial imagingand spectroscopy demonstrating the basic properties of the system and discussthe opportunities for future observations.

astro-ph;0701221	resolved spectroscopy of a gravitationally lensed l* lyman-break galaxy  at z~5	by combining hst imaging with optical (vimos) and near-infrared (sinfoni)integral field spectroscopy we exploit the gravitational potential of amassive, rich cluster at z=0.9 to study the internal properties of agravitationally lensed galaxy at z=4.88. using a detailed gravitational lensmodel of the cluster rcs0224-002 we reconstruct the source-frame morphology ofthe lensed galaxy on 200pc scales and find an ~l* lyman-break galaxy with anintrinsic size of only 2.0x0.8kpc, a velocity gradient of &lt;60km/s and animplied dynamical mass of 1.0x10^10mo within 2kpc. we infer an integratedstar-formation rate of just 12+/-2mo/yr from the intrinsic [oii] emission lineflux. the ly-alpha emission appears redshifted by +200+/-40km/s with respect tothe [oii] emission. the ly-alpha is also significantly more extended than thenebular emission, extending over 11.9x2.4kpc. over this area, the ly-alphacentroid varies by less than 10km/s. by examining the spatially resolvedstructure of the [oii] and asymmetric ly-alpha emission lines we investigatethe nature of this system. the model for local starburst galaxies suggested bymass-hesse et al. (2003) provides a good description of our data, and suggeststhat the galaxy is surrounded by a galactic-scale bi-polar outflow which hasrecently burst out of the system. the outflow, which appears to be currentlylocated &gt;30kpc from the galaxy, is escaping at a speed of upto ~500km/s.although the mass of the outflow is uncertain, the geometry and velocity of theoutflow suggests that the ejected material is travelling far faster than escapevelocity and will travel more than 1mpc (comoving) before eventually stalling.
