0911.0703	a new concept for the combination of optical interferometers and  high-resolution spectrographs	the combination of high spatial and spectral resolution in optical astronomyenables new observational approaches to many open problems in stellar andcircumstellar astrophysics. however, constructing a high-resolutionspectrograph for an interferometer is a costly and time-intensive undertaking.our aim is to show that, by coupling existing high-resolution spectrographs toexisting interferometers, one could observe in the domain of high spectral andspatial resolution, and avoid the construction of a new complex and expensiveinstrument. we investigate in this article the different challenges which arisefrom combining an interferometer with a high-resolution spectrograph. therequirements for the different sub-systems are determined, with specialattention given to the problems of fringe tracking and dispersion. a conceptstudy for the combination of the vlti (very large telescope interferometer)with uves (uv-visual echelle spectrograph) is carried out, and several otherspecific instrument pairings are discussed. we show that the proposedcombination of an interferometer with a high-resolution spectrograph is indeedfeasible with current technology, for a fraction of the cost of building awhole new spectrograph. the impact on the existing instruments and theirongoing programs would be minimal.

1004.2089	multi-wavelength observations of h 2356-309	aims: the properties of the broad-band emission from the high-frequencypeaked bl lac h 2356-309 (z=0.165) are investigated. methods: very high energy(vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) observations of h 2356-309 were performed with the highenergy stereoscopic system (hess) from 2004 through 2007. simultaneousoptical/uv and x-ray observations were made with the xmm-newton satellite onjune 12/13 and june 14/15, 2005. nrt radio observations were alsocontemporaneously performed in 2005. atom optical monitoring observations werealso made in 2007. results: a strong vhe signal, ~13 sigma total, was detectedby hess after the four years hess observations (116.8 hrs live time). theintegral flux above 240 gev is i(&gt;240 gev) = (3.06 +- 0.26 {stat} +- 0.61{syst}) x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, corresponding to ~1.6% of the flux observedfrom the crab nebula. a time-averaged energy spectrum is measured from 200 gevto 2 tev and is characterized by a power law (photon index of gamma = 3.06 +-0.15 {stat} +- 0.10 {syst}). significant small-amplitude variations in the vheflux from h 2356-309 are seen on time scales of months and years, but not onshorter time scales. no evidence for any variations in the vhe spectral slopeare found within these data. the xmm-newton x-ray measurements show ahistorically low x-ray state, characterized by a hard, broken-power-lawspectrum on both nights. conclusions: the broad-band spectral energydistribution (sed) of the blazar can be adequately fit using a simple one-zonesynchrotron self-compton (ssc) model. in the ssc scenario, higher vhe fluxescould be expected in the future since the observed x-ray flux is at ahistorically low level.

1004.2124	first detection of vhe gamma-rays from sn 1006 by h.e.s.s	recent theoretical predictions of the lowest very high energy (vhe)luminosity of sn 1006 are only a factor 5 below the previously publishedh.e.s.s. upper limit, thus motivating further in-depth observations of thissource. deep observations at vhe energies (above 100 gev) were carried out withthe high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) of cherenkov telescopes from2003 to 2008. more than 100 hours of data have been collected and subjected toan improved analysis procedure. observations resulted in the detection of vhegamma-rays from sn 1006. the measured gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with apower-law, the flux is of the order of 1% of that detected from the crabnebula, and is thus consistent with the previously established h.e.s.s. upperlimit. the source exhibits a bipolar morphology, which is strongly correlatedwith non-thermal x-rays. because the thickness of the vhe-shell is compatiblewith emission from a thin rim, particle acceleration in shock waves is likelyto be the origin of the gamma-ray signal. the measured flux level can beaccounted for by inverse compton emission, but a mixed scenario that includesleptonic and hadronic components and takes into account the ambient matterdensity inferred from observations also leads to a satisfactory description ofthe multi-wavelength spectrum.

1006.5289	discovery of vhe gamma-rays from the bl lac object pks 0548-322	pks 0548-322 (z=0.069) is a ``high-frequency-peaked'' bl lac object and acandidate very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100 gev) gamma-ray emitter, due to its highx-ray and radio flux. observations at the vhe band provide insights into theorigin of very energetic particles present in this source and the radiationprocesses at work. we report observations made between october 2004 and january2008 with the h.e.s.s. array, a four imaging atmospheric-cherenkov telescopes.contemporaneous uv and x-ray observations with the swift satellite in november2006 are also reported. pks 0548-322 is detected for the first time in the vheband with h.e.s.s. we measure an excess of 216 gamma-rays corresponding to asignificance of 5.6 standard deviations. the photon spectrum of the source isdescribed by a power-law, with a photon index of gamma=2.86 +/- 0.34 (stat) +/-0.10 (sys). the integral flux above 200 gev is 1.3 % of the flux of the crabnebula, and is consistent with being constant in time. contemporaneousswift/xrt observations reveal an x-ray flux between 2 and 10 kev of f_{2-10kev}=2.3 +/- 0.2 x 10^{-11} erg.cm^{-2}. s^{-1}, an intermediate intensitystate with respect to previous observations. the spectral energy distributioncan be reproduced using a simple one-zone synchrotron self compton model, withparameters similar those observed for other sources of this type.

1009.1145	black hole mass estimates based on civ are consistent with those based  on the balmer lines	using a sample of high-redshift lensed quasars from the castles project withobserved-frame ultraviolet or optical and near-infrared spectra, we havesearched for possible biases between supermassive black hole (bh) massestimates based on the civ, halpha and hbeta broad emission lines. our sampleis based upon that of greene, peng &amp; ludwig, expanded with new near-irspectroscopic observations, consistently analyzed high s/n optical spectra, andconsistent continuum luminosity estimates at 5100a. we find that bh massestimates based on the fwhm of civ show a systematic offset with respect tothose obtained from the line dispersion, sigma_l, of the same emission line,but not with those obtained from the fwhm of halpha and hbeta. the magnitude ofthe offset depends on the treatment of the heii and feii emission blended withciv, but there is little scatter for any fixed measurement prescription. whilewe otherwise find no systematic offsets between civ and balmer line massestimates, we do find that the residuals between them are strongly correlatedwith the ratio of the uv and optical continuum luminosities. removing thisdependency reduces the scatter between the uv- and optical-based bh massestimates by a factor of approximately 2, from roughly 0.35 to 0.18 dex. thedispersion is smallest when comparing the civ sigma_l mass estimate, afterremoving the offset from the fwhm estimates, and either balmer line massestimate. the correlation with the continuum slope is likely due to acombination of reddening, host contamination and object-dependent sed shapes.when we add additional heterogeneous measurements from the literature, theresults are unchanged.

1101.3221	infrared narrow-band tomography of the local starburst ngc 1569 with  lbt/lucifer	we used the near-ir imager/spectrograph lucifer mounted on the largebinocular telescope (lbt) to image, with sub-arcsec seeing, the local dwarfstarburst ngc 1569 in the jhk bands and hei 1.08 micron, [feii] 1.64 micron andbrgamma narrow-band filters. we obtained high-quality spatial maps of hei,[feii] and brgamma emission across the galaxy, and used them together withhst/acs images of ngc 1569 in the halpha filter to derive the two-dimensionalspatial map of the dust extinction and surface star formation rate density. weshow that dust extinction is rather patchy and, on average, higher in thenorth-west (nw) portion of the galaxy [e_g(b-v) = 0.71 mag] than in thesouth-east [e_g(b-v) = 0.57 mag]. similarly, the surface density of starformation rate peaks in the nw region of ngc 1569, reaching a value of about 4x 10^-6 m_sun yr^-1 pc^-2. the total star formation rate as estimated from theintegrated, dereddened halpha luminosity is about 0.4 m_sun yr^-1, and thetotal supernova rate from the integrated, dereddened [feii] luminosity is about0.005 yr^-1 (assuming a distance of 3.36 mpc). the azimuthally averaged[feii]/brgamma flux ratio is larger at the edges of the central, gas-deficientcavities (encompassing the super star clusters a and b) and in the galaxyoutskirts. if we interpret this line ratio as the ratio between the averagepast star formation (as traced by supernovae) and on-going activity(represented by ob stars able to ionize the interstellar medium), it would thenindicate that star formation has been quenched within the central cavities andlately triggered in a ring around them. the number of ionizing hydrogen andhelium photons as computed from the integrated, dereddened halpha and heiluminosities suggests that the latest burst of star formation occurred about 4myr ago and produced new stars with a total mass of ~1.8 x 10^6 m_sun.[abridged]

1106.4069	very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from the direction of the galactic  globular cluster terzan 5	the h.e.s.s. very-high-energy (vhe, e &gt; 0.1 tev) gamma-ray telescope systemhas discovered a new source, hess j1747-248. the measured integral flux is (1.2+/- 0.3) \times 10^-12 cm-2 s-1 above 440 gev for a power-law photon spectralindex of 2.5 +/- 0.3 stat +/- 0.2 sys. the vhe gamma-ray source is located inthe close vicinity of the galactic globular cluster terzan 5 and extends beyondthe h.e.s.s. point spread function (0.07 degree). the probability of a chancecoincidence with terzan 5 and an unrelated vhe source is quite low (~ 10^-4).with the largest population of identified millisecond pulsars (mspsrs), a veryhigh core stellar density and the brightest gev range flux as measured byfermi-lat, terzan 5 stands out among galactic globular clusters. the propertiesof the vhe source are briefly discussed in the context of potential emissionmechanisms, notably in relation to mspsrs. interpretation of the available dataaccommodates several possible origins for this vhe gamma-ray source, althoughnone of them offers a satisfying explanation of its peculiar morphology.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1204.5690	h.e.s.s. observations of the carina nebula and its enigmatic colliding  wind binary eta carinae	the massive binary system eta carinae and the surrounding hii complex, thecarina nebula, are potential particle acceleration sites from whichvery-high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission could be expected. thispaper presents data collected during vhe \gamma-ray observations with theh.e.s.s. telescope array from 2004 to 2010, which cover a full orbit of etacarinae. in the 33.1-hour data set no hint of significant \gamma-ray emissionfrom eta carinae has been found and an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of7.7 x 10-13 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level) is derived above the energythreshold of 470 gev. together with the detection of high-energy (he; 0.1 gev &gt;e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission by the fermi-lat up to 100 gev, and assuming acontinuation of the average he spectral index into the vhe domain, theseresults imply a cut-off in the \gamma-ray spectrum between the he and vhe\gamma-ray range. this could be caused either by a cut-off in the acceleratedparticle distribution or by severe \gamma-\gamma\ absorption losses in the windcollision region. furthermore, the search for extended \gamma-ray emission fromthe carina nebula resulted in an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of 4.2 x10-12 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level). the derived upper limit of ~23 on thecosmic-ray enhancement factor is compared with results found for the old-agemixed-morphology supernova remnant w 28.

1205.5485	spectral analysis and interpretation of the \gamma-ray emission from the  starburst galaxy ngc 253	very-high-energy (vhe; e &gt;100 gev) and high-energy (he; 100 mev &lt; e &lt; 100gev) data from \gamma-ray observations performed with the h.e.s.s. telescopearray and the fermi-lat instrument, respectively, are analysed in order toinvestigate the non-thermal processes in the starburst galaxy ngc 253. the vhe\gamma-ray data can be described by a power law in energy with differentialphoton index \gamma=2.14 \pm 0.18_stat \pm 0.30_sys and differential fluxnormalisation at 1 tev of f_0 = (9.6 \pm 1.5_stat (+5.7,-2.9)_sys) x 10^{-14}tev^{-1} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. a power-law fit to the differential he \gamma-rayspectrum reveals a photon index of \gamma=2.24 \pm 0.14_stat \pm 0.03_sys andan integral flux between 200 mev and 200 gev of f(0.2-200 gev) = (4.9 \pm1.0_stat \pm 0.3_sys) x 10^{-9} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. no evidence for a spectralbreak or turnover is found over the dynamic range of both the lat instrumentand the h.e.s.s. experiment: a combined fit of a power law to the he and vhe\gamma-ray data results in a differential photon index \gamma=2.34 \pm 0.03with a p-value of 30%. the \gamma-ray observations indicate that at least about20% of the energy of the cosmic rays capable of producing hadronic interactionsis channeled into pion production. the smooth alignment between the spectra inthe he and vhe \gamma-ray domain suggests that the same transport processesdominate in the entire energy range. advection is most likely responsible forcharged particle removal from the starburst nucleus from gev to multiple tevenergies. in a hadronic scenario for the \gamma-ray production, the singleoverall power-law spectrum observed would therefore correspond to the meanenergy spectrum produced by the ensemble of cosmic-ray sources in the starburstregion.

1208.1370	constraints on the gamma-ray emission from the cluster-scale agn  outburst in the hydra a galaxy cluster	in some galaxy clusters powerful agn have blown bubbles with cluster scaleextent into the ambient medium. the main pressure support of these bubbles isnot known to date, but cosmic rays are a viable possibility. for such ascenario copious gamma-ray emission is expected as a tracer of cosmic rays fromthese systems. hydra a, the closest galaxy cluster hosting a cluster scale agnoutburst, located at a redshift of 0.0538, is investigated for being agamma-ray emitter with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) array andthe fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat). data obtained in 20.2 hours ofdedicated h.e.s.s. observations and 38 months of fermi-lat data, gathered byits usual all-sky scanning mode, have been analyzed to search for a gamma-raysignal. no signal has been found in either data set. upper limits on thegamma-ray flux are derived and are compared to models. these are the firstlimits on gamma-ray emission ever presented for galaxy clusters hosting clusterscale agn outbursts. the non-detection of hydra a in gamma-rays has importantimplications on the particle populations and physical conditions inside thebubbles in this system. for the case of bubbles mainly supported by hadroniccosmic rays, the most favorable scenario, that involves full mixing betweencosmic rays and embedding medium, can be excluded. however, hadronic cosmicrays still remain a viable pressure support agent to sustain the bubblesagainst the thermal pressure of the ambient medium. the largest population ofhighly-energetic electrons which are relevant for inverse-compton gamma-rayproduction is found in the youngest inner lobes of hydra a. the limit on theinverse-compton gamma-ray flux excludes a magnetic field below half of theequipartition value of 16 mug in the inner lobes.

1210.1359	probing the extent of the non-thermal emission from the vela x region at  tev energies with h.e.s.s	vela x is a region of extended radio emission in the western part of the velaconstellation: one of the nearest pulsar wind nebulae (pwne), and associatedwith the energetic vela pulsar (psr b0833-45). extended very-high-energy (vhe)$\gamma$-ray emission (hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen 455}$) was discovered usingthe h.e.s.s. experiment in 2004. the vhe $\gamma$-ray emission was found to becoincident with a region of x-ray emission discovered with ${\it rosat}$ above1.5 kev (the so-called \textit{vela x cocoon}): a filamentary structureextending southwest from the pulsar to the centre of vela x. a deeperobservation of the entire vela x nebula region, also including larger offsetsfrom the cocoon, has been performed with h.e.s.s. this re-observation wascarried out in order to probe the extent of the non-thermal emission from thevela x region at tev energies and to investigate its spectral properties. inorder to increase the sensitivity to the faint $\gamma$-ray emission from thevery extended vela x region, a multivariate analysis method combining threecomplementary reconstruction techniques of cherenkov-shower images is appliedfor the selection of $\gamma$-ray events. the analysis is performed with theon/off background method, which estimates the background from separateobservations pointing away from vela x; towards regions free of $\gamma$-raysources but with comparable observation conditions. the $\gamma$-ray surfacebrightness over the large vela x region reveals that the detection ofnon-thermal vhe $\gamma$-ray emission from the pwn hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen455}$ is statistically significant over a region of radius 1.2$^{\circ}$ aroundthe position $\alpha$ = 08$^{\mathrm{h}}$ 35$^{\mathrm{m}}$ 00$^{\mathrm{s}}$,$\delta$ = -45$^{\circ}$ 36$^{\mathrm{\prime}}$00$^{\mathrm{\prime}\mathrm{\prime}}$ (j2000).

1212.2227	the espri project: astrometric exoplanet search with prima i. instrument  description and performance of first light observations	the espri project relies on the astrometric capabilities offered by the primafacility of the very large telescope interferometer for the discovery and studyof planetary systems. our survey consists of obtaining high-precisionastrometry for a large sample of stars over several years and to detect theirbarycentric motions due to orbiting planets. we present the operationprinciple, the instrument's implementation, and the results of a first seriesof test observations. a comprehensive overview of the instrument infrastructureis given and the observation strategy for dual-field relative astrometry ispresented. the differential delay lines, a key component of the prima facilitywhich was delivered by the espri consortium, are described and theirperformance within the facility is discussed. observations of bright visualbinaries are used to test the observation procedures and to establish theinstrument's astrometric precision and accuracy. the data reduction strategyfor astrometry and the necessary corrections to the raw data are presented.adaptive optics observations with naco are used as an independent verificationof prima astrometric observations. the prima facility was used to carry outtests of astrometric observations. the astrometric performance in terms ofprecision is limited by the atmospheric turbulence at a level close to thetheoretical expectations and a precision of 30 micro-arcseconds was achieved.in contrast, the astrometric accuracy is insufficient for the goals of theespri project and is currently limited by systematic errors that originate inthe part of the interferometer beamtrain which is not monitored by the internalmetrology system. our observations led to the definition of corrective actionsrequired to make the facility ready for carrying out the espri search forextrasolar planets.

1212.3409	measurement of the extragalactic background light imprint on the spectra  of the brightest blazars observed with h.e.s.s	the extragalactic background light (ebl) is the diffuse radiation with thesecond highest energy density in the universe after the cosmic microwavebackground. the aim of this study is the measurement of the imprint of the eblopacity to gamma-rays on the spectra of the brightest extragalactic sourcesdetected with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.). the originalityof the method lies in the joint fit of the ebl optical depth and of theintrinsic spectra of the sources, assuming intrinsic smoothness. analysis of atotal of ~10^5 gamma-ray events enables the detection of an ebl signature atthe 8.8 std dev level and constitutes the first measurement of the ebl opticaldepth using very-high energy (e&gt;100 gev) gamma-rays. the ebl flux density isconstrained over almost two decades of wavelengths (0.30-17 microns) and thepeak value at 1.4 micron is derived as 15 +/- 2 (stat) +/- 3 (sys) nw / m^2 sr.

1301.1678	search for very-high-energy \gamma-ray emission from galactic globular  clusters with h.e.s.s	globular clusters (gcs) are established emitters of high-energy (he, 100mev&lt;e&lt;100 gev) \gamma-ray radiation which could originate from the cumulativeemission of the numerous millisecond pulsars (mspsrs) in the clusters' cores orfrom inverse compton (ic) scattering of relativistic leptons accelerated in thegc environment. these stellar clusters could also constitute a new class ofsources in the very-high-energy (vhe, e&gt;100 gev) \gamma-ray regime, judgingfrom the recent detection of a signal from the direction of terzan 5 with theh.e.s.s. telescope array.  we searched for point-like and extended vhe \gamma-ray emission from 15 gcsserendipitously covered by h.e.s.s observations and also performed a stackinganalysis combining the data from all gcs to investigate the hypothesis of apopulation of faint emitters. assuming ic emission as the origin of the vhe\gamma-ray signal from the direction of terzan 5, we calculated the expected\gamma-ray flux from each of the 15 gcs, based on their number of millisecondpulsars, their optical brightness and the energy density of background photonfields.  we did not detect significant vhe \gamma-ray emission from any of the 15 gcsin either of the two analyses. given the uncertainties related to the parameterdeterminations, the obtained flux upper limits allow to rule out the simpleic/mspsr scaling model for ngc 6388 and ngc 7078. the upper limits derived fromthe stacking analyses are factors between 2 and 50 below the flux predicted bythe simple leptonic scaling model, depending on the assumed source extent andthe dominant target photon fields. therefore, terzan 5 still remainsexceptional among all gcs, as the vhe \gamma-ray emission either arises fromextra-ordinarily efficient leptonic processes, or from a recent catastrophicevent, or is even unrelated to the gc itself.

1304.2158	the mass-metallicity relation explored with califa: i. is there a  dependence on the star formation rate?	we present the results on the study of the global and local m-z relationbased on the first data available from the califa survey (150 galaxies). thissurvey provides integral field spectroscopy of the complete optical extent ofeach galaxy (up to 2-3 effective radii), with enough resolution to separateindividual hii regions and/or aggregations. nearly $\sim$3000 individual hiiregions have been detected. the spectra cover the wavelength range between[oii]3727 and [sii]6731, with a sufficient signal-to-noise to derive the oxygenabundance and star-formation rate associated with each region. in addition, wehave computed the integrated and spatially resolved stellar masses (and surfacedensities), based on sdss photometric data. we explore the relations betweenthe stellar mass, oxygen abundance and star-formation rate using this dataset.  we derive a tight relation between the integrated stellar mass and thegas-phase abundance, with a dispersion smaller than the one already reported inthe literature ($\sigma_{\delta{\rm log(o/h)}}=$0.07 dex). indeed, thisdispersion is only slightly larger than the typical error derived for ouroxygen abundances. however, we do not find any secondary relation with thestar-formation rate, other than the one induced due to the primary relation ofthis quantity with the stellar mass. we confirm the result using the $\sim$3000individual hii regions, for the corresponding local relations.  our results agree with the scenario in which gas recycling in galaxies, bothlocally and globally, is much faster than other typical timescales, like thatof gas accretion by inflow and/or metal loss due to outflows. in essence,late-type/disk dominated galaxies seem to be in a quasi-steady situation, witha behavior similar to the one expected from an instantaneousrecycling/closed-box model.

0801.0741	precise radial velocities of giant stars. iv. a correlation between  surface gravity and radial velocity variation and a statistical investigation  of companion properties	since 1999, we have been conducting a radial velocity survey of 179 k giantsusing the cat at uco/lick observatory. at present ~20-100 measurements havebeen collected per star with a precision of 5 to 8 m/s. of the stars monitored,145 (80%) show radial velocity (rv) variations at a level &gt;20 m/s, of which 43exhibit significant periodicities. our aim is to investigate possiblemechanism(s) that cause these observed rv variations. we intend to test whetherthese variations are intrinsic in nature, or possibly induced by companions, orboth. in addition, we aim to characterise the parameters of these companions. arelation between log g and the amplitude of the rv variations is investigatedfor all stars in the sample. furthermore, the hypothesis that all periodic rvvariations are caused by companions is investigated by comparing their inferredorbital statistics with the statistics of companions around main sequencestars. a strong relation is found between the amplitude of the rv variationsand log g in k giant stars, as suggested earlier by hatzes &amp; cochran (1998).however, most of the stars exhibiting periodic variations are located abovethis relation. these rv variations can be split in a periodic component whichis not correlated with log g and a random residual part which does correlatewith log g. compared to main-sequence stars, k giants frequently exhibitperiodic rv variations. interpreting these rv variations as being caused bycompanions, the orbital param eters are different from the companions orbitingdwarfs. intrinsic mechanisms play an important role in producing rv variationsin k giants stars, as suggested by their dependence on log g. however, itappears that periodic rv variations are additional to these intrinsicvariations, consistent with them being caused by companions.

1404.1613	tev {\gamma}-ray observations of the young synchrotron-dominated snrs  g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 with h.e.s.s	the non-thermal nature of the x-ray emission from the shell-type supernovaremnants (snrs) g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 is an indication of intense particleacceleration in the shock fronts of both objects. this suggests that the snrsare prime candidates for very-high-energy (vhe; e $&gt;$ 0.1 tev) {\gamma}-rayobservations. g1.9+0.3, recently established as the youngest known snr in thegalaxy, also offers a unique opportunity to study the earliest stages of snrevolution in the vhe domain. the purpose of this work is to probe the level ofvhe {\gamma}-ray emission from both snrs and use this to constrain theirphysical properties. observations were conducted with the h.e.s.s. (high energystereoscopic system) cherenkov telescope array over a more than six-year periodspanning 2004-2010. the obtained data have effective livetimes of 67 h forg1.9+0.3 and 16 h for g330.2+1.0. the data are analyzed in the context of themulti-wavelength observations currently available and in the framework of bothleptonic and hadronic particle acceleration scenarios. no significant{\gamma}-ray signal from g1.9+0.3 or g330.2+1.0 was detected. upper limits (99%confidence level) to the tev flux from g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 for the assumedspectral index {\gamma} = 2.5 were set at 5.6 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above 0.26 tev and 3.2 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ above0.38 tev, respectively. in a one-zone leptonic scenario, these upper limitsimply lower limits on the interior magnetic field to b$_{\mathrm{g1.9}}$$\gtrsim$ 11 {\mu}g for g1.9+0.3 and to b$_{\mathrm{g330}}$ $\gtrsim$ 8 {\mu}gfor g330.2+1.0. in a hadronic scenario, the low ambient densities and the largedistances to the snrs result in very low predicted fluxes, for which theh.e.s.s. upper limits are not constraining.

1404.7384	vlti/amber observations of cold giant stars: atmospheric structures and  fundamental parameters	the main goal of this research is to determine the angular size and theatmospheric structures of cool giant stars and to compare them with hydrostaticstellar model atmospheres, to estimate the fundamental parameters, and toobtain a better understanding of the circumstellar environment.  we conducted spectro-interferometric observations of epsilon oct, beta peg,nu pav, and psi peg in the near-infrared k band (2.13-2.47 microm), and gammahya (1.9-2.47 microm) with the vlti/amber instrument at medium spectralresolution. to obtain the fundamental parameters, we compared our data withhydrostatic atmosphere models (phoenix).  we estimated the rosseland angular diameters of epsilon oct, beta peg, nupav, psi peg, and gamma hya. together with distances and bolometric fluxes, weestimated radii, effective temperatures, and luminosities of our targets. inthe beta peg visibility, we observed a molecular layer of co with a sizesimilar to that modeled with phoenix. however, there is an additional slope inabsorption starting around 2.3 microm. this slope is possibly due to a shell ofwater that is not modeled with phoenix. the visibility of psi peg shows a lowincrease in the co bands, compatible with the modeling of the phoenix model.the visibility data of the other sources show no increase in molecular bands.  the spectra and visibilities predicted by the phoenix atmospheres agree withthe spectra and the visibilities observed in our stars (except for beta peg).this indicates that the opacity of the molecular bands is adequately includedin the model, and the atmospheres of our targets have an extension similar tothe modeled atmospheres. the atmosphere of beta peg is more extended than thatpredicted by the model. the targets are located close to the red limits of theevolutionary tracks of the starevol model.

1407.0470	improving the astrometric performance of vlti-prima	in the summer of 2011, the first on-sky astrometric commissioning ofprima-astrometry delivered a performance of 3 m'' for a 10 '' separation onbright objects, orders of magnitude away from its exoplanet requirement of 50{\mu}'' ~ 20 {\mu}'' on objects as faint as 11 mag ~ 13 mag in k band. thiscontribution focuses on upgrades and characterizations carried out since then.  the astrometric metrology was extended from the coud\'e focus of theauxillary telescopes to their secondary mirror, in order to reduce the baselineinstabilities and improve the astrometric performance. while carrying out thisextension, it was realized that the polarization retardance of the starseparator derotator had a major impact on both the astrometric metrology andthe fringe sensors. a local compensation of this retardance and the operationon a symmetric baseline allowed a new astrometric commissioning. in october2013, an improved astrometric performance of 160 {\mu}'' was demonstrated,still short of the requirements. instabilities in the astrometric baselinestill appear to be the dominating factor.  in preparation to a review held in january 2014, a plan was developed tofurther improve the astrometric and faint target performance of primaastrometry. on the astrometric aspect, it involved the extension of theinternal longitudinal metrology to primary space, the design and implementationof an external baseline metrology, and the development of an astrometricinternal fringes mode. on the faint target aspect, investigations of theperformance of the fringe sensor units and the development of an ao system(naomi) were in the plan. following this review, eso decided to take a proposalto the april 2014 stc that prima be cancelled, and that eso resources beconcentrated on ensuring that gravity and matisse are a success. this proposalwas recommended by the stc in may 2014, and endorsed by eso.

1506.04157	the califa survey across the hubble sequence: spatially resolved stellar  population properties in galaxies	this paper characterizes the radial structure of stellar populationproperties of galaxies in the nearby universe, based on 300 galaxies from thecalifa survey. the sample covers a wide range of hubble types, and galaxystellar mass. we apply the spectral synthesis techniques to recover the stellarmass surface density, stellar extinction, light and mass-weighted ages, andmass-weighted metallicity, for each spatial resolution element in our targetgalaxies. to study mean trends with overall galaxy properties, the individualradial profiles are stacked in seven bins of galaxy morphology. we confirm thatmore massive galaxies are more compact, older, more metal rich, and lessreddened by dust. additionally, we find that these trends are preservedspatially with the radial distance to the nucleus. deviations from theserelations appear correlated with hubble type: earlier types are more compact,older, and more metal rich for a given mass, which evidences that quenching isrelated to morphology, but not driven by mass. negative gradients of ages areconsistent with an inside-out growth of galaxies, with the largest agesgradients in sb-sbc galaxies. further, the mean stellar ages of disks andbulges are correlated, with disks covering a wider range of ages, and late typespirals hosting younger disks. the gradients in stellar mass surface densitydepend mostly on stellar mass, in the sense that more massive galaxies are morecentrally concentrated. there is a secondary correlation in the sense that atthe same mass early type galaxies have steeper gradients. we find mildlynegative metallicity gradients, shallower than predicted from models of galaxyevolution in isolation. the largest gradients occur in sb galaxies. overall weconclude that quenching processes act in manners that are independent of mass,while metallicity and galaxy structure are influenced by mass-dependentprocesses.

astro-ph;0208322	a dynamical study of the circumstellar gas in ux orionis	we present the results of a high spectral resolution study of thecircumstellar (cs) gas around the intermediate mass, pre-main sequence star uxori. the results are based on a set of 10 echelle spectra, monitoring the staron time scales of months, days and hours. a large number of transientblueshifted and redshifted absorption features are detected in the balmer andin many metallic lines. a multigaussian fit is applied to determine for eachtransient absorption the velocity, v, dispersion velocity, delta v, and theparameter r, which provides a measure of the absorption strength of the cs gas.the time evolution of those parameters is presented and discussed. a comparisonof intensity ratios among the transient absorptions suggests a solar-likecomposition of the cs gas. this confirms previous results and excludes a verymetal-rich environment as the cause of the transient features in ux ori. thefeatures can be grouped by their similar velocities into 24 groups, of which 17are redshifted and 7 blueshifted. an analysis of the velocity of the groupsallows us to identify them as signatures of the dynamical evolution of 7 clumpsof gas, of which 4 represent accretion events and 3 outflow events. most of theevents decelerate at a rate of tenths of ms-2, while 2 events accelerate atapproximately the same rate; one event is seen experiencing both anacceleration and a deceleration phase and lasts for a period of few days. thistime scale seems to be the typical duration of outflowing and infalling eventsin ux ori. the dispersion velocity and the relative aborption strength of thefeatures do not show drastic changes during the lifetime of the events, whichsuggests they are gaseous blobs preserving their geometrical and physicalidentity.

astro-ph;0209254	ao observations of three powerful radio galaxies	the host galaxies of powerful radio sources are ideal laboratories to studyactive galactic nuclei (agn). the galaxies themselves are among the mostmassive systems in the universe, and are believed to harbor supermassive blackholes (smbh). if large galaxies are formed in a hierarchical way by multiplemerger events, radio galaxies at low redshift represent the end-products ofthis process. however, it is not clear why some of these massive ellipticalshave associated radio emission, while others do not. both are thought tocontain smbhs, with masses proportional to the total luminous mass in thebulge. it either implies every smbh has recurrent radio-loud phases, and theradio-quiet galaxies happen to be in the "low" state, or that the radio galaxynuclei are physically different from radio-quiet ones, i.e. by having a moremassive smbh for a given bulge mass.  here we present the first results from our adaptive optics imaging andspectroscopy pilot program on three nearby powerful radio galaxies. initiatinga larger, more systematic ao survey of radio galaxies (preferentially withlaser guide star equipped ao systems) has the potential of furthering ourunderstanding of the physical properties of radio sources, their triggering,and their subsequent evolution.
