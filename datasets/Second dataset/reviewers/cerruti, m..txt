1205.5485	spectral analysis and interpretation of the \gamma-ray emission from the  starburst galaxy ngc 253	very-high-energy (vhe; e &gt;100 gev) and high-energy (he; 100 mev &lt; e &lt; 100gev) data from \gamma-ray observations performed with the h.e.s.s. telescopearray and the fermi-lat instrument, respectively, are analysed in order toinvestigate the non-thermal processes in the starburst galaxy ngc 253. the vhe\gamma-ray data can be described by a power law in energy with differentialphoton index \gamma=2.14 \pm 0.18_stat \pm 0.30_sys and differential fluxnormalisation at 1 tev of f_0 = (9.6 \pm 1.5_stat (+5.7,-2.9)_sys) x 10^{-14}tev^{-1} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. a power-law fit to the differential he \gamma-rayspectrum reveals a photon index of \gamma=2.24 \pm 0.14_stat \pm 0.03_sys andan integral flux between 200 mev and 200 gev of f(0.2-200 gev) = (4.9 \pm1.0_stat \pm 0.3_sys) x 10^{-9} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. no evidence for a spectralbreak or turnover is found over the dynamic range of both the lat instrumentand the h.e.s.s. experiment: a combined fit of a power law to the he and vhe\gamma-ray data results in a differential photon index \gamma=2.34 \pm 0.03with a p-value of 30%. the \gamma-ray observations indicate that at least about20% of the energy of the cosmic rays capable of producing hadronic interactionsis channeled into pion production. the smooth alignment between the spectra inthe he and vhe \gamma-ray domain suggests that the same transport processesdominate in the entire energy range. advection is most likely responsible forcharged particle removal from the starburst nucleus from gev to multiple tevenergies. in a hadronic scenario for the \gamma-ray production, the singleoverall power-law spectrum observed would therefore correspond to the meanenergy spectrum produced by the ensemble of cosmic-ray sources in the starburstregion.

1208.1370	constraints on the gamma-ray emission from the cluster-scale agn  outburst in the hydra a galaxy cluster	in some galaxy clusters powerful agn have blown bubbles with cluster scaleextent into the ambient medium. the main pressure support of these bubbles isnot known to date, but cosmic rays are a viable possibility. for such ascenario copious gamma-ray emission is expected as a tracer of cosmic rays fromthese systems. hydra a, the closest galaxy cluster hosting a cluster scale agnoutburst, located at a redshift of 0.0538, is investigated for being agamma-ray emitter with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) array andthe fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat). data obtained in 20.2 hours ofdedicated h.e.s.s. observations and 38 months of fermi-lat data, gathered byits usual all-sky scanning mode, have been analyzed to search for a gamma-raysignal. no signal has been found in either data set. upper limits on thegamma-ray flux are derived and are compared to models. these are the firstlimits on gamma-ray emission ever presented for galaxy clusters hosting clusterscale agn outbursts. the non-detection of hydra a in gamma-rays has importantimplications on the particle populations and physical conditions inside thebubbles in this system. for the case of bubbles mainly supported by hadroniccosmic rays, the most favorable scenario, that involves full mixing betweencosmic rays and embedding medium, can be excluded. however, hadronic cosmicrays still remain a viable pressure support agent to sustain the bubblesagainst the thermal pressure of the ambient medium. the largest population ofhighly-energetic electrons which are relevant for inverse-compton gamma-rayproduction is found in the youngest inner lobes of hydra a. the limit on theinverse-compton gamma-ray flux excludes a magnetic field below half of theequipartition value of 16 mug in the inner lobes.

1210.1359	probing the extent of the non-thermal emission from the vela x region at  tev energies with h.e.s.s	vela x is a region of extended radio emission in the western part of the velaconstellation: one of the nearest pulsar wind nebulae (pwne), and associatedwith the energetic vela pulsar (psr b0833-45). extended very-high-energy (vhe)$\gamma$-ray emission (hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen 455}$) was discovered usingthe h.e.s.s. experiment in 2004. the vhe $\gamma$-ray emission was found to becoincident with a region of x-ray emission discovered with ${\it rosat}$ above1.5 kev (the so-called \textit{vela x cocoon}): a filamentary structureextending southwest from the pulsar to the centre of vela x. a deeperobservation of the entire vela x nebula region, also including larger offsetsfrom the cocoon, has been performed with h.e.s.s. this re-observation wascarried out in order to probe the extent of the non-thermal emission from thevela x region at tev energies and to investigate its spectral properties. inorder to increase the sensitivity to the faint $\gamma$-ray emission from thevery extended vela x region, a multivariate analysis method combining threecomplementary reconstruction techniques of cherenkov-shower images is appliedfor the selection of $\gamma$-ray events. the analysis is performed with theon/off background method, which estimates the background from separateobservations pointing away from vela x; towards regions free of $\gamma$-raysources but with comparable observation conditions. the $\gamma$-ray surfacebrightness over the large vela x region reveals that the detection ofnon-thermal vhe $\gamma$-ray emission from the pwn hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen455}$ is statistically significant over a region of radius 1.2$^{\circ}$ aroundthe position $\alpha$ = 08$^{\mathrm{h}}$ 35$^{\mathrm{m}}$ 00$^{\mathrm{s}}$,$\delta$ = -45$^{\circ}$ 36$^{\mathrm{\prime}}$00$^{\mathrm{\prime}\mathrm{\prime}}$ (j2000).

1404.1613	tev {\gamma}-ray observations of the young synchrotron-dominated snrs  g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 with h.e.s.s	the non-thermal nature of the x-ray emission from the shell-type supernovaremnants (snrs) g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 is an indication of intense particleacceleration in the shock fronts of both objects. this suggests that the snrsare prime candidates for very-high-energy (vhe; e $&gt;$ 0.1 tev) {\gamma}-rayobservations. g1.9+0.3, recently established as the youngest known snr in thegalaxy, also offers a unique opportunity to study the earliest stages of snrevolution in the vhe domain. the purpose of this work is to probe the level ofvhe {\gamma}-ray emission from both snrs and use this to constrain theirphysical properties. observations were conducted with the h.e.s.s. (high energystereoscopic system) cherenkov telescope array over a more than six-year periodspanning 2004-2010. the obtained data have effective livetimes of 67 h forg1.9+0.3 and 16 h for g330.2+1.0. the data are analyzed in the context of themulti-wavelength observations currently available and in the framework of bothleptonic and hadronic particle acceleration scenarios. no significant{\gamma}-ray signal from g1.9+0.3 or g330.2+1.0 was detected. upper limits (99%confidence level) to the tev flux from g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 for the assumedspectral index {\gamma} = 2.5 were set at 5.6 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above 0.26 tev and 3.2 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ above0.38 tev, respectively. in a one-zone leptonic scenario, these upper limitsimply lower limits on the interior magnetic field to b$_{\mathrm{g1.9}}$$\gtrsim$ 11 {\mu}g for g1.9+0.3 and to b$_{\mathrm{g330}}$ $\gtrsim$ 8 {\mu}gfor g330.2+1.0. in a hadronic scenario, the low ambient densities and the largedistances to the snrs result in very low predicted fluxes, for which theh.e.s.s. upper limits are not constraining.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1411.5968	a hadronic origin for ultra-high-frequency-peaked bl lac objects	current cherenkov telescopes have identified a population ofultra-high-frequency peaked bl lac objects (uhbls), also known as extremeblazars, that exhibit exceptionally hard tev spectra, including 1es 0229+200,1es 0347-121, rgb j0710+591, 1es 1101-232, and 1es 1218+304. although one-zonesynchrotron-self-compton (ssc) models have been generally successful ininterpreting the high-energy emission observed in other bl lac objects, theyare problematic for uhbls, necessitating very large doppler factors and/orextremely high minimum lorentz factors of the emitting leptonic population. inthis context, we have investigated alternative scenarios where hadronicemission processes are important, using a newly developed (lepto-)hadronicnumerical code to systematically explore the physical parameters of theemission region that reproduces the observed spectra while avoiding the extremevalues encountered in pure ssc models. assuming a fixed doppler factor$\delta=30$, two principal parameter regimes are identified, where thehigh-energy emission is due to: 1) proton-synchrotron radiation, with magneticfields $b \sim 1-100\ \textrm{g}$ and maximum proton energies $e_{p;max}\lesssim 10^{19}$ ev; and 2) synchrotron emission from p-$\gamma$-inducedcascades as well as ssc emission from primary leptons, with $b \sim 0.1-1\\textrm{g}$ and $e_{p;max} \lesssim 10^{17}$ ev. this can be realized withplausible, sub-eddington values for the total (kinetic plus magnetic) power ofthe emitting plasma, in contrast to hadronic interpretations for other blazarclasses that often warrant highly super-eddington values.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1506.06246	veritas detection of $\gamma$-ray flaring activity from the bl lac  object 1es 1727+502 during bright moonlight observations	during moonlit nights, observations with ground-based cherenkov telescopes atvery high energies (vhe, $e&gt;100$ gev) are constrained since the photomultipliertubes (pmts) in the telescope camera are extremely sensitive to the backgroundmoonlight. observations with the veritas telescopes in the standardconfiguration are performed only with a moon illumination less than 35$\%$ offull moon. since 2012, the veritas collaboration has implemented a newobserving mode under bright moonlight, by either reducing the voltage appliedto the pmts (reduced-high-voltage configuration, rhv), or by utilizinguv-transparent filters. while these operating modes result in lower sensitivityand increased energy thresholds, the extension of the available observing timeis useful for monitoring variable sources such as blazars and sources requiringspectral measurements at the highest energies. in this paper we report thedetection of $\gamma$-ray flaring activity from the bl lac object 1es 1727+502during rhv observations. this detection represents the first evidence of vhevariability from this blazar. the integral flux is$(1.1\pm0.2)\times10^{-11}\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$ above 250 gev, which is aboutfive times higher than the low-flux state. the detection triggered additional\veritas\ observations during standard dark-time. multiwavelength observationswith the flwo 48" telescope, and the swift and fermi satellites are presentedand used to produce the first spectral energy distribution (sed) of this objectduring $\gamma$-ray flaring activity. the sed is then fitted with a standardsynchrotron-self-compton model, placing constraints on the properties of theemitting region and of the acceleration mechanism at the origin of therelativistic particle population in the jet.

1509.04936	first nustar observations of mrk 501 within a radio to tev  multi-instrument campaign	we report on simultaneous broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazarmarkarian 501 between 1 april and 10 august 2013, including the first detailedcharacterization of the synchrotron peak with swift and nustar. during thecampaign, the nearby bl lac object was observed in both a quiescent and anelevated state. the broadband campaign includes observations with nustar,magic, veritas, the fermi large area telescope (lat), swift x-ray telescope anduv optical telescope, various ground-based optical instruments, including thegasp-webt program, as well as radio observations by ovro, mets\"ahovi and thef-gamma consortium. some of the magic observations were affected by a sandlayer from the saharan desert, and had to be corrected using event-by-eventcorrections derived with a lidar (light detection and ranging) facility. thisis the first time that lidar information is used to produce a physics resultwith cherenkov telescope data taken during adverse atmospheric conditions, andhence sets a precedent for the current and future ground-based gamma-rayinstruments. the nustar instrument provides unprecedented sensitivity in hardx-rays, showing the source to display a spectral energy distribution between 3and 79 kev consistent with a log-parabolic spectrum and hard x-ray variabilityon hour timescales. none (of the four extended nustar observations) showsevidence of the onset of inverse-compton emission at hard x-ray energies. weapply a single-zone equilibrium synchrotron self-compton model to fivesimultaneous broadband spectral energy distributions. we find that thesynchrotron self-compton model can reproduce the observed broadband statesthrough a decrease in the magnetic field strength coinciding with an increasein the luminosity and hardness of the relativistic leptons responsible for thehigh-energy emission.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.
