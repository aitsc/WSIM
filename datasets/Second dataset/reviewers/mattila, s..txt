0903.1286	sn 2008s: an electron capture sn from a super-agb progenitor?	we present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of thefaint transient sn 2008s discovered in ngc 6946. sn 2008s exhibited slowphotometric evolution and almost no spectral variability during the first ninemonths, implying a high density cs medium. the light curve is similar in shapeto that of sn 1998s and sn 1979c, although significantly fainter at maximumlight. our quasi-bolometric lightcurve extends to 300 days and shows a tailphase decay rate consistent with that of ^{56}co. we propose that this isevidence for an explosion and formation of ^{56}ni (0.0015 +/- 0.0004 m_sun).the large mir flux detected shortly after explosion can be explained by a lightecho from pre-exisiting dust. the late nir flux excess is plausibly due to acombination of warm newly-formed ejecta dust together with shock-heated dust inthe cs environment. we reassess the progenitor object detected previously inspitzer archive images, supplementing this discussion with a model of the mirspectral energy distribution. this supports the idea of a dusty, opticallythick shell around sn 2008s with an inner radius of nearly 90au and outerradius of 450au, and an inferred heating source of 3000 k and luminosity of l ~10^{4.6} l_sun. the combination of our monitoring data and the evidence fromthe progenitor analysis leads us to support the scenario of a weak electroncapture supernova explosion in a super-agb progenitor star (of initial mass 6-8m_sun) embedded within a thick cs gaseous envelope. we suggest that all of mainproperties of the electron capture sn phenomenon are observed in sn 2008s andfuture observations may allow a definitive answer.

0904.0637	sn 1999ga: a low-luminosity linear type ii supernova?	type ii-linear supernovae are thought to arise from progenitors that havelost most of their h envelope by the time of the explosion, and they are poorlyunderstood because they are only occasionally discovered. it is possible thatthey are intrinsically rare, but selection effects due to their rapidluminosity evolution may also play an important role in limiting the number ofdetections. in this context, the discovery of a subluminous type ii-linearevent is even more interesting. we investigate the physical properties andcharacterise the explosion site of the type ii sn 1999ga, which exploded in thenearby spiral galaxy ngc 2442. spectroscopic and photometric observations of sn1999ga allow us to constrain the energetics of the explosion and to estimatethe mass of the ejected material, shedding light on the nature of theprogenitor star in the final stages of its life. the study of the environmentin the vicinity of the explosion site provides information on a possiblerelation between these unusual supernovae and the properties of the galaxieshosting them. despite the lack of early-time observations, we providereasonable evidence that sn 1999ga was probably a type ii-linear supernova thatejected a few solar masses of material, with a very small amount of radioactiveelements of the order of 0.01 solar masses.

0704.1244	sn 2003du: 480 days in the life of a normal type ia supernova	an extensive set of optical and nir photometry and low-resolution spectra thetype ia supernova (sn ia) 2003du was obtained using a number of facilities. theobservations started 13 days before b-band maximum light and continued for 480days with exceptionally good time sampling. the optical photometry wascalibrated through the s-correction technique.  the ubvrijhk light curves and the color indices of sn 2003du closely resemblethose of normal sne ia. sn 2003du reached a b-band maximum of 13.49 (+/-0.02)mag on jd2452766.38 (+/-0.5). we derive a b-band stretch parameter of 0.988(+/-0.003), which corresponds to dm15=1.02 (+/-0.05), indicative of a sn ia ofstandard luminosity. the reddening in the host galaxy was estimated by threemethods, and was consistently found to be negligible. we estimate a distancemodulus of 32.79 (+/-0.15) mag to the host galaxy, ugc 9391. the peak uvoirbolometric luminosity of 1.35(+/-0.20) 10^43 erg/s and arnett's rule impliesthat m(ni56)=0.68 (+/-0.14)m_sun of ni56 was synthesized during the explosion.modeling of the uvoir bolometric light curve also indicates m(ni56) in therange 0.6-0.8 m_sun. the spectral evolution of sn 2003du at both optical andnir wavelengths also closely resembles normal sne ia. in particular, the si iiratio at maximum r(si ii)=0.22 (+/-0.02) and the time evolution of theblueshift velocities of the absorption line minima are typical. the pre-maximumspectra of sn 2003du showed conspicuous high-velocity features in the ca ii h&amp;kdoublet and infrared triplet, and possibly in si ii 6355, lines. we compare thetime evolution of the profiles of these lines with other well-observed sne iaand we suggest that the peculiar pre-maximum evolution of si ii 6355 line inmany sne ia is due to the presence of two blended absorption components.

0907.2644	radio monitoring of ngc 7469: late time radio evolution of sn 2000ft and  the circumnuclear starburst in ngc 7469	we present the results of an eight-year long monitoring of the radio emissionfrom the luminous infrared galaxy (lirg) ngc 7469, using 8.4 ghz very largearray (vla) observations at 0.3'' resolution. our monitoring shows that thelate time evolution of the radio supernova sn 2000ft follows a decline verysimilar to that displayed at earlier times of its optically thin phase. thelate time radio emission of sn 2000ft is therefore still being powered by itsinteraction with the presupernova stellar wind, and not with the interstellarmedium (ism). indeed, the ram pressure of the presupernova wind is \rho_w v_w^2\approx 7.6e-9 dyn/cm^2, at a supernova age of approximately 2127 days, whichis significantly larger than the expected pressure of the ism around sn 2000ft.at this age, the sn shock has reached a distance r_{sh \approx 0.06 pc, and ourobservations are probing the interaction of the sn with dense material that wasejected by the presupernova star about 5820 years prior to its explosion. fromour vla monitoring, we estimate that the swept-up mass by the supernova shockafter about six years of expansion is \approx 0.29 m_sun, assuming an averageexpansion speed of the supernova of 10000 km/s.  we also searched for recently exploded core-collapse supernovae in our vlaimages. apart from sn 2000ft (s_\nu \approx 1760 microjy at its peak,corresponding to 1.1e28 erg/s/hz, we found no evidence for any other radiosupernova (rsn) more luminous than \approx 6.0e26 erg/s/hz, which suggests thatno other type iin sn has exploded since 2000 in the circumnuclear starburst ofngc 7469.

0912.3302	on the nature of the progenitors of three type ii-p supernovae: 2004et,  2006my and 2006ov	the pre-explosion observations of the type ii-p supernovae 2006my, 2006ov and2004et, are re-analysed. in the cases of supernovae 2006my and 2006ov we arguethat the published candidate progenitors are not coincident with theirrespective supernova sites in pre-explosion hubble space telescopeobservations. we therefore derive upper luminosity and mass limits for theunseen progenitors of both these supernovae, assuming they are red supergiants:2006my (log l/lsun = 4.51; mass &lt; 13msun) and 2006ov (log l/lsun = 4.29; mass &lt;10msun). in the case of supernova 2004et we show that the yellow-supergiantprogenitor candidate, originally identified in canada france hawaii telescopeimages, is still visible ~3 years post-explosion in observations from thewilliam herschel telescope. high-resolution hubble space telescope and gemini(north) adaptive optics late-time imagery reveal that this source is not asingle yellow supergiant star, but rather is resolved into at least threedistinct sources. we report the discovery of the unresolved progenitor as anexcess of flux in pre-explosion isaac newton telescope i'-band imaging.accounting for the late-time contribution of the supernova using publishedoptical spectra, we calculate the progenitor photometry as the differencebetween the pre- and post-explosion, ground-based observations. we find theprogenitor was most likely a late k to late m-type supergiant of 8 +5/-1 msun.in all cases we conclude that future, high-resolution observations of thesupernova sites will be required to confirm these results.

1006.0504	multiple major outbursts from a restless luminous blue variable in ngc  3432	we present new photometric and spectroscopic observations of an unusualluminous blue variable (lbv) in ngc 3432, covering three major outbursts inoctober 2008, april 2009 and november 2009. previously, this star experiencedan outburst also in 2000 (known as sn 2000ch). during outbursts the starreached an absolute magnitude between -12.1 and -12.8. its spectrum showed h,he i and fe ii lines with p-cygni profiles during and soon after the eruptivephases, while only intermediate-width lines in pure emission (including he ii4686a were visible during quiescence. the fast-evolving light curve soon afterthe outbursts, the quasi-modulated light curve, the peak magnitude and theoverall spectral properties are consistent with multiple episodes ofvariability of an extremely active lbv. however, the widths of the spectrallines indicate unusually high wind velocities (1500-2800 km/s), similar tothose observed in wolf-rayet stars. although modulated light curves are typicalof lbvs during the s-dor variability phase, the luminous maxima and the highfrequency of outbursts are unexpected in s-dor variables. such extremevariability may be associated with repeated ejection episodes during a gianteruption of an lbv. alternatively, it may be indicative of a high level ofinstability shortly preceding the core-collapse or due to interaction with amassive, binary companion. in this context, the variable in ngc 3432 sharessome similarities with the famous stellar system hd 5980 in the smallmagellanic cloud, which includes an erupting lbv and an early wolf-rayet star.

1008.2674	ultra-bright optical transients are linked with type ic supernovae	recent searches by unbiased, wide-field surveys have uncovered a group ofextremely luminous optical transients. the initial discoveries of sn 2005ap bythe texas supernova search and scp-06f6 in a deep hubble pencil beam surveywere followed by the palomar transient factory confirmation of host redshiftsfor other similar transients. the transients share the common properties ofhigh optical luminosities (peak magnitudes ~ -21 to -23), blue colors, and alack of h or he spectral features. the physical mechanism that produces theluminosity is uncertain, with suggestions ranging from jet-driven explosion topulsational pair-instability. here we report the most detailed photometric andspectral coverage of an ultra-bright transient (sn 2010gx) detected in thepan-starrs 1 sky survey. in common with other transients in this family,early-time spectra show a blue continuum, and prominent broad absorption linesof o ii. however, about 25d after discovery, the spectra developed type icsupernova features, showing the characteristic broad fe ii and si ii absorptionlines. detailed, post-maximum follow-up may show that all sn 2005ap andscp-06f6 type transients are linked to supernovae ic. this poses problems inunderstanding the physics of the explosions: there is no indication fromlate-time photometry that the luminosity is powered by 56ni, the broadlightcurves suggest very large ejected masses, and the slow spectral evolutionis quite different from typical ic timescales. the nature of the progenitorstars and the origin of the luminosity are intriguing and open questions.

1111.2497	sn 2009e: a faint clone of sn 1987a	in this paper we investigate the properties of sn 2009e, which exploded in arelatively nearby spiral galaxy (ngc 4141) and that is probably the faintest1987a-like supernova discovered so far. spectroscopic observations whichstarted about 2 months after the supernova explosion, highlight significantdifferences between sn 2009e and the prototypical sn 1987a. modelling the dataof sn 2009e allows us to constrain the explosion parameters and the propertiesof the progenitor star, and compare the inferred estimates with those availablefor the similar sne 1987a and 1998a. the light curve of sn 2009e is lessluminous than that of sn 1987a and the other members of this class, and themaximum light curve peak is reached at a slightly later epoch than in sn 1987a.late-time photometric observations suggest that sn 2009e ejected about 0.04solar masses of 56ni, which is the smallest 56ni mass in our sample of1987a-like events. modelling the observations with a radiation hydrodynamicscode, we infer for sn 2009e a kinetic plus thermal energy of about 0.6 foe, aninitial radius of ~7 x 10^12 cm and an ejected mass of ~19 solar masses. thephotospheric spectra show a number of narrow (v~1800 km/s) metal lines, withunusually strong ba ii lines. the nebular spectrum displays narrow emissionlines of h, na i, [ca ii] and [o i], with the [o i] feature being relativelystrong compared to the [ca ii] doublet. the overall spectroscopic evolution isreminiscent of that of the faint 56ni-poor type ii-plateau supernovae. thissuggests that sn 2009e belongs to the low-luminosity, low 56ni mass, low-energytail in the distribution of the 1987a-like objects in the same manner as sn1997d and similar events represent the faint tail in the distribution ofphysical properties for normal type ii-plateau supernovae.

1205.0353	sn 2009kn - the twin of the type iin supernova 1994w	we present an optical and near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic studyof supernova (sn) 2009kn spanning ~1.5 yr from the discovery. the opticalspectra are dominated by the narrow (full width at half-maximum ~1000 km s^-1)balmer lines distinctive of a type iin sn with p cygni profiles. contrarily,the photometric evolution resembles more that of a type iip sn with a largedrop in luminosity at the end of the plateau phase. these characteristics aresimilar to those of sn 1994w, whose nature has been explained with twodifferent models with different approaches. the well-sampled data set on sn2009kn offers the possibility to test these models, in the case of both sn2009kn and sn 1994w. we associate the narrow p cygni lines with a swept-upshell composed of circumstellar matter and sn ejecta. the broad emission linewings, seen during the plateau phase, arise from internal electron scatteringin this shell. the slope of the light curve after the post-plateau drop isfairly consistent with that expected from the radioactive decay of 56co,suggesting an sn origin for sn 2009kn. assuming radioactivity to be the mainsource powering the light curve of sn 2009kn in the tail phase, we infer anupper limit for 56ni mass of 0.023 m_sun. this is significantly higher thanthat estimated for sn 1994w, which also showed a much steeper decline of thelight curve after the post-plateau drop. we also observe late-timenear-infrared emission which most likely arises from newly formed dust producedby sn 2009kn. as with sn 1994w, no broad lines are observed in the spectra ofsn 2009kn, not even in the late-time tail phase.

1206.1314	core-collapse supernovae missed by optical surveys	we estimate the fraction of core-collapse supernovae (ccsne) that remainundetected by optical sn searches due to obscuration by large amounts of dustin their host galaxies. this effect is especially important in luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies, which are locally rare but dominate the starformation at redshifts of z~1-2. we perform a detailed investigation of the snactivity in the nearby luminous infrared galaxy arp 299 and estimate that up to83% of the sne in arp 299 and in similar galaxies in the local universe aremissed by observations at optical wavelengths. for rest-frame optical surveyswe find the fraction of sne missed due to high dust extinction to increase fromthe average local value of ~19% to ~38% at z~1.2 and then stay roughly constantup to z~2. it is therefore crucial to take into account the effects ofobscuration by dust when determining sn rates at high redshift and whenpredicting the number of ccsne detectable by future high-z surveys such aslsst, jwst, and euclid. for a sample of nearby ccsne (distances 6-15 mpc)detected during the last 12 yr, we find a lower limit for the local ccsn rateof 1.5 +0.4/-0.3 x 10^-4 yr^-1 mpc^-3, consistent with that expected from thestar formation rate. even closer, at distances less than ~6 mpc, we find asignificant increase in the ccsn rate, indicating a local overdensity of starformation caused by a small number of galaxies that have each hosted multiplesne.

1206.6897	the rate of supernovae at redshift 0.1-1.0 - the stockholm vimos  supernova survey iv	we present supernova rate measurements at redshift 0.1-1.0 from the stockholmvimos supernova survey (sviss). the sample contains 16 supernovae in total. thediscovered supernovae have been classified as core collapse or type iasupernovae (9 and 7, respectively) based on their light curves, colourevolution and host galaxy photometric redshift. the rates we find for the corecollapse supernovae are 3.29 (-1.78,-1.45)(+3.08,+1.98) x 10^-4 yr^-1 mpc^-3h70^3 (with statistical and systematic errors respectively) at average redshift0.39 and 6.40 (-3.12,-2.11)(+5.30,+3.65) x 10^-4 yr^-1 mpc^-3 h70^3 at averageredshift 0.73. for the type ia supernovae we find a rate of 1.29(-0.57,-0.28)(+0.88,+0.27) x 10^-4 yr^-1 mpc^-3 h70^3 at average redshift 0.62.all of these rate estimates have been corrected for host galaxy extinction,using a method that includes supernovae missed in infrared bright galaxies athigh redshift. we use monte carlo simulations to make a thorough study of thesystematic effects from assumptions made when calculating the rates and findthat the most important errors come from misclassification, the assumed mix offaint and bright supernova types and uncertainties in the extinctioncorrection. we compare our rates to other observations and to the predictedrates for core collapse and type ia supernovae based on the star formationhistory and different models of the delay time distribution. overall, ourmeasurements, when taking the effects of extinction into account, agree quitewell with the predictions and earlier results. our results highlight theimportance of understanding the role of systematic effects, and dust extinctionin particular, when trying to estimate the rates of supernovae at moderate tohigh redshift.

1210.3568	interacting supernovae and supernova impostors. sn 2009ip, is this the  end?	we report the results of a 3 year-long dedicated monitoring campaign of arestless luminous blue variable (lbv) in ngc 7259. the object, named sn 2009ip,was observed photometrically and spectroscopically in the optical andnear-infrared domains. we monitored a number of erupting episodes in the pastfew years, and increased the density of our observations during eruptiveepisodes. in this paper we present the full historical data set from 2009-2012with multi-wavelength dense coverage of the two high luminosity events betweenaugust - september 2012. we construct bolometric light curves and measure thetotal luminosities of these eruptive or explosive events. we label them the2012a event (lasting ~50 days) with a peak of 3x10^41 erg/s, and the 2012bevent (14 day rise time, still ongoing) with a peak of 8x10^42 erg/s. thelatter event reached an absolute r-band magnitude of about -18, comparable tothat of a core-collapse supernova (sn). our historical monitoring has detectedhigh-velocity spectral features (~13000 km/s) in september 2011, one yearbefore the current sn-like event. this implies that the detection of such highvelocity outflows cannot, conclusively, point to a core-collapse sn origin. wesuggest that the initial peak in the 2012a event was unlikely to be due to afaint core-collapse sn. we propose that the high intrinsic luminosity of thelatest peak, the variability history of sn 2009ip, and the detection of broadspectral lines indicative of high-velocity ejecta are consistent with apulsational pair-instability event, and that the star may have survived thelast outburst. the question of the survival of the lbv progenitor star and itsfuture fate remain open issues, only to be answered with future monitoring ofthis historically unique explosion.

1302.7152	a late-time view of the progenitors of five type iip supernovae	the acquisition of late-time imaging is an important step in the analysis ofpre-explosion observations of the progenitors of supernovae. we presentlate-time hst acs wfc observations of the sites of five type iip sne: 1999ev,2003gd, 2004a, 2005cs and 2006my. observations were conducted using the f435w,f555w and f814w filters. we confirm the progenitor identifications for sne2003gd, 2004a and 2005cs, through their disappearance. we find that a sourcepreviously excluded as being the progenitor of sn 2006my has now disappeared.the late-time observations of the site of sn 1999ev cast significant doubt overthe nature of the source previously identified as the progenitor inpre-explosion wfpc2 images. the use of image subtraction techniques yieldsimproved precision over photometry conducted on just the pre-explosion imagesalone. in particular, we note the increased depth of detection limits derivedon pre-explosion frames in conjunction with late-time images. we use sedfitting techniques to explore the effect of different reddening componentstowards the progenitors. for sne 2003gd and 2005cs, the pre-explosionobservations are sufficiently constraining that only limited amounts of dust(either interstellar or circumstellar) are permitted. assuming only a galacticreddening law, we determine the initial masses for the progenitors of sne2003gd, 2004a, 2005cs and 2006my of 8.4+/-2.0, 12.0+/-2.1, 9.5(+3.4,-2.2) and9.8+/-1.7msun, respectively.

1305.1851	optical and near-infrared observations of sn 2011dh - the first 100 days	we present optical and near-infrared (nir) photometry and spectroscopy of thetype iib supernova (sn) 2011dh for the first 100 days. we complement ourextensive dataset with swift ultra-violet (uv) and spitzer mid-infrared (mir)data to build a uv to mir bolometric lightcurve using both photometric andspectroscopic data. hydrodynamical modelling of the sn based on this bolometriclightcurve have been presented in bersten (2012). we find that the absorptionminimum for the hydrogen lines is never seen below ~11000 km/s but approachesthis value as the lines get weaker. this suggests that the interface betweenthe helium core and hydrogen rich envelope is located near this velocity inagreement with the bersten et al. (2012) he4r270 ejecta model. spectralmodelling of the hydrogen lines using this ejecta model supports the conclusionand we find a hydrogen mass of 0.01-0.04 solar masses to be consistent with theobserved spectral evolution. we estimate that the photosphere reaches thehelium core at 5-7 days whereas the helium lines appear between ~10 and ~15days, close to the photosphere and then move outward in velocity until ~40days. this suggests that increasing non-thermal excitation due to decreasingoptical depth for the gamma-rays is driving the early evolution of these lines.we also provide and discuss pre- and post-explosion observations of the sn sitewhich shows a reduction by 75 percent in flux at the position of the yellowsupergiant coincident with sn 2011dh. the b, v and r band decline rates of0.0073, 0.0090 and 0.0053 mag/day respectively are consistent with theremaining flux being emitted by the sn. hence we find that the star was indeedthe progenitor of sn 2011dh as previously suggested by maund et al. (2011) andwhich is also consistent with the results from the hydrodynamical modelling.

0801.2277	massive stars exploding in a he-rich circumstellar medium. i. type ibn  (sn 2006jc-like) events	we present new spectroscopic and photometric data of the type ibn supernovae2006jc, 2000er and 2002ao. we discuss the general properties of this recentlyproposed supernova family, which also includes sn 1999cq. the early-timemonitoring of sn 2000er traces the evolution of this class of objects duringthe first few days after the shock breakout. an overall similarity in thephotometric and spectroscopic evolution is found among the members of thisgroup, which would be unexpected if the energy in these core-collapse eventswas dominated by the interaction between supernova ejecta and circumstellarmedium. type ibn supernovae appear to be rather normal type ib/c supernovaexplosions which occur within a he-rich circumstellar environment. sne ibn aretherefore likely produced by the explosion of wolf-rayet progenitors stillembedded in the he-rich material lost by the star in recent mass-loss episodes,which resemble known luminous blue variable eruptions. the evolved wolf-rayetstar could either result from the evolution of a very massive star or be themore evolved member of a massive binary system. we also suggest that there area number of arguments in favour of a type ibn classification for the historicalsn 1885a (s-andromedae), previously considered as an anomalous type ia eventwith some resemblance to sn 1991bg.

1308.4393	a new precise mass for the progenitor of the type iip sn 2008bk	the progenitor of the type iip sn 2008bk was discovered in pre-explosiong'r'i'iyjhks images, acquired with european southern observatory very largetelescope fors, hawk-i and isaac instruments and the gemini gmos-s instrument.the wealth of pre-explosion observations makes the progenitor of this sn one ofthe best studied, since the detection of the progenitor of sn1987a. previousanalyses of the properties of the progenitor were hampered by the limitedquality of the photometric calibration of the pre-explosion images and thecrowded nature of the field containing the sn. we present new late-timeobservations of the site of sn2008bk acquired with identical instrument andfilter configurations as the pre-explosion observations, and confirm that thepreviously identified red supergiant star was the progenitor of this sn and hasnow disappeared. image subtraction techniques were used to conduct precisephotometry of the now missing progenitor, independently of blending from anynearby stars. the nature of the surrounding stellar population and theircontribution to the flux attributed to the progenitor in the pre-explosionimages are probed using hst wfc3 uvis/ir observations. in comparison with marcssynthetic spectra, we find the progenitor was a highly reddened rsg withluminosity log (l/lsun)=4.84+/-0.11, corresponding to an initial mass ofminit=12.9+/-1.7msun. the temperature of the progenitor was hotter thanpreviously expected for rsgs (t ~ 4330k), but consistent with new temperaturesderived for rsgs using sed fitting techniques. we show that there is evidencefor significant extinction of the progenitor, possibly arising in the csm; butthat this dust yields a similar reddening law to dust found in the ism(e(b-v)=0.77 with rv=3.1).

1310.4446	slowly fading super-luminous supernovae that are not pair-instability  explosions	super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second attheir peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies atredshifts of 0.1-4. some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'supernovae. such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times thatof the sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. in thesestars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted toelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclearexplosions. many solar masses of 56ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to56fe via 56co, powering bright light curves. such massive progenitors areexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early universe. recently,supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years afterthe big bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the sun was observed to looklike a fading pair-instability supernova. here we report observations of twoslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times andblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. theirlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call thenature of that event into question. our early spectra closely resemble typicalfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered byradioactivity. modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses ofmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosionmechanism. the lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests thattheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of thecore-collapse rate.

1311.6408	the nature of supernovae 2010o and 2010p in arp 299 - i. near-infrared  and optical evolution	we present near-infrared and optical photometry, plus optical spectroscopy oftwo stripped-envelope supernovae (sne) 2010o and 2010p that exploded in twodifferent components of an interacting luminous infrared galaxy arp 299 withinonly a few days of one another. sn 2010o is found to be photometrically andspectroscopically similar to many normal type ib sne and our multiwavelengthobservations of sn 2010p suggest it to be a type iib sn. no signs of clearhydrogen features or interaction with the circumstellar medium are evident inthe optical spectrum of sn 2010p. we derive estimates for the host galaxyline-of-sight extinctions for both sne, based on both light-curve andspectroscopic comparison finding consistent results. these methods are alsofound to provide much more robust estimates of the sn host galaxy reddeningthan the commonly used empirical relations between extinction and equivalentwidth of na i d absorption features. the sn observations also suggest thatdifferent extinction laws are present in different components of arp 299. forcompleteness, we study high-resolution pre-explosion images of arp 299 and findboth sne to be close to, but not coincident with, extended sources that arelikely massive clusters. a very simple model applied to the bolometric lightcurve of sn 2010o implies a rough estimate for the explosion parameters of$e_{\mathrm{k}} \approx 3 \times 10^{51}$ erg, $m_{\mathrm{ej}} \approx 2.9$m$_{\odot}$ and $m_{\mathrm{ni}} \approx 0.16$ m$_{\odot}$.

1402.1631	selecting superluminous supernovae in faint galaxies from the first year  of the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey	the pan-starrs1 (ps1) survey has obtained imaging in 5 bands (grizy_p1) over10 medium deep survey (mds) fields covering a total of 70 square degrees. thispaper describes the search for apparently hostless supernovae (sne) within thefirst year of ps1 mds data with an aim of discovering new superluminoussupernovae (slsne). a total of 249 hostless transients were discovered down toa limiting magnitude of m_ab ~ 23.5, of which 76 were classified as type iasne. there were 57 sne with complete light curves that are likely core-collapsesne (ccsne) or slsne and 12 of these have had spectra taken. of these 12hostless, non-type ia sne, 7 were slsne of type ic at redshifts between0.5-1.4. this illustrates that the discovery rate of type ic slsne can bemaximised by concentrating on hostless transients and removing normal sne ia.we present data for two new possible slsne; ps1-10pm (z = 1.206) and ps1-10ahf(z = 1.1), and estimate the rate of slsne-ic to be between 3^{+3}_{-2} *10^{-5} and 8^{+2}_{-1} * 10^{-5} of the ccsne rate within 0.3 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.4 byapplying a monte-carlo technique. the rate of slowly evolving, sn2007bi-likeexplosions is estimated as a factor of 10 lower than this range.

1402.2357	super star clusters in luminous infrared galaxies: the sunbird survey	we present recent results from an adaptive optics imaging survey of 40luminous ir galaxies (lirgs) searching for obscured core collapse supernovaeand studying the galaxies themselves. here, in particular, we discuss the superstar clusters (ssc) populations in the lirgs. we have constructed the firststatistically significant samples of luminosity functions (lf) of sscs in thenear-ir, and find evidence that the lf slopes in lirgs are shallower than inmore quiescent spiral galaxies. distance and blending effects were investigatedin detail paving the way for ssc studies further out than done previously. wehave also correlated the luminosities of the brightest clusters with the starformation rates (sfr) of the hosts. the relation is similar, though somewhatsteeper than that found in the optical and at lower sfr levels, suggestingsystematic extinction and/or age effects. we find that the characteristics ofthe relation suggest an underlying physical driver rather than solely asize-of-sample effect. in particular, a truncated luminosity/mass functionwould naturally explain the small scatter we find. finally, we are modellingthe ages and masses of our near-ir detected clusters in conjunction with hstoptical data and present early results of using ssc properties to trace thehistories of the target lirg systems.

1404.2004	towards characterization of the type iip supernova progenitor  population: a statistical sample of light curves from pan-starrs1	in recent years, wide-field sky surveys providing deep multi-band imaginghave presented a new path for indirectly characterizing the progenitorpopulations of core-collapse supernovae (sn): systematic light curve studies.we assemble a set of 76 grizy-band type iip sn light curves from pan-starrs1,obtained over a constant survey program of 4 years and classified using bothspectroscopy and machine learning-based photometric techniques. we develop andapply a new bayesian model for the full multi-band evolution of each lightcurve in the sample. we find no evidence of a sub-population of fast-decliningexplosions (historically referred to as "type iil" sne). however, we identify ahighly significant relation between the plateau phase decay rate and peakluminosity among our sne iip. these results argue in favor of a singleparameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass, predominantly controllingthe explosions of red supergiants. this relation could also be applied forsupernova cosmology, offering a standardizable candle good to an intrinsicscatter of 0.2 mag. we compare each light curve to physical models fromhydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor initial masses and otherproperties of the pan-starrs1 type iip sn sample. we show that correction ofsystematic discrepancies between modeled and observed sn iip light curveproperties and an expanded grid of progenitor properties, are needed to enablerobust progenitor inferences from multi-band light curve samples of this kind.this work will serve as a pathfinder for photometric studies of core-collapsesne to be conducted through future wide field transient searches.

1405.1325	super-luminous supernovae from pessto	we present optical spectra and light curves for three hydrogen-poorsuper-luminous supernovae followed by the public eso spectroscopic survey oftransient objects (pessto). time series spectroscopy from a few days aftermaximum light to 100 days later shows them to be fairly typical of this class,with spectra dominated by ca ii, mg ii, fe ii and si ii, which evolve slowlyover most of the post-peak photospheric phase. we determine bolometric lightcurves and apply simple fitting tools, based on the diffusion of energy inputby magnetar spin-down, 56ni decay, and collision of the ejecta with an opaquecircumstellar shell. we investigate how the heterogeneous light curves of oursample (combined with others from the literature) can help to constrain thepossible mechanisms behind these events. we have followed these events tobeyond 100-200 days after peak, to disentangle host galaxy light from fadingsupernova flux and to differentiate between the models, which predict diversebehaviour at this phase. models powered by radioactivity require unrealisticparameters to reproduce the observed light curves, as found by previousstudies. both magnetar heating and circumstellar interaction still appear to beviable candidates. a large diversity is emerging in observed tail-phaseluminosities, with magnetar models failing in some cases to predict the rapiddrop in flux. this would suggest either that magnetars are not responsible, orthat the x-ray flux from the magnetar wind is not fully trapped. the lightcurve of one object shows a distinct re-brightening at around 100d aftermaximum light. we argue that this could result either from multiple shells ofcircumstellar material, or from a magnetar ionisation front breaking out of theejecta.

1405.3668	rapidly-evolving and luminous transients from pan-starrs1	in the past decade, several rapidly-evolving transients have been discoveredwhose timescales and luminosities are not easily explained by traditionalsupernovae (sn) models. the sample size of these objects has remained smalldue, at least in part, to the challenge of detecting short timescale transientswith traditional survey cadences. here we present the results from a searchwithin the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey (ps1-mds) for rapidly-evolving andluminous transients. we identify 10 new transients with a time abovehalf-maximum of less than 12 days and -16.5 &gt; m &gt; -20 mag. this increases thenumber of known events in this region of sn phase space by roughly a factor ofthree. the median redshift of the ps1-mds sample is z=0.275 and they allexploded in star forming galaxies. in general, the transients possess fasterrise than decline timescale and blue colors at maximum light (g - r &lt; -0.2).best fit blackbodies reveal photospheric temperatures/radii that expand/coolwith time and explosion spectra taken near maximum light are dominated by ablue continuum, consistent with a hot, optically thick, ejecta. we find itdifficult to reconcile the short timescale, high peak luminosity (l &gt; 10^43erg/s), and lack of uv line blanketing observed in many of these transientswith an explosion powered mainly by the radioactive decay of ni-56. rather, wefind that many are consistent with either (1) cooling envelope emission fromthe explosion of a star with a low-mass extended envelope which ejected verylittle (&lt;0.03 m_sun) radioactive material, or (2) a shock breakout within adense, optically thick, wind surrounding the progenitor star. after calculatingthe detection efficiency for objects with rapid timescales in the ps1-mds wefind a volumetric rate of 4800 - 8000 events/yr/gpc^3 (4-7% of thecore-collapse sn rate at z=0.2).

0803.2145	massive stars exploding in a he-rich circumstellar medium iii. sn  2006jc: ir echoes from new and old dust in the progenitor csm	we present near- and mid-infrared (ir) photometric data of the type ibnsupernova (sn) 2006jc obtained with the united kingdom infrared telescope(ukirt), the gemini north telescope, and the spitzer space telescope betweendays 86 and 493 post-explosion. we find that the ir behaviour of sn 2006jc canbe explained as a combination of ir echoes from two manifestations ofcircumstellar material. the bulk of the near-ir emission arises from an ir echofrom newly-condensed dust in a cool dense shell (cds) produced by theinteraction of the ejecta outward shock with a dense shell of circumstellarmaterial ejected by the progenitor in a luminous blue variable (lbv) likeoutburst about two years prior to the sn explosion. the cds dust mass reaches amodest 3.0 x 10^(-4) m(solar) by day 230. while dust condensation within a cdsformed behind the ejecta inward shock has been proposed before for one event(sn 1998s), sn 2006jc is the first one showing evidence for dust condensationin a cds formed behind the ejecta outward shock in the circumstellar material.at later epochs, a substantial and growing contribution to the ir fluxes arisesfrom an ir echo from pre-existing dust in the progenitor wind. the mass of thepre-existing csm dust is at least ~8 x 10^(-3) m(solar). this work thereforeadds to the evidence that mass-loss from the progenitors of core-collapsesupernovae could be a major source of dust in the universe. however, yet again,we see no direct evidence that the explosion of a supernova produces anythingother than a very modest amount of dust.

0705.1439	a spitzer space telescope study of sn 2003gd: still no direct evidence  that core-collapse supernovae are major dust factories	we present a new, detailed analysis of late-time mid-infrared (ir)observations of the type ii-p supernova (sn) 2003gd. at about 16 months afterthe explosion, the mid-ir flux is consistent with emission from 4 x 10^(-5)m(solar) of newly condensed dust in the ejecta. at 22 months emission frompoint-like sources close to the sn position was detected at 8 microns and 24microns. by 42 months the 24 micron flux had faded. considerations ofluminosity and source size rule out the ejecta of sn 2003gd as the main originof the emission at 22 months. a possible alternative explanation for theemission at this later epoch is an ir echo from pre-existing circumstellar orinterstellar dust. we conclude that, contrary to the claim of sugerman et al.(2006, science, 313, 196), the mid-ir emission from sn 2003gd does not supportthe presence of 0.02 m(solar) of newly formed dust in the ejecta. there is, asyet, no direct evidence that core-collapse supernovae are major dust factories.

1409.1758	sn 2005at - a neglected type ic supernova at 10 mpc	we present a photometric and spectroscopic study of a reddened type icsupernova (sn) 2005at. we report our results based on the available data of sn2005at, including late-time observations from the spitzer space telescope andthe hubble space telescope. in particular, late-time mid-infrared observationsare something rare for type ib/c sne. in our study we find sn 2005at to be verysimilar photometrically and spectroscopically to another nearby type ic sn2007gr, underlining the prototypical nature of this well-followed type icevent. the spectroscopy of both events shows similar narrow spectral linefeatures. the radio observations of sn 2005at are consistent with fastevolution and low luminosity at radio wavelengths. the late-time spitzer datasuggest the presence of an unresolved light echo from interstellar dust anddust formation in the ejecta, both of which are unique observations for a typeic sn. the late-time hubble observations reveal a faint point source coincidentwith sn 2005at, which is very likely either a declining light echo of the sn ora compact cluster. for completeness we study ground-based pre-explosionarchival images of the explosion site of sn 2005at, however this only yieldedvery shallow upper limits for the sn progenitor star. we derive a host galaxyextinction of $a_{v} \approx 1.9$ mag for sn 2005at, which is relatively highfor a sn in a normal spiral galaxy not viewed edge-on.

1409.1827	core-collapse and type ia supernovae with the ska	core-collapse sne (ccsne): systematic searches of radio emission from ccsneare still lacking, and only targeted searches of radio emission from just someof the optically discovered ccsne in the local universe have been carried out.optical searches miss a significant fraction of ccsne due to dust obscuration;ccsn radio searches are thus more promising for yielding the complete,unobscured star-formation rates in the local universe. the ska yields thepossibility to piggyback for free in this area of research by carrying outcommensal, wide-field, blind transient survey observations. ska1-sur should beable to discover several hundreds of ccsne in just one year, compared to abouta dozen ccsne that the vlass would be able to detect in one year, at most. ska,with an expected sensitivity ten times that of ska1, is expected to detectccsne in the local universe by the thousands. therefore, commensal skaobservations could easily result in an essentially complete census of all ccsnein the local universe, thus yielding an accurate determination of thevolumetric ccsn rate. type ia sne: we advocate for the use of the ska to searchfor the putative prompt (~first few days after the explosion) radio emission ofany nearby type ia sn, via target-of-opportunity observations. the hugeimprovement in sensitivity of the ska with respect to its predecessors willallow to unambiguously discern which progenitor scenario (single-degenerate vs.double-degenerate) applies to them.

0804.1856	constraining the mass of the grb 030329 progenitor	the long-duration gamma-ray burst (grb) 030329, associated with supernova(sn) 2003dh, occurred inside a star-forming dwarf galaxy at redshift$z=0.1685$. the low redshift, and a rich set of archival hubble space telescope(hst) images, makes this grb well-suited for a detailed study of the stellarpopulation in the immediate vicinity of the explosion. since the lifetime of astar is directly tied to its mass, the age of the stellar population can beused to put constraints on the grb and sn progenitor mass. from the hst imageswe extract the colours of the precise site from which the grb originated, andfind that the colours are significantly different from those of the overallhost galaxy and the surrounding starburst environment. we have used spectralevolutionary models, including nebular emission, to carefully constrain the ageof the stellar population, and hence the progenitor, at the very explosionsite. for instantaneous burst models we find that a population age of 5 myrbest matches the data, suggesting a very massive (m &gt; 50 m_sun) star as theprogenitor, with an upper limit of 8 myr (m &gt; 25 m_sun). for more extended starformation scenarios, the inferred progenitor age is in most cases still veryyoung (age &lt; 7 myr, implying m &gt; 25 m_sun), with an upper limit of 20 myr (m &gt;12 m_sun). these age estimates are an order of magnitude lower than the agesinferred from the overall host galaxy colours, indicating that progenitor massestimates based on data for spatially unresolved grb host galaxies will ingeneral be of limited use. our results are consistent with the collapsarscenario.

1509.05389	supernova 2013fc in a circumnuclear ring of a luminous infrared galaxy:  the big brother of sn 1998s	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of sn 2013fc, a brighttype ii supernova (sn) in a circumnuclear star-forming ring in the luminousinfrared galaxy eso 154-g010, observed as part of the public eso spectroscopicsurvey of transient objects (pessto). sn 2013fc is both photometrically andspectroscopically similar to the well-studied type iin sn 1998s and to thebright type ii-l sn 1979c. it exhibits an initial linear decline, followed by ashort plateau phase and a tail phase with a decline too fast for $^{56}$codecay with full gamma-ray trapping. initially the spectrum was blue andfeatureless. later on, a strong broad ($\sim 8000$ km s$^{-1}$) h $\alpha$emission profile became prominent. we apply a starlight stellar populationmodel fit to the sn location (observed when the sn had faded) to estimate ahigh extinction of $a_v = 2.9 \pm 0.2$ mag and an age of $10_{-2}^{+3}$ myr forthe underlying cluster. we compare the sn to sne 1998s and 1979c and discussits possible progenitor star considering the similarities to these events. witha peak brightness of $b = -20.46 \pm 0.21$ mag, sn 2013fc is 0.9 mag brighterthan sn 1998s and of comparable brightness to sn 1979c. we suggest that sn2013fc was consistent with a massive red supergiant (rsg) progenitor. recentmass loss probably due to a strong rsg wind created the circumstellar matterilluminated through its interaction with the sn ejecta. we also observe anear-infrared excess, possibly due to newly condensed dust.

0807.0100	detection efficiency and photometry in supernova surveys - the stockholm  vimos supernova survey i	the aim of the work presented in this paper is to test and optimise supernovadetection methods based on the optimal image subtraction technique. the mainfocus is on applying the detection methods to wide field supernova imagingsurveys and in particular to the stockholm vimos supernova survey (sviss). wehave constructed a supernova detection pipeline for imaging surveys. the coreof the pipeline is image subtraction using the isis 2.2 package. using realdata from the sviss we simulate supernovae in the images, both inside andoutside galaxies. the detection pipeline is then run on the simulated framesand the effects of image quality and subtraction parameters on the detectionefficiency and photometric accuracy are studied. the pipeline allows efficientdetection of faint supernovae in the deep imaging data. it also allowscontrolling and correcting for possible systematic effects in the sn detectionand photometry. we find such a systematic effect in the form of a smallsystematic flux offset remaining at the positions of galaxies in the subtractedframes. this offset will not only affect the photometric accuracy of thesurvey, but also the detection efficiencies. our study has shown that isis 2.2works well for the sviss data. we have found that the detection efficiency andphotometric accuracy of the survey are affected by the stamp selection for theimage subtraction and by host galaxy brightness. with our tools the subtractionresults can be further optimised, any systematic effects can be controlled andphotometric errors estimated, which is very important for the sviss, as well asfor future sn searches based on large imaging surveys such as pan-starrs andlsst.

0807.3070	core-collapse supernovae in low-metallicity environments and future  all-sky transient surveys	aims: massive stars in low-metallicity environments may produce exoticexplosions such as long-duration gamma-ray bursts and pair-instabilitysupernovae when they die as core-collapse supernovae (ccsne). here we determinethe feasibility of searching for these ccsne in metal-poor dwarf galaxies usingvarious survey strategies. methods: we determine oxygen abundances andstar-formation rates for all spectroscopically typed star-forming galaxies inthe sloan digital sky survey, data release 5, within z = 0.04. we then estimatethe ccsn rates for sub-samples of galaxies with differing upper-metallicitylimits. using monte-carlo simulations we then predict the fraction of theseccsne that we can expect to detect using different survey strategies. results:using a single 2m telescope (with a standard ccd camera) search we predict adetection rate of ~1.3 ccsne/yr in galaxies with metallicities below 12 +log(o/h) &lt; 8.2 which are within a volume that will allow detailed follow-upwith 4m and 8m telescopes (z = 0.04). with a network of seven 2m telescopes weestimate ~9.3 ccsne/yr could be found, although this would require more than1,000 hrs of telescope time allocated to the network. within the same radialdistance, a volume-limited search in the future pan-starrs ps1 all-sky surveyshould uncover 12.5 ccsne/yr in low-metallicity galaxies. over a period of afew years this would allow a detailed comparison of their properties. we thenextend our calculations to determine the total numbers of ccsne that canpotentially be found in magnitude-limited surveys with ps1 (24,000/yr, within z&lt; 0.6), ps4 (69,000/yr, within z &lt; 0.8) and lsst (160,000/yr, within z &lt; 0.9)surveys.

astro-ph;0011417	supernovae in the nuclear regions of starburst galaxies	the feasibility of using near-infrared observations to discover supernovae inthe nuclear and circumnuclear regions of nearby starburst galaxies isinvestigated. we provide updated estimates of the intrinsic core-collapsesupernova rates in these regions. we discuss the problem of extinction, andpresent new estimates of the extinction towards 33 supernova remnants in thestarburst galaxy m 82. this is done using h i and h_2 column densitymeasurements. we estimate the molecular to atomic hydrogen mass ratio to be 7.4+- 1.0 in m 82. we have assembled near-infrared photometric data for a total of13 core-collapse supernovae, some unpublished hitherto. this constitutes thelargest database of ir light curves for such events. we show that the ir lightcurves fall into two classes, ``ordinary'' and ``slow-declining''. templatejhkl light curves are derived for both classes. for ordinary core-collapsesupernovae, the average peak jhkl absolute magnitudes are -18.4, -18.6, -18.6,and -19.0 respectively. the slow-declining core-collapse sne are found to besignificantly more luminous than the ordinary events, even at early times,having average peak jhkl absolute magnitudes of -19.9, -20.0, -20.0, and -20.4respectively. we investigate the efficiency of a computerised image subtractionmethod in supernova detection. we then carry out a monte carlo simulation of asupernova search using k-band images of ngc 5962. the effects of extinction andobserving strategy are discussed. we conclude that a modest observationalprogramme will be able to discover a number of nuclear supernovae.

astro-ph;0208059	the host galaxies of type ia supernovae at z=0.6	we examine the host galaxies of high redshift type ia supernovae (sne ia)using archival i and r band data from the hubble space telescope. the sne iahost galaxies show a wide variety of morphologies, including undisturbedellipticals, spirals and disturbed systems. sne ia are also found over a widerange of projected distances from the host galaxy centres, ranging from 3kpc to30kpc. for a sample of 22 sne ia at &lt;z&gt; = 0.6, 70% are found in spiral galaxiesand 30% are found in elliptical systems, similar to the proportions observedlocally. including additional previously published data, we find no significantdifference in the average light-curve-shape-corrected peak b band magnitudesfor high-z sne ia between spirals and ellipticals. these results are consistentwith predictions based on the locally-derived understanding of sne ia physicsand the influence of progenitor mass and metallicity. we also construct colourmaps for two host galaxies and find that both show a non-uniform colourstructure with typical variations of rest-frame b-v~0.5. this is most plausiblyattributed to the presence of, and variation in dust extinction in thesegalaxies. moreover, we find no evidence that the sne ia are preferentiallyfound in outer regions (&gt;10kpc) of the host galaxies where extinction would below. this suggests that the range of host galaxy extinctions of sne ia at z~0.6should be comparable to those of local sne ia. although observational biascannot be completely ruled out, this appears to be in conflict with the findingof low extinction for sne ia found in the high-z supernova search studies.

astro-ph;0502531	high-velocity features: a ubiquitous property of type ia sne	evidence of high-velocity features such as those seen in the near-maximumspectra of some type ia supernovae (eg sn 2000cx) has been searched for in theavailable snia spectra observed earlier than one week before b maximum. recentobservational efforts have doubled the number of sneia with very early spectra.remarkably, all sneia with early data (7 in our rtn sample and 10 from otherprogrammes) show signs of such features, to a greater or lesser degree, in caiiir, and some also in siii 6255a line. high-velocity features may be interpretedas abundance or density enhancements. abundance enhancements would imply anouter region dominated by si and ca. density enhancements may result from thesweeping up of circumstellar material by the highest velocity sn ejecta. inthis scenario, the high incidence of hvfs suggests that a thick disc and/or ahigh-density companion wind surrounds the exploding white dwarf, as may be thecase in single degenerate systems. large-scale angular fluctuations in theradial density and abundance distribution may also be responsible: this couldoriginate in the explosion, and would suggest a deflagration as the more likelyexplosion mechanism. csm-interaction and surface fluctuations may coexist,possibly leaving different signatures on the spectrum. in some sne the hvfs arenarrowly confined in velocity, suggesting the ejection of blobs of burnedmaterial.
