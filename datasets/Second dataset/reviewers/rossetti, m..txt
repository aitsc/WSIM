0910.4900	cool core remnants in galaxy clusters	x ray clusters are conventionally divided into two classes: "cool core" (cc)and "non cool core" (ncc) objects, on the basis of the observational propertiesof their central regions. recent results have shown that the cluster populationis bimodal (cavagnolo et al. 2009). we want to understand whether the observeddistribution of clusters is due to a primordial division into two distinctclasses rather than to differences in how these systems evolve across cosmictime. we systematically search the icm of ncc clusters in a subsample of theb55 flux limited sample of clusters for regions which have some characteristicstypical of cool cores, namely low entropy gas and high metal abundance we findthat most ncc clusters in our sample host regions reminiscent of cc, i. e.characterized by relative low entropy gas (albeit not as low as in cc systems)and a metal abundance excess. we have dubbed these structures "cool coreremnants", since we interpret them as what remains of a cool core after aheating event (agn giant outbursts in a few cases and more commonly mergers).we infer that most ncc clusters have undergone a cool core phase during theirlife. the fact that most cool core remnants are found in dynamically activeobjects provides strong support to scenarios where cluster core properties arenot fixed "ab initio" but evolve across cosmic time.

1009.3266	mass profiles and concentration-dark matter relation in x-ray luminous  galaxy clusters	(abriged) assuming that the hydrostatic equilibrium holds between theintracluster medium and the gravitational potential, we constrain the nfwprofiles in a sample of 44 x-ray luminous galaxy clusters observed withxmm-newton in the redshift range 0.1-0.3. we evaluate several systematicuncertainties that affect our reconstruction of the x-ray masses. we measurethe concentration c200, the dark mass m200 and the gas mass fraction withinr500 in all the objects of our sample, providing the largest dataset of massparameters for galaxy clusters in this redshift range. we confirm that a tightcorrelation between c200 and m200 is present and in good agreement with thepredictions from numerical simulations and previous observations. when weconsider a subsample of relaxed clusters that host a low-entropy-core (lec), wemeasure a flatter c-m relation with a total scatter that is lower by 40 percent. from the distribution of the estimates of c200 and m200, with associatedstatistical (15-25%) and systematic (5-15%) errors, we use the predicted valuesfrom semi-analytic prescriptions calibrated through n-body numerical runs andmeasure sigma_8*omega_m^(0.60+-0.03)= 0.45+-0.01 (at 2 sigma level, statisticalonly) for the subsample of the clusters where the mass reconstruction has beenobtained more robustly, and sigma_8*omega_m^(0.56+-0.04) = 0.39+-0.02 for thesubsample of the 11 more relaxed lec objects. with the further constraint fromthe fgas distribution in our sample, we break the degeneracy in thesigma_8-omega_m plane and obtain the best-fit values sigma_8~1.0+-0.2(0.75+-0.18 when the subsample of the more relaxed objects is considered) andomega_m = 0.26+-0.01.

1103.0679	internal dynamics of the galaxy cluster abell 545	diffuse radio emission in galaxy clusters, and their connection with clustermergers, are still debated. we seek to explore the internal dynamics of theradio halo cluster abell 545. this cluster is also peculiar for hosting in itscenter a very bright, red, diffuse intracluster light due to an old, stellarpopulation, so bright to be named as "star pile". our analysis is based onredshift data for 110 galaxies. we identify 95 cluster members and analyze thecluster internal dynamics by combining galaxy velocities and positions. we alsouse both photometric and x-ray data. we estimate the cluster redshift,z=0.1580, a velocity dispersion of 1200 km/s, and icm temperature kt_x~8 kev.our optical and x-ray analyses detect substructures. optical data reveal threemain galaxy clumps (center, nnw, and ne), and possibly a fourth clump at south.there is not a dominant galaxy and the four brightest galaxies avoid thecluster core (&gt;~0.4h distant from the cluster center) and are &gt;~1500 km/s farfrom the mean cluster velocity. the analysis of the x-ray surface brightnessdistribution provides us evidence of a disturbed dynamical phase. located inthe star pile region there is the brightest galaxies of the cluster core (cbcg)and a very compact elliptical galaxy. we show that the star pile has a similarredshift to that of the cbcg. both the star pile and the cbcg are at rest inthe cluster rest frame. the emerging picture of abell 545 is that of a massive,m(r&lt;1.6 h_70^-1 mpc)=1.1-1.8x10^15 h_70^-1 msun, very complex cluster withmerging occurring along two directions. a545 gives another proof in the favorof the connection between cluster merger and extended, diffuse radio emission.the star pile, likely due to the process of a brightest galaxy forming in thecluster core. a545 represents a textbook cluster where to study thesimultaneous formation of a galaxy system and its brightest galaxy.

1103.2455	x-ray observations of pks 0745-191 at the virial radius: are we there  yet?	we wish to reassess the properties of the icm at large radii in the galaxycluster pks 0745-191 in light of the recent suzaku measurements. we analyze anarchival 10.5 ksec rosat/pspc observation to extract the surface-brightnessprofile of pks 0745-191 and infer the deprojected density profile. we thencompare the rosat surface-brightness profile with the suzaku result. we performa mass analysis combining the rosat density profile and the publishedtemperature profiles from different instruments. we find that the rosatsurface-brightness profile is statistically inconsistent (7.7 sigma) with thesuzaku result around and beyond the value of r200 estimated by suzaku. we arguethat, thanks to its large field of view and low background, rosat/pspc is tothe present day the most sensitive instrument to low surface-brightness x-rayemission in the 0.4-2.0 kev band. we also note that the suzaku temperature andmass profiles are at odds with the results from at least two other satellites(xmm-newton and swift). the difference in surface brightness between rosat andsuzaku is most likely explained by the existence of additional foregroundcomponents at the low galactic latitude of the source, which were not takeninto account in the suzaku background modeling. in light of our mass analysis,we conclude that any estimate of the fraction of the virial radius reached byx-ray measures is affected by systematic errors of the order of 25%. as aresult, the properties of the icm at the virial radius are still uncertain, andthe suzaku results should be considered with caution.

1106.4563	back and forth from cool core to non-cool core: clues from radio-halos	x-ray astronomers often divide galaxy clusters into two classes: "cool core"(cc) and "non-cool core" (ncc) objects. the origin of this dichotomy has beenthe subject of debate in recent years, between "evolutionary" models (whereclusters can evolve from cc to ncc, mainly through mergers) and "primordial"models (where the state of the cluster is fixed "ab initio" by early mergers orpre-heating). we found that in a well-defined sample (clusters in the gmrtradio halo survey with available chandra or xmm-newton data), none of theobjects hosting a giant radio halo can be classified as a cool core. thisresult suggests that the main mechanisms which can start a large scalesynchrotron emission (most likely mergers) are the same that can destroy cc andtherefore strongly supports "evolutionary" models of the cc-ncc dichotomy.moreover combining the number of objects in the cc and ncc state with thenumber of objects with and without a radio-halo, we estimated that the timescale over which a ncc cluster relaxes to the cc state, should be larger thanthe typical life-time of radio-halos and likely shorter than about 3 gyr. thissuggests that ncc transform into cc more rapidly than predicted from thecooling time, which is about 10 gyr in ncc systems, allowing the possibility ofa cyclical evolution between the cc and ncc states.

1111.0020	the gas distribution in the outer regions of galaxy clusters	we present the analysis of a local (z = 0.04 - 0.2) sample of 31 galaxyclusters with the aim of measuring the density of the x-ray emitting gas incluster outskirts. we compare our results with numerical simulations to setconstraints on the azimuthal symmetry and gas clumping in the outer regions ofgalaxy clusters. we exploit the large field-of-view and low instrumentalbackground of rosat/pspc to trace the density of the intracluster gas out tothe virial radius. we perform a stacking of the density profiles to detect asignal beyond r200 and measure the typical density and scatter in clusteroutskirts. we also compute the azimuthal scatter of the profiles with respectto the mean value to look for deviations from spherical symmetry. finally, wecompare our average density and scatter profiles with the results of numericalsimulations. as opposed to some recent suzaku results, and confirming previousevidence from rosat and chandra, we observe a steepening of the densityprofiles beyond \sim r500. comparing our density profiles with simulations, wefind that non-radiative runs predict too steep density profiles, whereas runsincluding additional physics and/or treating gas clumping are in betteragreement with the observed gas distribution. we report for the first time thehigh-confidence detection of a systematic difference between cool-core andnon-cool core clusters beyond \sim 0.3r200, which we explain by a differentdistribution of the gas in the two classes. beyond \sim r500, galaxy clustersdeviate significantly from spherical symmetry, with only little differencesbetween relaxed and disturbed systems. we find good agreement between theobserved and predicted scatter profiles, but only when the 1% densest clumpsare filtered out in the simulations.

1204.1318	planck intermediate results ii: comparison of sunyaev-zeldovich  measurements from planck and from the arcminute microkelvin imager for 11  galaxy clusters	a comparison is presented of sunyaev-zeldovich measurements for 11 galaxyclusters as obtained by planck and by the ground-based interferometer, thearcminute microkelvin imager. assuming a universal spherically-symmetricgeneralised navarro, frenk &amp; white (gnfw) model for the cluster gas pressureprofile, we jointly constrain the integrated compton-y parameter (y_500) andthe scale radius (theta_500) of each cluster. our resulting constraints in they_500-theta_500 2d parameter space derived from the two instruments overlapsignificantly for eight of the clusters, although, overall, there is a tendencyfor ami to find the sunyaev-zeldovich signal to be smaller in angular size andfainter than planck. significant discrepancies exist for the three remainingclusters in the sample, namely a1413, a1914, and the newly-discovered planckcluster plckesz g139.59+24.18. the robustness of the analysis of both theplanck and ami data is demonstrated through the use of detailed simulations,which also discount confusion from residual point (radio) sources and fromdiffuse astrophysical foregrounds as possible explanations for thediscrepancies found. for a subset of our cluster sample, we have investigatedthe dependence of our results on the assumed pressure profile by repeating theanalysis adopting the best-fitting gnfw profile shape which best matches x-rayobservations. adopting the best-fitting profile shape from the x-ray data doesnot, in general, resolve the discrepancies found in this subset of fiveclusters. though based on a small sample, our results suggest that the adoptedgnfw model may not be sufficiently flexible to describe clusters universally.

1204.2743	planck intermediate results. iii. the relation between galaxy cluster  mass and sunyaev-zeldovich signal	we examine the relation between the galaxy cluster mass m andsunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect signal d_a^2 y for a sample of 19 objects forwhich weak lensing (wl) mass measurements obtained from subaru telescope dataare available in the literature. hydrostatic x-ray masses are derived fromxmm-newton archive data and the sz effect signal is measured from planckall-sky survey data. we find an m_wl-d_a^2 y relation that is consistent inslope and normalisation with previous determinations using weak lensing masses;however, there is a normalisation offset with respect to previous measuresbased on hydrostatic x-ray mass-proxy relations. we verify that our sz effectmeasurements are in excellent agreement with previous determinations fromplanck data. for the present sample, the hydrostatic x-ray masses at r_500 areon average ~ 20 per cent larger than the corresponding weak lensing masses, atodds with expectations. we show that the mass discrepancy is driven by adifference in mass concentration as measured by the two methods, and, for thepresent sample, the mass discrepancy and difference in mass concentration isespecially large for disturbed systems. the mass discrepancy is also linked tothe offset in centres used by the x-ray and weak lensing analyses, which againis most important in disturbed systems. we outline several approaches that areneeded to help achieve convergence in cluster mass measurement with x-ray andweak lensing observations.

1207.4061	planck intermediate results. v. pressure profiles of galaxy clusters  from the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	taking advantage of the all-sky coverage and broad frequency range of theplanck satellite, we study the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) and pressure profiles of62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-monthnominal survey. careful reconstruction of the sz signal indicates that mostclusters are individually detected at least out to r500. by stacking the radialprofiles, we have statistically detected the radial sz signal out to 3 x r500,i.e., at a density contrast of about 50-100, though the dispersion about themean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range.our measurement is fully consistent with previous planck results on integratedsz fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between sz and x-raymeasurements inside r500. correcting for the effects of the planck beam, wehave calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. this new constraint fromsz measurements is consistent with the x-ray constraints from xmm-newton in theregion in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1-1]r500), and is in fairly goodagreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. atlarger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than mostpredictions from numerical simulations. combining the sz and x-ray observedprofiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fitparameters [p0, c500, gamma, alpha, beta] = [6.41, 1.81, 0.31, 1.33, 4.13].using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirtswe reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profileout to 3 x r500. within the temperature driven uncertainties, our planckconstraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gasfraction in halos.

1208.3611	planck intermediate results. x. physics of the hot gas in the coma  cluster	we present an analysis of planck satellite data on the coma cluster observedvia the sunyaev-zeldovich effect. planck is able, for the first time, to detectsz emission up to r ~ 3 x r_500. we test previously proposed models for thepressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. wefind that the arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit coma, andthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the dataonly at r&lt;r_500: by r=2xr_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by afactor of ~2. this may indicate that at these larger radii either i) thecluster sz emission is contaminated by unresolved sz sources along the line ofsight or ii) the pressure profile of coma is higher at r&gt;r_500 than the meanpressure profile predicted by the simulations. the planck image showssignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half adegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. these featuresare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed thewestern feature was previously noticed in the rosat pspc mosaic as well as inthe radio. using planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we findpressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,respectively. assuming rankine-hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deducethat the shock waves should propagate with mach number m_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 andm_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the west and southeast, respectively. finally, we findthat the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on mpcscales with small intrinsic scatter. this implies either that the energydensity of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster,or that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius thanpreviously thought.

1208.5911	planck intermediate results. viii. filaments between interacting  clusters	about half of the baryons of the universe are expected to be in the form offilaments of hot and low density intergalactic medium. most of these baryonsremain undetected even by the most advanced x-ray observatories which arelimited in sensitivity to the diffuse low density medium. the planck satellitehas provided hundreds of detections of the hot gas in clusters of galaxies viathe thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich (tsz) effect and is an ideal instrument forstudying extended low density media through the tsz effect. in this paper weuse the planck data to search for signatures of a fraction of these missingbaryons between pairs of galaxy clusters. cluster pairs are good candidates forsearching for the hotter and denser phase of the intergalactic medium (which ismore easily observed through the sz effect). using an x-ray catalogue ofclusters and the planck data, we select physical pairs of clusters ascandidates. using the planck data we construct a local map of the tsz effectcentered on each pair of galaxy clusters. rosat data is used to construct x-raymaps of these pairs. after having modelled and subtracted the tsz effect andx-ray emission for each cluster in the pair we study the residuals on both thesz and x-ray maps. for the merging cluster pair a399-a401 we observe asignificant tsz effect signal in the intercluster region beyond the virialradii of the clusters. a joint x-ray sz analysis allows us to constrain thetemperature and density of this intercluster medium. we obtain a temperature ofkt = 7.1 +- 0.9, kev (consistent with previous estimates) and a baryon densityof (3.7 +- 0.2)x10^-4, cm^-3. the planck satellite mission has provided thefirst sz detection of the hot and diffuse intercluster gas.

1212.4131	planck intermediate results. xi: the gas content of dark matter halos:  the sunyaev-zeldovich-stellar mass relation for locally brightest galaxies	we present the scaling relation between sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal andstellar mass for almost 260,000 locally brightest galaxies (lbgs) selected fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). these are predominantly the centralgalaxies of their dark matter halos. we calibrate the stellar-to-halo massconversion using realistic mock catalogues based on the millennium simulation.applying a multi-frequency matched filter to the planck data for each lbg, andaveraging the results in bins of stellar mass, we measure the mean sz signaldown to $m_\ast\sim 2\times 10^{11} \msolar$, with a clear indication of signalat even lower stellar mass. we derive the scaling relation between sz signaland halo mass by assigning halo properties from our mock catalogues to the reallbgs and simulating the planck observation process. this relation shows noevidence for deviation from a power law over a halo mass range extending fromrich clusters down to $m_{500}\sim 2\times 10^{13} \msolar$, and there is aclear indication of signal down to $m_{500}\sim 4\times 10^{12} \msolar$.planck's sz detections in such low-mass halos imply that about a quarter of allbaryons have now been seen in the form of hot halo gas, and that this gas mustbe less concentrated than the dark matter in such halos in order to remainconsistent with x-ray observations. at the high-mass end, the measured szsignal is 20% lower than found from observations of x-ray clusters, adifference consistent with malmquist bias effects in the x-ray sample.

1303.5066	planck 2013 results. v. lfi calibration	we discuss the methods employed to photometrically calibrate the dataacquired by the low frequency instrument on planck. our calibration is based ona combination of the orbital dipole plus the solar dipole, caused respectivelyby the motion of the planck spacecraft with respect to the sun and by motion ofthe solar system with respect to the cmb rest frame. the latter provides asignal of a few mk with the same spectrum as the cmb anisotropies and isvisible throughout the mission. in this data release we rely on thecharacterization of the solar dipole as measured by wmap. we also presentpreliminary results (at 44ghz only) on the study of the orbital dipole, whichagree with the wmap value of the solar system speed within our uncertainties.we compute the calibration constant for each radiometer roughly once per hour,in order to keep track of changes in the detectors' gain. since non-idealitiesin the optical response of the beams proved to be important, we implemented afast convolution algorithm which considers the full beam response in estimatingthe signal generated by the dipole. moreover, in order to further reduce theimpact of residual systematics due to sidelobes, we estimated time variationsin the calibration constant of the 30ghz radiometers (the ones with the largestsidelobes) using the signal of a reference load. we have estimated thecalibration accuracy in two ways: we have run a set of simulations to assessthe impact of statistical errors and systematic effects in the instrument andin the calibration procedure, and we have performed a number of consistencychecks on the data and on the brightness temperature of jupiter. calibrationerrors for this data release are expected to be about 0.6% at 44 and 70 ghz,and 0.8% at 30 ghz.

1303.5081	planck 2013 results. xxi. all-sky compton parameter power spectrum and  high-order statistics	we have constructed the first all-sky map of the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich(tsz) effect by applying specifically tailored component separation algorithmsto the 100 to 857 ghz frequency channel maps from the planck survey. these mapsshow an obvious galaxy cluster tsz signal that is well matched with blindlydetected clusters in the planck sz catalogue. to characterize the signal in thetsz map we have computed its angular power spectrum.  at large angular scales ($\ell &lt; 60$), the major foreground contaminant isthe diffuse thermal dust emission. at small angular scales ($\ell &gt; 500$) theclustered cosmic infrared background (cib) and residual point sources are themajor contaminants.  these foregrounds are carefully modelled and subtracted.  we measure the tsz power spectrum in angular scales, $0.17^{\circ} \lesssim\theta \lesssim 3.0^{\circ}$, that were previously unexplored. the measured tszpower spectrum is consistent with that expected from the planck catalogue of szsources, with additional clear evidence of signal from unresolved clusters and,potentially, diffuse warm baryons.  we use the tsz power spectrum to obtain the following cosmologicalconstraints:  $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.28)^{3.2/8.1}=0.784 \pm 0.016 (68% c.l.).  marginalized band-powers of the planck tsz power spectrum and the best-fitmodel are given.  the non-gaussianity of the compton parameter map is further characterized bycomputing its 1d probability distribution function and its bispectrum. theseare used to place additional independent constraints on $\sigma_{8}$.

1304.5478	sloshing cold fronts in galaxy groups and their perturbing disk  galaxies: an x-ray, optical and radio case study	we present a combined x-ray, optical, and radio analysis of the galaxy groupic 1860 using the currently available chandra and xmm data, literaturemulti-object spectroscopy data and gmrt data. the chandra and xmm imaging andspectroscopy reveal two surface brightness discontinuities at 45 and 76 kpcshown to be consistent with a pair of cold fronts. these features areinterpreted as due to sloshing of the central gas induced by an off-axis minormerger with a perturber. this scenario is further supported by the presence ofa peculiar velocity of the central galaxy ic 1860 and the identification of apossible perturber in the optically disturbed spiral galaxy ic 1859. theidentification of the perturber is consistent with the comparison withnumerical simulations of sloshing. the gmrt observation at 325 mhz shows faint,extended radio emission contained within the inner cold front, as seen in somegalaxy clusters hosting diffuse radio mini-halos. however, unlike mini-halos,no particle reacceleration is needed to explain the extended radio emission,which is consistent with aged radio plasma redistributed by the sloshing. thereis strong analogy of the x-ray and optical phenomenology of the ic 1860 groupwith two other groups, ngc 5044 and ngc 5846, showing cold fronts. the evidencepresented in this paper is among the strongest supporting the currently favoredmodel of cold-front formation in relaxed objects and establishes the groupscale as a chief environment to study this phenomenon.

1306.2322	the hot and energetic universe: the astrophysics of galaxy groups and  clusters	as the nodes of the cosmic web, clusters of galaxies trace the large-scaledistribution of matter in the universe. they are thus privileged sites in whichto investigate the complex physics of structure formation. however, thecomplete story of how these structures grow, and how they dissipate thegravitational and non-thermal components of their energy budget over cosmictime, is still beyond our grasp. fundamental questions such as how do hotdiffuse baryons accrete and dynamically evolve in dark matter potentials? howand when was the energy that we observe in the icm generated and distributed?where and when are heavy elements produced and how are they circulated? arestill unanswered. most of the cluster baryons exists in the form of a diffuse,hot, metal-enriched plasma that radiates primarily in the x-ray band (theintracluster medium, icm), allowing the x-ray observations of the evolvingcluster population to provide a unique opportunity to address these topics.athena+ with its large collecting area and unprecedented combination of highspectral and angular resolution offers the only way to make major advances inanswering these questions. athena+ will show how the baryonic gas evolves inthe dark matter potential wells by studying the motions and turbulence in theicm. athena+ will be able to resolve the accreting region both spatially andspectroscopically, probing the true nature and physical state of the x-rayemitting plasma. athena+ has the capabilities to permit a definitiveunderstanding of the formation and evolution of large-scale cosmic structurethrough the study of the cluster population.

1308.0992	radio emission at the centre of the galaxy cluster abell 3560: evidence  for core sloshing?	previous radio observations of the galaxy cluster a3560 in the shapleyconcentration showed complex radio emission associated with the brightestcluster member.to understand its origin we observed it with the gmrt, the vlaand atca at 240 and 610 mhz, 1.28,1.4, 2.3,4.8 and 8.4 ghz, and performed adetailed morphological and spectral study of the radio emission associated withthe bcg. we also observed the cluster with xmm-newton and chandra to derive theproperties of the icm. the radio emission of the n-e nucleus of the dumb-bellbcg shows an active radio galaxy, plus aged diffuse emission, which is notrefurbished at present. our chandra data show that the radio active nucleus ofthe bcg has extended x-ray emission, which we classify as a low-luminositycorona. a residual image of the xmm-newton brightness shows the presence of aspiral-like feature, which we interpret as the signature of gas sloshing. thepresence of a subgroup is clear in the surface brightness residual map, and inthe xmm-newton temperature analysis. the optical 2d analysis shows substructurein a3560. a galaxy clump was found at the location of the x-ray subgroup, andanother group is present south of the cluster core, close to the spiral-likefeature. the aged part of the radio emission closely follows the spiral patternof the x-ray residual brightness distribution, while the two active radio lobesare bent in a completely different direction. we conclude that the complexradio emission associated with the cluster bcg is the result of a minor mergerevent in a3560. the aged diffuse emission is strongly affected by the sloshingmotion in the icm. on the other hand, the bent jets and lobes of the currentradio agn activity may reflect a complex gas velocity field in the innermostcluster regions and/or sloshing-induced oscillations in the motion of the cdgalaxy.

1310.8389	gas clumping in galaxy clusters	the reconstruction of galaxy cluster's gas density profiles is usuallyperformed by assuming spherical symmetry and averaging the observed x-rayemission in circular annuli. in the case of a very inhomogeneous and asymmetricgas distribution, this method has been shown to return biased results innumerical simulations because of the $n^2$ dependence of the x-ray emissivity.we propose a method to recover the true density profiles in the presence ofinhomogeneities, based on the derivation of the azimuthal median of the surfacebrightness in concentric annuli. we demonstrate the performance of this methodwith numerical simulations, and apply it to a sample of 31 galaxy clusters inthe redshift range 0.04-0.2 observed with rosat/pspc. the clumping factorsrecovered by comparing the mean and the median are mild and show a slight trendof increasing bias with radius. for $r&lt;r_{500}$, we measure a clumping factor$\sqrt{c}&lt;1.1$, which indicates that the thermodynamic properties andhydrostatic masses measured in this radial range are only mildly affected bythis effect. comparing our results with three sets of hydrodynamical numericalsimulations, we found that non-radiative simulations significantly overestimatethe level of inhomogeneities in the icm, while the runs including cooling, starformation, and agn feedback reproduce the observed trends closely. our resultsindicate that most of the accretion of x-ray emitting gas is taking place inthe diffuse, large-scale accretion patterns rather than in compact structures.

1405.4707	the structure of abell 1351: a bimodal galaxy cluster with peculiar  diffuse radio emission	we aim to review the internal structure and dynamics of the abell 1351cluster, shown to host a radio halo with a quite irregular shape. our analysisis based on radial velocity data for 135 galaxies obtained at the telescopionazionale galileo. we combine galaxy velocities and positions to select 95cluster galaxy members and analyse the internal dynamics of the whole cluster.we also examine x-ray data retrieved from chandra and xmm archives. we measurethe cluster redshift, &lt;z&gt;=0.325, the line-of-sight (los) velocity dispersion,\sigma_v~1500 km/s, and the x-ray temperature, kt~9 kev. from both x-ray andoptical data independently, we estimate a large cluster mass, in the 1--4$10^{15}$ m$_\odot$ range. we attribute the extremely high value of \sigma_v tothe bimodality in the velocity distribution. we find evidence of a significantvelocity gradient and optical 3d substructure. the x-ray analysis also showsmany features in favour of a complex cluster structure, probably supporting anongoing merger of substructures in abell 1351. the observational scenarioagrees with the presence of two main subclusters in the northern region, eachwith its brightest galaxy (bcg1 and bcg2), detected as the two most importantx-ray substructures with a rest-frame los velocity difference of \delta v~2500km/s (in the rest frame) and probably being in large part aligned with the los.we conclude that abell 1351 is a massive merging cluster. the details of thecluster structure allow us to interpret the quite asymmetric radio halo as a`normal' halo plus a southern relic, strongly supporting a previous suggestionbased only on inspection of radio and preliminary x-ray data.

1407.5452	planck intermediate results. xxv. the andromeda galaxy as seen by planck	the andromeda galaxy (m31) is one of a few galaxies that has sufficientangular size on the sky to be resolved by the planck satellite. planck hasdetected m31 in all of its frequency bands, and has mapped out the dustemission with the high frequency instrument, clearly resolving multiple spiralarms and sub-features. we examine the morphology of this long-wavelength dustemission as seen by planck, including a study of its outermost spiral arms, andinvestigate the dust heating mechanism across m31. we find that dust dominatingthe longer wavelength emission ($\gtrsim 0.3\,$mm) is heated by the diffusestellar population (as traced by 3.6$\,\mu$m emission), with the dustdominating the shorter wavelength emission heated by a mix of the old stellarpopulation and star-forming regions (as traced by 24$\,\mu$m emission). we alsofit spectral energy distributions (seds) for individual 5' pixels and quantifythe dust properties across the galaxy, taking into account these differentheating mechanisms, finding that there is a linear decrease in temperature withgalactocentric distance for dust heated by the old stellar population, as wouldbe expected, with temperatures ranging from around 22$\,$k in the nucleus to14$\,$k outside of the 10$\,$kpc ring. finally, we measure the integratedspectrum of the whole galaxy, which we find to be well-fitted with a globaldust temperature of ($18.2\pm1.0$)$\,$k with a spectral index of $1.62\pm0.11$(assuming a single modified blackbody), and a significant amount of free-freeemission at intermediate frequencies of 20-60$\,$ghz, which corresponds to astar formation rate of around $0.12$m$_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. we find a$2.3\,\sigma$ detection of the presence of spinning dust emission, with a30$\,$ghz amplitude of $0.7\pm0.3\,$jy, which is in line with expectations fromour galaxy.

1408.1394	the stripping of a galaxy group diving into the massive cluster a2142	structure formation in the current universe operates through the accretion ofgroup-scale systems onto massive clusters. the detection and study of suchaccreting systems is crucial to understand the build-up of the most massivevirialized structures we see today. we report the discovery with xmm-newton ofan irregular x-ray substructure in the outskirts of the massive galaxy clusterabell 2142. the tip of the x-ray emission coincides with a concentration ofgalaxies. the bulk of the x-ray emission of this substructure appears to belagging behind the galaxies and extends over a projected scale of at least 800kpc. the temperature of the gas in this region is 1.4 kev, which is a factor of~4 lower than the surrounding medium and is typical of the virialized plasma ofa galaxy group with a mass of a few 10^13m_sun. for this reason, we interpretthis structure as a galaxy group in the process of being accreted onto the maindark-matter halo. the x-ray structure trailing behind the group is due to gasstripped from its original dark-matter halo as it moves through theintracluster medium (icm). this is the longest x-ray trail reported to date.for an infall velocity of ~1,200 km s-1 we estimate that the stripped gas hasbeen surviving in the presence of the hot icm for at least 600 myr, whichexceeds the spitzer conduction timescale in the medium by a factor of &gt;~400.such a strong suppression of conductivity is likely related to a tangledmagnetic field with small coherence length and to plasma microinstabilities.the long survival time of the low-entropy intragroup medium suggests that theinfalling material can eventually settle within the core of the main cluster.

1409.5738	planck intermediate results. xxx. the angular power spectrum of  polarized dust emission at intermediate and high galactic latitudes	the polarized thermal emission from galactic dust is the main foregroundpresent in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) at frequencies above 100ghz. we exploit the planck hfi polarization datafrom 100 to 353ghz to measure the dust angular power spectra $c_\ell^{ee,bb}$over the range $40&lt;\ell&lt;600$ well away from the galactic plane. these willbring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determinationof the level of contamination for cmb polarization experiments. we show thatstatistical properties of the emission can be characterized over largefractions of the sky using $c_\ell$. for the dust, they are well described bypower laws in $\ell$ with exponents $\alpha^{ee,bb}=-2.42\pm0.02$. theamplitudes of the polarization $c_\ell$ vary with the average brightness in away similar to the intensity ones. the dust polarization frequency dependenceis consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\beta_d=1.59$ and$t_d=19.6$k. we find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the galactic$b$- and $e$-modes of 0.5. we show that even in the faintest dust-emittingregions there are no "clean" windows where primordial cmb $b$-mode polarizationcould be measured without subtraction of dust emission. finally, we investigatethe level of dust polarization in the bicep2 experiment field. extrapolation ofthe planck 353ghz data to 150ghz gives a dust power$\ell(\ell+1)c_\ell^{bb}/(2\pi)$ of $1.32\times10^{-2}\mu$k$_{cmb}^2$ over the$40&lt;\ell&lt;120$ range; the statistical uncertainty is $\pm0.29$ and there is anadditional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the sameunits. this is the same magnitude as reported by bicep2 over this $\ell$ range,which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal even inthe cleanest windows of the sky.

1501.00922	planck intermediate results. xxxiv. the magnetic field structure in the  rosette nebula	planck has mapped the polarized dust emission over the whole sky, making itpossible to trace the galactic magnetic field structure that pervades theinterstellar medium (ism). we combine polarization data from planck withrotation measure (rm) observations towards a massive star-forming region, therosette nebula in the monoceros molecular cloud, to study its magnetic fieldstructure and the impact of an expanding hii region on the morphology of thefield. we derive an analytical solution for the magnetic field, assumed toevolve from an initially uniform configuration following the expansion ofionized gas and the formation of a shell of swept-up ism. from the rm data weestimate a mean value of the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field ofabout 3microg (towards the observer) in the rosette nebula, for a uniformelectron density of about 12cm-3. the dust shell that surrounds the rosette hiiregion is clearly observed in the planck intensity map at 353 ghz, with apolarization signal significantly different from that of the local backgroundwhen considered as a whole. the planck observations constrain theplane-of-the-sky orientation of the magnetic field in the rosette's parentmolecular cloud to be mostly aligned with the large-scale field along thegalactic plane. the planck data are compared with the analytical model, whichpredicts the mean polarization properties of a spherical and uniform dust shellfor a given orientation of the field. this comparison leads to an upper limitof about 45degr on the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic fieldin the rosette complex, for an assumed intrinsic dust polarization fraction of4%. this field direction can reproduce the rm values detected in the ionizedregion if the magnetic field strength in the monoceros molecular cloud is inthe range 6.5--9microg.

1502.01588	planck 2015 results. x. diffuse component separation: foreground maps	planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and857 ghz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 ghz in polarization.in this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical componentseparation, and process these maps within a bayesian framework to derive aconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. for the temperatureanalysis, we combine the planck observations with the 9-year wmap sky maps andthe haslam et al. 408 mhz map to derive a joint model of cmb, synchrotron,free-free, spinning dust, co, line emission in the 94 and 100 ghz channels, andthermal dust emission. full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutionsvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the skymodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. for polarization, the model includescmb, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. these models provide excellentfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 ukover 93% of the sky for all planck frequencies up to 353 ghz, and fractionalerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. the main limitations ofthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among thespinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observationsfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. themain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies areuncertainties in the 545 and 857 ghz calibration and zero-points. forpolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the100-353 ghz bands on large angular scales in the form oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digitalconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expectedto improve in the near future.

1502.01595	planck 2015 results. xxi. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	this paper presents a study of the isw effect from the planck 2015temperature and polarization data release. the cmb is cross-correlated withdifferent lss tracers: the nvss, sdss and wise catalogues, and the planck 2015convergence lensing map. this cross-correlation yields a detection at$4\,\sigma$, where most of the signal-to-noise is due to the planck lensing andnvss. in fact, the isw effect is detected only from the planck data (throughthe isw-lensing bispectrum) at $\approx 3\,\sigma$, which is similar to thedetection level achieved by combining the cross-correlation signal coming fromall the catalogues. this cross-correlation analysis is performed only with theplanck temperature data, since the polarization scales available in the 2015release do not permit significant improvement of the cmb-lss cross-correlationdetectability. nevertheless, polarization data is used to study the anomalouslylarge isw signal previously reported through the aperture photometry on stackedcmb features at the locations of known superstructures, which is in conflictwith $\lambda$cdm expectations. we find that the current planck polarizationdata do not reject that this signal could be caused by the isw effect. inaddition, the stacking of the planck lensing map on the superstructures'locations exhibits a positive cross-correlation with these large-scalestructures. finally, we have improved our previous reconstruction of the iswtemperature fluctuations by combining the information encoded in all thepreviously mentioned lss tracers. in particular, we construct a map of the iswsecondary anisotropies and the corresponding uncertainties map, obtained fromsimulations. we also explore the reconstruction of the isw anisotropies causedby the lss traced by the 2mpz survey, by directly inverting the density fieldinto the gravitational potential field.

1502.02114	planck 2015 results. xx. constraints on inflation	we present the implications for cosmic inflation of the planck measurementsof the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropies in both temperature andpolarization based on the full planck survey. the planck full missiontemperature data and a first release of polarization data on large angularscales measure the spectral index of curvature perturbations to be$n_\mathrm{s} = 0.968 \pm 0.006$ and tightly constrain its scale dependence to$d n_s/d \ln k =-0.003 \pm 0.007$ when combined with the planck lensinglikelihood. when the high-$\ell$ polarization data is included, the results areconsistent and uncertainties are reduced. the upper bound on thetensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.002} &lt; 0.11$ (95% cl), consistent with theb-mode polarization constraint $r&lt; 0.12$ (95% cl) obtained from a jointbicep2/keck array and planck analysis. these results imply that $v(\phi)\propto \phi^2$ and natural inflation are now disfavoured compared to modelspredicting a smaller tensor-to-scalar ratio, such as $r^2$ inflation. threeindependent methods reconstructing the primordial power spectrum areinvestigated. the planck data are consistent with adiabatic primordialperturbations. we investigate inflationary models producing an anisotropicmodulation of the primordial curvature power spectrum as well as generalizedmodels of inflation not governed by a scalar field with a canonical kineticterm. the 2015 results are consistent with the 2013 analysis based on thenominal mission data.

1502.04123	planck intermediate results. xxxv. probing the role of the magnetic  field in the formation of structure in molecular clouds	within ten nearby (d &lt; 450 pc) gould belt molecular clouds we evaluatestatistically the relative orientation between the magnetic field projected onthe plane of sky, inferred from the polarized thermal emission of galactic dustobserved by planck at 353 ghz, and the gas column density structures,quantified by the gradient of the column density, $n_h$. the selected regions,covering several degrees in size, are analyzed at an effective angularresolution of 10' fwhm, thus sampling physical scales from 0.4 to 40 pc in thenearest cloud. the column densities in the selected regions range from $n_h\approx 10^{21}$ to $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and hence they correspond to the bulkof the molecular clouds. the relative orientation is evaluated pixel by pixeland analyzed in bins of column density using the novel statistical tool called"histogram of relative orientations". throughout this study, we assume that thepolarized emission observed by planck at 353 ghz is representative of theprojected morphology of the magnetic field in each region, i.e., we assume aconstant dust grain alignment efficiency, independent of the local environment.within most clouds we find that the relative orientation changes progressivelywith increasing $n_h$, from preferentially parallel or having no preferredorientation to preferentially perpendicular. in simulations ofmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence in molecular clouds this trend in relativeorientation is a signature of alfv\'enic or sub-alfv\'enic turbulence, implyingthat the magnetic field is significant for the gas dynamics at the scalesprobed by planck. we compare the deduced magnetic field strength with estimateswe obtain from other methods and discuss the implications of the planckobservations for the general picture of molecular cloud formation andevolution.

1502.05956	planck 2015 results. ix. diffuse component separation: cmb maps	we present foreground-reduced cmb maps derived from the full planck data setin both temperature and polarization. compared to the corresponding planck 2013temperature sky maps, the total data volume is larger by a factor of 3.2 forfrequencies between 30 and 70 ghz, and by 1.9 for frequencies between 100 and857 ghz. in addition, systematic errors in the forms oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, analogue-to-digital conversionuncertainties, and very long time constant errors have been dramaticallyreduced, to the extent that the cosmological polarization signal may now berobustly recovered on angular scales $\ell\gtrsim40$. on the very largestscales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared tothe expected cosmological signal, and modes with $\ell &lt; 20$ are accordinglysuppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering. as in 2013,four different cmb component separation algorithms are applied to theseobservations, providing a measure of stability with respect to algorithmic andmodelling choices. the resulting polarization maps have rms instrumental noiseranging between 0.21 and 0.27$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 55 arcmin pixels,and between 4.5 and 6.1$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 3.4 arcmin pixels. thecosmological parameters derived from the analysis of temperature power spectraare in agreement at the $1\sigma$ level with the planck 2015 likelihood.unresolved mismatches between the noise properties of the data and simulationsprevent a satisfactory description of the higher-order statistical propertiesof the polarization maps. thus, the primary applications of these polarizationmaps are those that do not require massive simulations for accurate estimationof uncertainties, for instance estimation of cross-spectra andcross-correlations, or stacking analyses.

1504.03339	planck intermediate results. xxxvii. evidence of unbound gas from the  kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect	by looking at the kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect (ksz) in planck nominalmission data, we present a significant detection of baryons participating inlarge-scale bulk flows around central galaxies (cgs) at redshift $z\approx0.1$. we estimate the pairwise momentum of the ksz temperature fluctuations atthe positions of the cgc (central galaxy catalogue) samples extracted fromsloan digital sky survey (dr7) data. for the foreground-cleaned maps, we find$1.8$-$2.5\sigma$ detections of the ksz signal, which are consistent with theksz evidence found in individual planck raw frequency maps, although lower thanfound in the wmap-9yr w band ($3.3\sigma$). we further reconstruct the peculiarvelocity field from the cg density field, and compute for the first time thecross-correlation function between ksz temperature fluctuations and estimatesof cg radial peculiar velocities. this correlation function yields a$3.0$-$3.7$$\sigma$ detection of the peculiar motion of extended gas on mpcscales, in flows correlated up to distances of 80-100 $h^{-1}$ mpc. both thepairwise momentum estimates and ksz temperature-velocity field correlation findevidence for ksz signatures out to apertures of 8 arcmin and beyond,corresponding to a physical radius of $&gt; 1$ mpc, more than twice the meanvirial radius of halos. this is consistent with the predictions from hydrosimulations that most of the baryons are outside the virialized halos. we fit asimple model, in which the temperature-velocity cross-correlation isproportional to the signal seen in a semi-analytic model built upon n-bodysimulations, and interpret the proportionality constant as an "effective"optical depth to thomson scattering. we find $\tau_t=(1.4\pm0.5)\times10^{-4}$; the simplest interpretation of this measurement is that much of thegas is in a diffuse phase, which contributes little signal to x-ray or thermalsz observations.

1505.02779	planck intermediate results. xxxviii. e- and b-modes of dust  polarization from the magnetized filamentary structure of the interstellar  medium	the quest for a b-mode imprint from primordial gravity waves on thepolarization of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) requires thecharacterization of foreground polarization from galactic dust. we present astatistical study of the filamentary structure of the 353 ghz planck stokesmaps at high galactic latitude, relevant to the study of dust emission as apolarized foreground to the cmb. we filter the intensity and polarization mapsto isolate filaments in the range of angular scales where the power asymmetrybetween e-modes and b-modes is observed. using the smoothed hessian major axisfilament finder, we identify 259 filaments at high galactic latitude, withlengths larger or equal to 2\deg\ (corresponding to 3.5 pc in length for atypical distance of 100 pc). these filaments show a preferred orientationparallel to the magnetic field projected onto the plane of the sky, derivedfrom their polarization angles. we present mean maps of the filaments in stokesi, q, u, e, and b, computed by stacking individual images rotated to align theorientations of the filaments. combining the stacked images and the histogramof relative orientations, we estimate the mean polarization fraction of thefilaments to be 11 %. furthermore, we show that the correlation between thefilaments and the magnetic field orientations may account for the e and basymmetry and the $c_{\ell}^{te}/c_{\ell}^{ee}$ ratio, reported in the powerspectra analysis of the planck 353 ghz polarization maps. future models of thedust foreground for cmb polarization studies will need to take into account theobserved correlation between the dust polarization and the structure ofinterstellar matter.

1505.08022	planck 2015 results. v. lfi calibration	we present a description of the pipeline used to calibrate the planck lowfrequency instrument (lfi) timelines into thermodynamic temperatures for theplanck 2015 data release, covering four years of uninterrupted operations. asin the 2013 data release, our calibrator is provided by the spin-synchronousmodulation of the cosmic microwave background dipole, but we now use theorbital component, rather than adopting the wilkinson microwave anisotropyprobe (wmap) solar dipole. this allows our 2015 lfi analysis to provide anindependent solar dipole estimate, which is in excellent agreement with that ofhfi and within $1\sigma$ (0.3% in amplitude) of the wmap value. this 0.3% shiftin the peak-to-peak dipole temperature from wmap and a global overhaul of theiterative calibration code increases the overall level of the lfi maps by 0.45%(30 ghz), 0.64% (44 ghz), and 0.82% (70 ghz) in temperature with respect to the2013 planck data release, thus reducing the discrepancy with the power spectrummeasured by wmap. we estimate that the lfi calibration uncertainty is now atthe level of 0.20% for the 70 ghz map, 0.26% for the 44 ghz map, and 0.35% forthe 30 ghz map. we provide a detailed description of the impact of all thechanges implemented in the calibration since the previous data release.

1508.04171	planck intermediate results. xxxix. the planck list of high-redshift  source candidates	the planck mission, thanks to its large frequency range and all-sky coverage,has a unique potential for systematically detecting the brightest, and rarest,submillimetre sources on the sky, including distant objects in thehigh-redshift universe traced by their dust emission. a novel method, based ona component-separation procedure using a combination of planck and iras data,has been applied to select the most luminous cold submm sources with spectralenergy distributions peaking between 353 and 857ghz at 5' resolution. a totalof 2151 planck high-z source candidates (the phz) have been detected in thecleanest 26% of the sky, with flux density at 545ghz above 500mjy. embedded inthe cosmic infrared background close to the confusion limit, these high-zcandidates exhibit colder colours than their surroundings, consistent withredshifts z&gt;2, assuming a dust temperature of 35k and a spectral index of 1.5.first follow-up observations obtained from optical to submm have confirmed thatthis list consists of two distinct populations. a small fraction (around 3%) ofthe sources have been identified as strongly gravitationally lensedstar-forming galaxies, which are amongst the brightest submm lensed objects(with flux density at 545ghz ranging from 350mjy up to 1jy) at redshift 2 to 4.however, the vast majority of the phz sources appear as overdensities of dustystar-forming galaxies, having colours consistent with z&gt;2, and may beconsidered as proto-cluster candidates. the phz provides an original sample,complementary to the planck sunyaev-zeldovich catalogue; by extending thepopulation of the virialized massive galaxy clusters to a population of sourcesat z&gt;1.5, the phz may contain the progenitors of today's clusters. hence thephz opens a new window on the study of the early ages of structure formation,and the understanding of the intensively star-forming phase at high-z.

1509.06555	planck 2015 results. xxiii. the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich effect--cosmic  infrared background correlation	we use planck data to detect the cross-correlation between the thermalsunyaev-zeldovich (tsz) effect and the infrared emission from the galaxies thatmake up the the cosmic infrared background (cib). we first perform a stackinganalysis towards planck-confirmed galaxy clusters. we detect infrared emissionproduced by dusty galaxies inside these clusters and demonstrate that theinfrared emission is about 50% more extended than the tsz effect. modelling theemission with a navarro--frenk--white profile, we find that the radial profileconcentration parameter is $c_{500} = 1.00^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$. this indicatesthat infrared galaxies in the outskirts of clusters have higher infrared fluxthan cluster-core galaxies. we also study the cross-correlation between tsz andcib anisotropies, following three alternative approaches based on powerspectrum analyses: (i) using a catalogue of confirmed clusters detected inplanck data; (ii) using an all-sky tsz map built from planck frequency maps;and (iii) using cross-spectra between planck frequency maps. with the threedifferent methods, we detect the tsz-cib cross-power spectrum at significancelevels of (i) 6 $\sigma$, (ii) 3 $\sigma$, and (iii) 4 $\sigma$. we model thetsz-cib cross-correlation signature and compare predictions with themeasurements. the amplitude of the cross-correlation relative to the fiducialmodel is $a_{\rm tsz-cib}= 1.2\pm0.3$. this result is consistent withpredictions for the tsz-cib cross-correlation assuming the best-fitcosmological model from planck 2015 results along with the tsz and cib scalingrelations.

1511.05156	planck intermediate results. xl. the sunyaev-zeldovich signal from the  virgo cluster	the virgo cluster is the largest sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) source in the sky,both in terms of angular size and total integrated flux. planck's wide angularscale and frequency coverage, together with its high sensitivity, allow adetailed study of this large object through the sz effect. virgo is wellresolved by planck, showing an elongated structure, which correlates well withthe morphology observed from x-rays, but extends beyond the observed x-raysignal. we find a good agreement between the sz signal (or compton paranmeter,y_c) observed by planck and the expected signal inferred from x-rayobservations and simple analytical models. due to its proximity to us, the gasbeyond the virial radius can be studied with unprecedented sensitivity byintegrating the sz signal over tens of square degrees. we study the signal inthe outskirts of virgo and compare it with analytical models and a constrainedsimulation of the environment of virgo. planck data suggest that significantamounts of low-density plasma surround virgo out to twice the virial radius. wefind the sz signal in the outskirts of virgo to be consistent with a simplemodel that extrapolates the inferred pressure at lower radii while assumingthat the temperature stays in the kev range beyond the virial radius. theobserved signal is also consistent with simulations and points to a shallowpressure profile in the outskirts of the cluster. this reservoir of gas atlarge radii can be linked with the hottest phase of the elusive warm/hotintergalactic medium. taking the lack of symmetry of virgo into account, wefind that a prolate model is favoured by the combination of sz and x-ray data,in agreement with predictions.

1511.05428	a critical assessment of the metal content of the icm	our goal is to provide a robust estimate of the metal content of the icm inmassive clusters. we make use of published abundance profiles for a sample of~60 nearby systems, we include in our estimate uncertainties associated to themeasurement process and to the almost total lack of measures in clusteroutskirts. we perform a first, albeit rough, census of metals finding that themean abundance of the icm within r_180 is very poorly constrained, 0.06z_sol &lt;z &lt; 0.26z_sol, and presents no tension with expectations. similarly, thequestion of if and how the bulk of the metal content in clusters varies withcosmic time, is very much an open one. a solid estimate of abundances incluster outskirts could be achieved by combining observations of the twoexperiments which will operate on board athena, the xifu and the wfi, providedthey do not fall victim to the de-scoping process that has afflicted severalspace observatories over the last decade.

1512.02882	planck intermediate results. xli. a map of lensing-induced b-modes	the lensing-induced $b$-mode signal is a valuable probe of the dark matterdistribution integrated back to the last-scattering surface, with a broadkernel that peaks at $z\simeq2$. it also constitutes an important contaminantfor the extraction of the primary cmb $b$-modes from inflation. combiningall-sky coverage and high resolution and sensitivity, planck provides accuratenearly all-sky measurements of both the polarization $e$-mode signal and theintegrated mass distribution via the reconstruction of the cmb gravitationallensing. by combining these two data products, we have produced an all-skytemplate map of the secondary cmb $b$-modes using a real-space algorithm thatminimizes the impact of sky masks. the cross-correlation of this template withan observed (primordial and secondary) $b$-mode map can be used to measure thelensing $b$-mode power spectrum at all angular scales. in particular whencross-correlating with the $b$-mode contribution directly derived from theplanck polarization maps, we obtain lensing-induced $b$-mode power spectrummeasurements at a significance of $12\,\sigma$, which are in agreement with thetheoretical expectation derived from the \planck\ best-fit $\lambda$cdm model.this unique nearly all-sky secondary $b$-mode template, which includes thelensing-induced information from intermediate to small ($10\lesssim\ell\lesssim 1000$) angular scales, is delivered as part of the planck 2015public data release. it will be particularly useful for experiments searchingfor primordial $b$-modes, such as bicep2/keck array or litebird, since it willenable an estimate to be made of the secondary (i.e., lensing) contribution tothe measured total cmb $b$-modes.

astro-ph;0611056	a cluster in a crowded environment: xmm-newton and chandra observations  of a3558	combining xmm-newton and chandra data, we have performed a detailed study ofabell 3558. our analysis shows that its dynamical history is more complicatedthan previously thought. we have found some traits typical of cool coreclusters (surface brightness peaked at the center, peaked metal abundanceprofile) and others that are more common in merging clusters, like deviationsfrom spherical symmetry in the thermodynamic quantities of the icm. this lastresult has been achieved with a new technique for deriving temperature mapsfrom images. we have also detected a cold front and, with the combined use ofxmm-newton and chandra, we have characterized its properties, such as the speedand the metal abundance profile across the edge. this cold front is probablydue to the sloshing of the core, induced by the perturbation of thegravitational potential associated with a past merger. the hydrodynamicprocesses related to this perturbation have presumably produced a tail of lowerentropy, higher pressure and metal rich icm, which extends behind the coldfront for about 500 kpc. the unique characteristics of a3558 are probably dueto the very peculiar environment in which it is located: the core of theshapley supercluster.
