0909.2285	nonthermal radiation of young supernova remnants	a new numerical code, designed for the detailed numerical treatment ofnonlinear diffusive shock acceleration, is used for modeling of particleacceleration and radiation in young supernova remnants. the model is based onspherically symmetric hydrodynamic equations complemented with transportequations for relativistic particles. for the first time, the acceleration ofelectrons and protons by both forward and reverse shocks is studied throughdetailed numerical calculations. we model the energy spectra and spatialdistributions of nonthermal emission of the young supernova remnant rxj1713.7-3946 and compare the calculations with the spectral and morphologicalproperties of this object obtained in broad energy band from radio to very highenergy gamma-rays. we discuss the advantages and shortcomings of the so-calledhadronic and leptonic models which assume that the observed tev gamma-rayemission is produced by accelerated protons and electrons, respectively. wediscuss also a "composite" scenario when the gamma-ray flux from the main partsof the shell has inverse compton origin, but with a non-negligible contributionof hadronic origin from dense clouds interacting with the shell.

0910.5715	acceleration and radiation of ultra-high energy protons in galaxy  clusters	clusters of galaxies are believed to be capable to accelerate protons ataccretion shocks to energies exceeding 10^18 ev. at these energies, the lossescaused by interactions of cosmic rays with photons of the cosmic microwavebackground radiation (cmbr) become effective and determine the maximum energyof protons and the shape of the energy spectrum in the cutoff region. the aimof this work is the study of the formation of the energy spectrum ofaccelerated protons at accretion shocks of galaxy clusters and of thecharacteristics of their broad band emission. the proton energy distribution iscalculated self-consistently via a time-dependent numerical treatment of theshock acceleration process which takes into account the proton energy lossesdue to interactions with the cmbr. we calculate the energy distribution ofaccelerated protons, as well as the flux of broad-band emission produced bysecondary electrons and positrons via synchrotron and inverse comptonscattering processes. we find that the downstream and upstream regionscontribute almost at the same level to the emission. for the typical parameterscharacterising galaxy clusters, the synchrotron and ic peaks in the spectralenergy distributions appear at comparable flux levels. for an efficientacceleration, the expected emission components in the x-ray and gamma-ray bandare close to the detection threshold of current generation instruments, andwill be possibly detected with the future generation of detectors.

1107.4831	modelling interaction of relativistic and non-relativistic winds in  binary system psr b1259-63/ss2883 - ii. impact of magnetization and  anisotropy of the pulsar wind	in this paper, we present a numerical study of the properties of the flowproduced by the collision of a magnetized anisotropic pulsar wind with itsenvironment in binary system. we compare the impact of both the magnetic fieldand the wind anisotropy to the benchmark case of a purely hydrodynamical (hd)interaction of isotropic winds, which has been studied in detail by bogovalovet al. (2008). we consider the interaction in axisymmetric approximation, i.e.the pulsar rotation axis is assumed to be oriented along the line between thepulsar and the optical star and the effects related to the pulsar orbiting areneglected. the impact of the magnetic field is studied for the case of weakmagnetization (with magnetization parameter $\sigma&lt;0.1$), which is consistentwith conventional models of pulsar winds. the effects related to anisotropy inpulsar winds are modeled assuming that the kinetic energy flux in anon-magnetized pulsar wind is strongly anisotropic, with the minimum at thepulsar rotation axis and the maximum in the perpendicular direction. we showthat, although both considered effects change the shape of the region occupiedby the terminated pulsar wind, their impact appears to be small. in particular,for the magnetization of the pulsar wind below 0.1, the magnetic field pressureremains well below the plasma pressure in the post-shock region. thus, in thecase of interaction of a pulsar with the stellar wind environment (opposite tothe case of plerions, i.e. the pulsar interaction with the interstellar medium,when the magnetic field becomes dynamically important independently on the windmagnetization) the hd approach represents a feasible approximation fornumerical modelling.

1107.4833	post-periastron gamma ray flare from psr b1259-63/ls 2883 as a result of  comptonization of the cold pulsar wind	we argue that the bright flare of the binary pulsar \object{psrb1259$-$63/ls2883} detected by the {\it fermi} large area telescope (lat), isdue to the inverse compton (ic) scattering of the unshocked electron-positronpulsar wind with a lorentz factor $\gamma_0 \approx 10^4$. the combination oftwo effects both linked to the circumstellar disk (cd), is a key element in theproposed model. the first effect is related to the impact of the surroundingmedium on the termination of the pulsar wind. inside the disk, the "early"termination of the wind results in suppression of its gamma-ray luminosity.when the pulsar escapes the disk, the conditions for termination of the windundergo significant changes. this would lead to a dramatic increase of thepulsar wind zone, and thus to the proportional increase of the gamma-ray flux.on the other hand, if the parts of the cd disturbed by the pulsar can supplyinfrared photons of density high enough for efficient comptonization of thewind, almost the entire kinetic energy of the pulsar wind would be converted toradiation, thus the gamma-ray luminosity of the wind could approach to thelevel of the pulsar's spin-down luminosity as reported by the {\it fermi}collaboration.

1501.04994	synchro-curvature radiation of charged particles in the strong curved  magnetic fields	it is generally believed that the radiation of relativistic particles in acurved magnetic field proceeds in either the synchrotron or the curvatureradiation modes. in this paper we show that in strong curved magnetic fields asignificant fraction of the energy of relativistic electrons can be radiatedaway in the intermediate, the so-called synchro-curvature regime. because ofthe persistent change of the trajectory curvature, the radiation varies withthe frequency of particle gyration. while this effect can be ignored in thesynchrotron and curvature regimes, the variability plays a key role in theformation of the synchro-curvature radiation. using the hamiltonian formalism,we find that the particle trajectory has the form of a helix wound around thedrift trajectory. this allows us to calculate analytically the intensity andenergy distribution of prompt radiation in the general case of magneticbremsstrahlung in the curved magnetic field. we show that the transition to thelimit of the synchrotron and curvature radiation regimes is determined by therelation between the drift velocity and the component of the particle velocityperpendicular to the drift trajectory. the detailed numerical calculations,which take into account the energy losses of particles, confirm the principalconclusions based on the simplified analytical treatment of the problem, andallow us to analyze quantitatively the transition between different radiationregimes for a broad range of initial pitch angles. we argue that in the case ofrealization of specific configurations of the electric and magnetic fields, thegamma-ray emission of the pulsar magnetospheres can be dominated by thecomponent radiated in the synchro-curvature regime.

0806.2459	the diffuse neutrino flux from the inner galaxy: constraints from very  high energy gamma-ray observations	recently, the milagro collaboration reported on the detection of a diffusemulti-tev emission from a region of the galactic disk close to the innergalaxy. the emission is in excess of what is predicted by conventional modelsfor cosmic ray propagation, which are tuned to reproduce the spectrum of cosmicrays observed locally. by assuming that the excess detected by milagro is ofhadronic origin and that it is representative for the whole inner galacticregion, we estimate the expected diffuse flux of neutrinos from a region of thegalactic disk with coordinates $-40^{\circ} &lt; l &lt; 40^{\circ}$. our estimate hasto be considered as the maximal expected neutrino flux compatible with all theavailable gamma ray data, since any leptonic contribution to the observedgamma-ray emission would lower the neutrino flux. the diffuse flux ofneutrinos, if close to the maximum allowed level, may be detected by akm$^3$--scale detector located in the northern hemisphere. a detection wouldunambiguously reveal the hadronic origin of the diffuse gamma-ray emission.

astro-ph;0001186	on the gamma-ray fluxes expected from cassiopeia a	based on the results of our previous study of the broad band synchrotronemission of cas a in the framework of a spatial inhomogeneous model, wecalculate the fluxes of gamma-radiation that can be expected from thissupernova remnant in different energy bands. we show that at energies below 10gev gamma-ray fluxes detectable by forthcoming space-borne detectors should beproduced due to bremsstrahlung of radio emitting electrons. we predict that thepower-law index of the photon flux in the gev region should be hard, close tothe index ~2.2 expected for the acceleration spectrum of the electrons. photonfluxes accessible to future ground-based gamma-ray detectors could also beexpected at very high energies. the fluxes to be expected due to bremsstrahlungand inverse compton radiation of relativistic electrons at tev energies shouldbe very steep, and strongly dependent on the characteristic magnetic fields incas a. we could expect also significant fluxes of pi^0 -decay gamma-raysproduced by relativistic protons. these fluxes may extend with a hard spectrumbeyond tev energies as far as the protons would be accelerated to energiesbeyond 100 tev. the hardness of the gamma-ray spectrum at tev energies could inprinciple allow one to distinguish between electronic and hadronic origins ofthose gamma-rays. we discuss also other implications, such as relativisticparticle content, or physical parameters in the source, that could be derivedfrom future gamma-ray flux measurements in different energy bands.

astro-ph;0001187	on energy-dependent propagation effects and acceleration sites of  relativistic electrons in cassiopeia a	we consider the effect of energy dependent propagation of relativisticelectrons in a spatially inhomogeneous medium in order to interpret thebroad-band nonthermal radiation of the young supernova remnant (snr) cassiopeiaa. a two-zone model is proposed that distinguishes between compact, brightsteep-spectrum radio knots and the bright fragmented radio ring on the onehand, and the remainder of the shell - the diffuse `plateau' - on the otherhand. in the framework of this model it is possible to explain the basicfeatures of the spectral and temporal evolution of the synchrotron radiation ofcas a if one assumes that these compact structures correspond to sites ofefficient electron acceleration producing hard spectra of accelerated particleswith power-law indices ~2.2. the resulting energy distribution of radioelectrons in these compact structures becomes significantly steeper than theelectron production spectrum on timescales of the energy dependent escape ofthese electrons into the surrounding diffuse plateau region. we argue that thesteepness, rather than the hardness, of the radio spectra of compact brightstructures in clumpy sources can in general be considered as a typicalsignature of sites where strong electron acceleration has built up highgradients in the spatial distribution of radio electrons. subsequent diffusiveescape then modifies their energy distribution, leading to spatial variationsof spectral indices within the radio source. qualitative and quantitativeinterpretations of a number of observational data of cas a are given.predictions following from the model are discussed.

(2) the hadronic model of drury, aharonian &amp; voelk, and (3) the more recenttime-dependent kinetic theory of berezhko &amp; voelk.  our upper limit lies within the range of predicted values of both hadronicmodels, according to uncertainties in physical parameters of tycho, and shockacceleration details. in the latter case, the model was scaled to suit theparameters of tycho and re-normalised to account for a simplification of theoriginal model.  we find that we cannot rule out tycho as a potential contributor at anaverage level to the galactic cosmic-ray flux.

astro-ph;0108419	on the origin of highest energy gamma-rays from mkn 501	the spectra of very high energy gamma-radiation from distant extragalacticobjects suffer significant deformations during the passage of primarygamma-rays through the intergalactic medium. the recently reported fluxes ofdiffuse infrared background radiation indicate that we detect, most probably,heavily absorbed tev radiation from mkn 421 and mkn 501. this implies that theabsorption-corrected spectrum of mkn 501 may contain a sharp pile-up whichcontradicts to the predictions of the conventional models of tev blazars, andthus may leads to the so-called "ir background-tev gamma-ray crisis". toovercome this difficulty, in this paper we propose two independent hypothesesassuming that (i) the tev radiation from mkn 501 has a secondary origin, i.e.it is formed during the development of electron-photon cascades in theintergalactic medium initiated by primary gamma-rays; (ii) the pile-up in thesource spectrum is a result of comptonization (in deep klein-nishina regime) ofambient optical radiation by an ultrarelativistic conical cold outflow (jet)with bulk motion lorentz factor gamma_0 &gt;= 3 10^7. within the uncertaintiescaused by the limited energy resolution of spectral measurements, the observedtev radiation of mkn 501 formally can be explained by the intergalactic cascadegamma-rays, assuming however an extremely low intergalactic magnetic field inthe direction to the source at the level of &lt; 10^{-18} g. we also demonstratethat the "bulk motion comptonization" scenario can quite naturally reproducethe unusual spectral features in the absorption-corrected tev spectrum of mkn501, and briefly discuss the astrophysical implications of this hypothesis.

astro-ph;0207115	on the potential of the imaging atmospheric cherenkov technique for  study of the mass composition of primary cosmic radiation in the energy  region above 30 tev	we suggest a new approach to study the cosmis ray (cr) mass composition inthe energy region from 30 tev/nucleus up to the "knee" region, i.e. up to a fewpev/nucleus, using an array of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes (iacts)of a special architecture. this array consists of telescopes with a relativelysmall mirror size (~10 square meters) separated from each other by largedistances (~500 meters) and equipped by multichannel cameras with a modestpixel size (0.3-0.5 degree) and a sufficiently large viewing angle (6-7degree).  compared to traditional iact systems (like hegra, hess or veritas) the iactarray considered here could provide a very large detection area (several squarekilometers or more). at the same time, it allows an accurate measurement of theenergy of cr induced air showers (the energy resolution ranges within 25-35%)and an effective separation of air showers created by different nuclei.particularly, it is possible to enrich air showers belonging to the nucleusgroup assigned for selection up to ~90% purity at a detection efficiency of15-20% of such showers.

astro-ph;0208049	flat spectrum x-ray emission from the direction of a molecular cloud  associated with snr rx j1713.7-3946	we report on the discovery of a hard x-ray source with asca from a molecularcloud in the vicinity of the snr rx j1713.7-3946. the energy spectrum (1--10kev) shows a flat continuum which is described by a power-law with photon index1.0 +-0.4. we argue that this unusually flat spectrum can be best interpretedin terms of characteristic bremsstrahlung emission from theionization-loss-flattened distribution of either sub-relativistic protons ormildly-relativistic electrons. the strong shock of the snr rx j1713.7-3946,which presumably interacts with the molecular cloud, as evidenced byobservations of co-lines, seems to be a natural site of acceleration of suchsub- or mildly-relativistic nonthermal particles. however, the observed x-rayluminosity of 1.7 10^35 erg/s (for 6 kpc distance) requires that a huge kineticenergy of about 10^50 erg be released in the form of nonthermal particles toilluminate the cloud. the shock-acceleration at rx j1713.7-3946 can barelysatisfy this energetic requirement, unless (i) the source is located muchcloser than 6 kpc and/or (ii) the mechanical energy of the explosionessentially exceeds 10^51 erg. another possibility would be that an essentialpart of the "lost" energy is somehow converted to plasma waves, which returnthis energy to nonthermal particles through their turbulent reacceleration onplasma waves. irrespective of mechanisms responsible for production ofhigh-energy particles, the flat x-ray emission seems to be a signature of a newstriking energetic phenomenon in molecular clouds.

astro-ph;0301263	particle acceleration through multiple conversions from charged into  neutral state and back	we propose a new way of quick and very efficient acceleration of protonsand/or electrons in relativistic bulk flows. the new mechanism takes advantageof conversion of particles from the charged state (protons orelectrons/positrons) into neutral state (neutrons or photons) and back. in mostcases, the conversion is photon-induced and requires presence of intenseradiation fields, but the converter acceleration mechanism may also operate viainelastic nucleon-nucleon collisions.  like in the traditional model -- ``stochastic'' (or diffusive) acceleration,-- the acceleration cycle in our scenario consists of escape of particles fromthe relativistic flow followed by their return back after deflection from theambient magnetic field. the difference is that the charge-changing reactions,which occur during the cycle, allow accelerated particles to increase theirenergies in each cycle by a factor roughly equal to the bulk lorentz factorsquared.  the emerging spectra of accelerated particles can be very hard and theircut-off energy in some cases is larger than in the standard mechanism. thisdrastically reduces the required energy budget of the sources of thehighest-energy particles observed in cosmic rays. also, the proposedacceleration mechanism may serve as an efficient means of transferring theenergy of bulk motion to gamma-radiation and, if the accelerated particles arenucleons, routinely produces high-energy neutrinos at $\sim 50 %$ relativeefficiency.

astro-ph;9312045	very high energy gamma-rays from agn: cascading on the cosmic background  radiation fields and the formation of pair halos	recent high energy gamma-ray observations (e&gt;100 mev) of blazar agn showemission spectra with no clear upper energy cutoff. agn, considered to bepossible sources for the highest energy cosmic rays, may have emissionextending well into the vhe (very high energy, e&gt;100 gev) domain. because vhegamma-rays are absorbed by pair production on the intergalactic backgroundradiation, much of this emission is not visible. electromagnetic cascadesinitiated by absorbed vhe gamma-rays, however, may be observable. since thevelocities of e+e- pairs produced in a cascade are likely to be isotropized byan ambient random magnetic field, extended ``halos'' (r&gt;1 mpc) of pairs will beformed around agn with vhe emission. cascade radiation from these pair halos isemitted isotropically and is observable below a few tev. the halo radiation canbe distinguished by its characteristic variation in spectrum and intensity withangular distance from the central source. this variation depends weakly on thedetails of the central source model, e.g., the orientation and beaming/openingangle of an emitting jet. limiting or determining the intensity of the pairhalo can thus serve as a model-independent bound on or measure of the vhe powerof agn. next-generation cherenkov telescopes may be able to image a pair halo.

astro-ph;9610176	constraints on the vhe emissivity of the universe from the diffuse gev  gamma-ray background	vhe (very high energy, e&gt;100 gev) radiation emitted at cosmological distanceswill pair produce on low-energy diffuse extragalactic background radiationbefore ever reaching us. this prevents us from directly seeing most of the vheemission in the universe. however, a vhe gamma-ray that pair produces initiatesan electromagnetic pair cascade. at low energies, this secondary cascaderadiation has a spectrum insensitive to the spectrum of the primarygamma-radiation and, unlike the original vhe radiation, is observable.motivated by new measurements of the extragalactic mev-gev diffuse gamma-raybackground, we discuss the constraints placed on cosmological vhe sourcepopulations by requiring that the cascade background they produce not exceedthe observed levels. we use a new, accurate cascading code and pay particularattention to the dependence of the constraints on the diffuse cosmic backgroundat infrared/optical wavelengths. despite considerable uncertainty in thisbackground, we find that robust constraints may still be placed on theintegrated emissivity of potential vhe sources in the universe. the limits aretighter than those obtained by considering cascading on the microwavebackground alone and restrict significantly, for example, the parameter spaceavailable for the exotic particle physics scenarios recently proposed toexplain the highest energy cosmic ray events. if direct emission from blazaragn in fact accounts for most of the observed gev background, these limitsstrengthen and rule out agn emission scenarios which produce significant powerabove 300 gev.

astro-ph;9709296	grs 1915+105: the flux ratio of twin radio clouds as a measure of  asymmetry between counter jets	resolution of both approaching and receding ejecta in the galacticmicroquasars makes possible to measure the flux ratio s_a/s_r of the twinejecta, which contains an important information about the nature of the jets.we show that the flux ratio observed from grs 1915+105 during the prominentmarch/april 1994 radio flare can be explained in terms of relativistic motionof discrete radio clouds, if one assumes that the twin ejecta are similar, butnot completely identical, i.e. allowing for some asymmetry between theplasmoids in their speeds of propagation and/or luminosities. the recoilmomentum due to asymmetrical ejection of the pair of plasmoids could becomparable with the momentum accumulated in the inner accretion disk. wesuggest a possible explanation of the observed anticorrelation between thex-ray and radio flares as the result of drastic structural changes in the innerdisk caused by production of powerful jets. the delay between the times ofdecline of x-rays and appearance of strong radio flares is explained as thetime needed for expansion of radio clouds to become optically thin.

astro-ph;9711129	modelling of the nonthermal flares in the galactic microquasar grs  1915+105	we study the temporal and spectral evolution of the radio flares detectedfrom the relativistic ejecta in the microquasar grs 1915+105, and develop amodel which suggests that these flares are due to synchrotron radiation ofrelativistic electrons suffering adiabatic and radiative energy losses infastly expanding plasmoids (radio clouds). analytical solutions to the kineticequation for the electrons in expanding magnetized clouds are found. detailedcomparison of the calculated radio fluxes with the ones detected from theprominent flare of grs 1915+105 during march/april 1994 provides conclusiveinformation on the basic parameters in the ejecta, such as the absolute valuesand temporal evolution of the magnetic field, speed of expansion, the rate ofcontinuous injection of radio electrons into and their energy-dependent escapefrom the clouds, etc. the data of radio monitoring of the pair of resolvedejecta enable determination of parameters of the bulk motion of counter ejectaand the degree of asymmetry between them, and contain important information onthe prime energy source for the accelerated electrons. assuming that theelectrons might be accelerated up to very high energies, we calculate thefluxes of synchrotron radiation up to hard x-rays/soft gamma-rays, and of theinverse compton gev/tev gamma-rays expected during radio flares, and discussthe implications which could follow from either positive detection or fluxupper limits of these energetic photons.

astro-ph;9911224	x-ray/tev-gamma-ray observations of several strong flares of mkn 501  during 1997 and implications	during more than 6 months in 1997, the bl lac object mkn 501 was in anexceptionally bright state, both in the x-ray band and in the very high energy(vhe) band. in this paper we present a multiwavelength study of mkn 501 duringthis extraordinary outburst. we describe the analysis of a data base of x-rayobservations acquired with the pointed x-ray telescopes on board the rossix-ray timing explorer (rxte) during april, may, and july, 1997. we combine thisdata set with detailed vhe spectral information obtained from simultaneous ornearly simultaneous observations with the stereoscopic cherenkov telescopesystem of hegra. several strong flares could clearly be resolved in both energybands, making it possible to perform a detailed correlation analysis of thex-ray and vhe gamma-ray flux levels and spectra. we interpret the results inthe framework of a synchrotron self compton models and study the constraints onthe model parameters. we show that the emission mechanism produces an inversecompton spectrum with a significant curvature in the tev energy range anddiscuss the implications for estimates of the intergalactic extinction due topair production processes of the vhe photons on the diffuse extragalacticbackground radiation.

0809.5197	hydrodynamics of interaction of pulsar and stellar winds and its impact  on the high energy radiation of binary pulsar systems	the hydrodynamics of the interaction of pulsar and stellar winds in binarysystems harboring a pulsar and its impact on the nonthermal radiation of thebinary pulsar psr b1259-63/ss2883 is discussed. the collision of anultrarelativistic pulsar wind with a nonrelativistic stellar outflow results insignificant bulk acceleration of the shocked material from the pulsar wind.already at distances comparable to the size of the binary system, the lorentzfactor of the shocked flow can be as large as $\gamma$~4. this results insignificant anisotropy of the inverse compton radiation of acceleratedelectrons. because of the doppler boosting of the produced radiation, oneshould expect a variable gamma-ray signal from the system. in particular, thiseffect may naturally explain the reported tendency of a decrease of tevgamma-ray flux close to the periastron. the modeling of the interaction ofpulsar and stellar winds allows self-consistent calculations of adiabaticlosses. our results show that adiabatic losses dominate over the radiativelosses. these results have direct impact on the orbital variability of radio,x-ray and gamma-ray signals detected from the binary pulsar psr 1259-63/ss2883.

0811.3566	on the plasma temperature in supernova remnants with cosmic-ray modified  shocks	context: multiwavelength observations of supernova remnants can be explainedwithin the framework of the diffusive shock acceleration theory, which allowseffective conversion of the explosion energy into cosmic rays. although themodels of nonlinear shocks describe reasonably well the nonthermal component ofemission, certain issues, including the heating of the thermal plasma and therelated x-ray emission, remain still open.  aims: to discuss how the evolution and structure of supernova remnants isaffected by strong particle acceleration at the forward shock.  methods: analytical estimates combined with detailed discussion of thephysical processes.  results: the overall dynamics is shown to be relatively insensitive to theamount of particle acceleration, but the post-shock gas temperature can bereduced to a relatively small multiple, even as small as six times, the ambienttemperature with a very weak dependence on the shock speed. this is in markedcontrast to pure gas models where the temperature is insensitive to the ambienttemperature and is determined by the square of the shock speed. it thus appearsto be possible to suppress effectively thermal x-ray emission from remnants bystrong particle acceleration. this might provide a clue for understanding thelack of thermal x-rays from the tev bright supernova remnant rx j1713.7-3946.

0812.3358	study of the spectral and temporal characteristics of x-ray emission of  the gamma-ray binary ls 5039 with suzaku	we report on the results from suzaku broadband x-ray observations of thegalactic binary source ls5039. the suzaku data, which have continuous coverageof more than one orbital period, show strong modulation of the x-ray emissionat the orbital period of this tev gamma-ray emitting system.the x-ray emissionshows a minimum at orbital phase ~ 0.1, close to the so-called superiorconjunction of the compact object, and a maximum at phase ~0.7, very close tothe inferior conjunction of the compact object. the x-ray spectral data up to70 kev are described by a hard power-law with a phase-dependent photon indexwhich varies within gamma ~1.45 - 1.61. the amplitude of the flux variation isa factor of 2.5, but is significantly less than that of the factor ~8 variationin the tev flux. otherwise the two light curves are similar, but not identical.although periodic x-ray emission has been found from many galactic binarysystems, the suzaku result implies a phenomenon different from the "standard"origin of x-rays related to the emission of the hot accretion plasma formedaround the compact companion object. the x-ray radiation of ls5039is likely tobe linked to very-high-energy electrons which are also responsible for the tevgamma-ray emission. while the gamma-rays are the result of inverse comptonscattering by electrons on optical stellar photons, x-rays are produced viasynchrotron radiation. yet, while the modulation of the tev gamma-ray signalcan be naturally explained by the photon-photon pair production and anisotropicinverse compton scattering, the observed modulation of synchrotron x-raysrequires an additional process, the most natural one being adiabatic expansionin the radiation production region.
