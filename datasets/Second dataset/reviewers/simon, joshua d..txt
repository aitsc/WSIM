0902.2395	high-resolution spectroscopy of extremely metal-poor stars in the least  evolved galaxies: ursa major ii and coma berenices	we present keck/hires observations of six metal-poor stars in two of theultra-faint dwarf galaxies orbiting the milky way, ursa major ii and comaberenices. these observations include the first high-resolution spectroscopicobservations of extremely metal-poor stars ([fe/h]&lt;-3.0) stars not belonging tothe milky way (mw) halo field star population. we obtain abundance measurementsand upper limits for 26 elements between carbon and europium. the entire sampleof stars spans a range of -3.2&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-2.3, and we confirm that each galaxycontains a large intrinsic spread of fe abundances. a comparison with mw halostars of similar metallicities reveals substantial agreement between theabundance patterns of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and the mw halo for thelight, alpha and iron-peak elements (c to zn). this agreement contrasts withthe results of earlier studies of more metal-rich stars (-2.5&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-1.0) inmore luminous dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs), which found significantabundance discrepancies with respect to the mw halo data. the abundances ofneutron-capture elements (sr to eu) in the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies areextremely low, consistent with the most metal-poor halo stars, but not with thetypical halo abundance pattern at [fe/h]&gt;-3.0. our results are broadlyconsistent with a galaxy formation model that predicts that massive dwarfgalaxies are the source of the metal-rich component ([fe/h]&gt;-2.5) of the mwhalo, but we also suggest that the faintest known dwarfs may be the primarycontributors to the metal-poor end of the mw halo metallicity distribution.

0902.2591	the role of dwarf galaxies in building large stellar halos	the hierarchical theory of galaxy formation rests on the idea that smallergalactic structures merge to form the galaxies that we see today. the pastdecade has provided remarkable observational support for this scenario, drivenin part by advances in spectroscopic instrumentation. multi-object spectroscopyenabled the discovery of kinematically cold substructures around the milky wayand m31 that are likely the debris of disrupting satellites. improvements inhigh-resolution spectroscopy have produced key evidence that the abundancepatterns of the milky way halo and its dwarf satellites can be explained bygalactic chemical evolution models based on hierarchical assembly.  these breakthroughs have depended almost entirely on observations of nearbystars in the milky way and luminous red giant stars in m31 and local groupdwarf satellites. in the next decade, extremely large telescopes will allowobservations far down the luminosity function in the known dwarf galaxies, andthey will enable observations of individual stars far out in the galactic halo.the chemical abundance census now available for the milky way will becomepossible for our nearest neighbor, m31. velocity dispersion measurements nowavailable in m31 will become possible for systems beyond the local group suchas sculptor and m81 group galaxies. detailed studies of a greater number ofindividual stars in a greater number of spiral galaxies and their satelliteswill test hierarchical assembly in new ways because dynamical and chemicalevolution models predict different outcomes for halos of different masses indifferent environments.

0902.3492	dwarf galaxies in 2010: revealing galaxy formation's threshold and  testing the nature of dark matter	over the past five years, searches in sloan digital sky survey data have morethan doubled the number of known dwarf satellite galaxies of the milky way, andhave revealed a population of ultra-faint galaxies with luminosities smallerthan typical globular clusters, l ~ 1000 lsun. these systems are the faintest,most dark matter dominated, and most metal poor galaxies in the universe.completeness corrections suggest that we are poised on the edge of a vastdiscovery space in galaxy phenomenology, with hundreds more of these extremegalaxies to be discovered as future instruments hunt for the low-luminositythreshold of galaxy formation. dark matter dominated dwarfs of this kind probethe small-scale power-spectrum, provide the most stringent limits on thephase-space packing of dark matter, and offer a particularly useful target fordark matter indirect detection experiments. full use of dwarfs as dark matterlaboratories will require synergy between deep, large-area photometricsearches; spectroscopic and astrometric follow-up with next-generation opticaltelescopes; and subsequent observations with gamma-ray telescopes for darkmatter indirect detection.

0907.1083	variable sodium absorption in a low-extinction type ia supernova	recent observations have revealed that some type ia supernovae exhibitnarrow, time-variable na i d absorption features. the origin of the absorbingmaterial is controversial, but it may suggest the presence of circumstellar gasin the progenitor system prior to the explosion, with significant implicationsfor the nature of the supernova progenitors. we present the third detection ofsuch variable absorption, based on six epochs of high-resolution spectroscopyof the type ia supernova sn 2007le from keck and the het. the data span ~3months, from 5 days before maximum light to 90 days after maximum. we find thatone component of the na d absorption lines strengthened significantly withtime, indicating a total column density increase of ~2.5 x 10^12 cm^-2. thechanges are most prominent after maximum light rather than at earlier timeswhen the uv flux from the sn peaks. as with sn 2006x, we detect no change inthe ca ii h&amp;k lines over the same time period, rendering line-of-sight effectsimprobable and suggesting a circumstellar origin for the absorbing material.unlike the previous two sne exhibiting variable absorption, sn 2007le is nothighly reddened (e_b-v = 0.27 mag), also pointing toward circumstellar ratherthan interstellar absorption. photoionization models show that the data areconsistent with a dense (10^7 cm^-3) cloud or clouds of gas located ~0.1 pcfrom the explosion. these results broadly support the single-degeneratescenario previously proposed to explain the variable absorption, with mass lossfrom a nondegenerate companion star responsible for providing the circumstellargas. we also present tentative evidence for narrow halpha emission associatedwith the sn, which will require followup observations at late times to confirm.[abridged]

0908.2995	accurate masses for dispersion-supported galaxies	we derive an accurate mass estimator for dispersion-supported stellar systemsand demonstrate its validity by analyzing resolved line-of-sight velocity datafor globular clusters, dwarf galaxies, and elliptical galaxies. specifically,by manipulating the spherical jeans equation we show that the dynamical massenclosed within the 3d deprojected half-light radius r_1/2 can be determinedwith only mild assumptions about the spatial variation of the stellar velocitydispersion anisotropy. we find m_1/2 = 3 \sigma_los^2 r_1/2 / g ~ 4\sigma_los^2 r_eff / g, where \sigma_los^2 is the luminosity-weighted square ofthe line-of-sight velocity dispersion and r_eff is the 2d projected half-lightradius. while deceptively familiar in form, this formula is not the virialtheorem, which cannot be used to determine accurate masses unless the radialprofile of the total mass is known a priori. we utilize this finding to showthat all of the milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies (mw dsphs) are consistentwith having formed within a halo of mass approximately 3 x 10^9 m_sun in lambdacdm cosmology. the faintest mw dsphs seem to have formed in dark matter halosthat are at least as massive as those of the brightest mw dsphs, despite thealmost five orders of magnitude spread in luminosity. we expand our analysis tothe full range of observed dispersion-supported stellar systems and examinetheir i-band mass-to-light ratios (m/l). the m/l vs. m_1/2 relation fordispersion-supported galaxies follows a u-shape, with a broad minimum near m/l~ 3 that spans dwarf elliptical galaxies to normal ellipticals, a steep rise tom/l ~ 3,200 for ultra-faint dsphs, and a more shallow rise to m/l ~ 800 forgalaxy cluster spheroids.

0912.4734	linking dwarf galaxies to halo building blocks with the most metal-poor  star in sculptor	current cosmological models indicate that the milky way's stellar halo wasassembled from many smaller systems. based on the apparent absence of the mostmetal-poor stars in present-day dwarf galaxies, recent studies claimed that thetrue galactic building blocks must have been vastly different from thesurviving dwarfs. the discovery of an extremely iron-poor star (s1020549) inthe sculptor dwarf galaxy based on a medium-resolution spectrum cast some doubton this conclusion. however, verification of the iron-deficiency andmeasurements of additional elements, such as the alpha-element mg, aremandatory for demonstrating that the same type of stars produced the metalsfound in dwarf galaxies and the galactic halo. only then can dwarf galaxy starsbe conclusively linked to early stellar halo assembly. here we reporthigh-resolution spectroscopic abundances for 11 elements in s1020549,confirming the iron abundance of less than 1/4000th that of the sun, andshowing that the overall abundance pattern mirrors that seen in low-metallicityhalo stars, including the alpha-elements. such chemical similarity indicatesthat the systems destroyed to form the halo billions of years ago were notfundamentally different from the progenitors of present-day dwarfs, andsuggests that the early chemical enrichment of all galaxies may be nearlyidentical.

0707.3998	the spitzer survey of the small magellanic cloud: discovery of embedded  protostars in the hii region ngc 346	we use spitzer space telescope observations from the spitzer survey of thesmall magellanic cloud (s3mc) to study the young stellar content of n66, thelargest and brightest hii region in the smc. in addition to large numbers ofnormal stars, we detect a significant population of bright, red infraredsources that we identify as likely to be young stellar objects (ysos). we usespectral energy distribution (sed) fits to classify objects as ordinary (mainsequence or red giant) stars, asymptotic giant branch stars, backgroundgalaxies, and ysos. this represents the first large-scale attempt at blindsource classification based on spitzer seds in another galaxy. we firmlyidentify at least 61 ysos, with another 50 probable ysos; only one embeddedprotostar in the smc was reported in the literature prior to the s3mc. wepresent color selection criteria that can be used to identify a relativelyclean sample of ysos with irac photometry. our fitted seds indicate that theinfrared-bright ysos in n66 have stellar masses ranging from 2 msun to 17 msun,and that approximately half of the objects are stage ii protostars, with theremaining ysos roughly evenly divided between stage i and stage iii sources. wefind evidence for primordial mass segregation in the hii region, with the mostmassive ysos being preferentially closer to the center than lower-mass objects.despite the low metallicity and dust content of the smc, the observableproperties of the ysos appear consistent with those in the milky way. althoughthe ysos are heavily concentrated within the optically bright central region ofn66, there is ongoing star formation throughout the complex and we place alower limit on the star formation rate of 3.2 x 10^-3 msun/yr over the last ~1myr.

1007.4198	a complete spectroscopic survey of the milky way satellite segue 1: the  darkest galaxy	we present the results of a comprehensive keck/deimos spectroscopic survey ofthe ultra-faint milky way satellite galaxy segue 1. we have obtained velocitymeasurements for 98.2% of the stars within 67 pc (10 arcmin, or 2.3 half-lightradii) of the center of segue 1 that have colors and magnitudes consistent withmembership, down to a magnitude limit of r=21.7. based on photometric,kinematic, and metallicity information, we identify 71 stars as probable segue1 members, including some as far out as 87 pc. after correcting for theinfluence of binary stars using repeated velocity measurements, we determine avelocity dispersion of 3.7^{+1.4}_{-1.1} km/s, with a corresponding mass withinthe half-light radius of 5.8^{+8.2}_{-3.1} x 10^5 msun. the stellar kinematicsof segue 1 require very high mass-to-light ratios unless the system is far fromdynamical equilibrium, even if the period distribution of unresolved binarystars is skewed toward implausibly short periods. with a total luminosity lessthan that of a single bright red giant and a v-band mass-to-light ratio of 3400msun/lsun, segue 1 is the darkest galaxy currently known. we criticallyre-examine recent claims that segue 1 is a tidally disrupting star cluster andthat kinematic samples are contaminated by the sagittarius stream. theextremely low metallicities ([fe/h] &lt; -3) of two segue 1 stars and the largemetallicity spread among the members demonstrate conclusively that segue 1 is adwarf galaxy, and we find no evidence in favor of tidal effects. we also showthat contamination by the sagittarius stream has been overestimated. segue 1has the highest measured dark matter density of any known galaxy and willtherefore be a prime testing ground for dark matter physics and galaxyformation on small scales.

1008.4585	a complete spectroscopic survey of the milky way satellite segue 1: dark  matter content, stellar membership and binary properties from a bayesian  analysis	we introduce a comprehensive analysis of multi-epoch stellar line-of-sightvelocities to determine the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the ultrafaintsatellites of the milky way. our method includes a simultaneous bayesiananalysis of both membership probabilities and the contribution of binaryorbital motion to the observed velocity dispersion within a 14-parameterlikelihood. we apply our method to the segue 1 dwarf galaxy and conclude thatsegue 1 is a dark-matter-dominated galaxy at high probability with an intrinsicvelocity dispersion of 3.7^{+1.4}_{-1.1} km/sec. the dark matter halo requiredto produce this dispersion must have an average density of 2.5^{+4.1}_{-1.9}solar mass/pc^3 within a sphere that encloses half the galaxy's stellarluminosity. this is the highest measured density of dark matter in the localgroup. our results show that a significant fraction of the stars in segue 1 maybe binaries with the most probable mean period close to 10 years, but alsoconsistent with the 180 year mean period seen in the solar vicinity at about 1sigma. despite this binary population, the possibility that segue 1 is a boundstar cluster with the observed velocity dispersion arising from the orbitalmotion of binary stars is disfavored by the multi-epoch stellar velocity dataat greater than 99% c.l. finally, our treatment yields a projected(two-dimensional) half-light radius for the stellar profile of segue 1 of28^{+5}_{-4} pc, in excellent agreement with photometric measurements.

(2011), half of all sne ia with detectable na d absorption at thehost-galaxy redshift in high-resolution spectroscopy have na d line profileswith significant blueshifted absorption relative to the strongest absorptioncomponent, which indicates that a large fraction of sn ia progenitor systemshave strong outflows. in this study, we find that sne ia with blueshiftedcircumstellar/interstellar absorption systematically have higher ejectavelocities and redder colors at maximum brightness relative to the rest of thesn ia population. this result is robust at a 98.9-99.8% confidence level,providing the first link between the progenitor systems and properties of theexplosion. this finding is further evidence that the outflow scenario is thecorrect interpretation of the blueshifted na d absorption, adding additionalconfirmation that some sne ia are produced from a single-degenerate progenitorchannel. an additional implication is that either sn ia progenitor systems havehighly asymmetric outflows that are also aligned with the sn explosion or sneia come from a variety of progenitor systems where sne ia from systems withstrong outflows tend to have more kinetic energy per unit mass than those fromsystems with weak or no outflows.

1209.4653	searching for non-axisymmetries in ngc 6503: a weak end-on bar	the isolation, simple apparent structure, and low luminosity of the nearbyspiral galaxy ngc 6503 make it an ideal candidate for an in-depth kinematic andphotometric study. we introduce a new publicly available code, diskfit, thatimplements procedures for fitting non-axisymmetries in either kinematic orphotometric data. we use diskfit to analyze new halpha and co velocity fielddata as well as hi kinematics from greisen et al. to search for non-circularmotions in the disc of ngc 6503. we find ngc 6503 to have remarkably regulargas kinematics that are well-described by rotation only. we also use diskfitand a new ks-band image of ngc 6503 to constrain photometric models of thedisc, bar and bulge. we find the galaxy to be photometrically dominated by thedisc. we find ngc 6503 to contain a faint bar and an exponential bulge whichtogether contribute only ~5% of the total galaxy light. the combination of ourkinematic and photometric diskfit models suggest that ngc 6503 contains a weak,end-on bar that may have produced its type ii surface brightness profile but isunlikely to be responsible for its strong sigma-drop.

1302.6594	the distribution of alpha elements in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies	the milky way ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (ufds) contain some of the oldest,most metal-poor stars in the universe. we present [mg/fe], [si/fe], [ca/fe],[ti/fe], and mean [alpha/fe], abundance ratios for 61 individual red giantbranch stars across 8 ufds. this is the largest sample of alpha abundancespublished to date in galaxies with absolute magnitudes m_v &gt; -8, including thefirst measurements for segue 1, canes venatici ii, ursa major i, and leo t.abundances were determined via medium-resolution keck/deimos spectroscopy andspectral synthesis. the sample spans the metallicity range -3.4 &lt; [fe/h] &lt;-1.1. with the possible exception of segue 1 and ursa major ii, the individualufds show on average lower [alpha/fe] at higher metallicities, consistent withenrichment from type ia supernovae. thus even the faintest galaxies haveundergone at least a limited level of chemical self-enrichment. together withrecent photometric studies, this suggests that star formation in the ufds wasnot a single burst, but instead lasted at least as much as the minimum timedelay of the onset of type ia supernovae (~100 myr) and less than ~2 gyr. wefurther show that the combined population of ufds has an [alpha/fe] abundancepattern that is inconsistent with a flat, galactic halo-like alpha abundancetrend, and is also qualitatively different from that of the more luminous cvn idsph, which does show a hint of a plateau at very low [fe/h].

1305.4954	dusty ob stars in the small magellanic cloud - ii: extragalactic disks  or examples of the pleiades phenomenon?	we use mid-infrared spitzer spectroscopy and far-infrared herschel photometryfor a sample of twenty main sequence o9--b2 stars in the small magellanic cloud(smc) with strong 24 micron excesses to investigate the origin of the mid-iremission. either debris disks around the stars or illuminated patches of denseinterstellar medium (ism) can cause such mid-ir emission. in a companion paper,paper i, we use optical spectroscopy to show that it is unlikely for any ofthese sources to be classical be stars or herbig ae/be stars. we focus ouranalysis on debris disks and cirrus hot spots. we find three out of twentystars to be significantly extended in the mid-ir, establishing them as cirrushot spots. we then fit the ir spectral energy distributions to determine dusttemperatures and masses. we find the dust masses in the smc stars to be largerthan for any known debris disks, although this evidence against the debris diskhypothesis is circumstantial. finally, we created a local comparison sample ofbright mid-ir ob stars in the milky way (mw) by cross-matching the wise andhipparcos catalogs. all such local stars in the appropriate luminosity rangethat can be unambiguously classified are young stars with optical emissionlines or are spatially resolved by wise with sizes too large to be plausibledebris disk candidates. we conclude that the very strong mid-ir flux excessesare most likely explained as cirrus hot spots, although we cannot rigorouslyrule out that a small fraction of the sample is made up of debris disks ortransition disks. we present suggestive evidence that bow-shock heating aroundrunaway stars may be a contributing mechanism to the interstellar emission.these sources, interpreted as cirrus hot spots, offer a new localised probe ofdiffuse interstellar dust in a low metallicity environment.

1307.2894	a mass-dependent yield origin of neutron-capture element abundance  distributions in ultra-faint dwarfs	one way to constrain the nature of the high-redshift progenitors of the milkyway is to look at the low-metallicity stellar populations of the differentgalactic components today. for example, high-resolution spectroscopy of verymetal poor (vmp) stars demonstrates remarkable agreement between thedistribution of [ti/fe] in the stellar populations of the milky way halo (mw)and ultra-faint dwarf (ufd) galaxies. in contrast, for the neutron capture (nc)abundance ratio distributions [(sr,ba)/fe], the peak of the small ufd sample (6stars) exhibits a signicant under-abundance relative to the vmp stars in thelarger mw halo sample (~ 300 stars). we present a simple scenario that cansimultaneously explain these similarities and differences by assuming: (i) thatthe mw vmp stars were predominately enriched by a prior generation of starswhich possessed a higher total mass than the prior generation of stars thatenriched the ufd vmp stars; and (ii) a much stronger mass-dependent yield (mdy)for nc-elements than for the (known) mdy for ti. simple statistical testsdemonstrate that conditions (i) and (ii) are consistent with the observedabundance distributions, albeit without strong constraints on model parameters.a comparison of the broad constraints for these nc-mdy with those derived inthe literature seems to rule out ba production from low-mass sns and affirmsmodels that primarily generate yields from high-mass sn. our scenario can beconfirmed by a relatively modest (factor of ~ 3-4) increase in the number ofhigh-resolution spectra of vmp stars in ufds.

1308.3899	a statistical analysis of circumstellar material in type ia supernovae	a key tracer of the elusive progenitor systems of type ia supernovae (sne ia)is the detection of narrow blueshifted time-varying na i d absorption lines,interpreted as evidence of circumstellar material (csm) surrounding theprogenitor system. the origin of this material is controversial, but thesimplest explanation is that it results from previous mass loss in a systemcontaining a white dwarf and a non-degenerate companion star. we present newsingle-epoch intermediate-resolution spectra of 17 low-redshift sne ia takenwith xshooter on the eso very large telescope. combining this sample withevents from the literature, we confirm an excess (~20 per cent) of sne iadisplaying blueshifted narrow na i d absorption features compared tonon-blueshifted na i d features. the host galaxies of sne ia displayingblueshifted absorption profiles are skewed towards later-type galaxies,compared to sne ia that show no na i d absorption, and sne ia displayingblueshifted narrow na i d absorption features have broader light curves. thestrength of the na i d absorption is stronger in sne ia displaying blueshiftedna i d absorption features than those without blueshifted features, and thestrength of the blueshifted na i d is correlated with the b-v colour of the snat maximum light. this strongly suggests the absorbing material is local to thesn. in the context of the progenitor systems of sne ia, we discuss thesignificance of these findings and other recent observational evidence on thenature of sn ia progenitors. we present a summary that suggests there are atleast two distinct populations of normal, cosmologically useful sne ia.

1311.0147	on the source of the dust extinction in type ia supernovae and the  discovery of anomalously strong na i absorption	high-dispersion observations of the na i d 5890, 5896 and k i 7665, 7699interstellar lines, and the diffuse interstellar band at 5780 angstroms in thespectra of 32 type ia supernovae are used as an independent means of probingdust extinction. we show that the dust extinction of the objects where thediffuse interstellar band at 5780 angstroms is detected is consistent with thevisual extinction derived from the supernova colors. this strongly suggeststhat the dust producing the extinction is predominantly located in theinterstellar medium of the host galaxies and not in circumstellar materialassociated with the progenitor system. one quarter of the supernovae displayanomalously large na i column densities in comparison to the amount of dustextinction derived from their colors. remarkably, all of the cases of unusuallystrong na i d absorption correspond to "blueshifted" profiles in theclassification scheme of sternberg et al. (2011). this coincidence suggeststhat outflowing circumstellar gas is responsible for at least some of the casesof anomalously large na i column densities. two supernovae with unusuallystrong na i d absorption showed essentially normal k i column densities for thedust extinction implied by their colors, but this does not appear to be auniversal characteristic. overall, we find the most accurate predictor ofindividual supernova extinction to be the equivalent width of the diffuseinterstellar band at 5780 angstroms, and provide an empirical relation for itsuse. finally, we identify ways of producing significant enhancements of the naabundance of circumstellar material in both the single-degenerate anddouble-degenerate scenarios for the progenitor system.

(2010), high-resolution spectra have now beenobtained for every red giant in segue 1. remarkably, three of these seven starshave metallicities below [fe/h] = -3.5, suggesting that segue 1 is the leastchemically evolved galaxy known. we confirm previous medium-resolution analysesdemonstrating that segue 1 stars span a metallicity range of more than 2 dex,from [fe/h] = -1.4 to [fe/h] = -3.8. all of the segue 1 stars arealpha-enhanced, with [alpha/fe] ~ 0.5. high alpha-element abundances aretypical for metal-poor stars, but in every previously studied galaxy [alpha/fe]declines for more metal-rich stars, which is typically interpreted as ironenrichment from supernova ia. the absence of this signature in segue 1indicates that it was enriched exclusively by massive stars. other lightelement abundance ratios in segue 1, including carbon-enhancement in the threemost metal-poor stars, closely resemble those of metal-poor halo stars.finally, we classify the most metal-rich star as a ch star given its largeoverabundances of carbon and s-process elements. the other six stars showremarkably low neutron-capture element abundances of [sr/h] &lt; -4.9 and [ba/h] &lt;-4.2, which are comparable to the lowest levels ever detected in halo stars.this suggests minimal neutron-capture enrichment, perhaps limited to a singler-process or weak s-process synthesizing event. altogether, the chemicalabundances of segue 1 indicate no substantial chemical evolution, supportingthe idea that it may be a surviving first galaxy that experienced only oneburst of star formation.

1405.4854	dwarf galaxy dark matter density profiles inferred from stellar and gas  kinematics	we present new constraints on the density profiles of dark matter (dm) halosin seven nearby dwarf galaxies from measurements of their integrated stellarlight and gas kinematics. the gas kinematics of low mass galaxies frequentlysuggest that they contain constant density dm cores, while n-body simulationsinstead predict a cuspy profile. we present a data set of high resolutionintegral field spectroscopy on seven galaxies and measure the stellar and gaskinematics simultaneously. using jeans modeling on our full sample, we examinewhether gas kinematics in general produce shallower density profiles than arederived from the stars. although 2/7 galaxies show some localized differencesin their rotation curves between the two tracers, estimates of the centrallogarithmic slope of the dm density profile, gamma, are generally robust. themean and standard deviation of the logarithmic slope for the population aregamma=0.67+/-0.10 when measured in the stars and gamma=0.58+/-0.24 whenmeasured in the gas. we also find that the halos are not under concentrated atthe radii of half their maximum velocities. finally, we search for correlationsof the dm density profile with stellar velocity anisotropy and other baryonicproperties. two popular mechanisms to explain cored dm halos are an exotic dmcomponent or feedback models that strongly couple the energy of supernovae intorepeatedly driving out gas and dynamically heating the dm halos. we investigatecorrelations that may eventually be used to test models. we do not find asecondary parameter that strongly correlates with the central dm density slope,but we do find some weak correlations. determining the importance of thesecorrelations will require further model developments and larger observationalsamples.

1504.00021	a megacam survey of outer halo satellites. iv. two foreground  populations possibly associated with the monoceros substructure in the  direction of ngc2419 and koposov2	the origin of the galactic halo stellar structure known as the monoceros ringis still under debate. in this work, we study that halo substructure using deepcfht wide-field photometry obtained for the globular clusters ngc2419 andkoposov2, where the presence of monoceros becomes significant because of theircoincident projected position. using sloan digital sky survey photometry andspectroscopy in the area surrounding these globulars and beyond, where the samemonoceros population is detected, we conclude that a second feature, not likelyto be associated with milky way disk stars along the line-of-sight, is presentas foreground population. our analysis suggests that the monoceros ring mightbe composed of an old stellar population of age t ~ 9gyr and a new component ~4gyr younger at the same heliocentric distance. alternatively, this detectionmight be associated with a second wrap of monoceros in that direction of thesky and also indicate a metallicity spread in the ring. the detection of such alow-density feature in other sections of this halo substructure will shed lighton its nature.

astro-ph;0307154	high-resolution measurements of the dark matter halo of ngc 2976:  evidence for a shallow density profile	we have obtained two-dimensional velocity fields of the dwarf spiral galaxyngc 2976 in halpha and co. the high spatial (~75 pc) and spectral (13 km/s and2 km/s, respectively) resolution of these observations, along with ourmulticolor optical and near-infrared imaging, allow us to measure the shape ofthe density profile of the dark matter halo with good precision. we find thatthe total (baryonic plus dark matter) mass distribution of ngc 2976 follows arho_tot ~ r^(-0.27 +/- 0.09) power law out to a radius of 1.8 kpc, assumingthat the observed radial motions provide no support. the density profileattributed to the dark halo is even shallower, consistent with a nearlyconstant density of dark matter over the entire observed region. a maximal diskfit yields an upper limit to the k-band stellar mass-to-light ratio (m*/l_k) of0.09^{+0.15}_{-0.08} m_sun/l_sun,k (including systematic uncertainties), withthe caveat that for m*/l_k &gt; 0.19 m_sun/l_sun,k the dark matter densityincreases with radius, which is unphysical. assuming 0.10 m_sun/l_sun,k &lt;m*/l_k &lt; 0.19 m_sun/l_sun,k, the dark matter density profile lies betweenrho_dm ~ r^-0.17 and rho_dm ~ r^-0.01. therefore, independent of anyassumptions about the stellar disk or the functional form of the densityprofile, ngc 2976 does not contain a cuspy dark matter halo. we alsoinvestigate some of the systematic effects that can hamper rotation curvestudies, and show that 1) longslit rotation curves are far more vulnerable tosystematic errors than two-dimensional velocity fields, 2) ngc 2976 containslarge radial motions at small radii, and 3) the halpha and co velocity fieldsof ngc 2976 agree within their uncertainties.

0808.3772	a common mass scale for satellite galaxies of the milky way	the milky way has at least twenty-three known satellite galaxies that shinewith luminosities ranging from about a thousand to a billion times that of thesun. half of these galaxies were discovered in the past few years in the sloandigital sky survey, and they are among the least luminous galaxies in the knownuniverse. a determination of the mass of these galaxies provides a test ofgalaxy formation at the smallest scales and probes the nature of the darkmatter that dominates the mass density of the universe. here we use newmeasurements of the velocities of the stars in these galaxies to show that theyare consistent with them having a common mass of about 10^7 m_\odot withintheir central 300 parsecs. this result demonstrates that the faintest of themilky way satellites are the most dark matter-dominated galaxies known, andcould be a hint of a new scale in galaxy formation or a characteristic scalefor the clustering of dark matter.

astro-ph;0412035	high-resolution measurements of the halos of four dark matter-dominated  galaxies: deviations from a universal density profile	we derive rotation curves for four nearby, low-mass spiral galaxies and usethem to constrain the shapes of their dark matter density profiles. thisanalysis is based on high-resolution two-dimensional halpha velocity fields ofngc 4605, ngc 5949, ngc 5963, and ngc 6689 and co velocity fields of ngc 4605and ngc 5963. in combination with our previous study of ngc 2976, the fullsample of five galaxies contains density profiles that span the range fromalpha_dm = 0 to alpha_dm = 1.20, where alpha_dm is the power law indexdescribing the central density profile. the scatter in alpha_dm from galaxy togalaxy is 0.44, three times as large as in cold dark matter (cdm) simulations,and the mean density profile slope is alpha_dm = 0.73, shallower than thatpredicted by the simulations. these results call into question the hypothesisthat all galaxies share a universal dark matter density profile. we show thatone of the galaxies in our sample, ngc 5963, has a cuspy density profile thatclosely resembles those seen in cdm simulations, demonstrating that whilegalaxies with the steep central density cusps predicted by cdm do exist, theyare in the minority. in spite of these differences between observations andsimulations, the relatively cuspy density profiles we find do not suggest thatthis problem represents a crisis for cdm. improving the resolution of thesimulations and incorporating additional physics may resolve the remainingdiscrepancies. we also find that four of the galaxies contain detectable radialmotions in the plane of the galaxy. we investigate the hypothesis that thesemotions are caused by a triaxial dark matter halo, and place lower limits onthe ellipticity of the orbits in the plane of the disk of 0.043 - 0.175.

astro-ph;0502302	the molecular ism of dwarf galaxies on kiloparsec scales: a new survey  for co in northern, iras-detected dwarf galaxies	we present a new survey for co in dwarf galaxies using the kitt peak 12mtelescope. we observed the central regions of 121 northern dwarfs with irasdetections and no known co emission. we detect co in 28 of these galaxies andmarginally detect another 16, increasing by about 50% the number of suchgalaxies known to have significant co emission. the galaxies we detect arecomparable in mass to the lmc, although somewhat brighter in co and fainter inthe fir. within dwarfs, we find that the co luminosity, l_co, is most stronglycorrelated with the k-band and the far infrared luminosities. there are alsostrong correlations with the radio continuum and b-band luminosities, andlinear diameter. we suggest that l_co and l_k correlate well because thestellar component of a galaxy dominates the midplane gravitational field andthus sets the pressure of the atomic gas, which controls the formation of h_2from hi. we compare our sample with more massive galaxies and find that dwarfsand large galaxies obey the same relationship between co and the 1.4 ghz radiocontinuum (rc) surface brightness. this relationship is well described by aschmidt law with sigma_rc proportional to sigma_co^1.3. therefore, dwarfgalaxies and large spirals exhibit the same relationship between molecular gasand star formation rate (sfr). we find that this result is robust to moderatechanges in the rc-to-sfr and co-to-h_2 conversion factors. our data appear tobe inconsistent with large (order of magnitude) variations in the co-to-h_2conversion factor in the star forming molecular gas.

0809.0601	the chemical abundances of tycho g in supernova remnant 1572	we present an analysis of the chemical abundances of the star tycho g in thedirection of the remnant of supernova (sn) 1572, based on keck high-resolutionoptical spectra. the stellar parameters of this star are found to be those of ag-type subgiant with $t_{\mathrm{eff}} = 5900 \pm 100$ k, \loggl $ = 3.85 \pm0.30$ dex, and $\mathrm{[fe/h]} = -0.05 \pm 0.09$. this determination agreeswith the stellar parameters derived for the star in a previous survey for thepossible companion star of sn 1572 (ruiz-lapuente et al. 2004). the chemicalabundances follow the galactic trends, except for ni, which is overabundantrelative to fe, $[{\rm ni/fe}] $ $=$ 0.16 $\pm$ 0.04. co is slightlyoverabundant (at a low significance level). these enhancements in fe-peakelements could have originated from pollution by the supernova ejecta. we finda surprisingly high li abundance for a star that has evolved away from the mainsequence. we discuss these findings in the context of companion stars ofsupernovae.

astro-ph;0603834	infrared sources in the small magellanic cloud: first results	we have imaged the entire small magellanic cloud (smc), one of the twonearest star-forming dwarf galaxies, in all seven irac and mips bands. the lowmass and low metallicity (1/6 solar) of the smc make it the best local analogfor primitive galaxies at high redshift. by studying the properties of dust andstar formation in the smc at high resolution, we can gain understanding ofsimilar distant galaxies that can only be observed in much less detail. in thiscontribution, we present a preliminary analysis of the properties of pointsources detected in the spitzer survey of the small magellanic cloud (s^3mc).we find ~400,000 unresolved or marginally resolved sources in our irac images,and our mips 24 micron mosaic contains ~17,000 point sources. source countsdecline rapidly at the longer mips wavelengths. we use color-color andcolor-magnitude diagrams to investigate the nature of these objects,cross-correlate their positions with those of known sources at otherwavelengths, and show examples of how these data can be used to identifyinteresting classes of objects such as carbon stars and young stellar objects.for additional examples of some of the questions that can be studied with thesedata, please see the accompanying contributions by the other members of ourteam. the mosaic images and point source catalogs we have made have beenreleased to the public on our website (http://celestial.berkeley.edu/spitzer).

astro-ph;0606570	is there a fundamental line for disk galaxies?	we show that there are strong local correlations between metallicity, surfacebrightness, and dynamical mass-to-light ratio within m33, analogous to thefundamental line of dwarf galaxies identified by prada &amp; burkert (2002). usingnear-infrared imaging from 2mass, the published rotation curve of m33, andliterature measurements of the metallicities of hii regions and supergiantstars, we demonstrate that these correlations hold for points at radialdistances between 140 pc and 6.2 kpc from the center of the galaxy. at a givenmetallicity or surface brightness, m33 has a mass-to-light ratio approximatelyfour times as large as the local group dwarf galaxies; other than this constantoffset, we see broad agreement between the m33 and dwarf galaxy data. we useanalytical arguments to show that at least two of the three fundamental linecorrelations are basic properties of disk galaxies that can be derived fromvery general assumptions. we investigate the effect of supernova feedback onthe fundamental line with numerical models and conclude that while feedbackclearly controls the scatter in the fundamental line, it is not needed tocreate the fundamental line itself, in agreement with our analyticalcalculations. we also compare the m33 data with measurements of a simulateddisk galaxy, finding that the simulation reproduces the trends in the datacorrectly and matches the fundamental line, although the metallicity of thesimulated galaxy is too high, and the surface brightness is lower than that ofm33.

astro-ph;0608561	the spitzer survey of the small magellanic cloud: s3mc imaging and  photometry in the mid- and far-infrared wavebands	we present the initial results from the spitzer survey of the smallmagellanic cloud (s3mc), which imaged the star-forming body of the smallmagellanic cloud (smc) in all seven mips and irac wavebands. we find that thef_8/f_24 ratio (an estimate of pah abundance) has large spatial variations andtakes a wide range of values that are unrelated to metallicity butanticorrelated with 24 um brightness and f_24/f_70 ratio. this suggests thatphotodestruction is primarily responsible for the low abundance of pahsobserved in star-forming low-metallicity galaxies. we use the s3mc images tocompile a photometric catalog of ~400,000 mid- and far-infrared point sourcesin the smc. the sources detected at the longest wavelengths fall into four maincategories: 1) bright 5.8 um sources with very faint optical counterparts andvery red mid-infrared colors ([5.8]-[8.0]&gt;1.2), which we identify as ysos. 2)bright mid-infrared sources with mildly red colors (0.16&lt;[5.8]-[8.0]&lt;0.6),identified as carbon stars. 3) bright mid-infrared sources with neutral colorsand bright optical counterparts, corresponding to oxygen-rich evolved stars.and, 4) unreddened early b stars (b3 to o9) with a large 24 um excess. thisexcess is reminiscent of debris disks, and is detected in only a small fractionof these stars (&lt;5%). the majority of the brightest infrared point sources inthe smc fall into groups one to three. we use this photometric information toproduce a catalog of 282 bright ysos in the smc with a very low level ofcontamination (~7%).

0706.0516	the kinematics of the ultra-faint milky way satellites: solving the  missing satellite problem	we present keck/deimos spectroscopy of stars in 8 of the newly discoveredultra-faint dwarf galaxies around the milky way. we measure the velocitydispersions of canes venatici i and ii, ursa major i and ii, coma berenices,hercules, leo iv and leo t from the velocities of 18 - 214 stars in each galaxyand find dispersions ranging from 3.3 to 7.6 km/s. the 6 galaxies with absolutemagnitudes m_v &lt; -4 are highly dark matter-dominated, with mass-to-light ratiosapproaching 1000. the measured velocity dispersions are inversely correlatedwith their luminosities, indicating that a minimum mass for luminous galacticsystems may not yet have been reached. we also measure the metallicities of theobserved stars and find that the 6 brightest of the ultra-faint dwarfs extendthe luminosity-metallicity relationship followed by brighter dwarfs by 2 ordersof magnitude in luminosity; several of these objects have mean metallicities aslow as [fe/h] = -2.3 and therefore represent some of the most metal-poor knownstellar systems. we detect metallicity spreads of up to 0.5 dex in severalobjects, suggesting multiple star formation epochs. having established themasses of the ultra-faint dwarfs, we re-examine the missing satellite problem.after correcting for the sky coverage of the sdss, we find that the ultra-faintdwarfs substantially alleviate the discrepancy between the predicted andobserved numbers of satellites around the milky way, but there are still afactor of ~4 too few dwarf galaxies over a significant range of masses. we showthat if galaxy formation in low-mass dark matter halos is strongly suppressedafter reionization, the simulated circular velocity function of cdm subhaloscan be brought into approximate agreement with the observed circular velocityfunction of milky way satellite galaxies.
