0902.4039	continuous frequency spectrum of the global hydromagnetic oscillations  of a magnetically confined mountain on an accreting neutron star	we compute the continuous part of the ideal-magnetohydrodynamic (ideal-mhd)frequency spectrum of a polar mountain produced by magnetic burial on anaccreting neutron star. applying the formalism developed by hellsten &amp; spies(1979), extended to include gravity, we solve the singular eigenvalue problemsubject to line-tying boundary conditions. this spectrum divides into analfv\'{e}n part and a cusp part. the eigenfunctions are chirped and anharmonicwith an exponential envelope, and the eigenfrequencies cover the whole spectrumabove a minimum $\omega_\mathrm{low}$. for equilibria with accreted mass $1.2\times 10^{-6} \la m_a/m_\odot \la 1.7 \times 10^{-4}$ and surface magneticfields $10^{11} \la b_\ast/\mathrm{g} \la 10^{13}$, $\omega_\mathrm{low}$ isapproximately independent of $b_\ast$, and increases with $m_a$. the resultsare consistent with the alfv\'{e}n spectrum excited in numerical simulationswith the \textsc{zeus-mp} solver. the spectrum is modified substantially by thecoriolis force in neutron stars spinning faster than $\sim 100$ hz. theimplications for gravitational wave searches for low-mass x-ray binaries areconsidered briefly.

0902.4264	improved estimate of the detectability of gravitational radiation from a  magnetically confined mountain on an accreting neutron star	we give an improved estimate of the detectability of gravitational waves frommagnetically confined mountains on accreting neutron stars. the improvedestimate includes the following effects for the first time: three-dimensionalhydromagnetic ("fast") relaxation, three-dimensional resistive ("slow")relaxation, realistic accreted masses $m_a \la 2 \times 10^{-3} m_\odot$,(where the mountain is grown ab initio by injection), and verification of thecurvature rescaling transformation employed in previous work. typically, amountain does not relax appreciably over the lifetime of a low-mass x-raybinary. the ellipticity reaches $\epsilon \approx 2 \times 10^{-5}$ for$m_a=2\times 10^{-3} m_\odot$. the gravitational wave spectrum for triaxialequilibria contains an additional line, which, although weak, provides valuableinformation about the mountain shape. we evaluate the detectability of magneticmountains with initial and advanced ligo. for a standard, coherent matchedfilter search, we find a signal-to-noise ratio of $d = 28 (m_a/10^{-4} m_\odot)  (1+5.5 m_a/10^{-4} m_\odot)^{-1} (d/10 \mathrm{kpc})^{-1} (t_0/14  \mathrm{d})^{1/2}$ for initial ligo, where $d$ is the distance and $t_0$ isthe observation time. from the nondetection of gravitational waves fromlow-mass x-ray binaries to date, and the wave strain limits implied by the spinfrequency distribution of these objects (due to gravitational wave braking), weconclude that there are other, as yet unmodelled, physical effects that furtherreduce he quadrupole moment of a magnetic mountain, most notably sinking intothe crust.

0902.4484	resistive relaxation of a magnetically confined mountain on an accreting  neutron star	three-dimensional numerical magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) simulations areperformed to investigate how a magnetically confined mountain on an accretingneutron star relaxes resistively. no evidence is found for non-ideal mhdinstabilities on a short time-scale, such as the resistive ballooning mode orthe tearing mode. instead, the mountain relaxes gradually as matter istransported across magnetic surfaces on the diffusion time-scale, whichevaluates to $\tau_\mathrm{i} \sim 10^5 - 10^8$ yr (depending on theconductivity of the neutron star crust) for an accreted mass of $m_a = 1.2\times 10^{-4} m_\odot$. the magnetic dipole moment simultaneously reemerges asthe screening currents dissipate over $\tau_\mathrm{i}$. for nonaxisymmetricmountains, ohmic dissipation tends to restore axisymmetry by magneticreconnection at a filamentary neutral sheet in the equatorial plane. ideal-mhdoscillations on the alfv\'{e}n time-scale, which can be excited by externalinfluences, such as variations in the accretion torque, compress the magneticfield and hence decrease $\tau_\mathrm{i}$ by \change{one order of magnitude}relative to its standard value (as computed for the static configuration). theimplications of long-lived mountains for gravitational wave emission fromlow-mass x-ray binaries are briefly explored.

0908.3824	search for gravitational-wave bursts associated with gamma-ray bursts  using data from ligo science run 5 and virgo science run 1	we present the results of a search for gravitational-wave bursts associatedwith 137 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) that were detected by satellite-basedgamma-ray experiments during the fifth ligo science run and first virgo sciencerun. the data used in this analysis were collected from 2005 november 4 to 2007october 1, and most of the grb triggers were from the swift satellite. thesearch uses a coherent network analysis method that takes into account thedifferent locations and orientations of the interferometers at the threeligo-virgo sites. we find no evidence for gravitational-wave burst signalsassociated with this sample of grbs. using simulated short-duration (&lt;1 s)waveforms, we set upper limits on the amplitude of gravitational wavesassociated with each grb. we also place lower bounds on the distance to eachgrb under the assumption of a fixed energy emission in gravitational waves,with typical limits of d ~ 15 mpc (e_gw^iso / 0.01 m_o c^2)^1/2 for emission atfrequencies around 150 hz, where the ligo-virgo detector network has bestsensitivity. we present astrophysical interpretations and implications of theseresults, and prospects for corresponding searches during future ligo-virgoruns.

0911.1609	gravitational radiation from hydrodynamic turbulence in a differentially  rotating neutron star	(abridged.) the mean-square current quadrupole moment associated withvorticity fluctuations in high-reynolds-number turbulence in a differentiallyrotating neutron star is calculated analytically, as are the amplitude anddecoherence time of the resulting, stochastic gravitational wave signal. thecalculation resolves the subtle question of whether the signal is dominated bythe smallest or largest turbulent eddies: for the kolmogorov-like powerspectrum observed in superfluid spherical couette simulations, the wave strainis controlled by the largest eddies, and the decoherence time approximatelyequals the maximum eddy turnover time. for a neutron star with spin frequency$\nu_s$ and rossby number $ro$, at a distance $d$ from earth, theroot-mean-square wave strain reaches $h_{rms} \approx 3\times 10^{-24} ro^3(\nu_s / 30 hz)^3 (d/1 kpc)^{-1}$. a cross-correlation search can detect such asource in principle, because the signal decoheres over the time-scale $\tau_c\approx 10^{-3} ro^{-1} (\nu_s / 30 hz)^{-1} s$, which is adequately sampled byexisting long-baseline interferometers. hence hydrodynamic turbulence imposes afundamental noise floor on gravitational wave observations of neutron stars,although its polluting effect may be muted by partial decoherence in thehectohertz band, where current continuous-wave searches are concentrated, forthe highest frequency (and hence most powerful) sources.

1003.2480	predictions for the rates of compact binary coalescences observable by  ground-based gravitational-wave detectors	we present an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the rates for all types ofcompact binary coalescence sources detectable by the initial and advancedversions of the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors ligo and virgo.astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a numberof assumptions and unknown model parameters, and are still uncertain. the mostconfident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binaryneutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars inour galaxy. these yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 per myr per milky wayequivalent galaxy (mweg), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 permyr per mweg to 1000 per myr per mweg. we convert coalescence rates intodetection rates based on data from the ligo s5 and virgo vsr2 science runs andprojected sensitivities for our advanced detectors. using the detectorsensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02per year for initial ligo-virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between0.0002 and 0.2 per year. the likely binary neutron-star detection rate for theadvanced ligo-virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a rangebetween 0.4 and 400 per year.

1010.2816	stokes tomography of radio pulsar magnetospheres. i. linear polarization	polarimetric studies of pulsar radio emission traditionally concentrate onhow the stokes vector (i, q, u, v) varies with pulse longitude, with specialemphasis on the position angle (pa) swing of the linearly polarized component.the interpretation of the pa swing in terms of the rotating vector model islimited by the assumption of an axisymmetric magnetic field and the degeneracyof the output with respect to the orientation and magnetic geometry of thepulsar; different combinations of the latter two properties can produce similarpa swings. this paper introduces stokes phase portraits as a supplementarydiagnostic tool with which the orientation and magnetic geometry can beinferred more accurately. the stokes phase portraits feature unique patterns inthe i-q, i-u, and q-u planes, whose shapes depend sensitively on the magneticgeometry, inclination angle, beam and polarization patterns, and emissionaltitude. we construct look-up tables of stokes phase portraits and pa swingsfor pure and current-modified dipole fields, filled core and hollow cone beams,and two empirical linear polarization models, l/i = \cos \theta_0 and l/i =\sin \theta_0, where \theta_0 is the colatitude of the emission point. wecompare our look-up tables to the measured phase portraits of 24 pulsars in theeuropean pulsar network online database. we find evidence in 60% of the objectsthat the radio emission region may depart significantly from low altitudes,even when the pa swing is s-shaped and/or the pulse-width-period relation iswell satisfied. on the other hand, the data are explained adequately if theemission altitude exceeds ~10% of the light cylinder radius. we conclude thatstokes phase portraits should be analysed concurrently with the pa swing andpulse profiles in future when interpreting radio pulsar polarization data.

1104.1016	stokes tomography of radio pulsar magnetospheres. ii. millisecond  pulsars	the radio polarization characteristics of millisecond pulsars (msps) differsignificantly from those of non-recycled pulsars. in particular, the positionangle (pa) swings of many msps deviate from the s-shape predicted by therotating vector model, even after relativistic aberration is accounted for,indicating that they have non-dipolar magnetic geometries, likely due to ahistory of accretion. stokes tomography uses phase portraits of the stokesparameters as a diagnostic tool to infer a pulsar's magnetic geometry andorientation. this paper applies stokes tomography to msps, generalizing thetechnique to handle interpulse emission. we present an atlas of look-up tablesfor the stokes phase portraits and pa swings of msps with current-modifieddipole fields, filled core and hollow cone beams, and two empirical linearpolarization models. we compare our look-up tables to data from 15 msps andfind that the stokes phase portraits for a current-modified dipoleapproximately match several msps whose pa swings are flat or irregular andcannot be reconciled with the standard axisymmetric rotating vector model. psrj1939+2134 and psr j0437$-$4715 are modelled in detail. the data from psrj1939+2134 at 0.61\,ghz can be fitted well with a current-modified dipole at$(\alpha, i) = (22 \pm 2^\circ, 80 \pm 1^\circ)$ and emission altitude 0.4$r_\text{lc}$. the fit is less accurate for psr j1939+2134 at 1.414\,ghz, andfor psr j0437$-$4715 at 1.44\,ghz, indicating that these objects may have amore complicated magnetic field geometry, such as a localized surface anomalyor a polar magnetic mountain.

1104.2712	beating the spin-down limit on gravitational wave emission from the vela  pulsar	we present direct upper limits on continuous gravitational wave emission fromthe vela pulsar using data from the virgo detector's second science run. theseupper limits have been obtained using three independent methods that assume thegravitational wave emission follows the radio timing. two of the methodsproduce frequentist upper limits for an assumed known orientation of the star'sspin axis and value of the wave polarization angle of, respectively,$1.9\ee{-24}$ and $2.2\ee{-24}$, with 95% confidence. the third method, underthe same hypothesis, produces a bayesian upper limit of $2.1\ee{-24}$, with 95%degree of belief. these limits are below the indirect {\it spin-down limit} of$3.3\ee{-24}$ for the vela pulsar, defined by the energy loss rate inferredfrom observed decrease in vela's spin frequency, and correspond to a limit onthe star ellipticity of $\sim 10^{-3}$. slightly less stringent results, butstill well below the spin-down limit, are obtained assuming the star's spinaxis inclination and the wave polarization angles are unknown.

0710.1021	avalanche dynamics of radio pulsar glitches	we test statistically the hypothesis that radio pulsar glitches result froman avalanche process, in which angular momentum is transferred erratically fromthe flywheel-like superfluid in the star to the slowly decelerating, solidcrust via spatially connected chains of local, impulsive, threshold-activatedevents, so that the system fluctuates around a self-organised critical state.analysis of the glitch population (currently 285 events from 101 pulsars)demonstrates that the size distribution in individual pulsars is consistentwith being scale invariant, as expected for an avalanche process. thewaiting-time distribution is consistent with being exponential in seven out ofnine pulsars where it can be measured reliably, after adjusting forobservational limits on the minimum waiting time, as for a constant-ratepoisson process. psr j0537$-$6910 and psr j0835$-$4510 are the exceptions;their waiting-time distributions show evidence of quasiperiodicity. in eachobject, stationarity requires that the rate $\lambda$ equals $- \epsilon\dot{\nu} / &lt;\delta\nu&gt;$, where $\dot{\nu}$ is the angular acceleration of thecrust, $&lt;\delta\nu&gt;$ is the mean glitch size, and $\epsilon\dot{\nu}$ is therelative angular acceleration of the crust and superfluid. there is no evidencethat $\lambda$ changes monotonically with spin-down age. the rate distributionitself is fitted reasonably well by an exponential for $\lambda \geq 0.25 {\rmyr^{-1}}$. for $\lambda &lt; 0.25 {\rm yr^{-1}}$, its exact form is unknown; theexponential overestimates the number of glitching pulsars observed at low$\lambda$, where the limited total observation time exercises a selection bias.

1203.4466	gravitational-wave bursts and stochastic background from superfluid  vortex avalanches during pulsar glitches	the current-quadrupole gravitational-wave signal emitted during the spin-upphase of a pulsar glitch is calculated from first principles by modeling thevortex dynamics observed in recent gross-pitaevskii simulations of pinned,decelerating quantum condensates. homogeneous and inhomogeneous unpinninggeometries, representing creep- and avalanche-like glitches, provide lower andupper bounds on the gravitational wave signal strength respectively. the signalarising from homogeneous glitches is found to scale with the square root ofglitch size, whereas the signal from inhomogeneous glitches scales proportionalto glitch size. the signal is also computed as a function of vortex traveldistance and stellar angular velocity. convenient amplitude scalings arederived as functions of these parameters. for the typical astrophysicalsituation, where the glitch duration (in units of the spin period) is largecompared to the vortex travel distance (in units of the stellar radius), anindividual glitch from an object $1\,\rm{kpc}$ from earth generates a wavestrain of $10^{-24} [(\delta\omega/\omega) / 10^{-7}] (\omega/10^2 \rm{rads}^{-1})^3 (\delta r / 10^{-2} \rm{m})^{-1}$, where $\delta r$ is the averagedistance travelled by a vortex during a glitch, $\delta\omega/\omega$ is thefractional glitch size, and $\omega$ is the pulsar angular velocity. thenon-detection of a signal from the 2006 vela glitch in data from the fifthscience run conducted by the laser interferometer gravitational-waveobservatory implies that the glitch duration exceeds $\sim 10^{-4}\,\rm{ms}$.this represents the first observational lower bound on glitch duration to beobtained.

1207.7176	einstein@home all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves in ligo s5  data	this paper presents results of an all-sky searches for periodic gravitationalwaves in the frequency range [50, 1190] hz and with frequency derivative rangesof [-2 x 10^-9, 1.1 x 10^-10] hz/s for the fifth ligo science run (s5). thenovelty of the search lies in the use of a non-coherent technique based on thehough-transform to combine the information from coherent searches on timescalesof about one day. because these searches are very computationally intensive,they have been deployed on the einstein@home distributed computing projectinfrastructure. the search presented here is about a factor 3 more sensitivethan the previous einstein@home search in early s5 ligo data. thepost-processing has left us with eight surviving candidates. we show thatdeeper follow-up studies rule each of them out. hence, since no statisticallysignificant gravitational wave signals have been detected, we report upperlimits on the intrinsic gravitational wave amplitude h0. for example, in the0.5 hz-wide band at 152.5 hz, we can exclude the presence of signals with h0greater than 7.6 x 10^-25 with a 90% confidence level.

1304.1775	parameter estimation for compact binary coalescence signals with the  first generation gravitational-wave detector network	compact binary systems with neutron stars or black holes are one of the mostpromising sources for ground-based gravitational wave detectors. gravitationalradiation encodes rich information about source physics; thus parameterestimation and model selection are crucial analysis steps for any detectioncandidate events. detailed models of the anticipated waveforms enable inferenceon several parameters, such as component masses, spins, sky location anddistance that are essential for new astrophysical studies of these sources.however, accurate measurements of these parameters and discrimination of modelsdescribing the underlying physics are complicated by artifacts in the data,uncertainties in the waveform models and in the calibration of the detectors.here we report such measurements on a selection of simulated signals addedeither in hardware or software to the data collected by the two ligoinstruments and the virgo detector during their most recent joint science run,including a "blind injection" where the signal was not initially revealed tothe collaboration. we exemplify the ability to extract information about thesource physics on signals that cover the neutron star and black hole parameterspace over the individual mass range 1 msun - 25 msun and the full range ofspin parameters. the cases reported in this study provide a snap-shot of thestatus of parameter estimation in preparation for the operation of advanceddetectors.

0802.3238	three-dimensional stability of magnetically confined mountains on  accreting neutron stars	we examine the hydromagnetic stability of magnetically confined mountains,which arise when material accumulates at the magnetic poles of an accretingneutron star. we extend a previous axisymmetric stability analysis byperforming three-dimensional simulations using the ideal-magnetohydrodynamic(ideal-mhd) code \textsc{zeus-mp}, investigating the role played by boundaryconditions, accreted mass, stellar curvature, and (briefly) toroidal magneticfield strength. we find that axisymmetric equilibria are susceptible to theundular sub-mode of the parker instability but are not disrupted. theline-tying boundary condition at the stellar surface is crucial in stabilizingthe mountain. the nonlinear three-dimensional saturation state of theinstability is characterized by a small degree of nonaxisymmetry ($\la 0.1$ percent) and a mass ellipticity of $\epsilon \sim 10^{-5}$ for an accreted mass of$m_a = 10^{-5} m_\odot$. hence there is a good prospect of detectinggravitational waves from accreting millisecond pulsars with long-baselineinterferometers such as advanced ligo. we also investigate the ideal-mhdspectrum of the system, finding that long-wavelength poloidal modes aresuppressed in favour of toroidal modes in the nonaxisymmetric saturation state.

1410.6211	searching for stochastic gravitational waves using data from the two  co-located ligo hanford detectors	searches for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (sgwb) usingterrestrial detectors typically involve cross-correlating data from pairs ofdetectors. the sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, amongother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller theseparation, the better the sensitivity. hence, a co-located detector pair ismore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-locateddetector pair. however, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer fromcorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that couldcontaminate the measurement of the background. hence, methods to identify andmitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potentialincrease in sensitivity of co-located detectors. here we report on the firstsgwb analysis using the two ligo hanford detectors and address thecomplications arising from correlated environmental noise. we apply correlatednoise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two ligohanford detectors, h1 and h2, during ligo's fifth science run. at lowfrequencies, 40 - 460 hz, we are unable to sufficiently mitigate the correlatednoise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochasticgravitational-wave signal. however, at high frequencies, 460-1000 hz, thesetechniques are sufficient to set a $95%$ confidence level (c.l.) upper limit onthe gravitational-wave energy density of \omega(f)&lt;7.7 x 10^{-4} (f/ 900 hz)^3,which improves on the previous upper limit by a factor of $\sim 180$. in doingso, we demonstrate techniques that will be useful for future searches usingadvanced detectors, where correlated noise (e.g., from global magnetic fields)may affect even widely separated detectors.

1510.03621	first low frequency all-sky search for continuous gravitational wave  signals	in this paper we present the results of the first low frequency all-skysearch of continuous gravitational wave signals conducted on virgo vsr2 andvsr4 data. the search covered the full sky, a frequency range between 20 hz and128 hz with a range of spin-down between $-1.0 \times 10^{-10}$ hz/s and $+1.5\times 10^{-11}$ hz/s, and was based on a hierarchical approach. the startingpoint was a set of short fast fourier transforms (fft), of length 8192 seconds,built from the calibrated strain data. aggressive data cleaning, both in thetime and frequency domains, has been done in order to remove, as much aspossible, the effect of disturbances of instrumental origin. on each dataset anumber of candidates has been selected, using the frequencyhough transform inan incoherent step. only coincident candidates among vsr2 and vsr4 have beenexamined in order to strongly reduce the false alarm probability, and the mostsignificant candidates have been selected. the criteria we have used forcandidate selection and for the coincidence step greatly reduce the harmfuleffect of large instrumental artifacts. selected candidates have been subjectto a follow-up by constructing a new set of longer ffts followed by a furtherincoherent analysis. no evidence for continuous gravitational wave signals wasfound, therefore we have set a population-based joint vsr2-vsr4 90$\%$confidence level upper limit on the dimensionless gravitational wave strain inthe frequency range between 20 hz and 128 hz. this is the first all-sky searchfor continuous gravitational waves conducted at frequencies below 50 hz. we setupper limits in the range between about $10^{-24}$ and $2\times 10^{-23}$ atmost frequencies. our upper limits on signal strain show an improvement of upto a factor of $\sim$2 with respect to the results of previous all-sky searchesat frequencies below $80~\mathrm{hz}$.

1511.06124	spin paramagnetic deformation of a neutron star	quantum mechanical corrections to the hydromagnetic force balance equation,derived from the microscopic schr\"{o}dinger-pauli theory of quantum plasmas,modify the equilibrium structure and hence the mass quadrupole moment of aneutron star. it is shown here that the dominant effect --- spin paramagnetism--- is most significant in a magnetar, where one typically has$\mu_{b}|\boldsymbol{b}|\gtrsim k_b t_e$, where $\mu_{b}$ is the bohr magneton,$\boldsymbol{b}$ is the magnetic field, and $t_e$ is the electron temperature.the spin paramagnetic deformation of a nonbarotropic magnetar with a linkedpoloidal-toroidal magnetic field is calculated to be up to ${{\sim 10}}$ timesgreater than the deformation caused solely by the lorentz force. it depends onthe degree of pauli blocking by conduction electrons and the propensity to formmagnetic domains, processes which are incompletely modelled at magnetar fieldstrengths. the star becomes more oblate, as the toroidal field componentstrengthens. the result implies that existing classical predictionsunderestimate the maximum strength of the gravitational wave signal fromrapidly spinning magnetars at birth. turning the argument around, futuregravitational-wave upper limits of increasing sensitivity will placeever-stricter constraints on the physics of pauli blocking and magnetic domainformation under magnetar conditions.

0806.4738	a cellular automaton model of pulsar glitches	a cellular automaton model of pulsar glitches is described, based on thesuperfluid vortex unpinning paradigm. recent analyses of pulsar glitch datasuggest that glitches result from scale-invariant avalanches\citep{melatos07a}, which are consistent with a self-organized critical system(socs). a cellular automaton provides a computationally efficient means ofmodelling the collective behaviour of up to $10^{16}$ vortices in the pulsarinterior, whilst ensuring that the dominant aspects of the microphysics are notlost. the automaton generates avalanche distributions that are qualitativelyconsistent with a socs and with glitch data. the probability density functionsof glitch sizes and durations are power laws, and the probability densityfunction of waiting times between successive glitches is poissonian, consistentwith statistically independent events. the output of the model depends on thephysical and computational paramters used. the fitted power law exponents forthe glitch sizes ($a$) and durations ($b$) decreases as the strength of thevortex pinning increases. similarly the exponents increase as the fraction ofvortices that are pinned decreases. for the physical and computationalparameters considered, one finds $-4.3\leq a \leq -2.0$ and $-5.5\leq b\leq-2.2$, and mean glitching rates in the range $0.0023\leq\lambda\leq0.13\$ inunits of inverse time.

astro-ph;0004035	radiative precession of an isolated neutron star	euler's equations of motion are derived exactly for a rigid, triaxial,internally frictionless neutron star spinning down electromagnetically invacuo. it is shown that the star precesses, but not freely: its regularprecession relative to the principal axes of inertia couples to the componentof the radiation torque associated with the near-zone radiation fields and ismodified into an anharmonic wobble. the wobble period \tau_1 typicallysatisfies \tau_1 &lt; 10^{-2}\tau_0, where \tau_0 is the braking time-scale; thewobble amplitude evolves towards a constant non-zero value, oscillates, ordecreases to zero, depending on the degree of oblateness or prolateness of thestar and its initial spin state; and the (negative) angular frequencyderivative d{\omega}/dt oscillates as well, exhibiting quasi-periodic spikesfor triaxial stars of a particular figure. in light of these properties, ayoung, crab-like pulsar ought to display fractional changes of order unity inthe space of a few years in its pulse profile, magnetic inclination angle, andd{\omega}/dt. such changes are not observed, implying that the wobble is dampedrapidly by internal friction, if its amplitude is initially large uponcrystallization of the stellar crust. if the friction is localized in the innerand outer crusts, the thermal luminosity of the neutron star increases by aminimum amount \delta l = 3*10^{31} (\epsilon / 10^{-12}) (\omega / 10^3 rads^{-1})^2 (\tau_d / 1 yr)^{-1} erg s^{-1}, where epsilon is the ellipticity and\tau_d is the damping time-scale, with the actual value of \delta l determinedin part by the thermal conduction time \tau_cond. the increased luminosity ispotentially detectable as thermal x-rays lasting for a time max(tau_d,tau_cond)following crystallization of the crust.

0808.3820	does the accreting millisecond pulsar xte j1814-338 precess?	precession in an accretion-powered pulsar is expected to producecharacteristic variations in the pulse properties. assuming surface intensitymaps with one and two hotspots, we compute theoretically the periodicmodulation of the mean flux, pulse-phase residuals and fractional amplitudes ofthe first and second harmonic of the pulse profiles. these quantities arecharacterised in terms of their relative precession phase offsets. we thensearch for these signatures in 37 days of x-ray timing data from the accretingmillisecond pulsar xte j1814-338. we analyse a 12.2-d modulation observedpreviously and show that it is consistent with a freely precessing neutron staronly if the inclination angle is &lt; 0.1 degrees, an a priori unlikelyorientation. we conclude that if the observed flux variations are due toprecession, our model incompletely describes the relative precession phaseoffsets (e.g. the surface intensity map is over-simplified). we are still ableto place an upper limit on \epsilon of 3.0 x 10^{-9} independently of ourmodel, and estimate the phase-independent tilt angle \theta; to lie roughlybetween 5 and 10 degrees. on the other hand, if the observed flux variationsare not due to precession, the detected signal serves as a firm upper limit forany underlying precession signal. we then place an upper limit on the product\epsilon cos(\theta) of \leq 9.9 x 10^{-10}. the first scenario translates intoa maximum gravitational wave strain of 10^{-27} from xte j1814-338 (assuming adistance of 8 kpc), and a corresponding signal-to-noise ratio of \leq 10^{-3}(for a 120 day integration time) for the advanced ligo ground-basedgravitational wave detector.

astro-ph;0412154	torque bistability in the interaction between a neutron star  magnetosphere and a thin accretion disc	we present a time-dependent model of the interaction between a neutron starmagnetosphere and a thin (shakura-sunyaev) accretion disc, where the extent ofthe magnetosphere is determined by balancing outward diffusion and inwardadvection of the stellar magnetic field at the inner edge of the disc. thenature of the equilibria available to the system is governed by the magneticprandtl number pm and the ratio \xi of the corotation radius to the alfvenradius. for \xi &gt; pm^0.3, the system can occupy one of two stable states, wherethe torques are of opposite signs. if the star is spinning up initially, in theabsence of extraneous perturbations, \xi decreases until the spin-upequilibrium vanishes, the star subsequently spins down, and the torqueasymptotes to zero. vortex-in-cell simulations of the kelvin-helmholtzinstability suggest that the transport speed across the mixing layer betweenthe disc and magnetosphere is less than the shear speed when the layer is thin,unlike in previous models.

astro-ph;0503287	gravitational radiation from an accreting millisecond pulsar with a  magnetically confined mountain	the amplitude of the gravitational radiation from an accreting neutron starundergoing polar magnetic burial is calculated. during accretion, the magneticfield of a neutron star is compressed into a narrow belt at the magneticequator by material spreading equatorward from the polar cap. in turn, thecompressed field confines the accreted material in a polar mountain which ismisaligned with the rotation axis in general, producing gravitational waves.the equilibrium hydromagnetic structure of the polar mountain, and itsassociated mass quadrupole moment, are computed as functions of the accretedmass, m_a, by solving a grad-shafranov boundary value problem. the orientation-and polarization-averaged gravitational wave strain, h_c ~ 6e-24 for a 0.6 khzsource at 1 kpc with m_a &gt; 10^-5 m_sun, exceeds previous estimates that failedto treat equatorward spreading and flux freezing self-consistently. it isconcluded that an accreting millisecond pulsar emits a persistent, sinusoidalgravitational wave signal at levels detectable, in principle, by long baselineinterferometers after phase-coherent integration, provided that the polarmountain is hydromagnetically stable. magnetic burial also reduces the magneticdipole moment, mu, monotonically, implying a novel, observationally testablescaling h_c(mu). the implications for the rotational evolution of (accreting)x-ray and (isolated) radio millisecond pulsars are explored.

astro-ph;0509416	global three-dimensional flow of a neutron superfluid in a spherical  shell in a neutron star	we integrate for the first time the hydrodynamichall-vinen-bekarevich-khalatnikov equations of motion of a $^{1}s_{0}$-pairedneutron superfluid in a rotating spherical shell, using a pseudospectralcollocation algorithm coupled with a time-split fractional scheme. numericalinstabilities are smoothed by spectral filtering. three numerical experimentsare conducted, with the following results. (i) when the inner and outer spheresare put into steady differential rotation, the viscous torque exerted on thespheres oscillates quasiperiodically and persistently (after an initialtransient). the fractional oscillation amplitude ($\sim 10^{-2}$) increaseswith the angular shear and decreases with the gap width. (ii) when the outersphere is accelerated impulsively after an interval of steady differentialrotation, the torque increases suddenly, relaxes exponentially, then oscillatespersistently as in (i). the relaxation time-scale is determined principally bythe angular velocity jump, whereas the oscillation amplitude is determinedprincipally by the gap width. (iii) when the mutual friction force changessuddenly from hall-vinen to gorter-mellink form, as happens when a rectilineararray of quantized feynman-onsager vortices is destabilized by a counterflow toform a reconnecting vortex tangle, the relaxation time-scale is reduced by afactor of $\sim 3$ compared to (ii), and the system reaches a stationary statewhere the torque oscillates with fractional amplitude $\sim 10^{-3}$ about aconstant mean value. preliminary scalings are computed for observablequantities like angular velocity and acceleration as functions of reynoldsnumber, angular shear, and gap width. the results are applied to the timingirregularities (e.g., glitches and timing noise) observed in radio pulsars.

astro-ph;0607161	transitions between turbulent and laminar superfluid vorticity states in  the outer core of a neutron star	we investigate the global transition from a turbulent state of superfluidvorticity to a laminar state, and vice versa, in the outer core of a neutronstar. by solving numerically the hydrodynamic hall-vinen-bekarevich-khalatnikovequations for a rotating superfluid in a differentially rotating sphericalshell, we find that the meridional counterflow driven by ekman pumping exceedsthe donnelly-glaberson threshold throughout most of the outer core, excitingunstable kelvin waves which disrupt the rectilinear vortex array, creating avortex tangle. in the turbulent state, the torque exerted on the crustoscillates, and the crust-core coupling is weaker than in the laminar state.this leads to a new scenario for the rotational glitches observed in radiopulsars: a vortex tangle is sustained in the differentially rotating outer coreby the meridional counterflow, a sudden spin-up event brings the crust and coreinto corotation, the vortex tangle relaxes back to a rectilinear vortex array,then the crust spins down electromagnetically until enough meridionalcounterflow builds up to reform a vortex tangle. the turbulent-laminartransition can occur uniformly or in patches; the associated time-scales areestimated from vortex filament theory. we calculate numerically the globalstructure of the flow with and without an inviscid superfluid component, forhall-vinen and gorter-mellink forms of the mutual friction. we also calculatethe post-glitch evolution of the angular velocity of the crust and its timederivative, and compare the results with radio pulse timing data, predicting acorrelation between glitch activity and reynolds number.

astro-ph;0607214	magnetic burial and the harmonic content of millisecond oscillations in  thermonuclear x-ray bursts	matter accreting onto the magnetic poles of a neutron star spreads undergravity towards the magnetic equator, burying the polar magnetic field andcompressing it into a narrow equatorial belt. steady-state, grad-shafranovcalculations with a self-consistent mass-flux distribution (and asemi-quantitative treatment of ohmic diffusion) show that, for $\ma \gtrsim10^{-5}\msun$, the maximum field strength and latitudinal half-width of theequatorial magnetic belt are $b_{\rm max} = 5.6\times 10^{15}(\ma/10^{-4}\msun)^{0.32}$ g and $\delta\theta = \max[3^{\circ}(\ma/10^{-4}\msun)^{-1.5},3^{\circ} (\ma/10^{-4}\msun)^{0.5}(\dot{m}_{\rma}/10^{-8}\msun {\rm yr}^{-1})^{-0.5}]$ respectively, where $\ma$ is the totalaccreted mass and $\dot{m}_{\rm a}$ is the accretion rate. it is shown that thebelt prevents north-south heat transport by conduction, convection, radiation,and ageostrophic shear. this may explain why millisecond oscillations observedin the tails of thermonuclear (type i) x-ray bursts in low-mass x-ray binariesare highly sinusoidal: the thermonuclear flame is sequestered in the magnetichemisphere which ignites first. the model is also consistent with theoccasional occurrence of closely spaced pairs of bursts. time-dependent,ideal-magnetohydrodynamic simulations confirm that the equatorial belt is notdisrupted by parker and interchange instabilities.

astro-ph;0703203	burial of the polar magnetic field of an accreting neutron star. ii.  hydromagnetic stability of axisymmetric equilibria	the theory of polar magnetic burial in accreting neutron stars predicts thata mountain of accreted material accumulates at the magnetic poles of the star,and that, as the mountain spreads equatorward, it is confined by, andcompresses, the equatorial magnetic field. here, we extend previous,axisymmetric, grad-shafranov calculations of the hydromagnetic structure of amagnetic mountain up to accreted masses as high as $\ma = 6\times10^{-4}\msun$, by importing the output from previous calculations (which werelimited by numerical problems and the formation of closed bubbles to $\ma &lt;10^{-4}\msun$) into the time-dependent, ideal-magnetohydrodynamic code zeus-3dand loading additional mass onto the star dynamically. the rise of buoyantmagnetic bubbles through the accreted layer is observed in these experiments.we also investigate the stability of the resulting hydromagnetic equilibria byperturbing them in zeus-3d. surprisingly, it is observed that the equilibriaare marginally stable for all $\ma\leq 6\times 10^{-4}\msun$; the mountainoscillates persistently when perturbed, in a combination of alfv\'en andacoustic modes, without appreciable damping or growth, and is therefore notdisrupted (apart from a transient parker instability initially, which expels $&lt;1 %$ of the mass and magnetic flux).
