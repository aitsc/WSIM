0901.2517	evidence of a link between the evolution of clusters and their agn  fraction	we discuss the optical properties, x-ray detections, and active galacticnucleus (agn) populations of four clusters at z ~ 1 in the subaru-xmm deepfield (sxdf). the velocity distribution and plausible extended x-ray detectionsare examined, as well as the number of x-ray point sources and radio sourcesassociated with the clusters. we find that the two clusters that appearvirialised and have an extended x-ray detection contain few, if any, agn,whereas the two pre-virialised clusters have a large agn population. thisconstitutes evidence that the agn fraction in clusters is linked to theclusters' evolutionary stage. the number of x-ray agn in the pre-virialisedclusters is consistent with an overdensity of factor ~ 200; the radio agnappear to be clustered with a factor of three to six higher. the median k-bandluminosities of l_k = 1.7 +/- 0.7 l* for the x-ray sources and l_k = 2.3 +/-0.1 l* for the radio sources support the theory that these agn are triggered bygalaxy interaction and merging events in sub-groups with low internal velocitydistributions, which make up the cluster environment in a pre-virialisationevolutionary stage.

0902.2064	photometric h alpha and [o ii] luminosity function of sdf and sxdf  galaxies: implications for future baryon oscillation surveys	efficient selection of emission line galaxies at z &gt; 1 by photometricinformation in wide field surveys is one of the keys for future spectroscopicsurveys to constrain dark energy using the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)signature. here we estimate the h alpha and [o ii] line luminosity functions ofgalaxies at z = 0.5-1.7 using a novel approach where multi-wavelength imagingdata is used to jointly estimate both photometric redshifts and star-formationrates. these photometric estimates of line luminosities at high-redshift usethe large data sets of the subaru deep field and subaru xmm-newton deep field(covering \sim 1 deg^2) and are calibrated with the spectroscopic data of thelocal sloan digital sky survey galaxies. the derived luminosity functions(especially h alpha) are in reasonable agreement with the past estimates basedon spectroscopic or narrow-band-filter surveys. this dataset is useful forexamining the photometric selection of target galaxies for bao surveys becauseof the large cosmological volume covered and the large number of galaxies withdetailed photometric information. we use the sample to derive the photometricand physical properties of emission line galaxies to assist planning for futurespectroscopic bao surveys. we also show some examples of photometric selectionprocedures which can efficiently select these emission line galaxies.

0908.1646	lyman break galaxies at z~5: rest-frame uv spectra. iii	we present results of optical spectroscopic observations of candidates oflyman break galaxies (lbgs) at $z \sim 5$ in the region including the goods-nand the j0053+1234 region by using gmos-n and gmos-s, respectively. among 25candidates, five objects are identified to be at $z \sim 5$ (two of them werealready identified by an earlier study) and one object very close to thecolor-selection window turned out to be a foreground galaxy. with thisspectroscopically identified sample and those from previous studies, we derivedthe lower limits on the number density of bright ($m_{uv}&lt;-22.0$ mag) lbgs at$z \sim 5$. these lower limits are comparable to or slightly smaller than thenumber densities of uv luminosity functions (uvlfs) that show the smallernumber density among $z \sim 5$ uvlfs in literature. however, by consideringthat there remain many lbg candidates without spectroscopic observations, thenumber density of bright lbgs is expected to increase by a factor of two ormore. the evidence for the deficiency of uv luminous lbgs with large ly$\alpha$equivalent widths was reinforced. we discuss possible causes for the deficiencyand prefer the interpretation of dust absorption.

0911.2544	stellar populations of lyman alpha emitters at z = 3 - 4 based on deep  large area surveys in the subaru-sxds/ukidss-uds field	we investigate the stellar populations of lyman alpha emitters (laes) atz=3.1 and 3.7 in 0.65 deg^2 of the subaru/xmm-newton deep field, based onrest-frame uv-to-optical photometry obtained from the subaru/xmm-newton deepsurvey, the ukidss/ultra deep survey, and the spitzer legacy survey of theukidss/uds. among a total of 302 laes (224 for z=3.1 and 78 for z=3.7), only 11are detected in the k band, i.e., brighter than k(3sigma)=24.1 mag. eight ofthe 11 k-detected laes are spectroscopically confirmed. we find that thek-undetected objects, which should closely represent the lae population as awhole, have low stellar masses of ~ 10^8 - 10^8.5 msun, modest sfrs of 1 - 100msun yr^-1, and modest dust extinction of e(b-v) &lt; 0.2. the k-detected objectsare massive, mstar ~ 10^9 - 10^10.5 msun, and have significant dust extinctionwith a median of e(b-v) ~= 0.3. four k-detected objects with the reddestspectral energy distributions, two of which are spectroscopically confirmed,are heavily obscured with e(b-v) ~ 0.65, and their continua resemble those ofsome local ulirgs. interestingly, they have large lyman alpha equivalent widths~= 70 - 250 a. if these four are excluded, our sample has a weakanti-correlation between ew(lya) and mstar. we compare the stellar masses andthe specific star formation rates (ssfr) of laes with those of lyman-breakgalaxies, distant red galaxies, submillimetre galaxies, and i- or k-selectedgalaxies with z_phot ~ 3. we find that the lae population is the least massiveamong all the galaxy populations in question, but with relatively high ssfrs,while nir-detected laes have mstar and ssfr similar to lbgs. our reddest fourlaes have very high ssfrs in spite of large mstar, thus occupying a uniqueregion in the mstar versus ssfr space.

0912.3032	moircs deep survey v: a universal relation for stellar mass and surface  brightness of galaxies	we present a universal linear correlation between the stellar mass andsurface brightness (sb) of galaxies at 0.3&lt;z&lt;3, using a deep k-band selectedcatalog in the goods-north region. the correlation has a nearly constant slope,independent of redshift and color of galaxies in the rest-z frame. consideringunresolved compact galaxies, the tight correlation gives a lower boundary of sbfor a given stellar mass; lower sb galaxies are prohibited over the boundary.the universal slope suggests that the stellar mass in galaxies was build upover their cosmic histories in a similar manner irrelevant to galaxy mass, asoppose to the scenario that massive galaxies mainly accumulated their stellarmass by major merging. in contrast, sb shows a strong dependence on redshiftfor a given stellar mass. it evolves as (1+z)^(-2.0~-0.8), in addition todimming as (1+z)^4 by the cosmological expansion effect. the brighteningdepends on galaxy color and stellar mass. the blue population (rest-frameu-v&lt;0), which is dominated by young and star-forming galaxies, evolves as~(1+z)^(-0.8 +-0.3) in the rest-v band. on the other hand, the red population(u-v&gt;0) and the massive galaxies (m_*&gt;10^(10)m_sun) shows stronger brightening,(1+z)^(-1.5+-0.1). based on the comparison with galaxy evolution models, wefind that the phenomena are well explained by the pure luminosity evolution ofgalaxies out to z~3.

1005.4727	moircs deep survey. vi. near-infrared spectroscopy of k-selected  star-forming galaxies at z~2	we present near-infrared (nir) spectroscopy for 37 bzk-color-selectedstar-forming galaxies with moircs on subaru. the sample is drawn from theks-band selected catalog of the moircs deep survey (mods) in the goods-nregion. about half of our samples are selected from the mips 24um-sourcecatalog. ha emission lines are detected from 23 galaxies, of which the medianredshift is 2.12. we derived the star formation rates (sfrs) fromextinction-corrected ha luminosities. the extinction correction is estimatedfrom the sed fitting of multi-band photometric data covering uv to nirwavelengths. the balmer decrement of the stacked emission lines shows that theamount of extinction for the ionized gas is larger than that for the stellarcontinuum. from a comparison of the extinction corrected ha luminosity andother sfr indicators we found that the relation between the dust properties ofstellar continuum and ionized gas is different depending on the intrinsic sfr.the comparison between the ha sfr and stellar mass estimated from sed fittingshows no correlation between them. some galaxies with stellar mass smaller than~10^10 msun show sfrs higher than ~100 msun/yr. the specific sfrs (ssfrs) ofthese galaxies are remarkably high. the average stellar-population age of thesehigh-ssfr galaxies is younger than 100 myr, which is consistent with theimplied high ssfr. the large sfr implies the possibility that the high ssfrgalaxies significantly contribute to the cosmic sfr density of the universe atz~2. the total sfr density estimated from the ha emission line galaxies is0.089-0.136 msun/yr/mpc^3, which is consistent with the total sfr densities inthe literature. the metallicity of the high-ssfr galaxies is larger than thatexpected from the mass-metallicity relation of uv-selected galaxies at z~2 byerb et al.

1007.2961	statistics of 207 lya emitters at a redshift near 7: constraints on  reionization and galaxy formation models	we present lya luminosity function (lf), clustering measurements, and lyaline profiles based on the largest sample, to date, of 207 lya emitters (laes)at z=6.6 on the 1-deg^2 sky of subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) field. ourz=6.6 lya lf including cosmic variance estimates yields the best-fit schechterparameters of phi*=8.5 +3.0/-2.2 x10^(-4) mpc^(-3) and l*(lya)=4.4 +/-0.6x10^42 erg s^(-1) with a fixed alpha=-1.5, and indicates a decrease from z=5.7at the &gt;~90% confidence level. however, this decrease is not large, only =~30%in lya luminosity, which is too small to be identified in the previous studies.a clustering signal of z=6.6 laes is detected for the first time. we obtain thecorrelation length of r_0=2-5 h^(-1) mpc and bias of b=3-6, and find nosignificant boost of clustering amplitude by reionization at z=6.6. the averagehosting dark halo mass inferred from clustering is 10^10-10^11 mo, and dutycycle of lae population is roughly ~1% albeit with large uncertainties. theaverage of our high-quality keck/deimos spectra shows an fwhm velocity width of251 +/-16 km s^(-1). we find no large evolution of lya line profile from z=5.7to 6.6, and no anti-correlation between lya luminosity and line width at z=6.6.the combination of various reionization models and our observational resultsabout the lf, clustering, and line profile indicates that there would exist asmall decrease of igm's lya transmission owing to reionization, but that thehydrogen igm is not highly neutral at z=6.6. our neutral-hydrogen fractionconstraint implies that the major reionization process took place at z&gt;~7.

1009.3377	moircs deep survey. vii: nir morphologies of star-forming galaxies at  redshift z~1	we investigate rest-frame near-infrared (nir) morphologies of a sample of 139galaxies with m_{s} &gt;= 1 x 10^{10} m_{sun} at z=0.8-1.2 in the goods-northfield using our deep nir imaging data (moircs deep survey, mods). we focus onluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs), which dominate high star formation rate(sfr) density at z~1, in the sample identified by cross-correlating with thespitzer/mips 24um source catalog. we perform two-dimensional light profilefitting of the z~1 galaxies in the ks-band (rest-frame j-band) with a singlecomponent sersic model. we find that at z~1, ~90% of lirgs have low sersicindices (n&lt;2.5, similar to disk-like galaxies) in the ks-band, and thosedisk-like lirgs consist of ~60% of the whole disk-like sample above m_{s} &gt;= 3x 10^{10} m_{sun}. the z~1 disk-like lirgs are comparable or ~20% small at amaximum in size compared to local disk-like galaxies in the same stellar massrange. if we examine rest-frame uv-optical morphologies using the hst/acsimages, the rest-frame b-band sizes of the z~1 disk-like galaxies arecomparable to those of the local disk-like galaxies as reported by previousstudies on size evolution of disk-like galaxies in the rest-frame optical band.measuring color gradients (galaxy sizes as a function of wavelength) of the z~1and local disk-like galaxies, we find that the z~1 disk-like galaxies have 3-5times steeper color gradient than the local ones. our results indicate that (i)more than a half of relatively massive disk-like galaxies at z~1 are in violentstar formation epochs observed as lirgs, and also (ii) most of those lirgs areconstructing their fundamental disk structure vigorously. the high sfr densityin the universe at z~1 may be dominated by such star formation in disk regionin massive galaxies.

1112.3704	nir spectroscopy of star-forming galaxies at z~1.4 with subaru/fmos: the  mass-metallicity relation	we present near-infrared spectroscopic observations of star-forming galaxiesat z~1.4 with fmos on the subaru telescope. we observed k-band selectedgalaxies in the sxds/uds fields with k&lt;23.9 mag, 1.2&lt;z_ph&lt;1.6, m*&gt;10^{9.5}msun, and expected f(halpha)&gt;10^{-16} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}. 71 objects in thesample have significant detections of halpha. for these objects, excludingpossible agns identified from the bpt diagram, gas-phase metallicities areobtained from [nii]/halpha line ratio. the sample is split into three stellarmass bins, and the spectra are stacked in each stellar mass bin. themass-metallicity relation obtained at z~1.4 is located between those at z~0.8and z~2.2. we constrain an intrinsic scatter to be ~0.1 dex or larger in themass-metallicity relation at z~1.4; the scatter may be larger at higherredshifts. we found trends that the deviation from the mass-metallicityrelation depends on the sfr and the half light radius: galaxies with higher sfrand larger half light radii show lower metallicities at a given stellar mass.one possible scenario for the trends is the infall of pristine gas accretedfrom igm or through merger events. our data points show larger scatter than thefundamental metallicity relation (fmr) at z~0.1 and the average metallicitiesslightly deviate from the fmr. the compilation of the mass-metallicityrelations at z~3 to z~0.1 shows that they evolve smoothly from z~3 to z~0without changing the shape so much except for the massive part at z~0.

1306.5246	first systematic search for oxygen-line blobs at high redshift:  uncovering agn feedback and star-formation quenching	we present the first systematic search for extended metal-line[oii]{\lambda}{\lambda}3726,3729 nebulae, or [oii] blobs (oiibs), at z=1.2using deep narrowband imaging with a survey volume of 1.9x10^5 mpc^3 on the0.62 deg^2 sky of subaru-xmm deep survey (sxds) field. we discover a giantoiib, dubbed 'oiib 1', with a spatial extent over ~75 kpc at a spectroscopicredshift of z=1.18, and also identify a total of twelve oiibs with a size of&gt;30 kpc. our optical spectrum of oiib 1 presents [nev]{\lambda}3426 line at the6{\sigma} level, indicating that this object harbors an obscured type-2 agn.the presence of gas outflows in this object is suggested by two marginaldetections of feii{\lambda}2587 absorption and feii*{\lambda}2613 emissionlines both of which are blueshifted at as large as 500-600 km/s, indicatingthat the heating source of oiib 1 is agn or associated shock excitation ratherthan supernovae produced by starbursts. the number density of oiib 1-type giantblobs is estimated to be ~5x10^{-6} mpc^{-3} at z~1.2, which is comparable withthat of agns driving outflow at a similar redshift, suggesting that giant oiibsare produced only by agn activity. on the other hand, the number density ofsmall oiibs, 6x10^{-5} mpc^{-3}, compared to that of z~1 galaxies in the bluecloud in the same m_b range, may imply that 3% of star-forming galaxies at z~1are quenching star formation through outflows involving extended [oii]emission.

1307.0514	the cosmic bpt diagram: confronting theory with observations	we compare a large sample of galaxies between 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 with theoreticalpredictions for how the optical diagnostic line ratios in galaxy ensembleschange as a function of cosmic time. we show that star forming galaxies at highredshift (z&gt;1.5) are consistent with a model in which the ism conditions aremore extreme at high redshift than seen in the global spectra of localgalaxies. we speculate that global spectra of our high redshift galaxies may bedominated by hii regions similar to the extreme clumpy, dense star-formingcomplexes in the antennae and m82. the transition to local-type conditionsoccurs between 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.5. we conclude that classification schemes developed forlocal samples should not be applied at high redshift (z &gt; 1.5). we use ourtheoretical models to derive a new redshift-dependent classification line thatutilizes the standard optical diagnostic line ratios [oiii]/h-beta and[nii]/h-alpha. our new line can be used to separate star-forming galaxies fromagn between z=0 to z~3.5. we anticipate that our redshift-dependent opticalclassification line will be useful for future large surveys with near-infraredmulti-object spectrographs. we apply our classification line to a sample ofgravitationally lensed galaxies at z~2.5. although limited by small numbers, weshow that our classification line is consistent with the position of agn thathave been independently confirmed via other methods.

1308.5129	a study of selection methods for h alpha emitting galaxies at z~1.3 for  the subaru/fmos galaxy redshift survey for cosmology (fastsound)	the efficient selection of high-redshift emission galaxies is important forfuture large galaxy redshift surveys for cosmology. here we describe the targetselection methods for the fastsound project, a redshift survey for h alphaemitting galaxies at z=1.2-1.5 using subaru/fmos to measure the linear growthrate f\sigma 8 via redshift space distortion (rsd) and constrain the theory ofgravity. to select ~400 target galaxies in the 0.2 deg^2 fmos field-of-viewfrom photometric data of cfhtls-wide (u*g'r'i'z'), we test several differentmethods based on color-color diagrams or photometric redshift estimates fromspectral energy distribution (sed) fitting. we also test the improvement inselection efficiency that can be achieved by adding near-infrared data from theukidss dxs (j). the success rates of h alpha detection with fmos averaged overtwo observed fields using these methods are 11.3% (color-color, optical), 13.6%(color-color, optical+nir), 17.3% (photo-z, optical), and 15.1% (photo-z,optical+nir). selection from photometric redshifts tends to give a betterefficiency than color-based methods, although there is no significantimprovement by adding j band data within the statistical scatter. we alsoinvestigate the main limiting factors for the success rate, by using the sampleof the hizels h alpha emitters that were selected by narrow-band imaging.although the number density of total h alpha emitters having higher h alphafluxes than the fmos sensitivity is comparable with the fmos fiber density, thelimited accuracy of photometric redshift and h alpha flux estimations havecomparable effects on the success rate of &lt;~20% obtained from sed fitting.

1310.2020	the formation of the massive galaxies in the ssa22 z=3.1 protocluster	the properties of k-band selected galaxies (k_ab&lt;24) in the z = 3.09 ssa22protocluster field are studied. 430 galaxies at 2.6 &lt; z_phot &lt; 3.6 are selectedas potential protocluster members in a 112 arcmin^2 area based on theirphotometric redshifts. we find that \approx 20% of the massive galaxies withstellar masses &gt;10^11 m_sun at z_phot \sim 3.1 have colors consistent withthose of quiescent galaxies with ages &gt; 0.5 gyr. this fraction increases to\approx 50% after correcting for unrelated foreground/background objects. wealso find that 30% of the massive galaxies are heavily reddened dustystar-forming galaxies. few such quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts areseen in typical survey fields. an excess surface density of 24\mu m sources atz_phot \sim 3.1 is also observed, implying the presence of dusty star-formationactivity in the protocluster. cross-correlation with the x-ray data indicatesthat the fraction of k-band selected protocluster galaxies hosting activegalactic nuclei (agn) is also high compared with the field. the skydistribution of the quiescent galaxies, the 24\mu m sources, and the x-ray agnsshow clustering around a density peak of z=3.1 ly\alpha emitters (laes). asignificant fraction of the massive galaxies have already become quiescent,while the dusty star-formation is still active in the ssa22 protocluster. thesefindings indicate that we are witnessing the formation epoch of massiveearly-type galaxies at the center of predecessors to present-day rich galaxyclusters.

1311.2624	the mass-metallicity relation at z~1.4 revealed with subaru/fmos	we present a stellar mass-metallicity relation at z~1.4 with anunprecedentedly large sample of ~340 star-forming galaxies obtained with fmoson the subaru telescope. we observed k-band selected galaxies at 1.2 &lt; z_{ph} &lt;1.6 in the sxds/uds fields with m_{*} &gt; 10^{9.5} m_{\sun}, and expectedf(h\alpha) &gt; 5 \times 10^{-17} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}. among the observed ~1200targets, 343 objects show significant h\alpha emission lines. the gas-phasemetallicity is obtained from [nii]\lambda 6584/h\alpha line ratio, afterexcluding possible active galactic nuclei (agns). due to the faintness of the[nii]\lambda 6584 lines, we apply the stacking analysis and derive themass-metallicity relation at z~1.4. our results are compared to past results atdifferent redshifts in the literature. the mass-metallicity relation at z~1.4is located between those at z~0.8 and z~2.2; it is found that the metallicityincreases with decreasing redshift from z~3 to z~0 at fixed stellar mass.thanks to the large size of the sample, we can study the dependence of themass-metallicity relation on various galaxy physical properties. the averagemetallicity from the stacked spectra is close to the local fmr in the highermetallicity part but &gt;0.1 dex higher in metallicity than the fmr in the lowermetallicity part. we find that galaxies with larger e(b-v), b-r, and r-hcolours tend to show higher metallicity by ~0.05 dex at fixed stellar mass. wealso find relatively clearer size dependence that objects with smaller halflight radius tend to show higher metallicity by ~0.1 dex at fixed stellar mass,especially in the low mass part.

1402.1836	toward the standard population synthesis model of the x-ray background:  evolution of x-ray luminosity and absorption functions of active galactic  nuclei including compton-thick populations	we present the most up-to-date x-ray luminosity function (xlf) and absorptionfunction of active galactic nuclei (agns) over the redshift range from 0 to 5,utilizing the largest, highly complete sample ever available obtained fromsurveys performed with swift/bat, maxi, asca, xmm-newton, chandra, and rosat.the combined sample, including that of the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey,consists of 4039 detections in the soft (0.5--2 kev) and/or hard ($&gt;2$ kev)band. we utilize a maximum likelihood method to reproduce the count-rate versusredshift distribution for each survey, by taking into account the evolution ofthe absorbed fraction, the contribution from compton-thick (ctk) agns, andbroad band spectra of agns including reflection components from tori based onthe luminosity and redshift dependent unified scheme. we find that the shape ofthe xlf at $z \sim 1-3$ is significantly different from that in the localuniverse, for which the luminosity dependent density evolution model gives muchbetter description than the luminosity and density evolution model. theseresults establish the standard population synthesis model of the x-raybackground (xrb), which well reproduces the source counts, the observedfractions of ctk agns, and the spectrum of the hard xrb. the number ratio ofctk agns to the absorbed compton-thin (ctn) agns is constrained to be$\approx$0.5--1.6 to produce the 20--50 kev xrb intensity within presentuncertainties, by assuming that they follow the same evolution as ctn agns. thegrowth history of supermassive black holes is discussed based on the new agnbolometric luminosity function.

0705.1145	lyman break galaxies at z~5: rest-frame uv spectra ii	we present the results of spectroscopy of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z~5in the j0053+1234 field with the faint object camera and spectrograph on thesubaru telescope. among 5 bright candidates with z' &lt; 25.0 mag, 2 objects areconfirmed to be at z~5 from their ly alpha emission and the continuumdepression shortward of ly alpha. the ews of ly alpha emission of the 2 lbgsare not so strong to be detected as ly alpha emitters, and one of them showsstrong low-ionized interstellar (lis) metal absorption lines. two faint objectswith z' \geq 25.0 mag are also confirmed to be at z~5, and their spectra showstrong ly alpha emission in contrast to the bright ones. these results suggesta deficiency of strong ly alpha emission in bright lbgs at z~5, which has beendiscussed in our previous paper. combined with our previous spectra of lbgs atz~5 obtained around the hubble deep field-north (hdf-n), we made a compositespectrum of uv luminous (m_1400 \leq -21.5 mag) lbgs at z~5. the resultantspectrum shows a weak ly alpha emission and strong lis absorptions whichsuggests that the bright lbgs at z~5 have chemically evolved at least to ~0.1solar metallicity. for a part of our sample in the hdf-n region, we obtainednear-to-mid infrared data, which constraint stellar masses of these objects.with the stellar mass and the metallicity estimated from lis absorptions, themetallicities of the lbgs at z~5 tend to be lower than those of the galaxieswith the same stellar mass at z \lesssim 2, although the uncertainty is verylarge.

0802.3958	subaru/moircs near-infrared imaging in the proto-cluster region at z=3.1	we present the results of deep near-infrared imaging observations of thez=3.1 proto-cluster region in the ssa22a field taken by moircs mounted on thesubaru telescope. we observed a 21.7 arcmin^2 field to the depths of j=24.5,h=24.3, and k=23.9 (5 sigma). we examine the distribution of the k-selectedgalaxies at z~3 by using the simple color cut for distant red galaxies (drgs)as well as the photometric-redshift selection technique. the marginal densityexcess of drgs and the photo-z selected objects are found around the two mostluminous ly alpha blobs (labs). we investigate the correlation between thek-selected objects and the labs, and find that several galaxies with stellarmass m_* = 10^9-10^11 m_solar exist in vicinity of labs, especially around thetwo most luminous ones. we also find that 7 of the 8 labs in the field haveplausible k_s-band counterparts and the sum of the stellar mass possiblyassociated with labs correlates with the luminosity and surface brightness ofthem, which implies that the origin of ly alpha emission may be closelycorrelated with their stellar mass or their previous star formation phenomena.

1405.6198	field: an automated emission-line detection software for subaru/fmos  near-infrared spectroscopy	we describe the development of automated emission line detection software forthe fiber multi-object spectrograph (fmos), which is a near-infraredspectrograph fed by $400$ fibers from the $0.2$ deg$^2$ prime focus field ofview of the subaru telescope. the software, field (fmos software forimage-based emission line detection), is developed and tested mainly for thefastsound survey, which is targeting h$\alpha$ emitting galaxies at $z \sim1.3$ to measure the redshift space distortion as a test of general relativitybeyond $z \sim 1$. the basic algorithm is to calculate the line signal-to-noiseratio ($s/n$) along the wavelength direction, given by a 2-d convolution of thespectral image and a detection kernel representing a typical emission lineprofile. a unique feature of fmos is its use of oh airglow suppression masks,requiring the use of flat-field images to suppress noise around the maskregions. bad pixels on the detectors and pixels affected by cosmic-rays areefficiently removed by using the information obtained from the fmos analysispipeline. we limit the range of acceptable line-shape parameters for thedetected candidates to further improve the reliability of line detection. thefinal performance of line detection is tested using a subset of the fastsounddata; the false detection rate of spurious objects is examined by usinginverted frames obtained by exchanging object and sky frames. the falsedetection rate is $&lt; 1$\% at $s/n &gt; 5$, allowing an efficient and objectiveemission line search for fmos data at the line flux level of $\gtrsim 1.0\times 10^{-16}$[erg/cm$^2$/s].

1410.7147	the gas inflow and outflow rate in star-forming galaxies at $z\sim1.4$	we try to constrain the gas inflow and outflow rate of star-forming galaxiesat $z\sim1.4$ by employing a simple analytic model for the chemical evolutionof galaxies. the sample is constructed based on a large near-infrared (nir)spectroscopic sample observed with subaru/fmos. the gas-phase metallicity ismeasured from the [\ion{n}{2}]$\lambda$6584/h$\alpha$ emission line ratio andthe gas mass is derived from the extinction corrected h$\alpha$ luminosity byassuming the kennicutt-schmidt law. we constrain the inflow and outflow ratefrom the least-$\chi^{2}$ fittings of the observed gas mass fraction, stellarmass, and metallicity with the analytic model. the joint $\chi^{2}$ fittingshows the best-fit inflow rate is $\sim1.8$ and the outflow rate is $\sim0.6$in unit of star-formation rate (sfr). by applying the same analysis to theprevious studies at $z\sim0$ and $z\sim2.2$, it is shown that the both inflowrate and outflow rate decrease with decreasing redshift, which implies thehigher activity of gas flow process at higher redshift. the decreasing trend ofthe inflow rate from $z\sim2.2$ to $z\sim0$ agrees with that seen in theprevious observational works with different methods, though the absolute valueis generally larger than the previous works. the outflow rate and its evolutionfrom $z\sim2.2$ to $z\sim0$ obtained in this work agree well with theindependent estimations in the previous observational works.

0807.4174	discovery of a giant lya emitter near the reionization epoch	we report the discovery of a giant lya emitter (lae) with a spitzer/iraccounterpart near the reionization epoch at z=6.595. the giant lae is found fromthe extensive 1 deg^2 subaru narrow-band survey for z=6.6 laes in thesubaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) field, and subsequently identified by deepspectroscopy of keck/deimos and magellan/imacs. among our 207 lae candidates,this lae is not only the brightest narrow-band object with l(lya) = 3.9+/-0.2 x10^43 erg/s in our survey volume of 10^6 mpc^3, but also a spatially extendedlya nebula with the largest isophotal area whose major axis is at least ~3''.this object is more likely to be a large lya nebula with a size of &gt;~17 kpcthan to be a strongly-lensed galaxy by a foreground object. our keck spectrumwith medium-high spectral and spatial resolutions suggests that the velocitywidth is v(fwhm)=251+/-21 km/s, and that the line-center velocity changes by~60 km/s in a 10-kpc range. the stellar mass and star-formation rate areestimated to be 0.9-5.0 x 10^10 mo and &gt;34 mo/yr, respectively, from thecombination of deep optical to infrared images of subaru, ukidss-ultra deepsurvey, and spitzer/irac. although the nature of this object is not yet clearlyunderstood, this could be an important object for studying cooling cloudsaccreting onto a massive halo, or forming-massive galaxies with significantoutflows contributing to cosmic reionization and metal enrichment ofinter-galactic medium.

astro-ph;0111037	a candidate of a type-2 qso at z=0.9: large x-ray absorption with a  strong broad-h-alpha emission line	deep hard x-ray and near infrared observations of a type-2 radio-quiet qsocandidate at z=0.9, axj08494+4454, are reported. the 0.5-10kev chandra x-rayobservatory spectrum of axj08494+4454 is hard, and is explained well with apower-law continuum absorbed by a hydrogen column density of 2x10^23 cm^-2. the2-10kev luminosity of the object reaches hard x-ray luminosity of qsos. thelarge x-ray absorption and the large intrinsic luminosity support the originalidentification of axj08494+4454 as a type-2 radio-quiet qso. nevertheless, thedeep subaru/ircs j-band spectroscopic observation suggests the presence of astrong broad h-alpha emission line from axj08494+4454. if real, the broadh-alpha emission line has a velocity width of 9400+-1000 km/s, whichcorresponds to a typical broad-balmer line velocity width of a luminous qso.the existence of the strong broad h-alpha line means that the object is not atype-2 qso, but a luminous cousin of a seyfert 1.9 galaxy in the source-frameoptical spectrum. the balmer decrement of broad lines, and the broad h-alphaemission to the hard x-ray luminosity ratio suggest that the nucleus isaffected by dust extinction with a_v of 1-3 mag in the optical wavelength. theestimated amount of dust extinction is much smaller than that expected from thex-ray column density.

astro-ph;0208232	chandra observations and optical identification of hard x-ray sources  discovered with asca	we present the first results of the chandra and optical follow-upobservations of hard x-ray sources detected in the asca medium sensitivitysurvey (amss). optical identifications are made for five objects. three of themshow either weak or absent optical narrow emission lines and are at lowredshift &lt;z&gt;~0.06. one of them is a broad line object at z=0.910 and one is az=0.460 object with only narrow lines. all the narrow line objects show strongevidence for absorption in their x-ray spectra. their line ratios areconsistent with a seyfert ii/liner identification as are the line widths. thethree low redshift objects have the colors of normal galaxies and apparentlythe light is dominated by stars. this could be due to the extinction of theunderlying nuclear continuum by the same matter that absorbs x-rays and/or dueto the dilution of the central source by starlight. these results suggest thatx-ray sources that appear as ``normal'' galaxies in optical and near-ir bandssignificantly contribute to the hard x-ray background. this population ofobjects has a high space density and probably dominates the entire populationof active galaxies.

astro-ph;0307164	optical identification of the asca medium sensitivity survey in the  northern sky: nature of hard x-ray-selected luminous active galactic nuclei	we present the results of optical spectroscopic identifications of a brightsubsample of 2-10kev hard x-ray selected sources from the asca mediumsensitivity survey in the northern sky. the flux limit of the subsample is3*10^-13 erg s^-1 cm^-2 in the 2-10kev band. all but one of the 87 hard x-rayselected sources are optically identified, with agns, 7 clusters of galaxies,and 1 galactic star. it is the largest complete sample of hard x-ray selectedagns at the bright flux limit. amounts of absorption to their nuclei areestimated to be hydrogen column densities (n_h) of up to ~3*10^23 cm^-2 fromtheir x-ray spectra. optical properties of x-ray absorbed agns with n_h &gt;1*10^22 cm^-2 indicate the effects of dust absorption: at redshifts, z&lt;0.6,agns without broad h\beta emission lines have significantly larger n_h valuethan agns with broad h\beta emission lines. at z&gt;0.6, the x-ray absorbed agnshave a large hard x-ray to optical flux ratio (log f2-10kev/fr &gt; +1). however,three x-ray absorbed z&gt;0.6 agns show strong broad lines. in combination withhard x-ray selected agn samples from the asca large sky survey, the asca deepsurvey in the lockman hole and chandra deep field north, the luminositydistributions of absorbed and less-absorbed agns are compared.

astro-ph;0308140	cosmological evolution of the hard x-ray agn luminosity function and the  origin of the hard x-ray background	we investigate the cosmological evolution of the hard x-ray luminosityfunction (hxlf) of active galactic nuclei (agn) in the 2-10 kev luminosityrange of 10^{41.5} - 10^{46.5} erg s^-1 as a function of redshift up to 3. froma combination of surveys conducted at photon energies above 2 kev with heao1,asca, and chandra, we construct a highly complete (&gt;96%) sample consisting of247 agns over the wide flux range of 10^{-10} - 3.8*10^{-15} erg cm^-2 s^-1(2-10 kev). for our purpose, we develop an extensive method of calculating theintrinsic (before-absorption) hxlf and the absorption (n_h) function. thisutilizes the maximum likelihood method fully correcting for observationalbiases with consideration of the x-ray spectrum of each source. we find that(i) the fraction of x-ray absorbed agns decreases with the intrinsic luminosityand (ii) the evolution of the hxlf of all agns (including both type-i andtype-ii agns) is best described with a luminosity dependent density evolution(ldde) where the cutoff redshift increases with the luminosity. our resultsdirectly constrain the evolution of agns that produce a major part of the hardx-ray background, thus solving its origin quantitatively. a combination of thehxlf and the nh function enables us to construct a purely "observation based"population synthesis model. we present basic consequences of this model, anddiscuss the contribution of compton-thick agns to the rest of the hard x-raybackground.

(2001). we find that theanomalously-small dust-to-gas ratios in circumnuclear gas, which is seen insome agns with seyfert-class luminosity, also occur in the qsos (agns withluminosity of l(2-10kev) &gt; 10^44.5 erg/s). for all the qsos with an x-rayabsorption of n_h &gt; 10^22 /cm2 in our sample, the values of a_v/n_h are smallerthan the galactic value by a factor of 5 to 100. since a fraction of thispopulation among the qsos in our sample is about 30%, such fraction ofoptical/uv-selected type 1 qsos known to date may show type 2 nature in x-ray.

astro-ph;0404227	lyman break galaxies at $z\sim5$: rest-frame uv spectra	we report initial results for spectroscopic observations of candidates oflyman break galaxies (lbgs) at $z\sim5$ in a region centered on the hubble deepfield-north by using the faint object camera and spectrograph attached to thesubaru telescope. eight objects with $i_c\leq25.0$ mag, including one agn, areconfirmed to be at $4.5&lt;z&lt;5.2$. the rest-frame uv spectra of seven lbgscommonly show no or weak lyalpha emission line (rest-frame equivalent width of0-10\aa) and relatively strong low-ionization interstellar metal absorptionlines of siii $\lambda$1260, oi+siii $\lambda$1303, and cii $\lambda$1334 (meanrest-frame equivalent widths of them are $-1.2 \sim -5.1 $\aa). theseproperties are significantly different from those of the mean rest-frame uvspectrum of lbgs at $z\sim3$, but are quite similar to those of subgroups oflbgs at $z\sim3$ with no or weak lyalpha emission. the weakness of lyalphaemission and strong low-ionization interstellar metal absorption lines mayindicate that these lbgs at $z\sim5$ are chemically evolved to some degree andhave a dusty environment. since the fraction of such lbgs at $z\sim5$ in oursample is larger than that at $z\sim3$, we may witness some sign of evolutionof lbgs from $z\sim5$ to $z\sim3$, though the present sample size is verysmall. it is also possible, however, that the brighter lbgs tend to show no orweak lyalpha emission, because our spectroscopic sample is bright (brighterthan $l^{\ast}$) among lbgs at $z\sim5$. more observations are required toestablish spectroscopic nature of lbgs at $z\sim5$.

astro-ph;0505315	host galaxies of the high-redshift agns in the goods fields	the star-formation rates and the stellar masses of the host galaxies of agnsat high-redshifts are keys to understanding the evolution of the relationbetween the mass of the spheroidal component of a galaxy and the mass of itscentral black hole. we investigate the host galaxies of 31 agns withspectroscopic redshifts between 2 and 4 found in the deep chandra surveys ofthe goods fields with the acs images. the sample can be divided into 17``extended'' agns and 14 ``compact'' agns based on the concentration parameterdefined as the difference between the aperture magnitudes with 0.07" and 0.25"diameter. we derive upper limits of the uv luminosities of the host galaxies ofthe ``compact'' agn sample, and upper and lower limits of the uv luminositiesof the host galaxies of the ``extended'' agn sample.these limits are consistentwith the knee of the luminosity function of the lyman break galaxies (lbgs) atz=3, suggesting moderate star-formation rates, less than 40 msolar/yr, in thehost galaxies of the agns at 2&lt;z_sp&lt;4 without correcting the dust extinction.by combining the limits of the uv luminosities with the observed k-bandmagnitudes for the ``extended'' agns, we derive the upper and lower limits ofthe stellar masses of their host galaxies. the derived upper limits on thestellar masses range from 10^10 msolar to 10^12 msolar. the upper limits implythat the mbulge-mbh relation of the high-redshift agns is different from thatof the galaxies in the nearby universe or the average eddington ratio of thehigh-redshift agns is higher than that of low-redshift agns withlower-luminosity.

astro-ph;0605289	deficiency of large equivalent width lyman-alpha emission in luminous  lyman break galaxies at z~5-6?	we report a deficiency of luminous lyman break galaxies (lbgs) with a largerest-frame equivalent width (ew_rest) of lyman-alpha emission at z~5-6.combining our spectroscopic sample of lbgs at z~5 and those from theliterature, we found that luminous lbgs at z~5-6 generally show weaklyman-alpha emissions, while faint lbgs show a wide range of lyman-alphaew_rest and tend to have strong (ew_rest &gt;20a) lyman-alpha emissions; i.e.,there is a deficiency of strong lyman-alpha emission in luminous lbgs. thereseems to be a threshold uv luminosity for the deficiency; it is m_1400 = -21.5\~ -21.0 mag, which is close to or somewhat brighter than the m* of the uvluminosity function at z~5 and 6. since the large ew_rest of lyman-alphaemission can be seen among the faint lbgs, the fraction of lyman-alpha emittersin lbgs may change rather abruptly with the uv luminosity. if the weakness oflyman-alpha emission is due to dust absorption, the deficiency suggests thatluminous lbgs at z=5-6 tend to be in dusty and more chemically evolvedenvironments and started star formation earlier than faint ones, though othercauses cannot be ruled out.

(2000) in spite of our much larger survey volume. thissuggests that large and luminous extended ly-alpha objects like the two labsare very rare and are clustered in overdense regions.

astro-ph;0607036	discovery of h alpha absorption in the unusual broad absorption line  quasar sdss j083942.11+380526.3	we discovered an h alpha absorption in a broad h alpha emission line of anunusual broad absorption line quasar, sdss j083942.11+380526.3 at z=2.318, bynear-infrared spectroscopy with the cooled infrared spectrograph and camera forohs (cisco) on the subaru telescope. the presence of non-stellar h alphaabsorption is known only in the seyfert galaxy ngc 4151 to date, thus ourdiscovery is the first case for quasars. the h alpha absorption line isblueshifted by 520 km/s relative to the h alpha emission line, and its redshiftalmost coincides with those of uv low-ionization metal absorption lines. thewidth of the h alpha absorption (~ 340 km/s) is similar to those of the uvlow-ionization absorption lines. these facts suggest that the h alpha and thelow-ionization metal absorption lines are produced by the same low-ionizationgas which has a substantial amount of neutral gas. the column density of theneutral hydrogen is estimated to be ~ 10^18 cm^-2 by assuming a gas temperatureof 10,000 k from the analysis of the curve of growth. the continuum spectrum isreproduced by a reddened (e(b-v) ~ 0.15 mag for the smc-like reddening law)composite quasar spectrum. furthermore, the uv spectrum of sdssj083942.11+380526.3 shows a remarkable similarity to that of ngc 4151 in itslow state, suggesting the physical condition of the absorber in sdssj083942.11+380526.3 is similar to that of ngc 4151 in the low state. asproposed for ngc 4151, sdss j083942.11+380526.3 may be also seen through theclose direction of the surface of the obscuring torus.
