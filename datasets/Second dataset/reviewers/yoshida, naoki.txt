0902.0371	simulations of baryon acoustic oscillations ii: covariance matrix of the  matter power spectrum	we use 5000 cosmological n-body simulations of 1(gpc/h)^3 box for theconcordance lcdm model in order to study the sampling variances of nonlinearmatter power spectrum. we show that the non-gaussian errors can be importanteven on large length scales relevant for baryon acoustic oscillations (bao).our findings are (1) the non-gaussian errors degrade the cumulativesignal-to-noise ratios (s/n) for the power spectrum amplitude by up to a factorof 2 and 4 for redshifts z=1 and 0, respectively. (2) there is littleinformation on the power spectrum amplitudes in the quasi-nonlinear regime,confirming the previous results. (3) the distribution of power spectrumestimators at bao scales, among the realizations, is well approximated by agaussian distribution with variance that is given by the diagonal covariancecomponent. (4) for the redshift-space power spectrum, the degradation in s/n bynon-gaussian errors is mitigated due to nonlinear redshift distortions. (5) foran actual galaxy survey, the additional shot noise contamination compromisesthe cosmological information inherent in the galaxy power spectrum, but alsomitigates the impact of non-gaussian errors. the s/n is degraded by up to 30%for a wfmos-type survey. (6) the finite survey volume causes additionalnon-gaussian errors via the correlations of long-wavelength fluctuations withthe fluctuations we want to measure, further degrading the s/n values by about30% even at high redshift z=3.

0902.1018	the 21cm signature of early relic \hii regions	we calculate the spin temperature and 21 cm brightness of early \hii regionsaround the first stars. we use outputs from cosmologicalradiation-hydrodynamics simulations of the formation and evolution of early\hii regions. in the pre-reionization era, \hii regions around massiveprimordial stars have diameters of a few kpc. the gas within the \hii regionsis almost fully ionized, but begins recombining after the central stars dieoff. the relic \hii regions are then seen as bright {\it emission} sources inhydrogen 21 cm. we make brightness temperature maps of the \hii regions,accounting for radiative coupling with lyman-$\alpha$ photons in a simplifiedmanner. the spin temperature in the relic \hii region is close to the gaskinetic temperature, generally several hundred to several thousand degrees. weshow that the relic \hii region can be as bright as $\delta t_{\rm b} \sim 100$mk in differential temperature against the cosmic microwave background for anangular resolution of sub-arcseconds. while individual early \hii patches willnot be identified by currently planned radio telescopes, the collectivefluctuations from early \hii regions might imprint signatures in the 21 cmbackground.

0902.4573	evolution of very massive population iii stars with mass accretion from  pre-main sequence to collapse	we calculate the evolution of zero-metallicity population iii (pop iii) starswhose mass grows from the initial mass of $\sim 1m_{\odot}$ by accreting thesurrounding gases. our calculations cover a whole evolutionary stages from thepre-main sequence, via various nuclear burning stages, through the final corecollapse or pair-creation instability phases. we adopt the following stellarmass-dependent accretion rates which are derived from cosmological simulationsof early structure formation based on the low mass dark matter halos atredshifts $z \sim 20$: (1) the accretion rates for the first generation (popiii.1) stars and (2) the rates for zero-metallicity but the second generation(pop iii.2) stars which are affected by radiation from the pop iii.1 stars. forcomparison, we also study the evolution with the mass-dependent accretion rateswhich are affected by radiatibe feedback. we show that the final mass of popiii.1 stars can be as large as $\sim 1000m_{\odot}$, beyond the mass range($140 - 300m_{\odot}$) for the pair-instability supernovae. such massive starsundergo core-collapse to form intermediate-mass black holes, which may be theseeds for merger trees to supermassive black holes. on the other hand, popiii.2 stars become less massive ($\lsim 40 - 60m_{\odot}$), being in the massrange of ordinary iron core-collapse stars. such stars explode and eject heavyelements to contribute to chemical enrichment of the early universe as observedin the abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor stars in the galactic halo.

(2) when did the epoch of population iii (metal-free) starformation take place and how long did it last? (3) was the stellar initial massfunction dramatically different for the first stars and galaxies? thesequestions are all active areas of theoretical research. however, newobservational constraints via the direct detection of population iii starformation are vital to making progress in answering the broader questionssurrounding how galaxies formed and how the cosmological properties of theuniverse have affected the objects it contains.

0706.3597	formation of massive primordial stars in a reionized gas	we use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with unprecedented resolution tostudy the formation of primordial stars in an ionized gas at high redshifts.our approach includes all the relevant atomic and molecular physics to followthe thermal evolution of a prestellar gas cloud to very high densities of~10^{18} cm^{-3}. we locate a star-forming gas cloud within a reionized regionin our cosmological simulation. the first run-away collapse is triggered whenthe gas cloud's mass is ~40 msun. we show that the cloud core remains stableagainst chemo-thermal instability and also against gravitational deformationthroughout its evolution. consequently, a single proto-stellar seed is formed,which accretes the surrounding hot gas at the rate ~10^{-3} msun/year. we carryout proto-stellar evolution calculations using the inferred accretion rate. theresulting mass of the star when it reaches the zero-age main sequence is m_zams~40 msun. we argue that, since the obtained m_zams is as large as the mass ofthe collapsing parent cloud, the final stellar mass should be close to thisvalue. such massive, rather than exceptionally massive, primordial stars areexpected to cause early chemical enrichment of the universe by exploding asblack hole-forming super/hypernovae, and may also be progenitors of highredshift gamma-ray bursts. the elemental abundance patterns of recentlydiscovered hyper metal-poor stars suggest that they might have been born fromthe interstellar medium that was metal-enriched by supernovae of these massiveprimordial stars.

0706.3706	modeling the dust properties of z ~ 6 quasars with art^2 --  all-wavelength radiative transfer with adaptive refinement tree	the detection of large quantities of dust in z ~ 6 quasars by infrared andradio surveys presents puzzles for the formation and evolution of dust in theseearly systems. previously (li et al. 2007), we showed that luminous quasars atz &gt; 6 can form through hierarchical mergers of gas-rich galaxies. here, wecalculate the dust properties of simulated quasars and their progenitors usinga three-dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer code, art^2 --all-wavelength radiative transfer with adaptive refinement tree. art^2incorporates a radiative equilibrium algorithm for dust emission, an adaptivegrid for inhomogeneous density, a multiphase model for the ism, and asupernova-origin dust model. we reproduce the sed and dust properties of sdssj1148+5251, and find that the infrared emission are closely associated with theformation and evolution of the quasar host. the system evolves from a cold to awarm ulirg owing to heating and feedback from stars and agn. furthermore, theagn has significant implications for the interpretation of observation of thehosts. our results suggest that vigorous star formation in merging progenitorsis necessary to reproduce the observed dust properties of z~6 quasars,supporting a merger-driven origin for luminous quasars at high redshifts andthe starburst-to-quasar evolutionary hypothesis.

0906.0458	the onset of star formation in primordial haloes	star formation remains an unsolved problem in astrophysics. numerical studiesof large-scale structure simulations cannot resolve the whole process and theirapproach usually assumes that only gas denser than a typical threshold can hostand form stars. we investigate the onset of cosmological star formation andcompare several very-high-resolution, three-dimensional, n-body/sph simulationsthat include non-equilibrium, atomic and molecular chemistry, star formationprescriptions, and feedback effects. we study how primordial star formationdepends on gas density thresholds, cosmological parameters and initial set-ups.for mean-density initial conditions, we find that standard low-densitystar-formation threshold (0.2 h^2/cm3) models predict the onset of starformation at z~25-31, depending on the adopted cosmology. in these models starsare formed regardless of the time between the moment when the threshold isreached and the effective runaway collapse. at high redshift, this timeinterval represents a significant fraction of the hubble time and thus thisassumption can induce large artificial off-sets to the onset of star formation.choosing higher density thresholds (135 h^2/cm3) allows the entire coolingprocess to be followed, and the onset of star formation is then estimated to beat redshift z~12-16. when isolated, rare, high-density peaks are considered,the chemical evolution is much faster and the first star formation episodesoccur at z &gt; 40, almost regardless of the choice for the density threshold.these results could have implications for the formation redshift of the firstcosmological objects, as inferred from direct numerical simulations ofmean-density environments, and on the studies of the reionization history ofthe universe.

0910.1634	accretion process onto super-spinning objects	the accretion process onto spinning objects in kerr spacetimes is studiedwith numerical simulations. our results show that accretion onto compactobjects with kerr parameter (characterizing the spin) $|a| &lt; m$ and $|a| &gt; m$is very different. in the super-spinning case, for $|a|$ moderately larger than$m$, the accretion onto the central object is extremely suppressed due to arepulsive force at short distance. the accreting matter cannot reach thecentral object, but instead is accumulated around it, forming a high densitycloud that continues to grow. the radiation emitted in the accretion processwill be harder and more intense than the one coming from standard black holes;e.g. $\gamma$-rays could be produced as seen in some observations.gravitational collapse of this cloud might even give rise to violent bursts. as$|a|$ increases, a larger amount of accreting matter reaches the central objectand the growth of the cloud becomes less efficient. our simulations find that aquasi-steady state of the accretion process exists for $|a|/m \gtrsim 1.4$,independently of the mass accretion rate at large radii. for such high valuesof the kerr parameter, the accreting matter forms a thin disk at very smallradii. we provide some analytical arguments to strengthen the numericalresults; in particular, we estimate the radius where the gravitational forcechanges from attractive to repulsive and the critical value $|a|/m \approx 1.4$separating the two qualitatively different regimes of accretion. we brieflydiscuss the observational signatures which could be used to look for suchexotic objects in the galaxy and/or in the universe.

0912.1381	non-gaussian error contribution to likelihood analysis of the matter  power spectrum	we study the sample variance of the matter power spectrum for the standardlambda cold dark matter universe. we use a total of 5000 cosmological n-bodysimulations to study in detail the distribution of best-fit cosmologicalparameters and the baryon acoustic peak positions. the obtained distribution iscompared with the results from the fisher matrix analysis with and withoutincluding non-gaussian errors. for the fisher matrix analysis, we compute thederivatives of the matter power spectrum with respect to cosmologicalparameters using directly full nonlinear simulations. we show that thenon-gaussian errors increase the unmarginalized errors by up to a factor 5 fork_{max}=0.4h/mpc if there is only one free parameter provided other parametersare well determined by external information. on the other hand, formulti-parameter fitting, the impact of the non-gaussian errors is significantlymitigated due to severe parameter degeneracies in the power spectrum. thedistribution of the acoustic peak positions is well described by a gaussiandistribution, with its width being consistent with the statistical intervalpredicted from the fisher matrix. we also examine systematic bias in thebest-fit parameter due to the non-gaussian errors. the bias is found to besmaller than the 1 sigma statistical error for both the cosmological parametersand the acoustic scale positions.

1008.4262	low-metallicity star formation : prestellar collapse and protostellar  accretion in the spherical symmetry	the collapse of dense cores with different metallicities is studied byhydrodynamical calculations coupled with detailed chemical and radiativeprocesses. for this purpose, we construct a simple chemical network withnon-equilibrium reactions among 15 chemical species, which reproduces theabundance of important molecular coolants by more detailed network very well.the evolution is followed until the formation of a hydrostatic protostar at thecenter. in a lower-metallicity gas cloud, the temperature during the collapseremains high owing to less efficient cooling. using the temperature evolutionat the center as a function the density, we discuss the possibility offragmentation during the dust-cooling phase. the critical metallicity for thefragmentation is 10^{-5}z_sun assuming moderate elongation of the cloud coresat the onset of this phase. from the density and velocity distributions at thetime of protostar formation, we evaluate the mass accretion rate in thesubsequent accretion phase. using these accretion rates, we also calculate theevolution of the protostars under the assumption of stationary accretion flow.finally, we discuss possible suppression of fragmentation by heating of theambient gas by protostellar radiation, which is considered important in thecontemporary star formation. we argue that it is negligible for &lt;10^{-2}zsun.

1009.0945	the nonlinear evolution of baryonic overdensities in the early universe:  initial conditions of numerical simulations	we run very large cosmological n-body hydrodynamical simulations in order tostudy statistically the baryon fractions in early dark matter halos. wecritically examine how differences in the initial conditions affect the gasfraction in the redshift range z = 11--21. we test three different linear powerspectra for the initial conditions: (1) a complete heating model, which is ourfiducial model; this model follows the evolution of overdensities correctly,according to naoz &amp; barkana (2005), in particular including the spatialvariation of the speed of sound of the gas due to compton heating from the cmb.(2) an equal-{\delta} model, which assumes that the initial baryon fluctuationsare equal to those of the dark matter, while conserving sigma8 of the totalmatter. (3) a mean cs model, which assumes a uniform speed of sound of the gas.the latter two models are often used in the literature. we calculate the baryonfractions for a large sample of halos in our simulations. our fiducial modelimplies that before reionization and significant stellar heating took place,the minimum mass needed for a minihalo to keep most of its baryons throughoutits formation was ~ 3 * 10^4 msun. however, the alternative models yield awrong (higher by about 50%) minimum mass, since the system retains a memory ofthe initial conditions. we also demonstrate this using the "filtering mass"from linear theory, which accurately describes the evolution of the baryonfraction throughout the simulated redshift range.

1203.0820	low-mass star formation triggered by early supernova explosions	we study the formation of low-mass and extremely metal-poor stars in theearly universe. our study is motivated by the recent discovery of a low-mass (m&lt; 0.8 msun) and extremely metal-poor (z &lt;= 4.5 x 10^{-5} zsun) star in thegalactic halo by caffau et al. we propose a model that early supernova (sn)explosions trigger the formation of low-mass stars via shell fragmentation. wefirst perform one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of anearly sn remnant. we show that the shocked shell undergoes efficient radiativecooling and then becomes gravitationally unstable to fragment and collapse inabout ten million years. we then follow the thermal evolution of the collapsingfragments using a one-zone code. our one-zone calculation treats chemistry andradiative cooling self-consistently in low-metallicity gas. the collapsing gascloud evolves roughly isothermally, until it cools rapidly by dust continuumemission at the density 10^{13}-10^{14} /cc. the cloud core then becomesthermally and gravitationally unstable and fragments. we argue that early snecan trigger the formation of low-mass stars in the extremely metal-poorenvironment as caffau et al. discovered recently.

1207.5515	simulations of early baryonic structure formation with stream velocity:  ii. the gas fraction	understanding the gas content of high redshift halos is crucial for studyingthe formation of the first generation of galaxies and reionization. recently,tseliakhovich &amp; hirata showed that the relative "stream" velocity between thedark matter and baryons at the time of recombination - formally a second ordereffect, but an unusually large one - can influence the later structureformation history of the universe. we quantify the effect of the streamvelocity on the so-called "characteristic mass" - the minimum mass of a darkmatter halo capable of retaining most of its baryons throughout its formationepoch - using three different high-resolution sets of cosmological simulations(with separate transfer functions for baryons and dark matter) that vary in boxsize, particle number, and the value of the relative velocity between the darkmatter and baryons. in order to understand this effect theoretically, wegeneralize the linear theory filtering mass to properly account for thedifference between the dark matter and baryonic density fluctuation evolutioninduced by the stream velocity. we show that the new filtering mass provides anaccurate estimate for the characteristic mass, while other theoretical ansatzesfor the characteristic mass are substantially less precise.

1209.2120	the nature of dark matter from the global high redshift hi 21 cm signal	we study the imprint of dark matter (dm) annihilation on the global 21 cmsignal from the dark ages to cosmic reionization. motivated by recentobservations, we focus on three dm candidates: (i) a 10 gev bino-likeneutralino (ii) a 200 gev wino and (iii) a 1 tev heavier particle annihilatinginto leptons. for each dm candidate we assume two values for the thermallyaveraged annihilation cross section \sigma v, the standard thermal value \sigmav_th = 3 x 10^-26 cm^3 s^-1 and the maximum value allowed by wmap7 data, \sigmav_max. we include the enhancement of dm annihilations due to collapsedstructures, detailed estimates of energy deposition into the intergalacticmedium (igm), as well realistic prescriptions for astrophysical sources of uvand x-ray radiation. in these models, the additional heat input from dmannihilation suppresses the mean 21cm brightness temperature offset by \deltatb ~ few-100 mk. in particular, the very deep \delta tb ~ -150 mk absorptionfeature at ~20 &lt; z &lt; 25 predicted by popular models of the first galaxies isconsiderably reduced or totally erased by some of the considered dm candidates.such an enhancement in igm heating could come from either dm annihilations or astronger-than-expected astrophysical component (i.e. abundant early x-raysources). however, we find that the two signatures are not degenerate, sincethe dm heating is dominated by halos several orders of magnitude smaller thanthose hosting galaxies, whose fractional abundance evolves more slowlyresulting in a smaller gradient: d \delta tb/d \nu &lt; 4 mk/mhz in the range \nu~60-80 mhz. the detection of such signals by future radio telescopes would beclear evidence of dm energy injection at high-redshifts.

1210.3035	protostellar feedback and final mass of the second-generation primordial  stars	the first stars in the universe ionized the ambient primordial gas throughvarious feedback processes. "second-generation" primordial stars potentiallyform from this disturbed gas after its recombination. in this letter, we studythe late formation stage of such second-generation stars, where a large amountof gas accretes onto the protostar and the final stellar mass is determinedwhen the accretion terminates. we directly compute the complex interplaybetween the accretion flow and stellar ultraviolet (uv) radiation, performingradiation-hydrodynamic simulations coupled with stellar evolution calculations.because of more efficient h2 and hd cooling in the pre-stellar stage, theaccretion rates onto the star are ten times lower than in the case of theformation of the first stars. the lower accretion rates and envelope densityresult in the occurrence of an expanding bipolar hii region at a lowerprotostellar mass m_* \simeq 10msun, which blows out the circumstellarmaterial, thereby quenching the mass supply from the envelope to the accretiondisk. at the same time the disk loses mass due to photoevaporation by thegrowing star. in our fiducial case the stellar uv feedback terminates massaccretion onto the star at m_* \simeq 17msun. although the derived masses ofthe second-generation primordial stars are systematically lower than those ofthe first generation, the difference is within a factor of only a few. ourresults suggest a new scenario, whereby the majority of the primordial starsare born as massive stars with tens of solar masses, regardless of theirgenerations.

1301.1217	modeling color-dependent galaxy clustering in cosmological simulations	we extend the subhalo abundance matching method to assign galaxy color tosubhalos. we separate a luminosity-binned subhalo sample into two groups by asecondary subhalo property which is presumed to be correlated with galaxycolor. the two subsamples then represent red and blue galaxy populations. weexplore two models for the secondary property, namely subhalo assembly time andlocal dark matter density around each subhalo. the model predictions for thegalaxy two-point correlation functions are compared with the recent resultsfrom the sloan digital sky survey. we show that the observed color dependenceof galaxy clustering can be reproduced well by our method applied tocosmological n-body simulations without baryonic processes. we then compare themodel predictions for the color-dependent galaxy-mass cross correlationfunctions with the results from gravitational lensing observations. thecomparison allows us to distinguish the models, and also to discuss whatsubhalo property should be used to assign color to subhalos accurately. we showthat the extended abundance matching method using the local dark matter densityas a color proxy provides an accurate description of the galaxy populations inthe local universe. we also study impacts of scatter in the local dark matterdensity-color relations. introducing scatter improves agreements of our modelpredictions with the observed red and blue galaxy clustering and is needed toexplain observed correlation functions in finer color bins. finally, we studyred galaxy fraction profiles in galaxy group- and cluster-sized halos and findthe red fraction profiles have a relatively strong dependence on our modelparameters. we argue that the red fraction profiles can be an importantobservational clue, in addition to galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing,to explore the galaxy-(sub)halo connections.

1404.7146	the dark ages of the universe and hydrogen reionization	one of the milestones in the cosmic history is the formation of the firstluminous objects and hydrogen reionization. the standard theory of cosmicstructure formation predicts that the first generation of stars were born abouta few hundred million years after the big bang. the dark universe was then litup once again, and eventually filled with ultraviolet photons emitted fromstars, galaxies, and quasars. the exact epoch of the cosmic reionization andthe details of the process, even the dominant sources, are not known except thefact that the universe was reionized early on. signatures of reionization areexpected to be imprinted in the cosmic microwave background radiation,especially in its large scale polarization. future cmb experiments, togetherwith other probes such as 21 cm surveys, will provide rich information on theprocess of reionization. we review recent studies on reionization. theimplications from available observations in a wide range of wavelengths arediscussed. results from state-of-the-art computer simulations are presented.finally, we discuss prospects for exploring the first few hundred million yearsof the cosmic history.

1404.7579	reproducing cosmic evolution of galaxy population from $z = 4$ to $0$	we present cosmological hydrodynamic simulations performed to study evolutionof galaxy population. the simulations follow timed release of mass, energy, andmetals by stellar evolution and employ phenomenological treatments of supernovafeedback, pre-supernova feedback modeled as feedback by radiation pressure frommassive stars, and quenching of gas cooling in large halos. we construct thefiducial model so that it reproduces the observationally estimated galaxystellar mass functions and the relationships between the galaxy stellar massand the host halo mass from $z = 4$ to 0. we find that the fiducial modelconstructed this way naturally explains the cosmic star formation history, thegalaxy downsizing, and the star formation rate and metallicity of thestar-forming galaxies. the simulations without the quenching of the gas coolingin large halos overproduce massive galaxies at $z &lt; 2$ and fail to reproducegalaxy downsizing. the simulations that do not employ the radiation pressurefeedback from young stars predict too strong redshift evolution of themass-metallicity relation. furthermore, the slope of the relation becomes toosteep at low redshift without the radiation pressure feedback. the metallicitydependence in the radiation pressure feedback is a key to explain the observedmass-metallicity relation. these facts indicate that these two processes inaddition to supernova feedback are essential for galaxy evolution. our simplephenomenological model is suitable to construct a mock galaxy sample to studyphysical properties of observed galaxy populations.

0705.1311	galaxy clustering constraints on deviations from newtonian gravity at  cosmological scales ii: perturbative and numerical analyses of power spectrum  and bispectrum	we explore observational constraints on possible deviations from newtoniangravity by means of large-scale clustering of galaxies. we measure the powerspectrum and the bispectrum of sloan digital sky survey galaxies and comparethe result with predictions in an empirical model of modified gravity. ourmodel assumes an additional yukawa-like term with two parameters thatcharacterize the amplitude and the length scale of the modified gravity. themodel predictions are calculated using two methods; the second-orderperturbation theory and direct n-body simulations. these methods allow us tostudy non-linear evolution of large-scale structure. using the simulationresults, we find that perturbation theory provides reliable estimates for thepower spectrum and the bispectrum in the modified newtonian model. we alsoconstruct mock galaxy catalogues from the simulations, and derive constraintson the amplitude and the length scale of deviations from newtonian gravity. theresulting constraints from power spectrum are consistent with those obtained inour earlier work, indicating the validity of the previous empirical modeling ofgravitational nonlinearity in the modified newtonian model. if linear biasingis adopted, the bispectrum of the sdss galaxies yields constraints very similarto those from the power spectrum. if we allow for the nonlinear biasinginstead, we find that the ratio of the quadratic to linear biasingcoefficients, b_2/b_1, should satisfy -0.4 &lt; b_2/b_1&lt;0.3 in the modifiednewtonian model.

1410.8384	supernova dust formation and the grain growth in the early universe: the  critical metallicity for low-mass star formation	we investigate the condition for the formation of low-mass second-generationstars in the early universe. it has been proposed that gas cooling by dustthermal emission can trigger fragmentation of a low-metallicity star-forminggas cloud. in order to determine the critical condition in which dust coolinginduces the formation of low-mass stars, we follow the thermal evolution of acollapsing cloud by a one-zone semi-analytic collapse model. earlier studiesassume the dust amount in the local universe, where all refractory elements aredepleted onto grains, and/or assume the constant dust amount during gascollapse. in this paper, we employ the models of dust formation and destructionin early supernovae to derive the realistic dust compositions and sizedistributions for multiple species as the initial conditions of our collapsecalculations. we also follow accretion of heavy elements in the gas phase ontodust grains, i.e., grain growth, during gas contraction. we find that graingrowth well alters the fragmentation property of the clouds, and that thisstill does not approach to the value in the local universe. the criticalconditions can be written by the gas metallicity zcr and the initial depletionefficiency fdep,0 of gas-phase metal onto grains, or dust-to-metal mass ratio,as (zcr/10^{-5.5} zsun) = (fdep,0/0.18)^{-0.44} with small scatters in therange of zcr = [0.06--3.2]x10^{-5} zsun. we also show that the initial dustcomposition and size distribution are important to determine zcr.

1501.01630	primordial star formation under the influence of far ultraviolet  radiation: 1540 cosmological halos and the stellar mass distribution	we perform a large set of cosmological simulations of early structureformation and follow the formation and evolution of 1540 star-forming gasclouds to derive the mass distribution of primordial stars. the star formationin our cosmological simulations is characterized by two distinct populations,the so-called population iii.1 stars and primordial stars formed under theinfluence of far ultraviolet (fuv) radiation (population iii.2d stars). in thiswork, we determine the stellar masses by using the dependences on the physicalproperties of star-forming cloud and/or the external photodissociatingintensity from nearby primordial stars, which are derived from the results oftwo-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of protostellar feedback.the characteristic mass of the pop iii stars is found to be a few hundred solarmasses at z ~ 25, and it gradually shifts to lower masses with decreasingredshift. at high redshifts z &gt; 20, about half of the star-forming gas cloudsare exposed to intense fuv radiation and thus give birth to massive pop iii.2dstars. however, the local fuv radiation by nearby pop iii stars becomes weakerat lower redshifts, when typical pop iii stars have smaller masses and the meanphysical separation between the stars becomes large owing to cosmic expansion.therefore, at z &lt; 20, a large fraction of the primordial gas clouds host popiii.1 stars. at z =&lt; 15, the pop iii.1 stars are formed in relatively cool gasclouds due to efficient radiative cooling by h_2 and hd molecules; such starshave masses of a few x 10 msun. since the stellar evolution and the final fateare determined by the stellar mass, pop iii stars formed at different epochsplay different roles in the early universe.

1501.02055	impact of baryonic processes on weak lensing cosmology: power spectrum,  non-local statistics, and parameter bias	we study the impact of baryonic physics on cosmological parameter estimationwith weak lensing surveys. we run a set of cosmological hydrodynamicssimulations with different galaxy formation models. we then perform ray-tracingsimulations through the total matter density field to generate 100 independentconvergence maps of 25 ${\rm deg}^2$ field-of-view, and use them to examine theability of the following three lensing statistics as cosmological probes; powerspectrum, peak counts, and minkowski functionals. for the upcoming wide-fieldobservations such as subaru hyper suprime-cam (hsc) survey with a sky coverageof 1400 ${\rm deg}^2$, these three statistics provide tight constraints on thematter density, density fluctuation amplitude, and dark energy equation ofstate, but parameter bias is induced by the baryonic processes such as gascooling and stellar feedback. the bias can be significant when the statisticalerrors become small in future observations with a much larger survey area. wefind the bias is induced in different directions in the parameter spacedepending on the statistics employed. while the two-point statistic, i.e. powerspectrum, yields robust results against baryonic effects, the overallconstraining power is weak compared with peak counts and minkowski functionals.on the other hand, using one of peak counts or minkowski functionals, orcombined analysis with multiple statistics, results in biased parameterestimate. the bias can be as large as $1\sigma$ for hsc survey, and will bemore significant for upcoming wider area surveys. we suggest to use anoptimized combination so that the baryonic effects on parameter estimation aremitigated. such `calibrated' combination can place stringent and robustconstraints on cosmological parameters.

1503.03480	probing the small scale matter power spectrum through dark matter  annihilation in the early universe	recent observations of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropies andthe distribution of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the lyman alpha forest haveconstrained the shape of the power spectrum of matter fluctuations on largescales k &lt; few h/mpc. we explore a new technique to constrain the matter powerspectrum on smaller scales, assuming the dark matter is a weakly interactingmassive particle (wimp) that annihilates at early epochs. energy released bydark matter annihilation can modify the spectrum of cmb temperaturefluctuations and thus cmb experiments such as planck have been able toconstrain the quantity f &lt;sigma v&gt; /m &lt; 1/88 picobarn c / gev, where f is thefraction of energy absorbed by gas, &lt;sigma v&gt; is the annihilation rate assumedconstant, and m is the particle mass. we assume the standard scale-invariantprimordial matter power spectrum of p_prim(k) ~ k^{n_s} at large scales k &lt;k_p, while we adopt the modified power law of p_prim(k) ~ k_p^{n_s}(k/k_p)^{m_s} at small scales. we then aim at deriving constraints on m_s. form_s &gt; n_s, the excess small-scale power results in a much larger number ofnonlinear small mass halos, particularly at high redshifts. dark matterannihilation in these halos releases sufficient energy to partially ionize thegas, and consequently modify the spectrum of cmb fluctuations. we show that therecent planck data can already be used to constrain the power spectrum on smallscales. for a simple model with an nfw profile with halo concentrationparameter c_200 = 5 and f &lt;sigma v&gt; / m = 1/100 picobarn c / gev, we can limitthe mass variance sigma_{max} &lt; 100 at the 95% confidence level, correspondingto a power law index m_s &lt; 1.43 (1.63) for k_p = 100 (1000) h/mpc. our resultsare also relevant to theories that feature a running spectral index.

1511.06080	supermassive star formation via episodic accretion: protostellar disc  instability and radiative feedback efficiency	the formation of smss is a potential pathway to seed smbhs in the earlyuniverse. a critical issue for forming smss is stellar uv feedback, which maylimit the stellar mass growth via accretion. in this paper we study theevolution of an accreting sms and its uv emissivity under conditions ofrealistic variable accretion from a self-gravitating circumstellar disc. firstwe conduct a 2d hydrodynamical simulation to follow the long-term protostellaraccretion until the stellar mass exceeds $10^4~m_\odot$. the disc fragments dueto gravitational instability, creating a number of small clumps that rapidlymigrate inward to fall onto the star. the resulting accretion history is thushighly time-dependent: short episodic accretion bursts are followed by longer,relative quiescent phases. we show that the circumstellar disc for theso-called direct collapse model is more unstable and generates greatervariability over shorter timescales than normal pop iii cases. we conduct apost-process stellar evolution calculation using the obtained accretionhistory. our results show that, regardless of the strong variability of theaccretion rates, the stellar radius monotonically increases with almostconstant effective temperature at $t_{\rm eff} \simeq 5000$ k as the stellarmass increases. the resulting uv feedback is too weak to hinder mass accretiondue to the low flux of stellar uv photons, thus verifying our implicitassumption of no stellar feedback during the hydrodynamic simulations. theinsensitivity of stellar evolution to variable accretion is attributed to thefact that typical timescales of variability, $\lesssim 10^3$ years, are tooshort to affect the stellar structure. we argue that this evolution willcontinue until the sms eventually collapses to produce a massive black hole bythe general relativistic instability after the stellar mass reaches $\gtrsim10^5~m_\odot$.

astro-ph;0006134	weakly self-interacting dark matter and the structure of dark halos	we study the formation of dark halos in a $\lambda$cdm universe under theassumption that cold dark matter particles have a finite cross-section forelastic collisions. we compare evolution when cdm mean free paths arecomparable to halo sizes with the collisionless and fluid limits. we show thata few collisions per particle per hubble time at halo centre can substantiallyaffect the central density profile. cross-sections an order of magnitude largerproduce sufficient relaxation for rich clusters to develop core radii in therange 100-200 $h^{-1}$kpc. the structural evolution of halos is a competitionbetween collisional relaxation caused by individual particle interactions andviolent relaxation resulting from the infall and merging processes by whichclusters grow. although our simulations concentrate on systems of cluster size,we can scale our results to address the halo structure expected for dwarfgalaxies. we find that collision cross-sections sufficiently large tosignificantly modify the cores of such galaxies produce cluster cores which aretoo large and/or too round to be consistent with observation. thus the simplestmodel for self-interacting dark matter is unable to improve fits to publisheddwarf galaxy rotation curves without violating other observational constraints.

astro-ph;0104332	non-gaussian cmb temperature fluctuations from peculiar velocities of  clusters	we use numerical simulations of a (480 mpc/h)^3 volume to show that thedistribution of peak heights in maps of the temperature fluctuations from thekinematic and thermal sunyaev-zeldovich effects will be highly non-gaussian,and very different from the peak height distribution of a gaussian randomfield. we then show that it is a good approximation to assume that each peak ineither sz effect is associated with one and only one dark matter halo. thisallows us to use our knowledge of the properties of haloes to estimate the peakheight distributions. at fixed optical depth, the distribution of peak heightsdue to the kinematic effect is gaussian, with a width which is approximatelyproportional to optical depth; the non-gaussianity comes from summing over arange of optical depths. the optical depth is an increasing function of halomass, and the distribution of halo speeds is gaussian, with a dispersion whichis approximately independent of halo mass. this means that observations of thekinematic effect can be used to put constraints on how the abundance of massiveclusters evolves, and on the evolution of cluster velocities. thenon-gaussianity of the thermal effect, on the other hand, comes primarily fromthe fact that, on average, the effect is larger in more massive haloes, and thedistribution of halo masses is highly non-gaussian. we also show that becausehaloes of the same mass may have a range of density and velocity dispersionprofiles, the relation between halo mass and the amplitude of the thermaleffect is not deterministic, but has some scatter.

astro-ph;0305187	modeling peculiar velocities of dark matter halos	we present a simple model that accurately describes various statisticalproperties of peculiar velocities of dark matter halos. we pay particularattention to the following two effects; first, the evolution of the halopeculiar velocity depends on the local matter density, instead of the globaldensity. second, dark matter halos are biased tracers of the underlying massdistribution, thus halos tend to be located preferentially at high densityregions. for the former, we develop an empirical model calibrated with n-bodysimulations, while for the latter, we use a conventional halo bias models basedon the extended press-schechter model combined with an empirical log-normalprobability distribution function of the mass density distribution. we findthat compared with linear theory, the present model significantly improves theaccuracy of predictions of statistical properties of the halo peculiar velocityfield including the velocity dispersion, the probability distribution function,and the pairwise velocity dispersion at large separations. thus our modelpredictions may be useful in analyzing future observations of the peculiarvelocities of galaxy clusters.

astro-ph;0305210	the evolution of baryon density fluctuations in multi-component  cosmological simulations	we critically examine how the evolution of the matter density field incosmological simulations is affected by details of setting up initialconditions. we show that it is non-trivial to realise an initial distributionof matter in n-body/hydrodynamic simulations so that the baryon and dark matterdensity fluctuations and their velocities evolve consistently as theoreticallypredicted. we perform a set of cosmological simulations and use them todistinguish and verify an appropriate method for generating initial conditions.we show that a straightforward way of applying the zel'dovich approximation toeach component using distinct transfer functions results in an incorrect growthof density fluctuations and that it is necessary to correct velocities at theinitial epoch. the unperturbed uniform particle distribution must be alsogenerated appropriately to avoid tight coupling of the baryonic and dark mattercomponents. we recommend using independent ``glass'' particle distributions,using distinct transfer functions for baryons and dark matter, and taking intoaccount the difference in the velocity fields at the initialisation epoch. theproposed method will be useful for studies of the evolution of theintergalactic medium and the formation of the first cosmological objects usingnumerical simulations.

astro-ph;0305517	early structure formation and reionization in a cosmological model with  a running primordial power spectrum	(abridged) we study high redshift structure formation and reionization in alcdm universe under the assumption that the spectral power index of primordialdensity fluctuations is a function of length scale. we adopt a particularformulation of the running spectral index (rsi) model as suggested by therecent wmap data. while early structure forms hierarchically in the rsi model,the reduced power on small scales causes a considerable delay in the formationepoch of low mass (~ 10^6 msun) ``mini-halos'' compared to the lcdm model. theextremely small number of gas clouds in the rsi model indicates thatreionization is initiated later than z&lt;15, generally resulting in a smallertotal thomson optical depth than in the lcdm model. by carrying out radiativetransfer calculations, we also study reionization by stellar populations formedin galaxies. even with a top-heavy intial mass function representing an earlypopulation of massive stars and/or an extraordinarily high photon emission ratefrom galaxies, the total optical depth can only be as large as tau ~ 0.1 forreasonable models of early star-formation. the rsi model is thus in conflictwith the large thomson optical depth inferred by the wmap satellite.

astro-ph;0309116	can non-gaussian cosmological models explain the wmap's high optical  depth for reionization?	the first-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data suggest a highoptical depth for thomson scattering of 0.17 +/- 0.04, implying that theuniverse was reionized at an early epoch, z ~ 20. such early reionization islikely to be caused by uv photons from first stars, but it appears that theobserved high optical depth can be reconciled within the standard structureformation model only if star-formation in the early universe was extremelyefficient. with normal star-formation efficiencies, cosmological models withnon-gaussian density fluctuations may circumvent this conflict as high densitypeaks collapse at an earlier epoch than in models with gaussian fluctuations.we study cosmic reionization in non-gaussian models and explore to what extent,within available constraints, non-gaussianities affect the reionizationhistory. for mild non-gaussian fluctuations at redshifts of 30 to 50, theincrease in optical depth remains at a level of a few percent and appearsunlikely to aid significantly in explaining the measured high optical depth. onthe other hand, within available observational constraints, increasing thenon-gaussian nature of density fluctuations can easily reproduce the opticaldepth and may remain viable in underlying models of non-gaussianity with ascale-dependence.

astro-ph;0310443	the era of massive population iii stars: cosmological implications and  self-termination	the birth and death of the first generation of stars have importantimplications for the thermal state and chemical properties of the intergalacticmedium (igm) in the early universe. sometime after recombination, the neutral,chemically pristine gas was reionized by ultraviolet photons emitted from thefirst stars, but also enriched with heavy elements when these stars ended theirlives as energetic supernovae. using the results from previous high-resolutioncosmological simulations of early structure formation that include radiativetransfer, we show that a significant volume fraction of the igm can bemetal-polluted, as well as ionized, by massive population iii stars formed insmall-mass (10^6-10^7 msun) halos early on. if most of the early generationstars die as pair-instability supernovae with energies up to 10^{53} ergs, thevolume-averaged mean metallicity will quickly reach z ~ 10^{-4}zsun by aredshift of 15-20, possibly causing a prompt transition to the formation of astellar population that is dominated by low-mass stars. in this scenario, theearly chemical enrichment history should closely trace the reionization historyof the igm, and the end of the population iii era is marked by the completionof reionization and pre-enrichment by z=15. we conclude that, while thepre-enrichment may partially account for the ``metallicity-floor'' inhigh-redshift lyman-alpha clouds, it does not significantly affect theelemental abundance in the intracluster medium.

astro-ph;0310607	searching for massive clusters in weak lensing surveys	we explore the ability of weak lensing surveys to locate massive clusters. weuse both analytic models of dark matter halos and mock weak lensing surveysgenerated from a large cosmological n-body simulation. the analytic modelsdescribe average properties of weak lensing halos and predict the numbercounts, enabling us to compute an effective survey selection function. we testthe model prediction for the peak number counts in weak lensing mass mapsagainst the mock numerical data, and find that the noise due to intrinsicgalaxy ellipticities causes a systematic effect which increases the peakcounts. we develop a correction scheme for the systematic effect in anempirical manner, and show that, after the correction, the model predictionagrees well with the mock data. the mock data is also used to examine thecompleteness and efficiency of the weak lensing halo search with fully takinginto account the noise and the projection effect by large-scale structures. weshow that the detection threshold of s/n=4-5 gives an optimal balance betweencompleteness and efficiency. our results suggest that, for a weak lensingsurvey with a galaxy number density of ng=30/arcmin^2 with a mean redshift z=1,the mean number of peaks in the 10sq deg area is n_peak=62 for a detectionthreshold s/n=4. the contamination rate is 42%, and thus, on average, 36 out of62 peaks (at least) are signals from real halos. weak lensing surveys thusprovide a reasonably efficient way to searching for massive clusters.

astro-ph;0404109	first sources in infrared light: stars, supernovae and miniquasars	the cosmic infrared background (irb) at wavelengths between 1 micron and 3microns provides a useful probe of early star-formation prior to and duringreionization. to explain the high optical depth to electron scattering, asmeasured by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap), one requiressignificant star-formation activity at redshifts 10 and higher. in addition tomassive stars, the irb flux may be contributed by a population of earlyminiquasars. we study the relative contributions from first stars, supernovaeand quasars to the irb for reasonable star formation rates at high redshift. ifminiquasars radiate efficiently at the eddington-limit, current backgroundmeasurements limit the fraction of mass in first stars that is converted toseed black holes to be roughly less than 10%. in the case of supernovae, thoughan individual supernova is much brighter than the progenitor star, due to theshorter lifetime of order few months, the fractional contribution to the irbremains at a level of 10% and below when compared to the same contribution fromstars. the bright supernovae may, however, be directly detectable by futurelarge ground-based and space telescopes.

astro-ph;0407599	statistical distribution of gravitational-lensing excursion angles:  winding ways to us from the deep universe	we investigate statistical distributions of differences ingravitational-lensing deflections between two light rays, the so-called lensingexcursion angles. a probability distribution function of the lensing excursionangles, which plays a key role in estimates of lensing effects on angularclustering of objects (such as galaxies, qsos and also the cmb temperaturemap), is known to consist of two components; a gaussian core and an exponentialtail. we use numerical gravitational-lensing experiments in a lambda-cdmcosmology for quantifying these two components. we especially focus on thephysical processes responsible for generating those two components. we developa simple empirical model for the exponential tail which allows us to exploreits origin. we find that the tail is generated by the coherent lensing scatterby massive halos with m&gt;10^14h^-1msun at z&lt;1 and that its exponential shapearises due to the exponential cut-off of the halo mass function at that massrange. on scales larger than 1 arc minute, the tail does not have a practicalinfluence on the lensing effects on the angular clustering. our model predictsthat the coherent scatter may have non-negligible effects on angular clusteringat sub-arcminute scales.

astro-ph;0410498	the temperature structure of the warm-hot intergalactic medium	we study the temperature structure of the intergalactic medium (igm) using alarge cosmological n-body/sph simulation. we employ a two-temperature model forthe thermal evolution of the ionized gas, in which the relaxation processbetween electrons and ions is explicitly included. in the diffuse, hot igm, therelaxation time is comparable to the age of the universe and hence the electrontemperature in post-shock regions remains significantly smaller than the iontemperature. we show that, at the present epoch, a large fraction of thewarm/hot intergalactic medium (whim) has a well-developed two temperaturestructure, with typical temperature differences of order a factor of a few.consequently, the fraction of metals in various ionization states such as ovi,ovii, and oviii, as well as their line emissivities, can differ locally by morethan an order of magnitude from those computed with a single temperature model.it is thus necessary to follow the evolution of the electron temperatureexplicitly to determine absorption and emission by the whim. althoughequipartition is nearly achieved in the denser intracluster medium (icm), wefind an appreciable systematic deviation between the gas-mass weighted electrontemperature and the mean temperature even at half the virial radii of clusters.there is thus a reservoir of warm (te &lt; 1kev) gas in and around massiveclusters. our results imply that relaxation processes need to be considered indescribing and interpreting observational data from existing x-ray telescopesas well as from future missions designed to detect the whim, such as thediffuse intergalactic oxygen surveyor and the missing baryon explorer.

astro-ph;0501366	galaxy clustering constraints on deviations from newtonian gravity at  cosmological scales	in spite of the growing observational evidence for dark matter and darkenergy in the universe, their physical nature is largely unknown. in fact,several authors have proposed modifications of newton's law of gravity atcosmological scales to account for the apparent acceleration of the cosmicexpansion. inspired by such suggestions, we attempt to constrain possibledeviations from newtonian gravity by means of the clustering of sdss (sloandigital sky survey) galaxies. to be specific, we assume a simple modificationof newton's law with an additional yukawa-type term characterized by theamplitude \alpha and the length scale \lambda. adopting spatially-flatuniverses dominated by cold dark matter and/or dark energy, we solve a linearperturbation equation for the growth of density fluctuations. in particular, wefind an exact analytic solution for the einstein -- de sitter case. followingthe peacock-dodds prescription, we compute the nonlinear power spectra of massfluctuations, perform a statistical comparison with the sdss galaxy data, andderive constraints in the \alpha-\lambda plane; for instance, we obtain theconstraints of -0.5&lt;\alpha &lt;0.6 and -0.8&lt;\alpha&lt;0.9 (99.7% confidence level)for \lambda=5h^{-1}mpc and 10h^{-1}mpc, respectively. we also discuss severalfuture possibilities for improving our analysis.

astro-ph;0503369	a merger-driven scenario for cosmological disk galaxy formation	(abridged) the violent hierarchical nature of the lcdm cosmology posesserious difficulties for the formation of disk galaxies. to help resolve theseissues, we describe a new, merger-driven scenario for the cosmologicalformation of disk galaxies at high redshifts that supplements the standardmodel based on dissipational collapse.in this picture, large gaseous disks maybe produced from high-angular momentum mergers of systems that aregas-dominated, i.e. m_gas/(m_gas +m_star &gt; 0.5 at the height of the merger.pressurization from the multiphase structure of the interstellar mediumprevents the complete conversion of gas into stars during the merger, and ifenough gas remains to form a disk, the remnant eventually resembles a diskgalaxy. we perform numerical simulations of galaxy mergers to study howsupernovae feedback strength, supermassive black hole growth and feedback,progenitor gas fraction, merger mass-ratio, and orbital geometry impact theformation of remnant disks. we find that disks can build angular momentumthrough mergers and the degree of rotational support of the baryons in themerger remnant is primarily related to feedback processes associated with starformation. disk-dominated remnants are restricted to form in mergers that aregas-dominated at the time of final coalescence and gas-dominated mergerstypically require extreme progenitor gas fractions (&gt;80%). we also show thatthe formation of rotationally-supported stellar systems in mergers is notrestricted to idealized orbits, or major or minor mergers. we suggest that thehierarchical nature of the lcdm cosmology and the physics of the interstellargas may act together to form spiral galaxies by building the angular momentumof disks through early, gas-dominated mergers.

astro-ph;0505368	supernova explosions in the early universe: evolution of radiative  remnants and the halo destruction efficiency	we study the evolution of supernova (sn) remnants of the first stars, takingproper account of the radiative feedback of the progenitor stars on thesurroundings. we carry out a series of one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulationswith radiative cooling, starting from initial configurations that are drawnfrom the results of our earlier radiation hydrodynamic simulations of the firsthii regions. in low-mass (&lt; 10^6 m_sun) halos, the stellar radiationsignificantly reduces the ambient gas density prior to the sn explosion. theblastwave quickly propagates over the halo's virial radius, leading to completeevacuation of the gas even with the input energy of 10^50 erg. we find that alarge fraction of the remnant's thermal energy is lost in 0.1-10 myr by linecooling, whereas, for larger explosion energies, the remnant expands even morerapidly with decreasing interior density, and cools predominantly via inversecompton process. in higher mass halos, the gas density near the explosion siteremains high and the sn shock is heavily confined; the thermal energy of theremnant is quickly radiated away by free-free emission, even if the total inputenergy exceeds the binding energy of halos by two orders of magnitude. we showthat the efficiency of halo destruction is determined not only by the explosionenergy but also by the gas density profile, and thus controlled by radiativefeedback prior to the explosion. several implications of our results for theformation of first quasars and second-generation stars in the universe are alsodiscussed.
