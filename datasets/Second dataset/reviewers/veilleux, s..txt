0904.4498	goals: the great observatories all-sky lirg survey	the great observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals) combines data from nasa'sspitzer, chandra, hubble and galex observatories, together with ground-baseddata into a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey of over 200 lowredshift luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs). the lirgs are a complete subset ofthe iras revised bright galaxy sample (rbgs). the lirgs targeted in goals spanthe full range of nuclear spectral types defined via traditional opticalline-ratio diagrams as well as interaction stages. they provide an unbiasedpicture of the processes responsible for enhanced infrared emission in galaxiesin the local universe. as an example of the analytic power of themulti-wavelength goals dataset, we present data for the interacting system vv340 (iras f14547+2449). between 80-95% of the total far-infrared emission (orabout 5e11 solar luminosities) originates in vv 340 north. while the iraccolors of vv 340 north and south are consistent with star-forming galaxies,both the spitzer irs and chandra acis data indicate the presence of a buriedagn in vv 340 north. the galex far and near-uv fluxes imply a extremely largeinfrared "excess" (irx) for the system (ir/fuv = 81) which is well above thecorrelation seen in starburst galaxies. most of this excess is driven by vv 340n, which alone has an ir excess of nearly 400. the vv 340 system seems to becomprised of two very different galaxies - an infrared luminous edge-on galaxy(vv 340 north) that dominates the long-wavelength emission from the system andwhich hosts a buried agn, and a face-on starburst (vv 340 south) that dominatesthe short-wavelength emission.

0905.1577	spitzer quasar and ulirg evolution study (quest). iv. comparison of 1-jy  ultraluminous infrared galaxies with palomar-green quasars	we report the results from a comprehensive study of 74 ultraluminous infraredgalaxies (ulirgs) and 34 palomar-green (pg) quasars within z ~ 0.3$ observedwith the spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs). the contribution of nuclearactivity to the bolometric luminosity in these systems is quantified using sixindependent methods that span a range in wavelength and give consistent resultswithin ~ +/-10-15% on average. the average derived agn contribution in ulirgsis ~35-40%, ranging from ~15-35% among "cool" (f_25/f_60 =&lt; 0.2) opticallyclassified hii-like and liner ulirgs to ~50 and ~75% among warm seyfert 2 andseyfert 1 ulirgs, respectively. this number exceeds ~80% in pg qsos. ulirgsfall in one of three distinct agn classes: (1) objects with small extinctionsand large pah equivalent widths are highly starburst-dominated; (2) systemswith large extinctions and modest pah equivalent widths have larger agncontributions, but still tend to be starburst-dominated; and (3) ulirgs withboth small extinctions and small pah equivalent widths host agn that are atleast as powerful as the starbursts. the agn contributions in class 2 ulirgsare more uncertain than in the other objects, and we cannot formally rule outthe possibility that these objects represent a physically distinct type ofulirgs. a morphological trend is seen along the sequence (1)-(2)-(3), ingeneral agreement with the standard ulirg - qso evolution scenario andsuggestive of a broad peak in extinction during the intermediate stages ofmerger evolution. however, the scatter in this sequence, implies that blackhole accretion, in addition to depending on the merger phase, also has a strongchaotic/random component, as in local agn.

0906.3157	a deep hst h-band imaging survey of massive gas-rich mergers. ii. the  quest pg qsos	we report the results from a deep hst nicmos h-band imaging survey of 28 z &lt;0.3 qsos from the palomar-green (pg) sample. this program is part of quest(quasar / ulirg evolution study) and complements a similar set of data on 26highly-nucleated ulirgs presented in paper i. our analysis indicates that thefraction of qsos with elliptical hosts is higher among qsos with undetectedfar-infrared (fir) emission, small infrared excess, and luminous hosts. thehosts of fir-faint qsos show a tendency to have less pronounced merger-inducedmorphological anomalies and larger qso-to-host luminosity ratios on averagethan the hosts of fir-bright qsos, consistent with late-merger evolution fromfir-bright to fir-faint qsos. the spheroid sizes and total host luminosities ofthe radio-quiet pg qsos in our sample are statistically indistinguishable fromthe ulirg hosts presented in paper i, while those of radio-loud pg qsos aresystematically larger and more luminous. ulirgs and pg qsos with ellipticalhosts fall near, but not exactly on, the fundamental plane of inactivespheroids. we confirm the systematic trend noted in paper i for objects withsmall (&lt; 2 kpc) spheroids to be up to ~1 mag. brighter than inactive spheroids.the host colors and wavelength dependence of their sizes support the idea thatthese deviations are due at least in part to non-nuclear star formation.however, the amplitudes of these deviations does not depend on host r-h colors.taken at face value (i.e., no correction for extinction or the presence of ayoung stellar population), the h-band spheroid-host luminosities imply bhmasses ~5 -- 200 x 10^7 m_sun and sub-eddington mass accretion rates for bothqsos and ulirgs. these results are compared with published bh mass estimatesderived from other methods.

1004.3543	the buried starburst in the interacting galaxy ii zw 096 as revealed by  the spitzer space telescope	an analysis of data from the spitzer space telescope, hubble space telescope,chandra x-ray observatory, and akari infrared astronomy satellite is presentedfor the z=0.036 merging galaxy system ii zw 096 (cgcg 448-020). because ii zw096 has an infrared luminosity of log(l_ir/l_sun) = 11.94, it is classified asa luminous infrared galaxy (lirg), and was observed as part of the greatobservatories all-sky lirg survey (goals). the spitzer data suggest that 80% ofthe total infrared luminosity comes from an extremely compact, red source notassociated with the nuclei of the merging galaxies. the spitzer mid-infraredspectra indicate no high-ionization lines from a buried active galactic nucleusin this source. the strong detection of the 3.3 micron and 6.2 micron pahemission features in the akari and spitzer spectra also implies that the energysource of ii zw 096 is a starburst. based on spitzer infrared imaging and akarinear-infrared spectroscopy, the star formation rate is estimated to be 120m_sun/yr and &gt; 45 m_sun/yr, respectively. finally, the high-resolution b, i,and h-band images show many star clusters in the interacting system. the colorsof these clusters suggest at least two populations - one with an age of 1-5 myrand one with an age of 20-500 myr, reddened by 0-2 magnitudes of visualextinction. the masses of these clusters span a range between 10^6-10^8 m_sun.this starburst source is reminiscent of the extra-nuclear starburst seen in ngc4038/9 (the antennae galaxies) and arp 299 but approximately an order ofmagnitude more luminous than the antennae. the source is remarkable in that theoff-nuclear infrared luminosity dominates the enitre system.

1005.2877	black hole accretion and star formation as drivers of gas excitation and  chemistry in mrk231	we present a full high resolution spire fts spectrum of the nearbyultraluminous infrared galaxy mrk231. in total 25 lines are detected, includingco j=5-4 through j=13-12, 7 rotational lines of h2o, 3 of oh+ and one line eachof h2o+, ch+, and hf. we find that the excitation of the co rotational levelsup to j=8 can be accounted for by uv radiation from star formation. however,the approximately flat luminosity distribution of the co lines over therotational ladder above j=8 requires the presence of a separate source ofexcitation for the highest co lines. we explore x-ray heating by the accretingsupermassive black hole in mrk231 as a source of excitation for these lines,and find that it can reproduce the observed luminosities. we also consider amodel with dense gas in a strong uv radiation field to produce the highest colines, but find that this model strongly overpredicts the hot dust mass inmrk231. our favoured model consists of a star forming disk of radius 560 pc,containing clumps of dense gas exposed to strong uv radiation, dominating theemission of co lines up to j=8. x-rays from the accreting supermassive blackhole in mrk231 dominate the excitation and chemistry of the inner disk out to aradius of 160 pc, consistent with the x-ray power of the agn in mrk231. theextraordinary luminosity of the oh+ and h2o+ lines reveals the signature ofx-ray driven excitation and chemistry in this region.

1005.3642	herschel observations of water vapour in markarian 231	the ultra luminous infrared galaxy mrk 231 reveals up to seven rotationallines of water (h2o) in emission, including a very high-lying (e_{upper}=640 k)line detected at a 4sigma level, within the herschel/spire wavelength range,whereas pacs observations show one h2o line at 78 microns in absorption, asfound for other h2o lines previously detected by iso. the absorption/emissiondichotomy is caused by the pumping of the rotational levels by far-infraredradiation emitted by dust, and subsequent relaxation through lines at longerwavelengths, which allows us to estimate both the column density of h2o and thegeneral characteristics of the underlying far-infrared continuum source.radiative transfer models including excitation through both absorption offar-infrared radiation emitted by dust and collisions are used to calculate theequilibrium level populations of h2o and the corresponding line fluxes. thehighest-lying h2o lines detected in emission, with levels at 300-640 k abovethe ground state, indicate that the source of far-infrared radiationresponsible for the pumping is compact (radius=110-180 pc) and warm(t_{dust}=85-95 k), accounting for at least 45% of the bolometric luminosity.the high column density, n(h2o)~5x10^{17} cm^{-2}, found in this nuclearcomponent, is most probably the consequence of shocks/cosmic rays, an xdrchemistry, and/or an "undepleted chemistry" where grain mantles are evaporated.a more extended region, presumably the inner region of the 1-kpc disk observedin other molecular species, could contribute to the flux observed in low-lyingh2o lines through dense hot cores, and/or shocks. the h2o 78 micron lineobserved with pacs shows hints of a blue-shifted wing seen in absorption,possibly indicating the occurrence of h2o in the prominent outflow detected inoh (fischer et al., this volume).

1006.2873	ultra-deep spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of lirgs and ulirgs at z ~  1-2	we present ultra-deep mid-ir spectra of 48 infrared-luminous galaxies in thegoods-south field obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs) on the spitzerspace telescope. these galaxies are selected among faint infrared sources (0.14- 0.5 mjy at 24 um) in two redshift bins (0.76-1.05 and 1.75-2.4) to sample themajor contributors to the cosmic infrared background at the most active epochs.we estimate redshifts for 92% of the sample using pah and si absorptionfeatures. only few of these galaxies (5% at z~1 and 12% at z~2) have theirtotal infrared luminosity dominated by emission from agn. the averaged mid-irspectra of the z~1 lirgs and of the z~2 ulirgs are very similar to the averagedspectrum of local starbursts and hii-like ulirgs, respectively. we find that6.2um pah equivalent widths reach a plateau of ~1 um for l(24 mu) &lt; 1e11l(sun). at higher luminosities, ew (6.2 mu) anti-correlates with l(24 um).intriguingly, high-z ulirgs and smg lie above the local ew (6.2 um) - l(24 um)relationship suggesting that, at a given luminosity, high-z ulirgs have agncontributions to their dust emission lower than those of local counterparts. aquantitative analysis of their morphology shows that most of the luminous irgalaxies have morphologies similar to those of ir-quiet galaxies at the sameredshift. all z~2 ulirgs of our sample are ir-excess bzk galaxies and most ofthem have l(fir)/l(1600a) ratios higher than those of starburst galaxies at agiven uv slope. the ``ir excess'' (daddi et al. 2007) is mostly due to strong7.7 um pah emission and under-estimation of uv dust extinction. on the basis ofthe agn-powered l (6 um) continuum measured directly from the mid-ir spectra,we estimate an average intrinsic x-ray agn luminosity of l(2-10 kev) = (0.1 +/-0.6) 1e43 erg/s, a value substantially lower than the prediction by daddi etal.

1009.0038	the spatial extent of (u)lirgs in the mid-infrared i: the continuum  emission	we present an analysis of the extended mid-infrared (mir) emission of thegreat observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals) sample based on 5-15um lowresolution spectra obtained with the irs on spitzer. we calculate the fractionof extended emission as a function of wavelength for the galaxies in thesample, fee_lambda. we can identify 3 general types of fee_lambda: one where itis constant, one where features due to emission lines and pahs appear moreextended than the continuum, and a third which is characteristic of sourceswith deep silicate absorption at 9.7um. more than 30% of the galaxies have amedian fee_lambda larger than 0.5 implying that at least half of their miremission is extended. luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) display a wide rangeof fee in their warm dust continuum (0&lt;=fee_13.2um&lt;=0.85). the large values offee_13.2um that we find in many lirgs suggest that their extended mir continuumemission originates in scales up to 10kpc. the mean size of the lirg cores at13.2um is 2.6kpc. however, once the lir of the systems reaches the threshold of~10^11.8lsun, all sources become clearly more compact, with fee_13.2um&lt;=0.2,and their cores are unresolved. our estimated upper limit for the core size ofulirgs is less than 1.5kpc. the analysis indicates that the compactness ofsystems with lir&gt;~10^11.25lsun strongly increases in those classified asmergers in their final stage of interaction. the fee_13.2um is also related tothe contribution of an active galactic nucleus (agn) to the mir. galaxies whichare more agn-dominated are less extended, independently of their lir. wefinally find that the extent of the mir continuum emission is correlated withthe far-ir iras log(f_60um/f_100um) color. this enables us to place a lowerlimit to the area in a galaxy from where the cold dust emission may originate,a prediction which can be tested soon with the herschel space telescope.

1012.1891	mid-infrared spectral diagnostics of luminous infrared galaxies	we present a statistical analysis of the mid-infrared (mir) spectra of 248luminous infrared (ir) galaxies (lirgs) which comprise the great observatoriesall-sky lirg survey (goals) observed with the infrared spectrograph (irs)on-board the spitzer space telescope. the goals sample enables a directmeasurement of the relative contributions of star-formation and active galacticnuclei (agn) to the total ir emission from a large sample of local lirgs. theagn contribution to the mir emission (f-agn) is estimated by employing severaldiagnostics based on the properties of the [nev], [oiv] and [neii] finestructure gas emission lines, the 6.2 microns pah and the shape of the mircontinuum. we find that 18% of all lirgs contain an agn and that in 10% of allsources the agn contributes more than 50% of the total ir luminosity. summingup the total ir luminosity contributed by agn in all our sources suggests thatagn supply ~12% of the total energy emitted by lirgs. the average spectrum ofsources with an agn looks similar to the average spectrum of sources without anagn, but it has lower pah emission and a flatter mir continuum. agn dominatedlirgs have higher ir luminosities, warmer mir colors and are found ininteracting systems more often than pure starbursts lirgs. however we find nolinear correlations between these properties and f-agn. we used the irac colorsof lirgs to confirm that finding agn on the basis of their mir colors may miss~40% of agn dominated (u)lirgs

1105.1731	massive molecular outflows and negative feedback in ulirgs observed by  herschel-pacs	mass outflows driven by stars and active galactic nuclei are a key element inmany current models of galaxy evolution. they may produce the observed blackhole-galaxy mass relation and regulate and quench both star formation in thehost galaxy and black hole accretion. however, observational evidence of suchfeedback processes through outflows of the bulk of the star forming moleculargas is still scarce. here we report the detection of massive molecularoutflows, traced by the hydroxyl molecule (oh), in far-infrared spectra ofulirgs obtained with herschel-pacs as part of the shining key project. in someof these objects the (terminal) outflow velocities exceed 1000 km/s, and theiroutflow rates (up to ~1200 m_sol/yr) are several times larger than their starformation rates. we compare the outflow signatures in different types of ulirgsand in starburst galaxies to address the issue of the energy source (agn orstarburst) of these outflows. we report preliminary evidence that ulirgs with ahigher agn luminosity (and higher agn contribution to l_ir) have higherterminal velocities and shorter gas depletion time scales. the outflows in theobserved ulirgs are able to expel the cold gas reservoirs from the centres ofthese objects within ~1e6-1e8 years.

1208.2962	a massive, cooling-flow-induced starburst in the core of a highly  luminous galaxy cluster	in the cores of some galaxy clusters the hot intracluster plasma is denseenough that it should cool radiatively in the cluster's lifetime, leading tocontinuous "cooling flows" of gas sinking towards the cluster center, yet nosuch cooling flow has been observed. the low observed star formation rates andcool gas masses for these "cool core" clusters suggest that much of the coolingmust be offset by astrophysical feedback to prevent the formation of a runawaycooling flow. here we report x-ray, optical, and infrared observations of thegalaxy cluster spt-clj2344-4243 at z = 0.596. these observations reveal anexceptionally luminous (l_2-10 kev = 8.2 x 10^45 erg/s) galaxy cluster whichhosts an extremely strong cooling flow (dm/dt = 3820 +/- 530 msun/yr). further,the central galaxy in this cluster appears to be experiencing a massivestarburst (740 +/- 160 msun/yr), which suggests that the feedback sourceresponsible for preventing runaway cooling in nearby cool core clusters may notyet be fully established in spt-clj2344-4243. this large star formation rateimplies that a significant fraction of the stars in the central galaxy of thiscluster may form via accretion of the intracluster medium, rather than thecurrent picture of central galaxies assembling entirely via mergers.

1208.3248	investigation of dual active nuclei, outflows, shock-heated gas, and  young star clusters in markarian 266	results of observations with the spitzer, hubble, galex, chandra, andxmm-newton space telescopes are presented for the luminous infrared galaxy(lirg) merger mrk 266. the sw (seyfert 2) and ne (liner) nuclei reside ingalaxies with hubble types sbb (pec) and s0/a (pec), respectively. bothgalaxies have l &gt; l*, and they are inferred to each contain a ~2.5x10^8 m_sunblack hole. mrk 266 sw is likely the primary source of a bright fe k-alpha linedetected from the system, consistent with the reflection-dominated x-rayspectrum of a heavily obscured agn. optical knots embedded in an arc withaligned radio continuum radiation, combined with luminous h_2 line emission,provide evidence for a radiative bow shock in an agn-driven outflow surroundingthe ne nucleus. soft x-ray emission modeled as shock-heated plasma isco-spatial with radio continuum emission between the galaxies. mid-irdiagnostics indicate roughly equal contributions of agn and starburst radiationpowering the bolometric luminosity. approximately 120 star clusters have beendetected, with most having estimated ages &lt; 50 myr. detection of 24 micronemission extending ~34 arcsec (20 kpc) north of the galaxies is interpreted as~2x10^7 m_sun of dust entrained in an outflowing superwind; at opticalwavelengths this region is resolved into a fragmented morphology indicative ofrayleigh-taylor instabilities in an expanding shell of ionized gas. mrk 266demonstrates that the dust "blow-out" phase can begin in a lirg well before thegalaxies fully coalesce during a subsequent ulirg phase, and rapid gasconsumption in luminous dual agns (kpc scale separations) early in the mergerprocess may explain the paucity of detected binary qsos (sub-pc scale orbits)in large surveys. an evolutionary sequence is proposed representing aprogression from dual to binary agns, accompanied by an increase in observedl_x/l_ir ratios by 10^4 or more.

1211.5064	excited oh+, h2o+, and h3o+ in ngc 4418 and arp 220	we report on herschel/pacs observations of absorption lines of oh+, h2o+ andh3o+ in ngc 4418 and arp 220. excited lines of oh+ and h2o+ with e_lower of atleast 285 and \sim200 k, respectively, are detected in both sources, indicatingradiative pumping and location in the high radiation density environment of thenuclear regions. abundance ratios oh+/h2o+ of 1-2.5 are estimated in the nucleiof both sources. the inferred oh+ column and abundance relative to h nuclei are(0.5-1)x10^{16} cm-2 and \sim2x10^{-8}, respectively. additionally, in arp 220,an extended low excitation component around the nuclear region is found to haveoh+/h2o+\sim5-10. h3o+ is detected in both sources withn(h3o+)\sim(0.5-2)x10^{16} cm-2, and in arp 220 the pure inversion, metastablelines indicate a high rotational temperature of ~500 k, indicative of formationpumping and/or hot gas. simple chemical models favor an ionization sequencedominated by h+ - o+ - oh+ - h2o+ - h3o+, and we also argue that the h+production is most likely dominated by x-ray/cosmic ray ionization. the fullset of observations and models leads us to propose that the molecular ionsarise in a relatively low density (\gtrsim10^4 cm-3) interclump medium, inwhich case the ionization rate per h nucleus (including secondary ionizations)is zeta&gt;10^{-13} s-1, a lower limit that is severalx10^2 times the highest rateestimates for galactic regions. in arp 220, our lower limit for zeta iscompatible with estimates for the cosmic ray energy density inferred previouslyfrom the supernova rate and synchrotron radio emission, and also with theexpected ionization rate produced by x-rays. in ngc 4418, we argue that x-rayionization due to an agn is responsible for the molecular ion production.

1211.6659	evidence for co shock excitation in ngc 6240 from herschel spire  spectroscopy	we present herschel spire fts spectroscopy of the nearby luminous infraredgalaxy ngc 6240. in total 20 lines are detected, including co j=4-3 throughj=13-12, 6 h2o rotational lines, and [ci] and [nii] fine-structure lines. theco to continuum luminosity ratio is 10 times higher in ngc 6240 than mrk 231.although the co ladders of ngc 6240 and mrk 231 are very similar, uv and/orx-ray irradiation are unlikely to be responsible for the excitation of the gasin ngc 6240. we applied both c and j shock models to the h2 v=1-0 s(1) andv=2-1 s(1) lines and the co rotational ladder. the co ladder is best reproducedby a model with shock velocity v_s=10 km s^-1 and a pre-shock density n_h=5 *10^4 cm^-3. we find that the solution best fitting the h2 lines is degenerate:the shock velocities and number densities range between v_s = 17 - 47 km s^-1and n_h=10^7 - 5 * 10^4 cm^-3, respectively. the h2 lines thus need a much morepowerful shock than the co lines. we deduce that most of the gas is currentlymoderately stirred up by slow (10 km s^-1) shocks while only a small fraction(&lt; 1 percent) of the ism is exposed to the high velocity shocks. this impliesthat the gas is rapidly loosing its highly turbulent motions. we argue that ahigh co line-to-continuum ratio is a key diagnostic for the presence of shocks.

1212.2401	the surprising absence of absorption in the far-ultraviolet spectrum of  mrk 231	mrk 231, the nearest (z = 0.0422) quasar, hosts both a galactic-scale windand a nuclear-scale iron low-ionization broad absorption line (felobal)outflow. we recently obtained a far-ultraviolet (fuv) spectrum of this objectcovering ~1150 - 1470 a with the cosmic origins spectrograph on board thehubble space telescope. this spectrum is highly peculiar, highlighted by thepresence of faint (~&lt; 2% of predictions based on h-alpha), broad (&gt;~ 10,000km/s at the base), and highly blueshifted (centroid at ~ -3500 km/s) ly-alphaemission. the fuv continuum emission is slightly declining at shorterwavelengths (consistent with f_lambda ~ lambda^1.7) and does not show thepresence of any obvious photospheric or wind stellar features. surprisingly,the fuv spectrum also does not show any unambiguous broad absorption features.it thus appears to be dominated by the agn, rather than hot stars, andvirtually unfiltered by the dusty felobal screen. the observed ly-alphaemission is best explained if it is produced in the outflowing bal cloudsystem, while the balmer lines arise primarily from the standard broad emissionline region seen through the dusty (a_v ~ 7 mag.) broad absorption line region.two possible geometric models are discussed in the context of these newresults.

1308.3139	fast molecular outflows in luminous galaxy mergers: evidence for quasar  feedback from herschel	we report the results from a systematic search for molecular (oh-119 um)outflows with herschel-pacs in a sample of 43 nearby (z &lt; 0.3) galaxy mergers,mostly ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) and qsos. we find that thecharacter of the oh feature (strength of the absorption relative to theemission) correlates with that of the 9.7-um silicate feature, a measure ofobscuration in ulirgs. unambiguous evidence for molecular outflows, based onthe detection of oh absorption profiles with median velocities more blueshiftedthan -50 km/sec, is seen in 26 (70%) of the 37 oh-detected targets, suggestinga wide-angle (~145 degrees) outflow geometry. conversely, unambiguous evidencefor molecular inflows, based on the detection of oh absorption profiles withmedian velocities more redshifted than +50 km/sec, is seen in only 4 objects,suggesting a planar or filamentary geometry for the inflowing gas. terminaloutflow velocities of ~-1000 km/sec are measured in several objects, but medianoutflow velocities are typically ~-200 km s^{-1}. while the outflow velocitiesshow no statistically significant dependence on the star formation rate, theyare distinctly more blueshifted among systems with large agn fractions andluminosities [log (l_agn / l_sun) &gt; 11.8 +/- 0.3]. the quasars in these systemsplay a dominant role in driving the molecular outflows. in contrast, the mostagn dominated systems, where oh is seen purely in emission, show relativelymodest oh line widths, despite their large agn luminosities, perhaps indicatingthat molecular outflows subside once the quasar has cleared a path through theobscuring material.

1310.3074	the mrk 231 molecular outflow as seen in oh	we report on the herschel/pacs observations of oh in mrk 231, with detectionsin 9 doublets observed within the pacs range, and present radiative transfermodels for the outflowing oh. signatures of outflowing gas are found in up to 6oh doublets with different excitation requirements. at least two outflowingcomponents are identified, one with oh radiatively excited, and the other withlow excitation, presumably spatially extended. particularly prominent, the bluewing of the absorption detected in the in-ladder 2pi_{3/2} j=9/2-7/2 oh doubletat 65 um, with e_lower=290 k, indicates that the excited outflowing gas isgenerated in a compact and warm (circum)nuclear region. because the excited,outflowing oh gas in mrk 231 is associated with the warm, far-ir continuumsource, it is likely more compact (diameter of 200-300 pc) than that probed byco and hcn. nevertheless, its mass-outflow rate per unit of solid angle asinferred from oh is similar to that previously derived from co,&gt;~70x(2.5x10^{-6}/x_{oh}) msun yr^{-1} sr^{-1}, where x_{oh} is the ohabundance relative to h nuclei. in spherical symmetry, this would correspond to&gt;~850x(2.5x10^{-6}/x_{oh}) msun yr^{-1}, though significant collimation isinferred from the line profiles. the momentum flux of the excited componentattains ~15 l_{agn}/c, with an oh column density of (1.5-3)x10^{17} cm^-2 and amechanical luminosity of ~10^{11} lsun. the detection of very excited ohpeaking at central velocities indicates the presence of a nuclear reservoir ofgas rich in oh, plausibly the 130-pc scale circumnuclear torus previouslydetected in oh megamaser emission, that may be feeding the outflow. anexceptional ^{18}oh enhancement, with oh/^{18}oh&lt;~30 at both central andblueshifted velocities, is likely the result of interstellar-medium processingby recent starburst/sne activity.

0801.4637	extended silicate dust emission in pg qsos	this paper addresses the origin of the silicate emission observed in pg qsos,based on observations with the spitzer space telescope. scenarios based on theunified model suggest that silicate emission in agn arises mainly from theilluminated faces of the clouds in the torus at temperatures near sublimation.however, detections of silicate emission in type 2 qsos, and the estimated cooldust temperatures, argue for a more extended emission region.to investigatethis issue we present the mid-infrared spectra of 23 qsos. these spectra, andespecially the silicate emission features at ~10 and ~18 mu can be fitted usingdusty narrow line region (nlr) models and a combination of black bodies. thebolometric luminosities of the qsos allow us to derive the radial distances andcovering factors for the silicate-emitting dust. the inferred radii are 100-200times larger than the dust sublimation radius, much larger than the expecteddimensions of the inner torus. our qso mid-ir spectra are consistent with thebulk of the silicate dust emission arising from the dust in the innermost partsof the nlr.

1311.2595	massive molecular outflows and evidence for agn feedback from co  observations	we study the properties of massive, galactic-scale outflows of molecular gasand investigate their impact on galaxy evolution. we present new iram pdbico(1-0) observations of local ulirgs and qso hosts: clear signature of massiveand energetic molecular outflows, extending on kpc scales, is found in theco(1-0) kinematics of four out of seven sources, with measured outflow rates ofseveral 100 msun/yr. we combine these new observations with data from theliterature, and explore the nature and origin of massive molecular outflowswithin an extended sample of 19 local galaxies. we find thatstarburst-dominated galaxies have an outflow rate comparable to their sfr, oreven higher by a factor of ~ 2-4, implying that starbursts can indeed beeffective in removing cold gas from galaxies. nevertheless, our results suggestthat the presence of an agn can boost the outflow rate by a large factor, whichis found to increase with the l_agn/l_bol ratio. the gas depletion time-scalesdue to molecular outflows are anti-correlated with the presence and luminosityof an agn in these galaxies, and range from a few hundred million years instarburst galaxies, down to just a few million years in galaxies hostingpowerful agns. in quasar hosts the depletion time-scales due to the outflow aremuch shorter than the depletion time-scales due to star formation. we estimatethe outflow kinetic power and find that, for galaxies hosting powerful agns, itcorresponds to about 5% of the agn luminosity, as expected by models of agnfeedback. moreover, we find that momentum rates of about 20 l_agn/c are commonamong the agn-dominated sources in our sample. for "pure" starburst galaxiesour data tentatively support models in which outflows are mostlymomentum-driven by the radiation pressure from young stars onto dusty clouds.

1501.07664	wind from the black-hole accretion disk driving a molecular outflow in  an active galaxy	powerful winds driven by active galactic nuclei (agn) are often invoked toplay a fundamental role in the evolution of both supermassive black holes(smbhs) and their host galaxies, quenching star formation and explaining thetight smbh-galaxy relations. recent observations of large-scale molecularoutflows in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) have provided theevidence to support these studies, as they directly trace the gas out of whichstars form. theoretical models suggest an origin of these outflows asenergy-conserving flows driven by fast agn accretion disk winds. previousclaims of a connection between large-scale molecular outflows and agn activityin ulirgs were incomplete because they were lacking the detection of theputative inner wind. conversely, studies of powerful agn accretion disk windsto date have focused only on x-ray observations of local seyferts and a fewhigher redshift quasars. here we show the clear detection of a powerful agnaccretion disk wind with a mildly relativistic velocity of 0.25c in the x-rayspectrum of iras f11119+3257, a nearby (z = 0.189) optically classified type 1ulirg hosting a powerful molecular outflow. the agn is responsible for ~80% ofthe emission, with a quasar-like luminosity of l_agn = 1.5x10^46 erg/s. theenergetics of these winds are consistent with the energy-conserving mechanism,which is the basis of the quasar mode feedback in agn lacking powerful radiojets.

1502.07785	exploring the dust content of galactic winds with herschel. i. ngc 4631	we present a detailed analysis of deep far-infrared observations of thenearby edge-on star-forming galaxy ngc 4631 obtained with the herschel spaceobservatory. our pacs images at 70 and 160 um show a rich complex of filamentsand chimney-like features that extends up to a projected distance of 6 kpcabove the plane of the galaxy. the pacs features often match extraplanarhalpha, radio-continuum, and soft x-ray features observed in this galaxy,pointing to a tight disk-halo connection regulated by star formation. on theother hand, the morphology of the colder dust component detected on largerscale in the spire 250, 350, and 500 um data matches the extraplanar h~istreams previously reported in ngc 4631 and suggests a tidal origin. the pacs70/160 ratios are elevated in the central ~3.0 kpc region above the nucleus ofthis galaxy (the "superbubble"). a pixel-by-pixel analysis shows that dust inthis region has a higher temperature and/or an emissivity with a steeperspectral index (beta &gt; 2) than the dust in the disk, possibly the result of theharsher environment in the superbubble. star formation in the disk seemsenergetically insufficient to lift the material out of the disk, unless it wasmore active in the past or the dust-to-gas ratio in the superbubble region ishigher than the galactic value. some of the dust in the halo may also have beentidally stripped from nearby companions or lifted from the disk by galaxyinteractions.

1503.01481	the multi-phase winds of markarian 231: from the hot, nuclear,  ultra-fast wind to the galaxy-scale, molecular outflow	we present the best sensitivity and angular resolution maps of the moleculardisk and outflow of mrk 231, as traced by co observations obtained withiram/pdbi, and we analyze archival chandra and nustar observations. weconstrain the physical properties of both the molecular disk and outflow, thepresence of a highly-ionized ultra-fast nuclear wind, and their connection. themolecular outflow has a size of ~1 kpc, and extends in all directions aroundthe nucleus, being more prominent along the south-west to north-east direction,suggesting a wide-angle biconical geometry. the maximum projected velocity ofthe outflow is nearly constant out to ~1 kpc, thus implying that the density ofthe outflowing material decreases from the nucleus outwards as $r^{-2}$. thissuggests that either a large part of the gas leaves the flow during itsexpansion or that the bulk of the outflow has not yet reached out to ~1 kpc,thus implying a limit on its age of ~1 myr. we find $\dot m_{of}=[ 500-1000]~m_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$ and $\dot e_{kin,of}=[7-10]\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$.remarkably, our analysis of the x-ray data reveals a nuclear ultra-fast outflow(ufo) with velocity -20000 km s$^{-1}$, $\dot m_{ufo}=[0.3- 2.1] ~m_\odotyr^{-1}$, and momentum load $\dot p_{ufo}/\dot p_{rad}=[0.2-1.6]$.we find $\dote_{kin,ufo}\sim \dot e_{kin,of}$ as predicted for outflows undergoing an energyconserving expansion. this suggests that most of the ufo kinetic energy istransferred to mechanical energy of the kpc-scale outflow, strongly supportingthat the energy released during accretion of matter onto super-massive blackholes is the ultimate driver of giant massive outflows. we estimate a momentumboost $\dot p_{of}/\dot p_{ufo}\approx [30-60]$. the ratios $\dot e_{kin,ufo}/l_{bol,agn} =[ 1-5]\%$ and $\dot e_{kin,of}/l_{bol,agn} = [1-3]\%$ agreewith the requirements of the most popular models of agn feedback.

1505.00536	insights on the dusty torus and neutral torus from optical and x-ray  obscuration in a complete volume limited hard x-ray agn sample	we describe a complete volume limited sample of nearby active galaxiesselected by their 14-195kev luminosity, and outline its rationale for studyingthe mechanisms regulating gas inflow and outflow. we describe also acomplementary sample of inactive galaxies, selected to match the agn hostgalaxy properties. the active sample appears to have no bias in terms of agntype, the only difference being the neutral absorbing column which is twoorders of magnitude greater for the seyfert 2s. in the luminosity range spannedby the sample, log l_{14-195kev} [erg/s] = 42.4-43.7, the optically obscuredand x-ray absorbed fractions are 50-65%. the similarity of these fractions tomore distant spectroscopic agn samples, although over a limited luminosityrange, suggests that the torus does not strongly evolve with redshift. oursample confirms that x-ray unabsorbed seyfert 2s are rare, comprising not morethan a few percent of the seyfert 2 population. at higher luminosities, theoptically obscured fraction decreases (as expected for the increasing dustsublimation radius), but the x-ray absorbed fraction changes little. we arguethat the cold x-ray absorption in these seyfert 1s can be accounted for byneutral gas in clouds that also contribute to the broad line region (blr)emission; and suggest that a geometrically thick neutral gas torus co-existswith the blr and bridges the gap to the dusty torus.

1508.07165	a deep herschel/pacs observation of co(40-39) in ngc 1068: a search for  the molecular torus	emission from high-j co lines in galaxies has long been proposed as a tracerof x-ray dominated regions (xdrs) produced by agn. of particular interest isthe question of whether the obscuring torus, which is required by agnunification models, can be observed via high-j co cooling lines. here we reporton the analysis of a deep herschel-pacs observation of an extremely high j cotransition (40-39) in the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068. the line was not detected,with a derived 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $2 \times10^{-17}\,\text{w}\,\text{m}^{-2}$. we apply an xdr model in order toinvestigate whether the upper limit constrains the properties of a moleculartorus in ngc 1068. the xdr model predicts the co spectral line energydistributions for various gas densities and illuminating x-ray fluxes. in ourmodel, the co(40-39) upper limit is matched by gas with densities $\sim10^{6}-10^{7}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$, located at $1.6-5\,\text{pc}$ from the agn,with column densities of at least $10^{25}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$. at such highcolumn densities, however, dust absorbs most of the co(40-39) line emission at$\lambda = 65.69\, \mu$m. therefore, even if ngc 1068 has a molecular toruswhich radiates in the co(40-39) line, the dust can attenuate the line emissionto below the pacs detection limit. the upper limit is thus consistent with theexistence of a molecular torus in ngc 1068. in general, we expect that theco(40-39) is observable in only a few agn nuclei (if at all), because of therequired high gas column density, and absorption by dust.

astro-ph;0010134	biconical outflow in the seyfert galaxy ngc 2992	we report on a detailed kinematic study of the galactic-scale outflow in theseyfert galaxy ngc 2992. the taurus-2 imaging fabry-perot interferometer wasused on the anglo-australian 3.9-m telescope to derive the two-dimensionalvelocity field of the halpha-emitting gas over the central arcminute of ngc2992. the complete two-dimensional coverage of the data combined with simplekinematic models of rotating axisymmetric disks allows us to differentiate theoutflowing material from the line-emitting material associated with thegalactic disk. the kinematics of the disk component out to r = 3.0 kpc are wellmodeled by pure circular rotation. the outflow component is distributed intotwo wide cones with opening angle of 125 -- 135 degrees and extending 2.8 kpc(18") on both sides of the nucleus at nearly right angles to the disk kinematicmajor axis. the outflow on the se side of the nucleus is made of two distinctkinematic components interpreted as the front and back walls of a cone. theazimuthal velocity gradient in the back-wall component reflects residualrotational motion which indicates either that the outflowing material waslifted from the disk or that the underlying galactic disk is contributingslightly to this component. a single outflow component is detected in the nwcone. the most likely energy source for this outflow is a hot bipolar thermalwind powered on sub-kpc scale by the agn and diverted along the galaxy minoraxis by the pressure gradient of the ism in the host galaxy. the data are notconsistent with a starburst-driven wind or a collimated outflow powered byradio jets.

(2000) that the broademission lines indicate interaction between the ejecta and circumstellarmaterial (csm) and deduce that progenitor of sn 1998s appears to have gonethrough at least two phases of mass loss, giving rise to two csm zones.examination of the spectra indicates that the inner zone extended to &lt;90au,while the outer csm extended from 185au to over 1800au. analysis of highresolution spectra shows that the outer csm had a velocity of 40-50 km/s.assuming a constant velocity, we can infer that the outer csm wind commencedmore than 170 years ago, and ceased about 20 years ago, while the inner csmwind may have commenced less than 9 years ago. during the era of the outer csmwind the outflow was high, &gt;2x10^{-5}m_{\odot}/yr corresponding to a mass lossof at least 0.003m_{\odot} and suggesting a massive progenitor. we also modelthe co emission observed in sn 1998s. we deduce a co mass of ~10^{-3} m_{\odot}moving at ~2200km/s, and infer a mixed metal/he core of ~4m_{\odot}, againindicating a massive progenitor.

astro-ph;0510670	dynamical properties of ultraluminous infrared galaxies i: mass ratio  conditions for ulirg activity in interacting pairs	we present first results from our very large telescope large program to studythe dynamical evolution of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs), which arethe products of mergers of gas-rich galaxies. the full data set consists ofhigh resolution, long-slit, h- and k-band spectra of 38 ulirgs and 12 qsos(between 0.042&lt;z&lt;0.268). in this paper, we present the sources that have notfully coalesced, and therefore have two distinct nuclei. this sub-sampleconsists of 21 ulirgs, the nuclear separation of which varies between 1.6 and23.3 kpc. from the co bandheads that appear in our spectra, we extract thestellar velocity dispersion, sigma, and the rotational velocity, v_rot. thestellar dispersion equals 142 km/s on average, while v_rot is often of the sameorder. we combine our spectroscopic results with high-resolution infrared (ir)imaging data to study the conditions for ulirg activity in interacting pairs.we find that the majority of ulirgs are triggered by almost equal-mass majormergers of 1.5:1 average ratio. less frequently, 3:1 encounters are alsoobserved in our sample. however, less violent mergers of mass ratio &gt;3:1typically do not force enough gas into the center to generate ulirgluminosities.

astro-ph;0512055	probing for evolutionary links between local ulirgs and qsos from nir  spectroscopy	we present a study of the dynamical evolution of ultraluminous infraredgalaxies (ulirgs), merging galaxies of infrared luminosity &gt;10^12 l_sun. duringour very large telescope large program, we have obtained isaac near-infrared,high-resolution spectra of 54 ulirgs (at several merger phases) and 12 localpalomar-green qsos to investigate whether ulirgs go through a qso phase duringtheir evolution. one possible evolutionary scenario is that after nuclearcoalescence, the black hole radiates close to eddington to produce qsoluminosities. the mean stellar velocity dispersion that we measure from ourspectra is similar (~160 km/s) for 30 post-coalescence ulirgs and 7 ir-brightqsos. the black holes in both populations have masses of order 10^7-10^8 m_sun(calculated from the relation to the host dispersion) and accrete at rates &gt;0.5eddington. placing ulirgs and ir-bright qsos on the fundamental plane ofearly-type galaxies shows that they are located on a similar region (that ofmoderate-mass ellipticals), in contrast to giant ellipticals and radio-loudqsos. while this preliminary comparison of the ulirg and qso host kinematicalproperties indicates that (some) ulirgs may undergo a qso phase in theirevolutionary history before they settle down as ellipticals, further data onnon-ir excess qsos are necessary to test this scenario.

(2003), have hosts which are larger and moreluminous. the hosts of ulirgs and pg qsos lie close to the locations ofintermediate-size (about 1 -- 2 l*) spheroids in the photometric projection ofthe fundamental plane of ellipticals, although there is a tendency in oursample for the ulirgs with small hosts to be brighter than normal spheroids.excess emission from a young stellar population in the ulirg/qso hosts may beat the origin of this difference. our results provide support for a possiblemerger-driven evolutionary connection between cool ulirgs, warm ulirgs, andpg~qsos although this sequence may break down at low luminosity.

astro-ph;0606158	spitzer quasar and ulirg evolution study (quest): i. the origin of the  far infrared continuum of qsos	this paper addresses the origin of the far-infrared (fir) continuum of qsos,based on the quasar and ulirg evolution study (quest) of nearby qsos and ulirgsusing observations with the spitzer space telescope. for 27 palomar-green qsosat z &lt;~ 0.3, we derive luminosities of diagnostic lines ([neii]12.8um,[nev]14.3um, [oiv]25.9um) and emission features (pah7.7um emission which isrelated to star formation), as well as continuum luminosities over a range ofmid- to far-infrared wavelengths between 6 and 60um. we detect star-formationrelated pah emission in 11/26 qsos and fine-structure line emission in all ofthem, often in multiple lines. the detection of pahs in the average spectrum ofsources which lack individual pah detections provides further evidence for thewidespread presence of pahs in qsos. similar pah/fir and [neii]/fir ratios arefound in qsos and in starburst-dominated ulirgs and lower luminositystarbursts. we conclude that the typical qso in our sample has at least 30% butlikely most of the far-infrared luminosity (~ 10^(10...12)lsun) arising fromstar formation, with a tendency for larger star formation contribution at thelargest fir luminosities. in the qso sample, we find correlations between mostof the quantities studied including combinations of agn tracers and starbursttracers. the common scaling of agn and starburst luminosities (and fluxes) isevidence for a starburst-agn connection in luminous agn. strong correlations offar-infrared continuum and starburst related quantities (pah, low excitation[neii]) offer additional support for the starburst origin of far-infraredemission.

astro-ph;0607468	dynamical properties of ultraluminous infrared galaxies. ii. traces of  dynamical evolution and end products of local ultraluminous mergers	we present results from our very large telescope large program to study thedynamical evolution of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) and qsos.this paper is the second in a series presenting the stellar kinematics of 54ulirgs, derived from high resolution, long-slit h- and k-band spectroscopy. thedata presented here, including observations of 17 new targets, are mainlyfocused on sources that have coalesced into a single nucleus. the stellarkinematics, extracted from the co ro-vibrational bandheads in our spectra,indicate that ulirg remnants are dynamically heated systems with a meandispersion of 161 km/s. the combination of kinematic, structural, andphotometric properties of the remnants indicate that they mostly originate frommajor mergers and that they result in the formation of systems supported byrandom motions, therefore, elliptical galaxies. the peak of the velocitydispersion distribution and the locus of ulirgs on the fundamental plane ofearly-type galaxies indicate that the end products of ultraluminous mergers aretypically moderate-mass ellipticals (of stellar mass ~10^10 - 10^11 m_sun).converting the host dispersion into black hole mass with the aid of them_bh-sigma relation yields black hole mass estimates of the order 10^7 - 10^8m_sun and high accretion rates with eddington efficiencies often &gt;0.5.

astro-ph;0607518	minor merger origin for the circumnuclear starburst in ngc 7742	we present an emission-line diagnostic analysis of integral-fieldspectroscopic observations that cover the central kiloparsec of ngc 7742. thissa galaxy hosts a spectacular nuclear starburst ring and nuclear regionscharacterized by low-ionization emission. the gas in the ring rotates in theopposite sense to the stars in the galaxy, suggesting a recent merging oracquisition event. the combination of integral-field measurements for theh-alpha + [nii] emission lines from densepak and the h-beta and [oiii] emissionfrom sauron allow the construction of diagnostic diagrams that highlight thetransition from star formation in the nuclear ring to excitation byhigh-velocity shocks or by a central agn towards the center. densepakmeasurements for the [sii] line ratio reveal very low gas densities in thenuclear ring, ne &lt; 100 per cm^3, characteristic of massive hii regions.comparison with mappings iii models for starbursts with low gas densities showthat the ring is of roughly solar metallicity. this suggests that the gas inthe nuclear ring originated in a stellar system capable of substantiallyenriching the gas metallicity through sustained star formation. we suggest thatngc 7742 cannibalised a smaller galaxy rich in metal-poor gas, and that starformation episodes in the ring have since increased the metallicity to itspresent value.

astro-ph;0610719	host dynamics and origin of palomar-green qsos	we present host-galaxy velocity dispersions of 12 local (mainlypalomar-green) quasi-stellar objects (qsos) measured directly from the stellarco absorption features in the h band. the mean bulge velocity dispersion of theqsos in our sample is 186 km/s with a standard deviation of 24 km/s. themeasurement of the stellar velocity dispersion in qsos enables us to place themon observational diagrams such as the local black-hole mass tobulge-velocity-dispersion relation and the fundamental plane of early-typegalaxies. concerning the former relation, these qsos have higher black holemasses than most seyfert 1 agns with similar velocity dispersions. on thefundamental plane, pg qsos are located between the regions occupied bymoderate-mass and giant ellipticals. the qso bulge and black hole masses,computed from the stellar velocity dispersions, are of order 10^11 m_sun and10^8 m_sun respectively. the eddington efficiency of their black holes is onaverage 0.25, assuming that all of the bolometric luminosity originates fromthe active nucleus. our data are consistent with other lines of evidence thatpalomar-green qsos are related to galaxy mergers with gas-rich components andthat they are formed in a manner similar to the most massive ultraluminousinfrared galaxies, regardless of their far-infrared emission. however, pg qsosseem to have smaller host dispersions and different formation mechanisms thanqsos with supermassive black holes of 5x10^8-10^9 m_sun that accrete at lowrates and reside in massive spheroids.

astro-ph;0610772	mid-infrared diagnostics of liners	we report results from the first mid-infrared spectroscopic study of acomprehensive sample of 33 liners, observed with the spitzer space telescope.we compare the properties of two different liner populations: infrared-faintliners, with liner emission arising mostly in compact nuclear regions, andinfrared-luminous liners, which often show spatially extended (non-agn) lineremission. we show that these two populations can be easily distinguished bytheir mid-infrared spectra in three different ways: (i) their mid-ir spectralenergy distributions (seds), (ii) the emission features of polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pahs), and (iii) various combinations of ir fine-structure lineratios. ir-luminous liners show mid-ir seds typical of starburst galaxies,while the mid-ir seds of ir-faint liners are much bluer. pah flux ratios aresignificantly different in the two groups. fine structure emission lines fromhighly excited gas, such as [o iv], are detected in both populations,suggesting the presence of an additional agn also in a large fraction ofir-bright liners, which contributes little to the combined mid-ir light. thetwo liner groups occupy different regions of mid-infrared emission-lineexcitation diagrams. the positions of the various liner types in our diagnosticdiagrams provide important clues regarding the power source of each liner type.most of these mid-infrared diagnostics can be applied at low spectralresolution, making agn- and starburst-excited liners distinguishable also athigh redshifts.

astro-ph;0701239	the environment of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies	the spatial cluster-galaxy correlation amplitude, bgc, is computed for a setof 76 (z &lt; 0.3) ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) from the 1-jy sample.the bgc parameter is used to quantify the richness of the environment within0.5 mpc of each ulirg. we find that the environment of local ulirgs is similarto that of the field with the possible exceptions of a few objects withenvironmental densities typical of clusters with abell richness classes 0 and1. no obvious trends are seen with redshift, optical spectral type, infraredluminosity, or infrared color. we compare these results with those of localagns and qsos at various redshifts. the 1-jy ulirgs show a broader range ofenvironments than local seyferts, which are exclusively found in the field. thedistribution of ulirg bgc-values overlaps considerably with that of local qsos,consistent with the scenario where some qsos go through a ultraluminousinfrared phase. however, a rigorous statistical analysis of the data indicatesthat these two samples are not drawn from the same parent population. the bgcdistribution of qsos shows a distinct tail at high bgc-values which is notapparent among the ulirgs. this difference is consistent with the fact thatsome of the qsos used for this comparison have bigger and more luminous hoststhan the 1-jy ulirgs.

astro-ph;9703040	artillery shells over circinus	the recently identified circinus galaxy is the nearest (about 4 mpc) seyfert2 galaxy known and we now demonstrate to be one of the best laboratories forstudying the effects of nuclear activity on the surrounding environment. herewe present new imaging fabry-perot observations of circinus which confirm theexistence of an ionization cone in this object but also show for the first timea complex of ionized filaments extending radially from the nucleus out todistances of 1 kpc. arcs suggestive of bow shocks are observed at the terminusof some of these filamentary structures. most spectacular of all, one of thestructures appears to be a scaled-up version of a herbig-haro jet. the velocityfield of the filaments confirms that they represent material expelled from thenucleus (possibly in the form of `bullets') or entrained in a wide-angle windroughly aligned with the polar axis of the galaxy. the motions observed acrossthe ionization cone are highly supersonic, so high-velocity shocks are likelyto contribute to the ionization of the line emitting gas. however, it is notclear at present whether shock ionization dominates over photoionization by theseyfert 2 nucleus. extrapolation of the filaments to smaller radii comes towithin 1 arcsec (about 20 pc) of the infrared nucleus, therefore suggesting aagn or nuclear starburst origin to these features. the complex of radialfilaments detected in the circinus galaxy is unique among active galaxies. thefrequency of such events is unknown since only a handful of galaxies have beenobserved at the sensitivity level of our present observations. the event in thecircinus galaxy may represent a relatively common evolutionary phase in thelives of gas-rich active galaxies during which the dusty cocoon surrounding thenucleus is expelled by the action of jet or wind phenomena.

astro-ph;9802220	the smith cloud: hi associated with the sgr dwarf?	the smith high velocity cloud (v(lsr) = 98 kms) has been observed at twolocations in the emission lines [oiii]5007, [nii]6548 and h-alpha. both the[nii] and h-alpha profiles show bright cores due to the reynolds layer, and redwings with emission extending to v(lsr) = 130 kms. this is the firstsimultaneous detection of two emission lines towards a high velocity cloud,allowing us to form the ratio of these line profiles as a function of lsrvelocity. at both cloud positions, we see a clear distinction between emissionat the cloud velocity, and the reynolds layer emission (v(lsr) = 0). the[nii]/h-alpha ratio (=0.25) for the reynolds layer is typical of the warmionised medium. at the cloud velocity, this ratio is enhanced by a factor of3-4 compared to emission at rest with respect to the lsr. a moderately deepupper limit at [oiii] (0.12r at 3-sigma) was derived from our data. if theemission arises from dilute photoionisation from hot young stars, the highlyenhanced [nii]/h-alpha ratio, the [oiii] non-detection and weak h-alphaemission (0.24-0.30r) suggest that the smith cloud is 26+/-4 kpc from the sun,at a galactocentric radius of 20+/-4 kpc. this value assumes that the emissionarises from an optically thick slab, with a covering fraction of unity as seenby the ionizing photons, whose orientation is either (a) parallel to thegalactic disk, or (b) such as to maximize the received flux from the disk. theestimated mass and size of the cloud are 4x10^6 msun and 6 kpc. we discuss apossible association with the much larger sgr dwarf, at a galactocentric radiusof 16+/-2 kpc, which lies within 35 degrees (~12 kpc) of the smith cloud.

(1995) to determine thespectral properties of luminous infrared galaxies (ligs) with l_ir ~=10^{10.5}-10^{13} l_sun. we find that the fraction of seyfert galaxies amongligs increases dramatically above l_ir ~= 10^{12.3} l_sun --- nearly half ofthe galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10^{12.3} l_sun present seyfert characteristics. manyof the optical properties of these seyfert galaxies are consistent with thepresence of a genuine active galactic nucleus (agn) in the core of theseobjects.  the continuum colors and strengths of the stellar h-beta and mgib features inand out of the nuclei of uligs indicate that star formation has recently (~10^7yr) taken place in the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of many of theseobjects. as expected, photoionization by hot stars appears to be the dominantsource of ionization in the objects with h ii region-like spectra. evidence ispresented that the ionization source in infrared-selected galaxies with nuclearliner-like spectra (38% of the uligs in our sample) is likely to be shocks orof stellar origins rather than an agn. shock ionization associated withstarburst-driven outflows may also explain the liner-like emission detectedoutside the nuclei of some galaxies.

astro-ph;9903152	mid-infrared and optical spectroscopy of ultraluminous infrared  galaxies: a comparison	new tools from infrared space observatory (iso) mid-infrared spectroscopyhave recently become available to determine the power sources of dust-obscuredultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs). we compare iso classifications -starburst or active galactic nucleus (agn) - with classifications from opticalspectroscopy, and with optical/near-infrared searches for hidden broad-lineregions. the agreement between mid-infrared and optical classification isexcellent if optical liner spectra are assigned to the starburst group. thestarburst nature of ulirg liners strongly supports the suggestion that linerspectra in infrared-selected galaxies, rather than being an expression of theagn phenomenon, are due to shocks that are probably related to galacticsuperwinds. differences between iso and optical classification provide clues onthe evolution of ulirgs and on the configuration of obscuring dust. we find fewiso agn with optical hii or liner identification, suggesting that highlyobscured agn exist but are not typical for the ulirg phenomenon in general.rather, our results indicate that strong agn activity, once triggered, quicklybreaks the obscuring screen at least in certain directions, thus becomingdetectable over a wide wavelength range.
