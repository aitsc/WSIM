0901.3341	searching for massive galaxies at z&gt;=3.5 in goods-north	we constrain the space density and properties of massive galaxy candidates atredshifts of z&gt;=3.5 in the goods-n field. by selecting sources in thespitzer+irac bands, a highly stellar mass-complete sample isassembled,including massive galaxies which are very faint in theoptical/near-ir bands that would be missed by samples selected at shorterwavelengths. the z&gt;=3.5 sample was selected down to 23 mag at 4.5 micron usingphotometric redshifts that have been obtained by fitting the galaxies seds atoptical, near-ir and irac bands. we also require that the brightest band inwhich candidates are detected is the irac 8 micron band in order to ensure thatthe near-ir 1.6 micron (rest-frame) peak is falling in or beyond this band. wefound 53 z&gt;=3.5 candidates, with masses in the range of m~10^10-10^11m_sun. atleast ~81% of these galaxies are missed by traditional lyman break selectionmethods based on uv light. spitzer+mips emission is detected for 60% of thesample of z&gt;=3.5 galaxy candidates. although in some cases this might suggest aresidual contamination from lower redshift star-forming galaxies or agn, 37% ofthese objects are also detected in the sub-mm/mm bands in recent scuba,aztecand mambo surveys, and have properties fully consistent with vigorous starburstgalaxies at z&gt;=3.5. the comoving number density of galaxies with stellar masses&gt;= 5x10^10m_sun(a reasonable stellar mass completeness limit for our sample) is2.6x10^-5mpc^-3 (using the volume within 3.5&lt;z&lt;5), and the correspondingstellar mass density is ~2.9x10^6m_sunmpc^-3, or~3% of the local density abovethe same stellar mass limit.for the sub-sample of mips-undetected galaxies,wefind a number density of ~0.97x10^-5mpc^-3 and a stellar mass density of~1.15x10^6m_sun mpc^-3.[abridged]

0903.3972	gmass ultradeep spectroscopy of galaxies at z ~ 2. iv. the variety of  dust populations	the properties of dust attenuation at rest-frame uv wavelengths are inferredfrom very high-quality fors2 spectra of 78 galaxies from the gmass survey at1&lt;z&lt;2.5. these objects complement a previously investigated sample of 108uv-luminous galaxies at similar redshifts, selected from the fdf spectroscopicsurvey, the k20 survey, and the gdds. the shape of the uv extinction curve isconstrained by a parametric description of the rest-frame uv continuum. the uvbump is further characterised by fitting lorentzian-like profiles. spectraexhibit a significant 2175a feature in at least 30% of the cases. ifattenuation is dominated by dust ejected from the galaxy main body viasuperwinds, uv extinction curves in-between those of the smc and lmccharacterise the sample galaxies. the fraction of galaxies with extinctioncurves differing from the smc one increases, if more dust resides in thegalactic plane or dust attenuation depends on stellar age. on average, thewidth of the manifested uv bumps is about 60% of the values typical of the lmcand milky way. this suggests the presence of dust similar to that found in thelmc2 supershell close to 30dor. the presence of the carriers of the uv bump at1&lt;z&lt;2.5 argues for outflows from agb stars being copious then. consistent withtheir higher sfrs, the gmass galaxies with a manifested uv bump are moreluminous at rest-frame 8mum, where the emission is dominated by pahs (alsoproducts of agb stars). in addition, they exhibit stronger uv absorptionfeatures, mostly of interstellar origin, which indicates overall more evolvedstellar populations. we conclude that diversification of the small-size dustcomponent has already started in the most evolved star-forming systems at1&lt;z&lt;2.5.

0909.4303	deep spitzer 24mic cosmos imaging -- i. the evolution of luminous dusty  galaxies - confronting the models	we present the first results obtained from the identification of ~30,000sources in the 24mic observations of the cosmos field at s24&gt;~80mujy. usingaccurate photo-z's and extrapolations of the counts at faint fluxes we resolvewith unprecedented detail the build-up of the mid-ir background across cosmicages. we find that ~50% and ~80% of the 24mic background intensity originatefrom galaxies at z&lt;~1 and z&lt;~2 respectively, supporting the scenario wherehighly obscured sources at very high redshifts (z&gt;~2) contribute onlymarginally to the cib. assuming flux-limited selections at optical wavelengths,we also find that the fraction of i-band sources with 24mic detection stronglyincreases up to z~2 as a consequence of the rapid evolution that star-forminggalaxies have undergone with lookback time. nonetheless this rising trend showsa clear break at z~1.3, probably due to k-correction effects implied by thecomplexity of seds in the mid-ir. finally, we compare our results with thepredictions from different models of galaxy formation. we note thatsemi-analytical formalisms fail to reproduce the redshift distributionsobserved at 24mic. furthermore the simulated galaxies exhibit r-k colors muchbluer than observed and the predicted k-band fluxes are systematicallyunderestimated at z&gt;0.5. unless these discrepancies result from an incorrecttreatment of extinction they may reflect an underestimate of the predicteddensity of high-z massive sources with strong star formation, which would pointto more fundamental processes that are still not fully controlled in thesimulations. the most recent backward evolution scenarios reproduce reasonablywell the flux/redshift distribution of 24mic sources up to z~3, although noneof them is able to exactly match our results at all redshifts.

0910.5649	mid- and far-infrared luminosity functions and galaxy evolution from  multiwavelength spitzer observations up to z~2.5	[abridged]we exploit a large homogeneous dataset to derive a self-consistentpicture of ir emission based on the time-dependent 24, 15, 12 and 8micronmonochromatic and bolometric ir luminosity functions (lf) over the 0&lt;z&lt;2.5redshift range. our analysis is based on the combination of data from deepspitzer surveys in the vvds-swire and goods areas. to our limiting flux ofs(24)=400microjy our derived sample in vvds-swire includes 1494 sources, and666 and 904 sources brighter than s(24)=80microjy are catalogued in goods-s andgoods-n, respectively, for a total area of ~0.9 square degs. we obtain reliableoptical identifications and redshifts, providing us a rich and robust datasetfor our luminosity function determination. based on the multi-wavelengthinformation available, we constrain the lfs at 8, 12, 15 and 24micron. we alsoextrapolate total ir luminosities from our best-fit to the observed seds ofeach source, and use this to derive the bolometric lf and comoving volumeemissivity up to z~2.5. in the 0&lt;z&lt;1 interval, the bolometric ir luminositydensity evolves as (1+z)^3.8+/-0.4. although more uncertain at higher-z, ourresults show a flattening of the ir luminosity density at z&gt;1. the meanredshift of the peak in the source number density shifts with luminosity: thebrighest ir galaxies appear to be forming stars earlier in cosmic time (z&gt;1.5),while the less luminous ones keep doing it at more recent epochs (z~1 forl(ir)&lt;10^11l_sun). our results suggest a rapid increase of the galaxy ircomoving volume emissivity back to z~1 and a constant average emissivity atz&gt;1. we also seem to find a difference in the evolution rate of the sourcenumber densities as a function of luminosity, a downsizing evolutionary patternsimilar to that reported from other samples of cosmic sources.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1074	herschel pep: the star-formation rates of 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 massive galaxies	the star formation rate (sfr) is a key parameter in the study of galaxyevolution. the accuracy of sfr measurements at z~2 has been questionedfollowing a disagreement between observations and theoretical models. thelatter predict sfrs at this redshift that are typically a factor 4 or morelower than the measurements. we present star-formation rates based oncalorimetric measurements of the far-infrared (fir) luminosities for massive1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, normal star-forming galaxies (sfgs), which do not depend onextinction corrections and/or extrapolations of spectral energy distributions.the measurements are based on observations in goods-n with the photodetectorarray camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs) onboard herschel, as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) project, that resolve for the first time individualsfgs at these redshifts at fir wavelengths. we compare fir-based sfrs to themore commonly used 24 micron and uv sfrs. we find that sfrs from 24 micronalone are higher by a factor of ~4-7.5 than the true sfrs. this overestimationdepends on luminosity: gradually increasing for log l(24um)&gt;12.2 l_sun. thesfgs and agns tend to exhibit the same 24 micron excess. the uv sfrs are incloser agreement with the fir-based sfrs. using a calzetti uv extinctioncorrection results in a mean excess of up to 0.3 dex and a scatter of 0.35 dexfrom the fir sfrs. the previous uv sfrs are thus confirmed and the mean excess,while narrowing the gap, is insufficient to explain the discrepancy between theobserved sfrs and simulation predictions.

1005.1089	the first herschel view of the mass-sfr link in high-z galaxies	we exploit deep observations of the goods-n field taken with pacs, on boardof herschel, as part of the pep guaranteed time, to study the link between starformation and stellar mass in galaxies to z~2. starting from a stellarmass-selected sample of ~4500 galaxies with mag[4.5mu]&lt;23 (ab), we identify~350 objects with a pacs detection at 100 or 160mu and ~1500 with only spitzer24 mu counterpart. stellar masses and total ir luminosities (lir) are estimatedby fitting the seds. consistently with other herschel results, we find that lirbased only on 24 mu data is overestimated by a median factor ~1.8 at z~2,whereas it is underestimated (with our approach) up to a factor ~1.6 at0.5&lt;z&lt;1.0. we then exploit this calibration to correct lir based on the mipsfluxes. these results clearly show how herschel is fundamental to constrainlir, and hence the sfr, of high redshift galaxies. using the galaxies detectedwith pacs (and/or mips), we investigate the existence and evolution of therelations between the star formation rate (sfr), the specific star formationrate (ssfr=sfr/mass) and the stellar mass. moreover, in order to avoidselection effects, we also repeat this study through a stacking analysis on thepacs images to fully exploit the far-ir information also for the herschel andspitzer undetected subsamples. we find that the ssfr-mass relation steepenswith redshift, being almost flat at z&lt;1.0 and reaching a slope ofalpha=-0.50^(+0.13)_(-0.16) at z~2, at odds with recent works based onradio-stacking analysis at the same redshift. the mean ssfr of galaxiesincreases with redshift, by a factor ~15 for massive m&gt;10^(11) (m_sun) galaxiesfrom z=0 to z=2, and seems to flatten at z&gt;1.5 in this mass range. moreover,the most massive galaxies have the lowest ssfr at any z, implying that theyhave formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low masscounterparts.

1005.1154	far-infrared properties of submillimeter and optically faint radio  galaxies	we use deep observations obtained with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) onboard the herschel space observatory to study thefar-infrared (fir) properties of submm and optically faint radio galaxies (smgsand ofrgs). from literature we compiled a sample of 35 securely identified smgsand nine ofrgs located in the goods-n and the a2218 fields. this sample iscross-matched with our pacs 100 um and 160 um multi-wavelength catalogs. abouthalf of the galaxies in our sample are detected with pacs. the dusttemperatures and the infrared luminosities of our galaxies are derived byfitting their pacs and scuba 850 um (only the upper limits for the ofrgs) fluxdensities with a single modified (beta=1.5) black body function. the mediandust temperature of our smg sample is t=36+/-8k while for our ofrg sample it ist=47+/-3k. for both samples, median dust temperatures derived from herscheldata agree well with previous estimates. in particular, chapman et al. (2005)found a dust temperature of t=36+/-7k for a large sample of smgs assuming thevalidity of the fir/radio correlation. the agreement between our studiesconfirms that the local fir/radio correlation effectively holds at highredshift even though we find &lt;q&gt;=2.17+/-0.19, a slightly lower value than thatobserved in local systems. the median ir luminosities of smgs and ofrgs are4.6*10^12 lsun and 2.6*10^12 lsun, respectively. we note that for both samplesthe ir luminosity estimates from the radio part of the spectral energydistribution are accurate, while estimates from the mid-ir are considerably(x3) more uncertain. our observations confirm the remarkably high luminositiesof smgs and thus imply median star-formation rates of 960msun yr^-1 for smgswith s(850um)&gt;5mjy and 460msun yr^-1 for smgs with s(850um)&gt;2mjy, assuming achabrier imf and no dominant agn contribution to the far-infrared luminosity.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.3018	a search for debris disks in the herschel atlas	aims: we aim to demonstrate that the herschel atlas (h-atlas) is suitable fora blind and unbiased survey for debris disks by identifying candidate debrisdisks associated with main sequence stars in the initial science demonstrationfield of the survey. we show that h-atlas reveals a population offar-infrared/sub-mm sources that are associated with stars or star-like objectson the sdss main-sequence locus. we validate our approach by comparing theproperties of the most likely candidate disks to those of the known population.methods: we use a photometric selection technique to identify main sequencestars in the sdss dr7 catalogue and a bayesian likelihood ratio method toidentify h-atlas catalogue sources associated with these main sequence stars.following this photometric selection we apply distance cuts to identify themost likely candidate debris disks and rule out the presence of contaminatinggalaxies using ukidss las k-band images. results: we identify 78 h-atlassources associated with sdss point sources on the main-sequence locus, of whichtwo are the most likely debris disk candidates: h-atlas j090315.8 and h-atlasj090240.2. we show that they are plausible candidates by comparing theirproperties to the known population of debris disks. our initial resultsindicate that bright debris disks are rare, with only 2 candidates identifiedin a search sample of 851 stars. we also show that h-atlas can derive usefulupper limits for debris disks associated with hipparcos stars in the field andoutline the future prospects for our debris disk search programme.

1005.3820	the herschel lensing survey (hls): overview	the herschel lensing survey (hls) will conduct deep pacs and spire imaging of~40 massive clusters of galaxies. the strong gravitational lensing power ofthese clusters will enable us to penetrate through the confusion noise, whichsets the ultimate limit on our ability to probe the universe with herschel.here, we present an overview of our survey and a summary of the major resultsfrom our science demonstration phase (sdp) observations of the bullet cluster(z=0.297). the sdp data are rich, allowing us to study not only the backgroundhigh-redshift galaxies (e.g., strongly lensed and distorted galaxies at z=2.8and 3.2) but also the properties of cluster-member galaxies. our preliminaryanalysis shows a great diversity of far-infrared/submillimeter spectral energydistributions (seds), indicating that we have much to learn with herschel aboutthe properties of galaxy seds. we have also detected the sunyaev-zel'dovich(sz) effect increment with the spire data. the success of this sdp programdemonstrates the great potential of the herschel lensing survey to produceexciting results in a variety of science areas.

1005.3823	improving the identification of high-z herschel sources with position  priors and optical/nir and fir/mm photometric redshifts	we present preliminary results about the detection of high redshift (u)lirgsin the bullet cluster field by the pacs and spire instruments within theherschel lensing survey (hls) program. we describe in detail a photometricprocedure designed to recover robust fluxes and deblend faint herschel sourcesnear the confusion noise. the method is based on the use of the positions ofspitzer/mips 24 um sources as priors. our catalogs are able to reliably (5sigma) recover galaxies with fluxes above 6 and 10 mjy in the pacs 100 and 160um channels, respectively, and 12 to 18 mjy in the spire bands. we also obtainspectral energy distributions covering the optical through thefar-infrared/millimeter spectral ranges of all the herschel detected sources,and analyze them to obtain independent estimations of the photometric redshiftbased on either stellar population or dust emission models. we exemplify thepotential of the combined use of spitzer position priors plus independentoptical and ir photometric redshifts to robustly assign optical/nircounterparts to the sources detected by herschel and other (sub-)mminstruments.

1005.3824	first detection of the sunyaev zel'dovich effect increment at lambda &lt;  650 um	the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect is a spectral distortion of the cosmicmicrowave background as observed through the hot plasma in galaxy clusters.this distortion is a decrement in the cmb intensity for lambda &gt; 1.3 mm, anincrement at shorter wavelengths, and small again by lambda ~250 um. as part ofthe herschel lensing survey (hls) we have mapped 1e0657-56 (the bullet cluster)with spire with bands centered at 250, 350 and 500 um and have detected the szeffect at the two longest wavelengths. the measured sz effect increment centralintensities are delta i_{0} = 0.097 +- 0.019 mjy sr^{-1} at 350 um and deltai_{0} = 0.268 +- 0.031 mjy sr^{-1} at 500 um, consistent with the sz effectspectrum derived from previous measurements at 2 mm. no other diffuse emissionis detected. the presence of the finite temperature sz effect correction ispreferred by the spire data at a significance of 2.1 sigma, opening thepossibility that the relativistic sz effect correction can be constrained byspire in a sample of clusters. the results presented here have importantramifications for both sub-mm measurements of galaxy clusters and blank fieldsurveys with spire.

1005.5678	the dust content of high-z submillimeter galaxies revealed by herschel	we use deep observations taken with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs), on board the herschel satellite as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) guaranteed project along with submm ground-basedobservations to measure the dust mass of a sample of high-z submillimetergalaxies (smgs). we investigate their dust content relative to their stellarand gas masses, and compare them with local star-forming galaxies. high-z smgsare dust rich, i.e. they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared tolocal spiral galaxies (by a factor of 30) and also compared to localultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, by a factor of 6). this indicates thatthe large masses of gas typically hosted in smgs have already been highlyenriched with metals and dust. indeed, for those smgs whose gas mass ismeasured, we infer dust-to-gas ratios similar or higher than local spirals andulirgs. however, similarly to other strongly star-forming galaxies in the localuniverse and at high-z, smgs are characterized by gas metalicities lower (by afactor of a few) than local spirals, as inferred from their optical nebularlines, which are generally ascribed to infall of metal-poor gas. this is incontrast with the large dust content inferred from the far-ir and submm data.in short, the metalicity inferred from the dust mass is much higher (by morethan an order of magnitude) than that inferred from the optical nebular lines.we discuss the possible explanations of this discrepancy and the possibleimplications for the investigation of the metalicity evolution at high-z.

1007.1902	unveiling far-infrared counterparts of bright submillimeter galaxies  using pacs imaging	we present a search for herschel-pacs counterparts of dust-obscured,high-redshift objects previously selected at submillimeter and millimeterwavelengths in the great observatories origins deep survey north field. wedetect 22 of 56 submillimeter galaxies (39%) with a snr of &gt;=3 at 100 microndown to 3.0 mjy, and/or at 160 micron down to 5.7 mjy. the fraction of smgsseen at 160 micron is higher than that at 100 micron. about 50% ofradio-identified smgs are associated with pacs sources. we find a trend betweenthe scuba/pacs flux ratio and redshift, suggesting that these flux ratios couldbe used as a coarse redshift indicator. pacs undetected submm/mm selectedsources tend to lie at higher redshifts than the pacs detected ones. a total of12 sources (21% of our smg sample) remain unidentified and the fact that theyare blank fields at herschel-pacs and vla 20 cm wavelength may imply higherredshifts for them than for the average smg population (e.g., z&gt;3-4). theherschel-pacs imaging of these dust-obscured starbursts at high-redshiftssuggests that their far-infrared spectral energy distributions havesignificantly different shapes than template libraries of local infraredgalaxies.

1009.3001	herschel-spire, far-infrared properties of millimetre-bright and -faint  radio galaxies	(abridged) we present the first study of the farir properties of highredshift, radio-selected ulirgs using deep observations obtained with spirefrom the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes). these galaxiesspan a large range of 850um fluxes from submillimetre-luminous ~10mjy "scubagalaxies -- smgs" to ~1.5mjy from stacked scuba non-detections, thus likelyrepresenting a complete distribution of ulirg spectral energy distributions.from keck spectroscopic surveys in the lockman-north field we identified asample of 31 smgs and 37 submillimetre-faint, optically-faint radio galaxies(ofrgs), all with radio-inferred ir luminosities &gt;10^12 lsun. these galaxieswere cross-identified with spire 250, 350 and 500um catalogs based on fluxesextracted at 24um positions in the swire survey, yielding a sample of more thanhalf of the galaxies well detected in at least two of the spire bandpasses. byfitting greybody dust models to the spire photometry together with scuba 850ummeasurements, we infer dust temperatures and far-infrared luminosities. theofrgs detected by spire have median &lt;t_d&gt;= 41+-5 k and the smgs have &lt;t_d&gt;=34+-5 k, both in reasonable agreement with previous (pre-herschel) estimates,reaffirming that the local fir/radio correlation holds (at least for thissubset of high-z ulirgs) at high redshift. our observations firstly confirmthat a substantial fraction of ofrgs exhibit large infrared luminositiescorresponding to sfrs of ~400 msun/yr. the spire observations secondly confirmthe higher dust temperatures for these ofrgs than similarly selected smgs,consistent with early predictions of the submm-faint radio populations. ourobservations also clearly confirm the large infrared luminosities of most smgsselected with s850um&gt;5 mjy and radio and strong 24um detections, correspondingto sfrs of ~700 msun/yr.

1012.5186	herschel-atlas: rapid evolution of dust in galaxies in the last 5  billion years	we present the first direct and unbiased measurement of the evolution of thedust mass function of galaxies over the past 5 billion years of cosmic historyusing data from the science demonstration phase of the herschel-atlas. thesample consists of galaxies selected at 250{\mu}m which have reliablecounterparts from sdss at z &lt; 0.5, and contains 1867 sources. dust masses arecalculated using both a single temperature grey-body model for the spectralenergy distribution and also using a model with multiple temperaturecomponents. the dust temperature for either model shows no trend with redshift.splitting the sample into bins of redshift reveals a strong evolution in thedust properties of the most massive galaxies. at z = 0.4 - 0.5, massivegalaxies had dust masses about five times larger than in the local universe. atthe same time, the dust-to-stellar mass ratio was about 3-4 times larger, andthe optical depth derived from fitting the uv-sub-mm data with an energybalance model was also higher. this increase in the dust content of massivegalaxies at high redshift is difficult to explain using standard dust evolutionmodels and requires a rapid gas consumption timescale together with either amore top-heavy imf, efficient mantle growth, less dust destruction orcombinations of all three. this evolution in dust mass is likely to beassociated with a change in overall ism mass, and points to an enhanced supplyof fuel for star formation at earlier cosmic epochs.

1101.4796	hermes: detection of cosmic magnification of sub-mm galaxies using  angular cross-correlation	cosmic magnification is due to the weak gravitational lensing of sources inthe distant universe by foreground large-scale structure leading to coherentchanges in the observed number density of the background sources. depending onthe slope of the background source number counts, cosmic magnification causes acorrelation between the background and foreground galaxies, which is unexpectedin the absence of lensing if the two populations are spatially disjoint.previous attempts using submillimetre (sub-mm) sources have been hampered bysmall number statistics. the large number of sources detected in the {\itherschel} multi-tiered extra-galactic survey (hermes) lockman-swire fieldenables us to carry out the first robust study of the cross-correlation betweensub-mm sources and sources at lower redshifts. using ancillary data we compiletwo low-redshift samples from sdss and swire with &lt;z&gt; ~ 0.2 and 0.4,respectively, and cross-correlate with two sub-mm samples based on flux densityand colour criteria, selecting galaxies preferentially at z ~ 2. we detectcross-correlation on angular scales between ~1 and 50 arcmin and find clearevidence that this is primarily due to cosmic magnification. a small, butnon-negligible signal from intrinsic clustering is likely to be present due tothe tails of the redshift distribution of the sub-mm sources overlapping withthose of the foreground samples.

1103.3080	gama/h-atlas: the ultraviolet spectral slope and obscuration in galaxies	we use multiwavelength data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) andherschel atlas (h-atlas) surveys to compare the relationship between variousdust obscuration measures in galaxies. we explore the connections between theultraviolet (uv) spectral slope, $\beta$, the balmer decrement, and the farinfrared (ir) to $150\,$nm far ultraviolet (fuv) luminosity ratio. we exploretrends with galaxy mass, star formation rate (sfr) and redshift in order toidentify possible systematics in these various measures. we reiterate thefinding of other authors that there is a large scatter between the balmerdecrement and the $\beta$ parameter, and that $\beta$ may be poorly constrainedwhen derived from only two broad passbands in the uv. we also emphasise thatfuv derived sfrs, corrected for dust obscuration using $\beta$, will beoverestimated unless a modified relation between $\beta$ and the attenuationfactor is used. even in the optimum case, the resulting sfrs have a significantscatter, well over an order of magnitude. while there is a stronger correlationbetween the ir to fuv luminosity ratio and $\beta$ parameter than with thebalmer decrement, neither of these correlations are particularly tight, anddust corrections based on $\beta$ for high redshift galaxy sfrs must be treatedwith caution. we conclude with a description of the extent to which thedifferent obscuration measures are consistent with each other as well as theeffects of including other galactic properties on these correlations.

1103.3905	herschel-atlas: the link between accretion luminosity and star formation  in quasar host galaxies	we use the science demonstration field data of the herschel-atlas to studyhow star formation, traced by the far-infrared herschel data, is related toboth the accretion luminosity and redshift of quasars selected from the sloandigital sky survey and the 2slaq survey. by developing a maximum likelihoodestimator to investigate the presence of correlations between the far-infraredand optical luminosities we find evidence that the star-formation in quasarhosts is correlated with both redshift and quasar accretion luminosity.assuming a relationship of the form l_ir \propto l_qso^{\theta} (1 +z)^{\zeta}, we find {\theta} = 0.22 +/- 0.08 and {\zeta} = 1.6 +/- 0.4,although there is substantial additional uncertainty in {\zeta} of order +/- 1,due to uncertainties in the host galaxy dust temperature. we find evidence fora large intrinsic dispersion in the redshift dependence, but no evidence forintrinsic dispersion in the correlation between l_qso and l_ir, suggesting thatthe latter may be due to a direct physical connection between star formationand black hole accretion. this is consistent with the idea that both the quasaractivity and star formation are dependent on the same reservoir of cold gas, sothat they are both affected by the influx of cold gas during mergers or heatingof gas via feedback processes.

1104.1094	the effect of environment on star forming galaxies at redshift 1 - first  insight from pacs	we use deep 70, 100 and 160 um observations taken with pacs, thephotodetector array camera and spectrometer on board of herschel, as part ofthe pacs evolutionary probe (pep) guaranteed time, to study the relationbetween star formation rate and environment at redshift ~ 1 in the goods-s andgoods-n fields. we use the sdss spectroscopic catalog to build the local analogand study the evolution of the star formation activity dependence on theenvironment. at z ~ 1 we observe a reversal of the relation between starformation rate and local density, confirming the results based on spitzer 24 umdata. however, due to the high accuracy provided by pacs in measuring the starformation rate also for agn hosts, we identify in this class of objects thecause for the reversal of the density-sfr relation. indeed, agn hosts favorhigh stellar masses, dense regions and high star formation rates. without theagn contribution the relation flattens consistently with respect to the localanalog in the same range of star formation rates. as in the local universe, thespecific star formation rate anti-correlates with the density. this is due tomass segregation both at high and low redshift. the contribution of agn hostsdoes not affect this anti-correlation, since agn hosts exhibit the samespecific star formation rate as star forming galaxies at the same mass. thesame global trends and agn contribution is observed once the relations arestudied per morphological type. we study the specific star formation rate vsstellar mass relation in three density regimes. our data provides an indicationthat at m/m_{\odot} &gt; 10^{11} the mean specific star formation rate tends to behigher at higher density, while the opposite trend is observed in the localsdss star forming sample.

1104.4115	redshift determination and co line excitation modeling for the  multiply-lensed galaxy hlsw-01	we report on the redshift measurement and co line excitation of hermesj105751.1+573027 (hlsw-01), a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy discoveredin herschel/spire observations as part of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). hlsw-01 is an ultra-luminous galaxy with anintrinsic far-infrared luminosity of 1.4x10^(13) solar luminosities, and islensed by a massive group of galaxies into at least four images with a totalmagnification of 10.9+/-0.7. with the 100 ghz instantaneous bandwidth of thez-spec instrument on the caltech submillimeter observatory, we robustlyidentify a redshift of z=2.958+/-0.007 for this source, using the simultaneousdetection of four co emission lines (j = 7-6, j = 8-7, j = 9-8, and j = 10-9).combining the measured line fluxes for these high-j transitions with the j =1-0, j = 3-2 and j = 5-4 line fluxes measured with the green bank telescope,the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy, and the plateau debure interferometer, respectively, we model the physical properties of themolecular gas in this galaxy. we find that the full co spectral line energydistribution is well described by warm, moderate-density gas with tkin = 86-235k and n(h2) = (1.1-3.5)x10^3 cm^(-3). however, it is possible that thehighest-j transitions are tracing a small fraction of very dense gas inmolecular cloud cores, and two-component models that include a warm/densemolecular gas phase with tkin ~ 200 k, n(h2) ~ 10^5 cm^(-3) are also consistentwith these data. higher signal-to-noise measurements of the j(upper) &gt; 7transitions with high spectral resolution, combined with high spatialresolution co maps, are needed to improve our understanding of the gasexcitation, morphology, and dynamics of this interesting high-redshift galaxy.

1104.4116	dynamical structure of the molecular interstellar medium in an extremely  bright, multiply lensed z~3 submillimeter galaxy discovered with herschel	we report the detection of co 5-4, 3-2, and 1-0 emission in the stronglylensed, herschel/spire-selected submillimeter galaxy (smg) hlsw-01 atz=2.9574+/-0.0001, using the plateau de bure interferometer, the combined arrayfor research in millimeter-wave astronomy, and the green bank telescope. theobservations spatially resolve the molecular gas into four lensed images with amaximum separation of ~9", and reveal the internal gas dynamics in this system.we derive lensing-corrected co line luminosities of l'(co 1-0) = (4.17+/-0.41),l'(co 3-2) = (3.96+/-0.20) and l'(co 5-4) = (3.45+/-0.20) x 10^10(mu_l/10.9)^-1 kkm/s pc^2, corresponding to luminosity ratios of r_31 =0.95+/-0.10, r_53 = 0.87+/-0.06, and r_51 = 0.83+/-0.09. this suggests a totalmolecular gas mass of mgas = 3.3 x 10^10 (alpha_co/0.8) (mu_l/10.9)^-1 msun.the gas mass, gas mass fraction, gas depletion timescale, star formationefficiency, and specific star formation rate are typical for an smg. thevelocity structure of the gas reservoir suggests that the brightest two lensedimages are dynamically resolved projections of the same dust-obscured region inthe galaxy that are kinematically offset from the unresolved fainter images.the resolved kinematics appear consistent with the complex velocity structureobserved in major, `wet' (i.e., gas-rich) mergers. major mergers are commonlyobserved in smgs, and are likely to be responsible for fueling their intensestarbursts at high gas consumption rates. this study demonstrates the level ofdetail to which galaxies in the early universe can be studied by utilizing theincrease in effective spatial resolution and sensitivity provided bygravitational lensing.

1104.4119	modeling of the hermes j105751.1+573027 submillimeter source lensed by a  dark matter dominated foreground group of galaxies	we present the results of a gravitational lensing analysis of the bright$\zs=2.957$ sub-millimeter galaxy (smg), hermes j105751.1+573027 found in {\itherschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes) project. the high resolution imaging available inoptical and near-ir channels, along with co emission obtained with the plateaude bure interferometer, allow us to precisely estimate the intrinsic sourceextension and hence estimate the total lensing magnification to be $\mu=10.9\pm0.7$. we measure the half-light radius $r_{\rm eff}$ of the source in therest-frame near-uv and $v$ bands that characterize the unobscured light comingfrom stars and find $r_{\rm eff,*}= [2.0 \pm 0.1]$ kpc, in good agreement withrecent studies on the submillimeter galaxy population. this lens model is alsoused to estimate the size of the gas distribution ($r_{\rm eff,gas}=[1.1\pm0.5]$) kpc by mapping back in the source plane the co (j=5-4) transitionline emission. the lens modeling yields a relatively large einstein radius$r_{\rm ein}= 4\farcs10 \pm 0\farcs02$, corresponding to a deflector velocitydispersion of [$483\pm 16] \,\kms$. this shows that hermes j105751.1+573027 islensed by a {\it galaxy group-size} dark matter halo at redshift $\zl\sim 0.6$.the projected dark matter contribution largely dominates the mass budget withinthe einstein radius with $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm ein})\sim 80%$. this fractionreduces to $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm eff,g1}\simeq 4.5\kpc)\sim 47%$ within theeffective radius of the main deflecting galaxy of stellar mass $m_{\rm*,g1}=[8.5\pm 1.6] \times 10^{11}\msun$. at this smaller scale the dark matterfraction is consistent with results already found for massive lensingellipticals at $z\sim0.2$ from the slacs survey.

1105.3199	herschel-atlas: detection of a far-infrared population around galaxy  clusters	we report the detection of a significant excess in the surface density offar-infrared sources from the herschel-astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) within ~1 mpc of the centres of 66 optically-selected clustersof galaxies in the sdss with &lt;z&gt;~0.25. from the analysis of the multiwavelengthproperties of their counterparts we conclude that the far-infrared emission isassociated with dust-obscured star formation and/or active galactic nucleiwithin galaxies in the clusters themselves. the excess reaches a maximum at aradius of ~0.8 mpc, where we find 1.0\pm0.3 s_250um&gt;34 mjy sources on averageper cluster above what would be expected for random field locations. if thefar-infrared emission is dominated by star formation (as opposed to agn) thenthis corresponds to an average star formation rate of ~7 m_sun/yr per clusterin sources with l_ir&gt;5d10 l_sun. although lensed sources make a negligiblecontribution to the excess signal, a fraction of the sources around theclusters could be gravitationally lensed, and we have identified a sample ofpotential cases of cluster-lensed herschel sources that could be targeted infollow-up studies.

1105.3924	physical conditions of the interstellar medium of high-redshift,  strongly lensed submillimetre galaxies from the herschel-atlas	we present herschel-spire fourier transform spectrometer (fts) and radiofollow-up observations of two herschel-atlas (h-atlas) detected strongly lenseddistant galaxies. in one of the targeted galaxies h-atlas j090311.6+003906(sdp.81) we detect [oiii] 88\mum and [cii] 158\mum lines at a signal-to-noiseratio of ~5. we do not have any positive line identification in the otherfainter target h-atlas j091305.0-005343 (sdp.130). currently sdp.81 is thefaintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the fts, withcontinuum flux just below 200 mjy in the 200-600 \mum wavelength range. thederived redshift of sdp.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 +/-0.012, inagreement with ground-based co measurements. this is the first detection byherschel of the [oiii] 88\mum line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05.comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociationregion (pdr) models with different physical conditions, we derive the pdr clouddensity n ~ 2000 cm^{-3} and the far-uv ionizing radiation field g_0 ~ 200 (inunits of the habing field -- the local galactic interstellar radiation field of1.6x10^{-6} w/m^2). using the co derived molecular mass and the pdr propertieswe estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. thesecharacteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. the radioobservations indicate that sdp.81 deviates significantly from the localfir/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission iscoming from an agn. the constraints on the source size from millimiter-waveobservations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible agncontribution to less than 33%. these indications, together with the high[oiii]/fir ratio and the upper limit of [oi] 63\mum/[cii] 158\mum suggest thatsome fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an agn.

1105.4093	the pep survey: clustering of infrared-selected galaxies and structure  formation at z~2 in the goods south	abridged-this paper presents the first direct estimate of the 3d clusteringproperties of far-infrared sources up to z~3. this has been possible thanks tothe pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey of the goods south field performedwith the pacs instrument onboard the herschel satellite. an analysis of thetwo-point correlation function over the whole redshift range spanned by thedata reports for the correlation length, r_0~6.3 mpc and r_0~6.7 mpc,respectively at 100um and 160um, corresponding to dark matter halo massesm&gt;~10^{12.4} m_sun. objects at z~2 instead seem to be more strongly clustered,with r_0~19 mpc and r_0~17 mpc in the two considered pacs channels. thisdramatic increase of the correlation length between z~1 and z~2 is connectedwith the presence of a wide, m&gt;~10^{14} m_sun, filamentary structure whichincludes more than 50% of the sources detected at z~2. an investigation of theproperties of such sources indicates the possibility for boosted star-formingactivity in those which reside within the overdense environment with respect ofmore isolated galaxies found in the same redshift range. lastly, we alsopresent our results on the evolution of the relationship between luminous anddark matter in star-forming galaxies between z~1 and z~2. we find that theincrease of (average) stellar mass in galaxies &lt;m*&gt; between z~1 and z~2 isabout a factor 10 lower than that of the dark matter haloes hosting suchobjects (&lt;m*&gt;[z~1]/&lt;m*&gt;[z~2] ~ 0.4 vs m_{halo}[z~1]/m_{halo}[z~2] ~ 0.04). ourfindings agree with the evolutionary picture of downsizing whereby massivegalaxies at z~2 were more actively forming stars than their z~1 counterparts,while at the same time contained a lower fraction of their mass in the form ofluminous matter.

1106.1186	the impact of evolving infrared spectral energy distributions of  galaxies on star formation rate estimates	we combine herschel-pacs data from the pep program with spitzer 24 um and 16um photometry and ultra deep irs mid-infrared spectra, to measure the mid- tofar-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) of 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.5 normal starforming galaxies around the main sequence (the redshift-dependent relation ofstar formation rate and stellar mass). our deep data confirm from individualfar-infrared detections that z~2 star formation rates are overestimated ifbased on 24 um fluxes and sed templates that are calibrated via local trendswith luminosity. galaxies with similar ratios of rest-frame nulnu(8) to 8-1000um infrared luminosity (lir) tend to lie along lines of constant offset fromthe main sequence. we explore the relation between sed shape and offset inspecific star formation rate (ssfr) from the redshift-dependent main sequence.main sequence galaxies tend to have a similar nulnu(8)/lir regardless of lirand redshift, up to z~2.5, and nulnu(8)/lir decreases with increasing offsetabove the main sequence in a consistent way at the studied redshifts. weprovide a redshift-independent calibration of sed templates in the range of8--60 um as a function of log(ssfr) offset from the main sequence. redshiftdependency enters only through the evolution of the main sequence with time.ultra deep irs spectra match these sed trends well and verify that they aremostly due to a change in ratio of pah to lir rather than continua of hiddenagn. alternatively, we discuss the dependence of nulnu(8)/lir on lir. samenulnu(8)/lir is reached at increasingly higher lir at higher redshift, withshifts relative to local by 0.5 and 0.8 dex in log(lir) at redshifts z~1 andz~2. corresponding sed template calibrations are provided for use if no stellarmasses are in hand. for most of those z~2 star forming galaxies that also hostan agn, the mid-infrared is dominated by the star forming component.

1108.0933	the lesser role of starbursts for star formation at z=2	two main modes of star formation are know to control the growth of galaxies:a relatively steady one in disk-like galaxies, defining a tight star formationrate (sfr)-stellar mass sequence, and a starburst mode in outliers to such asequence which is generally interpreted as driven by merging. such starburstgalaxies are rare but have much higher sfrs, and it is of interest to establishthe relative importance of these two modes. pacs/herschel observations over thewhole cosmos and goods-south fields, in conjunction with previousoptical/near-ir data, have allowed us to accurately quantify for the first timethe relative contribution of the two modes to the global sfr density in theredshift interval 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, i.e., at the cosmic peak of the star formationactivity. the logarithmic distributions of galaxy sfrs at fixed stellar massare well described by gaussians, with starburst galaxies representing only arelatively minor deviation that becomes apparent for sfrs more than 4 timeshigher than on the main sequence. such starburst galaxies represent only 2% ofmass-selected star forming galaxies and account for only 10% of the cosmic sfrdensity at z~2. only when limited to sfr&gt;1000m(sun)/yr, off-sequence sourcessignificantly contribute to the sfr density (46+/-20%). we conclude thatmerger-driven starbursts play a relatively minor role for the formation ofstars in galaxies, whereas they may represent a critical phase towards thequenching of star formation and morphological transformation in galaxies.

1108.3911	herschel-atlas galaxy counts and high redshift luminosity functions: the  formation of massive early type galaxies	exploiting the herschel-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp) survey data,we have determined the luminosity functions (lfs) at rest-frame wavelengths of100 and 250 micron and at several redshifts z&gt;1, for bright sub-mm galaxieswith star formation rates (sfr) &gt;100 m_sun/yr. we find that the evolution ofthe comoving lf is strong up to z~2.5, and slows down at higher redshifts. fromthe lfs and the information on halo masses inferred from clustering analysis,we derived an average relation between sfr and halo mass (and its scatter). wealso infer that the timescale of the main episode of dust-enshrouded starformation in massive halos (m_h&gt;3*10^12 m_sun) amounts to ~7*10^8 yr. given thesfrs, which are in the range 10^2-10^3 m_sun/yr, this timescale implies finalstellar masses of order of 10^11-10^12 m_sun. the corresponding stellar massfunction matches the observed mass function of passively evolving galaxies atz&gt;1. the comparison of the statistics for sub-mm and uv selected galaxiessuggests that the dust-free, uv bright phase, is &gt;10^2 times shorter than thesub-mm bright phase, implying that the dust must form soon after the onset ofstar formation. using a single reference spectral energy distribution (sed; theone of the z~2.3 galaxy smm j2135-0102), our simple physical model is able toreproduce not only the lfs at different redshifts &gt; 1 but also the counts atwavelengths ranging from 250 micron to ~1 mm. owing to the steepness of thecounts and their relatively broad frequency range, this result suggests thatthe dispersion of sub-mm seds of z&gt;1 galaxies around the reference one israther small.

1109.2887	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: spire-mm photometric  redshifts	we investigate the potential of submm-mm and submm-mm-radio photometricredshifts using a sample of mm-selected sources as seen at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m by the spire instrument on herschel. from a sample of 63 previouslyidentified mm-sources with reliable radio identifications in the goods-n andlockman hole north fields 46 (73 per cent) are found to have detections in atleast one spire band. we explore the observed submm/mm colour evolution withredshift, finding that the colours of mm-sources are adequately described by amodified blackbody with constant optical depth {\tau} = ({\nu}/{\nu}0)^{\beta}where {\beta} = +1.8 and {\nu}0 = c/100 {\mu}m. we find a tight correlationbetween dust temperature and ir luminosity. using a single model of the dusttemperature and ir luminosity relation we derive photometric redshift estimatesfor the 46 spire detected mm-sources. testing against the 22 sources with knownspectroscopic, or good quality optical/near-ir photometric, redshifts we findsubmm/mm photometric redshifts offer a redshift accuracy of |z|/(1+z) = 0.16 (&lt;|z| &gt;= 0.51). including constraints from the radio-far ir correlation theaccuracy is improved to |z|/(1 + z) = 0.15 (&lt; |z| &gt;= 0.45). we estimate theredshift distribution of mm-selected sources finding a significant excess at z&gt; 3 when compared to ~ 850 {\mu}m selected samples.

1109.6274	h-atlas/gama: dusty early-type galaxies and passive spirals	we present the dust properties and star-formation histories of localsubmillimetre-selected galaxies in herschel-atlas, classified by opticalmorphology. the early-type galaxies (etgs) that are detected contain as muchdust as typical spirals, and form a unique sample that has been blindlyselected at submillimetre wavelengths.  comparing h-atlas galaxies to a control sample of optically selectedgalaxies, we find 5.5% of luminous etgs are detected in h-atlas. the h-atlasetgs contain a significant mass of cold dust: the mean dust mass is 5.5x10^7msun, with individual galaxies ranging from 9x10^5-4x10^8 msun. this iscomparable to that of spirals in our sample, and is an order of magnitude moredust than that found for the control etgs, which have a median dust massinferred from stacking of (0.8-4.0)x10^6 msun. the etgs detected in h-atlashave bluer nuv-r colours, higher specific star-formation rates and youngerstellar populations than etgs which are optically selected, and may betransitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence. we also find thath-atlas and control etgs inhabit similar low-density environments. we concludethat the dust in h-atlas and control etgs cannot be solely from stellarsources, and a large contribution from dust formed in the ism or externalsources is required. alternatively, dust destruction may not be as efficient aspredicted.  we also explore the properties of the most passive spiral galaxies in oursample with ssfr&lt;10^-11/yr. we find these passive spirals have lowerdust-to-stellar mass ratios, higher stellar masses and older stellar populationages than normal spirals. the passive spirals inhabit low density environmentssimilar to those of the normal spiral galaxies in our sample. this shows thatthe processes which turn spirals passive do not occur solely in theintermediate density environments of group and cluster outskirts.

1110.2946	the evolution of the star formation activity per halo mass up to  redshift ~ 1.6 as seen by herschel	star formation in massive galaxies is quenched at some point duringhierarchical mass assembly. to understand where and when the quenchingprocesses takes place, we study the evolution of the total star formation rateper unit total halo mass (\sigma(sfr/m)) in three different mass scales: lowmass halos (field galaxies), groups, and clusters, up to a redshift ~1.6. weuse deep far-infrared pacs data at 100 and 160 um to accurately estimate thetotal star formation rate of the luminous infrared galaxy population of 9clusters with mass ~10^{15} m_{\odot}, and 9 groups/poor clusters with mass ~ 5x 10^{13} m_{\odot}. estimates of the field \sigma(sfr/m) are derived from theliterature, by dividing the star formation rate density by the mean comovingmatter density of the universe. the field \sigma(sfr/m) increases with redshiftup to z~1 and it is constant thereafter. the evolution of the \sigma(sfr/m)-zrelation in galaxy systems is much faster than in the field. up to redshiftz~0.2, the field has a higher \sigma(sfr/m) than galaxy groups and galaxyclusters. at higher redshifts, galaxy groups and the field have similar\sigma(sfr/m), while massive clusters have significantly lower \sigma(sfr/m)than both groups and the field. there is a hint of a reversal of the sfractivity vs. environment at z~1.6, where the group \sigma(sfr/m) lies above thefield \sigma(sfr/m)-z relation. we discuss possible interpretations of ourresults in terms of the processes of downsizing, and star-formation quenching.

1111.4402	gmass ultradeep spectroscopy of galaxies at z ~ 2 - vii. star formation,  extinction, and gas outflows from uv spectra	we use rest-frame uv spectroscopy to investigate the properties related tolarge-scale gas outflows, and to the dust extinction and star-formation ratesof a sample of z ~ 2 star-forming galaxies from the galaxy mass assemblyultradeep spectroscopic survey (gmass). dust extinction is estimated from therest-frame uv continuum slope and used to obtain dust-corrected star-formationrates for the galaxies of the sample. for the entire sample, a mean value ofthe continuum slope &lt;\beta&gt; = -1.11 \pm 0.44 (r.m.s.) was derived, while theaverage sfr was found to be &lt;sfr&gt; = 52 \pm 48 m_sun/yr (r.m.s.). a positivecorrelation between sfr and stellar mass was observed, in agreement with otherworks, the logarithmic slope of the relation being 1.10 \pm 0.10.low-ionization absorption lines, associated with the interstellar medium, werefound to be blueshifted, with respect to the rest frame of the system, whichindicates that there is outflowing gas with typical velocities of the order of~ 100 km/s. finally, investigating correlations between galaxy uv spectralcharacteristics and galaxy general properties, we report a possible correlationbetween the equivalent width of the interstellar absorption lines and sfr,stellar mass, and colour excess similar to that seen to hold at differentredshifts.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1201.4394	enhanced star formation rates in agn hosts with respect to inactive  galaxies from pep-herschel observations	we compare the average star formation (sf) activity in x-ray selected agnhosts with mass-matched control inactive galaxies,including star forming andquiescent sources, at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5. recent observations carried out by pacs, the60-210um herschel photometric camera, in goods-s, goods-n and cosmos allow usto unbiasedly estimate the far-ir luminosity, and hence the sf properties, ofthe two samples. accurate agn host stellar masses are measured by decomposingtheir total emission into the stellar and nuclear components. we find a higheraverage sf activity in agn hosts with respect to non-agns. the level of sfenhancement is modest (~0.26dex at ~3sigma) at low x-ray luminosities(lx&lt;~10^43.5erg/s) and more pronounced (0.56dex at &gt;10sigma) for bright agns.however, when comparing to star forming galaxies only, agn hosts are broadlyconsistent with the locus of their `main sequence'. we investigate the relativefar-ir luminosity distributions of active and inactive galaxies, and find ahigher fraction of pacs detected, hence normal and highly star forming systemsamong agn hosts. although different interpretations are possible, we explainour findings as a consequence of a twofold agn growth path: faint agns evolvethrough secular processes, with instantaneous agn accretion not tightly linkedto the current total sf in the host, while luminous agns co-evolve with theirhosts through periods of enhanced agn activity and sf, possibly through majormergers. while an increased sf with respect to non-agns of similar mass isexpected in the latter, we interpret the modest sf offsets measured in low-lxagn hosts as either a) generated by non-synchronous accretion and sf historiesin a merger scenario or b) due to possible connections between instantaneous sfand accretion that can be induced by smaller scale (non-major merger)mechanisms. far-ir luminosity distributions favour the latter scenario.

1202.0402	herschel-atlas: towards a sample of ~1000 strongly-lensed galaxies	while the selection of strongly lensed galaxies with 500{\mu}m flux densitys_500&gt;100 mjy has proven to be rather straightforward (negrello et al. 2010),for many applications it is important to analyze samples larger than the onesobtained when confining ourselves to such a bright limit. moreover, only byprobing to fainter flux densities is possible to exploit strong lensing toinvestigate the bulk of the high-z star-forming galaxy population. we describehalos (the herschel-atlas lensed objects selection), a method for efficientlyselecting fainter candidate strongly lensed galaxies, reaching a surfacedensity of ~1.5-2 deg^-2, i.e. a factor of about 4 to 6 higher than that at the100 mjy flux limit. halos will allow the selection of up to ~1000 candidatestrongly lensed galaxies (with amplifications \mu&gt;2) over the full h-atlassurvey area. applying halos to the h-atlas science demonstration phase field(~14.4 deg^2) we find 31 candidate strongly lensed galaxies, whose candidatelenses are identified in the viking near-infrared catalog. using the availableinformation on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a~72% purity of the sample. the redshift distribution of the candidate lensedsources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensedgalaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to substantially higherredshifts than found in the other surveys. the counts of candidate stronglylensed galaxies are also in good agreement with model predictions (lapi et al.2011). even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infraredviking photometry, we show that h-atlas data alone allow the selection of asimilarly deep sample of candidate strongly lensed galaxies with an efficiencyclose to 50%; a slightly lower surface density (~1.45 deg^-2) can be reachedwith a ~70% efficiency.

1202.0761	a herschel view of the far-infrared properties of submillimetre galaxies	we study a sample of 61 submillimetre galaxies (smgs) selected fromground-based surveys, with known spectroscopic redshifts and observed withherschel as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key programmes. we use the broadfar-infrared wavelength coverage (100-600um) provided by the combination ofpacs and spire observations. using a power-law temperature distribution modelto derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dustemissivity spectral index for smgs of beta=2.0+/-0.2. our results unveil thediversity of the smg population. some smgs exhibit extreme infraredluminosities of ~10^13 lsun and relatively warm dust components, while othersare fainter (~10^12 lsun) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. theextreme infrared luminosities of some smgs (lir&gt;10^12.7 lsun, 26/61 systems)imply sfrs of &gt;500msun yr^-1. such high sfrs are difficult to reconcile with asecular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-drivenstage in the evolution of these galaxies. another observational argument infavour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than thatof smgs of lower luminosities (~40k as opposed to ~25k), consistent withobservations of local ulirgs triggered by major mergers and with results fromhydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfercalculations. luminous smgs are also offset from normal star-forming galaxiesin the stellar mass-sfr plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburstevents with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. onthe other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity smgs havecold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of starformation, and thus might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation.[abridged]

1203.2562	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: hermes	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey, hermes, is a legacy programdesigned to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. fields range insize from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using herschel-spire (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),and herschel-pacs (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of270 deg^2 with spire alone. these bands cover the peak of the redshiftedthermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capturethe re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation thathas been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a completemulti-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.  the survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of thebest studied fields in the sky. additionally, hermes is closely coordinatedwith the pacs evolutionary probe survey. making maximum use of the fullspectrum of ancillary data, from radio to x-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; andunderstand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and otherprocesses. scientific questions hermes will be used to answer include: thetotal infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populationsof galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statisticaltechniques.  this paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines theprimary scientific goals of the hermes team, and reviews some of the earlyresults.

1203.6069	the mean star formation rate of x-ray selected active galaxies and its  evolution from z=2.5: results from pep-herschel	(abridged) we study relationships between the sfr and the nuclear propertiesof x-ray selected agns out to z=2.5, using far-ir data in three extragalacticdeep fields as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) program. guided bystudies of intrinsic infra-red agn seds, we show that the majority of the firemission in agns is produced by cold dust heated by star-formation. we uncovercharacteristic redshift-dependent trends between the mean fir luminosity(l_fir) and accretion luminosity (l_agn) of agns. at low agn luminosities,accretion and sfr are uncorrelated at all redshifts, consistent with a scenariowhere most low-luminosity agns are primarily fueled by secular processes intheir host galaxies. at high agn luminosities, a significant correlation isobserved between l_fir and l_agn, but only among agns at low and moderateredshifts (z&lt;1). we interpret this as a signature of the increasing importanceof major-mergers in driving both the growth of super-massive black holes(smbhs) and global star-formation in their hosts at high agn luminosities.however, we also find that the enhancement of sfr in luminous agns weakens ordisappears at high redshifts (z&gt;1). this suggests that the role of mergers insmbh-galaxy co-evolution is less important at these epochs. at all redshifts,we find essentially no relationship between l_fir and nuclear obscurationacross five orders of magnitude in obscuring column density, suggesting thatvarious different mechanisms are likely to be responsible for obscuring x-raysin active galaxies. we explain our results within a scenario in which twodifferent modes of smbh fueling operate among low- and high-luminosity agns. wepostulate, guided by emerging knowledge about the properties of high redshiftgalaxies, that the dominant mode of accretion among high-luminosity agnsevolves with redshift.

1204.1152	the agn content in luminous ir galaxies at z\sim2 from a global sed  analysis including herschel data	we use herschel-pacs far-infrared data, combined with previous multi-bandinformation and mid-ir spectra, to properly account for the presence of anactive nucleus and constrain its energetic contribution in luminous infrared(ir) sources at z\sim2. the sample is composed of 24 sources in the goods-southfield, with typical ir luminosity of 10^{12} lo. data from the 4 ms chandrax-ray imaging in this field are also used to identify and characterize agnemission. we reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution (sed),decomposed into a host-galaxy and an agn component. a smooth-torus model forcircum-nuclear dust is used to account for the direct and re-processedcontribution from the agn. we confirm that galaxies with typicall_{8-1000um}\sim10^{12}lo at z\sim2 are powered predominantly bystar-formation. an agn component is present in nine objects (\sim35% of thesample) at the 3sigma confidence level, but its contribution to the 8-1000 umemission accounts for only \sim5% of the energy budget. the agn contributionrises to \sim23% over the 5-30 um range (in agreement with spitzer irs results)and to \sim60% over the narrow 2-6 um range. the presence of an agn isconfirmed by x-ray data for 3 (out of nine) sources, with x-ray spectralanalysis indicating the presence of significant absorption, i.e.nh\sim10^{23}-10^{24} cm^{-2}. an additional source shows indications ofobscured agn emission from x-ray data. the comparison between themid-ir--derived x-ray luminosities and those obtained from x-ray data suggeststhat obscuration is likely present also in the remaining six sources thatharbour an agn according to the sed-fitting analysis.

0711.0843	clustering of galaxies at 3.6 microns in the spitzer wide-area infrared  extragalactic legacy survey	we investigate the clustering of galaxies selected in the 3.6 micron band ofthe spitzer wide-area infrared extragalactic (swire) legacy survey. the angulartwo-point correlation function is calculated for eleven samples with fluxlimits of s_3.6 &gt; 4-400 mujy, over an 8 square degree field. the angularclustering strength is measured at &gt;5-sigma significance at all flux limits,with amplitudes of a=(0.49-29)\times10^{-3} at one degree, for a power-lawmodel, a\theta^{-0.8}. we estimate the redshift distributions of the samplesusing phenomological models, simulations and photometric redshifts, and soderive the spatial correlation lengths. we compare our results with the galics(galaxies in cosmological simulations) models of galaxy evolution and withparameterized models of clustering evolution. the galics simulations areconsistent with our angular correlation functions, but fail to match thespatial clustering inferred from the phenomological models or the photometricredshifts. we find that the uncertainties in the redshift distributions of oursamples dominate the statistical errors in our estimates of the spatialclustering. at low redshifts (median z&lt;0.5) the comoving correlation length isapproximately constant, r_0=6.1\pm0.5h^{-1} mpc, and then decreases withincreasing redshift to a value of 2.9\pm0.3h^{-1} mpc for the faintest sample,for which the median redshift is z=1. we suggest that this trend can beattributed to a decrease in the average galaxy and halo mass in the fainterflux-limited samples, corresponding to changes in the relative numbers ofearly- and late-type galaxies. however, we cannot rule out strong evolution ofthe correlation length over 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.

1205.2045	clustering of star-forming galaxies detected in mid-infrared with the  spitzer wide-area survey	we discuss the clustering properties of galaxies with signs of ongoing starformation detected by the spitzer space telescope at 24mum band in the swirelockman hole field. the sample of mid-ir-selected galaxies includes ~20,000objects detected above a flux threshold of s24mum=310mujy. we adoptoptical/near-ir color selection criteria to split the sample into thelower-redshift and higher-redshift galaxy populations. we measure the angularcorrelation function on scales of theta=0.01-3.5 deg, from which, using thelimber inversion along with the redshift distribution established for similarlyselected source populations in the goods fields (rodighiero et al. 2010), weobtain comoving correlation lengths of r0=4.98+-0.28 h^-1 mpc and r0=8.04+-0.69 h^-1 mpc for the low-z (&lt;z&gt;=0.7) and high-z (&lt;z&gt;=1.7) subsamples,respectively. comparing these measurements with the correlation functions ofdark matter halos identified in the bolshoi cosmological simulation (klypin etal. 2011}, we find that the high-redshift objects reside in progressively moremassive halos reaching mtot&gt;3e12 h^-1 msun, compared to mtot&gt;7e11 h^-1 msun forthe low-redshift population. approximate estimates of the ir luminosities basedon the catalogs of 24mum sources in the goods fields show that our high-zsubsample represents a population of "distant ulirgs" with lir&gt;10^12lsun, whilethe low-z subsample mainly consists of "lirgs", lir~10^11lsun. the comparisonof number density of the 24mum selected galaxies and of dark matter halos withderived minimum mass mtot shows that only 20% of such halos may hoststar-forming galaxies.

1211.4257	the effect of the high-pass filter data reduction technique on the  herschel pacs photometer psf and noise	we investigate the effect of the "high-pass filter" data reduction techniqueon the herschel pacs psf and noise of the pacs maps at the 70, 100 and 160 umbands and in medium and fast scan speeds. this branch of the pacs photometerpipeline is the most used for cosmological observations and for point-sourceobservations.the calibration of the flux loss due to the median removal appliedby the pacs pipeline (high-pass filter) is done via dedicated simulationsobtained by "polluting" real pacs timelines with fake sources at different fluxlevels. the effect of the data reduction parameter settings on the final mapnoise is done by using selected observations of blank fields with high dataredundancy. we show that the running median removal can cause significant fluxlosses at any flux level. we analyse the advantages and disadvantages ofseveral masking strategies and suggest that a mask based on putting circularpatches on prior positions is the best solution to reduce the amount of fluxloss. we provide a calibration of the point-source flux loss for severalmasking strategies in a large range of data reduction parameters, and as afunction of the source flux. we also show that, for stacking analysis, theimpact of the high-pass filtering effect is to reduce significantly theclustering effect. the analysis of the global noise and noise components of thepacs maps shows that the dominant parameter in determining the final noise isthe high-pass filter width. we also provide simple fitting functions to buildthe error map from the coverage map and to estimate the cross-correlationcorrection factor in a representative portion of the data reduction parameterspace.

1211.4336	hermes: unveiling obscured star formation - the far infrared luminosity  function of ultraviolet-selected galaxies at z~1.5	we study the far-infrared (ir) and sub-millimeter properties of a sample ofultraviolet (uv) selected galaxies at z\sim1.5. using stacking at 250, 350 and500 um from herschel space observatory spire imaging of the cosmos fieldobtained within the hermes key program, we derive the mean ir luminosity as afunction of both uv luminosity and slope of the uv continuum beta. the ir to uvluminosity ratio is roughly constant over most of the uv luminosity range weexplore. we also find that the ir to uv luminosity ratio is correlated withbeta. we observe a correlation that underestimates the correlation derived fromlow-redshift starburst galaxies, but is in good agreement with the correlationderived from local normal star-forming galaxies. using these results wereconstruct the ir luminosity function of our uv-selected sample. thisluminosity function recovers the ir luminosity functions measured from irselected samples at the faintest luminosities (lir ~ 10^{11} l_sun), but mightunderestimate them at the bright-end (lir &gt; 5.10^{11} l_sun). for galaxies with10^{11}&lt;lir/l_sun&lt;10^{13}, the ir luminosity function of a uv selectionrecovers (given the differences in ir-based estimates) 52-65 to 89-112 per centof the star-formation rate density derived from an ir selection. the cosmicstar-formation rate density derived from this ir luminosity function is 61-76to 100-133 per cent of the density derived from ir selections at the sameepoch. assuming the latest herschel results and conservative stackingmeasurements, we use a toy model to fully reproduce the far ir luminosityfunction from our uv selection at z\sim 1.5. this suggests that a sample around4 magnitudes deeper (i.e. reaching u \sim 30 mag) and a large dispersion of their to uv luminosity ratio are required.

1211.6116	the complex physics of dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshifts as  revealed by herschel and spitzer	we combine far-infrared photometry from herschel (pep/hermes) with deepmid-infrared spectroscopy from spitzer to investigate the nature and the massassembly history of a sample of 31 luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxiesat z~1 and 2 selected in goods-s with 24 $\mu$m fluxes between 0.2 and 0.5 mjy.we model the data with a self-consistent physical model (grasil) which includesa state-of-the-art treatment of dust extinction and reprocessing. we find thatall of our galaxies appear to require massive populations of old (&gt;1 gyr) starsand, at the same time, to host a moderate ongoing activity of sf (sfr &lt; 100m$_{\odot}$/yr). the bulk of the stars appear to have been formed a few gyrbefore the observation in essentially all cases. only five galaxies of thesample require a recent starburst superimposed on a quiescent star formationhistory (sfh). we also find discrepancies between our results and those basedon optical-only sed fitting for the same objects; by fitting their observedspectral energy distributions with our physical model we find higherextinctions (by $\delta$a_{v} ~ 0.81 and 1.14) and higher stellar masses (by$\delta$log(m*) ~ 0.16 and 0.36 dex) for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively.the stellar mass difference is larger for the most dust obscured objects. wealso find lower sfrs than those computed from l_{ir} using the kennicuttrelation due to the significant contribution to the dust heating byintermediate-age stellar populations through 'cirrus' emission (~73% and ~66%of total l_{ir} for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively).

1301.4496	panchromatic spectral energy distributions of herschel sources	(abridged) far-infrared herschel photometry from the pep and hermes programsis combined with ancillary datasets in the goods-n, goods-s, and cosmos fields.based on this rich dataset, we reproduce the restframe uv to fir ten-colorsdistribution of galaxies using a superposition of multi-variate gaussian modes.the median sed of each mode is then fitted with a modified version of themagphys code that combines stellar light, emission from dust heated by starsand a possible warm dust contribution heated by an agn. the defined gaussiangrouping is also used to identify rare sources. the zoology of outliersincludes herschel-detected ellipticals, very blue z~1 ly-break galaxies,quiescent spirals, and torus-dominated agn with star formation. out of thesegroups and outliers, a new template library is assembled, consisting of 32 sedsdescribing the intrinsic scatter in the restframe uv-to-submm colors ofinfrared galaxies. this library is tested against l(ir) estimates with andwithout herschel data included, and compared to eight other popular methodsoften adopted in the literature. when implementing herschel photometry, theseapproaches produce l(ir) values consistent with each other within a medianabsolute deviation of 10-20%, the scatter being dominated more by fine tuningof the codes, rather than by the choice of sed templates. finally, the libraryis used to classify 24 micron detected sources in pep goods fields. agn appearto be distributed in the stellar mass (m*) vs. star formation rate (sfr) spacealong with all other galaxies, regardless of the amount of infrared luminositythey are powering, with the tendency to lie on the high sfr side of the "mainsequence". the incidence of warmer star-forming sources grows for objects withhigher specific star formation rates (ssfr), and they tend to populate the"off-sequence" region of the m*-sfr-z space.

1304.7110	the herschel-pep survey: evidence for downsizing in the hosts of dusty  star-forming systems	by making use of herschel-pep observations of the cosmos and extended grothstrip fields, we have estimated the dependence of the clustering properties offir-selected sources on their 100um fluxes. our analysis shows a tendency forthe clustering strength to decrease with limiting fluxes: r0(s100um &gt;8 mjy)~4.3mpc and r0(s100um &gt;5 mjy)~5.8 mpc. these values convert into minimum halomasses mmin~10^{11.6} msun for sources brighter than 8 mjy and mmin~10^{12.4}msun for s100um &gt; 5 mjy galaxies. we show such an increase of the clusteringstrength to be due to an intervening population of z~2 sources, which are verystrongly clustered and whose relative contribution, equal to about 10% of thetotal counts at s100um &gt; 2 mjy, rapidly decreases for brighter flux cuts. byremoving such a contribution, we find that z &lt;~ 1 fir galaxies haveapproximately the same clustering properties, irrespective of their flux level.the above results were then used to investigate the intrinsic dependence oncosmic epoch of the clustering strength of dusty star-forming galaxies betweenz~0 and z~2.5. in order to remove any bias in the selection process, theadopted sample only includes galaxies observed at the same rest-framewavelength, lambda~60 um, which have comparable luminosities and thereforestar-formation rates (sfr&gt;~100 msun/yr). our analysis shows that the sameamount of (intense) star forming activity takes place in extremely differentenvironments at the different cosmological epochs. for z&lt;~1 the hosts of suchstar forming systems are small, mmin~10^{11} msun, isolated galaxies. high(z~2) redshift star formation instead seems to uniquely take place in extremelymassive/cluster-like halos, mmin~10^{13.5} msun, which are associated with thehighest peaks of the density fluctuation field at those epochs.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1310.4950	the fmos-cosmos survey of star-forming galaxies at z~1.6 ii. the  mass-metallicity relation and the dependence on star formation rate and dust  extinction	we investigate the relationships between stellar mass, gas-phase oxygenabundance (metallicity), star formation rate, and dust content of star-forminggalaxies at z$\sim$1.6 using subaru/fmos spectroscopy in the cosmos field. themass-metallicity relation at $z\sim1.6$ is steeper than the relation observedin the local universe. the steeper mz relation at $z\sim1.6$ is mainly due toevolution in the stellar mass where the mz relation begins to turnover andflatten. this turnover mass is 1.2 dex larger at $z\sim1.6$. the most massivegalaxies at $z\sim1.6$ ($\sim 10^{11}m_\odot$) are enriched to the levelobserved in massive galaxies in the local universe. the mass-metallicityrelation we measure at $z\sim1.6$ supports the suggestion of an empirical uppermetallicity limit that does not significantly evolve with redshift. we find ananti-correlation between metallicity and star formation rate for galaxies at afixed stellar mass at $z\sim1.6$ which is similar to trends observed in thelocal universe. we do not find a relation between stellar mass, metallicity andstar formation rate that is independent of redshift; our data suggest thatthere is redshift evolution in this relation. we examine the relation betweenstellar mass, metallicity and dust extinction. we find that at a fixed stellarmass dustier galaxies tend to be more metal rich. from examination of thestellar masses, metallicities, sfrs and dust extinctions we conclude thatstellar mass is most closely related to dust extinction.

1311.2956	the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in the sfr$-m_{\ast}$  plane up to $z$$\,\thicksim\,$$2$	[abridged] we study the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in thesfr-m* plane up to z~2 using observations from the herschel space observatory.starting from a sample of galaxies with reliable star-formation rates (sfrs),stellar masses (m*) and redshift estimates, we grid the sfr-m* parameter spacein several redshift ranges and estimate the mean tdust of each sfr-m*-z bin.dust temperatures are inferred using the stacked far-infrared flux densities ofour sfr-m*-z bins. at all redshifts, tdust increases with infrared luminosities(lir), specific sfrs (ssfr; i.e., sfr/m*) and distances with respect to themain sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane (i.e.,d_ssfr_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). the tdust-ssfr and tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelations are statistically more significant than the tdust-lir one. whilethe slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, theirnormalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. we convert these results into a recipeto derive tdust from sfr, m* and z. the existence of a strong tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelation provides us with information on the dust and gas content ofgalaxies. (i) the slope of the tdust-d__ssfr_ms correlation can be explained bythe increase of the star-formation efficiency (sfe; sfr/mgas) with d_ssfr_ms asfound locally by molecular gas studies. (ii) at fixed d_ssfr_ms, the constanttdust observed in galaxies probing large ranges in sfr and m* can be explainedby an increase or decrease of the number of star-forming regions withcomparable sfe enclosed in them. (iii) at high redshift, the normalizationtowards hotter temperature of the tdust-d_ssfr_ms correlation can be explainedby the decrease of the metallicities of galaxies or by the increase of the sfeof ms galaxies. all these results support the hypothesis that the conditionsprevailing in the star-forming regions of ms and far-above-ms galaxies aredifferent.

1311.3670	the evolution of the dust and gas content in galaxies	we use deep herschel pacs and spire observations in goodss, goodsn and cosmosto estimate the average dust mass (mdust) of galaxies on a redshift-stellarmass (mstar)-sfr grid. we study the scaling relations between mdust, mstar andsfr at z&lt;=2.5. no clear evolution of mdust is observed at fixed sfr and mstar.we find a tight correlation between sfr and mdust, likely a consequence of theschmidt-kennicutt (s-k) law. the mstar-mdust correlation observed by previousworks flattens or sometimes disappears when fixing the sfr. most of it likelyderives from the combination of the mdust-sfr and mstar-sfr correlations. wethen investigate the gas content as inferred by converting mdust by assumingthat the dust/gas ratio scales linearly with the gas metallicity. all galaxiesin the sample follow, within uncertainties, the same sfr-mgas relation(integrated s-k law), which broadly agrees with co-based results for the bulkof the population, despite the completely different approaches. the majority ofgalaxies at z~2 form stars with an efficiency (sfe=sfr/mgas) ~5 times higherthan at z~0. it is not clear what fraction of such variation is an intrinsicredshift evolution and what fraction arises from selection effects. the gasfraction (fgas) decreases with mstar and increases with sfr, and does notevolve with z at fixed mstar and sfr. we explain these trends by introducing auniversal relation between fgas, mstar and sfr, non-evolving out to z~2.5.galaxies move across this relation as their gas content evolves in time. we usethe 3d fundamental fgas-mstar-sfr relation and the redshift evolution of themain sequence to estimate the evolution of fgas in the average population ofgalaxies as a function of z and mstar, and we find evidence a downsizingscenario.

1311.4401	agn feedback at z~2 and the mutual evolution of active and inactive  galaxies	the relationships between galaxies of intermediate stellar mass and moderateluminosity active galactic nuclei (agns) at 1&lt;z&lt;3 are investigated with thegalaxy mass assembly ultra-deep spectroscopic survey (gmass) samplecomplemented with public data in the goods-south field. using x-ray data,hidden agns are identified in unsuspected star-forming galaxies with noapparent signs of non-stellar activity. in the color-mass plane, two paralleltrends emerge during the ~2 gyr between the average redshifts z~2.2 and z~1.3:while the red sequence becomes significantly more populated by ellipticals, themajority of agns with l(2-10 kev)&gt;10^42.3 erg s^-1 disappear from the bluecloud/green valley where they were hosted predominantly by star-forming systemswith disk and irregular morphologies. these results are even clearer when therest-frame colors are corrected for dust reddening. at z~2.2, the ultravioletspectra of active galaxies (including two type 1 agns) show possible gasoutflows with velocities up to about -500 km s^-1 that are not observed neitherin inactive systems at the same redshift, nor at lower redshifts. such outflowsindicate the presence of gas that can move faster than the escape velocities ofactive galaxies. these results suggest that feedback from moderately luminousagns (logl_x&lt;44.5 erg s^-1) played a key role at z&gt;~2 by contributing tooutflows capable of ejecting part of the interstellar medium and leading to arapid decrease in the star formation in host galaxies with stellar masses10&lt;logm&lt;11 m_sun.

1407.8214	the evolution of galaxy star formation activity in massive halos	there is now a large consensus that the current epoch of the cosmic starformation history (csfh) is dominated by low mass galaxies while the mostactive phase at 1&lt;z&lt;2 is dominated by more massive galaxies, which undergo afaster evolution. massive galaxies tend to inhabit very massive halos such asgalaxy groups and clusters. we aim to understand whether the observed "galaxydownsizing" could be interpreted as a "halo downsizing", whereas the mostmassive halos, and their galaxy populations, evolve more rapidly than the halosof lower mass. thus, we study the contribution to the csfh of galaxiesinhabiting group-sized halos. this is done through the study of the evolutionof the infra-red (ir) luminosity function of group galaxies from redshift 0 to~1.6. we use a sample of 39 x-ray selected groups in the extended chandra deepfield south (ecdfs), the chandra deep field north (cdfn), and the cosmos field,where the deepest available mid- and far-ir surveys have been conducted withspitzer mips and hersche pacs. groups at low redshift lack the brightest,rarest, and most star forming ir-emitting galaxies observed in the field. theirir-emitting galaxies contribute &lt;10% of the comoving volume density of thewhole ir galaxy population in the local universe. at redshift &gt;~1, the mostir-luminous galaxies (lirgs and ulirgs) are preferentially located in groups,and this is consistent with a reversal of the star-formation rate vs .densityanti-correlation observed in the nearby universe. at these redshifts, groupgalaxies contribute 60-80% of the csfh, i.e. much more than at lower redshifts.below z~1, the comoving number and sfr densities of ir-emitting galaxies ingroups decline significantly faster than those of all ir-emitting galaxies. ourresults are consistent with a "halo downsizing" scenario and highlight thesignificant role of "environment" quenching in shaping the csfh.

1501.07602	mapping the average agn accretion rate in the sfr-m* plane for herschel  selected galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5	we study the relation of agn accretion, star formation rate (sfr), andstellar mass (m$_*$) using a sample of $\approx$ 8600 star-forming galaxies upto z=2.5 selected with \textit{herschel} imaging in the goods and cosmosfields. for each of them we derive sfr and m$_*$, both corrected, whennecessary, for emission from an active galactic nucleus (agn), through thedecomposition of their spectral energy distributions (seds). about 10 per centof the sample are detected individually in \textit{chandra} observations of thefields. for the rest of the sample we stack the x-ray maps to get average x-rayproperties. after subtracting the x-ray luminosity expected from star formationand correcting for nuclear obscuration, we derive the average agn accretionrate for both detected sources and stacks, as a function of m$_{*}$, sfr andredshift. the average accretion rate correlates with sfr and with m$_*$. thedependence on sfr becomes progressively more significant at z$&gt;$0.8. this maysuggest that sfr is the original driver of these correlations. we find thataverage agn accretion and star formation increase in a similar fashion withoffset from the star-forming "main-sequence". our interpretation is thataccretion onto the central black hole and star formation broadly trace eachother, irrespective of whether the galaxy is evolving steadily on themain-sequence or bursting.

1505.04977	a higher efficiency of converting gas to stars push galaxies at z ~ 1.6  well above the star-forming main sequence	local starbursts have a higher efficiency of converting gas into stars, ascompared to typical star-forming galaxies at a given stellar mass, possiblyindicative of different modes of star formation. with the peak epoch of galaxyformation occurring at z &gt; 1, it remains to be established whether such anefficient mode of star formation is occurring at high-redshift. to address thisissue, we measure the molecular gas content of seven high-redshift (z ~ 1.6)starburst galaxies with the atacama large (sub-)millimeter array andiram/plateau de bure interferometer. our targets are selected from the sampleof herschel far-infrared detected galaxies having star formation rates(~300-800 msolar/yr) elevated (&gt;4x) above the star-forming `main sequence', andincluded in the fmos-cosmos near-infrared spectroscopic survey of star-forminggalaxies at z ~ 1.6 with subaru. we detect co emission in all cases at highlevels of significance, indicative of high gas fractions (~30-50%). even morecompelling, we firmly establish with a clean and systematic selection thatstarbursts, identified as main-sequence outliers, at high redshift generallyhave a lower ratio of co to total infrared luminosity as compared to typicalmain-sequence star-forming galaxies, although with a smaller offset thanexpected based on past studies of local starbursts. we put forward a hypothesisthat there exists a continuous increase in star formation efficiency withelevation from the main sequence with galaxy mergers as a possible physicaldriver. along with a heightened star formation efficiency, our high-redshiftsample is similar in other respects to local starbursts such as being metalrich and having a higher ionization state of the interstellar medium.

1507.00005	dust attenuation in z $\sim$ 1 galaxies from herschel and 3d-hst  h$\alpha$ measurements	we combined the spectroscopic information from the 3d-hst survey with\textit{herschel} data to characterize the h$\alpha$ dust attenuationproperties of a sample of 79 main sequence star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 1$in the goods-s field. the sample was selected in the far-ir, at $\lambda$=100and/or 160 $\mu$m, and only includes galaxies with a secure h$\alpha$ detection(s/n$&gt;$3). from the low resolution 3d-hst spectra we measured the redshifts andthe h$\alpha$ fluxes for the whole sample (a factor of 1/1.2 was applied to theobserved fluxes to remove the [nii] contamination). the stellar masses(m$_{\star}$), infrared (l$_{ir}$) and uv luminosities (l$_{uv}$) were derivedfrom the seds by fitting multi-band data from galex near-uv to spire 500$\mu$m. we estimated the continuum extinction e$_{star}$(b-v) from both theirx=l$_{ir}$/l$_{uv}$ ratio and the uv-slope, $\beta$, and found an excellentagreement between the two. the nebular extinction was estimated from comparisonof the observed sfr$_{h\alpha}$ and sfr$_{uv}$. we obtained\emph{f}=e$_{star}$(b-v)/e$_{neb}$(b-v)=0.93$\pm$0.06, i.e. higher than thecanonical value of \emph{f}=0.44 measured in the local universe. our deriveddust correction produces good agreement between the h$\alpha$ and ir+uv sfrsfor galaxies with sfr$\gtrsim$ 20 m$_{\odot}$/yr and m$_{\star} \gtrsim 5\times 10^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$, while objects with lower sfr and m$_{\star}$ seemto require a smaller \emph{f}-factor (i.e. higher h$\alpha$ extinctioncorrection). our results then imply that the nebular extinction for our sampleis comparable to that in the optical-uv continuum and suggest that the\emph{f}-factor is a function of both m$_{\star}$ and sfr, in agreement withprevious studies.

astro-ph;0010131	spiral and irregular galaxies in the hubble deep field north -  comparison with early types and implications for the global sfr density	we analyze a morphologically-selected complete sample of 52 late-type (spiraland irregular) galaxies in the hubble deep field north with total k-magnitudesbrighter than k=20.47. this sample exploits in particular the ultimate imagingquality achieved by hst in this field, allowing us to clearly disentangle thegalaxy morphologies, based on accurate profiles of the surface brightnessdistributions. our purpose was to investigate systematic differences betweenthe two classes, as for colours, redshift distributions and ages of thedominant stellar populations. this sample appears to miss significantlygalaxies above z=1.4 (in a similar way as an early-type galaxy samplepreviously studied by us), a fact which may be explained as a global decline ofthe underlying mass function for galaxies at these high redshifts. differencesbetween early and late-types are apparent -particularly in the colourdistributions and the evolutionary star-formation (sf) rates per unit volume-,although the complication in spectro-photometric modelling introduced bydust-extinction in the gas-rich systems prevents us to reach conclusive resultson the single sources. however, we find that an integrated quantity like thecomoving star-formation rate density (sfr(t)) as a function of redshift is muchless affected by these uncertainties: by combining this with the previouslystudied early-type galaxy sample, we find a shallower dependence of sfr(t) on zbetween z=0.2 and z=1.5 than found by lilly et al.

astro-ph;0511563	counting individual galaxies from deep 24 micron spitzer surveys: beyond  the confusion limit	we address the question of how to deal with confusion limited surveys in themid-infrared domain by using informations from higher frequency observationsover the same sky regions. such informations, once applied to apparentlyextended mid-infrared sources, which are indeed ``blends'' of two or moredifferent sources, allow us to disentangle the single counterparts and to splitthe measured flux density into different components. we present the applicationof this method to the 24 micron spitzer archival data in the goods-en1 testfield, where apparently extended, ``blended'' sources constitute about 20% of areliable sample of 983 sources detected above the 5-sigma threshold down to 23microjy. as higher frequency data-set we have considered the public irac imagesand catalogues on the same field. we show that the 24 micron sample is almostunbiased down to ~40 microjy and the careful application of the deblendingprocedure does not require any statistical completeness correction (at least atthe flux level considered). this is probed by direct comparison of our resultswith those of chary et al. (2004), who analysed the same data-set throughextensive monte carlo simulations. the deblending procedure reduces of about30% the confusion limit of the mips 24 micron survey, allowing one to obtainreliable source counts down to ~40 microjy. the extrapolation of the sourcecounts down to fainter fluxes suggests that our 24 micron sample is able toresolve ~62% of the cosmic background down to a flux level of 38 microjy.

astro-ph;0602252	the eso-spitzer imaging extragalactic survey (esis) i: wfi b,v,r deep  observations of elais-s1 and comparison to spitzer and galex data	the eso-spitzer extragalactic imaging survey (esis) is the optical follow upof the spitzer wide-area infrared extragalactic (swire) survey in the elais-s1area. this paper presents b, v, r wide field imager observations of the first1.5 square degree of the esis survey. data reduction is described includingastrometric calibration, illumination and color corrections, completeness andphotometric accuracy estimates. number counts and color distributions arecompared to literature observational and theoretical data, includingnon-evolutionary, ple, evolutionary and semi-analytic lambda-cdm galaxy models,as well as milky way stellar predictions. esis data are in good agreement withprevious works and are best reproduced by evolutionary and hierarchicallambda-cdm scenarios. the elais-s1 area benefits from extensive follow-up fromx-ray to radio frequencies: some potential uses of the multi-wavelengthobservations are illustrated. optical-spitzer color-color plots promise to bevery powerful tools to disentangle different classes of sources (e.g. agns,starbursts, quiescent galaxies). ultraviolet galex data are matched to opticaland spitzer samples, leading to a discussion of galaxy properties in theuv-to-24 microns color space. the spectral energy distribution of a fewobjects, from the x-rays to the far-ir are presented as examples of themulti-wavelength study of galaxy emission components in different spectraldomains.

astro-ph;0602463	evolutionary paths for galaxies and agns: new insights by the spitzer  space telescope	we compare the history of the galaxy mass build-up, as inferred from near-irobservations, and the star formation rate of massive stars in the comovingvolume traced by deep extensive far-ir surveys, both possible now with thespitzer space telescope. these two independent and complementary approaches tothe history of galaxy formation consistently indicate that a wide interval ofcosmic epochs between z~0.7 to z~2 brackets the main evolutionary phases. therate of the integrated galaxy mass growth indicated by the ir-based comovingsfr appears consistent with the observed decrease of the stellar mass densitieswith redshift. there are also indications that the evolution with z of thetotal population depends on galaxy mass, being stronger for moderate-mass, butalmost absent up to z=1.4 for high-mass galaxies, thus confirming previousevidence for a "downsizing" effect in galaxy formation. the most massivegalaxies appear already mostly in place by z~1. although a precise matching ofthis galaxy build-up with the growth of nuclear super-massive black-holes isnot possible with the present data (due to difficulties for an accurate censusof the obscured agn phenomenon), some preliminary indications reveal a similarmass/luminosity dependence for agn evolution as for the hosting galaxies.

astro-ph;0604132	gmass, unveiling distant massive galaxies with spitzer	one of the main questions of galaxy formation is how and when galaxiesassembled their mass. observations suggest that most mass assembly and starformation occured at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3. however, in the same redshift range, fullyassembled old and massive galaxies co-exist with star-bursting systems still intheir assembling stage. in order to explore galaxy evolution in this criticalredshift range, we started a project called gmass (galaxy mass assemblyultra-deep spectroscopic survey) based on an 145 hours eso large program andaimed at doing ultradeep spectroscopy with the vlt of a sample of high redshiftgalaxies slected with irac/spitzer m(4.5mu) &lt; 23, z(phot) &gt; 1.4) from thegoods-south/hudf region. the selection at 4.5 micron is crucial to select highredshift galaxies based on the stellar mass or objects affected by strong dustextinction. the spectroscopic deep integration times (15 - 50 hours) are neededto identify unambiguously the redshift and nature of these galaxies, whichredshifts are mostly in the "desert" where spectroscopy is traditionallydifficult due to the absence of strong emission lines at optical wavelengths.the survey is almost complete and some preliminary results are presented here.

astro-ph;0605085	isolated galaxies: residual of primordial building blocks?	context.the mass assembly is believed to be the dominant process of earlygalaxy formation. this mechanism of galaxy building can proceed either byrepeated major mergers with other systems, or by means of accretion of matterfrom the surrounding regions. aims.in this paper we compare the properties oflocal disk galaxies that appear isolated, i.e. not tidally affected by othergalaxies during the last few gyr within the volume given by cz&lt;= 5000 km/s,with those galaxies at z values from 0.25 to 5.  methods.effective radii for 203 isolated galaxies and 1645 galaxies from therc3 have been collected and the two samples have been analyzed statistically. asimilar comparison has been made with half light radii studied at high z fromthe literature.  results.we found that isolated galaxies are in general smaller than otherpresent epoch galaxies from the rc3. we notice the lack of systems larger than7 kpc among them. their size distribution appears to be similar to that ofgalaxies at 1.4 &lt;= z &lt;= 2. the models of the merging history also indicate thatthe isolated galaxies did stop their merging process at about that redshift,evolving passively since then. the galaxy density seems to have remainedunchanged since that epoch.  conclusions.isolated galaxies appears to be the end products of the mergingprocess as proposed in the hierarchical accretion scenario at around z=1.4. forthis class of galaxies this was the last significant merging event in theirlives and have evolved passively since then. this is confirmed by theanalytical estimate of the merging fraction with z and by the comparison withsizes of distant galaxies.

astro-ph;0605305	luminosity functions for galaxies and quasars in the spitzer wide-area  infrared extra-galactic (swire) legacy survey	we construct rest-frame luminosity functions at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8 and 24microns over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;2 for galaxies and 0&lt;z&lt;4 for optical qsos,using optical and infrared data from the spitzer wide-area infraredextragalactic survey. the 3.6 and 4.5 micron galaxy lfs show evidence formoderate positive luminosity evolution up to z~1.5, consistent with the passiveageing of evolved stellar populations. their comoving luminosity density wasfound to evolve passively, gradually increasing out to z~0.5-1 but flattening,or even declining, at higher redshift. conversely, the 24 micron galaxy lf,which is more sensitive to obscured star formation and/or agn activity,undergoes strong positive evolution, with the derived ir energy density and sfrdensity proportional to (1+z)^gamma with gamma=4.5^{+0.7}_{-0.6} and themajority of this evolution occurring since z~1. optical qsos, however, showpositive luminosity evolution in all bands, out to the highest redshifts(3&lt;z&lt;4). modelling as l* proportional to (1+z)^gamma gavegamma=1.3^{+0.1}_{-0.1} at 3.6 micron, gamma=1.0^{+0.1}_{-0.1} at 4.5 micronand stronger evolution at the longer wavelengths (5.8, 8 and 24 micron), ofgamma~3. comparison of the galaxy lfs to predictions from a semi-analytic modelbased on cdm indicate that an imf skewed towards higher mass star formation inbursts compared to locally is preferred. as a result the currently inferredmassive star formation rates in distant sub-mm sources may require substantialdownwards revision.

astro-ph;0610897	galaxy evolution through infrared surveys: from spitzer to herschel	the spitzer space telescope is devoting a significant fraction of theobserving time to multi-wavelength cosmological surveys of different depths invarious low-background sky regions. several tens of thousand mid-ir galaxieshave been detected over a wide interval of redshifts. a progressively clearerpicture of galaxy evolution is emerging, which emphasizes populations ofluminous galaxies at z&gt;1,likely corresponding to the main phases of stellarformation and galaxy assembly. these results are entirely consistent withprevious outcomes from iso, scuba and cobe observations, and provide valuableconstraints of high statistical and photometric precision. we briefly reporthere on our attempt to extract from statistical data some general properties ofgalaxy evolution and describe evidence that a population of very luminousobjects at z&gt;1.5 share different properties from those of starbursts at lowerredshifts, indicating some seemingly anti-hierarchical behavior of galaxyevolution in the ir. we warn, however, that these results are based on large,still uncertain, extrapolations of the observed mid-ir to bolometric fluxes,for measuring which the forthcoming far-ir and submillimetre herschel spaceobservatory will be needed. we finally comment, based on our presentunderstanding, about herschel capabilities for investigating the early phasesof galaxy evolution.

astro-ph;0701178	hidden activity in high-redshift spheroidal galaxies from mid-infrared  and x-ray observations in the goods-north field	we exploit very deep mid-ir (mir) and x-ray observations by spitzer andchandra in the goods north to identify signs of hidden (either starburst oragn) activity in spheroidal galaxies between z~0.3 and 1. our reference is acomplete sample of 168 morphologically classified spheroidal galaxies withz[ab]&lt;22.5 selected from goods acs imaging. nineteen of these have 24 microndetections in the goods catalogue, half of which have an x-ray counterpart inthe 2 ms chandra catalogue, while about 25% have 1.4 ghz fluxes larger than 40microjy. traces of hidden activity in the spheroidal population are alsosearched for in the deep x-ray images and 14 additional galaxies are detectedin x-rays only. the nature of the observed mir emissions is investigated bymodelling their seds based on the available multi-wavelength photometry,including x-ray, uv, optical, near-ir, mir and radio fluxes, and opticalspectroscopy. the amount of dust derived from the ir emission observed byspitzer appears in excess of that expected by mass loss from evolved stars. ouranalysis of the x-ray and mir properties leads us to conclude that at least 8of the 19 24-um bright sources should hide an obscured agn, while the x-rayundetected sources are more likely dominated by star formation. [abridged] weconclude that ~30 objects (~20%) of the original flux-limited sample of 168spheroidal galaxies in the goods-north are detected during phases of prominentactivity, of both stellar and quasar origin. due to the short expectedlifetimes of the ir and x-ray emissions, this fraction might imply asignificant level of activity in this class of galaxies during the relativelyrecent cosmic epochs, z~0.3 to z~1, under investigation.

astro-ph;0703276	unveiling the oldest and most massive galaxies at very high redshift	(abridged) this work explores the existence of high redshift massive galaxiesunveiled with spitzer+irac, but missed by conventional selection techniquesbased on optical and near-infrared observations. to this end, we use themulti-wavelength imaging data available for the goods-south field, and select aflux-limited sample from the irac 3.6um image to m(ab)&lt;23.26. we confine ourstudy to the galaxies undetected by the optical hst+acs imaging and close tothe detection limit of the k-band image (k&gt;23.5 ab). our selection unveiled 20galaxies on which we performed a detailed photometric analysis. for eachgalaxy, we built an sed based on optical-to-8um photometry to estimate thephoto-z and to derive the main galaxies physical properties. the majority ofthe sample sources show degenerate/bimodal solutions for the photometricredshifts (abridged). these can either be heavily dust-enshrouded (av~2-4)starbursts at 2&lt;z&lt;3 with bolometric luminosities l(ir)&gt;10^12 lsun, or massivepost-starburst galaxies in the redshift interval 4&lt;z&lt;9 with stellar masses of10^11 msun. one galaxy, the only source in our sample with both an x-ray and a24um detection, might be an extremely massive object at z~8 detected during apost-starburst phase with concomitant qso activity (although a lower-z solutionis not excluded). our investigation of spitzer-selected galaxies with very redseds and completely undetected in the optical reveals a potential population ofmassive galaxies at z&gt;4 which appear to include significant agn emissions.these sources may be the oldest stellar systems at z~4. these, previouslyunrecognized, optically obscured objects might provide an importantcontribution to the massive-end (m&gt;10^11 sun) of the high-z stellar massfunction and they would almost double it (abridged).

astro-ph;9903349	new photometric models of galactic evolution applied to the hdf	we summarize our modelling of galaxy photometric evolution (grasil code). byincluding the effects of dust grains and pahs molecules in a two phases clumpymedium, where clumps are associated to star forming regions, we reproduce theobserved uv to radio seds of galaxies with star formation rates from zero toseveral hundreds $m_\odot/yr$. grasil is a powerful tool to investigate thestar formation, the initial mass function and the supernovae rate in nearbystarbursts and normal galaxies, as well as to predict the evolution ofluminosity functions of different types of galaxies at wavelengths covering sixdecades. it may be interfaced with any device providing the star formation andmetallicity histories of a galaxy. as an application, we have investigated theproperties of early-type galaxies in the hdf, tracking the contribution of thispopulation to the cosmic star-formation history, which has a broad peak betweenz=1.5 and 4. to explain the absence of objects at z $\gsim$ 1.3, we suggest asequence of dust-enshrouded merging-driven starbursts in the first few gyrs ofgalaxies lifetime. we are at present working on a complementary sample of latetype objects selected in a similar way.
