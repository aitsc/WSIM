0908.2598	the baryonic acoustic feature and large-scale clustering in the sdss lrg  sample	we examine the correlation function \xi of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) luminous red galaxy sample (lrg) at large scales (60&lt;s&lt;400 mpc/h) usingthe final data release (dr7; 105,831 lrgs between 0.16&lt;z&lt;0.47). using mockcatalogs, we demonstrate that the observed baryonic acoustic peak and largerscale signal are consistent with lcdm at the 1.5\sigma level. the signal at155&lt;s&lt;200 mpc/h tends to be high relative to theoretical expectations; thisslight deviation can be attributed to a bright subsample of the lrgs. fittingdata to a non-linear, redshift-space, template based-model, we constrain thepeak position at s_p=103.6+3.6-2.4 mpc/h when fitting the range 60&lt;s&lt;150 mpc/h(1\sigma uncertainties measured from the mocks. this redshift-space distances_p is related to the comoving sound horizon scale r_s after taking intoaccount matter clustering non-linearities, redshift distortions and galaxyclustering bias. mock catalogs show that the probability that a dr7-sizedsample would not have an identifiable peak is at least 10%. as a consistencycheck of a fiducial cosmology, we use the observed s_p to obtain the distanced_v=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3) relative to the acoustic scale. we findr_s/d_v(z=0.278)=0.1394+-0.0049. this result is in excellent agreement withpercival et. al (2009), who examine roughly the same data set, but using thepower spectrum. comparison with other determinations in the literature are alsoin very good agreement. we have tested our results against a battery ofpossible systematic effects, finding all effects are smaller than our estimatedsample variance.

1002.3701	photometric response functions of the sdss imager	the monochromatic illumination system is constructed to carry out in situmeasurements of the response function of the mosaicked ccd imager used in thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). the system is outlined and the results of themeasurements, mostly during the first 6 years of the sdss, are described. wepresent the reference response functions for the five colour passbands derivedfrom these measurements, and discuss column to column variations and variationsin time, and also their effects on photometry. we also discuss the effectarising from various, slightly different response functions of the associateddetector systems that were used to give sdss photometry. we show that thecalibration procedures of sdss remove these variations reasonably well with theresulting final errors from variant response functions being unlikely to belarger than 0.01 mag for g, r, i, and z bands over the entire duration of thesurvey. the considerable aging effect is uncovered in the u band, the responsefunction showing a 30% decrease in the throughput in the short wavelength sideduring the survey years, which potentially causes a systematic error inphotometry. the aging effect is consistent with variation of the instrumentalsensitivity in u-band, which is calibrated out. the expected colour variationis consistent with measured colour variation in the catalog of repeatedphotometry. the colour variation is delta (u-g) ~ 0.01 for most stars, and atmost delta (u-g) ~ 0.02 mag for those with extreme colours. we verified in thefinal catalogue that no systematic variations in excess of 0.01 mag aredetected in the photometry which can be ascribed to aging and/or seasonaleffects except for the secular u-g colour variation for stars with extremecolours.

1005.2413	galaxy clustering in the completed sdss redshift survey: the dependence  on color and luminosity	we measure the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering in thesdss dr7 main galaxy sample, focusing on the projected correlation functionw_p(r_p) of volume-limited samples. we interpret our measurements using halooccupation distribution (hod) modeling assuming a lambda-cdm cosmology. theamplitude of w_p(r_p) grows slowly with luminosity for l &lt; l_* and increasessharply at higher luminosities, with bias factor b(&gt;l)=1.06+0.23(l/l_*)^{1.12}.at fixed luminosity, redder galaxies have a stronger and steeper w_p(r_p), atrend that runs steadily from the bluest galaxies to the reddest galaxies. theindividual luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations arestrikingly different. blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of w_p(r_p)with luminosity, at all scales. the large-scale clustering of red galaxiesshows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at l &gt; 4l_*, but thelowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 l_*) show very strong clustering onscales r_p &lt; 2 mpc/h. most of the observed trends can be naturally understoodwithin the lcdm+hod framework. the growth of w_p(r_p) with luminosity reflectsan overall shift in the halo mass scale, in particular an increase in theminimum host halo mass mmin. the mass at which a halo has, on average, onesatellite galaxy brighter than l is m_1 ~ 17 mmin(l) over most of theluminosity range. the growth and steepening of w_p(r_p) for redder galaxiesreflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in highmass halos instead of central systems in low mass halos, a trend that isespecially marked at low luminosities. our extensive measurements, provided intabular form, will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxyformation, a firm grounding of semi-empirical models of the galaxy population,and new cosmological tests.

1104.5244	the lyman-alpha forest in three dimensions: measurements of large scale  flux correlations from boss 1st-year data	using a sample of approximately 14,000 z&gt;2.1 quasars observed in the firstyear of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), we measure thethree-dimensional correlation function of absorption in the lyman-alpha forest.the angle-averaged correlation function of transmitted flux (f = exp(-tau)) issecurely detected out to comoving separations of 60 mpc/h, the first detectionof flux correlations across widely separated sightlines. a quadrupoledistortion of the redshift-space correlation function by peculiar velocities,the signature of the gravitational instability origin of structure in thelyman-alpha forest, is also detected at high significance. we obtain a good fitto the data assuming linear theory redshift-space distortion and linear bias ofthe transmitted flux, relative to the matter fluctuations of a standard lcdmcosmological model (inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmologicalconstant). at 95% confidence, we find a linear bias parameter 0.16&lt;b&lt;0.24 andredshift-distortion parameter 0.44&lt;beta&lt;1.20, at central redshift z=2.25, witha well constrained combination b(1+\beta)=0.336 +/- 0.012. the errors on betaare asymmetric, with beta=0 excluded at over 5 sigma confidence level. thevalue of beta is somewhat low compared to theoretical predictions, and ourtests on synthetic data suggest that it is depressed (relative to expectationsfor the lyman-alpha forest alone) by the presence of high column densitysystems and metal line absorption. these results set the stage for cosmologicalparameter determinations from three-dimensional structure in the lyman-alphaforest, including anticipated constraints on dark energy from baryon acousticoscillations.

1105.3975	photometric redshifts and quasar probabilities from a single,  data-driven generative model	we describe a technique for simultaneously classifying and estimating theredshift of quasars. it can separate quasars from stars in arbitrary redshiftranges, estimate full posterior distribution functions for the redshift, andnaturally incorporate flux uncertainties, missing data, and multi-wavelengthphotometry. we build models of quasars in flux-redshift space by applying theextreme deconvolution technique to estimate the underlying density. byintegrating this density over redshift one can obtain quasar flux-densities indifferent redshift ranges. this approach allows for efficient, consistent, andfast classification and photometric redshift estimation. this is achieved bycombining the speed obtained by choosing simple analytical forms as the basisof our density model with the flexibility of non-parametric models through theuse of many simple components with many parameters. we show that this techniqueis competitive with the best photometric quasar classificationtechniques---which are limited to fixed, broad redshift ranges and highsignal-to-noise ratio data---and with the best photometric redshift techniqueswhen applied to broadband optical data. we demonstrate that the inclusion of uvand nir data significantly improves photometric quasar--star separation andessentially resolves all of the redshift degeneracies for quasars inherent tothe ugriz filter system, even when included data have a low signal-to-noiseratio. for quasars spectroscopically confirmed by the sdss 84 and 97 percent ofthe objects with galex uv and ukidss nir data have photometric redshifts within0.1 and 0.3, respectively, of the spectroscopic redshift; this amounts to abouta factor of three improvement over ugriz-only photometric redshifts. our codeto calculate quasar probabilities and redshift probability distributions ispublicly available.

1106.3331	the morphology of galaxies in the baryon oscillation spectroscopic  survey	we study the morphology of luminous and massive galaxies at 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.7targeted in the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) using publiclyavailable hubble space telescope imaging from cosmos. our sample (240 objects)provides a unique opportunity to check the visual morphology of these galaxieswhich were targeted based solely on stellar population modelling. we find thatthe majority (74+/-6%) possess an early-type morphology (elliptical or s0),while the remainder have a late-type morphology. this is as expected from thegoals of the boss target selection which aimed to predominantly select slowlyevolving galaxies, for use as cosmological probes, while still obtaining a fairfraction of actively star forming galaxies for galaxy evolution studies. weshow that a colour cut of (g-i)&gt;2.35 selects a sub-sample of boss galaxies with90% early-type morphology - more comparable to the earlier luminous red galaxy(lrg) samples of sdss-i/ii. the remaining 10% of galaxies above this cut have alate-type morphology and may be analogous to the "passive spirals" found atlower redshift. we find that 23+/-4% of the early-type galaxies are unresolvedmultiple systems in the sdss imaging. we estimate that at least 50% of theseare real associations (not projection effects) and may represent a significant"dry merger" fraction. we study the sdss pipeline sizes of boss galaxies whichwe find to be systematically larger (by 40%) than those measured from hstimages, and provide a statistical correction for the difference. these detailsof the boss galaxies will help users of the data fine-tune their selectioncriteria, dependent on their science applications. for example, the main goalof boss is to measure the cosmic distance scale and expansion rate of theuniverse to percent-level precision - a point where systematic effects due tothe details of target selection may become important.

1108.1392	mass growth and mergers: direct observations of the luminosity function  of lrg satellite galaxies out to z=0.7 from sdss and boss images	we present a statistical study of the luminosity functions of galaxiessurrounding luminous red galaxies (lrgs) at average redshifts &lt;z&gt;=0.34 and&lt;z&gt;=0.65. the luminosity functions are derived by extracting source photometryaround more than 40,000 lrgs and subtracting foreground and backgroundcontamination using randomly selected control fields. we show that at bothstudied redshifts the average luminosity functions of the lrgs and theirsatellite galaxies are poorly fitted by a schechter function due to aluminosity gap between the centrals and their most luminous satellites. weutilize a two-component fit of a schechter function plus a log-normaldistribution to demonstrate that lrgs are typically brighter than their mostluminous satellite by roughly 1.3 magnitudes. this luminosity gap implies thatinteractions within lrg environments are typically restricted to minor mergerswith mass ratios of 1:4 or lower. the luminosity functions further imply thatroughly 35% of the mass in the environment is locked in the lrg itself,supporting the idea that mass growth through major mergers within theenvironment is unlikely. lastly, we show that the luminosity gap may be atleast partially explained by the selection of lrgs as the gap can be reproducedby sparsely sampling a schechter function. in that case lrgs may represent onlya small fraction of central galaxies in similar mass halos.

1108.4719	evolution of the most massive galaxies to z=0.6: i. a new method for  physical parameter estimation	we use principal component analysis (pca) to estimate stellar masses, meanstellar ages, star formation histories (sfhs), dust extinctions and stellarvelocity dispersions for ~290,000 galaxies with stellar masses greater than$10^{11}msun and redshifts in the range 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.7 from the baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss). we find the fraction of galaxies with active starformation first declines with increasing stellar mass, but then flattens abovea stellar mass of 10^{11.5}msun at z~0.6. this is in striking contrast toz~0.1, where the fraction of galaxies with active star formation declinesmonotonically with stellar mass. at stellar masses of 10^{12}msun, therefore,the evolution in the fraction of star-forming galaxies from z~0.6 to thepresent-day reaches a factor of ~10. when we stack the spectra of the mostmassive, star-forming galaxies at z~0.6, we find that half of their [oiii]emission is produced by agns. the black holes in these galaxies are accretingon average at ~0.01 the eddington rate. to obtain these results, we use thestellar population synthesis models of bruzual &amp; charlot (2003) to generate alibrary of model spectra with a broad range of sfhs, metallicities, dustextinctions and stellar velocity dispersions. the pca is run on this library toidentify its principal components over the rest-frame wavelength range3700-5500a. we demonstrate that linear combinations of these components canrecover information equivalent to traditional spectral indices such as the4000a break strength and hda, with greatly improved s/n. this method is able torecover physical parameters such as stellar mass-to-light ratio, mean stellarage, velocity dispersion and dust extinction from the relatively low s/n bossspectra. we examine the sensitivity of our stellar mass estimates to the inputparameters in our model library and the different stellar population synthesismodels.

1109.6678	evolution of the velocity-dispersion function of luminous red galaxies:  a hierarchical bayesian measurement	we present a hierarchical bayesian determination of the velocity-dispersionfunction of approximately 430,000 massive luminous red galaxies(lrgs) observedat relatively low spectroscopic signal-to-noise ratio (snr ~3-5 per 69 kms^(-1)) by the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) of the sloandigital sky survey iii (sdss-iii). we marginalize over spectroscopic redshifterrors, and use the full velocity-dispersion likelihood function for eachgalaxy to make a self-consistent determination of the velocity-dispersiondistribution parameters as a function of absolute magnitude and redshift,correcting as well for the effects of broadband magnitude errors on ourbinning. parameterizing the distribution at each point in theluminosity-redshift plane with a log-normal form, we detect significantevolution in the width of the distribution toward higher intrinsic scatter athigher redshifts. using a subset of deep re-observations of boss galaxies, wedemonstrate that our distribution-parameter estimates are unbiased regardlessof spectroscopic snr. we also show through simulation that our methodintroduces no systematic parameter bias with redshift. we highlight theadvantage of the hierarchical bayesian method over frequentist "stacking" ofspectra, and illustrate how our measured distribution parameters can be adoptedas informative priors for velocity-dispersion measurements from individualnoisy spectra.

1209.2482	testing models of intrinsic brightness variations in type ia supernovae,  and their impact on measuring cosmological parameters	for spectroscopically confirmed type ia supernovae we evaluate models ofintrinsic brightness variations with detailed data/monte carlo comparisons ofthe dispersion in the following quantities: hubble-diagram scatter, colordifference (b-v-c) between the true b-v color and the fitted color (c) from thesalt-ii light curve model, and photometric redshift residual. the data sampleincludes 251 ugriz light curves from the 3-season sloan digital sky survey-ii,and 191 griz light curves from the supernova legacy survey 3-year data release.we find that the simplest model of a wavelength-independent (coherent) scatteris not adequate, and that to describe the data the intrinsic scatter model musthave wavelength-dependent variations. we use monte carlo simulations to examinethe standard approach of adding a coherent scatter term in quadrature to thedistance-modulus uncertainty in order to bring the reduced chi2 to unity whenfitting a hubble diagram. if the light curve fits include model uncertaintieswith the correct wavelength dependence of the scatter, we find that the bias onthe dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ is negligible. however,incorrect model uncertainties can lead to a significant bias on the distancemoduli, with up to ~0.05 mag redshift-dependent variation. for the recent snls3cosmology results we estimate that this effect introduces an additionalsystematic uncertainty on $w$ of ~0.02, well below the total uncertainty.however, this uncertainty depends on the samples used, and thus this small$w$-uncertainty is not guaranteed in future cosmology results.

1303.4486	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: single-probe measurements and the strong power of  normalized growth rate on constraining dark energy	we present measurements of the anisotropic galaxy clustering from the datarelease 9 (dr9) cmass sample of the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss). we analyze the broad-range shape of the monopole and quadrupolecorrelation functions to obtain constraints, at the effective redshift z=0.57of the sample, on the hubble expansion rate h(z), the angular-diameter distanced_a(z), the normalized growth rate f(z)\sigma_8(z), the physical matter density\omega_m h^2, and the biased amplitude of matter fluctuation b\sigma_8(z). weobtain {h(0.57), d_a(0.57), f(0.57)\sigma_8(0.57), \omega_m h^2,b\sigma_8(0.57)} = {87.6_{-6.8}^{+6.7}, 1396\pm73, 0.126_{-0.010}^{+0.008},1.19\pm0.14, 0.428\pm0.066} and their covariance matrix as well. the parameterswhich are not well constrained by our of galaxy clustering analysis aremarginalized over with wide flat priors. since no priors from other data sets(i.e., cmb) are adopted and no dark energy models are assumed, our results fromboss cmass galaxy clustering alone may be combined with other data sets, i.e.cmb, sne, lensing or other galaxy clustering data to constrain the parametersof a given cosmological model. we show that the major power on constrainingdark energy from the anisotropic galaxy clustering signal, as compared to theangular-averaged one (monopole), arises from including the normalized growthrate f(z)\sigma_8(z). in the case of the wcdm cosmological model oursingle-probe cmass constraints, combined with cmb (wmap9+spt), yield a valuefor the dark energy equation of state parameter of w=-0.90\pm0.11. therefore,it is important to include f(z)\sigma_8(z) while investigating the nature ofdark energy with current and upcoming large-scale galaxy surveys.

1405.6724	the vertical metallicity gradient of the milky way disk: transitions in  [a/fe] populations	using g dwarfs from the sloan extension for galactic understanding andexploration (segue) survey, we have determined a vertical metallicity gradientover a large volume of the milky way's disk, and examined how this gradientvaries for different [a/fe] subsamples. this sample contains over 40,000 starswith low-resolution spectroscopy over 144 lines of sight. we employ the seguestellar parameter pipeline (sspp) to obtain estimates of effective temperature,surface gravity, [fe/h], and [a/fe] for each star and extract multiplevolume-complete subsamples of approximately 1000 stars each. based on thesurvey's consistent target-selection algorithm, we adjust each subsample todetermine an unbiased picture of the disk in [fe/h] and [a/fe]; consequently,each individual star represents the properties of many. the segue sample allowsus to constrain the vertical metallicity gradient for a large number of starsover a significant volume of the disk, between ~0.3 and 1.6 kpc from thegalactic plane, and examine the in situ structure, in contrast to previousanalyses which are more limited in scope. this work does not pre-suppose a diskstructure, whether composed of a single complex population or a distinct thinand thick disk component. the metallicity gradient is -0.243 +0.039 -0.053dex/kpc for the sample as a whole, which we compare to various literatureresults. each [a/fe] subsample dominates at a different range of heights abovethe plane of the galaxy, which is exhibited in the gradient found in the sampleas a whole. stars over a limited range in [a/fe] show little change in median[fe/h] with height. if we associate [a/fe] with age, our consistent verticalmetallicity gradients with [a/fe] suggest that stars formed in different epochsexhibit comparable vertical structure, implying similar star-formationprocesses and evolution.

0704.0655	exploring the variable sky with the sloan digital sky survey	we quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using acatalog based on multiple sdss imaging observations. the catalog covers sdssstripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the sdss ugrizsystem for 1.4 million unresolved sources. in each photometric bandpass wecompute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select andstudy variable sources. we find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighterthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the gand r bands. the majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (&lt;2)quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adoptedflux-limited sample. we find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method forfinding low-redshift quasars as is the uv excess color selection (at highgalactic latitudes). we analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness forquasars and find that is centered on zero. we find that about 1/4 of thevariable stars are rr lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the mainstellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. the distribution oflightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellarlocus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with algol-likebehavior). using over six hundred rr lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halosubstructure out to distances of 100 kpc. we extrapolate these results toexpected performance by the large synoptic survey telescope and estimate thatit will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 millionlow-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.

1504.04088	large-scale clustering of lyman-alpha emission intensity from sdss/boss	(abridged) we detect the large-scale structure of lya emission in theuniverse at redshifts z=2-3.5 by measuring the cross-correlation of lya surfacebrightness with quasars in sdss/boss. we use a million spectra targetingluminous red galaxies at z&lt;0.8, after subtracting a best fit model galaxyspectrum from each one, as an estimate of the high-redshift lya surfacebrightness. the quasar-lya emission cross-correlation we detect has a shapeconsistent with a lambdacdm model with omega_m =0.30^+0.10-0.07. the predictedamplitude of this cross-correlation is proportional to the product of the meanlya surface brightness, &lt;mu_alpha&gt;, the amplitude of mass fluctuations, and thequasar and lya emission bias factors. using known values, we infer&lt;mu_alpha&gt;(b_alpha/3) = (3.9 +/- 0.9) x 10^-21 erg/s cm^-2 a^-1 arcsec^-2,where b_alpha is the lya emission bias factor. if the dominant sources of lyaemission are star forming galaxies, we infer rho_sfr = (0.28 +/- 0.07)(3/b_alpha) /yr/mpc^3 at z=2-3.5. for b_alpha=3, this value is a factor of21-35 above previous estimates from individually detected lya emitters,although consistent with the total rho_sfr derived from dust-corrected,continuum uv surveys. 97% of the lya emission in the universe at theseredshifts is therefore undetected in previous surveys of lya emitters. ourmeasurement is much greater than seen from stacking analyses of faint halossurrounding previously detected lya emitters, but we speculate that it arisesfrom similar lya halos surrounding all luminous star-forming galaxies. we alsodetect redshift space anisotropy of the quasar-lya emission cross-correlation,finding evidence at the 3.0 sigma level that it is radially elongated,consistent with distortions caused by radiative-transfer effects (zheng et al.(2011)). our measurements represent the first application of the intensitymapping technique to optical observations.

1509.06443	cosmic web reconstruction through density ridges: catalogue	we construct a catalogue for filaments using a novel approach called scms(subspace constrained mean shift; ozertem &amp; erdogmus 2011; chen et al. 2015).scms is a gradient-based method that detects filaments through density ridges(smooth curves tracing high-density regions). a great advantage of scms is itsuncertainty measure, which allows an evaluation of the errors for the detectedfilaments. to detect filaments, we use data from the sloan digital sky survey,which consist of three galaxy samples: the nyu main galaxy sample (mgs), thelowz sample and the cmass sample. each of the three dataset covers differentredshift regions so that the combined sample allows detection of filaments upto z = 0.7. our filament catalogue consists of a sequence of two-dimensionalfilament maps at different redshifts that provide several useful statistics onthe evolution cosmic web. to construct the maps, we select spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxies within 0.050 &lt; z &lt; 0.700 and partition them into 130 bins.for each bin, we ignore the redshift, treating the galaxy observations as a 2-ddata and detect filaments using scms. the filament catalogue consists of 130individual 2-d filament maps, and each map comprises points on the detectedfilaments that describe the filamentary structures at a particular redshift. wealso apply our filament catalogue to investigate galaxy luminosity and itsrelation with distance to filament. using a volume-limited sample, we findstrong evidence (6.1$\sigma$ - 12.3$\sigma$) that galaxies close to filamentsare generally brighter than those at significant distance from filaments.

astro-ph;0111095	the ghost of sagittarius and lumps in the halo of the milky way	we identify new structures in the halo of the milky way galaxy frompositions, colors and magnitudes of five million stars detected in the sloandigital sky survey. most of these stars are within 1.26 degrees of thecelestial equator. we present color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) for stars in twopreviously discovered, tidally disrupted structures. the cmds and turnoffcolors are consistent with those of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy, as had beenpredicted. in one direction, we are even able to detect a clump of red stars,similar to that of the sagittarius dwarf, from stars spread across 110 squaredegrees of sky. focusing on stars with the colors of f turnoff objects, weidentify at least five additional overdensities of stars. four of these may bepieces of the same halo structure, which would cover a region of the sky atleast 40 degrees in diameter, at a distance of 11 kpc from the sun (18 kpc fromthe center of the galaxy). the turnoff is significantly bluer than that ofthick disk stars, and closer to the galactic plane than a power-law spheroid.we suggest two models to explain this new structure. one possibility is thatthis new structure could be a new dwarf satellite of the milky way, hidden inthe galactic plane, and in the process of being tidally disrupted. the otherpossibility is that it could be part of a disk-like distribution of stars whichis metal-poor, with a scale height of approximately 2 kpc and a scale length ofapproximately 10 kpc. the fifth overdensity, which is 20 kpc away, is somedistance from the sagittarius dwarf streamer orbit and is not associated withany known structure in the galactic plane. it is likely that there are manysmaller streams of stars in the galactic halo.

astro-ph;0204055	stellar masses and star formation histories for 10^5 galaxies from the  sloan digital sky survey	we develop a new method to constrain the star formation histories, dustattenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. it is based on two stellarabsorption line indices, the 4000 angstrom break strength and the balmerabsorption line index hdelta_a. together, these indices allow us to constrainthe mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed inbursts over the past few gyr. a comparison with broad band photometry thenyields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. we generate a largelibrary of monte carlo realizations of different star formation histories,including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. we usethis library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions,dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios fora sample of 122,208 galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey. thetypical 95% confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +-40%. we studyhow the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolutemagnitude, concentration index and photometric pass-band and how dustattenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000 angstrom breakstrength. we also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present universeis distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration,colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. we find that most of thestellar mass in the local universe resides in galaxies that have stellar masses\~5\times 10^10 m_sol, half light radii ~3 kpc, and half- light surface massdensities ~10^9 m_sol/kpc^2. the distribution of d(4000) is strongly bimodal,showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar populationsand galaxies with more recent star formation.

astro-ph;0205070	the dependence of star formation history and internal structure on  stellar mass for 10^5 low-redshift galaxies	we study the relations between stellar mass, star formation history, size andinternal structure for a complete sample of 122,808 galaxies drawn from thesloan digital sky survey. we show that low-redshift galaxies divide into twodistinct families at a stellar mass of 3 \times 10^10 m_sol. lower massgalaxies have young stellar populations, low surface mass densities and the lowconcentrations typical of disks. a significant fraction of the lowest massgalaxies in our sample have experienced recent starbursts. at given stellarmass, the sizes of low mass galaxies are log- normally distributed withdispersion sigma(ln r_50) \sim 0.5, in excellent agreement with the idea thatthey form with little angular momentum loss through cooling and condensation ina gravitationally dominant dark matter halo. their median stellar surface massdensity scales with stellar mass as mu* propto m_*^0.54, suggesting that thestellar mass of a disk galaxy is proprtional to the three halves power of itshalo mass. this suggests that the efficiency of the conversion of baryons intostars in low mass galaxies increases in propor- tion to halo mass, perhaps as aresult of supernova feedback processes. at stellar masses above 3 \times 10^10m_sol, there is a rapidly increasing frac- tion of galaxies with old stellarpopulations, high surface mass densities and high concentrations typical ofbulges. in this regime, the size distribution is log-normal, but its dispersiondecreases rapidly with increasing stellar mass and the median mass surfacedensity is approximately constant. this suggests that the star formationefficiency decreases in the highest mass halos, and that little star formationoccurs in massive galaxies once they have assembled.

astro-ph;0205490	the cluster mass function from early sdss data: cosmological  implications	the mass function of clusters of galaxies is determined from 400 deg^2 ofearly commissioning imaging data of the sloan digital sky survey; ~300 clustersin the redshift range z = 0.1 - 0.2 are used. clusters are selected using twoindependent selection methods: a matched filter and a red-sequence colormagnitude technique. the two methods yield consistent results. the cluster massfunction is compared with large-scale cosmological simulations. we find abest-fit cluster normalization relation of sigma_8*omega_m^0.6 = 0.33 +- 0.03(for 0.1 ~&lt; omega_m ~&lt; 0.4), or equivalently sigma_8 = (0.16/omega_m)^0.6. theamplitude of this relation is significantly lower than the previous canonicalvalue, implying that either omega_m is lower than previously expected (omega_m= 0.16 if sigma_8 = 1) or sigma_8 is lower than expected (sigma_8 = 0.7 ifomega_m = 0.3). the best-fit mass function parameters are omega_m = 0.19(+0.08,-0.07) and sigma_8 = 0.9 (+0.3,-0.2). high values of omega_m (&gt;= 0.4)and low sigma_8 (=&lt; 0.6) are excluded at &gt;~ 2 sigma.

astro-ph;0210193	galaxy star-formation as a function of environment in the early data  release of the sloan digital sky survey	(abridged) we present in this paper a detailed analysis of the effect ofenvironment on the star-formation activity of galaxies within the edr of thesdss. we have used the halpha emission line to derive the star-formation rate(sfr) for each galaxy within a volume-limited sample of 8598 galaxies with 0.05&lt; z &lt; 0.095 and m(r)&lt;= -20.45. we find that the sfr of galaxies is stronglycorrelated with the local (projected) galaxy density and thus we present herethe density-sfr relation that is analogous to the density-morphology relation.the effect of density on the sfr of galaxies is seen in three ways. first, theoverall distribution of sfrs is shifted to lower values in dense environmentscompared with the field population. second, the effect is most noticeable forthe strongly star-forming galaxies in the 75th percentile of the sfrdistribution. third, there is a ``break'' (or characteristic density) in thedensity-sfr relation at a local galaxy density of 1h-2 mpc-2. to understandthis break further, we have studied the sfr of galaxies as a function ofclustercentric radius from 17 clusters and groups objectively selected from thesdss edr data. the distribution of sfrs of cluster galaxies begins to change,compared with the field population, at a clustercentric radius of 3-4 virialradii, which is consistent with the characteristic break in density that weobserve in the density-sfr relation. our tests suggest that thedensity-morphology relation alone is unlikely to explain the density-sfrrelation we observe. taken all together, these works demonstrate that thedecrease in sfr of galaxies in dense environments is a universal phenomenonover a wide range in density (from 0.08 to 10h-2 mpc-2) and redshift (out to z= 0.5).

astro-ph;0305603	angular clustering with photometric redshifts in the sloan digital sky  survey: bimodality in the clustering properties of galaxies	understanding the clustering of galaxies has long been a goal of modernobservational cosmology. utilizing our photometric redshift technique a volumelimited sample containing more than 2 million galaxies is constructed from thesdss galaxy catalog. in the largest such analysis to date, we study the angularclustering as a function of luminosity and spectral type. using limber'sequation we calculate the clustering length for the full data set asr0=5.77+/-0.10 mpc/h. we find that r0 increases with luminosity by a factor of1.6 over the sampled luminosity range, in agreement with previous redshiftsurveys. we also find that both the clustering length and the slope of thecorrelation function depend on the galaxy type. in particular, by splitting thegalaxies in four groups by their rest-frame type we find a bimodal behavior intheir clustering properties. galaxies with spectral types similar to ellipticalgalaxies have a correlation length of 6.59 +/- 0.17 mpc/h and a slope of theangular correlation function of 0.96 +/- 0.05 while blue galaxies have aclustering length of 4.51 +/- 0.19 mpc/h and a slope of 0.68 +/- 0.09. the twointermediate color groups behave like their more extreme 'siblings', ratherthan showing a gradual transition in slope. we discuss these correlations inthe context of current cosmological models for structure formation.

astro-ph;0308178	the near-ir properties and continuum shapes of high redshift quasars  from the sloan digital sky survey	we present j-h-k' photometry for a sample of 45 high redshift quasars foundby the sloan digital sky survey. the sample was originally selected on thebasis of optical colors and spans a redshift range from 3.6 to 5.03. ourphotometry reflects the rest-frame  sed longward of ly alpha for all redshifts. the results show that the near-ircolors of high redshift quasars are quite uniform. we have modelled thecontinuum shape of the quasars (from just beyond ly alpha to ~4000 a) with apower law of the form f_nu \propto nu^alpha, and find &lt;alpha &gt; =-0.57 with ascatter of 0.33. this value is similar to what is found for lower redshiftquasars over the same restframe wavelength range, and we conclude that there ishardly any evolution in the continuum properties of optically selected quasarsup to redshift 5. the spectral indices found by combining near-ir with opticalphotometry are in general consistent but slightly flatter than what is foundfor the same quasars using the optical spectra and photometry alone, showingthat the continuum region used to determine the spectral indices can somewhatinfluence the results.

(2003) (paper i). monte carlo simulations and resampling show thatthe results are robust to distance and velocity errors at least as large as theestimated errors from paper i. the best-fit velocities of the sun (circular)and halo (rotational) are 245.9 +/- 13.5 km/s and 23.8 +/- 20.1 km/s but arestrongly covariant, so that v_0 - v_halo = 222.1 +/- 7.7 km/s. if one adoptsstandard values for the local standard of rest and solar motion, then the haloscarcely rotates. the velocity ellipsoid inferred for our sample is much moreisotropic [(sigma_r,sigma_theta,sigma_phi) = (101.4 +/- 2.8, 97.7 +/- 16.4,107.4 +/- 16.6) km/s] than that of halo stars in the solar neighborhood, inagreement with a recent study of the distant halo by sommer-larsen et al.(1997). the line-of-sight velocity distribution of the entire sample, correctedfor the sun's motion, is accurately gaussian with a dispersion of 101.6 +/- 3.0km/s.

astro-ph;0312519	the h alpha luminosity function of morphologically classified galaxies  in the sloan digital sky survey	we present a study of the h$\alpha$ line emission from a sample of 1482optically-selected, morphologically-classified bright galaxies (median redshiftof 0.05) derived from the sloan digital sky survey. the luminosity function iscalculated for each morphological class and for the total sample. theluminosity function fitted with the schechter form gives a slope$\alpha=-1.43\pm 0.10$ for the total sample and the h$\alpha$ luminositydensity is $10^{39.31\pm 0.04{+0.10\atop-0.07}}h$ erg s$^{-1}$mpc$^{-3}$, wherethe first error is statistical and the second is systematic. this value isconsistent with that derived by gallego et al. (1995), but this agreement iscaused by a fortuitous cancellation of their neglect of stellar absorption thataffects the estimate of extinction corrections and a significant sampleincompleteness of emission line galaxies. the fraction of h$\alpha$ emittersmonotonically increases from early (a few % for ellipticals) to late types(100% for irregular galaxies), whereas strong emitters exist in all classes ofmorphological types. we find that 83% of the luminosity density comes fromspiral galaxies, 5% from irregular galaxies, and 9% from early type galaxies; asmall number of morphologically disturbed galaxies contribute by 3%.

astro-ph;0402030	the environmental dependence of the relations between stellar mass,  structure, star formation and nuclear activity in galaxies	we use a complete sample of galaxies drawn from the sdss to study howstructure, star formation and nuclear activity depend on local density and onstellar mass. local density is estimated by counting galaxies above a fixedabsolute magnitude limit within cylinders 2 mpc in projected radius and +-500km/s in depth. the stellar mass distribution of galaxies shifts by nearly afactor of two towards higher masses between low and high density regions. atfixed stellar mass, both star formation and nuclear activity depend strongly onlocal density, while structural parameters such as size and concentration arealmost independent of it. the galaxy property most sensitive to environment isspecific star formation rate. for galaxies with stellar masses less than 3 x10^10 m_sun, the median sfr/m* decreases by more than a factor of 10 from lowto high densities. this decrease is less marked for massive galaxies. at fixedstellar mass, twice as many galaxies host agn with strong [oiii] emission inlow density regions as in high. massive galaxies in low-density environmentsalso contain more dust. we have analyzed correlations between spectroscopicindicators that probe sfh on different timescales (d4000, hdelta_a and sfr/m*).the correlations do not depend on environment, suggesting that the decrease instar formation has ocurred over long (&gt;1 gyr) timescales. since structure doesnot depend on environment for more massive galaxies, trends in recent sfh, dustand agn for these systems cannot be driven by processes that alter structure,e.g. mergers. the sfh-density correlation is strongest for small scale (&lt; 1mpc) estimates of local density. finally, we highlight a striking similaritybetween changes in the galaxy population as a function of density and as afunction of redshift and we interpret this using n-body simulations.

astro-ph;0506194	fourier phase analysis of sdss galaxies	we present a first analysis of the clustering of sdss galaxies using thedistribution function of the sum of fourier phases. this statistic was recentlyproposed by one of authors as a new method to probe phase correlations ofcosmological density fields. since the fourier phases are statisticallyindependent of fourier amplitudes, the phase statistic plays a complementaryrole to the conventional two-point statistics of galaxy clustering. inparticular, we focus on the distribution functions of phase sum over threeclosed wavevectors as a function of the configurations of triangle wavevectors.we find that the observed distribution functions of phase sum are in goodagreement with the lowest-order approximation from perturbation theory. fordirect comparison with observations, we construct mock catalogs from n-bodysimulations taking account of several observational effects such as the surveygeometry, the redshift distortion, and the discreteness due to the limitednumber of data. indeed the observed phase correlations for the galaxies in therange of absolute magnitude -22&lt;mr&lt;-18 agree well with those for lambda cdmpredictions with sigma8=0.9 evolved from gaussian initial condition. thisagreement implies that the galaxy biasing is approximately linear in redshiftspace. instead, assuming that the galaxy biasing is described by a quadraticdeterministic function at scale larger than 30mpc/h, we can constrain the ratioof the quadratic biasing parameter b2 to the linear biasing parameter b1. wefind that resulting b2/b1 is mainly dependent on sigma8 and that it is wellfitted by b2/b1=0.54(+-0.06)-0.62(+-0.08)sigma8 in cdm models. indeed, b2/b1 isnearly zero when sigma8=0.9.

astro-ph;0510371	first measurement of the clustering evolution of  photometrically-classified quasars	we present new measurements of the quasar autocorrelation from a sample of\~80,000 photometrically-classified quasars taken from sdss dr1. we find abest-fit model of $\omega(\theta) =(0.066\pm^{0.026}_{0.024})\theta^{-(0.98\pm0.15)}$ for the angularautocorrelation, consistent with estimates from spectroscopic quasar surveys.we show that only models with little or no evolution in the clustering ofquasars in comoving coordinates since z~1.4 can recover a scale-lengthconsistent with local galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agns). a model withlittle evolution of quasar clustering in comoving coordinates is best explainedin the current cosmological paradigm by rapid evolution in quasar bias. we showthat quasar biasing must have changed from b_q~3 at a (photometric) redshift ofz=2.2 to b_q~1.2-1.3 by z=0.75. such a rapid increase with redshift in biasingimplies that quasars at z~2 cannot be the progenitors of modern l* objects,rather they must now reside in dense environments, such as clusters. similarly,the duration of the uvx quasar phase must be short enough to explain why localuvx quasars reside in essentially unbiased structures. our estimates of b_q arein good agreement with recent spectroscopic results, which demonstrate theimplied evolution in b_q is consistent with quasars inhabiting halos of similarmass at every redshift. treating quasar clustering as a function of bothredshift and luminosity, we find no evidence for luminosity dependence inquasar clustering, and that redshift evolution thus affects quasar clusteringmore than changes in quasars' luminosity. we provide a new method forquantifying stellar contamination in photometrically-classified quasar catalogsvia the correlation function.

astro-ph;0510405	gas infall and stochastic star formation in galaxies in the local  universe	we study the recent star formation histories of local galaxies by analyzingthe scatter in their colours and spectral properties. we present evidence thatthe distribution of star formation histories changes qualitatively above acharacteristic stellar surface mass density of 3x10^8 m_sol kpc^-2,corresponding to the transition between disk-dominated and bulge-dominatedgalaxies. when we average over subpopulations of galaxies with densities belowthis value, we find that subpopulations of all masses form their stars at thesame average rate per unit stellar mass. however, the scatter in galaxy coloursand emission line strengths is larger for more compact galaxies of a givenmass. this suggests that star formation occurs in shorter, higher amplitudeevents in galaxies with smaller sizes. above the characteristic density, galaxygrowth through star formation shuts down. we propose that star formation eventsare triggered when cold gas is accreted onto a galaxy. we have used the newhigh resolution millennium simulation of structure formation in a concordancelcdm universe to quantify the incidence of these accretion events and we showthat the observational data are well fit by a model in which the consumptiontime of accreted gas decreases with the surface density of the galaxy as t_cons\propto mu*^-1. the dark matter halos hosting massive galaxies with highdensities are also expected to grow through accretion, but the observationsindicate that star formation in bulge- dominated galaxies is no longer coupledto the hierarchical build-up of their surrounding dark matter halos.

astro-ph;0512166	very small-scale clustering and merger rate of luminous red galaxies	we present the small-scale (0.01&lt;r&lt;8 h^{-1} mpc) projected correlationfunction w_p(r_p) and real space correlation function xi(r) of 24520 luminousearly-type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey luminous red galaxy (lrg)sample (0.16&lt;z&lt;0.36). ``fiber collision'' incompleteness of the sdssspectroscopic sample at scales smaller than 55 arcseconds prevents measurementsof the correlation function for lrgs on scales smaller than ~0.3 mpc by theusual methods. in this work, we cross-correlate the spectroscopic sample withthe imaging sample, with a weighting scheme to account for the collisions,extensively tested against mock catalogs. we correct for photometric biases inthe sdss imaging of close galaxy pairs. we find that the correlation functionxi(r) is surprisingly close to a r^{-2} power law over more than 4 orders ofmagnitude in separation r. this result is too steep at small scales to beexplained in current versions of the halo model for galaxy clustering. we inferan lrg-lrg merger rate of less than or similar to 0.6 gyr^{-1} gpc^{-3} forthis sample. this result suggests that the lrg-lrg mergers are not the mainmode of mass growth for lrgs at z&lt;0.36.

astro-ph;0601279	average extinction curves and relative abundances for qso absorption  line systems at 1 &lt;= z_abs &lt; 2	we have studied a sample of 809 mg ii absorption systems with 1.0 &lt; z_abs &lt;1.86 in the spectra of sdss qsos, with the aim of understanding the nature andabundance of the dust and the chemical abundances in the intervening absorbers.normalized, composite spectra were derived, for abundance measurements, for thefull sample and several sub-samples, chosen on the basis of the line strengthsand other absorber and qso properties. average extinction curves were obtainedfor the sub-samples by comparing their geometric mean spectra with those ofmatching samples of qsos without absorbers in their spectra. there is clearevidence for the presence of dust in the intervening absorbers. the 2175 afeature is not present in the extinction curves, for any of the sub-samples.the extinction curves are similar to the smc extinction curve with a rising uvextinction below 2200 a. the absorber rest frame colour excess, e(b-v), derivedfrom the extinction curves, depends on the absorber properties and ranges from&lt; 0.001 to 0.085 for various sub-samples. the column densities of several ionsdo not show such a correspondingly large variation. the depletion pattern issimilar to halo clouds in the galaxy. assuming an smc gas-to-dust ratio we finda trend of increasing abundance with decreasing extinction; systems with n_h i\~ 10^{20} cm^{-2} show solar abundance of zn. the large velocity spread ofstrong mg ii systems seems to be mimicked by weak lines of other elements. theionization of the absorbers, in general appears to be low. qsos with absorbersare, in general, at least three times as likely to have highly reddened spectraas compared to qsos without any absorption systems in their spectra.

astro-ph;0602442	chandra observations of the highest redshift quasars from the sloan  digital sky survey	we present new chandra observations of 21 z&gt;4 quasars, including 11 sourcesat z&gt;5. these observations double the number of x-ray detected quasars at z&gt;5,allowing investigation of the x-ray spectral properties of a substantial sampleof quasars at the dawn of the modern universe. by jointly fitting the spectraof 15 z&gt;5 radio-quiet quasars (rqqs), including sources from the chandraarchive, with a total of 185 photons, we find a mean x-ray power-law photonindex of gamma=1.95^{+0.30}_{-0.26}, and a mean neutral intrinsic absorptioncolumn density of n_h&lt;~6x10^{22} cm^{-2}. these results show that quasar x-rayspectral properties have not evolved up to the highest observable redshifts. wealso find that the mean optical-x-ray spectral slope (alpha_ox) ofoptically-selected z&gt;5 rqqs, excluding broad absorption line quasars, isalpha_ox=-1.69+/-0.03, which is consistent with the value predicted from theobserved relationship between alpha_ox and ultraviolet luminosity. four of thesources in our sample are members of the rare class of weak emission-linequasars, and we detect two of them in x-rays. we discuss the implications ourx-ray observations have for the nature of these mysterious sources and, inparticular, whether their weak-line spectra are a consequence of continuumboosting or a deficit of high-ionization line emitting gas.

astro-ph;0603742	quasars probing quasars i: optically thick absorbers near luminous  quasars	with close pairs of quasars at different redshifts, a background quasarsightline can be used to study a foreground quasar's environment in absorption.we search 149 moderate resolution background quasar spectra, from gemini, keck,the mmt, and the sdss to survey lyman limit systems (llss) and damped ly-alphasystems (dlas) in the vicinity of 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 4.0 luminous foreground quasars. asample of 27 new quasar-absorber pairs is uncovered with column densities, 17.2&lt; log (n_hi/cm^2) &lt; 20.9, and transverse (proper) distances of 22 kpc/h &lt; r &lt;1.7 mpc/h, from the foreground quasars. if they emit isotropically, the impliedionizing photon fluxes are a factor of ~ 5-8000 times larger than the ambientextragalactic uv background over this range of distances. the observedprobability of intercepting an absorber is very high for small separations: sixout of eight projected sightlines with transverse separations r &lt; 150 kpc/hhave an absorber coincident with the foreground quasar, of which four have logn_hi &gt; 10^19. the covering factor of log n_hi &gt; 10^19 absorbers is thus ~ 50 %(4/8) on these small scales, whereas &lt; 2% would have been expected at random.there are many cosmological applications of these new sightlines: they providelaboratories for studying fluorescent ly-alpha recombination radiation fromllss, constrain the environments, emission geometry, and radiative histories ofquasars, and shed light on the physical nature of llss and dlas.

astro-ph;0605571	the sloan digital sky survey quasar lens search. i. candidate selection  algorithm	we present an algorithm for selecting an uniform sample of gravitationallylensed quasar candidates from low-redshift (0.6&lt;z&lt;2.2) quasars brighter thani=19.1 that have been spectroscopically identified in the sdss. our algorithmuses morphological and color selections that are intended to identify small-and large-separation lenses, respectively. our selection algorithm only relieson parameters that the sdss standard image processing pipeline generates,allowing easy and fast selection of lens candidates. the algorithm has beentested against simulated sdss images, which adopt distributions of field andquasar parameters taken from the real sdss data as input. furthermore, we takedifferential reddening into account. we find that our selection algorithm isalmost complete down to separations of 1'' and flux ratios of 10^-0.5. thealgorithm selects both double and quadruple lenses. at a separation of 2'',doubles and quads are selected with similar completeness, and above (below) 2''the selection of quads is better (worse) than for doubles. our morphologicalselection identifies a non-negligible fraction of single quasars: to removethese we fit images of candidates with a model of two point sources and rejectthose with unusually small image separations and/or large magnitude differencesbetween the two point sources. we estimate the efficiency of our selectionalgorithm to be at least 8% at image separations smaller than 2'', comparableto that of radio surveys. the efficiency declines as the image separationincreases, because of larger contamination from stars. we also present themagnification factor of lensed images as a function of the image separation,which is needed for accurate computation of magnification bias.

astro-ph;0608635	measuring the matter density using baryon oscillations in the sdss	we measure the cosmological matter density by observing the positions ofbaryon acoustic oscillations in the clustering of galaxies in the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss). we jointly analyse the main galaxies and lrgs in the sdssdr5 sample, using over half a million galaxies in total. the oscillations aredetected with 99.74% confidence (3.0sigma assuming gaussianity) compared to asmooth power spectrum. when combined with the observed scale of the peakswithin the cmb, we find a best-fit value of omega_m=0.256+0.029-0.024 (68%confidence interval), for a flat lambda cosmology when marginalising over thehubble parameter and the baryon density. this value of the matter density isderived from the locations of the baryon oscillations in the galaxy powerspectrum and in the cmb, and does not include any information from the overallshape of the power spectra. this is an extremely clean cosmological measurementas the physics of the baryon acoustic oscillation production is wellunderstood, and the positions of the oscillations are expected to beindependent of systematics such as galaxy bias.

astro-ph;0608636	the shape of the sdss dr5 galaxy power spectrum	we present a fourier analysis of the clustering of galaxies in the combinedmain galaxy and luminous red galaxy (lrg) sloan digital sky survey (sdss) datarelease 5 (dr5) sample. the aim of our analysis is to consider how well we canmeasure the cosmological matter density using the signature of the horizon atmatter-radiation equality embedded in the large-scale power spectrum. the newdata constrains the power spectrum on scales 100--600h^-1mpc with significantlyhigher precision than previous analyses of just the sdss main galaxies, due toour larger sample and the inclusion of the lrgs. this improvement means that wecan now reveal a discrepancy between the shape of the measured power and linearcdm models on scales 0.01&lt;k&lt;0.15hmpc^-1, with linear model fits favouring alower matter density (omega_m=0.22+/-0.04) on scales 0.01&lt;k&lt;0.06hmpc^-1 and ahigher matter density (omega_m=0.32+/-0.01) when smaller scales are included,assuming a flat lcdm model with h=0.73 and n_s=0.96. this discrepancy could beexplained by scale-dependent bias and, by analysing subsamples of galaxies, wefind that the ratio of small-scale to large-scale power increases with galaxyluminosity, so all of the sdss galaxies cannot trace the same power spectrumshape over 0.01&lt;k&lt;0.2hmpc^-1. however, the data are insufficient to clearlyshow a luminosity-dependent change in the largest scale at which a significantincrease in clustering is observed, although they do not rule out such aneffect. significant scale-dependent galaxy bias on large-scales, which changeswith the r-band luminosity of the galaxies, could potentially explaindifferences in our omega_m estimates and differences previously observedbetween 2dfgrs and sdss power spectra and the resulting parameter constraints.
