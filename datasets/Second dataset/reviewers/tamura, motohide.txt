0901.0564	an infrared census of star formation in the horsehead nebula	at ~ 400 pc, the horsehead nebula (b33) is the closest radiatively-sculptedpillar to the sun, but the state and extent of star formation in this structureis not well understood. we present deep near-infrared (irsf/sirius jhks) andmid-infrared (spitzer/irac) observations of the horsehead nebula in order tocharacterize the star forming properties of this region and to assess thelikelihood of triggered star formation. infrared color-color andcolor-magnitude diagrams are used to identify young stars based on infraredexcess emission and positions to the right of the zero-age main sequence,respectively. of the 45 sources detected at both near- and mid-infraredwavelengths, three bona fide and five candidate young stars are identified inthis 7' by 7' region. two bona fide young stars have flat infrared seds and arelocated at the western irradiated tip of the pillar. the spatial coincidence ofthe protostars at the leading edge of this elephant trunk is consistent withthe radiation-driven implosion (rdi) model of triggered star formation. thereis no evidence, however, for sequential star formation within the immediate ~1.5' (0.17 pc) region from the cloud/h ii region interface.

0902.3095	interstellar extinction law toward the galactic center iii: j, h, ks  bands in the 2mass and the mko systems, and 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0 micron in the  spitzer/irac system	we have determined interstellar extinction law toward the galactic center(gc) at the wavelength from 1.2 to 8.0 micron, using point sources detected inthe irsf/sirius near-infrared survey and those in the 2mass andspitzer/irac/glimpse ii catalogs. the central region |l| &lt; 3deg and |b| &lt; 1deghas been surveyed in the j, h and ks bands with the irsf telescope and thesirius camera whose filters are similar to the mauna kea observatories (mko)near-infrared photometric system. combined with the glimpse ii point sourcecatalog, we made ks versus (ks - lambda) color-magnitude diagrams where lambda= 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron. the ks magnitudes of bulge red clump stars andthe (ks - lambda) colors of red giant branches are used as a tracer of thereddening vector in the color-magnitude diagrams. from these magnitudes andcolors, we have obtained the ratios of total to selective extinctiona(ks)/e(ks-lambda) for the four irac bands. combined with a(lambda)/a(ks) forthe j and h bands derived by nishiyama et al., we obtaina(j):a(h):a(ks):a([3.6]):a([4.5]):a([5.8]):a([8.0])=3.02:1.73:1:0.50:0.39:0.36:0.43for the line of sight toward the gc. this confirms the flattening of theextinction curve at lambda &gt; 3 micron from a simple extrapolation of thepower-law extinction at shorter wavelengths, in accordance with recent studies.the extinction law in the 2mass jhks bands has also been calculated, and a goodagreement with that in the mko system is found. in nearby molecular clouds anddiffuse interstellar medium, the lack of reliable measurements of the total toselective extinction ratios hampers unambiguous determination of the extinctionlaw; however, observational results toward these lines of sight cannot bereconciled with a single extinction law.

0907.2761	a near-infrared survey of miras and the distance to the galactic centre	we report the results of a near-infrared survey for long-period variables ina field of view of 20 arcmin by 30 arcmin towards the galactic centre (gc). wehave detected 1364 variables, of which 348 are identified with those reportedin glass et al. (2001). we present a catalogue and photometric measurements forthe detected variables and discuss their nature. we also establish a method forthe simultaneous estimation of distances and extinctions using theperiod-luminosity relations for the jhks bands. our method is applicable tomiras with periods in the range 100--350 d and mean magnitudes available in twoor more filter bands. while j-band means are often unavailable for our objectsbecause of the large extinction, we estimated distances and extinctions for 143miras whose h- and ks-band mean magnitudes are obtained. we find that most arelocated at the same distance to within our accuracy. assuming that thebarycentre of these miras corresponds to the gc, we estimate its distancemodulus to be 14.58+-0.02(stat.)+-0.11(syst.) mag, corresponding to8.24+-0.08(stat.)+-0.42(syst.) kpc. we have assumed the distance modulus to thelmc to be 18.45 mag, and the uncertainty in this quantity is included in thesystematic error above. we also discuss the large and highly variableextinction. its value ranges from 1.5 mag to larger than 4 mag in a(ks) excepttowards the thicker dark nebulae and it varies in a complicated way with theline of sight. we have identified mid-infrared counterparts in the spitzer/iraccatalogue of ramirez et al. (2008) for most of our variables and find that theyfollow rather narrow period-luminosity relations in the 3.6 to 8.0 micrometrewavelength range.

0911.2049	magnetic field structure of the hh 1-2 region: near-infrared polarimetry  of point-like sources	the hh 1-2 region in the l1641 molecular cloud was observed in the near-ir j,h, and ks bands, and imaging polarimetry was performed. seventy six point-likesources were detected in all three bands. the near-ir polarizations of thesesources seem to be caused mostly by the dichroic extinction. using acolor-color diagram, reddened sources with little infrared excess were selectedto trace the magnetic field structure of the molecular cloud. the meanpolarization position angle of these sources is about 111 deg, which isinterpreted as the projected direction of the magnetic field in the observedregion of the cloud. the distribution of the polarization angle has adispersion of about 11 deg, which is smaller than what was measured in previousstudies. this small dispersion gives a rough estimate of the strength of themagnetic field to be about 130 microg and suggests that the global magneticfield in this region is quite regular and straight. in contrast, the outflowsdriven by young stellar objects in this region seem to have no preferredorientation. this discrepancy suggests that the magnetic field in the l1641molecular cloud does not dictate the orientation of the protostars forminginside.

1001.0762	mid-infrared photometry of cold brown dwarfs: diversity in age, mass and  metallicity	we present spitzer irac photometry of twelve very late-type t dwarfs; ninehave [3.6], [4.5], [5.8] and [8.0] photometry and three have [3.6] and [4.5]photometry only. we investigate trends with type and color for the planning andinterpretation of surveys for the coldest t or y dwarfs. brown dwarfs witheffective temperature (t_eff) below 700k emit more than half their flux atwavelengths beyond 3um, and the ratio of the mid-infrared flux to thenear-infrared flux becomes very sensitive to t_eff. the color h-[4.5] is a goodindicator of t_eff with a relatively weak dependence on metallicity andgravity. conversely, the colors h-k and [4.5]-[5.8] are sensitive tometallicity and gravity. thus near- and mid-infrared photometry provide usefulindicators of the fundamental properties of brown dwarfs, and if temperatureand gravity are known, then mass and age can be determined from evolutionarymodels. there are twelve dwarfs known with h-[4.5]&gt;3.0, and 500&lt; t_eff k &lt; 800,which we examine in detail. the ages of these dwarfs range from very young(0.1-1.0 gyr) to relatively old (3-12 gyr). the mass range is possibly as lowas 5 jupiter masses to up to 70 jupiter masses. the metallicities also span alarge range, from [m/h] -0.3 to [m/h] +0.3. the small number of t8-t9 dwarfsfound in the ukirt infrared deep sky survey to date appear to be mostly younglow-mass dwarfs. extensions to the mid-infrared space missions warm-spitzer andwise are desirable in order to obtain the vital mid-infrared data for coldbrown dwarfs, and to discover more of these rare objects.

1002.2462	high resolution observations of dust continuum emission at 340 ghz from  the low-mass t tauri star fn tauri	fn tau is a rare example of very low-mass t tauri stars that exhibits aspatially resolved nebulosity in near-infrared scattering light. to directlyderive the parameters of a circumstellar disk around fn tau, observations ofdust continuum emission at 340 ghz are carried out with the submillimeter array(sma). a point-like dust continuum emission was detected with a synthesizedbeam of ~ 0.7" in fwhm. from the analysis of the visibility plot, the radius ofthe emission is estimated to be &lt;= 0.29", corresponding to 41 au. this is muchsmaller than the radius of the nebulosity, 1.85" for its brighter part at 1.6micron. the 340 ghz continuum emission observed with the sma and thephotometric data at lambda &lt;= 70 micron are explained by a power-law disk modelwhose outer radius and mass are 41 au and (0.24 - 5.9) x 10^{-3} m_{sun},respectively, if the exponent of dust mass opacity (beta) is assumed to be 0-2.the disk model cannot fully reproduce the flux density at 230 ghz obtained withthe iram 30-meter telescope, suggesting that there is another extended "halo"component that is missed in the sma observations. by requiring the halo not tobe detected with the sma, the lower limit to the size of the halo is evaluatedto be between 174 au and 574 au, depending on the assumed beta value. thephysical nature of the halo is unclear, but it may be the periphery of a flaredcircumstellar disk that is not described well in terms of a power-law diskmodel, or a remnant of a protostellar envelope having flattened structure.

1004.0317	the discovery of a very cool, very nearby brown dwarf in the galactic  plane	we report the discovery of a very cool, isolated brown dwarf, ugps 0722-05,with the ukidss galactic plane survey. the near-infrared spectrum displaysdeeper h2o and ch4 troughs than the coolest known t dwarfs and an unidentifiedabsorption feature at 1.275 um. we provisionally classify the object as a t10dwarf but note that it may in future come to be regarded as the first exampleof a new spectral type. the distance is measured by trigonometric parallax asd=4.1{-0.5}{+0.6} pc, making it the closest known isolated brown dwarf. withthe aid of spitzer/irac we measure h-[4.5] = 4.71. it is the coolest browndwarf presently known -- the only known t dwarf that is redder in h-[4.5] isthe peculiar t7.5 dwarf sdss j1416+13b, which is thought to be warmer and moreluminous than ugps 0722-05. our measurement of the luminosity, aided bygemini/t-recs n band photometry, is l = 9.2 +/- 3.1x10^{-7} lsun. using acomparison with well studied t8.5 and t9 dwarfs we deduce teff=520 +/- 40 k.this is supported by predictions of the saumon &amp; marley models. with apparentmagnitude j=16.52, ugps 0722-05 is the brightest t dwarf discovered by ukidssso far. it offers opportunities for future study via high resolutionnear-infrared spectroscopy and spectroscopy in the thermal infrared.

1004.3409	near-infrared imaging polarimetry of the serpens cloud core: magnetic  field structure, outflows, and inflows in a cluster forming clump	we made deep nir imaging polarimetry toward the serpens cloud core. thepolarization vector maps enable us to newly detect 24 small ir reflectionnebulae with ysos. polarization measurements of nir point sources indicate anhourglass-shaped magnetic field, of which symmetry axis is nearly perpendicularto the elongation of the c18o (j=1-0) or submillimeter continuum emission. thebright part of c18o (j=1-0), submillimeter continuum cores as well as manyclass 0/i objects are located just toward the constriction region of thehourglass-shaped magnetic field. applying the cf method, the magnetic fieldstrength was estimated to be ~100 mug, suggesting that the ambient region ofthe serpens cloud core is moderately magnetically supercritical. these suggestthat the serpens cloud core first contracted along the magnetic field to be anelongated cloud, which is perpendicular to the magnetic field, and that thenthe central part contracted cross the magnetic field due to the high density inthe central region of the cloud core, where star formation is activelycontinuing. comparison of this magnetic field with the previous observations ofmolecular gas and large-scale outflows suggests a possibility that the clouddynamics is controlled by the magnetic field, protostellar outflows andgravitational inflows. this appears to be in good agreement with theoutflow-driven turbulence model and implies the importance of the magneticfield to continuous star formation in the center region of the cluster formingregion.

1009.5769	measurements of transit timing variations for wasp-5b	we have observed 7 new transits of the `hot jupiter' wasp-5b using a 61 cmtelescope located in new zealand, in order to search for transit timingvariations (ttvs) which can be induced by additional bodies existing in thesystem. when combined with other available photometric and radial velocity (rv)data, we find that its transit timings do not match a linear ephemeris; thebest fit \chi^2 values is 32.2 with 9 degrees of freedom which corresponds to aconfidence level of 99.982 % or 3.7 \sigma. this result indicates that excessvariations of transit timings has been observed, due either to unknownsystematic effects or possibly to real ttvs. the ttv amplitude is as large as50 s, and if this is real, it cannot be explained by other effects than thatdue to an additional body or bodies. from the rv data, we put an upper limit onthe rv amplitude caused by the possible secondary body (planet) as 21 m s^{-1},which corresponds to its mass of 22-70 m_{earth} over the orbital period ratioof the two planets from 0.2 to 5.0. from the ttvs data, using the numericalsimulations, we place more stringent limits down to 2 m_{earth} near 1:2 and2:1 mean motion resonances (mmrs) with wasp-5b at the 3 \sigma level, assumingthat the two planets are co-planer. we also put an upper limit on excess oftrojan mass as 43 m_{earth} (3 \sigma) using both rv and photometric data. wealso find that if the possible secondary planet has non- or a smalleccentricity, its orbit would likely be near low-order mmrs. further follow-upphotometric and spectroscopic observations will be required to confirm thereality of the ttv signal, and results such as these will provide importantinformation for the migration mechanisms of planetary systems.

1206.0558	can ground-based telescopes detect the oxygen 1.27 micron absorption  feature as a biomarker in exoplanets ?	the oxygen absorption line imprinted in the scattered light from theearth-like planets has been considered the most promising metabolic biomarkerof the exo-life. we examine the feasibility of the detection of the 1.27 micronoxygen band from habitable exoplanets, in particular, around late- type starsobserved with a future instrument on a 30 m class ground-based telescope. weanalyzed the night airglow around 1.27 micron with ircs/echelle spectrometer onsubaru and found that the strong telluric emission from atmospheric oxygenmolecules declines by an order of magnitude by midnight. by compiling nearbystar catalogs combined with the sky background model, we estimate thedetectability of the oxygen absorption band from an earth twin, if it exists,around nearby stars. we find that the most dominant source of photon noise forthe oxygen 1.27 micron band detection comes from the night airglow if thecontribution of the stellar psf halo is suppressed enough to detect the planet.we conclude that the future detectors for which the detection contrast islimited by photon noise can detect the oxygen 1.27 micron absorption band ofthe earth twins for ~50 candidates of the late type star. this paperdemonstrates the importance of deploying small inner working angle efficientcoronagraph and extreme adaptive optics on extremely large telescopes, andclearly shows that doing so will enable study of potentially habitable planets.

0711.2304	a technique for detecting starlight scattered from transiting extrasolar  planets with application to hd 209458b	we present a new technique for detecting scattered starlight from transiting,close-orbiting extrasolar giant planets (cegps) that has the virtues ofsimplicity, robustness, linearity, and model-independence. given a series ofstellar spectra obtained over various phases of the planetary orbit, the goalis to measure the strength of the component scattered by the planet relative tothe component coming directly from the star. we use two complementarystrategies, both of which rely on the predictable doppler shifts of bothcomponents and on combining the results from many spectral lines and manyexposures. in the first strategy, we identify segments of the stellar spectrumthat are free of direct absorption lines and add them after doppler-shiftinginto the planetary frame. in the second strategy, we compare the distributionof equivalent-width ratios of the scattered and direct components. bothstrategies are calibrated with a ``null test'' in which scrambled dopplershifts are applied to the spectral segments. as an illustrative test case, weapply our technique to spectra of hd 209458 taken when the planet was nearopposition (with orbital phases ranging from 11 to 34$\arcdeg$, where0$\arcdeg$ is at opposition), finding that the planet-to-star flux ratio is$(1.4 \pm 2.9)\times10^{-4}$ in the wavelength range 554$-$681 nm. thiscorresponds to a geometric albedo of $0.8 \pm 1.6$, assuming the phase functionof a lambert sphere. although the result is not statistically significant, theachieved sensitivity and relatively small volume of data upon which it is basedare very encouraging for future ground-based spectroscopic studies of scatteredlight from transiting cegp systems.

1303.0456	the efficiency and wavelength dependence of near-infrared interstellar  polarization toward the galactic center	near-infrared polarimetric imaging observations toward the galactic centerhave been carried out to examine the efficiency and wavelength dependence ofinterstellar polarization. a total area of about 5.7 deg$^2$ is covered in the$j$, $h$, and $k_s$ bands. we examined the polarization efficiency, defined asthe ratio of degree of polarization to color excess. the interstellar mediumbetween the galactic center and us shows the polarization efficiency lower thanthat in the galactic disk by a factor of three. moreover we investigated thespatial variation of the polarization efficiency by comparing it with those ofcolor excess, degree of polarization, and position angle. the spatialvariations of color excess and degree of polarization depend on the galacticlatitude, while the polarization efficiency varies independently of thegalactic structure. position angles are nearly parallel to the galactic plane,indicating the longitudinal magnetic field configuration between the galacticcenter and us. the polarization efficiency anticorrelates with dispersions ofposition angles. the low polarization efficiency and its spatial variation canbe explained by the differences of the magnetic field directions along theline-of-sight. from the lower polarization efficiency, we suggest a higherstrength of a random component relative to a uniform component of the magneticfield between the galactic center and us. we also derived the ratios of degreeof polarization $p_h/p_j$ = 0.581 $\pm$ 0.004 and $p_{k_s}/p_h$ = 0.620 $\pm$0.002. the power law indices of the wavelength dependence of polarization are$\beta_{jh}$ = 2.08 $\pm$ 0.02 and $\beta_{hk_s}$ = 1.76 $\pm$ 0.01. thereforethe wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization exhibits flatteningtoward longer wavelengths in the range of 1.25$-$2.14 $\micron$. the flatteningwould be caused by aligned large-size dust grains.

1309.2559	a discovery of a candidate companion to a transiting system koi-94: a  direct imaging study for a possibility of a false positive	we report a discovery of a companion candidate around one of {\it kepler}objects of interest (kois), koi-94, and results of our quantitativeinvestigation of the possibility that planetary candidates around koi-94 arefalse positives. koi-94 has a planetary system in which four planetarydetections have been reported by {\it kepler}, suggesting that this system isintriguing to study the dynamical evolutions of planets. however, while two ofthose detections (koi-94.01 and 03) have been made robust by previousobservations, the others (koi-94.02 and 04) are marginal detections, for whichfuture confirmations with various techniques are required. we have conductedhigh-contrast direct imaging observations with subaru/hiciao in $h$ band anddetected a faint object located at a separation of $\sim0.6''$ from koi-94. theobject has a contrast of $\sim 1\times 10^{-3}$ in $h$ band, and corresponds toan m type star on the assumption that the object is at the same distance ofkoi-94. based on our analysis, koi-94.02 is likely to be a real planet becauseof its transit depth, while koi-94.04 can be a false positive due to thecompanion candidate. the success in detecting the companion candidate suggeststhat high-contrast direct imaging observations are important keys to examinefalse positives of kois. on the other hand, our transit light curve reanalyseslead to a better period estimate of koi-94.04 than that on the koi catalogueand show that the planetary candidate has the same limb darkening parametervalue as the other planetary candidates in the koi-94 system, suggesting thatkoi-94.04 is also a real planet in the system.

1409.8386	indications of m-dwarf deficits in the halo and thick disk of the galaxy	we compared the number of faint stars detected in deep survey fields with thecurrent stellar distribution model of the galaxy and found that the detectednumber in the h band is significantly smaller than the predicted number. thisindicates that m-dwarfs, the major component, are fewer in the halo and thethick disk. we used archived data of several surveys in both the north andsouth field of goods (great observatories origins deep survey), mods ingoods-n, and ers and candels in goods-s. the number density of m-dwarfs in thehalo has to be 20+/-13% relative to that in the solar vicinity, in order forthe detected number of stars fainter than 20.5 mag in the h band to match withthe predicted value from the model. in the thick disk, the number density ofm-dwarfs must be reduced (52+/-13%) or the scale height must be decreased (~600pc). alternatively, overall fractions of the halo and thick disks can besignificantly reduced to achieve the same effect, because our sample mainlyconsists of faint m-dwarfs. our results imply that the m-dwarf population inregions distant from the galactic plane is significantly smaller thanpreviously thought. we then discussed the implications this has on thesuitability of the model predictions for the prediction of non-companion faintstars in direct imaging extrasolar planet surveys by using the best-fit numberdensities.

1411.1813	near-ir imaging polarimetry toward a bright-rimmed cloud: magnetic field  in sfo 74	we have made near-infrared (jhks) imaging polarimetry of a bright-rimmedcloud (sfo 74). the polarization vector maps clearly show that the magneticfield in the layer just behind the bright rim is running along the rim, quitedifferent from its ambient magnetic field. the direction of the magnetic fieldjust behind the tip rim is almost perpendicular to that of the incident uvradiation, and the magnetic field configuration appears to be symmetric as awhole with respect to the cloud symmetry axis. we estimated the column andnumber densities in the two regions (just inside and far inside the tip rim),and then derived the magnetic field strength, applying the chandrasekhar-fermimethod. the estimated magnetic field strength just inside the tip rim, ~90 ug,is stronger than that far inside, ~30 ug. this suggests that the magnetic fieldstrength just inside the tip rim is enhanced by the uv radiation induced shock.the shock increases the density within the top layer around the tip, and thusincreases the strength of the magnetic field. the magnetic pressure seems to becomparable to the turbulent one just inside the tip rim, implying a significantcontribution of the magnetic field to the total internal pressure. themass-to-flux ratio was estimated to be close to the critical value just insidethe tip rim. we speculate that the flat-topped bright rim of sfo 74 could beformed by the magnetic field effect.

1510.01060	characterization of the k2-19 multiple-transiting planetary system via  high-dispersion spectroscopy, ao imaging, and transit timing variations	k2-19 (epic201505350) is an interesting planetary system in which twotransiting planets with radii ~ 7 $r_{earth}$ (inner planet b) and ~ 4$r_{earth}$ (outer planet c) have orbits that are nearly in a 3:2 mean-motionresonance. here, we present results of ground-based follow-up observations forthe k2-19 planetary system. we have performed high-dispersion spectroscopy andhigh-contrast adaptive-optics imaging of the host star with the hds and hiciaoon the subaru 8.2m telescope. we find that the host star is relatively old (&gt;8gyr) late g-type star ($t_{eff}$ ~ 5350 k, $m_s$ ~ 0.9 $m_{sun}$, and $r_{s}$ ~0.9 $r_{sun}$). we do not find any contaminating faint objects near the hoststar which could be responsible for (or dilute) the transit signals. we havealso conducted transit follow-up photometry for the inner planet with keplercamon the flwo 1.2m telescope, trappistcam on the trappist 0.6m telescope, andmuscat on the oao 1.88m telescope. we confirm the presence of transit-timingvariations, as previously reported by armstrong and coworkers. we model theobserved transit-timing variations of the inner planet using the synodicchopping formulae given by deck &amp; agol (2015). we find two statisticallyindistinguishable solutions for which the period ratios ($p_{c}/p_{b}$) arelocated slightly above and below the exact 3:2 commensurability. despite thedegeneracy, we derive the orbital period of the inner planet $p_b$ ~ 7.921 daysand the mass of the outer planet $m_c$ ~ 20 $m_{earth}$. additional transitphotometry (especially for the outer planet) as well as precise radial-velocitymeasurements would be helpful to break the degeneracy and to determine the massof the inner planet.

1510.06832	number density distribution of near-infrared sources on a sub-degree  scale in the galactic center: comparison with the fe xxv ka line at 6.7 kev	the stellar distribution derived from an $h$ and $k_{\mathrm s}$-band surveyof the central region of our galaxy is compared with the fe xxv k$\alpha$ (6.7kev) line intensity observed with the suzaku satellite. the survey is for thegalactic coordinates $|l| \lesssim 3^{\circ}.0$ and $|b| \lesssim 1^{\circ}.0$(equivalent to 0.8 kpc $\times$ 0.3 kpc for $r_0 = 8$ kpc), and thenumber-density distribution $n(k_{\mathrm s,0}; l, b)$ of stars is derivedusing the extinction-corrected magnitude $k_{\mathrm s,0}=10.5$. this is deepenough to probe the old red giant population and in turn to estimate the ($l$,$b$) distribution of faint x-ray point sources such as coronally activebinaries and cataclysmic variables. in the galactic plane ($b=0^{\circ}$),$n(10.5; l, b)$ increases to the galactic center as $|l|^{-0.30 \pm 0.03}$ inthe range of $-0^{\circ}.1 \geq l \geq -0^{\circ}.7$, but this increase issignificantly slower than the increase ($|l|^{-0.44 \pm 0.02}$ ) of the fe xxvk$\alpha$ line intensity. if normalized with the ratios in the outer region$1^{\circ}.5 \leq |l| \leq 2^{\circ}.8$, where faint x-ray point sources areargued to dominate the diffuse galactic x-ray ridge emission, the excess of thefe xxv k$\alpha$ line intensity over the stellar number density is at least afactor of two at $|l| = 0^{\circ}.1$. this indicates that a significant part ofthe galactic center diffuse emission arises from a truly diffuse optically-thinthermal plasma, and not from an unresolved collection of faint x-ray pointsources related to the old stellar population.

1512.00980	near-infrared polarization source catalog of the northeastern regions of  the large magellanic cloud	we present a near-infrared band-merged photometric and polarimetric catalogfor the 39$\arcmin$ $\times$ 69$\arcmin$ fields on the northeastern part of thelarge magellanic cloud (lmc), which were observed using sirpol, an imagingpolarimeter of the infrared survey facility (irsf). this catalog lists 1,858sources brighter than 14 mag at $h$ band with polarization signal-to-noiseratio greater than three in the $j$, $h$, or $k_s$ bands. based on therelationship between the extinction and the polarization degree, we argue thatthe polarization mostly arises from dichroic extinctions caused by localinterstellar dust in the lmc. this catalog allows us to map polarizationstructures to examine the global geometry of the local magnetic field, and toshow a statistical analysis of polarization of each field to understand itspolarization properties. at the selected fields with coherent polarizationposition angles, we estimate magnetic field strengths in the range of 3$-$25$\mu$g using the chandrasekhar-fermi method. this implies the presence oflarge-scale magnetic fields on a scale of around one hundred parsecs. whencomparing mid and far-infrared dust emission maps, we confirmed that thepolarization patterns are well aligned with molecular clouds around thestar-forming regions.

0807.1424	near-infrared imaging polarimetry of m42: aperture polarimetry of  point-like sources	we have conducted aperture polarimetry of ~500 stars of the orion nebulacluster (onc) in m42 based on our wide-field (~8'\times 8') $jhks$ bandpolarimetry.  most of the near-infrared (nir) polarizations are dichroic, with positionangles of polarization agreeing, both globally and locally, with previousfar-infrared (fir) and submillimeter observations, having taken into accountthe 90$^\circ $ difference in angles between dichroic absorption and emission.this is consistent with the idea that both nir dichroic polarizations andfir/submillimeter thermal polarizations trace the magnetic fields in the omc-1region. the magnetic fields inferred from these observations show a pinch atscales less than 0.5 pc with a centroid near irc2. the hourglass-shapedmagnetic field pattern is explained by the models in which the magnetic fieldlines are dragged along with the contracting gas and then wound up by rotationin a disk. the highly polarized region to the northwest of irc2 and thelow-polarized region near the bright bar are also common among nir andfir/submillimeter data, although a few regions of discrepancy exist.  we have also discerned ~50 possible highly polarized sources whosepolarizations are more likely to be intrinsic rather than dichroic. theirpolarization efficiencies ($p(h)/a(h)$) are too large to be explained by theinterstellar polarization. these include 10 young brown dwarfs that suggest ahigher polarization efficiency, which may present geometrical evidence for(unresolved) circumstellar structures around young brown dwarfs.

0808.3022	akari irc survey of the large magellanic cloud: outline of the survey  and initial results	we observed an area of 10 deg^2 of the large magellanic cloud using theinfrared camera on board akari. the observations were carried out using fiveimaging filters (3, 7, 11, 15, and 24 micron) and a dispersion prism (2 -- 5micron, $\lambda / \delta\lambda$ $\sim$ 20) equipped in the irc. this paperdescribes the outline of our survey project and presents some initial resultsusing the imaging data that detected over 5.9x10^5 near-infrared and 6.4x10^4mid-infrared point sources. the 10 $\sigma$ detection limits of our survey areabout 16.5, 14.0, 12.3, 10.8, and 9.2 in vega-magnitude at 3, 7, 11, 15, and 24micron, respectively. the 11 and 15 micron data, which are unique to akari irc,allow us to construct color-magnitude diagrams that are useful to identifystars with circumstellar dust. we found a new sequence in the color-magnitudediagram, which is attributed to red giants with luminosity fainter than that ofthe tip of the first red giant branch. we suggest that this sequence is likelyto be related to the broad emission feature of aluminium oxide at 11.5 micron.the 11 and 15 micron data also indicate that the ([11] - [15]) micron color ofboth oxygen-rich and carbon-rich red giants once becomes blue and then turnsred again in the course of their evolution, probably due to the change in theflux ratio of the silicate or silicon carbide emission feature at 10 or 11.3micron to the 15 micron flux.

astro-ph;0405387	high resolution imaging polarimetry of hl tau and magnetic field  structure	we present high quality near infrared imaging polarimetry of hl tau at 0.4 to0.6 arcsec resolution, obtained with subaru/ciao and ukirt/ircam. 3-d montecarlo modelling with aligned oblate grains is used to probe the structure ofthe circumstellar envelope and the magnetic field, as well as the dustproperties. at j band the source shows a centrosymmetric pattern dominated byscattered light. in the h and k bands the central source becomes visible andits polarisation appears to be dominated by dichroic extinction, with aposition angle inclined by ~40 degrees to the disc axis. the polarisationpattern of the environs on scales up to 200 au is consistent with the samedichroic extinction signature superimposed on the centrosymmetric scatteringpattern. these data can be modelled with a magnetic field which is twisted onscales from tens to hundreds of au, or alternatively by a field which isglobally misaligned with the disc axis. a unique solution to the fieldstructure will require spatially resolved circular polarisation data. the bestfit monte carlo model indicates a shallow near infrared extinction law. whencombined with the observed high polarisation and non-negligible albedo theseconstraints can be fitted with a grain model involving dirty water ice mantlesin which the largest particles have radii slightly in excess of 1 um. the bestfit model has an envelope structure which is slightly flattened on scales up toseveral hundred au. both lobes of the bipolar outflow cavity contain asubstantial optical depth of dust (not just within the cavity walls). curved,approximately parabolic, cavity walls fit the data better than a conicalcavity. the small inner accretion disc observed at millimetre wavelengths isnot seen at this spatial resolution.

astro-ph;0603414	possible molecular spiral arms in the protoplanetary disk of ab aur	the circumstellar dust disk of the herbig ae star ab aur has been found toexhibit complex spiral-like structures in the near-ir image obtained with thesubaru telescope. we present maps of the disk in both 12co (3-2) and dustcontinuum at 345 ghz with the sma at an angular resolution of 1.0"x0.7" (144aux 100au). the continuum emission traces a dust disk with a central depressionand a maximum overall dimension of 450au (fwhm). this dust disk exhibitsseveral distinct peaks that appear to coincide with bright features in thenear-ir image, in particular the brightest inner spiral arm. the co emissiontraces a rotating gas disk of size 530au x 330au with a deprojected maximumvelocity of 2.8km/s at 450au. in contrast to the dust disk, the gas diskexhibits an intensity peak at the stellar position. furthermore, the coemission in several velocity channels traces the innermost spiral arm seen inthe near-ir. we compare the observed spatial-kinematic structure of the coemission to a simple model of a disk in keplerian rotation, and find that onlythe emission tracing the main spiral arm clearly lies outside the confines ofour model. this emission has a net outward radial motion compared with theradial velocity predicted by the model at the location of the main spiral arms.the disk of ab aur is therefore quite different from the keplerian disks seenaround many herbig ae stars. the spiral-like structures of the disk withnon-keplerian motions we revealed in 12co (3-2), together with the centraldepression of the dust disk, may be explained to be driven by the possibleexistence of a giant planet forming in the disk.

astro-ph;0606397	telescope to observe planetary systems (tops): a high throughput 1.2-m  visible telescope with a small inner working angle	the telescope to observe planetary systems (tops) is a proposed space missionto image in the visible (0.4-0.9 micron) planetary systems of nearby starssimultaneously in 16 spectral bands (resolution r~20). for the ~10 mostfavorable stars, it will have the sensitivity to discover 2 r_e rocky planetswithin habitable zones and characterize their surfaces or atmospheres throughspectrophotometry. many more massive planets and debris discs will be imagedand characterized for the first time. with a 1.2m visible telescope, theproposed mission achieves its power by exploiting the most efficient and robustcoronagraphic and wavefront control techniques. the phase-induced amplitudeapodization (piaa) coronagraph used by tops allows planet detection at 2lambda/d with nearly 100% throughput and preserves the telescope angularresolution. an efficient focal plane wavefront sensing scheme accuratelymeasures wavefront aberrations which are fed back to the telescope activeprimary mirror. fine wavefront control is also performed independently in eachof 4 spectral channels, resulting in a system that is robust to wavefrontchromaticity.

astro-ph;0607408	the distance to the galactic center derived from infrared photometry of  bulge red clump stars	on the basis of the near infrared observations of bulge red clump stars nearthe galactic center, we have determined the galactocentric distance to be r_0 =7.52 +- 0.10 (stat) +- 0.35 (sys) kpc. we observed the red clump stars at |l| &lt;1.0 deg and 0.7 deg &lt; |b| &lt; 1.0 deg with the irsf 1.4 m telescope and thesirius camera in the h and ks bands. after extinction and populationcorrections, we obtained (m - m)_0 = 14.38 +- 0.03 (stat) +- 0.10 (sys). thestatistical error is dominated by the uncertainty of the intrinsic local redclump stars' luminosity. the systematic error is estimated to be +- 0.10including uncertainties in extinction and population correction, zero-point ofphotometry, and the fitting of the luminosity function of the red clump stars.our result, r_0 = 7.52 kpc, is in excellent agreement with the distancedetermined geometrically with the star orbiting the massive black hole in thegalactic center. the recent result based on the spatial distribution ofglobular clusters is also consistent with our result. in addition, our studyexhibits that the distance determination to the galactic center with the redclump stars, even if the error of the population correction is taken intoaccount, can achieve an uncertainty of about 5%, which is almost the same levelas that in recent geometrical determinations.

astro-ph;0612620	near-infrared extinction in the coalsack globule 2	we have conducted j, h, and ks imaging observations for the coalsack globule2 with the sirius infrared camera on the irsf 1.4 m telescope at saao, anddetermined the color excess ratio, e(j-h)/e(h-ks). the ratio is determined inthe same photometric system as our previous study for the rho oph and chaclouds without any color transformation; this enables us to directly comparethe near-infrared extinction laws among these regions. the current ratioe(j-h)/e(h-ks) = 1.91 +- 0.01 for the extinction range 0.5 &lt; e(j-h) &lt;1.8 issignificantly larger than the ratios for the rho oph and cha clouds(e(j-h)/e(h-ks) = 1.60-1.69). this ratio corresponds to a large negative indexalpha = 2.34 +- 0.01 when the wavelength dependence of extinction isapproximated by a power law which might indicate little growth of dust grains,or larger abundance of dielectric non-absorbing components such as silicates,or both in this cloud. we also confirm that the color excess ratio for thecoalsack globule 2 has a trend of increasing with decreasing optical depth,which is the same trend as the rho oph and cha clouds have.

astro-ph;0701552	near-infrared imaging polarimetry of the ngc 2071 star forming region  with sirpol	we have conducted deep jhks imaging polarimetry of a ~8' x 8' area of the ngc2071 star forming region. our polarization data have revealed various infraredreflection nebulae (irne) associated with the central ir young star clusterngc2071ir and identified their illuminating sources. there are at least 4 irnein ngc2071ir and several additional irne are identified around nearby youngstars in the same field-of-view. each illuminating source coincides with aknown near-ir source except for irs3, which is only a part of irn2 and isilluminated by the radio source 1c. aperture polarimetry of each cluster sourceis used to detect unresolved circumstellar disk/outflow systems. aperturepolarimetry of the other point-like sources within the field is made in thisregion for the first time. the magnetic field structures (from ~1 pc down to\~0.1 pc) are derived using both aperture polarimetry of the point-like sourcesand imaging polarimetry of the shocked h2 emission that is seen as the dominantknotty nebulae in the ks band image; they are both of dichroic origin and thederived field directions are consistent with each other. the magnetic fielddirection projected on the sky is also consistent with that inferred from the850 micron thermal continuum emission polarimetry of the central 0.2 pc region,but running roughly perpendicular (~75 degrees) to the direction of the largescale outflow. we argue that the field strength is too weak to align theoutflow in the large scale field direction via magnetic braking.

astro-ph;0702504	herbig ae/be stars in the magellanic bridge	we have found herbig ae/be star candidates in the western region of themagellanic bridge. using the near infrared camera sirius and the 1.4 mtelescope irsf, we surveyed about 3.0 deg x 1.3 deg (24 deg &lt; ra &lt; 36 deg, -75deg &lt; dec. &lt; -73.7 deg) in the j, h, and ks bands. on the basis of colors andmagnitudes, about 200 herbig ae/be star candidates are selected. consideringthe contaminations by miscellaneous sources such as foreground stars andearly-type dwarfs in the magellanic bridge, we estimate that about 80 (about40%) of the candidates are likely to be herbig ae/be stars. we also found oneconcentration of the candidates at the young star cluster ngc 796, stronglysuggesting the existence of pre-main-sequence (pms) stars in the magellanicbridge. this is the first detection of pms star candidates in the magellanicbridge, and if they are genuine pms stars, this could be direct evidence ofrecent star formation. however, the estimate of the number of herbig ae/bestars depends on the fraction of classical be stars, and thus a more precisedetermination of the be star fraction or observations to differentiate betweenthe herbig ae/be stars and classical be stars are required.

0809.3089	magnetic field configuration at the galactic center investigated by wide  field near-infrared polarimetry	we present a polarimetric map of a 20'x20' area toward the galactic center.the polarization of point sources has been measured in the j, h, and ks bandsusing the near-infrared polarimetric camera sirpol on the 1.4 m telescope irsf.one percent or better accuracy of polarization degree is achieved for sourceswith j&lt;14.5, h&lt;13.5, and ks&lt;12.0. comparing the stokes parameters between highextinction stars and relatively low extinction ones, we have obtained apolarization originating from magnetically aligned dust grains at the centralregion of our galaxy of at most 1-2 kpc. the distribution of the positionangles shows a peak at about 20 deg, nearly parallel to the galactic plane,suggesting a toroidal magnetic configuration. the derived direction of themagnetic field is in good agreement with that obtained fromfar-infrared/submillimeter observations, which detect polarized thermalemission from dust in the molecular clouds at the galactic center. our resultsshow that by subtracting foreground components, near-infrared polarimetryallows investigation of the magnetic field structure "at" the galactic center.

astro-ph;9903029	the stellar population of the m31 spiral arm around ob association a24	a study of the stellar population of the m31 spiral arm around ob associationa24 was carried out based on the photometric data obtained from deep v and jhkimaging. the luminosity function was obtained for -7 &lt;~ mbol &lt;~ -3.5 byapplying the extinction correction corresponding to av=1 and the bolometriccorrection bc(k) as an empirical function of (j-k)o. in comparing the observedcolor-luminosity diagrams with semitheoretical isochrones modified for thedust-shell effects, we found the young population of t &lt;~ 30 myr withsupergiants of mbol &lt;~ -5, the bulk of the intermediate-age population of t ~0.2 - 2.5 gyr with bright asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars of -5 &lt;~ mbol &lt;~-4, and old populations of t ~&gt; 3 gyr with agb and red giant branch (rgb) starsof mbol ~&gt; -4. the average star formation rate was estimated to be ~1.8x10^4m_o/myr and ~0.7x10^4 m_o/myr per deprojected disk area of 1 kpc^2 from thenumber density of b0 v stars around mv=-4.0 (age ~10 myr) and the numberdensity of bright agb stars around mbol = -4.3 (age ~1 gyr), respectively. astudy of the local variation in the v and the j and h luminosity functionsrevealed a kind of anticorrelation between the population of the youngcomponent and that of the intermediate-age component when subdomains of ~100 pcscales were concerned. this finding suggests that the disk domain around thea24 area experienced a series of star formation episodes alternatively amongdifferent subdomains with a timescale of a few spiral passage periods. briefdiscussions are given about the interstellar extinction and about the lifetimesof bright agb stars and the highly red objects (hros) in the same area.

0811.3438	near-infrared imaging polarimetry of s106 cluster-forming region with  sirpol	we present the results of wide-field jhks polarimetry toward the hii regions106 using the irsf (infrared survey facility) telescope. our polarimetry datarevealed an extended (up to ~ 5') polarized nebula over s106. we confirmed theposition of the illuminating source of most of the nebula as consistent withs106 irs4 through an analysis of polarization vectors. the bright portion ofthe polarized intensity is consistent with the red wing component of themolecular gas. diffuse polarized intensity emission is distributed along thenorth--south molecular gas lanes. we found the interaction region between theradiation from s106 irs4 and the dense gas. in addition, we also discovered twosmall polarization nebulae, sirn1 and sirn2, associated with a young stellarobjects (yso). aperture polarimetry of point-like sources in this region wascarried out for the first time. the regional magnetic field structures werederived using point-like source aperture polarimetry, and the magnetic fieldstructure position angle around the cluster region in s106 was found to be ~120$\arcdeg$. the magnetic fields in the cluster region, however, have threetype position angles: ~ 20$\arcdeg$, ~ 80$\arcdeg$, and ~ 120$\arcdeg$. thepresent magnetic field structures are consistent with results obtained bysubmillimeter continuum observations. we found that the magnetic fielddirection in the dense gas region is not consistent with that of the lowdensity gas region.
