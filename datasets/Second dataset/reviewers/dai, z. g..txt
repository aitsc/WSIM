0901.0431	hyperaccreting neutron-star disks and neutrino annihilation	newborn neutron stars surrounded by hyperaccreting and neutrino-cooled disksmay exist in some gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and/or supernovae (sne). in thispaper we further study the structure of such a neutron-star disk based on thetwo-region (i.e., inner &amp; outer) disk scenario following our previous work, andcalculate the neutrino annihilation luminosity from the disk in various cases.we investigate the effects of the viscosity parameter, energy parameter(measuring the neutrino cooling efficiency of the inner disk) and outflowstrength on the structure of the entire disk as well as the effect of emissionfrom the neutron star surface boundary emission on the total neutrinoannihilation rate. the inner disk satisfies the entropy-conservation or theadvection-dominated self-similar structure depending on the energy parameter.an outflow from the disk decreases the density and pressure but increases thethickness of the disk. moreover, compared with the black-hole disk, theneutrino annihilation luminosity above the neutron-star disk is higher, and theneutrino emission from the boundary layer could increase the neutrinoannihilation luminosity by about one order of magnitude higher than the diskwithout boundary emission. the neutron-star disk with the advection-dominatedinner disk could produce the highest neutrino luminosity while the disk with anoutflow has the lowest. although a heavily mass-loaded outflow from the neutronstar surface at early times of neutron star formation prevents the outflowmaterial from being accelerated to a high bulk lorentz factor, an energeticultrarelativistic jet via neutrino annihilation can be produced above thestellar polar region at late times if the disk accretion rate and the neutrinoemission luminosity from the surface boundary layer are sufficiently high.

0706.3741	observational signatures of high-energy emission during the shallow  decay phase of grb x-ray afterglows	the widely existing shallow decay phase of the x-ray afterglows of gamma-raybursts (grbs) is generally accepted to be due to long-lasting energy injection.the outflows carrying the injecting energy, based on the component that isdominative in energy, fall into two possible types: baryon-dominated andlepton-dominated ones. the former type of outflow could be ejecta that isejected during the prompt phase of a grb and consists of a series of baryonicshells with a distribution of lorentz factors, and the latter type could be anelectron-positron-pair wind that is driven by the post-burst central engine. wehere provide a unified description for the dynamics of fireballs based on thesetwo types of energy injection, and calculate the corresponding high-energyphoton emission by considering synchrotron radiation and inverse comptonscattering (including synchrotron self-compton and combined inverse-compton) ofelectrons. we find that, in the two energy-injection models, there is a plateau(even a hump) in high-energy light curves during the x-ray shallow decay phase.in particular, a considerable fraction of the injecting energy in thelepton-dominated model can be shared by the long-lasting reverse shock since itis relativistic. furthermore, almost all of the energy of the reverse shock iscarried by leptons, and thus the inverse-compton emission is enhanceddramatically. therefore, this model predicts more significant high-energyafterglow emission than the baryon-dominated model. we argue that theseobservational signatures would be used to discriminate between differentenergy-injection models in the upcoming {\em gamma-ray large area spacetelescope} (glast) era.

0911.5528	hyperaccreting disks around magnetars for gamma-ray bursts: effects of  strong magnetic fields	(abridged) the hyperaccreting neutron star or magnetar disks cooled vianeutrino emission can be a candidate of gamma-ray burst (grb) central engines.the strong field $\geq10^{15}-10^{16}$ g of the magnetar can play a significantrole in affecting the disk properties and even lead to the funnel accretionprocess. we investigate the effects of strong fields on the disks aroundmagnetars, and discuss implications of such accreting magnetar systems for grband grb-like events. we discuss quantum effects of the strong fields on thedisk, and use the mhd conservation equations to describe the behavior of thedisk flow coupled with a large scale field, which is generated by the star-diskinteraction. in general, stronger fields give higher disk densities, pressures,temperatures and neutrino luminosity, and change the electron fraction anddegeneracy state significantly. a magnetized disk is always viscously stableoutside the alfv\'{e}n radius, but will be thermally unstable near thealfv\'{e}n radius where the magnetic field plays a more important role intransferring the angular momentum and heating the disk than the viscous stress.the funnel accretion process will be only important for an extremely strongfield, which creates a magnetosphere inside the alfv\'{e}n radius and truncatesthe plane disk. because of higher temperature and more concentrated neutrinoemission of the magnetar surface ring-like belt region covered by funnelaccretion, the neutrino annihilation rate from the accreting magnetars can bemuch higher than that from accreting neutron stars without fields. furthermore,the neutrino annihilation mechanism and the magnetically-driven pulsar windfrom the magnetar surface can work together to generate and feed anultra-relativistic jet along the stellar magnetic poles.

0912.5140	high-redshift star formation rate up to z~8.3 derived from gamma-ray  bursts and influence of background cosmology	the high-redshift star formation rate (sfr) is difficult to measure directlyeven by modern approaches. long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) can bedetected to the edge of the visible universe because of their highluminorsities. the collapsar model of long gamma-ray bursts indicates that theymay trace the star formation history. so long gamma-ray bursts may be a usefultool of measuring the high-redshift sfr. observations show that long gamma-raybursts prefer to form in a low-metallicity environment. we study thehigh-redshift sfr up to z~8.3 considering the swift grbs tracing the starformation history and the cosmic metallicity evolution in different backgroundcosmological models including $\lambda$cdm, quintessence, quintessence with atime-varying equation of state, and brane-world model. we use latest swift grbsincluding two highest-$z$ grbs, grb 080913 at $z=6.7$ and grb 090423 at$z=8.3$. we find that the sfr at $z&gt;4$ shows a steep decay with a slope of$\sim -5.0$ in $\lambda$cdm. in the other three models, the high-redshift sfris slightly different from $\lambda$cdm model, and also shows a steep decay.

1008.4899	the termination shock of a magnetar wind: a possible origin of gamma-ray  burst x-ray afterglow emission	context: swift observations suggest that the x-ray afterglow emission of somegamma-ray bursts (grb) may have internal origins, and the conventional externalshock (es) cannot be the exclusive source of the afterglow emission. aims: ifthe central compact objects of some grbs are millisecond magentars, themagnetar winds could play an important role in the (internal) x-ray afterglowemission, which is our focus here. methods: the dynamics and the synchrotronradiation of the termination shock (ts) of the magmnetar winds, as well as thesimultaneous grb es, are investigated by considering the magnetization of thewinds. results: as a result of the competition between the emission of the windts and the grb es, two basic types of x-ray afterglows are predicted, i.e., thets-dominated and the es-dominated types. moreover, our results also show thatboth of the two types of afterglows have a shallow-decay phase and anormal-decay one, as observed by the \textit{swift} satellite. this indicatesthat some observed x-ray afterglows could be (internally) produced by themagnetar winds, but not necessarily grb ess.

0708.4062	constraining dark energy and cosmological transition redshift with type  ia supernovae	the property of dark energy and the physical reason for acceleration of thepresent universe are two of the most difficult problems in modern cosmology.the dark energy contributes about two-thirds of the critical density of thepresent universe from the observations of type-ia supernova (sne ia) andanisotropy of cosmic microwave background (cmb).the sn ia observations alsosuggest that the universe expanded from a deceleration to an acceleration phaseat some redshift, implying the existence of a nearly uniform component of darkenergy with negative pressure. we use the ``gold'' sample containing 157 sne iaand two recent well-measured additions, sne ia 1994ae and 1998aq to explore theproperties of dark energy and the transition redshift. for a flat universe withthe cosmological constant, we measure $\omega_{m}=0.28_{-0.05}^{+0.04}$, whichis consistent with riess et al. the transition redshift is$z_{t}=0.60_{-0.08}^{+0.06}$. we also discuss several dark energy models thatdefine the $w(z)$ of the parameterized equation of state of dark energyincluding one parameter and two parameters ($w(z)$ being the ratio of thepressure to energy density). our calculations show that the accuratelycalculated transition redshift varies from $z_{t}=0.29_{-0.06}^{+0.07}$ to$z_{t}=0.60_{-0.08}^{+0.06}$ across these models. we also calculate the minimumredshift $z_{c}$ at which the current observations need the universe toaccelerate.

1011.3103	multiband fitting to three long grbs with fermi/lat data: structured  ejecta sweeping up a density-jump medium	we present broadband (radio, optical, x-ray and gev) fits to the afterglowlight curves and spectra of three long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs 080916c,090902b, and 090926a) detected by the gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) and largearea telescope (lat) instruments on the fermi satellite. using the observedbroadband data, we study the origin of the high energy emission, and suggestthat the early-time gev emission and the late-time radio, optical, and x-rayafterglows can be understood as being due to synchrotron emission from anexternal forward shock caused by structured ejecta propagating in a wind bubblejumping to a homogeneous density medium. if the ceasing time for majority ofthe energy injection is assumed to be close to the deceleration time of theforward shock, the structured ejecta with continuous energy injection to theforward shock can well explain the early rising feature of the gev mission fromthese burst, and the density-jump medium can account for some certain plateausor flares in the late afterglows. from our fits, we find that, on one hand, theexternal shock origin of the gev photons will make the optical depth have notsignificant contribution to the early lat rising part, which will loosen strongconstraint of lower limits of lorentz factor. on the other hand, thesefermi-lat events preferentially occur in a low-density circumburst environment,in which case the klein-nishina cutoff will significantly suppress theself-synchrotron compton (ssc) radiation. such an environment might result fromsuperbubbles or low-metallicity progenitor stars (which have a low mass-lossrate at late times of stellar evolution) of type ib/c supernovae.

1105.0046	the updated luminosity correlations of gamma-ray bursts and cosmological  implications	several interesting luminosity correlations among gamma-ray burst (grb)variables have been recently discussed extensively. in this paper, we derivethe six luminosity correlations ($\tlag-l$, $v-l$, $\epkk-l$, $\epkk-e_\gamma$,$\trt-l$, $\epkk-e_{\gamma, \mathrm{iso}}$) from the light curves and spectraof the latest 116 long grbs, including the time lag ($\tlag$) between low andhigh photon energy light curves, the variability ($v$) of the light curve, thepeak energy of the spectrum ($\epkk$), and the minimum rise time ($\trt$) ofthe peaks. we find that the intrinsic scatter of the $v-l$ correlation is toolarge and there seems no inherent correlation between the two parameters usingthe latest grb data. the other five correlations indeed exist when the sampleis enlarged. the $\epkk-e_\gamma$ correlation has a significantly lowerintrinsic scatter compared to the other correlations. we divide the full datainto four redshift bins when testing possible evolution of the correlationswith redshift. we find no statistically significant evidence for the redshiftevolution of the luminosity correlations. to avoid the circularity problem whenconstraining the cosmological parameters, we simultaneously minimize $\chi^2$with respect to both correlation parameters $a$, $b$ and the cosmologicalparameters using the maximum likelihood method. for the flat $\lambda$cdm, thebest fit is $\omm=0.31^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$. we also constrain the possibleevolution of the equation of state (eos) of the dark energy using the grbstogether with the union2 compilation of sne ia and the $h(z)$ data. the resultis consistent with the cosmological constant at $2 \sigma$ confidence level andmainly due to the grb data, the dark energy eos shows slight deviation from -1at $z \geq0.5$ as was persistently presented with many previous data sets.

1112.4040	weak gravitational lensing effects on cosmological parameters and dark  energy from gamma-ray bursts	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are attractive objects for constraining the nature ofdark energy in a way complementary to other cosmological probes, especially athigh redshifts. however, the apparent magnitude of distant grbs can bedistorted by the gravitational lensing from the density fluctuations along theline of sight. we investigate the gravitational lensing effect on thecosmological parameters and dark energy equation of state from grbs. we firstcalibrated the grb luminosity relations without assuming any cosmologicalmodels. the luminosity distances of low-redshift grbs were calibrated with thecosmography method using a latest type ia supernova (sne ia) sample. we findthat the gravitational lensing has non-negligible effects on the determinationof cosmological parameters and dark energy. the gravitational lensing shiftsthe best-fit constraints on cosmological parameters and dark energy. becausehigh-redshift grbs are more likely to be reduced, the most probable value ofthe observed matter density $\omega_m$ is slightly lower than its actual value.in the $\lambda$cdm model, we find that the matter density parameter $\omega_m$will shift from 0.30 to 0.26 after including the gravitational lensing effect.the gravitational lensing also affects the dark energy equation of state byshifting it to a more negative value. we constrain the dark energy equation ofstate out to redshift $z\sim 8$ using grbs for the first time, and find thatthe equation of state deviates from $\lambda$cdm at the $1\sigma$ confidencelevel, but agrees with $w=-1$ at the $2\sigma$ confidence level.

1207.3879	probing pre-galactic metal enrichment with high-redshift gamma-ray  bursts	we explore high-redshift gamma-ray bursts (grbs) as promising tools to probepre-galactic metal enrichment. we utilize the bright afterglow of a pop iii grbexploding in a primordial dwarf galaxy as a luminous background source, andcalculate the strength of metal absorption lines that are imprinted by thefirst heavy elements in the intergalactic medium (igm). to derive the grbabsorption line diagnostics, we use an existing highly-resolved simulation ofthe formation of a first galaxy which is characterized by the onset of atomichydrogen cooling in a halo with virial temperature &gt;10^4 k. we explore theunusual circumburst environment inside the systems that hosted pop iii stars,modeling the density evolution with the self-similar solution for a champagneflow. for minihalos close to the cooling threshold, the circumburst density isroughly proportional to (1+z) with values of about a few cm^{-3}. in moremassive halos, corresponding to the first galaxies, the density may be larger,n&gt;100 cm^{-3}. the resulting afterglow fluxes may be detectable with the jwstand vla in the near-ir and radio wavebands, respectively, out to redshift z&gt;20.we predict that the maximum of the afterglow emission shifts from near-ir tomillimeter bands with peak fluxes from mjy to jy at different observed times.grbs are ideal tools for probing the metal enrichment in the early igm, due totheir high luminosities and featureless power-law spectra. the metals in thefirst galaxies produced by the first supernova (sn) explosions are likely toreside in low-ionization stages. we show that if the afterglow can be observedsufficiently early, analysis of the metal lines can distinguish whether thefirst heavy elements were produced in a pisn, or a core-collapse (type ii) sn,thus constraining the initial mass function of the first stars.

1209.2479	spin evolution of millisecond magnetars with hyperaccreting fallback  disks: implications for early afterglows of gamma-ray bursts	the shallow decay phase or plateau phase of early afterglows of gamma-raybursts (grbs), discovered by swift, is currently understood as being due toenergy injection to a relativistic blast wave. one natural scenario for energyinjection invokes a millisecond magnetar as the central engine of grbs, becausethe conventional model of a pulsar predicts a nearly constantmagnetic-dipole-radiation luminosity within the spin-down timescale. however,we note that significant brightening occurs in some early afterglows, whichapparently conflicts with the above scenario. here we propose a new model toexplain this significant brightening phenomena by considering a hyperaccretingfallback disk around a newborn millisecond magnetar. we show that for typicalvalues of the model parameters, sufficient angular momentum of the accretedmatter is transferred to the magnetar and spins it up. it is this spin-up thatleads to a dramatic increase of the magnetic dipole radiation luminosity withtime and thus significant brightening of an early afterglow. based on thismodel, we carry out numerical calculations and fit well early afterglows of 12grbs assuming sufficiently strong fallback accretion. if the accretion is veryweak, our model turns out to be the conventional energy-injection scenario of apulsar. therefore, our model can provide a unified explanation for the shallowdecay phase, plateaus, and significant brightening of early afterglows.

0712.0423	hyperaccretion disks around neutron stars	(abridged) we here study the structure of a hyperaccretion disk around aneutron star. we consider a steady-state hyperaccretion disk around a neutronstar, and as a reasonable approximation, divide the disk into two regions,which are called inner and outer disks. the outer disk is similar to that of ablack hole and the inner disk has a self-similar structure. in order to studyphysical properties of the entire disk clearly, we first adopt a simple model,in which some microphysical processes in the disk are simplified, followingpopham et al. and narayan et al. based on these simplifications, weanalytically and numerically investigate the size of the inner disk, theefficiency of neutrino cooling, and the radial distributions of the diskdensity, temperature and pressure. we see that, compared with the black-holedisk, the neutron star disk can cool more efficiently and produce a much higherneutrino luminosity. finally, we consider an elaborate model with more physicalconsiderations about the thermodynamics and microphysics in the neutron stardisk (as recently developed in studying the neutrino-cooled disk of a blackhole), and compare this elaborate model with our simple model. we find thatmost of the results from these two models are basically consistent with eachother.

1308.1253	self-organized criticality in x-ray flares of gamma-ray burst afterglows	x-ray flares detected in nearly half of gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows areone of the most intriguing phenomena in high-energy astrophysics. all theobservations indicate that the central engines of bursts, after the gamma-rayemission has ended, still have long periods of activity, during which energeticexplosions eject relativistic materials, leading to late-time x-ray emission.it is thus expected that x-ray flares provide important clues to the nature ofthe central engines of grbs, and more importantly, unveil the physicalmechanism of the flares themselves, which has so far remained mysterious. herewe report statistical results of x-ray flares of grbs with known redshifts, andshow that x-ray flares and solar flares share three statistical properties:power-law frequency distributions for energies, durations, and waiting times.all of the distributions can be well understood within the physical frameworkof a self-organized criticality (soc) system. the statistical properties ofx-ray flares of grbs are similar to solar flares, and thus can both beattributed to a soc process. both types of flares may be driven by a magneticreconnection process, but x-ray flares of grbs are produced in ultra-stronglymagnetized millisecond pulsars or long-term hyperaccreting disks aroundstellar-mass black holes.

1402.6545	the origin of the plateau and late rebrightening in the afterglow of grb  120326a	grb 120326a is an unusual gamma-ray burst (grb) which has a quite longplateau and a very late rebrightening both in x-ray and optical bands. thesimilar behavior of the optical and x-ray light curves suggests that they maybehave a common origin. the long plateau starts from several hundred seconds andends at tens of thousands seconds. the peak time of the late rebrightening isabout 30000 s. we analyze the energy injection model by means of numerical andanalytical solutions, considering both the wind environment and ism environmentfor grb afterglows. we especially study the influence of the injection startingtime, ending time, stellar wind density (or density of the circumburstenvironment), and injection luminosity on the shape of the afterglow lightcurves, respectively. we find that the light curve is largely affected by theparameters in the wind model. there is a "bump" at the late time only in thewind model too. in the wind case, it is interesting that the longer the energyinjected, the more obvious the rebrightening will be. we also find the peaktime of bump is determined by the stellar wind density. we use the latecontinuous injection model to interpret the unusual afterglow of grb 120326a.the model can well fit the observational data, however, we find that the timescale of the injection must be larger than ten thousands seconds. this impliesthat the time scale of the central engine activity must be more than tenthousands seconds. this can give useful constraints on the central engine ofgrbs. we consider a new born millisecond pulsar with strong magnetic field asthe central engine. on the other hand, our results suggest that the circumburstenvironment of grb 120326a is very likely a stellar wind.

1406.2792	neutrino emission in jet propagation process	relativistic jets are universal in long-duration gamma-ray burst (grb)models. before breaking out, they must propagate in the progenitor envelopealong with a forward shock and a reverse shock forming at the jet head. bothelectrons and protons will be accelerated by the shocks. high energy neutrinoscould be produced by these protons interacting with stellar materials andelectron-radiating photons. the jet will probably be collimated, which may havea strong effect on the final neutrino flux. under the assumption of a power-lawstellar-envelope density profile $\rho \propto r^{-\alpha}$ with an index$\alpha$, we calculate this neutrino emission flux by these shocks forlow-luminosity grbs (ll-grbs) and ultra-long grbs (ul-grbs) in differentcollimation regimes, using the jet propagation framework developed by\citet{bro11}. we find that ll-grbs and ul-grbs are capable for detectable highenergy neutrinos up to $\sim {\rm pev}$, and obtain the final neutrinospectrum. besides, we conclude that larger $\alpha$ corresponds to greaterneutrino flux at high energy end ($\sim {\rm pev}$) and higher maximum neutrinoenergy as well. however, such differences are so small that it is not promisingfor us to distinguish from observations, given the energy resolution we havenow.

1504.01812	an unexpectedly low-redshift excess of swift gamma-ray burst rate	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are the most violent explosions in the universe andcan be used to explore the properties of high-redshift universe. it is believedthat the long grbs are associated with the deaths of massive stars. so it ispossible to use grbs to investigate the star formation rate (sfr). in thispaper, we use lynden-bell's $c^-$ method to study the luminosity function andrate of \emph{swift} long grbs without any assumptions. we find that theluminosity of grbs evolves with redshift as $l(z)\propto g(z)=(1+z)^k$ with$k=2.43_{-0.38}^{+0.41}$. after correcting the redshift evolution through$l_0(z)=l(z)/g(z)$, the luminosity function can be expressed as$\psi(l_0)\propto l_0^{-0.14\pm0.02}$ for dim grbs and $\psi(l_0)\proptol_0^{-0.70\pm0.03}$ for bright grbs, with the break point$l_{0}^{b}=1.43\times10^{51}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$. we also find that the formationrate of grbs is almost constant at $z&lt;1.0$ for the first time, which isremarkably different from the sfr. at $z&gt;1.0$, the formation rate of grb isconsistent with the sfr. our results are dramatically different from previousstudies. some possible reasons for this low-redshift excess are discussed. wealso test the robustness of our results with monte carlo simulations. thedistributions of mock data (i.e., luminosity-redshift distribution, luminosityfunction, cumulative distribution and $\log n-\log s$ distribution) are in goodagreement with the observations. besides, we also find that there areremarkable difference between the mock data and the observations if long grbare unbiased tracers of sfr at $z&lt;1.0$.

0805.3254	self-similar structure of magnetized adafs and cdafs	(abridged) we study the effects of a global magnetic field onviscously-rotating and vertically-integrated accretion disks around compactobjects using a self-similar treatment. we extend akizuki &amp; fukue's work (2006)by discussing a general magnetic field with three components ($r, \phi, z$) inadvection-dominated accretion flows (adafs). we also investigate the effects ofa global magnetic field on flows with convection. for these purposes, we firstadopt a simple form of the kinematic viscosity $\nu=\alphac_{s}^{2}/\omega_{k}$ to study magnetized adafs. then we consider a morerealistic model of the kinematic viscosity $\nu=\alpha c_{s}h$, which makes theinfall velocity increase but the sound speed and toroidal velocity decrease. wenext use two methods to study magnetized flows with convection, i.e., we takethe convective coefficient $\alpha_{c}$ as a free parameter to discuss theeffects of convection for simplicity. we establish the $\alpha_{c}-\alpha$relation for magnetized flows using the mixing-length theory and compare thisrelation with the non-magnetized case. if $\alpha_{c}$ is set as a freeparameter, then $|v_{r}|$ and $c_{s}$ increase for a large toroidal magneticfield, while $|v_{r}|$ decreases but $|v_{\phi}|$ increases (or decreases) fora strong and dominated radial (or vertical) magnetic field with increasing$\alpha_{c}$. in addition, the magnetic field makes the $\alpha_{c}-\alpha$relation be distinct from that of non-magnetized flows, and allows the$\rho\propto r^{-1}$ or $\rho\propto r^{-2}$ structure for magnetizednon-accreting convection-dominated accretion flows with $\alpha+g\alpha_{c}&lt; 0$(where $g$ is the parameter to determine the condition of convective angularmomentum transport).

astro-ph;0002430	neutrino afterglows and progenitors of gamma-ray bursts	currently popular models for progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are themergers of compact objects and the explosions of massive stars. these two caseshave distinctive environments for grbs: compact object mergers occur in theinterstellar medium (ism) and the explosions of massive stars occur in thepreburst stellar wind. we here discuss neutrino afterglows from reverse shocksas a result of the interaction of relativistic fireballs with their surroundingwind matter. after comparing with the analytical result of waxman &amp; bahcall(2000) for the homogeneous ism case, we find that the differential spectrum ofneutrinos with energy from $\sim 3\times 10^{15}$ to $\sim 3\times 10^{17}$ evin the wind case is softer by one power of the energy than in the ism case.furthermore, the expected flux of upward moving muons produced by neutrinointeractions below a detector on the surface of the earth in the wind case is$\sim 5$ events per year per km$^2$, which is about one order of magnitudelarger than in the ism case. in addition, these properties are independent ofwhether the fireballs are isotropic or beamed. therefore, neutrino afterglows,if detected, may provide a way of distinguishing between grb progenitor modelsbased on the differential spectra of neutrinos and their event rates in adetector.

astro-ph;0005417	could the unusual optical afterglow of grb 000301c arise from a  non-relativistic shock with energy injection?	recent observations on the grb 000301c afterglow show that three breaksappear in the r-band light curve, and in particular the decay slope at latetimes is as steep as -3.0. this unusual afterglow is clearly inconsistent withthe standard afterglow shock model. here we propose a non-standard model forthe unusual r-band afterglow of grb 000301c. in this model, anultra-relativistic shock in a dense medium ("dirty environment")rapidly evolvedto the non-relativistic phase in initial 1 day. during such a phase, the shockhappened to be caught up with by two energetic shells ejected from the centralengine at two different times, and the shock was refreshed, leading to twoflattenings of the light curve. after each interaction between the shock andshell, the afterglow decayed as $\propto t^{-3.0}$ if the electron distributionindex of the shocked medium, $p\approx 3.4$, derived from the optical spectrum.therefore, this model can provide an excellent explanation for the flatteningand steepening features of the grb 000301c optical afterglow light curve. wefurther point out that the energy injection shells ejected from the centralengine at later times may be material shells (e.g., in the massive starprogenitor models related to black holes) or radiation shells (e.g., in themillisecond pulsar progenitor models).

astro-ph;0005549	on the optical light curves of afterglows from jetted gamma-ray burst  ejecta: effects of parameters	due to some refinements in the dynamics, we can follow the overall evolutionof a realistic jet numerically till its bulk velocity being as small as $\betac \sim 10^{-3} c$. we find no obvious break in the optical light curve duringthe relativistic phase itself. however, an obvious break does exist at thetransition from the relativistic phase to the non-relativistic phase, whichtypically occurs at time $t \sim 10^6$ --- $10^{6.5}$ s (i.e., 10 --- 30 d).the break is affected by many parameters, such as the electron energy fraction$\xi_{\rm e}$, the magnetic energy fraction $\xi_{\rm b}^2$, the initial halfopening angle $\theta_0$, and the medium number density $n$. increase of any ofthem to a large enough value will make the break disappear. although the breakitself is parameter-dependent, afterglows from jetted grb remnants areuniformly characterized by a quick decay during the non-relativistic phase,with power law timing index $\alpha \geq 2.1$. this is quite different fromthat of isotropic fireballs, and may be of fundamental importance fordetermining the degree of beaming in $\gamma$-ray bursts observationally.

astro-ph;0008304	effects of environment and energy injection on gamma-ray burst  afterglows	there is growing evidence that some long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) arise fromthe core collapse of massive stars, and thus it is inevitable that theenvironments of these grbs are preburst stellar winds or dense media. westudied, for the first time, the wind model for afterglows based on theblandford-mckee self-similar solution of a relativistic shock, and suggestedthat grb 970616 is an interactor with a stellar wind. we also proposed a densemedium model for some afterglows, e.g., the steepening in the light curve ofthe r-band afterglow of grb 990123 may be caused by the adiabatic shock whichhas evolved from an ultrarelativistic phase to a nonrelativistic phase in adense medium. we further discussed the dense medium model in more details, andinvestigated the effects of synchrotron self absorption and energy injection. ashock in a dense medium becomes nonrelativistic rapidly after a shortrelativistic phase. the afterglow from the shock at the nonrelativistic stagedecays more rapidly than at the relativistic stage. since some models for grbenergy sources predicted that a strongly magnetic millisecond pulsar may beborn during grb formation, we discussed the effect of such a pulsar on theevolution of the nonrelativistic shock through magnetic dipole radiation. wefound that in the pulsar energy injection case, the dense medium model fitsvery well all the observational data of grb 980519. recently, we combined thedense medium model with the pulsar energy injection effect to provide a goodfit to the optical afterglow data of grb 000301c.

astro-ph;0010244	gamma-ray burst afterglows from jetted shocks in wind environments	gamma-ray bursts with long durations are widely thought to arise from thecollapse of massive stars, where the wind environment is unavoidable. it isalso believed that $\gamma$-ray bursts come from jets. considering these twopoints in this paper, we calculate the evolution of a highly collimated jetthat expands in a stellar wind environment and the expected afterglow from sucha jet. we use a set of refined dynamical equations and a realistic lateralspeed of the jet, and find: (1) there is no observable break at the time whenthe lorentz factor of the jet is equal to the inverse of its initialhalf-opening angle. (2) no obvious break appears at the time when the blastwave transits from the relativistic to the non-relativistic phase. (3) for thewind case, there is no flattening tendency even up to $10^9$ s. (4) comparedwith the homogeneous medium case, our calculated flux is weaker in the stellarwind case. finally, we find that two kinds of grb models (neutron star mergersand massive star collapses) may be discriminated in our numerical results.

astro-ph;0010261	grb afterglows from anisotropic jets	some progenitor models of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) (e.g., collapsars) mayproduce anisotropic jets in which the energy per unit solid angle is apower-law function of the angle ($\propto\theta^{-k}$). we calculate lightcurves and spectra for grb afterglows when such jets expand either in theinterstellar medium or in the wind medium. in particular, we take into accounttwo kinds of wind: one ($n\propto r^{-3/2}$) possibly from a typical redsupergiant star and another ($n\propto r^{-2}$) possibly from a wolf-rayetstar. we find that in each type of medium, one break appears in the late-timeafterglow light curve for small $k$ but becomes weaker and smoother as $k$increases. when $k\ge 2$, the break seems to disappear but the afterglow decaysrapidly. thus, one expects that the emission from expanding, highly anisotropicjets provides a plausible explanation for some rapidly fading afteglows whoselight curves have no break. we also present good fits to the optical afterglowlight curve of grb 991208. finally, we argue that this burst might arise from ahighly anisotropic jet expanding in the wind ($n\propto r^{-3/2}$) from a redsupergiant to interpret the observed radio-to-optical-band afterglow data(spectrum and light curve).

astro-ph;0104080	light curves of jetted gamma-ray burst afterglows in circumstellar  clouds	the afterglow emission from a spreading jet expanding in a circumstellarcloud is discussed. prompt x-ray radiation and a strong uv flash from thereverse shock produced by the interaction of the jet with the cloud may destroyand clear the dust out to about 30 pc within the initial solid angle of thejet. as the sideways expansion of the jet becomes significant, most of theoptical radiation from the high-latitude part of the jet may be absorbed by thedust outside the initial solid angle of the jet, but only the radiation fromthe part within the initial solid angle can be observed. we analytically showthat the flux of the observational radiation decays as $\propto t^{-(p+1)}$(where $p$ is the power-law index of the electron distribution) in therelativistic phase. this preliminary result motivates us to perform numericalcalculations. our results show that one break in the optical afterglow lighcurve extends over a factor of $\sim 3$ in time rather than one decade in timein the previous jet model. these results may provide a way to judge whethergrbs locate in dense clouds or not. finally, we carry out a detailed modellingfor the r-band afterglow of grb 000926.

astro-ph;0105164	accretion-induced conversion of high-velocity neutron stars to strange  stars in supernovae and implications for gamma-ray bursts	we present a new model for gamma-ray bursts (grbs) that are not onlyassociated with supernovae but also have small baryon contamination. in thismodel, we assume a newborn neutron star to move outward at a kick velocity of$\sim 10^3 {\rm km} {\rm s}^{-1}$ in the supernova ejecta. we find that such aneutron star still hypercritically accretes its surrounding supernova matter.once the stellar mass increases to some critical mass, the neutron star willundergo a phase transition to become a strange star, leading to an energyrelease of a few $10^{52}$ ergs. the phase transition, if possibly occuringjust near the supernova front, will first result in an ultra-relativisticfireball and then a grb. this provides a plausible explanation for thegrb-supernova association. we estimate the burst rate to be $\sim 10^{-6}$ peryear per galaxy. our model also predicts other possiblities. for example, ifthe resulting fireballs have a lorentz factor of the order of a few, they willproduce x-ray grbs observed by bepposax. we find the rate of such bursts to be$\sim 10^{-5}$ per year per galaxy.

astro-ph;0111222	overall temporal synchrotron emissions from relativistic jets: adiabatic  and radiative breaks	we discuss the grb afterglow emission from a relativistic jet that isinitially in the radiative regime in which the accelerated electrons are fastcooling. we note that such a ``semiradiative'' jet decelerates faster than anadiabatic jet does. we also take into account the effect of stronginverse-compton scattering on the cooling frequency in the synchrotroncomponent and therefore on the light curve decay index. we find that there aretwo kinds of light-curve break for the jet effect. the first is an ``adiabaticbreak'' if the electrons become slow cooling before the jet enters a spreadingphase, and the second is a ``radiative break'' which appears on the contrarycase. we then show how a relativistic jet evolves dynamically and derive theoverall temporal synchrotron emission in both cases, focusing on the change inlight curve decay index around the break time. finally, in view of our results,we rule out two cases for relativistic jets to account for the observed lightcurve breaks in a few afterglows: (i) an adiabatic jet with strong comptoncooling (y&gt;1) and with the cooling frequency nu_c locating in the observedenergy range; (ii) a radiative jet with a significant fraction of total energyoccupied by electrons (epsilon_e 1).

astro-ph;0111454	hydrodynamics of relativistic blast waves in a density-jump medium and  their emission signature	we analyze in detail the hydrodynamics and afterglow emission of anultrarelativistic blast wave when it expands in a density-jump medium. such amedium is likely to appear in the vicinity of gamma-ray bursts (grbs)associated with massive stars. the interaction of the blast wave with thismedium is described through a reverse shock and a forward shock. we show thatthe reverse shock is initially relativistic if the factor of a density jump($\alpha$) is much larger than 21, and newtonian if $1&lt;\alpha\ll 21$. we alsocalculate light curves of the afterglow emission during the interaction if thereverse shock is relativistic, and find that the optical flux density initiallydecays abruptly, then rises rapidly, and finally fades based on a power-law,which could be followed by an abrupt decay when the reverse shock has justcrossed the originally swept-up matter. therefore, one property of an afterglowoccurring in a large-density-jump medium is an abrupt drop followed by a bumpin the light curve and thus provides a probe of circumburst environments. inaddition, this property could not only account for the optical afterglows ofgrb 970508 and grb 000301c but also explain the x-ray afterglow of grb 981226.

astro-ph;0112469	failed gamma-ray bursts and orphan afterglows	it is believed that orphan afterglow searches can help to measure the beamingangle in gamma-ray bursts (grbs). great expectations have been put on thismethod. we point out that the method is in fact not as simple as we originallyexpected. due to the baryon-rich environment that is common to almost allpopular progenitor models, there should be many failed gamma-ray bursts, i.e.,fireballs with lorentz factor much less than 100 -- 1000, but still much largerthan unity. in fact, the number of failed gamma-ray bursts may even be muchlarger than that of successful bursts. owing to the existence of these failedgamma-ray bursts, there should be many orphan afterglows even if grbs are dueto isotropic fireballs, then the simple discovery of orphan afterglows nevermeans that grbs be collimated. unfortunately, to distinguish a failed-grborphan and a jetted but off-axis grb orphan is not an easy task. the majorproblem is that the trigger time is unknown. some possible solutions to theproblem are suggested.

astro-ph;0203084	spectrum and duration of delayed mev-gev emission of gamma-ray bursts in  cosmic background radiation fields	we generally analyze prompt high-energy emission above a few hundreds of gevdue to synchrotron self-compton scattering in internal shocks. however, suchphotons cannot be detected because they may collide with cosmic infraredbackground photons, leading to electron/positron pair production.inverse-compton scattering of the resulting electron/positron pairs off cosmicmicrowave background photons will produce delayed mev-gev emission, which maybe much stronger than a typical high-energy afterglow in the external shockmodel. we expand on the cheng &amp; cheng model by deriving the emission spectrumand duration in the standard fireball shock model. a typical duration of theemission is ~ 10^3 seconds, and the time-integrated scattered photon spectrumis nu^{-(p+6)/4}, where p is the index of the electron energy distributionbehind internal shocks. this is slightly harder than the synchrotron photonspectrum, nu^{-(p+2)/2}. the lower energy property of the scattered photonspectrum is dependent on the spectral energy distribution of the cosmicinfrared background radiation. therefore, future observations on such delayedmev-gev emission and the higher-energy spectral cutoff by the gamma-ray largearea space telescope (glast) would provide a probe of the cosmic infraredbackground radiation.

astro-ph;0206499	early gev afterglows from gamma-ray bursts in pulsar wind bubbles	gamma-ray bursts may occur within pulsar wind bubbles (pwbs) under a numberof scenarios, such as the supranova-like models in which the progenitor pulsardrives a powerful wind shocking against the ambient medium before it comes todeath and produces a fireball. we here study the early afterglow emission fromgrbs expanding into such a pwb environment. different from the usual cold grbexternal medium, the pwbs consist of a hot electron-positron medium withtypical 'thermal' lorentz factor of the order of gamma_w, the lorentz factor ofthe pulsar particle wind. after grb blast waves shock these hotelectron-positron pairs, they will emit synchrotron radiation peaking at gevbands. it is shown that gev photons suffer negligible absorption by the softphotons radiation field in pwbs. thus, strong gev emissions in the earlyafterglow phases are expected, providing a plausible explanation for thelong-duration gev emission from grb940217 detected by egret. future glast mayhave the potential to test this grb-pwb interaction model.

astro-ph;0207439	possible geometries of afterglow generation in the gamma-ray burst  grb990705	the absorption feature detected in the prompt x-ray emission of grb990705 hasimportant consequences for its circum-burst environment and therefore on itsafterglows. here we investigate whether the circum-burst environmentconstrained by the absorption feature could be consistent with the observedh-band afterglow, which exhibits an earlier power law decay but a much fasterdecay about one day after the burst. two possible geometries of theafterglow-emitting regions are suggested: 1) afterglow emission produced by theimpact of the fireball on the surrounding torus, which serves as the absorbingmaterial of the x-ray feature, as would be expected in the models involvingthat a supernova explosion precedes the gamma-ray burst by some time;2)afterglow emission produced in the dense circum-burst medium inside thetorus. in case 1), the faster decay at the later time is attributed to thedisappearance of the shock due to the counter-pressure in the hot torusilluminated by the burst and afterglow photons. for case 2), the circum-burstmedium density is found to be very high ($n\ga 10^4-10^5 {\rm cm^{-3}}$) if theemitting plasma is a jet or even higher if it is spherical. future betterobservations of afterglows of grbs that have absorption features might make itpossible to make a more definite choice between these two scenarios.

(2002). we find that thedynamical evolution of the eastern jet at the late time is consistent with thewell-known sedov evolutionary phase. a trans-relativistic external shockdynamic model by analogy with the evolution of gamma-ray burst remnants, isshown to be able to fit the observation data reasonably well. the inferredinterstellar medium density around the source is well below the canonical value$n_ism \sim 1 cm^{-3}$. we find that the emission from the continuously shockedinterstellar medium (forward shock region) decays too slowly to be a viablemechanism for the eastern x-ray jet. however, the rapidly fading x-ray emissioncan be interpreted as synchrotron radiation from the non-thermal electrons inthe adiabatically expanding ejecta. these electrons were accelerated by thereverse shock (moving back into the ejecta) which becomes important when theinertia of the swept external matter leads to an appreciable slowing down ofthe original ejecta. to ensure the dominance of the emission from the shockedejecta over that from the forward shock region during the period of theobservations, the magnetic field and electron energy fractions in the forwardshock region must be far below equipartition. future continuous, follow-upmulti-wavelength observations of new ejection events from microquasars up tothe significant deceleration phase should provide more valuable insight intothe nature of the interaction between the jets and external medium.

astro-ph;0304110	optical flashes and very early afterglows in wind environments	the interaction of a relativistic fireball with its ambient medium isdescribed through two shocks: a reverse shock that propagates into thefireball, and a forward shock that propagates into the medium. the observedoptical flash of grb 990123 has been considered to be the emission from such areverse shock. the observational properties of afterglows suggest that theprogenitors of some grbs may be massive stars and their surrounding media maybe stellar winds. we here study very early afterglows from the reverse andforward shocks in winds. an optical flash mainly arises from the relativisticreverse shock while a radio flare is produced by the forward shock. the peakflux densities of optical flashes are larger than 1 jy for typical parameters,if we do not take into account some appropriate dust obscuration along the lineof sight. the radio flare always has a long lasting constant flux, which willnot be covered up by interstellar scintillation. the non-detections of opticalflashes brighter than about 9th magnitude may constrain the grbs isotropicenergies to be no more than a few $10^{52}$ ergs and wind intensities to berelatively weak.

astro-ph;0311601	constraining the origin of tev photons from gamma-ray bursts with  delayed mev-gev emission formed by interaction with cosmic infrared/microwave  background photons	it has been suggested that electromagnetic cascade of very high energygamma-rays from gamma-ray bursts (grbs) in the infrared/microwave backgroundcan produce delayed mev-gev photons. this delay could be caused by the angularspreading effect of the scattered microwave photons or deflection of thesecondly pairs due to intergalactic magnetic field. very high energy tevphotons of grbs could be produced by a few mechanisms including theproton-synchrotron radiation and electron inverse compton emission from grbinternal shocks as well as external shocks. we suggest that the informationprovided by the delayed emission could give constraints on models for tevgamma-rays. a more accurate calculation of the delayed time caused by theangular spreading effect is presented by considering recent observations of theextragalactic infrared background and the theoretic high-redshift infraredbackground. we also suggest that the dependence of the maximum time delay ofscattered photons on their energies, if determined by future glast detector,could differentiate the two mechanisms causing the time delay.

astro-ph;0403677	the peak energy distribution of the nu f_nu spectra and the implications  for the jet structure models of gamma-ray bursts	we study the peak energy ($e_{\rm{p}}$) distribution of the $\nu f_{\nu}$spectra of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and x-ray flashes (xrfs) with a sample of 57bursts observed by {\em high energy transient explorer 2} ({\em hete-2}) frenchgamma telescope and discuss its implications for the jet structure models.combining the observed $e_{\rm{p}}$ distribution of {\em hete--2} grbs/xrfswith that of batse grbs, we find that the observed $e_{\rm{p}}$ distribution ofgrbs/xrfs is a bimodal one with peaks of $\lesssim 30$ kev and $\sim 160-250$kev. according to the recently-discovered equivalent-isotropicenergy-$e_{\rm{p}}$ relationship, such a bimodal distribution implies atwo-component structure of grb/xrf jets. a simple simulation analysis showsthat this structured jet model does roughly reproduce a bimodal distributionwith peaks of $\sim 15$ and $\sim 200$ kev. we argue that future observationsof the peak of $\sim 15$ kev in the $e_{\rm{p}}$ distribution would be evidencesupporting this model. {\em swift}, which covers an energy band of 0.2--150kev, is expected to provide a key test for our results.

astro-ph;0407442	jet break time -- flux density relationship and constraints on physical  parameters of grb afterglows	we derive a relation between the flux density $f_{\nu,j}$ at the light-curvebreak of a gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow and the break time $t_{j}$. thebreak is due to the transition from the spherical-like to jet-like evolution ofthe afterglow, when the lorentz factor of the jet equals the inverse of theinitial half-opening angle, i.e., $\gamma=1/\theta_0$. we show that thisrelation indeed behaves as $f_{\nu,j}\propto t_{j}^{-p}$ among grbs for theslow-cooling case, where $p$ is the power-law index of electron distribution. astatistical analysis of the optical jet breaks of nine grbs gives $p=2.10\pm0.21$, which is consistent with the shock acceleration theory. the value of $p$derived in this way is different from the observed temporal index $\alpha_2$($f_{\nu}\propto t^{-\alpha_{2}}$) of the late-time light curve after $t_{j}$,which suffers several uncertainties from the unclear hydrodynamics of thesideways expansion and exhibits a large dispersion. our results not onlyconfirm that the remnants of grbs are standard candles, but also provide thefirst evidence that the physical parameters of relativistic shocks areuniversal, with the favored values $\epsilon_{e}\sim 0.1$ and $\epsilon_{b}\sim10^{-3}$.

astro-ph;0411024	analytical light curves in the realistic model for grb afterglows	(abridged) afterglow light curves are constructed analytically for realisticgamma-ray burst remnants decelerating in either a homogeneous interstellarmedium or a stellar wind environment, taking into account the radiative loss ofthe blast wave, which affects the temporal behaviors significantly. inversecompton scattering is considered. the inverse compton effect prolongs thefast-cooling phase markedly, during which the relativistic shock issemi-radiative and the radiation efficiency is approximately constant. it isfurther shown that the shock is still semi-radiative for quite a long timeafter it transits into the slow-cooling phase. the temporal decaying index ofthe x-ray afterglow light curve in this semi-radiative phase is more consistentwith the observed $&lt;\alpha_{x}&gt; \sim 1.3$ than the commonly used adiabatic one.to manifest as a bump or even dominant in the x-ray afterglows during therelativistic stage, it is required that the density should be larger than about1-10 cm$^{-3}$ in the interstellar medium case, or the wind parameter$a_{\ast}$ should be larger than unity in the stellar wind case.

astro-ph;0502085	an energetic blast wave from the december 27 giant flare of the soft  gamma-ray repeater 1806-20	recent follow-up observations of the december 27 giant flare of sgr 1806-20have detected a multiple-frequency radio afterglow from 240 mhz to 8.46 ghz,extending in time from a week to about a month after the flare. the angularsize of the source was also measured for the first time. here we show that thisradio afterglow gives the first piece of clear evidence that an energetic blastwave sweeps up its surrounding medium and produces a synchrotron afterglow, thesame mechanism as established for gamma-ray burst afterglows. the opticalafterglow is expected to be intrinsically as bright as $m_r\simeq13$ at $t\la0.1$ days after the flare, but very heavy extinction makes the detectiondifficult because of the low galactic latitude of the source. rapid infraredfollow-up observations to giant flares are therefore crucial for thelow-latitude sgrs, while for high-latitude sgrs (e.g. sgr 0526-66), rapidfollow-ups should result in identification of their possible opticalafterglows. rapid multi-wavelength follow-ups will also provide more detailedinformation of the early evolution of a fireball as well as its composition.

astro-ph;0508602	early afterglows in wind environments revisited	when a cold shell sweeps up the ambient medium, a forward shock and a reverseshock will form. we analyze the reverse-forward shocks in a wind environment,including their dynamics and emission. an early afterglow is emitted from theshocked shell, e.g., an optical flash may emerge. the reverse shock behavesdifferently in two approximations: relativistic and newtonian cases, whichdepend on the parameters, e.g., the initial lorentz factor of the ejecta. ifthe initial lorentz factor is much less than $114 e_{53}^{1/4}\delta_{0,12}^{-1/4} a_{*,-1}^{-1/4}$, the early reverse shock is newtonian.this may take place for the wider of a two-component jet, an orphan afterglowcaused by a low initial lorentz factor, and so on. the synchrotron selfabsorption effect is significant especially for the newtonian reverse shockcase, since the absorption frequency $\nu_a$ is larger than the coolingfrequency $\nu_c$ and the minimum synchrotron frequency $\nu_m$ for typicalparameters. for the optical to x-ray band, the flux is nearly unchanged withtime during the early period, which may be a diagnostic for the low initiallorentz factor of the ejecta in a wind environment. we also investigate theearly light curves with different wind densities, and compare them with thesein the ism model.

astro-ph;0512279	constraining the cosmological parameters and transition redshift with  gamma-ray bursts and supernovae	a new method of measuring cosmology with gamma-ray bursts(grbs) has beenproposed by liang and zhang recently. in this method, only observablequantities including the rest frame peak energy of the \nu f_\nu spectrum(e'_p), the isotropic energy of grb (e_{\gamma,iso}), and the break time of theoptical afterglow light curves in the rest frame (t'_b) are used. byconsidering this method we constrain the cosmological parameters and theredshift at which the universe expanded from the deceleration to accelerationphase. we add five recently-detected grbs to the sample and derive e_{\gamma,iso}/10^{52} ergs=(0.93\pm 0.25)\times (e'_p/100 kev)^{1.91\pm 0.32}\times(t'_b/day)^{-0.93\pm 0.38} for a flat cosmology with \omega_m=0.28 and h_0=71.0km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}. this relation is independent of the medium density aroundbursts and the efficiency of conversion of the explosion energy to gamma-rayenergy that are difficult to measure. we regard the e_{\gamma,iso}(e'_p, t'_b)relationship as a standard candle and find 0.05&lt;\omega_m&lt;0.48 and\omega_\lambda&lt;1.15 (at the 1\sigma confidence level). in a flat universe withthe cosmological constant we obtain 0.25&lt;\omega_m &lt;0.46 and0.54&lt;\omega_\lambda&lt;0.78 at the 1\sigma confidence level. the transitionredshift is z_t=0.69_{-0.12}^{+0.11}. combining 20 grbs and 157 type iasupernovae, we find \omega_m=0.29 \pm0.03 for a flat universe and thetransition redshift is z_t=0.61_{-0.05}^{+0.06}, which is slightly larger thanthe value found by considering sne ia alone. in particular, we also discussseveral dark-energy models in which the equation of state w(z) is arameterizedand investigate constraints on the cosmological parameters in detail.

astro-ph;0512555	x-ray flares: late internal and late external shocks	we analyze several recently detected gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with late x-rayflares in the context of late internal shock and late external shock models. wefind that the x-ray flares in grb 050421 and grb 050502b originate from lateinternal shocks, while the main x-ray flares in grb 050406 and grb 050607 mayarise from late external shocks. under the assumption that the central enginehas two periods of activities, we get four basic types of x-ray light curves.the classification of these types depends on which period of activitiesproduces the prompt gamma-ray emission (type 1 and type 2: the earlier period;type 3 and type 4: the late period), and on whether the late ejecta catching upwith the early ejecta happens earlier than the deceleration of the early ejecta(type 1 and type 3) or not (type 2 and type 4). we find that the x-ray flarecaused by a late external shock is a special case of type 1. our analysisreveals that the x-ray light curves of grbs 050406, 050421, and 050607 can beclassified as type 1, while the x-ray light curve of grb 050502b is classifiedas type 2. however, the x-ray light curve of grb 050406 is also likely to betype 2. we also predict a long-lag short-lived x-ray flare caused by the innerexternal shock, which forms when a low baryon-loading long-lag late ejectadecelerates in the non-relativistic tail of an outer external shock driven byan early ejecta.

astro-ph;0605200	low luminosity gamma-ray bursts as a unique population: luminosity  function, local rate, and beaming factor	swift/bat has detected ~ 200 long-duration grbs, with redshift measurementsfor ~50 of them. we derive the luminosity function (phi^{hl}) and the localevent rate (rho_0^{hl}) of the conventional high luminosity (hl) grbs by usingthe z-known swift grbs. our results are generally consistent with that derivedfrom the cgro/batse data. however, the fact that swift detected a lowluminosity (ll) grb, grb 060218, at z=0.033 within ~ 2 year of operation,together with the previous detection of the nearby grb 980425, suggests a muchhigher local rate for these ll-grbs. we explore the possibility that ll-grbs asa distinct grb population from the hl-grbs. we find that rho_0^{ll} is325_{-177}^{+352} gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}, which is much higher thanrho_0^{hl}(1.12_{-0.20}^{+0.43} gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}). this rate is ~ 0.7% of thelocal type ib/c sne. our results, together with the finding that less than 10%of type ib/c sne are associated with off-beam grbs, suggest that ll-grbs have abeaming factor typically less than 14, or a jet angle typically wider than31^{o}. the high local grb rate, the small beaming factor, and low luminositymake the ll-grbs distinct from the hl-grbs. although the current data could notfully rule out the possibility that both hl- and ll-grbs are the samepopulation, our results suggest that ll-grbs are likely a unique grb populationand the observed low redshift grb sample is dominated by the ll-grbs.

astro-ph;9806305	gamma-ray burst afterglows: effects of radiative corrections and  nonuniformity of the surrounding medium	the afterglow of a gamma-ray burst (grb) is commonly thought to be due tocontinuous deceleration of a relativistically expanding fireball in thesurrounding medium. assuming that the expansion of the fireball is adiabaticand that the density of the medium is a power-law function of shock radius,viz., $n_{ext}\propto r^{-k}$, we analytically study the effects of thefirst-order radiative correction and the nonuniformity of the medium on a grbafterglow. we first derive a new relation among the observed time, the shockradius and the fireball's lorentz factor: $t_\oplus=r/4(4-k)\gamma^2c$, andalso derive a new relation among the comoving time, the shock radius and thefireball's lorentz factor: $t_{co}=2r/(5-k)\gamma c$. we next study theevolution of the fireball by using the analytic solution of blandford and mckee(1976). the radiation losses may not significantly influence this evolution. wefurther derive new scaling laws both between the x-ray flux and observed timeand between the optical flux and observed time. we use these scaling laws todiscuss the afterglows of grb 970228 and grb 970616, and find that if thespectral index of the electron distribution is $p=2.5$, implied from thespectra of grbs, the x-ray afterglow of grb970616 is well fitted by assuming$k=2$.

astro-ph;9806334	gamma-ray burst afterglows from realistic fireballs	a grb afterglow has been commonly thought to be due to continuousdeceleration of a postburst fireball. many analytical models have madesimplifications for deceleration dynamics of the fireball and its radiationproperty, although they are successful at explaining the overall features ofthe observed afterglows. we here propose a model for a grb afterglow in whichthe evolution of a postburst fireball is in an intermediate case between theadiabatic and highly radiative expansion. in our model, the afterglow is bothdue to the contribution of the adiabatic electrons behind the externalblastwave of the fireball and due to the contribution of the radiativeelectrons. in addition, this model can describe evolution of the fireball fromthe extremely relativistic phase to the non-relativistic phase. ourcalculations show that the fireball will go to the adiabatic expansion phaseafter about a day if the accelerated electrons are assumed to occupy the totalinternal energy. in all cases considered, the fireball will go to the mildlyrelativistic phase about $10^4$ seconds later, and to the non-relativisticphase after several days. these results imply that the relativistic adiabaticmodel cannot describe the deceleration dynamics of the several-days-laterfireball. the comparison of the calculated light curves with the observedresults at late times may imply the presence of impulsive events or energyinjection with much longer durations.

astro-ph;9906109	environment and energy injection effects in grb afterglows	in a recent paper (dai &amp; lu 1999), we have proposed a simple model in whichthe steepening in the light curve of the r-band afterglow of the gamma-rayburst (grb) 990123 is caused by the adiabatic shock which has evolved from anultrarelativistic phase to a nonrelativistic phase in a dense medium. we findthat such a model is quite consistent with observations if the medium densityis about $3\times 10^6 {\rm cm}^{-3}$. here we discuss this model in moredetails. in particular, we investigate the effects of synchrotron selfabsorption and energy injection. a shock in a dense medium becomesnonrelativistic rapidly after a short relativistic phase. the afterglow fromthe shock at the nonrelativistic stage decays more rapidly than at therelativistic stage. since some models for grb energy sources predict that astrongly magnetic millisecond pulsar may be born during the formation of grb,we discuss the effect of such a pulsar on the evolution of the nonrelativisticshock through magnetic dipole radiation. we find that after the energy whichthe shock obtains from the pulsar is much more than the initial energy of theshock, the afterglow decay will flatten significantly. when the pulsar energyinput effect disappears, the decay will steepen again. these features are inexcellent agreement with the afterglows of grb 980519, grb 990510 and grb980326. furthermore, our model fits very well all the observational data of grb980519 including the last two detections.

astro-ph;9908248	a two-step model for gamma-ray bursts associated with supernovae	we here propose a two-step model for gamma-ray bursts (grbs) associated withsupernovae. in the first step, the core collapse of a star with mass $\ge19m_\odot$ leads to a massive neutron star and a normal supernova, andsubsequently hypercritical accretion of the neutron star from the supernovaejecta may give rise to a jet through neutrino annihilation and/or poyntingflux along the stellar rotation axis. however, because of too much surroundingmatter, this jet rapidly enters a nonrelativistic phase and evolves to a largebubble. in the second step, the neutron star promptly implodes to a rapidlyrotating black hole surrounded by a torus when the mass of the star increasesto the maximum mass and meanwhile its rotation frequency increases to the upperlimit due to the accreted angular momentum. the gravitational binding energy ofthe torus may be dissipated by a magnetized relativistic wind, which may thenbe absorbed by the supernova ejecta, thus producing an energetic hypernova. therotational energy of the black hole may be extracted by the blandford-znajek'smechanism, leading to another jet. this jet is relatively free of baryons andthus may be accelerated to an ultrarelativistic phase because the first jet haspushed out of its front matter and left a baryon-free exit. we expect that thesecond jet generates a grb and its afterglow. our two-step model may alleviatethe baryon-contamination problem suffered possibly from in the hypernovamodels. furthermore, this model not only accounts for association of severalgrbs with supernovae but also explains well the features of the afterglows ofthese bursts.

astro-ph;9910029	a possible model for the supernova/gamma-ray burst connection	conversion from neutron stars to strange stars as a possible mechanism ofcosmological gamma-ray bursts (grbs) has been discussed in previous works,although the existence of strange stars is still an open question. on the basisof this mechanism, we here outline an explanation of the connection betweensupernovae (sne) and grbs, which has got increasing evidence recently. anasymmetric but normal sn explosion leaves a massive ($\geq1.8{\rm m_\odot}$)and rapidly rotating neutron star, which then converts to a strange star fewdays later, due to its rapid spindown. the accompanied fireball, which can beaccelerated to ultra-relativistic velocity ($\gamma_0\sim 100$) due to the verylow baryon contamination of the strange star, flows out along the direction ofthe high-velocity sn jet and subsequently produces a grb and the following lowenergy afterglows by interacting with the surrounding stellar wind. we willalso expect a very luminous supernova like sn1998bw, if a large fraction of theconversion energy finally turns into the kinetic energy of the supernovaejecta.

astro-ph;9910493	overall evolution of jetted gamma-ray burst ejecta	whether gamma-ray bursts are highly beamed or not is a very difficult butimportant problem that we are confronted with. some theorists suggest thatbeaming effect usually leads to a sharp break in the afterglow light curveduring the ultra-relativistic phase, with the breaking point determined by$\gamma = 1 / \theta_0$, where $\gamma$ is the lorentz factor of the blastwaveand $\theta_0$ is the initial half opening angle of the ejecta, but numericalstudies tend to reject the suggestion. we note that previous studies areuniformly based on dynamics that is not proper for non-relativistic blastwaves.here we investigate the problem in more detail, paying special attention to thetransition from the ultra-relativistic phase to the non-relativistic phase. dueto some crucial refinements in the dynamics, we can follow the overallevolution of a realistic jet till its velocity is as small as $\beta c \sim10^{-3} c$. we find no obvious break in the optical light curve during therelativistic phase itself. however, an obvious break does appear at thetransition from the relativistic phase to the newtonian phase if the physicalparameters involved are properly assumed. generally speaking, the newtonianphase is characterized by a sharp decay of optical afterglows, with the powerlaw timing index $\alpha \sim 1.8$ - 2.1. this is due to the quick lateralexpansion at this stage. the quick decay of optical afterglows from grb 970228,980326, and 980519, and the breaks in the optical light curves of grb 990123and 990510 may indicate the presence of highly collimated $\gamma$-ray burstejecta.

astro-ph;9911516	energy sources of soft gamma-ray repeaters	quiescence and burst emission and relativistic particle winds of softgamma-ray repeaters (sgrs) have been widely interpreted to result fromultrastrongly magnetized neutron stars. in this magnetar model, the magneticenergy and gravitational energy of the neutron stars are suggested as theenergy sources of all the emission and winds. however, harding, contopoulos &amp;kazanas (1999) have shown that the magnetic field should be only ~ 3 x 10^{13}g in order to match the characteristic spin-down timescale of sgr 1806-20 andits snr age. here we argue that if the magnetic field is indeed so weak, thepreviously suggested energy sources seem problematic. we further propose aplausible model in which sgr pulsars are young strange stars withsuperconducting cores and with a poloidal magnetic field of ~ 3 x 10^{13} g. inthis model, the movement of the flux tubes not only leads to crustal crackingof the stars, giving rise to deconfinement of crustal matter to strange matter,but also to movement of internal magnetic toruses with the flux tubes. theformer process will result in burst and quiescence emission and the latterprocess will produce steady relativistic winds which will power the surroundingsupernova remnants.
