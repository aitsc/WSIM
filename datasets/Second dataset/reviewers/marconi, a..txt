0901.0974	the metallicity of the most distant quasars	we investigate the metallicity of the broad line region (blr) of a sample of30 quasars in the redshift range 4&lt;z&lt;6.4, by using near-ir and optical spectra.we focus on the ratio of the broad lines (siiv1397+oiv]1402)/civ1549, which isa good metallicity tracer of the blr. we find that the metallicity of the blris very high even in qsos at z~6. the inferred metallicity of the blr gas is sohigh (several times solar) that metal ejection or mixing with lower metallicitygas in the host galaxy is required to match the metallicities observed in localmassive galaxies. on average, the observed metallicity changes neither amongquasars in the observed redshift range 4&lt;z&lt;6.4, nor when compared with quasarsat lower redshifts. we show that the apparent lack of metallicity evolution isa likely consequence of both the black hole-galaxy co-evolution and ofselection effects. the data also suggest a lack of evolution in the carbonabundance, even among z&gt;6 quasars. the latter result is puzzling, since theminimum enrichment timescale of carbon is about 1 gyr, i.e. longer than the ageof the universe at z~6.

0902.2398	lsd: lyman-break galaxies stellar populations and dynamics. i: mass,  metallicity and gas at z~3.1	we present the first results of a project, lsd, aimed at obtainingspatially-resolved, near-infrared spectroscopy of a complete sample oflyman-break galaxies at z~3. deep observations with adaptive optics resulted inthe detection of the main optical lines, such as [oii], hbeta and [oiii], whichare used to study sizes, sfrs, morphologies, gas-phase metallicities, gasfractions and effective yields. optical, near-ir and spitzer/irac photometry isused to measure stellar mass. we obtain that morphologies are usually complex,with the presence of several peaks of emissions and companions that are notdetected in broad-band images. typical metallicities are 10-50% solar, with astrong evolution of the mass-metallicity relation from lower redshifts. stellarmasses, gas fraction, and evolutionary stages vary significantly among thegalaxies, with less massive galaxies showing larger fractions of gas. incontrast with observations in the local universe, effective yields decreasewith stellar mass and reach solar values at the low-mass end of the sample.this effect can be reproduced by gas infall with rates of the order of thesfrs. outflows are present but are not needed to explain the mass-metallicityrelation. we conclude that a large fraction of these galaxies are activelycreating stars after major episodes of gas infall or merging.

0904.1896	episodic random accretion and the cosmological evolution of supermassive  black hole spins	the growth of supermassive black holes (bhs) located at the centers of theirhost galaxies comes mainly from accretion of gas, but how to fuel them remainsan outstanding unsolved problem in quasar evolution. this issue can beelucidated by quantifying the radiative efficiency parameter ($\eta$) as afunction of redshift, which also provides constraints on the average spin ofthe bhs and its possible evolution with time. we derive a formalism to link$\eta$ with the luminosity density, bh mass density, and duty cycle of quasars,quantities we can estimate from existing quasar and galaxy survey data. we findthat $\eta$ has a strong cosmological evolution: at z~2, $\eta \approx 0.3$,and by $z\approx 0$ it has decreased by an order of magnitude, to $\eta\approx0.03$. we interpret this trend as evolution in bh spin, and we appeal toepisodic, random accretion as the mechanism for reducing the spin. theobservation that the fraction of radio-loud quasars decreases with increasingredshift is inconsistent with the popular notion that bh spin is a criticalfactor for generating strong radio jets. in agreement with previous studies, weshow that the derived history of bh accretion closely follows the cosmichistory of star formation, consistent with other evidence that bhs and theirhost galaxies coevolve.

0905.0539	on the observed distributions of black hole masses and eddington ratios  from radiation pressure corrected virial indicators	the application of the virial theorem to the broad line region of activegalactic nuclei allows black hole mass estimates for large samples of objectsat all redshifts. in a recent paper we showed that ionizing radiation pressureonto blr clouds affects virial bh mass estimates and we provided empiricallycalibrated corrections. more recently, a new test of the importance ofradiation forces has been proposed: the mbh-sigma relation has been used toestimate mbh for a sample of type-2 agn and virial relations (with and withoutradiation pressure) for a sample of type-1 agn extracted from the same parentpopulation. the observed l/ledd distribution based on virial bh masses is ingood agreement with that based on mbh-sigma only if radiation pressure effectsare negligible, otherwise significant discrepancies are observed. in this paperwe investigate the effects of intrinsic dispersions associated to the virialrelations providing mbh, and we show that they explain the discrepanciesbetween the observed l/ledd distributions of type-1 and type-2 agn. thesediscrepancies in the l/ledd distributions are present regardless of the generalimportance of radiation forces, which must be negligible only for a smallfraction of sources with large l/ledd. average radiation pressure correctionsshould then be applied in virial mbh estimators until their dependence onobserved source physical properties has been fully calibrated. finally, thecomparison between mbh and l/ledd distributions derived from sigma-based andvirial estimators can constrain the variance of blr physical properties in agn.

0907.1236	exploring the active galactic nucleus and starburst content of local  ultraluminous infrared galaxies through 5-8 micron spectroscopy	we present a 5-8 micron analysis of the spitzer-irs spectra of 71ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) with redshift z &lt; 0.15, devoted to thestudy of the role of active galactic nuclei (agn) and starbursts (sb) as thepower source of the extreme infrared emission. around 5 micron an agn is muchbrighter (by a factor 30) than a starburst of equal bolometric luminosity. thisallows us to detect the presence of even faint accretion-driven cores insideulirgs: signatures of agn activity are found in 70 per cent of our sample(50/71 sources). through a simple analytical model we are also able to obtain aquantitative estimate of the agn/sb contribution to the overall energy outputof each source. although the main fraction of ulirg luminosity is confirmed toarise from star formation events, the agn contribution is non-negligible (23per cent) and is shown to increase with luminosity. the existence of a ratherheterogeneous pattern in the composition and geometrical structure of the dustamong ulirgs is newly supported by the comparison between individual absorptionfeatures and continuum extinction.

1001.1072	spectroastrometry of rotating gas disks for the detection of  supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei. i. method and simulations	this is the first in a series of papers in which we study the application ofspectroastrometry in the context of gas kinematical studies aimed at measuringthe mass of supermassive black holes. the spectroastrometrical method consistsin measuring the photocenter of light emission in different wavelength orvelocity channels. in particular we explore the potential of spectroastrometryof gas emission lines in galaxy nuclei to constrain the kinematics of rotatinggas disks and to measure the mass of putative supermassive black holes. bymeans of detailed simulations and test cases, we show that the fundamentaladvantage of spectroastrometry is that it can provide information on thegravitational potential of a galaxy on scales significantly smaller (~ 1/10)than the limit imposed by the spatial resolution of the observations. we thendescribe a simple method to infer detailed kinematical informations fromspectroastrometry in longslit spectra and to measure the mass of nuclear massconcentrations. such method can be applied straightforwardly to integral fieldspectra, which do not have the complexities due to a partial spatial coveringof the source in the case of longslit spectra.

1005.0006	a fundamental relation between mass, sfr and metallicity in local and  high redshift galaxies	we show that the mass-metallicity relation observed in the local universe isdue to a more general relation between stellar mass m*, gas-phase metallicityand sfr. local galaxies define a tight surface in this 3d space, thefundamental metallicity relation (fmr), with a small residual dispersion of~0.05 dex in metallicity, i.e, ~12%. at low stellar mass, metallicity decreasessharply with increasing sfr, while at high stellar mass, metallicity does notdepend on sfr. high redshift galaxies, up to z~2.5 are found to follow the samefmr defined by local sdss galaxies, with no indication of evolution. theevolution of the mass-metallicity relation observed up to z=2.5 is due to thefact that galaxies with progressively higher sfrs, and therefore lowermetallicities, are selected at increasing redshifts, sampling different partsof the same fmr. by introducing the new quantity mu_alpha=log(m*)-alphalog(sfr), with alpha=0.32, we define a projection of the fmr that minimizes themetallicity scatter of local galaxies. the same quantity also cancels out anyredshift evolution up to z~2.5, i.e, all galaxies have the same range of valuesof mu_0.32. at z&gt;2.5, evolution of about 0.6 dex off the fmr is observed, withhigh-redshift galaxies showing lower metallicities. the existence of the fmrcan be explained by the interplay of infall of pristine gas and outflow ofenriched material. the former effect is responsible for the dependence ofmetallicity with sfr and is the dominant effect at high-redshift, while thelatter introduces the dependence on stellar mass and dominates at low redshift.the combination of these two effects, together with the schmidt-kennicutt law,explains the shape of the fmr and the role of mu_0.32. the small metallicityscatter around the fmr supports the smooth infall scenario of gas accretion inthe local universe.

1006.4463	the extinction law at high redshift and its implications	we analyze the optical-near infrared spectra of 33 quasars with redshifts3.9&lt;z&lt;6.4 to investigate the properties of dust extinction at these cosmicepochs. the smc extinction curve has been shown to reproduce the dust reddeningof most quasars at z&lt;2.2; we investigate whether this curve also provides agood description of dust extinction at higher redshifts. we fit the observedspectra with synthetic absorbed quasar templates obtained by varying theintrinsic slope (alpha), the absolute extinction (a3000), and by using a gridof empirical and theoretical extinction curves. we find that seven quasars inour sample are affected by substantial extinction (a3000 &gt;0.8), andcharacterized by very steep intrinsic slopes (alpha&lt;-2.3). all of theindividual quasars require extinction curve deviating from that of the smc,with a tendency to flatten at lambda&lt;2000 a (in the rest frame of the source).we obtain a mean extinction curve at z&gt;4, both by performing a simultaneous fitof all quasars and by averaging the extinction curves inferred for individualquasars. in the case of broad absorption line quasars the mean extinction curvedeviates from the smc at a confidence level &gt;95%. the difference betweenextinction curves in quasars at z&gt;4 and in quasars at lower redshift isindicative of either a different dust production mechanism at high redshift, ora different mechanism for processing dust into the ism. we suggest that thesame transitions may also apply to normal, star-forming galaxies at z&gt;4. inparticular, the observed change in the average spectral slope of galaxies atz&gt;4 may be partially ascribed to a variation in the extinction curve, ratherthan a lower dust content at high redshift. in this scenario, the extinctioncurve inferred at z&gt;4 would imply a cosmic star-formation corrected for dustattenuation a factor of ~2 higher than estimated in the past.

1010.0768	the m_bh-m_star relation of obscured agns at high redshift	we report the detection of broad halpha emission in three x-ray selectedobscured agns at z=1-2. by exploiting the halpha width and the intrinsic x-rayluminosity, we estimate their black hole masses, which are in the range0.1-3x10^9 msun. by means of multi-band photometric data, we measure thestellar mass of their host galaxy and, therefore, infer their m_bh/m_starratio. these are the first obscured agns at high-z, selected based on theirblack hole accretion (i.e. on the basis of their x-ray luminosity), that can belocated on the m_bh-m_star relation at high-z. all of these obscured high-zagns are fully consistent with the local m_bh-m_star relation. this resultconflicts with those for other samples of agns in the same redshift range,whose m_bh/m_star ratio departs significantly from the value observed in localgalaxies. we suggest that the obscured agns in our sample are in an advancedevolutionary stage, have already settled onto the local m_bh-m_star relation,and whose nuclear activity has been temporarily revived by recent galaxyinteractions.

1010.2037	[o iii] equivalent width and orientation effects in quasars	the flux of the [oiii] line is considered to be a good indicator of thebolometric emission of quasars. the observed continuum emission from theaccretion disc should instead be strongly dependent on the inclination angletheta between the disc axis and the line of sight. based on this, theequivalent width (ew) of [oiii] should provide a direct measure of theta. herewe analyze the distribution of ew([oiii]) in a sample of ~6,000 sdss quasars,and find that it can be accurately reproduced assuming a relatively smallintrinsic scatter and a random distribution of inclination angles. this resulthas several implications: 1) it is a direct proof of the disc-like emission ofthe optical continuum of quasars; 2) the value of ew([oiii]) can be used as aproxy of the inclination, to correct the measured continuum emission and thenestimate the bolometric luminosity of quasars; 3) the presence of almostedge-on discs among broad line quasars implies that the accretion disc is notaligned with the circumnuclear absorber, and/or that the covering fraction ofthe latter is rather small. finally, we show that a similar analysis of ewdistributions of broad lines (hbeta, mg ii, c iv) provides no evidence ofinclination effects, suggesting a disc-like geometry of the broad emission lineregion.

1010.2534	gas accretion as the origin of chemical abundance gradients in distant  galaxies	it has recently been suggested that galaxies in the early universe can growthrough the accretion of cold gas, and that this may have been the main driverof star formation and stellar mass growth. because the cold gas is essentiallyprimordial, it has a very low abundance of elements heavier than helium(metallicity). as it is funneled to the centre of a galaxy, it will lead thecentral gas having an overall lower metallicity than gas further from thecentre, because the gas further out has been enriched by supernovae and stellarwinds, and not diluted by the primordial gas. here we report chemicalabundances across three rotationally-supported star-forming galaxies at z~3,only 2 gyr after the big bang. we find an 'inverse' gradient, with the central,star forming regions having a lower metallicity than less active ones, oppositeto what is seen in local galaxies. we conclude that the central gas has beendiluted by the accretion of primordial gas, as predicted by 'cold flow' models.

1012.3073	the spitzer/irac view of black hole - bulge scaling relations	we present a mid-ir investigation of the scaling relations betweensupermassive black hole masses (mbh) and the structural parameters of the hostspheroids in local galaxies. the work is based on two-dimensional bulge-diskdecompositions of spitzer/irac 3.6 um images of 57 galaxies with mbh estimates.our estimates of effective radii (re) and surface brightnesses, combined withvelocity dispersions (sigma) from the literature, define a fp relationconsistent with previous determinations but doubling the observed range in re.none of our galaxies is an outlier of the fp, demonstrating the accuracy of ourbulge-disk decomposition which also allows us to independently identifypseudobulges in our sample. we calibrate m/l at 3.6 um by using the tightmdyn-lbul relation (~0.1 dex of rms) and find that no color corrections arerequired to estimate the stellar mass. the 3.6 um luminosity is thus the besttracer of mstar yet studied. we then explore the connection between mbh andbulge structural parameters (luminosity, mass, effective radius). we find tightcorrelations of mbh with both 3.6 um bulge luminosity and dynamical mass(mbh/mdyn~1/1000), with rms of ~0.35 dex, similar to the mbh-sigma relation.our results are consistent with previous determinations at shorter wavelengths.by using our calibrated m/l, we rescale mbh-lbul to obtain the mbh-mstarrelation, which can be used as the local reference for high-z studies whichprobe the cosmic evolution of mbh-galaxy relations and where the stellar massis inferred directly from luminosity measurements. the analysis of pseudobulgesshows that 4 out of 9 lie on the scaling relations within the observed scatter,while those with small mbh are significantly displaced. we explore thedifferent origins for such behavior, while considering the possibility ofnuclear morphological components not reproduced by our two-dimensionaldecomposition.

1104.5023	the role of secular evolution in the black hole growth of narrow-line  seyfert 1 galaxies	narrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1) galaxies show extreme properties with respect tothe other seyfert galaxies. indeed, they are thought to be accreting ateddington rates and to possess low mass black holes. therefore, they mayrepresent a key class of objects for understanding the co-evolution of blackholes and their host galaxies. we propose that nls1s represent a class of agnin which the black hole growth is, and has always been, dominated by secularevolution. firstly, by looking at the nls1 host galaxy properties in theliterature, we show that the evolution of nls1s is presently driven by secularprocesses, much more so than for broad-line seyfert 1s (bls1s). secondly, westudy the bulges of nls1 and bls1 galaxies. our results demonstrate that nls1host bulges are pseudo-bulges and are statistically different from bls1 bulges.this difference points to the particular importance of secular processes in thepast evolution of their hosts. we build on this result to understand theimplications on their evolution and the duration of their duty cycle. we showthat nls1s are not necessarily in a special phase of black hole growth and thatseveral gyr are required for their black hole masses to become similar tobls1s. finally, in the light of our results, we discuss the location of nls1galaxies on the mbh-\sigma plane and speculate about the connection between thenls1 galaxy properties and their black hole spin.

0710.0300	the contribution of very massive high-redshift swire galaxies to the  stellar mass function	(abridged) we selected high-z massive galaxies at 5.8 microns, in the swireelais-s1 field (1 sq. deg.). galaxies with the 1.6 microns stellar peakredshifted into the irac bands (z~1-3, called ``ir-peakers'') were identified.stellar masses were derived by means of spectro-photometric fitting and used tocompute the stellar mass function (mf) at z=1-2 and 2-3. a parametric fit tothe mf was performed, based on a bayesian formalism, and the stellar massdensity of massive galaxies above z=2 determined. we present the firstsystematic study of the very-massive tail of the galaxy stellar mass functionat high redshift. a total of 326 sources were selected. the majority of thesegalaxies have stellar masses in excess of 1e11 msun and lie at z&gt;1.5. theavailability of mid-ir data turned out to be a valuable tool to constrain thecontribution of young stars to galaxy seds, and thus their m(stars)/l ratio.the influence of near-ir data and of the chosen stellar library on the sedfitting are also discussed. a significant evolution is found not only forgalaxies with m~1e11 msun, but also in the highest mass bins considered. thecomoving number density of these galaxies was lower by more than a factor of 10at z=2-3, with respect to the local estimate. swire 5.8 micron peakers moremassive than 1.6x1e11 msun provide 30-50% of the total stellar mass density ingalaxies at z=2-3.

1108.1057	a dynamical mass estimator for high z galaxies based on  spectroastrometry	galaxy dynamical masses are important physical quantities to constrain galaxyevolutionary models, especially at high redshifts. however, at z~2 the limitedsignal to noise ratio and spatial resolution of the data usually do not allowspatially resolved kinematical modeling and very often only virial masses canbe estimated from line widths. but even such estimates require a good knowledgeof galaxy size, which may be smaller than the spatial resolution.spectroastrometry is a technique which combines spatial and spectral resolutionto probe spatial scales significantly smaller than the spatial resolution ofthe observations. here we apply it to the case of high-z galaxies and present amethod based on spectroastrometry to estimate dynamical masses of high zgalaxies, which overcomes the problem of size determination with poor spatialresolution. we construct and calibrate a "spectroastrometric" virial massestimator, modifying the "classical" virial mass formula. we apply our methodto the [o iii] or h{\alpha} emission line detected in z~2-3 galaxies fromamaze, lsd and sins samples and we compare the spectroastrometric estimatorwith dynamical mass values resulting from full spatially resolved kinematicalmodeling. the spectroastrometric estimator is found to be a good approximationof dynamical masses, presenting a linear relation with a residual dispersion ofonly 0.15 dex. this is a big improvement compared to the "classical" virialmass estimator which has a non linear relation and much larger dispersion (0.47dex) compared to dynamical masses. by applying our calibrated estimator to 16galaxies from the amaze and lsd samples, we obtain masses in the ~10^7-10^10m\odot range extending the mass range attainable with dynamical modeling.

1112.3071	observational evidence of quasar feedback quenching star formation at  high redshift	most galaxy evolutionary models require quasar feedback to regulate starformation in their host galaxies. in particular, at high redshift, modelsexpect that feedback associated with quasar-driven outflows is so efficientthat the gas in the host galaxy is largely swept away or heated up, hencesuppressing star formation in massive galaxies. we observationally investigatethis phenomenon by using vlt-sinfoni integral field spectroscopy of theluminous quasar 2qzj002830.4-281706 at z=2.4. the spectra sample the opticalemission lines redshifted into the near-ir. the [oiii]5007 emission-linekinematics map reveals a massive outflow on scales of several kpc. thedetection of narrow halpha emission reveals star formation in the quasar hostgalaxy, with sfr=100 msun/yr. however, the star formation is not distributeduniformly, but is strongly suppressed in the region with the highest outflowvelocity and highest velocity dispersion. this result indicates that starformation in this region is strongly quenched by the quasar outflow, which iscleaning the galaxy disk of its molecular gas. this is one of the first directobservational proofs of quasar feedback quenching the star formation at highredshift.

1304.4940	a fundamental relation between the metallicity, gas content, and stellar  mass of local galaxies	recent results have suggested that the well known mass-metallicity relationhas a strong dependence on the star formation rate, to the extent that a threedimensional `fundamental metallicity relation' exists which links the threeparameters with minimal scatter. in this work, we use a sample of 4253 localgalaxies observed in atomic hydrogen from the alfalfa survey to demonstrate,for the first time, that a similar fundamental relation (the hi-fmr) alsoexists between stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity, and hi mass. this latterrelation is likely more fundamental, driving the relation between metallicity,sfr and mass. at intermediate masses, the behaviour of the gas fundamentalmetallicity relation is very similar to that expressed via the star formationrate. however, we find that the dependence of metallicity on hi contentpersists to the highest stellar masses, in contrast to the `saturation' ofmetallicity with sfr. it is interesting to note that the dispersion of therelation is very low at intermediate stellar masses (9&lt; log(m*/msun) &lt;11),suggesting that in this range galaxies evolve smoothy, in an equilibriumbetween gas inflow, outflow and star formation. at high and low stellar masses,the scatter of the relation is significantly higher, suggesting that mergingevents and/or stochastic accretion and star formation may drive galaxiesoutside the relation. we also assemble a sample of galaxies observed in co.however, due to a small sample size, strong selection bias, and the influenceof a metallicity-dependent co/h2 conversion factor, the data are insufficientto test any influence of molecular gas on metallicity.

1311.4576	metallicity evolution, metallicity gradients and gas fractions at z~3.4	we used near-infrared integral field spectroscopic observations from theamaze and lsd programs to constrain the metallicity in a sample of 40 starforming galaxies at 3&lt;z&lt;5 (most of which at z~3.4). we measure metallicities byexploiting strong emission line diagnostics. we found that a significantfraction of star-forming galaxies at z~3.4 deviate from the fundamentalmetallicity relation (fmr), with a metallicity up to a factor of ten lower thanexpected according to the fmr. this deviation does not correlate with thedynamical properties of the galaxy or with the presence of interactions. toinvestigate the origin of the metallicity deviations in more detail, we alsoinfer information on the gas content, by inverting the schmidt-kennicuttrelation. in agreement with recent co observational data, we found that, incontrast with the steeply rising trend at 0&lt;z&lt;2, the gas fraction in massivegalaxies remains constant, with indication of a marginal decline, at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5.when combined with the metallicity information, we infer that to explain boththe low metallicity and gas content in z~3.4 galaxies, both prominent outflowsand massive pristine gas inflows are needed. in ten galaxies we can alsospatially resolve the metallicity distribution. we found that the metallicitygenerally anticorrelates with the distribution of star formation and with thegas surface density. we discuss these findings in terms of pristine gas inflowstowards the center, and outflows of metal rich gas from the center toward theexternal regions.

1405.3664	dynamics and metallicity of far-ir selected galaxies	we present near-infrared integral field spectroscopy of ten herschel selectedgalaxies at z~1.5. from detailed mapping of the h$\alpha$ and [nii] emissionlines we trace the dynamics, star formation rates, metallicities and alsoinvestigate gas fractions for these galaxies. for a few galaxies thedistribution of star formation as traced by h$\alpha$ only traces a smallfraction of the stellar disc, which could be tracing recent minor mergingevents. the rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) continuum emission often has adistribution completely different from h$\alpha$, which warns about the use ofuv-sed based star formation tracers in these systems. our analysis of galaxydynamics shows that minor dynamical disruptions (e.g. minor merging) aregenerally not enough to cause a deviation from the established 'main sequence'relation. most galaxies are found to follow the fundamental metallicityrelation (fmr), although with large scatter. one galaxy, (a small satellitegalaxy of a massive companion) is found to deviate strongly from the fmr. thisdeviation is in nice agreement with the correlation recently discovered inlocal galaxies between gas metallicity and environment, which has been ascribedto enriched inter-galactic medium (igm) in dense environments, and thereforesuggests that here the igm was already significantly enriched by z~1.5.

1409.3976	recoiling supermassive black holes: a search in the nearby universe	the coalescence of a binary black hole can be accompanied by a largegravitational recoil due to anisotropic emission of gravitational waves. arecoiling supermassive black hole (sbh) can subsequently undergo long-livedoscillations in the potential well of its host galaxy, suggesting that offsetsbhs may be common in the cores of massive ellipticals. we have analyzed hstarchival images of 14 nearby core ellipticals, finding evidence for small($\lesssim 10$ pc) displacements between the agn (locating the sbh) and thecenter of the galaxy (the mean photocenter) in 10 of them. excluding objectsthat may be affected by large-scale isophotal asymmetries, we consider sixgalaxies to have detected displacements, including m87, where a displacementwas previously reported by batcheldor et al. 2010. in individual objects, thesedisplacements can be attributed to residual gravitational recoil oscillationsfollowing a major or minor merger within the last few gyr. for plausible mergerrates, however, there is a high probability of larger displacements than thoseobserved, if sbh coalescence took place in these galaxies. remarkably, theagn-photocenter displacements are approximately aligned with the radio sourceaxis in four of the six galaxies with displacements, including three of thefour having relatively powerful kpc-scale jets. this suggests intrinsicasymmetries in radio jet power as a possible displacement mechanism, althoughapproximate alignments are also expected for gravitational recoil. orbitalmotion in sbh binaries and interactions with massive perturbers can produce theobserved displacement amplitudes but do not offer a ready explanation for thealignments.

1410.5468	galaxy-wide outflows in z$\sim$1.5 luminous obscured qsos revealed  through nir slit-resolved spectroscopy	aims. the co-evolution of galaxies and super massive black holes (smbhs)requires that some sort of feedback mechanism is operating during the activegalactic nuclei (agn) phases. agn driven winds are the most likely candidatesfor such feedback mechanism, but direct observational evidence of theirexistence and of their effects on the host galaxies are still scarce and theirphysical origin is still hotly debated.  methods. x-shooter observations of a sample of x-ray selected, obscuredquasars at z$\sim$1.5, selected on the basis of their observed red colors andx-ray-to-optical flux ratio, have shown the presence of outflowing ionized gasidentified by broad [oiii] emission lines in 6 out of 8 objects, confirming theefficiency of the selection criteria. here we present slit-resolvedspectroscopy for the two brightest sources, xid2028 and xid5321, to study thecomplex emission and absorption line kinematics.  results. we detect outflow extended out to $\sim$ 10 kpc from the centralblack hole (bh), both as blueshifted and redshifted emission. interestingly, wealso detect kpc scale outflows in the [oii] emission lines and in the neutralgas component, traced by the sodium d and magnesium absorption lines,confirming that a substantial amount of the outflowing mass is in the form ofneutral gas.  conclusions. the measured gas velocities and the outflow kinetic powers,inferred under reasonable assumptions on the geometry and physical propertiesof these two systems, favor an agn origin for the observed winds.

1411.4208	blowin' in the wind: both `negative' and `positive' feedback in an  obscured high-z quasar	quasar feedback in the form of powerful outflows is invoked as a keymechanism to quench star formation in galaxies, preventing massive galaxies toover-grow and producing the red colors of ellipticals. on the other hand, somemodels are also requiring `positive' agn feedback, inducing star formation inthe host galaxy through enhanced gas pressure in the interstellar medium.however, finding observational evidence of the effects of both types offeedback is still one of the main challenges of extragalactic astronomy, as fewobservations of energetic and extended radiatively-driven winds are available.here we present sinfoni near infrared integral field spectroscopy of xid2028,an obscured, radio-quiet z=1.59 qso detected in the xmm-cosmos survey, in whichwe clearly resolve a fast (1500 km/s) and extended (up to 13 kpc from the blackhole) outflow in the [oiii] lines emitting gas, whose large velocity andoutflow rate are not sustainable by star formation only. the narrow componentof ha emission and the rest frame u band flux from hst-acs imaging enable tomap the current star formation in the host galaxy: both tracers independentlyshow that the outflow position lies in the center of an empty cavity surroundedby star forming regions on its edge. the outflow is therefore removing the gasfrom the host galaxy (`negative feedback'), but also triggering star formationby outflow induced pressure at the edges (`positive feedback'). xid2028represents the first example of a host galaxy showing both types of feedbacksimultaneously at work.

1502.00640	alma constraints on the faint millimetre source number counts and their  contribution to the cosmic infrared background	we have analysed 18 alma continuum maps in bands 6 and 7, with rms down to7.8$\mu$jy, to derive differential number counts down to 60$\mu$jy and100$\mu$jy at $\lambda=$1.3 mm and $\lambda=$1.1 mm, respectively. the areacovered by the combined fields is $\rm 9.5\times10^{-4}deg^2$ at 1.1mm and $\rm6.6\times10^{-4}deg^{2}$ at 1.3mm. we improved the source extraction method byrequiring that the dimension of the detected sources be consistent with thebeam size. this method enabled us to remove spurious detections that haveplagued the purity of the catalogues in previous studies. we detected 50 faintsources with s/n$&gt;$3.5 down to 60$\mu$jy, hence improving the statistics by afactor of four relative to previous studies. the inferred differential numbercounts are $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s)=1\times10^5~deg^2$ at a 1.1 mm flux $s_{\lambda= 1.1~mm} = 130~\mu$jy, and $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s)=1.1\times10^5~deg^2$ at a 1.3mm flux $\rm s_{\lambda = 1.3~mm} = 60~\mu$jy. at the faintest flux limits,i.e. 30$\mu$jy and 40$\mu$jy, we obtain upper limits on the differential numbercounts of $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s) &lt; 7\times10^5~deg^2$ and $\rmdn/d(log_{10}s)&lt;3\times10^5~deg^2$, respectively. our results provide a newlower limit to cib intensity of 17.2${\rm jy\ deg^{-2}}$ at 1.1mm and of12.9${\rm jy\ deg^{-2}}$ at 1.3mm. moreover, the flattening of the integratednumber counts at faint fluxes strongly suggests that we are probably close tothe cib intensity. our data imply that galaxies with sfr$&lt;40~m_{\odot}/yr$certainly contribute less than 50% to the cib while more than 50% of the cibmust be produced by galaxies with $\rm sfr&gt;40~m_{\odot}/yr$. the differentialnumber counts are in nice agreement with recent semi-analytical models ofgalaxy formation even as low as our faint fluxes. consequently, this supportsthe galaxy evolutionary scenarios and assumptions made in these models.

1503.01783	evidence for feedback in action from the molecular gas content in the  z~1.6 outflowing qso xid2028	gas outflows are believed to play a pivotal role in shaping galaxies, as theyregulate both star formation and black hole growth. despite their ubiquitouspresence, the origin and the acceleration mechanism of such powerful andextended winds is not yet understood. direct observations of the cold gascomponent in objects with detected outflows at other wavelengths are needed toassess the impact of the outflow on the host galaxy interstellar medium (ism).we observed with the plateau de bure interferometer an obscured quasar atz~1.5, xid2028, for which the presence of an ionised outflow has beenunambiguously signalled by nir spectroscopy. the detection of co(3-2) emissionin this source allows us to infer the molecular gas content and compare it tothe ism mass derived from the dust emission. we then analyze the results in thecontext of recent insights on scaling relations, which describe the gas contentof the overall population of star-forming galaxies at a similar redshifts. thestar formation efficiency (~100) and gas mass (m_gas=2.1-9.5x10^{10} m_sun)inferred from the co(3-2) line depend on the underlying assumptions on theexcitation of the transition and the co-to-h2 conversion factor. however, thecombination of this information and the ism mass estimated from the dust masssuggests that the ism/gas content of xid2028 is significantly lower thanexpected for its observed m$_\star$, ssfr and redshift, based on the mostup-to-date calibrations (with gas fraction &lt;20% and depletion time scale &lt;340myr). overall, the constraints we obtain from the far infrared and millimeterdata suggest that we are observing qso feedback able to remove the gas from thehost

1506.03096	ionised outflows in z $\sim$ 2.4 quasar host galaxies	agn-driven outflows are invoked by galaxy evolutionary models to quench starformation and to explain the origin of the relations observed locally betweensuper massive black holes and their host galaxies. this work aims to detect thepresence of extended ionised outflows in luminous quasars where we expect themaximum activity both in star formation and in black hole accretion. currently,there are only a few studies based on spatially resolved observations ofoutflows at high redshift, $z&gt;2$. we analyse a sample of six luminous (${\rml&gt;10^{47} \ erg/s}$) quasars at $z\sim2.4$, observed in h-band using thenear-ir integral field spectrometer sinfoni at vlt. we perform a kinematicanalysis of the [oiii] emission line at $\lambda = 5007\aa$. [oiii] has acomplex gas kinematic, with blue-shifted velocities of a few hundreds of km/sand line widths up to 1500 km/s. using the spectroastrometric method we infersize of the ionised outflows of up to $\sim$2 kpc. the properties of theionised outflows, mass outflow rate, momentum rate and kinetic power, arecorrelated with the agn luminosity. the increase in outflow rate withincreasing agn luminosity is consistent with the idea that a luminous agnpushes away the surrounding gas through fast outflows driven by radiationpressure, which depends on the emitted luminosity. we derive mass outflow ratesof about 6-700 m$_{\odot}$/yr for our sample, which are lower than thoseobserved in molecular outflows. indeed physical properties of ionised outflowsshow dependences on agn luminosity which are similar to those of molecularoutflows but indicating that the mass of ionised gas is smaller than that ofthe molecular one. alternatively, this discrepancy between ionised andmolecular outflows could be explained with different acceleration mechanisms.

1509.06068	hunting for planets in the hl tau disk	recent alma images of hl tau show gaps in the dusty disk that may be causedby planetary bodies. given the young age of this system, if confirmed, thisfinding would imply very short timescales for planet formation, probably in agravitationally unstable disk. to test this scenario, we searched for youngplanets by means of direct imaging in the l'-band using the large binoculartelescope interferometer mid-infrared camera. at the location of two prominentdips in the dust distribution at ~70au (~0.5") from the central star we reach acontrast level of ~7.5mag. we did not detect any point source at the locationof the rings. using evolutionary models we derive upper limits of ~10-15mjup at&lt;=0.5-1ma for the possible planets. with these sensitivity limits we shouldhave been able to detect companions sufficiently massive to open full gaps inthe disk. the structures detected at mm-wavelengths could be gaps in thedistributions of large grains on the disk midplane, caused by planets notmassive enough to fully open gaps. future alma observations of the moleculargas density profile and kinematics as well as higher contrast infraredobservations may be able to provide a definitive answer.

astro-ph;0007435	hst infrared imaging polarimetry of centaurus a: implications for the  unified scheme and the existence of a mis-directed bl lac nucleus	we report results from hst/nicmos 2 micron imaging polarimetry of the centralregion of centaurus a. in the vicinity of the nucleus we observe a complexpolarization structure which we explain by a combination of scattering ofnuclear light and dichroic polarization associated with the dust lane. thescattered nuclear radiation is found in an angular region which extends over ~70 degrees and thus it does not originate from a highly collimated beam, but isassociated with more omni-directional nuclear illumination. these observationsalso show the presence of an unresolved, highly polarized (p = 11.1 %) nuclearsource whose polarization angle pa = 148.2 degrees is perpendicular to the jetaxis. we set an upper limit of 0.04'' (~0.8 pc) to its extent. the observednuclear polarization is naturally accounted for if we are observing scatteredlight from an otherwise obscured nucleus provided that both the scatteringregion and the occulting torus are extremely compact, with an outer radius ofless than ~ 1 pc. alternatively, we might be directly seeing the infraredcounterpart of the radio core, similar to those found in other low luminosityradio-galaxies observed with hst. we discuss these results in the framework ofthe fri / bl lac unifying model.

astro-ph;0010009	dust in active nuclei. i. evidence for "anomalous" properties	we present observational evidences that dust in the circumnuclear region ofagns has different properties than in the galactic diffuse interstellar medium.by comparing the reddening of optical and infrared broad lines and the x-rayabsorbing column density we find that the e(b-v)/n_h ratio is nearly alwayslower than galactic by a factor ranging from ~3 up to ~100. other observationalresults indicate that the av/n_h ratio is significantly lower than galactic invarious classes of agns including intermediate type 1.8-1.9 seyferts, hardx-ray selected and radio selected quasars, broad absorption line qsos and grismselected qsos. the lack of prominent absorption features at 9.7um (silicates)and at 2175a (carbon dip) in the spectra of seyfert 2s and of reddened seyfert1s, respectively, add further evidence for dust in the circumnuclear region ofagns being different from galactic.  these observational results indicate that the dust composition in thecircumnuclear region of agns could be dominated by large grains, which make theextinction curve flatter, featureless and are responsible for the reduction ofthe e(b-v)/n_h and av/n_h ratios.  regardless of the physical origin of these phenomena, the reduced dustabsorption with respect to what expected from the gaseous column density shouldwarn about a mismatch between the optical and the x-ray classification of theactive galactic nuclei in terms of their obscuration.

astro-ph;0010066	dust in active nuclei. ii. powder or gravel?	in a companion paper, maiolino et al. (2000) presented various observationalevidences for "anomalous" dust properties in the circumnuclear region of agnsand, in particular, the reduced e(b-v)/n_h and av/n_h ratios, the absence ofthe silicate absorption feature in mid-ir spectra of sy2s and the absence ofthe carbon dip in uv spectra of reddened sy1s. in this paper we discuss variousexplanations for these facts.  the observational constraints favor a scenario where coagulation, catalyzedby the high densities in the circumnuclear region, yields to the formation oflarge grains. the resulting extinction curve is featureless, flatter thangalactic and the e(b-v)/n_h and av/n_h ratios are significantly reduced. theseresults should warn about an unappropriate use of the standard galacticextinction curve and av/n_h ratio when dealing with the extreme gas conditionstypical of the circumnuclear clouds of agns.  we also investigated alternative scenarios for the observed anomalousproperties of dust in agns. some of these scenarios might explain some of theobserved properties for a few objects, but they generally fail to account forall of the observational constraints obtained for the large sample of agnsstudied in these works.

astro-ph;0105271	hst imaging in the chandra deep field south: i. multiple agn populations	we present preliminary results from imaging three hst/wfpc2 fields in v and iwithin the chandra deep field south (cdfs). hst's sensitivity and resolutionare sufficient to reveal optical counterparts for 24 of the 26 cdfs x-raysources detected in the 300 ksec x-ray catalog and to determine themorphologies of most of these. we find that the x-ray sources comprise twoapparently distinct populations of optical candidates: one optically faint (i &gt;24) with v - i colors consistent with the i &gt; 24 field population; the othersignificantly brighter (i &lt; 22) with colors redder than the i &lt; 22 fieldpopulation. more than 2/3 of the x-ray source counterparts are resolvedgalaxies. the brighter sources are mostly agn, based on their high x-rayluminosity. the optically resolved sources in the brighter population have avery narrow range of v - i color and appear to be a mix of both late and earlytype morphologies at low to moderate redshift. we show that the secondpopulation, with fainter optical counterparts, can be explained as higherredshift type 2 agn.

astro-ph;0106192	the ly-edge paradox and the need for obscured qsos	based on the most recent qso ultraviolet spectra, the covering factor of theclouds of the broad line region (blr) is about 30%, or larger. this value wouldimply that in at least 30% of the qsos our line of sight crosses one, or more,blr clouds and, in the latter case, the uv spectrum should show a sharp ly-edgein absorption. this ly-edge in absorption is never observed. this paradox issolved if, as suggested by various authors, the blr is flattened and the dustygas in the outer parts, on the same plane, prevents the observation along thelines of sight passing through the blr clouds. the objects observed edge-on(with respect to the flattened blr) would be classified as obscured qsos or,within the framework of the unified model, type 2 qsos. the covering factor ofthe blr constrains the fraction of obscured qsos to be qso2/qso1 &gt; 0.5. thislower limit is already high with respect to the number of candidate type 2 qsosclaimed so far. we discuss this constraint in relation to recent agn surveys.

astro-ph;0110385	hst imaging in the chandra deep field south: ii. wfpc2 observations of  an x-ray flux-limited sample from the 1 msec chandra catalog	we present hst/wfpc2 observations of a well-defined sample of 40 x-raysources with x-ray fluxes above the detection threshold of the full 1 msecchandra deep field south (cdfs). the sensitivity and spatial resolution of ourhst observations are sufficient to detect the optical counterparts of 37 of thex-ray sources, yielding information on their morphologies and environments. inthis paper we extend the results obtained in our previous study on the 300 kscdfs x-ray data (schreier et al. 2001, paper i). specifically, we show that theoptical counterparts to the x-ray sources are divided into two distinctpopulations: 1) an optically faint group with relatively blue colors, similarto the faint blue field galaxy population, and 2) an optically brighter group,including resolved galaxies with average colors significantly redder than thecorresponding bright field galaxy population. the brighter objects comprise awide range of types, including early and late type galaxies, starbursts, andagn. by contrast, we show that the faint blue x-ray population are mostconsistent with being predominantly type 2 agn of low to moderate luminosity,located at higher redshifts (z ~ 1 - 2). this conclusion is supported byluminosity function models of the various classes of objects. hence, thecombination of deep x-ray data with the high spatial resolution of hst are forthe first time allowing us to probe the faint end of the agn luminosityfunction at cosmologically interesting redshifts.

astro-ph;0211650	is there really a black hole at the center of ngc 4041? - constraints  from gas kinematics	we present hst/stis spectra of the sbc spiral galaxy ngc 4041 which were usedto map the velocity field of the gas in its nuclear region. we detect thepresence of a compact (r~0.4" ~40 pc), high surface brightness, rotatingnuclear disk co-spatial with a nuclear star cluster. the disk is characterizedby a rotation curve with a peak to peak amplitude of ~40 km/s and issystematically blueshifted by 10 - 20 km/s with respect to the galaxy systemicvelocity. with the standard assumption of constant mass-to-light ratio and withthe nuclear disk inclination taken from the outer disk, we find that a darkpoint mass of 1(-0.7;+0.6) 10^7 msun is needed to reproduce the observedrotation curve. however the observed blueshift suggests the possibility thatthe nuclear disk could be dynamically decoupled. following this line ofreasoning we relax the standard assumptions and find that the kinematical datacan be accounted for by the stellar mass provided that either the centralmass-to-light ratio is increased by a factor of ~2 or that the inclination isallowed to vary. this model results in a 3 sigma upper limit of 6 10^6 msun onthe mass of any nuclear black hole. overall, our analysis only allows us to setan upper limit of 2 10^7 msun on the mass of the nuclear black hole. if thisupper limit is taken in conjunction with an estimated bulge b magnitude of-17.7 and with a central stellar velocity dispersion of 95 km/s, then theseresults are not inconsistent with both the mbh-lsph and the mbh-sigmacorrelations. constraints on black hole masses in spiral galaxies of types aslate as sbc are still very scarce and therefore the present result adds animportant new datapoint to our understanding of black hole demography.

astro-ph;0302513	spectroscopy of the near-nuclear regions of cygnus a: estimating the  mass of the supermassive black hole	we use a combination of high spatial resolution optical and near-irspectroscopic data to make a detailed study of the kinematics of the nlr gas inthe near-nuclear regions of the powerful, frii radio galaxy cygnus a(z=0.0560), with the overall goal of placing limits on the mass of anysupermassive black hole in the core. our k-band infrared observations (0.75arcsec seeing) -- taken with nirspec on the keck ii telescope -- show a smoothrotation pattern across the nucleus in the paschen alpha and h_2 emission linesalong a slit position (pa180) close to perpendicular to the radio axis,however, there is no evidence for such rotation along the radio axis (pa105).higher spatial resolution observations of the [oiii]5007 emission line -- takenwith stis on the hubble space telescope (hst) -- confirm the general rotationpattern of the gas in the direction perpendicular to the radio axis, andprovide evidence for steep velocity gradients within a radius of 0.1 arcsec ofthe core. the circular velocities measured from both the keck and hst data leadto an estimate of the mass of the supermassive black hole of 2.5+/-0.7x10^9solar masses. for the host galaxy properties of cygnus a, this mass isconsistent with the global correlations between black hole mass and host galaxyproperties deduced for non-active galaxies. therefore, despite the extremepower of its radio source and the quasar-like luminosity of its agn, the blackhole in cygnus a is not unusually massive considering theluminosity of its hostgalaxy. indeed, the estimated mass of the black hole in cygnus a is similar tothat inferred for the supermassive black hole in the fri radio galaxy m87,despite the fact that the agn and radio jets of cygnus a are 2 -- 3 orders ofmagnitude more powerful.

astro-ph;0311619	local supermassive black holes, relics of active galactic nuclei and the  x-ray background	we quantify the importance of mass accretion during agn phases in the growthof supermassive black holes (bh) by comparing the mass function of black holesin the local universe with that expected from agn relics, which are black holesgrown entirely with mass accretion during agn phases. the local bh massfunction (bhmf) is estimated by applying the well-known correlations between bhmass, bulge luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity andvelocity functions. the density of bh's in the local universe is 4.6 (-1.4;+1.9) (h/0.7)^2 10^5 msun mpc^-3. the relic bhmf is derived from the continuityequation with the only assumption that agn activity is due to accretion ontomassive bh's and that merging is not important. we find that the relic bhmf atz=0 is generated mainly at z&lt;3. moreover, the bh growth is anti-hierarchical inthe sense that smaller bh's (mbh&lt; 10^7 msun) grow at lower redshifts (z&lt;1) withrespect to more massive one's (z~1-3). unlike previous work, we find that thebhmf of agn relics is perfectly consistent with the local bhmf indicating thelocal bh's were mainly grown during agn activity. this agreement is obtainedwhile satisfying, at the same time, the constraints imposed from the x-raybackground. the comparison with the local bhmf also suggests that the mergingprocess is not important in shaping the relic bhmf, at least at low redshifts(z&lt;3). our analysis thus suggests the following scenario: local black holesgrew during agn phases in which accreting matter was converted into radiationwith efficiencies epsilon = 0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction lambda =0.1-1.7 of the eddington luminosity. the average total lifetime of these activephases ranges from ~4.5 10^8 yr for mbh&lt; 10^8 msun to ~1.5 10^8 yr for mbh&gt;10^9 msun.

astro-ph;0409542	local supermassive black holes and relics of active galactic nuclei	we summarize a study where we test the hypothesis that local black holes (bh)are relics of agn activity. we compare the mass function of bhs in the localuniverse with that expected from agn relics, which are bhs grown entirely withmass accretion during agn phases. the local bh mass function (bhmf) isestimated by applying the well-known correlations between bh mass, bulgeluminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity and velocityfunctions. the density of bhs in the local universe is 4.6 (-1.4;+1.9) 10^5msun mpc-3. the relic bhmf is derived from the continuity equation with theonly assumption that agn activity is due to accretion onto massive bhs and thatmerging is not important. we find that the relic bhmf at z=0 is generatedmainly at z&lt;3. moreover, the bh growth is anti-hierarchical in the sense thatsmaller bhs (mbh&lt;10^7 msun) grow at lower redshifts (z&lt;1) with respect to moremassive ones (z~1-3). unlike previous work, we find that the bhmf of agn relicsis perfectly consistent with the local bhmf indicating the local bhs weremainly grown during agn activity. this agreement is obtained while satisfying,at the same time, the constraints imposed by the x-ray background. thecomparison with the local bhmf also suggests that the merging process is notimportant in shaping the relic bhmf, at least at low redshifts (z&lt;3). ouranalysis thus suggests the following scenario: local bhs grew during agn phasesin which accreting matter was converted into radiation with efficiencieseff=0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction lambda=0.1-1.7 of the eddingtonluminosity. the average total lifetime of these active phases ranges from ~4.510^8 yr for mbh&lt;10^7 msun to ~1.5 10^8 yr for mbh&gt;10^9 msun.

astro-ph;0503693	nuclear properties of nearby spiral galaxies from hubble space telescope  nicmos imaging and stis spectroscopy	we investigate the central regions of 23 spiral galaxies using archivalnicmos imaging and stis spectroscopy. the sample is taken from our program todetermine the masses of central massive black holes (mbh) in 54 nearby spiralgalaxies. stars are likely to contribute significantly to any dynamical centralmass concentration that we find in our mbh program and this paper is part of aseries to investigate the nuclear properties of these galaxies. we use thenuker law to fit surface brightness profiles, derived from the nicmos images,to look for nuclear star clusters and find possible extended sources in 3 ofthe 23 galaxies studied (13 per cent). the fact that this fraction is lowerthan that inferred from optical hubble space telescope studies is probably dueto the greater spatial resolution of those studies. using r-h and j-h colorsand equivalent widths of h-alpha emission (from the stis spectra) weinvestigate the nature of the stellar population with evolutionary models.under the assumption of hot stars ionizing the gas, as opposed to a weak agn,we find that there are young stellar populations (~10-20 myr) however thesedata do not allow us to determine what percentage of the total nuclear stellarpopulation they form. also, in an attempt to find any unknown agn we use [n ii]and [s ii] line flux ratios (relative to h-alpha) and find tentative evidencefor weak agn in ngc 1300 and ngc 4536.

astro-ph;0507435	the supermassive black hole in centaurus a: a benchmark for gas  kinematical measurements	we present new hst/stis observations of centaurus a. [siii] 9533a was used tostudy the kinematics in the nuclear region with a 0.1" spatial resolution. thestis data and the vlt/isaac spectra by marconi et al. (2001) provideindependent and consistent measures of the bh mass, which are in agreement withour previous estimate based on the isaac data alone: mbh=(1.1+/-0.1) 10^8 msunfor a disk inclination of i=25deg or or mbh=(6.5+/-0.7) 10^7 msun for i=35deg,the largest i value allowed by the data. we find that the choice of theintrinsic surface brightness distribution, a crucial element in the modeling,has no effects on mbh but has a large impact on the gas velocity dispersion. amismatch between the observed and model velocity dispersion is not necessarilyan indication of non-circular motions or kinematically hot gas, but is aseasily due to an inaccurate computation arising from too course a model grid,or the adoption of an intrinsic brightness distribution which is too smooth.the observed velocity dispersion, line profiles and the higher order moments inthe hermite expansion, h_3 and h_4, are consistent with emission from arotating disk. results from gas kinematical estimate are in good agreement witha recent stellar dynamical estimate of mbh. the bh mass in centaurus a agreeswith the correlation with infrared luminosity and mass of the host spheroid butis not in disagreement with the stellar velocity dispersion if one takes intoaccount the intrinsic scatter of the mbh-sigma correlation. finally, using hstdata we can constrain the size of any cluster of dark objects alternative to abh to r&lt;0.035" (~0.6pc). thus centaurus a ranks among the best cases forsupermassive black holes in galactic nuclei.

astro-ph;0603261	metals and dust in high redshift agns	we summarize some recent results on the metallicity and dust properties ofactive galactic nuclei (agn) at high redshift (1&lt;z&lt;6.4). by using the spectraof more than 5000 qsos from the sdss we find no evidence for any metallicityevolution in the redshift range 2&lt;z&lt;4.5, while there is a significantluminosity-metallicity dependence. these results are confirmed by the spectraof a smaller sample of narrow line agns at high-z (qso2s and radio galaxies).the lack of metallicity evolution is interpreted both as a consequence of thecosmic downsizing and as a selection effect resulting from the joint qso-galaxyevolution. the luminosity-metallicity relation is interpreted as a consequenceof the mass-metallicity relation in the host galaxies of qsos, but arelationship with the accretion rate is also possible. the lack of metallicityevolution is observed even in the spectra of the most distant qsos known (z~6).this result is particularly surprising for elements such as fe, c and si, whichare subject to a delayed enrichment, and requires that the hosts of these qsosformed in short bursts and at very high redshift (z&gt;10). the properties of dustin high-z qsos are discussed within the context of the dust productionmechanisms in the early universe. the dust extinction curve is observed toevolve beyond z&gt;4, and by z~6 it is well described by the properties expectedfor dust produced by sne, suggesting that the latter is the main mechanism ofdust production in the early universe. we also show that the huge dust massesobserved in distant qsos can be accounted for by sn dust within theobservational constraints currently available. finally, we show that qso winds,which have been proposed as an alternative mechanism of dust production, mayalso contribute significantly to the total dust budget at high redshift.

astro-ph;9711054	spectropolarimetry of the circinus galaxy	high quality 4500-6800 a spectropolarimetric observations of the circinusgalaxy are reported. these show polarized and relatively broad (fwhm~3300 km/s)halpha (as well as marginal hbeta) arising from a &lt;3" (&lt;60 pc) region centeredon the nucleus and coincident with the the peak of the narrow line region.broad halpha might also be present ~8" (160 pc) se from the nucleus and closeto the dust lane, but the result is only marginal and should be verified byhigher s/n data. the continuum is dominated by stellar emission with &lt;3%contribution from the scattered agn continuum, and all the light (i.e. all thestellar continuum and narrow lines) is polarized, most probably by transmissionthrough and scattering by dust in the disk. the data are compatible with asimple model where the scattered broad lines and agn emission are quitepolarized (p~25%) but account for only 1% of the observed continuum. thescattered broad halpha has an equivalent width ew~400 a, a flux similar to thenarrow halpha and a luminosity ~5 10^5 lo. assuming an efficiency of 1% for theblr mirror, the intrinsic luminosity of the broad halpha is roughly 5 10^7 loand ~0.5% of the fir luminosity, a ratio similar to those found in type 1seyferts. specific prediction for future observations are also presented.

astro-ph;9801253	jet driven motions in the narrow line region of ngc1068	we have obtained hst foc f/48 long-slit spectroscopy of the inner 4" of thenarrow line region of ngc 1068 between 3500-5400a with a spectral resolution of1.78a/pixel. at a spatial scale of 0.0287" per pixel these data provide anorder of magnitude improvement in resolution over previous ground based spectraand allow us to trace the interaction between the radio jet and the gas in thenlr. our results show that, within +/-0.5" of the radio-jet the emission linesare kinematically disturbed and split into two components whose velocityseparation is 1500 km/sec. the filaments associated with the radio lobe alsoshow a redshifted kinematic disturbance of the order of 300 km/sec whichprobably is a consequence of the expansion of the radio plasma.  furthermore, the material enveloping the radio-jet is in a much higherionization state than that of the surrounding nlr gas. the highest excitationis coincident with the jet axis where emission in the coronal line of [fevii]3769a is detected and the heii 4686a is strong but where [oii] 3727a isdepressed. this large localized increase in ionization on the jet axis isaccompanied by the presence of an excess continuum. because the electrondensity is substantially larger in the jet compared to the surrounding nlr,these results can only be explained if there is a more intense ionizingcontinuum associated with the jet. this can be accomplished in a variety ofways which include an intrinsically anisotropic nuclear radiation field, areduced gas covering factor or the presence of a local ionization source.  the morphology, kinematics and, possibly, the ionization structure of the nlrin the vicinity of the jet of ngc 1068 are a direct consequence of theinteraction with the radio outflow.

astro-ph;9811083	a near-infrared study of the planetary nebula ngc 2346	this paper presents new near-infrared observations of the planetary nebulangc 2346. the data include a broad k-band image, an image in the h2vibrationally excited 1-0s(1) line and k band slit spectra at three positionsin the nebula. in the h2 1-0s(1) line, the nebula is characterized by acentral, bright torus, surrounded by weaker emission with a typical butterflyshape, as seen in halpha and co lines. the k band spectra show 11 h2 lines withexcitation energies from 6150 to 12552 k. the h2 data have been compared to thepredictions of models which follow the evolution with time of the h2 emissionin pne of different core mass and shell properties (natta &amp; hollenbach 1998).these models compute the emission originating in the photodissociation region(pdr) created at the inner edge of the neutral shell by the uv radiation of thecentral core, as well as the emission in the shock associated to the expansionof the shell inside the precursor red-giant wind. in ngc 2346, a pdr origin ofthe h2 emission in a low-density molecular shell (n&lt;~10^4 cm^-3) is indicated.at these low densities, time-dependent h2 chemistry and x-ray heating of theneutral gas enhance the predicted pdr h2 line intensity by large factors.

astro-ph;9811177	metal abundances and excitation of extranuclear clouds in the circinus  galaxy -- a new method for deriving abundances of agn narrow line clouds	spectra of extranuclear clouds within the ionization cone of circinus galaxyare presented and modelled assuming photoionization by the seyfert 2 nucleusbut no preconceived assumption concerning the spectral shape of the ionizingagn radiation or the gas density distribution.  the most important result is that, regardless of the assumed agn spectralshape or density distribution, the metal abundances are remarkably well (+/-0.2dex) constrained by the data. oxygen and neon are found to be a factor of 5below solar, while nitrogen is solar. the large n/o overabundance is inagreement with the chemical enrichment expected from the old (circum)nuclearstarburst. similar studies of extranuclear clouds in other objects couldtherefore provide a powerful tool to determine metallicities and trace paststarburst activity in agns.  other implications such as the role of shock excitation, which is effectivelyexcluded, and the intrinsic shape of the agn ionizing continuum, which ispoorly constrained by the data, are also discussed.

astro-ph;9811381	the origin of the narrow line region of mrk 3: an overpressured jet  cocoon	we have obtained hst foc long-slit optical spectroscopy of the narrow lineregion of the seyfert 2 galaxy mrk 3. in the region cospatial with theradio-jet the velocity field is highly perturbed and shows two velocity systemsseparated by as much as 1700 km/s. we interpret this to be the consequence ofthe rapid expansion of a cocoon of hot gas, shocked and heated by theradio-emitting outflow, which compresses and accelerates the ambient gas. thenlr itself is essentially a cylindrical shell expanding supersonically. fromthe size and velocity of the expanding region, we derive an upper limit to theradio-source age, ~&lt; 1.5 e5 years, and a lower limit for the jet power, ~&gt; 2e42 erg/s required to inflate the cocoon and estimate that the jet minimumadvance speed is 3 e-3 pc per year. the total kinetic energy of the highvelocity nlr gas can be estimated as ~6 e54 erg, comparable to the total energycarried by the jet over its lifetime and this quantitatively supports the ideathat the nlr gas is accelerated by the jet. if the advance speed of mrk 3 isrepresentative of the seyfert population then these sources must also be shortlived and probably recurrent. the jet kinetic luminosity of mrk 3 is between 2and 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that derived for radio-loud agns withsimilar emission-line luminosity. on the other hand, the fraction of jet powerdissipated in radio-emission is similar. we speculate that the main distinctionbetween radio-quiet and radio-loud agn is ascribed to a difference in jet powerrather than to a different efficiency in synchrotron emission production.

astro-ph;9901415	hst foc spectroscopy of the nlr of ngc 4151. i. gas kinematics	we present the results from a detailed kinematic analysis of bothground-based, and hubble space telescope/faint object camera long-slitspectroscopy at sub-arcsec spatial resolution, of the narrow-line region of ngc4151. in agreement with previous work, the extended emission gas (r &gt; 4") isfound to be in normal rotation in the galactic plane, a behaviour that we wereable to trace even across the nuclear region, where the gas is stronglydisturbed by the interaction with the radio jet, and connects smoothly with thelarge scale rotation defined by the neutral gas emission. the hst data, at0.029" spatial resolution, allow us for the first time to truly isolate thekinematic behaviour of the individual clouds in the inner narrow-line region.we find that, underlying the perturbations introduced by the radio ejecta, thegeneral velocity field can still be well represented by planar rotation down toa radius of ~ 0.5" (30 pc), distance at which the rotation curve has itsturnover.  the most striking result that emerges from our analysis is that the galaxypotential derived fitting the rotation curve changes from a "dark halo" at theenlr distances to dominated by the central mass concentration in the nlr, withan almost keplerian fall-off in the 1"&lt; r &lt; 4" interval. the observed velocityof the gas at 0.5" implies a mass of m ~ 10e9 m(sol) within the inner 60 pc.the presence of a turnover in the rotation curve indicates that this centralmass concentration is extended. the first measured velocity point (outside theregion saturated by the nucleus) would imply an enclosed mass of ~ 5e7 m(sol)within r ~ 0.15" (10 pc) which represents an upper limit to any nuclear pointmass.

astro-ph;9905261	soft x-ray spectroscopy of compton-thick seyfert 2 galaxies with  bepposax	we present a x-ray spectroscopic study of the bright compton-thick seyfert 2sngc1068 and the circinus galaxy, performed with bepposax. matt et al. (1997 and1998) interpreted the spectrum above 4 kev as the superposition of comptonreflection and warm plasma scattering of the nuclear radiation. when thiscontinuum is extrapolated downwards to 0.1 kev, further components arise. thengc1068 spectrum is rich in emission lines, mainly due to k-alpha transitionsof he-like elements from oxygen to iron, plus a k-alpha fluorescent line fromneutral iron. if the ionized lines originate in the warm scatterer, its thermaland ionization structure must be complex. from the continuum and lineproperties, we estimate a column density, of the warm scatterer less than a few10^21 atoms/cm/cm. in the circinus galaxy, the absence of highly ionized ironis consistent with a scattering medium with ionization parameter u&lt;5 anddensity about a few times 10^22 atoms/cm/cm. in both cases the neutral ironline is most naturally explained as fluorescence in the medium responsible forthe compton reflection continuum. in ngc1068 an optically thin plasma emissionwith kt~500 ev and strongly sub-solar metallicity is required, while such acomponent is only marginal in the circinus galaxy. we tentatively identify thiscomponent as emission of diffuse hot gas in the nuclear starbursts. possiblecauses for the metal depletion are discussed.
