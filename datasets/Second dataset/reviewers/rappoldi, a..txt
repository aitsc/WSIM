0902.2959	first agile catalog of high confidence gamma-ray sources	we present the first catalog of high-confidence gamma-ray sources detected bythe agile satellite during observations performed from july 9, 2007 to june 30,2008. catalogued sources are detected by merging all the available data overthe entire time period. agile, launched in april 2007, is an asi missiondevoted to gamma-ray observations in the 30 mev - 50 gev energy range, withsimultaneous x-ray imaging capability in the 18-60 kev band. this catalog isbased on gamma-ray imaging detector (grid) data for energies greater than 100mev. for the first agile catalog we adopted a conservative analysis, with ahigh-quality event filter optimized to select gamma-ray events within thecentral zone of the instrument field of view (radius of 40 degrees). this is asignificance-limited (4 sigma) catalog, and it is not a complete flux-limitedsample due to the non-uniform first year agile sky coverage. the catalogincludes 47 sources, 21 of which are associated with confirmed or candidatepulsars, 13 with blazars (7 fsrq, 4 bl lacs, 2 unknown type), 2 with hmxrbs, 2with snrs, 1 with a colliding-wind binary system, 8 with unidentified sources.

0704.1422	a new, very massive modular liquid argon imaging chamber to detect low  energy off-axis neutrinos from the cngs beam. (project modular)	the paper is considering an opportunity for the cern/gransasso (cngs)neutrino complex, concurrent time-wise with t2k and nova, to search fortheta_13 oscillations and cp violation. compared with large water cherenkov(t2k) and fine grained scintillators (nova), the lar-tpc offers a higherdetection efficiency and a lower backgrounds, since virtually all channels maybe unambiguously recognized. the present proposal, called modular, describes a20 kt fiducial volume lar-tpc, following very closely the technology developedfor the icarus-t60o, and is focused on the following activities, for which weseek an extended international collaboration:  (1) the neutrino beam from the cern 400 gev proton beam and an optimised hornfocussing, eventually with an increased intensity in the framework of the lhcaccelerator improvement program;  (2) a new experimental area lngs-b, of at least 50000 m3 at 10 km off-axisfrom the main laboratory, eventually upgradable to larger sizes. a location isunder consideration at about 1.2 km equivalent water depth;  (3) a new lar imaging detector of at least 20 kt fiducial mass. such anincrease in the volume over the current icarus t600 needs to be carefullyconsidered. it is concluded that a very large mass is best realised with a setof many identical, independent units, each of 5 kt, "cloning" the technology ofthe t600. further phases may foresee extensions of modular to meet futurephysics goals.  the experiment might reasonably be operational in about 4/5 years, provided anew hall is excavated in the vicinity of the gran sasso laboratory and adequatefunding and participation are made available.

0909.3484	agile detection of a rapid gamma-ray flare from the blazar pks 1510-089  during the gasp-webt monitoring	we report the detection by the agile satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flarefrom the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089, during a pointing centered onthe galactic center region from 1 march to 30 march 2008. this source has beencontinuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the glast-agile supportprogram (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). moreover, thegamma-ray flaring episode triggered three too observations by the swiftsatellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 march 2008. in the period1-16 march 2008, agile detected gamma-ray emission from pks 1510-089 at asignificance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 mev.after a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 march 2008, agiledetected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux(e &gt; 100 mev) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak levelof (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. duringthe observing period january-april 2008, the source also showed an intense andvariable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significantincrease of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. moreover, in thex-ray band the swift/xrt observations seem to show an harder-when-brighterbehaviour of the source spectrum. the spectral energy distribution of mid-march2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton emissionplus contributions from inverse compton scattering of external photons fromboth the accretion disc and the broad line region. indeed, some features in theoptical-uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert-like components,such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

0910.5344	discovery of extreme particle acceleration in the microquasar cygnus x-3	the study of relativistic particle acceleration is a major topic ofhigh-energy astrophysics. it is well known that massive black holes in activegalaxies can release a substantial fraction of their accretion power intoenergetic particles, producing gamma-rays and relativistic jets. galacticmicroquasars (hosting a compact star of 1-10 solar masses which accretes matterfrom a binary companion) also produce relativistic jets. however, no directevidence of particle acceleration above gev energies has ever been obtained inmicroquasar ejections, leaving open the issue of the occurrence and timing ofextreme matter energization during jet formation. here we report the detectionof transient gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from the microquasar cygnus x-3,an exceptional x-ray binary which sporadically produces powerful radio jets.four gamma-ray flares (each lasting 1-2 days) were detected by the agilesatellite simultaneously with special spectral states of cygnus x-3 during theperiod mid-2007/mid-2009. our observations show that very efficient particleacceleration and gamma-ray propagation out of the inner disk of a microquasarusually occur a few days before major relativistic jet ejections. flaringparticle energies can be thousands of times larger than previously detectedmaximum values (with lorentz factors of 105 and 102 for electrons and protons,respectively). we show that the transitional nature of gamma-ray flares andparticle acceleration above gev energies in cygnus x-3 is clearly linked tospecial radio/x-ray states preceding strong radio flares. thus gamma-raysprovide unique insight into the nature of physical processes in microquasars.

1005.0784	agile detection of gev gamma-ray emission from the snr w28	supernova remnants (snrs) are believed to be the main sources of galacticcosmic rays. molecular clouds associated with snrs can produce gamma-rayemission through the interaction of accelerated particles with the concentratedgas. the middle aged snr w28, for its associated system of dense molecularclouds, provides an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis. we presentthe agile/grid observations of snr w28, and compare them with observations atother wavelengths (tev and 12co j=1--&gt;0 molecular line emission). the gamma-rayflux detected by agile from the dominant source associated with w28 is (14 +-5) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for e &gt; 400 mev. this source is positionally wellcorrelated with the tev emission observed by the hess telescope. the localvariations of the gev to tev flux ratio suggest a difference between the crspectra of the north-west and south molecular cloud complexes. a model based ona hadronic-induced interaction and diffusion with two molecular clouds atdifferent distances from the w28 shell can explain both the morphological andspectral features observed by agile in the mev-gev energy range and by the hesstelescope in the tev energy range. the combined set of agile and h.e.s.s. datastrongly support a hadronic model for the gamma-ray production in w28.

1110.3763	a search for the analogue to cherenkov radiation by high energy  neutrinos at superluminal speeds in icarus	the opera collaboration has claimed evidence of superluminal {\nu}{_\mu}propagation between cern and the lngs. cohen and glashow argued that suchneutrinos should lose energy by producing photons and e+e- pairs, through z0mediated processes analogous to cherenkov radiation. in terms of the parameterdelta=(v^2_nu-v^2_c)/v^2_c, the opera result implies delta = 5 x 10^-5. forthis value of \delta a very significant deformation of the neutrino energyspectrum and an abundant production of photons and e+e- pairs should beobserved at lngs. we present an analysis based on the 2010 and part of the 2011data sets from the icarus experiment, located at gran sasso national laboratoryand using the same neutrino beam from cern. we find that the rates anddeposited energy distributions of neutrino events in icarus agree with theexpectations for an unperturbed spectrum of the cern neutrino beam. our resultstherefore refute a superluminal interpretation of the opera result according tothe cohen and glashow prediction for a weak current analog to cherenkovradiation. in particular no superluminal cherenkov like e+e- pair or gammaemission event has been directly observed inside the fiducial volume of the"bubble chamber like" icarus tpc-lar detector, setting the much stricter limitof delta &lt; 2.5 10^-8 at the 90% confidence level, comparable with the one dueto the observations from the sn1987a.

1111.4868	neutral pion emission from accelerated protons in the supernova remnant  w44	we present the agile gamma-ray observations in the energy range 50 mev - 10gev of the supernova remnant (snr) w44, one of the most interesting systems forstudying cosmic-ray production. w44 is an intermediate-age snr (20, 000 years)and its ejecta expand in a dense medium as shown by a prominent radio shell,nearby molecular clouds, and bright [sii] emitting regions. we extend ourgamma-ray analysis to energies substantially lower than previous measurementswhich could not conclusively establish the nature of the radiation. we findthat gamma-ray emission matches remarkably well both the position and shape ofthe inner snr shocked plasma. furthermore, the gamma-ray spectrum shows aprominent peak near 1 gev with a clear decrement at energies below a fewhundreds of mev as expected from neutral pion decay. here we demonstrate that:(1) hadron-dominated models are consistent with all w44 multiwavelengthconstraints derived from radio, optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray observations; (2)ad hoc lepton-dominated models fail to explain simultaneously thewell-constrained gamma-ray and radio spectra, and require a circumstellardensity much larger than the value derived from observations; (3) the hadronenergy spectrum is well described by a power-law (with index s = 3.0 \pm 0.1)and a low-energy cut-off at ec = 6 \pm 1 gev. direct evidence for pion emissionis then established in an snr for the first time.

1111.4960	agile detection of cygnus x-3 {\gamma}-ray active states during the  period mid-2009/mid-2010	cygnus x-3 (cyg x-3) is a well-known microquasar producing variable emissionat all wavelengths. cyg x-3 is a prominent x-ray binary producing relativisticjets, and studying its high energy emission is crucial for the understanding ofthe fundamental acceleration processes in accreting compact objects. aims. ourgoal is to study extreme particle acceleration and {\gamma}-ray productionabove 100 mev during special spectral states of cyg x- 3 usually characterizedby a low hard x-ray flux and enhanced soft x-ray states. we observed cyg x-3with the agile satellite in extended time intervals from 2009 jun.-jul., and2009 nov.-2010 jul. we report here the results of the agile {\gamma}-raymonitoring of cyg x-3 as well as the results from extensive multiwavelengthcampaigns involving radio (ratan-600, ami-la and mets\"{a}hovi radioobservatories) and x-ray monitoring data (xte and swift). we detect a series ofrepeated {\gamma}-ray flaring activity from cyg x-3 that correlate with thesoft x-ray states and episodes of decreasing or non-detectable hard x-rayemission. furthermore, we detect {\gamma}-ray enhanced emission that tends tobe associated with radio flares greater than 1 jy at 15 ghz, confirming a trendalready detected in previous observations. the source remained active above 100mev for an extended period of time (almost 1.5 months in 2009 jun.-jul. and 1month in 2010 may). we study in detail the short timescale {\gamma}-ray flaresthat occurred before or near the radio peaks. our results confirm the transientnature of the extreme particle acceleration from the microquasar cyg x-3. aseries of repeated {\gamma}-ray flares shows correlations with radio and x-rayemission confirming a well established trend of emission. we compare ourresults with fermi-lat and magic tev observations of cyg x-3.

1203.3432	search for "anomalies" from neutrino and anti-neutrino oscillations at  delta_m^2 ~ 1ev^2 with muon spectrometers and large lar-tpc imaging detectors	this proposal describes an experimental search for sterile neutrinos beyondthe standard model with a new cern-sps neutrino beam. the experiment is basedon two identical lar-tpc's followed by magnetized spectrometers, observing theelectron and muon neutrino events at 1600 and 300 m from the proton target.this project will exploit the icarus t600, moved from lngs to the cern "far"position. an additional 1/4 of the t600 detector will be constructed andlocated in the "near" position. two spectrometers will be placed downstream ofthe two lar-tpc detectors to greatly complement the physics capabilities.spectrometers will exploit a classical dipole magnetic field with iron slabs,and a new concept air-magnet, to perform charge identification and muonmomentum measurements in a wide energy range over a large transverse area. inthe two positions, the radial and energy spectra of the nu_e beam arepractically identical. comparing the two detectors, in absence of oscillations,all cross sections and experimental biases cancel out, and the twoexperimentally observed event distributions must be identical. any differenceof the event distributions at the locations of the two detectors might beattributed to the possible existence of {\nu}-oscillations, presumably due toadditional neutrinos with a mixing angle sin^2(2theta_new) and a larger massdifference delta_m^2_new. the superior quality of the lar imaging tpc, inparticular its unique electron-pi_zero discrimination allows full rejection ofbackgrounds and offers a lossless nu_e detection capability. the determinationof the muon charge with the spectrometers allows the full separation of nu_mufrom anti-nu_mu and therefore controlling systematics from muonmis-identification largely at high momenta.

1206.4454	the characterization of the distant blazar gb6 j1239+0443 from flaring  and low activity periods	in 2008 agile and fermi detected gamma-ray flaring activity from theunidentified egret source 3eg j1236+0457, recently associated with a flatspectrum radio quasar gb6 j1239+0443 at z=1.762. the optical counterpart of thegamma-ray source underwent a flux enhancement of a factor 15-30 in 6 years, andof ~10 in six months. we interpret this flare-up in terms of a transition froman accretion-disk dominated emission to a synchrotron-jet dominated one. weanalysed a sloan digital sky survey (sdss) archival optical spectrum takenduring a period of low radio and optical activity of the source. we estimatedthe mass of the central black hole using the width of the civ emission line. inour work, we have also investigated sdss archival optical photometric data anduv galex observations to estimate the thermal-disk emission contribution of gb6j1239+0443. our analysis of the gamma-ray data taken during the flaringepisodes indicates a flat gamma-ray spectrum, with an extension of up to 15gev, with no statistically-relevant sign of absorption from the broad lineregion, suggesting that the blazar-zone is located beyond the broad lineregion. this result is confirmed by the modeling of the broad-band spectralenergy distribution (well constrained by the available multiwavelength data) ofthe flaring activity periods and by the accretion disk luminosity and blackhole mass estimated by us using archival data.

1207.6288	the agile monitoring of cygnus x-3: transient gamma-ray emission and  spectral constraints	we present the agile-grid monitoring of cygnus x-3, during the period betweennovember 2007 and july 2009. we report here the whole agile-grid monitoring ofcygnus x-3 in the agile "pointing" mode data-taking, to confirm that thegamma-ray activity coincides with the same repetitive pattern ofmultiwavelength emission and to analyze in depth the overall gamma-ray spectrumby assuming both leptonic and hadronic scenarios. seven intense gamma-rayevents were detected in this period, with a typical event lasting one or twodays. these durations are longer than the likely cooling times of the gamma-rayemitting particles, implying we see continuous acceleration rather than theresult of an impulsive event such as the ejection of a single plasmoid whichthen cools as it propagates outwards. cross-correlating the agile-grid lightcurve with x-ray and radio monitoring data, we find that the main events ofgamma-ray activity have been detected while the system was in soft spectralx-ray states (rxte/asm count rate &gt; 3 counts/s), that coincide with local andoften sharp minima of the hard x-ray flux (swift/bat count rate &lt; 0.02counts/cm^2/s), a few days before intense radio outbursts. [...] thesegamma-ray events may thus reflect a sharp transition in the structure of theaccretion disk and its corona, which leads to a rebirth of the microquasar jetand subsequent enhanced radio activity. [...] finally, we examine leptonic andhadronic emission models for the gamma-ray events and find that both scenariosare valid. in the leptonic model - based on inverse compton scatterings ofmildly relativistic electrons on soft photons from the wolf-rayet companionstar and from the accretion disk - the emitting particles may also contributeto the overall hard x-ray spectrum, possibly explaining the hard non-thermalpower-law tail sometimes seen during special soft x-ray states in cygnus x-3.

0808.3464	long-term agile monitoring of the puzzling gamma-ray source 3eg  j1835+5918	we present the agile gamma-ray observations of the field containing thepuzzling gamma-ray source 3eg j1835+5918. this source is one of the mostremarkable unidentified egret sources. an unprecedentedly long agile monitoringof this source yields important information on the positional error box, fluxevolution, and spectrum. 3eg j1835+5918 has been in the agile field of viewseveral times in 2007 and 2008 for a total observing time of 138 days from 2007sept 04 to 2008 june 30 encompassing several weeks of continuous coverage. withan exposure time approximately twice that of egret, agile confirms theexistence of a prominent gamma-ray source (agl j1836+5926) at a positionconsistent with that of egret, although with a remarkably lower average fluxvalue for photon energies greater than 100 mev. a 5-day bin temporal analysisof the whole data set of agl j1836+5926 shows some evidence for variability ofthe gamma-ray flux. the source spectrum between 100 mev and 1 gev can be fittedwith a power law with photon index in the range 1.6-1.7, fully consistent withthe egret value. the faint x-ray source rx j1836.2+5925 that has been proposedas a possible counterpart of 3eg j1835+5918 is well within the agile error box.future continuous monitoring (both by agile and glast) is needed to confirm thegamma-ray flux variability and to unveil the source origin, a subject that iscurrently being pursued through a multiwavelength search for counterparts.

0808.4053	agile detection of variable gamma-ray activity from the blazar s5  0716+714 in september-october 2007	we report the gamma-ray activity from the intermediate bl lac s5 0716+714during observations acquired by the agile satellite in september and october2007. these detections of activity were contemporaneous with a period ofintense optical activity, which was monitored by gasp-webt. this simultaneousoptical and gamma-ray coverage allows us to study in detail the light curves,time lags, gamma-ray photon spectrum, and spectral energy distributions (seds)during different states of activity. agile observed the source with its twoco-aligned imagers, the gamma-ray imaging detector (grid) and the hard x-rayimager (super-agile), which are sensitive to the 30 mev-50 gev and 18-60 kevenergy ranges, respectively. observations were completed in two differentperiods, the first between 2007 september 4-23, and the second between 2007october 24-november 1. over the period 2007 september 7-12, agile detectedgamma-ray emission from the source at a significance level of 9.6-sigma with anaverage flux (e&gt;100 mev) of (97 +/- 15) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}, whichincreased by a factor of at least four within three days. no emission wasdetected by super-agile for the energy range 18-60 kev to a 3-sigma upper limitof 10 mcrab in 335 ksec. in october 2007, agile repointed toward s5 0716+714following an intense optical flare, measuring an average flux of (47 +/- 11) x10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} at a significance level of 6.0-sigma. thegamma-ray flux of s5 0716+714 detected by agile is the highest ever detectedfor this blazar and one of the most intense gamma-ray fluxes detected from a bllac object. the sed of mid-september appears to be consistent with thesynchrotron self-compton (ssc) emission model, but only by including two ssccomponents of different variabilities.

0809.1230	agile detection of delayed gamma-ray emission from grb 080514b	grb 080514b is the first gamma ray burst (grb), since the time of egret, forwhich individual photons of energy above several tens of mev have been detectedwith a pair-conversion tracker telescope. this burst was discovered with theitalian agile gamma-ray satellite. the grb was localized with a cooperation byagile and the interplanetary network (ipn). the gamma-ray imager (grid)estimate of the position, obtained before the superagile-ipn localization, isfound to be consistent with the burst position. the hard x-ray emissionobserved by superagile lasted about 7 s, while there is evidence that theemission above 30 mev extends for a longer duration (at least ~13 s). similarbehavior was seen in the past from a few other grbs observed with egret.however, the latter measurements were affected, during the brightest phases, byinstrumental dead time effects, resulting in only lower limits to the burstintensity. thanks to the small dead time of the agile/grid we could assess thatin the case of grb 080514b the gamma-ray to x-ray flux ratio changessignificantly between the prompt and extended emission phase.

0809.1737	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3. i. the agile 2007 november  campaign on the "crazy diamond"	[abridged] we report on a multiwavelength observation of the blazar 3c 454.3(which we dubbed "crazy diamond") carried out on november 2007 by means of theastrophysical satellites agile, integral, swift, the webt consortium, and theoptical-nir telescope rem. 3c 454.3 is detected at a $\sim 19-\sigma$ levelduring the 3-week observing period, with an average flux above 100 mev of$f_{\rm e&gt;100mev} = (170 \pm 13) \times 10^{-8}$ \phcmsec. the gamma-rayspectrum can be fit with a single power-law with photon index $\gamma_{\rmgrid} = 1.73 \pm 0.16$ between 100 mev and 1 gev. we detect significantday-by-day variability of the gamma-ray emission during our observations, andwe can exclude that the fluxes are constant at the 99.6% ($\sim 2.9 \sigma$)level. the source was detected typically around 40 degrees off-axis, and it wassubstantially off--axis in the field of view of the agile hard x-ray imager.however, a 5-day long too observation by integral detected 3c 454.3 at anaverage flux of about $f_{\rm 20-200 kev} = 1.49 \times 10^{-3}$ \phcmsec withan average photon index of $\gamma_{\rm ibis} = 1.75 \pm 0.24$ between 20--200kev. swift also detected 3c 454.3 with a flux in the 0.3--10 kev energy band inthe range $(1.23-1.40) \times 10^{-2}$ \phcmsec{} and a photon index in therange $\gamma_{\rm xrt} = 1.56-1.73$. in the optical band, both webt and remshow an extremely variable behavior in the $r$ band. a correlation analysisbased on the entire data set is consistent with no time-lags between thegamma-ray and the optical flux variations. our simultaneous multifrequencyobservations strongly indicate that the dominant emission mechanism between 30mev and 30 gev is dominated by inverse compton scattering of relativisticelectrons in the jet on the external photons from the broad line region.

0809.3917	gamma-ray burst detection with the agile mini-calorimeter	the mini-calorimeter (mcal) instrument on-board the agile satellite is anon-imaging gamma-ray scintillation detector sensitive in the 300kev-100mevenergy range with a total on-axis geometrical area of 1400cm^2. gamma-raybursts (grbs) are one of the main scientific targets of the agile mission andthe mcal design as an independent self-triggering detector makes it a valuableall-sky monitor for grbs. furthermore mcal is one of the very few operativeinstruments with microsecond timing capabilities in the mev range. in thispaper the results of grb detections with mcal after one year of operation inspace are presented and discussed. a flexible trigger logic implemented in theagile payload data-handling unit allows the on-board detection of grbs. fortriggered events, energy and timing information are sent to telemetry on aphoton-by-photon basis, so that energy and time binning are limited by countingstatistics only. when the trigger logic is not active, grbs can be detectedoffline in ratemeter data, although with worse energy and time resolution.between the end of june 2007 and june 2008 mcal detected 51 grbs, with adetection rate of about 1 grb/week, plus several other events at a fewmilliseconds timescales. since february 2008 the on-board trigger logic hasbeen fully active. comparison of mcal detected events and data provided byother space instruments confirms the sensitivity and effective areaestimations. mcal also joined the 3rd inter-planetary network, to contribute togrb localization by means of triangulation.
