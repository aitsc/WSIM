0902.0338	long-wavelength observations of debris discs around sun-like stars	[abridged] we present two deep surveys of circumstellar discs aroundsolar-type stars at different ages carried out at 350 micron with the cso andat 1.2 mm with the iram 30-m telescope. the aim of this study is to understandthe evolution timescale of circumstellar debris discs, and the physicalmechanisms responsible for such evolution around solar-type stars. in addition,we perform a detailed characterisation of the detected debris discs.theoretically, the mass of the disc is expected to decrease with time. in orderto test this hypothesis, we performed the generalised kendall's tau correlationand three different two-sample tests. a characterisation of the detected debrisdiscs has been obtained by computing the collision and poynting-robertsontimescales and by modelling the spectral energy distribution. the kendall's taucorrelation yields a probability of 76% that the mass of debris discs and theirage are correlated. similarly, the three two-sample tests give a probabilitybetween 70 and 83% that younger and older debris systems belong to differentparent populations in terms of dust mass. we detected submillimetre/millimetreemission from six debris discs, enabling a detailed sed modelling. our resultson the correlation and evolution of dust mass as a function of age areconditioned by the sensitivity limit of our survey. deeper millimetreobservations are needed to confirm the evolution of debris material aroundsolar-like stars. in the case of the detected discs, the comparison betweencollision and poynting-robertson timescales supports the hypothesis that thesediscs are collision dominated. all detected debris disc systems show the innerpart evacuated from small micron-sized grains.

nucl-ex;0109013	compton scattering by the proton using a large-acceptance arrangement	compton scattering by the proton has been measured using the tagged-photonfacility at mami (mainz) and the large-acceptance arrangement lara. the newdata are interpreted in terms of dispersion theory based on the said-sm99kparameterization of photo-meson amplitudes. it is found that two-pion exchangein the t-channel is needed for a description of the data in the secondresonance region. the data are well represented if this channel is modeled by asingle pole with mass parameter m(sigma)=600 mev. the asymptotic part of thespin dependent amplitude is found to be well represented by pi-0-exchange inthe t-channel. a backward spin-polarizability ofgamma(pi)=(-37.1+-0.6(stat+syst)+-3.0(model))x10^{-4}fm^4 has been determinedfrom data of the first resonance region below 455 mev. this value is in a goodagreement with predictions of dispersion relations and chiral pertubationtheory. from a subset of data between 280 and 360 mev the resonancepion-photoproduction amplitudes were evaluated leading to a e2/m1 multipoleratio of the p-to-delta radiative transition of emr(340mev)=(-1.7+-0.4(stat+syst)+-0.2(model))%. it was found that this number isdependent on the parameterization of photo-meson amplitudes. with the maid2kparameterization an e2/m1 multipole ratio of emr(340mev)=(-2.0+-0.4(stat+syst)+-0.2(model))% is obtained.

quant-ph;0005042	linking classical and quantum key agreement: is there "bound  information"?	after carrying out a protocol for quantum key agreement over a noisy quantumchannel, the parties alice and bob must process the raw key in order to end upwith identical keys about which the adversary has virtually no information. inprinciple, both classical and quantum protocols can be used for thisprocessing. it is a natural question which type of protocols is more powerful.we prove for general states but under the assumption of incoherenteavesdropping that alice and bob share some so-called intrinsic information intheir classical random variables, resulting from optimal measurements, if andonly if the parties' quantum systems are entangled. in addition, we provideevidence that the potentials of classical and of quantum protocols are equal inevery situation. consequently, many techniques and results from quantuminformation theory directly apply to problems in classical information theory,and vice versa. for instance, it was previously believed that two parties cancarry out unconditionally secure key agreement as long as they share someintrinsic information in the adversary's view. the analysis of this purelyclassical problem from the quantum information-theoretic viewpoint shows thatthis is true in the binary case, but false in general. more explicitly, boundentanglement, i.e., entanglement that cannot be purified by any quantumprotocol, has a classical counterpart. this "bound intrinsic information"cannot be distilled to a secret key by any classical protocol. as anotherapplication we propose a measure for entanglement based on classicalinformation-theoretic quantities.

0905.0565	tracing the potential planet-forming regions around seven  pre-main-sequence stars	we investigate the nature of the innermost regions of seven circumstellardisks around pre-main-sequence stars. our object sample contains disksapparently at various stages of their evolution. both single stars andspatially resolved binaries are considered. in particular, we search for innerdisk gaps as proposed for several young stellar objects. when analyzing theunderlying dust population in the atmosphere of circumstellar disks, the shapeof the 10um feature is investigated. we performed interferometric observationsin n band 8-13um with midi using baseline lengths of between 54m and 127m. thedata analysis is based on radiative-transfer simulations using the monte carlocode mc3d by modeling simultaneously the sed, n band spectra, andinterferometric visibilities. correlated and uncorrelated n band spectra arecompared to investigate the radial distribution of the dust composition of thedisk atmosphere. spatially resolved mid-infrared emission was detected in allobjects. for four objects, the observed n band visibilities and correspondingseds could be simultaneously simulated using a parameterized active disk-model.for the more evolved objects of our sample, a purely passive disk-modelprovides the closest fit. the visibilities inferred for one source allow thepresence of an inner disk gap. for another object, one of two visibilitymeasurements could not be simulated by our modeling approach. all uncorrelatedspectra reveal the 10um silicate emission feature. in contrast to this, somecorrelated spectra of the observations of the more evolved objects do not showthis feature, indicating a lack of small silicates in the inner versus theouter regions of these disks. we conclude from this observational result thatmore evolved dust grains can be found in the more central disk regions.

0907.1074	the circumstellar disc in the bok globule cb 26: multi-wavelength  observations and modelling of the dust disc and envelope	circumstellar discs are expected to be the nursery of planets. grain growthwithin such discs is the first step in the planet formation process. the bokglobule cb 26 harbours such a young disc. we present a detailed model of theedge-on circumstellar disc and its envelope in the bok globule cb 26. the modelis based on hst near-infrared maps in the i, j, h, and k bands, ovro and smaradio maps at 1.1mm, 1.3mm and 2.7mm, and the spectral energy distribution(sed) from 0.9 microns to 3mm. new photometric and spectroscopic data from thespitzer space telescope and the caltech submilimeter observatory have beenobtained and are part of our analysis. using the self-consistent radiativetransfer code mc3d, the model we construct is able to discriminate parametersets and dust properties of both its parts, namely envelope and disc. we findthat the disc has an inner hole with a radius of 45 +/- 5 au. based on a dustmodel including silicate and graphite the maximum grain size needed toreproduce the spectral millimetre index is 2.5 microns. features seen in thenear-infrared images, dominated by scattered light, can be described as aresult of a rotating envelope. successful employment of ism dust in both thedisc and envelope hint that grain growth may not yet play a significant rolefor the appearance of this system. a larger inner hole gives rise to theassumption that cb 26 is a circumbinary disc.

1204.4363	imaging the heart of astrophysical objects with optical long-baseline  interferometry	the number of publications of aperture-synthesis images based on opticallong-baseline interferometry measurements has recently increased due to easieraccess to visible and infrared interferometers. the interferometry techniquehas now reached a technical maturity level that opens new avenues for numerousastrophysical topics requiring milli-arcsecond model-independent imaging. inwriting this paper our motivation was twofold: 1) review and publicizeemblematic excerpts of the impressive corpus accumulated in the field ofoptical interferometry image reconstruction; 2) discuss future prospects forthis technique by selecting four representative astrophysical science cases inorder to review the potential benefits of using optical long baselineinterferometers. for this second goal we have simulated interferometric datafrom those selected astrophysical environments and used state-of-the-art codesto provide the reconstructed images that are reachable with current orsoon-to-be facilities. the image reconstruction process was "blind" in thesense that reconstructors had no knowledge of the input brightnessdistributions. we discuss the impact of optical interferometry in those fourastrophysical fields. we show that image reconstruction software successfullyprovides accurate morphological information on a variety of astrophysicaltopics and review the current strengths and weaknesses of such reconstructions.we investigate how to improve image reconstruction and the quality of the imagepossibly by upgrading the current facilities. we finally argue that opticalinterferometers and their corresponding instrumentation, existing or to come,with 6 to 10 telescopes, should be well suited to provide images of complexsceneries.

1205.4901	the circumstellar disk of hh 30. searching for signs of disk evolution  with multi-wavelength modeling	circumstellar disks are characteristic for star formation and vanish duringthe first few myr of stellar evolution. during this time planets are believedto form in the dense midplane by growth, sedimentation and aggregation of dust.indicators of disk evolution, such as holes and gaps, can be traced in thespectral energy distribution (sed) and spatially resolved images.  we aim to construct a self-consistent model of hh 30 by fitting all availablecontinuum observations simultaneously. new data sets not available in previousstudies, such as high-resolution interferometric imaging with the plateau debure interferometer (pdbi) at lambda = 1.3 mm and sed measured with irs on thespitzer space telescope in the mid-infrared, put strong constraints onpredictions and are likely to provide new insights into the evolutionary stateof this object.  a parameter study based on simulated annealing was performed to find unbiasedbest-fit models for independent observations made in the wavelength domainlambda ~ 1 micron ... 4 mm. the method essentially creates a markov chainthrough parameter space by comparing predictions generated by ourself-consistent continuum radiation transfer code mc3d with observations.  we present models of the edge-on circumstellar disk of hh 30 based onobservations from the near-infrared to mm-wavelengths that suggest the presenceof an inner depletion zone with about 45 au radius and a steep decline of mmopacity beyond 140 au. our modeling indicates that several modes of dustevolution such as growth, settling, and radial migration are taking place inthis object.  high-resolution observations of hh 30 at different wavelengths withnext-generation observatories such as alma and jwst will enable the modeling ofinhomogeneous dust properties and significantly expand our understanding ofcircumstellar disk evolution.

(abridged) infrared excesses associated with debris disk host stars detectedso far peak at wavelengths around ~100{\mu}m or shorter. however, six out of 31excess sources in the herschel otkp dunes have been seen to show significant -and in some cases extended - excess emission at 160{\mu}m, which is larger thanthe 100{\mu}m excess. this excess emission has been suggested to stem fromdebris disks colder than those known previously. using several methods, were-consider whether some or even all of the candidates may be associated withunrelated galactic or extragalactic emission and conclude that it is highlyunlikely that none of the candidates represents a true circumstellar disk. fortrue disks, both the dust temperatures inferred from the seds and the diskradii estimated from the images suggest that the dust is nearly as cold as ablackbody. this requires the grains to be larger than ~100{\mu}m, regardless oftheir material composition. to explain the dearth of small grains, we exploreseveral conceivable scenarios: transport-dominated disks, disks of lowdynamical excitation, and disks of unstirred primordial macroscopic grains. ourqualitative analysis and collisional simulations rule out the first two ofthese scenarios, but show the feasibility of the third one. we show that suchdisks can survive for gigayears, largely preserving the primordial sizedistribution. they should be composed of macroscopic solids larger thanmillimeters, but smaller than kilometers in size. thus planetesimal formation,at least in the outer regions of the systems, has stopped before "cometary" or"asteroidal" sizes were reached.

1310.1936	ots44: disk and accretion at the planetary border	we discover that the very low-mass brown dwarf ots44 (m9.5, ~12 m_jup) hassignificant accretion and a substantial disk, which demonstrates that theprocesses that accompany canonical star formation occur down to a central massof a few jupiter masses. we discover in vlt/sinfoni spectra that ots44 hasstrong, broad, and variable paschen beta emission that is evidence for activeaccretion at the planetary border. we also detect strong halpha emission ofots44 in a literature spectrum and determine an halpha ew (-141 a) that isindicative of active accretion. both the pa beta and halpha emission lines havebroad profiles with wings extending to velocities of about +/-200 km/s. wedetermine the mass accretion rate of ots44 based on halpha to 7.6x10^{-12}msun/yr, which shows that ots44 has a relatively high mass-accretion rateconsidering its small central mass. this mass rate is nevertheless consistentwith the general decreasing trend found for stars of several solar masses downto brown dwarfs. furthermore, we determine the properties of the disksurrounding ots44 through radiative transfer modeling of flux measurement fromthe optical to the far-ir (herschel) by applying a bayesian analysis. we findthat ots44 has a highly flared disk (beta &gt;1.2) with a mass of 9.1x10^{-5}m_sun, i.e. about 0.1 m_jup or 30 m_earth. we show that the ratio ofdisk-to-central-mass of about 10^{-2} found for objects between 0.03 msun and14 msun is also valid for ots44 at a mass of ~0.01 m_sun. our observations arein line with an isolated star-like mode of the formation of brown dwarfs downto 0.01 m_sun.

1312.5146	can eccentric debris disks be long-lived? a first numerical  investigation and application to $\zeta^2$ reticuli	imaging of debris disks has found evidence for both eccentric and offsetdisks. one hypothesis is that these provide evidence for massive perturbersthat sculpt the observed structures. one such disk was recently observed in thefar-ir by the herschel space observatory around $\zeta^2$ ret. in contrast withpreviously reported systems, the disk is significantly eccentric, and thesystem is gyr-old. we aim to investigate the long-term evolution of eccentricstructures in debris disks caused by a perturber on an eccentric orbit. bothanalytical predictions and numerical n-body simulations are used to investigatethe observable structures that could be produced by eccentric perturbers. thelong-term evolution of the disk geometry is examined, with particularapplication to the $\zeta^2$ ret system. in addition, synthetic images of thedisk are produced for comparison with herschel observations. we show that aneccentric companion can produce both the observed offsets and eccentric disks.such effects are not immediate and we characterise the timescale required forthe disk to develop to an eccentric state. for the case of $\zeta^2$ ret, weplace limits on the mass and orbit of the companion required to produce theobservations. synthetic images show that the pattern observed around $\zeta^2$ret can be produced by an eccentric disk seen close to edge-on, and allow us tobring additional constraints on the disk parameters of our model (disk flux,extent). we determine that eccentric planets or stellar companions can inducelong-lived eccentric structures in debris disks. observations of such eccentricstructures provide potential evidence of the presence of such a companion in aplanetary system. we consider the example of $\zeta^2$ ret, whose observedeccentric disk can be explained by a distant companion at tens of au, on aneccentric orbit ($e_p\gtrsim 0.3$).

1401.6896	how dusty is alpha centauri? excess or non-excess over the infrared  photospheres of main-sequence stars	[abridged] debris discs around main-sequence stars indicate the presence oflarger rocky bodies. the components of the nearby binary acentauri have higherthan solar metallicities, which is thought to promote giant planet formation.we aim to determine the level of emission from debris in the acen system.having already detected the temperature minimum, tmin, of acena, we hereattempt to do so also for the companion acenb. using the acen stars astemplates, we study possible effects tmin may have on the detectability ofunresolved dust discs around other stars. we use herschel and apex photometryto determine the stellar spectral energy distributions. in addition, we useapex for spectral line mapping to study the complex background around acen seenin the photometric images. models of stellar atmospheres and discs are used toestimate the amount of debris around these stars. for solar-type stars, afractional dust luminosity fd 2e-7 could account for seds that do not exhibitthe tmin-effect. slight excesses at the 2.5 sigma level are observed at 24 mufor both stars, which, if interpreted to be due to dust, would correspond to fd(1-3)e-5. dynamical disc modelling leads to rough mass estimates of theputative zodi belts around the acen stars, viz. &lt;~4e-6 mmoon of 4 to 1000 musize grains, distributed according to n a^-3.5. similarly, for filled-in tminemission, corresponding ekbs could account for ~1e-3 mmoon of dust. lightscattered and/or thermally emitted by exo-zodi discs will have profoundimplications for future spectroscopic missions designed to search forbiomarkers in the atmospheres of earth-like planets. the f-ir sed of acenb ismarginally consistent with the presence of a minimum temperature region in theupper atmosphere. we also show that an acena-like temperature minimum mayresult in an erroneous apprehension about the presence of dust around otherstars.

0802.2604	three-dimensional radiative transfer models of clumpy tori in seyfert  galaxies	tori of active galactic nuclei are made up of a mixture of hot and cold gas,as well as dust. in order to protect the dust grains from destruction by thehot gas as well as by the energetic radiation of the accretion disk, the dustis often assumed to be distributed in clouds. in our new 3d model of agn dusttori, the torus is modelled as a wedge-shaped disk in which dusty clouds arerandomly distributed, by taking the dust density distribution of thecorresponding continuous model into account. we especially concentrate on thedifferences between clumpy and continuous models in terms of the temperaturedistributions, the surface brightness distributions and interferometricvisibilities, as well as spectral energy distributions. to this end, we employradiative transfer calculations with the help of the 3d monte carlo code mc3d.in a second step, interferometric visibilities are calculated from thesimulated surface brightness distributions, which can be directly compared toobservations with the midi instrument. the radial temperature distributions ofclumpy models possess significantly enhanced scatter compared to the continuouscases. even at large distances, clouds can be heated directly by the centralaccretion disk. the existence of the silicate 10 micron-feature in absorptionor in emission depends sensitively on the distribution, the size and opticaldepth of clouds in the innermost part of the torus, due to shadowing effects ofclouds there. this explains failure and success of previous modelling effortsof clumpy tori. after adapting the parameters of our clumpy standard model tothe circumstances of the seyfert 2 circinus galaxy, it can qualitativelyexplain recent mid-infrared interferometric observations performed with midi,as well as high resolution spectral data.

0802.3033	the formation and evolution of planetary systems: grain growth and  chemical processing of dust in t tauri systems	this paper is one in a series presenting results obtained within theformation and evolution of planetary systems (feps) legacy science program onthe spitzer space telescope. here we present a study of dust processing andgrowth in seven protoplanetary disks. our spectra indicate that thecircumstellar silicate dust grains have grown to sizes at least 10 times largerthan observed in the interstellar medium, and show evidence for anon-negligible (~5 % in mass fractions) contribution from crystalline species.these results are similar to those of other studies of protoplanetary disks. inaddition, we find a correlation between the strength of the amorphous silicatefeature and the shape of the spectral energy distribution. this latter resultis consistent with the growth and subsequent gravitational settling of dustgrains towards the disk mid-plane. further, we find a change in the relativeabundance of the different crystalline species: more enstatite relative toforsterite is observed in the inner warm dust population at ~1 au, whileforsterite dominates in the colder outer regions at ~5 to 15 au. this change inthe relative abundances argues for a localized crystallization process ratherthan a radial mixing scenario where crystalline silicates are being transportedoutwards from a single formation region in the hot inner parts of the disk.last, we report the detection of emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonmolecules in five out of seven sources. we find a tentative pah band at 8.2micron, previously undetected in the spectra of disks around low-masspre-main-sequence stars.

1407.6575	effect of dust grain porosity on the appearance of protoplanetary disks	we theoretically analyze protoplanetary disks consisting of porous dustgrains. in the analysis of observations of protoplanetary disks the dust phaseis often assumed to consist of spherical grains, allowing one to apply the miescattering formalism. however, in reality, the shape of dust grains is expectedto deviate strongly from that of a sphere. we investigate the influence ofporous dust grains on the temperature distribution and observable appearance ofprotoplanetary disks for dust grain porosities of up to 60 %. we performedradiative transfer modeling to simulate the temperature distribution, spectralenergy distribution, and spatially resolved intensity and polarization maps.the optical properties of porous grains were calculated using the method ofdiscrete dipole approximation. we find that the flux in the optical wavelengthrange is for porous grains higher than for compact, spherical grains. theprofile of the silicate peak at 9.7 um strongly depends on the degree of grainporosity. the temperature distribution shows significant changes in thedirection perpendicular to the midplane. moreover, simulated polarization mapsreveal an increase of the polarization degree by a factor of about four whenporous grains are considered, regardless of the disk inclination. thepolarization direction is reversed in selected disk regions, depending on thewavelength, grain porosity, and disk inclination. we discuss several possibleexplanations of this effect and find that multiple scattering explains theeffect best. porosity influences the observable appearance of protoplanetarydisks. in particular, the polarization reversal shows a dependence on grainporosity. the physical conditions within the disk are altered by porosity,which might have an effect on the processes of grain growth and disk evolution.

astro-ph;0506252	formation and evolution of planetary systems: upper limits the gas mass  in hd105	we report infrared spectroscopic observations of hd 105, a nearby ($\sim 40$pc) and relatively young ($\sim 30$ myr) g0 star with excess infrared continuumemission, which has been modeled as arising from an optically thincircumstellar dust disk with an inner hole of size $\gtrsim 13$ au. we haveused the high spectral resolution mode of the infrared spectrometer (irs) onthe spitzer space telescope to search for gas emission lines from the disk. theobservations reported here provide upper limits to the fluxes of h$_2$ s(0)28$\mu$m, h$_2$ s(1) 17$\mu$m, h$_2$ s(2) 12 $\mu$m, [feii] 26$\mu$m, [siii]35$\mu$m, and [si] 25$\mu$m infrared emission lines. the h$_2$ line upperlimits directly place constraints on the mass of warm molecular gas in thedisk: $m({\rm h_2})&lt; 4.6$, 3.8$\times 10^{-2}$, and $3.0\times 10^{-3}$ m$_j$at $t= 50$, 100, and 200 k, respectively. we also compare the line flux upperlimits to predictions from detailed thermal/chemical models of various gasdistributions in the disk. these comparisons indicate that if the gasdistribution has an inner hole with radius $r_{i,gas}$, the surface density atthat inner radius is limited to values ranging from $\lesssim 3$ gm cm$^{-2}$at $r_{i,gas}=0.5$ au to 0.1 gm cm$^{-2}$ at $r_{i,gas}= 5-20$ au. these valuesare considerably below the value for a minimum mass solar nebula, and suggestthat less than 1 m$_j$ of gas (at any temperature) exists in the 1-40 auplanet-forming region. therefore, it is unlikely that there is sufficient gasfor gas giant planet formation to occur in hd 105 at this time.

astro-ph;0506669	signatures of planets in spatially unresolved disks	main sequence stars are commonly surrounded by debris disks, composed of colddust continuously replenished by a reservoir of undetected dust-producingplanetesimals. in a planetary system with a belt of planetesimals (like thesolar system's kuiper belt) and one or more interior giant planets, thetrapping of dust particles in the mean motion resonances with the planets cancreate structure in the dust disk, as the particles accumulate at certainsemimajor axes. sufficiently massive planets may also scatter and eject dustparticles out of a planetary system, creating a dust depleted region inside theorbit of the planet. in anticipation of future observations of spatiallyunresolved debris disks with the spitzer space telescope, we are interested instudying how the structure carved by planets affects the shape of the disk'sspectral energy distribution (sed), and consequently if the sed can be used toinfer the presence of planets. we numerically calculate the equilibrium spatialdensity distributions and seds of dust disks originated by a belt ofplanetesimals in the presence of interior giant planets in different planetaryconfigurations, and for a representative sample of chemical compositions. thedynamical models are necessary to estimate the enhancement of particles nearthe mean motion resonances with the planets, and to determine how manyparticles drift inside the planet's orbit. based on the seds and predicted$\it{spitzer}$ colors we discuss what types of planetary systems can bedistinguishable from one another and the main parameter degeneracies in themodel seds.

astro-ph;0508380	constraining the evolutionary stage of class i protostars:  multi-wavelength observations and modeling	(abridged) we present new keck images at 0.9 micron and ovro 1.3 mm continuumimages of five class i protostars in the taurus star forming region. we analyzethese data in conjunction with broadband spectral energy distributions and 8-13micron spectra from the literature using a monte carlo radiative transfer code.by fitting models for the circumstellar dust distributions simultaneously tothe scattered light images, millimeter continuum data, and the seds, we attemptto distinguish between flared disks, infalling envelopes with outflow cavities,and combinations of disks and envelopes. for each of these circumstellardensity distributions, we generate grids of models for varying geometries, dustmasses, and accretion rates, and determine the best fits by minimizing theresiduals between model and data. models incorporating both massive envelopesand massive embedded disks generally fit the imaging+sed data best. impliedenvelope infall rates for these models are consistent with infall rates derivedby previous investigators, although they are approximately an order ofmagnitude larger than inner disk accretion rates inferred from recentspectroscopic measurements. in addition, the disk masses inferred from ourmodels are close to or larger than the limit for gravitationally stable disks,indicating that class i disks may undergo periodic episodes of enhancedaccretion, perhaps as a result of gravitational instabilities. an importantcaveat to these results is that in some cases, no single model can fit all ofthe imaging and sed data well, suggesting that further refinements to models ofthe circumstellar dust distributions around class i sources are necessary.

astro-ph;0510294	the formation and evolution of planetary systems (feps): discovery of an  unusual debris system associated with hd 12039	we report the discovery of a debris system associated with the $\sim 30$ myrold g3/5v star hd 12039 using {\it spitzer space telescope} observations from3.6 -- 160$\mu$m. an observed infrared excess (l$_{\rm ir}$/l$_{\ast} =1\times10^{-4}$) above the expected photosphere for $\lambda \gtrsim 14\mu$m isfit by thermally emitting material with a color temperature of t$\sim 110$ k,warmer than the majority of debris disks identified to date around sun-likestars. the object is not detected at 70$\mu$m with a 3$\sigma$ upper limit 6times the expected photospheric flux. the spectrum of the infrared excess canbe explained by warm, optically thin material comprised of blackbody-likegrains of size $\gtrsim 7 \mu$m that reside in a belt orbiting the star at 4--6au. an alternate model dominated by smaller grains, near the blow-out size$a\sim 0.5\mu$m, located at 30-40au is also possible, but requires the dust tohave been produced recently since such small grains will be expelled from thesystem by radiation pressure in $\sim$ few $\times 10^{2}$yrs.

astro-ph;0511250	formation and evolution of planetary systems (feps): primordial warm  dust evolution from 3-30 myr around sun-like stars	we present data obtained with the infrared array camera (irac) aboard thespitzer space telescope (spitzer) for a sample of 74 young (t &lt; 30 myr old)sun-like (0.7 &lt; m(star)/m(sun) &lt; 1.5) stars. these are a sub-set of theobservations that comprise the spitzer legacy science program entitled theformation and evolution of planetary systems (feps). using irac we study thefraction of young stars that exhibit 3.6-8.0 micron infrared emission in excessof that expected from the stellar photosphere, as a function of age from 3-30myr. the most straightforward interpretation of such excess emission is thepresence of hot (300-1000k) dust in the inner regions (&lt; 3 au) of acircumstellar disk. five out of the 74 young stars show a strong infraredexcess, four of which have estimated ages of 3-10 myr. while we detect excessesfrom 5 optically thick disks, and photospheric emission from the remainder ofour sample, we do not detect any excess emission from optically thin disks atthese wavelengths. we compare our results with accretion disk fractionsdetected in previous studies, and use the ensemble results to place additionalconstraints on the dissipation timescales for optically-thick, primordialdisks.

astro-ph;0604059	analysis of the dust evolution in the circumstellar disks of ttauri  stars	we present a compositional analysis of 8-13um spectra of 32 young stellarobjects (ysos). our sample consists of 5 intermediate-mass stars and 27low-mass stars. while the spectra and first scientific results have alreadybeen published by przygodda et al. (2003) and kessler-silacci et al. (2004) weperform a more detailed analysis of the 10um silicate feature. in our analysiswe assume that this emission feature can be represented by a linearsuperposition of the wavelength-dependent opacity $\kappa_{\rm abs}(\lambda)$describing the optical properties of silicate grains with different chemicalcomposition, structure, and grain size. the determination of an adequatefitting equation is another goal of this study. using a restricted number offitting parameters we investigate which silicate species are necessary for thecompositional fitting. particles with radii of 0.1um- and 1.5um consisting ofamorphous olivine and pyroxene, forsterite, enstatite, and quartz have beenconsidered. only compact, homogeneous dust grains have been used in thepresented fitting procedures. in this context we show that acceptable fittingresults can also be achieved if emission properties of porous silicate grainsare considered instead. although some previous studies give reasons for thesimilarity between the dust in circumstellar disks of ttauri stars and herbigae/be stars, a quantitative comparison has been missing, so far. therefore, weconclude with a discussion of the results of a 10um spectroscopic survey of vanboekel et al. (2005) who focus on herbig ae/be stars, the higher masscounterparts of t tauri stars and draw comparisons to this and other studies.we find that the results of our study of t tauri systems partly agree withprevious studies of herbig ae/be stars.

astro-ph;0606669	formation and evolution of planetary systems: upper limits to the gas  mass in disks around sun-like stars	we have carried out a sensitive search for gas emission lines at infrared andmillimeter wavelengths for a sample of 15 young sun-like stars selected fromour dust disk survey with the spitzer space telescope. we have usedmid-infrared lines to trace the warm (300-100 k) gas in the inner disk andmillimeter transitions of 12co to probe the cold (~20 k) outer disk. we reportno gas line detections from our sample. line flux upper limits are firstconverted to warm and cold gas mass limits using simple approximations allowinga direct comparison with values from the literature. we also present resultsfrom more sophisticated models following gorti and hollenbach (2004) whichconfirm and extend our simple analysis. these models show that the si line at25.23 micron can set constraining limits on the gas surface density at the diskinner radius and traces disk regions up to a few au. we find that none of the15 systems have more than 0.04 mj of gas within a few au from the disk innerradius for disk radii from 1 au up to ~40 au. these gas mass upper limits evenin the 8 systems younger than ~30 myr suggest that most of the gas is dispersedearly. the gas mass upper limits in the 10-40 au region, that is mainly tracedby our co data, are &lt;2 mearth. if these systems are analogs of the solarsystem, either they have already formed uranus- and neptune-like planets orthey will not form them beyond 100 myr. finally, the gas surface density upperlimits at 1 au are smaller than 0.01% of the minimum mass solar nebula for mostof the sources. if terrestrial planets form frequently and their orbits arecircularized by gas, then circularization occurs early.

0811.1425	the effect of stellar feedback on the formation and evolution of gas and  dust tori in agn	recently, the existence of geometrically thick dust structures in activegalactic nuclei (agn) has been directly proven with the help of mid-infraredinterferometry. the observations are consistent with a two-component model madeup of a geometrically thin and warm central disk, surrounded by a colder,fluffy torus component. in an exploratory study, we investigate one possiblephysical mechanism, which could produce such a structure, namely the effect ofstellar feedback from a young nuclear star cluster on the interstellar mediumin centres of agn. the model is realised with the help of the hydrodynamicscode tramp. we follow the evolution of the interstellar medium by takingdiscrete mass loss and energy ejection due to stellar processes, as well asoptically thin radiative cooling into account. in a post-processing step, wecalculate observable quantities (spectral energy distributions and images) withthe help of the radiative transfer code mc3d. the interplay between injectionof mass, supernova explosions and radiative cooling leads to a two-componentstructure made up of a cold geometrically thin, but optically thick and veryturbulent disk residing in the vicinity of the angular momentum barrier,surrounded by a filamentary structure. the latter consists of cold long radialfilaments flowing towards the disk and a hot tenuous medium in between, whichshows both inwards and outwards directed motions. this modelling is able toreproduce the range of observed neutral hydrogen column densities of a sampleof seyfert galaxies as well as the relation between them and the strength ofthe silicate 10 micron spectral feature. despite being quite crude, our meanseyfert galaxy model is even able to describe the seds of two intermediate typeseyfert galaxies observed with the spitzer space telescope.
