0903.4559	effects of dark matter substructures on gravitational lensing: results  from the aquarius simulations	we use high-resolution aquarius simulations of milky way-sized haloes in thelcdm cosmology to study the effects of dark matter substructures ongravitational lensing. each halo is resolved with ~ 10^8 particles (at a massresolution ~ 10^3-4 m_sun/h) within its virial radius. subhaloes with masseslarger than 10^5 m_sun/h are well resolved, an improvement of at least twoorders of magnitude over previous lensing studies. we incorporate a baryoniccomponent modelled as a hernquist profile and account for the response of thedark matter via adiabatic contraction. we focus on the "anomalous" flux ratioproblem, in particular on the violation of the cusp-caustic relation due tosubstructures. we find that subhaloes with masses less than ~ 10^8 m_sun/h playan important role in causing flux anomalies; such low mass subhaloes have beenunresolved in previous studies. there is large scatter in the predicted fluxratios between different haloes and between different projections of the samehalo. in some cases, the frequency of predicted anomalous flux ratios iscomparable to that observed for the radio lenses, although in most cases it isnot. the probability for the simulations to reproduce the observed violationsof the cusp lenses is about 0.001. we therefore conclude that the amount ofsubstructure in the central regions of the aquarius haloes is insufficient toexplain the observed frequency of violations of the cusp-caustic relation.these conclusions are based purely on our dark matter simulations which ignorethe effect of baryons on subhalo survivability.

0909.1593	the earliest stars and their relics in the milky way	we have implemented a simple model to identify the likely sites of the firststars and galaxies in the high-resolution simulations of the formation ofgalactic dark matter halos of the aquarius project. the first star in a galaxylike the milky way formed around redshift z=35; by z=10, the young galaxycontained up to 30000 dark matter haloes capable of forming stars by molecularhydrogen cooling. these minihaloes were strongly clustered and feedback mayhave severely limited the actual number of population iii stars that formed. bythe present day, the remnants of the first stars would be strongly concentratedto the centre of the main halo. if a second generation of long-lived starsformed near the first (the first star relics), we would expect to find half ofthem within 30kpc/h of the galactic centre and a significant fraction insatellites where they may be singled out by their anomalous metallicitypatterns. the first halo in which gas could cool by atomic hydrogen lineradiation formed at z=25; by z=10, the number of such first galaxies hadincreased to ~300. feedback might have decreased the number of first galaxiesat the time they undergo significant star formation, but not the number thatsurvive to the present because near neighbours merge. half of all the "firstgalaxies" that form before z=10 merge with the main halo before z~3 and mostlose a significant fraction of their mass. however, today there should still bemore than 20 remnants orbiting within the central ~30kpc/h of the milky way.these satellites have circular velocities of a few kilometers per second ormore, comparable to those of known milky way dwarfs. they are a promisinghunting ground for the remnants of the earliest epoch of star formation.

0910.3211	galactic stellar haloes in the cdm model	we present six simulations of galactic stellar haloes formed by the tidaldisruption of accreted dwarf galaxies in a fully cosmological setting. ourmodel is based on the aquarius project, a suite of high resolution n-bodysimulations of individual dark matter haloes. we tag subsets of particles inthese simulations with stellar populations predicted by the galformsemi-analytic model. our method self-consistently tracks the dynamicalevolution and disruption of satellites from high redshift. the luminosityfunction and structural properties of surviving satellites, which agree wellwith observations, suggest that this technique is appropriate. we find thataccreted stellar haloes are assembled between 1&lt;z&lt;7 from less than 5significant progenitors. these progenitors are old, metal-rich satellites withstellar masses similar to the brightest milky way dwarf spheroidals. incontrast to previous stellar halo simulations, we find that several of thesemajor contributors survive as self-bound systems to the present day. both thenumber of these significant progenitors and their infall times are inherentlystochastic. this results in great diversity among our stellar haloes, whichamplifies small differences between the formation histories of their dark halohosts. the masses and density/surface-brightness profiles of the stellar haloesare consistent with expectations from the milky way and m31. each halo has acomplex structure, consisting of well-mixed components, tidal streams, shellsand other subcomponents. this structure is not adequately described by smoothmodels. we find one example of an accreted thick disk. contrasts in age andmetallicity between halo stars and those in surviving satellites are in broadagreement with recent observations.

0912.0629	particle hydrodynamics with tessellation techniques	lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) is a well-establishedapproach to model fluids in astrophysical problems, thanks to its geometricflexibility and ability to automatically adjust the spatial resolution to theclumping of matter. however, a number of recent studies have emphasizedinaccuracies of sph in the treatment of fluid instabilities. the origin ofthese numerical problems can be traced back to spurious surface effects acrosscontact discontinuities, and to sph's inherent prevention of mixing at theparticle level. we here investigate a new fluid particle model where thedensity estimate is carried out with the help of an auxiliary mesh constructedas the voronoi tessellation of the simulation particles instead of an adaptivesmoothing kernel. this voronoi-based approach improves the ability of thescheme to represent sharp contact discontinuities. we show that this eliminatesspurious surface tension effects present in sph and that play a role insuppressing certain fluid instabilities. we find that the new `voronoi particlehydrodynamics' described here produces comparable results than sph in shocks,and better ones in turbulent regimes of pure hydrodynamical simulations. wealso discuss formulations of the artificial viscosity needed in this scheme andhow judiciously chosen correction forces can be derived in order to maintain ahigh degree of particle order and hence a regular voronoi mesh. this isespecially helpful in simulating self-gravitating fluids with existing gravitysolvers used for n-body simulations.

1004.3094	substructure lensing: effects of galaxies, globular clusters &amp; satellite  streams	lensing flux-ratio anomalies have been frequently observed and taken asevidence for the presence of abundant dark matter substructures in lensinggalaxies, as predicted by the cold dark matter (cdm) model of cosmogony. inprevious work, we examined the cusp-caustic relations of the multiple images ofbackground quasars lensed by galaxy-scale dark matter haloes, using a suite ofhigh-resolution n-body simulations (the aquarius simulations). in this work, weextend our previous calculations to incorporate both the baryonic and diffusedark components in lensing haloes. we include in each lensing simulation: (1) asatellite galaxy population derived from a semi-analytic model applied to theaquarius haloes, (2) an empirical milky-way globular cluster population and (3)satellite streams (diffuse dark component) identified in the simulations.accounting for these extra components, we confirm our earlier conclusion thatthe abundance of intrinsic substructures (dark or bright, bound or diffuse) isnot sufficient to explain the observed frequency of cusp-caustic violations inthe class survey. we conclude that the observed effect could be the result ofthe small number statistics of class, or intergalactic haloes along the line ofsight acting as additional sources of lensing flux anomalies. anotherpossibility is that this discrepancy signals a failure of the cdm model.

1004.3217	satellite galaxies in hydrodynamical simulations of milky way sized  galaxies	collisionless simulations of the cdm cosmology predict a plethora of darkmatter substructures in the halos of milky way sized galaxies, yet the numberof known luminous satellites galaxies is very much smaller, a discrepancy thathas become known as the `missing satellite problem'. the most massivesubstructures have been shown to be plausibly the hosts of the brightestsatellites, but it remains unclear which processes prevent star formation inthe many other, purely dark substructures. we use high-resolution hydrodynamicsimulations of the formation of milky way sized galaxies in order to test howwell such self-consistent models of structure formation match the observedproperties of the galaxy's satellite population. for the first time, we includein such calculations feedback from cosmic rays injected into the star forminggas by supernovae as well as the energy input from supermassive black holesgrowing at the milky way's centre and its progenitor systems. we find thatnon-thermal particle populations quite strongly suppress the star formationefficiency of the smallest galaxies. in fact, our cosmic ray model is able toreproduce the observed faint-end of the satellite luminosity function, whilemodels that include only the effects of cosmic reionization, or galactic winds,do significantly worse. our simulated satellite population approximatelymatches available kinematic data on the satellites and their observed spatialdistribution. we conclude that a proper resolution of the missing satelliteproblem likely requires the inclusion of non-standard physics for regulatingstar formation in the smallest halos, and that cosmic reionization alone maynot be sufficient.

1006.2882	the statistics of the subhalo abundance of dark matter haloes	we study the population statistics of the surviving subhaloes of lcdm darkmatter haloes using a set of very high resolution n-body simulations. theseinclude both simulations of representative regions of the universe andultra-high resolution resimulations of individual dark matter haloes. we findthat more massive haloes tend to have a larger mass fraction in subhaloes. forexample, cluster size haloes typically have 7.5 percent of their mass withinr200 in substructures of fractional mass larger than 1e-5, which is 25 percenthigher than galactic haloes. there is, however, a large variance in the subhalomass fraction from halo to halo, whereas the subhalo abundance shows muchhigher regularity. for dark matter haloes of fixed mass, the subhalo abundancedecreases by 30 percent between redshift 2 and 0. the subhalo abundancefunction correlates with the host halo concentration parameter and formationredshift. however, the intrinsic scatter is not significantly reduced fornarrow ranges of concentration parameter or formation redshift, showing thatthey are not the dominant parameters that determine the subhalo abundance in ahalo.

0708.1881	the actual rees--sciama effect from the local universe	observations of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) have revealed anunexpected quadrupole-octopole alignment along a preferred axis pointing towardthe virgo cluster. we here investigate whether this feature can be explained inthe framework of the concordance model by secondary anisotropies produced bythe non-linear evolution of the gravitational potential, the so-calledrees-sciama (rs) effect. we focus on the effect caused by the localsuperclusters, which we calculate using a constrained high-resolutionhydrodynamical simulation, based on the iras 1.2-jy all-sky galaxy redshiftsurvey, which reproduces the main structures of our universe out to a distanceof 110 mpc from our galaxy. the resulting rs effect peaks at low multipoles andhas a minimum/maximum amplitude of -6.6\mu k 1.9\mu k. even though itsquadrupole is well aligned with the one measured for the cmb, its amplitude isnot sufficient to explain the observed magnitude of the quadrupole/octopolealignment. in addition, we analyze the wmap-3 data with a linear matched filterin an attempt to determine an upper limit for the rs signal amplitude on largescales. we found that it is possible to infer a weak upper limit of 30\mu k forits maximum amplitude.

1008.5114	assembly history and structure of galactic cold dark matter halos	we use the aquarius simulation series to study the imprint of assemblyhistory on the structure of galaxy-mass cold dark matter halos. our resultsconfirm earlier work regarding the influence of mergers on the mass densityprofile and the inside-out growth of halos. the inner regions that contain thevisible galaxies are stable since early times and are significantly affectedonly by major mergers. particles accreted diffusely or in minor mergers arefound predominantly in the outskirts of halos. our analysis reveals trends thatrun counter to current perceptions of hierarchical halo assembly. for example,major mergers (i.e. those with progenitor mass ratios greater than 1:10)contribute little to the total mass growth of a halo, on average less than 20per cent for our six aquarius halos. the bulk is contributed roughly equally byminor mergers and by "diffuse" material which is not resolved into individualobjects. this is consistent with modeling based on excursion-set theory whichsuggests that about half of this diffuse material should not be part of a haloof any scale. interestingly, the simulations themselves suggest that asignificantly fraction is not truly diffuse, since it was ejected from earlierhalos by mergers prior to their joining the main system. the aquariussimulations resolve halos to much lower mass scales than are expected to retaingas or form stars. these results thus confirm that most of the baryons fromwhich visible galaxies form are accreted diffusely, rather than throughmergers, and they suggest that only relatively rare major mergers will affectgalaxy structure at later times.

1107.1916	where will supersymmetric dark matter first be seen?	if the dark matter consists of supersymmetric particles, gamma-rayobservatories such as the large area telescope aboard the fermi satellite maydetect annihilation radiation from the haloes of galaxies and galaxy clusters.much recent effort has been devoted to searching for this signal around themilky way's dwarf satellites. using a new suite of high-resolution simulationsof galaxy cluster haloes (the phoenix project), together with the aquariussimulations of milky-way-like galaxy haloes, we show that highersignal-to-noise and equally clean signals are, in fact, predicted to come fromnearby rich galaxy clusters. most of the cluster emission is produced by smallsubhaloes with masses less than that of the sun. the large range of mass scalescovered by our two sets of simulations allows us to deduce a physicallymotivated extrapolation to these small (and unresolved) masses. since tidaleffects destroy subhaloes in the dense inner regions of haloes, most clusteremission is then predicted to come from large radii, implying that the nearestand brightest systems should be much more extended than fermi's angularresolution limit. the most promising targets for detection are clusters such ascoma and fornax, but detection algorithms must be tuned to the predictedprofile of the emission if they are to maximize the chance of finding this weaksignal.

1112.0315	the aquila comparison project: the effects of feedback and numerical  methods on simulations of galaxy formation	we compare the results of thirteen cosmological gasdynamical codes used tosimulate the formation of a galaxy in the lcdm structure formation paradigm.the various runs differ in their hydrodynamical treatment (sph, moving-mesh andamr) but share the same initial conditions and adopt their latest publishedmodel of cooling, star formation and feedback. despite the common halo assemblyhistory, we find large code-to-code variations in the stellar mass, size,morphology and gas content of the galaxy at z=0, due mainly to the differentimplementations of feedback. compared with observation, most codes tend toproduce an overly massive galaxy, smaller and less gas-rich than typicalspirals, with a massive bulge and a declining rotation curve. a stellar disk isdiscernible in most simulations, though its prominence varies widely from codeto code. there is a well-defined trend between the effects of feedback and theseverity of the disagreement with observation. models that are more effectiveat limiting the baryonic mass of the galaxy come closer to matching observedgalaxy scaling laws, but often to the detriment of the disk component. ourconclusions hold at two different numerical resolutions. some differences canalso be traced to the numerical techniques: more gas seems able to cool andbecome available for star formation in grid-based codes than in sph. however,this effect is small compared to the variations induced by different feedbackprescriptions. we conclude that state-of-the-art simulations cannot yetuniquely predict the properties of the baryonic component of a galaxy, evenwhen the assembly history of its host halo is fully specified. developingfeedback algorithms that can effectively regulate the mass of a galaxy withouthindering the formation of high-angular momentum stellar disks remains achallenge.

1201.1940	the phoenix project: the dark side of rich galaxy clusters	[abridged] we introduce the phoenix project, a set of $\lambda$cdmsimulations of the dark matter component of nine rich galaxy clusters. eachcluster is simulated at least at two different numerical resolutions. for eightof them, the highest resolution corresponds to $\sim 130$ million particleswithin the virial radius, while for one this number is over one billion. westudy the structure and substructure of these systems and contrast them withsix galaxy-sized dark matter haloes from the aquarius project, simulated atcomparable resolution. this comparison highlights the approximate massinvariance of cdm halo structure and substructure. we find little difference inthe spherically-averaged mass, pseudo-phase-space density, and velocityanisotropy profiles of aquarius and phoenix haloes. when scaled to the virialproperties of the host halo, the abundance and radial distribution of subhaloesare also very similar, despite the fact that aquarius and phoenix haloes differby roughly three decades in virial mass. the most notable difference is thatcluster haloes have been assembled more recently and are thus significantlyless relaxed than galaxy haloes, which leads to decreased regularity, increasedhalo-to-halo scatter and sizable deviations from the mean trends. thisaccentuates the effects of the strong asphericity of individual clusters onsurface density profiles, which may vary by up to a factor of three at a givenradius, depending on projection. the high apparent concentration reported forsome strong-lensing clusters might very well reflect these effects. a morerecent assembly also explains why substructure in some phoenix haloes isslightly more abundant than in aquarius, especially in the inner regions.resolved subhaloes nevertheless contribute only $11 \pm 3%$ of the virial massin phoenix clusters. .

1203.3216	scaling relations for galaxy clusters in the millennium-xxl simulation	we present a very large high-resolution cosmological n-body simulation, themillennium-xxl or mxxl, which uses 303 billion particles to represent theformation of dark matter structures throughout a 4.1gpc box in a lambdacdmcosmology. we create sky maps and identify large samples of galaxy clustersusing surrogates for four different observables: richness estimated from galaxysurveys, x-ray luminosity, integrated sunyaev-zeldovich signal, and lensingmass. the unprecedented combination of volume and resolution allows us toexplore in detail how these observables scale with each other and with clustermass. the scatter correlates between different mass-observable relationsbecause of common sensitivities to the internal structure, orientation andenvironment of clusters, as well as to line-of-sight superposition ofuncorrelated structure. we show that this can account for the apparentdiscrepancies uncovered recently between the mean thermal sz signals measuredfor optically and x-ray selected clusters by stacking data from the plancksatellite. related systematics can also affect inferences from extreme clustersdetected at high redshift. our results illustrate that cosmological conclusionsfrom galaxy cluster surveys depend critically on proper modelling, not only ofthe relevant physics, but also of the full distribution of the observables andof the selection biases induced by cluster identification procedures.

1203.5339	the journey of qso haloes from z=6 to the present	we apply a recently developed scaling technique to the millennium-xxl, one ofthe largest cosmological n-body simulations carried out to date 3x10^11particles within a cube of volume ~70gpc^3). this allows us to investigate thecosmological parameter dependence of the mass and evolution of haloes in theextreme high-mass tail of the z=6 distribution. we assume these objects to belikely hosts for the population of rare but ultraluminous high-redshift quasarsdiscovered by the sloan digital sky survey. haloes with a similar abundance tothese quasars have a median mass of 9x10^12 msun in the currently preferredcosmology, but do not evolve into equally extreme objects at z=0. rather, theirdescendants span the full range conventionally assigned to present-dayclusters, 6x10^13 to 2.5x10^15 msun for this same cosmology. the masses both atz=6 and at z=0 shift up or down by factors exceeding two if cosmologicalparameters are pushed to the boundaries of the range discussed in publishedinterpretations of data from the wmap satellite. the main factor determiningthe future growth of a high-mass z=6 halo is the mean overdensity of itsenvironment on scales of 7 to 14 mpc, and descendant masses can be predicted 6to 8 times more accurately if this density is known than if it is not. allthese features are not unique to extreme high-z haloes, but are generic tohierarchical growth. finally, we find that extreme haloes at z=6 typicallyacquired about half of their total mass in the preceding 100 myr, implying verylarge recent accretion rates which may be related to the large black holemasses and high luminosities of the sdss quasars.

1212.1452	simulations of magnetic fields in isolated disk galaxies	magnetic fields are known to be dynamically important in the interstellarmedium of our own galaxy, and they are ubiquitously observed in diffuse gas inthe halos of galaxies and galaxy clusters. yet, magnetic fields have typicallybeen neglected in studies of the formation of galaxies, leaving their globalinfluence on galaxy formation largely unclear. we extend our mhd implementationin the moving-mesh code arepo to cosmological problems which include radiativecooling and the formation of stars. in particular, we replace our previouslyemployed divergence cleaning approach with a powell 8-wave scheme, which turnsout to be significantly more stable, even in very dynamic environments. weverify the improved accuracy through simulations of the mri in accretion disks,that reproduce its correct linear growth rate. using this new mhd code, wesimulate the formation of isolated disk galaxies similar to the milky way usingidealized initial conditions with and without magnetic fields. we find that themagnetic field is quickly amplified in the initial starburst and thedifferential rotation of the forming disk until it eventually saturates when itbecomes comparable to the thermal pressure. the additional pressure componentleads to a lower star formation rate at late times compared to simulationswithout magnetic fields, and induces changes in the spiral arm structures ofthe gas disk. in addition, we observe highly magnetized fountain-like outflowsfrom the disk. these results are robust with numerical resolution and arelargely independent of the initial magnetic seed field assumed in the initialconditions, as the amplification process is rapid and self-regulated. ourfindings suggest an important influence of magnetic fields on galaxy formationand evolution, cautioning against their neglect in theoretical models ofstructure formation.

1302.2913	helium-ignited violent mergers as a unified model for normal and rapidly  declining type ia supernovae	the progenitors of type ia supernovae (sne ia) are still unknown, despitesignificant progress during the last years in theory and observations. violentmergers of two carbon--oxygen (co) white dwarfs (wds) are one candidatesuggested to be responsible for at least a significant fraction of normal sneia. here, we simulate the merger of two co wds using a moving-mesh code thatallows for the inclusion of thin helium (he) shells (0.01\,\msun) on top of thewds, at an unprecedented numerical resolution. the accretion of he onto theprimary wd leads to the formation of a detonation in its he shell. thisdetonation propagates around the co wd and sends a converging shock wave intoits core, known to robustly trigger a second detonation, as in the well-knowndouble-detonation scenario for  he-accreting co wds. however, in contrast to that scenario where a massive heshell is required to form a detonation through thermal instability, here the hedetonation is ignited dynamically. accordingly the required he-shell mass issignificantly smaller, and hence its burning products are unlikely to affectthe optical display of the explosion. we show that this scenario, which worksfor co primary wds with co- as well as he-wd companions, has the potential toexplain the different brightness distributions, delay times and relative ratesof normal and fast declining sne ia. finally, we discuss extensions to ourunified merger model needed to obtain a comprehensive picture of the fullobserved diversity of sne ia.

1312.2620	magnetic fields in cosmological simulations of disk galaxies	observationally, magnetic fields reach equipartition with thermal energy andcosmic rays in the interstellar medium of disk galaxies such as the milky way.however, thus far cosmological simulations of the formation and evolution ofgalaxies have usually neglected magnetic fields. we employ the moving-mesh code\textsc{arepo} to follow for the first time the formation and evolution of amilky way-like disk galaxy in its full cosmological context while taking intoaccount magnetic fields. we find that a prescribed tiny magnetic seed fieldgrows exponentially by a small-scale dynamo until it saturates around $z=4$with a magnetic energy of about $10\%$ of the kinetic energy in the center ofthe galaxy's main progenitor halo. by $z=2$, a well-defined gaseous disk formsin which the magnetic field is further amplified by differential rotation,until it saturates at an average field strength of $\sim 6 \mug$ in the diskplane. in this phase, the magnetic field is transformed from a chaoticsmall-scale field to an ordered large-scale field coherent on scales comparableto the disk radius. the final magnetic field strength, its radial profile andthe stellar structure of the disk compare well with observational data. a minormerger temporarily increases the magnetic field strength by about a factor oftwo, before it quickly decays back to its saturation value. our results arehighly insensitive to the initial seed field strength and suggest that thelarge-scale magnetic field in spiral galaxies can be explained as a result ofthe cosmic structure formation process.

astro-ph;0201544	the inner structure of lambdacdm halos i: a numerical convergence study	we present a comprehensive set of convergence tests which explore the role ofvarious numerical parameters on the equilibrium structure of a simulated darkmatter halo. we report results obtained with two independent, state-of-the-art,multi-stepping, parallel n-body codes: pkdgrav and gadget. we find thatconvergent mass profiles can be obtained for suitable choices of thegravitational softening, timestep, force accuracy, initial redshift, andparticle number. for softenings chosen so that particle discreteness effectsare negligible, convergence in the circular velocity is obtained at radii wherethe following conditions are satisfied: (i) the timestep is much shorter thanthe local orbital timescale; (ii) accelerations do not exceed a characteristicacceleration imprinted by the gravitational softening; and (iii) enoughparticles are enclosed so that the collisional relaxation timescale is longerthan the age of the universe. the most stringent requirement for convergence istypically that imposed on the particle number by the collisional relaxationcriterion, which implies that in order to estimate accurate circular velocitiesat radii where the density contrast may reach $\sim 10^6$, the region mustenclose of order 3000 particles (or more than a few times $10^6$ within thevirial radius). applying these criteria to a galaxy-sized $\lambda$cdm halo, wefind that the spherically-averaged density profile becomes progressivelyshallower from the virial radius inwards, reaching a logarithmic slopeshallower than -1.2 at the innermost resolved point, $r \sim 0.005 r_{200}$,with little evidence for convergence to a power-law behaviour in the innerregions.

astro-ph;0302575	cooling and heating the icm in hydrodynamical simulations	we discuss tree+sph simulations of galaxy clusters and groups, aimed atstudying the effect of cooling and non-gravitational heating on observableproperties of the icm. we simulate at high resolution four halos,with masses inthe range (0.2-4)10^{14}m_sol. we discuss the effects of using different sphimplementations and show that high resolution is mandatory to correctly followthe cooling pattern of the icm. all of our heating schemes which correctlyreproduce the x-ray scaling properties of clusters and groups do not succeed inreducing the fraction of collapsed gas below a level of 20 (30) per cent at thecluster (group) scale. finally, gas compression in cooling cluster regionscauses an increase of the temperature and a steepening of the temperatureprofiles, independent of the presence of non-gravitational heating processes.this is inconsistent with recent observational evidence for a decrease of gastemperature towards the center of relaxed clusters. provided thesediscrepancies persist even for a more refined modeling of energy feedback, theymay indicate that some basic physical process is still missing inhydrodynamical simulations.

astro-ph;0306205	substructures in cold dark matter haloes	we analyse the properties of substructures within dark matter halos(subhalos) using a set of high-resolution numerical simulations of theformation of structure in a lambda-cdm universe. our simulation set includes 11high-resolution simulations of massive clusters as well as a region of meandensity, allowing us to study the spatial and mass distribution ofsubstructures down to a mass resolution limit of 10^9 h^(-1)mo. we alsoinvestigate how the properties of substructures vary as a function of the massof the `parent' halo in which they are located. we find that the substructuremass function depends at most weakly on the mass of the parent halo and is welldescribed by a power-law. the radial number density profiles of substructuresare steeper in low mass halos than in high mass halos. more massivesubstructures tend to avoid the centres of halos and are preferentially locatedin the external regions of their parent halos. we also study the mass accretionand merging histories of substructures, which we find to be largely independentof environment. we find that a significant fraction of the substructuresresiding in clusters at the present day were accreted at redshifts z &lt; 1. thisimplies that a significant fraction of present-day `passive' cluster galaxiesshould have been still outside the cluster progenitor and more active at z~1.

astro-ph;0310576	the inner structure of lcdm halos ii: halo mass profiles and lsb  rotation curves	we use a set of high-resolution cosmological n-body simulations toinvestigate the inner mass profile of galaxy-sized cold dark matter (cdm)halos. these simulations extend the thorough numerical convergence studypresented in paper i of this series (power et al. 2003), and demonstrate thatthe mass profile of cdm halos can be robustly estimated beyond a minimumconverged radius of order r_conv ~ 1 kpc/h in our highest resolution runs. thedensity profiles of simulated halos become progressively shallow from thevirial radius inwards, and show no sign of approaching a well-defined power-lawbehaviour near the centre. at r_conv, the logarithmic slope of the densityprofile is steeper than the asymptotic \rho \propto r^-1 expected from theformula proposed by navarro, frenk, and white (1996), but significantlyshallower than the steeply divergent \rho \propto r^-1.5 cusp proposed by mooreet al. (1999). we perform a direct comparison of the spherically-averaged darkmatter circular velocity (v_c) profiles with rotation curves of low surfacebrightness (lsb) galaxies from the samples of de blok et al. (2001), de blokand bosma (2002), and swaters et al. (2003). most (about two-thirds) lsbgalaxies in this dataset are roughly consistent with cdm halo v_c profiles.however, about one third of lsbs in these samples feature a sharp transitionbetween the rising and flat part of the rotation curve that is not seen in thev_c profiles of cdm halos. this discrepancy has been interpreted as excludingthe presence of cusps, but we argue that it might simply reflect the differencebetween circular velocity and gas rotation speed likely to arise in gaseousdisks embedded within realistic, triaxial cdm halos.

0808.3401	substructures in hydrodynamical cluster simulations	the abundance and structure of dark matter subhalos has been analyzedextensively in recent studies of dark matter-only simulations, butcomparatively little is known about the impact of baryonic physics on halosubstructures. we here extend the subfind algorithm for substructureidentification such that it can be reliably applied to dissipativehydrodynamical simulations that include star formation. this allows, inparticular, the identification of galaxies as substructures in simulations ofclusters of galaxies, and a determination of their content of gravitationallybound stars, dark matter, and hot and cold gas. using a large set ofcosmological cluster simulations, we present a detailed analysis of halosubstructures in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, focusing inparticular on the influence both of radiative and non-radiative gas physics,and of non-standard physics such as thermal conduction and feedback by galacticoutflows. we also examine the impact of numerical nuisance parameters such asartificial viscosity parameterizations. we find that diffuse hot gas isefficiently stripped from subhalos when they enter the highly pressurizedcluster atmosphere. this has the effect of decreasing the subhalo mass functionrelative to a corresponding dark matter-only simulation. these effects aremitigated in radiative runs, where baryons condense in the central subhaloregions and form compact stellar cores. however, in all cases, only a verysmall fraction, of the order of one percent, of subhalos within the clustervirial radii preserve a gravitationally bound hot gaseous atmosphere.(abridged)

astro-ph;0401252	disk galaxy formation in a lambdacdm universe	we describe hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation in a lambda colddark matter (cdm) cosmology performed using a subresolution model for starformation and feedback in a multiphase interstellar medium (ism). inparticular, we demonstrate the formation of a well-resolved disk galaxy. thesurface brightness profile of the galaxy is exponential, with a b-band centralsurface brightness of 21.0 mag arcsec^-2 and a scale-length of r_d = 2.0 h^-1kpc. we find no evidence for a significant bulge component. the simulatedgalaxy falls within the i-band tully-fisher relation, with an absolutemagnitude of i = -21.2 and a peak stellar rotation velocity of v_rot=121.3 kms^-1. while the total specific angular momentum of the stars in the galaxyagrees with observations, the angular momentum in the inner regions appears tobe low by a factor of ~2. the star formation rate of the galaxy peaks at ~7m_sun yr^-1 between redshifts z=2-4, with the mean stellar age decreasing from\~10 gyrs in the outer regions of the disk to ~7.5 gyrs in the center,indicating that the disk did not simply form inside-out. the stars exhibit ametallicity gradient from 0.7 z_sun at the edge of the disk to 1.3 z_sun in thecenter. using a suite of idealized galaxy formation simulations with differentmodels for the ism, we show that the effective pressure support provided bystar formation and feedback in our multiphase model is instrumental in allowingthe formation of large, stable disk galaxies. if ism gas is instead modeledwith an isothermal equation of state, or if star formation is suppressedentirely, growing gaseous disks quickly violate the toomre stability criterionand undergo catastrophic fragmentation.

astro-ph;0401456	thermal conduction in cosmological sph simulations	thermal conduction in the intracluster medium has been proposed as a possibleheating mechanism for offsetting central cooling losses in rich clusters ofgalaxies. in this study, we introduce a new formalism to model conduction in adiffuse ionised plasma using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph), and weimplement it in the parallel treepm/sph-code gadget-2. we consider onlyisotropic conduction and assume that magnetic suppression can be described interms of an effective conductivity, taken as a fixed fraction of thetemperature-dependent spitzer rate. we also account for saturation effects inlow-density gas. our formulation manifestly conserves thermal energy even forindividual and adaptive timesteps, and is stable in the presence of small-scaletemperature noise. this allows us to evolve the thermal diffusion equation withan explicit time integration scheme along with the ordinary hydrodynamics. weuse a series of simple test problems to demonstrate the robustness and accuracyof our method. we then apply our code to spherically symmetric realizations ofclusters, constructed under the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and alocal balance between conduction and radiative cooling. while we confirm thatconduction can efficiently suppress cooling flows for an extended period oftime in these isolated systems, we do not find a similarly strong effect in afirst set of clusters formed in self-consistent cosmological simulations.however, their temperature profiles are significantly altered by conduction, asis the x-ray luminosity.

astro-ph;0401470	thermal conduction in simulated galaxy clusters	we study the formation of clusters of galaxies using high-resolutionhydrodynamic cosmological simulations that include the effect of thermalconduction with an effective isotropic conductivity of 1/3 the classicalspitzer value. we find that, both for a hot ($t_{\rm ew}\simeq 12$ kev) andseveral cold ($t_{\rm ew}\simeq 2$ kev) galaxy clusters, the baryonic fractionconverted into stars does not change significantly when thermal conduction isincluded. however, the temperature profiles are modified, particularly in oursimulated hot system, where an extended isothermal core is readily formed. as aconsequence of heat flowing from the inner regions of the cluster both to itsouter parts and into its innermost resolved regions, the entropy profile isaltered as well. this effect is almost negligible for the cold cluster, asexpected based on the strong temperature dependence of the conductivity. ourresults demonstrate that while thermal conduction can have a significantinfluence on the properties of the intra--cluster medium of rich galaxyclusters, it appears unlikely to provide by itself a solution for theovercooling problem in clusters, or to explain the current discrepanciesbetween the observed and simulated properties of the intra--cluster medium.

astro-ph;0405365	measuring cluster peculiar velocities with the sunyaev-zeldovich  effects: scaling relations and systematics	the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (cmb) intensity due tothe sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect are the sum of a thermal and a kineticcontribution. separating the two components to measure the peculiar velocity ofgalaxy clusters requires radio and microwave observations at three or morefrequencies, and knowledge of the temperature t_e of the intracluster mediumweighted by the electron number density. to quantify the systematics of thisprocedure, we extract a sample of 117 massive clusters at redshift z=0 from ann-body hydrodynamical simulation, with 2x480^3 particles, of a cosmologicalvolume 192 mpc/h on a side of a flat cold dark matter model with omega_0=0.3and lambda=0.7. our simulation includes radiative cooling, star formation andthe effect of feedback and galactic winds from supernovae. we find that (1) oursimulated clusters reproduce the observed scaling relations between x-ray andsz properties; (2) bulk flows internal to the intracluster medium affect thevelocity estimate by less than 200 km/s in 93 per cent of the cases; (3) usingthe x-ray emission weighted temperature, as an estimate of t_e, canoverestimate the peculiar velocity by 20-50 per cent, if the microwaveobservations do not spatially resolve the cluster. for spatially resolvedclusters, the assumptions on the spatial distribution of the icm, required toseparate the two sz components, still produce a velocity overestimate of 10-20per cent, even with an unbiased measure of t_e. thanks to the large size of ourcluster samples, these results set a robust lower limit of 200 km/s to thesystematic errors that will affect upcoming measures of cluster peculiarvelocities with the sz effect.

astro-ph;0408132	disk galaxy rotation curves in triaxial cdm halos	we use n-body hydrodynamical simulations to study the structure of disks intriaxial potentials resembling cdm halos. our analysis focuses on the accuracyof the dark mass distribution inferred from rotation curves derived fromsimulated long-slit spectra. we consider a massless disk embedded in a halowith axis ratios of 0.5:0.6:1.0 and with its rotation axis aligned with theminor axis of the halo. closed orbits for the gaseous particles deviate fromcoplanar circular symmetry, resulting in a variety of long-slit rotation curveshapes, depending on the orientation of the disk relative to the line of sight.rotation curves may thus differ significantly from the spherically-averagedcircular velocity profile of the dark matter halo. "solid-body" rotationcurves--typically interpreted as a signature of a constant density core in thedark matter distribution--are obtained about 25% of the time for randomorientations although the dark matter follows the cuspy density profileproposed by navarro, frenk &amp; white (nfw). we conclude that the discrepanciesreported between the shape of the rotation curve of low surface brightnessgalaxies and the structure of cdm halos may be resolved once the complexeffects of halo triaxiality on the dynamics of the gas component is properlytaken into account.

astro-ph;0502044	accretion of cool stellar winds on sgr a*: another puzzle of the  galactic centre?	sgr a* is currently being fed by winds from a cluster of gravitationallybound young mass-loosing stars. using observational constraints on the orbits,mass loss rates and wind velocities of these stars, we numerically model thedistribution of gas in the ~ 0.1--10'' region around sgr a*. we find thatradiative cooling of recently discovered slow winds leads to the formation ofmany cool filaments and blobs, and to a thin and rather light accretion disc ofabout an arcsecond scale. the disc however does not extend all the way to ourinner boundary. instead, hot x-ray emitting gas dominates the inner arcsecond.in our simulations, cool streams of gas frequently enter this region on lowangular momentum orbits, and are then disrupted and heated up to the ambienthot gas temperature. the accreting gas around sgr a* is thus two-phase, with ahot component, observable at x-ray wavelengths, and a cool component, which maybe responsible for the majority of time variability of sgr a* emission onhundred and thousand years time-scales. we obtain an accretion rate of a fewtimes 10^-6 msun/year, consistent with chandra estimates, but variable ontime-scales even shorter than hundred years. these results strongly depend onthe chosen stellar orbits and wind parameters. further observational input isthus key to a better modelling of sgr a* wind accretion.

astro-ph;0504265	entropy amplification from energy feedback in simulated galaxy groups  and clusters	we use hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters and groups to study theeffect of pre-heating on the entropy structure of the icm. our simulationsaccount for non-gravitational heating of the gas either by imposing a minimumentropy floor at redshift z=3, or by considering feedback by galactic windspowered by supernova (sn) energy. in the adiabatic simulations we find that theentropy is increased out to the external regions as a consequence of thetransition from clumpy to smooth accretion induced by extra heating. thisresult is in line with the predictions of the semi-analytical model by voit etal. however, the introduction of radiative cooling substantially reduces thisentropy amplification effect. while galactic winds of increasing strength areeffective in regulating star formation, they have a negligible effect on theentropy profile of cluster-sized halos. only in models where the action of thewinds is complemented with diffuse heating corresponding to a pre-collapseentropy do we find a sizable entropy amplification out to the virial radius ofthe groups. observational evidence for entropy amplification in the outskirtsof galaxy clusters and groups therefore favours a scenario for feedback thatdistributes heating energy in a more diffuse way than predicted by the modelfor galactic winds from sn explosions explored here.

astro-ph;0505382	galactic centre stellar winds and sgr a* accretion	(abridged) we present in detail our new 3d numerical models for the accretionof stellar winds on to sgr a*. in our most sophisticated models, we put starson realistic orbits around sgr a*, include `slow' winds (300 km/s), and accountfor radiative cooling. we first model only one phase `fast' stellar winds (1000km/s). for wind sources fixed in space, the accretion rate is mdot ~ 1e-5msun/yr, fluctuates by &lt; 10%, and is in a good agreement with previous models.in contrast, mdot decreases by an order of magnitude for stars followingcircular orbits, and fluctuates by ~ 50%. then we allow a fraction of stars toproduce slow winds. much of these winds cool radiatively, forming cold clumpsimmersed into the x-ray emitting gas. we test two orbital configurations forthe stars in this scenario, an isotropic distribution and two rotating discswith perpendicular orientation. the morphology of cold gas is quite sensitiveto the orbits. in both cases, however, most of the accreted gas is hot, with analmost constant mdot ~ 3e-6 msun/yr, consistent with chandra observations. thecold gas accretes in intermittent, short but powerful episodes which may giverise to large amplitude variability in the luminosity of sgr a* on time scalesof 10s to 100s of years. the circularisation radii for the flows are ~ 1e3 and1e4 rsch, for the one and two-phase wind simulations, respectively, neverforming the quasi-spherical accretion flows suggested in some previous work.our work suggests that, averaged over time scales of 100s to 1000s of years,the radiative and mechanical luminosity of sgr a* may be substantially higherthan it is in its current state. further improvements of the wind accretionmodelling of sgr a* will rely on improved observational constraints for thewind properties and stellar orbits.

astro-ph;0505440	feedback and metal enrichment in cosmological sph simulations i. a model  for chemical enrichment	we discuss a model for treating chemical enrichment by snii and sniaexplosions in simulations of cosmological structure formation. our modelincludes metal-dependent radiative cooling and star formation in densecollapsed gas clumps. metals are returned into the diffuse interstellar mediumby star particles using a local sph smoothing kernel. a variety of chemicalabundance patterns in enriched gas arise in our treatment owing to thedifferent yields and lifetimes of snii and snia progenitor stars. in the caseof snii chemical production, we adopt metal-dependent yields. because of thesensitive dependence of cooling rates on metallicity, enrichment of galactichaloes with metals can in principle significantly alter subsequent gas infalland the build up of the stellar components. indeed, in simulations of isolatedgalaxies we find that a consistent treatment of metal-dependent coolingproduces 25% more stars outside the central region than simulations with aprimordial cooling function. in the highly-enriched central regions, theevolution of baryons is however not affected by metal cooling, because here thegas is always dense enough to cool. a similar situation is found incosmological simulations because we include no strong feedback processes whichcould spread metals over large distances and mix them into unenriched diffusegas. we demonstrate this explicitly with test simulations which adoptsuper-solar cooling functions leading to large changes both in the stellar massand in the metal distributions. we also find that the impact of metallicity onthe star formation histories of galaxies may depend on their particularevolutionary history. our results hence emphasise the importance of feedbackprocesses for interpreting the cosmic metal enrichment.

astro-ph;0511053	the fundamental scaling relations of elliptical galaxies	(abridged) we examine the fundamental scaling relations of ellipticalgalaxies formed through mergers. using hundreds of simulations to judge theimpact of progenitor galaxy properties on merger remnants, we find that gasdissipation provides an important contribution to tilt in the fundamental planerelation. dissipationless mergers of disks produce remnants that occupy thevirial plane. as the gas content of disk galaxies is increased, the tilt of thefundamental plane relation increases and the slope of the re-m_* relationsteepens. for gas fractions fgas &gt; 30%, the simulated fundamental planescalings approach those observed in the k-band. in our simulations, feedbackfrom supermassive black hole growth has only a minor influence on thestellar-mass scaling relations of spheroidal galaxies, but may play a role inmaintaining the observed fundamental plane tilt at optical wavelengths bysuppressing residual star formation in merger remnants.  we estimate that \approx 40-100% of the fundamental plane tilt induced bystructural properties owes to trends in the central total-to-stellar mass ratiom_total/m_* produced by dissipation. lower mass systems obtain greater phase-space densities than higher mass systems, producing a galaxy mass-dependentcentral m_total/m_* and a corresponding tilt in the fundamental plane.

astro-ph;0512426	the influence of baryons on the clustering of matter and weak lensing  surveys	future weak lensing measurements of cosmic shear will reach such highaccuracy that second order effects in weak lensing modeling, like the influenceof baryons on structure formation, become important. we use a controlled set ofstate of the art cosmological simulations to quantify this effect by comparingpure n-body dark matter runs with corresponding hydrodynamical simulations,carried out both in non-radiative, and in dissipative form with cooling andstar formation. in both hydrodynamical simulations, the clustering of the gasis suppressed while that of dark matter is boosted at scales k&gt;1 h/mpc. despitethis counterbalance between dark matter and gas, the clustering of the totalmatter is suppressed by up to 1 percent at 1&lt;k&lt;10 h/mpc, while for k ~ 20 h/mpcit is boosted, up to 2 percent in the non-radiative run and 10 percent in therun with star formation. the stellar mass formed in the latter is highly biasedrelative to the dark matter in the pure n-body simulation. using our powerspectrum measurements to predict the effect of baryons on the weak lensingsignal at 100&lt;l&lt;10000, we find that baryons may change the lensing powerspectrum by less than 0.5 percent at l&lt;1000, but by 1 to 10 percent at1000&lt;l&lt;10000. the size of the effect exceeds the predicted accuracy of futurelensing power spectrum measurements and will likely be detected. precisedeterminations of cosmological parameters with weak lensing, and studies ofsmall-scale fluctuations and clustering, therefore rely on properly includingbaryonic physics.

astro-ph;0612327	the shape of the gravitational potential in cold dark matter halos	we use a set of cosmological n-body simulations to investigate the structuralshape of galaxy-sized cold dark matter (cdm) halos. unlike most previous workon the subject - which dealt with shapes as measured by the inertia tensor - wefocus here on the shape of the gravitational potential, a quantity moredirectly relevant to comparison with observational probes. a further advantageis that the potential is less sensitive to the effects of substructure and, asa consequence, the isopotential surfaces are typically smooth and wellapproximated by concentric ellipsoids. our main result is that the asphericityof the potential increases rapidly towards the center of the halo. the radialtrend is more pronounced than expected from constant flattening in the massdistribution, and reflects a strong tendency for dark matter halos to becomeincreasingly aspherical inwards. near the center the halo potential isapproximately prolate ((c/a)_0=0.72 +/- 0.04, (b/a)_0=0.78 +/- 0.08), but itbecomes increasingly spherical in the outer regions. the principal axes of theisopotential surfaces remain well aligned, and in most halos the angularmomentum tends to be parallel to the minor axis and perpendicular to the majoraxis. this suggests that galactic disks may form in a plane where the potentialis elliptical and where its ellipticity varies rapidly with radius. this canresult in significant deviations from circular motion in systems such as lowsurface brightness galaxies (lsbs), even for relatively minor deviations fromcircular symmetry. simulated long-slit rotation curves can appear similar tothose of lsbs often cited as evidence for constant density "cores". thissuggests that taking into account the 3d shape of the dark mass distributionmight help to reconcile such evidence with the cuspy mass profile of cdm halos.

astro-ph;0702241	virial scaling of massive dark matter halos: why clusters prefer a high  normalization cosmology	we present a precise estimate of the bulk virial scaling relation of halosformed via hierarchical clustering in an ensemble of simulated cold dark mattercosmologies. the result is insensitive to cosmological parameters, the presenceof a trace, dissipationless gas component, and numerical resolution down to alimit of ~1000 particles. the dark matter velocity dispersion scales with totalmass as log(sigma_{dm}(m,z)) = log(1082.9 +- 4.0 \kms) + (0.3361 +- 0.0026)log(h(z)m_{200}/10^{15} msun), with h(z) the dimensionless hubble parameter. atfixed mass, the velocity dispersion likelihood is nearly log-normal, withscatter sigma_{ln sigma} = 0.0426 +- 0.015, except for a tail to higherdispersions containing 10% of the population that are merger transients. wecombine this relation with the halo mass function in lcdm models, and show thata low normalization condition, s_8 = sigma_8(omega_m/0.3)^{0.35} \= 0.69,favored by recent wmap and sdss analysis requires that galaxy and gas specificenergies in rich clusters be 50% larger than that of the underlying darkmatter. such large energetic biases are in conflict with the current generationof direct simulations of cluster formation. a higher normalization, s_8 = 0.80,alleviates this tension and implies that the hot gas fraction within r_{500} is(0.71 +- 0.09) h_{70}^{-3/2} omega_b/\omega_m, a value consistent with recentsunyaev-zel'dovich observations.

astro-ph;9710368	genus statistics of the virgo n-body simulations and the 1.2-jy redshift  survey	we study the topology of the virgo n-body simulations and compare it to the1.2-jy redshift survey of iras galaxies by means of the genus statistic. fourhigh-resolution simulations of variants of the cdm cosmology are considered: aflat standard model (scdm), a variant of it with more large-scale power (tcdm),and two low density universes, one open (ocdm) and one flat (lcdm). the fullysampled n-body simulations are examined down to strongly nonlinear scales, bothwith spatially fixed smoothing, and with an adaptive smoothing technique. whilethe tcdm, lcdm, and ocdm simulations have very similar genus statistics in theregime accessible to fixed smoothing, they can be separated with adaptivesmoothing at small mass scales. in order to compare the n-body models with the1.2-jy survey, we extract large ensembles of mock catalogues from thesimulations. these mock surveys are used to test for systematic effects in thegenus analysis and to establish the distribution of errors of the genus curve.we find that a simple multivariate analysis of the genus measurements iscompromised both by non-gaussian distributed errors and by noise that dominatesthe covariance matrix. we therefore introduce a principal components analysisof the genus curve. with a likelihood ratio test we find that the 1.2-jy datafavours the lcdm, tcdm and ocdm models compared to scdm. when genusmeasurements for different smoothing scales are combined, the scdm model can beexcluded at a 99% confidence level, while the other three models fit the 1.2-jydata well.

astro-ph;9712228	the topology of the iras point source catalogue redshift survey	we investigate the topology of the new point source catalogue redshift survey(pscz) of iras galaxies by means of the genus statistic. the survey maps thelocal universe with approximately 15000 galaxies over 84.1 per cent of the skyand provides an unprecedented number of resolution elements for the topologicalanalysis. for comparison with the pscz data we also examine the genus of largen-body simulations of four variants of the cold dark matter cosmogony. thesimulations are part of the virgo project to simulate the formation ofstructure in the universe. we assume that the statistical properties of thegalaxy distribution can be identified with those of the dark matter particlesin the simulations. we extend the standard genus analysis by examining theinfluence of sampling noise on the genus curve and introducing a statistic ableto quantify the amount of phase correlation present in the density field, the"amplitude drop" of the genus compared to a gaussian field with identical powerspectrum. the results for pscz are consistent with the hypothesis ofrandom-phase initial conditions. in particular, no strong phase correlation isdetected on scales ranging from 10 h^(-1)mpc to 32 h^(-1)mpc, whereas there isa positive detection of phase correlation at smaller scales. among thesimulations, phase correlations are detected in all models at small scales,albeit with different strengths. when scaled to a common normalization, theamplitude drop primarily depends on the shape of the power spectrum. we findthat the constant bias standard cdm model can be ruled out at high significancebecause the shape of its power spectrum is not consistent with pscz. the othercdm models with more large-scale power all fit the pscz data almost equallywell, with a slight preference for a high-density taucdm model.

0812.0288	phase-space structures ii: hierarchical structure finder	a new multi-dimensional hierarchical structure finder (hsf) to study thephase-space structure of dark matter in n-body cosmological simulations ispresented. the algorithm depends mainly on two parameters, which control thelevel of connectivity of the detected structures and their significancecompared to poisson noise. by working in 6d phase-space, where contrasts aremuch more pronounced than in 3d position space, our hsf algorithm is capable ofdetecting subhaloes including their tidal tails, and can recognise otherphase-space structures such as pure streams and candidate caustics. if anadditional unbinding criterion is added, the algorithm can be used as aself-consistent halo and subhalo finder. as a test, we apply it to a large haloof the millennium simulation, where 19 % of the halo mass are found to belongto bound substructures, which is more than what is detected with conventional3d substructure finders, and an additional 23-36 % of the total mass belongs tounbound hsf structures. the distribution of identified phase-space densitypeaks is clearly bimodal: high peaks are dominated by the bound structures andlow peaks belong mostly to tidal streams. in order to better understand whathsf provides, we examine the time evolution of structures, based on the mergertree history. bound structures typically make only up to 6 orbits inside themain halo. still, hsf can identify at the present time at least 80 % of theoriginal content of structures with a redshift of infall as high as z &lt;= 0.3,which illustrates the significant power of this tool to perform dynamicalanalyses in phase-space.

0812.1801	an implementation of radiative transfer in the cosmological simulation  code gadget	we present a novel numerical implementation of radiative transfer in thecosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulation code {\smallgadget}. it is based on a fast, robust and photon-conserving integration schemewhere the radiation transport problem is approximated in terms of moments ofthe transfer equation and by using a variable eddington tensor as a closurerelation, following the `otvet'-suggestion of gnedin &amp; abel. we derive asuitable anisotropic diffusion operator for use in the sph discretization ofthe local photon transport, and we combine this with an implicit solver thatguarantees robustness and photon conservation. this entails a matrix inversionproblem of a huge, sparsely populated matrix that is distributed in memory inour parallel code. we solve this task iteratively with a conjugate gradientscheme. finally, to model photon sink processes we consider ionisation andrecombination processes of hydrogen, which is represented with a chemicalnetwork that is evolved with an implicit time integration scheme. we presentseveral tests of our implementation, including single and multiple sources instatic uniform density fields with and without temperature evolution, shadowingby a dense clump, and multiple sources in a static cosmological density field.all tests agree quite well with analytical computations or with predictionsfrom other radiative transfer codes, except for shadowing. however, unlike mostother radiative transfer codes presently in use for studying reionisation, ournew method can be used on-the-fly during dynamical cosmological simulation,allowing simultaneous treatments of galaxy formation and the reionisationprocess of the universe.
