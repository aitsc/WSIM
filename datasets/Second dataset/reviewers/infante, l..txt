0901.4919	a search for massive ucds in the centaurus galaxy cluster	we recently initiated a search for ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (ucds) in thecentaurus galaxy cluster (mieske et al. 2007), resulting in the discovery of 27compact objects with -12.2&lt;m_v&lt;-10.9 mag. our overall survey completeness was15-20% within 120 kpc projected clustercentric distance. in order to betterconstrain the luminosity distribution of the brightest ucds in centaurus, wecontinue our search by substantially improving our survey completenessspecifically in the regime m_v&lt;-12 mag (v_0&lt;21.3 mag). using vimos at the vlt,we obtain low-resolution spectra of 400 compact objects with 19.3&lt;v_0&lt;21.3 mag(-14&lt;m_v&lt;-12 mag at the centaurus distance) in the central 25' of the centauruscluster, which corresponds to a projected radius of ~150 kpc. our survey yieldscomplete area coverage within ~120 kpc. for 94% of the sources included in themasks we successfully measure a redshift. due to incompleteness in the slitassignment, our final completeness in the area surveyed is 52%. among ourtargets we find three new ucds in the magnitude range -12.2&lt;m_v&lt;-12 mag, henceat the faint limit of our survey. one of them is covered by archival hst wfpc2imaging, yielding a size estimate of r_h &lt;= 8-9 pc. at 95% confidence we canreject the hypothesis that in the area surveyed there are more than 2 massiveucds with m_v&lt;-12.2 mag and r_eff &lt;=70 pc. our survey hence confirms theextreme rareness of massive ucds. we find that the radial distributions ofcentaurus and fornax ucds with respect to their host clusters' centers agreewithin the 2 sigma level.

0902.2403	near-ir galaxy counts and evolution from the wide-field alhambra survey	the alhambra survey aims to cover 4 square degrees using a system of 20contiguous, equal width, medium-band filters spanning the range 3500 a to 9700a plus the standard jhks filters. here we analyze deep near-ir number counts ofone of our fields (alh08) for which we have a relatively large area (0.5 squaredegrees) and faint photometry (j=22.4, h=21.3 and k=20.0 at the 50% of recoveryefficiency for point-like sources). we find that the logarithmic gradient ofthe galaxy counts undergoes a distinct change to a flatter slope in each band:from 0.44 at [17.0, 18.5] to 0.34 at [19.5, 22.0] for the j band; for the hband 0.46 at [15.5, 18.0] to 0.36 at [19.0, 21.0], and in ks the change is from0.53 in the range [15.0, 17.0] to 0.33 in the interval [18.0, 20.0]. theseobservations together with faint optical counts are used to constrain modelsthat include density and luminosity evolution of the local type-dependentluminosity functions. our models imply a decline in the space density ofevolved early-type galaxies with increasing redshift, such that only 30% - 50%of the bulk of the present day red-ellipticals was already in place at z~1.

0706.2724	a search for ultra-compact dwarf galaxies in the centaurus galaxy  cluster	aim: to extend the investigations of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (ucds)beyond the well studied fornax and virgo clusters. methods: we measuredspectroscopic redshifts of about 400 compact object candidates with 19.2 &lt; v &lt;22.4 mag in the central region of the centaurus galaxy cluster (d=43mpc), usingvimos@vlt. the luminosity range of the candidates covers that of brightglobular clusters (gcs) and of ucds in fornax and virgo. results: we confirmthe cluster membership of 27 compact objects, covering an absolute magnituderange -12.2 &lt; m_v &lt; -10.9 mag. we do not find counterparts to the two verylarge and bright ucds in fornax and virgo with m_v=-13.5 mag, possibly due tosurvey incompleteness. the compact objects' distribution in magnitude and spaceis consistent with that of the gc population. their kinematics and spatialdistribution associate them to the central galaxies rather than to the overallcluster potential. the compact objects have a mean metallicity consistent withthat of the metal-rich globular cluster sub-population. compact objects withhigh s/n spectra exhibit solar [alpha/fe] abundances, consistent with typicaldwarf elliptical galaxy values and unlike galactic bulge globular clusters. hstbased size estimates for a sub-sample of eight compact objects reveal theexistence of one very large object with half-light radius r_h around 30 pc,having m_v=-11.6 mag (~10^7 m_sun). this source shows super-solar [alpha/fe]abundances. seven further sources are only marginally larger than typical gcswith r_h in the range 4 to 10 pc. conclusions: we consider the largest compactobject found to be the only bona-fide ucd detected in our study. in order toimprove our understanding of ucds in centaurus, a significant increase of oursurvey completeness is necessary.

0903.3988	bright strongly lensed galaxies at redshift z~ 6-7 behind the clusters  abell 1703 and cl0024+161	we report on the discovery of three bright, strongly-lensed objects behindabell 1703 and cl0024+16 from a dropout search over 25 square arcminutes ofdeep nicmos data, with deep acs optical coverage. they are undetected in thedeep acs images below 8500 a and have clear detections in the j and h bands.fits to the acs, nicmos and irac data yield robust photometric redshifts in therange z~6-7 and largely rule out the possibility that they are low-redshiftinterlopers. all three objects are extended, and resolved into a pair of brightknots. the bright i-band dropout in abell 1703 has an h-band ab magnitude of23.9, which makes it one of the brightest known galaxy candidates at z&gt;5.5. ourmodel fits suggest a young, massive galaxy only ~ 60 million years old with amass of ~ 1e10 solar mass. the dropout galaxy candidates behind cl0024+16 areseparated by 2.5" (~ 2 kpc in the source plane), and have h-band ab magnitudesof 25.0 and 25.6. lensing models of cl0024+16 suggest that the objects havecomparable intrinsic magnitudes of ab ~ 27.3, approximately one magnitudefainter than l* at z~6.5. their similar redshifts, spectral energydistribution, and luminosities, coupled with their very close proximity on thesky, suggest that they are spatially associated, and plausibly are physicallybound. combining this sample with two previously reported, similarly magnifiedgalaxy candidates at z~6-8, we find that complex systems with dual nuclei maybe a common feature of high-redshift galaxies.

0911.0420	the globular cluster system of ngc 1399 v. dynamics of the cluster  system out to 80 kpc	(abridged) we use the largest set of globular cluster velocities obtained sofar of any elliptical galaxy to revise and extend the previous investigationsof the dynamics of ngc 1399, the central dominant galaxy of the nearby fornaxcluster of galaxies. our sample now comprises velocities for almost 700 gcswith projected galactocentric radii between 6 and 100 kpc. in addition, we usevelocities published by bergond et al. (2007). we study the kinematics of themetal-poor and metal-rich subpopulations and perform spherical jeans modelling.  the most important results are: the metal-rich (red) gcs resemble the stellarfield population of ngc 1399 in the region of overlap. both subpopulations arekinematically distinct and do not show a smooth transition. it is not possibleto find a common dark halo which reproduces simultaneously the properties ofboth subpopulations. some velocities of blue gcs are only to be explained byorbits with very large apogalactic distances, thus indicating a contaminationwith gcs which belong to the entire fornax cluster rather than to ngc 1399.stripped gcs from nearby elliptical galaxies, particularly ngc 1404, may alsocontaminate the metal-poor sample. we argue in favour of a scenario in whichthe majority of the blue cluster population has been accreted during theassembly of the fornax cluster. the red cluster population shares the dynamicalhistory of the galaxy itself. therefore we recommend to use a dark halo basedon the red gcs alone. the dark halo which fits best is marginally less massivethan the halo quoted by richtler et al. (2004). the comparison with x-rayanalyses is satisfactory in the inner regions, but without showing evidence fora transition from a galaxy to a cluster halo, as suggested by x-ray work.

1001.2769	the acs fornax cluster survey. ix. the color-magnitude relation of  globular cluster systems	we investigate the color-magnitude relation for globular clusters (gcs) --the so-called "blue tilt" -- detected in the acs fornax cluster survey andusing the combined sample of gcs from the acs fornax and virgo cluster surveys.we find a tilt of gamma_z=d(g-z)/dz=-0.0257 +- 0.0050 for the full gc sample ofthe fornax cluster survey (~5800 gcs). this is slightly shallower than thevalue gamma_z=-0.0459 +- 0.0048 found for the virgo cluster survey gc sample(~11100 gcs). the slope for the merged fornax and virgo datasets (~16900 gcs)is gamma_z=-0.0293 +- 0.0085, corresponding to a mass-metallicity relation of z~ m^0.43. we find that the blue tilt sets in at gc masses in excess of m ~2*10^5 m_sun. the tilt is stronger for gcs belonging to high-mass galaxies (m_*&gt; 5 * 10^10 m_sun) than for those in low-mass galaxies (m_* &lt; 5 * 10^10 m_sun).it is also more pronounced for gcs with smaller galactocentric distances. ourfindings suggest a range of mass-metallicity relations z_gc ~ m_gc^(0.3-0.7)which vary as a function of host galaxy mass/luminosity. we compare ourobservations to a recent model of star cluster self-enrichment with generallyfavorable results. we suggest that, within the context of this model, theproto-cluster clouds out of which the gcs formed may have had density profilesslightly steeper than isothermal and/or star formation efficiencies somewhatbelow 0.3. we caution, however, that the significantly different appearance ofthe cmds defined by the gc systems associated with galaxies of similar mass andmorphological type pose a challenge to any single mechanism that seeks toexplain the blue tilt. we therefore suggest that the merger/accretion historiesof individual galaxies have played a non-negligible role determining thedistribution of gcs in the cmds of individual gc systems.

1001.2934	the atacama cosmology telescope: a measurement of the 600&lt; ell &lt;8000  cosmic microwave background power spectrum at 148 ghz	we present a measurement of the angular power spectrum of the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) radiation observed at 148 ghz. the measurement usesmaps with 1.4' angular resolution made with data from the atacama cosmologytelescope (act). the observations cover 228 square degrees of the southern sky,in a 4.2-degree-wide strip centered on declination 53 degrees south. the cmb atarcminute angular scales is particularly sensitive to the silk damping scale,to the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect from galaxy clusters, and to emission byradio sources and dusty galaxies. after masking the 108 brightest point sourcesin our maps, we estimate the power spectrum between 600 &lt; \ell &lt; 8000 using theadaptive multi-taper method to minimize spectral leakage and maximize use ofthe full data set. our absolute calibration is based on observations of uranus.to verify the calibration and test the fidelity of our map at large angularscales, we cross-correlate the act map to the wmap map and recover the wmappower spectrum from 250 &lt; ell &lt; 1150. the power beyond the silk damping tail ofthe cmb is consistent with models of the emission from point sources. wequantify the contribution of sz clusters to the power spectrum by fitting to amodel normalized at sigma8 = 0.8. we constrain the model's amplitude asz &lt; 1.63(95% cl). if interpreted as a measurement of sigma8, this implies sigma8^sz &lt;0.86 (95% cl) given our sz model. a fit of act and wmap five-year data jointlyto a 6-parameter lcdm model plus terms for point sources and the sz effect isconsistent with these results.

1005.3028	the vlt lbg redshift survey i: clustering and dynamics of ~1000 galaxies  at z~3	we present the initial imaging and spectroscopic data acquired as part of thevlt vimos lyman-break galaxy survey. ubr (or ubvi) imaging covers five 36'x36'fields centred on bright z&gt;3 qsos, allowing ~21,000 2&lt;z&lt;3.5 galaxy candidatesto be selected using the lyman-break technique. we performed spectroscopicfollow-up using vimos, measuring redshifts for 1020 z&gt;2 lbgs and 10 z&gt;2 qsosfrom a total of 19 vimos pointings. from the galaxy spectra, we observe a625+-510 km/s velocity offset between the ism absorption and ly-alpha emissionline redshifts. using the photometric and spectroscopic catalogues, we haveanalysed the galaxy clustering at z~3. in the photometric case, the angularcorrelation function, w(theta), is well fit by a double power-law withclustering scale-length, r_0 = 3.19+0.32-0.54 mpc/h for r &lt; 1 mpc/h and r_0 =4.59+0.31-0.33 mpc/h at larger scales. using the redshift sample we estimatethe semi-projected correlation function, w_p(sigma) and find r_0 =3.67+0.23-0.24 mpc/h for the vlt sample and r_0 = 3.98+0.14-0.15 mpc/h for acombined vlt+keck sample. from the z-space correlation functions and assumingthe above xi(r) models, we find that the combined vlt and keck surveys requirea galaxy velocity dispersion, &lt;w_z^2&gt;^1/2 ~ 700 km/s, higher than the ~400 km/sfound by previous authors. we also measure a value for the gravitational growthrate parameter of beta(z=3) = 0.48+-0.17, implying a low value for the bias ofb = 2.06+1.1-0.5. this value is consistent with the galaxy clustering amplitudewhich gives b = 2.22+-0.16, assuming the standard cosmology, implying that theevolution of the gravitational growth rate is also consistent with einsteingravity. we have compared our lbg clustering amplitudes with lower redshiftmeasurements and find that the clustering strength is not inconsistent withthat of low-redshift l* spirals for simple 'long-lived' galaxy models.

(2003, 2005). the lya-lbgcross-correlation can be described by a power-law on scales larger than 3 h^-1mpc. when galaxy velocity dispersions are taken into account our results atsmaller scales (&lt;2 h^-1 mpc) are also in good agreement with the results ofadelberger et al. (2005). there is little immediate indication of a region witha transmission spike above the mean igm value which might indicate the presenceof star-formation feedback. to measure the galaxy velocity dispersions, whichinclude both intrinsic lbg velocity dispersion and redshift errors, we haveused the lbg-lbg redshift space distortion measurements of bielby et al.(2010). we find that the redshift-space transmission spike implied in theresults of adelberger et al. (2003) is too narrow to be physical in thepresence of the likely lbg velocity dispersion and is likely to be astatistical fluke. nevertheless, neither our nor previous data can rule out thepresence of a narrow, real-space transmission spike, given the evidence of theincreased lya absorption surrounding lbgs which can mask the spike's presencewhen convolved with a realistic lbg velocity dispersion. finally, we identify176 civ systems in the quasar spectra and find an lbg-civ correlation strengthon scales of 10 h^-1 mpc consistent with the relation measured at ~mpc scales.

1204.3635	the vlt lbg redshift survey - iii. the clustering and dynamics of  lyman-break galaxies at z ~ 3	we present a catalogue of 2135 galaxy redshifts from the vlt lbg redshiftsurvey (vlrs), a spectroscopic survey of z ~ 3 galaxies in wide fields centredon background quasi-stellar objects. we have used deep optical imaging toselect galaxies via the lyman-break technique. spectroscopy of the lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs) was then made using the visible multi-object spectrograph(vimos), giving a mean redshift of z=2.79. we analyse the clustering propertiesof the vlrs sample and also of the vlrs sample combined with the smaller areakeck-based survey of steidel et al. from the semiprojected correlationfunction, wp({\sigma}) we find that the results are well fit with a singlepower-law model, with clustering scale lengths of r0=3.46+-0.41 and 3.83+-0.24mpc/h, respectively. we note that the corresponding combined {\xi}(r) slope isflatter than for local galaxies at {\gamma} = 1.5-1.6 rather than {\gamma}=1.8.this flat slope is confirmed by the z-space correlation function, {\xi}(s), andin the range 10&lt;s&lt;100 mpc/h the vlrs shows ~2.5{\sigma} excess over the{\lambda} cold dark matter. this excess may be consistent with recent evidencefor non-gaussianity in clustering results at z~1. we then analyse the lbgz-space distortions using the 2d correlation function, {\xi}({\sigma}, {\pi}),finding for the combined sample a large-scale infall parameter of $\beta$ =0.38+-0.19 and a velocity dispersion of 420km/s. based on our measured {\beta},we are able to determine the gravitational growth rate, finding a value of f(z= 3)=0.99+-0.50 (or f{\sigma}8 = 0.26+-0.13), which is the highest redshiftmeasurement of the growth rate via galaxy clustering and is consistent with{\lambda}cdm. finally, we constrain the mean halo mass for the lbg population,finding that the vlrs and combined sample suggest mean halo masses oflog(mdm/msun) = 11.57+-0.15 and 11.73+-0.07, respectively.

1211.2230	a census of star-forming galaxies in the z~9-10 universe based on  hst+spitzer observations over 19 clash clusters: three candidate z~9-10  galaxies and improved constraints on the star formation rate density at z~9	we utilise a two-color lyman-break selection criterion to search for z~9-10galaxies over the first 19 clusters in the clash program. a systematic searchyields three z~9-10 candidates. while we have already reported the most robustof these candidates, macs1149-jd, two additional z~9 candidates are also foundand have h_{160}-band magnitudes of ~26.2-26.9. a careful assessment of varioussources of contamination suggests &lt;~1 contaminants for our z~9-10 selection. todetermine the implications of these search results for the lf and sfr densityat z~9, we introduce a new differential approach to deriving these quantitiesin lensing fields. our procedure is to derive the evolution by comparing thenumber of z~9-10 galaxy candidates found in clash with the number of galaxiesin a slightly lower redshift sample (after correcting for the differences inselection volumes), here taken to be z~8. this procedure takes advantage of thefact that the relative volumes available for the z~8 and z~9-10 selectionsbehind lensing clusters are not greatly dependent on the details of the lensingmodels. we find that the normalization of the uv lf at z~9 is just0.28_{-0.20}^{+0.39}\times that at z~8, ~1.4_{-0.8}^{+3.0}x lower thanextrapolating z~4-8 lf results. while consistent with the evolution in the uvlf seen at z~4-8, these results marginally favor a more rapid evolution at z&gt;8.compared to similar evolutionary findings from the hudf, our result is lessinsensitive to large-scale structure uncertainties, given our many independentsightlines on the high-redshift universe.

1304.4598	the vlt lbg redshift survey - iv. gas and galaxies at z ~ 3 in  observations and simulations	we use observations and simulation to study the relationship betweenstar-forming galaxies and the intergalactic medium at z~3. the observed galaxysample is based on spectroscopic redshift data from a combination of the vltlbg redshift survey and keck observations in fields centred on bright z&gt;3 qsos,whilst the simulation data is taken from gimic. in the simulation, we find thatthe dominant peculiar velocities are in the form of large-scale coherentmotions of gas and galaxies. gravitational infall of galaxies towards oneanother is also seen. at smaller scales, the peculiar velocities in thesimulation over-predict the difference between the simulated real- and z-spacegalaxy correlation functions. peculiar velocity pairs separated by &lt;1mpc/h havea smaller dispersion and explain the z-space correlation function better. thely{\alpha} auto- and cross-correlation functions in the gimic simulation showinfall smaller than implied by previous work. this reduced infall may be due tothe galaxy wide outflows implemented in the simulation. the main challenge incomparing these simulated results with the observed correlation functions comesfrom the presence of velocity errors for the observed lbgs which dominate at~1mpc/h scales. when these are taken into account, the observed lbg correlationfunction is well matched by a simulated $m_*&gt;10^9m_\odot$ galaxy sample. thesimulated cross-correlation shows similar neutral gas densities around galaxiesas are seen in the observations. the simulated and observed ly{\alpha} z-spaceautocorrelation functions agree well with each other. our overall conclusion isthat gas and galaxy peculiar velocities are towards the low end of expectation.finally, little direct evidence is seen in either simulation or observationsfor high transmission near galaxies due to feedback.

1306.1121	lyman break and uv-selected galaxies at z ~ 1: ii. pacs-100um/160um fir  detections	we report the pacs-100um/160um detections of a sample of 42 galex-selectedand fir-detected lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 1 located in the cosmosfield and analyze their ultra-violet (uv) to far-infrared (fir) properties. thedetection of these lbgs in the fir indicates that they have a dust content highenough so that its emission can be directly detected. according to a spectralenergy distribution (sed) fitting with stellar population templates to theiruv-to-near-ir observed photometry, pacs-detected lbgs tend to be bigger, moremassive, dustier, redder in the uv continuum, and uv-brighter thanpacs-undetected lbgs. pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 are mostly disk-like galaxiesand are located over the green-valley and red sequence of the color-magnitudediagram of galaxies at their redshift. by using their uv and ir emission, wefind that pacs-detected lbgs tend to be less dusty and have slightly highertotal star-formation rates (sfrs) than other pacs-detected uv-selected galaxieswithin their same redshift range. as a consequence of the selection effect dueto the depth of the fir observations employed, all our pacs-detected lbgs arelirgs. however, none of them are in the ulirg regime, where the firobservations are complete. the finding of ulirgs-lbgs at higher redshiftssuggests an evolution of the fir emission of lbgs with cosmic time. in anirx-$\beta$ diagram, pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 tend to be located around therelation for local starburst similarly to other uv-selected pacs-detectedgalaxies at their same redshift. consequently, the dust-correction factorsobtained with their uv continuum slope allow to determine their total sfr,unlike at higher redshifts. however, the dust attenuation derived from uv tonir sed fitting overestimates the total sfr for most of our pacs-detected lbgsin age-dependent way: the overestimation factor is higher in younger galaxies.

1307.5117	the alhambra survey: discovery of a faint qso at z = 5.41	we aim to illustrate the potentiality of the advanced large, homogeneousarea, medium-band redshift astronomical (alhambra) survey to investigate thehigh redshift universe through the detection of quasi stellar objects (qsos) atredshifts larger than 5. the search for z&gt;5 qsos candidates was done by fittingan extensive library of spectral energy distributions --including active andnon-active galaxy templates as well as stars-- to the photometric database ofthe alhambra survey (composed of 20 optical medium-band plus the 3 broad-bandjhks filters). our selection over ~1 square degree of alhambra data (~1/4 ofthe total area covered by the survey), combined with gtc/osiris spectroscopy,has yielded the identification of an optically faint qso at very high redshift(z = 5.41). the qso has an absolute magnitude of ~-24 at the 1450{\aa}continuum, a bolometric luminosity of ~2x10^46 erg/s and an estimated blackhole mass of ~10^8 msolar. this qso adds itself to a reduced number of known uvfaint sources at these redshifts. the preliminary derived space density iscompatible with the most recent determinations of the high-z qso luminosityfunctions (qlf). this new detection shows how alhambra, as well as forthcomingwell designed photometric surveys, can provide a wealth of information on theorigin and early evolution of this kind of objects.

1307.5847	evidence for ubiquitous, high-ew nebular emission in z~7 galaxies:  towards a clean measurement of the specific star formation rate using a  sample of bright, magnified galaxies	growing observational evidence now indicates that nebular line emission has asignificant impact on the rest-frame optical fluxes of z~5-7 galaxies observedwith spitzer. this line emission makes z~5-7 galaxies appear more massive, withlower specific star formation rates. however, corrections for this lineemission have been very difficult to perform reliably due to huge uncertaintieson the overall strength of such emission at z&gt;~5.5. here, we present the mostdirect observational evidence yet for ubiquitous high-ew [oiii]+hbeta lineemission in lyman-break galaxies at z~7, while also presenting a strategy foran improved measurement of the ssfr at z~7. we accomplish this through theselection of bright galaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-7.0 where theirac 4.5 micron flux provides a clean measurement of the stellar continuumlight. observed 4.5 micron fluxes in this window contrast with the 3.6 micronfluxes which are contaminated by the prominent [oiii]+hbeta lines. to ensure ahigh s/n for our irac flux measurements, we consider only the brightest(h_{160}&lt;26 mag) magnified galaxies we have identified in clash and otherprograms targeting galaxy clusters. remarkably, the mean rest-frame opticalcolor for our bright seven-source sample is very blue, [3.6]-[4.5]=-0.9+/-0.3.such blue colors cannot be explained by the stellar continuum light and requirethat the rest-frame ew of [oiii]+hbeta be greater than 637 angstroms for theaverage source. the bluest four sources from our seven-source sample require aneven more extreme ew of 1582 angstroms. our derived lower limit for the mean[oiii]+hbeta ew could underestimate the true ew by ~2x based on a simplemodeling of the redshift distribution of our sources. we can also set a robustlower limit of &gt;~4 gyr^-1 on the specific star formation rates based on themean sed for our seven-source sample.

1401.4993	the alhambra survey: an empirical estimation of the cosmic variance for  merger fraction studies based on close pairs	our goal is to estimate empirically, for the first time, the cosmic variancethat affects merger fraction studies based on close pairs. we compute themerger fraction from photometric redshift close pairs with 10h^-1 kpc &lt;= rp &lt;=50h^-1 kpc and dv &lt;= 500 km/s, and measure it in the 48 sub-fields of thealhambra survey. we study the distribution of the measured merger fractions,that follow a log-normal function, and estimate the cosmic variance sigma_v asthe intrinsic dispersion of the observed distribution. we develop a maximumlikelihood estimator to measure a reliable sigma_v and avoid the dispersion dueto the observational errors (including the poisson shot noise term). the cosmicvariance of the merger fraction depends mainly on (i) the number density of thepopulations under study, both for the principal (n_1) and the companion (n_2)galaxy in the close pair, and (ii) the probed cosmic volume v_c. we find asignificant dependence on neither the search radius used to define closecompanions, the redshift, nor the physical selection (luminosity or stellarmass) of the samples. we provide a parametrisation of the cosmic variance withn_1, n_2, and v_c, sigma_v = 0.48 n_1^{-0.54} v_c^{-0.48} (n_2/n_1)^{-0.37}.thanks to this prescription, future merger fraction studies based on closepairs could account properly for the cosmic variance on their results.

1402.6743	young galaxy candidates in the hubble frontier fields. i. abell 2744	we report the discovery of 24 lyman-break candidates at 7&lt;z&lt;10.5, in thehubble frontier fields (hff) imaging data of abell 2744 (z=0.308), plusspiter/irac data and archival acs data. the sample includes a triple imagesystem with a photometric redshift of z~7.4. this high redshift isgeometrically confirmed by our lens model corresponding to deflection anglesthat are 12% larger than the lower-redshift systems used to calibrate the lensmodel at z=2.019. the majority of our high-redshift candidates are not expectedto be multiply lensed given their locations in the image plane and thebrightness of foreground galaxies, but are magnified by factors of ~1.3-15, sothat we are seeing further down the luminosity function than comparable deepfield imaging. it is apparent that the redshift distribution of these sourcesdoes not smoothly extend over the full redshift range accessible at z&lt;12, butappears to break above z=9. nine candidates are clustered within a small regionof 20" across, representing a potentially unprecedented concentration. giventhe poor statistics, however, we must await similar constraints from theadditional hff clusters to properly examine this trend. the physical propertiesof our candidates are examined using the range of lens models developed for thehff program by various groups including our own, for a better estimate ofunderlying systematics. our spectral-energy-distribution fits for the brightestobjects suggest stellar masses of ~1e9 solar mass, star-formation rates of ~4solar mass per yr, and a typical formation redshift of z&lt;19.

1404.1384	the music of clash: predictions on the concentration-mass relation	we present the results of a numerical study based on the analysis of themusic-2 simulations, aimed at estimating the expected concentration-massrelation for the clash cluster sample. we study nearly 1400 halos simulated athigh spatial and mass resolution, which were projected along manylines-of-sight each. we study the shape of both their density andsurface-density profiles and fit them with a variety of radial functions,including the navarro-frenk-white, the generalised navarro-frenk-white, and theeinasto density profiles. we derive concentrations and masses from these fitsand investigate their distributions as a function of redshift and halorelaxation. we use the x-ray image simulator x-mas to produce simulated chandraobservations of the halos and we use them to identify objects resembling thex-ray morphologies and masses of the clusters in the clash x-ray selectedsample. we also derive a concentration-mass relation for strong-lensingclusters. we find that the sample of simulated halos which resemble the x-raymorphology of the clash clusters is composed mainly by relaxed halos, but italso contains a significant fraction of un-relaxed systems. for such a samplewe measure an average 2d concentration which is ~11% higher than found for thefull sample of simulated halos. after accounting for projection and selectioneffects, the average nfw concentrations of clash clusters are expected to beintermediate between those predicted in 3d for relaxed and super-relaxed halos.matching the simulations to the individual clash clusters on the basis of thex-ray morphology, we expect that the nfw concentrations recovered from thelensing analysis of the clash clusters are in the range [3-6], with an averagevalue of 3.87 and a standard deviation of 0.61. simulated halos with x-raymorphologies similar to those of the clash clusters are affected by a modestorientation bias.

0803.1630	galaxy populations in the antlia cluster. i. photometric properties of  early-type galaxies	we present the first colour-magnitude relation (cmr) of early-type galaxiesin the central region of the antlia cluster, obtained from ccd wide-fieldphotometry in the washington photometric system. integrated (c -t1) colours, t1magnitudes, and effective radii have been measured for 93 galaxies (i.e. thelargest galaxies sample in the washington system till now) from the fs90catalogue (ferguson &amp; sandage 1990). membership of 37 objects can be confirmedthrough new radial velocities and data collected from the literature. theresulting colour-magnitude diagram shows that early-type fs90 galaxies that arespectroscopically confirmed antlia members or that were considered as definitemembers by fs90, follow a well defined cmr (sigma_(c -t1) ~ 0.07 mag) thatspans 9 magnitudes in brightness with no apparent change of slope. thisrelation is very tight for the whole magnitude range but s0 galaxies show alarger dispersion, apparently due to a separation of ellipticals and s0s.antlia displays a slope of -13.6 in a t1 vs. (c -t1) diagram, in agreement withresults for clusters like fornax, virgo, perseus and coma, which aredynamically different to antlia. this fact might indicate that the build up ofthe cmr in cluster of galaxies is more related to galaxies internal processesthan to the influence of the environment. interpreting the cmr as aluminosity-metallicity relation of old stellar systems, the metallicities ofthe antlia galaxies define a global relation down to mv ~ -13. we also find,for early-type dwarfs, no clear relation between luminosity and effectiveradius, indicating a nearly constant mean effective radius of ~ 1 kpc. thisvalue is also found in several samples of dwarf galaxies in virgo and coma.

1409.1142	the alhambra survey: accurate merger fractions by pdf analysis of  photometric close pairs	our goal is to develop and test a novel methodology to compute accurate closepair fractions with photometric redshifts. we improve the current methodologiesto estimate the merger fraction f_m from photometric redshifts by (i) using thefull probability distribution functions (pdfs) of the sources in redshiftspace, (ii) including the variation in the luminosity of the sources with z inboth the selection of the samples and in the luminosity ratio constrain, and(iii) splitting individual pdfs into red and blue spectral templates to dealrobustly with colour selections. we test the performance of our new methodologywith the pdfs provided by the alhambra photometric survey. the merger fractionsand rates from the alhambra survey are in excellent agreement with those fromspectroscopic work, both for the general population and for red and bluegalaxies. with the merger rate of bright (m_b &lt;= -20 - 1.1z) galaxies evolvingas (1+z)^n, the power-law index n is larger for blue galaxies (n = 2.7 +- 0.5)than for red galaxies (n = 1.3 +- 0.4), confirming previous results.integrating the merger rate over cosmic time, we find that the average numberof mergers per galaxy since z = 1 is n_m = 0.57 +- 0.05 for red galaxies andn_m = 0.26 +- 0.02 for blue galaxies. our new methodology exploitsstatistically all the available information provided by photometric redshiftcodes and provides accurate measurements of the merger fraction by close pairsonly using photometric redshifts. current and future photometric surveys willbenefit of this new methodology.

1412.1089	frontier fields : combining hst, vlt and spitzer data to explore the  $z$$\sim$8 universe behind the lensing cluster macs0416$-$2403	(abridged) the hst frontier fields project started at the end of 2013 withthe aim of providing extremely deep images of 6 massive galaxy clusters. one ofthe main goals of this program is to push several telescopes to their limits inorder to provide the best current view of the earliest stages of the universe.we present a detailed analysis of $z$$\sim$8 objects behind the hffs lensingcluster, macs0416-2403, combining 0.3-1.6 $\mu$m imaging from hst, ground-based$k_s$ imaging from vlt hawk-i, and 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m spitzer spacetelescope. we apply the classical lyman break technique, combiningnon-detection criteria and color-selection. in order to avoid contamination bymid-$z$ interlopers, we require a strong break between optical and nearinfrared data. the luminosity function at $z$$\sim$8 is computed using a mcmethod taking advantage of the sed-fitting results. a piece of cautionaryinformation is gleaned from new deep optical photometry of a previouslyidentified $z$$\sim$8 galaxy in this cluster, which is now firmly detected as amid-$z$ interloper with a strong $\approx1.5$ mag balmer break (between f606wand f125w). using the sed of this interloper, we estimate the contaminationrate of our macs0416$-$2403 sample, as well as for previous samples in abell2744 based on hff data. our selection recovers 4 robust objects withm$_{f160w}$ ranging from 26.0 to 27.9 ab and located in modest amplificationregions ($\mu&lt;$2.4). two of the objects display a secondary break between theirac 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m bands which could be associated to the balmerbreak or emission lines at $z$$\sim$8. the candidates generally have starformation rates around $\sim$10 m$_{\odot}$/yr and sizes ranging from 0.2 to0.5 kpc, in good agreement with previous observations and expectations forobjects in the early universe.

1501.05109	high redshift galaxies in the alhambra survey: i. selection method and  number counts based on redshift pdfs	context. most observational results on the high redshift restframe uv-brightgalaxies are based on samples pinpointed using the so called dropout techniqueor ly-alpha selection. however, the availability of multifilter data allows nowreplacing the dropout selections by direct methods based on photometricredshifts. in this paper we present the methodology to select and study thepopulation of high redshift galaxies in the alhambra survey data. aims. our aimis to develop a less biased methodology than the traditional dropout techniqueto study the high redshift galaxies in alhambra and other multifilter data.thanks to the wide area alhambra covers, we especially aim at contributing inthe study of the brightest, less frequent, high redshift galaxies. methods. themethodology is based on redshift probability distribution functions (zpdfs). itis shown how a clean galaxy sample can be obtained by selecting the galaxieswith high integrated probability of being within a given redshift interval.however, reaching both a complete and clean sample with this method ischallenging. hence, a method to derive statistical properties by summing thezpdfs of all the galaxies in the redshift bin of interest is introduced.results. using this methodology we derive the galaxy rest frame uv numbercounts in five redshift bins centred at z=2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, and 4.5, beingcomplete up to the limiting magnitude at m_uv(ab)=24. with the wide fieldalhambra data we especially contribute in the study of the brightest ends ofthese counts, sampling well the surface densities down to m_uv(ab)=21-22.conclusions. we show that using the zpdfs it is easy to select a clean sampleof high redshift galaxies. we also show that statistical analysis of theproperties of galaxies is better done using a probabilistic approach, whichtakes into account both the incompleteness and contamination in a natural way.

1505.07555	stellar populations of galaxies in the alhambra survey up to $z \sim 1$.  i. muffit: a multi-filter fitting code for stellar population diagnostics	we present muffit, a new generic code optimized to retrieve the main stellarpopulation parameters of galaxies in photometric multi-filter surveys, and wecheck its reliability and feasibility with real galaxy data from the alhambrasurvey. making use of an error-weighted $\chi^2$-test, we compare themulti-filter fluxes of galaxies with the synthetic photometry of mixtures oftwo single stellar populations at different redshifts and extinctions, toprovide through a monte carlo method the most likely range of stellarpopulation parameters (mainly ages and metallicities), extinctions, redshifts,and stellar masses. to improve the diagnostic reliability, muffit identifiesand removes from the analysis those bands that are significantly affected byemission lines. we highlight that the retrieved age-metallicity locus for asample of $z \le 0.22$ early-type galaxies in alhambra at different stellarmass bins are in very good agreement with the ones from sdss spectroscopicdiagnostics. moreover, a one-to-one comparison between the redshifts, ages,metallicities, and stellar masses derived spectroscopically for sdss and bymuffit for alhambra reveals good qualitative agreements in all the parameters.in addition, and using as input the results from photometric-redshift codes,muffit improves the photometric-redshift accuracy by $\sim 10$-$20\%$, and italso detects nebular emissions in galaxies, providing physical informationabout their strengths. our results show the potential of multi-filter galaxydata to conduct reliable stellar population studies with the appropiateanalysis techniques, as muffit.

1507.05846	the impact from survey depth and resolution on the morphological  classification of galaxies	we consistently analyse for the first time the impact of survey depth andspatial resolution on the most used morphological parameters for classifyinggalaxies through non-parametric methods: abraham and conselice-bershadyconcentration indices, gini, m20 moment of light, asymmetry, and smoothness.three different non-local datasets are used, alhambra and sxds (examples ofdeep ground-based surveys), and cosmos (deep space-based survey). we used asample of 3000 local, visually classified galaxies, measuring theirmorphological parameters at their real redshifts (z ~ 0). then we simulatedthem to match the redshift and magnitude distributions of galaxies in thenon-local surveys. the comparisons of the two sets allow to put constraints onthe use of each parameter for morphological classification and evaluate theeffectiveness of the commonly used morphological diagnostic diagrams. allanalysed parameters suffer from biases related to spatial resolution and depth,the impact of the former being much stronger. when including asymmetry andsmoothness in classification diagrams, the noise effects must be taken intoaccount carefully, especially for ground-based surveys. m20 is significantlyaffected, changing both the shape and range of its distribution at allbrightness levels.we suggest that diagnostic diagrams based on 2 - 3 parametersshould be avoided when classifying galaxies in ground-based surveys,independently of their brightness; for cosmos they should be avoided forgalaxies fainter than f814 = 23.0. these results can be applied directly tosurveys similar to alhambra, sxds and cosmos, and also can serve as anupper/lower limit for shallower/deeper ones.

1508.02861	the alhambra survey : estimation of the clustering signal encoded in the  cosmic variance	the relative cosmic variance ($\sigma_v$) is a fundamental source ofuncertainty in pencil-beam surveys and, as a particular case of count-in-cellstatistics, can be used to estimate the bias between galaxies and theirunderlying dark-matter distribution. our goal is to test the significance ofthe clustering information encoded in the $\sigma_v$ measured in the alhambrasurvey. we measure the cosmic variance of several galaxy populations selectedwith $b-$band luminosity at $0.35 \leq z &lt; 1.05$ as the intrinsic dispersion inthe number density distribution derived from the 48 alhambra subfields. wecompare the observational $\sigma_v$ with the cosmic variance of the darkmatter expected from the theory, $\sigma_{v,{\rm dm}}$. this provides anestimation of the galaxy bias $b$. the galaxy bias from the cosmic variance isin excellent agreement with the bias estimated by two-point correlationfunction analysis in alhambra. this holds for different redshift bins, for redand blue subsamples, and for several $b-$band luminosity selections. we findthat $b$ increases with the $b-$band luminosity and the redshift, as expectedfrom previous work. moreover, red galaxies have a larger bias than bluegalaxies, with a relative bias of $b_{\rm rel} = 1.4 \pm 0.2$. our resultsdemonstrate that the cosmic variance measured in alhambra is due to theclustering of galaxies and can be used to characterise the $\sigma_v$ affectingpencil-beam surveys. in addition, it can also be used to estimate the galaxybias $b$ from a method independent of correlation functions.

astro-ph;0011218	luminous compact galaxies at intermediate redshifts: progenitors of  bulges of massive spirals ?	vlt spectra of 14 luminous compact galaxies (lcgs) reveal strong metallicabsorption line sytems as well as narrow and intense emission lines. their gasextinction is found to be large (av ~ 1.5 mag) leading to an upward revision oftheir star formation rate (sfr) to an average value of ~ 40 mo/yr. largeextinction values are also supported by the large rate of detection in onefield observed by iso. gas metal abundances in lcgs have about half the solarvalue. we argue that lcgs are the progenitors of present-day spiral bulges.lcgs have masses and light concentrations similar to those of present-daybulges. as in present-day galactic bulges, lcg stars show a wide range ofabundances. thus, observing lcgs allows us to directly witness an importantstage in the formation of a massive galaxy, the building of the bulge prior tothat of the disk. the gas needed to feed the observed star formation is likelyto be falling in from the outskirts of the galaxy, being tidally pulled outfrom interacting companion galaxies. some lcgs also show evidence for thebeginning of a disk formation. if the above scenario holds for most lcgs, weestimate that at least 20% of present-day spiral galaxies have formed the bulkof their stars at relatively recent epochs, during the last 8-9 gyr, atredshifts less than ~ 1. since they are heavily extincted, we predict their irluminosities to be relatively large, around lir = 10^11 lsun, i.e. near orslightly below the luminosities of the galaxies detected by iso in the sameredshift range. taking into account the integrated ir luminosity of the lcggalaxy population can lead to a significant upward revision of the cosmic sfrdensity in the redshift range from 0.5 to 1.

astro-ph;0306215	star formation at z~6: i-dropouts in the acs gto fields	using an i-z dropout criterion, we determine the space density of z~6galaxies from two deep acs gto fields with deep optical-ir imaging. a total of23 objects are found over 46 arcmin^2, or ~0.5 objects/arcmin^2 down to z~27.3(6 sigma; all ab mag) (including one probable z~6 agn). combining deep isaacdata for our rdcs1252-2927 field (j~25.7 and ks~25.0 (5 sigma)) and nicmos datafor the hdf north (jh~27.3 (5 sigma)), we verify that these dropouts have flatspectral slopes. i-dropouts in our sample range in luminosity from ~1.5 l*(z~25.6) to ~0.3 l* (z~27.3) with the exception of one very bright candidate atz~24.2. the half-light radii vary from 0.09" to 0.29", or 0.5 kpc to 1.7 kpc.we derive the z~6 rest-frame uv luminosity density using three differentprocedures, each utilizing simulations based on a cdf south v dropout sample.first, we compare our findings with a no-evolution projection of this v-dropoutsample. we find 23+/-25% more i-dropouts than we predict. adopting previousresults to z~5, this works out to a 20+/-29% drop in the luminosity densityfrom z~3 to z~6. second, we use these same v-dropout simulations to derive aselection function for our i-dropout sample and compute the uv-luminositydensity (7.2+/-2.5 x 10^25 ergs/s/hz/mpc^3 down to z~27). we find a 39+/-21%drop over the same redshift range. this is our preferred value and suggests astar formation rate of 0.0090+/-0.0031 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 to z~27, or ~0.036+/-0.012 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 extrapolating the lf to the faint limit. third, we followa very similar procedure, but assume no incompleteness, finding a luminositydensity which is ~2-3x lower. this final estimate constitutes a lower limit.all three estimates are within the canonical range of luminosity densitiesnecessary for reionization of the universe at this epoch.

astro-ph;0309036	advanced camera for surveys photometry of the cluster rdcs1252.9-2927:  the color-magnitude relation at z=1.24	we investigate the color-magnitude (cm) relation of galaxies in the distantx-ray selected cluster rdcs1252.9-2927 at z=1.24 using images obtained with theadvanced camera for surveys (acs) on the hubble space telescope in the f775wand f850lp bandpasses. we select galaxies based on morphologicalclassifications extending about 3.5 mag down the galaxy luminosity function,augmented by spectroscopic membership information. at the core of the clusteris an extensive early-type galaxy population surrounding a central pair ofgalaxies that show signs of dynamical interaction. the early-type populationdefines a tight sequence in the cm diagram, with an intrinsic scatter inobserved (i-z) of $0.029\pm0.007$ mag based on 52 galaxies, or $0.024\pm0.008$mag for $\sim30$ ellipticals. simulations using the latest stellar populationmodels indicate an age scatter for the ellipticals of about 34%, with a meanage $\taul\gta2.6$ gyr (corresponding to $z_l\gta2.7$), and the last starformation occurring at $z_{end}\gta1.5$. transforming to rest-frame $(u-b)$, weconclude that the slope and scatter in the cm relation for morphologicallyselected early-type galaxies show little or no evidence for evolution out to$z\approx1.2$. thus, elliptical galaxies were already well established in x-rayluminous clusters when the universe was a third of its present age.

astro-ph;0311323	discovery of globular clusters in the proto-spiral ngc2915: implications  for hierarchical galaxy evolution	we have discovered three globular clusters beyond the holmberg radius inhubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys images of the gas-rich darkmatter dominated blue compact dwarf galaxy ngc2915. the clusters, all of whichstart to resolve into stars, have m_{v606} = -8.9 to -9.8 mag, significantlybrighter than the peak of the luminosity function of milky way globularclusters. their colors suggest a metallicity [fe/h] ~ -1.9 dex, typical ofmetal-poor galactic globular clusters. the specific frequency of clusters is ata minimum normal, compared to spiral galaxies. however, since only a smallportion of the system has been surveyed it is more likely that the luminosityand mass normalized cluster content is higher, like that seen in ellipticalgalaxies and galaxy clusters. this suggests that ngc2915 resembles a key phasein the early hierarchical assembly of galaxies - the epoch when much of the oldstellar population has formed, but little of the stellar disk. depending on thesubsequent interaction history, such systems could go on to build-up largerelliptical galaxies, evolve into normal spirals, or in rare circumstancesremain suspended in their development to become systems like ngc2915.

astro-ph;0312553	a catalog of compact groups of galaxies in the sdss commissioning data	compact groups (cgs) of galaxies -- relatively poor groups of galaxies inwhich the typical separations between members is of the order of a galaxydiameter -- offer an exceptional laboratory for the study of dense galaxianenvironments with short (&lt;1gyr) dynamical time-scales. in this paper, wepresent an objectively defined catalog of cgs in 153 sq deg of the sloandigital sky survey early data release (sdss edr). to identify cgs, we applied amodified version of hickson's (1982) criteria aimed at finding the highestdensity cgs and thus reducing the number of chance alignments. our catalogcontains 175 cgs down to a limiting galaxy magnitude of r* = 21. the resultingcatalog has a median depth of approximately z = 0.13, substantially deeper thanprevious cg catalogs. since the sdss will eventually image up to one quarter ofthe celestial sphere, we expect our final catalog, based upon the completedsdss, will contain on the order of 5,000 - 10,000 cgs. this catalog will beuseful for conducting studies of the general characteristics of cgs, theirenvironments, and their component galaxies.

astro-ph;0401175	the globular cluster system of ngc 1399. ii. kinematics of a large  sample of globular clusters	we study the kinematics and dynamics of the globular cluster system of ngc1399, the central galaxy of the fornax cluster. the observational data consistsof medium resolution spectra, obtained at the very large telescope. our samplecomprises 468 radial velocities in the magnitude range 20 &lt; m_r &lt; 23. this isthe largest sample of globular cluster velocities around any galaxy obtained sofar. the radial range is 2 arcmin &lt; r &lt; 9 arcmin, corresponding to 11 kpc to 50kpc of galactocentric distance. there is the possibility that unbound clustersand/or objects in the foreground contaminate the ngc 1399 cluster sample. understrong error selection, practically no objects are found with velocities lowerthan 800 km/s or higher than 2000 km/s. since the extreme velocities influencethe velocity dispersion considerably, uncertainty regarding the exact value ofthe dispersion remains. within the above velocity limits, we derive a projectedvelocity dispersion for the total sample of 274+-9 km/s which within theuncertainties remains constant over the entire radial range. without anyvelocity restriction, it increases to 325 km/s. blue and red clusters showdifferent dispersions corresponding to their different surface densityprofiles. spherical models point to a circular velocity of 415+-30$ km/s,assuming isotropy for the red clusters. this value is constant out to 40 kpc.the inferred dark halo potential can be well represented by a logarithmicpotential. also a halo of the nfw type fits well to the observations. some massprofiles derived from x-ray analyses do not agree with a constant circularvelocity within our radial range, irrespective of its exact value.

astro-ph;0401610	fornax compact object survey fcos: on the nature of ultra compact dwarf  galaxies	the results of the fornax compact object survey (fcos) are presented. thefcos aims at investigating the nature of the ultra compact dwarf galaxies(ucds) recently discovered in the center of the fornax cluster (drinkwater etal. 2000). 280 unresolved objects in the magnitude space covering ucds andbright globular clusters (18&lt;v&lt;21 mag) were observed spectroscopically. 54 newfornax members were discovered, plus five of the seven already known ucds.their distribution in radial velocity, colour, magnitude and space wasinvestigated. it is found that bright compact objects (v&lt;20 or m_v&lt;-11.4 mag),including the ucds, have a higher mean velocity than faint compact objects(v&gt;20 mag) at 96% confidence. the mean velocity of the bright compact objectsis consistent with that of the dwarf galaxy population in fornax, butinconsistent with that of ngc 1399's globular cluster system at 93.5%confidence. the compact objects follow a colour magnitude relation with a slopevery similar to that of normal des, but shifted about 0.2 mag redwards. themagnitude distribution of compact objects shows a fluent transition betweenucds and gcs with an overpopulation of 8 +/- 4 objects for v&lt;20 mag withrespect to the extrapolation of ngc 1399's gc luminosity function. the spatialdistribution of bright compact objects is in comparison to the faint ones moreextended at 88% confidence. all our findings are consistent with the threshingscenario (bekki et al. 2003), suggesting that a substantial fraction of compactfornax members brighter than v~20 mag could be created by threshing de,ns.fainter than v~20 mag, the majority of the objects seem to be genuine gcs. ourresults are also consistent with merged stellar super-clusters (fellhauer &amp;kroupa 2002) as an alternative explanation for the bright compact objects.

astro-ph;0406613	ultra compact dwarf galaxies in abell 1689: a photometric study with the  acs	the properties of ultra compact dwarf (ucd) galaxy candidates in abell 1689(z=0.183) are investigated, based on deep high resolution acs images. a ucdcandidate has to be unresolved, have i&lt;28 (m_v&lt;-11.5) mag and satisfy colorlimits derived from bayesian photometric redshifts. we find 160 ucd candidateswith 22&lt;i&lt;28 mag. it is estimated that about 100 of these are cluster members,based on their spatial distribution and photometric redshifts. for i&gt;26.8 mag,the radial and luminosity distribution of the ucd candidates can be explainedwell by abell 1689's globular cluster (gc) system. for i&lt;26.8 mag, there is anoverpopulation of 15 +/- 5 ucd candidates with respect to the gc luminosityfunction. for i&lt;26 mag, the radial distribution of ucd candidates is moreconsistent with the dwarf galaxy population than with the gc system of abell1689. the ucd candidates follow a color-magnitude trend with a slope similar tothat of abell 1689's genuine dwarf galaxy population, but shifted fainter byabout 2-3 mag. two of the three brightest ucd candidates (m_v ~ -17 mag) areslightly resolved. at the distance of abell 1689, these two objects would haveking-profile core radii of ~35 pc and r_eff ~300 pc, implying luminosities andsizes 2-3 times those of m32's bulge. additional photometric redshifts obtainedwith late type stellar and elliptical galaxy templates support the assignmentof these two resolved sources to abell 1689. our findings imply that in abell1689 there are at least 10 ucds with m_v&lt;-12.7 mag. compared to the ucds in thefornax cluster they are brighter, larger and have colors closer to normal dwarfgalaxies. this suggests that they may be in an intermediate stage of thestripping process. spectroscopy is needed to definitely confirm the existenceof ucds in abell 1689.

astro-ph;0407644	the luminosity function of early-type galaxies at z~0.75	we measure the luminosity function of morphologically selected e/s0 galaxiesfrom $z=0.5$ to $z=1.0$ using deep high resolution advanced camera for surveysimaging data. our analysis covers an area of $48\box\arcmin$ (8$\times$ thearea of the hdf-n) and extends 2 magnitudes deeper ($i\sim24$ mag) than waspossible in the deep groth strip survey (dgss). at $0.5&lt;z&lt;0.75$, we find$m_b^*-5\log h_{0.7}=-21.1\pm0.3$ and $\alpha=-0.53\pm0.2$, and at$0.75&lt;z&lt;1.0$, we find $m_b^*-5\log h_{0.7}=-21.4\pm0.2$. these luminosityfunctions are similar in both shape and number density to the luminosityfunction using morphological selection (e.g., dgss), but are much steeper thanthe luminosity functions of samples selected using morphological proxies likethe color or spectral energy distribution (e.g., cfrs, cadis, or combo-17). thedifference is due to the `blue', $(u-v)_0&lt;1.7$, e/s0 galaxies, which make up to$\sim30%$ of the sample at all magnitudes and an increasing proportion of faintgalaxies. we thereby demonstrate the need for {\it both morphological andstructural information} to constrain the evolution of galaxies.  we find that the `blue' e/s0 galaxies have the same average sizes and sersicparameters as the `red', $(u-v)_0&gt;1.7$, e/s0 galaxies at brighter luminosities($m_b&lt;-20.1$), but are increasingly different at fainter magnitudes where`blue' galaxies are both smaller and have lower sersic parameters. fits of thecolors to stellar population models suggest that most e/s0 galaxies have shortstar-formation time scales ($\tau&lt;1$ gyr), and that galaxies have formed at anincreasing rate from $z\sim8$ until $z\sim2$ after which there has been agradual decline.

(2000) at a distance of ~45 mpc can explain the observed peculiarvelocities if shifted about 15 degrees towards the hydra cluster position. ourresults are inconsistent at 94% confidence with a scenario where the centauruscluster is identical to the great attractor. in order to better restrictpartially degenerate great attractor parameters like its mass and distance, arecalculation of the local flow model with updated distance information over alarger area than covered by us would be needed.

astro-ph;0512474	spectroscopic metallicities for fornax ucds, gcs and de,ns	various formation channels for the puzzling ultra-compact dwarf galaxies(ucds) have been proposed in the last few years. to better judge on some of thecompeting scenarios, we present spectroscopic [fe/h] estimates for a sample of26 compact objects in the central region of the fornax cluster, covering themagnitude range of ucds and bright globular clusters. we find a break in themetallicity distribution of compact objects at m_v ~ -11 mag (~3*10^6 m_sun):for m_v&lt;-11 mag the mean metallicity is [fe/h]=-0.62 +/- 0.05 dex, 0.56 +/-0.15 dex higher than for m_v&gt;-11 mag. this metallicity break is accompanied bya change in the size-luminosity relation for compact objects, as deduced fromhst-imaging: for m_v&lt;-11 mag, r_h scales with luminosity, while for m_v&gt;-11mag, r_h is almost luminosity-independent. we therefore assume a limitingabsolute magnitude of m_v=-11 mag between ucds and globular clusters. the meanmetallicity of five fornax de,n nuclei included in our study is about 0.8 dexlower than that of the ucds, at 4.5 sigma significance. because of this largemetallicity discrepancy we disfavor the hypothesis that most of the fornax ucdsare the remnant nuclei of tidally stripped de,ns. our metallicity estimates forucds are closer to but slightly below those derived for young massive clusters(ymcs) of comparable masses. we therefore favor a scenario where most ucds infornax are successors of merged ymcs produced in the course of violentgalaxy-galaxy mergers. it is noted that in contrast to that, the properties ofvirgo ucds are more consistent with the stripping scenario, suggesting thatdifferent ucd formation channels may dominate in either cluster.

astro-ph;0601085	photometric observations of southern abell cluster redshifts survey  clusters: structure of galaxies in the inner region of clusters of galaxies	we analyze photometric properties of 1384 cluster galaxies as a function ofthe normalized distance to cluster center. these galaxies were selected in thecentral region ($r/r_{200} \leq$ 0.8) of 14 southern abell clusters chosen fromthe southern abell cluster redshifts survey (sars). for 507 of these galaxieswe also obtained their luminosity profiles. we have studied themorphology-clustercentric distance relation on the basis of the shape parameter$n$ of the s\'ersic's law. we also have analyzed the presence of a possiblesegregation in magnitude for both, the galaxy total luminosity and that oftheir components (i.e. the bulge and the disk).  results show a marginal ($2\sigma$ level) decrease of the total luminosity asa function of normalized radius. however, when bulges are analyzed separately,a significant luminosity segregation is found ($3\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ forgalaxies in projection and member galaxies respectively). the fraction ofbulges brighter than $m_b \leq -22$ is three times larger in the core ofclusters than in the outer region. our analysis of the disk component suggeststhat disks are, on average, less luminous in the cluster core than at$r/r_{200} \sim 0.8$. in addition, we found that the magnitude-size relation asa function of $r/r_{200}$ indicates (at $2\sigma$ level) that disks are smallerand centrally brighter in the core of clusters. however, the kormendy relation(the bulge magnitude-size relation) appears to be independent of environment.

astro-ph;0602292	hst/acs multiband coronagraphic imaging of the debris disk around beta  pictoris	(abridged.) we present f435w (b), f606w (broad v), and f814w (broad i)coronagraphic images of the debris disk around beta pictoris obtained withhst's advanced camera for surveys. we confirm that the previously reported warpin the inner disk is a distinct secondary disk inclined by ~5 deg from the maindisk. the main disk's northeast extension is linear from 80 to 250 au, but thesouthwest extension is distinctly bowed with an amplitude of ~1 au over thesame region. both extensions of the secondary disk appear linear, but notcollinear, from 80 to 150 au. within ~120 au of the star, the main disk is ~50%thinner than previously reported. the surface-brightness profiles along thespine of the main disk are fitted with four distinct radial power laws between40 and 250 au, while those of the secondary disk between 80 and 150 au arefitted with single power laws. these discrepancies suggest that the two diskshave different grain compositions or size distributions. the f606w/f435w andf814w/f435w flux ratios of the composite disk are nonuniform and asymmetricabout both projected axes of the disk. within ~120 au, the m_f435w-m_f606w andm_f435w-m_f814w colors along the spine of the main disk are ~10% and ~20%redder, respectively, than those of beta pic. these colors increasingly reddenbeyond ~120 au, becoming 25% and 40% redder, respectively, than the star at 250au. we compare the observed red colors within ~120 au with the simulated colorsof non-icy grains having a radial number density ~r^-3 and differentcompositions, porosities, and minimum grain sizes. the observed colors areconsistent with those of compact or moderately porous grains of astronomicalsilicate and/or graphite with sizes &gt;0.15-0.20 um, but the colors areinconsistent with the blue colors expected from grains with porosities &gt;90%.

astro-ph;0605660	an i-band calibration of the sbf method at blue colours	the surface brightness fluctuation (sbf) method is a powerful tool to derivedistances to galaxies for which single stars cannot be resolved. up to now, themethod has been calibrated mainly at red colours due to the intrinsic faintnessof blue early-type galaxies. in this paper we address the i-band calibration ofthe sbf method at blue colours, the regime of dwarf elliptical galaxies (des).we present deep and wide-field vi photometry of the central fornax clusterobtained at las campanas observatory. with these data we perform an sbfanalysis of 25 des in the range -16.5&lt;m_v&lt;-11.2 mag, 0.8&lt;(v-i)_0&lt;1.10 mag. forthe calibration analysis we exclude eight des whose sbf measurement wasaffected by poor seeing (fwhm ~ 1"). our sbf data are inconsistent at the 3sigma level with a colour independent absolute sbf magnitude mbar_i, presentinga problem for sbf models that predict such a flat relation. there is a weakindication in our data (1.8 sigma) to favour a two-branch calibration over aone-branch calibration with broad scatter in the mbar_i - (v-i) plane. weobtain the following one-branch empirical sbf calibration:  mbar_i=-2.13 (+/- 0.17) + 2.44 (+/- 1.94) * [(v-i)_0 - 1.00] mag.  we deduce a 0.34 +/- 0.14 mag cosmic scatter of mbar_i, which issignificantly larger than found at redder colours. this is in agreement withthose theoretical sbf models that predict mbar_i to be more sensitive toage-metallicity variations in the blue than in the red. we find evidence thatthe fainter galaxies in our samples contain younger and more metal-rich stellarpopulations than the brighter ones. the application of our empiricalcalibration to published sbf measurements of hydra and centaurus cluster desleaves the distances to both clusters unchanged.

(2) of 51 further candidate des in the range -13.2&lt;m_v&lt;-8.6 mag, 2/3are confirmed as probable cluster members by morphological re-assessment, while1/3 are re-classified as probable background objects. (3) we find 12 new decandidates in the range -12.3&lt;m_v&lt;-8.8 mag.  the surface brightness-magnitude relation defined by the resulting fiducialde sample shows that fornax des are about 40% larger than local group des. thefornax de sample furthermore defines a colour-magnitude relation that appearsslightly shallower than that of local group des. the early-type dwarf galaxyluminosity function in fornax has a faint end slope alpha = -1.1 +/- 0.1.  we discuss these findings in the context of structure formation theories.(abridged)

astro-ph;0612484	dynamical masses of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies in fornax	aims. we determine masses and mass-to-light ratios of five ultra-compactdwarf galaxies and one dwarf elliptical nucleus in the fornax cluster from highresolution spectroscopy. methods. velocity dispersions were derived fromselected wavelength regions using a direct-fitting method. to estimate themasses of the ucds a new modelling program has been developed that allows achoice of different representations of the surface brightness profile (i.e.nuker, sersic or king laws) and corrects the observed velocity dispersions forobservational parameters (i.e. seeing, slit size). results. the observedvelocity dispersions range between 22 and 30 km/s. the resulting masses arebetween 1.8 and 9.5x10^7m_sun. these, as well as the central and globalprojected velocity dispersions, were derived from the generalized king modelwhich turned out to give the most stable results. the masses of two ucds, thatare best fitted by a two-component profile, were derived from a combinedking+sersic model. the mass-to-light ratios of the fornax ucds range between 3and 5 (m/l_v)_sun. within 1-2 half-mass radii dark matter is not dominatingucds. conclusions. we show that the mass-to-light ratios of ucds in fornax areconsistent with those expected for pure stellar populations. thus ucds seem tobe the result of cluster formation processes within galaxies rather than beingcompact dark matter dominated substructures themselves. whether ucds gainedtheir mass in super-star cluster complexes of mergers or in nuclear starcluster formation processes remains an open question. it appears, however,clear that star clusters more massive than about 5\times10^6m_sun exhibit amore complex formation history than the less massive `ordinary' globularclusters.

astro-ph;9408071	the clustering properties of faint galaxies	the two-point angular correlation function of galaxies, \wte, has beencomputed from a new survey of faint galaxies covering a 2 deg$^2$ area near thenorth galactic pole. this survey, which is complete to limiting magnitudes\jmag=24 and \fmag=23, samples angular scales as large as $1\degpoint5$. faintgalaxies are found to be more weakly clustered (by a factor of at least two)compared to galaxies observed locally. clustering amplitudes are closer tomodel predictions in the red than in the blue. the weak clustering of faintgalaxies cannot be explained by any plausible model of clustering evolutionwith redshift. however, one possible explanation of the clustering propertiesof intermediate redshift galaxies is that they resemble those of starburstgalaxies and h ii region galaxies, which are observed locally to possess weakclustering amplitudes. our clustering amplitudes are also similar to those ofnearby late-type galaxies, which are observed to be more weakly clustered thanearly-type galaxies a simple, self-consistent model is presented that predictsthe fraction of galaxies in the ``excess'' population at intermediateredshifts, and correctly matches observed color distributions. the availabledata on the clustering properties of faint galaxies are consistent with thismodel if the ``excess'' population of faint blue galaxies is also the weaklyclustered population. evidence is presented that the power-law slope of theangular correlation function becomes shallower at fainter magnitudes. a similareffect is seen locally both for dwarf galaxies and for galaxies with latemorphological type;
