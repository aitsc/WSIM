0903.3046	a co emission line from the optical and near-ir undetected submillimeter  galaxy gn10	we report the detection of a co emission line from the submillimiter galaxy(smg) gn10 in the goods-n field. gn10 lacks any counterpart in extremely deepoptical and near-ir imaging obtained with the hubble space telescope andground-based facilities. this is a prototypical case of a source that isextremely obscured by dust, for which it is practically impossible to derive aspectroscopic redshift in the optical/near-ir. under the hypothesis that gn10is part of a proto-cluster structure previously identified at z~4.05 in thesame field, we searched for co[4-3] at 91.4 ghz with the iram plateau de bureinterferometer, and successfully detected a line. we find that the most likelyredshift identification is z=4.0424+-0.0013, based on: 1) the very low chancethat the co line is actually serendipitous from a different redshift; 2) aradio-ir photometric redshift analysis; 3) the identical radio-ir sed, within ascaling factor, of two other smgs at the same redshift. the faintness atoptical/near-ir wavelengths requires an attenuation of a_v~5-7.5 mag. thisresult supports the case that a substantial population of very high-z smgsexists that had been missed by previous spectroscopic surveys. this is thefirst time that a co emission line has been detected for a galaxy that isinvisible in the optical and near-ir. our work demonstrates the power ofexisting and planned facilities for completing the census of star formation andstellar mass in the distant universe by measuring redshifts of the mostobscured galaxies through millimeter spectroscopy.

0904.0028	a laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south - submillimeter  properties of near-ir selected galaxies	using the 330hr eso-mpg 870-micron survey of the extended chandra deep fieldsouth (ecdf-s) obtained with the large apex bolometer camera (laboca) on theatacama pathfinder experiment (apex), we have carried out a stacking analysisat submillimeter (submm) wavelengths of a sample of 8266 near-infra-red(near-ir) selected (k_vega &lt;= 20) galaxies, including 893 bzk galaxies, 1253extremely red objects (eros) and 737 distant red galaxies (drgs), selected fromthe multi-wavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc). we measure average870-micron fluxes of 0.20+-0.01mjy (20.0sigma), 0.45+-0.04mjy (11.3sigma),0.42+-0.03mjy (14.0sigma), and 0.41+-0.04mjy (10.3sigma) for the k_vega &lt;= 20,bzk, ero and drg samples, respectively. for the bzk, ero and drg subsamples,which overlap to some degree and are like to be at z ~ 1-2, this implies anaverage far-ir luminosity of ~2-6x10^{11} lsolar and star formation rate of~40-100msolar. splitting the bzk galaxies up into star-forming (sbzk) andpassive (pbzk) galaxies, the former is significantly detected (0.48+-0.04mjy,12.0sigma) while the latter is only marginally detected (0.27+-0.10mjy,2.7sigma), thus confirming that the sbzk/pbzk criteria do isolate obscured,star forming and truly passive galaxies. the k_vega &lt;= 20 galaxies are found tocontribute with 6.6+-0.3jy deg^{-2} (~15%) to the 870-micron extragalacticbackground light (ebl). sbzk and pbzk galaxies contribute 1.7+-0.2jy deg^{-2}(~4%) and 0.2+-0.1 jy deg^{-2} (&lt; 0.5%) to the ebl.

0905.3637	low, milky-way like, molecular gas excitation of massive disk galaxies  at z~1.5	we present evidence for milky-way-like, low-excitation molecular gasreservoirs in near-ir selected massive galaxies at z~1.5, based on iram plateaude bure interferometer co[3-2] and nrao very large array co[1-0] lineobservations for two galaxies that had been previously detected in co[2-1]emission. the co[3-2] flux of bzk-21000 at z=1.522 is comparable within theerrors to its co[2-1] flux, implying that the co[3-2] transition issignificantly sub-thermally excited. the combined co[1-0] observations of thetwo sources result in a detection at the 3 sigma level that is consistent witha higher co[1-0] luminosity than that of co[2-1]. contrary to what is observedin submillimeter galaxies and qsos, in which the co transitions are thermallyexcited up to j&gt;=3, these galaxies have low-excitation molecular gas, similarto that in the milky way and local spirals. this is the first time that suchconditions have been observed at high redshift. a large velocity gradientanalysis suggests that molecular clouds with density and kinetic temperaturecomparable to local spirals can reproduce our observations. the similarity inthe co excitation properties suggests that a high, milky-way-like, co to h_2conversion factor could be appropriate for these systems. if suchlow-excitation properties are representative of ordinary galaxies at highredshift, centimeter telescopes such as the expanded very large array and thelongest wavelength atacama large millimeter array bands will be the best toolsfor studying the molecular gas content in these systems through theobservations of co emission lines.

0910.2821	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south	we present a sensitive 870 micron survey of the extended chandra deep fieldsouth (ecdfs) using laboca on the apex telescope. the laboca ecdfssubmillimetre survey (less) covers the full 30' x 30' field size of the ecdfsand has a uniform noise level of 1.2 mjy/beam. less is thus the largestcontiguous deep submillimetre survey undertaken to date. the noise propertiesof our map show clear evidence that we are beginning to be affected byconfusion noise. we present a catalog of 126 smgs detected with a significancelevel above 3.7 sigma. the ecdfs exhibits a deficit of bright smgs relative topreviously studied blank fields but not of normal star-forming galaxies thatdominate the extragalactic background light (ebl). this is in line with theunderdensities observed for optically defined high redshift source populationsin the ecdfs (bzks, drgs,optically bright agn and massive k-band selectedgalaxies). the differential source counts in the full field are well describedby a power law with a slope of alpha=-3.2, comparable to the results from otherfields. we show that the shape of the source counts is not uniform across thefield. the integrated 870 micron flux densities of our source-count modelsaccount for &gt;65% of the estimated ebl from cobe measurements. we haveinvestigated the clustering of smgs in the ecdfs by means of a two-pointcorrelation function and find evidence for strong clustering on angular scales&lt;1'. assuming a power law dependence for the correlation function and a typicalredshift distribution for the smgs we derive a spatial correlation length ofr_0=13+/-6 h^-1 mpc.

0911.2776	very high gas fractions and extended gas reservoirs in z=1.5 disk  galaxies	we present evidence for very high gas fractions and extended molecular gasreservoirs in normal, near-infrared selected (bzk) galaxies at z~1.5, based onmulti-configuration co[2-1] observations obtained at the iram pdbi. six of thesix galaxies observed were securely detected. high resolution observationsresolve the co emission in four of them, implying sizes of order of 6-11 kpcand suggesting the presence of rotation. the uv morphologies are consistentwith clumpy, unstable disks, and the uv sizes are consistent with the co sizes.the star formation efficiencies are homogeneously low and similar to localspirals - the resulting gas depletion times are ~0.5 gyr, much higher than whatis seen in high-z submm galaxies and quasars. the co luminosities can bepredicted to within 0.15 dex from the star formation rates and stellar masses,implying a tight correlation of the gas mass with these quantities. we usedynamical models of clumpy disk galaxies to derive dynamical masses. thesemodels are able to reproduce the peculiar spectral line shapes of the coemission. after accounting for the stellar and dark matter masses we derive gasmasses of 0.4-1.2x10^11 msun. the conversion factor is very high:alpha_co=3.6+-0.8, consistent with the galaxy but four times higher than thatof local ultra-luminous ir galaxies. the gas accounts for an impressive 50-65%of the baryons within the galaxies' half light radii. we are witnessing trulygas-dominated galaxies at z~1.5, a finding that explains the high specific sfrsobserved for z&gt;1 galaxies. the bzk galaxies can be viewed as scaled-up versionsof local disk galaxies, with low efficiency star formation taking place insideextended, low excitation gas disks. they are markedly different than localulirgs and high-z submm galaxies, which have more excited and compact gas.

1003.3889	different star formation laws for disks versus starbursts at low and  high redshifts	we present evidence that 'bona fide' disks and starburst systems occupydistinct regions in the gas mass versus star formation (sf) rate plane, bothfor the integrated quantities and for the respective surface densities. thisresult is based on co observations of galaxy populations at low and highredshifts, and on the current consensus for the co luminosity to gas massconversion factors. the data suggest the existence of two different starformation regimes: a long-lasting mode for disks and a more rapid mode forstarbursts, the latter probably occurring during major mergers or in densenuclear sf regions. both modes are observable over a large range of sf rates.the detection of co emission from distant near-ir selected galaxies revealssuch bimodal behavior for the first time, as they allow us to probe gas in diskgalaxies with much higher sf rates than are seen locally. the different regimescan potentially be interpreted as the effect of a top-heavy imf in starbursts.however, we favor a different physical origin related to the fraction ofmolecular gas in dense clouds. the ir luminosity to gas mass ratio (i.e., thesf efficiency) appears to be inversely proportional to the dynamical (rotation)timescale. only when accounting for the dynamical timescale, a universal sf lawis obtained, suggesting a direct link between global galaxy properties and thelocal sf rate.

1005.1154	far-infrared properties of submillimeter and optically faint radio  galaxies	we use deep observations obtained with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) onboard the herschel space observatory to study thefar-infrared (fir) properties of submm and optically faint radio galaxies (smgsand ofrgs). from literature we compiled a sample of 35 securely identified smgsand nine ofrgs located in the goods-n and the a2218 fields. this sample iscross-matched with our pacs 100 um and 160 um multi-wavelength catalogs. abouthalf of the galaxies in our sample are detected with pacs. the dusttemperatures and the infrared luminosities of our galaxies are derived byfitting their pacs and scuba 850 um (only the upper limits for the ofrgs) fluxdensities with a single modified (beta=1.5) black body function. the mediandust temperature of our smg sample is t=36+/-8k while for our ofrg sample it ist=47+/-3k. for both samples, median dust temperatures derived from herscheldata agree well with previous estimates. in particular, chapman et al. (2005)found a dust temperature of t=36+/-7k for a large sample of smgs assuming thevalidity of the fir/radio correlation. the agreement between our studiesconfirms that the local fir/radio correlation effectively holds at highredshift even though we find &lt;q&gt;=2.17+/-0.19, a slightly lower value than thatobserved in local systems. the median ir luminosities of smgs and ofrgs are4.6*10^12 lsun and 2.6*10^12 lsun, respectively. we note that for both samplesthe ir luminosity estimates from the radio part of the spectral energydistribution are accurate, while estimates from the mid-ir are considerably(x3) more uncertain. our observations confirm the remarkably high luminositiesof smgs and thus imply median star-formation rates of 960msun yr^-1 for smgswith s(850um)&gt;5mjy and 460msun yr^-1 for smgs with s(850um)&gt;2mjy, assuming achabrier imf and no dominant agn contribution to the far-infrared luminosity.

1005.5016	herschel/pacs far-infrared photometry of two z&gt;4 quasars	we present herschel far-infrared (fir) observations of two sub-mm brightquasars at high redshift: sdss j1148+5251 (z=6.42) and br 1202-0725 (z=4.69)obtained with the pacs instrument. both objects are detected in the pacsphotometric bands. the herschel measurements provide additional data pointsthat constrain the fir spectral energy distributions (seds) of both sources,and they emphasise a broad range of dust temperatures in these objects. forlambda_rest ~&lt; 20mu, the two seds are very similar to the average seds ofquasars at low redshift. in the fir, however, both quasars show excess emissioncompared to low-z qso templates, most likely from cold dust powered by vigorousstar formation in the qso host galaxies. for sdss j1148+5251 we detect anotherobject at 160mu with a distance of ~10 arcseconds from the qso. although nophysical connection between the quasar and this object can be shown with theavailable data, it could potentially confuse low-resolution measurements, thusresulting in an overestimate of the fir luminosity of the z=6.42 quasar.

1005.5678	the dust content of high-z submillimeter galaxies revealed by herschel	we use deep observations taken with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs), on board the herschel satellite as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) guaranteed project along with submm ground-basedobservations to measure the dust mass of a sample of high-z submillimetergalaxies (smgs). we investigate their dust content relative to their stellarand gas masses, and compare them with local star-forming galaxies. high-z smgsare dust rich, i.e. they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared tolocal spiral galaxies (by a factor of 30) and also compared to localultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, by a factor of 6). this indicates thatthe large masses of gas typically hosted in smgs have already been highlyenriched with metals and dust. indeed, for those smgs whose gas mass ismeasured, we infer dust-to-gas ratios similar or higher than local spirals andulirgs. however, similarly to other strongly star-forming galaxies in the localuniverse and at high-z, smgs are characterized by gas metalicities lower (by afactor of a few) than local spirals, as inferred from their optical nebularlines, which are generally ascribed to infall of metal-poor gas. this is incontrast with the large dust content inferred from the far-ir and submm data.in short, the metalicity inferred from the dust mass is much higher (by morethan an order of magnitude) than that inferred from the optical nebular lines.we discuss the possible explanations of this discrepancy and the possibleimplications for the investigation of the metalicity evolution at high-z.

1006.2137	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south: a  photometric redshift survey of submillimetre galaxies	[abridged] we derive photometric redshifts from 17-band optical to mid-irphotometry of 74 robust counterparts to 68 of the 126 submillimetre galaxies(smgs) selected at 870um by laboca observations in the ecdfs. the medianphotometric redshift of identified smgs is z=2.2\pm0.1, the interquartile rangeis z=1.8-2.7 and we identify 10 (~15%) high-redshift (z&gt;3) smgs. we derive asimple redshift estimator for smgs based on the 3.6 and 8um fluxes, which isaccurate to delta_z~0.4 for smgs at z&lt;4. a statistical analysis of sourcesaround unidentified smgs identifies a population of likely counterparts with aredshift distribution peaking at z=2.5\pm0.3, which likely comprises ~60% ofthe unidentified smgs. this confirms that the bulk of the undetected smgs arecoeval with those detected in the radio/mid-ir. we conclude that ~15% of allthe smgs are below the flux limits of our survey and lie at z&gt;3 and hence ~30%of all smgs have z&gt;3. we estimate that the full s_870um&gt;4mjy smg population hasa median redshift of 2.5\pm0.6. in contrast to previous suggestions we find nosignificant correlation between s_870um and redshift. the median stellar massof the smgs derived from sed fitting is (9.2\pm0.9)x10^10msun and theinterquartile range is (4.7-14)x10^10msun, although we caution that uncertaintyin the star-formation histories results in a factor of ~5 uncertainty in thesestellar masses. the median characteristic dust temperature of smgs is35.9\pm1.4k and the interquartile range is 28.5-43.3k. the infrared luminosityfunction shows that smgs at z=2-3 typically have higher far-ir luminosities andluminosity density than those at z=1-2. this is mirrored in the evolution ofthe star-formation rate density (sfrd) for smgs which peaks at z~2. the maximumcontribution of bright smgs to the global sfrd (~5% for smgs with s_870um&gt;4mjy;~50% for smgs with s_870um&gt;1mjy) also occurs at z~2.

1009.1058	evolution of dust temperature of galaxies through cosmic time as seen by  herschel	we study the dust properties of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2.8observed by the herschel space observatory in the field of the greatobservatories origins deep survey-north as part of pep and hermes keyprogrammes. infrared (ir) luminosity (l_ir) and dust temperature (t_dust) ofgalaxies are derived from the spectral energy distribution (sed) fit of thefar-infrared (fir) flux densities obtained with pacs and spire instrumentsonboard herschel. as a reference sample, we also obtain ir luminosities anddust temperatures of local galaxies at z&lt;0.1 using akari and iras data in thefield of the sloan digital sky survey. we compare the l_ir-t_dust relationbetween the two samples and find that: the median t_dust of herschel-selectedgalaxies at z&gt;0.5 with l_ir&gt;5x10^{10} l_\odot, appears to be 2-5 k colder thanthat of akari-selected local galaxies with similar luminosities; and thedispersion in t_dust for high-z galaxies increases with l_ir due to theexistence of cold galaxies that are not seen among local galaxies. we show thatthis large dispersion of the l_ir-t_dust relation can bridge the gap betweenlocal star-forming galaxies and high-z submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we alsofind that three smgs with very low t_dust (&lt;20 k) covered in this study haveclose neighbouring sources with similar 24-\mum brightness, which could lead toan overestimation of fir/(sub)millimeter fluxes of the smgs.

1105.2537	goods-herschel: an infrared main sequence for star-forming galaxies	we present the deepest far-ir observations obtained with herschel and examinethe 3-500um seds of galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, supplemented by a local referencesample from iras, iso, spitzer and akari data. we find that the ratio of totalir luminosity to rest-frame 8um luminosity, ir8 (=lir/l8), follows a gaussiandistribution centered on ir8=4 and defines an ir main sequence (ms). a minoritypopulation (&lt;20 %) of outliers producing a tail skewed toward higher values ofir8 consist of starbursts (sb) with compact projected star formation densities.ir8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of starformation from compact sbs with high-ir8, high projected ir surface brightness(&gt;3x10^10 lsun kpc^-2) and a high specific sfr (i.e., sbs). the rest-frame,uv-2700a size of these distant sbs is typically half that of ms galaxies,supporting the correlation between star formation density and sb activity thatis measured for the local sample. locally, (u)lirgs are systematically in thesb mode, whereas most distant (u)lirgs form stars in the "normal" ms mode. thisconfusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called"mid-ir excess" population of galaxies found at z&gt;1.5 by previous studies. msgalaxies have strong pah emission line features, a broad far-ir bump resultingfrom a combination of dust temperatures (tdust~15-50 k), and an effectivetdust~31 k, as derived from the peak wavelength of their ir sed. galaxies inthe sb regime instead exhibit weak pah ew and a sharper far-ir bump with aneffective tdust~40 k. finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far iremission of x-ray agns is predominantly produced by star formation and thatcandidate dusty agns with a power-law emission in the mid-ir systematicallyoccur in compact, dusty sbs. after correcting for the effect of sbs on ir8, weidentify new candidates for extremely obscured agns.

1105.3924	physical conditions of the interstellar medium of high-redshift,  strongly lensed submillimetre galaxies from the herschel-atlas	we present herschel-spire fourier transform spectrometer (fts) and radiofollow-up observations of two herschel-atlas (h-atlas) detected strongly lenseddistant galaxies. in one of the targeted galaxies h-atlas j090311.6+003906(sdp.81) we detect [oiii] 88\mum and [cii] 158\mum lines at a signal-to-noiseratio of ~5. we do not have any positive line identification in the otherfainter target h-atlas j091305.0-005343 (sdp.130). currently sdp.81 is thefaintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the fts, withcontinuum flux just below 200 mjy in the 200-600 \mum wavelength range. thederived redshift of sdp.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 +/-0.012, inagreement with ground-based co measurements. this is the first detection byherschel of the [oiii] 88\mum line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05.comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociationregion (pdr) models with different physical conditions, we derive the pdr clouddensity n ~ 2000 cm^{-3} and the far-uv ionizing radiation field g_0 ~ 200 (inunits of the habing field -- the local galactic interstellar radiation field of1.6x10^{-6} w/m^2). using the co derived molecular mass and the pdr propertieswe estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. thesecharacteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. the radioobservations indicate that sdp.81 deviates significantly from the localfir/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission iscoming from an agn. the constraints on the source size from millimiter-waveobservations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible agncontribution to less than 33%. these indications, together with the high[oiii]/fir ratio and the upper limit of [oi] 63\mum/[cii] 158\mum suggest thatsome fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an agn.

1106.4284	goods-herschel: the far-infrared view of star formation in agn host  galaxies since z~3	we present a study of the infrared properties of x-ray selected, moderateluminosity (lx=10^{42}-10^{44}ergs/s) active galactic nuclei (agns) up to z~3,to explore the links between star formation in galaxies and accretion ontotheir central black holes. we use 100um and 160um fluxes from goods-herschel-the deepest survey yet undertaken by the herschel telescope- and show that in&gt;94 per cent of cases these fluxes are dominated by the host. we find noevidence of any correlation between the x-ray and infrared luminosities ofmoderate agns at any redshift, suggesting that star-formation is decoupled fromnuclear (agn) activity. the star formation rates of agn hosts increase stronglywith redshift; by a factor of 43 from z&lt;0.1 to z=2-3 for agns with the samex-ray luminosities. this increase is consistent with the factor of 25-50increase in the specific star formation rates (ssfrs) of normal, star-forming(main-sequence) galaxies. indeed, the average ssfrs of agn hosts are onlymarginally (20 per cent) lower than those of main-sequence galaxies, with thissmall deficit being due to a fraction of agns residing in quiescent (low-ssfr)galaxies. we estimate 79+/-10 per cent of moderate agns are hosted inmain-sequence galaxies, 15+/-7 per cent in quiescent galaxies and &lt;10 per centin strongly starbursting galaxies. the fractions of all main sequence galaxiesat z&lt;2 experiencing a period of moderate nuclear activity is strongly dependenton galaxy stellar mass (mstars); rising from a few per cent atmstars~10^{10}msun to &gt;20 per cent at mstars&gt;10^{11}msun. our results indicatethat it is galaxy stellar mass that is most important in dictating whether agalaxy hosts a moderate luminosity agn. we argue that the majority of moderatenuclear activity is fuelled by internal mechanisms rather than violent mergers,suggesting that disk instabilities could be an important agn feeding mechanism.

1107.1049	goods-herschel: evidence for a uv extinction bump in galaxies at z &gt; 1	dust attenuation curves in external galaxies are useful to study their dustproperties as well as to interpret their intrinsic spectral energydistributions. in particular the presence or absence of a uv bump at 2175 aremains an open issue which has consequences on the interpretation of broadband colours of distant galaxies. we study the dust attenuation curve in the uvrange at z &gt;1. in particular we search for the presence of a uv bump. we usedeep photometric data of the cdfs obtained with intermediate and broad bandfilters by the musyc project to sample the uv rest-frame of galaxies with 1&lt;z&lt;2. herschel/pacs and spitzer/mips data are used to measure the dust emission.30 galaxies were selected with high s/n in all bands. their seds from the uv tothe far-ir are fitted using the cigale code and the characteristics of the dustattenuation curve are obtained. the mean dust attenuation curve we deriveexhibits a uv bump at 2175a whose amplitude corresponds to 35 % (76%) that ofthe mw (lmc2 supershell) extinction curve. an analytical expression of theaverage attenuation curve is given, it is found slightly steeper than thecalzetti et al. one, although at a 1 sigma level. our galaxy sample is used tostudy the derivation of the slopes of the uv continuum from broad band colours,including the galex fuv-nuv colour. systematic errors induced by the presenceof the bump are quantified. we compare dust attenuation factors measured withcigale to the slope of the uv continuum and find that there is a large scatteraround the relation valid for local starbursts (0.7 mag). the uncertainties onthe determination of the uv slope lead to an extra systematic error of theorder of 0.3 to 0.7 mag on dust attenuation when a filter overlaps the uv bump.

1107.2653	goods-herschel measurements of the dust attenuation of typical  star-forming galaxies at high redshift: observations of uv-selected galaxies  at z~2	we take advantage of the sensitivity and resolution of herschel at 100 and160 micron to directly image the thermal dust emission and investigate theinfrared luminosities, l(ir), and dust obscuration of typical star-forming (l*)galaxies at high redshift. our sample consists of 146 uv-selected galaxies withspectroscopic redshifts 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 in the goods-north field. supplemented withdeep very large array (vla) and spitzer imaging, we construct median stacks atthe positions of these galaxies at 24, 100, and 160 micron, and 1.4 ghz. thecomparison between these stacked fluxes and a variety of dust templates andcalibrations implies that typical star-forming galaxies with uv luminositiesl(uv)&gt;1e10 lsun at z~2 are luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) with a medianl(ir)=(2.2+/-0.3)e11 lsun. typical galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 have a median dustobscuration l(ir)/l(uv) = 7.1+/-1.1, which corresponds to a dust correctionfactor, required to recover the bolometric star formation rate (sfr) from theunobscured uv sfr, of 5.2+/-0.6. this result is similar to that inferred fromprevious investigations of the uv, h-alpha, 24 micron, radio, and x-rayproperties of the same galaxies studied here. stacking in bins of uv slopeimplies that l* galaxies with redder spectral slopes are also dustier, and thatthe correlation between uv slope and dustiness is similar to that found forlocal starburst galaxies. hence, the rest-frame 30 and 50 micron fluxesvalidate on average the use of the local uv attenuation curve to recover thedust attenuation of typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. in thesimplest interpretation, the agreement between the local and high redshift uvattenuation curves suggests a similarity in the dust production and stellar anddust geometries of starburst galaxies over the last 10 billion years.

1107.4979	observation of h2o in a strongly lensed herschel-atlas source at z=2.3	the herschel survey, h-atlas, with its large areal coverage, has recentlydiscovered a number of bright, strongly lensed high-z submillimeter galaxies.the strong magnification makes it possible to study molecular species otherthan co, which are otherwise difficult to observe in high-z galaxies. among thelensed galaxies already identified by h-atlas, the source j090302.9-014127b(sdp.17b) at z = 2.305 is remarkable due to its excitation conditions and atentative detection of the h2o 202-111 emission line (lupu et al. 2010). wereport observations of this line in sdp.17b using the iram interferometerequipped with its new 277- 371ghz receivers. the h2o line is detected at aredshift of z = 2.3049+/-0.0006, with a flux of 7.8+/-0.5 jy km s-1 and a fwhmof 250+/-60 km s-1. the new flux is 2.4 times weaker than the previoustentative detection, although both remain marginally consistent within1.6-sigma. the intrinsic line luminosity and ratio of h2o(202-111)/co8-7 seemcomparable with those of the nearby starburst/enshrouded-agn mrk 231,suggesting that sdp.17b could also host a luminous agn. the detection of astrong h2o 202-111 line in sdp.17b implies an efficient excitation mechanism ofthe water levels that must occur in very dense and warm interstellar gas.

1108.0838	goods-herschel a population of 24micron dropout sources at z &lt; 2	using extremely deep pacs 100- and 160um herschel data from thegoods-herschel program, we identify 21 infrared bright galaxies previouslymissed in the deepest 24um surveys performed by mips. these mips dropouts arepredominantly found in two redshift bins, centred at z ~0.4 and ~1.3. theirs_100/s_24 flux density ratios are similar to those of local lirgs and ulirgs,whose silicate absorption features at 18um (at z ~ 0.4) and 9.7um (at z ~ 1.3)are shifted into the 24um mips band at these redshifts. the high-z sub-sampleconsists of 11 infrared luminous sources, accounting for ~2% of the wholegoods-herschel sample and putting strong upper limits on the fraction oflirgs/ulirgs at 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.7 that are missed by the 24um surveys. we find that as_100/s_24 &gt; 43 colour cut selects galaxies with a redshift distributionsimilar to that of the mips dropouts and when combined with a second colourcut, s_16/s_8 &gt; 4, isolates sources at 1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.7. we show that thesesources have elevated specific star formation rates (ssfr) compared to mainsequence galaxies at these redshifts and are likely to be compact starburstswith moderate/strong 9.7um silicate absorption features in their mid-irspectra. herschel data reveal that their infrared luminosities extrapolatedfrom the 24um flux density are underestimated, on average, by a factor of ~3.these silicate break galaxies account for 16% (8%) of the ulirg (lirg)population in the goods fields, indicating a lower limit in their space densityof 2.0 \times 10^(-5) mpc^(-3). finally, we provide estimates of the fractionof z &lt; 2 mips dropout sources as a function of the 24-, 100-, 160-, 250- and350um sensitivity limits, and conclude that previous predictions of apopulation of silicate break galaxies missed by the major 24um extragalacticsurveys have been overestimated.

1109.1937	goods-herschel: the impact of galaxy-galaxy interactions on the  far-infrared properties of galaxies	we study the impact of galaxy-galaxy interactions on the fir properties ofgalaxies and its evolution at 0&lt;z&lt;1.2. using the high-z galaxies in the fieldsof goods observed by herschel in the framework of the goods-herschel keyprogram and the local iras or akari-selected galaxies in the field of sdss dr7,we investigate the dependence of galaxy properties on the morphology of and thedistance to the nearest neighbor galaxy. we find that the sfrs and the ssfrs ofgalaxies, on average, depend on the morphology of and the distance to thenearest neighbor galaxy in this redshift range. when a late-type galaxy has aclose neighbor galaxy, the sfr and the ssfr increase as it approaches alate-type neighbor, which is supported by k-s and mc tests with a significancelevel of &gt;99%. however, the sfr and the ssfr decrease or do not change much asit approaches an early-type neighbor. the bifurcations of sfrs and ssfrsdepending on the neighbor's morphology seem to occur at r_n~0.5r_vir,nei, whichis supported by k-s and mc tests with a significance level of &gt;98%. for allredshift bins, the ssfrs of late-type galaxies interacting with late-typeneighbors are increased by factors of about 1.8+/-0.7 and 4.0+/-1.2 compared tothose of non-interacting galaxies when the pair separation is smaller than0.5r_vir,nei and 0.1r_vir,nei, respectively. the tdust of both local and high-zlate-type galaxies strongly interacting with late-type neighbors (i.e. r_n &lt;0.1r_vir,nei) appears to be higher than that of non-interacting galaxies with asignificance level of 96-99%. however, tdust of local late-type galaxiesstrongly interacting with early-type neighbors seems to be lower than orsimilar to that of non-interacting galaxies. our results suggest thatgalaxy-galaxy interactions and mergers have been strongly affecting the sfr andthe dust properties of star-forming galaxies over at least 8 billion years.

1110.2946	the evolution of the star formation activity per halo mass up to  redshift ~ 1.6 as seen by herschel	star formation in massive galaxies is quenched at some point duringhierarchical mass assembly. to understand where and when the quenchingprocesses takes place, we study the evolution of the total star formation rateper unit total halo mass (\sigma(sfr/m)) in three different mass scales: lowmass halos (field galaxies), groups, and clusters, up to a redshift ~1.6. weuse deep far-infrared pacs data at 100 and 160 um to accurately estimate thetotal star formation rate of the luminous infrared galaxy population of 9clusters with mass ~10^{15} m_{\odot}, and 9 groups/poor clusters with mass ~ 5x 10^{13} m_{\odot}. estimates of the field \sigma(sfr/m) are derived from theliterature, by dividing the star formation rate density by the mean comovingmatter density of the universe. the field \sigma(sfr/m) increases with redshiftup to z~1 and it is constant thereafter. the evolution of the \sigma(sfr/m)-zrelation in galaxy systems is much faster than in the field. up to redshiftz~0.2, the field has a higher \sigma(sfr/m) than galaxy groups and galaxyclusters. at higher redshifts, galaxy groups and the field have similar\sigma(sfr/m), while massive clusters have significantly lower \sigma(sfr/m)than both groups and the field. there is a hint of a reversal of the sfractivity vs. environment at z~1.6, where the group \sigma(sfr/m) lies above thefield \sigma(sfr/m)-z relation. we discuss possible interpretations of ourresults in terms of the processes of downsizing, and star-formation quenching.

1202.0402	herschel-atlas: towards a sample of ~1000 strongly-lensed galaxies	while the selection of strongly lensed galaxies with 500{\mu}m flux densitys_500&gt;100 mjy has proven to be rather straightforward (negrello et al. 2010),for many applications it is important to analyze samples larger than the onesobtained when confining ourselves to such a bright limit. moreover, only byprobing to fainter flux densities is possible to exploit strong lensing toinvestigate the bulk of the high-z star-forming galaxy population. we describehalos (the herschel-atlas lensed objects selection), a method for efficientlyselecting fainter candidate strongly lensed galaxies, reaching a surfacedensity of ~1.5-2 deg^-2, i.e. a factor of about 4 to 6 higher than that at the100 mjy flux limit. halos will allow the selection of up to ~1000 candidatestrongly lensed galaxies (with amplifications \mu&gt;2) over the full h-atlassurvey area. applying halos to the h-atlas science demonstration phase field(~14.4 deg^2) we find 31 candidate strongly lensed galaxies, whose candidatelenses are identified in the viking near-infrared catalog. using the availableinformation on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a~72% purity of the sample. the redshift distribution of the candidate lensedsources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensedgalaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to substantially higherredshifts than found in the other surveys. the counts of candidate stronglylensed galaxies are also in good agreement with model predictions (lapi et al.2011). even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infraredviking photometry, we show that h-atlas data alone allow the selection of asimilarly deep sample of candidate strongly lensed galaxies with an efficiencyclose to 50%; a slightly lower surface density (~1.45 deg^-2) can be reachedwith a ~70% efficiency.

1202.0761	a herschel view of the far-infrared properties of submillimetre galaxies	we study a sample of 61 submillimetre galaxies (smgs) selected fromground-based surveys, with known spectroscopic redshifts and observed withherschel as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key programmes. we use the broadfar-infrared wavelength coverage (100-600um) provided by the combination ofpacs and spire observations. using a power-law temperature distribution modelto derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dustemissivity spectral index for smgs of beta=2.0+/-0.2. our results unveil thediversity of the smg population. some smgs exhibit extreme infraredluminosities of ~10^13 lsun and relatively warm dust components, while othersare fainter (~10^12 lsun) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. theextreme infrared luminosities of some smgs (lir&gt;10^12.7 lsun, 26/61 systems)imply sfrs of &gt;500msun yr^-1. such high sfrs are difficult to reconcile with asecular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-drivenstage in the evolution of these galaxies. another observational argument infavour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than thatof smgs of lower luminosities (~40k as opposed to ~25k), consistent withobservations of local ulirgs triggered by major mergers and with results fromhydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfercalculations. luminous smgs are also offset from normal star-forming galaxiesin the stellar mass-sfr plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburstevents with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. onthe other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity smgs havecold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of starformation, and thus might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation.[abridged]

1207.2724	a detailed gravitational lens model based on submillimeter array and  keck adaptive optics imaging of a herschel-atlas sub-millimeter galaxy at  z=4.243	we present high-spatial resolution imaging obtained with the submillimeterarray (sma) at 880um and the keck adaptive optics (ao) system at ks-band of agravitationally lensed sub-millimeter galaxy (smg) at z=4.243 discovered in theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey. the sma data (angularresolution ~0.6") resolve the dust emission into multiple lensed images, whilethe keck ao ks-band data (angular resolution ~0.1") resolve the lens into apair of galaxies separated by 0.3". we present an optical spectrum of theforeground lens obtained with the gemini-south telescope that provides a lensredshift of z_lens = 0.595 +/- 0.005. we develop and apply a new lens modelingtechnique in the visibility plane that shows that the smg is magnified by afactor of mu = 4.1 +/- 0.2 and has an intrinsic infrared (ir) luminosity ofl_ir = (2.1 +/- 0.2) x 10^13 lsun. we measure a half-light radius of thebackground source of r_s = 4.4 +/- 0.5 kpc which implies an ir luminositysurface density of sigma_ir = (3.4 +/- 0.9) x 10^11 lsun kpc^-2, a value thatis typical of z &gt; 2 smgs but significantly lower than ir luminous galaxies atz~0. the two lens galaxies are compact (r_lens ~ 0.9 kpc) early-types witheinstein radii of theta_e1 = 0.57 +/- 0.01 and theta_e2 = 0.40 +/- 0.01 thatimply masses of m_lens1 = (7.4 +/- 0.5) x 10^10 msun and m_lens2 = (3.7 +/-0.3) x 10^10 msun. the two lensing galaxies are likely about to undergo adissipationless merger, and the mass and size of the resultant system should besimilar to other early-type galaxies at z~0.6. this work highlights theimportance of high spatial resolution imaging in developing models of stronglylensed galaxies discovered by herschel.

1207.7129	goods-herschel: ultra-deep xmm-newton observations reveal  agn/star-formation connection	models of galaxy evolution assume some connection between the agn and starformation activity in galaxies. we use the multi-wavelength information of thecdfs to assess this issue. we select the agns from the 3ms xmm-newton surveyand measure the star-formation rates of their hosts using data that proberest-frame wavelengths longward of 20 um. star-formation rates are obtainedfrom spectral energy distribution fits, identifying and subtracting an agncomponent. we divide the star-formation rates by the stellar masses of thehosts to derive specific star-formation rates (ssfr) and find evidence for apositive correlation between the agn activity (proxied by the x-ray luminosity)and the ssfr for the most active systems with x-ray luminosities exceedinglx=10^43 erg/s and redshifts z~1. we do not find evidence for such acorrelation for lower luminosity systems or those at lower redshifts. we do notfind any correlation between the sfr (or the ssfr) and the x-ray absorptionderived from high-quality xmm-newton spectra either, showing that theabsorption is likely to be linked to the nuclear region rather than the host,while the star-formation is not nuclear. comparing the ssfr of the hosts to thecharacteristic ssfr of star-forming galaxies at the same redshift we find thatthe agns reside mostly in main-sequence and starburst hosts, reflecting the agn- ssfr connection. limiting our analysis to the highest x-ray luminosity agns(x-ray qsos with lx&gt;10^44 erg/s), we find that the highest-redshift qsos (withz&gt;2) reside predominantly in starburst hosts, with an average ssfr more thandouble that of the "main sequence", and we find a few cases of qsos at z~1.5with specific star-formation rates compatible with the main-sequence, or evenin the "quiescent" region.

1209.1484	the molecular gas content of z = 3 lyman break galaxies; evidence of a  non evolving gas fraction in main sequence galaxies at z &gt; 2	we present observations of the co[3-2] emission towards two massive andinfrared luminous lyman break galaxies at z = 3.21 and z = 2.92, using the iramplateau de bure interferometer, placing first constraints on the molecular gasmasses (mgas) of non-lensed lbgs. their overall properties are consistent withthose of typical (main-sequence) galaxies at their redshifts, with specificstar formation rates ~1.6 and ~2.2 gyr^(-1), despite their large infraredluminosities l_ir ~2-3 x 10^12 lsun derived from herschel. with one plausibleco detection (spurious detection probability of 10^(-3)) and one upper limit,we investigate the evolution of the molecular gas-to-stellar mass ratio(mgas/m*) with redshift. our data suggest that the steep evolution of mgas/m*of normal galaxies up to z~2 is followed by a flattening at higher redshifts,providing supporting evidence for the existence of a plateau in the evolutionof the specific star formation rate at z &gt; 2.5.

1209.3016	no clear submillimetre signature of suppressed star formation amongst  x-ray luminous agns	many theoretical models require powerful active galactic nuclei (agns) tosuppress star formation in distant galaxies and reproduce the observedproperties of today's massive galaxies. a recent study based on herschel-spiresubmillimetre observations claimed to provide direct support for this picture,reporting a significant decrease in the mean star-formation rates (sfrs) of themost luminous agns (lx&gt;10^44 erg/s) at z=1-3 in the chandra deep field-north(cdf-n). in this letter we extend these results using herschel-spire 250um datain the cosmos and cdf-s fields to achieve an order of magnitude improvement inthe number of sources at lx&gt;10^44 erg/s. on the basis of our analysis, we findno strong evidence for suppressed star formation in lx&gt;10^44 erg/s agns atz=1-3. the mean sfrs of the agns are constant over the broad x-ray luminosityrange of lx~10^43-10^45 erg/s (with mean sfrs consistent with typicalstar-forming galaxies at z~2; &lt;sfrs&gt;~100-200 msol/yr). we suggest that theprevious cdf-n results were likely due to low number statistics. we discuss ourresults in the context of current theoretical models.

1210.1035	the evolving interstellar medium of star forming galaxies since z=2 as  probed by their infrared spectral energy distributions	using data from the mid-infrared to millimeter wavelengths for individualgalaxies and for stacked ensembles at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2, we derive robust estimates ofdust masses (mdust) for main sequence (ms) galaxies, which obey a tightcorrelation between star formation rate (sfr) and stellar mass (m*), and forstar-bursting galaxies that fall outside that relation. exploiting thecorrelation of gas to dust mass with metallicity (mgas/mdust -z), we use ourmeasurements to constrain the gas content, co-to-h2 conversion factors (a_co)and star formation efficiencies (sfe) of these distant galaxies. using largestatistical samples, we confirm that a_co and sfe are an order of magnitudehigher and lower, respectively, in ms galaxies at high redshifts compared tothe values of local galaxies with equivalently high infrared luminosities. forgalaxies within the ms, we show that the variations of specific star formationrates (ssfr=sfr/m*) are driven by varying gas fractions. for relatively massivegalaxies like those in our samples, we show that the hardness of the radiationfield, &lt;u&gt;, which is proportional to the dust mass weighted luminosity(lir/mdust), and the primary parameter defining the shape of the sed, isequivalent to sfe/z. for ms galaxies we measure this quantity, &lt;u&gt;, showingthat it does not depend significantly on either the stellar mass or the ssfr.this is explained as a simple consequence of the existing correlations betweensfr-m*, m*-z and mgas-sfr. instead, we show that &lt;u&gt; (or lir/mdust) doesevolve, with ms galaxies having harder radiation fields and thus warmertemperatures as redshift increases from z=0 to 2, a trend which can also beunderstood based on the redshift evolution of the m*-z and sfr-m* relations.these results motivate the construction of a universal set of sed templates forms galaxies which vary as a function of redshift with only one parameter, &lt;u&gt;.

1210.2760	dust temperature and co-to-h2 conversion factor variations in the sfr-m*  plane	deep herschel imaging and 12co(2-1) line luminosities from the iram pdbi arecombined for a sample of 17 galaxies at z&gt;1 from the goods-n field. the sampleincludes galaxies both on and above the main sequence (ms) traced bystar-forming galaxies in the sfr-m* plane. the far-infrared data are used toderive dust masses, mdust. combined with an empirical prescription for thedependence of the gas-to-dust ratio on metallicity (gdr), the co luminositiesand mdust values are used to derive for each galaxy the co-to-h2 conversionfactor, alpha_co. like in the local universe, the value of alpha_co is a factorof ~5 smaller in starbursts compared to normal star-forming galaxies (sfgs). wealso uncover a relation between alpha_co and dust temperature (tdust; alpha_codecreasing with increasing tdust) as obtained from modified blackbody fits tothe far-infrared data. while the absolute normalization of the alpha_co(tdust)relation is uncertain, the global trend is robust against possible systematicbiases in the determination of mdust, gdr or metallicity. although we cannotformally distinguish between a step and a smooth evolution of alpha_co with thedust temperature, we can conclude that in galaxies of near-solar metallicity, acritical value of tdust=30k can be used to determine whether the appropriatealpha_co is closer to the starburst value (1.0 msun(k kms pc^2)^-1, iftdust&gt;30k) or closer to the galactic value (4.35 msun (k kms pc^2)^-1, iftdust&lt;30k). this indicator has the great advantage of being less subjectivethan visual morphological classifications of mergers/sfgs, which can bedifficult at high z because of the clumpy nature of sfgs. in the absence offar-infrared data, the offset of a galaxy from the main sequence (i.e.,log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]) can be used to identify galaxies requiring theuse of an alpha_co conversion factor lower than the galactic value.

0711.4995	vigorous star formation with low efficiency in massive disk galaxies at  z=1.5	we present the first detection of molecular gas cooling co emission linesfrom ordinary massive galaxies at z=1.5. two sources were observed with theiram plateau de bure interferometer, selected to lie in the mass-star formationrate correlation at their redshift, thus being representative of massive high-zgalaxies. both sources were detected with high confidence, yieldingl'_co~10^{10}k km/s pc^2. for one of the sources we find evidence for velocityshear, implying co sizes of ~10 kpc. with an infrared luminosity ofl_fir~10^{12}l_sun, these disk-like galaxies are borderline ulirgs but withstar formation efficiency similar to that of local spirals, and an order ofmagnitude lower than that in submm galaxies. this suggests a co to total gasconversion factor similar to local spirals, gas consumption timescalesapproaching 1 gyr or longer and molecular gas masses reaching ~10^11 m_sun,comparable to or larger than the estimated stellar masses. these resultssupport a major role of 'in situ' gas consumption over cosmological timescalesand with relatively low star formation efficiency, analogous to that of localspiral disks, for the formation of today's most massive galaxies and theircentral black holes. given the high space density of similar galaxies,~10^{-4}/mpc^3, this implies a widespread presence of gas rich galaxies in theearly universe, many of which might be within reach of detailed investigationsof current and planned facilities.

1301.6618	h2o emission in high-z ultra-luminous infrared galaxies	using iram pdbi we report the detection of h2o in six new lensedultra-luminous starburst galaxies at high redshift, discovered in the herschelh-atlas survey. the sources are detected either in the 2_{02}-1_{11} or2_{11}-2_{02} h_2o emission lines with integrated line fluxes ranging from 1.8to 14 jy.km/s. the corresponding apparent luminosities are mu x l_h2o ~ 3-12 x10^8 lo, where mu is the lensing magnification factor (3 &lt; mu &lt; 12). theseresults confirm that h2o lines are among the strongest molecular lines in suchgalaxies, with intensities almost comparable to those of the high-j co lines,and same profiles and line widths (200-900 km/s) as the latter. with thecurrent sensitivity of pdbi, h2o can therefore easily be detected in high-zlensed galaxies (with f(500um) &gt; 100 mjy) discovered in the herschel surveys.correcting the luminosities for lensing amplification, l_h2o is found to have astrong dependence on the ir luminosity, varying as ~l_ir^{1.2}. this relationwhich needs to be confirmed with better statistics, may indicate a role ofradiative (ir) excitation of the h2o lines, and implies that high-z galaxieswith l_ir &gt;~ 10^13 lo tend to be very strong emitters in h2o, that have noequivalent in the local universe.

1311.2604	an alma survey of sub-millimeter galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: sub-millimeter properties of color-selected galaxies	we study the sub-mm properties of color-selected galaxies via a stackinganalysis applied for the first time to interferometric data at sub-mmwavelengths. we base our study on 344 ghz alma continuum observations of~20''-wide fields centered on 86 sub-mm sources detected in the laboca extendedchandra deep field south sub-mm survey (less). we select various classes ofgalaxies (k-selected, star-forming sbzk galaxies, extremely red objects anddistant red galaxies) according to their optical/nir fluxes. we find clear,&gt;10-sigma detections in the stacked images of all these galaxy classes. weinclude in our stacking analysis herschel/spire data to constrain the dust sedof these galaxies. we find that their dust emission is well described by amodified black body with tdust~30 k and beta=1.6 and ir luminosities of(5-11)x10^{11} lsun, or implied star formation rates of 75-140 msun/yr. wecompare our results with those of previous studies based on single-dishobservations at 870 micron and find that our flux densities are a factor 2-3higher than previous estimates. the discrepancy is observed also after removingsources individually detected in aless maps. we report a similar discrepancy byrepeating our analysis on 1.4\,ghz observations of the whole ecdfs. hence wefind tentative evidence that galaxies that are associated in projected andredshift space with sub-mm bright sources are brighter than the averagepopulation. finally, we put our findings in the context of the cosmic starformation rate density as a function of redshift.

1311.5898	herschel-atlas: deep hst/wfc3 imaging of strongly lensed submillimeter  galaxies	we report on deep near-infrared observations obtained with the wide fieldcamera 3 (wfc3) onboard the hubble space telescope (hst) of the first fiveconfirmed gravitational lensing events discovered by the herschel astrophysicalterahertz large area survey (h-atlas). we succeed in disentangling thebackground galaxy from the lens to gain separate photometry of the twocomponents. the hst data allow us to significantly improve on previousconstraints of the mass in stars of the lensed galaxy and to perform accuratelens modelling of these systems, as described in the accompanying paper by dyeet al. we fit the spectral energy distributions of the background sources fromnear-ir to millimetre wavelengths and use the magnification factors estimatedby dye et al. to derive the intrinsic properties of the lensed galaxies. wefind these galaxies to have star-formation rates of approximately 400 to 2000m_sol/yr, with approximately (6-25)x10^10 m_sol of their baryonic mass alreadyturned into stars. at these rates of star formation, all remaining moleculargas will be exhausted in less than 100 myr, reaching a final mass in stars of afew 10^11 m_sol. these galaxies are thus proto-ellipticals caught during theirmajor episode of star formation, and observed at the peak epoch z=1.5-3 of thecosmic star formation history of the universe.

1402.5976	spectral energy distributions of qsos at z&gt;5: common agn-heated dust and  occasionally strong star-formation	we present spectral energy distributions (seds) of 69 qsos at z&gt;5, covering arest frame wavelength range of 0.1mu to ~80mu, and centered on new spitzer andherschel observations. the detection rate of the qsos with spitzer is very high(97% at lambda_rest ~&lt; 4mu), but drops towards the herschel bands with 30%detected in pacs (rest frame mid-infrared) and 15% additionally in the spire(rest frame far-infrared; fir). we perform multi-component sed fits forherschel-detected objects and confirm that to match the observed seds, a clumpytorus model needs to be complemented by a hot (~1300k) component and, in caseswith prominent fir emission, also by a cold (~50k) component. in the firdetected cases the luminosity of the cold component is on the order of 10^13l_sun which is likely heated by star formation. from the sed fits we alsodetermine that the agn dust-to-accretion disk luminosity ratio declines withuv/optical luminosity. emission from hot (~1300k) dust is common in our sample,showing that nuclear dust is ubiquitous in luminous qsos out to redshift 6.however, about 15% of the objects appear under-luminous in the near infraredcompared to their optical emission and seem to be deficient in (but not devoidof) hot dust. within our full sample, the qsos detected with herschel are foundat the high luminosity end in l_uv/opt and l_nir and show low equivalent widths(ews) in h_alpha and in ly_alpha. in the distribution of h_alpha ews, asdetermined from the spitzer photometry, the high-redshift qsos show littledifference to low redshift agn.

1404.7128	an alma survey of submillimetre galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: radio properties and the far-infrared/radio correlation	we present a study of the radio properties of 870$\mu$m-selectedsubmillimetre galaxies (smgs), observed at high resolution with alma in theextended chandra deep field south. from our initial sample of 76 alma smgs, wedetect 52 smgs at $&gt;3\sigma$ significance in vla 1400mhz imaging, of which 35are also detected at $&gt;3\sigma$ in new 610mhz gmrt imaging. within this sampleof radio-detected smgs, we measure a median radio spectral index$\alpha_{610}^{1400} = -0.79 \pm 0.06$, (with inter-quartile range$\alpha=[-1.16,-0.56]$) and investigate the far-infrared/radio correlation viathe parameter $q_{\rm ir}$, the logarithmic ratio of the rest-frame8-1000$\mu$m flux and monochromatic radio flux. our median $q_{\rm ir} = 2.56\pm 0.05$ (inter-quartile range $q_{\rm ir}=[2.42,2.78]$) is higher than thattypically seen in single-dish 870$\mu$m-selected sources ($q_{\rm ir} \sim2.4$), which may reflect the fact that our alma-based study is not biased toradio-bright counterparts, as previous samples were. finally, we search forevidence that $q_{\rm ir}$ and $\alpha$ evolve with age in a co-dependentmanner, as predicted by starburst models: the data populate the predictedregion of parameter space, with the stellar mass tending to increase alongtracks of $q_{\rm ir}$ versus $\alpha$ in the direction expected, providing thefirst observational evidence in support of these models.

1404.7393	co(1-0) line imaging of massive star-forming disc galaxies at z=1.5-2.2	we present detections of the co(j= 1-0) emission line in a sample of fourmassive star-forming galaxies at z~1.5-2.2 obtained with the karl g. janskyvery large array (vla). combining these observations with previous co(2-1) andco(3-2) detections of these galaxies, we study the excitation properties of themolecular gas in our sample sources. we find an average line brightnesstemperature ratios of r_{21}=0.70+\-0.16 and r_{31}=0.50+\-0.29, based onmeasurements for three and two galaxies, respectively. these results provideadditional support to previous indications of sub-thermal gas excitation forthe co(3-2) line with a typically assumed line ratio r_{31}~0.5. for one of ourtargets, bzk-21000, we present spatially resolved co line maps. at theresolution of 0.18 arcsec (1.5 kpc), most of the emission is resolved outexcept for some clumpy structure. from this, we attempt to identify moleculargas clumps in the data cube, finding 4 possible candidates. we estimate that&lt;40 % of the molecular gas is confined to giant clumps (~1.5 kpc in size), andthus most of the gas could be distributed in small fainter clouds or in fairlydiffuse extended regions of lower brightness temperatures than our sensitivitylimit.

1406.1487	lens models of herschel-selected galaxies from high-resolution near-ir  observations	we present keck-adaptive optics and hubble space telescope high resolutionnear-infrared (ir) imaging for 500 um-bright candidate lensing systemsidentified by the herschel multi-tiered extra-galactic survey (hermes) andherschel astrophysical terahertz survey (h-atlas). out of 87 candidates withnear-ir imaging, 15 (~17%) display clear near-ir lensing morphologies. wepresent near-ir lens models to reconstruct and recover basic rest-frame opticalmorphological properties of the background galaxies from 12 new systems.sources with the largest near-ir magnification factors also tend to be the mostcompact, consistent with the size bias predicted from simulations and pre-vious lensing models for sub-millimeter galaxies. for four new sources thatalso have high-resolution sub-mm maps, we test for differential lensing betweenthe stellar and dust components and find that the 880 um magnification factor(u_880) is ~1.5 times higher than the near-ir magnification factor (u_nir), onaverage. we also find that the stellar emission is ~2 times more extended insize than dust. the rest-frame optical properties of our sample ofherschel-selected lensed smgs are consistent with those of unlensed smgs, whichsuggests that the two populations are similar.

0803.2370	images ii. a surprisingly low fraction of undisturbed rotating spiral  disks at z~0.6: the morpho-kinematical relation 6 gyrs ago	we present a first combined analysis of the morphological and dynamicalproperties for the intermediate mass galaxy evolution sequence (images) sample.it is a representative sample of 52 z~0.6 galaxies with mstell from 1.5 to 1510^10msun and possessing 3d resolved kinematics and hst deep imaging in atleast two broad band filters. we aim at evaluate robustly the evolution ofrotating spirals since z~0.6, as well as to test the different schemes forclassifying galaxies morphologically. we used all the information provided bymulti-band images, color maps and 2 dimensional light fitting to assign to eachobject a morphological class. we divided our sample between spiral disks,peculiar objects, compact objects and mergers. using our morphologicalclassification scheme, 4/5 of identified spirals are rotating disks and morethan 4/5 of identified peculiar galaxies show complex kinematics, whileautomatic classification methods such as concentration-asymmetry and gini-m20severely overestimate the fraction of relaxed disk galaxies. using thismethodology, we find that the fraction of rotating spirals has increased by afactor ~ 2 during the last 6 gyrs, a much higher fraction that found previouslybased on morphologies alone. these rotating spiral disks are forming stars veryrapidly, doubling their stellar masses over the last 6 gyrs, while most oftheir stars have been formed few gyrs earlier, which reveals the presence of alarge gas supply. because they are likely the progenitors of local spirals, wecan conjecture how their properties are evolving. their disks show someevidence for an inside-out growth and the gas supply/accretion is not maderandomly as the disk need to be stable in order to match the local diskproperties.

0803.3002	images-iii: the evolution of the near-infrared tully-fisher relation  over the last 6 gyr	using the multi-integral field spectrograph giraffe at vlt, we have derivedthe k-band tully-fisher relation (tfr) at z~0.6 for a representative sample of65 galaxies with emission lines. we confirm that the scatter in the z~0.6 tfris caused by galaxies with anomalous kinematics, and find a positive and strongcorrelation between the complexity of the kinematics and the scatter that theycontribute to the tfr. considering only relaxed-rotating disks, the scatter,and possibly also the slope of the tfr, do not appear to evolve with z. wedetect an evolution of the k-band tfr zero point between z~0.6 and z=0, which,if interpreted as an evolution of the k-band luminosity of rotating disks,would imply that a brightening of 0.66+/-0.14 mag occurs between z~0.6 and z=0.any disagreement with the results of flores et al. (2006) are attributed toboth an improvement of the local tfr and the more detailed accurate measurementof the rotation velocities in the distant sample. most of the uncertainty canbe explained by the relatively coarse spatial-resolution of the kinematicaldata. because most rotating disks at z~0.6 are unlikely to experience furthermerging events, one may assume that their rotational velocity does not evolvedramatically. if true, our result implies that rotating disks observed at z~0.6are rapidly transforming their gas into stars, to be able to double theirstellar masses and be observed on the tfr at z=0. the rotating disks observedare indeed emission-line galaxies that are either starbursts or lirgs, whichimplies that they are forming stars at a high rate. thus, a significantfraction of the rotating disks are forming the bulk of their stars within 6 to8 gyr, in good agreement with former studies of the evolution of the m-zrelation.

1409.8158	co excitation of normal star forming galaxies out to z=1.5 as regulated  by the properties of their interstellar medium	we investigate the co excitation of normal star forming disk galaxies atz=1.5 using iram pdbi observations of the co[2-1], co[3-2] and co[5-4]transitions for 4 galaxies, including vla observations of co[1-0] for 3 ofthem, with the aim of constraining the average state of h2 gas. exploitingprior knowledge of the velocity range, spatial extent and size of the coemission we measure reliable line fluxes with s/n&gt;4-7 for individualtransitions. while the average co spectral line energy distribution (sled) hasa sub-thermal excitation similar to the milky way (mw) up to co[3-2], we showthat the average co[5-4] emission is four times stronger than assuming mwexcitation. this demonstrates the presence of an additional component of moreexcited, denser and possibly warmer molecular gas. the ratio of co[5-4] tolower-j co emission is lower than in local (u)lirgs and high-redshift smgs,correlating closely with the average intensity of the radiation field &lt;u&gt; andwith the star formation surface density, but not with the sf efficiency (sfe).the co[5-4] luminosity correlates linearly with lir over 4 orders ofmagnitudes, with z=1.5 bzk galaxies following the same trend as local spiralsand (u)lirgs and high redshift star bursting smgs. the co[5-4] luminosity isthus empirically related to the dense gas, and might be a more convenient wayto probe it than standard high--density tracers that are much fainter than co.we see excitation variations among our sample galaxies, that can be linked totheir evolutionary state and clumpiness in optical rest frame images. in onegalaxy we see spatially resolved excitation variations, where the more highlyexcited part of the galaxy corresponds to the location of massive sf clumps.this supports to models that suggest that giant clumps are the main source ofthe high excitation co emission in high redshift disk-like galaxies.

1410.3730	an excess of dusty starbursts related to the spiderweb galaxy	we present apex laboca 870 micron observations of the field around thehigh-redshift radio galaxy mrc1138-262 at z=2.16. we detect 16 submillimetergalaxies in this ~140 square arcmin bolometer map with flux densities in therange 3-11 mjy. the raw number counts indicate a density of submillimetergalaxies (smgs) that is up to four times that of blank field surveys. based onan exquisite multiwavelength database, including vla 1.4 ghz radio and infraredobservations, we investigate whether these sources are members of theprotocluster structure at z=2.2. using herschel pacs+spire and spitzer mipsphotometry, we derive reliable far-infrared photometric redshifts for allsources. follow-up vlt isaac and sinfoni near-infrared spectra confirm thatfour of these smgs have redshifts of z=2.2. we also present evidence thatanother smg in this field, detected earlier at 850 micron, has a counterpartthat exhibits halpha and co(1-0) emission at z=2.15. including the radio galaxyand two smgs with far-ir photometric redshifts at z=2.2, we conclude that atleast eight submm sources are part of the protocluster at z=2.16 associatedwith the radio galaxy mrc1138-262. we measure a star formation rate densitysfrd ~1500 msun yr^-1 mpc^-3, four magnitudes higher than the global sfrd ofblank fields at this redshift. strikingly, these eight sources are concentratedwithin a region of 2 mpc (the typical size of clusters in the local universe)and are distributed within the filaments traced by the halpha emitters atz=2.2. this concentration of massive, dusty starbursts is not centered on thesubmillimeter-bright radio galaxy which could support the infalling of thesesources into the cluster center. approximately half (6/11) of the smgs that arecovered by the halpha imaging data are associated with halpha emitters,demonstrating the potential of tracing smg counterparts with this population(abridged).

1412.2132	the kiloparsec-scale star formation law at redshift 4: wide-spread,  highly efficient star formation in the dust-obscured starburst galaxy gn20	we present high-resolution observations of the 880 $\mu$m (rest-frame fir)continuum emission in the z$=$4.05 submillimeter galaxy gn20 from the iramplateau de bure interferometer (pdbi). these data resolve the obscured starformation in this unlensed galaxy on scales of0.3$^{\prime\prime}$$\times$0.2$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$2.1$\times$1.3 kpc).the observations reveal a bright (16$\pm$1 mjy) dusty starburst centered on thecold molecular gas reservoir and showing a bar-like extension along the majoraxis. the striking anti-correlation with the hst/wfc3 imaging suggests that thecopious dust surrounding the starburst heavily obscures the rest-frameuv/optical emission. a comparison with 1.2 mm pdbi continuum data reveals noevidence for variations in the dust properties across the source within theuncertainties, consistent with extended star formation, and the peak starformation rate surface density (119$\pm$8 m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$)implies that the star formation in gn20 remains sub-eddington on scales down to3 kpc$^2$. we find that the star formation efficiency is highest in the centralregions of gn20, leading to a resolved star formation law with a power lawslope of $\sigma_{\rm sfr}$ $\sim$ $\sigma_{\rm h_2}^{\rm 2.1\pm1.0}$, and thatgn20 lies above the sequence of normal star-forming disks, implying that thedispersion in the star formation law is not due solely to morphology or choiceof conversion factor. these data extend previous evidence for a fixed starformation efficiency per free-fall time to include the star-forming medium on$\sim$kpc-scales in a galaxy 12 gyr ago.

1502.00003	a direct constraint on the gas content of a massive, passively evolving  elliptical galaxy at z = 1.43	gas and dust in star-forming galaxies at the peak epoch of galaxy assemblyare presently the topic of intense study, but little is known about theinterstellar medium (ism) of distant, passively evolving galaxies. we report ona deep 3 mm-band search with iram/pdbi for molecular (h$_2$) gas in a massive($m_{\star}{\sim}6{\times}10^{11}m_{\odot}$) elliptical galaxy at z=1.4277, thefirst observation of this kind ever attempted. we place a 3$\sigma$ upper limitof 0.32 jy km/s on the flux of the co($j$=2$\rightarrow$1) line or $l'_{\rmco}$$&lt;$8.8$\times$10$^{9}$ k km/s pc$^2$, assuming a disk-like co-morphologyand a circular velocity scaling with the stellar velocity dispersion as inlocal early-type galaxies (etgs). this translates to an h$_2$ mass of$&lt;$3.9$\times$10$^{10}$($\alpha_{\rm co}$/4.4)$m_{\odot}$ or a gas fraction of$\lesssim$6% assuming a salpeter initial mass function (imf) and an ismdominated by h$_2$, as observed in many local, high-mass ellipticals. this lowvalue approaches that of local etgs, suggesting that the low star formationactivity in massive, high-z passive galaxies reflects a true dearth of gas anda lesser role for inhibitive mechanisms like morphological quenching.

astro-ph;0201104	properties of mm galaxies: constraints from k-band blank fields	we have used the iram plateau de bure mm interferometer to locate withsubarcsecond accuracy the dust emission of three of the brightest 1.2mm sourcesin the ntt deep field (ndf) selected from our 1.2mm mambo survey at the iram30m telescope. we combine these results with deep b to k imaging and vlainterferometry. strikingly, none of the three accurately located mm galaxiesmmj120546-0741.5, mmj120539-0745.4, and mmj120517-0743.1 has a k-bandcounterpart down to the faint limit of k&gt;21.9. this implies that these threegalaxies are either extremely obscured and/or are at very high redshifts(z&gt;~4). we combine our results with literature data for 11 more (sub)mmgalaxies that are identified with similar reliability. in terms of their k-bandproperties, the sample divides into three roughly equal groups: (i) undetectedto k~22, (ii) detected in the near-infrared but not the optical and (iii)detected in the optical with the possibility of optical follow-up spectroscopy.we find a trend in this sample between near-infrared to submm and submm toradio spectral indices, which in comparison to spectral energy distributions(seds) of low redshift infrared luminous galaxies suggests that the mostplausible primary factor causing the extreme near-infrared faintness of ourobjects is their high redshift. we show that the near-infrared to radio seds ofthe sample are inconsistent with seds that resemble local far-infrared coolgalaxies with moderate luminosities, which were proposed in some models of thesubmm sky. we briefly discuss the implications of the results for ourunderstanding of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0402549	the faint counterparts of mambo mm sources near the ntt deep field	we discuss identifications for 18 sources from our mambo 1.2mm survey of theregion surrounding the ntt deep field. we have obtained accurate positions fromvery large array 1.4ghz interferometry and in a few cases iram mminterferometry, and have also made deep bvrizjk imaging at eso. we findthirteen 1.2mm sources associated with optical/near-infrared objects in themagnitude range k=19.0 to 22.5, while five are blank fields at k&gt;22. the medianredshift of the radio-identified mm sources is ~2.6 from the radio/mmestimator, and the median optical/near-infrared photometric redshifts for theobjects with counterparts ~2.1. this suggests that those radio-identified mmsources without optical/near-infrared counterparts tend to lie at higherredshifts than those with optical/near-infrared counterparts. compared topublished identifications of objects from 850micron surveys of similar depth,the median k and i magnitudes of our counterparts are roughly two magnitudesfainter and the dispersion of i-k colors is less. real differences in themedian redshifts, residual mis-identifications with bright objects, cosmicvariance, and small number statistics are likely to contribute to thissignificant difference, which also affects redshift measurement strategies. wediscuss basic properties of the near-infrared/(sub)mm/radio spectral energydistributions of our galaxies and of interferometrically identified submmsources from the literature. from a comparison with submm objects withco-confirmed spectroscopic redshifts we argue that roughly two thirds of the(sub)mm galaxies are at z&gt;~2.5. this fraction is probably larger when includingsources without radio counterparts.

astro-ph;0512466	mambo 1.2 millimeter observations of bzk-selected star-forming galaxies  at z~2	we present mambo 1.2 mm observations of five bzk-pre-selected vigorousstarburst galaxies at z~2. two of these were detected at more than 99.5%confidence levels, with 1.2 mm fluxes around 1.5 mjy. these millimeter fluxesimply vigorous activity with star-formation rates (sfrs) approx. 500-1500msun/yr, confirmed also by detections at 24 microns with the mips camera onboard of the spitzer satellite. the two detected galaxies are the ones in thesample with the highest sfrs estimated from the rest-frame uv, and theirfar-ir- and uv-derived sfrs agree reasonably well. this is different from localulirgs and high-z submm/mm selected galaxies for which the uv is reported tounderestimate sfrs by factors of 10-100, but similar to the average bzk-ulirggalaxy at z~2. the two galaxies detected at 1.2 mm are brighter in k than thetypical nir-counterparts of mambo and scuba sources, implying also asignificantly different k-band to submm/mm flux ratio. this suggests a scenarioin which z~2 galaxies, after their rapid (sub)mm brightest phase opaque tooptical/uv light, evolve into a longer lasting phase of k-band bright andmassive objects. targeting the most uv active bzks could yield substantialdetection rates at submm/mm wavelengths.

astro-ph;0612152	531 new spectroscopic redshifts from the cdfs and a test on the  cosmological relevance of the goods-south field	(abbrev.) this paper prepares a series of papers analysing the intermediatemass galaxy evolution sequence (images) up to z=1. intermediate mass galaxies(mj &lt;=-20.3) are selected from the chandra deep field south (cdfs) for which weidentify a serious lack of spectroscopically determined redshifts..... we havespectroscopically identified 691 objects including 580 gal., 7 qsos, and 104stars. this study provides 531 new redshifts in the cdfs. it confirms thepresence of several large scale structures in the cdfs. to test the impact ofthese structures in the goods-south field, we ... compare the evolution ofrest-frame u, b, v and k galaxy luminosity densities to that derived from thecfrs. the cdfs field shows a significant excess of luminosity densities in thez=0.5-0.75 range, which increases with the wavelength, reaching up to 0.5 dexat 2.1 um. stellar mass and specific star formation evolutions might besignificantly affected by the presence of the peculiar large scale structuresat z= 0.668 and at z= 0.735, that contain a significant excess of evolved,massive galaxies when compared to other fields. this leads to a clear warningto results based on the cdfs/goods south fields, especially those related tothe evolution of red luminosity densities, i.e. stellar mass density andspecific star formation rate. photometric redshift techniques, when applied tothat field, are producing quantities which are apparently less affected bycosmic variance (0.25 dex at 2.1 um), however at the cost of the difficulty indisentangling between evolutionary and cosmic variance effects.

0810.0272	images iv: strong evolution of the oxygen abundance in gaseous phases of  intermediate mass galaxies since z=0.8	intermediate mass galaxies (logm(msun)&gt;10) at z~0.6 are the likeliestprogenitors of the present-day numerous population of spirals. there is growingevidence that they have evolved rapidly since the last 6 to 8 gyr ago, andlikely have formed a significant fraction of their stellar mass, often showingperturbed morphologies and kinematics. we have gathered a representative sampleof 88 such galaxies and have provided robust estimates of their gas phasemetallicity. for doing so, we have used moderate spectral resolutionspectroscopy at vlt/fors2 with unprecedented high s/n allowing to remove biasescoming from interstellar absorption lines and extinction to establish robustvalues of r23=([oii]3727 + [oiii]4959,5007)/hbeta. we definitively confirm thatthe predominant population of z~0.6 starbursts and luminous ir galaxies (lirgs)are on average, two times less metal rich than the local galaxies at a givenstellar mass. we do find that the metal abundance of the gaseous phase ofgalaxies is evolving linearly with time, from z=1 to z=0 and after comparingwith other studies, from z=3 to z=0. combining our results with the reportedevolution of the tully fisher relation, we do find that such an evolutionrequires that ~30% of the stellar mass of local galaxies have been formedthrough an external supply of gas, thus excluding the close box model. distantstarbursts &amp; lirgs have properties (metal abundance, star formation efficiency&amp; morphologies) similar to those of local lirgs. their underlying physics islikely dominated by gas infall probably through merging or interactions. ourstudy further supports the rapid evolution of z~0.4-1 galaxies. gas exchangesbetween galaxies is likely the main cause of this evolution.

0810.2518	obscured and powerful agn and starburst activities at z~3.5	we report the discovery of two sources at z=3.867 and z=3.427 that exhibitpowerful starburst and agn activities. they benefit from data from radio to xrays from the cfhtls-d1/swire/xmds surveys. follow-up optical and near-infraredspectroscopy, and millimeter iram/mambo observations are also available. weperformed an analysis of their spectral energy distributions to understand theorigin of their emission and constrain their luminosities. a comparison withother composite systems at similar redshifts from the literature is alsopresented. the agn and starburst bolometric luminosities are ~10^13 lsun. theagn emission dominates at x ray, optical, mid-infrared wavelengths, andprobably in the radio. the starburst emission dominates in the far-infrared.the estimated star formation rates range from 500 to 3000msun/yr. the agnnear-infrared and x ray emissions are heavily obscured in both sources with anestimated dust extinction av&gt;4, and compton-thick gas column densities. the twosources are the most obscured and most luminous agns detected at millimeterwavelengths currently known. the sources presented in this work are heavilyobscured qsos, but their properties are not fully explained by the standard agnunification model. in one source, the ultraviolet and optical spectra suggestthe presence of outflowing gas and shocks, and both sources show emission fromhot dust, most likely in the vicinity of the nucleus. evidence of moderateagn-driven radio activity is found in both sources. the two sources lie on thelocal m_bh-m_bulge relation. to remain on this relation, their star formationrate has to decrease. our results support evolutionary models that invoke radiofeedback as star formation quenching mechanism, and suggest that such amechanism might play a major role also in powerful agns.

0810.3108	two bright submillimeter galaxies in a z=4.05 proto-cluster in  goods-north, and accurate radio-infrared photometric redshifts	we present the serendipitous discovery of z=4.05 molecular gas co emissionlines with the iram plateau de bure interferometer coincident with gn20 andgn20.2, two luminous submillimeter galaxies (smgs) in the great observatoriesorigins deep survey north field (goods-n). these are among the most distantsubmillimeter-selected galaxies reliably identified through co emission andalso some of the most luminous known. in terms of co to bolometricluminosities, stellar mass and star formation rates (sfrs), these newlydiscovered z&gt;4 smgs are similar to z~1.5-3 smgs studied to date. these z~4 smgshave much higher specific sfrs than typical b-band dropout lyman break galaxiesat the same redshift. the stellar mass-sfr correlation for normal galaxies doesnot seem to evolve much further, between z~2 and z~4. a significant z=4.05spectroscopic redshift spike is observed in goods-n, and a strong spatialoverdensity of b-band dropouts and irac selected z&gt;3.5 galaxies appears to becentered on the gn20 and gn20.2 galaxies. this suggests a proto-clusterstructure with total mass ~10^14 msun. using photometry at mid-ir, submm andradio wavelengths, we show that reliable photometric redshifts (dz/(1+z)~0.1)can be derived for smgs over 1&lt;z&lt;4. this new photometric redshift technique hasbeen used to provide a first estimate of the space density of 3.5&lt;z&lt;6hyper-luminous starburst galaxies, and to show that they contributesubstantially to the sfr density at early epochs. many of these high-redshiftstarbursts will be within reach of herschel. we find that the radio to mid-irflux density ratio can be used to select z&gt;3.5 starbursts, regardless of theirsubmm/mm emission [abridged].
