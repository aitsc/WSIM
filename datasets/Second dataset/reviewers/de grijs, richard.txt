0901.2047	using the minimum spanning tree to trace mass segregation	we present a new method to detect and quantify mass segregation in starclusters. it compares the minimum spanning tree (mst) of massive stars withthat of random stars. if mass segregation is present, the mst length of themost massive stars will be shorter than that of random stars. this differencecan be quantified (with an associated significance) to measure the degree ofmass segregation. we test the method on simulated clusters in both 2d and 3dand show that the method works as expected.  we apply the method to the orion nebula cluster (onc) and show that themethod is able to detect the mass segregation in the trapezium with a `masssegregation ratio' \lambda_{msr}=8.0 \pm 3.5 (where \lambda_{msr}=1 is no masssegregation) down to 16 \msun, and also that the onc is mass segregated at alower level (~2.0 \pm 0.5) down to 5 \msun. below 5 \msun we find no evidencefor any further mass segregation in the onc.

0706.1865	young massive star clusters in the era of the hubble space telescope	the hubble space telescope (hst) has been instrumental in the discovery oflarge numbers of extragalactic young massive star clusters (ymcs), oftenassumed to be proto-globular clusters (gcs). as a consequence, the field of ymcformation and evolution is thriving, generating major breakthroughs as well ascontroversies on annual (or shorter) time-scales. here, i review the long-termsurvival chances of ymcs, hallmarks of intense starburst episodes oftenassociated with violent galaxy interactions. in the absence of significantexternal perturbations, the key factor determining a cluster's long-termsurvival chances is the shape of its stellar initial mass function (imf). itis, however, not straightforward to assess the imf shape in unresolvedextragalactic ymcs. i also discuss the latest progress in worldwide efforts tobetter understand the evolution of entire cluster populations, predominantlybased on hst observations, and conclude that there is an increasing body ofevidence that gc formation appears to be continuing until today; theirlong-term evolution crucially depends on their environmental conditions,however.

0904.0674	old stellar population synthesis: new age and mass estimates for mayall  ii = g1	mayall ii = g1 is one of the most luminous globular clusters (gcs) in m31.here, we determine its age and mass by comparing multicolor photometry withtheoretical stellar population synthesis models. based on far- andnear-ultraviolet galex photometry, broad-band ubvri, and infrared jhk_s 2massdata, we construct the most extensive spectral energy distribution of g1 todate, spanning the wavelength range from 1538 to 20,000 a. a quantitativecomparison with a variety of simple stellar population (ssp) models yields amean age that is consistent with g1 being among the oldest building blocks ofm31 and having formed within ~1.7 gyr after the big bang. irrespective of thessp model or stellar initial mass function adopted, the resulting massestimates (of order $10^7 m_\odot$) indicate that g1 is one of the most massivegcs in the local group. however, we speculate that the cluster's exceptionallyhigh mass suggests that it may not be a genuine gc. we also derive that g1 maycontain, on average, $(1.65\pm0.63)\times10^2 l_\odot$ far-ultraviolet-bright,hot, extreme horizontal-branch stars, depending on the ssp model adopted. on ageneric level, we demonstrate that extensive multi-passband photometry coupledwith ssp analysis enables one to obtain age estimates for old ssps to a similaraccuracy as from integrated spectroscopy or resolved stellar photometry,provided that some of the free parameters can be constrained independently.

1009.5987	simple stellar population models including blue stragglers	observations show that nearly all star clusters and stellar populationscontain blue straggler stars (bss). bss in a cluster can significantly enhancethe integrated spectrum of the host population, preferentially at shortwavelengths, and render it much bluer in photometric colours. currenttheoretical simple stellar population (ssp) models constructed within thetraditional framework of single and binary stellar evolution cannot fullyaccount for the impact of these objects on the integrated spectral propertiesof stellar populations. using conventional ssp models without taking intoaccount bs contributions may significantly underestimate a cluster's age and/ormetallicity, simply because one has to balance the observed bluer colours (or abluer spectrum) with a younger age and/or a lower metallicity. therefore,inclusion of bs contributions in ssp models is an important and necessaryimprovement for population synthesis and its applications. here, we present anew set of ssp models, which include bs contributions based on our analysis ofindividual star clusters. the models cover the wavelength range from 91~{\aa}to 160~$\mu$m, ages from 0.1 to 20 gyr and metallicities $z=0.0004, 0.004,0.008, 0.02$ (solar) and 0.05. we use the observed integrated spectra ofseveral magellanic cloud star clusters to cross-check and validate our models.the results show that the age predictions from our models are closer to thosefrom isochrone fitting in the clusters' colour-magnitude diagrams compared toage predictions based on standard ssp models.

0710.3477	the poorly constrained cluster disruption time-scale in the large  magellanic cloud	we use monte-carlo simulations, combined with homogeneously determined ageand mass distributions based on multi-wavelength photometry, to constrain thecluster formation history and the rate of bound cluster disruption in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc) cluster system. we evolve synthetic star cluster systemsformed with a power-law initial cluster mass function (icmf) of spectral index$\alpha =-2$ assuming different cluster disruption time-scales. for each ofthese disruption time-scales we derive the corresponding cluster formation rate(cfr) required to reproduce the observed cluster age distribution. we thencompare, in a poissonian $\chi^2$ sense, model mass distributions and modeltwo-dimensional distributions in log(mass) vs. log(age) space of the detectedsurviving clusters to the observations. because of the bright detection limit($m_v^{\rm lim} \simeq -4.7$ mag) above which the observed cluster sample iscomplete, one cannot constrain the characteristic disruption time-scale for a$10^4$ m$_\odot$ cluster, $t_4^{\rm dis}$ (where the disruption time-scaledepends on cluster mass as $t_{\rm dis} = t_4^{\rm dis} (m_{\rm cl} / 10^4 {\rmm}_\odot)^0.62$), to better than $t_4^{\rm dis} \ge 1$ gyr. we conclude thatthe cfr has increased from 0.3 clusters myr$^{-1}$ 5 gyr ago, to a present rateof $(20-30)$ clusters myr$^{-1}$. for older ages the derived cfr dependssensitively on our assumption of the underlying cmf shape. if we assume auniversal gaussian icmf, then the cfr has increased steadily over a hubble timefrom $\sim 1$ cluster gyr$^{-1}$ 15 gyr ago to its present value. if the icmfhas always been a power law with a slope close to $\alpha=-2$, the cfr exhibitsa minimum some 5 gyr ago, which we tentatively identify with the well-known agegap in the lmc's cluster age distribution.

1301.1926	gravitational conundrum? dynamical mass segregation versus disruption of  binary stars in dense stellar systems	upon their formation, dynamically cool (collapsing) star clusters will,within only a few million years, achieve stellar mass segregation for starsdown to a few solar masses, simply because of gravitational two-bodyencounters. since binary systems are, on average, more massive than singlestars, one would expect them to also rapidly mass segregate dynamically.contrary to these expectations and based on high-resolution hubble spacetelescope observations, we show that the compact, 15-30 myr-old largemagellanic cloud cluster ngc 1818 exhibits tantalizing hints at the &gt;= 2 sigmalevel of significance (&gt; 3 sigma if we assume a power-law secondary-to-primarymass-ratio distribution) of an increasing fraction of f-star binary systems(with combined masses of 1.3-1.6 msun) with increasing distance from thecluster center, specifically between the inner 10 to 20" (approximatelyequivalent to the cluster's core and half-mass radii) and the outer 60 to 80".if confirmed, this will offer support of the theoretically predicted but thusfar unobserved dynamical disruption processes of the significant population of'soft' binary systems---with relatively low binding energies compared to thekinetic energy of their stellar members---in star clusters, which we haveaccess to here by virtue of the cluster's unique combination of youth and highstellar density.

1303.0338	the ngc 5253 star cluster system. i. standard modelling and  infrared-excess sources	using high-resolution hubble space telescope data, we reexamine thefundamental properties (ages, masses and extinction values) of the rich starcluster population in the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 5253. the gain inresolution compared to previous studies is of order a factor of two in bothspatial dimensions, while our accessible wavelength range transcends previousstudies by incorporation of both near-ultraviolet and near-infrared (ir)passbands. we apply spectral synthesis treatments based on two different simplestellar population model suites to our set of medium-, broad-band and h-alphaimages to gain an improved physical understanding of the ir-excess flux foundfor a subset of young clusters (30 of 149). with the caveat that our models arebased on fully sampled stellar mass functions, the ngc 5253 cluster populationis dominated by a significant number of relatively low-mass (m_cl &lt;= a few 10^4msun) objects with ages ranging from a few x 10^6 to a few x 10^7 yr, which isin excellent agreement with the starburst age of the host galaxy. the ir-excessclusters are almost all found in this young age range and have masses of up toa few x 10^4 msun. the ir excess in the relatively low-mass ngc 5253 clustersis most likely caused by a combination of stochastic sampling effects andcolour variations due to the presence of either luminous red orpre-main-sequence stars. we also find a small number of intermediate-age (~ 1gyr-old), ~10^5 msun clusters, as well as up to a dozen massive, ~10 gyr-oldglobular clusters. their presence supports the notion that ngc 5253 is a veryactive galaxy that has undergone multiple episodes of star cluster formation.

1308.3296	no compelling evidence of significant early star cluster disruption in  the large magellanic cloud	whether or not the rich star cluster population in the large magellanic cloud(lmc) is affected by significant disruption during the first few x 10^8 yr ofits evolution is an open question and the subject of significant currentdebate. here, we revisit the problem, adopting a homogeneous data set ofbroad-band imaging observations. we base our analysis mainly on two sets ofself-consistently determined lmc cluster ages and masses, one using standardmodelling and one which takes into account the effects of stochasticity in theclusters' stellar mass functions. on their own, the results based on any of thethree complementary analysis approaches applied here are merely indicative ofthe physical conditions governing the cluster population. however, thecombination of our results from all three different diagnostics leaves littleroom for any conclusion other than that the optically selected lmc star clusterpopulation exhibits no compelling evidence of significant disruption -- forclusters with masses, m_cl, of log(m_cl/m_sun) &gt;= 3.0-3.5 -- between the ageranges of [3-10] myr and [30-100] myr, either "infant mortality" or otherwise.in fact, there is no evidence of any destruction beyond that expected fromsimple models just including stellar dynamics and stellar evolution for ages upto 1 gyr. it seems, therefore, that the difference in environmental conditionsin the magellanic clouds on the one hand and significantly more massivegalaxies on the other may be the key to understanding the apparent variationsin cluster disruption behaviour at early times.

1310.1085	consequences of dynamical disruption and mass segregation for the binary  frequencies of star clusters	the massive (13,000-26,000 msolar), young (15-30 myr) large magellanic cloudstar cluster ngc 1818 reveals an unexpected increasing binary frequency withradius for f-type stars (1.3-2.2 msolar). this is in contrast to many olderstar clusters that show a decreasing binary frequency with radius. we studythis phenomenon with sophisticated n-body modeling, exploring a range ofinitial conditions, from smooth virialized density distributions to highlysubstructured and collapsing configurations. we find that many of these modelscan reproduce the cluster's observed properties, although with a modestpreference for substructured initial conditions. our models produce theobserved radial trend in binary frequency through disruption of soft binaries(with semi-major axes, a &gt; 3000 au), on approximately a crossing time (~ 5.4myr), preferentially in the cluster core. mass segregation subsequently causesthe binaries to sink towards the core. after roughly one initial half-massrelaxation time (t_rh(0) ~ 340 myr) the radial binary frequency distributionbecomes bimodal, the innermost binaries having already segregated towards thecore, leaving a minimum in the radial binary frequency distribution thatmarches outwards with time. after 4-6 t_rh(0), the rising distribution in thehalo disappears, leaving a radial distribution that rises only towards thecore. thus, both a radial binary frequency distribution that falls towards thecore (as observed for ngc 1818) and one that rises towards the core (as forolder star clusters) can arise naturally from the same evolutionary sequenceowing to binary disruption and mass segregation in rich star clusters.

1412.5368	the exclusion of a significant range of ages in a massive star cluster	stars spend most of their lifetimes on the main sequence in thehertzsprung--russell diagram. the extended main-sequence turn-off regions --containing stars leaving the main sequence after having spent all of thehydrogen in their cores -- found in massive (more than a few tens of thousandsof solar masses), intermediate-age (about one to three billion years old) starclusters are usually interpreted as evidence of cluster-internal age spreads ofmore than 300 million years, although young clusters are thought to quicklylose any remaining star-forming fuel following a period of rapid gas expulsionon timescales of order $10^7$ years. here we report that the stars beyond themain sequence in the two billion-year-old cluster ngc 1651, characterized by amass of $\sim 1.7 \times 10^5$ solar masses, can be explained only by asingle-age stellar population, even though the cluster has clearly extendedmain-sequence turn-off region. the most plausible explanation for the extendedmain-sequence turn-offs invokes the presence of a population of rapidlyrotating stars, although the secondary effects of the prolonged stellarlifetimes associated with such a stellar-population mixture are as yet poorlyunderstood. from preliminary analysis of previously obtained data, we find thatsimilar morphologies are apparent in the hertzsprung--russell diagrams of atleast five additional intermediate-age star clusters, suggesting that anextended main-sequence turn-off does not necessarily imply the presence of asignificant cinternal age dispersion.

1503.05198	different dynamical ages for the two young and coeval lmc star clusters  ngc 1805 and ngc 1818 imprinted on their binary populations	the two large magellanic cloud star clusters ngc 1805 and ngc 1818 areapproximately the same chronological age (~30 myr), but show different radialtrends in binary frequency. the f-type stars (1.3 - 2.2 msun) in ngc 1818 havea binary frequency that decreases towards the core, while the binary frequencyfor stars of similar mass in ngc 1805 is flat with radius, or perhaps bimodal(with a peak in the core). we show here, through detailed n-body modeling, thatboth clusters could have formed with the same primordial binary frequency andwith binary orbital elements and masses drawn from the same distributions(defined from observations of open clusters and the field of our galaxy). theobserved radial trends in binary frequency for both clusters are best matchedwith models that have initial substructure. furthermore, both clusters may beevolving along a very similar dynamical sequence, with the key difference thatngc 1805 is dynamically older than ngc 1818. the f-type binaries in ngc 1818still show evidence of an initial period of rapid dynamical disruptions (whichoccur preferentially in the core), while ngc 1805 has already begun to recovera higher core binary frequency, owing to mass segregation (which willeventually produce a distribution in binary frequency that rises only towardsthe core, as is observed in old milky way star clusters). this recovery rateincreases for higher-mass binaries, and therefore even at one age in onecluster, we predict a similar dynamical sequence in the radial distribution ofthe binary frequency as a function of binary primary mass.

1510.00099	the dynamical importance of binary systems in young massive star  clusters	characterization of the binary fractions in star clusters is of fundamentalimportance for many fields in astrophysics. observations indicate that themajority of stars are found in binary systems, while most stars with massesgreater than $0.5 m_\odot$ are formed in star clusters. in addition, sincebinaries are on average more massive than single stars, in resolved starclusters these systems are thought to be good tracers of (dynamical) masssegregation. over time, dynamical evolution through two-body relaxation willcause the most massive objects to migrate to the cluster center, while therelatively lower-mass objects remain in or migrate to orbits at greater radii.this process will globally dominate a cluster's stellar distribution. however,close encounters involving binary systems may disrupt `soft' binaries. thisprocess will occur more frequently in a cluster's central, dense region than inits periphery, which may mask the effects of mass segregation. using highresolution hubble space telescope observations, combined with sophisticated$n$-body simulations, we investigate the radial distributions of themain-sequence binary fractions in massive young large magellanic cloud starclusters. we show that binary disruption may play an important role on veryshort timescales, depending on the environmental conditions in the clustercores. this may lead to radial binary fractions that initially decline in thecluster centers, which is contrary to the effects expected from dynamical masssegregation.

1511.00835	iau commission 37 "star clusters and associations" legacy report	it is widely accepted that stars do not form in isolation but result from thefragmentation of molecular clouds, which in turn leads to star clusterformation. over time, clusters dissolve or are destroyed by interactions withmolecular clouds or tidal stripping, and their members become part of thegeneral field population. star clusters are thus among the basic buildingblocks of galaxies. in turn, star cluster populations, from young associationsand open clusters to old globulars, are powerful tracers of the formation,assembly, and evolutionary history of their parent galaxies. although theirimportance had been recognised for decades, major progress in this area hasonly become possible in recent years, both for galactic and extragalacticcluster populations. star clusters are the observational foundation for stellarastrophysics and evolution, provide essential tracers of galactic structure,and are unique stellar dynamical environments. star formation, stellarstructure, stellar evolution, and stellar nucleosynthesis continue to benefitand improve tremendously from the study of these systems. additionally,fundamental quantities such as the initial mass function can be successfullyderived from modelling either the h-r diagrams or the integrated velocitystructures of, respectively, resolved and unresolved clusters and clusterpopulations. star cluster studies thus span the fields of galactic andextragalactic astrophysics, while heavily affecting our detailed understandingof the process of star formation in dense environments.this report highlightsscience results of the last decade in the major fields covered by iaucommission 37: star clusters and associations.

astro-ph;0211494	uv-optical pixel maps of face-on spiral galaxies -- clues for dynamics  and star formation histories	uv and optical images of the face-on spiral galaxies ngc 6753 and ngc 6782reveal regions of strong on-going star formation that are associated withstructures traced by the old stellar populations. we make nuv--(nuv-i) pixelcolor-magnitude diagrams (pcmds) that reveal plumes of pixels with stronglyvarying nuv surface brightness and nearly constant i surface brightness. theplumes correspond to sharply bounded radial ranges, with (nuv-i) at a given nuvsurface brightness being bluer at larger radii. the plumes are parallel to thereddening vector and simple model mixtures of young and old populations, thusneither reddening nor the fraction of the young population can produce theobserved separation between the plumes. the images, radial surface-brightness,and color plots indicate that the separate plumes are caused by sharp declinesin the surface densities of the old populations at radii corresponding to diskresonances. the maximum surface brightness of the nuv light remains nearlyconstant with radius, while the maximum i surface brightness declines sharplywith radius. an muv image of ngc 6782 shows emission from the nuclear ring. thedistribution of points in an (muv-nuv) vs. (nuv-i) pixel color-color diagram isbroadly consistent with the simple mixture model, but shows a residual trendthat the bluest pixels in (muv-nuv) are the reddest pixels in (nuv-i). this maybe due to a combination of red continuum from late-type supergiants and [siii]emission lines associated with hii regions in active star-forming regions. wehave shown that pixel mapping is a powerful tool for studying the distributionand strength of on-going star formation in galaxies. deep, multi-color imagingcan extend this to studies of extinction, and the ages and metallicities ofcomposite stellar populations in nearby galaxies.

astro-ph;0308232	star formation in extreme starburst environments - "super" star clusters	the currently available empirical evidence on the star formation processes inthe extreme, high-pressure environments induced by galaxy encounters, mostlybased on high-resolution hubble space telescope imaging observations, stronglysuggests that star cluster formation is an important and perhaps even thedominant mode of star formation in the starburst events associated with galaxyinteractions.  the production of "super star clusters" (sscs; luminous, compact starclusters) seems to be a hallmark of intense star formation, particularly ininteracting and starburst galaxies. their sizes, luminosities, and massestimates are entirely consistent with what is expected for young milkyway-type globular clusters (gcs). sscs are important because of what they cantell us about gc formation and evolution (e.g., initial characteristics andearly survival rates). they are also of prime importance as probes of theformation and (chemical) evolution of their host galaxies, and of the initialmass function in the extreme environments required for cluster formation.recent evidence lends support to the scenario that milky way-type gcs (althoughmore metal rich), which were once thought to be the oldest building blocks ofgalaxies, are still forming today.

astro-ph;0511305	how well do we know the age and mass distributions of the star cluster  system in the large magellanic cloud?	[abridged] the lmc star cluster system offers the unique opportunity toindependently check the accuracy of age and mass determinations based on anumber of complementary techniques, including isochrone analysis. using oursophisticated tool for star cluster analysis based on broad-band spectralenergy distributions (seds), we reanalyse the hunter et al. (2003) lmc clusterphotometry. our main aim is to set the tightest limits yet on the accuracy ofabsolute age determinations based on broad-band seds, and therefore on theusefulness of such an approach. our broad-band sed fits yield reliable ages,with statistical absolute uncertainties within delta[log(age/yr)] = 0.4overall. the systematic differences we find with respect to previous agedeterminations are caused by conversions of the observational photometry to adifferent filter system. the lmc's cluster formation rate (cfr) has beenroughly constant outside of the well-known age gap between ~3 and 13 gyr, whenthe cfr was a factor of ~5 lower. we derive the characteristic clusterdisruption time-scale, log(t_4^dis/yr) = 9.9 +- 0.1, where t_dis = t_4^dis(m_cl/10^4 msun)^0.62. this long characteristic disruption time-scale impliesthat we are observing the initial cluster mass function (cmf). we conclude thatthe youngest mass and luminosity-limited lmc cluster subsets show shallowerslopes than the slope of alpha = -2 expected (at least below masses of a few x10^3 msun), which is contrary to dynamical expectations. this may imply thatthe initial cmf slope of the lmc cluster system as a whole is not wellrepresented by a power-law, although we cannot disentangle the unbound from thebound clusters at the youngest ages.

astro-ph;0601606	the photometric evolution of dissolving star clusters i: first  predictions	we calculated the broad-band photometric evolution of unresolved starclusters, including the preferential loss of low-mass stars due to masssegregation. the stellar mass function of a cluster evolves due to threeeffects: (a) the evolution of massive stars; (b) early tidal effects reduce themass function independently of the stellar mass; (c) after mass segregation hascompleted, tidal effects preferentially remove the lowest-mass stars from thecluster. results: (1) during the first ~40% of the lifetime of a cluster thecluster simply gets fainter due to the loss of stars by tidal effects. (2)between ~40 and ~80% of its lifetime the cluster gets bluer due to the loss oflow-mass stars. this will result in an underestimate of the age of clusters ifstandard cluster evolution models are used (0.15 -- 0.5 dex). (3) after ~80% ofthe total lifetime of a cluster it will rapidly get redder. this is becausestars at the low-mass end of the main sequence, which are preferentially lost,are bluer than the agb stars that dominate the light at long wavelengths,resulting in an age overestimate. (4) clusters with mass segregation and thepreferential loss of low-mass stars evolve along almost the same tracks incolour-colour diagrams as clusters without mass segregation. therefore it willbe difficult to distinguish this effect from that due to the cluster age forunresolved clusters, unless the total lifetime of the clusters can beestimated. (5) the changes in the colour evolution of unresolved clusters dueto the preferential loss of low-mass stars will affect the determination of thesfhs. (6) the preferential loss of low-mass stars might explain the presence ofold (~13 gyr) clusters in ngc 4365 which are photometrically disguised asintermediate-age clusters (2 - 5 gyr). [abridged]

astro-ph;0606492	diffuse, non-thermal x-ray emission from the galactic star cluster  westerlund 1	we present the diffuse x-ray emission identified in chandra observations ofthe young, massive galactic star cluster westerlund 1. after removingpoint-like x-ray sources down to a completeness limit of 2e31 erg/s, weidentify 3e34 erg/s (2--8 kev) of diffuse emission. the spatial distribution ofthe emission can be described as a slightly-elliptical lorentzian core with ahalf-width half-maximum along the major axis of 25+/-1", similar to thedistribution of point sources in the cluster, plus a 5' halo of extendedemission. the spectrum of the diffuse emission is dominated by a hard continuumcomponent that can be described as a kt&gt;3 kev thermal plasma that has a lowiron abundance (&lt;0.3 solar), or as non-thermal emission that could be stellarlight that is inverse-compton scattered by mev electrons. only 5% of the fluxis produced by a kt=0.7 kev plasma. the low luminosity of the thermal emissionand the lack of a 6.7 kev iron line suggests that &lt;40,000 unresolved stars withmasses between 0.3 and 2 msun are present in the cluster. moreover, the flux inthe diffuse emission is a factor of two lower than would be expected from asupersonically-expanding cluster wind, and there is no evidence for thermalremnants produced by supernovae. less than 1e-5 of the mechanical luminosity ofthe cluster is dissipated as 2--8 kev x-rays, leaving a large amount of energythat either is radiated at other wavelengths, is dissipated beyond the boundsof our image, or escapes into the intergalactic medium.

astro-ph;0609786	arp 116: interacting system or chance alignment?	using high spatial resolution hubble space telescope/advanced camera forsurveys archival imaging observations of arp 116, centred on the ellipticalgalaxy ngc 4649, we explore the novel technique of pixel-by-pixel analysis ofthe galaxy's colour-magnitude diagramme to search for any evidence of recentenhanced star formation due to the apparent tidal interaction with its spiralcompanion, ngc 4647. from a detailed analysis of the system's geometry, andbased on additional circumstantial evidence from extant multi-wavelengthobservations, we conclude that, while there may be grounds for thetidal-interaction assumption for this system, any interaction has thus far beenof insufficient strength to trigger an enhanced level of recent star formationin the elliptical component, although close inspection of our colour imagesshows a faint excess of bluer pixels (a ~0.20 mag bluer "loop") in theelliptical galaxy on the side of the spiral companion. given that there appearsto be a moderate reservoir of available gas for ongoing star formation(although at low column density), this suggests that we are currentlywitnessing the onset of the tidal interaction between ngc 4647 and ngc 4649. inaddition, the triggering of new star formation in ngc 4649 may be significantlyimpeded due to the much lower mass of the spiral component.

astro-ph;0702337	the long-term survival chances of young massive star clusters	we review the long-term survival chances of young massive star clusters(ymcs), hallmarks of intense starburst episodes often associated with violentgalaxy interactions. we address the key question as to whether at least some ofthese ymcs can be considered proto-globular clusters (gcs), in which case thesewould be expected to evolve into counterparts of the ubiquitous old gcsbelieved to be among the oldest galactic building blocks. in the absence ofsignificant external perturbations, the key factor determining a cluster'slong-term survival chances is the shape of its stellar initial mass function(imf). it is, however, not straightforward to assess the imf shape inunresolved extragalactic ymcs. we discuss in detail the promise of usinghigh-resolution spectroscopy to make progress towards this goal, as well as thenumerous pitfalls associated with this approach. we also discuss the latestprogress in worldwide efforts to better understand the evolution of entirecluster systems, the disruption processes they are affected by, and whether wecan use recently gained insights to determine the nature of at least some ofthe ymcs observed in extragalactic starbursts as proto-gcs. we conclude thatthere is an increasing body of evidence that gc formation appears to becontinuing until today; their long-term evolution crucially depends on theirenvironmental conditions, however.

astro-ph;9911415	tracing the vertical composition of disc galaxies through colour  gradients	(abbreviated) optical observations of a statistically complete sample ofedge-on disc galaxies are used to study the intrinsic vertical colour gradientsin the galactic discs, to constrain the effects of population gradients,residual dust extinction and gradients in the galaxies' metal abundance. itappears that the intrinsic vertical colour gradients are either non-existent,or small and relatively constant as a function of position along the galaxies'major axes. our results are consistent with the absence of any vertical colourgradient in the discs of the early-type sample galaxies. in most galaxiessmall-scale variations in the magnitude and even the direction of the verticalgradient are observed: at larger galactocentric distances they generallydisplay redder colours with increasing z height, whereas the opposite is oftenobserved in and near the galactic centres. for a significant fraction of oursample galaxies another mechanism in addition to the effects of stellarpopulation gradients is required to explain the magnitude of the observedgradients. the non-zero colour gradients in a significant fraction of oursample galaxies are likely (at least) partially due to residual dust extinctionat these z heights, as is also evidenced from the sometimes significantdifferences between the vertical colour gradients measured on either side ofthe galactic planes. we suggest that initial vertical metallicity gradients, ifany, have likely not been accentuated by accretion or merging events over thelifetimes of our sample galaxies. on the other hand, they may have weakened anyexisting vertical metallicity gradients, although they also may have left theexisting correlations unchanged.

0811.4035	a new diagnostic method for assessment of stellar stratification in star  clusters	we propose a new method for the characterization of stellar stratification instellar systems. the method uses the mean-square radius (also called thespitzer radius) of the system as a diagnostic tool. an estimate of theobservable counterpart of this radius for stars of different magnitude rangesis used as the effective radius of each stellar species in a star cluster. weexplore the dependence of these radii on magnitude as a possible indication ofstellar stratification. this method is the first of its kind to use adynamically stable radius, and though seemingly trivial it has never beenapplied before. we test the proposed method using model star clusters, whichare constructed to be segregated on the basis of a monte carlo technique, andon hubble space telescope observations of mass-segregated star clusters inorder to explore the limitations of the method in relation to actual data. weconclude that the method performs efficiently in the detection of stellarstratification and its results do not depend on the data, provided thatincompleteness has been accurately measured and the contamination by the fieldpopulation has been thoroughly removed. our diagnosis method is alsoindependent of any model or theoretical prediction, in contrast to the`classical' methods used so far for the detection of mass segregation.
