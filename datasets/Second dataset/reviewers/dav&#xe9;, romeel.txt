0901.0286	tracing the reionization-epoch intergalactic medium with metal  absorption lines	igm metal absorption lines observed in z&gt;6 spectra offer the opportunity toprobe early feedback processes, the nature of enriching sources, and thetopology of reionization. we run high-resolution cosmological simulationsincluding galactic outflows to study the observability and physical propertiesof 5 ions (c ii, c iv, o i, si ii, si iv) in absorption between z=8-&gt;5. weapply three cases for ionization conditions: fully neutral, fully reionized,and a patchy model based on the flux from the nearest galaxy. we find that oursimulations broadly fit available z~5-6 igm metal-line data, although allobservations cannot be accommodated with a single ionization condition.variations in o i absorbers among sight lines seen by becker et al. (2006)suggest significant neutral igm patches down to z~6. strong c iv absorbers atz~6 may be the result of ionization by their parent galaxy. our outflows havetypical speeds of ~200 km/s and mass loading factors of ~6. such high massloading is critical for enriching the igm to the observed levels whilecurtailing star formation to match the observed z~6 rest-frame uv luminosityfunction. the volume filling factor of metals increases during this epoch, butonly reaches ~1% for z&gt;10^(-3) zsolar by z=5. c iv is an ideal tracer of igmmetals at z~5-6, with dropping global ionization fractions to either higher orlower redshifts. this results in a strongly increasing global omega(c iv) fromz=8-&gt;5, in contrast to its relative constancy from z=5-&gt;2. our simulations donot support widespread early igm enrichment from e.g. pop iii stars. high-zabsorbers arise from metals on their first outward journey from galaxies, atdistances less than 50 kpc. the galaxies responsible for early igm enrichmenthave typical m*=10^(7.0-8.5) msolar.

0901.3149	missing halo baryons and galactic outflows	we present predictions for galactic halo baryon fractions from cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulations with a well-constrained model for galactic outflows.without outflows, halos contain roughly the cosmic fraction of baryons,slightly lowered at high masses owing to pressure support from hot gas. thestar formation efficiency is large and increases monotonically to low masses,in disagreement with data. with outflows, the baryon fraction is increasinglysuppressed in halos to lower masses. a milky way-sized halo at z=0 has about60% of the cosmic fraction of baryons, so "missing" halo baryons have largelybeen evacuated, rather than existing in some hidden form. large halos (&gt;10^13mo) contain 85% of their cosmic share of baryons, which explains the mildmissing baryon problem seen in clusters. by comparing results at z=3 and z=0,we show that most of the baryon removal occurs at early epochs in larger halos,while smaller halos lose baryons more recently. star formation efficiency ismaximized in halos of ~10^13 mo, dropping significantly to lower masses, whichhelps reconcile the sub-l* slope of the observed stellar and halo massfunctions. these trends are predominantly driven by differential windrecycling, namely, that wind material takes longer to return to low-massgalaxies than high-mass galaxies. the hot gas content of halos is mostlyunaffected by outflows, showing that outflows tend to blow holes and escaperather than deposit their energy into halo gas.

0903.3971	astronomical software wants to be free: a manifesto	astronomical software is now a fact of daily life for all hands-on members ofour community. purpose-built software for data reduction and modeling tasksbecomes ever more critical as we handle larger amounts of data and simulations.however, the writing of astronomical software is unglamorous, the rewards arenot always clear, and there are structural disincentives to releasing softwarepublicly and to embedding it in the scientific literature, which can lead tosignificant duplication of effort and an incomplete scientific record. weidentify some of these structural disincentives and suggest a variety ofapproaches to address them, with the goals of raising the quality ofastronomical software, improving the lot of scientist-authors, and providingbenefits to the entire community, analogous to the benefits provided by openaccess to large survey and simulation datasets. our aim is to open aconversation on how to move forward. we advocate that: (1) the astronomicalcommunity consider software as an integral and fundable part of facilityconstruction and science programs; (2) that software release be considered asintegral to the open and reproducible scientific process as are publication anddata release; (3) that we adopt technologies and repositories for releasing andcollaboration on software that have worked for open-source software; (4) thatwe seek structural incentives to make the release of software and relatedpublications easier for scientist-authors; (5) that we consider new ways offunding the development of grass-roots software; (6) and that we rethink ourvalues to acknowledge that astronomical software development is not just atechnical endeavor, but a fundamental part of our scientific practice.

0907.0704	lyman-alpha emission from cosmic structure i: fluorescence	we present predictions for the fluorescent lyman-alpha emission signaturearising from photoionized, optically thick structures in smoothed particlehydrodynamic (sph) cosmological simulations of a lambda-cdm universe using amonte carlo lyman-alpha radiative transfer code. we calculate the expectedlyman-alpha image and 2-dimensional spectra for gas exposed to a uniformultraviolet ionizing background as well as gas exposed additionally to thephotoionizing radiation from a local quasar, after correcting for theself-shielding of hydrogen. as a test of our numerical methods and forapplication to current observations, we examine simplified analytic structuresthat are uniformly or anisotropically illuminated. we compare these resultswith recent observations. we discuss future observing campaigns on largetelescopes and realistic strategies for detecting fluorescence owing to theambient metagalactic ionization and in regions close to bright quasars. whileit will take hundreds of hours on the current generation of telescopes todetect fluorescence caused by the ultraviolet background (uvb) alone, ourcalculations suggest that of order ten sources of quasar-induced fluorescentlyman-alpha emission should be detectable after a 10 hour exposure in a 10arcmin^2 field around a bright quasar. these observations will help probe thephysical conditions in the densest regions of the intergalactic medium as wellas the temporal light curves and isotropy of quasar radiation.

0909.4078	the nature of sub-millimetre galaxies in cosmological hydrodynamic  simulations	we study the nature of rapidly star-forming galaxies at z=2 in cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulations, and compare their properties to observations ofsub-millimetre galaxies (smgs). we identify simulated smgs as the most rapidlystar-forming systems that match the observed number density of smgs. in ourmodels, smgs are massive galaxies sitting at the centres of large potentialwells, being fed by smooth infall and gas-rich satellites at rates comparableto their star formation rates (sfr). they are not typically undergoing majormergers that significantly boost their quiescent sfr, but they still often showcomplex gas morphologies and kinematics. our simulated smgs have stellar massesof log m*/mo~11-11.7, sfrs of ~180-500 mo/yr, a clustering length of 10 mpc/h,and solar metallicities. the sfrs are lower than those inferred from far-irdata by a factor of 3, which we suggest may owe to one or more systematiceffects in the sfr calibrations. smgs at z=2 live in ~10^13 mo halos, and byz=0 they mostly end up as brightest group galaxies in ~10^14 mo halos. wepredict that higher-m* smgs should have on average lower specific sfrs, lessdisturbed morphologies, and higher clustering. we also predict that deeperfar-ir surveys will smoothly join smgs onto the massive end of the sfr-m*relationship defined by lower-mass z=2 galaxies. overall, our simulated rapidstar-formers provide as good a match to available smg data as merger-basedscenarios, offering an alternative scenario that emerges naturally fromcosmological simulations.

0910.0250	pressure support vs. thermal broadening in the lyman-alpha forest ii:  effects of the equation of state on transverse structure	we examine the impact of gas pressure on the transverse coherence ofhigh-redshift (2 &lt;= z &lt;= 4) lyman-alpha forest absorption along neighboringlines of sight that probe the gas jeans scale (projected separation delta r &lt;=500 kpc/h comoving; angular separation delta theta &lt;= 30"). we comparepredictions from two smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations thathave different photoionization heating rates and thus differenttemperature-density relations in the intergalactic medium (igm). we alsocompare spectra computed from the gas distributions to those computed from thepressureless dark matter. the coherence along neighboring sightlines ismarkedly higher for the hotter, higher pressure simulation, and lower for thedark matter spectra. we quantify this coherence using the fluxcross-correlation function and the conditional distribution of flux decrementsas a function of transverse and line-of-sight (velocity) separation. sightlinesseparated by delta theta &lt;= 15" are ideal for probing this transversecoherence. higher pressure decreases the redshift-space anisotropy of the fluxcorrelation function, while higher thermal broadening increases the anisotropy.in contrast to the longitudinal (line-of-sight) structure of the lya forest,the transverse structure on these scales is dominated by pressure effectsrather than thermal broadening. with the rapid recent growth in the number ofknown close quasar pairs, paired line-of-sight observations offer a promisingnew route to probe the igm temperature-density relation and test theunexpectedly high temperatures that have been inferred from single sightlineanalyses.

0910.0256	pressure support vs. thermal broadening in the lyman-alpha forest i:  effects of the equation of state on longitudinal structure	in the low density intergalactic medium (igm) that gives rise to thelyman-alpha forest, gas temperature and density are tightly correlated. thevelocity scale of thermal broadening and the hubble flow across the gas jeansscale are of similar magnitude (hlambda_j ~ sigma_th). to separate the effectsof gas pressure support and thermal broadening on the lya forest, we comparespectra extracted from two smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulationsevolved with different photoionization heating rates (and thus different jeansscales), imposing different temperature-density relations on the evolvedparticle distributions. the turnover scales in the flux power spectrum and fluxautocorrelation function are determined mainly by thermal broadening ratherthan pressure. however, the insensitivity to pressure arises partly from acancellation effect with a sloped temperature-density relation (t ~ rho^{0.6}in our simulations): the high density peaks in the colder, lower pressuresimulation are less smoothed by pressure support than in the hotter simulation,and it is this higher density gas that experiences the strongest thermalbroadening. changes in thermal broadening and pressure support have comparablyimportant effects on the flux probability distribution (pdf), which respondsdirectly to the gas overdensity distribution rather than the scale on which itis smooth. tests on a lower resolution simulation show that our statisticalresults are converged even at this lower resolution. while thermal broadeninggenerally dominates the longitudinal structure in the lya forest, we show inpaper ii that pressure support determines the transverse coherence of theforest observed towards close quasar pairs.

0912.0519	feedback and recycled wind accretion: assembling the z=0 galaxy mass  function	we analyse cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that includeobservationally-constrained prescriptions for galactic outflows. if thesesimulated winds accurately represent winds in the real universe, then materialpreviously ejected in winds provides the dominant source of gas infall for newstar formation at redshifts z&lt;1. this recycled wind accretion, or wind mode,provides a third physically distinct accretion channel in addition to the "hot"and "cold" modes emphasised in recent theoretical studies. because of theinteraction between outflows and gas in and around halos, the recyclingtimescale of wind material (t_rec) is shorter in higher-mass systems, whichreside in denser gaseous environments. in these simulations, this differentialrecycling plays a central role in shaping the present-day galaxy stellar massfunction (gsmf). if we remove all particles that were ever ejected in a wind,then the predicted gsmfs are much steeper than observed; galaxy masses aresuppressed both by the direct removal of gas and by the hydrodynamic heating oftheir surroundings, which reduces subsequent infall. with wind recyclingincluded, the simulation that incorporates our favoured momentum-driven windscalings reproduces the observed gsmf for stellar masses 10^9 &lt; m &lt; 5x10^10msolar. at higher masses, wind recycling leads to excessive galaxy masses andexcessive star formation rates relative to observations. in these massivesystems, some quenching mechanism must suppress the re-accretion of gas ejectedfrom star-forming galaxies. in short, as has long been anticipated, the form ofthe gsmf is governed by outflows; the unexpected twist here for our simulatedwinds is that it is not primarily the ejection of material but how the ejectedmaterial is re-accreted that governs the gsmf.

1005.2421	the intergalactic medium over the last 10 billion years i: lyman alpha  absorption and physical conditions	the intergalactic medium (igm) is the dominant reservoir of baryons at allcosmic epochs. we investigate the evolution of the igm from z=2-0 in 48 mpc/h,110-million particle cosmological hydrodynamic simulations using threeprescriptions for galactic outflows. we focus on the evolution of igm physicalproperties, and how such properties are traced by ly-alpha absorption asdetectable using hst/cos. our results broadly confirm the canonical picturethat most ly-alpha absorbers arise from highly ionized gas tracing filamentarylarge-scale structure. growth of structure causes gas to move from the diffusephotoionized igm into other cosmic phases, namely stars, cold and hot gaswithin galaxy halos, and the unbound and shock-heated warm-hot intergalacticmedium (whim). by today, baryons are roughly equally divided between boundphases (35%), the diffuse igm (41%), and the whim (24%). here we (re)define thewhim as gas with overdensities lower than that in halos and temperatures &gt;10^5k, in order to more closely align it with "missing baryons". when we tune ourphotoionizing background to match the observed evolution of the ly-alpha meanflux decrement, we obtain a line count evolution that broadly agrees withavailable data. we predict a column density distribution slope of -1.70 for ourfavored momentum-driven wind model, in agreement with recent observations, andit becomes shallower with redshift. with improved statistics, the frequency ofstrong lines can be a valuable diagnostic of outflows, and our favored windmodel matches existing data best among our models. the relationship betweencolumn density and physical density is fairly tight from z=2-0, and evolves asrho n_hi^0.74 10^(-0.37z) for diffuse absorbers. linewidths only looselyreflect the temperature of the absorbing gas, which will hamper attempts toquantify the whim using broad ly-alpha absorbers.

1005.4066	smoothly-rising star formation histories during the reionization epoch	cosmological hydrodynamic simulations robustly predict that high-redshiftgalaxy star formation histories (sfhs) are smoothly-rising and vary with massonly by a scale factor. we use our latest simulations to test whether thisscenario can account for recent observations at z&gt;=6 from wfc3/ir, nicmos, andirac. our simulations broadly reproduce the observed ultraviolet (uv)luminosity functions and stellar mass densities and their evolution at z=6-8,all of which are nontrivial tests of the mean sfh. in agreement withobservations, simulated galaxies possess blue uv continua owing to young ages(50-150 myr), low metallicities (0.1-0.5 zsun), and low dust columns (e(b-v) &lt;=0.05). observations imply a near-unity slope in the stellar mass--starformation rate relation at all z=6-8, confirming the prediction that sfh shapesare invariant. current surveys detect the majority of galaxies with stellarmasses exceeding 10^9 msun and few galaxies less massive than 10^{8.5} msun,implying that they probe no more than the brightest 30% of the complete starformation and stellar mass densities at z&gt;=6. finally, we demonstrate thatthere is no conflict between smoothly-rising sfhs and recent clusteringobservations. this is because momentum-driven outflows suppress star formationin low-mass halos, leading to overall occupancies of 0.2-0.4 even though thestar formation duty cycle is one. this leads to many interesting predictions atz&gt;=4, among them that (1) optically-selected and uv-selected samples largelyoverlap; (2) few galaxies exhibit significantly suppressed specific starformation rates; and (3) occupancy is constant or increasing with decreasingluminosity. these predictions are in tentative agreement with currentobservations, but further analysis of existing and upcoming data sets isrequired in order to test them more thoroughly.

1005.4406	intergalactic dust extinction in hydrodynamic cosmological simulations	recently menard et al. detected a subtle but systematic change in the meancolor of quasars as a function of their projected separation from foregroundgalaxies, extending to comoving separations of ~10mpc/h, which they interpretas a signature of reddening by intergalactic dust. we present theoreticalmodels of this remarkable observation, using sph cosmological simulations of a(50mpc/h)^3 volume. our primary model uses a simulation with galactic winds andassumes that dust traces the intergalactic metals. the predicted galaxy-dustcorrelation function is similar in form to the galaxy-mass correlationfunction, and reproducing the msfr data requires a dust-to-metal mass ratio of0.24, about half the value in the galactic ism. roughly half of the reddeningarises in dust that is more than 100kpc/h from the nearest massive galaxy. wealso examine a simulation with no galactic winds, which predicts a much smallerfraction of intergalactic metals (3% vs. 35%) and therefore requires anunphysical dust-to-metal ratio of 2.18 to reproduce the msfr data. in bothmodels, the signal is dominated by sightlines with e(g-i)=0.001-0.1. theno-wind simulation can be reconciled with the data if we also allow reddeningto arise in galaxies up to several x 10^10 msun. the wind model predicts a meanvisual extinction of a_v ~0.0133 mag out to z=0.5, with asightline-to-sightline dispersion similar to the mean, which could besignificant for future supernova cosmology studies. reproducing the msfrresults in these simulations requires that a large fraction of ism dust surviveits expulsion from galaxies and its residence in the intergalactic medium.future observational studies that provide higher precision and measure thedependence on galaxy type and environment will allow detailed tests for modelsof enriched galactic outflows and the survival of ig dust.

1008.2776	strong field-to-field variation of lyman alpha nebulae populations at  z~2.3	understanding the nature of distant ly-alpha nebulae ("blobs") and connectingthem to their present-day descendants requires constraining their numberdensity, clustering, and large-scale environment. to measure these basicquantities, we conduct a deep narrowband imaging survey in four differentfields, chandra deep field south (cdfs), chandra deep field north, and twocosmos subfields, for a total survey area of 1.2deg^2. we discover 25 blobs atz=2.3 with ly-alpha luminosities of 0.7-8x10^43 erg/s and isophotal areas ofaiso = 10-60 arcsec^2. the transition from compact ly-alpha emitters (aiso ~ afew arcsec^2) to extended blobs (aiso &gt; 10 arcsec^2) is continuous, suggestinga single family perhaps governed by similar emission mechanisms. surprisingly,most blobs (16/25) are in one survey field, the cdfs. the six brightest,largest blobs with l &gt; 1.5x10^43 erg/s and aiso &gt; 16 arcsec^2 lie only in thecdfs. these large, bright blobs have a field-to-field variance of sigma_v &gt;~1.5 (150%) about their number density n ~ 1.0x10^-5 mpc^-3. this variance islarge, significantly higher than that of unresolved laes (sigma_v ~ 0.3 or30%), and can adversely affect comparisons of blob number densities andluminosity functions among different surveys. we compare the statistics of ourblobs with dark matter halos in a 1 gpc/h cosmological n-body simulation. atz=2.3, the number density (n) implies that each bright, large blob could occupya halo of m_halo &gt; 10^13 msun if most halos have detectable blobs. thepredicted variance in n is consistent with that observed and corresponds to abias of ~7. blob halos lie at the high end of the halo mass distribution atz=2.3 and are likely to evolve into the ~10^14 msun halos typical of galaxyclusters today. on larger scales of ~10 co-moving mpc, blobs cluster wherecompact laes do, indicating that blobs lie in coherent, highly overdensestructures.

1008.4242	galactic outflows and the kinematics of damped lyman alpha absorbers	the kinematics of damped lyman alpha absorbers (dlas) are difficult toreproduce in hierarchical galaxy formation models, particularly thepreponderance of wide systems. we investigate dla kinematics at z=3 usinghigh-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include aheuristic model for galactic outflows. without outflows, our simulations failto yield enough wide dlas, as in previous studies. with outflows, predicted dlakinematics are in much better agreement with observations. comparing twooutflow models, we find that a model based on momentum-driven wind scalingsprovides the best match to the observed dla kinematic statistics of prochaska &amp;wolfe. in this model, dlas typically arise a few kpc away from galaxies thatwould be identified in emission. narrow dlas can arise from any halo and galaxymass, but wide ones only arise in halos with mass &gt;10^11 mo, from either largecentral or small satellite galaxies. this implies that the success of thisoutflow model originates from being most efficient at pushing gas out fromsmall satellite galaxies living in larger halos. this increases thecross-section for large halos relative to smaller ones, thereby yielding widerkinematics. our simulations do not include radiative transfer effects ordetailed metal tracking, and outflows are modeled heuristically, but theystrongly suggest that galactic outflows are central to understanding dlakinematics. an interesting consequence is that dla kinematics may placeconstraints on the nature and efficiency of gas ejection from high-z galaxies.

1103.3528	galaxy evolution in cosmological simulations with outflows i: stellar  masses and star formation rates	we examine the growth of the stellar content of galaxies from z=3-0 incosmological hydrodynamic simulations incorporating parameterised galacticoutflows. without outflows, galaxies overproduce stellar masses (m*) and starformation rates (sfrs) compared to observations. winds introduce a three-tierform for the galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate functions, where themiddle tier depends on differential (i.e. mass-dependent) recycling of ejectedwind material back into galaxies. a tight m*-sfr relation is a generic outcomeof all these simulations, and its evolution is well-described as being poweredby cold accretion, although current observations at z&gt;2 suggest that starformation in small early galaxies must be highly suppressed. roughly one-thirdof z=0 galaxies at masses below m^* are satellites, and star formation insatellites is not much burstier than in centrals. all models fail to suppressstar formation and stellar mass growth in massive galaxies at z&lt;2, indicatingthe need for an external quenching mechanism such as black hole feedback. allmodels also fail to produce dwarfs as young and rapidly star-forming asobserved. an outflow model following scalings expected for momentum-drivenwinds broadly matches observed galaxy evolution around m^* from z=0-3, which isa significant success since these galaxies dominate cosmic star formation, butthe failures at higher and lower masses highlight the challenges still faced bythis class of models. we argue that central star-forming galaxies arewell-described as living in a slowly-evolving equilibrium between inflows fromgravity and recycled winds, star formation, and strong and ubiquitous outflowsthat regulate how much inflow forms into stars. star-forming galaxy evolutionis thus primarily governed by the continual cycling of baryons between galaxiesand intergalactic gas.

1104.3156	galaxy evolution in cosmological simulations with outflows ii:  metallicities and gas fractions	we use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to investigate how inflows, starformation, and outflows govern the the gaseous and metal content of galaxies.in our simulations, galaxy metallicities are established by a balance betweeninflows and outflows as governed by the mass outflow rate, implying that themass-metallicity relation reflects how the outflow rate varies with stellarmass (m*). gas content is set by a competition between inflow into and gasconsumption within the ism, the latter being governed by the sf law, while theformer is impacted by both wind recycling and preventive feedback. stochasticvariations in the inflow rate move galaxies off the equilibrium m*-z andz*-fgas relations in a manner correlated with star formation rate, and thescatter is set by the timescale to re-equilibrate. the evolution of bothrelations from z=3-0 is slow, as individual galaxies tend to evolve mostlyalong the relations. gas fractions at a given m* slowly decrease with timebecause the cosmic inflow rate diminishes faster than the consumption rate,while metallicities slowly increase as infalling gas becomes more enriched.observations from z~3-0 are better matched by simulations employingmomentum-driven wind scalings rather than constant wind speeds, but all modelspredict too low gas fractions at low masses and too high metallicities at highm*. all our models reproduce observed second-parameter trends of themass-metallicity relation with star formation rate and environment, indicatingthat these are a consequence of equilibrium and not feedback. overall, theanalytical framework of our equilibrium scenario broadly captures the relevantphysics establishing the galaxy gas and metal content in simulations, whichsuggests that the cycle of baryonic inflows and outflows centrally governs thecosmic evolution of these properties in typical star-forming galaxies.

1104.3597	kinematics of gas in lyman alpha nebulae	exploring the origin of ly-alpha nebulae (blobs) requires measurements oftheir gas kinematics that are impossible with only the resonant,optically-thick lya line. to define gas motions relative to the systemicvelocity of the blob, the lya line must be compared with an optically-thin linelike halpha, which is not much altered by radiative transfer effects. we obtainoptical and nir spectra of the two brightest lya blobs from yang et al. sampleusing the magellan/mage and vlt/sinfoni. both the lya and halpha lines confirmthat these blobs lie at the survey redshift, z~2.3. within each blob, we detectseveral halpha sources, which roughly correspond to galaxies seen in hstimages. the halpha detections show that these galaxies have large internalvelocity dispersions (130 - 190km/s) and that, in the one system (lab01), theirvelocity difference is ~440 km/s. the presence of multiple galaxies within theblobs, and those galaxies' large velocity dispersions and large relativemotion, is consistent with our previous finding that lya blobs inhabit massivedark matter halos that will evolve into those typical of rich clusters today.to determine whether the gas near the embedded galaxies is predominantlyinfalling or outflowing, we compare the lya and halpha line centers, findingthat lya is not offset (delta lya = +0km/s) in lab01 and redshifted by only+230 km/s in lab02. these offsets are small compared to those of lyman breakgalaxies, which average +450 km/s and extend to about +700 km/s. we test andrule out the simplest infall models and those outflow models withsuper/hyper-winds, which require large outflow velocities. because of theunknown geometry of the gas distribution and the possibility of multiplesources of lya emission embedded in the blobs, a larger sample and moresophisticated models are required to test more complex or a wider range ofinfall and outflow scenarios.

1106.1444	the intergalactic medium over the last 10 billion years ii: metal-line  absorption and physical conditions	we investigate the metallicity evolution and content of the intergalacticmedium (igm) and galactic halo gas from z=2-&gt;0 using 110-million particlecosmological hydrodynamic simulations. we focus on the detectability andphysical properties of uv resonance metal-line absorbers observable withhubble's cosmic origins spectrograph (cos). we confirm that galactic superwindoutflows are required to enrich the igm to observed levels down to z=0 usingthree wind prescriptions contrasted to a no-wind simulation. our favouredmomentum-conserved wind prescription deposits metals closer to galaxies owingto its moderate energy input, while the more energetic constant wind modelenriches the warm-hot igm 6.4x more. despite these significant differences, allwind models produce metal-line statistics within a factor of two of existingobservations. this is because ovi, civ, siiv, and neviii absorbers primarilyarise from t&lt;10^5 k, photo-ionised gas that is enriched to similar levels inthe three feedback schemes. ovi absorbers trace the diffuse phase withdelta&lt;100, which is enriched to ~1/50 zsol at z=0, although the absorbersthemselves usually exceed 0.3 zsol and arise from inhomogeneously distributed,un-mixed winds. civ and siiv absorbers trace primarily t~10^4 k gas insidehaloes. we predict cos will observe a population of neviii photo-ionisedabsorbers tracing t&lt;10^5 k, delta~10 gas. mgx and sixii are rarely detected incos s/n=30 simulated sight lines although detections trace t=10^(6-7) k halogas. in general, the igm is enriched in an outside-in manner, where wind-blownmetals released at higher redshift reach lower overdensities, resulting inhigher ionisation species tracing lower-density, older metals. at z=0, the 90%of baryons outside of galaxies are enriched to 0.096 zsol, but the 65% ofunbound baryons in the igm have 0.018 zsol and contain only 4% of all metals.

0710.0381	the galaxy stellar mass-star formation rate relation: evidence for an  evolving stellar initial mass function?	the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass--star formation rate relationship(m*-sfr) provides key constraints on the stellar mass assembly histories ofgalaxies. for star-forming galaxies, m*-sfr is observed to be fairly tight witha slope close to unity from z~0-2. simulations of galaxy formation reproducethese trends owing to the generic dominance of smooth and steady cold accretionin these systems. in contrast, the amplitude of the m*-sfr relation evolvesmarkedly differently than in models. stated in terms of a star formationactivity parameter alpha=(m*/sfr)/(t_h-1 gyr), models predict a constantalpha~1 out to redshifts z=4+, while the observed m*-sfr relation indicatesthat alpha increases by x3 from z~2 until today. the low alpha at high-z notonly conflicts with models, but is also difficult to reconcile with otherobservations of high-z galaxies. systematic biases could significantly affectmeasurements of m* and sfr, but detailed considerations suggest that none areobvious candidates to reconcile the discrepancy. a speculative solution isconsidered in which the stellar initial mass function (imf) evolves towardsmore high-mass star formation at earlier epochs. following larson, a model isinvestigated in which the characteristic mass mhat where the imf turns overincreases with redshift. the observed and predicted m*-sfr evolution may bebrought into agreement if mhat=0.5(1+z)^2 mo out to z~2. such evolution broadlymatches recent observations of cosmic stellar mass growth, and the resultingz=0 cumulative imf is similar to the paunchy imf favored by fardal et al toreconcile the observed cosmic star formation history with present-day fossillight measures.

1108.0426	an analytic model for the evolution of the stellar, gas, and metal  content of galaxies	we present an analytic formalism that describes the evolution of the stellar,gas, and metal content of galaxies. it is based on the idea, inspired byhydrodynamic simulations, that galaxies live in a slowly-evolving equilibriumbetween inflow, outflow, and star formation. we argue that this formalismbroadly captures the behavior of galaxy properties evolving in simulations. theresulting equilibrium equations for the star formation rate, gas fraction, andmetallicity depend on three key free parameters that represent ejectivefeedback, preventive feedback, and re-accretion of ejected material. weschematically describe how these parameters are constrained by models andobservations. galaxies perturbed off the equilibrium relations owing to inflowstochasticity tend to be driven back towards equilibrium, such that deviationsin star formation rate at a given mass are correlated with gas fraction andanti-correlated with metallicity. after an early gas accumulation epoch,quiescently star-forming galaxies are expected to be in equilibrium over mostof cosmic time. the equilibrium model provides a simple intuitive framework forunderstanding the cosmic evolution of galaxy properties, and centrally featuresthe cycle of baryons between galaxies and surrounding gas as the driver ofgalaxy growth.

1112.1084	the galex arecibo sdss survey v: the relation between the hi content of  galaxies and metal enrichment at their outskirts	we have obtained long-slit spectra of 174 star-forming galaxies with stellarmasses greater than 10^10 m_\odot from the galex arecibo sdss (gass) survey.these galaxies have both hi and h_2 mass measurements. the average metallicityprofile is strikingly flat out to r_90, the radius enclosing 90% of the r-bandlight. metallicity profiles which decline steadily with radius are foundprimarily for galaxies in our sample with low stellar mass (log(m_*)&lt;10.2),concentration, and/or mean stellar mass density. beyond ~r_90, however, around10 percent of the galaxies in our sample exhibit a sharp downturn inmetallicity. remarkably, we find that the magnitude of the outer metallicitydrop is well correlated with the total hi content of the galaxy (measured asf_hi=m_hi/m_*). we examine the radial profiles of stellar population ages andstar formation rate densities, and conclude that the galaxies with largestouter metallicity drops are actively growing their stellar disks, with massdoubling times across the whole disk only one third as long as a typical gassgalaxy. we also describe a correlation between local stellar mass density andmetallicity, which is valid across all galaxies in our sample. we argue thatmuch of the recent stellar mass growth at the edges of these galaxies can belinked to the accretion or radial transport of relatively pristine gas frombeyond the galaxies' stellar disks.

1203.1039	cosmological implications of a stellar initial mass function that varies  with the jeans mass in galaxies	observations of star-forming galaxies at high-z have suggested discrepanciesin the inferred star formation rates (sfrs) either between data and models, orbetween complementary measures of the sfr. these putative discrepancies couldall be alleviated if the stellar imf is systematically weighted toward morehigh-mass star formation in rapidly star-forming galaxies. here, we explore howthe imf might vary under the central assumption that the turnover mass in theimf, mc, scales with the jeans mass in giant molecular clouds (gmcs), m_j. weemploy hydrodynamic and radiative transfer simulations of galaxies to predicthow the typical gmc jeans mass, and hence the imf, varies with galaxy property.we then study the impact of such an imf on the star formation law, the sfr-m*relation, submillimetre galaxies (smgs), and the cosmic sfr density. our mainresults are: the h2 mass-weighted jeans mass in a galaxy scales with the sfrwhen the sfr is greater a few m_sun/yr. sps modeling shows that this results ina nonlinear relation between sfr and lbol, such that sfr lbol^0.88. using thismodel relation, the inferred sfr of local ulirgs decreases by ~2, and that ofhigh-z smgs decreases by ~3-5. at z 2, this results in a lowered normalisationof the sfr-m* relation in better agreement with models, a reduced discrepancybetween the observed cosmic sfr density and stellar mass density evolution, andsmg sfrs that are easier to accommodate in current hierarchical structureformation models. it further results in a schmidt relation with slope of ~1.6when utilising a physically motivated form for the co-h2 conversion factor.while each of the discrepancies considered here could be alleviated withoutappealing to a varying imf, the modest variation implied by assuming mc m_j isa plausible solution that simultaneously addresses numerous thorny issuesregarding the sfrs of high-z galaxies.

1206.1859	hydrogen and metal line absorption around low-redshift galaxies in  cosmological hydrodynamic simulations	we study the physical conditions of the circum-galactic medium (cgm) aroundz=0.25 galaxies as traced by hi and metal line absorption, using cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulations that include galactic outflows. using lines of sighttargeted at impact parameters from 10 kpc to 1 mpc around galaxies with halomasses from 10^11-10^13 m_solar, we study the physical conditions and theirvariation with impact parameter b and line-of-sight velocity delta v in the cgmas traced by hi, mgii, siiv, civ, ovi, and neviii absorbers. all ions show astrong excess of absorption near galaxies compared to random lines of sight.the excess continues beyond 1 mpc, reflecting the correlation of metalabsorption with large-scale structure. absorption is particularly enhancedwithin about v&lt;300 km/sec and roughly 300 kpc of galaxies (with distancessomewhat larger for the highest ion), approximately delineating the cgm; thisrange contains the majority of global metal absorption. low ions like mgii andsiiv predominantly arise in denser gas closer to galaxies and drop more rapidlywith b, while high ions ovi and neviii trace more diffusely distributed gaswith a comparatively flat radial profile; civ is intermediate. all ionspredominantly trace t~10^4-4.5 k photo-ionised gas at all b, but when hot cgmgas is present (mostly in larger halos), we see strong collisionally-ionisedovi and neviii at b &lt;= 100 kpc. larger halo masses generally produce moreabsorption, though overall the trends are not as strong as that with impactparameter. these findings arise using our favoured outflow scalings as expectedfor momentum-driven winds; with no winds, the cgm gas remains mostlyunenriched, while our outflow model with a constant velocity and mass loadingfactor produce hotter, more widely dispersed metals.

1210.0905	a high molecular fraction in a sub-damped absorber at z=0.56	measuring rest-frame ultraviolet rotational transitions from the lyman andwerner bands in absorption against a bright background continuum is one of thefew ways to directly measure molecular hydrogen (h2). here we report thedetection of lyman-werner absorption from h2 at z=0.56 in a sub-damped ly-alphasystem with neutral hydrogen column density n(hi) = 10^(19.5 +/- 0.2) cm^-2.this is the first h2 system analysed at a redshift &lt; 1.5 beyond the milky wayhalo. it has a surprisingly high molecular fraction: log f(h2) &gt; -1.93 +/- 0.36based on modelling the line profiles, with a robust model-independent lowerlimit of f(h2) &gt; 10^-3. this is higher than f(h2) values seen along sightlineswith similar n(hi) through the milky way disk and the magellanic clouds. themetallicity of the absorber is 0.19 +0.21 -0.10 solar, with a dust-to-gas ratio&lt; 0.36 times the value in the solar neighbourhood. absorption from associatedlow-ionisation metal transitions such as oi and feii is observed in addition toovi. using cloudy models we show that there are three phases present; a ~100 kphase giving rise to h2, a ~10^4 k phase where most of the low-ionisation metalabsorption is produced; and a hotter phase associated with ovi. based onsimilarities to high velocity clouds in the milky way halo showing h2 and thepresence of two nearby galaxy candidates with impact parameters of ~10 kpc, wesuggest that the absorber may be produced by a tidally-stripped structuresimilar to the magellanic stream.

1210.6037	the cosmic evolution of the imf under the jeans conjecture with  implications for bottom-heavy ellipticals	we examine the cosmic evolution of a stellar initial mass function (imf) ingalaxies that varies with the jeans mass in the interstellar medium, payingparticular attention to the k-band stellar mass to light ratio (m/l_k) ofpresent-epoch massive galaxies. we calculate the typical jeans mass usinghigh-resolution hydrodynamic simulations coupled with a fully radiative modelfor the ism, which yields a parameterisation of the imf characteristic mass asa function of galaxy star formation rate (sfr). we then calculate the starformation histories of galaxies utilising an equilibrium galaxy growth modelcoupled with constraints on the star formation histories set by abundancematching models. we find that at early times, energetic coupling between dustand gas drive warm conditions in the ism, yielding bottom-light/top- heavy imfsassociated with large ism jeans masses for massive star-forming galaxies. owingto the remnants of massive stars that formed during the top-heavy phases atearly times, the resultant m/l_k(sigma) in massive galaxies at the presentepoch is increased relative to the non- varying imf case. at late times, lowercosmic ray fluxes allow for cooler ism temperatures in massive galaxies, andhence newly formed clusters will exhibit bottom-heavy imfs, further increasingm/l_k(sigma). our central result is hence that a given massive galaxy may gothrough both top-heavy and bottom-heavy imf phases during its lifetime, thoughthe bulk of the stars form during a top-heavy phase. qualitatively, thevariations in m/l_k(sigma) with galaxy mass are in agreement with observations,however, our model may not be able to account for bottom-heavy mass functionsas indicated by stellar absorption features.

0712.1827	mass, metal, and energy feedback in cosmological simulations	using gadget-2 cosmological hydrodynamic simulations including anobservationally-constrained model for galactic outflows, we investigate howfeedback from star formation distributes mass, metals, and energy on cosmicscales from z=6-&gt;0. we include instantaneous enrichment from type ii sne,delayed enrichment from type ia sne and stellar (agb) mass loss, and weindividually track c, o, si, and fe. following on the successes of themomentum-driven wind scalings, we improve our implementation with an on-the-flygalaxy finder to derive wind properties based on host galaxy masses. bytracking wind particles in a suite of simulations, we find: (1) wind materialreaccretes onto a galaxy on a recycling timescale that varies inversely withgalaxy mass. hence metals driven into the igm by galactic superwinds cannot beassumed to leave their galaxy forever. wind material is typically recycledseveral times; the median number of ejections for a given wind particle is 3,so by z=0 the total mass ejected in winds exceeds 0.5\omega_b. (2) the physicaldistance winds travel is fairly independent of redshift and galaxy mass (60-100physical kpc). for sizable galaxies at later epochs, winds typically do notescape the galaxy halo, and rain back down in a halo fountain. high-z galaxiesenrich a significantly larger comoving volume of the igm, with metals migratingback into galaxies to lower z. (3) the energy imparted into winds scales withm_{gal}^{1/3}, and energy from another source besides sne (such as photons fromyoung stars) may be required to distributed cosmic metals as observed. (4) theproduction of all 4 metals tracked is globally dominated by type ii sne at allepochs. however, intracluster gas iron content triples as a result of non-typeii sources, and the low-z igm carbon content is boosted by agb feedback.

1301.5640	spatially resolved star formation histories of nearby galaxies: evidence  for episodic star formation in discs	we use long-slit spectroscopy from moran et al. to study the radialdependence of the recent star formation histories of nearby galaxies withstellar masses greater than 10^10m_sun. we fit stellar population models to thecombination of ssfr, d4000 and hdelta_a and show that many galaxies have balmerabsorption line equivalent widths that require recent short-lived episodes orbursts of star formation. the fraction of galaxies that have experiencedepisodic rather than continuous star formation is highest for late-typegalaxies with low stellar masses. in these systems, bursts occur both in theinner and outer regions of the galaxy. the fraction of stars formed in a singleburst episode is typically around 15% of the total stellar mass in the innerregions of the galaxy and around 5% of the mass in the outer regions. when weaverage over the population, we find that such bursts contribute around a halfof the total mass in stars formed in the last 2 gyr. in massive galaxies,bursts occur predominantly in the outer disk. around a third of all massive,bulge-dominated galaxies have experienced recent star formation episodes thatare fully confined to their outer (r &gt; 0.7r_90) regions. the fraction of starsformed in a single episode is only 2 - 3 % of the underlying stellar mass, butsuch bursts contribute nearly all the stellar mass formed in the last 2 gyr.recent star formation in outer disks is strongly correlated with the globalatomic gas fraction of the galaxy, but not its global molecular gas fraction.we suggest that outer episodic star formation is triggered by gas accretionevents.

1302.3631	the neutral hydrogen content of galaxies in cosmological hydrodynamic  simulations	we examine the global hi properties of galaxies in quarter-billion particlecosmological simulations using gadget-2, focusing on how galactic outflowsimpact hi content. we consider four outflow models, including a new one (ezw)motivated by recent interstellar medium simulations in which the wind speed andmass loading factor scale as expected for momentum-driven outflows for largergalaxies and energy-driven outflows for dwarfs (sigma&lt;75 km/s). to obtainpredicted hi masses, we employ a simple but effective local correction forparticle self-shielding, and an observationally-constrained transition fromneutral to molecular hydrogen. our ezw simulation produces an hi mass functionwhose faint-end slope of -1.3 agrees well with observations from the alfalfasurvey; other models agree less well. satellite galaxies have a bimodaldistribution in hi fraction versus halo mass, with smaller satellites and/orthose in larger halos more often being hi-deficient. at a given stellar mass,hi content correlates with star formation rate and inversely correlates withmetallicity, as expected if driven by stochasticity in the accretion rate. tohigher redshifts, massive hi galaxies disappear and the mass function steepens.the global cosmic hi density conspires to remain fairly constant from z~5-0,but the relative contribution from smaller galaxies increases with redshift.

1303.5058	black hole-galaxy correlations without self-regulation	recent models of black hole growth in a cosmological context have forwarded aparadigm in which the growth is self-regulated by feedback from the black holeitself. here we use cosmological zoom simulations of galaxy formation down to z= 2 to show that such strong self-regulation is required in the popularspherical bondi accretion model, but that a plausible alternative model inwhich black hole growth is limited by galaxy-scale torques does not requireself-regulation. instead, this torque-limited accretion model yields blackholes and galaxies evolving on average along the observed scaling relations byrelying only on a fixed, 5% mass retention rate onto the black hole from theradius at which the accretion flow is fed. feedback from the black hole may(and likely does) occur, but does not need to couple to galaxy-scale gas inorder to regulate black hole growth. we show that this result is insensitive tovariations in the initial black hole mass, stellar feedback, or otherimplementation details. the torque-limited model allows for high accretionrates at very early epochs (unlike the bondi case), which if viable can helpexplain the rapid early growth of black holes, while by z = 2 it yieldseddington factors of 1%-10%. this model also yields a less directcorrespondence between major merger events and rapid phases of black holegrowth. instead, growth is more closely tied to cosmological disk feeding,which may help explain observational studies showing that, at least at z &gt; 1,active galaxies do not preferentially show merger signatures.

1303.6959	cosmological zoom simulations of z = 2 galaxies: the impact of galactic  outflows	we use high-resolution cosmological zoom simulations with ~200 pc resolutionat z = 2 and various prescriptions for galactic outflows in order to explorethe impact of winds on the morphological, dynamical, and structural propertiesof eight individual galaxies with halo masses ~ 10^11--2x10^12 msun at z = 2.we present a detailed comparison to spatially and spectrally resolved h{\alpha}and other observations of z ~ 2 galaxies. we find that simulations withoutwinds produce massive, compact galaxies with low gas fractions, super-solarmetallicities, high bulge fractions, and much of the star formationconcentrated within the inner kpc. strong winds are required to maintain highgas fractions, redistribute star-forming gas over larger scales, and increasethe velocity dispersion of simulated galaxies, more in agreement with thelarge, extended, turbulent disks typical of high-redshift star-forminggalaxies. winds also suppress early star formation to produce high-redshiftcosmic star formation efficiencies in better agreement with observations.sizes, rotation velocities, and velocity dispersions all scale with stellarmass in accord with observations. our simulations produce a diversity ofmorphological characteristics - among our three most massive galaxies, we finda quiescent grand-design spiral, a very compact star-forming galaxy, and aclumpy disk undergoing a minor merger; the clumps are evident in h{\alpha} butnot in the stars. rotation curves are generally slowly rising, particularlywhen calculated using azimuthal velocities rather than enclosed mass. ourresults are broadly resolution-converged. these results show that cosmologicalsimulations including outflows can produce disk galaxies similar to thoseobserved during the peak epoch of cosmic galaxy growth.

1309.5951	tracing inflows and outflows with absorption lines in circumgalactic gas	we examine how hi and metal absorption lines within low-redshift galaxy halostrace the dynamical state of circumgalactic gas, using cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulations that include a well-vetted heuristic model forgalactic outflows. we categorize inflowing, outflowing, and ambient gas basedon its history and fate as tracked in our simulation. following our earlierwork showing that the ionisation level of absorbers was a primary factor indetermining the physical conditions of absorbing gas, we show here that it isalso a governing factor for its dynamical state. low-ionisation metal absorbers(e.g. mgii) tend to arise in gas that will fall onto galaxies within severalgyr, while high-ionisation metal absorbers (e.g. ovi) generally trace materialthat was deposited by outflows many gyr ago. inflowing gas is dominated byenriched material that was previously ejected in an outflow, hence accretion atlow redshifts is typically substantially enriched. recycling wind material ispreferentially found closer to galaxies, and is more dominant in lower-masshalos since high-mass halos have more hot gas that is able to support itselfagainst infall. low-mass halos also tend to re-eject more of their accretedmaterial, owing to our outflow prescription that employs higher mass loadingfactors for lower-mass galaxies. typical hi absorbers trace unenriched ambientmaterial that is not participating in the baryon cycle, but stronger hiabsorbers arise in cool, enriched inflowing gas. instantaneous radial velocitymeasures of absorbers are generally poor at distinguishing between inflowingand outflowing gas, except in the case of very recent outflows. these resultssuggest that probing halo gas using a range of absorbers can provide detailedinformation about the amount and physical conditions of material that isparticipating in the baryon cycle.

1309.5963	torque-limited growth of massive black holes in galaxies across cosmic  time	we combine cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with analytic models toevaluate the role of galaxy-scale gravitational torques on the evolution ofmassive black holes at the centers of star-forming galaxies. we confirm andextend our earlier results to show that torque-limited growth yields blackholes and host galaxies evolving on average along the mbh-mbulge relation fromearly times down to z = 0 and that convergence onto the scaling relation occursindependent of the initial conditions and with no need for mass averagingthrough mergers or additional self-regulation processes. smooth accretiondominates the long-term evolution, with black hole mergers with mass ratios&gt;1:5 representing typically a small fraction of the total growth. winds fromthe accretion disk are required to eject significant mass to suppress blackhole growth, but there is no need for coupling this wind to galactic-scale gasto regulate black holes in a non-linear feedback loop. torque-limited growthyields a close-to-linear relation for the star formation rate and the blackhole accretion rate averaged over galaxy evolution time scales. however, thesfr-agn connection has significant scatter owing to strong variability of blackhole accretion at all resolved time scales. eddington ratios can be describedby a broad lognormal distribution with median value evolving roughly as (1 +z)^1.9, suggesting a main sequence for black hole growth similar to the cosmicevolution of specific sfrs. our results offer an attractive scenario consistentwith available observations in which cosmological gas infall and transport ofangular momentum in the galaxy by gravitational instabilities regulate thelong-term co-evolution of black holes and star-forming galaxies.

1311.4559	a deep search for faint galaxies associated with very low-redshift c iv  absorbers: a case with cold-accretion characteristics	studies of qso absorber-galaxy connections are often hindered by inadequateinformation on whether faint/dwarf galaxies are located near the qso sightlines. to investigate the contribution of faint galaxies to qso absorberpopulations, we are conducting a deep galaxy redshift survey near low-z c ivabsorbers. here we report a blindly-detected c iv absorption system (z(abs) =0.00348) in the spectrum of pg1148+549 that appears to be associated eitherwith an edge-on dwarf galaxy with an obvious disk (ugc 6894, z(gal) = 0.00283)at an impact parameter of rho = 190 kpc or with a very faint dwarf irregulargalaxy at rho = 23 kpc, which is closer to the sightline but has a largerredshift difference (z(gal) = 0.00107, i.e., dv = 724 km/s). we considervarious gas/galaxy associations, including infall and outflows. based oncurrent theoretical models, we conclude that the absorber is most likelytracing (1) the remnants of an outflow from a previous epoch, a so-called'ancient outflow', or (2) intergalactic gas accreting onto ugc 6894, 'coldmode' accretion. the latter scenario is supported by h i synthesis imaging datathat shows the rotation curve of the disk being codirectional with the velocityoffset between ugc 6894 and the absorber, which is located almost directlyalong the major axis of the edge-on disk.

1405.1043	hot gas in massive halos drives both mass quenching and environment  quenching	observations indicate that galaxies with high stellar masses or in denseenvironments have low specific star formation rates, i.e. they are quenched.based on cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include a prescriptionwhere quenching occurs in regions dominated by hot (&gt;10^5 k) gas, we argue thatthis hot gas quenching in halos &gt;10^12 msun drives both mass quenching (i.e.central quenching) and environment quenching (i.e. satellite quenching). thesesimulations reproduce a broad range of locally observed trends among quenching,halo mass, stellar mass, environment, and distance to halo center. we show thatmass quenching is independent of environment because 10^12-10^13 msun"quenching halos" -- those where most mass quenching occurs -- inhabit a largerange of environments. on the other hand, environment quenching is independentof stellar mass because galaxies of all stellar masses may live in denseenvironments as satellites of groups and clusters. furthermore, satellitegalaxies show signs of mass quenching independent of halo mass because massivesatellites at z=0 have typically been mass quenched as centrals in their ownhot halos at higher z -- a kind of pre-processing. as in observations, thefraction of quenched satellites increases with halo mass and decreases withdistance to the center of the group or cluster. we investigate quenchedcentrals in low-mass halos (&lt;10^12 msun), and show that most of these areejected former satellites of groups or clusters, while about 20 per cent werenever satellites but are enveloped in hot gas that extends up to 3 rvir fromthe centers of clusters. the agreement of our model with key observationaltrends suggests that hot gas in massive halos plays a leading role in quenchinglow-redshift galaxies.

1406.0509	the cos-dwarfs survey: the carbon reservoir around sub-l* galaxies	we report new observations of circumgalactic gas from the cos-dwarfs survey,a systematic investigation of the gaseous halos around 43 low-mass z $\leq$ 0.1galaxies using background qsos observed with the cosmic origins spectrograph.from the projected 1d and 2d distribution of c iv absorption, we find that c ivabsorption is detected out to ~ 0.5 r$_{vir}$ of the host galaxies. the c ivabsorption strength falls off radially as a power law and beyond 0.5 r$_{vir}$,no c iv absorption is detected above our sensitivity limit of ~ 50-100 m$\aa$.we find a tentative correlation between detected c iv absorption strength andstar formation, paralleling the strong correlation seen in highly ionizedoxygen for l~l* galaxies by the cos-halos survey. the data imply a large carbonreservoir in the cgm of these galaxies, corresponding to a minimum carbon massof $\gtrsim$ 1.2$\times 10^6$ $m_\odot$ out to ~ 110 kpc. this mass iscomparable to the carbon mass in the ism and more than the carbon masscurrently in stars of these galaxies. the c iv absorption seen around thesesub-l* galaxies can account for almost two-thirds of all $w_r$&gt; 100 m$\aa$ c ivabsorption detected at low z. comparing the c iv covering fraction withhydrodynamical simulations, we find that an energy-driven wind model isconsistent with the observations whereas a wind model of constant velocityfails to reproduce the cgm or the galaxy properties.

1406.6056	the distribution of satellites around massive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 in  zfourge/candels: dependence on star formation activity	we study the statistical distribution of satellites around star-forming andquiescent central galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 using imaging from the fourstar galaxyevolution survey (zfourge) and the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels). the deep near-ir data select satellites down to$\log(m/m_\odot)&gt;9$ at z&lt;3. the radial satellite distribution around centralsis consistent with a projected nfw profile. massive quiescent centrals,$\log(m/m_\odot)&gt;10.78$, have $\sim$2 times the number of satellites comparedto star-forming centrals with a significance of 2.7$\sigma$ even afteraccounting for differences in the centrals' stellar-mass distributions. we findno statistical difference in the satellite distributions of intermediate-massquiescent and star-forming centrals, $10.48&lt;\log(m/m_\odot)&lt;10.78$. comparingto the guo2011 semi-analytic model, the excess number of satellites indicatesthat quiescent centrals have halo masses 0.3 dex larger than star-formingcentrals, even when the stellar-mass distributions are fixed. we use a simpletoy model that relates halo mass and quenching, which roughly reproduces theobserved quenched fractions and the differences in halo mass betweenstar-forming and quenched galaxies only if galaxies have a quenchingprobability that increases with halo mass from $\sim$0 for$\log(m_h/m_\odot)\sim$11 to $\sim$1 for $\log(m_h/m_\odot)\sim$13.5. a singlehalo-mass quenching threshold is unable to reproduce the quiescent fraction andsatellite distribution of centrals. therefore, while halo quenching may be animportant mechanism, it is unlikely to be the only factor driving quenching. itremains unclear why a high fraction of centrals remain star-forming even inrelatively massive halos.

1407.6012	the relation between sfr and stellar mass for galaxies at 3.5 $\le z\le$  6.5 in candels	distant star-forming galaxies show a correlation between their star formationrates (sfr) and stellar masses, and this has deep implications for galaxyformation. here, we present a study on the evolution of the slope and scatterof the sfr-stellar mass relation for galaxies at $3.5\leq z\leq 6.5$ usingmulti-wavelength photometry in goods-s from the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels) and spitzer extended deep survey. wedescribe an updated, bayesian spectral-energy distribution fitting method thatincorporates effects of nebular line emission, star formation histories thatare constant or rising with time, and different dust attenuation prescriptions(starburst and small magellanic cloud). from $z$=6.5 to $z$=3.5 star-forminggalaxies in candels follow a nearly unevolving correlation between stellar massand sfr that follows sfr $\sim$ $m_\star^a$ with $a = 0.54 \pm 0.16$ at $z\sim6$ and $0.70 \pm 0.21$ at $z\sim 4$. this evolution requires a star formationhistory that increases with decreasing redshift (on average, the sfrs ofindividual galaxies rise with time). the observed scatter in the sfr-stellarmass relation is tight, $\sigma(\log \mathrm{sfr}/\mathrm{m}_\odot$ yr$^{-1})&lt;0.3\ - $ 0.4 dex, for galaxies with $\log m_\star/\mathrm{m}_\odot &gt; 9$ dex.assuming that the sfr is tied to the net gas inflow rate (sfr $\sim$$\dot{m}_\mathrm{gas}$), then the scatter in the gas inflow rate is alsosmaller than 0.3$-$0.4 dex for star-forming galaxies in these stellar mass andredshift ranges, at least when averaged over the timescale of star formation.we further show that the implied star formation history of objects selected onthe basis of their co-moving number densities is consistent with the evolutionin the sfr-stellar mass relation.

1407.6801	the properties of lyman alpha nebulae: gas kinematics from non-resonant  lines	[abridged] with vlt/x-shooter, we obtain optical and nir spectra of sixly-alpha blobs at z~2.3. using three measures --- the velocity offset betweenthe lya line and the non-resonant [oiii] or h-alpha line (dv_lya), the offsetof stacked interstellar metal absorption lines, and the spectrally-resolved[oiii] line profile --- we study the kinematics of gas along the line of sightto galaxies within each blob center. these three indicators generally agree invelocity and direction, and are consistent with a simple picture in which thegas is stationary or slowly outflowing at a few hundred km/s from the embeddedgalaxies. the absence of stronger outflows is not a projection effect: thecovering fraction for our sample is limited to &lt;1/8 (13%). the outflowvelocities exclude models in which star formation or agn produce "super" or"hyper" winds of up to ~1000km/s. the dv_lya offsets here are smaller thantypical of lbgs, but similar to those of compact laes. the latter suggests thatoutflow speed cannot be a dominant factor in driving extended lya emission. forone lya blob (cdfs-lab14), whose lya profile and metal absorption line offsetssuggest no significant bulk motion, we use a simple radiative transfer model tomake the first column density measurement of gas in an embedded galaxy, findingit consistent with a dla system. overall, the absence of clear inflowsignatures suggests that the channeling of gravitational cooling radiation intolya is not significant over the radii probed here. however, one peculiar system(cdfs-lab10) has a blueshifted lya component that is not obviously associatedwith any galaxy, suggesting either displaced gas arising from tidalinteractions among blob galaxies or gas flowing into the blob center. theformer is expected in these overdense regions, and the latter might signify thepredicted but elusive cold gas accretion along filaments.

1408.2527	the mass evolution of the first galaxies: stellar mass functions and  star formation rates at $4 &lt; z &lt; 7$ in the candels goods-south field	we measure new estimates for the galaxy stellar mass function and starformation rates for samples of galaxies at $z \sim 4,~5,~6~\&amp;~7$ using data inthe candels goods south field. the deep near-infrared observations allow us toconstruct the stellar mass function at $z \geq 6$ directly for the first time.we estimate stellar masses for our sample by fitting the observed spectralenergy distributions with synthetic stellar populations, including nebular lineand continuum emission. the observed uv luminosity functions for the samplesare consistent with previous observations, however we find that the observed$m_{uv}$ - m$_{*}$ relation has a shallow slope more consistent with a constantmass to light ratio and a normalisation which evolves with redshift. ourstellar mass functions have steep low-mass slopes ($\alpha \approx -1.9$),steeper than previously observed at these redshifts and closer to that of theuv luminosity function. integrating our new mass functions, we find theobserved stellar mass density evolves from $\log_{10} \rho_{*} =6.64^{+0.58}_{-0.89}$ at $z \sim 7$ to $7.36\pm0.06$ $\text{m}_{\odot}\text{mpc}^{-3}$ at $z \sim 4$. finally, combining the measured uv continuumslopes ($\beta$) with their rest-frame uv luminosities, we calculate dustcorrected star-formation rates (sfr) for our sample. we find the specificstar-formation rate for a fixed stellar mass increases with redshift whilst theglobal sfr density falls rapidly over this period. our new sfr densityestimates are higher than previously observed at this redshift.

1408.2531	the impact of environment and mergers on the hi content of galaxies in  hydrodynamic simulations	we quantitatively examine the effects of accretion and environment on the hicontent of galaxies within a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation thatreproduces basic observed trends of hi in galaxies. we show that our modelbroadly reproduces the observed scatter in hi at a given stellar mass asquantified by the hi mass function in bins of stellar mass, as well as the hirichness versus local galaxy density. this shows that the predicted hifluctuations and environmental effects are roughly consistent with data withfew minor discrepancies. for satellite galaxies in &gt;= 10^12m_* halos, the hirichness distribution is bimodal and drops towards the largest halo masses. thedepletion rate of hi once a galaxy enters a more massive halo is more rapid athigher halo mass, in contrast to the specific star formation rate which showsmuch less variation in the attenuation rate versus halo mass. this suggeststhat, up to halo mass scales probed here (&lt;= 10^14m_*), star formation ismainly attenuated by starvation, but hi is additionally removed by strippingonce a hot gaseous halo is present. in low mass halos, the hi richness ofsatellites is independent of radius, while in high mass halos they becomegas-poor towards the center. we show that the gas fraction of satellite andcentral galaxies decreases from z=5 to z=0,tracking each other until z~1 afterwhich the satellites' hi content drops much more quickly, particularly for thehighest halo masses. mergers somewhat increase the hi richness and its scatterabout the mean relation, tracking the metallicity in a way consistent witharising from inflow fluctuations, while star formation is significantly boostedrelative to hi.

1410.2244	the stellar accretion origin of stellar population gradients in massive  galaxies at large radii	we investigate the evolution of stellar population gradients from $z=2$ to$z=0$ in massive galaxies at large radii ($r &gt; 2r_{\mathrm{eff}}$) using tencosmological zoom simulations of halos with $6 \times 10^{12} m_{\odot} &lt;m_{\mathrm{halo}} &lt; 2 \times 10^{13}m_{\odot}$. the simulations follow metalcooling and enrichment from snii, snia and agb winds. we explore thedifferential impact of an empirical model for galactic winds that reproducesthe mass-metallicity relation and its evolution with redshift. at larger radiithe galaxies, for both models, become more dominated by stars accreted fromsatellite galaxies in major and minor mergers. in the wind model, fewer starsare accreted, but they are significantly more metal poor resulting in steepglobal metallicity ($\langle \nabla z_{\mathrm{stars}} \rangle= -0.35$ dex/dex)and color (e.g. $\langle \nabla g-r \rangle = -0.13$ dex/dex) gradients inagreement with observations. in contrast, colour and metallicity gradients ofthe models without winds are inconsistent with observations. age gradients arein general mildly positive at $z=0$ ($\langle \nabla age_{\mathrm{stars}}\rangle= 0.04$ dex/dex) with significant differences between the models athigher redshift. we demonstrate that for the wind model, stellar accretion issteepening existing in-situ metallicity gradients by about 0.2 dex by thepresent day and helps to match observed gradients of massive early-typegalaxies at large radii. colour and metallicity gradients are significantlysteeper for systems which have accreted stars in minor mergers, while galaxieswith major mergers have relatively flat gradients, confirming previous results.this study highlights the importance of stellar accretion for stellarpopulation properties of massive galaxies at large radii, which can provideimportant constraints for formation models.

1410.7438	the rise and fall of a challenger: the bullet cluster in $\lambda$ cold  dark matter simulations	the bullet cluster has provided some of the best evidence for the $\lambda$cold dark matter ($\lambda\rm{cdm}$) model via direct empirical proof of theexistence of collisionless dark matter, while posing a serious challenge owingto the unusually high inferred pairwise velocities of its progenitor clusters.here we investigate the probability of finding such a high-velocity pair inlarge-volume n-body simulations, particularly focusing on differences betweenhalo finding algorithms. we find that algorithms that do not account for thekinematics of infalling groups yield vastly different statistics andprobabilities. when employing the rockstar halo finder that considers particlevelocities, we find numerous bullet-like pair candidates that closely match notonly the high pairwise velocity, but also the mass, mass ratio, separationdistance, and collision angle of the initial conditions that have been shown toproduce the bullet cluster in non-cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. theprobability of finding a high pairwise velocity pair among haloes with $m_{\rmhalo}\geq10^{14} m_{\odot}$ is $4.6\times 10^{-4}$ using rockstar, while it is$\approx 34\times$ lower using a friends-of-friends (fof) based approach as inprevious studies. this is because the typical spatial extent of bulletprogenitors is such that fof tends to group them into a single halo despiteclearly distinct kinematics. further requiring an appropriately high averagemass among the two progenitors, we find the comoving number density ofpotential bullet-like candidates to be on the order of $\approx10^{-10} \,{\rmmpc}^{-3}$. our findings suggest that $\lambda\rm{cdm}$ straightforwardlyproduces massive, high relative velocity halo pairs analogous to bullet clusterprogenitors, and hence the bullet cluster does not present a challenge to the$\lambda\rm{cdm}$ model.

1411.1157	equilibrium model constraints on baryon cycling across cosmic time	galaxies strongly self-regulate their growth via energetic feedback fromstars, supernovae, and black holes, but these processes are among the leastunderstood aspects of galaxy formation theory. we present an analytic galaxyevolution model that directly constrains such feedback processes from observedgalaxy scaling relations. the equilibrium model, which is broadly valid forstar-forming central galaxies that dominate cosmic star formation, is based onthe ansatz that galaxies live in a slowly-evolving equilibrium between inflows,outflows, and star formation. using a bayesian monte carlo markov chainapproach, we constrain our model to match observed galaxy scaling relationsbetween stellar mass and halo mass, star formation rate, and metallicity from0&lt;z&lt;2. a good fit (chi^2~1.6) is achieved with eight free parameters. wefurther show that constraining our model to any two of the three data sets alsoproduces a fit to the third that is within reasonable systematic uncertainties.the resulting best-fit parameters that describe baryon cycling suggest galacticoutflow scalings intermediate between energy and momentum-driven winds, a weakdependence of wind recycling time on mass, and a quenching mass scale thatevolves modestly upwards with redshift. this model further predicts a stellarmass-star formation rate relation that is in good agreement with observationsto z~6. our results suggest that this simple analytic framework captures thebasic physical processes required to model the mean evolution of stars andmetals in galaxies, despite not incorporating many canonical ingredients ofgalaxy formation models such as merging or disk formation.

1411.7391	a critical look at the mass-metallicity-sfr relation in the local  universe. i. an improved analysis framework and confounding systematics	it has been proposed that the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies exhibitsa secondary dependence on star formation rate (sfr), and that the resultingm-z-sfr relation may be redshift-invariant, i.e., "fundamental." however,conflicting results on the character of the sfr dependence, and whether itexists, have been reported. to gain insight into the origins of the conflictingresults, we (a) devise a non-parametric, astrophysically motivated analysisframework based on the offset from the star-forming ("main") sequence at agiven stellar mass (relative specific sfr), (b) apply this methodology andperform a comprehensive re-analysis of the local m-z-sfr relation, based onsdss, galex, and wise data, and (c) study the impact of sample selection, andof using different metallicity and sfr indicators. we show that metallicity isanti-correlated with specific sfr regardless of the indicators used. we do notfind that the relation is spurious due to correlations arising from biasedmetallicity measurements, or fiber aperture effects. we emphasize that thedependence is weak/absent for massive galaxies ($\log m_*&gt;10.5$), and that theoverall scatter in the m-z-sfr relation does not greatly decrease from the m-zrelation. we find that the dependence is stronger for the highest ssfr galaxiesabove the star-forming sequence. this two-mode behavior can be described with abroken linear fit in 12+log(o/h) vs. log (sfr$/m_*$), at a given $m_*$.previous parameterizations used for comparative analysis with higher redshiftsamples that do not account for the more detailed behavior of the local m-z-sfrrelation may incorrectly lead to the conclusion that those samples follow adifferent relationship.

1412.2712	physical models of galaxy formation in a cosmological framework	modeling galaxy formation in a cosmological context presents one of thegreatest challenges in astrophysics today, due to the vast range of scales andnumerous physical processes involved. here we review the current status ofmodels that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxyformation: semi-analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. wefocus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of theglobal and structural properties of galaxies from roughly cosmic high noon($z\sim 2-3$) to the present. although minor discrepancies remain, overall,models show remarkable convergence between different methods and makepredictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. modelers seemto have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical forshaping galaxy properties. this core set includes cosmological accretion,strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black holefeedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, andstructural and morphological evolution through merging and environmentalprocesses. however, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenologicalimplementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned toobservations. many details of how these diverse processes interact within ahierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. emergingmulti-scale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar andcosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically groundedfooting. concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide newchallenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraininginflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.

0805.1938	enrichment and pre-heating in intragroup gas from galactic outflows	we examine metal and entropy content in galaxy groups having t_x~0.5-2 kev incosmological hydrodynamic simulations. our simulations include awell-constrained prescription for galactic outflows following momentum-drivenwind scalings, and a sophisticated chemical evolution model. our simulationwith no outflows reproduces observed iron abundances in x-ray emitting gas, butthe oxygen abundance is too low; including outflows yields iron and oxygenabundances in good agreement with data. x-ray measures of [o/fe] primarilyreflect metal distribution mechanisms into hot gas, not the ratio of type ia totype ii supernovae within the group. iron abundance increases by x2 from z=1-0independent of group size, consistent with that seen in clusters, while [o/fe]drops by ~30%. core entropy versus temperature is elevated over self-similarpredictions regardless of outflows due to radiative cooling removinglow-entropy gas, but outflows provide an additional entropy contribution below1 kev. this results in a noticeable break in the l_x-t_x relation below 1 kev,as observed. importantly, outflows serve to reduce the stellar content ofgroups to observed levels. radial profiles from simulations are in broadagreement with observations, but there remain non-trivial discrepancies thatmay reflect an excess of late-time star formation in central group galaxies inour simulations. our model with outflows suggests a connection between physicalprocesses of galaxy formation and both pre-heating and enrichment in intragroupgas, though more definitive conclusions must await a model that simultaneouslysuppresses cooling flows as observed.

1506.03080	on the mass-metallicity-star formation rate relation for galaxies at  $z\sim 2$	recent studies have shown that the local mass-metallicity (m-z) relationdepends on the specific star formation rate (ssfr). whether such a dependenceexists at higher redshifts, and whether the resulting m-z-sfr relation isredshift invariant, is debated. we re-examine these issues by applying thenon-parametric techniques of salim et al. (2014) to ~130 $z\sim2.3$ galaxieswith n2 and o3 measurements from kbss (steidel et al. 2014). we find that thekbss m-z relation depends on ssfr at intermediate masses, where such dependenceexists locally. kbss and sdss galaxies of the same mass and ssfr ("localanalogs") are similarly offset in the bpt diagram relative to the bulk of localstar-forming galaxies, and thus we posit that metallicities can be comparedself-consistently at different redshifts as long as the masses and ssfrs of thegalaxies are similar. we find that the m-z-sfr relation of $z\sim2$ galaxies isconsistent with the local one at $\log m_*&lt;10$, but is offset up to -0.25 dexat higher masses, so it is altogether not redshift invariant. this high-massoffset could arise from a bias that high-redshift spectroscopic surveys haveagainst high-metallicity galaxies, but additional evidence disfavors thispossibility. we identify three causes for the reported discrepancy between n2and o3n2 metallicities at $z\sim2$: (1) a smaller offset that is also presentfor sdss galaxies, which we remove with new n2 calibration, (2) a genuineoffset due to differing ism condition, which is also present in local analogs,(3) an additional offset due to unrecognized agn contamination.

1508.00007	in-n-out: the gas cycle from dwarfs to spiral galaxies	we examine the scalings of galactic outflows with halo mass across a suite oftwenty high-resolution cosmological zoom galaxy simulations covering halomasses from 10^9.5 - 10^12 m_sun. these simulations self-consistently generateoutflows from the available supernova energy in a manner that successfullyreproduces key galaxy observables including the stellar mass-halo mass,tully-fisher, and mass-metallicity relations. we quantify the importance ofejective feedback to setting the stellar mass relative to the efficiency of gasaccretion and star formation. ejective feedback is increasingly important asgalaxy mass decreases; we find an effective mass loading factor that scales asv_circ^(-2.2), with an amplitude and shape that is invariant with redshift.these scalings are consistent with analytic models for energy-driven wind,based solely on the halo potential. recycling is common: about half the outflowmass across all galaxy masses is later re-accreted. the recycling timescale istypically about 1 gyr, virtually independent of halo mass. recycled material isre-accreted farther out in the disk and with typically about 2-3 times moreangular momentum. these results elucidate and quantify how the baryon cycleplausibly regulates star formation and alters the angular momentum distributionof disk material across the halo mass range where most of cosmic star formationoccurs.

(2015): radiative physics +classic sph can produce entropy cores. furthermore, the inclusion/absence ofagn feedback is not the dividing line -as in the case of describing the stellarcontent- for whether a code produces an unrealistic temperature inversion and afalling central entropy profile. however, agn feedback does strongly affect theoverall stellar distribution, limiting the effect of overcooling and reducingsensibly the stellar fraction.

1512.01251	the growth and enrichment of the intragroup gas	the thermal and chemical properties of the hot diffuse intragroup medium(igrm) provide important constraints on the feedback processes associated withmassive galaxy formation and evolution. here we explore these constraints via adetailed analysis of the global properties of simulated z&lt;3 galaxy groups froma cosmological simulation that includes a well-constrained prescription forstellar/supernovae-powered galactic outflows but no agn feedback. our aims areto (a) establish a baseline against which we will compare future models; (b)identify model successes due to stellar/supernovae-powered outflows; and (c)pinpoint features that signal the need for, and constrain the nature of, agnfeedback.  our simulation successfully reproduces key observed z=0 group igrmproperties, including the various x-ray lx - tx - entropy scaling relations,for all but the most massive groups. the z&lt;1 redshift evolution of these alsoagree with observations. contrary to expectations, the simulated groups' igrmdoes not suffer catastrophic cooling. yet, the z=0 group stellar mass is ~ 2xtoo large. this is due to the build-up of cold gas in the massive galaxiesbefore they are incorporated inside groups. this in turn indicates that otherfeedback mechanisms must activate in real galaxies once their stellar massesgrow to a few x 10^{10} m_sun. we show that these must be powerful enough toexpel a significant fraction of the gas from the galactic halos. gentlemaintenance-mode (quenching) agn feedback, as seen in galaxy clusters, will notdo. just as importantly, we find that the stellar/supernovae-powered winds areessential for understanding the igrm metal abundances. our simulation is ableto reproduce the observed relationship between the global igrm iron and siliconabundance and the group x-ray temperature, and these results ought to berelatively insensitive to the addition of agn feedback.

astro-ph;0007205	cooling radiation and the lyman-alpha luminosity of forming galaxies	we examine the cooling radiation from forming galaxies in hydrodynamicsimulations of the lcdm model (cold dark matter with a cosmological constant),focusing on the ly-alpha line luminosities of high-redshift systems. primordialcomposition gas condenses within dark matter potential wells, forming objectswith masses and sizes comparable to the luminous regions of observed galaxies.as expected, the energy radiated in this process is comparable to thegravitational binding energy of the baryons, and the total cooling luminosityof the galaxy population peaks at z ~= 2. however, in contrast to the classicalpicture of gas cooling from the \sim 10^6 k virial temperature of a typicaldark matter halo, we find that most of the cooling radiation is emitted by gaswith t &lt; 20,000 k. as a consequence, roughly 50% of this cooling radiationemerges in the ly-alpha line. while a galaxy's cooling luminosity is usuallysmaller than the ionizing continuum luminosity of its young stars, the two arecomparable in the most massive systems, and the cooling radiation is producedat larger radii, where the ly-alpha photons are less likely to be extinguishedby dust. we suggest, in particular, that cooling radiation could explain thetwo large (\sim 100 kpc), luminous (l_{ly-alpha} \sim 10^{44} erg s^{-1})``blobs'' of ly-alpha emission found in steidel et al.'s (1999) narrow bandsurvey of a z = 3 proto-cluster. our simulations predict objects of theobserved luminosity at about the right space density, and radiative transfereffects can account for the observed sizes and line widths. we discussobservable tests of this hypothesis for the nature of the ly-alpha blobs, andwe present predictions for the contribution of cooling radiation to thely-alpha luminosity function of galaxies as a function of redshift.

astro-ph;0101419	the statistical and physical properties of the low redshift lyman alpha  forest observed with hst/stis	we examine the ly-alpha absorber population at z&lt;0.3 detected in spectra ofthe qsos pg0953+415 and h1821+643 taken with the space telescope imagingspectrograph aboard the hubble space telescope. we compare their statisticalproperties to those in carefully-constructed mock quasar spectra drawn from acosmological hydrodynamic simulation of a lambda-cdm universe. we find verygood agreement in the column density and b-parameter distributions, down to thesmallest observable absorbers with n_hi\approx 10^{12.3} cm^-2. the observedabsorber population is complete for n_hi\ga 10^{13} cm^-2, with a columndensity distribution slope of \beta=2.04\pm 0.23 and a median b-parameter of 21km/s above this limit. the intergalactic gas giving rise to these weakabsorbers is analogous to that at high redshift, located in diffuse large-scalestructures that are highly photoionized by the metagalactic uv flux, though agreater number arise within shock-heated warm gas. the density, temperature,and column density of these absorbers follow similar relationships to those athigh redshift, though with substantially larger scatter due to the shock-heatedgas. the b-parameters typically have a significant contribution from thermalbroadening, which facilitates a measurement of the low-z igm temperature astraced by ly-alpha absorbers. from our simulation we estimate t_igm\sim 5000 k,with an upper limit of 10^4 k, at the mean density. the agreement in predictedand observed amplitude of the column density distributions allows us to measurethe hi photoionization rate at z=0.17 to be 10^{-13.3\pm 0.7} s^{-1} (estimatedmodeling uncertainty), close to predictions based on quasar properties.

astro-ph;0107290	sub-mm galaxies in cosmological simulations	we study the predicted sub-mm emission from massive galaxies in a lambda-cdmuniverse, using hydrodynamic cosmological simulations. assuming that most ofthe emission from newly formed stars is absorbed and reradiated in therest-frame far-ir, we calculate the number of galaxies that would be detectedin sub-mm surveys conducted with scuba. the predicted number counts arestrongly dependent on the assumed dust temperature and emissivity law. withplausible choices for sed parameters (e.g., t=35 k, beta=1.0), the simulationpredictions reproduce the observed number counts above ~ 1 mjy. the sourceshave a broad redshift distribution with median z ~ 2, in reasonable agreementwith observational constraints. however, the predicted count distribution maybe too steep at the faint end, and the fraction of low redshift objects may belarger than observed.  in this physical model of the sub-mm galaxy population, the objects detectedin existing surveys consist mainly of massive galaxies (several m_*) formingstars fairly steadily over timescales ~ 10^8-10^9 years, at moderate rates ~100msun/yr. the typical descendants of these sub-mm sources are even more massivegalaxies, with old stellar populations, found primarily in dense environments.while the resolution of our simulations is not sufficient to determine galaxymorphologies, these properties support the proposed identification of sub-mmsources with massive ellipticals in the process of formation. the most robustand distinctive prediction of this model, stemming directly from the longtimescale and correspondingly moderate rate of star formation, is that thefar-ir seds of scuba sources have a relative high 850 micron luminosity for agiven bolometric luminosity.

astro-ph;0205037	x-ray scaling relations of galaxy groups in a hydrodynamic cosmological  simulation	we examine the scalings of x-ray luminosity, temperature, and dark matter orgalaxy velocity dispersion for galaxy groups in an lcdm cosmologicalsimulation, which incorporates gravity, gas dynamics, radiative cooling, andstar formation, but no substantial non-gravitational heating. in agreement withobservations, the simulated l_x-sigma and l_x-t_x relations are steeper thanthose predicted by adiabatic simulations or self-similar models, withl_x\propto sigma^{4.4} and l_x\propto t_x^{2.6} for massive groups andsignificantly steeper relations below a break at sigma~180 km/s (t_x~0.7 kev),but t_x-sigma is fairly close to self-similar, with t_x\propto sigma^{1.75}.the entropy of hot gas in low mass groups is higher than predicted byself-similar scaling, and agrees with observations that suggest an "entropyfloor". the steeper scalings of the luminosity relations are driven byradiative cooling, which reduces the hot gas fraction from 50% of the totalbaryons at sigma \approx 500 km/s to 20% at sigma \approx 100 km/s. a secondaryeffect is that hot gas in smaller systems is less clumpy, further driving downl_x. a smaller volume simulation with eight times higher mass resolutionpredicts nearly identical x-ray luminosities at a given group mass,demonstrating the insensitivity of the predicted scaling relations to numericalresolution. there remain some quantitative discrepancies: the predicted massscale of the l_x-t_x and l_x-sigma breaks is somewhat too low, and theluminosity-weighted temperatures are too high at a given sigma. we concludethat radiative cooling has an important quantitative impact on group x-rayproperties and can account for many of the observed trends that have beeninterpreted as evidence for non-gravitational heating.

astro-ph;0212357	the halo occupation distribution and the physics of galaxy formation	the halo occupation distribution (hod) describes the bias between galaxiesand dark matter by specifying (a) the probability p(n|m) that a halo of virialmass m contains n galaxies of a particular class and (b) the relativedistributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos. we calculate predictedhods for a lambda-cdm cosmological model using an sph hydrodynamic simulationand a semi-analytic (sa) galaxy formation model. although the two methodspredict different galaxy mass functions, their hod predictions agree remarkablywell. for mass-selected samples, the mean occupation &lt;n(m)&gt; exhibits a sharpcutoff at low halo masses, a slowly rising plateau for &lt;n&gt;~1-2, and a moresteeply rising high occupancy regime. at low &lt;n&gt;, the mean pair and triplecounts are well below poisson expectations, with important consequences forsmall scale behavior of 2- and 3-point correlation functions. the hod dependsstrongly on galaxy age, with high mass halos populated mainly by old galaxiesand low mass halos by young galaxies. the sph simulation supports severalsimplifying assumptions about hod bias: the most massive galaxy in a halousually lies close to the center and moves near the halo's mean velocity;satellite galaxies have the same radial profile and velocity dispersion as thedark matter; and the mean occupation at fixed halo mass is independent of thehalo's larger scale environment. by applying the sph and sa hods to a largevolume n-body simulation, we show that both methods predict slight, observabledepartures from a power-law galaxy correlation function. the predicted hods areclosely tied to the underlying galaxy formation physics, they offer usefulguidance to theoretical models of galaxy clustering, and they will be testedempirically by ongoing analyses of galaxy redshift surveys.

astro-ph;0406633	interpreting the relationship between galaxy luminosity, color and  environment	we study the relationship between galaxy luminosity, color, and environmentin a cosmological simulation of galaxy formation. we compare the predictedrelationship with that found for sdss galaxies and find that the modelsuccessfully predicts most of the qualitative features seen in the data, butalso shows some interesting differences. specifically, the simulation predictsthat the local density around bright red galaxies is a strong increasingfunction of luminosity, but does not depend much on color at fixed luminosity.moreover, we show that this is due to central galaxies in dark matter haloswhose baryonic masses correlate strongly with halo mass. the simulation alsopredicts that the local density around blue galaxies is a strong increasingfunction of color, but does not depend much on luminosity at fixed color. weshow that this is due to satellite galaxies in halos whose stellar agescorrelate with halo mass. finally, the simulation fails to predict theluminosity dependence of environment observed around low luminosity redgalaxies. however, we show that this is most likely due to the simulation'slimited resolution. a study of a higher resolution, smaller volume simulationsuggests that this dependence is caused by the fact that all low luminosity redgalaxies are satellites in massive halos, whereas intermediate luminosity redgalaxies are a mixture of satellites in massive halos and central galaxies inless massive halos.

astro-ph;0509007	probing galaxy formation with he ii cooling lines	using high resolution cosmological simulations, we study hydrogen and heliumgravitational cooling radiation. we focus on the heii cooling lines, whicharise from gas with a different temperature history (t_max ~ 10^5k) than hiline emitting gas. we examine whether three major atomic cooling lines, hi1216a, heii 1640a and heii 304a are observable, finding that hi 1216a and heii1640a cooling emission at z=2-3 are potentially detectable with deep narrowband (r&gt;100) imaging and/or spectroscopy from the ground. while the expectedstrength of hi 1216a cooling emission depends strongly on the treatment of theself-shielded phase of the igm in the simulations, our predictions for the heii1640a line are more robust because the heii 1640a emissivity is negligiblebelow t~10^4.5 k and less sensitive to the uv background. although heii 1640acooling emission is fainter than hi 1216a by at least a factor of 10 and,unlike hi 1216a, might not be resolved spatially with current observationalfacilities, it is more suitable to study gas accretion in the galaxy formationprocess because it is optically thin and less contaminated by the recombinationlines from star-forming galaxies. the heii 1640a line can be used todistinguish among mechanisms for powering the so-called "lyman alpha blobs" --including gravitational cooling radiation, photoionization by stellarpopulations, and starburst-driven superwinds -- because (1) heii 1640a emissionis limited to very low metallicity (log(z/z_sun) &lt; -5.3) and population iiistars, and (2) the blob's kinematics are probed unambiguously through the heii1640a line width, which, for cooling radiation, is narrower (sigma &lt; 400 km/s)than typical wind speeds.

astro-ph;0510625	building galaxies with simulations	we present an overview of some of the issues surrounding current models ofgalaxy formation, highlighting recent insights obtained from cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulations. detailed examination of gas accretion processes showa hot mode of gas cooling from near the halo's virial temperature, and apreviously underappreciated cold mode where gas flows in along filaments ondynamical timescales, emitting its energy in line radiation. cold modedominates in systems with halo masses slightly smaller than the milky way andbelow, and hence dominates the global accretion during the heydey of galaxyformation. this rapid accretion path enables prompt assembly of massivegalaxies in the early universe, and results in $z\sim 4$ galaxy properties inbroad agreement with observations, with the most massive galaxies being themost rapid star formers. massive galaxies today are forming stars at a muchreduced rate, a trend called downsizing. the trend of downsizing is naturallyreproduced in simulations, owing to a transition from cold mode accretion inthe early growth phase to slower hot mode accretion once their halos growlarge. however, massive galaxies at the present epoch are still observed tohave considerably redder colors than simulations suggest, suggesting that starformation is not sufficiently truncated in models by the transition to hotmode, and that another process not included in current simulations is requiredto suppress star formation.

astro-ph;0511532	the physical properties and detectability of reionization-epoch galaxies	we present predictions drawn from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations forthe physical, photometric and emission line properties of galaxies presentduring the latter stages of reionization from z=9-6. we find significantnumbers of galaxies that have stellar masses exceeding 10^8 mo during thisepoch, with metallicities exceeding one-thirtieth solar. far from primeval"first-star" objects,these objects are likely to have reionized their infallregions prior to z=9, are dominated by atomic rather than molecular cooling,and are not expected to be forming population iii stars. galaxies exhibit aslowly evolving comoving autocorrelation length from z=9-6, continuing a trendseen at lower redshifts in which the rapidly dropping bias counteracts therapidly increasing matter clustering. these sources can be marginally detectedusing current instruments, but modest increases in sensitivity or survey areawould yield significantly increased samples. we compare to current observationsof the z~6 rest-uv and ly-alpha line luminosity functions, and find goodagreement. we also compare with the z~7 object observed by egami et al., andfind that such systems are ubiquitous in our simulations. the intrinsicly-alpha luminosity function evolves slowly from z=9-6, meaning that it shouldalso be possible to detect these objects with upcoming narrow band surveys suchas dazle. we make predictions for near-ir surveys with jwst, and show thatwhile a high density of sources will be found, population iii objects mayremain elusive. we present and compare simulations with several recipes forsuperwind feedback, and show that while our broad conclusions are insensitiveto this choice, a feedback model based on momentum-driven winds is favored incomparisons with available data.

astro-ph;0511580	from galaxy-galaxy lensing to cosmological parameters	galaxy-galaxy lensing measures the mean excess surface density ds(r) around asample of lensing galaxies. we develop a method for combining ds(r) with thegalaxy correlation function xi_gg(r) to constrain omega_m and sigma_8, goingbeyond the linear bias model to reach the level of accuracy demanded by currentand future measurements. we adopt the halo occupation distribution (hod)framework, and we test its applicability to this problem by examining theeffects of replacing satellite galaxies in the halos of an sph simulation withrandomly selected dark matter particles from the same halos. the differencebetween dark matter and satellite galaxy radial profiles has a ~10% effect onds(r) at r&lt;1 mpc/h. however, if radial profiles are matched, the remainingimpact of individual subhalos around satellite galaxies and environmentaldependence of the hod at fixed halo mass is &lt;5% in ds(r) for 0.1&lt;r&lt;15 mpc/h. wedevelop an analytic approximation for ds(r) that incorporates halo exclusionand scale-dependent halo bias, and we demonstrate its accuracy with testsagainst a suite of populated n-body simulations. we use the analytic model toinvestigate the dependence of ds(r) and the galaxy-matter correlation functionxi_gm(r) on omega_m and sigma_8, once hod parameters for a given cosmologicalmodel are pinned down by matching xi_gg(r). the linear bias prediction isaccurate for r&gt;2 mpc/h, but it fails at the 30-50% level on smaller scales. thescaling of ds(r) ~ omega_m^a(r) sigma_8^b(r) approaches the linear biasexpectation a=b=1 at r&gt;10 mpc/h, but a(r) and b(r) vary from 0.8 to 1.6 atsmaller r. we calculate a fiducial ds(r) and scaling indices a(r) and b(r) fortwo sdss galaxy samples; galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements for these samplescan be combined with our predictions to constrain omega_m and sigma_8.

astro-ph;0604393	baryon dynamics, dark matter substructure, and galaxies	by comparing a collisionless cosmological n-body simulation (dm) to an sphsimulation with the same initial conditions, we investigate the correspondencebetween the dark matter subhalos produced by collisionless dynamics and thegalaxies produced by dissipative gas dynamics in a dark matter background. whengalaxies in the sph simulation become satellites in larger groups, they retainlocal dark matter concentrations (sph subhalos) whose mass is typically fivetimes their baryonic mass. the more massive subhalos of the sph simulation havecorresponding subhalos of similar mass and position in the dm simulation; atlower masses, there is fairly good correspondence, but some dm subhalos are indifferent spatial positions and some suffer tidal stripping or disruption. thehalo occupation statistics of dm subhalos -- the mean number of subhalos,pairs, and triples as a function of host halo mass -- are very similar to thoseof sph subhalos and sph galaxies. gravity of the dissipative baryon componentamplifies the density contrast of subhalos in the sph simulation, making themmore resistant to tidal disruption. relative to sph galaxies and sph subhalos,the dm subhalo population is depleted in the densest regions of the mostmassive halos. the good agreement of halo occupation statistics between the dmsubhalo and sph galaxy populations leads to good agreement of their two-pointcorrelation functions and higher order moments on large scales. the depletionof dm subhalos in dense regions depresses their clustering at r&lt;1 mpc/h. inthese simulations, the "conversation" between dark matter and baryons is mostlyone-way, with dark matter dynamics telling galaxies where to form and how tocluster, but the "back talk" of the baryons influences small scale clusteringby enhancing the survival of substructure in the densest environments.

astro-ph;0605651	cosmological simulations of intergalactic medium enrichment from  galactic outflows	we investigate models of self-consistent chemical enrichment of theintergalactic medium (igm) from z=6 to 1.5, based on hydrodynamic simulationsof structure formation that incorporate galactic outflows. our main result isthat outflow parameterizations based on momentum-driven winds as seen in localstarburst galaxies provide the best agreement with observations of civabsorption at z~2-5. such models sufficiently enrich the high-z igm to producea global mass density of civ absorbers that is relatively invariant from z=5.5to 1.5, in agreement with observations. this occurs despite an increase in thevolume-averaged metallicity by x5-10 over this redshift range, because energyinput from outflows causes a drop in the global ionization fraction of civ.comparisons to observed civ column density and linewidth distributions andciv-based pixel optical depth ratios provide significant constraints on windmodels. our best-fitting models show mean igm temperatures only slightly aboveour no-outflow case, metal filling factors of just a few % with volume-weightedmetallicities around 0.001 at z~3, significant amounts of collisionally-ionizedciv absorption, and a metallicity-density relationship that rises rapidly atlow overdensities and flattens at higher ones. in general, we find that outflowspeeds must be high enough to enrich the low-density igm at early times but lowenough not to overheat it, and concurrently must significantly suppress earlystar formation while still producing enough early metals. it is thereforenon-trivial that locally-calibrated momentum-driven wind scenarios naturallyyield the desired strength and evolution of outflows, and suggest that suchmodels represent a significant step towards understanding the impact ofgalactic outflows on galaxies and the igm across cosmic time.

0811.3446	extended lyman alpha nebulae at z ~ 2.3: an extremely rare and strongly  clustered population?	to obtain an unbiased sample of bright lya blobs [l(lya) &gt; 10^43 ergs/s], wehave undertaken a blind, wide-field, narrow-band imaging survey in the noaodeep wide field survey bootes field with the steward bok-2.3m telescope. aftersearching over 4.82 sq. degrees at z=2.3, we discover four lya blobs withl(lya) = 1.6-5.3 x 10^43 ergs/s, isophotal areas of 28-57 sq. arcsec, and broadlya line profiles (fwhm = 900-1250 km/s). in contrast with the extended lymanalpha halos associated with high-z radio galaxies, none of our four blobs areradio-loud. the x-ray luminosities and optical spectra of these blobs arediverse. two blobs (3 and 4) are x-ray-detected with l_x(2-7 kev) = 2-4 x 10^44ergs/s and have broad optical emission lines (c iv) characteristic of agn,implying that 50% of our sample blobs are associated with strong agn. the other50% of blobs (1 and 2) are not x-ray or optically-detected as agn down tosimilar limits. the number density of the four blobs is ~3 x 10^{-6} mpc^{-3},comparable to that of galaxy clusters at similar redshifts and 3x lower thanthat found in the ssa22 proto-cluster at z=3.1, even after accounting for theover-density of that region. the two x-ray undetected blobs are separated byonly 70" (550 kpc) and have almost identical redshifts (&lt; 360 kpc along theline-of-sight), suggesting that they are part of the same system. given therarity of the blobs and our discovery of a close pair, we speculate that blobsoccupy the highest density regions and thus may be precursors of today's richcluster galaxies.
