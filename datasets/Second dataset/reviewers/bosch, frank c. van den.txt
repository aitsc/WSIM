0901.1150	structural properties of central galaxies in groups and clusters	using a representative sample of 911 central galaxies (cens) from the sdssdr4 group catalogue, we study how the structure of the most massive members ingroups and clusters depend on (1) galaxy stellar mass (mstar), (2) dark matterhalo mass of the host group (mhalo), and (3) their halo-centric position. weestablish and thoroughly test a galfit-based pipeline to fit 2d sersic modelsto sdss data. we find that the fitting results are most sensitive to thebackground sky level determination and strongly recommend using the sdss globalvalue. we find that uncertainties in the background translate into a strongcovariance between the total magnitude, half-light size (r50), and sersic index(n), especially for bright/massive galaxies. we find that n depends strongly onmstar for cens, but only weakly or not at all on mhalo. less (more) massivecens tend to be disk (spheroid)-like over the full mhalo range. likewise, thereis a clear r50-mstar relation for cens, with separate slopes for disks andspheroids. when comparing cens with satellite galaxies (sats), we find that lowmass (&lt;10e10.75 msun/h^2) sats have larger median n than cens of similar mstar.low mass, late-type sats have moderately smaller r50 than late-type cens of thesame mstar. however, we find no size differences between spheroid-like cens andsats, and no structural differences between cens and sats matched in both massand colour. the similarity of massive sats and cens shows that this distinctionhas no significant impact on the structure of spheroids. we conclude that mstaris the most fundamental property determining the basic structure of a galaxy.the lack of a clear n-mhalo relation rules out a distinct group mass forproducing spheroids, and the responsible morphological transformation processesmust occur at the centres of groups spanning a wide range of masses.

0903.4682	constraints on the relationship between stellar mass and halo mass at  low and high redshift	we use a statistical approach to determine the relationship between thestellar masses of galaxies and the masses of the dark matter halos in whichthey reside. we obtain a parameterized stellar-to-halo mass (shm) relation bypopulating halos and subhalos in an n-body simulation with galaxies andrequiring that the observed stellar mass function be reproduced. we find goodagreement with constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and predictions ofsemi-analytic models. using this mapping, and the positions of the halos andsubhalos obtained from the simulation, we find that our model predictions forthe galaxy two-point correlation function (cf) as a function of stellar massare in excellent agreement with the observed clustering properties in the sdssat z=0. we show that the clustering data do not provide additional strongconstraints on the shm function and conclude that our model can thereforepredict clustering as a function of stellar mass. we compute the conditionalmass function, which yields the average number of galaxies with stellar massesin the range [m, m+dm] that reside in a halo of mass m. we study the redshiftdependence of the shm relation and show that, for low mass halos, the shm ratiois lower at higher redshift. the derived shm relation is used to predict thestellar mass dependent galaxy cf and bias at high redshift. our model predictsthat not only are massive galaxies more biased than low mass ones at allredshifts, but the bias increases more rapidly with increasing redshift formassive galaxies than for low mass ones. we present convenient fittingfunctions for the shm relation as a function of redshift, the conditional massfunction, and the bias as a function of stellar mass and redshift.

0903.4857	on the size and comoving mass density evolution of early-type galaxies	we present a simple, empirically motivated model that simultaneously predictsthe evolution of the mean size and the comoving mass density of massiveearly-type galaxies from z=2 to the present. first we demonstrate that somesize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuousemergence of early-type galaxies. sdss data reveal that in the present-dayuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass haveolder stellar populations. in contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,sdss data show that there is no relation between size and age, which impliesthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at whichgalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. applying sucha 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, wepredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving massdensity. the resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of theobserved evolution. then we include a prescription for the merger histories ofgalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based oncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. such mergersafter the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumablydissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to beapproximately proportional to the increase in mass. this model successfullyreproduces the observed evolution since z~2 in the mean size and in thecomoving mass density of massive early-type galaxies. we conclude that therecently measured, substantial size evolution of early-type galaxies can beexplained by the combined effect of the continuous emergence of galaxies asearly types and their subsequent growth through dry merging.

0911.0436	the substructure hierarchy in dark matter haloes	we present a new algorithm for identifying the substructure within simulateddark matter haloes. the method is an extension of that proposed by tormen etal. (2004) and giocoli et al. (2008a), which identifies a subhalo as a group ofself-bound particles that prior to being accreted by the main progenitor of thehost halo belonged to one and the same progenitor halo (hereafter satellite).however, this definition does not account for the fact that these satellitehaloes themselves may also have substructure, which thus gives rise tosub-subhaloes, etc. our new algorithm identifies substructures at all levels ofthis hierarchy, and we use it to determine the mass function of allsubstructure (counting sub-haloes, sub-subhaloes, etc.). on average, haloeswhich formed more recently tend to have a larger mass fraction in substructureand to be less concentrated than average haloes of the same mass. we providequantitative fits to these correlations. even though our algorithm is verydifferent from that of gao et al. (2004), we too find that the subhalo massfunction per unit mass at redshift z = 0 is universal. this universalityextends to any redshift only if one accounts for the fact that host haloes of agiven mass are less concentrated at higher redshifts, and concentration andsubstructure abundance are anti-correlated. this universality allows a simpleparametrization of the subhalo mass function integrated over all host halomasses, at any given time. we provide analytic fits to this function whichshould be useful in halo model analyses which equate galaxies with halosubstructure when interpreting clustering in large sky surveys. finally, wediscuss systematic differences in the subhalo mass function that arise fromdifferent definitions of (host) halo mass.

0912.1257	the stellar mass components of galaxies: comparing semi-analytical  models with observation	we compare the stellar masses of central and satellite galaxies predicted bythree independent semianalytical models with observational results obtainedfrom a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the sloan digital skysurvey. in particular, we compare the stellar mass functions of centrals andsatellites, the relation between total stellar mass and halo mass, and theconditional stellar mass functions, which specify the average number ofgalaxies of stellar mass m_* that reside in a halo of mass m_h. thesemi-analytical models only predict the correct stellar masses of centralgalaxies within a limited mass range and all models fail to reproduce the sharpdecline of stellar mass with decreasing halo mass observed at the low mass end.in addition, all models over-predict the number of satellite galaxies byroughly a factor of two. the predicted stellar mass in satellite galaxies canbe made to match the data by assuming that a significant fraction of satellitegalaxies are tidally stripped and disrupted, giving rise to a population ofintra-cluster stars in their host halos. however, the amount of intra-clusterstars thus predicted is too large compared to observation. this suggests thatcurrent galaxy formation models still have serious problems in modeling starformation in low-mass halos.

0912.1853	stellar ages and metallicities of central and satellite galaxies:  implications for galaxy formation and evolution	using a large sdss galaxy group catalogue, we study how the stellar ages andmetallicities of central and satellite galaxies depend on stellar mass and halomass. we find that satellites are older and metal-richer than centrals of thesame stellar mass. in addition, the slopes of the age-stellar mass andmetallicity-stellar mass relations are found to become shallower in denserenvironments. this is due to the fact that the average age and metallicity oflow mass satellite galaxies increase with the mass of the halo in which theyreside. a comparison with the semi-analytical model of wang et al. (2008) showsthat it succesfully reproduces the fact that satellites are older than centralsof the same stellar mass and that the age difference increases with the halomass of the satellite. this is a consequence of strangulation, which leaves thestellar populations of satellites to evolve passively, while the prolonged starformation activity of centrals keeps their average ages younger. the resultingage offset is larger in more massive environments because their satellites wereaccreted earlier. the model fails, however, in reproducing the halo massdependence of the metallicities of low mass satellites, yieldsmetallicity-stellar mass and age-stellar mass relations that are too shallow,and predicts that satellite galaxies have the same metallicities as centrals ofthe same stellar mass, in disagreement with the data. we argue that thesediscrepancies are likely to indicate the need to (i) modify the recipes of bothsupernova feedback and agn feedback, (ii) use a more realistic description ofstrangulation, and (iii) include a proper treatment of the tidal stripping,heating and destruction of satellite galaxies.

0912.2169	on the origin of the galaxy star-formation-rate sequence: evolution and  scatter	we use a semi-analytic model for disk galaxies to explore the origin of thetime evolution and small scatter of the galaxy sfr sequence -- the tightcorrelation between star-formation rate (sfr) and stellar mass (m_star). thesteep decline of sfr from z~2 to the present, at fixed m_star, is a consequenceof the following: first, disk galaxies are in a steady state with the sfrfollowing the net (i.e., inflow minus outflow) gas accretion rate. theevolution of the sfr sequence is determined by evolution in the cosmologicalspecific accretion rates, \propto (1+z)^{2.25}, but is found to be independentof feedback. although feedback determines the outflow rates, it shifts galaxiesalong the sfr sequence, leaving its zero point invariant. second, theconversion of accretion rate to sfr is materialized through gas density, notgas mass. although the model sfr is an increasing function of both gas massfraction and gas density, only the gas densities are predicted to evolvesignificantly with redshift. third, star formation is fueled by molecular gas.since the molecular gas fraction increases monotonically with increasing gasdensity, the model predicts strong evolution in the molecular gas fractions,increasing by an order of magnitude from z=0 to z~2. on the other hand, themodel predicts that the effective surface density of atomic gas is ~10 m_sunpc^{-2}, independent of redshift, stellar mass or feedback. our model suggeststhat the scatter in the sfr sequence reflects variations in the gas accretionhistory, and thus is insensitive to stellar mass, redshift or feedback. thelarge scatter in halo spin contributes negligibly, because it scatters galaxiesalong the sfr sequence. an observational consequence of this is that thescatter in the sfr sequence is independent of the size (both stellar andgaseous) of galaxy disks.

1001.4533	are brightest halo galaxies central galaxies?	it is generally assumed that the central galaxy in a dark matter halo, thatis, the galaxy with the lowest specific potential energy, is also the brightesthalo galaxy (bhg), and that it resides at rest at the centre of the dark matterpotential well. this central galaxy paradigm (cgp) is an essential assumptionmade in various fields of astronomical research. in this paper we test thevalidity of the cgp using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from thesloan digital sky survey. for each group we compute two statistics, ${\cal r}$and ${\cal s}$, which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities andprojected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other groupmembers. by comparing the cumulative distributions of $|{\cal r}|$ and $|{\cals}|$ to those obtained from detailed mock group catalogues, we rule out thenull-hypothesis that the cgp is correct. rather, the data indicate that in anon-zero fraction $f_{\rm bnc}(m)$ of all haloes of mass $m$ the bhg is not thecentral galaxy, but instead, a satellite galaxy. in particular, we find that$f_{\rm bnc}$ increases from $\sim 0.25$ in low mass haloes ($10^{12} h^{-1}{\rm m_{\odot}} \leq m \lsim 2 \times 10^{13} h^{-1}{\rm m_{\odot}}$) to $\sim0.4$ in massive haloes ($m \gsim 5 \times 10^{13} h^{-1} {\rm m_{\odot}}$). weshow that these values of $f_{\rm bnc}$ are uncomfortably high compared topredictions from halo occupation statistics and from semi-analytical models ofgalaxy formation. we end by discussing various implications of a non-zero$f_{\rm bnc}(m)$, with an emphasis on the halo masses inferred from satellitekinematics.

0707.4640	galaxy groups in the sdss dr4: i. the catalogue and basic properties	we use a modified version of the halo-based group finder developed by yang etal. to select galaxy groups from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss dr4). inthe first step, a combination of two methods is used to identify the centers ofpotential groups and to estimate their characteristic luminosity. using aniterative approach, the adaptive group finder then uses the averagemass-to-light ratios of groups, obtained from the previous iteration, to assigna tentative mass to each group. this mass is then used to estimate the size andvelocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turnis used to determine group membership in redshift space. finally, eachindividual group is assigned two different halo masses: one based on itscharacteristic luminosity, and the other based on its characteristic stellarmass. applying the group finder to the sdss dr4, we obtain 301237 groups in abroad dynamic range, including systems of isolated galaxies. we use detailedmock galaxy catalogues constructed for the sdss dr4 to test the performance ofour group finder in terms of completeness of true members, contamination byinterlopers, and accuracy of the assigned masses. this paper is the first in aseries and focuses on the selection procedure, tests of the reliability of thegroup finder, and the basic properties of the group catalogue (e.g. themass-to-light ratios, the halo mass to stellar mass ratios, etc.). the groupcatalogues including the membership of the groups are available athttp://gax.shao.ac.cn/data/group.html andhttp://www.astro.umass.edu/~xhyang/group.html

1003.3203	satellite kinematics iii: halo masses of central galaxies in sdss	we use the kinematics of satellite galaxies that orbit around the centralgalaxy in a dark matter halo to infer the scaling relations between halo massand central galaxy properties. using galaxies from the sloan digital skysurvey, we investigate the halo mass-luminosity relation (mlr) and the halomass-stellar mass relation (msr) of central galaxies. in particular, we focuson the dependence of these scaling relations on the colour of the centralgalaxy. we find that red central galaxies on average occupy more massive haloesthan blue central galaxies of the same luminosity. however, at fixed stellarmass there is no appreciable difference in the average halo mass of red andblue centrals, especially for m* $\lsim$ 10^{10.5} h^{-2} msun. this indicatesthat stellar mass is a better indicator of halo mass than luminosity.nevertheless, we find that the scatter in halo masses at fixed stellar mass isnon-negligible for both red and blue centrals. it increases as a function ofstellar mass for red centrals but shows a fairly constant behaviour for bluecentrals. we compare the scaling relations obtained in this paper with resultsfrom other independent studies of satellite kinematics, with results from asdss galaxy group catalog, from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements, andfrom subhalo abundance matching studies. overall, these different techniquesyield mlrs and msrs in fairly good agreement with each other (typically withina factor of two), indicating that we are converging on an accurate and reliabledescription of the galaxy-dark matter connection. we briefly discuss some ofthe remaining discrepancies among the various methods.

1004.4626	the kinematic connection between galaxies and dark matter haloes	using estimates of dark halo masses from satellite kinematics, weakgravitational lensing, and halo abundance matching, combined with thetully-fisher and faber-jackson relations, we derive the mean relation betweenthe optical, v_opt, and virial, v_200, circular velocities of early- andlate-type galaxies at redshift z~0. for late-type galaxies v_opt ~ v_200 overthe velocity range v_opt=90-260 km/s, and is consistent with v_opt = v_maxh(the maximum circular velocity of nfw dark matter haloes in the concordancelcdm cosmology). however, for early-type galaxies v_opt \ne v_200, with theexception of early-type galaxies with v_opt simeq 350 km/s. this isinconsistent with early-type galaxies being, in general, globally isothermal.for low mass (v_opt &lt; 250 km/s) early-types v_opt &gt; v_maxh, indicating thatbaryons have modified the potential well, while high mass (v_opt &gt; 400 km/s)early-types have v_opt &lt; v_maxh. folding in measurements of the black hole mass- velocity dispersion relation, our results imply that the supermassive blackhole - halo mass relation has a logarithmic slope which varies from ~1.4 athalo masses of ~10^{12} msun/h to ~0.65 at halo masses of 10^{13.5} msun/h. thevalues of v_opt/v_200 we infer for the milky way and m31 are lower than thevalues currently favored by direct observations and dynamical models. thisoffset is due to the fact that the milky way and m31 have higher v_opt andlower v_200 compared to typical late-type galaxies of the same stellar masses.we show that current high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulationsare unable to form galaxies which simultaneously reproduce both the v_opt/v_200ratio and the v_opt-m_star (tully-fisher/faber-jackson) relation.

1004.5593	equilibrium initialization and stability of three-dimensional gas disks	we present a new systematic way of setting up galactic gas disks based on theassumption of detailed hydrodynamic equilibrium. to do this, we need to specifythe density distribution and the velocity field which supports the disk. wefirst show that the required circular velocity has no dependence on the heightabove or below the midplane so long as the gas pressure is a function ofdensity only. the assumption of disks being very thin enables us to decouplethe vertical structure from the radial direction. based on that, the equationof hydrostatic equilibrium together with the reduced poisson equation leads totwo sets of second-order non-linear differential equation, which are easilyintegrated to set-up a stable disk. we call one approach `density method' andthe other one `potential method'. gas disks in detailed balance are especiallysuitable for investigating the onset of the gravitational instability. werevisit the question of global, axisymmetric instability using fullythree-dimensional disk simulations. the impact of disk thickness on the diskinstability and the formation of spontaneously induced spirals is studiedsystematically with or without the presence of the stellar potential. in ourmodels, the numerical results show that the threshold value for diskinstability is shifted from unity to 0.69 for self-gravitating thick disks andto 0.75 for combined stellar and gas thick disks. the simulations also showthat self-induced spirals occur in the correct regions and with the rightnumbers as predicted by the analytic theory.

1006.3558	on the evolution of the velocity-mass-size relations of disk-dominated  galaxies over the past 10 billion years	we study the evolution of the scaling relations between maximum circularvelocity, stellar mass and optical half-light radius of star-formingdisk-dominated galaxies in the context of lcdm-based galaxy formation models.using data from the literature combined with new data from the deep2 and aegissurveys we show that there is a consistent observational and theoreticalpicture for the evolution of these scaling relations from z\sim 2 to z=0. theevolution of the observed stellar scaling relations is weaker than that of thevirial scaling relations of dark matter haloes, which can be reproduced, bothqualitatively and quantitatively, with a simple, cosmologically-motivated modelfor disk evolution inside growing nfw dark matter haloes. in this model opticalhalf-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circularvelocity, at higher redshifts. this model also predicts that the scalingrelations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than thecorresponding stellar relations. we emphasize, though, that this weak evolutiondoes not imply that individual galaxies evolve weakly. on the contrary,individual galaxies grow strongly in mass, size and velocity, but in such a waythat they move largely along the scaling relations. finally, recentobservations have claimed surprisingly large sizes for a number of star-formingdisk galaxies at z \sim 2, which has caused some authors to suggest that highredshift disk galaxies have abnormally high spin parameters. however, we arguethat the disk scale lengths in question have been systematically overestimatedby a factor \sim 2, and that there is an offset of a factor \sim 1.4 betweenh\alpha sizes and optical sizes. taking these effects into account, there is noindication that star forming galaxies at high redshifts (z\sim 2) haveabnormally high spin parameters.

1006.4760	probing hot gas in galaxy groups through the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	we investigate the potential of exploiting the sunyaev-zeldovich effect (sze)to study the properties of hot gas in galaxy groups. it is shown that, withupcoming sze surveys, one can stack sze maps around galaxy groups of similarhalo masses selected from large galaxy redshift surveys to study the hot gas inhalos represented by galaxy groups. we use various models for the hot halo gasto study how the expected sze signals are affected by gas fraction, equation ofstate, halo concentration, and cosmology. comparing the model predictions withthe sensitivities expected from the spt, act and planck surveys shows that aspt-like survey can provide stringent constraints on the hot gas properties forhalos with masses m ~&gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}msun. we also explore the idea of usingthe cross correlation between hot gas and galaxies of different luminosity toprobe the hot gas in dark matter halos without identifying galaxy groups torepresent dark halos. our results show that, with a galaxy survey as large asthe sloan digital sky survey and with the help of the conditional luminosityfunction (clf) model, one can obtain stringent constraints on the hot gasproperties in halos with masses down to 10^{13} h^{-1}msun. thus, the upcomingsze surveys should provide a very promising avenue to probe the hot gas inrelatively low-mass halos where the majority of l*-galaxies reside.

1006.5717	the dependence of agn activity on stellar and halo mass in semi-analytic  models	agn feedback is believed to play an important role in shaping a variety ofobserved galaxy properties, as well as the evolution of their stellar massesand star formation rates. in particular, in the current theoretical paradigm ofgalaxy formation, agn feedback is believed to play a crucial role in regulatingthe levels of activity in galaxies, in relatively massive halos at lowredshift. only in recent years, however, has detailed statistical informationon the dependence of galaxy activity on stellar mass, parent halo mass andhierarchy has become available. in this paper, we compare the fractions ofgalaxies belonging to different activity classes (star-forming, agn and radioactive) with predictions from four different and independently developedsemi-analytical models. we adopt empirical relations to convert physicalproperties into observables (h_alpha emission lines, oiii line strength andradio power). we demonstrate that all models used in this study reproduce theoverall distributions of galaxies belonging to different activity classes as afunction of stellar mass and halo mass: star forming galaxies and the strongestradio sources are preferentially associated with low-mass and high-massgalaxies/halos respectively. however, model predictions differ fromobservational measurements in a number of ways. all models used in our studypredict that almost every &gt;1.e12 msun dark matter halo and/or &gt;1.e11 msungalaxy should host a bright radio source, while only a small fraction ofgalaxies belong to this class in the data. in addition, radio brightness isexpected to depend strongly on the mass of the parent halo mass in the models,while strong and weak radio galaxies are found in similar environments in data.our results highlight that the distribution of agn as a function of stellarmass provides one of the most promising discriminants between different gasaccretion schemes.

1007.0023	an improved model for the dynamical evolution of dark matter subhaloes	using an analytical model, we study the evolution of subhalo, including itsmass, angular momentum and merging time-scale. this model considers thedominant processes governing subhalo evolution, such as dynamical friction,tidal stripping and tidal heating. we find that in order to best match theevolution of angular momentum measured from n-body simulation, mass strippingby tidal force should become inefficient after subhalo has experienced a fewpassages of pericenter. it is also found that the often used coulomb logarithm$\ln m/m$ has to be revised to best fit the merging time-scales fromsimulation. combining the analytical model with the extended press-schechter(eps) based merger trees, we study the subhalo mass function, and their spatialdistribution in a milky-way (mw) type halo. by tuning the tidal strippingefficiency, we can gain a better match to the subhalo mass function fromsimulation. the predicted distribution of subhaloes is found to agree with thedistribution of mw satellites, but is more concentrated than the simulationresults. the radial distribution of subhaloes depends weakly on subhaloes massat both present day and the time of accretion, but strongly on the accretiontime. using the improved model, we measure the second moment of the subhalooccupation distribution, and it agrees well with the results of kravtsov et al.(2004a) and zheng et al.

1012.5859	dark halo response and the stellar initial mass function in early-type  and late-type galaxies	we investigate the origin of the relations between stellar mass and opticalcircular velocity for early-type (etg) and late-type (ltg) galaxies --- thefaber-jackson (fj) and tully-fisher (tf) relations. we combine measurements ofdark halo masses (from satellite kinematics and weak lensing), and thedistribution of baryons in galaxies (from a new compilation of galaxy scalingrelations), with constraints on dark halo structure from cosmologicalsimulations. the principle unknowns are the halo response to galaxy formationand the stellar initial mass function (imf). the slopes of the tf and fjrelations are naturally reproduced for a wide range of halo response and imfs.however, models with a universal imf and universal halo response cannotsimultaneously reproduce the zero points of both the tf and fj relations. for amodel with a universal chabrier imf, ltgs require halo expansion, while etgsrequire halo contraction. a salpeter imf is permitted for high mass (sigma &gt;180 km/s) etgs, but is inconsistent for intermediate masses, unlessv_circ(r_e)/sigma_e &gt; 1.6. if the imf is universal and close to chabrier, wespeculate that the presence of a major merger may be responsible for thecontraction in etgs while clumpy accreting streams and/or feedback leads toexpansion in ltgs. alternatively, a recently proposed variation in the imfdisfavors halo contraction in both types of galaxies. finally we show that ourmodels naturally reproduce flat and featureless circular velocity profileswithin the optical regions of galaxies without fine-tuning.

1108.0663	the angular momentum of disc galaxies: implications for gas accretion,  outflows, and dynamical friction	we combine constraints on the galaxy-dark matter connection with structuraland dynamical scaling relations to investigate the angular momentum content ofdisc galaxies. for haloes with masses in the interval 10^{11.3} &lt; m_vir/m_sun &lt;10^{12.7} we find that the galaxy spin parameters are independent of halo masswith &lt;\lambda'_gal&gt; = (j_gal/m_gal) / (\sqrt{2} r_vir v_vir) =0.019^{+0.004}_{-0.003} (1sigma). this is significantly lower than for relaxedlcdm haloes, which have an average spin parameter &lt;\lambda'_halo&gt; = 0.031. theaverage ratio between the specific angular momentum of disk galaxies and theirhost dark matter haloes is therefore r_j = \lambda'_gal/\lambda'_halo =0.61^{+0.13}_{-0.10}. this calls into question a standard assumption made inthe majority of all (semi-analytical) models for (disc) galaxy formation,namely that r_j=1. using simple disc formation models we show that it isparticularly challenging to understand why r_j is independent of halo mass,while the galaxy formation efficiency (\epsilon_gf, proportional to the ratioof galaxy mass to halo mass) reveals a strong halo mass dependence. we arguethat the empirical scaling relations between \epsilon_gf, r_j and halo massrequire both feedback (i.e., galactic outflows) and angular momentum transferfrom the baryons to the dark matter (i.e., dynamical friction). the efficiencyof angular momentum loss need to decrease with increasing halo mass. such amass dependence may reflect a bias against forming stable discs in high mass,low spin haloes or a transition from cold-mode accretion in low mass haloes tohot-mode accretion at the massive end. however, current hydrodynamicalsimulations of galaxy formation, which should include these processes, seemunable to reproduce the empirical relation between \epsilon_gf and r_j. weconclude that the angular momentum build-up of galactic discs remains poorlyunderstood.

1108.1008	reconstructing the cosmic velocity and tidal fields with galaxy groups  selected from the sloan digital sky survey	[abridge]cosmic velocity and tidal fields are important for the understandingof the cosmic web and the environments of galaxies, and can also be used toconstrain cosmology. in this paper, we reconstruct these two fields in sdssvolume from dark matter halos represented by galaxy groups. detailed mockcatalogues are used to test the reliability of our method against uncertaintiesarising from redshift distortions, survey boundaries, and false identificationsof groups by our group finder. we find that both the velocity and tidal fields,smoothed on a scale of ~2mpc/h, can be reliably reconstructed in the innerregion (~66%) of the survey volume. the reconstructed tidal field is used tosplit the cosmic web into clusters, filaments, sheets, and voids, depending onthe sign of the eigenvalues of tidal tensor. the reconstructed velocity fieldnicely shows how the flows are diverging from the centers of voids, andconverging onto clusters, while sheets and filaments have flows that areconvergent along one and two directions, respectively. we use the reconstructedvelocity field and the zel'dovich approximation to predict the mass densityfield in the sdss volume as function of redshift, and find that the massdistribution closely follows the galaxy distribution even on small scales. wefind a large-scale bulk flow of about 117km/s in a very large volume,equivalent to a sphere with a radius of ~170mpc/h, which seems to be producedby the massive structures associated with the sdss great wall. finally, wediscuss potential applications of our reconstruction to study the environmentaleffects of galaxy formation, to generate initial conditions for simulations ofthe local universe, and to constrain cosmological models. the velocity, tidaland density fields in the sdss volume, specified on a cartesian grid with aspatial resolution of ~700kpc/h, are available from the authors upon request.

1108.1392	mass growth and mergers: direct observations of the luminosity function  of lrg satellite galaxies out to z=0.7 from sdss and boss images	we present a statistical study of the luminosity functions of galaxiessurrounding luminous red galaxies (lrgs) at average redshifts &lt;z&gt;=0.34 and&lt;z&gt;=0.65. the luminosity functions are derived by extracting source photometryaround more than 40,000 lrgs and subtracting foreground and backgroundcontamination using randomly selected control fields. we show that at bothstudied redshifts the average luminosity functions of the lrgs and theirsatellite galaxies are poorly fitted by a schechter function due to aluminosity gap between the centrals and their most luminous satellites. weutilize a two-component fit of a schechter function plus a log-normaldistribution to demonstrate that lrgs are typically brighter than their mostluminous satellite by roughly 1.3 magnitudes. this luminosity gap implies thatinteractions within lrg environments are typically restricted to minor mergerswith mass ratios of 1:4 or lower. the luminosity functions further imply thatroughly 35% of the mass in the environment is locked in the lrg itself,supporting the idea that mass growth through major mergers within theenvironment is unlikely. lastly, we show that the luminosity gap may be atleast partially explained by the selection of lrgs as the gap can be reproducedby sparsely sampling a schechter function. in that case lrgs may represent onlya small fraction of central galaxies in similar mass halos.

0710.2157	ongoing assembly of massive galaxies by major merging in large groups  and clusters from the sdss	we investigate the incidence of major mergers creating &gt;10e11 msun galaxiesin present-day groups and clusters more massive than 2.5e13 msun. we identify38 pairs of massive galaxies with mutual tidal interaction signatures selectedfrom &gt;5000 galaxies with &gt;5e10 msun that reside in 845 such groups. we fit theimages of each galaxy pair as the line-of-sight projection of symmetric modelsand identify mergers by the presence of residual asymmetries around eachprogenitor, such as off-center isophotes, broad tidal tails, and dynamicalfriction wakes. at the resolution and sensitivity of the sdss, such mergers arefound in 16% of high-mass, galaxy-galaxy pairs with magnitude differences of&lt;1.5 and &lt;30 kpc projected separations. we find that 90% of these mergers havenearly equal-mass progenitors with red-sequence colors andcentrally-concentrated morphologies, the hallmarks of dissipationless mergersimulations. mergers at group centers are more common than between 2satellites, but both are morphologically indistinguishable and we tentativelyconclude that the latter are likely located at the dynamical centers ofrecently accreted subhalos. the frequency of central and satellite mergingdiminishes with group mass consistent with dynamical friction expectations.based on reasonable assumptions, the centers of these massive halos are growingin stellar mass by 1-9% per gyr, on average. compared to all lrg-lrg mergers,we find a 2-9 times higher rate for their merging when restricted to thesedense environments. our results imply that the massive end of the galaxypopulation continues to evolve hierarchically at a measurable level, and thatthe centers of massive groups are the preferred environment for merger-drivengalaxy assembly.

1110.1420	evolution of the galaxy - dark matter connection and the assembly of  galaxies in dark matter halos	we present a new model to describe the galaxy-dark matter connection acrosscosmic time, which unlike the popular subhalo abundance matching technique isself-consistent in that it takes account of the facts that (i) subhalos areaccreted at different times, and (ii) the properties of satellite galaxies mayevolve after accretion. using observations of galaxy stellar mass functions outto $z \sim 4$, the conditional stellar mass function at $z\sim 0.1$ obtainedfrom sdss galaxy group catalogues, and the two-point correlation function(2pcf) of galaxies at $z \sim 0.1$ as function of stellar mass, we constrainthe relation between galaxies and dark matter halos over the entire cosmichistory from $z \sim 4$ to the present. this relation is then used to predictthe median assembly histories of different stellar mass components within darkmatter halos (central galaxies, satellite galaxies, and halo stars). we alsomake predictions for the 2pcfs of high-$z$ galaxies as function of stellarmass. our main findings are the following: (i) our model reasonably fits alldata within the observational uncertainties, indicating that the $\lambda$cdmconcordance cosmology is consistent with a wide variety of data regarding thegalaxy population across cosmic time.

0710.2618	probing the intrinsic shape and alignment of dark matter haloes using  sdss galaxy groups	we study the three-dimensional and projected shapes of galaxy groups in thesloan digital sky survey data release 4, and examine the alignment between theorientation of the central galaxy and the spatial distribution of satellitegalaxies. the projected ellipticity of a group is measured using the moments ofthe discrete distribution of its member galaxies. we infer thethree-dimensional and projected axis ratios of their dark matter haloes bycomparing the measured ellipticity distributions with those obtained from montecarlo simulations of projected, triaxial dark matter haloes with different axisratios. we find that the halo shape has a strong dependence on the halo mass.while the haloes of low-mass groups are nearly spherical, those of massivegroups tend to be prolate. for groups containing at least four members, thestatistical distribution of their measured ellipticities does not have a strongdependence on the colors of their central galaxies. our analysis further showsthat the average three-dimensional axis ratio for haloes with $12&lt;{\rmlog}[m/(h^{-1}m_{\odot})]\leq15$ is about $1:0.46:0.46$, resulting in aprojected axis ratio of $\sim 0.77$. our results for the alignment between theorientation of the central galaxy of a group and the distribution of theirsatellite galaxies are in broad agreement with those obtained by yang et al.the distribution of satellite galaxies preferentially aligns with the majoraxis of the central galaxy, with a clear dependence on both halo mass andgalaxy colors.

0710.3164	the importance of satellite quenching for the build-up of the red  sequence of present day galaxies	in the current paradigm, red sequence galaxies are believed to have formed asblue disk galaxies that subsequently had their star formation quenched. sincered-sequence galaxies typically have an early-type morphology, the transitionfrom the blue to the red sequence also involves a morphological transformation.in this paper we study the impact of transformation mechanisms that operateonly on satellite galaxies, such as strangulation, ram-pressure stripping andgalaxy harassment. using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from thesdss, we compare the colors and concentrations of satellites galaxies to thoseof central galaxies of the same stellar mass, adopting the hypothesis that thelatter are the progenitors of the former. on average, satellites are redder andmore concentrated than central galaxies of the same stellar mass.central-satellite pairs that are matched in both stellar mass and color,however, show no average concentration difference, indicating that thetransformation mechanisms affect color more than morphology. the color andconcentration differences of matched central-satellite pairs are completelyindependent of the halo mass of the satellite galaxy, indicating thatsatellite-specific transformation mechanisms are equally efficient in haloes ofall masses. this strongly favors strangulation as the main quenching mechanismfor satellite galaxies. finally, we determine the relative importance ofsatellite quenching for the build-up of the red sequence. we find that roughly70 percent of red sequence satellite galaxies with a stellar mass of 10^9 msunhad their star formation quenched as satellites. this drops rapidly to zerowith increasing stellar mass, indicating that a significant fraction of redsatellites were already quenched before they became a satellite.

0710.5096	galaxy groups in the sdss dr4: ii. halo occupation statistics	we investigate various halo occupation statistics using a large galaxy groupcatalogue constructed from the sdss dr4 with an adaptive halo-based groupfinder. the conditional luminosity function (clf) is measured separately forall, red and blue galaxies, as well as in terms of central and satellitegalaxies. the clfs for central and satellite galaxies can be well modelled witha log-normal distribution and a modified schechter form, respectively. about85% of the central galaxies and about 80% of the satellite galaxies in haloswith masses $m_h\ga 10^{14}\msunh$ are red galaxies. these numbers decrease to50% and 40%, respectively, in halos with $m_h \sim 10^{12}\msunh$. for halos ofa given mass, the distribution of the luminosities of central galaxies, $l_c$,has a dispersion of about 0.15 dex. the mean luminosity (stellar mass) of thecentral galaxies scales with halo mass as $l_c\propto m_h^{0.17}$($m_{*,c}\propto m_h^{0.22}$) for halos with masses $m\gg 10^{12.5}\msunh$, andboth relations are significantly steeper for less massive halos. we alsomeasure the luminosity (stellar mass) gap between the first and secondbrightest (most massive) member galaxies, $\log l_1 - \log l_2$ ($\logm_{*,1}-\log m_{*,2}$). these gap statistics, especially in halos with $m_h \la10^{14.0}\msunh$, indicate that the luminosities of central galaxies areclearly distinct from those of their satellites. the fraction of fossil groups,defined as those groups with $\log l_1 - \log l_2\ge 0.8$, ranges from $\sim2.5%$ for groups with $m_h\sim 10^{14}\msunh$ to 18-60% for groups with$m_h\sim 10^{13}\msunh$. finally, we measure the fraction of satellites, whichchanges from $\sim 5.0%$ for galaxies with $\rmag\sim -22.0$ to $\sim40%$ forgalaxies with $\rmag\sim -17.0$.

1203.2616	on combining galaxy clustering and weak lensing to unveil galaxy biasing  via the halo model	we formulate the concept of non-linear and stochastic galaxy biasing in theframework of halo occupation statistics. using two-point statistics inprojection, we define the galaxy bias function, b_g(r_p), and the galaxy-darkmatter cross-correlation function, r_{gm}(r_p), where r_p is the projecteddistance. we use the analytical halo model to predict how the scale dependenceof b_g and r_{gm}, over the range 0.1 mpc/h &lt; r_p &lt; 30 mpc/h, depends on thenon-linearity and stochasticity in halo occupation models. in particular wequantify the effect due to the presence of central galaxies, the assumption forthe radial distribution of satellite galaxies, the richness of the halo, andthe poisson character of the probability to have a certain number of satellitegalaxies in a halo of a certain mass. overall, brighter galaxies reveal astronger scale dependence, and out to a larger radius. in real-space, we findthat galaxy bias becomes scale independent, with r_{gm} = 1, for radii r &gt; 1 -5 mpc/h, depending on luminosity. however, galaxy bias is scale-dependent outto much larger radii when one uses the projected quantities defined in thispaper. these projected bias functions have the advantage that they are moreeasily accessible observationally and that their scale dependence carries awealth of information regarding the properties of galaxy biasing. toobservationally constrain the parameters of the halo occupation statistics andto unveil the origin of galaxy biasing we propose the use of the bias functiongamma_{gm}(r_p)=b_g(r_p)/r_{gm}(r_p). this function is obtained via acombination of weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering, and it can bemeasured using existing and forthcoming imaging and spectroscopic galaxysurveys.

1206.3458	the gas-phase metallicity of central and satellite galaxies in the sdss	we exploit the sdss galaxy groups catalogue of yang et al. to study how thegas-phase metallicities of star-forming galaxies depend on environment. we findthat satellite and central galaxies follow a qualitatively similar stellar mass(m_*) - gas-phase metallicity relation. satellites, though, have highergas-phase metallicities than equally massive centrals, and this differenceincreases with decreasing m_*. we also find that the gas-phase metallicity ofsatellites increases with halo mass at fixed stellar mass. this increment ismore pronounced for less massive galaxies. we also show that low mass satellitegalaxies have higher gas-phase metallicities than central galaxies of the samestellar metallicity. this difference becomes negligible for more massivegalaxies of roughly solar metallicity. we demonstrate that the observeddifferences in gas-phase metallicity between centrals and satellites at fixedm_* are not a consequence of stellar mass stripping (advocated by pasquali etal. in order to explain similar differences but in stellar metallicity), nor tothe past star formation history of these galaxies as quantified by theirsurface mass density or gas mass fraction. rather, we argue that these trendsprobably originate from a combination of three environmental effects: (i)strangulation, which prevents satellite galaxies from accreting new, lowmetallicity gas which would otherwise dilute their ism, (ii) ram-pressurestripping of the outer gas disk, thereby inhibiting radial inflows oflow-metallicity gas, and (iii) external pressure provided by the hot gas of thehost halo which prevents metal-enriched outflows from escaping the galaxies.[abridged]

1206.3571	galaxy evolution in groups and clusters: satellite star formation  histories and quenching timescales in a hierarchical universe	satellite galaxies in groups and clusters are more likely to have low starformation rates (sfr) and lie on the red-sequence than central (field)galaxies. using galaxy group/cluster catalogs from sdss dr7, together with acosmological n-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the starformation histories and quenching timescales of satellites of m_star &gt; 5 x 10^9m_sun at z=0. we first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessingand ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properlyaccounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z~0.5, or ~5 gyrago. to obtain accurate initial conditions for the sfrs of satellites at theirtime of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for theevolution of central galaxy sfrs and quiescent fractions. with this, weconstrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function ofsatellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominantprocess for building up all quiescent galaxies at m_star &lt; 10^10 m_sun. we thenconstrain satellite star formation histories, finding a 'delayed-then-rapid'quenching scenario: satellite sfrs evolve unaffected for 2-4 gyr after infall,after which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of &lt; 0.8gyr. these quenching timescales are shorter for more massive satellites but donot depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in satellite quiescentfraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in alower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsiblefor up to half of quenched satellites in massive clusters. because of the longtime delay before quenching starts, satellites experience significant stellarmass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies. this factprovides key physical insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.

1207.0503	cosmological constraints from a combination of galaxy clustering and  lensing -- iii. application to sdss data	we simultaneously constrain cosmology and galaxy bias using measurements ofgalaxy abundances, galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing taken from thesloan digital sky survey. we use the conditional luminosity function (whichdescribes the halo occupation statistics as function of galaxy luminosity)combined with the halo model (which describes the non-linear matter field interms of its halo building blocks) to describe the galaxy-dark matterconnection. we explicitly account for residual redshift space distortions inthe projected galaxy-galaxy correlation functions, and marginalize overuncertainties in the scale dependence of the halo bias and the detailedstructure of dark matter haloes. under the assumption of a spatially flat,vanilla {\lambda}cdm cosmology, we focus on constraining the matter density,{\omega}m, and the normalization of the matter power spectrum, {\sigma}8, andwe adopt wmap7 priors for the spectral index, the hubble parameter, and thebaryon density. we obtain that \omegam = 0.278_{-0.026}^{+0.023} and {\sigma}8= 0.763_{-0.049}^{+0.064} (95% cl). these results are robust to uncertaintiesin the radial number density distribution of satellite galaxies, while allowingfor non-poisson satellite occupation distributions results in a slightly lowervalue for {\sigma}8 (0.744_{-0.047}^{+0.056}). these constraints are inexcellent agreement (at the 1{\sigma} level) with the cosmic microwavebackground constraints from wmap. this demonstrates that the use of a realisticand accurate model for galaxy bias, down to the smallest non-linear scalescurrently observed in galaxy surveys, leads to results perfectly consistentwith the vanilla {\lambda}cdm cosmology.

0711.4431	the clustering of sdss galaxy groups: mass and color dependence	we use a sample of galaxy groups selected from the sdss dr 4 with an adaptivehalo-based group finder to probe how the clustering strength of groups dependson their masses and colors. in particular, we determine the relative biases ofgroups of different masses, as well as that of groups with the same mass butwith different colors. in agreement with previous studies, we find that moremassive groups are more strongly clustered, and the inferred mass dependence ofthe halo bias is in good agreement with predictions for the $\lambda$cdmcosmology. regarding the color dependence, we find that groups with redcentrals are more strongly clustered than groups of the same mass but with bluecentrals. similar results are obtained when the color of a group is defined tobe the total color of its member galaxies. the color dependence is moreprominent in less massive groups and becomes insignificant in groups withmasses $\gta 10^{14}\msunh$. we construct a mock galaxy redshift surveyconstructed from the large millenium simulation that is populated with galaxiesaccording to the semi-analytical model of croton et al. applying our groupfinder to this mock survey, and analyzing the mock data in exactly the same wayas the true data, we are able to accurately recover the intrinsic mass andcolor dependencies of the halo bias in the model. this suggests that our groupfinding algorithm and our method of assigning group masses do not inducespurious mass and/or color dependencies in the group-galaxy correlationfunction. the semi-analytical model reveals the same color dependence of thehalo bias as we find in our group catalogue. in halos with $m\sim10^{12}\msunh$, though, the strength of the color dependence is much strongerin the model than in the data.

0712.1563	the population of dark matter subhaloes: mass functions and average mass  loss rates	using a cosmological n-body simulation and a sample of re-simulatedcluster-like haloes, we study the mass loss rates of dark matter subhaloes, andinterpret the mass function of subhaloes at redshift zero in terms of theevolution of the mass function of systems accreted by the main halo progenitor.when expressed in terms of the ratio between the mass of the subhalo at thetime of accretion and the present day host mass the unevolved subhalo massfunction is found to be universal. however, the subhalo mass function atredshift zero clearly depends on $m_0$, in that more massive host haloes hostmore subhaloes. to relate the unevolved and evolved subhalo mass functions, wemeasure the subhalo mass loss rate as a function of host mass and redshift. wefind that the average, specific mass loss rate of dark matter subhaloes dependsmainly on redshift. these results suggest a pleasingly simple picture for theevolution and mass dependence of the evolved subhalo mass function. lessmassive host haloes accrete their subhaloes earlier, which are thus subjectedto mass loss for a longer time. in addition, their subhaloes are typicallyaccreted by denser hosts, which causes an additional boost of the mass lossrate. to test the self-consistency of this picture, we use a merger treesconstructed using the extended press-schechter formalism, and evolve thesubhalo populations using the average mass loss rates obtained from oursimulations, finding the subhalo mass functions to be in good agreement withthe simulations.

(2012), we make model predictions for thestar formation histories (sfhs) of {\it central} galaxies in halos of differentmasses. the model requires the following two key ingredients: (i) mass assemblyhistories of central and satellite galaxies, and (ii) local observationalconstraints of the star formation rates of central galaxies as function of halomass. we obtain a universal fitting formula that describes the (median) sfh ofcentral galaxies as function of halo mass, galaxy stellar mass and redshift. weuse this model to make predictions for various aspects of the star formationrates of central galaxies across cosmic time. our main findings are thefollowing. (1) the specific star formation rate (ssfr) at high $z$ increasesrapidly with increasing redshift [$\propto (1+z)^{2.5}$] for halos of a givenmass and only slowly with halo mass ($\propto m_h^{0.12}$) at a given $z$, inalmost perfect agreement with the specific mass accretion rate of dark matterhalos. (2) the ratio between the star formation rate (sfr) in the main-branchprogenitor and the final stellar mass of a galaxy peaks roughly at a constantvalue, $\sim 10^{-9.3} h^2 {\rm yr}^{-1}$, independent of halo mass or thefinal stellar mass of the galaxy. however, the redshift at which the sfr peaksincreases rapidly with halo mass. (3) more than half of the stars in thepresent-day universe were formed in halos with $10^{11.1}\msunh &lt; m_h &lt;10^{12.3}\msunh$ in the redshift range $0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.9$. (4) ... [abridged]

1306.0650	an empirical model for the star formation history in dark matter halos	we develop an empirical approach to infer the star formation rate in darkmatter halos from the galaxy stellar mass function (smf) at different redshiftsand the local cluster galaxy luminosity function (cglf), which has a steeperfaint end relative to the smf of local galaxies. as satellites are typicallyold galaxies which have been accreted earlier, this feature can cast importantconstraint on the formation of low-mass galaxies at high-redshift. theevolution of the smfs suggests the star formation in high mass halos($&gt;10^{12}m_{\odot}h^{-1}$) has to be boosted at high redshift beyond what isexpected from a simple scaling of the dynamical time. the faint end of the cglfimplies a characteristic redshift $z_c\approx2$ above which the star formationrate in low mass halos with masses $&lt; 10^{11}m_{\odot}h^{-1}$ must be enhancedrelative to that at lower z. this is not directly expected from the standardstellar feedback models. also, this enhancement leads to some interestingpredictions, for instance, a significant old stellar population in present-daydwarf galaxies with $m_* &lt; 10^8 m_{\odot}h^{-2}$ and steep slopes of highredshift stellar mass and star formation rate functions.

0801.1843	new constraints on the efficiencies of ram-pressure stripping and the  tidal disruption of satellite galaxies	using data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) it has recently beenshown that the red fraction of satellite galaxies increases with stellar mass.semi-analytical models, however, predict red satellite fractions that areindependent of stellar mass, and much higher than observed. it has been arguedthat this discrepancy owes to the fact that the models assume that satellitegalaxies are instantaneously stripped of their hot gas reservoirs at the momentthey are accreted into a bigger halo. in this letter we show that the fractionof red satellites can be brought in better agreement with the data by simplydecreasing this stripping efficiency. however, this also results in a redfraction of massive centrals that is much too low. this owes to the fact thatthe massive centrals now accrete satellite galaxies that are bluer and moregas-rich. however, if a significant fraction of low mass satellite galaxies istidally disrupted before being accreted by their central host galaxy, assuggested by recent studies, the red fractions of both centrals and satellitescan be reproduced reasonably well. a problem remains with the red fraction ofcentrals of intermediate mass, which is likely to reflect an oversimplifiedtreatment of agn feedback.

1309.3847	alignments of galaxies within cosmic filaments from sdss dr7	using a sample of galaxy groups selected from the sloan digital sky surveydata release 7 (sdss dr7), we examine the alignment between the orientation ofgalaxies and their surrounding large scale structure in the context of thecosmic web. the latter is quantified using the large-scale tidal field,reconstructed from the data using galaxy groups above a certain mass threshold.we find that the major axes of galaxies in filaments tend to be preferentiallyaligned with the directions of the filaments, while galaxies in sheets havetheir major axes preferentially aligned parallel to the plane of the sheets.the strength of this alignment signal is strongest for red, central galaxies,and in good agreement with that of dark matter halos in n-body simulations.this suggests that red, central galaxies are well aligned with their hosthalos, in quantitative agreement with previous studies based on the spatialdistribution of satellite galaxies. there is a luminosity and mass dependencethat brighter and more massive galaxies in filaments and sheets have strongeralignment signals. we also find that the orientation of galaxies is alignedwith the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue of the tidaltensor. these observational results indicate that galaxy formation is affectedby large-scale environments, and strongly suggests that galaxies are alignedwith each other over scales comparable to those of sheets and filaments in thecosmic web.

1311.1818	galaxy assembly bias: a significant source of systematic error in the  galaxy-halo relationship	it is common practice for methods that use galaxy clustering to constrain thegalaxy-halo relationship, such as the halo occupation distribution (hod) and/orconditional luminosity function (clf), to assume that halo mass alone sufficesto determine a halo's resident galaxy population. yet, the clustering strengthof cold dark matter halos depends upon halo properties in addition to mass,such as formation time, an effect referred to as assembly bias. if galaxycharacteristics are correlated with any of these auxiliary halo properties, thebasic assumption of hod/clf methods is violated. we estimate the potential forassembly bias to induce systematic errors in inferred halo occupationstatistics. we use halo abundance matching and age matching to constructfiducial mock galaxy catalogs that exhibit assembly bias as well as additionalmock catalogs with identical hods, but with assembly bias removed. we fit aparameterized hod to the projected two-point clustering of mock galaxies ineach catalog to assess the systematic errors induced by reasonable levels ofassembly bias. in the absence of assembly bias, the inferred hods generallydescribe the true underlying hods well, validating the basic methodology.however, in all of the cases with assembly bias, the inferred hods havesystematic errors that are statistically significant. in most cases, thesesystematic errors cannot be identified using void statistics as auxiliaryobservables. we conclude that the galaxy-halo relationship inferred from galaxyclustering should be subject to a non-negligible systematic error induced byassembly bias. our work suggests that efforts to model and/or constrainassembly bias should be high priorities as it is a threatening source ofsystematic error in galaxy evolution studies as well as the precision cosmologyprogram.

1311.5225	generating merger trees for dark matter haloes: a comparison of methods	halo merger trees describe the hierarchical mass assembly of dark matterhaloes, and are the backbone for modeling galaxy formation and evolution.merger trees constructed using monte carlo algorithms based on the extendedpress-schechter (eps) formalism are complementary to those extracted fromn-body simulations, and have the advantage that they are not trammeled bylimited numerical resolution and uncertainties in identifying (sub)haloes andlinking them between snapshots. this paper compares multiple eps-based mergertree algorithms to simulation results using four diagnostics: progenitor massfunction (pmf), mass assembly history (mah), merger rate per descendant halo,and the unevolved subhalo mass function (usmf). in general, algorithms based onspherical collapse yield major-merger rates that are too high by a factor oftwo, resulting in mahs that are systematically offset. assuming ellipsoidalcollapse solves most of these issues, but the particular algorithm investigatedhere that incorporates ellipsoidal collapse dramatically overpredicts theminor-merger rate for massive haloes. the only algorithm in our comparison thatyields mahs, merger rates, and usmfs in good agreement with simulations, isthat by parkinson et al. (2008). however, this is not a true eps-basedalgorithm as it draws its progenitor masses from a pmf calibrated againstsimulations, rather than `predicted' by eps. finally we emphasize that thebenchmarks used to test the eps algorithms are obtained from simulations andare hampered by significant uncertainties themselves. in particular, mahs andhalo merger rates obtained from simulations by different authors revealdiscrepancies that easily exceed 50 percent, even when based on the samesimulation. given this status quo, merger trees constructed using the parkinsonet al. algorithm are as accurate as those extracted from n-body simulations.

1403.1578	predicting galaxy star formation rates via the co-evolution of galaxies  and halos	in this paper, we test the age matching hypothesis that the star formationrate (sfr) of a galaxy of fixed stellar mass is determined by its dark matterhalo formation history, and as such, that more quiescent galaxies reside inolder halos. this simple model has been remarkably successful at predictingcolor-based galaxy statistics at low redshift as measured in the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss). to further test this method with observations, we presentnew sdss measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function andgalaxy-galaxy lensing as a function of stellar mass and sfr, separated intoquenched and star-forming galaxy samples. we find that our age matching modelis in excellent agreement with these new measurements. we also employ a galaxygroup finder and show that our model is able to predict: (1) the relative sfrsof central and satellite galaxies, (2) the sfr-dependence of the radialdistribution of satellite galaxy populations within galaxy groups, rich groups,and clusters and their surrounding larger scale environments, and (3) theinteresting feature that the satellite quenched fraction as a function ofprojected radial distance from the central galaxy exhibits an ~ r^-.15 slope,independent of environment. the accurate prediction for the spatialdistribution of satellites is intriguing given the fact that we do notexplicitly model satellite-specific processes after infall, and that in ourmodel the virial radius does not mark a special transition region in theevolution of a satellite, contrary to most galaxy evolution models. the successof the model suggests that present-day galaxy sfr is strongly correlated withhalo mass assembly history.

1403.6827	statistics of dark matter substructure: i. model and universal fitting  functions	we present a new, semi-analytical model describing the evolution of darkmatter subhaloes. the model uses merger trees constructed using the method ofparkinson et al. (2008) to describe the masses and redshifts of subhaloes ataccretion, which are subsequently evolved using a simple model for theorbit-averaged mass loss rates. the model is extremely fast, treats subhaloesof all orders, accounts for scatter in orbital properties and haloconcentrations, and uses a simple recipe to convert subhalo mass to maximumcircular velocity. the model accurately reproduces the average subhalo mass andvelocity functions in numerical simulations. the inferred subhalo mass lossrates imply that an average dark matter subhalo loses in excess of 80 percentof its infall mass during its first radial orbit within the host halo. wedemonstrate that the total mass fraction in subhaloes is tightly correlatedwith the `dynamical age' of the host halo, defined as the number of halodynamical times that have elapsed since its formation. using this relation, wepresent universal fitting functions for the evolved and unevolved subhalo massand velocity functions that are valid for any host halo mass, at any redshift,and for any {\lambda}cdm cosmology.

1403.6835	statistics of dark matter substructure: ii. comparison of model with  simulation results	we compare subhalo mass and velocity functions obtained from differentsimulations with different subhalo finders among each other, and withpredictions from the new semi-analytical model of jiang &amp; van den bosch (2014).we find that subhalo mass functions (shmfs) obtained using different subhalofinders agree with each other at the level of ~ 20 percent, but only at the lowmass end. at the massive end, subhalo finders that identify subhaloes basedpurely on density in configuration space dramatically underpredict the subhaloabundances by more than an order of magnitude. these problems are much lesssevere for subhalo velocity functions (shvfs), indicating that they arise fromissues related to assigning masses to the subhaloes, rather than from detectingthem. overall the predictions from the semi-analytical model are in excellentagreement with simulation results obtained using the more advanced subhalofinders that use information in six dimensional phase-space. in particular, themodel accurately reproduces the slope and host-mass-dependent normalization ofboth the subhalo mass and velocity functions. we find that the shmfs and shvfshave power-law slopes of 0.82 and 2.6, respectively, significantly shallowerthan what has been claimed in several studies in the literature.

1404.6524	beyond halo mass: galactic conformity as a smoking gun of central galaxy  assembly bias	quenched central galaxies tend to reside in a preferentially quenchedlarge-scale environment, a phenomenon that has been dubbed galactic conformity.remarkably, this tendency persists out to scales far larger than the virialradius of the halo hosting the central. therefore, conformity manifestlyviolates the widely adopted assumption that the dark matter halo mass mvirexclusively governs galaxy occupation statistics. this paper is the first in aseries studying the implications of the observed conformity signal for thegalaxy-dark matter connection. we show that recent measurements of conformityon scales r ~1-5 mpc imply that central galaxy quenching statistics cannot becorrectly predicted with the knowledge of mvir alone. we also demonstrate thatejected (or `backsplash') satellites cannot give rise to the signal. we theninvoke the age matching model, which is predicated on the co-evolution ofgalaxies and halos. we find that this model produces a strong signal, and thatcentral galaxies are solely responsible. we conclude that large-scale `2-halo'conformity represents a smoking gun of central galaxy assembly bias, andindicates that contemporary models of satellite quenching have systematicallyover-estimated the influence of post-infall processes.

0803.1213	reconstructing the cosmic density field with the distribution of dark  matter halos	we develop a new method to reconstruct the cosmic density field from thedistribution of dark matter haloes above a certain mass threshold. ourmotivation is that well-defined samples of galaxy groups/clusters, which can beused to represent the dark halo population, can now be selected from largeredshift surveys of galaxies, and our ultimate goal is to use such data toreconstruct the cosmic density field in the local universe. our reconstructionmethod starts with a sample of dark matter haloes above a given mass threshold.each volume element in space is assigned to the domain of the nearest haloaccording to a distance measure that is scaled by the virial radius of thehalo. the distribution of the mass in and around dark matter haloes of a givenmass is modelled using the cross-correlation function between dark matterhaloes and the mass distribution within their domains. we use n-bodycosmological simulations to show that the density profiles required in ourreconstruction scheme can be determined reliably from large cosmologicalsimulations, and that our method can reconstruct the density field accuratelyusing haloes with masses down to $\sim 10^{12}\msun$ (above which samples ofgalaxy groups can be constructed from current large redshift surveys ofgalaxies). working in redshift space, we demonstrate that the redshiftdistortions due to the peculiar velocities of haloes can be corrected in aniterative way. we also describe some applications of our method.

1406.5068	star formation and stellar mass assembly in dark matter halos: from  giants to dwarfs	the empirical model of lu et al. 2014 is updated with recent data and used tostudy galaxy star formation and assembly histories. at $z &gt; 2$, the predictedgalaxy stellar mass functions are steep, and a significant amount of starformation is hosted by low-mass haloes that may be missed in currentobservations. most of the stars in cluster centrals formed earlier than$z\approx 2$ but have been assembled much later. milky way mass galaxies havehad on-going star formation without significant mergers since $z\approx 2$, andare thus free of significant (classic) bulges produced by major mergers. inmassive clusters, stars bound in galaxies and scattered in the halo form ahomogeneous population that is old and with solar metallicity. in contrast, inmilky way mass systems the two components form two distinct populations, withhalo stars being older and poorer in metals by a factor of $\approx 3$. dwarfgalaxies in haloes with $m_{\rm h} &lt; 10^{11}h^{-1}m_{\odot}$ have experienced astar formation burst accompanied by major mergers at $z &gt; 2$, followed by anearly constant star formation rate after $z = 1$. the early burst leaves asignificant old stellar population that is distributed in spheroids.

1409.2750	coming of age in the dark sector: how dark matter haloes grow their  gravitational potential wells	we present a detailed study of how dark matter haloes assemble their mass andgrow their (central) potential well. we characterize these via their massaccretion histories (mahs) and potential well growth histories (pwghs), whichwe extract from the bolshoi simulation and from semi-analytical merger treessupplemented with a method to compute the maximum circular velocity, vmax, ofprogenitor haloes. the results of both methods are in excellent agreement, bothin terms of the average and the scatter. we show that the mah and pwgh aretightly correlated, and that growth of the central potential precedes theassembly of mass; the maximum circular velocity is already half the present dayvalue by the time the halo has accreted only 2 percent of its final mass.finally, we demonstrate that mahs have a universal form, which we use todevelop a new and improved universal model that can be used to compute theaverage or median mah and pwgh for a halo of any mass in any lcdm cosmology,without having to run a numerical simulation or a set of halo merger trees.

1502.03429	internal alignments of red versus blue discs in dark matter halos	large surveys have shown that red galaxies are preferentially aligned withtheir halos while blue galaxies have a more isotropic distribution. since halosgenerally align with their filaments this introduces a bias in the measurementof the cosmic shear from weak lensing. it is therefore vitally important tounderstand why this difference arises. we explore the stability of differentdisc orientations within triaxial halos. we show that, in the absence of gas,the disc orientation is most stable when its spin is along the minor axis ofthe halo. instead when gas cools onto a disc it is able to form in almostarbitrary orientation, including off the main planes of the halo (but avoidingan orientation perpendicular to the halo's intermediate axis). substructurehelps gasless galaxies reach alignment with the halo faster, but have lesseffect on galaxies when gas is cooling onto the disc. our results provide anovel and natural interpretation for why red, gas poor galaxies arepreferentially aligned with their halo, while blue, star-forming, galaxies havenearly random orientations, without requiring a connection between galaxies'current star formation rate and their merger history.

0805.0002	satellite ecology: the dearth of environment dependence	using the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) galaxy group catalogue of yang etal. (2007), we study the average colour and average concentration of satellitegalaxies as function of (i) their stellar mass, (ii) their group mass, and(iii) their group-centric radius. we find that the colours and concentrationsof satellite galaxies are (almost) completely determined by their stellar mass.in particular, at fixed stellar mass, the average colours and concentrations ofsatellite galaxies are independent of either halo mass or halo-centric radius.we find clear evidence for mass segregation of satellite galaxies in haloes ofall masses, and argue that this explains why satellites at smaller halo-centricradii are somewhat redder and somewhat more concentrated. in addition, the weakcolour and concentration dependence of satellite galaxies on halo mass issimply a reflection of the fact that more massive haloes host, on average, moremassive satellites. combining these results with the fact that satellitegalaxies are, on average, redder and somewhat more concentrated than centralgalaxies of the same stellar mass, the following picture emerges: galaxiesbecome redder and somewhat more concentrated once they fall into a bigger halo(i.e., once they become a satellite galaxy). this is a clear manifestation ofenvironment dependence. however, there is no indication that the magnitude ofthe transformation (or its timescale) depends on environment; a galaxyundergoes a transition when it becomes a satellite, but it does not matterwhether it becomes a satellite of a small (milky way sized) halo, or of amassive cluster. we discuss the implication of this `dearth' of environmentdependence for the physical processes responsible for transforming satellitegalaxies.

1504.05578	on the physical origin of galactic conformity	correlations between the star formation rates (sfrs) of nearby galaxies(so-called galactic conformity) have been observed for projected separations upto 4 mpc, an effect not predicted by current semi-analytic models. weinvestigate correlations between the mass accretion rates (dmvir/dt) of nearbyhalos as a potential physical origin for this effect. we find that pairs ofhost halos "know about" each others' assembly histories even when theirpresent-day separation is greater than thirty times the virial radius of eitherhalo. these distances are far too large for direct interaction between thehalos to explain the correlation in their dmvir/dt. instead, halo pairs atthese distances reside in the same large-scale tidal environment, whichregulates dmvir/dt for both halos. larger halos are less affected by externalforces, which naturally gives rise to a mass dependence of the halo conformitysignal. sdss measurements of galactic conformity exhibit a qualitativelysimilar dependence on stellar mass, including how the signal varies withdistance. based on the expectation that halo accretion and galaxy sfr arecorrelated, we predict the scale-, mass- and redshift-dependence of large-scalegalactic conformity, finding that the signal should drop to undetectable levelsby z &gt; 1. these predictions are testable with current surveys to z ~ 1;confirmation would establish a strong correlation between dark matter haloaccretion rate and central galaxy sfr.

1507.03999	where stars form: inside-out growth and coherent star formation from hst  halpha maps of 2676 galaxies across the main sequence at z~1	we present ha maps at 1kpc spatial resolution for star-forming galaxies atz~1, made possible by the wfc3 grism on hst. employing this capability over allfive 3d-hst/candels fields provides a sample of 2676 galaxies. by creating deepstacked halpha (ha) images, we reach surface brightness limits of1x10^-18\erg\s\cm^2\arcsec^2, allowing us to map the distribution of ionizedgas out to &gt;10kpc for typical l* galaxies at this epoch. we find that thespatial extent of the ha distribution increases with stellar mass asr(ha)[kpc]=1.5(mstars/10^10msun)^0.23. furthermore, the ha emission is moreextended than the stellar continuum emission, consistent with inside-outassembly of galactic disks. this effect, however, is mass dependent withr(ha)/r(stars)=1.1(m/10^10msun)^0.054, such that at low masses r(ha)~r(stars).we map the ha distribution as a function of sfr(ir+uv) and find evidence for`coherent star formation' across the sfr-m plane: above the main sequence, hais enhanced at all radii; below the main sequence, ha is depressed at allradii. this suggests that at all masses the physical processes driving theenhancement or suppression of star formation act throughout the disks ofgalaxies. it also confirms that the scatter in the star forming main sequenceis real and caused by variations in the star formation rate at fixed mass. athigh masses (10^10.5&lt;m/msun&lt;10^11), above the main sequence, ha is particularlyenhanced in the center, plausibly building bulges and/or supermassive blackholes. below the main sequence, the star forming disks are more compact and astrong central dip in the ew(ha), and the inferred specific star formationrate, appears. importantly though, across the entirety of the sfr-m plane, theabsolute star formation rate as traced by ha is always centrally peaked, evenin galaxies below the main sequence.

1508.02715	comprehensive assessment of the too-big-to-fail problem	we use a semi-analytical model for the substructure of dark matter haloes toassess the too-big-to-fail (tbtf) problem. the model accurately reproduces theaverage subhalo mass and velocity functions, as well as their halo-to-halovariance, in n-body simulations. we construct thousands of realizations ofmilky way (mw) size host haloes, allowing us to investigate the tbtf problemwith unprecedented statistical power. we examine the dependence on host halomass and cosmology, and explicitly demonstrate that a reliable assessment oftbtf requires large samples of hundreds of host haloes. we argue that previousstatistics used to address tbtf suffer from the look-elsewhere effect and/ordisregard certain aspects of the data on the mw satellite population. we devisea new statistic that is not hampered by these shortcomings, and, using onlydata on the 9 known mw satellite galaxies with $v_{\rm max}&gt;15{\rm kms}^{-1}$,demonstrate that $1.4^{+3.3}_{-1.1}\%$ of mw-size host haloes have a subhalopopulation in statistical agreement with that of the mw. however, when usingdata on the mw satellite galaxies down to $v_{\rm max}=8{\rm kms}^{-1}$, thismw consistent fraction plummets to $&lt;5\times10^{-4}$ (at 68% cl). hence, if itturns out that the inventory of mw satellite galaxies is complete down to8km/s, then the maximum circular velocities of mw satellites are utterlyinconsistent with $\lambda$cdm predictions, unless baryonic effects candrastically increase the spread in $v_{\rm max}$ values of satellite galaxiescompared to that of their subhaloes.

1510.01586	on the segregation of dark matter substructure	we present the first comprehensive analysis of the segregation of dark mattersubhaloes in their host haloes. using numerical simulations, we examine thesegregation of twelve different subhalo properties with respect to both orbitalenergy and halo-centric radius (in real space as well as in projection).subhaloes are strongly segregated by accretion redshift, which is an outcome ofthe inside-out assembly of their host haloes. since subhaloes that wereaccreted earlier have experienced more tidal stripping, subhaloes that havelost a larger fraction of their mass at infall are on more bound orbits.subhaloes are also strongly segregated in their masses and maximum circularvelocities at accretion. we demonstrate that part of this segregation isalready imprinted in the infall conditions. for massive subhaloes it issubsequently boosted by dynamical friction, but only during their first radialorbit. the impact of these two effects is counterbalanced, though, by the factthat subhaloes with larger accretion masses are accreted later. because oftidal stripping, subhaloes reveal little to no segregation by present-day massor maximum circular velocity, while the corresponding torques cause subhaloeson more bound orbits to have smaller spin. there is a weak tendency forsubhaloes that formed earlier to be segregated towards the center of their hosthalo, which is an indirect consequence of the fact that (sub)halo formationtime is correlated with other, strongly segregated properties. we discuss theimplications of our results for the segregation of satellite galaxies in galaxygroups and clusters.

1512.03050	introducing decorated hods: modeling assembly bias in the galaxy-halo  connection	the connection between galaxies and dark matter halos is often inferred fromdata using probabilistic models, such as the halo occupation distribution(hod). conventional hod formulations assume that only halo mass governs thegalaxy-halo connection. violations of this assumption, known as galaxy assemblybias, threaten the hod program. we introduce decorated hods, a new, flexibleclass of models designed to account for assembly bias. decorated hods minimallyexpand the parameter space and maximize the independence between traditionaland novel hod parameters. we use decorated hods to quantify the influence ofassembly bias on clustering and lensing statistics. for sdss-like samples, theimpact of assembly bias on galaxy clustering can be as large as a factor of twoon r ~ 200 kpc scales and ~15% in the linear regime. assembly bias can eitherenhance or diminish clustering on large scales, but generally increasesclustering on scales r &lt;~ 1 mpc. we performed our calculations with halotools,an open-source, community-driven python package for studying the galaxy-haloconnection (http://halotools.readthedocs.org). we conclude by describing theuse of decorated hods to treat assembly bias in otherwise conventionallikelihood analyses.

0807.4178	the rise and fall of galaxy activity in dark matter haloes	we use a sdss galaxy group catalogue to study the dependence of galaxyactivity on stellar mass, halo mass, and group hierarchy (centrals vs.satellites). we split our galaxy sample in star-forming galaxies, galaxies withoptical agn activity and radio sources. we find a smooth transition in halomass as the activity of central galaxies changes from star formation to opticalagn activity to radio emission. star-forming centrals preferentially reside inhaloes with m&lt;10^{12} msun, central galaxies with optical-agn activitytypically inhabit haloes with m \sim 10^{13} msun, and centrals emitting in theradio mainly reside in haloes more massive than 10^{14} msun. although thisseems to suggest that the environment (halo mass) determines the type ofactivity of its central galaxy, we find a similar trend with stellar mass:central star formers typically have stellar masses below 10^{10} msun, whileoptical-agn hosts and central radio sources have characteristic stellar massesof 10^{10.8} msun and 10^{11.6} msun, respectively. since more massive haloestypically host more massive centrals, it is unclear whether the activity of acentral galaxy is causally connected to its stellar mass or to its halo mass.in general, satellite galaxies have their activity suppressed wrt centralgalaxies of the same stellar mass. at fixed stellar mass, we find that theactivity of satellite galaxies depends only weakly on halo mass. in fact, forsatellite galaxies the dependence of galaxy activity on halo mass is more thanfour times weaker than the dependence on stellar mass. as we discuss, all theseresults are consistent with a picture in which low mass haloes accrete coldgas, while massive haloes have coronae of hot gas that promote radio activityof their central galaxies.

0807.4529	satellite kinematics i: a new method to constrain the halo  mass-luminosity relation of central galaxies	satellite kinematics can be used to probe the masses of dark matter haloes ofcentral galaxies. in order to measure the kinematics with sufficientsignal-to-noise, one uses the satellite galaxies of a large number of centralgalaxies stacked according to similar properties (e.g., luminosity). however,in general the relation between the luminosity of a central galaxy and the massof its host halo will have non-zero scatter. consequently, this stackingresults in combining the kinematics of satellite galaxies in haloes ofdifferent masses, which complicates the interpretation of the data. in thispaper we present an analytical framework to model satellite kinematics,properly accounting for this scatter and for various selection effects. we showthat in the presence of scatter in the halo mass-luminosity relation, thecommonly used velocity dispersion of satellite galaxies can not be used toinfer a unique halo mass-luminosity relation. in particular, we demonstratethat there is a degeneracy between the mean and the scatter of the halomass-luminosity relation. we present a new technique that can break thisdegeneracy, and which involves measuring the velocity dispersions using twodifferent weighting schemes: host-weighting (each central galaxy gets the sameweight) and satellite-weighting (each central galaxy gets a weight proportionalto its number of satellites). the ratio between the velocity dispersionsobtained using these two weighting schemes is a strong function of the scatterin the halo mass-luminosity relation, and can thus be used to infer a uniquerelation between light and mass from the kinematics of satellite galaxies.

0807.4532	satellite kinematics ii: the halo mass-luminosity relation of central  galaxies in sdss	the kinematics of satellite galaxies reflect the masses of the extended darkmatter haloes in which they orbit, and thus shed light on the mass-luminosityrelation (mlr) of their corresponding central galaxies. in this paper we selecta large sample of centrals and satellites from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) and measure the kinematics (velocity dispersions) of the satellitegalaxies as a function of the $r$-band luminosity of the central galaxies.using the analytical framework presented in paper i, we use these data to infer{\it both} the mean and the scatter of the mlr of central galaxies, carefullytaking account of selection effects and biases introduced by the stackingprocedure. as expected, brighter centrals on average reside in more massivehaloes. in addition, we find that the scatter in halo masses for centrals of agiven luminosity, $\sigma_{\log m}$, also increases with increasing luminosity.as we demonstrate, this is consistent with $\sigma_{\log l}$, which reflectsthe scatter in the conditional probability function $p(l_c|m)$, beingindependent of halo mass. our analysis of the satellite kinematics yields$\sigma_{\log l}=0.16\pm0.04$, in excellent agreement with constraints fromclustering and group catalogues, and with predictions from a semi-analyticalmodel of galaxy formation. we thus conclude that the amount of stochasticity ingalaxy formation, which is characterized by $\sigma_{\log l}$, is wellconstrained, is independent of halo mass, and is in good agreement with currentmodels of galaxy formation.

0807.4932	galaxy clustering &amp; galaxy-galaxy lensing: a promising union to  constrain cosmological parameters	galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing probe the connection betweengalaxies and their dark matter haloes in complementary ways. on one hand, thehalo occupation statistics inferred from the observed clustering properties ofgalaxies are degenerate with the adopted cosmology. consequently, differentcosmologies imply different mass-to-light ratios for dark matter haloes. on theother hand, galaxy-galaxy lensing yields direct constraints on the actualmass-to-light ratios and it can be used to break this degeneracy, and thus toconstrain cosmological parameters. in this paper we establish the link betweengalaxy luminosity and dark matter halo mass using the conditional luminosityfunction (clf). we constrain the clf parameters using the galaxy luminosityfunction and the luminosity dependence of the correlation lengths of galaxies.the resulting clf models are used to predict the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal.for a cosmology with $(\omega_{\rm m},\sigma_8)=(0.238,0.734)$, the modelaccurately fits the galaxy-galaxy lensing data obtained from the sdss. for acomparison cosmology with $(\omega_{\rm m},\sigma_8)=(0.3,0.9)$, however, wecan accurately fit the luminosity function and clustering properties of thegalaxy population, but the model predicts mass-to-light ratios that are toohigh, resulting in a strong overprediction of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal.we conclude that the combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensingis a powerful probe of the galaxy-dark matter connection, with the potential toyield tight constraints on cosmological parameters. since this method mainlyprobes the mass distribution on non-linear scales, it is complementary toconstraints obtained from the galaxy power-spectrum, which mainly probes thelarge-scale (linear) matter distribution.

astro-ph;0006048	dwarf galaxy rotation curves and the core problem of dark matter halos	the standard cold dark matter (cdm) model has recently been challenged by theclaim that dwarf galaxies have dark matter halos with constant density cores.consequently, numerous alternative dark matter candidates have recently beenproposed. in this paper, we scrutinize the observational evidence for theincongruity between dwarf galaxies and the cdm model. to this end, we analyzethe rotation curves of 20 late-type dwarf galaxies studied by swaters (1999).taking the effects of beam-smearing and adiabatic contraction into account, wefit mass models to these rotation curves with dark matter halos with differentcusp slopes, ranging from constant density cores to r^{-2} cusps. uncertaintiesin the stellar mass-to-light ratio and the limited spatial sampling of thehalo's density distribution hamper a unique mass decomposition. consequently,the rotation curves in our sample cannot be used to discriminate between darkhalos with constant density cores and r^{-1} cusps. we show that the dwarfgalaxies analyzed here are consistent with cold dark matter halos in a lcdmcosmology, and that there is thus no need to abandon the idea that dark matteris cold and collisionless. however, the data is also consistent with anyalternative dark matter model that produces dark matter halos with centralcusps less steep than r^{-1.5}. in fact, we argue that based on existingrotation curves alone at best weak limits can be obtained on cosmologicalparameters and/or the nature of the dark matter.

astro-ph;0007121	disk galaxies as cosmological benchmarks: cold dark matter versus  modified newtonian dynamics	we discuss a comparison of models for the formation of disk galaxies both ina universe dominated by cold dark matter (cdm) and one in which the force lawis given by modified newtonian dynamics (mond). our main aim is to address theclaim made by mcgaugh &amp; de blok that cdm suffers from severe fine-tuningproblems, which are circumvented under mond. as we show, cdm indeed requiressome amount of tuning of the feedback efficiencies to obtain a tully-fisherrelation (tfr) as steep as observed. however, that same model is in excellentagreement with a wide variety of additional observations. therefore, the modestamount of feedback needed should not be regarded a fine-tuning problem.instead, its requirement should be considered a generic prediction for cdm,which might be tested with future observations and with detailed modeling offeedback processes. we also show that galaxy formation in a mond universe cannot simultaneously reproduce the tfr and the lack of high surface brightnessdwarf galaxies. we thus conclude that cdm is a more viable theory for theformation of disk galaxies than mond.

astro-ph;0105082	the angular momentum content of dwarf galaxies: new challenges for the  theory of galaxy formation	we compute the specific angular momentum distributions of a sample of lowmass disk galaxies observed by swaters. we compare these distributions to thoseof dark matter haloes obtained by bullock et al. from high resolution n-bodysimulations of structure formation in a lcdm universe. we find that althoughthe disk mass fractions are significantly smaller than the universal baryonfraction, the total specific angular momenta of the disks are in good agreementwith those of dark matter haloes. this suggests that disks form out of only asmall fraction of the available baryons, but yet manage to draw most of theavailable angular momentum. in addition we find that the angular momentumdistributions of disks are clearly distinct from those of the dark matter;disks lack predominantly both low and high specific angular momentum.understanding these findings in terms of a coherent picture for disk formationis challenging. cooling, feedback and stripping, which are the main mechanismsto explain the small disk mass fractions found, seem unable to simultaneouslyexplain the disk's angular momentum distribution. in fact, it seems that thebaryons that make up the disks must have been born out of angular momentumdistributions that are clearly distinct from those of lcdm haloes. therefore,understanding the angular momentum content of disk galaxies remains animportant challenge for our picture of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0105158	the universal mass accretion history of cdm haloes	we use the extended press-schechter formalism to investigate the rate atwhich cold dark matter haloes accrete mass. we discuss the shortcomings ofprevious methods that have been used to compute the mass accretion histories ofdark matter haloes, and present an improved method based on the n-branch mergertree algorithm of somerville &amp; kolatt. we show that this method no longersuffers from inconsistencies in halo formation times, and compare itspredictions with high resolution n-body simulations. although the overallagreement is reasonable, there are slight inconsistencies which are most easilyinterpreted as a reflection of ellipsoidal collapse (as opposed to sphericalcollapse assumed in the press-schechter formalism). we show that the averagemass accretion histories follow a simple, universal profile, and we present arecipe for computing the two scale-parameters which is applicable to a widerange of halo masses and cosmologies. together with the universal profiles forthe density and angular momentum distributions of cdm haloes, these universalmass accretion histories provide a simple but accurate framework for modelingthe structure and formation of dark matter haloes. in particular, they can beused as a backbone for modeling various aspects of galaxy formation where oneis not interested in the detailed effects of merging. as an example we use theuniversal mass accretion history to compute the rate at which haloes accretemass, which we compare to the cosmic star formation history of the universe.

astro-ph;0107195	the origin of the density distribution of disk galaxies: a new problem  for the standard model of disk formation	we present new models for the formation of disk galaxies that improve uponprevious models by following the detailed accretion and cooling of the baryonicmass, and by using realistic distributions of specific angular momentum. underthe assumption of detailed angular momentum conservation the disks that formhave density distributions that are more centrally concentrated than anexponential. we examine the influence of star formation, bulge formation, andfeedback on the outcome of the surface brightness distributions of the stars.whereas the models are succesful in reproducing high surface brightness disks,they fail to produce exponential disks of low surface brightness. in addition,the models predict truncation radii in the gas that occur at too high surfacedensity. this signals a new problem for the standard model of disk formation:if the baryonic component of the protogalaxies out of which disk galaxies formhave the same angular momentum distribution as the dark matter, disks are toocompact.

astro-ph;0201095	the angular momentum of gas in proto-galaxies i. implications for the  formation of disk galaxies	we use non-radiative n-body/sph simulations of structure formation in a lcdmcosmology to compare the angular momentum distributions of dark matter and gasin a large sample of halos. we show that the two components have identical spinparameter distributions and that their angular momentum distributions withinindividual halos are very similar, all in excellent agreement with standardassumptions. despite these similarities, however, we find that the angularmomentum vectors of the gas and dark matter are poorly aligned, with a medianmisalignment angle of about 30 degrees, which might have important implicationsfor spin correlation statistics used in weak lensing studies. we presentdistributions for the component of the angular momentum that is aligned withthe total angular momentum of each halo, and find that for between 5 and 50percent of the mass this component is negative. this disagrees with the`universal' angular momentum distribution suggested by bullock et al. (2001),for which the mass fraction with negative specific angular momentum is zero. wediscuss the implications of our results for the formation of disk galaxies.since galactic disks generally do not contain counter-rotating stars or gas,disk formation cannot occur under detailed conservation of specific angularmomentum. we suggest that the material with negative specific angular momentumcombines with positive angular momentum material to build a bulge component,and show that in such a scenario the remaining material can form a disk with adensity distribution that is very close to exponential.

astro-ph;0207019	constraining galaxy formation and cosmology with the conditional  luminosity function of galaxies	we use the conditional luminosity function (clf), which gives the number ofgalaxies with luminosities in the range [l, l+dl] that reside in a halo of massm, to link the distribution of galaxies to that of dark matter haloes. we seekthe clf that reproduces the galaxy luminosity function and the luminositydependence of the galaxy clustering strength and test the models by comparingthe resulting mass-to-light ratios (m/l) with constraints from the tully-fisher(tf) relation. we obtain a number of stringent constraints on both galaxyformation and cosmology. in particular, this method can break the degeneracybetween omega_0 and the power-spectrum normalization sigma_8, inherent incurrent weak-lensing and cluster-abundance studies. for flat lcdm cosmogonieswith sigma_8 normalized by recent weak lensing observations, the best resultsare obtained for omega_0~0.3; omega_0 &lt; 0.2 leads to too large galaxycorrelation lengths, while omega_0 &gt; 0.4 gives too high m/l. the best-fit modelfor the lcdm concordance cosmology (omega_0=0.3) predicts m/l that are slightlytoo high. we discuss a number of possible effects that might remedy thisproblem, including small modification of cosmological parameters, warm in steadof cold dark matter, systematic errors in current observational data, and theexistence of dark galaxies. finally we use the clf to predict severalstatistics about the distribution of galaxy light in the local universe.

0808.2526	the subhalo - satellite connection and the fate of disrupted satellite  galaxies	in the standard paradigm, satellite galaxies are believed to be associatedwith the population of dark matter subhalos. in this paper, we use theconditional stellar mass functions of {\it satellite galaxies} obtained from alarge galaxy group catalogue together with models of the subhalo mass functionsto explore the fraction and fate of stripped stars from satellites in galaxygroups and clusters of different masses. the majority of the stripped stars inmassive halos are predicted to end up as intra-cluster stars, and the predictedamounts of the intra-cluster component as a function of the velocity dispersionof galaxy system match well the observational results obtained by gonzalez etal. (2007). the fraction of the mass in the stripped stars to that remain boundin the central and satellite galaxies is the highest ($\sim 40%$ of the totalstellar mass) in halos with masses $m_h\sim 10^{14}\msunh$. if all these starsend up in the intra-cluster component (max), or maximum of them are accretedinto the central galaxy (min), then we can predict that a maximum $\sim 19%$and a minimum $\sim 5%$ of the total stars in the whole universe are in termsof the diffused intra-cluster component. in the former case, in massive haloswith $m_h \sim 10^{15} \msunh$, the stellar mass of the intra-cluster componentis roughly 6 times as large as that of the central galaxy. this factordecreases to $\sim 2$, 1 and 0.1 in halos with $m_h \sim 10^{14}$, $10^{13}$,and $10^{12} \msunh$, respectively. the total amount of stars stripped fromsatellite galaxies is insufficient to build up the central galaxies in haloswith masses $\la 10^{12.5}\msunh$, and so the quenching of star formation mustoccur in halos with higher masses. abridged.

astro-ph;0210495	linking early and late type galaxies to their dark matter haloes	(abridged) using data from the 2dfgrs we compute the conditional luminosityfunctions (clfs) of early- and late-type galaxies. these functions give theaverage number of galaxies with luminosity l that reside in a halo of mass m,and are a powerful statistical tool to link the distribution of galaxies tothat of dark matter haloes. we find that the average mass-to-light ratios ofdark matter haloes have a minimum of about 100 msun/lsun around a halo mass ofabout 3x10^{11} msun. in addition, haloes with m &lt; 10^{10} msun are virtuallydevoid of galaxies, while clusters have b_j band mass-to-light ratios in therange 500-1000 msun/lsun. finally, the fact that early-type galaxies are morestrongly clustered than late-type galaxies requires that the fraction oflate-type galaxies is a strongly declining function of halo mass. we alsocompute two-point correlation functions as function of both luminosity andgalaxy type, and find a weak (strong) luminosity dependence for the late(early) type galaxies. finally we compare our clfs with predictions fromseveral semi-analytical models for galaxy formation. as long as these modelsaccurately fit the 2dfgrs luminosity function the agreement with ourpredictions is remarkably good. this indicates that we have recovered astatistical description of how galaxies populate dark matter haloes which fitsnicely within the standard framework for galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0301104	towards cosmological concordance on galactic scales	we use the observed abundance and clustering of galaxies from the 2dfgrs todetermine the matter density omega_m and the linear amplitude of massfluctuations sigma_8. we use a method based on the conditional luminosityfunction, which allows straightforward computation of the luminosity dependentbias of galaxies. in addition, it allows the inclusion of constraints on theredshift space distortion parameter beta=omega_m^{0.6}/b, and yields averagemass-to-light ratios as function of halo mass. using only the luminosityfunction and the correlation lengths as function of luminosity we obtainconstraints on omega_m and sigma_8 that are in good agreement with cobe. usingadditional constraints on the mass-to-light ratios of clusters and on the valueof beta as determined from the 2dfgrs yields omega_m = (0.27 +/- 0.06) andsigma_8 = (0.77 +/- 0.06). adding further constraints from current cmb data, weobtain omega_m = (0.25 +/- 0.04) and sigma_8 = (0.78 +/- 0.06). thus, we findstrong indications that both omega_m and sigma_8 are significantly lower thantheir ``standard'' concordance values of 0.3 and 0.9, respectively. finally, weshow that the cosmologies favored here predict dark matter haloes that aresignificantly less centrally concentrated than for the standard lcdmconcordance model. this may solve both the problem with the rotation curves ofdwarf and lsb galaxies, as well as the problem of simultaneously matching thegalaxy luminosity function and the tully-fisher zero-point.

astro-ph;0303524	populating dark matter haloes with galaxies: comparing the 2dfgrs with  mock galaxy redshift surveys	in two recent papers, we developed a powerful technique to link thedistribution of galaxies to that of dark matter haloes by considering halooccupation numbers as function of galaxy luminosity and type. in this paper weuse these distribution functions to populate dark matter haloes inhigh-resolution n-body simulations of the standard lcdm cosmogony withomega_m=0.3 and sigma_8=0.9. stacking simulation boxes of 100 mpc/h and 300mpc/h with 512^3 cdm particles each we construct mock galaxy redshift surveysout to a redshift of z=0.2. we use these mock surveys to investigate variousclustering statistics. the projected correlation functions for galaxies withdifferent luminosities and types match the observations well on scales largerthan about 3 mpc/h. on smaller scales, however, the model overpredicts theclustering power by about a factor two. furthermore, the model predictspairwise velocity dispersions (pvd) that are about 400 km/s too high atprojected pair separations of ~1 mpc/h. a strong velocity bias in massivehaloes can reduce the predicted pvd to the observed level, but does not help toresolve the over-prediction of clustering power on small scales. consistentresults can be obtained within the standard lcdm model only when themass-to-light ratio of clusters is almost twice the observed value.alternatively, a lcdm model with sigma_8=0.75 can also reproduce theobservational results.

astro-ph;0308117	the angular momentum of gas in proto-galaxies: ii -- the impact of  preheating	we examine the effect of preheating of the intergalactic medium on galaxyformation using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. by performingsimulations both with and without a simple model for preheating, we analyse andcompare the angular momentum distributions of the dark matter and the baryons.preheating unbinds baryons from their dark matter haloes, yielding a baryonicmass fraction that declines with decreasing halo mass. in addition, the spinparameter of the gas is reduced with respect to the case without preheating,while the misalignment between the angular momentum directions of the gas anddark matter increases strongly. the angular momentum distributions ofindividual haloes reveal that preheating decreases (increases) the massfraction with low (negative) specific angular momentum. we discuss theimplications of these findings for the formation of disk galaxies in apreheated intergalactic medium, and compare our results to the predictions ofmaller &amp; dekel (2002), who propose an alternative interpretation for the originof the angular momentum of (proto)-galaxies.

astro-ph;0310147	the dependence of the galaxy luminosity function on large-scale  environment	a basic assumption in current halo occupation model is that the properties ofa galaxy depend only on the mass of its dark matter halo. an importantconsequence of this is that the segregation of the galaxy population bylarge-scale environment is entirely due to the environmental dependence of thehalo population. in this paper we use such a model to predict how the galaxyluminosity function depends on large-scale environment. the latter isrepresented by the density contrast (delta) averaged over a spherical volume ofradius r=8mpc/h. the model predicts that the schechter function is a goodapproximation to the luminosity functions of galaxies brighter than ~10^9h^{-2}l_sun (b_j-band) in virtually all environments. the characteristicluminosity, l^{\star}, increases moderately with \delta. the faint-end slope,\alpha, on the other hand, is quite independent of $\delta$. however, whensplitting the galaxy population into early and late types, it is found that forlate-types \alpha is virtually constant, whereas for early-types \alphaincreases from ~-0.3 in underdense regions (\delta~-0.5) to ~-0.8 in highlyoverdense regions with \delta ~ 10. the luminosity function at l_{b_j}&lt;10^9h^{-2} l_sun is significantly steeper than the extrapolation of the schechterfunction that fits the brighter galaxies. this steepening is more significantfor early-types and in low-density environments. the model also predicts thatthe luminosity density and mass density are closely correlated. the relationbetween the two is monotonic but highly non-linear. this suggests that one canuse the luminosity density, averaged over a large volume, to rank the massdensity. this, in turn, allows the environmental effects predicted here to betested by observations.

astro-ph;0404033	probing dark matter haloes with satellite kinematics	using detailed mock galaxy redshift surveys we investigate to what extent thekinematics of large samples of satellites galaxies extracted from flux-limitedsurveys can be used to constrain halo masses. previous host-satellite selectioncriteria yield relatively large fractions of interlopers and with a velocitydistribution that, contrary to what has typically been assumed, differsstrongly from uniform. a new adaptive selection criterion is proposed whichyields much larger host-satellite samples and with strongly reduced interloperfractions. we show that satellite weighting, which occurs naturally whenstacking many host-satellite pairs, introduces a bias towards higher velocitydispersions compared to the true, host-averaged mean. a further bias, in thesame direction, is introduced when using flux-limited, rather thanvolume-limited surveys. we apply our adaptive selection criterion to the 2dfgrsand obtain a sample of 12613 satellite galaxies and 8004 host galaxies. thesatellite kinematics are in excellent agreement with predictions based on theconditional luminosity function (clf), providing independent, dynamicalconfirmation of the average mass-to-light ratios predicted by the clfformalism.

astro-ph;0404143	the three-point correlation function of galaxies: comparing halo  occupation models with observations	we present models for the three-point correlation function (3pcf) of bothdark matter and galaxies. we show that models based on the halo model canreasonably match the dark matter 3pcf obtained from high-resolution $n$-bodysimulations. on small scales ($r\la 0.5\mpch$) the 3pcf is sensitive to detailsregarding the density distributions of dark matter haloes. on larger scales ($r\ga 2.0\mpch$) the results are very sensitive to the abundance of the few mostprominant haloes. using the conditional luminosity function, we also constructmodels for the 3pcf of galaxies, which we test against large mock galaxysamples. the bias of the galaxy distrubution with respect to the dark matter,and the finite number of galaxies that can be hosted by individual haloes,significantly reduce the normalized three-point correlation function withrespect to that of dark matter. contrary to the 3pcf of the dark matter, thegalaxy 3pcf is much less sensitive to details regarding the spatial numberdensity distribution of galaxies in individual haloes or to the abundance ofthe few most massive systems. finally, we show that our model based on theconditional luminosity function is in good agreement with results obtained fromthe 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey. in particular, the model nicelyreproduces the observational finding that the 3pcf for early-type galaxies isslightly higher than that of late-type galaxies, and that there is nosignificant dependence of the 3pcf on galaxy luminosity.

astro-ph;0405234	a halo-based galaxy group finder: calibration and application to the  2dfgrs	we use the halo occupation model to calibrate galaxy group finders inmagnitude-limited redshift surveys. since, according to the current scenario ofstructure formation, galaxy groups are associated with cold dark matter halos,we make use of the properties of the halo population in the design of our groupfinder. the method starts with an assumed mass-to-light ratio to assign atentative mass to each group. this mass is used to estimate the size andvelocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turnis used to determine group membership (in redshift space). this procedure isrepeated until no further changes occur in group memberships. we find that thefinal groups selected this way are insensitive to the mass-to-light ratioassumed. we use mock catalogues, constructed using the conditional luminosityfunction (clf), to test the performance of our group finder in terms ofcompleteness of true members and contamination by interlopers. our group finderis more successful than the conventional friends-of-friends group finder inassigning galaxies in common dark matter halos to a single group. we apply ourgroup finder to the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey and compare theresulting group properties with model predictions based on the clf. for the$\lambda$cdm `concordance' cosmology we find a clear discrepancy between themodel and data in the sense that the model predicts too many rich groups. inorder to match the observational results we have to either increase themass-to-light ratios of rich clusters to a level significantly higher thancurrent observational estimates, or to assume $\sigma_8 \simeq 0.7$, comparedto the `concordance' value of 0.9.

astro-ph;0406246	the abundance and radial distribution of satellite galaxies	using detailed mock galaxy redshift surveys (mgrss) we investigate theabundance and radial distribution of satellite galaxies. the mock surveys areconstructed using the conditional luminosity function (clf), and are comparedagainst data from the 2dfgrs. we use monte carlo markov chains to explore thefull posterior distribution of the clf parameter space, and show that theaverage relation between light and mass is tightly constrained. the radialnumber density distribution of satellite galaxies in the 2dfgrs reveals apronounced absence of satellites at small projected separations from their hostgalaxies. this is (at least partially) due to the overlap and merging of galaxyimages in the apm catalogue. because of the resulting close-pair incompletenesswe are unfortunately unable to put meaningful constraints on the radialdistribution of satellite galaxies. marginalizing over the full clf parameterspace, we show that in a lcdm concordance cosmology the observed abundances ofhost and satellite galaxies in the 2dfgrs indicate a power spectrumnormalization of sigma_8=0.7. the same cosmology but with sigma_8=0.9 is unableto simultanously match the abundances of host and satellite galaxies. thisconfirms our previous conclusions based on the pairwise peculiar velocitydispersions and the group multipliticy function.

astro-ph;0406593	the two-point correlation of galaxy groups: probing the clustering of  dark matter haloes	we analyze the 2-point correlation function (2pcf) of galaxy groupsidentified from the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey with the halo basedgroup finder recently developed by yang et al (2004b). with this groupcatalogue we are able to estimate the 2pcfs for systems ranging from isolatedgalaxies to rich clusters of galaxies. the real-space correlation lengthobtained for these systems ranges from $\sim 4\mpch$ to $\sim 15\mpch$,respectively. the observed correlation amplitude (and the corresponding biasfactor) as a function of group abundance is well reproduced by associatinggalaxy groups with dark matter haloes in the standard $\lambda$cdm model.redshift distortions are clearly detected in the redshift-space correlationfunction, the degree of which is consistent with the assumption ofgravitational clustering and halo bias in the cosmic density field. inagreement with previous studies we find a strong increase of the correlationlength with the mean inter-group separation. although well determinedobservationally, we show that current theoretical predictions are not yetaccurate enough to allow for stringent constraints on cosmological parameters.finally, we use our results to explore the power-law nature of the 2pcf ofgalaxies. we split the 2pcf in 1-group and 2-group terms, equivalent to the1-halo and 2-halo terms in halo occupation models, and show that the power-lawform of the 2pcf is broken, when only including galaxies in the more massivesystems.

astro-ph;0409201	the mass function and average mass loss rate of dark matter subhaloes	we present a simple, semi-analytical model to compute the mass functions ofdark matter subhaloes. the masses of subhaloes at their time of accretion areobtained from a standard merger tree. during the subsequent evolution, thesubhaloes experience mass loss due to the combined effect of dynamicalfriction, tidal stripping, and tidal heating. rather than integrating theseeffects along individual subhalo orbits, we consider the average mass lossrate, where the average is taken over all possible orbital configurations. thisallows us to write the average mass loss rate as a simple function that dependsonly on redshift and on the instantaneous mass ratio of subhalo and parenthalo. after calibrating the model by matching the subhalo mass function (shmf)of cluster-sized dark matter haloes obtained from numerical simulations, weinvestigate the predicted mass and redshift dependence of the shmf.we findthat, contrary to previous claims, the subhalo mass function is not universal.instead, both the slope and the normalization depend on the ratio of the parenthalo mass, m, and the characteristic non-linear mass m*. this simply reflects ahalo formation time dependence; more massive parent haloes form later, thusallowing less time for mass loss to operate. we analyze the halo-to-haloscatter, and show that the subhalo mass fraction of individual haloes dependsmost strongly on their accretion history in the last gyr. finally we provide asimple fitting function for the average shmf of a parent halo of any mass atany redshift and for any cosmology, and briefly discuss several implications ofour findings.

astro-ph;0410114	galaxy occupation statistics of dark matter haloes: observational  results	we study the occupation statistics of galaxies in dark matter haloes usinggalaxy groups identified from the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey withthe halo-based group finder of yang et al. the occupation distribution isconsidered separately for early and late type galaxies, as well as in terms ofcentral and satellite galaxies. the mean luminosity of the central galaxiesscales with halo mass approximately as $l_c\propto m^{2/3}$ for haloes withmasses $m&lt;10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$, and as $l_c\propto m^{1/4}$ for more massivehaloes. the characteristic mass of $10^{13} h^{-1} \msun$ is consistent withthe mass scale where galaxy formation models suggest a transition fromefficient to inefficient cooling. another characteristic halo mass scale,$m\sim 10^{11} h^{-1}\msun$, which cannot be probed directly by our groups, isinferred from the conditional luminosity function (clf) that matches theobserved galaxy luminosity function and clustering. for a halo of given mass,the distribution of $l_c$ is rather narrow. the satellite galaxies are found tofollow a poissonian number distribution. the central galaxies in low-masshaloes are mostly late type galaxies, while those in massive haloes are almostall early types. we also measure the clf of galaxies in haloes of given mass.over the mass range that can be reliably probed with the present data ($13.3\lta {\rm log}[m/(h^{-1}\msun)] \lta 14.7$), the clf is reasonably well fit bya schechter function. contrary to recent claims based on semi-analytical modelsof galaxy formation, the presence of central galaxies does not show up as astrong peak at the bright end of the clf.

astro-ph;0412018	the galaxy dark matter connection	what galaxy lives in what halo? the answer to this simple question holdsimportant information regarding galaxy formation and evolution. we describe anew statistical technique to link galaxies to their dark matter haloes, orlight to mass, using the clustering properties of galaxies as function of theirluminosity. the galaxy-dark matter connection thus established, andparameterized through the conditional luminosity function, indicates thepresence of two characteristic scales in galaxy formation: one at ~10^{11}msun, where galaxy formation is most efficient, and another at ~10^{13} msun,where a transition occurs from systems dominated by one brightest, centralgalaxy to systems with several dominant galaxies of comparable luminosity. weshow that the relation between light and mass established from galaxyclustering alone is in excellent agreement with the dynamical masses inferredfrom satellite kinematics. we also present a new (halo-based) galaxy-groupfinder, and show that the multiplicity function of galaxy groups identified inthe 2dfgrs suggests a relatively high mass-to-light ratio on the scales ofgalaxy clusters, or, alternatively, a relatively low value of sigma_8. thesefindings are also supported by our studies of pairwise peculiar velocities andsatellite abundances.

astro-ph;0501256	origin of the joint distribution of structural parameters in disc  galaxies	we use a simple model of disc-galaxy formation in the lcdm cosmology tosimultaneously reproduce the slopes, zero-points, scatter and uncorrelatedresiduals in the observed velocity-luminosity (vl) and radius-luminosity (rl)relations. observed i-band luminosities are converted to stellar masses usingthe imf-dependent relation between stellar mass-to-light ratio, m/l, and color.the model treats halo concentration, spin parameter, and disc mass fraction asindependent log-normal random variables. our main conclusion is that the vl andrl zero-points and the uncorrelated residuals can only be reproducedsimultaneously if adiabatic contraction is avoided. one or the other could befixed by appealing to unrealistic values for m/l, halo concentration c, andspin parameter lambda, but not all together. the small vl scatter is naturallydetermined by the predicted scatter in c and in m/l, quite independent of thelarge scatter in lambda. however, the rl scatter, driven by the scatter inlambda, can be as low as observed only if sigma_lambda simeq 0.25, about halfthe value predicted for cdm haloes. this may indicate that discs form in aspecial subset of haloes. the vl slope is reproduced once star formation occursonly above a threshold surface density, and the rl slope implies that the discmass fraction is increasing with halo mass, consistent with feedback effects. amodel that incorporates the above ingredients provides a simultaneous fit toall the observed features. in particular, the elimination of adiabaticcontraction allows 80% disc contribution to the observed rotation velocity ofbright discs at 2.2 disc scale lengths. the lack of halo contraction mayindicate that disc formation is not as smooth as typically envisioned, butinstead may involve clumpy, cold streams.

astro-ph;0502466	the phase-space parameters of brightest halo galaxies	the brightest galaxy in a dark matter halo is expected to reside at rest atthe center of the halo. in this paper we test this `central galaxy paradigm'using group catalogues extracted from the 2dfgrs and the sdss. for each groupwe compute a parameter, r, defined as the difference between the velocity ofthe brightest group galaxy and the average velocity of the other group members(hereafter satellites), normalized by the unbiased estimator of the velocitydispersion of the satellite galaxies. using detailed mock galaxy redshiftsurveys, we show that the central galaxy paradigm is inconsistent with the dataat high confidence, and that instead the brightest halo galaxies have aspecific kinetic energy that is about 25 percent of that of the satellites.this indicates that either central galaxies reside at the minimum of the darkmatter potential, but that the halo itself is not yet fully relaxed, or, thatthe halo is relaxed, but that the central galaxy oscillates in its potentialwell. the former is consistent with the fact that we find a weak hint that thevelocity bias of brightest halo galaxies is larger in more massive haloes,while the latter may be indicative of cored, rather than cusped, dark matterhaloes. we discuss several implications of these findings, including massestimates based on satellite kinematics, strong gravitational lensing, halooccupation models, and the frequency and longevity of lopsidedness in diskgalaxies.

astro-ph;0504477	the cross-correlation between galaxies and groups: probing the galaxy  distribution in and around dark matter haloes	we determine the cross-correlation function between galaxies and galaxygroups, using both the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) and thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). we study the cross-correlation as a functionof group mass, and as a function of the luminosity, stellar mass, colour,spectral type and specific star formation rate of the galaxies. all thesecross-correlation functions show a clear transition from the `1-halo' to the`2-halo' regimes on a scale comparable to the virial radius of the groups inconsideration. on scales larger than the virial radius, all cross-correlationfunctions are roughly parallel, consistent with the linear bias model. inparticular, the large scale correlation amplitudes are higher for more massivegroups, and for brighter and redder galaxies. in the `1-halo' regime, thecross-correlation function depends strongly on the definition of the groupcenter. we consider both a luminosity-weighted center (lwc) and a centerdefined by the location of the brightest group galaxy (bgc). with the firstdefinition, the bright early-type galaxies in massive groups are found to bemore centrally concentrated than the fainter, late-type galaxies. using thebgc, and excluding the brightest galaxy from the cross correlation analysis, weonly find significant segregation in massive groups ($m \gta10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$) for galaxies of different spectral types (or colours orspecific star formation rates). in haloes with masses $\la 10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$,there is a significant deficit of bright satellite galaxies. comparing theresults from the 2dfgrs with those obtained from realistic mock samples, wefind that the distribution of galaxies in groups is much less concentrated thandark matter haloes predicted by the current $\lambda$cdm model.

astro-ph;0506516	preheating by previrialization and its impact on galaxy formation	we use recent observations of the hi-mass function to constrain galaxyformation. the data conflicts with the standard model where most of the gas ina low-mass dark matter halo is assumed to settle into a disk of cold gas thatis depleted by star formation and supernova-driven outflows until the diskbecomes gravitationally stable. a consistent model can be found if low-masshaloes are embedded in a preheated medium, with a specific gas entropy ~ 10kevcm^2. such a model simultaneously matches the faint-end slope of the galaxyluminosity function. we propose a preheating model where the medium aroundlow-mass haloes is preheated by gravitational pancaking. since gravitationaltidal fields suppress the formation of low-mass haloes while promoting that ofpancakes, the formation of massive pancakes precedes that of the low-masshaloes within them. we demonstrate that the progenitors of present-day darkmatter haloes with m&lt;10^{12}h^{-1}\msun were embedded in pancakes of masses$~5x10^{12}h^{-1}\msun$ at z~2. the formation of such pancakes heats the gas toa temperature of 5x10^5k and compresses it to an overdensity of ~10. such gashas a cooling time that exceeds the age of the universe at z~2, and has aspecific entropy of ~15kev cm^2, almost exactly the amount required to explainthe stellar and hi mass functions.

astro-ph;0509147	properties of galaxy groups in the sdss: i.-- the dependence of colour,  star formation, and morphology on halo mass	using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the sdss, weinvestigate the correlation between various galaxy properties and halo mass. wesplit the population of galaxies in early types, late types, and intermediatetypes, based on their colour and specific star formation rate. at fixedluminosity, the early type fraction increases with increasing halo mass. mostimportantly, this mass dependence is smooth and persists over the entire massrange probed, without any break or feature at any mass scale. we argue that theprevious claim of a characteristic feature on galaxy group scales is anartefact of the environment estimators used. at fixed halo mass, the luminositydependence of the type fractions is surprisingly weak: galaxy type depends morestrongly on halo mass than on luminosity. we also find that the early typefraction decreases with increasing halo-centric radius. contrary to previousstudies, we find that this radial dependence is also present in low masshaloes. the properties of satellite galaxies are strongly correlated with thoseof their central galaxy. in particular, the early type fraction of satellitesis significantly higher in a halo with an early type central galaxy than in ahalo of the same mass but with a late type central galaxy. this phenomenon,which we call `galactic conformity', is present in haloes of all masses and forsatellites of all luminosities. finally, the fraction of intermediate typegalaxies is always ~20 percent, independent of luminosity, independent of halomass, independent of halo-centric radius, and independent of whether the galaxyis a central galaxy or a satellite galaxy. we discuss the implications of allthese findings for galaxy formation and evolution.

astro-ph;0510372	on the assembly history of dark matter haloes	(abridged) we study the mass assembly history (mah) of dark matter haloes. wecompare mahs obtained using (i) merger trees constructed with the extendedpress-schechter (eps) formalism, (ii) numerical simulations, and (iii) thelagrangian perturbation code pinocchio. we show that the pinocchio mahs are inexcellent agreement with those obtained using numerical simulations. using asuite of 55 pinocchio simulations, with 256^3 particles each, we study the mahsof 12,924 cold dark matter haloes in a \lambdacdm concordance cosmology. weshow that haloes less massive than the characteristic non-linear mass scaleestablish their potential wells much before they acquire most of their mass.the time when a halo reaches its maximum virial velocity roughly divides itsmass assembly into two phases, a fast accretion phase which is dominated bymajor mergers, and a slow accretion phase dominated by minor mergers. each haloexperiences about 3 \pm 2 major mergers since its main progenitor had a massequal to one percent of the final halo mass. this major merger statistic isfound to be virtually independent of halo mass. however, the average redshiftat which these major mergers occur, is strongly mass dependent, with moremassive haloes experiencing their major mergers later.

astro-ph;0601040	the alignment between the distribution of satellites and the orientation  of their central galaxy	we use galaxy groups selected from the sloan digital sky survey to examinethe alignment between the orientation of the central galaxy (defined as thebrightest group member) and the distribution of satellite galaxies. byconstruction, we therefore only address the alignment on scales smaller thanthe halo virial radius. we find a highly significant alignment of satelliteswith the major axis of their central galaxy. this is in qualitative agreementwith the recent study of brainerd (2005), but inconsistent with severalprevious studies who detected a preferential minor axis alignment. thealignment strength in our sample is strongest between red central galaxies andred satellites. on the contrary, the satellite distribution in systems with ablue central galaxy is consistent with isotropic. we also find that thealignment strength is stronger in more massive haloes and at smaller projectedradii from the central galaxy. in addition, there is a weak indication thatfainter (relative to the central galaxy) satellites are more strongly aligned.we present a detailed comparison with previous studies, and discuss theimplications of our findings for galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0604553	a revised model for the formation of disk galaxies: low spin and  dark-halo expansion	we use observed rotation velocity-luminosity (vl) and size-luminosity (rl)relations to single out a specific scenario for disk galaxy formation in thelcdm cosmology. our model involves four independent log-normal randomvariables: dark-halo concentration c, disk spin lam_gal, disk mass fractionm_gal, and stellar mass-to-light ratio m/l_i. a simultaneous match of the vland rl zero points with adiabatic contraction requires low-c halos, but thismodel has v_2.2~1.8 v_vir (where v_2.2 and v_vir are the circular velocity at2.2 disk scale lengths and the virial radius, respectively) which will beunable to match the luminosity function (lf). similarly models withoutadiabatic contraction but standard c also predict high values of v_2.2/v_vir.models in which disk formation induces an expansion rather than the commonlyassumed contraction of the dark-matter halos have v_2.2~1.2 v_vir which allowsa simultaneous fit of the lf. this may result from non-spherical, clumpy gasaccretion, where dynamical friction transfers energy from the gas to the darkmatter. this model requires low lam_gal and m_gal values, contrary to naiveexpectations. however, the low lam_gal is consistent with the notion that diskgalaxies predominantly survive in halos with a quiet merger history, while alow m_gal is also indicated by galaxy-galaxy lensing. the smaller than expectedscatter in the rl relation, and the lack of correlation between the residualsof the vl and rl relations, respectively, imply that the scatter in lam_gal andin c need to be smaller than predicted for lcdm halos, again consistent withthe idea that disk galaxies preferentially reside in halos with a quiet mergerhistory.

astro-ph;0605045	natural downsizing in hierarchical galaxy formation	stellar-population analyses of today's galaxies show "downsizing", where thestars in more massive galaxies tend to have formed earlier and over a shortertime span. we show that this phenomenon is not necessarily "anti-hierarchical"but rather has its natural roots in the bottom-up clustering process ofdark-matter haloes. while the main progenitor does indeed show an oppositeeffect, the integrated mass in all the progenitors down to a given minimum massshows a robust downsizing that is qualitatively similar to what has beenobserved. these results are derived analytically from the standard extendedpress schechter (eps) theory, and are confirmed by merger trees based on eps ordrawn from n-body simulations. the downsizing is valid for any minimum mass, aslong as it is the same for all haloes at any given time, but the effect isweaker for smaller minimum mass. if efficient star formation is triggered byatomic cooling, then a minimum halo mass arises naturally from the minimumvirial temperature for cooling, t~10^4 k, though for such a small minimum massthe effect is weaker than observed. baryonic feedback effects, which areexpected to stretch the duration of star formation in small galaxies and shutit down in massive haloes at late epochs, are likely to play a subsequent rolein shaping up the final downsizing behaviour. other appearances of downsizing,such as the decline with time of the typical mass of star-forming galaxies, maynot be attributed to the gravitational clustering process but rather arise fromthe gas processes.

astro-ph;0606458	properties of galaxy groups in the sdss: ii.- agn feedback and star  formation truncation	successfully reproducing the galaxy luminosity function and the bimodality inthe galaxy distribution requires a mechanism that can truncate star formationin massive haloes. current models of galaxy formation consider two suchtruncation mechanisms: strangulation, which acts on satellite galaxies, and agnfeedback, which predominantly affects central galaxies. the efficiencies ofthese processes set the blue fraction of galaxies as function of galaxyluminosity and halo mass. in this paper we use a galaxy group catalogueextracted from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) to determine thesefractions. to demonstrate the potential power of this data as a benchmark forgalaxy formation models, we compare the results to the semi-analytical modelfor galaxy formation of croton et al. (2006). although this model accuratelyfits the global statistics of the galaxy population, as well as the shape ofthe conditional luminosity function, there are significant discrepancies whenthe blue fraction of galaxies as a function of mass and luminosity is comparedbetween the observations and the model. in particular, the model predicts (i)too many faint satellite galaxies in massive haloes, (ii) a blue fraction ofsatellites that is much too low, and (iii) a blue fraction of centrals that istoo high and with an inverted luminosity dependence. in the same order, weargue that these discrepancies owe to (i) the neglect of tidal stripping in thesemi-analytical model, (ii) the oversimplified treatment of strangulation, and(iii) improper modeling of dust extinction and/or agn feedback. the datapresented here will prove useful to test and calibrate future models of galaxyformation and in particular to discriminate between various models for agnfeedback and other star formation truncation mechanisms.

astro-ph;0607552	weak lensing by galaxies in groups and clusters: i.--theoretical  expectations	galaxy-galaxy lensing is rapidly becoming one of the most promising means toaccurately measure the average relation between galaxy properties and halomass. in order to obtain a signal of sufficient signal-to-noise, one needs tostack many lens galaxies according to their property of interest, such asluminosity or stellar mass. since such a stack consists of both central andsatellite galaxies, which contribute very different lensing signals, theresulting shear measurements can be difficult to interpret. in the past,galaxy-galaxy lensing studies have either completely ignored this problem, haveapplied rough isolation criteria in an attempt to preferentially select`central' galaxies, or have tried to model the contribution of satellitesexplicitely. however, if one is able to {\it a priori} split the galaxypopulation in central and satellite galaxies, one can measure their lensingsignals separately. this not only allows a much cleaner measurement of therelation between halo mass and their galaxy populations, but also allows adirect measurement of the sub-halo masses around satellite galaxies. in thispaper, we use a realistic mock galaxy redshift survey to show that galaxygroups, properly selected from large galaxy surveys, can be used to accuratelysplit the galaxy population in centrals and satellites. stacking the resultingcentrals according to their group mass, estimated from the total groupluminosity, allows a remarkably accurate recovery of the masses and densityprofiles of their host haloes. in addition, stacking the correspondingsatellite galaxies according to their projected distance from the group centeryields a lensing signal that can be used to accurate measure the masses of bothsub-haloes and host haloes.

astro-ph;0608157	concentration, spin and shape of dark matter haloes: scatter and the  dependence on mass and environment	we use a series of cosmological n-body simulations for a flat lcdm cosmologyto investigate the properties of dark matter haloes in the mass range3.0e9-3.0e13 msun. these properties include the concentration parameter (c),the spin parameter (lambda) and the mean axis ratio (q). for theconcentration-mass relation we find c~m^(-0.11) in agreement with the modelproposed by bullock et al. even if we find a lower normalization (15%). theresults for lambda and q are in good agreement with previous studies, while cand lambda are anti-correlated. in an attempt to remove unrelaxed haloes, weuse the offset parameter (xoff), defined as the distance between the most boundparticle and the center of mass. removing haloes with large xoff increases thec by ~10%, lowers the lambda by ~15%, and removes the most prolate haloes. inaddition, it largely removes the anti-correlation between c and lambda thoughnot entirely. we also investigate the effects of the large-scale environment.we find that more concentrated haloes live in denser environments. note,however, that the trend is weak compared to the scatter. for the spinparameters we find no environment dependence, while there is a weak indicationthat the most spherical haloes reside in denser region. finally, using a simplemodel for disk galaxy formation we show that haloes that host low surfacebrightness galaxies are expected to be hosted by a biased sub-set of haloes.not only do these haloes have spin parameters that are larger than average,they also have c that are 15% percent lower than the average at a given halomass. we discuss the implications of all these findings for the claimeddisagreement between halo concentrations inferred from lsb rotation curves, andthose expected for a lcdm cosmology.

astro-ph;0610686	towards a concordant model of halo occupation statistics	we use the conditional luminosity function (clf) and data from the 2dfgrs toconstrain the average relation between light and mass in a lcdm cosmology withomega_m=0.23 and sigma_8=0.74 (hereafter wmap3 cosmology). reproducing theobserved luminosity dependence of the galaxy two-point correlation functionresults in average mass-to-light ratios that are about 35 percent lower than ina lcdm cosmology with omega_m=0.3 and sigma_8=0.9 (hereafter wmap1 cosmology).this removes an important problem with previous halo occupation models whichhad a tendency to predict cluster mass-to-light ratios that were too high. forthe wmap3 cosmology our model yields average mass-to-light ratios, centralgalaxy luminosities, halo occupation numbers, satellite fractions, andluminosity-gap statistics, that are all in excellent agreement with thoseobtained from a 2dfgrs group catalogue and from other independent studies. wealso use our clf model to compute the probability distribution p(m|l_cen), thata central galaxy of luminosity l_cen resides in a halo of mass m. we find thisdistribution to be much broader than what is typically assumed in hod models,which has important implications for the interpretation of galaxy-galaxylensing data. finally, reproducing the luminosity dependence of the pairwisevelocity dispersions in the 2dfgrs requires relatively low mass-to-light ratiosfor clusters and a satellite fraction that decreases strongly with increasingluminosity. this is only marginally consistent with our clf constraints. weargue that a cosmology with parameters between those of the wmap1 and wmap3cosmologies is likely to yield results with a higher level of consistency.

astro-ph;0701130	the alignment between satellites and central galaxies: theory vs.  observations	recent studies have shown that the distribution of satellite galaxies ispreferentially aligned with the major axis of their central galaxy. thestrength of this alignment has been found to depend strongly on the colours ofthe satellite and central galaxies, and only weakly on the mass of the halo inwhich the galaxies reside. in this paper we study whether these alignmentsignals, and their dependence on galaxy and halo properties, can be reproducedin a hierarchical structure formation model of a $\lambda$cdm concordancecosmology. to that extent we use a large $n$-body simulation which we populatewith galaxies following a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation. we findthat if the orientation of the central galaxy is perfectly aligned with that ofits dark matter halo, then the predicted central-satellite alignment signal ismuch stronger than observed. if, however, the minor axis of a central galaxy isperfectly aligned with the angular momentum vector of its dark matter halo, wecan accurately reproduce the observed alignment strength as function of halomass and galaxy color. although this suggests that the orientation of centralgalaxies is governed by the angular momentum of their dark matter haloes, weemphasize that any other scenario in which the minor axes of central galaxy andhalo are misaligned by $\sim 40^{\circ}$ (on average) will match the dataequally well. finally, we show that dependence of the alignment strength on thecolor of the central galaxy is most likely an artefact due to interlopers inthe group catalogue. the dependence on the color of the satellite galaxies, onthe other hand, is real and owes to the fact that red satellites are associatedwith subhaloes that were more massive at their time of accretion.

astro-ph;9611145	on the uncertainties of the central density in axisymmetric galaxies due  to deprojection	the deprojection of the surface brightness of axisymmetric galaxies isindeterminate unless the galaxy is seen edge-on. in practice, this problem isoften circumvented by making ad hoc assumptions about the density distribution.however, one can redistribute the density and still project to the same surfacebrightness. this is similar to adding so-called konus densities to the assumeddensity distribution. in this paper we investigate the maximum konus densitythat one can add to elliptical galaxies. in particular we focus on theuncertainties in the central densities of axisymmetric, (cusped) ellipticalgalaxies due to the non-uniqueness of the deprojection. in order to estimatethe dynamical influence of konus densities on the central region, we calculatethe mass fraction they can add to the center. we show that this mass fractionis at most a few percent. we also investigate the dynamical effect of cuspedkonus densities we show that konus densities can only be moderately cusped, andthat an increase in cusp slope results in a decrease of the mass fraction addedto the center by the konus density. we illustrate all this by the specificexample of m32, and show that the uncertainty in the central mass due todeprojection is negligible compared to the inferred mass of the central blackhole (bh) in this galaxy.

astro-ph;9806078	nuclear stellar discs in early-type galaxies --- ii. photometric  properties	hubble space telescope images of two early-type galaxies harboring bothnuclear and outer stellar discs are studied in detail. by means of aphotometric decomposition, the images of ngc 4342 and ngc 4570 are analyzed andthe photometric properties of the nuclear discs investigated. we find acontinuity of properties in the parameter space defined by the central surfacebrightness and the scalelength of discs in spirals, s0s and embedded discs inellipticals, in the sense that the nuclear discs extend the observed discproperties even further towards smaller scalelengths and brighter centralsurface brightnesses. when including the nuclear discs, disc properties spanmore than four orders of magnitude in both scalelength and central surfacebrightness. the nuclear discs studied here are the smallest and brighteststellar discs known, and as such, they are as extreme in their photometricproperties as malin i, when compared to typical galactic discs that obeyfreeman's law. we discuss a possible formation scenario in which thedouble-disc structure observed in these galaxies has been shaped by nowdissolved bars. based on the fact that the black holes known to exist in someof these galaxies have masses comparable to those of the nuclear discs, weexplore a possible link between the black holes and the nuclear discs.

astro-ph;9811229	substructure in dark halos: orbital eccentricities and dynamical  friction	we examine the distributions of eccentricities of orbits within massdistributions like those we see for galaxies and clusters. a comprehensiveunderstanding of these orbital properties is essential to calculate the ratesof physical processes relevant to the formation and evolution of galaxies andclusters. we derive the orbital eccentricity distributions for a number ofspherical potentials. these distributions depend strongly on the velocityanisotropy, but only slightly on the shape of the potential. we also presenthigh resolution n-body simulations of the orbital decay of satellite systems oneccentric orbits in an isothermal halo. the dynamical friction timescales arefound to decrease with increasing orbital eccentricity, but the dependence isweaker than previously suggested. the orbital eccentricity stays remarkablyconstant throughout the decay; although the eccentricity decreases nearpericenter, it increases again near apocenter, such that there is no netcircularization. finally, we discuss a number of applications. we find that thedistribution of orbital eccentricities of the globular clusters in the milkyway is consistent with a close to isotropic velocity distribution. the limiteddata on the galactic system of satellites, however, appears to be different andwarrants further investigation as a clue to the formation and evolution of ourmilky way and its halo substructure.

astro-ph;9909298	semi-analytical models for the formation of disk galaxies: i.  constraints from the tully-fisher relation	we present new semi-analytical models for the formation of disk galaxies withthe purpose of investigating the origin of the near-infrared tully-fisher (tf)relation. the models assume that disks are formed by cooling of the baryonsinside dark halos with realistic density profiles, and that the baryonsconserve their specific angular momentum. only gas with densities above thecritical density given by toomre's stability criterion is considered eligiblefor star formation, and a simple recipe for supernovae feedback is included. weemphasize the importance of extracting the proper luminosity and velocitymeasures from the models, something that has often been ignored in the past.the observed k-band tf relation has a slope that is steeper than simplepredictions based on dynamical arguments suggest. taking the stability relatedstar formation threshold densities into account steepens the tf relation,decreases its scatter, and yields gas mass fractions that are in excellentagreement with observations. in order for the tf slope to be as steep asobserved, further physics are required. we argue that the characteristics ofthe observed near-infrared tf relation do not reflect systematic variations instellar populations, or cosmological initial conditions, but are governed byfeedback. finally we show that our models provide a natural explanation for thesmall amount of scatter that makes the tf relation useful as a cosmologicaldistance indicator.

astro-ph;9911372	constraints on the structure of dark matter halos from the rotation  curves of low surface brightness galaxies	we re-examine the disk-halo decompositions of the rotation curves of lowsurface brightness (lsb) galaxies with v_max &gt; 80 km/s, taking full account ofthe effects of beam smearing. we show that the rotation curves of these lsbgalaxies are, contrary to previous claims, consistent with dark halos withsteep central cusps in their density distribution. in fact, the spatialresolution of the data is not sufficient to put any meaningful constraints onthe density profiles of their dark halos, or on cosmological parameters. thishas important implications for numerous claims made in the literature regardingthe halos of lsb galaxies, such as the self-similarity of their rotationcurves, and their inconsistency with certain cosmological models or with colddark matter altogether. only in one case is the data of sufficient spatialresolution to obtain reliable constraints on the slope of the central densitydistribution of the dark matter halo. for this single case, we find a centraldensity cusp with a slope 0.55 &lt; alpha &lt; 1.26 at the 99.73 percent confidencelevels. this contrasts strongly with the results for two dwarf galaxies (v_max&lt; 70 km/s) that we analyze, which yield alpha &lt; 0.5 at the same level ofconfidence. this possibly suggests that halos with constant density cores arerestricted to low-mass systems. we show that violent outflows of baryonicmatter by supernovae feedback can reproduce this mass-dependence of halo cuspslopes.

astro-ph;9912004	semi-analytical models for the formation of disk galaxies ii. dark  matter versus modified newtonian dynamics	we present detailed semi-analytical models for the formation of disk galaxiesboth in a universe dominated by dark matter (dm), and in one for which theforce law is given by modified newtonian dynamics (mond). we tune the models tofit the observed near-infrared tully-fisher (tf) relation, and compare numerouspredictions of the resulting models with observations. the dm and mond modelsare almost indistinguishable. they both yield gas mass fractions and dynamicalmass-to-light ratios which are in good agreement with observations. both modelsreproduce the narrow relation between global mass-to-light ratio and centralsurface brightness, and reveal a characteristic acceleration, contrary toclaims that these relations are not predicted by dm models. both models requiresn feedback in order to reproduce the lack of high surface brightness dwarfgalaxies. however, the introduction of feedback to the mond models steepens thetf relation and increases the scatter, making mond only marginally consistentwith observations. the most serious problem for the dm models is theirprediction of steep central rotation curves. however, the dm rotation curvesare only slightly steeper than those of mond, and are only marginallyinconsistent with the poor resolution data on lsb galaxies.

0810.2794	the correlation of star formation quenching with internal galaxy  properties and environment	we investigate the correlation of star formation quenching with internalgalaxy properties and large scale environment (halo mass) in empirical data andtheoretical models. we make use of the halo-based group catalog of yang andcollaborators, which is based on the sloan digital sky survey. data from thegalaxy evolution explorer (galex) are also used to extract the recent starformation rate. in order to investigate the environmental effects, we examinethe properties of "central" and "satellite" galaxies separately. for centralgalaxies, we are unable to conclude whether star formation quenching isprimarily connected with halo mass or stellar mass, because these twoquantities are themselves strongly correlated. for satellite galaxies, a nearlyequally strong dependence on halo mass and stellar mass is seen. we make thesame comparison for five different semi-analytic models based on threeindependently developed codes. we find that the models with agn feedbackreproduce reasonably well the dependence of the fraction of central red andpassive galaxies on halo mass and stellar mass. however, for satellitegalaxies, the same models badly overproduce the fraction of red/passivegalaxies and do not reproduce the empirical trends with stellar mass or halomass. this {\em satellite overquenching problem} is caused by the too-rapidstripping of the satellites' hot gas halos, which leads to rapid strangulationof star formation.

0706.0262	spatial and kinematic alignments between central and satellite halos	based on a cosmological n-body simulation we analyze spatial and kinematicalignments of satellite halos within six times the virial radius of group sizehost halos (rvir). we measure three different types of spatial alignment: haloalignment between the orientation of the group central substructure (gcs) andthe distribution of its satellites, radial alignment between the orientation ofa satellite and the direction towards its gcs, and direct alignment between theorientation of the gcs and that of its satellites. in analogy we use thedirections of satellite velocities and probe three further types of alignment:the radial velocity alignment between the satellite velocity and connectingline between satellite and gcs, the halo velocity alignment between theorientation of the gcs and satellite velocities and the auto velocity alignmentbetween the satellites orientations and their velocities. we find thatsatellites are preferentially located along the major axis of the gcs within atleast 6 rvir (the range probed here). furthermore, satellites preferentiallypoint towards the gcs. the most pronounced signal is detected on small scalesbut a detectable signal extends out to 6 rvir. the direct alignment signal isweaker, however a systematic trend is visible at distances &lt; 2 rvir. allvelocity alignments are highly significant on small scales. our results suggestthat the halo alignment reflects the filamentary large scale structure whichextends far beyond the virial radii of the groups. in contrast, the maincontribution to the radial alignment arises from the adjustment of thesatellite orientations in the group tidal field. the projected data reveal goodagreement with recent results derived from large galaxy surveys.

0704.0931	the isophotal structure of early-type galaxies in the sdss: dependence  on agn activity and environment	we study the dependence of the isophotal shape of early-type galaxies ontheir absolute b-band magnitude, their dynamical mass, and their nuclearactivity and environment, using an unprecedented large sample of 847 early-typegalaxies identified in the sdss by hao et al (2006). we find that the fractionof disky galaxies smoothly decreases with increasing luminosity. the largesample allows us to describe these trends accurately with tight linearrelations that are statistically robust against the uncertainty in theisophotal shape measurements. there is also a host of significant correlationsbetween the disky fraction and indicators of nuclear activity (both in theoptical and in the radio) and environment (soft x-rays, group mass, grouphierarchy). our analysis shows however that these correlations can beaccurately matched by assuming that the disky fraction depends only on galaxyluminosity or mass. we therefore conclude that neither the level of activity,nor group mass or group hierarchy help in better predicting the isophotal shapeof early-type galaxies.

0704.0932	on the origin of the dichotomy of early-type galaxies: the role of dry  mergers and agn feedback	using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a largen-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-typegalaxies. we find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitormass ratio $n &lt; 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $f_{\rm cold} &lt;0.1$. our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems asa function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies andsatellites. after correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties ofthe last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halomass. this provides theoretical support for the conjecture of pasquali et al(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter thatgoverns its isophotal shape. we argue that the observed dichotomy of early-typegalaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, anddoes not require agn feedback. rather, we argue that it owes to the fact thatmore massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. each of these threetrends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massiveearly-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. finally,our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxiesform in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $m_* &lt; 2 \times 10^{10} h^{-1}\msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low massearly-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last majormerger. the latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have centralcusps, while their massive counterparts have cores.

0810.4963	the impact of feedback on disk galaxy scaling relations	we use a disk galaxy evolution model to investigate the impact of massoutflows (a.k.a. feedback) on disk galaxy scaling relations. our model followsthe accretion, cooling, star formation and ejection of baryonic mass insidegrowing dark matter haloes, with cosmologically motivated specific angularmomentum distributions. models without feedback produce disks that are toosmall and rotate too fast. feedback reduces the baryonic masses of galaxies,resulting in larger disks with lower rotation velocities. models with feedbackcan reproduce the zero points of the scaling relations between rotationvelocity, stellar mass and disk size, but only in the absence of adiabaticcontraction. our feedback mechanism is maximally efficient in expelling mass,but our successful models require 25% of the sn energy, or 100% of the snmomentum, to drive the outflows. it remains to be seen whether such highefficiencies are realistic or not. our energy and momentum driven wind modelsresult in different slopes of various scaling relations, such as size - stellarmass, stellar mass - halo mass, and metallicity - stellar mass. observationsfavor the energy driven wind at stellar masses below mstar = 10^{10.5} msun,but the momentum driven wind model at high masses. the ratio between thespecific angular momentum of the baryons to that of the halo, (j_gal/m_gal), isnot unity in our models. yet this is the standard assumption in models of diskgalaxy formation. feedback preferentially ejects low angular momentum materialbecause star formation is more efficient at smaller galactic radii. thisresults in (j_gal/m_gal) increasing with decreasing halo mass. this effecthelps to resolve the discrepancy between the high spin parameters observed fordwarf galaxies with the low spin parameters predicted from lcdm.

0812.3723	the nature of red dwarf galaxies	using dark matter halos traced by galaxy groups selected from the sloandigital sky survey data release 4, we find that about 1/4 of the faint galaxies($\rmag &gt;-17.05$, hereafter dwarfs) that are the central galaxies in their ownhalo are not blue and star forming, as expected in standard models of galaxyformation, but are red. in contrast, this fraction is about 1/2 for dwarfsatellite galaxies. many red dwarf galaxies are physically associated with moremassive halos. in total, about $\sim 45$% of red dwarf galaxies reside inmassive halos as satellites, while another $\sim 25$% have a spatialdistribution that is much more concentrated towards their nearest massivehaloes than other dwarf galaxies. we use mock catalogs to show that the reddestpopulation of non-satellite dwarf galaxies are distributed within about 3 timesthe virial radii of their nearest massive halos. we suggest that thispopulation of dwarf galaxies are hosted by low-mass halos that have passedthrough their massive neighbors, and that the same environmental effects thatcause satellite galaxies to become red are also responsible for the red colorsof this population of galaxies. we do not find any significant radialdependence of the population of dwarf galaxies with the highest concentrations,suggesting that the mechanisms operating on these galaxies affect color morethan structure. however, over 30% of dwarf galaxies are red and isolated andtheir origin remains unknown.
