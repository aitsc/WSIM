0706.1518	grb051022: physical parameters and extinction of a prototype dark burst	grb051022 was undetected to deep limits in early optical observations, butprecise astrometry from radio and x-ray showed that it most likely originatedin a galaxy at z~0.8. we report radio, optical, near infra-red and x-rayobservations of grb051022. using the available x-ray and radio data, we modelthe afterglow and calculate the energetics of the afterglow, finding it to bean order of magnitude lower than that of the prompt emission. the broad-bandmodeling also allows us to precisely define various other physical parametersand the minimum required amount of extinction, to explain the absence of anoptical afterglow. our observations suggest a high extinction, at least 2.3magnitudes in the infrared (j) and at least 5.4 magnitudes in the optical (u)in the host-galaxy restframe. such high extinctions are unusual for grbs, andlikely indicate a geometry where our line of sight to the burst passes througha dusty region in the host that is not directly co-located with the burstitself.

0905.4499	cosmic evolution of submillimeter galaxies and their contribution to  stellar mass assembly	the nature of galaxies selected at submillimeter wavelengths (smgs, s_850 &gt; 3mjy), some of the bolometrically most luminous objects at high redshifts, isstill elusive. in particular their star formation histories and source ofemission are not accurately constrained. in this paper we introduce a newapproach to analyse the smg data. namely, we present the first self-consistentuv-to-radio spectral energy distribution fits of 76 smgs with spectroscopicredshifts using all photometric datapoints from ultraviolet to radiosimultaneously. we find that they are highly star-forming (median starformation rate 713 msun yr^-1 for smgs at z&gt;0.5), moderately dust-obscured(median a_v~2 mag), hosting significant stellar populations (median stellarmass 3.7x10^11 msun) of which only a minor part has been formed in the ongoingstarburst episode. this implies that in the past, smgs experienced eitheranother starburst episode or merger with several galaxies. the properties ofsmgs suggest that they are progenitors of present-day elliptical galaxies. wefind that these bright smgs contribute significantly to the cosmic starformation rate density (~20%) and stellar mass density (~30-50%) at redshifts2-4. using number counts at low fluxes we find that as much as 80% of thecosmic star formation at these redshifts took place in smgs brighter than 0.1mjy. we find evidence that a linear infrared-radio correlation holds for smgsin an unchanged form up to redshift of 3.6, though its normalization is offsetfrom the local relation by a factor of ~2.1 towards higher radio luminosities.we present a compilation of photometry data of smgs and determinations ofcosmic sfr and stellar mass densities.

1002.2636	rapid dust production in submillimeter galaxies at z&gt;4?	the existence of submillimeter-selected galaxies (smgs) at redshifts z&gt;4 hasrecently been confirmed. using simultaneously all the available data from uv toradio we have modeled the spectral energy distributions of the six knownspectroscopically confirmed smgs at z&gt;4. we find that their star formationrates (average ~2500 msun yr^{-1}), stellar (~3.6x10^{11} msun) and dust(~6.7x10^{8} msun) masses, extinction (a_v~2.2 mag), and gas-to-dust ratios(~60) are within the ranges for 1.7&lt;z&lt;3.6 smgs. our analysis suggests thatinfrared-to-radio luminosity ratios of smgs do not change up to redshift ~5 andare lower by a factor of ~2.1 than the value corresponding to the localir-radio correlation. however, we also find dissimilarities between z&gt;4 andlower-redshift smgs. those at z&gt;4 tend to be among the most star-forming, leastmassive and hottest (~60 k) smgs and exhibit the highest fraction of stellarmass formed in the ongoing starburst (~45%). this indicates that at z&gt;4 we seeearlier stages of evolution of submillimeter-bright galaxies. using the derivedproperties for z&gt;4 smgs we investigate the origin of dust at epochs less than1.5 gyr after the big bang. this is significant to our understanding of theevolution of the early universe. for three z&gt;4 smgs, asymptotic giant branchstars could be the dominant dust producers. however, for the remaining threeonly supernovae (sne) are efficient and fast enough to be responsible for dustproduction, though requiring a very high dust yield per sn (0.15-0.65 msun).the required dust yields are lower if a top-heavy initial mass function orsignificant dust growth in the interstellar medium is assumed. we estimatelower limits of the contribution of smgs to the cosmic star formation andstellar mass densities at z~4-5 to be ~4% and ~1%, respectively.

1002.4101	no evidence for dust extinction in grb 050904 at z ~ 6.3	context: grb afterglows are excellent probes of gas and dust in star-forminggalaxies at all epochs. it has been posited that dust in the early universemust be different from dust at lower z. to date two reports directly supportthis contention, one of which is based on the spectral shape of grb 050904 at z= 6.295. aims: we reinvestigate the afterglow to understand dust at high z. weaddress the claimed evidence for unusual (sn-origin) dust in its host galaxy bysimultaneously examining the x-ray and optical/nir spectrophotometric data.methods: we derive the intrinsic sed of the afterglow at 0.47, 1.25 and 3.4days, by re-reducing the swift x-ray data, the 1.25 days fors2 z-gunnphotometric data, the spectroscopic and z'-band photometric data at ~3 daysfrom the subaru telescope, as well as the critical ukirt z-band photometry at0.47 days, upon which the claim of dust detection largely relies. results: wefind no evidence of dust extinction in the sed. we compute flux densities atlambda_rest = 1250 aa directly from the observed counts at all epochs. in theearliest epoch, 0.47 days, the z-band suppression is found to be smaller (0.3+- 0.2 mag) than previously reported and statistically insignificant (&lt;1.5sigma). furthermore we find that the photometry of this band is unstable anddifficult to calibrate. conclusions: from the afterglow sed we demonstrate thatthere is no evidence for dust extinction -- the sed at all times can bereproduced without dust, and at 1.25 days in particular, significant extinctioncan be excluded, with a(3000 aa) &lt; 0.27 mag at 95% confidence using the sn-typeextinction curve. we conclude that there is no evidence of any extinction inthe afterglow of grb 050904 and that the presence of sn-origin dust in the hostof grb 050904 must be viewed skeptically.

1101.1553	genesis and evolution of dust in galaxies in the early universe ii.  rapid dust evolution in quasars at z &gt; 6	we assess the most plausible scenarios for generating large amounts of dustin high-z quasars (qsos) on the basis of observationally derived physicalproperties of qsos at z &gt; 6. we use a chemical evolution model to compute thetemporal progression of quantities, such as the amount of dust and gas, stellarmasses, star formation rates (sfrs) and the metallicity for variouscombinations of the initial mass function (imf), the mass of the galaxy, dustproduction efficiencies, and the degree of dust destruction in the ism. weinvestigate the influence of the sfr on the evolution of these quantities, anddetermine the earliest epochs at which agreement with observations can beachieved. we apply the obtained results to individual qsos at z &gt; 6. we findthat large quantities of dust can be generated rapidly as early as 30 myr afterthe onset of the starburst when the sfr of the starburst is &gt; 10^3 m_sunyr^(-1). the amount of dust and several other physical quantities of individualqsos at z &gt; 6 are satisfactorily reproduced by models at epochs 30, 70, 100,and 170 myr for galaxies with initial gas masses of 1-3 x 10^11 m_sun. the bestagreement with observations is obtained with top-heavy imfs. a sizable dustcontribution from supernovae (sne) is however required, while at these epochsdust production by asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars is negligible. moderatedust destruction in the ism can be accommodated.

1108.6058	the stellar masses and specific star-formation rates of submillimetre  galaxies	establishing the stellar masses (m*), and hence specific star-formation rates(ssfrs) of submillimetre galaxies (smgs) is crucial for determining their rolein the cosmic galaxy/star formation. however, there is as yet no consensus overthe typical m* of smgs. specifically, even for the same set of smgs, thereported average m* have ranged over an order of magnitude, from ~5x10^10 mo to~5x10^11 mo. here we study how different methods of analysis can lead to suchwidely varying results. we find that, contrary to recent claims in theliterature, potential contamination of irac 3-8 um photometry from hot dustassociated with an active nucleus is not the origin of the publisheddiscrepancies in derived m*. instead, we expose in detail how inferred m*depends on assumptions made in the photometric fitting, and quantify theindividual and cumulative effects of different choices of initial massfunction, different brands of evolutionary synthesis models, and differentforms of assumed star-formation history. we review current observationalevidence for and against these alternatives as well as clues from thehydrodynamical simulations, and conclude that, for the most justifiable choicesof these model inputs, the average m* of smgs is ~2x10^11 mo. we also confirmthat this number is perfectly reasonable in the light of the latestmeasurements of their dynamical masses, and the evolving m* function of theoverall galaxy population. m* of this order imply that the average ssfr of smgsis comparable to that of other star-forming galaxies at z&gt;2, at 2-3 gyr^-1.this supports the view that, while rare outliers may be found at any m*, mostsmgs simply form the top end of the main-sequence of star-forming galaxies atthese redshifts. conversely, this argues strongly against the viewpoint thatsmgs are extreme pathological objects, of little relevance in the cosmichistory of star-formation.

1111.4527	the highly energetic expansion of sn2010bh associated with grb 100316d	we present the spectroscopic and photometric evolution of the nearby (z =0.059) spectroscopically confirmed type ic supernova, sn 2010bh, associatedwith the soft, long-duration gamma-ray burst (x-ray flash) grb 100316d.intensive follow-up observations of sn 2010bh were performed at the eso verylarge telescope (vlt) using the x-shooter and fors2 instruments. owing to thedetailed temporal coverage and the extended wavelength range (3000--24800 a),we obtained an unprecedentedly rich spectral sequence among the hypernovae,making sn 2010bh one of the best studied representatives of this sn class. wefind that sn 2010bh has a more rapid rise to maximum brightness (8.0 +/- 1.0rest-frame days) and a fainter absolute peak luminosity (l_bol~3e42 erg/s) thanpreviously observed sn events associated with grbs. our estimate of the ejected(56)ni mass is 0.12 +/- 0.02 msun. from the broad spectral features we measureexpansion velocities up to 47,000 km/s, higher than those of sne 1998bw (grb980425) and 2006aj (grb 060218). helium absorption lines he i lambda5876 and hei 1.083 microm, blueshifted by ~20,000--30,000 km/s and ~28,000--38,000 km/s,respectively, may be present in the optical spectra. however, the lack ofcoverage of the he i 2.058 microm line prevents us from confirming suchidentifications. the nebular spectrum, taken at ~186 days after the explosion,shows a broad but faint [o i] emission at 6340 a. the light-curve shape andphotospheric expansion velocities of sn 2010bh suggest that we witnessed ahighly energetic explosion with a small ejected mass (e_k ~ 1e52 erg and m_ej ~3 msun). the observed properties of sn 2010bh further extend the heterogeneityof the class of grb supernovae.

0710.5636	where is the matter in the merging cluster abell 2218?	we present a parametric strong lensing model of the cluster abell 2218 basedon hst acs data. we constrain the lens model using 8 previously known multiplyimaged systems, of which 7 have spectroscopically confirmed redshifts. inaddition, we propose five candidate multiply imaged systems and estimate theirredshifts using our mass model. the model parameters are optimized in thesource plane by a bayesian monte carlo markov chain as implemented in the thepublicly available software lenstool. we find rms=0."12 for the scatter of thesources in the source plane, which translates into rms=1."49 between thepredicted and measured image positions in the image plane. we find that theprojected mass distribution of abell 2218 is bimodal, which is supported by ananalysis of the light distribution. we also find evidence for two structures invelocity space, separated by ~1000 km/s, corresponding to the two large scaledark matter clumps. we find that the lensing constraints can not be wellreproduced using only dark matter halos associated with the cluster galaxies,but that the dark matter is required to be smoothly distributed in large scalehalos. at 100" the enclosed projected mass is 3.8e14 solar masses. at thatradius, the large scale halos contribute ~85% of the mass. we find that themodel is not very sensitive to the fainter galaxy sized halos, unless theylocally perturb a given multiply imaged system. therefore, dark galaxy sizedsubstructure can be reliably constrained only if it locally perturbs one of thesystems. in an appendix we give a self-contained description of the parametricprofile we use, the dual pseudo isothermal elliptical mass distribution (dpie).this profile is a two component pseudo isothermal mass distribution (piemd)with both a core radii and a scale radii.

1204.5217	collisionless dynamics in globular clusters	since globular clusters (gcs) are old, low-n systems their dynamics is widelybelieved to be fully dominated by collisional two-body processes, and theirsurface brightness profiles are fit by king models. however, for many gcs,especially those with hst-resolved central regions, and `extra-tidal' features,king models provide poor fits. we suggest that this is partly becausecollisionless dynamics is also important and contribute to shaping the clusterproperties. we show using time-scale and length-scale arguments that except forthe very centers of clusters, collisionless dynamics should be more importantthan collisional. we then fit 38 gcs analyzed by noyola and gebhardt (2006)with (collisional) king and (collisionless) darkexp models over the fullavailable radial range, and find that the latter provide a better fit to 29gcs; for six of these the fit is at least ~5x better in term of rms. darkexpmodels are theoretically derived maximum entropy equilibrium states ofself-gravitating collisionless systems and have already been shown to fit theresults of dark matter n-body simulations.

1205.3162	the optically unbiased grb host (tough) survey. i. survey design and  catalogs	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are powerful tracers of star-forminggalaxies. we have defined a homogeneous subsample of 69 swift grb-selectedgalaxies spanning a very wide redshift range. special attention has beendevoted to making the sample optically unbiased through simple and well-definedselection criteria based on the high-energy properties of the bursts and theirpositions on the sky. thanks to our extensive follow-up observations, thissample has now achieved a comparatively high degree of redshift completeness,and thus provides a legacy sample, useful for statistical studies of grbs andtheir host galaxies. in this paper we present the survey design and summarizethe results of our observing program conducted at the eso very large telescope(vlt) aimed at obtaining the most basic properties of galaxies in this sample,including a catalog of r and ks magnitudes and redshifts. we detect the hostgalaxies for 80 % of the grbs in the sample, although only 42 % have ks-banddetections, which confirms that grb-selected host galaxies are generally blue.the sample is not uniformly blue, however, with two extremely red objectsdetected. moreover, galaxies hosting grbs with no optical/nir afterglows, whoseidentification therefore relies on x-ray localizations, are significantlybrighter and redder than those with an optical/nir afterglow. our spectroscopiccampaign has resulted in 77 % now having redshift measurements, with a medianredshift of 2.14 +- 0.18. tough alone includes 17 detected z &gt; 2 swift grb hostgalaxies suitable for individual and statistical studies. seven hosts havedetections of the ly-alpha emission line and we can exclude an early indicationthat ly-alpha emission is ubiquitous among grb hosts, but confirm that ly-alphais stronger in grb-selected galaxies than in flux-limited samples of lymanbreak galaxies.

1210.7681	the rates and time-delay distribution of multiply imaged supernovae  behind lensing clusters	time delays of gravitationally lensed sources can be used to constrain themass model of a deflector and determine cosmological parameters. we herepresent an analysis of the time-delay distribution of multiply imaged sourcesbehind 17 strong lensing galaxy clusters with well-calibrated mass models. wefind that for time delays less than 1000 days, at z=3.0, their logarithmicprobability distribution functions are well represented by p (log \delta t)=5.3x 10^-4 \delta t^\beta m_250^-2\beta, with \beta=0.77, where m_250 is theprojected cluster mass inside 250 kpc (in 10^14 m_sun), and \beta is thepower-law slope of the distribution. the resultant probability distributionfunction enables us to estimate the time-delay distribution in a lensingcluster of known mass. for a cluster with m_250=2 x 10^14 m_sun, the fractionof time delays less than 1000 days is approximately 3%. taking abell 1689 as anexample, its dark halo and brightest galaxies, with central velocitydispersions larger than 500 km/s, mainly produce large time delays, whilegalaxy-scale mass clumps are responsible for generating smaller time delays. weestimate the probability of observing multiple images of a supernova in theknown images of abell 1689. a two-component model of estimating the supernovarate is applied in this work. for a magnitude threshold of m_ab=26.5, theyearly rate of type ia (core-collapse) supernovae with time delays less than1000 days is 0.004 +- 0.002 (0.029 +- 0.001). if the magnitude threshold islowered to m_ab ~ 27.0, the rate of core-collapse supernovae suitable for timedelay observation is 0.044 +- 0.015 per year.

1304.2337	on inferring extinction laws in z~6 quasars as signatures of supernova  dust	unusual extinction curves of high-redshift qsos have been taken as evidencethat dust is primarily produced by supernovae at high redshift. in particular,the 3000 a todini-ferrara-maiolino kink in the extinction curve of the z = 6.20sdss j1048+4637 has been attributed to supernova dust. here we discuss thechallenges in inferring robust extinction curves of high-redshift qsos andcritically assess previous claims of detection of supernova dust. inparticular, we address the sensitivity to the choice of intrinsic qso spectrum,the need for a long wavelength baseline, and the drawbacks in fittingtheoretical extinction curves. in a sample of 21 qsos at z ~ 6 we detectsignificant ultraviolet extinction using existing broad-band optical,near-infrared, and spitzer photometry. the median extinction curve isconsistent with a small magellanic cloud curve with a_1450 ~ 0.7 mag and doesnot exhibit any conspicuous (restframe) 2175 a or 3000 a features. for twoqsos, sdss j1044-0125 at z = 5.78 and sdss j1030+0524 at z = 6.31, we furtherpresent x-shooter spectra covering the wavelength range 0.9-2.5 um. theresulting non-parametric extinction curves do not exhibit the 3000 a kink.finally, in a re-analysis of literature spectra of sdss j1048+4637, we do notfind evidence for a conspicuous kink. we conclude that the existing evidencefor a 3000 a feature is weak and that the overall dust properties at high andlow redshift show no significant differences. this, however, does not precludesupernovae from dominating the dust budget at high redshift.

1306.4585	grb 081007 and grb 090424: the surrounding medium, outflows and  supernovae	we discuss the results of the analysis of multi-wavelength data for theafterglows of grb 081007 and grb 090424, two bursts detected by swift. one ofthem, grb 081007, also shows a spectroscopically confirmed supernova, sn2008hw, which resembles sn 1998bw in its absorption features, while the maximumluminosity is only about half as large as that of sn 1998bw. bright opticalflashes have been detected in both events, which allows us to derive solidconstraints on the circumburst-matter density profile. this is particularlyinteresting in the case of grb 081007, whose afterglow is found to bepropagating into a constant-density medium, yielding yet another example of agrb clearly associated with a massive star progenitor which did not sculpt thesurroundings with its stellar wind. there is no supernova component detected inthe afterglow of grb 090424, likely due to the brightness of the host galaxy,comparable to the milky way. we show that the afterglow data are consistentwith the presence of both forward- and reverse-shock emission powered byrelativistic outflows expanding into the interstellar medium. the absence ofoptical peaks due to the forward shock strongly suggests that the reverse shockregions should be mildly magnetized. the initial lorentz factor of outflow ofgrb 081007 is estimated to be \gamma ~ 200, while for grb 090424 a lower limitof \gamma &gt; 170 is derived. we also discuss the prompt emission of grb 081007,which consists of just a single pulse. we argue that neither the externalforward-shock model nor the shock-breakout model can account for the promptemission data and suggest that the single-pulse-like prompt emission may be dueto magnetic energy dissipation of a poynting-flux dominated outflow or to adissipative photosphere.

1306.5389	sn 2007uy - metamorphosis of an aspheric type ib explosion	the supernovae of type ibc are rare and the detailed characteristics of theseexplosions have been studied only for a few events. unlike type ii sne, theprogenitors of type ibc have never been detected in pre-explosion images. so,to understand the nature of their progenitors and the characteristics of theexplosions, investigation of proximate events are necessary. here we presentthe results of multi-wavelength observations of type ib sn 2007uy in the nearby($\sim$ 29.5 mpc) galaxy ngc 2770. analysis of the photometric observationsrevealed this explosion as an energetic event with peak absolute r bandmagnitude $-18.5\pm0.16$, which is about one mag brighter than the mean value($-17.6\pm0.6$) derived for well observed type ibc events. the sn is highlyextinguished, e(b-v) = 0.63$\pm$0.15 mag, mainly due to foreground materialpresent in the host galaxy. from optical light curve modeling we determine thatabout 0.3 m$_{\odot}$ radioactive $^{56}$ni is produced and roughly 4.4m$_{\odot}$ material is ejected during this explosion with liberated energy$\sim 15\times10^{51}$ erg, indicating the event to be an energetic one.through optical spectroscopy, we have noticed a clear aspheric evolution ofseveral line forming regions, but no dependency of asymmetry is seen on thedistribution of $^{56}$ni inside the ejecta. the sn shock interaction with thecircumburst material is clearly noticeable in radio follow-up, presenting asynchrotron self absorption (ssa) dominated light curve with a contribution offree free absorption (ffa) during the early phases. assuming a wr star, withwind velocity $\ga 10^3 {\rm km s}^{-1}$, as a progenitor, we derive a lowerlimit to the mass loss rate inferred from the radio data as $\dot{m} \ga2.4\times10^{-5}$ m$_{\odot}$, yr$^{-1}$, which is consistent with the resultsobtained for other type ibc sne bright at radio frequencies.

1401.5085	statistical mechanics of collisionless orbits. iv. distribution of  angular momentum	it has been shown in previous work that darkexp, which is a theoreticallyderived, maximum entropy, one shape parameter model for isotropic collisionlesssystems, provides very good fits to simulated and observed dark-matter halos.specifically, it fits the energy distribution, n(e), and the density profiles,including the central cusp. here, we extend darkexp n(e) to include thedistribution in angular momentum, l^2, for spherically symmetric systems.first, we argue, based on theoretical, semi-analytical, and simulation results,that while dark-matter halos are relaxed in energy, they are not nearly asrelaxed in angular momentum, which precludes using maximum entropy to uniquelyderive n(e,l^2). instead, we require that when integrating n(e,l^2) oversquared angular momenta one retrieves the darkexp n(e). starting with a generalexpression for n(e,l^2) we show how the distribution of particles in l^2 isrelated to the shape of the velocity distribution function, vdf, and velocityanisotropy profile, \beta(r). we then demonstrate that astrophysicallyrealistic halos, as judged by the vdf shape and \beta(r), must have linear orconvex distributions in l^2, for each separate energy bin. the distribution inenergy of the most bound particles must be nearly flat, and become more tiltedin favor of radial orbits for less bound particles. these results areconsistent with numerical simulations and represent an important step towardsderiving the full distribution function for spherically symmetric dark-matterhalos.

1401.5578	shaping the dust mass - star-formation rate relation	there is a remarkably tight relation between the observationally inferreddust masses and star-formation rates (sfrs) of sdss galaxies, mdust $\propto$sfr$^{1.11}$ (da cunha et al. 2010). here we extend the mdust-sfr relation tothe high end and show that it bends over at very large sfrs (i.e., dust massesare lower than predicted for a given sfr). we identify several distinctevolutionary processes in the diagram: (1) a star-bursting phase in which dustbuilds up rapidly at early times. the maximum attainable dust mass in thisprocess is the cause of the bend-over of the relation. a high dust-formationefficiency, a bottom-light initial mass function, and negligible supernovashock dust destruction are required to produce sufficiently high dust masses.(2) a quiescent star-forming phase in which the subsequent parallel decline indust mass and sfr gives rise to the mdust-sfr relation, through astration anddust destruction. the dust-to-gas ratio is approximately constant along therelation. we show that the power-law slope of the mdust-sfr relation isinversely proportional to the global schmidt-kennicutt law exponent (i.e.,$\sim 0.9$) in simple chemical evolution models. (3) a quenching phase whichcauses star formation to drop while the dust mass stays roughly constant ordrops proportionally. combined with merging, these processes, as well as therange in total baryonic mass, give rise to a complex population of the diagramwhich adds significant scatter to the original mdust-sfr relation. (4) at veryhigh redshifts, a population of galaxies located significantly below the localrelation is predicted.

1401.7978	type ia supernova rate measurements to redshift 2.5 from candels :  searching for prompt explosions in the early universe	the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels)was a multi-cycle treasury program on the hubble space telescope (hst) thatsurveyed a total area of ~0.25 deg^2 with ~900 hst orbits spread across 5fields over 3 years. within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae(sn) of all types, out to z~2.5. we classify ~24 of these as type ia sn (sn ia)based on host-galaxy redshifts and sn photometry (supplemented by grismspectroscopy of 6 sn). here we present a measurement of the volumetric sn iarate as a function of redshift, reaching for the first time beyond z=2 andputting new constraints on sn ia progenitor models. our highest redshift binincludes detections of sn that exploded when the universe was only ~3 gyr oldand near the peak of the cosmic star-formation history. this gives the candelshigh-redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of sn ia thatexplode promptly after formation (&lt;500 myr). combining the candels rates withall available sn ia rate measurements in the literature we find that thisprompt sn ia fraction is fp=0.53 +0.09 -0.10 (stat) +0.10 -0.26 (sys),consistent with a delay time distribution that follows a simple t^{-1} powerlaw for all times t&gt;40 myr. however, a mild tension is apparent betweenground-based low-z surveys and space-based high-z surveys. in both candels andthe sister hst program clash, we find a low rate of sn ia at z&gt;1. this could bea hint that prompt progenitors are in fact relatively rare, accounting for only~20% of all sn ia explosions -- though further analysis and larger samples willbe needed to examine that suggestion.

1407.3506	light curve properties of supernovae associated with gamma-ray bursts	little is known about the diversity in the light curves of grb-sne, includingwhether the light curve of sn 1998bw can be used as a representative templateor whether there is a luminosity-decline rate relation akin to that of sne ia.in this paper, we aim to obtain well-constrained light curves of grb-snewithout the assumption of empirical or parametric templates and to investigatewhether the peak brightness correlates with other parameters such as the lightcurve shape or the time of peak. we select eight sne in the redshift range0.0085 to 0.606, which are firmly associated with grbs. the light curves ofthese grb-sne are well sampled across the peak. afterglow and host galaxycontributions are subtracted and dust reddening is corrected for. low-orderpolynomial functions are fitted to the light curves. a k-correction is appliedto transform the light curves into the rest frame v band. grb-sne follow aluminosity-decline rate relation similar to the phillips relation for sne ia,with $m_{v,peak} = 1.59^{+0.28}_{-0.24} \delta m_{v,15} -20.61^{+0.19}_{-0.22}$, with $\chi^2 = 5.2$ for 6 dof and $m_{v,peak}$ and$\delta m_{v,15}$ being the peak magnitude and decline rate in v band. thisluminosity-decline rate relation is tighter than the k-s relation, where k ands are the factors describing the relative brightness and width to the lightcurve of sn 1998bw. the peak luminosities of grb-sne are also correlated withthe time of peak: the brighter the grb-sn, the longer the rise time. the lightcurve of sn 1998bw stretched around the time of explosion can be used as atemplate for grb-sne with reasonable confidence, but stretching around the peakproduces better results. the existence of such a relation provides a newconstraint on grb explosion models. grb-sne can be used as standardizablecandles to measure cosmological distances and constrain cosmologicalparameters.

1407.4447	rapid formation of large dust grains in the luminous supernova sn 2010jl	the origin of dust in galaxies is still a mystery. the majority of therefractory elements are produced in supernova explosions but it is unclear howand where dust grains condense and grow, and how they avoid destruction in theharsh environments of star-forming galaxies. the recent detection of 0.1-0.5solar masses of dust in nearby supernova remnants suggests in situ dustformation, while other observations reveal very little dust in supernovae thefirst few years after explosion. observations of the bright sn 2010jl have beeninterpreted as pre-existing dust, dust formation or no dust at all. here wereport the rapid (40-240 days) formation of dust in its dense circumstellarmedium. the wavelength dependent extinction of this dust reveals the presenceof very large (&gt; 1 micron) grains, which are resistant to destructiveprocesses. at later times (500-900 days), the near-ir thermal emission shows anaccelerated growth in dust mass, marking the transition of the supernova from acircumstellar- to an ejecta-dominated source of dust. this provides the linkbetween the early and late dust mass evolution in supernovae with densecircumstellar media.

1411.7032	a dust-parallax distance of 19 megaparsecs to the supermassive black  hole in ngc 4151	the active galaxy ngc 4151 has a crucial role as one of only two activegalactic nuclei for which black hole mass measurements based on emission linereverberation mapping can be calibrated against other dynamical methods.unfortunately, effective calibration requires an accurate distance to ngc 4151,which is currently not available. recently reported distances range from 4 to29 megaparsecs (mpc). strong peculiar motions make a redshift-based distancevery uncertain, and the geometry of the galaxy and its nucleus prohibitaccurate measurements using other techniques. here we report a dust-parallaxdistance to ngc 4151 of $d_a = 19.0^{+2.4}_{-2.6}$ mpc. the measurement isbased on an adaptation of a geometric method proposed previously using theemission line regions of active galaxies. since this region is too small forcurrent imaging capabilities, we use instead the ratio of thephysical-to-angular sizes of the more extended hot dust emission as determinedfrom time-delays and infrared interferometry. this new distance leads to anapproximately 1.4-fold increase in the dynamical black hole mass, implying acorresponding correction to emission line reverberation masses of black holesif they are calibrated against the two objects with additional dynamicalmasses.

0807.0473	ngc 2770 - a supernova ib factory?	ngc 2770 has been the host of three supernovae of type ib during the last 10years, sn 1999eh, sn 2007uy and sn 2008d. sn 2008d attracted special attentiondue to the serendipitous discovery of an associated x-ray transient. in thispaper, we study the properties of ngc 2770 and specifically the three sn sitesto investigate whether this galaxy is in any way peculiar to cause a highfrequency of sne ib. we model the global sed of the galaxy from broadband dataand derive a star-formation and sn rate comparable to the values of the milkyway. we further study the galaxy using longslit spectroscopy covering the majoraxis and the three sn sites. from the spectroscopic study we find subsolarmetallicities for the sn sites, a high extinction and a moderate star-formationrate. in a high resolution spectrum, we also detect diffuse interstellar bandsin the line-of-sight towards sn 2008. a comparison of ngc 2770 to the globalproperties of a galaxy sample with high sn occurance (at least 3 sn in the last100 years) suggests that ngc 2770 is not particularly destined to produce suchan enhancement of observed sne observed. its properties are also very differentfrom gamma-ray burst host galaxies. statistical considerations on sn ibdetection rates give a probability of ~1.5% to find a galaxy with three ib snedetected in 10 years. the high number of rare ib sne in this galaxy istherefore likely to be a coincidence rather than special properties of thegalaxy itself. ngc 2770 has a small irregular companion, ngc 2770b, which ishighly starforming, has a very low mass and one of the lowest metallicitiesdetected in the nearby universe as derived from longslit spectroscopy. in themost metal poor part, we even detect wolf-rayet features, against the currentmodels of wr stars which require high metallicities.

astro-ph;0505496	the redshift distribution of gamma-ray bursts revisited	in this letter, we calculate the redshift distribution of gamma-ray burstsassuming that they trace (i) the globally averaged star formation rate or (ii)the average metallicity in the universe. while at redshifts 5 and below, boththe star formation rate and metallicity are observationally determined modulosome uncertainties, at higher redshifts there are few constraints. weextrapolate the star formation rate and metallicity to higher redshifts andexplore models that are broadly consistent with bounds on the optical depthfrom wmap results. in addition, we also include parametric descriptions of theluminosity function, and the typical spectrum for grbs. with these essentialingredients included in the modeling, we find that a substantial fraction 75%of grbs are expected to originate at redshifts below 4, in variance with someprevious estimates. conversely, if we assume as expected for the collapsarmodel that gamma-ray bursts favour a low metallicity environment and therefore,relate the grb rate to a simple model of the average metallicity as a functionof redshift, we find that a higher fraction of bursts, about 40% originate fromredshifts greater than 4. we conclude with the implications of swift grbdetections.

astro-ph;0510096	the optical afterglow of the short gamma-ray burst grb 050709	it has long been known that there are two classes of gamma-ray bursts (grbs),mainly distinguished by their durations. the breakthrough in our understandingof long-duration grbs (those lasting more than ~2 s), which ultimately linkedthem with energetic type ic supernovae, came from the discovery of theirlong-lived x-ray and optical afterglows, when precise and rapid localizationsof the sources could finally be obtained. x-ray localizations have recentlybecome available for short (duration &lt;2 s) grbs, which have evaded opticaldetection for more than 30 years. here we report the first discovery oftransient optical emission (r-band magnitude ~23) associated with a shortburst; grb 050709. the optical afterglow was localized with subarcsecondaccuracy, and lies in the outskirts of a blue dwarf galaxy. the optical andx-ray afterglow properties 34 h after the grb are reminiscent of the afterglowsof long grbs, which are attributable to synchrotron emission fromultrarelativistic ejecta. we did not, however, detect a supernova, as found inmost nearby long grb afterglows, which suggests a different origin for theshort grbs.

astro-ph;0606649	extinction curves of lensing galaxies out to z=1	we present a survey of the extinction properties of ten lensing galaxies, inthe redshift range z = 0.04 - 1.01, using multiply lensed quasars imaged withthe eso vlt in the optical and near infrared. the multiple images act as'standard light sources' shining through different parts of the lensing galaxy,allowing for extinction studies by comparison of pairs of images. we explorethe effects of systematics in the extinction curve analysis, includingextinction along both lines of sight and microlensing, using theoreticalanalysis and simulations. in the sample, we see variation in both the amountand type of extinction. of the ten systems, seven are consistent withextinction along at least one line of sight. the mean differential extinctionfor the most extinguished image pair for each lens is a(v) = 0.56 +- 0.04,using galactic extinction law parametrization. the corresponding mean r_v = 2.8+- 0.4 is consistent with that of the milky way at r_v = 3.1, where r_v =a(v)/e(b-v). we do not see any strong evidence for evolution of extinctionproperties with redshift. of the ten systems, b1152+199 shows the strongestextinction signal of a(v) = 2.43 +- 0.09 and is consistent with a galacticextinction law with r_v = 2.1 +- 0.1. given the similar redshift distributionof sn ia hosts and lensing galaxies, a large space based study of multiplyimaged quasars would be a useful complement to future dark energy sn iasurveys, providing independent constraints on the statistical extinctionproperties of galaxies up to z~1.

astro-ph;0608166	infrared and optical observations of grb 030115 and its extremely red  host galaxy: implications for dark bursts	we present near-infrared (nir) and optical observations of the afterglow ofgrb 030115. discovered in an infrared search at kitt peak 5 hours after theburst trigger, this afterglow is amongst the faintest observed in the r-band atan early epoch, and exhibits very red colors, with $r-k\approx 6$. themagnitude of the optical afterglow of grb 030115 is fainter than many upperlimits for other bursts, suggesting that without early nir observations itwould have been classified as a ``dark'' burst. both the color and opticalmagnitude of the afterglow are likely due to dust extinction and indicate thatat least some optical afterglows are very faint due to dust along the line ofsight. multicolor {\it hubble space telescope} observations were also taken ofthe host galaxy and the surrounding field. photometric redshifts imply that thehost, and a substantial number of faint galaxies in the field are at $z \sim2.5$. the overdensity of galaxies is sufficiently great that grb 030115 mayhave occurred in a rich high-redshift cluster. the host galaxy shows extremelyred colors (r-k=5) and is the first grb host to be classified as an extremelyred object (ero). some of the galaxies surrounding the host also show very redcolors, while the majority of the cluster are much bluer, indicating ongoingunobscured star formation. as it is thought that much of high redshift starformation occurs in highly obscured environments it may be that grb 030115represent a transition object, between the relatively unobscured afterglowsseen to date and a population which are very heavily extinguished, even in thenir.

astro-ph;0608313	no supernovae associated with two long-duration gamma ray bursts	it is now accepted that long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are producedduring the collapse of a massive star. the standard "collapsar" model predictsthat a broad-lined and luminous type ic core-collapse supernova (sn)accompanies every long-duration grb. this association has been confirmed inobservations of several nearby grbs. here we present observations of two nearbylong-duration grbs that challenge this simple view. in the grbs 060505 and060614 we demonstrate that no sn emission accompanied these long-durationbursts, down to limits hundreds of times fainter than the archetypal sn 1998bwthat accompanied grb 980425, and fainter than any type ic sn ever observed.multi-band observations of the early afterglows, as well as spectroscopy of thehost galaxies, exclude the possibility of significant dust obscuration and showthat the bursts originated in star-forming regions. the absence of a sn to suchdeep limits is qualitatively different from all previous nearby long grbs andsuggests a new phenomenological type of massive stellar death. from thesupplementary material: now we have observed sn-less grbs in star-formingregions, suggesting that a non-detection of a sn does not preclude a massiveprogenitor. the position of the grb, i.e. in a star-forming region or in anolder component, may be the only way to discriminate between merging compactobjects and massive stars as progenitors. in fact, several host galaxies forshort grbs have been found to be as actively star-forming as some host galaxiesof long-duration grbs. the grb labels "long" and "short" have become synonymouswith "massive stars" and "other progenitors". these distinctions may need to berelaxed.

astro-ph;0703407	spatially resolved properties of the grb 060505 host: implications for  the nature of the progenitor	grb 060505 was the first well-observed nearby possible long-duration grb thathad no associated supernova. here we present spatially resolved spectra of thehost galaxy of grb 060505, an sbc spiral, at redshift z=0.0889. the grboccurred inside a star-forming region in the northern spiral arm at 6.5 kpcfrom the center. from the position of the emission lines, we determine amaximum rotational velocity for the galaxy of v~212km/s corresponding to a massof 1.14x10^11 m_solar within 11 kpc from the center. by fitting single-agespectral synthesis models to the stellar continuum, we derive a very young agefor the grb site, confirmed by photometric and halpha line measurements, ofaround 6 myr which corresponds to the lifetime of a 32 m_solar star. themetallicity derived from several emission line measurements is lowest at thegrb site with 1/5 z_solar but roughly solar in the rest of the galaxy. usingthe 2df galaxy redshift survey we can locate the host galaxy in its large scale(mpc) environment. the galaxy lies in the foreground of a filamentaryoverdensity extending south west from the galaxy cluster abell 3837 atz=0.0896. the properties of the grb site are similar to those found for otherlong-duration grb host galaxies with high specific star formation rate and lowmetallicity, which is an indication that grb 060505 originated from a youngmassive star that died without making a supernova.

astro-ph;9412074	high-resolution imaging of the gravitational lens candidate 1208+1011  with the nordic optical telescope	the large-redshift (z=3.8) quasar 1208+1011 has recently been discovered tobe a gravitational lens candidate with a separation of 0.47" between the twoimaged components (a and b). not (nordic optical telescope) and hst (hubblespace telescope) studies from 1992 probing primarily the continuum light showthat the amplification of a relative to b is almost achromatic with thecanonical value a:b=4+/-0.1. in this paper we present high-resolution opticalimages (fwhm=0.4"-0.5") from 1993 of the quasar. from our narrow-band ccdframes centred on the redshifted ly-alpha/nv line at 5900 a we find thata:b=3.85+/-0.2. our broad-band i images uncontaminated by line-emission arefound to be affected by psf variation over a range of 20\arcsec. however, byiteratively determining the psf from the images themselves we show that thedata can be accounted for by two point sources with a:b=3.35+/-0.2. theseresults imply that the continuum intensity ratio has decreased during 1992-1993and that the amplification of the emission-line regions relative to thecontinuum emitting regions is different in the two components (under thegravitational lens hypothesis). the most conservative interpretation of theseresults is that 1208+1011 is a gravitationally lensed quasar in which componentb is being microlensed, but the possibility that 1208+1011 is a binary quasaris not excluded by the present data.

astro-ph;9412076	small deviations from the r^1/4 law, the fundamental plane, and phase  densities of elliptical galaxies	the light profiles of elliptical (e) galaxies are known to display smallsystematic deviations (0.1-0.2 mag.) from the r^1/4 law. in this paper we showthat the senses and amplitudes of these departures can be naturally accountedfor by a simple distribution function constructed on the basis of statisticalmechanics of violent relaxation. as a consequence, detailed light-profiles canbe used to infer about the central potentials of e galaxies (the only freeshape parameter of our model). furthermore, the small deviations have recentlybeen shown to correlate with luminosity, l. this observation entails a slightbreaking of the generally assumed structural homology between e galaxies. usingour model we parametrize this broken homology by establishing a correlationbetween a suitably normalized central potential and luminosity. thenon-homology means that a basic assumption in the interpretation of thefundamental plane (fp) breaks down, and with it the conclusions derived fromit. instead, by assuming that m/l is independent of luminosity, we derive arelation akin to the fp directly from our correlation. this implies that the fpmay have a simple stellar dynamical origin. we can reproduce the observedcarlberg-kormendy relation for the central phase-space densities (f_c) of egalaxies of identical structure, f_c = l^-2.35, but non-homology changes it toa much weaker dependence (f_c = l^-1.5 for constant m/l) which would imply thatthe central phase-space densities of ellipticals are comparable to those ofspiral galaxies. thus dissipationless merging is consistent with the fp,although hst observations, notably the presence of nuclear embedded disks,indicate that the assumptions behind our model break down for the nuclei offaint e galaxies in which dissipative processes seem to be important.

astro-ph;9609049	distribution functions for clusters of galaxies from n-body simulations	we present the results of an attempt to adapt the distribution functionformalism to characterize large-scale structures like clusters of galaxies thatform in a cosmological n-body simulation. while galaxy clusters are systemsthat are not strictly in equilibrium, we show that their evolution cannevertheless be studied using a physically motivated extension of the languageof equilibrium stellar dynamics. restricting our analysis to the virializedregion, a prescription to limit the accessible phase-space is presented, whichpermits the construction of both the isotropic and the anisotropic distributionfunctions $f(e)$ and $f(e,l)$. the method is applied to models extracted from acatalogue of simulated clusters. clusters evolved in open and flat backgroundcosmologies are followed during the course of their evolution, and are found totransit through a sequence of what we define as `quasi-equilibrium' states. aninteresting feature is that the computed $f(e)$ is well fit by an exponentialform. we conclude that the dynamical evolution of a cluster, undergoingrelaxation punctuated by interactions and violent mergers with consequentenergy-exchange, can be studied both in a qualitative and quantitative fashionby following the time evolution of $f(e)$.

astro-ph;9701025	calibration of the fundamental plane zero-point in the leo-i group and  an estimate of the hubble constant	we derive new effective radii and total magnitudes for 5 e and s0 galaxies inthe leo-i group from wide-field ccd images. these are used in conjunction withrecent literature velocity data to construct the fundamental plane (fp) of theleo-i group. the rms scatter that we find is only 6 % in distance. the zeropoint of this relation provides a calibration of the fp as a distance indicatorand directly determines the angular diameter distance ratio between the leo-igroup and more distant clusters. in the language of jerjen and tammann (1993)we determine a cosmic velocity of the leo-i group of 757+-68 km/s relative tothe coma cluster, or 796+-57 km/s relative to a frame of 9 clusters. combiningthis velocity with the cepheid distance to m96, a member of leo-i, we find thehubble constant to be h_0=67+-8 km/s/mpc or h_0=70+-7 km/s/mpc for each case.the distance we obtain for the coma cluster itself (108+-12 mpc) is in goodagreement with a number of other recent estimates.

astro-ph;9702045	the fundamental plane at z=0.18	we present preliminary results regarding the fundamental plane (fp) forgalaxies in the two rich clusters abell 665 and abell 2218. both clusters havea redshift of 0.18. we have compared the fp for a665 and a2218, and for thecluster cl0024+16 at z=0.39, with the fp for the coma cluster. the scatteraround the fp is similar for all four clusters. there may be indications thatthe slope of the fp is more shallow for the intermediate redshift clusters thanfor the coma cluster. more complete samples of galaxies in intermediateredshift clusters are needed to map in detail the possible change of the slopeas function of redshift. the mass-to-light (m/l) ratio as measured by the fpchanges with redshift. at z=0.18 the m/l ratio (in gunn r) is 16+-9% smallerthan for the coma cluster. together with earlier results reported for cl0024+16this implies that the m/l ratio changes with redshift as delta log m/l_r ~ -0.4delta z. the results presented here are in agreement with passive evolution ofa stellar population, which formed at a redshift larger than one. however, thepossible presence of more recent bursts of star formation complicates theinterpretation of the data.

astro-ph;9802293	the mass-temperature relation for clusters of galaxies	a tight mass-temperature relation, m(r)/r ~ t_x, is expected in mostcosmological models if clusters of galaxies are homologous and the intraclustergas is in global equilibrium with the dark matter. we here calibrate thisrelation using 8 clusters with well-defined global temperatures measured withasca and masses inferred from weak and strong gravitational lensing. thesurface lensing masses are deprojected in accordance with n-body simulationsand analytic results. the data are well-fit by the mass-temperature relationand are consistent with the empirical normalisation found by evrard et al.(1996) using gasdynamic simulations. thus, there is no discrepancy betweenlensing and x-ray derived masses using this approach. the dispersion around therelation is 27 per cent, entirely dominated by observational errors. the nextgeneration of x-ray telescopes combined with wide-field hst imaging couldprovide a sensitive test of the normalisation and intrinsic scatter of therelation resulting in a powerful and expedient way of measuring masses ofclusters of galaxies. in addition, as m(r)/r (as derived from lensing) isdependent on the cosmological model at high redshift, the relation represents anew tool for determination of cosmological parameters, notably the cosmologicalconstant lambda.

astro-ph;9905155	the evolution of cluster e and s0 galaxies measured from the fundamental  plane	new photometry and spectroscopy for the two rich clusters abell 665 and abell2218 are presented and used to establish the fundamental plane (fp) for theclusters. the fp for these two clusters adds important knowledge about theproperties of e and s0 galaxies in the relatively unexplored redshift interval0.05 to 0.3. we have compared the fp for a665 and a2218 with the fp for thethree clusters cl0024+16, cl1358+62 and ms2053-04 with redshifts between 0.33and 0.58, and with the fp for the coma cluster. the scatter around the fp issimilar for all six clusters. we find that the slope of the fp for theintermediate redshift clusters is slightly different from the one found for thecoma cluster and other nearby clusters. this may either be caused by selectioneffects for the intermediate redshift clusters or by differences in theevolution of low luminosity galaxies and high luminosity galaxies. themass-to-light (m/l) ratios, as measured from the fp, change with redshift.using the data for all five intermediate redshift clusters, we find that them/l ratios for photometry calibrated to gunn r change with redshift as deltalog m/l_r = (-0.26+-0.06) delta z for q0=0.5. this is consistent with thepreviously published analysis for cl0024+16, cl1358+62 and ms2053-04. forq0=0.5 the results are consistent with passive evolution of a stellarpopulation which formed at a redshift larger than five. for q0=0.15 theformation redshift must be larger than 1.7. our new data for a665 and a2218confirm the gradual and slow evolution of the bright e and s0 galaxies.however, possible star formation in e and s0 galaxies during the last 3-4 gyrof the history of the universe, as well as the selection effects complicate theinterpretation of the data.

0812.1217	late time observations of grb080319b: jet break, host galaxy and  accompanying supernova	the swift discovered grb080319b was by far the most distant source everobserved at naked eye brightness, reaching a peak apparent magnitude of 5.3 ata redshift of z=0.937. we present our late-time optical (hst, gemini &amp; vlt) andx-ray (chandra) observations, which confirm that an achromatic break occurredin the power-law afterglow light curve at ~11 days post-burst. this most likelyindicates that the gamma-ray burst (grb) outflow was collimated, which for auniform jet would imply a total energy in the jet e_{jet} \gsim 10^{52} erg.our observations also show a late-time excess of red light, which is wellexplained if the grb was accompanied by a supernova (sn), similar to those seenin some other long-duration grbs. the latest observations are dominated bylight from the host and show that the grb took place in a faint dwarf galaxy(r(ab)\approx27.0, rest-frame m_b\approx-17.2). this galaxy is small even bythe standards of other grb hosts, which is suggestive of a low metallicityenvironment. intriguingly, the properties of this extreme event - a small hostand bright supernova - are entirely typical of the very low-luminosity burstssuch as grb980425 and grb060218.
