0901.1660	on the number of young stellar discs in the galactic centre	observations of the galactic centre show evidence of disc-like structures ofvery young stars orbiting the central super-massive black hole within adistance of a few 0.1 pc. while it is widely accepted that about half of thestars form a relatively flat disc rotating clockwise on the sky, there is asubstantial ongoing debate on whether there is a second, counter-clockwise discof stars.  by means of n-body simulations using our bhint code, we show that two highlyinclined stellar discs with the observed properties cannot be recognised as twoflat circular discs after 5 myr of mutual interaction. instead, ourcalculations predict a significant warping of the two discs, which we show tobe apparent among the structures observed in the galactic centre. while thehigh eccentricities of the observed counter-clockwise orbits suggest aneccentric origin of this system, we show the eccentricity distribution in theinner part of the more massive clockwise disc to be perfectly consistent withan initially circular disc in which stellar eccentricities increase due to bothnon-resonant and resonant relaxation.  we conclude that the relevant question to ask is therefore not whether thereare two discs of young stars, but whether there were two such discs to beginwith.

0902.1846	testing fundamental physics with distant star clusters: theoretical  models for pressure-supported stellar systems	we investigate the mean velocity dispersion and the velocity dispersionprofile of stellar systems in mond, using the n-body code n-mody, which is aparticle-mesh based code with a numerical mond potential solver developed byciotti, londrillo and nipoti (2006). we have calculated mean velocitydispersions for stellar systems following plummer density distributions withmasses in the range of $10^4 m_\odot$ to $10^9 m_\odot$ and which are eitherisolated or immersed in an external field. our integrations reproduce previousanalytic estimates for stellar velocities in systems in the deep mond regime($a_i, a_e \ll a_0$), where the motion of stars is either dominated by internalaccelerations ($a_i \gg a_e$) or constant external accelerations ($a_e \gga_i$). in addition, we derive for the first time analytic formulae for theline-of-sight velocity dispersion in the intermediate regime ($a_i \sim a_e\sim a_0$). this allows for a much improved comparison of mond with observedvelocity dispersions of stellar systems. we finally derive the velocitydispersion of the globular cluster pal 14 as one of the outer milky way haloglobular clusters that have recently been proposed as a differentiator betweennewtonian and mondian dynamics.

0906.0574	influence of a stellar cusp on the dynamics of young stellar discs and  the origin of the s-stars in the galactic centre	observations of the galactic centre show evidence of one or two disc-likestructures of very young stars orbiting the central super-massive black holewithin a distance of a few 0.1 pc. a number of analyses have been carried outto investigate the dynamical behaviour and consequences of these discs,including disc thickness and eccentricity growth as well as mutual interactionand warping. however, most of these studies have neglected the influence of thestellar cusp surrounding the black hole, which is believed to be 1-2 orders ofmagnitude more massive than the disc(s).  by means of n-body integrations using our bhint code, we study the impact ofstellar cusps of different compositions. we find that although the presence ofa cusp does have an important effect on the evolution of an otherwise isolatedflat disc, its influence on the evolution of disc thickness and warping israther mild in a two-disc configuration. however, we show that the creation ofhighly eccentric orbits strongly depends on the graininess of the cusp (i.e.the mean and maximum stellar masses): while chang (2009) recently found thatfull cycles of kozai resonance are prevented by the presence of an analyticcusp, we show that relaxation processes play an important role in such highlydense regions and support short-term resonances. we thus find that young discstars on initially circular orbits can achieve high eccentricities by resonanteffects also in the presence of a cusp of stellar remnants, yielding amechanism to create s-stars and hyper-velocity stars.  furthermore, we discuss the underlying initial mass function (imf) of theyoung stellar discs and find no definite evidence for a non-canonical imf.

0909.5696	evidence for two populations of galactic globular clusters from the  ratio of their half-mass to jacobi radii	we investigate the ratio between the half-mass radii r_h of galactic globularclusters and their jacobi radii r_j given by the potential of the milky way andshow that clusters with galactocentric distances r_{gc}&gt;8 kpc fall into twodistinct groups: one group of compact, tidally-underfilling clusters withr_h/r_j&lt;0.05 and another group of tidally filling clusters which have 0.1 &lt;r_h/r_j&lt;0.3. we find no correlation between the membership of a particularcluster to one of these groups and its membership in the old or younger halopopulation. based on the relaxation times and orbits of the clusters, we arguethat compact clusters and most clusters in the inner milky way were borncompact with half-mass radii r_h &lt; 1 pc. some of the tidally-filling clustersmight have formed compact as well, but the majority likely formed with largehalf-mass radii. galactic globular clusters therefore show a similar dichotomyas was recently found for globular clusters in dwarf galaxies and for youngstar clusters in the milky way. it seems likely that some of thetidally-filling clusters are evolving along the main sequence line of clustersrecently discovered by kuepper et al.

0707.1944	a comprehensive set of simulations studying the influence of gas  expulsion on star cluster evolution	we have carried out a large set of n-body simulations studying the effect ofresidual-gas expulsion on the survival rate and final properties of starclusters.  we have varied the star formation efficiency, gas expulsion timescale andstrength of the external tidal field, obtaining a three-dimensional grid ofmodels which can be used to predict the evolution of individual star clustersor whole star cluster systems by interpolating between our runs. the completedata of these simulations is made available on the internet.  our simulations show that cluster sizes, bound mass fraction and velocityprofile are strongly influenced by the details of the gas expulsion. althoughstar clusters can survive star formation efficiencies as low as 10% if thetidal field is weak and the gas is removed only slowly, our simulationsindicate that most star clusters are destroyed or suffer dramatic loss of starsduring the gas removal phase. surviving clusters have typically expanded by afactor 3 or 4 due to gas removal, implying that star clusters formed moreconcentrated than as we see them today. maximum expansion factors seen in ourruns are around 10. if gas is removed on timescales smaller than the initialcrossing time, star clusters acquire strongly radially anisotropic velocitydispersions outside their half-mass radii. observed velocity profiles of starclusters can therefore be used as a constraint on the physics of clusterformation.

0910.3954	stellar-mass black holes in star clusters: implications for  gravitational wave radiation	we study the dynamics of stellar-mass black holes (bh) in star clusters withparticular attention to the formation of bh-bh binaries, which are interestingas sources of gravitational waves (gw). we examine the properties of thesebh-bh binaries through direct n-body simulations of star clusters using thegpu-enabled nbody6 code. we perform simulations of n &lt;= 10^5 plummer clustersof low-mass stars with an initial population of bhs. additionally, we doseveral calculations of star clusters confined within a reflective boundarymimicking only the core of a massive cluster. we find that stellar-mass bhswith masses ~ 10 solar mass segregate rapidly into the cluster core and form asub-cluster of bhs within typically 0.2 - 0.5 pc radius, which is dense enoughto form bh-bh binaries through 3-body encounters. while most bh binaries areejected from the cluster by recoils received during super-elastic encounterswith the single bhs, few of them harden sufficiently so that they can merge viagw emission within the cluster. we find that for clusters with $n \ga 5\times10^4$, typically 1 - 2 bh-bh mergers occur within them during the first ~ 4 gyrof evolution. also for each of these clusters, there are a few escaping bhbinaries that can merge within a hubble time, most of the merger times beingwithin a few gyr. these results indicate that intermediate-age massive clustersconstitute the most important class of candidates for producing dynamical bh-bhmergers. old globular clusters cannot contribute significantly to thepresent-day bh-bh merger rate since most of the mergers from them would haveoccurred earlier. in contrast, young massive clusters are too young to producesignificant number of bh-bh mergers. our results imply significant bh-bh mergerdetection rates for the proposed "advanced ligo" gw detector.

0910.4960	constraining the initial mass function of stars in the galactic centre	(abridged) here we discuss the question whether the extreme circumstances inthe centre of the milky way may be the reason for a significant variation ofthe imf. by means of stellar evolution models using different codes we showthat the observed luminosity in the central parsec is too high to be explainedby a long-standing top-heavy imf, considering the limited amount of massinferred from stellar kinematics in this region. in contrast, continuous starformation over the galaxy's lifetime following a canonical imf results in amass-to-light ratio and a total mass of stellar black holes (sbhs) consistentwith the observations. furthermore, these sbhs migrate towards the centre dueto dynamical friction, turning the cusp of visible stars into a core asobserved in the galactic centre. for the first time here we explain theluminosity and dynamical mass of the central cluster and both the presence andextent of the observed core, since the number of sbhs expected from a canonicalimf is just enough to make up for the missing luminous mass. we conclude thatthe galactic centre is consistent with the canonical imf and do not suggest asystematic variation as a result of the region's properties such as highdensity, metallicity, strong tidal field etc.

1007.1078	mass loss rates and the mass evolution of star clusters	we describe the interplay between stellar evolution and dynamical mass lossof evolving star clusters, based on the principles of stellar evolution andcluster dynamics and on a grid of n-body simulations of cluster models. thecluster models have different initial masses, different orbits, includingelliptical ones, and different initial density profiles. we use two sets ofcluster models: initially roche-lobe filling and roche-lobe underfilling. weidentify four distinct mass loss effects: (1) mass loss by stellar evolution,(2) loss of stars induced by stellar evolution and (3) relaxation-driven massloss before and (4) after core collapse. both the evolution-induced loss ofstars and the relaxation-driven mass loss need time to build up. this isdescribed by a delay-function of a few crossing times for roche-lobe fillingclusters and a few half mass relaxation times for roche-lobe underfillingclusters. the relaxation-driven mass loss can be described by a simple powerlaw dependence of the mass dm/dt =-m^{1-gamma}/t0, (with m in msun) where t0depends on the orbit and environment of the cluster. gamma is 0.65 for clusterswith a king-parameter w0=5 and 0.80 for more concentrated clusters with w0=7.for initially roche-lobe underfilling clusters the dissolution is described bythe same gamma=0.80. the values of the constant t0 are described by simpleformulae that depend on the orbit of the cluster. the mass loss rate increasesby about a factor two at core collapse and the mass dependence of therelaxation-driven mass loss changes to gamma=0.70 after core collapse. we alsopresent a simple recipe for predicting the mass evolution of individual starclusters with various metallicities and in different environments, with anaccuracy of a few percent in most cases. this can be used to predict the massevolution of cluster systems.

1007.2333	on the mass-radius relation of hot stellar systems	most globular clusters have half-mass radii of a few pc with no apparentcorrelation with their masses. this is different from elliptical galaxies, forwhich the faber-jackson relation suggests a strong positive correlation betweenmass and radius. objects that are somewhat in between globular clusters andlow-mass galaxies, such as ultra-compact dwarf galaxies, have a mass-radiusrelation consistent with the extension of the relation for bright ellipticals.here we show that at an age of 10 gyr a break in the mass-radius relation at~10^6 msun is established because objects below this mass, i.e. globularclusters, have undergone expansion driven by stellar evolution and hardbinaries. from numerical simulations we find that the combined energyproduction of these two effects in the core comes into balance with the flux ofenergy that is conducted across the half-mass radius by relaxation. animportant property of this `balanced' evolution is that the cluster half-massradius is independent of its initial value and is a function of the number ofbound stars and the age only. it is therefore not possible to infer the initialmass-radius relation of globular clusters and we can only conclude that thepresent day properties are consistent with the hypothesis that all hot stellarsystems formed with the same mass-radius relation and that globular clustershave moved away from this relation because of a hubble time of stellar anddynamical evolution.

1010.2210	direct n-body simulations of globular clusters: (i) palomar 14	we present the first ever direct $n$-body computations of an old milky wayglobular cluster over its entire life time on a star-by-star basis. usingrecent gpu hardware at bonn university, we have performed a comprehensive setof $n$-body calculations to model the distant outer halo globular clusterpalomar 14 (pal 14). by varying the initial conditions we aim at finding aninitial $n$-body model which reproduces the observational data best in terms ofits basic parameters, i.e. half-light radius, mass and velocity dispersion. wefurthermore focus on reproducing the stellar mass function slope of pal 14which was found to be significantly shallower than in most globular clusters.while some of our models can reproduce pal 14's basic parameters reasonablywell, we find that dynamical mass segregation alone cannot explain the massfunction slope of pal 14 when starting from the canonical kroupa initial massfunction (imf). in order to seek for an explanation for this discrepancy, wecompute additional initial models with varying degrees of primordial masssegregation as well as with a flattened imf. the necessary degree of primordialmass segregation turns out to be very high. this modelling has shown that theinitial conditions of pal 14 after gas expulsion must have been a half-massradius of about 20 pc, a mass of about 50000 m$_{\odot}$, and possibly somemass segregation or an already established non-canonical imf depleted inlow-mass stars. such conditions might be obtained by a violent earlygas-expulsion phase from an embedded cluster born with mass segregation. onlyat large galactocentric radii are clusters likely to survive as bound entitiesthe destructive gas-expulsion process we seem to have uncovered for pal 14. inaddition we compute a model with a 5% primordial binary fraction to test ifsuch a population has an effect on the cluster's evolution.

0709.1328	on the efficiency of field star capture by star clusters	an exciting recent finding regarding scaling relations among globularclusters is the so-called 'blue tilt': clusters of the blue sub-populationfollow a trend of redder colour with increasing luminosity. in this paper weevaluate to which extent field star capture over a hubble time may explain the'blue tilt'. we perform collisional n-body simulations to quantify the amountof field star capture occuring over a hubble time to star clusters with 10^3 to10^6 stars. in the simulations we follow the orbits of field stars passingthrough a star cluster and calculate the energy change that the field starsexperience due to gravitational interaction with cluster stars during onepassage through the cluster. the capture condition is that their total energyafter the passage is smaller than the gravitational potential at the cluster'stidal radius. by folding this with the fly-by rates of field stars with anassumed space density as in the solar neighbourhood and a range of velocitydispersions, we derive estimates on the mass fraction of captured field starsas a function of environment. we find that integrated over a hubble time, theratio between captured field stars and total number of clusters stars is verylow (&lt;~ 10^(-4)), even for the smallest considered field star velocitydispersion sigma=15 km/s. this holds for star clusters in the mass range ofboth open clusters and globular clusters. we furthermore show that tidalfriction has a negligible effect on the energy distribution of field starsafter interaction with the cluster. we conclude that field star capture is nota probable mechanism for creating the colour-magnitude trend of metal-poorglobular clusters.

1108.4425	testing photometric diagnostics for the dynamical state and possible  imbh presence in globular clusters	surface photometry is a necessary tool to establish the dynamical state ofstars clusters. we produce realistic hst-like images from n-body models of starclusters with and without central intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs) inorder to measure their surface brightness profiles. the models contain ~600,000individual stars, black holes of various masses between 0% to 2% of the totalmass, and are evolved for a hubble time. we measure surface brightness and starcount profiles for every constructed image in order to test the effect ofintermediate mass black holes on the central logarithmic slope, the coreradius, and the half-light radius. we use these quantities to test diagnostictools for the presence of central black holes using photometry. we find thatthe the only models that show central shallow cusps with logarithmic slopesbetween -0.1 and -0.4 are those containing central black holes. thus, thecentral logarithmic slope seems to be a good way to choose clusters suspect ofcontaining intermediate-mass black holes. clusters with steep central cusps candefinitely be ruled out to host an imbh. the measured r_c/r_h ratio has similarvalues for clusters that have not undergone core-collapse, and those containinga central black hole. we notice that observed galactic globular clusters have alarger span of values for central slope and r_c/r_h than our modeled clusters,and suggest possible reasons that could account for this and contribute toimprove future models.

0710.2374	star cluster life-times: dependence on mass, radius and environment	the dissolution time (t_dis) of clusters in a tidal field does not scale withthe ``classical'' expression for the relaxation time. first, the scaling withn, and hence cluster mass, is shallower due to the finite escape time of stars.secondly, the cluster half-mass radius is of little importance. this is due toa balance between the relative tidal field strength and internal relaxation,which have an opposite effect on t_dis, but of similar magnitude. when externalperturbations, such as encounters with giant molecular clouds (gmc) areimportant, t_dis for an individual cluster depends strongly on radius. the meandissolution time for a population of clusters, however, scales in the same waywith mass as for the tidal field, due to the weak dependence of radius on mass.the environmental parameters that determine t_dis are the tidal field strengthand the density of molecular gas. we compare the empirically derived t_dis ofclusters in six galaxies to theoretical predictions and argue that encounterswith gmcs are the dominant destruction mechanism. finally, we discuss a numberof pitfalls in the derivations of t_dis from observations, such asincompleteness, with the cluster system of the smc as particular example.

1111.3788	tidal mass loss in star clusters and treatment of escapers in  fokker-planck models	this paper presents a new scheme to treat escaping stars in theorbit-averaged fokker-planck models of globular star clusters in a galactictidal field. the existence of a large number of potential escapers, which haveenergies above the escape energy but are still within the tidal radius, istaken into account in the models. the models allow potential escapers toexperience gravitational scatterings before they leave clusters and thus someof them may lose enough energy to be bound again. it is shown that the massevolution of the fokker-planck models are in good agreement with that of n-bodymodels including the full tidal-force field. the mass-loss time does not simplyscale with the relaxation time due to the existence of potential escapers; itincreases with the number of stars more slowly than the relaxation time, thoughit tends to be proportional to the relaxation time in the limit of a weak tidalfield. the fokker-planck models include two parameters, the coefficient gammain the coulomb logarithm ln(gamma n) and the coefficient nu_e controlling theefficiency of the mass loss. the values of these parameters are determined bycomparing the fokker-planck models with the n-body models. it is found that theparameter set (gamma, nu_e)=(0.11, 7) works well for both single-mass andmulti-mass clusters, but that the parameter set (gamma, nu_e)=(0.02, 40) isanother possible choice for multi-mass clusters.

1204.4074	central kinematics of the globular cluster ngc 2808: upper limit on the  mass of an intermediate-mass black hole	globular clusters are an excellent laboratory for stellar population anddynamical research. recent studies have shown that these stellar systems arenot as simple as previously assumed. with multiple stellar populations as wellas outer rotation and mass segregation they turn out to exhibit highcomplexity. this includes intermediate-mass black holes which are proposed tosit at the centers of some massive globular clusters. today's high angularresolution ground based spectrographs allow velocity-dispersion measurements ata spatial resolution comparable to the radius of influence for plausible imbhmasses, and to detect changes in the inner velocity-dispersion profile.together with high quality photometric data from hst, it is possible toconstrain black-hole masses by their kinematic signatures. we determine thecentral velocity-dispersion profile of the globular cluster ngc 2808 usingvlt/flames spectroscopy. in combination with hst/acs data our goal is to probewhether this massive cluster hosts an intermediate-mass black hole at itscenter and constrain the cluster mass to light ratio as well as its total mass.we derive a velocity-dispersion profile from integral field spectroscopy in thecenter and fabry perot data for larger radii. high resolution hst data are usedto obtain the surface brightness profile. together, these data sets arecompared to dynamical models with varying parameters such as mass to lightratio profiles and black-hole masses. using analytical jeans models incombination with variable m/l profiles from n-body simulations we find that thebest fit model is a no black hole solution. after applying various monte carlosimulations to estimate the uncertainties, we derive an upper limit of the backhole mass of m_bh &lt; 1 x 10^4 m_sun (with 95 % confidence limits) and a globalmass-to-light ratio of m/l_v = (2.1 +- 0.2) m_sun/l_sun.

0711.1326	tracing intermediate-mass black holes in the galactic centre	we have developed a new method for post-newtonian, high-precision integrationof stellar systems containing a super-massive black hole (smbh), splitting theforces on a particle between a dominant central force and perturbations. weused this method to perform fully collisional n-body simulations ofinspiralling intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs) in the centre of the milkyway. we considered stellar cusps of different power-law indices and analysedthe effects of imbhs of different masses, all starting from circular orbits atan initial distance of 0.1 pc.  our simulations show how imbhs deplete the central cusp of stars, leavingbehind a flatter cusp with slope consistent with what has recently beenobserved. if an additional imbh spirals into such a flat cusp, it can take 50myr or longer to merge with the central smbh, thus allowing for directobservation in the near future. the final merger of the two black holesinvolves gravitational wave radiation which may be observable with plannedgravitational wave detectors.  furthermore, our simulations reveal detailed properties of the hypervelocitystars (hvss) created, and how generations of hvss can be used to trace imbhs inthe galactic centre. we find that significant rotation of hvss (which would beevidence for an imbh) can only be expected among very fast stars (v &gt; 1000km/s). also, the probability of creating a hypervelocity binary star is foundto be very small.

1205.4022	high-velocity stars in the cores of globular clusters: the illustrative  case of ngc 2808	we report the detection of five high-velocity stars in the core of theglobular cluster ngc 2808. the stars lie on the the red giant branch and showtotal velocities between 40 and 45 km/s. for a core velocity dispersion sigma_c= 13.4 km/s, this corresponds to up to 3.4 sigma_c. these velocities are closeto the estimated escape velocity (~ 50 km/s) and suggest an ejection from thecore. two of these stars have been confirmed in our recent integral fieldspectroscopy data and we will discuss them in more detail here. these two redgiants are located at a projected distance of ~ 0.3 pc from the center.according to their positions on the color magnitude diagram, both stars arecluster members. we investigate several possible origins for the highvelocities of the stars and conceivable ejection mechanisms. since thevelocities are close to the escape velocity, it is not obvious whether thestars are bound or unbound to the cluster. we therefore consider both cases inour analysis. we perform numerical simulations of three-body dynamicalencounters between binaries and single stars and compare the resulting velocitydistributions of escapers with the velocities of our stars. we compare thepredictions for a single dynamical encounter with a compact object with thoseof a sequence of two-body encounters due to relaxation. if the stars areunbound, the encounter must have taken place recently, when the stars werealready in the giant phase. after including binary fractions and black-holeretention fractions, projection effects, and detection probabilities frommonte-carlo simulations, we estimate the expected numbers of detections for allthe different scenarios. based on these numbers, we conclude that the mostlikely scenario is that the stars are bound and were accelerated by a singleencounter between a binary of main-sequence stars and a ~ 10 m_sun black hole.

1207.5576	the star cluster formation history of the lmc	the large magellanic cloud is one of the nearest galaxies to us and is one ofonly few galaxies where the star formation history can be determined fromstudying resolved stellar populations. we have compiled a new catalogue ofages, luminosities and masses of lmc star clusters and used it to determine theage distribution and dissolution rate of lmc star clusters. we find that thefrequency of massive clusters with masses m&gt;5000 msun is almost constantbetween 10 and 200 myr, showing that the influence of residual gas expulsion islimited to the first 10 myr of cluster evolution or clusters less massive than5000 msun. comparing the cluster frequency in that interval with the absolutestar formation rate, we find that about 15% of all stars in the lmc were formedin long-lived star clusters that survive for more than 10 myr. we also findthat the mass function of lmc clusters younger than 1 gyr can be fitted by apower-law mass function with slope \alpha=-2.3, while older clusters follow asignificantly shallower slope and interpret this is a sign of the ongoingdissolution of low-mass clusters. our data shows that for ages older than 200myr, about 90% of all clusters are lost per dex of lifetime. the impliedcluster dissolution rate is significantly faster than that based on analyticestimates and n-body simulations. our cluster age data finally shows evidencefor a burst in cluster formation about 1 gyr ago, but little evidence forbursts at other ages.

1209.0766	the mass function and dynamical mass of young star clusters: why their  initial crossing-time matters crucially	we highlight the impact of cluster-mass-dependent evolutionary rates upon theevolution of the cluster mass function during violent relaxation, that is,while clusters dynamically respond to the expulsion of their residualstar-forming gas. mass-dependent evolutionary rates arise when the mean volumedensity of cluster-forming regions is mass-dependent. in that case, even if theinitial conditions are such that the cluster mass function at the end ofviolent relaxation has the same shape as the embedded-cluster mass function(i.e. infant weight-loss is mass-independent), the shape of the cluster massfunction does change transiently {\it during} violent relaxation. in contrast,for cluster-forming regions of constant mean volume density, the cluster massfunction shape is preserved all through violent relaxation since all clustersthen evolve at the same mass-independent rate.  on the scale of individual clusters, we model the evolution of the ratiobetween the dynamical mass and luminous mass of a cluster after gas expulsion.specifically, we map the radial dependence of the time-scale for a star clusterto return to equilibrium. we stress that fields-of-view a few pc in size only,typical of compact clusters with rapid evolutionary rates, are likely to revealcluster regions which have returned to equilibrium even if the clusterexperienced a major gas expulsion episode a few myr earlier. we provide modelswith the aperture and time expressed in units of the initial half-mass radiusand initial crossing-time, respectively, so that our results can be applied toclusters with initial densities, sizes, and apertures different from ours.

1209.2114	catch me if you can: is there a runaway-mass black hole in the orion  nebula cluster?	we investigate the dynamical evolution of the orion nebula cluster (onc) bymeans of direct n-body integrations. a large fraction of residual gas wasprobably expelled when the onc formed, so we assume that the onc was much morecompact when it formed compared to its current size, in agreement with theembedded cluster radius-mass relation from marks &amp; kroupa (2012). hence, weassume that few-body relaxation played an important role during the initialphase of evolution of the onc. in particular, three body interactions among obstars likely led to their ejection from the cluster and, at the same time, tothe formation of a massive object via runaway physical stellar collisions. theresulting depletion of the high mass end of the stellar mass function in thecluster is one of the important points where our models fit the observationaldata. we speculate that the runaway-mass star may have collapsed directly intoa massive black hole (mbh &gt; 100msun). such a dark object could explain thelarge velocity dispersion of the four trapezium stars observed in the onc core.we further show that the putative massive black hole is likely to be a memberof a binary system with appr. 70 per cent probability. in such a case, it couldbe detected either due to short periods of enhanced accretion of stellar windsfrom the secondary star during pericentre passages, or through a measurement ofthe motion of the secondary whose velocity would exceed 10 km/s along the wholeorbit.

1304.7156	the m_bh - sigma relation for intermediate-mass black holes in globular  clusters	for galaxies hosting supermassive black holes (smbhs), it has been observedthat the mass of the central black hole (m_bh) tightly correlates with theeffective or central velocity dispersion (sigma) of the host galaxy. the originof this m_bh - sigma scaling relation is assumed to lie in the merging historyof the galaxies but many open questions about its origin and the behavior indifferent mass ranges still need to be addressed. the goal of this work is tostudy the black-hole scaling relations for low black-hole masses, where theregime of intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs) in globular clusters (gcs) isentered. we collect all existing reports of dynamical black-hole measurementsin globular clusters, providing black-hole masses or upper limits for 14candidates. we plot the black-hole masses versus different cluster parametersincluding total mass, velocity dispersion, concentration and half-mass radius.we search for trends and test the correlations in order to quantify theirsignificance using a set of different statistical approaches. for correlationsshowing a large significance we perform a linear fit, accounting foruncertainties and upper limits. we find a clear correlation between the mass ofthe imbh and the velocity dispersion of the globular cluster. as expected, thetotal mass of the globular cluster then also correlates with the mass of theimbh. while the slope of the m_bh - sigma correlation differs strongly from theone observed for smbhs, the other scaling relations m_bh - m_tot, and m_bh - lare similar to the correlations in galaxies. significant correlations ofblack-hole mass with other cluster properties were not found in the presentsample.

1305.2652	the evolution of the global stellar mass function of star clusters: an  analytic description	the evolution of the global stellar mass function (mf) of star clusters isstudied based on a large set of n-body simulations of clusters with a range ofinitial masses, initial concentrations, in circular or elliptical orbits indifferent tidal environments. models with and without initial mass segregationare included. the depletion of low mass stars in initially roche-volume (tidal)filling clusters starts typically on a time scale of the order of the corecollapse time. in clusters that are initially underfilling their roche-volumeit takes longer because the clusters have to expand to their tidal radii beforedynamical mass loss becomes important.  we introduce the concept of the differential mass function (dmf), whichdescribes the changes with respect to the initial mass function (imf). we showthat the evolution of the dmf can be described by a set of very simple analyticexpressions that are valid for a wide range of initial cluster parameters andfor different imfs. the agreement between this description and the models isvery good, except for initially roche-volume underfilling clusters that areseverely mass segregated.

1305.3656	ultra compact dwarf galaxy formation by tidal stripping of nucleated  dwarf galaxies	ultra compact dwarf galaxies (ucds) and dwarf galaxy nuclei have many commonproperties, such as internal velocity dispersions and colour-magnitude trends,suggesting tidally stripped dwarf galaxies as a possible ucd origin. however,ucds typically have sizes more than twice as large as nuclei at the sameluminosity. we use a gpu-enabled version of the particle-mesh code\textsc{superbox} to study the possibility of turning nucleated dwarf galaxiesinto ucds by tidally stripping them in a virgo-like galaxy cluster. we findthat motion in spherical potentials, where close passages happen many times,leads to the formation of compact ($r_h \lesssim 20$ pc) star clusters/ucds. incontrast, orbital motion where close passages happen only once or twice leadsto the formation of extended objects which are large enough to account for thefull range of observed ucd sizes. for such motion, we find that dwarf galaxiesneed close pericentre passages with distances less than 10 kpc to undergostrong enough stripping so that ucd formation is possible. as tidal strippingproduces objects with similar properties to ucds, and our estimates suggestdwarf galaxies have been destroyed in sufficient numbers to explain theobserved number of ucds in m87, we consider tidal stripping to be a likelyorigin of ucds. however, comparison with cosmological simulations is needed todetermine if the number and spatial distribution of ucds formed by tidalstripping matches the observations of ucds in galaxy clusters.

1307.2020	the stellar mass function, binary content and radial structure of the  open cluster praesepe derived from ppmxl and sdss data	we have determined possible cluster members of the nearby open clusterpraesepe (m44) based on j and k photometry and proper motions from the ppmxlcatalogue and z photometry from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). in totalwe identified 893 possible cluster members down to a magnitude of j = 15.5 mag,corresponding to a mass of about 0.15 msun for an assumed cluster distancemodulus of (m-m)_0 = 6.30 mag (d ~ 182 pc), within a radius of 3.5{\deg} aroundthe cluster centre. we derive a new cluster centre for praesepe({\alpha}_centre = 8h 39m 37s, {\delta}_centre = 19{\deg} 35' 02"). we alsoderive a total cluster mass of about 630 msun and a 2d half-number andhalf-mass radius of 4.25 pc and 3.90 pc respectively. the global mass function(mf) of the cluster members shows evidence for a turnover around m = 0.65 msun.while more massive stars can be fit by a power-law {\xi}(m) ~ m^(-{\alpha})with slope {\alpha} = 2.88 +/- 0.22, stars less massive than m = 0.65 msun arebest fitted with {\alpha} = 0.85 +/- 0.10. in agreement with its largedynamical age, we find that praesepe is strongly mass segregated and that themass function slope for high mass stars steepens from a value of {\alpha} =2.32 +/- 0.24 inside the half-mass radius to {\alpha} = 4.90 +/- 0.51 outsidethe half-mass radius. we finally identify a significant population of binariesand triples in the colour-magnitude diagram of praesepe. assuming non-randompairing of the binary components, a binary fraction of about 35% for primariesin the mass range 0.6 &lt; m/msun &lt; 2.20 is required to explain the observednumber of binaries in the colour-magnitude diagram (cmd).

1308.1398	on central black holes in ultra-compact dwarf galaxies	context: the dynamical mass-to-light (m/l) ratios of massive ultra-compactdwarf galaxies (ucds) are about 50% higher than predicted by stellar populationmodels. aims: here we investigate the possibility that these elevated m/lratios are caused by a central black hole (bh), heating up the internal motionof stars. we focus on a sample of ~50 extragalactic ucds for which velocitydispersions and structural parameters have been measured. methods: usingup-to-date distance moduli and a consistent treatment of aperture and seeingeffects, we calculate the ratio psi=(m/l)_{dyn}/(m/l)_{pop} between thedynamical and the stellar population m/l of ucds. for all ucds with psi&gt;1 weestimate the mass of a hypothetical central bh needed to reproduce the observedintegrated velocity dispersion. results: massive ucds (m&gt;10^7 m_*) have anaverage psi = 1.7 +-0.2, implying notable amounts of dark mass in them. we findthat, on average, central bh masses of 10-15% of the ucd mass can explain theseelevated dynamical m/l ratios. the implied bh masses in ucds range from several10^5 m_* to several 10^7 m_*. in the m_bh-luminosity plane, ucds are offset byabout two orders of magnitude in luminosity from the relation derived forgalaxies. our findings can be interpreted such that massive ucds originate fromprogenitor galaxies with masses around 10^9 m_*, and that those progenitorshave smbh occupation fractions of 60-100%. the suggested ucd progenitor massesagree with predictions from the tidal stripping scenario. lower-mass ucds(m&lt;10^7 m_*) exhibit a bimodal distribution in psi, suggestive of a coexistenceof massive globular clusters and tidally stripped galaxies in this mass regime.conclusions: central bhs as relict tracers of tidally stripped progenitorgalaxies are a plausible explanation for the elevated dynamical m/l ratios ofucds.

1309.0451	n-body simulations of globular clusters in tidal fields: effects of  intermediate-mass black holes	intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs) may provide the missing link tounderstanding the growth of supermassive black holes in the early universe.some formation scenarios predict that imbhs could have formed by runawaycollisions in globular clusters (gcs). understanding the influence of an imbhin the center of a gc on its environment might provide indirect detectionmethods. our goal is to test the effects of different initial compositions ofgcs on their evolution in a tidal field. we pin down the crucial observablesthat indicate the presence of an imbh at the center of the cluster. in additionto central imbhs, we also consider the effects of different stellar-mass blackhole retention and stellar binary fractions. we performed a set of 22 n-bodysimulations and varied particle numbers, imbh masses, stellar-mass black-holeretention fractions, and stellar binary fractions. these models are all run inan external tidal field to study the effect of black holes on the cluster massloss, mass function, and life times. finally, we compared our results withobservational data. we found that a central massive black hole increases theescape rate of high-mass stars from a star cluster, implying that the relativedepletion of the mass function at the low-mass end proceeds less rapidly.furthermore, we found a similar behavior for a cluster hosting a high number ofstellar-mass black holes instead of one massive central imbh. the presence ofan imbh also weakly affects the fraction of the cluster mass that isconstituted by stellar remnants, as does the presence of primordial binaries.we compared our simulations with observational data from the literature andfound good agreement between our models and observed mass functions andstructural parameters of gcs. we exploited this agreement to identify gcs thatcould potentially host imbhs.

1310.3631	a prescription and fast code for the long-term evolution of star  clusters - ii. unbalanced and core evolution	we introduce version two of the fast star cluster evolution code evolve me acluster of stars (emacss). the first version (alexander &amp; gieles) assumed thatcluster evolution is balanced for the majority of the life-cycle, meaning thatthe rate of energy generation in the core of the cluster equals the diffusionrate of energy by two-body relaxation, which makes the code suitable formodelling clusters in weak tidal fields. in this new version we extend themodel to include an unbalanced phase of evolution to describe the pre-collapseevolution and the accompanying escape rate such that clusters in strong tidalfields can also be modelled. we also add a prescription for the evolution ofthe core radius and density and a related cluster concentration parameter. themodel simultaneously solves a series of first-order ordinary differentialequations for the rate of change of the core radius, half-mass radius and thenumber of member stars n. about two thousand integration steps in time arerequired to solve for the entire evolution of a star cluster and this number isapproximately independent of n. we compare the model to the variation of theseparameters following from a series of direct n-body calculations of single-massclusters and find good agreement in the evolution of all parameters. relevanttime-scales, such as the total lifetimes and core collapse times, arereproduced with an accuracy of about 10% for clusters with various initialhalf-mass radii (relative to their jacobi radii) and a range of differentinitial n up to n = 65536. we intend to extend this framework to include morerealistic initial conditions, such as a stellar mass spectrum and mass lossfrom stars. the emacss code can be used in star cluster population studies andin models that consider the co-evolution of (globular) star clusters and largescale structures.

1312.3629	a comparison of the distribution of satellite galaxies around andromeda  and the results of $\lambda$cdm simulations	ibata et al. (2013) recently reported the existence of a vast thin plane ofdwarf galaxies (vtpd) orbiting around andromeda. we investigate whether such aconfiguration can be reproduced within the standard cosmological framework andsearch for similar planes of co-rotating satellite galaxies aroundandromeda-like host haloes in data from the millennium ii simulation combinedwith a semi-analytic galaxy formation model. we apply a baryonic mass cut of$2.8\times 10^4 \text{m}_{\text{sun}}$ for the satellite haloes and restrictthe data to a pandas like field. if we include the so-called orphan galaxies inour analysis, we find that planes with a rms lower than the vtpd are common inmillennium ii. this is partially due to the strongly radially concentrateddistribution of orphan galaxies. excluding part of the orphan galaxies bringsthe radial distributions of millennium ii satellites into better agreement withthe satellite distribution of andromeda while still producing a significantfraction of planes with a lower rms than the vtpd. we also find haloes inmillennium ii with an equal or higher number of co-rotating satellites than thevtpd. this demonstrates that the vtpd is not in conflict with the standardcosmological framework, although a definite answer of this question mightrequire higher resolution cosmological simulations that do not have to considerorphan galaxies. our results finally show that satellite planes in millenniumii are not stable structures, hence the vtpd might only be a statisticalfluctuation of an underlying more spherical galaxy distribution.

1403.4946	erosion of globular cluster systems: the influence of radial anisotropy,  central black holes and dynamical friction	we present the adaptable muesli code for investigating dynamics and erosionprocesses of globular clusters (gcs) in galaxies. muesli follows the orbits ofindividual clusters and applies internal and external dissolution processes tothem. orbit integration is based on the self-consistent field method incombination with a time-transformed leapfrog scheme, allowing us to handlevelocity-dependent forces like triaxial dynamical friction. in a firstapplication, the erosion of globular cluster systems (gcss) in ellipticalgalaxies is investigated. observations show that massive ellipticals have rich,radially extended gcss, while some compact dwarf ellipticals contain no gcs atall. for several representative examples, spanning the full mass scale ofobserved elliptical galaxies, we quantify the influence of radial anisotropy,galactic density profiles, smbhs, and dynamical friction on the gc erosionrate. we find that gc number density profiles are centrally flattened in lessthan a hubble time, naturally explaining observed cored gc distributions. theerosion rate depends primarily on a galaxy's mass, half-mass radius and radialanisotropy. the fraction of eroded gcs is nearly 100% in compact, m 32 likegalaxies and lowest in extended and massive galaxies. finally, we uncover theexistence of a violent tidal disruption dominated phase which is important forthe rapid build-up of halo stars.

1408.4467	contribution of stripped nuclear clusters to globular cluster and  ultra-compact dwarf galaxy populations	we use the millennium ii cosmological simulation combined with thesemi-analytic galaxy formation model of guo et al. (2011) to predict thecontribution of galactic nuclei formed by the tidal stripping of nucleateddwarf galaxies to globular cluster (gc) and ultra-compact dwarf galaxy (ucd)populations of galaxies. we follow the merger trees of galaxies in clustersback in time and determine the absolute number and stellar masses of disruptedgalaxies. we assume that at all times nuclei have a distribution innucleus-to-galaxy mass and nucleation fraction of galaxies similar to thatobserved in the present day universe. our results show stripped nuclei follow amass function $n(m) \sim m^{-1.5}$ in the mass range $10^6 &lt; m/m_\odot &lt; 10^8$,significantly flatter than found for globular clusters. the contribution ofstripped nuclei will therefore be most important among high-mass gcs and ucds.for the milky way we predict between 1 and 3 star clusters more massive than$10^5 m_\odot$ come from tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies, with the mostmassive cluster formed having a typical mass of a few times $10^6 m_\odot$,like omega centauri. for a galaxy cluster with a mass $7 \times 10^{13}m_\odot$, similar to fornax, we predict $\sim$19 ucds more massive than$2\times10^6 m_\odot$ and $\sim$9 ucds more massive than $10^7 m_\odot$ withina projected distance of 300 kpc come from tidally stripped dwarf galaxies. theobserved number of ucds are $\sim$200 and 23, respectively. we conclude thatmost ucds in galaxy clusters are probably simply the high mass end of the gcmass function.

1409.4769	a supermassive black hole in an ultracompact dwarf galaxy	ultracompact dwarf galaxies (ucds) are among the densest stellar systems inthe universe. these systems have masses up to 200 million solar masses, buthalf light radii of just 3-50 parsecs. dynamical mass estimates show that manyucds are more massive than expected from their luminosity. it remains unclearwhether these high dynamical mass estimates are due to the presence ofsupermassive black holes or result from a non-standard stellar initial massfunction that causes the average stellar mass to be higher than expected. herewe present the detection of a supermassive black hole in a massive ucd.adaptive optics kinematic data of m60-ucd1 show a central velocity dispersionpeak above 100 km/s and modest rotation. dynamical modeling of these datareveals the presence of a supermassive black hole with mass of 21 million solarmasses. this is 15% of the object's total mass. the high black hole mass andmass fraction suggest that m60-ucd1 is the stripped nucleus of a galaxy. ouranalysis also shows that m60-ucd1's stellar mass is consistent with itsluminosity, implying many other ucds may also host supermassive black holes.this suggests a substantial population of previously unnoticed supermassiveblack holes.

0804.2299	the influence of initial mass segregation on the runaway merging of  stars	we have investigated the effect of initial mass segregation on the runawaymerging of stars. the evolution of multi-mass, dense star clusters was followedby means of direct n-body simulations of up to 131.072 stars. all clustersstarted from king models with dimensionless central potentials of 3.0 &lt;= w_0 &lt;=9.0. initial mass segregation was realized by varying the minimum mass of acertain fraction of stars whose either (1) distances were closest to thecluster center or (2) total energies were lowest. the second case is morefavorable to promote the runaway merging of stars by creating a high-mass coreof massive, low-energy stars. initial mass segregation could decrease thecentral relaxation time and thus help the formation of a high-mass core.however, we found that initial mass segregation does not help the runawaystellar merger to happen if the overall mass density profile is kept constant.this is due to the fact that the collision rate of stars is not increased dueto initial mass segregation. our simulations show that initial mass segregationis not sufficient to allow runaway merging of stars to occur in clusters withcentral densities typical for star clusters in the milky way.

1501.07441	intermediate-mass black holes in globular clusters: observations and  simulations	the study of intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs) is a young and promisingfield of research. formed by runaway collisions of massive stars in young anddense stellar clusters, intermediate-mass black holes could still be present inthe centers of globular clusters, today. our group investigated the presence ofintermediate-mass black holes for a sample of 10 galactic globular clusters. wemeasured the inner kinematic profiles with integral-field spectroscopy anddetermined masses or upper limits of central black holes in each cluster. incombination with literature data we further studied the positions of ourresults on known black-hole scaling relations (such as m_bh - sigma) and founda similar but flatter correlation for imbhs. applying cluster evolution codes,the change in the slope could be explained with the stellar mass loss occurringin clusters in a tidal field over its life time. furthermore, we presentresults from several numerical simulations on the topic of imbhs and integralfield units (ifus). we ran n-body simulations of globular clusters containingimbhs in a tidal field and studied their effects on mass-loss rates and remnantfractions and showed that an imbh in the center prevents core collapse andejects massive objects more rapidly. these simulations were further used tosimulate ifu data cubes. for the specific case of ngc 6388 we simulated twodifferent ifu techniques and found that velocity dispersion measurements fromindividual velocities are strongly biased towards lower values due to blends ofneighbouring stars and background light. in addition, we use the astrophysicalmultipurpose software environment (amuse) to combine gravitational physics,stellar evolution and hydrodynamics to simulate the accretion of stellar windsonto a black hole.

1503.00726	radial distributions of sub-populations in the globular cluster m15: a  more centrally concentrated primordial population	we examine the radial distributions of stellar populations in the globularcluster (gc) m15, using hst/wfc3 photometry of red giants in thenitrogen-sensitive f343n-f555w color. surprisingly, we find that giants with"primordial" composition (i.e., n abundances similar to those in field stars)are the most centrally concentrated within the wfc3 field. we then combine ourwfc3 data with sdss u, g photometry and find that the trend reverses for radii&gt;1' (3 pc) where the ratio of primordial to n-enhanced giants increasesoutwards, as already found by lardo et al. the ratio of primordial to enrichedstars thus has a u-shaped dependency on radius with a minimum near thehalf-light radius. n-body simulations show that mass segregation might producea trend resembling the observed one, but only if the n-enhanced giants are~0.25 mo less massive than the primordial giants, which requires extreme heenhancement (y~0.40). however, such a large difference in y is incompatiblewith the negligible optical color differences between primordial and enrichedgiants which suggest delta y &lt; 0.03 and thus a difference in turn-off mass ofdelta m &lt; 0.04 mo between the different populations. the radial trends in m15are thus unlikely to be of dynamical origin and presumably reflect initialconditions, a result that challenges all current gc formation scenarios. wenote that population gradients in the central regions of gcs remain poorlyinvestigated and may show a more diverse behavior than hitherto thought.

1507.02813	a re-evaluation of the central velocity-dispersion profile in ngc 6388	recently, two independent groups found very different results when measuringthe central velocity dispersion of the galactic globular cluster ngc 6388 withdifferent methods. while l\"utzgendorf et al. (2011) found a rising profile anda high central velocity dispersion (23.3 km/s), measurements obtained bylanzoni et al. (2013) showed a value 40% lower. the value of the centralvelocity dispersion has a serious impact on the mass and possible presence ofan intermediate-mass black hole at the center of ngc 6388. we use a photometriccatalog of ngc 6388 to create a simulated sinfoni and argus dataset. theconstruction of the ifu data cube is done with different observing conditionsreproducing the conditions reported for the original observations as closely aspossible. in addition, we produce an n-body realization of a 10^6 m_sun stellarcluster with the same photometric properties as ngc 6388 to account forunresolved stars. we find that the individual radial velocities, i.e. themeasurements from the simulated sinfoni data, are systematically biased towardslower velocity dispersions. the reason is that due to the wings in the pointspread function the velocities get biased towards the mean cluster velocity.this study shows that even with ao supported observations, individual radialvelocities in crowded fields are likely to be biased. the argus observations donot show this kind of bias but were found to have larger uncertainties thanpreviously obtained. we find a bias towards higher velocity dispersions in theargus pointing when fixing the extreme velocities of the three brightest starsbut find those variations are within the determined uncertainties. we rerunjeans models and fit the kinematic profile with the new uncertainties. thisyields a bh mass of m_bh = (2.8 +- 0.4) x 10^4 m_sun and m/l ratio m/l = (1.6+- 0.1) m_sun/l_sun, consistent with our previous results.

0806.0374	the nature of ucds: internal dynamics from an expanded sample and  homogeneous database	we have obtained high-resolution spectra of 23 ultra-compact dwarf galaxies(ucds) in the fornax cluster with -10.4&gt;m_v&gt;-13.5 mag (10^6&lt;m/m_*&lt;10^8), usingflames/giraffe at the vlt. this is the largest homogeneous data set of ucdinternal dynamics assembled to date. we derive dynamical m/l ratios for 15 ucdscovered by hst imaging. in the m_v-sigma plane, ucds with m_v&lt;-12 mag areconsistent with the extrapolated faber-jackson relation for luminousellipticals, while fainter ucds are closer to the extrapolated globular cluster(gc) relation. at a given metallicity, fornax ucds have on average 30-40% lowerm/l ratios than virgo ucds, suggesting possible differences in age or darkmatter content between fornax and virgo ucds. for our sample of fornax ucds wefind no significant correlation between m/l ratio and mass. we combine our datawith available m/l ratio measurements of compact stellar systems with10^4&lt;m/m_*&lt;10^8, and normalise all m/l estimates to solar metallicity. we findthat ucds (m &gt; 2*10^6 m_*) have m/l ratios twice as large as gcs (m &lt; 2*10^6m_*). we show that stellar population models tend to under-predict dynamicalm/l ratios of ucds and over-predict those of gcs. considering the scalingrelations of stellar spheroids, ucds align well along the 'fundamentalmanifold', constituting the small-scale end of the galaxy sequence. thealignment for ucds is especially clear for r_e &gt;~ 7 pc, which corresponds todynamical relaxation times that exceed a hubble time. in contrast, gcs exhibita broader scatter and do not appear to align along the manifold. we argue thatucds are the smallest dynamically un-relaxed stellar systems, with m &gt; 2*10^6m_* and 7&lt;r_e&lt;100 pc. future studies should aim at explaining the elevated m/lratios of ucds and the environmental dependence of their properties.

0806.0622	evidence for primordial mass segregation in globular clusters	we have studied the dissolution of initially mass segregated and unsegregatedstar clusters due to two-body relaxation in external tidal fields, usingaarseth's collisional n-body code nbody4 on grape6 special-purpose computers.when extrapolating results of initially not mass segregated models to globularclusters, we obtain a correlation between the time until destruction and theslope of the mass function, in the sense that globular clusters which arecloser to dissolution are more strongly depleted in low-mass stars. thiscorrelation fits observed mass functions of most globular clusters. the massfunctions of several globular clusters are however more strongly depleted inlow-mass stars than suggested by these models. such strongly depleted massfunctions can be explained if globular clusters started initially masssegregated. primordial mass segregation also explains the correlation betweenthe slope of the stellar mass function and the cluster concentration which wasrecently discovered by de marchi et al. (2007). in this case, it is possiblethat all globular clusters started with a mass function similar to that seen inyoung open clusters in the present-day universe, at least for stars below m=0.8msun. this argues for a near universality of the mass function for differentstar formation environments and metallicities in the range -2 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; 0. wefinally describe a novel algorithm which can initialise stationary masssegregated clusters with arbitrary density profile and amount of masssegregation.

1510.07206	kinematics of dwarf galaxies in gas-rich groups, and the survival and  detectability of tidal dwarf galaxies	we present deimos multi-object spectroscopy (mos) of 22 star-forming dwarfgalaxies located in four gas-rich groups, including six newly-discovereddwarfs. two of the galaxies are strong tidal dwarf galaxy (tdg) candidatesbased on our luminosity-metallicity relation definition. we model the rotationcurves of these galaxies. our sample shows low mass-to-light ratios(m/l=0.73$\pm0.39m_\odot/l_\odot$) as expected for young, star-forming dwarfs.one of the galaxies in our sample has an apparently strongly-falling rotationcurve, reaching zero rotational velocity outside the turnover radius of$r_{turn}=1.2r_e$. this may be 1) a polar ring galaxy, with a tilted bar withina face-on disk; 2) a kinematic warp. these scenarios are indistinguishable withour current data due to limitations of slit alignment inherent to mos-modeobservations. we consider whether tdgs can be detected based on their tidalradius, beyond which tidal stripping removes kinematic tracers such ash$\alpha$ emission. when the tidal radius is less than about twice the turnoverradius, the expected falling rotation curve cannot be reliably measured. thisis problematic for as much as half of our sample, and indeed more generally,galaxies in groups like these. further to this, the h$\alpha$ light thatremains must be sufficiently bright to be detected; this is only the case forthree (14%) galaxies in our sample. we conclude that the falling rotationcurves expected of tidal dwarf galaxies are intrinsically difficult to detect.

0806.3973	the main sequence of star clusters	a novel way of looking at the evolution of star clusters is presented. with adynamical temperature, given by the mean kinetic energy of the cluster stars,and a dynamical luminosity, which is defined as the kinetic energy of the starsleaving the cluster in analogy to the energy of photons emitted by a star, thedissolution of star clusters is studied using a new dynamicaltemperature-luminosity diagram for star clusters. the investigation contains aparameter-space study of open clusters of up to n = 32768 single-mass starswith different initial density distributions, half-mass radii, tidal conditionsand binary fractions. the clusters show a strong correlation between dynamicaltemperature and dynamical luminosity and most of the investigated clusterfamilies share a common sequence in such a dynamical temperature-luminositydiagram. deviations from this sequence are analyzed and discussed. after corecollapse, the position of a cluster within this diagram can be defined by threeparameters: the mass, the tidal conditions and the binary fraction. due to corecollapse all initial conditions are lost and the remaining stars adjust to thegiven tidal conditions. binaries as internal energy sources influence thisadjustment. a further finding concerns the lagrange radii of star clusters:throughout the investigated parameter space nearly all clusters show a constanthalf-mass radius for the time after core collapse until dissolution.furthermore, the ratio of half-mass radius to tidal radius evolves onto acommon sequence which only depends on the mass left in the cluster.

astro-ph;0206258	long-term evolution of isolated n-body sytems	we report results of n-body simulations of isolated star clusters, performedup to the point where the clusters are nearly completely dissolved. our mainfocus is on the post-collapse evolution of these clusters. we find that aftercore collapse, isolated clusters evolve along nearly a single sequence ofmodels whose properties are independent of the initial density profile andparticle number. due to the slower expansion of high-n clusters, relaxationtimes become almost independent of the particle number after several corecollapse times, at least for the particle range of our study. as a result, thedissolution times of isolated clusters exhibit a surprisingly weak dependenceon n.  we find that most stars escape due to encounters between single stars insidethe half-mass radius of the cluster. encounters with binaries take place mostlyin the cluster core and account for roughly 15% of all escapers. encountersbetween single stars at intermediate radii are also responsible for the buildup of a radial anisotropic velocity distribution in the halo. for clustersundergoing core oscillations, escape due to binary stars is efficient only whenthe cluster center is in a contracted phase. our simulations show that it takesabout 10^5 n-body time units until the global anisotropy reaches its maximumvalue. the anisotropy increases with particle number and it seems conceivablethat isolated star clusters become vulnerable to radial orbit instabilities forlarge enough n. however, no indication for the onset of such instabilities wasseen in our runs.

astro-ph;0211471	dynamical evolution of star clusters in tidal fields	we report results of a large set of n-body calculations aimed to study theevolution of multi-mass star clusters in external tidal fields. our clustersstart with the same initial mass-functions, but varying particle numbers,orbital types and density profiles. our main focus is to study how the stellarmass-function and other cluster parameters change under the combined influenceof stellar evolution, two-body relaxation and the external tidal field. we findthat the lifetimes of star clusters moving on similar orbits scale as t simt_rh^x, where t_rh is the relaxation time, and the exponent x depends on theinitial concentration of the cluster and is around x approx 0.75. from theresults for the lifetimes, we predict that between 53% to 67% of all galacticglobular clusters will be destroyed within the next hubble time. low-mass starsare preferentially lost and the depletion is strong enough to turn initiallyincreasing mass-functions into mass-functions which decrease towards thelow-mass end. the details of this depletion are insensitive to the startingcondition of the cluster. the preferential depletion of low-mass stars fromstar clusters leads to a decrease of their mass-to-light ratios except for ashort period close to final dissolution. the fraction of compact remnants isincreasing throughout the evolution and they are more strongly concentratedtowards the cluster cores than main-sequence stars. for a sample of galacticglobular clusters with well observed parameters, we find a correlation betweenthe observed slope of the mass-function and the lifetimes predicted by us. itseems possible that galactic globular clusters started with a mass-functionsimilar to what one observes for the average mass-function of the galactic discand bulge.

astro-ph;0402622	the formation of massive black holes through collision runaway in dense  young star clusters	a luminous x-ray source is associated with a cluster (mgg-11) of young stars\~200pc from the center of the starburst galaxy m82. the properties of thex-ray source are best explained by a black hole with a mass of at least350msun, which is intermediate between stellar-mass and supermassive blackholes. a nearby but somewhat more massive star cluster (mgg-9) shows noevidence of such an intermediate mass black hole, raising the issue of justwhat physical characteristics of the clusters can account for this difference.here we report numerical simulations of the evolution and the motions of starswithin the clusters, where stars are allowed to mergers with each other. wefind that for mgg-11 dynamical friction leads to the massive stars sinkingrapidly to the center of the cluster to participate in a runaway collision,thereby producing a star of 800-3000msun, which ultimately collapses to anblack hole of intermediate mass. no such runaway occurs in the cluster mgg-9because the larger cluster radius leads to a mass-segregation timescale afactor of five longer than for mgg-11.

astro-ph;0406227	massive black holes in star clusters. i. equal-mass clusters	in this paper we report results of collisional n-body simulations of thedynamical evolution of equal-mass star clusters containing a massive centralblack hole. each cluster is composed of between 5,000 to 180,000 stars togetherwith a central black hole which contains between 0.2% to 10% of the totalcluster mass.  we find that for large enough black hole masses, the central density followsa power-law distribution with slope \rho \sim r^{-1.75} inside the radius ofinfluence of the black hole, in agreement with predictions from earlier fokkerplanck and monte carlo models. the tidal disruption rate of stars is within afactor of two of that derived in previous studies. it seems impossible to growan intermediate-mass black hole (imbh) from a m \le 100 msun progenitor in aglobular cluster by the tidal disruption of stars, although m = 10^3 msun imbhscan double their mass within a hubble time in dense globular clusters. the sameis true for the supermassive black hole at the centre of the milky way.  black holes in star clusters will feed mainly on stars tightly bound to themand the re-population of these stars causes the clusters to expand, reversingcore-collapse without the need for dynamically active binaries. closeencounters of stars in the central cusp also lead to an increased mass lossrate in the form of high-velocity stars escaping from the cluster. a companionpaper will extend these results to the multi-mass case.

astro-ph;0406231	massive black holes in star clusters. ii. realistic cluster models	we have followed the evolution of multi-mass star clusters containing massivecentral black holes through collisional n-body simulations done on grape6. eachcluster is composed of between 16,384 to 131,072 stars together with a blackhole with an initial mass of m_bh=1000 msun. we follow the evolution of theclusters under the combined influence of two-body relaxation, stellar mass-lossand tidal disruption of stars.  the (3d) mass density profile follows a power-law distribution \rho \simr^{-\alpha} with slope \alpha=1.55. this leads to a constant density profile ofbright stars in projection, which makes it highly unlikely that core collapseclusters contain intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs). instead globularclusters containing imbhs can be fitted with standard king profiles.  the disruption rate of stars is too small to form an imbh out of a m_bh\approx 50 msun progenitor black hole, unless a cluster starts with a centraldensity significantly higher than what is seen in globular clusters.  kinematical studies can reveal 1000 msun imbhs in the closest clusters. imbhsin globular clusters are only weak x-ray sources since the tidal disruptionrate of stars is low and the star closest to the imbh is normally another blackhole. for globular clusters, dynamical evolution can push compact stars nearthe imbh to distances small enough that they become detectable throughgravitational radiation. if 10% of all globular clusters contain imbhs,extragalactic globular clusters could be one of the major sources for {\itlisa}.

astro-ph;0410597	which globular clusters contain intermediate-mass black holes?	it has been assumed that intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs) in globularclusters can only reside in the most centrally concentrated clusters, with aso-called `core-collapsed' density profile. while this would be a naturalguess, it is in fact wrong. we have followed the evolution of star clusterscontaining imbhs with masses between 125 \le m_{bh} \le 1000 m_{\odot} throughdetailed n-body simulations, and we find that a cluster with an imbh, inprojection, appears to have a relatively large `core' with surface brightnessonly slightly rising toward the center. this makes it highly unlikely that anyof `core-collapsed' clusters will harbor an imbh. on the contrary, the placesto look for an imbh are those clusters that can be fitted well bymedium-concentration king models.  the velocity dispersion of the visible stars in a globular cluster with animbh is nearly constant well inside the apparent core radius. for a cluster ofmass m_c containing an imbh of mass m_{bh}, the influence of the imbh becomessignificant only at a fraction 2.5 m_{bh}/m_c of the half-mass radius, deepwithin the core, where it will affect only a small number of stars. inconclusion, observational detection of an imbh may be possible, but will bechallenging.

astro-ph;0505558	an analytical description of the disruption of star clusters in tidal  fields with an application to galactic open clusters	we present a simple analytical description of the disruption of star clustersin a tidal field, which agrees excellently with detailed n-body simulations.the analytic expression can be used to predict the mass and age histograms ofsurviving clusters for any cluster initial mass function and any clusterformation history. the method is applied to open clusters in the solarneighbourhood, based on the new cluster sample of kharchenko et al. from acomparison between the observed and predicted age distributions in the agerange between 10 myr to 3 gyr we find the following results: (1) the disruptiontime of a 10^4 m_sun cluster in the solar neighbourhood is about 1.3+/-0.5 gyr.this is a factor 5 shorter than derived from n-body simulations of clusters inthe tidal field of the galaxy. (2) the present starformation rate in boundclusters within 600 pc from the sun is 5.9+/-0.8 * 10^2 m_sun / myr, whichcorresponds to a surface star formation rate in bound clusters of 5.2+/-0.710^(-10) m_sun/yr/pc^2. (3) the age distribution of open clusters shows a bumpbetween 0.26 and 0.6 gyr when the cluster formation rate was 2.5 times higherthan before and after. (4) the present star formation rate in bound clusters ishalf as small as that derived from the study of embedded clusters. thedifference suggests that half of the clusters in the solar neighbourhood becomeunbound within 10 myr. (5) the most massive clusters within 600 pc had aninitial mass of 3*10^4 m_sun. this is in agreement with the statisticallyexpected value based on a cluster initial mass function with a slope of -2,even if the physical upper mass limit is as high as 10^6 m_sun.

astro-ph;0511397	the ecology of star clusters and intermediate mass black holes in the  galactic bulge	we simulate the inner 100pc of the milky-way galaxy to study the formationand evolution of the population of star clusters and intermediate mass blackholes. for this study we perform extensive direct n-body simulations of thestar clusters which reside in the bulge, and of the inner few tenth of parsecsof the super massive black hole in the galactic center. in our n-bodysimulations the dynamical friction of the star cluster in the tidal field ofthe bulge are taken into account via (semi)analytic soluations. the n-bodycalculations are used to calibrate a (semi)analytic model of the formation andevolution of the bulge. we find that about 10% of the clusters born within100pc of the galactic center undergo core collapse during their inwardmigration and form intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs) via runaway stellarmerging. after the clusters dissolve, these imbhs continue their inward drift,carrying a few of the most massive stars with them. we predict that regionwithin about 10 parsec of the smbh is populated by about 50imbhs of some1000msun. several of these are expected to be accompanied still by some of themost massive stars from the star cluster. we also find that within a fewmilliparsec of the smbh there is a steady population of several imbhs. thispopulation drives the merger rate between imbhs and the smbh at a rate of aboutone per 10myr, sufficient to build the accumulate majority of mass of the smbh.mergers of imbhs with smbhs throughout the universe are detectable by lisa, ata rate of about two per week.

astro-ph;0607455	ejection of hyper-velocity stars from the galactic centre by  intermediate-mass black holes	we have performed n-body simulations of the formation of hyper-velocity stars(hvs) in the centre of the milky way due to inspiralling intermediate-massblack holes (imbhs). we considered imbhs of different masses, all starting fromcircular orbits at an initial distance of 0.1 pc.  we find that the imbhs sink to the centre of the galaxy due to dynamicalfriction, where they deplete the central cusp of stars. some of these starsbecome hvs and are ejected with velocities sufficiently high to escape thegalaxy. since the hvs carry with them information about their origin, inparticular in the moment of ejection, the velocity distribution and thedirection in which they escape the galaxy, detecting a population of hvs willprovide insight in the ejection processes and could therefore provide indirectevidence for the existence of imbhs.  our simulations show that hvs are generated in short bursts which last only afew myrs until the imbh is swallowed by the supermassive black hole (smbh). hvsare ejected almost isotropically, which makes imbh induced ejections hard todistinguish from ejections due to encounters of stellar binaries with a smbh.after the hvs have reached the galactic halo, their escape velocities correlatewith the distance from the galactic centre in the sense that the fastest hvscan be found furthest away from the centre. the velocity distribution of hvsgenerated by inspiralling imbhs is also nearly independent of the mass of theimbh and can be quite distinct from one generated by binary encounters.  finally, our simulations show that the presence of an imbh in the galacticcentre changes the stellar density distribution inside r&lt;0.02 pc into a coreprofile, which takes at least 100 myrs to replenish.

astro-ph;0701758	observational templates of star cluster disruption. the stellar group  ngc 1901 in front of the large magellanic cloud	observations indicate that present-day star formation in the milky way disktakes place in stellar ensembles or clusters rather than in isolation. bound,long lived stellar groups are known as open clusters. they gradually lose starsand in their final evolutionary stages they are severely disrupted leaving anopen cluster remnant made of a few stars. in this paper, we study in detail thestellar content and kinematics of the poorly populated star cluster ngc1901.this object appears projected against the large magellanic cloud. the aim ofthe present work is to derive the current evolutionary status, binary fraction,age and mass of this stellar group. these are fundamental quantities to comparewith those from n-body models in order to study the most general topic of starcluster evolution and dissolution.the analysis is performed using wide-fieldphotometry in the ubvi pass-band, proper motions from the ucac.2 catalog, and 3epochs of high resolution spectroscopy, as well as results from extensiven-body calculations.the star group ngc1901 is found to be an ensemble of solarmetallicity stars, 400+/-100 myr old, with a core radius of 0.23 pc, a tidalradius of 1.0 pc, and located at 400+/-50 pc from the sun. out of 13 confirmedmembers, only 5 single stars have been found. its estimated present-day binaryfraction is at least 62%. the calculated heliocentric space motion of thecluster is not compatible with possible membership in the hyades stream.ourresults show that ngc1901 is a clear prototype of open cluster remnantcharacterized by a large value of the binary fraction and a significantdepletion of low-mass stars. in the light of numerical simulations, this iscompatible with ngc1901 being what remains of a larger system initially made of500-750 stars.

astro-ph;0703290	evolution of collisionally merged massive stars	we investigate the evolution of collisionally merged stars with mass of ~100msun which might be formed in dense star clusters. we assumed that massivestars with several tens msun collide typically after ~1myr of the formation ofthe cluster and performed hydrodynamical simulations of several collisionevents. our simulations show that after the collisions, merged stars haveextended envelopes and their radii are larger than those in the thermalequilibrium states and that their interiors are he-rich because of the stellarevolution of the progenitor stars. we also found that if the mass-ratio ofmerging stars is far from unity, the interior of the merger product is not wellmixed and the elemental abundance is not homogeneous. we then followed theevolution of these collision products by a one dimensional stellar evolutioncode. after an initial contraction on the kelvin-helmholtz (thermal adjustment)timescale (~1000-10000 yr), the evolution of the merged stars traces that ofsingle homogeneous stars with corresponding masses and abundances, while theinitial contraction phase shows variations which depend on the mass ratio ofthe merged stars. we infer that, once runaway collisions have set in,subsequent collisions of the merged stars take place before mass loss bystellar winds becomes significant. hence, stellar mass loss does not inhibitthe formation of massive stars with mass of ~1000msun.

0809.2783	high mass-to-light ratios of ucds - evidence for dark matter ?	ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (ucds) are stellar systems with masses of around10^7 to 10^8 msun and half mass radii of 10-100 pc. they have some propertiesin common with massive globular clusters, however dynamical mass estimates haveshown that ucds have mass-to-light ratios which are on average about twice aslarge than those of globular clusters at comparable metallicity, and tend to belarger than what one would expect for old stellar systems with standard massfunctions.  one possible explanation for elevated high mass-to-light ratios in ucds isthe existence of a substantial amount of dark matter, which could have ended upin ucds if they are the remnant nuclei of tidally stripped dwarf galaxies.tidal stripping of dwarf galaxies has also been suggested has the origin ofseveral massive globular clusters like omega cen, in which case globularclusters could have also formed with substantial amounts of dark matter.  in this paper, we present collisional n-body simulations which study theco-evolution of a system composed out of stars and dark matter. we find thatthe dark matter gets removed from the central regions of such systems due todynamical friction and mass segregation of stars. the friction timescale issignificantly shorter than a hubble time for typical globular clusters, whilemost ucds have friction times much longer than a hubble time. therefore, asignificant dark matter fraction remains within the half-mass radius ofpresent-day ucds, making dark matter a viable explanation for the elevated m/lratios of ucds. if at least some globular clusters formed in a way similar toucds, we predict a substantial amount of dark matter in their outer parts.
