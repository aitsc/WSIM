0706.3048	a dark core in abell 520	the rich cluster abell 520 (z=0.201) exhibits truly extreme and puzzlingmulti-wavelength characteristics. it may best be described as a "cosmic trainwreck." it is a major merger showing abundant evidence for ram pressurestripping, with a clear offset in the gas distribution compared to the galaxies(as in the bullet cluster 1e 0657-558). however, the most striking feature is amassive dark core (721 h_70 m_sun/l_sun) in our weak lensing massreconstruction. the core coincides with the central x-ray emission peak, but islargely devoid of galaxies. an unusually low mass to light ratio region lies500 kpc to the east, and coincides with a shock feature visible in radioobservations of the cluster. although a displacement between the x-ray gas andthe galaxy/dark matter distributions may be expected in a merger, a mass peakwithout galaxies cannot be easily explained within the current collisionlessdark matter paradigm. interestingly, the integrated gas mass fraction (~0.15),mass-to-light ratio (220 h_70 m_sun/l_sun), and position on the x-rayluminosity-temperature and mass-temperature relations are unremarkable. thusgross properties and scaling relations are not always useful indicators of thedynamical state of clusters.

0707.0066	first detection of galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing in rcs. a new tool for  studying the matter environment of galaxy pairs	the weak gravitational lensing effect, small coherent distortions of galaxyimages by means of a gravitational tidal field, can be used to study therelation between the matter and galaxy distribution. in this context, weaklensing has so far only been used for considering a second-order correlationfunction that relates the matter density and galaxy number density as afunction of separation. we implement two new, third-order correlation functionsthat have recently been suggested in the literature, and apply them to thered-sequence cluster survey. we demonstrate that it is possible, even withalready existing data, to make significant measurements of third-order lensingcorrelations. we develop an optimised computer code for the correlationfunctions. to test its reliability a set of tests are performed. thecorrelation functions are transformed to aperture statistics, which allow easytests for remaining systematics in the data. in order to further verify therobustness of our measurement, the signal is shown to vanish when randomisingthe source ellipticities. finally, the lensing signal is compared to crudepredictions based on the halo-model. on angular scales between roughly 1 arcminand 11 arcmin a significant third-order correlation between two lens positionsand one source ellipticity is found. we discuss this correlation function as anovel tool to study the average matter environment of pairs of galaxies.correlating two source ellipticities and one lens position yields a lesssignificant but nevertheless detectable signal on a scale of 4 arcmin. bothsignals lie roughly within the range expected by theory which supports theircosmological origin.[abridged]

1011.1310	intracluster supernovae in the multi-epoch nearby cluster survey	the multi-epoch nearby cluster survey (meneacs) has discovered twenty-threecluster type ia supernovae (sne) in the 58 x-ray selected galaxy clusters (0.05&lt; z &lt; 0.15) surveyed. four of our sn ia events have no host galaxy on closeinspection, and are likely intracluster sne. deep image stacks at the locationof the candidate intracluster sne put upper limits on the luminosities of fainthosts, with m_{r} &gt; -13.0 mag and m_{g} &gt; -12.5 mag in all cases. for suchlimits, the fraction of the cluster luminosity in faint dwarfs below ourdetection limit is &lt;0.1%, assuming a standard cluster luminosity function. allfour events occurred within ~600 kpc of the cluster center (projected), asdefined by the position of the brightest cluster galaxy, and are more centrallyconcentrated than the cluster sn ia population as a whole. after accounting forseveral observational biases that make intracluster sne easier to discover andspectroscopically confirm, we calculate an intracluster stellar mass fractionof 0.16^{+0.13}_{-0.09} (68% cl) for all objects within r_{200}. if we assumethat the intracluster stellar population is exclusively old, and the clustergalaxies themselves have a mix of stellar ages, we derive an upper limit on theintracluster stellar mass fraction of &lt;0.47 (84% one-sided cl). when combinedwith the intragroup sne results of mcgee &amp; balogh, we confirm the decliningintracluster stellar mass fraction as a function of halo mass reported bygonzalez and collaborators.

1105.3186	scaling relations and overabundance of massive clusters at z&gt;~1 from  weak-lensing studies with hst	we present weak gravitational lensing analysis of 22 high-redshift (z &gt;~1)clusters based on hubble space telescope images. most clusters in our sampleprovide significant lensing signals and are well detected in theirreconstructed two-dimensional mass maps. combining the current results and ourprevious weak-lensing studies of five other high-z clusters, we comparegravitational lensing masses of these clusters with other observables. werevisit the question whether the presence of the most massive clusters in oursample is in tension with the current lambdacdm structure formation paradigm.we find that the lensing masses are tightly correlated with the gastemperatures and establish, for the first time, the lensing mass-temperaturerelation at z &gt;~ 1. for the power law slope of the m-tx relation (m proptot^{\alpha}), we obtain \alpha=1.54 +/- 0.23. this is consistent with thetheoretical self-similar prediction \alpha=3/2 and with the results previouslyreported in the literature for much lower redshift samples. however, ournormalization is lower than the previous results by 20-30%, indicating that thenormalization in the m-tx relation might evolve. after correcting for eddingtonbias and updating the discovery area with a more conservative choice, we findthat the existence of the most massive clusters in our sample still provides atension with the current lambda cdm model. the combined probability of findingthe four most massive clusters in this sample after marginalization overcurrent cosmological parameters is less than 1%.

1109.5125	submillimetre source counts in the fields of high-redshift galaxy  clusters	we present a submillimetre survey of seven high-z galaxy clusters(0.64&lt;z&lt;1.0) using the submillimetre common-user bolometer array (scuba) at 850and 450 um. the targets, of similar richness and redshift, are selected fromthe red-sequence cluster survey (rcs). we use this sample to investigate theapparent excess of submillimetre source counts in the direction of clusterfields compared to blank fields. the sample consists of three galaxy clustersthat exhibit multiple optical arcs due to strong gravitational lensing, and acontrol group of four clusters with no apparent strong lensing. a tentativeexcess of 2.7-sigma is seen in the number density of submillimetre luminousgalaxies (smgs) within the lensing cluster fields compared to that in thecontrol group. ancillary observations at radio, mid-infrared, optical, andx-ray wavelengths allow for the identification of counterparts to many of thesmgs. utilizing photometric redshifts, we conclude that at least three of thegalaxies within the lensing fields have redshifts consistent with the clustersand implied infrared luminosities of ~10^12 lsol. the existence of smg clustermembers may therefore be boosting source counts in the lensing cluster fields,which might be an effect of the dynamical state of those clusters. however, wefind that the removal of potential cluster members from the counts analysisdoes not entirely eliminate the difference between the cluster samples. we alsoinvestigate possible occurrences of lensing between background smgs and lower-zoptical galaxies, though further observations are required to make anyconclusive claims. although the excess counts between the two cluster sampleshave not been unambiguously accounted for, these results warrant caution forinterpreting submillimetre source counts in cluster fields and point sourcecontamination for sunyaev-zel'dovich surveys.

1111.4434	cfhtlens: improving the quality of photometric redshifts with precision  photometry	here we present the results of various approaches to measure accurate coloursand photometric redshifts (photo-z's) from wide-field imaging data. we use datafrom the canada-france-hawaii-telescope legacy survey (cfhtls) which have beenre- processed by the cfht lensing survey (cfhtlens) team in order to carry outa number of weak gravitational lensing studies. an emphasis is put on thecorrection of systematic effects in the photo-z's arising from the differentpoint spread functions (psf) in the five optical bands. different ways ofcorrecting these effects are discussed and the resulting photo-z accuracies arequantified by comparing the photo-z's to large spectroscopic redshift (spec-z)data sets. careful homogenisation of the psf between bands leads to increasedoverall accuracy of photo-z's. the gain is particularly pronounced at faintermagnitudes where galaxies are smaller and flux measurements are affected moreby psf-effects. we also study possible re- calibrations of the photometriczeropoints (zps) with the help of galaxies with known spec-z's. we find that ifpsf-effects are properly taken into account, a re-calibration of the zpsbecomes much less important suggesting that previous such re-calibrationsdescribed in the literature could in fact be mostly corrections for psf-effectsrather than corrections for real inaccuracies in the zps. the implications ofthis finding for future surveys like kids, des, lsst, or euclid are mixed. onthe one hand, zp re-calibrations with spec-z's might not be as accurate aspreviously thought. on the other hand, careful psf homogenisation might providea way out and yield accurate, homogeneous photometry without the need for fullspectroscopic coverage. this is the first paper in a series describing thetechnical aspects of cfhtlens.

1203.6833	intrinsic galaxy shapes and alignments i: measuring and modelling cosmos  intrinsic galaxy ellipticities	the statistical properties of the ellipticities of galaxy images depend onhow galaxies form and evolve, and therefore constrain models of galaxymorphology, which are key to the removal of the intrinsic alignmentcontamination of cosmological weak lensing surveys, as well as to thecalibration of weak lensing shape measurements. we construct such models basedon the halo properties of the millennium simulation and confront them with asample of 90,000 galaxies from the cosmos survey, covering three decades inluminosity and redshifts out to z=2. the ellipticity measurements are correctedfor effects of point spread function smearing, spurious image distortions, andmeasurement noise. dividing galaxies into early, late, and irregular types, wefind that early-type galaxies have up to a factor of two lower intrinsicellipticity dispersion than late-type galaxies. none of the samples showsevidence for redshift evolution, while the ellipticity dispersion for late-typegalaxies scales strongly with absolute magnitude at the bright end. thesimulation-based models reproduce the main characteristics of the intrinsicellipticity distributions although which model fares best depends on theselection criteria of the galaxy sample. we observe fewer close-to-circularlate-type galaxy images in cosmos than expected for a sample of randomlyoriented circular thick disks and discuss possible explanations for thisdeficit.

0712.0884	very weak lensing in the cfhtls wide: cosmology from cosmic shear in the  linear regime	we present an exploration of weak lensing by large-scale structure in thelinear regime, using the third-year (t0003) cfhtls wide data release. ourresults place tight constraints on the scaling of the amplitude of the matterpower spectrum sigma_8 with the matter density omega_m. spanning 57 squaredegrees to i'_ab = 24.5 over three independent fields, the unprecedentedcontiguous area of this survey permits high signal-to-noise measurements oftwo-point shear statistics from 1 arcmin to 4 degrees. understanding systematicerrors in our analysis is vital in interpreting the results. we thereforedemonstrate the percent-level accuracy of our method using step simulations, ane/b-mode decomposition of the data, and the star-galaxy cross correlationfunction. we also present a thorough analysis of the galaxy redshiftdistribution using redshift data from the cfhtls t0003 deep fields that probethe same spatial regions as the wide fields. we find sigma_8(omega_m/0.25)^0.64= 0.785+-0.043 using the aperture-mass statistic for the full range of angularscales for an assumed flat cosmology, in excellent agreement with wmap3constraints. the largest physical scale probed by our analysis is 85 mpc,assuming a mean redshift of lenses of 0.5 and a lcdm cosmology. this allows forthe first time to constrain cosmology using only cosmic shear measurements inthe linear regime. using only angular scales theta&gt; 85 arcmin, we findsigma_8(omega_m/0.25)_lin^0.53 = 0.837+-0.084, which agree with the resultsfrom our full analysis. combining our results with data from wmap3, we findomega_m=0.248+-0.019 and sigma_8 = 0.771+-0.029.

1301.1863	cfhtlens: higher-order galaxy-mass correlations probed by  galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing	we present the first direct measurement of the galaxy-matter bispectrum as afunction of galaxy luminosity, stellar mass, and sed type. our analysis uses agalaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing technique (g3l), on angular scales between 9arcsec to 50 arcmin, to quantify (i) the excess surface mass density aroundgalaxy pairs (excess mass hereafter) and (ii) the excess shear-shearcorrelations around single galaxies, both of which yield a measure of two typesof galaxy-matter bispectra. we apply our method to the state-of-the-artcanada-france-hawaii telescope lensing survey (cfhtlens), spanning 154 squaredegrees. this survey allows us to detect a significant change of the bispectrawith lens properties. measurements for lens populations with distinct redshiftdistributions become comparable by a newly devised normalisation technique.that will also aid future comparisons to other surveys or simulations. asignificant dependence of the normalised g3l statistics on luminosity within-23&lt;m_r&lt;-18 and stellar mass within 5x10^9 m_sol&lt;m_star&lt;2x10^11 m_sol is found(h=0.73). both bispectra exhibit a stronger signal for more luminous lenses orthose with higher stellar mass (up to a factor 2-3). this is accompanied by asteeper equilateral bispectrum for more luminous or higher stellar mass lensesfor the excess mass. importantly, we find the excess mass to be very sensitiveto galaxy type as recently predicted with semi-analytic galaxy models: luminous(m_r&lt;-21) late-type galaxies show no detectable signal, while all excess massdetected for luminous galaxies seems to be associated with early-type galaxies.we also present the first observational constraints on third-order stochasticgalaxy biasing parameters.

1305.5791	intrinsic galaxy shapes and alignments ii: modelling the intrinsic  alignment contamination of weak lensing surveys	intrinsic galaxy alignments constitute the major astrophysical systematic offorthcoming weak gravitational lensing surveys but also yield unique insightsinto galaxy formation and evolution. we build analytic models for thedistribution of galaxy shapes based on halo properties extracted from themillennium simulation, differentiating between early- and late-type galaxies aswell as central galaxies and satellites. the resulting ellipticity correlationsare investigated for their physical properties and compared to a suite ofcurrent observations. the best-faring model is then used to predict theintrinsic alignment contamination of planned weak lensing surveys. we find thatlate-type galaxy models generally have weak intrinsic ellipticity correlations,marginally increasing towards smaller galaxy separation and higher redshift.the signal for early-type models at fixed halo mass strongly increases by threeorders of magnitude over two decades in galaxy separation, and by one order ofmagnitude from z=0 to z=2. the intrinsic alignment strength also dependsstrongly on halo mass, but not on galaxy luminosity at fixed mass, or galaxynumber density in the environment. we identify models that are in goodagreement with all observational data, except that all models over-predictalignments of faint early-type galaxies. the best model yields an intrinsicalignment contamination of a euclid-like survey between 0.5-10% at z&gt;0.6 and onangular scales larger than a few arcminutes. cutting 20% of red foregroundgalaxies using observer-frame colours can suppress this contamination by up toa factor of two.

1306.2319	the hot and energetic universe: the evolution of galaxy groups and  clusters	major astrophysical questions related to the formation and evolution ofstructures, and more specifically of galaxy groups and clusters, will still beopen in the coming decade and beyond: what is the interplay of galaxy,supermassive black hole, and intergalactic gas evolution in the most massiveobjects in the universe - galaxy groups and clusters? what are the processesdriving the evolution of chemical enrichment of the hot diffuse gas inlarge-scale structures? how and when did the first galaxy groups in theuniverse, massive enough to bind more than 10^7 k gas, form? focussing on theperiod when groups and clusters assembled (0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5), we show that, due to thecontinuum and line emission of this hot intergalactic gas at x-ray wavelengths,athena+, combining high sensitivity with excellent spectral and spatialresolution, will deliver breakthrough observations in view of theaforementioned issues. indeed, the physical and chemical properties of the hotintra-cluster gas, and their evolution across time, are a key to understand theco-evolution of galaxy and supermassive black hole within their environments.

1311.7580	finding halo streams with a pencil-beam survey: new wraps in the  sagittarius stream	we use data from two cfht-megacam photometric pencil-beam surveys in the g'and the r' bands to measure distances to the sagittarius, the palomar 5 and theorphan stream. we show that, using a cross-correlation algorithm to detect theturnoff point of the main sequence, it is possible to overcome the mainlimitation of a two-bands pencil-beam survey, namely the lack of adjacentcontrol-fields that can be used to subtract the foreground and background starsto enhance the signal on the colour-magnitude diagrams (cmds). we describe thecross-correlation algorithm and its implementation. we combine the resultingmain sequence turnoff points with theoretical isochrones to derive photometricdistances to the streams. our results (31 detections on the sagittarius streamand one each for the palomar 5 and the orphan streams) confirm the findings byprevious studies, expand the distance trend for the sagittarius faint southernbranch and, for the first time, trace the sagittarius faint branch of thenorthern-leading arm out to 56 kpc. in addition, they show evidence for newsubstructure: we argue that these detections trace the continuation of thesagittarius northern-leading arm into the southern hemisphere, and find anearby branch of the sagittarius trailing wrap in the northern hemisphere.

1401.6842	3d cosmic shear: cosmology from cfhtlens	this paper presents the first application of 3d cosmic shear to a wide-fieldweak lensing survey. 3d cosmic shear is a technique that analyses weak lensingin three dimensions using a spherical harmonic approach, and does not bin datain the redshift direction. this is applied to cfhtlens, a 154 square degreeimaging survey with a median redshift of 0.7 and an effective number density of11 galaxies per square arcminute usable for weak lensing. to account for surveymasks we apply a 3d pseudo-cl approach on weak lensing data, and to avoiduncertainties in the highly non-linear regime, we separately analyse radialwave numbers k&lt;=1.5h/mpc and k&lt;=5.0h/mpc, and angular wavenumbers l~400-5000.we show how one can recover 2d and tomographic power spectra from the full 3dcosmic shear power spectra and present a measurement of the 2d cosmic shearpower spectrum, and measurements of a set of 2-bin and 6-bin cosmic sheartomographic power spectra; in doing so we find that using the 3d power in thecalculation of such 2d and tomographic power spectra from data naturallyaccounts for a minimum scale in the matter power spectrum. we use 3d cosmicshear to constrain cosmologies with parameters omegam, omegab, sigma8, h, ns,w0, wa. for a non-evolving dark energy equation of state, and assuming a flatcosmology, lensing combined with wmap7 results in h=0.78+/-0.12,omegam=0.252+/-0.079, sigma8=0.88+/-0.23 and w=-1.16+/-0.38 using only scalesk&lt;=1.5h/mpc. we also present results of lensing combined with first year planckresults, where we find no tension with the results from this analysis, but wealso find no significant improvement over the planck results alone. we findevidence of a suppression of power compared to lcdm on small scales 1.5 &lt; k &lt;5.0 h/mpc in the lensing data, which is consistent with predictions of theeffect of baryonic feedback on the matter power spectrum.

0802.2712	resurrecting the red from the dead: optical properties of bcgs in x-ray  luminous clusters	we present measurements of surface brightness and colour profiles for thebrightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) in a sample of 48 x-ray luminous galaxyclusters. these data were obtained as part of the canadian cluster comparisonproject (cccp). the kormendy relation of our bcgs is steeper than that of thelocal ellipticals, suggesting differences in the assembly history of thesetypes of systems. we also find that while most bcgs show monotonic colourgradients consistent with a decrease in metallicity with radius, 25% of thebcgs show colour profiles that turn bluer towards the centre (blue-cores). weinterpret this bluing trend as evidence for recent star formation. the excessblue light leads to a typical offset from the red sequence of 0.5 to 1.0 mag in(g'-r'), thus affecting optical cluster studies that may reject the bcg basedon colour. all of the blue-core bcgs are located within ~10 kpc of the peak inthe cluster x-ray emission. furthermore, virtually all of the bcgs with recentstar formation are in clusters that lie above the lx-tx relation. based onphotometry alone, these findings suggest that central star formation is aubiquitous feature of bcgs in dynamically relaxed cool-core clusters. thisimplies that while agns and other heating mechanisms are effective at temperingcooling, they do not full compensate for the energy lost via radiation.

1405.6208	cycling of the powerful agn in ms 0735.6+7421 and the duty cycle of  radio agn in clusters	we present an analysis of deep chandra x-ray observations of the galaxycluster ms 0735.6+7421, which hosts the most energetic radio agn known. ouranalysis has revealed two cavities in its hot atmosphere with diameters of200-240 kpc. the total cavity enthalpy, mean age, and mean jet power are$9\times 10^{61}$ erg, $1.6\times 10^{8}$ yr, and $1.7\times 10^{46}$ erg/s,respectively. the cavities are surrounded by nearly continuous temperature andsurface brightness discontinuities associated with an elliptical shock front ofmach number 1.26 (1.17-1.30) and age of $1.1\times 10^{8}$ yr. the shock hasinjected at least $4\times 10^{61}$ erg into the hot atmosphere at a rate of$1.1\times 10^{46}$ erg/s. a second pair of cavities and possibly a secondshock front are located along the radio jets, indicating that the agn power hasdeclined by a factor of 30 over the past 100 myr. the multiphase atmospheresurrounding the central galaxy is cooling at a rate of 36 msun/yr, but does notfuel star formation at an appreciable rate. in addition to heating, entrainmentin the radio jet may be depleting the nucleus of fuel and preventing gas fromcondensing out of the intracluster medium. finally, we examine the mean timeintervals between agn outbursts in systems with multiple generations of x-raycavities. we find that, like ms0735, their agn rejuvenate on a timescale thatis approximately 1/3 of their mean central cooling timescales, indicating thatjet heating is outpacing cooling in these systems.

1406.5013	the clustering of baryonic matter. ii: halo model and hydrodynamic  simulations	we recently developed a generalization of the halo model in order to describethe spatial clustering properties of each mass component in the universe,including hot gas and stars. in this work we discuss the complementarity of themodel with respect to a set of cosmological simulations including hydrodynamicsof different kinds. we find that the mass fractions and density profilesmeasured in the simulations do not always succeed in reproducing the simulatedmatter power spectra, the reason being that the latter encode information froma much larger range in masses than that accessible to individually resolvedstructures. in other words, this halo model allows one to extract informationon the growth of structures from the spatial clustering of matter, that iscomplementary with the information coming from the study of individual objects.we also find a number of directions for improvement of the presentimplementation of the model, depending on the specific application one has inmind. the most relevant one is the necessity for a scale dependence of the biasof the diffuse gas component, which will be interesting to test with futuredetections of the warm-hot intergalactic medium. this investigation confirmsthe possibility to gain information on the physics of galaxy and clusterformation by studying the clustering of mass, and our next work will consist ofapplying the halo model to use future high-precision cosmic shear surveys tothis end.

1410.8769	cfhtlens: weak lensing calibrated scaling relations for low mass  clusters of galaxies	we present weak lensing and x-ray analysis of 12 low mass clusters from thecfhtlens and xmm-cfhtls surveys. we combine these systems with high-masssystems from cccp and low-mass systems from cosmos to obtain a sample of 70systems, spanning over two orders of magnitude in mass. we measure core-excisedlx-tx, m-lx and m-tx scaling relations and include corrections forobservational biases. by providing fully bias corrected relations, we give thecurrent limitations for lx and tx as cluster mass proxies. we demonstrate thattx benefits from a significantly lower intrinsic scatter at fixed mass than lx.by studying the residuals of the bias corrected relations, we show for thefirst time using weak lensing masses that galaxy groups seem more luminous andwarmer for their mass than clusters. this implies a steepening of the m-lx andm-tx relations at low masses. we verify the inferred steepening using adifferent high mass sample from the literature and show that variance betweensamples is the dominant effect leading to discrepant scaling relations. wedivide our sample into subsamples of merging and relaxed systems, and find thatmergers may have enhanced scatter in lensing measurements, most likely due tostronger triaxiality and more substructure. for the lx-tx relation, which isunaffected by lensing measurements, we find the opposite trend in scatter. wealso explore the effects of x-ray cross-calibration and find that chandracalibration leads to flatter lx-tx and m-tx relations than xmm-newton.

1412.7521	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave  background by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope	clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the cmb onarcminute scales. measurements of this effect can be used to constrain themasses of galaxy clusters with cmb data alone. here we present a measurement oflensing of the cmb by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope(spt). we develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the cmb clusterlensing signal and validate the method on mock data. we quantify the effects onour analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find thatthey generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. it is estimated thatthis bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of thestatistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upperlimit. we apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected viatheir sz signatures in spt data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensingat $3.1\sigma$. the lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sampleis consistent with that inferred from the sz flux: $m_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =0.83_{-0.37}^{+0.38}\, m_{200,\mathrm{sz}}$ (68% c.l., statistical error only).

1502.04575	cfhtlens: a gaussian likelihood is a sufficient approximation for a  cosmological analysis of third-order cosmic shear statistics	we study the correlations of the shear signal between triplets of sources inthe canada-france-hawaii lensing survey (cfhtlens) to probe cosmologicalparameters via the matter bispectrum. in contrast to previous studies, weadopted a non-gaussian model of the data likelihood which is supported by oursimulations of the survey. we find that for state-of-the-art surveys, similarto cfhtlens, a gaussian likelihood analysis is a reasonable approximation,albeit small differences in the parameter constraints are already visible. forfuture surveys we expect that a gaussian model becomes inaccurate. ouralgorithm for a refined non-gaussian analysis and data compression is then ofgreat utility especially because it is not much more elaborate if simulateddata are available. applying this algorithm to the third-order correlations ofshear alone in a blind analysis, we find a good agreement with the standardcosmological model: $\sigma_8$=$\sigma_8$ $(\omega_{\rmm}/0.27)^{0.64}$=$0.79^{+0.08}_{-0.11}$ for a flat $\lambda\rm cdm$ cosmologywith $h=0.7\pm0.04$ ($68\%$ credible interval). nevertheless our models provideonly moderately good fits as indicated by $\chi^2/{\rm dof}=2.9$, including a$20\%$ r.m.s. uncertainty in the predicted signal amplitude. the models cannotexplain a signal drop on scales around 15 arcmin, which may be caused bysystematics. it is unclear whether the discrepancy can be fully explained byresidual psf systematics of which we find evidence at least on scales of a fewarcmin. therefore we need a better understanding of higher-order correlationsof cosmic shear and their systematics to confidently apply them as cosmologicalprobes.

1511.07884	the regulation of star formation in cool-core clusters: imprints on the  stellar populations of brightest cluster galaxies	a fraction of brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) shows bright emission in theuv and the blue part of the optical spectrum, which has been interpreted asevidence of recent star formation. most of these results are based on theanalysis of broadband photometric data. here, we study the optical spectra of asample of 19 bcgs hosted by x-ray luminous galaxy clusters at 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 0.3, asubset from the canadian cluster comparison project (cccp) sample. we identifyplausible star formation histories of the galaxies by fitting simple stellarpopulations (ssps) as well as composite populations, consisting of a youngstellar component superimposed on an intermediate/old stellar component, toaccurately constrain their star formation histories. we detect prominent young(~200 myr) stellar populations in 4 of the 19 galaxies. of the four, the bcg inabell 1835 shows remarkable a-type stellar features indicating a relativelylarge population of young stars, which is extremely unusual even amongst starforming bcgs. we constrain the mass contribution of these young components tothe total stellar mass to be typically between 1% to 3%, but rising to 7% inabell 1835. we find that the four of the bcgs with strong evidence for recentstar formation (and only these four galaxies) are found within a projecteddistance of 5 kpc of their host cluster's x-ray peak, and the diffuse, x-raygas surrounding the bcgs exhibit a ratio of the radiative cooling-to-free-falltime ($t_{c}/t_{ff}$) of &lt; 10. these are also some of the clusters with thelowest central entropy. our results are consistent with the predictions of theprecipitation-driven star formation and agn feedback model, in which theradiatively cooling diffuse gas is subject to local thermal instabilities oncethe instability parameter $t_{c}/t_{ff}$ falls below ~10, leading to thecondensation and precipitation of cold gas.

0807.2760	evidence for recent star formation in bcgs: a correspondence between  blue cores and uv excess	we present a joint analysis of near-ultraviolet (nuv) data from the galexmission and (optical) colour profiles for a sample of 7 brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) in the canadian cluster comparison project. we find that everybcg which has a blue rest-frame uv colour also shows a blue-core in its opticalcolour profile. conversely, bcgs that lack blue cores and show monotonic colourgradients typical of old elliptical galaxies, are red in the uv. we interpretthis as evidence that the nuv enhancement in the blue bcgs is driven by recentstar formation and not from old evolved stellar populations such as horizontalbranch stars. the recent star formation in the blue bcgs typically has an ageless than 200 myrs and contributes mass fractions of less than a percent.although the sample studied here is small, we demonstrate, for the first time,a one-to-one correspondence between blue cores in elliptical galaxies (inparticular bcgs) and a nuv-enhancement observed using galex. the combination ofthis one-to-one correspondence and the consistently young age of recent starformation, coupled with additional correlations with the host cluster's x-rayproperties, strongly suggests that the star formation is fueled by gas coolingout of the intracluster medium. in turn, this implies that any agn heating ofthe intracluster medium in massive clusters only acts to reduce the magnitudeof the cooling flow and that once this flow starts, it is nearly always active.(abridged)

astro-ph;0001513	strong and weak lensing analysis of cluster abell 2219 based on optical  and near infrared data	we present a gravitational lensing study of the massive galaxy cluster a2219(redshift 0.22). this investigation is based on multicolour images from uthrough h, which allows photometric redshifts to be estimated for thebackground sources. the redshifts provide useful extra information for thelensing models: we show how they can be used to identify a new multiple-imagesystem (and rule out an old one), how this information can be used to anchorthe mass model for the cluster, and how the redshifts can be used to constructoptimal samples of background galaxies for a weak lensing analysis. combiningall results, we obtain the mass distribution in this cluster from the inner,strong lensing region, out to a radius of 1.5 mpc. the mass profile isconsistent with a singular isothermal model over this radius range. parametricand non-parametric reconstructions of the mass distribution in the cluster arecompared. the main features (elongation, sub-clumps, radial mass profile) arein good agreement.

astro-ph;0005581	detection of strong clustering of extremely red objects: implications  for the density of z &gt; 1 ellipticals	we present the results of a wide-field survey for extremely red objects (eroshereafter), the widest so far, based on ks and r band imaging. the surveycovers 701 arcmin^2 and it is 85% complete to ks\leq18.8 over the whole areaand to ks\leq19.2 over 447.5 arcmin^2. thanks to the wide field covered, acomplete sample of about 400 eros with r-ks\geq5 was selected. the distributionof the eros on the sky is strongly inhomogeneous, being characterized byoverdensities and large voids. we detect at the 8 sigma level a strongclustering signal of the eros which is about an order of magnitude larger thanthe clustering of k-selected field galaxies in the same magnitude range. asmooth trend of increasing clustering amplitude with the r-ks color isobserved. these results are strong evidence that the largest fraction of erosis composed of high-z ellipticals, of which we detect for the first time thez\simgt1 large scale structure clustering signal. we show how the surfacedensity variations of the ero population found in our survey can explain thehighly discrepant results obtained so far on the density of z &gt; 1 ellipticals,and we briefly discuss the main implications of our results for the evolutionof elliptical galaxies. the number counts and the colors of the k-selectedfield galaxies are also presented and briefly discussed.

astro-ph;0007286	class b0827+525: `dark lens' or binary radio-loud quasar?	we present radio, optical, near-infrared and spectroscopic observations ofthe source b0827+525. we consider this source as the best candidate from thecosmic lens all-sky survey (class) for a `dark lens' system or binaryradio-loud quasar. the system consists of two radio components with somewhatdifferent spectral indices, separated by 2.815 arcsec. vlba observations showthat each component has substructure on a scale of a few mas. a deep k-bandexposure with the w.m.keck-ii telescope reveals emission near both radiocomponents. the k-band emission of the weaker radio component appears extended,whereas the emission from the brighter radio component is consistent with apoint source. hubble space telescope f160w-band observations with the nicmosinstrument confirms this. a redshift of 2.064 is found for the brightercomponent, using the lris instrument on the w.m.keck-ii telescope. theprobability that b0827+525 consists of two unrelated compact flat-spectrumradio sources is ~3%, although the presence of similar substructure in bothcomponent might reduce this.  we discuss two scenarios to explain this system: (i) class b0827+525 is a`dark lens' system or (ii) b0827+525 is a binary radio-loud quasar. b0827+525has met all criteria that thus far have in 100% of the cases confirmed a sourceas an indisputable gravitational lens system. despite this, no lens galaxy hasbeen detected with m_f160w&lt;=23 mag. hence, we might have found the first binaryradio-loud quasar. at this moment, however, we feel that the `dark lens'hypothesis cannot yet be fully excluded.

astro-ph;0012169	weak lensing study of low mass galaxy groups: implications for omega_m	we report on the first measurement of the average mass and mass-to-lightratio of galaxy groups by analysing the weak lensing signal induced by thesesystems. the groups, which have velocity dispersions of 50-400 km/s, have beenselected from the canadian network for observational cosmology field galaxyredshift survey (cnoc2). this survey allows the identification of a largenumber of groups with redshifts ranging from z=0.12-0.55, ideal for a weaklensing analysis of their mass distribution. for our analysis we use a sampleof 50 groups which are selected on the basis of a careful dynamical analysis ofgroup candidates. we detect a signal at the 99% confidence limit. the best fitsingular isothermal sphere model yields an einstein radius of 0.72+-0.29". thiscorresponds to a velocity dispersion of 274^{+48}_{-59} km/s (using photometricredshift distributions for the source galaxies), which is in good agreementwith the dynamical estimate. under the assumption that the light traces themass, we find an average mass-to-light ratio of 191+-83 h msun/lsun in therestframe b band. unlike dynamical estimates, this result is insensitive toproblems associated with determining group membership. after correction of theobserved mass-to-light ratio for luminosity evolution to z=0, we find 254+-110h msun/lsun, lower than what is found for rich clusters. we use the observedmass-to-light ratio to estimate the matter density of the universe, for whichwe find omega_m=0.19+-0.10 (omega_lambda=0), in good agreement with otherrecent estimates. for a closed universe, we obtain omega_m=0.13+-0.07.

astro-ph;0211633	lensing by galaxies in cnoc2 fields	we have observed two blank fields of approximately 30 by 23 arcminutes usingthe william herschel telescope. the fields have been studied as part of thecnoc2 survey, and spectroscopic redshifts are available for 1125 galaxies inthe two fields. we measured the lensing signal caused by large scale structure,and found that the result is consistent with current, more accuratemeasurements. we study the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal of three overlappingsamples of lenses, and detect a significant signal in all cases. the estimatesfor the velocity dispersion of an l* galaxy agree well for the various samples.the best fit singular isothermal sphere model to the ensemble averagedtangential distortion around the galaxies with redshifts yields a velocitydispersion of \sigma_*=130^{+15}_{-17} km/s, in good agreement with otherstudies. we use a maximum likelihood analysis, where a parameterized mass modelis compared to the data, to study the extent of galaxy dark matter halos.making use of all available data, we find \sigma_*=111\pm12 km/s (68.3%confidence) for a truncated isothermal sphere model in which all galaxies havethe same mass-to-light ratio. the value of the truncation parameter is notconstrained that well, and we find s_*=260^{+124}_{-73} h^{-1} kpc (68.3%confidence the galaxy-galaxy lensing analysis allows us to estimate the averagemass-to-light ratio of the field, which can be used to estimate \omega_m. thecurrent result, however, depends strongly on the assumed scaling relation fors.

astro-ph;0406468	dealing with systematics in cosmic shear studies: new results from the  virmos-descart survey	we present a reanalysis of the virmos-descart weak lensing data, with aparticular focus on different corrections for the variation of the point spreadfunction anisotropy (psf) across the ccds. we show that the small scalesystematics can be minimised, and eventually suppressed, using the b mode(curled shear component)measured in the corrected stars and galaxies. updatedcosmological constraints are obtained, free of systematics caused by psfanisotropy. to facilitate general use of our results, we provide the two-pointsstatistics data points with their covariance matrices up to a scale of onedegree. for the normalisation of the mass power spectrum we obtainsigma_8=(0.83\pm 0.07)(omega_m/0.3)^(-0.49). the shape parameter gamma wasmarginalised over gamma=[0.1,0.3] and the mean source redshift z_s over[0.8,1.0]. the latter is consistent with recent photometric redshifts obtainedfor the virmos data and the preliminary spectroscopic redshifts from thevirmos-vvds survey. the quoted 68% contour level includes all identifiedsources of error. we discuss the possible sources of residual contamination inthis result: the effect of the non-linear mass power spectrum and remainingissues concerning the psf correction. our result is compared with the firstrelease of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data. it is found that colddark matter models with a power law primordial power spectrum and high matterdensity omega_m &gt; 0.5 are excluded at 3-sigma.

astro-ph;0510097	virial masses and the baryon fraction in galaxies	we have measured the weak lensing signal as a function of restframeluminosity for a sample of `isolated' galaxies. these results are based onfour-band photometry from the red-sequence cluster survey, enabling us todetermine photometric redshifts for a large number of galaxies. we select asecure sample of lenses with photometric redshifts 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.4 and study therelation between the virial mass and baryonic contents. in addition, we discussthe implications of the derived photometric redshift distribution for publishedcosmic shear studies. the virial masses are derived from a fit to the observedlensing signal. for a galaxy with a fiducial luminosity of 10^10 h^-2 l_bsun weobtain a mass m_vir=9.9^{+1.5}_{-1.3}\times 10^11 h^-1 m_sun. the virial massas a function of luminosity is consistent with a power-law ~l^1.5, with similarslopes for the three filters considered here. these findings are in excellentagreement with results from the sloan digital sky survey and semi-analyticmodels of galaxy formation. we measure the fraction of mass in stars and thebaryon fraction in galaxies by comparing the virial mass-to-light ratio topredicted stellar mass-to-light ratios. we find that star formation isinefficient in converting baryons into stars, with late-type galaxiesconverting ~33% and early-type galaxies converting only ~14% of baryons intostars. our results imply that the progenitors of early-type galaxies must havelow stellar mass fractions, suggestive of a high formation redshift.

astro-ph;0511089	first cosmic shear results from the canada-france-hawaii telescope wide  synoptic legacy survey	we present the first measurements of the weak gravitational lensing signalinduced by the large scale mass distribution from data obtained as part of theongoing canada-france-hawaii telescope legacy survey (cfhtls). the data used inthis analysis are from the wide synoptic survey, which aims to image ~170square degree in five filters. we have analysed ~22 deg2 (31 pointings) of i'data spread over two of the three survey fields. these data are of excellentquality and the results bode well for the remainder of the survey: we do notdetect a significant `b'-mode, suggesting that residual systematics arenegligible at the current level of accuracy. assuming a cold dark matter modeland marginalising over the hubble parameter h=[0.6,0.8], the source redshiftdistribution and systematics, we constrain sigma_8, the amplitude of the matterpower spectrum. at a fiducial matter density omega_m=0.3 we findsigma_8=0.85+-0.06. this estimate is in excellent agreement with previousstudies. combination of our results with those from the deep component of thecfhtls enables us to place a constraint on a constant equation of state for thedark energy, based on cosmic shear data alone. we find that w_0&lt;-0.8 at 68%confidence.

astro-ph;0511090	cosmic shear analysis with cfhtls deep data	we present the first cosmic shear measurements obtained from the t0001release of the canada-france-hawaii telescope legacy survey. the data setcovers three uncorrelated patches (d1, d3 and d4) of one square degree eachobserved in u*, g', r', i' and z' bands, out to i'=25.5. the depth and themulticolored observations done in deep fields enable several data qualitycontrols. the lensing signal is detected in both r' and i' bands and showssimilar amplitude and slope in both filters. b-modes are found to bestatistically zero at all scales. using multi-color information, we derived aphotometric redshift for each galaxy and separate the sample into medium andhigh-z galaxies. a stronger shear signal is detected from the high-z subsamplethan from the low-z subsample, as expected from weak lensing tomography. whilefurther work is needed to model the effects of errors in the photometricredshifts, this results suggests that it will be possible to obtain constraintson the growth of dark matter fluctuations with lensing wide field surveys. thevarious quality tests and analysis discussed in this work demonstrate thatmegaprime/megacam instrument produces excellent quality data. the combined deepand wide surveys give sigma_8= 0.89 pm 0.06 assuming the peacock &amp; doddsnon-linear scheme and sigma_8=0.86 pm 0.05 for the halo fitting model andomega_m=0.3. we assumed a cold dark matter model with flat geometry.systematics, hubble constant and redshift uncertainties have been marginalizedover. using only data from the deep survey, the 1 sigma upper bound for w_0,the constant equation of state parameter is w_0 &lt; -0.8.

astro-ph;0703372	joint analysis of cluster observations: i. mass profile of abell 478  from combined x-ray, sunyaev-z'eldovich, and weak lensing data	we provide a new framework for the joint analysis of cluster observations(jaco) using simultaneous fits to x-ray, sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz), and weaklensing data. our method fits the mass models simultaneously to all data,provides explicit separation of the gaseous, dark, and stellar components,and--for the first time--allows joint constraints on all measurable physicalparameters. jaco includes additional improvements to previous x-ray techniques,such as the treatment of the cluster termination shock and explicit inclusionof the bcg's stellar mass profile. an application of jaco to the rich galaxycluster abell 478 shows excellent agreement among the x-ray, lensing, and szdata. we find that abell 478 is consistent with a cuspy dark matter profilewith inner slope n=1. accounting for the stellar mass profile of the bcg allowsus to rule out inner dark matter slopes n&gt;1.1 at the 99% confidence level. atlarge radii, an 1/r^3 asymptotic slope is preferred over an 1/r^4 behavior. allsingle power law dark matter models are ruled out at greater than the 99%confidence level. jaco shows that self-consistent modeling of multiwavelengthdata can provide powerful constraints on the shape of the dark profile.

astro-ph;9910487	hubble space telescope weak lensing study of the z=0.83 cluster ms  1054-03	we have measured the weak gravitational lensing signal of ms 1054-03, a richand x-ray luminous cluster of galaxies at a redshift of z=0.83, using atwo-colour mosaic of deep wfpc2 images. the small corrections for the size ofthe psf and the high number density of background galaxies obtained in theseobservations result in an accurate and well calibrated measurement of thelensing induced distortion. the strength of the lensing signal depends on theredshift distribution of the background galaxies. we used photometric redshiftdistributions from the northern and southern hubble deep fields to relate thelensing signal to the mass. the predicted variations of the signal as afunction of apparent source magnitude and colour agrees well with the observedlensing signal. we determine a mass of (1.2+-0.2)x10^15 msun within an apertureof radius 1 mpc. under the assumption of an isothermal mass distribution, thecorresponding velocity dispersion is 1311^{+83}_{-89} km/s. for themass-to-light ratio we find 269+-37 msun/lsun. the errors in the mass andmass-to-light ratio include the contribution from the random intrinsicellipticities of the source galaxies, but not the (systematic) error due to theuncertainty in the redshift distribution. however, the estimates for the massand mass-to-light ratio of ms 1054-03 agree well with other estimators,suggesting that the mass calibration works well. the reconstruction of theprojected mass surface density shows a complex mass distribution, consistentwith the light distribution. the results indicate that ms 1054-03 is a youngsystem. the timescale for relaxation is estimated to be at least 1 gyr.averaging the tangential shear around the cluster galaxies, we find that thevelocity dispersion of an lstar galaxy is 203+-33 km/s.
