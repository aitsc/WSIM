0902.4003	a cross-correlation analysis of mg ii absorption line systems and  luminous red galaxies from the sdss dr5	we analyze the cross-correlation of 2,705 unambiguously intervening mg ii(2796,2803a) quasar absorption line systems with 1,495,604 luminous redgalaxies (lrgs) from the fifth data release of the sloan digital sky surveywithin the redshift range 0.36&lt;=z&lt;=0.8. we confirm with high precision apreviously reported weak anti-correlation of equivalent width and dark matterhalo mass, measuring the average masses to be log m_h(m_[solar]h^-1)=11.29[+0.36,-0.62] and log m_h(m_[solar]h^-1)=12.70 [+0.53,-1.16] for systems withw[2796a]&gt;=1.4a and 0.8a&lt;=w[2796a]&lt;1.4a, respectively. additionally, weinvestigate the significance of a number of potential sources of bias inherentin absorber-lrg cross-correlation measurements, including absorber velocitydistributions and the weak lensing of background quasars, which we determine iscapable of producing a 20-30% bias in angular cross-correlation measurements onscales less than 2'. we measure the mg ii - lrg cross-correlation for 719absorption systems with v&lt;60,000 km s^-1 in the quasar rest frame and find thatthese associated absorbers typically reside in dark matter haloes that are~10-100 times more massive than those hosting unambiguously intervening mg iiabsorbers. furthermore, we find evidence for evolution of the redshift numberdensity, dn/dz, with 2-sigma significance for the strongest (w&gt;2.0a) absorbersin the dr5 sample. this width-dependent dn/dz evolution does not significantlyaffect the recovered equivalent width-halo mass anti-correlation and adds toexisting evidence that the strongest mg ii absorption systems are correlatedwith an evolving population of field galaxies at z&lt;0.8, while the non-evolvingdn/dz of the weakest absorbers more closely resembles that of the lrgpopulation.

1002.1476	evolution of the clustering of photometrically selected sdss galaxies	we measure the angular auto-correlation functions (w) of sdss galaxiesselected to have photometric redshifts 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.4 and absolute r-bandmagnitudes mr &lt; -21.2. we split these galaxies into five overlapping redshiftshells of width 0.1 and measure w in each subsample in order to investigate theevolution of sdss galaxies. we find that the bias increases substantially withredshift - much more so than one would expect for a passively evolving sample.we use halo-model analysis to determine the best-fithalo-occupation-distribution (hod) for each subsample, and the best-fit modelsallow us to interpret the change in bias physically. in order to properlyinterpret our best-fit hods, we convert each halo mass to its z = 0 passivelyevolved bias (bo), enabling a direct comparison of the best-fit hods atdifferent redshifts. we find that the minimum halo bo required to host a galaxydecreases as the redshift decreases, suggesting that galaxies with mr &lt; -21.2are forming in halos at the low-mass end of the hods over our redshift range.we use the best-fit hods to determine the change in occupation number dividedby the change in mass of halos with constant bo and we find a sharp peak at bo~ 0.9 - corresponding to an average halo mass of ~ 10^12msol/h. we thus presentthe following scenario: the bias of galaxies with mr &lt; -21.2 decreases as theuniverse evolves because these galaxies form in halos of mass ~ 10^12msol/h(independent of redshift), and the bias of these halos naturally decreases asthe universe evolves.

1003.0896	the effect of redshift-space distortions on projected 2-pt clustering  measurements	although redshift-space distortions only affect inferred distances and notangles, they still distort the projected angular clustering of galaxy samplesselected using redshift dependent quantities. from an eulerian view-point, thiseffect is caused by the apparent movement of galaxies into or out of thesample. from a lagrangian view-point, we find that projecting theredshift-space overdensity field over a finite radial distance does not removeall the anisotropic distortions. we investigate this effect, showing that itstrongly boosts the amplitude of clustering for narrow samples and can alsoreduce the significance of baryonic features in the correlation function. weargue that the effect can be mitigated by binning in apparent galaxypair-centre rather than galaxy position, and applying an upper limit to theradial galaxy separation. we demonstrate this approach, contrasting againststandard top-hat binning in galaxy distance, using sub-samples taken from thehubble volume simulations. using a simple model for the radial distributionexpected for galaxies from a survey such as the dark energy survey (des), weshow that this binning scheme will simplify analyses that will measure baryonacoustic oscillations within such galaxy samples. comparing results fromdifferent binning schemes has the potential to provide measurements of theamplitude of the redshift-space distortions. our analysis is relevant for otherphotometric redshift surveys, including those made by the panoramic surveytelescope &amp; rapid response system (pan-starrs) and the large synoptic surveytelescope (lsst).

1010.1403	understanding the faint red galaxy population using large-scale  clustering measurements from sdss dr7	we use data from the sdss to investigate the evolution of the large-scalegalaxy bias as a function of luminosity for red galaxies. we carefully considercorrelation functions of galaxies selected from both photometric andspectroscopic data, and cross-correlations between them, to obtain multiplemeasurements of the large-scale bias. we find, for our most robust analyses, astrong increase in bias with luminosity for the most luminous galaxies, anintermediate regime where bias does not evolve strongly over a range of twomagnitudes in galaxy luminosity, and no evidence for an upturn in bias forfainter red galaxies. previous work has found an increase in bias to lowluminosities that has been widely interpreted as being caused by a strongpreference for red dwarf galaxies to be satellites in the most massive halos.we can recover such an upturn in bias to faint luminosities if we push ourmeasurements to small scales, and include galaxy clustering measurements alongthe line-of-sight, where we expect non-linear effects to be the strongest. theresults that we expect to be most robust suggest that the low luminositypopulation of red galaxies is not dominated by satellite galaxies occupying themost massive haloes.

1101.1529	sdss-iii: massive spectroscopic surveys of the distant universe, the  milky way galaxy, and extra-solar planetary systems	building on the legacy of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss-i and ii),sdss-iii is a program of four spectroscopic surveys on three scientific themes:dark energy and cosmological parameters, the history and structure of the milkyway, and the population of giant planets around other stars. in keeping withsdss tradition, sdss-iii will provide regular public releases of all its data,beginning with sdss dr8 (which occurred in jan 2011). this paper presents anoverview of the four sdss-iii surveys. boss will measure redshifts of 1.5million massive galaxies and lya forest spectra of 150,000 quasars, using thebao feature of large scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations ofthe distance scale and hubble expansion rate at z&lt;0.7 and at z~2.5. segue-2,which is now completed, measured medium-resolution (r=1800) optical spectra of118,000 stars in a variety of target categories, probing chemical evolution,stellar kinematics and substructure, and the mass profile of the dark matterhalo from the solar neighborhood to distances of 100 kpc. apogee will obtainhigh-resolution (r~30,000), high signal-to-noise (s/n&gt;100 per resolutionelement), h-band (1.51-1.70 micron) spectra of 10^5 evolved, late-type stars,measuring separate abundances for ~15 elements per star and creating the firsthigh-precision spectroscopic survey of all galactic stellar populations (bulge,bar, disks, halo) with a uniform set of stellar tracers and spectraldiagnostics. marvels will monitor radial velocities of more than 8000 fgk starswith the sensitivity and cadence (10-40 m/s, ~24 visits per star) needed todetect giant planets with periods up to two years, providing an unprecedenteddata set for understanding the formation and dynamical evolution of giantplanet systems.

0704.2573	higher-order angular galaxy correlations in the sdss: redshift and color  dependence of non-linear bias	we present estimates of the n-point galaxy, area-averaged, angularcorrelation functions $\bar{\omega}_{n}$($\theta$) for $n$ = 2,...,7 forgalaxies from the fifth data release of the sloan digital sky survey. ourparent sample is selected from galaxies with $18 \leq r &lt; 21$, and is thelargest ever used to study higher-order correlations. we subdivide this parentsample into two volume limited samples using photometric redshifts, and thesetwo samples are further subdivided by magnitude, redshift, and color (producingearly- and late-type galaxy samples) to determine the dependence of$\bar{\omega}_{n}$($\theta$) on luminosity, redshift, and galaxy-type. wemeasure $\bar{\omega}_{n}$($\theta$) using oversampling techniques and use themto calculate the projected, $s_{n}$. using models derived from theoreticalpower-spectra and perturbation theory, we measure the bias parameters $b_1$ and$c_2$, finding that the large differences in both bias parameters ($b_1$ and$c_2$) between early- and late-type galaxies are robust against changes inredshift, luminosity, and $\sigma_8$, and that both terms are consistentlysmaller for late-type galaxies. by directly comparing their higher-ordercorrelation measurements, we find large differences in the clustering oflate-type galaxies at redshifts lower than 0.3 and those at redshifts higherthan 0.3, both at large scales ($c_2$ is larger by $\sim0.5$ at $z &gt; 0.3$) andsmall scales (large amplitudes are measured at small scales only for $z &gt; 0.3$,suggesting much more merger driven star formation at $z &gt; 0.3$). finally, ourmeasurements of $c_2$ suggest both that $\sigma_8 &lt; 0.8$ and $c_2$ is negative.

1106.3331	the morphology of galaxies in the baryon oscillation spectroscopic  survey	we study the morphology of luminous and massive galaxies at 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.7targeted in the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) using publiclyavailable hubble space telescope imaging from cosmos. our sample (240 objects)provides a unique opportunity to check the visual morphology of these galaxieswhich were targeted based solely on stellar population modelling. we find thatthe majority (74+/-6%) possess an early-type morphology (elliptical or s0),while the remainder have a late-type morphology. this is as expected from thegoals of the boss target selection which aimed to predominantly select slowlyevolving galaxies, for use as cosmological probes, while still obtaining a fairfraction of actively star forming galaxies for galaxy evolution studies. weshow that a colour cut of (g-i)&gt;2.35 selects a sub-sample of boss galaxies with90% early-type morphology - more comparable to the earlier luminous red galaxy(lrg) samples of sdss-i/ii. the remaining 10% of galaxies above this cut have alate-type morphology and may be analogous to the "passive spirals" found atlower redshift. we find that 23+/-4% of the early-type galaxies are unresolvedmultiple systems in the sdss imaging. we estimate that at least 50% of theseare real associations (not projection effects) and may represent a significant"dry merger" fraction. we study the sdss pipeline sizes of boss galaxies whichwe find to be systematically larger (by 40%) than those measured from hstimages, and provide a statistical correction for the difference. these detailsof the boss galaxies will help users of the data fine-tune their selectioncriteria, dependent on their science applications. for example, the main goalof boss is to measure the cosmic distance scale and expansion rate of theuniverse to percent-level precision - a point where systematic effects due tothe details of target selection may become important.

1202.6057	the clustering of galaxies at z~0.5 in the sdss-iii data release 9  boss-cmass sample: a test for the lcdm cosmology	we present results on the clustering of 282,068 galaxies in the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) sample of massive galaxies withredshifts 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.7 which is part of the sloan digital sky survey iii project.our results cover a large range of scales from ~0.5 to ~90 mpc/h. we comparethese estimates with the expectations of the flat lcdm cosmological model withparameters compatible with wmap7 data. we use the multidark cosmologicalsimulation together with a simple halo abundance matching technique, toestimate galaxy correlation functions, power spectra, abundance of subhaloesand galaxy biases. we find that the lcdm model gives a reasonable descriptionto the observed correlation functions at z~0.5, which is a remarkably goodagreement considering that the model, once matched to the observed abundance ofboss galaxies, does not have any free parameters. however, we find a deviation(&gt;~10%) in the correlation functions for scales less than ~1 mpc/h and ~10-40mpc/h. a more realistic abundance matching model and better statistics fromupcoming observations are needed to clarify the situation. we also estimatethat about 12% of the "galaxies" in the abundance-matched sample are satellitesinhabiting central haloes with mass m&gt;~1e14 m_sun/h. using the multidarksimulation we also study the real space halo bias b(r) of the matched cataloguefinding that b=2.00+/-0.07 at large scales, consistent with the one obtainedusing the measured boss projected correlation function. furthermore, the linearlarge-scale bias depends on the number density n of the abundance-matchedsample as b=-0.048-(0.594+/-0.02)*log(n/(h/mpc)^3). extrapolating these resultsto bao scales we measure a scale-dependent damping of the acoustic signalproduced by non-linear evolution that leads to ~2-4% dips at ~3 sigma level forwavenumbers k&gt;~0.1 h/mpc in the linear large-scale bias.

1202.6241	the progenitors of present-day massive red galaxies up to z ~ 0.7 -  finding passive galaxies using sdss-i/ii and sdss-iii	we present a comprehensive study of 250,000 galaxies targeted by the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) up to z ~ 0.7 with the specific goal ofidentifying and characterising a population of galaxies that has evolvedwithout significant merging. we compute a likelihood that each boss galaxy is aprogenitor of the luminous red galaxies (lrgs) sample, targeted by sdss-i/ii upz ~ 0.5, by using the fossil record of lrgs and their inferred star-formationhistories, metallicity histories and dust content. we determine merger rates,luminosity growth rates and the evolution of the large-scale clustering betweenthe two surveys, and we investigate the effect of using different stellarpopulation synthesis models in our conclusions. we demonstrate that our sampleis slowly evolving (of the order of 2 +/- 1.5% per gyr by merging). ourconclusions refer to the bright and massive end of the galaxy population, withmi0.55 &lt; -22, and m* &gt; 1e11.2 msolar, corresponding roughly to 95% and 40% ofthe lrgs and boss galaxy populations, respectively. our analysis further showsthat any possible excess of flux in boss galaxies, when compared to lrgs, frompotentially unresolved targets at z ~ 0.55 must be less than 1% in ther0.55-band (approximately equivalent to the g-band in the rest-frame ofgalaxies at z=0.55). when weighting the boss galaxies based on the predictedproperties of the lrgs, and restricting the analysis to the reddest bossgalaxies, we find an evolution of the large-scale clustering that is consistentwith dynamical passive evolution, assuming a standard cosmology. we concludethat our likelihoods give a weighted sample that is as clean and as close topassive evolution (in dynamical terms, i.e. no or negligible merging) aspossible, and that is optimal for cosmological studies.

1211.3741	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: weighing the neutrino mass using the galaxy power  spectrum of the cmass sample	we measure the sum of the neutrino particle masses using thethree-dimensional galaxy power spectrum of the sdss-iii baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss) data release 9 (dr9) cmass galaxy sample. combinedwith the cosmic microwave background (cmb), supernova (sn) and additionalbaryonic acoustic oscillation (bao) data, we find upper 95 percent confidencelimits of the neutrino mass $\sigma m_{\nu}&lt;0.340$ ev within a flat$\lambda$cdm background, and $\sigma m_{\nu}&lt;0.821$ ev, assuming a more generalbackground cosmological model. the number of neutrino species is measured to be$n_{\rm eff}=4.308\pm0.794$ and $n_{\rm eff}=4.032^{+0.870}_{-0.894}$ for thesetwo cases respectively. we study and quantify the effect of several factors onthe neutrino measurements, including the galaxy power spectrum bias model, theeffect of redshift-space distortion, the cutoff scale of the power spectrum,and the choice of additional data. the impact of neutrinos with unknown masseson other cosmological parameter measurements is investigated. the fractionalmatter density and the hubble parameter are measured to be$\omega_m=0.2796\pm0.0097$, $h_0=69.72^{+0.90}_{-0.91}$ km/s/mpc (flat$\lambda$cdm) and $\omega_m=0.2798^{+0.0132}_{-0.0136}$,$h_0=73.78^{+3.16}_{-3.17}$ km/s/mpc (more general background model). based ona chevallier-polarski-linder (cpl) parametrisation of the equation-of-state $w$of dark energy, we find that $w=-1$ is consistent with observations, evenallowing for neutrinos. similarly, the curvature \omega_k and the running ofthe spectral index $\alpha_s$ are both consistent with zero. thetensor-to-scaler ratio is constrained down to $r&lt;0.198$ (95 percent cl, flat$\lambda$ cdm) and $r&lt;0.440$ (95 percent cl, more general background model).

($5 \pm 21$ at $1\sigma$)when using the most conservative part of our data set, improving previousresults; we also find no evidence for significant kurtosis, parameterized by$g_{\mathrm{nl}}$. in addition to png, we simultaneously constrain dark energyand find that it is required with a form consistent with a cosmologicalconstant.

1309.2954	characterizing unknown systematics in large scale structure surveys	photometric large scale structure (lss) surveys probe the largest volumes inthe universe, but are inevitably limited by systematic uncertainties. imperfectphotometric calibration leads to biases in our measurements of the densityfields of lss tracers such as galaxies and quasars, and as a result incosmological parameter estimation. earlier studies have proposed usingcross-correlations between different redshift slices or cross-correlationsbetween different surveys to reduce the effects of such systematics. in thispaper we develop a method to characterize unknown systematics. we demonstratethat while we do not have sufficient information to correct for unknownsystematics in the data, we can obtain an estimate of their magnitude. wedefine a parameter to estimate contamination from unknown systematics usingcross-correlations between different redshift slices and propose discardingbins in the angular power spectrum that lie outside a certain contaminationtolerance level. we show that this method improves estimates of the bias usingsimulated data and further apply it to photometric luminous red galaxies in thesloan digital sky survey as a case study.

1310.7482	primordial non-gaussianity in the bispectra of large-scale structure	the statistics of large-scale structure in the universe can be used to probenon-gaussianity of the primordial density field, complementary to existingconstraints from the cosmic microwave background. in particular, the scaledependence of halo bias, which affects the halo distribution at large scales,represents a promising tool for analyzing primordial non-gaussianity of localform. future observations, for example, may be able to constrain thetrispectrum parameter gnl that is difficult to study and constrain using thecmb alone. we investigate how galaxy and matter bispectra can distinguishbetween the two non-gaussian parameters fnl and gnl, whose effects give nearlydegenerate contributions to the power spectra. we use a generalization of theunivariate bias approach, making the hypothesis that the number density ofhalos forming at a given position is a function of the local matter densitycontrast and of its local higher-order statistics. using this approach, wecalculate the halo-matter bispectra and analyze their properties. we determinea connection between the sign of the halo bispectrum on large scales and theparameter gnl. we also construct a combination of halo and matter bispectrathat is sensitive to fnl, with little contamination from gnl. we study both thecase of single and multiple sources to the primordial gravitational potential,discussing how to extend the concept of stochastic halo bias to the case ofbispectra. we use a specific halo mass-function to calculate numerically thebispectra in appropriate squeezed limits, confirming our theoretical findings.

1312.4611	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: testing gravity with redshift-space distortions using  the power spectrum multipoles	we analyse the anisotropic clustering of the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) cmass data release 11 (dr11) sample, which consists of $690\,827$galaxies in the redshift range $0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7$ and has a sky coverage of$8\,498\,\text{deg}^2$. we perform our analysis in fourier space using a powerspectrum estimator suggested by yamamoto et al. (2006). we measure themultipole power spectra in a self-consistent manner for the first time in thesense that we provide a proper way to treat the survey window function and theintegral constraint, without the commonly used assumption of an isotropic powerspectrum and without the need to split the survey into sub-regions. the maincosmological signals exploited in our analysis are the baryon acousticoscillations and the signal of redshift space distortions, both of which aredistorted by the alcock-paczynski effect. together, these signals allow us toconstrain the distance ratio $d_v(z_{\rm eff})/r_s(z_d) = 13.89\pm 0.18$, thealcock-paczynski parameter $f_{\rm ap}(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.679\pm0.031$ and thegrowth rate of structure $f(z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.419\pm0.044$at the effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=0.57$. we did not find significantsystematic uncertainties for $d_v/r_s$ or $f_{\rm ap}$ but include a systematicerror for $f\sigma_8$ of $3.1\%$. combining our dataset with planck to testgeneral relativity (gr) through the simple $\gamma$-parameterisation, reveals a$\sim 2\sigma$ tension between the data and the prediction by gr. the tensionbetween our result and gr can be traced back to a tension in the clusteringamplitude $\sigma_8$ between cmass and planck.

1312.4841	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: including covariance matrix errors	we present improved methodology for including covariance matrices in theerror budget of baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) galaxyclustering measurements, revisiting data release 9 (dr9) analyses, anddescribing a method that is used in dr10/11 analyses presented in companionpapers. the precise analysis method adopted is becoming increasingly important,due to the precision that boss can now reach: even using as many as 600 mockcatalogues to estimate covariance of 2-point clustering measurements can stilllead to an increase in the errors of ~20%, depending on how the cosmologicalparameters of interest are measured. in this paper we extend previous work onthis contribution to the error budget, deriving formulae for errors measured byintegrating over the likelihood, and to the distribution of recovered best-fitparameters fitting the simulations also used to estimate the covariance matrix.both are situations that previous analyses of boss have considered. we applythe formulae derived to baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) and redshift-spacedistortion (rsd) measurements from boss in our companion papers. to further aidthese analyses, we consider the optimum number of bins to use for 2-pointmeasurements using the monopole power spectrum or correlation function for bao,and the monopole and quadrupole moments of the correlation function foranisotropic-bao and rsd measurements.

1401.3009	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: modeling of the luminosity and colour dependence in the  data release 10	we investigate the luminosity and colour dependence of clustering of cmassgalaxies in the sloan digital sky survey-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey tenth data release. the halo occupation distribution framework isadopted to model the projected two-point correlation function measurements onsmall and intermediate scales (from $0.02$ to $60\,h^{-1}{\rm {mpc}}$) and tointerpret the observed trends and infer the connection of galaxies to darkmatter halos. we find that luminous red galaxies reside in massive halos ofmass $m{\sim}10^{13}$--$10^{14}\,h^{-1}{\rm m_\odot}$ and more luminousgalaxies are more clustered and hosted by more massive halos. the strongsmall-scale clustering requires a fraction of these galaxies to be satellitesin massive halos, with the fraction at the level of 5--8 per cent anddecreasing with luminosity. the characteristic mass of a halo hosting onaverage one satellite galaxy above a luminosity threshold is about a factor$8.7$ larger than that of a halo hosting a central galaxy above the samethreshold. at a fixed luminosity, progressively redder galaxies are morestrongly clustered on small scales, which can be explained by having a largerfraction of these galaxies in the form of satellites in massive halos. ourclustering measurements on scales below $0.4\,h^{-1}{\rm {mpc}}$ allow us tostudy the small-scale spatial distribution of satellites inside halos. whilethe clustering of luminosity-threshold samples can be well described by anavarro-frenk-white (nfw) profile, that of the reddest galaxies prefers asteeper or more concentrated profile. finally, we also use galaxy samples ofconstant number density at different redshifts to study the evolution ofluminous galaxies, and find the clustering to be consistent with passiveevolution in the redshift range of $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.6$.

1403.4599	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: signs of neutrino mass in current cosmological datasets	we investigate the cosmological implications of the latest growth ofstructure measurement from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)cmass data release 11 with particular focus on the sum of the neutrino masses,$\sum m_{\nu}$. we examine the robustness of the cosmological constraints fromthe baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) scale, the alcock-paczynski effect andredshift-space distortions ($d_v/r_s$, $f_{\rm ap}$, $f\sigma_8$) of\citet{beutler:2013b}, when introducing a neutrino mass in the power spectrumtemplate. we then discuss how the neutrino mass relaxes discrepancies betweenthe cosmic microwave background (cmb) and other low-redshift measurementswithin $\lambda$cdm. combining our cosmological constraints with wmap9 yields$\sum m_{\nu} = 0.36\pm0.14\,$ev ($68\%$ c.l.), which represents a $2.6\sigma$preference for non-zero neutrino mass. the significance can be increased to$3.3\sigma$ when including weak lensing results and other bao constraints,yielding $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.35\pm0.10\,$ev ($68\%$ c.l.). however, combiningcmass with planck data reduces the preference for neutrino mass to $\sim2\sigma$. when removing the cmb lensing effect in the planck temperature powerspectrum (by marginalising over $a_{\rm l}$), we see shifts of $\sim 1\sigma$in $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_m$, which have a significant effect on the neutrinomass constraints. in case of cmass plus planck without the $a_{\rm l}$-lensingsignal, we find a preference for a neutrino mass of $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.34\pm0.14\,$ev ($68\%$ c.l.), in excellent agreement with the wmap9+cmass value. theconstraint can be tightened to $3.4\sigma$ yielding $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.36\pm0.10\,$ev ($68\%$ c.l.) when weak lensing data and other bao constraints areincluded.

1409.3238	the clustering of the sdss main galaxy sample ii: mock galaxy catalogues  and a measurement of the growth of structure from redshift space distortions  at $z=0.15$	we measure redshift-space distortions (rsd) in the two-point correlationfunction of a sample of $63,163$ spectroscopically identified galaxies with $z&lt; 0.2$, an epoch where there are currently only limited measurements, from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 main galaxy sample. our sample,which we denote mgs, covers 6,813 deg$^2$ with an effective redshift$z_{eff}=0.15$ and is described in our companion paper (paper i), whichconcentrates on bao measurements. in order to validate the fitting methods usedin both papers, and derive errors, we create and analyse 1000 mock cataloguesusing a new algorithm called picola to generate accurate dark matter fields.haloes are then selected using a friends-of-friends algorithm, and populatedwith galaxies using a halo-occupation distribution fitted to the data. usingerrors derived from these mocks, we fit a model to the monopole and quadrupolemoments of the mgs correlation function. if we assume no alcock-paczynski (ap)effect (valid at $z=0.15$ for any smooth model of the expansion history), wemeasure the amplitude of the velocity field, $f\sigma_{8}$, at $z=0.15$ to be$0.49_{-0.14}^{+0.15}$. we also measure $f\sigma_{8}$ including the ap effect.this latter measurement can be freely combined with recent cosmic microwavebackground results to constrain the growth index of fluctuations, $\gamma$.assuming a background $\lambda$cdm cosmology and combining with current baryonacoustic oscillation data we find $\gamma = 0.64 \pm 0.09$, which is consistentwith the prediction of general relativity ($\gamma \approx 0.55$), though witha slight preference for higher $\gamma$ and hence models with weakergravitational interactions.

1409.3242	the clustering of the sdss dr7 main galaxy sample i: a 4 per cent  distance measure at z=0.15	we create a sample of spectroscopically identified galaxies with $z &lt; 0.2$from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7, covering 6813 deg$^2$.galaxies are chosen to sample the highest mass haloes, with an effective biasof 1.5, allowing us to construct 1000 mock galaxy catalogs (described in paperii), which we use to estimate statistical errors and test our methods. we usean estimate of the gravitational potential to "reconstruct" the linear densityfluctuations, enhancing the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) signal in themeasured correlation function and power spectrum. fitting to thesemeasurements, we determine $d_{v}(z_{\rm eff}=0.15) = (664\pm25)(r_d/r_{d,{\rmfid}})$ mpc; this is a better than 4 per cent distance measurement. this "fillsthe gap" in bao distance ladder between previously measured local and higherredshift measurements, and affords significant improvement in constraining theproperties of dark energy. combining our measurement with other baomeasurements from boss and 6dfgs galaxy samples provides a 15 per centimprovement in the determination of the equation of state of dark energy andthe value of the hubble parameter at $z=0$ ($h_0$). our measurement is fullyconsistent with the planck results and the $\lambda$cdm concordance cosmology,but increases the tension between planck$+$bao $h_0$ determinations and direct$h_0$ measurements.

1411.1074	cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)  measurements	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energymodels from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) measurementswith cosmic microwave background (cmb) and type ia supernova (sn) data. we takeadvantage of high-precision bao measurements from galaxy clustering and thely-alpha forest (lyaf) in the boss survey of sdss-iii. bao data alone yield ahigh confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the cmbangular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. combining baoand sn data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of$h_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/mpc. this measurement assumes standard pre-recombinationphysics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,so agreement with cmb-based estimates that assume a flat lcdm cosmology is animportant corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. for open lcdm, ourbao+sn+cmb combination yields $\omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature$\omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. when we allow more general forms of evolving darkenergy, the bao+sn+cmb parameter constraints remain consistent with flat lcdm.while the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the lyaf baomeasurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at highredshifts remain consistent with our constraints. expansion history aloneyields an upper limit of 0.56 ev on the summed mass of neutrino species,improving to 0.26 ev if we include planck cmb lensing. standard dark energymodels constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that ishigh compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.

1501.05571	the information content of anisotropic baryon acoustic oscillation scale  measurements	anisotropic measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) featurewithin a galaxy survey enable joint inference about the hubble parameter $h(z)$and angular diameter distance $d_a(z)$. these measurements are typicallyobtained from moments of the measured 2-point clustering statistics, withrespect to the cosine of the angle to the line of sight $\mu$. the position ofthe bao features in each moment depends on a combination of $d_a(z)$ and$h(z)$, and measuring the positions in two or more moments breaks thisparameter degeneracy. we derive analytic formulae for the parametercombinations measured from moments given by legendre polynomials, power lawsand top-hat wedges in $\mu$, showing explicitly what is being measured by eachin real-space for both the correlation function and power spectrum, and inredshift-space for the power spectrum. the large volume covered by moderngalaxy samples means that the correlation function can be well approximated ashaving no correlations at different $\mu$ on the bao scale, and that the errorson this scale are approximately independent of $\mu$. using theseapproximations, we derive the information content of various moments. we showthat measurements made using either the monopole and quadrupole, or themonopole and $\mu^2$ power-law moment, are optimal for anisotropic baomeasurements, in that they contain all of the available information using twomoments, the minimal number required to measure both $h(z)$ and $d_a(z)$. wetest our predictions using 600 mock galaxy samples, matched to the sdss-iiibaryon oscillation spectroscopic survey cmass sample, finding a good match toour analytic predictions. our results should enable the optimal extraction ofinformation from future galaxy surveys such as eboss, desi and euclid.

0804.3325	normalization of the matter power spectrum via higher-order angular  correlations of luminous red galaxies	we present a novel technique to measure $\sigma_8$, by measuring thedependence of the second-order bias of a density field on $\sigma_8$ using twoseparate techniques. each technique employs area-averaged angular correlationfunctions ($\bar{\omega}_n$), one relying on the shape of $\bar{\omega}_2$, theother relying on the amplitude of $s_3$ ($s_3=\bar{\omega}_3/\bar{\omega}_2^2$). we confirm the validity of the method bytesting it on a mock catalog drawn from millennium simulation data and finding$\sigma_8^{measured}- \sigma_8^{true} = -0.002 \pm 0.062$. we create a catalogof photometrically selected lrgs from sdss dr5 and separate it into threedistinct data sets by photometric redshift, with median redshifts of 0.47,0.53, and 0.61. measurements of $c_2$, and $\sigma_8$ are made for each dataset, assuming flat geometry and wmap3 best-fit priors on $\omega_m$, $h$, and$\gamma$. we find, with increasing redshfit, $c_2 = 0.09 \pm 0.04$, $0.09 \pm0.05$, and $0.09 \pm 0.03$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.78 \pm 0.08$, $0.80 \pm 0.09$, and$0.80 \pm 0.09$. we combine these three consistent $\sigma_8$ measurements toproduce the result $\sigma_8 = 0.79 \pm 0.05$. allowing the parameters$\omega_m$, $h$, and $\gamma$ to vary within their wmap3 1$\sigma$ error, wefind that the best-fit $\sigma_8$ does not change by more than 8% and we arethus confident our measurement is accurate to within 10%. we anticipate thatfuture surveys, such as pan-starrs, des, and lsst, will be able to employ thismethod to measure $\sigma_8$ to great precision, and will serve as an importantcheck, complementary, on the values determined via more established methods.

1504.00324	non-local bias in the halo bispectrum with primordial non-gaussianity	primordial non-gaussianity can lead to a scale-dependent bias in the densityof collapsed halos relative to the underlying matter density. the galaxy powerspectrum already provides constraints on local-type primordial non-gaussianitycomplementary those from the cosmic microwave background (cmb), while thebispectrum contains additional shape information and has the potential tooutperform cmb constraints in future. we develop the bias model for the halodensity contrast in the presence of local-type primordial non-gaussianity,deriving a bivariate expansion up to second order in terms of the local linearmatter density contrast and the local gravitational potential in lagrangiancoordinates. non-linear evolution of the matter density introduces a non-localtidal term in the halo model. furthermore, the presence of local-typenon-gaussianity in the lagrangian frame leads to a novel non-local convectiveterm in the eulerian frame, that is proportional to the displacement field whengoing beyond the spherical collapse approximation. we use an extendedpress-schechter approach to evaluate the halo mass function and thus the halobispectrum. we show that including these non-local terms in the halo bispectracan lead to corrections of up to $25\%$ for some configurations, on largescales or at high redshift.
