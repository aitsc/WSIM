0905.1946	an accurate position for hdf 850.1: the brightest submillimeter source  in the hubble deep field-north	we report a highly significant submillimeter array (sma) detection of theprototypical submillimeter source hdf 850.1, which is the brightestsubmillimeter source in the hubble deep field-north proper. the detectionyields an extremely precise position of ra(2000)=12:36:51.99 anddec(2000)=+62:12:25.83 with a 1-sigma positional uncertainty of 0.17 arcsec.the position is consistent with the location of a millimeter wavelengthinterferometric detection and with the locations of weak vla detections at 1.4and 8.4 ghz, but it is not consistent with any previous optical/near-infraredidentifications. the source appears pointlike at the 2 arcsec resolution of thesma, and the detected flux of 7.8+/-1.0 mjy is consistent with the measuredscuba fluxes. we tabulate fluxes and limits on hdf 850.1 at other wavelengths.our redshift estimate for hdf 850.1 based on the radio through mid-infraredmeasurements is z=4.1. the faintness of the source at optical/near-infraredwavelengths and the high estimated redshift suggest that hdf 850.1 may be ananalog of the brighter submillimeter source goods 850-5, which is also thoughtto be at z&gt;4. the fact that a source like hdf 850.1 should have appeared in oneof the very first blank-field scuba observations ever made suggests that suchhigh-redshift sources are quite common. thus, we are led to conclude thathigh-redshift star formation is dominated by giant dusty star-forming galaxies,just as it is at lower redshifts.

0908.0002	the optx project iii: x-ray versus optical spectral type for agns	we compare the optical spectral types with the x-ray spectral properties fora uniformly selected (sources with fluxes greater than the 3 sigma level andabove a flux limit of f_2-8 kev &gt; 3.5x10^-15 erg/cm2/s), highlyspectroscopically complete (&gt;80% for f_2-8 kev &gt; 10^-14 erg/cm2/s and &gt;60%below) 2-8 kev x-ray sample observed in three chandra fields (clans, clasxs,and the cdf-n) that cover ~1.2 deg^2. for our sample of 645 spectroscopicallyobserved sources, we confirm that there is significant overlap of the x-rayspectral properties, as determined by the effective photon indices, geff,obtained from the ratios of the 0.5-2 kev to 2-8 kev counts, for the differentoptical spectral types. for example, of the broad-line agns (non-broad-lineagns), 20% +/- 3% (33% +/- 4%) have geff&lt;1.2 (geff &gt; 1.2). thus, one cannot usethe x-ray spectral classifications and the optical spectral classificationsequivalently. since it is not understood how x-ray and optical classificationsrelate to the obscuration of the central engine, we strongly advise against amixed classification scheme, as it can only complicate the interpretation ofx-ray agn samples. we confirm the dependence of optical spectral type on x-rayluminosity, and for z&lt;1, we find a similar luminosity dependence of geff.however, this dependence breaks down at higher redshifts due to the highlyredshift-dependent nature of geff. we therefore also caution that anyclassification scheme which depends on geff is likely to suffer from seriousredshift bias.

0909.0031	low-redshift ly-alpha selected galaxies from galex spectroscopy: a  comparison with both uv-continuum selected galaxies and high-redshift  ly-alpha emitters	we construct a sample of low-redshift ly-alpha emission-line selected sourcesfrom galex grism spectroscopy of nine deep fields to study the role of ly-alphaemission in galaxy populations with cosmic time. our final sample consists of119 (141) sources selected in the redshift interval z=0.195-0.44 (z=0.65-1.25)from the fuv (nuv) channel. we classify the ly-alpha sources as agns ifhigh-ionization emission lines are present in their uv spectra and as possiblestar-forming galaxies otherwise. we classify additional sources as agns usingline widths for our ly-alpha emitter (lae) analysis. these classifications arebroadly supported by comparisons with x-ray and optical spectroscopicobservations. defining the galex lae sample in the same way as high-redshiftlae samples, we show that laes constitute only about 5% of nuv-continuumselected galaxies at z~0.3. we also show that they are less common at z~0.3than they are at z~3. we find that the z~0.3 optically-confirmed ly-alphagalaxies lie below the metallicity-luminosity relation of the z~0.3nuv-continuum selected galaxies but have similar h-alpha velocity widths atsimilar luminosities, suggesting that they also lie below the metallicity-massrelation of the nuv-continuum selected galaxies. we show that, on average, thely-alpha galaxies have bluer colors, lower extinctions as measured from thebalmer line ratios, and more compact morphologies than the nuv-continuumselected galaxies. finally, we confirm that the z~2 lyman break galaxies (lbgs)have relatively low metallicities for their luminosities, and we find that theylie in the same metallicity range as the z~0.3 ly-alpha galaxies.

0912.3090	an extremely deep wide-field near-infrared survey: bright galaxy counts  and local large scale structure	we present a deep, wide-field near-infrared (nir) survey over five widelyseparated fields at high galactic latitude covering a total of ~ 3 deg^2 in j,h, and ks. the deepest areas of the data (~ 0.25 deg^2) extend to a 5 sigmalimiting magnitude of jhks &gt; 24 in the ab magnitude system. although depth andarea vary from field to field, the overall depth and large area of this datasetmake it one of the deepest wide-field nir imaging surveys to date. this paperdiscusses the observations, data reduction, and bright galaxy counts in thesefields. we compare the slope of the bright galaxy counts with the two micronall sky survey (2mass) and other counts from the literature and explore therelationship between slope and supergalactic latitude. the slope near thesupergalactic equator is sub- euclidean on average pointing to the possibilityof a decreasing average space density of galaxies by ~ 10-15% over scales of ~250-350 mpc. on the contrary, the slope at high supergalactic latitudes isstrongly super-euclidean on average suggesting an increase in the space densityof galaxies as one moves from the voids just above and below the supergalacticplane out to distances of ~ 250-350 mpc. these results suggest that local largescale structure could be responsible for large discrepancies in the measuredslope between different studies in the past. in addition, the local universeaway from the supergalactic plane appears to be underdense by ~ 25-100%relative to the space densities of a few hundred megaparsecs distant. subjectheadings: cosmology: observations and large scale structure ofuniverse-galaxies: fundamental parameters (counts)-infrared: galaxies

1006.5713	active galactic nuclei selected from galex spectroscopy: the ionizing  source spectrum at z~1	we use a complete sample of lya emission-line selected agns obtained fromnine deep blank fields observed with the grism spectrographs on the galaxyevolution explorer (galex) satellite to measure the normalization and spectralshape of the agn contribution to the ionizing background (rest-framewavelengths 700-900 a) at z~1. our sample consists of 139 sources selected inthe redshift range z=0.65-1.25 in the near-ultraviolet (nuv; 2371 a centralwavelength) channel. the area covered is 8.2 square degrees to a nuv magnitudeof 20.5 (ab) and 0.92 square degrees at the faintest magnitude limit of 21.8.the galex agn luminosity function agrees well with those obtained using opticaland x-ray agn samples, and the measured redshift evolution of the ionizingvolume emissivity is similar to that previously obtained by measuring the galexfar-ultraviolet (fuv; 1528 a central wavelength) magnitudes of an x-rayselected sample. for the first time we are able to construct the shape of theionizing background at z~1 in a fully self-consistent way.

1008.1582	the optx project iv: how reliable is [oiii] as a measure of agn  activity?	we compare optical and hard x-ray identifications of agns using a uniformlyselected (above a flux limit of f_2-8 kev = 3.5e-15 erg/cm2/s) and highlyoptically spectroscopically complete ( &gt; 80% for f_2-8 kev &gt; 1e-14 erg/cm2/sand &gt; 60% below) 2-8 kev sample observed in three chandra fields (clans,clasxs, and the cdf-n). we find that empirical emission-line ratio diagnosticdiagrams misidentify 20-50% of the x-ray selected agns that can be put on thesediagrams as star formers, depending on which division is used. we confirm thatthere is a large (2 orders in magnitude) dispersion in the log ratio of the[oiii]5007a to hard x-ray luminosities for the non-broad line agns, even afterapplying reddening corrections to the [oiii] luminosities. we find that thedispersion is similar for the broad-line agns, where there is not expected tobe much x-ray absorption from an obscuring torus around the agn nor muchobscuration from the galaxy along the line-of-sight if the agn is aligned withthe galaxy. we postulate that the x-ray selected agns that are misidentified bythe diagnostic diagrams have low [oiii] luminosities due to the complexity ofthe structure of the narrow-line region, which causes many ionizing photonsfrom the agn not to be absorbed. this would mean that the [oiii] luminosity canonly be used to predict the x-ray luminosity to within a factor of ~3 (onesigma). despite selection effects, we show that the shapes and normalizationsof the [oiii] and transformed hard x-ray luminosity functions show reasonableagreement, suggesting that the [oiii] samples are not finding substantiallymore agns at low redshifts than hard x-ray samples.

1110.0008	the optx project v: identifying distant agns	the baldwin, phillips, and terlevich emission-line ratio diagnostic([oiii]/h{\beta} versus [nii]/h{\alpha}, hereafter bpt diagram) efficientlyseparates galaxies whose signal is dominated by star formation &lt;bpt-sf&gt; fromthose dominated by agn activity (bpt-agn). yet this bpt diagram is limited to z&lt; 0.5, the redshift at which [nii]{\lambda}6584 leaves the optical spectralwindow. using the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), we construct a newdiagnostic, or tbt diagram, that is based on rest-frame g-z color,[neiii]{\lambda}3869, and [oii]{\lambda}{\lambda}3726 + 3729 and can be usedfor galaxies out to z &lt; 1.4. the tbt diagram identifies 98.7% of the sdssbpt-agn as tbt-agn and 97% of the sdss bpt-sf as tbt-sf. furthermore, itidentifies 97% of the optx chandra x-ray selected agns as tbt-agn. this is incontrast to the bpt diagram, which misidentifies 20% of x-ray selected agns asbpt-sf. we use the goods-n and lockman hole galaxy samples, with theiraccompanying deep chandra imaging, to perform x-ray and infrared stackinganalyses to further validate our tbt-agn and tbt-sf selections; that is, weverify the dominance of agn activity in the former and star formation activityin the latter. finally, we address the inclusion of the majority of thebpt-comp (sources lying between the bpt-sf and bpt-agn regimes) in our tbt-agnregime. we find that the stacked bpt-comp source is x-ray hard (&lt;{\gamma}eff&gt; =1.0 +/-0.4) and has a high x-ray luminosity to total infrared luminosity ratio.this suggests that, on average, the x-ray signal in bpt-comp is dominated byobscured or low accretion rate agn activity rather than by star formation,supporting their inclusion in the tbt-agn regime.

1110.3326	the faintest x-ray sources from z=0-8	we use the new 4 ms exposure of the cdf-s field obtained with the chandrax-ray satellite to investigate the properties of the faintest x-ray sourcesover a wide range of redshifts. we use an optimized averaging procedure toinvestigate the weighted mean x-ray fluxes of optically selected sources in thecdf-s over the redshift range z=0-8 and down to 0.5-2 kev fluxes as low as5e-19 erg/cm^2/s. none of the samples of sources at high redshifts (z&gt;5) showany significant flux, and at z=6.5 we place an upper limit on the x-rayluminosity of 4e41 erg/s in the rest-frame 3.75-15 kev band for the sample ofbouwens et al. (2006). this is consistent with any x-ray production in thegalaxies being solely due to star formation. at lower redshifts we findsignificant weighted mean x-ray fluxes in many samples of sources over theredshift range z=0-4. we use these to argue that (1) the relation between starformation and x-ray production remains invariant over this redshift range, (2)x-ray sources below the direct detection threshold in the cdf-s are primarilystar-forming, and (3) there is full consistency between uv and x-rayestimations of the star formation history.

1207.1588	testing for a large local void by investigating the near-infrared galaxy  luminosity function	recent cosmological modeling efforts have shown that a local underdensity onscales of a few hundred mpc (out to z ~ 0.1), could produce the apparentacceleration of the expansion of the universe observed via type ia supernovae.several studies of galaxy counts in the near-infrared (nir) have found that thelocal universe appears under-dense by ~25-50% compared with regions a fewhundred mpc distant. galaxy counts at low redshifts sample primarily l ~ l*galaxies. thus, if the local universe is under-dense, then the normalization ofthe nir galaxy luminosity function (lf) at z&gt;0.1 should be higher than thatmeasured for z&lt;0.1. here we present a highly complete (&gt; 90%) spectroscopicsample of 1436 galaxies selected in the h-band to study the normalization ofthe nir lf at 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.3 and address the question of whether or not we reside ina large local underdensity. we find that for the combination of our six fields,the product phi* l* at 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.3 is ~ 30% higher than that measured atlower redshifts. while our statistical errors in this measurement are on the~10% level, we find the systematics due to cosmic variance may be larger still.we investigate the effects of cosmic variance on our measurement using thecosmos cone mock catalogs from the millennium simulation and recent empiricalestimates. we find that our survey is subject to systematic uncertainties dueto cosmic variance at the 15% level ($1 sigma), representing an improvement bya factor of ~ 2 over previous studies in this redshift range. we conclude thatobservations cannot yet rule out the possibility that the local universe isunder-dense at z&lt;0.1.

0806.3457	an integrated picture of star formation, metallicity evolution, and  galactic stellar mass assembly	we present an integrated study of star formation and galactic stellar massassembly from z=0.05-1.5 and galactic metallicity evolution from z=0.05-0.9using a very large and highly spectroscopically complete sample selected byrest-frame nir bolometric flux in the goods-n. we assume a salpeter imf and fitbruzual &amp; charlot (2003) models to compute the galactic stellar masses andextinctions. we determine the expected formed stellar mass density growth ratesproduced by star formation and compare them with the growth rates measured fromthe formed stellar mass functions by mass interval. we show that the growthrates match if the imf is slightly increased from the salpeter imf atintermediate masses (~10 solar masses). we investigate the evolution of galaxycolor, spectral type, and morphology with mass and redshift and the evolutionof mass with environment. we find that applying extinction corrections iscritical when analyzing galaxy colors; e.g., nearly all of the galaxies in thegreen valley are 24um sources, but after correcting for extinction, the bulk ofthe 24um sources lie in the blue cloud. we find an evolution of themetallicity-mass relation corresponding to a decrease of 0.21+/-0.03 dexbetween the local value and the value at z=0.77 in the 1e10-1e11 solar massrange. we use the metallicity evolution to estimate the gas mass of thegalaxies, which we compare with the galactic stellar mass assembly and starformation histories. overall, our measurements are consistent with a galaxyevolution process dominated by episodic bursts of star formation and where starformation in the most massive galaxies (&gt;1e11 solar masses) ceases at z&lt;1.5because of gas starvation.

astro-ph;0001096	mapping the evolution of high redshift dusty galaxies with submillimeter  observations of a radio-selected sample	direct submm imaging has recently revealed the 850-micron background to bemostly composed of a population of distant ultraluminous infrared galaxies, butidentifying the optical/nir counterparts to these sources has proved difficultdue to the poor submm spatial resolution. however, the proportionality of bothcm and submm data to the star formation rate suggests that high resolutionradio continuum maps with subarcsecond positional accuracy can be exploited tolocate submm sources. in this paper we present results from a targeted scubasurvey of micro-jansky radio sources in the flanking fields of the hubble deepfield. even with relatively shallow 850-micron scuba observations (&gt;6 mjy at3-sigma), we were successful at making submm detections of optical/nir-faint(i&gt;24 and k~21-22) radio sources, and our counts closely match the brightcounts from submm surveys. redshift estimates can be made from the ratio of thesubmm flux to the radio flux across the 100 ghz break in the spectral energydistribution. this millimetric redshift estimation places the bright submmpopulation at z=1-3 where it forms the high redshift tail of the faint radiopopulation. the star formation rate density (sfrd) due to ultraluminousinfrared galaxies increases by more than two orders of magnitude from z~0 toz~1-3. the sfrd at high redshift inferred from our &gt;6 mjy submm observations iscomparable to that observed in the uv/optical.

astro-ph;0410527	the cosmic evolution of hard x-ray selected active galactic nuclei	we use highly spectroscopically complete deep and wide-area chandra surveysto determine the cosmic evolution of hard x-ray-selected agns. we determinehard x-ray luminosity functions (hxlfs) for all spectral types and forbroad-line agns (blagns) alone. at z&lt;1.2, both are well described by pureluminosity evolution. thus, all agns drop in luminosity by almost an order ofmagnitude over this redshift range. we show that this observed drop is due toagn downsizing. we directly compare our blagn hxlfs with the optical qso lfsand find that the optical qso lfs do not probe faint enough to see the downturnin the blagn hxlfs. we rule out galaxy dilution as a partial explanation forthe observation that blagns dominate the number densities at the higher x-rayluminosities, while optically-narrow agns (fwhm&lt;2000 km/s) dominate at thelower x-ray luminosities by measuring the nuclear uv/optical properties of thechandra sources using the hst acs goods-north data. the uv/optical nuclei ofthe optically-narrow agns are much weaker than expected if they were similar tothe blagns. we therefore postulate the need for a luminosity dependent unifiedmodel. alternatively, the blagns and the optically-narrow agns could beintrinsically different source populations. we cover both interpretations byconstructing composite spectral energy distributions--including long-wavelengthdata from the mir to the submillimeter--by spectral type and by x-rayluminosity. we use these to infer the bolometric corrections (from hard x-rayluminosities to bolometric luminosities) needed to map the accretion history.we determine the accreted supermassive black hole mass density for all spectraltypes and for blagns alone using the observed evolution of the hard x-rayenergy density production rate and our inferred bolometric corrections.

astro-ph;0512347	a near-infrared analysis of the submillimeter background and the cosmic  star-formation history	we use new deep near-infrared (nir) and mid-infrared (mir) observations toanalyze the 850$~\mu$m image of the goods hdf-n region. we show that much ofthe submillimeter background at this wavelength is picked out by sources with$h(ab)$ or 3.6um (ab)&lt;23.25 (1.8 ujy). these sources contribute an 850umbackground of 24\pm2 jy deg^-2. this is a much higher fraction of the measuredbackground (31-45 jy deg^-2) than is found with current 20cm or 24um samples.roughly one-half of these nir-selected sources have spectroscopicidentifications, and we can assign robust photometric redshifts to nearly allof the remaining sources using their uv to mir spectral energy distributions.we use the redshift and spectral type information to show that a large fractionof the 850um background light comes from sources with z=0-1.5 and that thesources responsible have intermediate spectral types. neither the ellipticalgalaxies, which have no star formation, nor the bluest galaxies, which havelittle dust, contribute a significant amount of 850um light, despite the factthat together they comprise approximately half of the galaxies in the sample.the galaxies with intermediate spectral types have a mean flux of 0.40\pm0.03mjy at 850um and 9.1\pm0.3 ujy at 20cm.  the redshift distribution of the nir-selected 850um light lies well belowthat of the much smaller amount of light traced by the more luminous, radio-selected submillimeter sources. we therefore require a revised star-formationhistory with a lower star-formation rate at high redshifts. we use a stackinganalysis of the 20cm light in the nir sample to show that the star-formationhistory of the total 850um sample is relatively flat down to z~1 and that halfof the total star formation occurs at redshifts z&lt;1.4.

astro-ph;0603689	hst and spitzer observations of the host galaxy of grb 050904: a  metal-enriched, dusty starburst at z=6.295	we present deep hubble space telescope and spitzer space telescopeobservations of the host galaxy of grb 050904 at z=6.295. the host is detectedin the h-band and marginally at 3.6 micron. from these detections, and limitsin the z'-band and 4.5 micron, we infer an extinction-corrected absolutemagnitude, m(uv)=-20.7 mag, or ~l*, a substantial star formation rate of 15solar masses per year, and a stellar mass of a few 10^9 solar masses. acomparison to the published sample of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies atz&gt;5.5 reveals that the host of grb 050904 would evade detection and/orconfirmation in any of the current surveys due to the lack of detectablely-alpha emission, which is likely the result of dust extinction (a[1200]~1.5mag). this suggests that not all luminous starburst galaxies at z~6 arecurrently being accounted for. most importantly, using the metallicity ofz~0.05 solar inferred from the afterglow absorption spectrum, our observationsindicate for the first time that the observed evolution in the mass- andluminosity-metallicity relations from z=0 to z~2 continues on to z&gt;6. the easeof measuring redshifts and metallicities from the afterglow emission suggeststhat in tandem with the next generation ground- and space-based telescopes, agrb mission with dedicated near-ir follow-up can provide unique information onthe evolution of stars and galaxies through the epoch of re-ionization.

astro-ph;9509157	the life-cycle of star formation in distant clusters	we analyse the detailed distribution of star-forming and post-starburstmembers in three distant (z = 0.31) galaxy clusters in terms of evolutionarysequences that incorporate secondary bursts of star formation on pre-existingstellar populations. using the number density of spectroscopically-confirmedmembers on the ew(h\delta) versus b-r plane from existing data, and for alarger k'-limited sample on the u-i versus i-k' plane from newly-acquiredinfrared images, we demonstrate that the proportion of cluster membersundergoing secondary bursts of star formation during the last ~2 gyr prior tothe epoch of observation is probably as high as 30 per cent of the membergalaxies. a key observation leading to this conclusion is the high proportionof h\delta strong galaxies in all three clusters. the evolutionary modelling,whilst necessarily approximate, returns the correct proportions of galaxies invarious stages of the star formation cycle both in terms of spectral and colourproperties. hst images for the three clusters indicate a high proportion of theactive members show signs of interaction, whereas the h\delta strong galaxiesappear mainly to be regular spheroidals. we examine results from recent mergersimulations in the context of the populations in these clusters and confirmthat the merging of individual galaxies, triggered perhaps by the hierarchicalassembly of rich clusters at this epoch, is consistent with the star formationcycle identified in our data. the implications of such a high fraction ofactive objects in cluster cores is briefly discussed.

astro-ph;9802245	evolution of the colour-magnitude relation of early-type galaxies in  distant clusters	we present a thorough quantitative analysis of the evolution of thecolour-magnitude relation for early-type galaxies in 17 distant clusters withredshifts 0.31 &lt; z &lt; 1.27 using the kodama &amp; arimoto (1997) evolutionary modelfor elliptical galaxies. the model is calibrated to reproduce the colour-magnitude relation for coma ellipticals at z ~ 0 and gives the evolution of theslope and zero-point as a function of redshift. we find no significantdifferences between the colour-magnitude relations of the clusters in oursample. the slopes can be reproduced by a single model sequence in which allelliptical galaxies are assumed to be equally old (the maximum age differenceallowed for the brightest 3 magnitudes is only 1 gyr) and to have mean stellarmetallicities which vary as a function of galaxy luminosity. the zero-points ofthe colour-magnitude relations constrain the epoch of major star formation inearly-type galaxies to z_f&gt;2-4. this study provides two important constraintsfor any model of the formation of rich clusters: the uniformity of the ages ofthe stellar populations in the early-type galaxies and the universality of themetallicity sequence of these galaxies as a function of galaxy mass.

astro-ph;9806317	dusty star forming galaxies at high redshift	the global star formation rate in high redshift galaxies, based on opticalsurveys, shows a strong peak at a redshift of z=1.5, which implies that we havealready seen most of the formation. high redshift galaxies may, however, emitmost of their energy at submillimeter wavelengths if they contain substantialamounts of dust. the dust would absorb the starlight and reradiate it asfar-infrared light, which would be redshifted to the submillimeter range. herewe report a deep survey of two blank regions of sky performed at submillimeterwavelengths (450 and 850-micron). if the sources we detect in the 850-micronband are powered by star formation, then each must be converting more than 100solar masses of gas per year into stars, which is larger than the maximum starformation rates inferred for most optically-selected galaxies. the total amountof high redshift star formation is essentially fixed by the level of backgroundlight, but where the peak occurs in redshift for the submillimeter is not yetestablished. however, the background light contribution from only the sourcesdetected at 850-micron is already comparable to that from theoptically-selected sources. establishing the main epoch of star formation willtherefore require a combination of optical and submillimeter studies.

astro-ph;9811465	optical-infrared colour distribution of a statistically-complete sample  of faint field spheroidal galaxies	in hierarchical models, where spheroidals are primarily produced via themerger of disk galaxies, the number of intrinsically red systems at faintlimits will be substantially lower than that expected in "traditional" modelswhere the bulk of star formation was completed at high redshifts. we analysethe optical--near-infrared colour distribution of a large flux-limited sampleof field spheroidal galaxies identified morphologically from archival hubblespace telescope data. the $i_{814}-hk'$ colour distribution for a samplejointly limited at $i_{814}&lt;$23 mag and $hk'&lt;$19.5 mag is used to constrain thestar formation history of elliptical and s0 galaxies. we detect a significantdeficit of intrinsically red spheroids. from limited spectroscopic and deeperphotometric redshift data, we demonstrate that this deficit results from astrong evolutionary effect. the space density of spheroidals of all colours atfaint limits is lower than expected for a population of constant comovingdensity. we conclude that field ellipticals cannot have formed all of theirstars at high redshift, as has been suggested for the bulk of their clusteredcounterparts. we compare alternative evolutionary histories with our data,including an analytical representation of recent models based on thehierarchical assembly of ellipticals, which provides a better, though not idealfit. the accumulation of spectroscopic redshifts for our sample will allow aquantitative discrimination between models with extended star formation.

astro-ph;9904126	resolving the submillimeter background: the 850-micron galaxy counts	recent deep blank field submillimeter surveys have revealed a population ofluminous high redshift galaxies that emit most of their energy in thesubmillimeter. the results suggest that much of the star formation at highredshift may be hidden to optical observations. in this paper we presentwide-area 850-micron scuba data on the hawaii survey fields ssa13, ssa17, andssa22. combining these new data with our previous deep field data, we establishthe 850-micron galaxy counts from 2 mjy to 10 mjy with a &gt;3-sigma detectionlimit. the area coverage is 104 square arcmin to 8 mjy and 7.7 square arcmin to2.3 mjy. the differential 850-micron counts are well described by the functionn(s)=n_0/(a+s^3.2), where s is the flux in mjy, n_0=3.0 x 10^4 per squaredegree per mjy, and a=0.4-1.0 is chosen to match the 850-micron extragalacticbackground light. between 20 to 30 per cent of the 850-micron backgroundresides in sources brighter than 2 mjy. using an empirical fit to our &gt;2 mjydata constrained by the ebl at lower fluxes, we argue that the bulk of the850-micron extragalactic background light resides in sources with fluxes near 1mjy. the submillimeter sources are plausible progenitors of the present-dayspheroidal population.

astro-ph;9905246	the discovery of ero counterparts to faint submm galaxies	we use deep ground-based imaging in the near-ir to search for counterparts tothe luminous submm sources in the catalog of smail et al (1998). for themajority of the submm sources the near-ir imaging supports the counterpartsoriginally selected from deep optical images. however, in two cases (10% of thesample) we find a relatively bright near-ir source close to the submm position,sources that were unidentified in the deep hst and ground-based r-band imagesused in smail et al (1998). we place limits on colours of these sources fromdeep high-resolution keck ii imaging and find they have 2-sigma limits of(i-k)&gt;6.8 and (i-k)&gt;6.0 respectively. both sources thus class as eros. usingthe spectral properties of the submm source in the radio and submm we arguethat these eros are probably the source of the submm emission, rather than thebright spiral galaxies previously identified by smail et al. (1998). from thesurface density of these submm-bright eros we suggest that this class accountsfor the majority of the reddest members of the ero population, in goodagreement with the preliminary conclusions of pointed submm observations ofindividual eros. we conclude that the most extreme eros represent a populationof dusty, ultraluminous galaxies at high redshifts; further study of these willprovide insights into the nature of star formation in obscured galaxies in theearly universe. the identification of similar counterparts in blank field submmsurveys will be extremely difficult owing to their faintness (k~20.5, i&gt;26.5).finally, we discuss the radio and submm properties of the two submm-bright erosdiscovered here and suggest that both galaxies lie at z&gt;2.

astro-ph;9907022	the submillimeter search for very high redshift galaxies	identifying the optical/near-infrared (nir) counterparts to the distantsubmillimeter (submm) source population has proved difficult due to poor submmspatial resolution. however, the proportionality of both centimeter and submmdata to the star formation rate suggests that high resolution radio continuummaps with subarcsecond positional accuracy could be exploited to locate submmsources. we targeted with scuba a sample of micro-jy radio sources in theflanking fields of the hubble deep field selected from the uniform (8 micro-jyat 1-sigma) 1.4 ghz vla image of richards (1999). we find that the majority ofbright (&gt;6 mjy) submm sources have detectable radio counterparts. with theprecise positions from the radio, we also find that these submm sources areextremely faint in the optical and nir (i&gt;&gt;24 and k=21-22) and are thereforeinaccessible to optical spectroscopy. redshift estimates can, however, be madefrom the shape of the spectral energy distribution in the radio and submm. thisprocedure, which we refer to as millimetric redshift estimation, places thebright submm population at z=1-3, where it forms the high redshift tail of thefaint radio population.

astro-ph;9907043	the view of galaxy formation from hawaii: seeing the dark side of the  universe	the strength of the submillimeter background light shows directly that muchof the energy radiated by star formation and agn is moved to far infraredwavelengths. however, it is only as this background at 850 microns has beenresolved with direct submillimeter imaging that we have seen that it is createdby a population of ultraluminous (or near ultraluminous) infrared galaxies(uligs) which appear to lie at relatively high redshifts (z&gt;1). mapping theredshift evolution of this major portion of the universal star formation hasbeen difficult because of the poor submillimeter spatial resolution, but thisdifficulty can be overcome by using extremely deep cm continuum radioobservations to obtain precise astrometric information since the bulk of thebrighter submillimeter sources have detectable radio counterparts. however,with this precise position information available, we find that most of thesubmillimeter sources are extremely faint in the optical and near infrared(i&gt;&gt;24 and k=21-22) and inaccessible to optical spectroscopy. rough photometricredshift estimates can be made from combined radio and submillimeter energydistributions. we shall refer to this procedure as millimetric redshiftestimation to distinguish it from photometric estimators in the optical andnear ir. these estimators place the bulk of the submillimeter population atz=1-3, where it corresponds to the high redshift tail of the faint cm radiopopulation. while still preliminary, the results suggest that the submillimeterpopulation appears to dominate the star formation in this redshift range byalmost an order of magnitude over the mostly distinct populations selected inthe optical-ultraviolet.

0811.0824	the optx project i: the flux and redshift catalogs for the clans,  clasxs, and cdf-n fields	we present the redshift catalogs for the x-ray sources detected in thechandra deep field north (cdf-n), the chandra large area synoptic x-ray survey(clasxs), and the chandra lockman area north survey (clans). the catalogs forthe cdf-n and clasxs fields include redshifts from previous work, while theredshifts for the clans field are all new. for fluxes above 10^-14 ergs cm^-2s^-1 (2-8 kev) we have redshifts for 76% of the sources. we extend the redshiftinformation for the full sample using photometric redshifts. the goal of theoptx project is to use these three surveys, which are among the mostspectroscopically complete surveys to date, to analyze the effect of spectraltype on the shape and evolution of the x-ray luminosity functions and tocompare the optical spectral types with the x-ray spectral properties.  we also present the clans x-ray catalog. the nine acis-i fields cover a solidangle of ~0.6 square degrees and reach fluxes of 7x10^-16 ergs cm^-2 s^-1(0.5-2 kev) and 3.5x10^-15 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 (2-8 kev). we find a total of 761x-ray point sources. additionally, we present the optical and infraredphotometric catalog for the clans x-ray sources, as well as updated optical andinfrared photometric catalogs for the x-ray sources in the clasxs and cdf-nfields.  the clans and clasxs surveys bridge the gap between the ultradeep pencil-beamsurveys, such as the cdfs, and the shallower, very large-area surveys. as aresult, they probe the x-ray sources that contribute the bulk of the 2-8 kevx-ray background and cover the flux range of the observed break in thelogn-logs distribution. we construct differential number counts for eachindividual field and for the full sample.

0811.1042	measuring the sources of the intergalactic ionizing flux	we use a wide-field (0.9 square degree) x-ray sample with optical and galexultraviolet observations to measure the contribution of active galactic nuclei(agns) to the ionizing flux as a function of redshift. our analysis shows thatthe agn contribution to the metagalactic ionizing background peaks around z=2.the measured values of the ionizing background from the agns are lower thanprevious estimates and confirm that ionization from agns is insufficient tomaintain the observed ionization of the intergalactic medium (igm) at z&gt;3. weshow that only sources with broad lines in their optical spectra havedetectable ionizing flux and that the ionizing flux seen in an agn is notcorrelated with its x-ray color. we also use the galex observations of thegoods-n region to place a 2-sigma upper limit of 0.008 on the averageionization fraction fnu(700 a)/fnu(1500 a) for 626 uv selected galaxies in theredshift range z=0.9-1.4. we then use this limit to estimate an upper bound tothe galaxy contribution in the redshift range z=0-5. if the z~1.15 ionizationfraction is appropriate for higher redshift galaxies, then contributions fromthe galaxy population are also too low to account for the igm ionization at thehighest redshifts (z&gt;4).

0812.2481	a highly complete spectroscopic survey of the goods-n field	we present a table of redshifts for 2907 galaxies and stars in the 145 squarearcmin hst acs goods-north, making this the most spectroscopically completeredshift sample obtained to date in a field of this size. we also include theredshifts, where available, in a table containing just under 7000 galaxies fromthe acs area with k_s(ab)&lt;24.5 measured from a deep k_s image obtained withwircam on the cfht, as well as in a table containing 1016 sources withnuv(ab)&lt;25 and 478 sources with fuv(ab)&lt;25.5 (there is considerable overlap)measured from the deep galex images in the acs area. finally, we include theredshifts, where available, in a table containing the 1199 24 micron sources to80 ujy measured from the wider-area spitzer goods-north. the redshiftidentifications are greater than 90% complete to magnitudes of f435w(ab)=24.5,f850lp(ab)=23.3, and k_s(ab)=21.5 and to 24 micron fluxes of 250 ujy. anextensive analysis of these data will appear in a parallel paper, but here wedetermine how efficient color-selection techniques are at identifyinghigh-redshift galaxies and active galactic nuclei. we also examine thefeasibility of doing tomography of the intergalactic medium with a 30 mtelescope.
