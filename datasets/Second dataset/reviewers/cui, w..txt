0901.4561	veritas observations of the bl lac 1es 1218+304	the veritas collaboration reports the detection of very-high-energy (vhe)gamma-ray emission from the high-frequency-peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304located at a redshift of z=0.182. a gamma-ray signal was detected with astatistical significance of 10.4 standard deviations (10.4 sigma) for theobservations taken during the first three months of 2007, confirming thediscovery of this object made by the magic collaboration. the photon spectrumbetween ~160 gev and ~1.8 tev is well described by a power law with an index ofgamma = 3.08 +/- 0.34_stat +/- 0.2_sys. the integral flux is phi(e &gt; 200 gev) =(12.2 +/- 2.6) x 10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1, which corresponds to ~6% of that of thecrab nebula. the light curve does not show any evidence for vhe fluxvariability. using lower limits on the density of the extragalactic backgroundlight in the near to mid-infrared we are able to limit the range of intrinsicenergy spectra for 1es 1218+304. we show that the intrinsic photon spectrum hasan index that is harder than gamma = 2.32 +/- 0.37_stat. when includingconstraints from the spectra of 1es 1101-232 and 1es 0229+200, the spectrum of1es 1218+304 is likely to be harder than gamma = 1.86 +/- 0.37_stat.

1001.2590	discovery of variability in the very high energy gamma-ray emission of  1es 1218+304 with veritas	we present results from an intensive veritas monitoring campaign of thehigh-frequency peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304 in 2008/2009. although 1es1218+304 was detected previously by magic and veritas at a persistent level of~6% of the crab nebula flux, the new veritas data reveal a prominent flarereaching ~20% of the crab. while very high energy (vhe) flares are quite commonin many nearby blazars, the case of 1es 1218+304 (redshift z = 0.182) isparticularly interesting since it belongs to a group of blazars that exhibitunusually hard vhe spectra considering their redshifts. when correcting themeasured spectra for absorption by the extragalactic background light, 1es1218+304 and a number of other blazars are found to have differential photonindices less than 1.5. the difficulty in modeling these hard spectral energydistributions in blazar jets has led to a range of theoretical gamma-rayemission scenarios, one of which is strongly constrained by these new veritasobservations. we consider the implications of the observed light curve of 1es1218+304, which shows day scale flux variations, for shock accelerationscenarios in relativistic jets, and in particular for the viability ofkiloparsec-scale jet emission scenarios.

1005.0367	veritas 2008 - 2009 monitoring of the variable gamma-ray source m87	m87 is a nearby radio galaxy that is detected at energies ranging from radioto vhe gamma-rays. its proximity and its jet, misaligned from ourline-of-sight, enable detailed morphological studies and extensive modeling atradio, optical, and x-ray energies. flaring activity was observed at allenergies, and multi-wavelength correlations would help clarify the origin ofthe vhe emission. in this paper, we describe a detailed temporal and spectralanalysis of the veritas vhe gamma-ray observations of m87 in 2008 and 2009. inthe 2008 observing season, veritas detected an excess with a statisticalsignificance of 7.2 sigma from m87 during a joint multi-wavelength monitoringcampaign conducted by three major vhe experiments along with the chandra x-rayobservatory. in february 2008, veritas observed a vhe flare from m87 occurringover a 4-day timespan. the peak nightly flux above 250gev was 7.7% of the crabnebula flux. m87 was marginally detected before this 4-day flare period, andwas not detected afterwards. spectral analysis of the veritas observationsshowed no significant change in the photon index between the flare andpre-flare states. shortly after the vhe flare seen by veritas, the chandrax-ray observatory detected the flux from the core of m87 at a historicalmaximum, while the flux from the nearby knot hst-1 remained quiescent. acciariet al. (2009) presented the 2008 contemporaneous vhe gamma-ray, chandra x-ray,and vlba radio observations which suggest the core as the most likely source ofvhe emission, in contrast to the 2005 vhe flare that was simultaneous with anx-ray flare in the hst-1 knot. in 2009, veritas continued its monitoring of m87and marginally detected a 4.2 sigma excess corresponding to a flux of ~1% ofthe crab nebula. no vhe flaring activity was observed in 2009.

1006.5955	veritas search for vhe gamma-ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies	indirect dark matter searches with ground-based gamma-ray observatoriesprovide an alternative for identifying the particle nature of dark matter thatis complementary to that of direct search or accelerator productionexperiments. we present the results of observations of the dwarf spheroidalgalaxies draco, ursa minor, bootes 1, and willman 1 conducted by veritas. thesegalaxies are nearby dark matter dominated objects located at a typical distanceof several tens of kiloparsecs for which there are good measurements of thedark matter density profile from stellar velocity measurements. since theconventional astrophysical background of very high energy gamma rays from theseobjects appears to be negligible, they are good targets to search for thesecondary gamma-ray photons produced by interacting or decaying dark matterparticles. no significant gamma-ray flux above 200 gev was detected from thesefour dwarf galaxies for a typical exposure of ~20 hours. the 95% confidenceupper limits on the integral gamma-ray flux are in the range 0.4-2.2x10^-12photons cm^-2s^-1. we interpret this limiting flux in the context of pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles and derive constraints onthe thermally averaged product of the total self-annihilation cross section andthe relative velocity of the wimps. the limits are obtained under conservativeassumptions regarding the dark matter distribution in dwarf galaxies and areapproximately three orders of magnitude above the generic theoreticalprediction for wimps in the minimal supersymmetric standard model framework.however significant uncertainty exists in the dark matter distribution as wellas the neutralino cross sections which under favorable assumptions couldfurther lower the limits.

1208.0676	constraints on cosmic rays, magnetic fields, and dark matter from  gamma-ray observations of the coma cluster of galaxies with veritas and fermi	observations of radio halos and relics in galaxy clusters indicate efficientelectron acceleration. protons should likewise be accelerated, suggesting thatclusters may also be sources of very high-energy (vhe; e&gt;100 gev) gamma-rayemission. we report here on vhe gamma-ray observations of the coma galaxycluster with the veritas array of imaging cherenkov telescopes, withcomplementing fermi-lat observations at gev energies. no significant gamma-rayemission from the coma cluster was detected. integral flux upper limits at the99% confidence level were measured to be on the order of (2-5)*10^-8\ ph. m^-2s^-1 (veritas, &gt;220 gev} and ~2*10^-6 ph. m^-2 s^-1 (fermi, 1-3 gev),respectively. we use the gamma-ray upper limits to constrain crs and magneticfields in coma. using an analytical approach, the cr-to-thermal pressure ratiois constrained to be &lt; 16% from veritas data and &lt; 1.7% from fermi data(averaged within the virial radius). these upper limits are starting toconstrain the cr physics in self-consistent cosmological cluster simulationsand cap the maximum cr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks tobe &lt;50%. assuming that the radio-emitting electrons of the coma halo resultfrom hadronic cr interactions, the observations imply a lower limit on thecentral magnetic field in coma of (2 - 5.5) mug, depending on the radialmagnetic-field profile and on the gamma-ray spectral index. since these valuesare below those inferred by faraday rotation measurements in coma (for most ofthe parameter space), this {renders} the hadronic model a very plausibleexplanation of the coma radio halo. finally, since galaxy clusters aredark-matter (dm) dominated, the veritas upper limits have been used to placeconstraints on the thermally-averaged product of the total self-annihilationcross section and the relative velocity of the dm particles, &lt;\sigma v&gt;.

1211.3073	rapid tev gamma-ray flaring of bl lacertae	we report on the detection of a very rapid tev gamma-ray flare from bllacertae on 2011 june 28 with the very energetic radiation imaging telescopearray system (veritas). the flaring activity was observed during a 34.6-minuteexposure, when the integral flux above 200 gev reached $(3.4\pm0.6) \times10^{-6} \;\text{photons}\;\text{m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$, roughly 125% of the crabnebula flux measured by veritas. the light curve indicates that theobservations missed the rising phase of the flare but covered a significantportion of the decaying phase. the exponential decay time was determined to be$13\pm4$ minutes, making it one of the most rapid gamma-ray flares seen from atev blazar. the gamma-ray spectrum of bl lacertae during the flare was soft,with a photon index of $3.6\pm 0.4$, which is in agreement with the measurementmade previously by magic in a lower flaring state. contemporaneous radioobservations of the source with the very long baseline array (vlba) revealedthe emergence of a new, superluminal component from the core around the time ofthe tev gamma-ray flare, accompanied by changes in the optical polarizationangle. changes in flux also appear to have occurred at optical, uv, and gevgamma-ray wavelengths at the time of the flare, although they are difficult toquantify precisely due to sparse coverage. a strong flare was seen at radiowavelengths roughly four months later, which might be related to the gamma-rayflaring activities. we discuss the implications of these multiwavelengthresults.

1212.4739	discovery of tev gamma-ray emission from cta 1 by veritas	we report the discovery of tev gamma-ray emission coincident with theshell-type radio supernova remnant (snr) cta 1 using the veritas gamma-rayobservatory. the source, ver j0006+729, was detected as a 6.5 standarddeviation excess over background and shows an extended morphology, approximatedby a two-dimensional gaussian of semi-major (semi-minor) axis 0.30 degree (0.24degree) and a centroid 5' from the fermi gamma-ray pulsar psr j0007+7303 andits x-ray pulsar wind nebula (pwn). the photon spectrum is well described by apower-law dn/de = n_0 (e/3 tev)^(-\gamma), with a differential spectral indexof \gamma = 2.2 +- 0.2_stat +- 0.3_sys, and normalization n_0 = (9.1 +-1.3_stat +- 1.7_sys) x 10^(-14) cm^(-2) s^(-1) tev^(-1). the integral flux,f_\gamma = 4.0 x 10^(-12) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1) above 1 tev, corresponds to 0.2%of the pulsar spin-down power at 1.4 kpc. the energetics, co-location with thesnr, and the relatively small extent of the tev emission strongly argue for thepwn origin of the tev photons. we consider the origin of the tev emission incta 1.

1410.6860	photometric redshifts in the hawaii-hubble deep field-north (h-hdf-n)	we derive photometric redshifts (\zp) for sources in the entire ($\sim0.4$deg$^2$) hawaii-hubble deep field-north (\hdfn) field with the eazy code, basedon point spread function-matched photometry of 15 broad bands from theultraviolet (\bandu~band) to mid-infrared (irac 4.5 $\mu$m). our catalogconsists of a total of 131,678 sources. we evaluate the \zp~quality bycomparing \zp~with spectroscopic redshifts (\zs) when available, and find avalue of normalized median absolute deviation \sigm$=$0.029 and an outlierfraction of 5.5\% (outliers are defined as sources having $\rm |\zp -\zs|/(1+\zs) &gt; 0.15$) for non-x-ray sources. more specifically, we obtain\sigm$=0.024$ with 2.7\% outliers for sources brighter than $r=23$~mag,\sigm$=0.035$ with 7.4\% outliers for sources fainter than $r=23$~mag,\sigm$=$0.026 with 3.9\% outliers for sources having $z&lt;1$, and \sigm$=$0.034with 9.0\% outliers for sources having $z&gt;1$. our \zp\ quality shows an overallimprovement over an earlier \zp\ work that focused only on the central \hdfn\area. we also classify each object as star or galaxy through template spectralenergy distribution fitting and complementary morphological parametrization,resulting in 4959 stars and 126,719 galaxies. furthermore, we match our catalogwith the 2~ms {\it chandra} deep field-north main \xray~catalog. for the 462matched non-stellar \xray~sources (281 having \zs), we improve their\zp~quality by adding three additional agn templates, achieving \sigm$=0.035$and an outlier fraction of 12.5\%. we make our catalog publicly availablepresenting both photometry and \zp, and provide guidance on how to make use ofour catalog.

1412.1031	investigating broadband variability of the tev blazar 1es 1959+650	we summarize broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazar 1es 1959+650,including optical r-band observations by the robotic telescopes super-lotis anditelescope, uv observations by swift uvot, x-ray observations by the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt), high-energy gamma-ray observations with the fermi largearea telescope (lat) and very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray observations byveritas above 315 gev, all taken between 17 april 2012 and 1 june 2012 (mjd56034 and 56079). the contemporaneous variability of the broadband spectralenergy distribution is explored in the context of a simple synchrotron selfcompton (ssc) model. in the ssc emission scenario, we find that the parametersrequired to represent the high state are significantly different than those inthe low state. motivated by possible evidence of gas in the vicinity of theblazar, we also investigate a reflected-emission model to describe the observedvariability pattern. this model assumes that the non-thermal emission from thejet is reflected by a nearby cloud of gas, allowing the reflected emission tore-enter the blob and produce an elevated gamma-ray state with no simultaneouselevated synchrotron flux. the model applied here, although not required toexplain the observed variability pattern, represents one possible scenariowhich can describe the observations. as applied to an elevated vhe state of 66%of the crab nebula flux, observed on a single night during the observationperiod, the reflected-emission scenario does not support a purely leptonicnon-thermal emission mechanism. the reflected emission model does, however,predict a reflected photon field with sufficient energy to enable elevatedgamma-ray emission via pion production with protons of energies between 10 and100 tev.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1506.06246	veritas detection of $\gamma$-ray flaring activity from the bl lac  object 1es 1727+502 during bright moonlight observations	during moonlit nights, observations with ground-based cherenkov telescopes atvery high energies (vhe, $e&gt;100$ gev) are constrained since the photomultipliertubes (pmts) in the telescope camera are extremely sensitive to the backgroundmoonlight. observations with the veritas telescopes in the standardconfiguration are performed only with a moon illumination less than 35$\%$ offull moon. since 2012, the veritas collaboration has implemented a newobserving mode under bright moonlight, by either reducing the voltage appliedto the pmts (reduced-high-voltage configuration, rhv), or by utilizinguv-transparent filters. while these operating modes result in lower sensitivityand increased energy thresholds, the extension of the available observing timeis useful for monitoring variable sources such as blazars and sources requiringspectral measurements at the highest energies. in this paper we report thedetection of $\gamma$-ray flaring activity from the bl lac object 1es 1727+502during rhv observations. this detection represents the first evidence of vhevariability from this blazar. the integral flux is$(1.1\pm0.2)\times10^{-11}\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$ above 250 gev, which is aboutfive times higher than the low-flux state. the detection triggered additional\veritas\ observations during standard dark-time. multiwavelength observationswith the flwo 48" telescope, and the swift and fermi satellites are presentedand used to produce the first spectral energy distribution (sed) of this objectduring $\gamma$-ray flaring activity. the sed is then fitted with a standardsynchrotron-self-compton model, placing constraints on the properties of theemitting region and of the acceleration mechanism at the origin of therelativistic particle population in the jet.

astro-ph;0306626	the remarkable rapid x-ray, ultraviolet, optical, and ir variability in  the black hole xte j1118+480	the transient black hole binary xte j1118+480 exhibited dramatic rapidvariability at all wavelengths which were suitably observed during its 2000april-july outburst. we examine time-resolved x-ray, ultraviolet, optical, andinfrared data spanning the plateau phase of the outburst. we find that bothx-ray and infrared bands show large amplitude variability. the ultraviolet andoptical variability is more subdued, but clearly correlated with that seen inthe x-rays. the ultraviolet, at least, appears to be dominated by thecontinuum, although the lines are also variable. using the x-ray variations asa reference point, we find that the uv variability at long wavelengths occurslater than that at short wavelengths. uncertainty in hst timing prohibits adetermination of the absolute lag with respect to the x-rays, however. thetransfer function is clearly not a delta-function, exhibiting significantrepeatable structure. for the main signal we can rule out an origin inreprocessing on the companion star - the lack of variation in the lags is notconsistent with this given a relatively high orbital inclination. weakreprocessing from the disc and/or companion star may be present, but is notrequired, and another component must dominate the variability. this could bevariable synchrotron emission correlated with x-ray variability, consistentwith our earlier interpretation of the ir flux as due to synchrotron emissionrather than thermal disc emission. in fact the broad-band energy distributionof the variability from ir to x-rays is consistent with expectations ofoptically thin synchrotron emission. we also follow the evolution of thelow-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation in x-rays, uv, and optical. itsproperties at all wavelengths are similar indicating a common origin.

astro-ph;0309047	multiwavelength observations revealing the evolution of the outburst of  the black hole xte j1118+480	we report multiwavelength observations of the soft x-ray transient (sxt) xtej1118+480, which we observed with ukirt, hst, rxte, euve and many otherinstruments and facilities. adding radio (ryle telescope, vla), sub-millimeter(jcmt) and x-ray (chandra and sax) data from the literature, we assembled themost complete spectral energy distribution (sed) of this source yet published.we followed the evolution of this source for 1 year, including 6 observationsperformed during the outburst, and one observation at the end of the outburst.because of xte j1118+480's unusually high galactic latitude, it suffers fromvery low extinction, and its sed is near-complete, including euv (extremeultraviolet) observations. xte j1118+480 exhibits an unusually low low-hardstate (estimated inner radius 350rs) and a strong non-thermal contribution inthe radio to optical domain, which is likely to be due to synchrotron emission.we discuss the interstellar column density and show that it is low, between0.80 and 1.30 x 10^20 cm-2. we analyse the evolution of the sed during theoutburst, including the contributions from the companion star, the accretiondisc, the outflow, and relating irradiation and variability of the source indifferent bands to the sed. we find no significant spectral variability duringthe outburst evolution, consistent with the presence of a steady outflow.analysis of its outflow to accretion energy ratio suggests that the microquasarxte j1118+480 is analogous to radio-quiet quasars. this, combined with theinverted spectrum from radio to optical, makes xte j1118+480 very similar toother microquasar sources, e.g. grs 1915+105 and gx 339-4 in their low/hardstate. we model the high-energy emission with a hot disc model, and discussdifferent accretion models for xte j1118+480's broad band spectrum.

astro-ph;0508661	warm-hot gas in and around the milky way: detection and implications of  ovii absorption toward lmc x-3	x-ray absorption lines of highly-ionized species such as ovii at about zeroredshift have been firmly detected in the spectra of several active galacticnuclei. however, the location of the absorbing gas remains a subject of debate.to separate the galactic and extragalactic contributions to the absorption, wehave obtained chandra letg-hrc and fuse observations of the black hole x-raybinary lmc x--3. a joint analysis of the detected ovii and ne ix kalpha lines,together with the non-detection of the ovii kbeta and oviii kalpha lines, givesthe measurements of the temperature, velocity dispersion, and hot oxygen columndensity. the x-ray data also allow us to place a 95% confidence lower limit tothe ne/o ratio as 0.14. the ovii line centroid and its relative shift from thegalactic oi kalpha absorption line, detected in the same observations, areinconsistent with the systemic velocity of lmc x--3 ($+310 {\rm km s^{-1}}$).the far-uv spectrum shows ovi absorption at galactic velocities, but no oviabsorption is detected at the lmc velocity at $&gt; 3\sigma$ significance. boththe nonthermal broadening and the decreasing scale height with the increasingionization state further suggest an origin of the highly-ionized gas in asupernova-driven galactic fountain. in addition, we estimate the warm and hotelectron column densities from our detected ovii kalpha line in the lmc x--3x-ray spectra and from the dispersion measure of a pulsar in the lmc vicinity.we then infer the o/h ratio of the gas to be $\gtrsim 8 \times 10^{-5}$,consistent with the chemically-enriched galactic fountain scenario. we concludethat the galactic hot interstellar medium should in general substantiallycontribute to zero-redshift x-ray absorption lines in extragalactic sources.

astro-ph;0602258	tev gamma-ray observations of the perseus and abell 2029 galaxy clusters	galaxy clusters might be sources of tev gamma rays emitted by high-energyprotons and electrons accelerated by large scale structure formation shocks,galactic winds, or active galactic nuclei. furthermore, gamma rays may beproduced in dark matter particle annihilation processes at the cluster cores.we report on observations of the galaxy clusters perseus and abell 2029 usingthe 10 m whipple cherenkov telescope during the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005observing seasons. we apply a two-dimensional analysis technique to scrutinizethe clusters for tev emission. in this paper we first determine flux upperlimits on tev gamma-ray emission from point sources within the clusters.second, we derive upper limits on the extended cluster emission. wesubsequently compare the flux upper limits with egret upper limits at 100 mevand theoretical models. assuming that the gamma-ray surface brightness profilemimics that of the thermal x-ray emission and that the spectrum of clustercosmic rays extends all the way from thermal energies to multi-tev energieswith a differential spectral index of -2.1, our results imply that the cosmicray proton energy density is less than 7.9% of the thermal energy density forthe perseus cluster.

astro-ph;0607314	further evidence for variable synchrotron emission in xte j1118+480 in  outburst	we present simultaneous multicolor infrared and optical photometry of theblack hole x-ray transient xte j1118+480 during its short 2005 januaryoutburst, supported by simultaneous x-ray observations. the variability isdominated by short timescales, ~10s, although a weak superhump also appears tobe present in the optical. the optical rapid variations, at least, are wellcorrelated with those in x-rays. infrared jhks photometry, as in the previousoutburst, exhibits especially large amplitude variability. the spectral energydistribution (sed) of the variable infrared component can be fitted with apower-law of slope alpha=-0.78 where fnu is proportional to nu^alpha. there isno compelling evidence for evolution in the slope over five nights, duringwhich time the source brightness decayed along almost the same track as seen invariations within the nights. we conclude that both short-term variability, andlonger timescale fading, are dominated by a single component of constantspectral shape. we cannot fit the sed of the ir variability with a crediblethermal component, either optically thick or thin. this ir sed is, however,approximately consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission from a jet.these observations therefore provide indirect evidence to support jet-dominatedmodels for xte j1118+480 and also provide a direct measurement of the slope ofthe optically thin emission which is impossible based on the average spectralenergy distribution alone.

astro-ph;9610071	rxte observation of cygnus x-1 in its high state	we present the results from the rxte observations of cygnus x-1 in its highstate. in the energy range of 2-200 kev, the observed x-ray spectrum can bedescribed by a model consisting of a soft blackbody component and a brokenpower-law with a high energy cutoff. the low energy spectrum (below about 11kev) varies significantly from observation to observation while the high energyportion changes little. the x-ray flux varies on all timescales down tomilliseconds. the power density spectrum (pds) can be characterized by excessred noise (``1/f'') at low frequencies and a white noise component that extendsto 1-3 hz before being cut off. at higher frequencies, the pds becomespower-law again, with a slope of roughly -2 (i.e., ``1/f^2''). broad peaks inthe range of 3-9 hz are present, and might be due to quasi-periodicoscillations. the pds shows interesting spectral dependence: the 1/f componentbecomes more prominent when the low-energy spectrum becomes softer. thedifference in the observed spectral and timing properties between the low andhigh states is qualitatively consistent with a simple ``fluctuating corona''model.

astro-ph;9610072	x-ray variability of cygnus x-1 in its soft state	we reported previously that for cyg x-1 there is a settling period followingthe transition from hard to soft state (astro-ph/9610071). during thetransiton, the low energy spectrum (below ~10 kev) varies significantly fromobservation to observation while the high energy portion changes little. thesource reaches nominal soft-state brightness during the settling period. it canbe characterized by a soft low-energy spectrum and significant low-frequency1/f noise and white noise on the power density spectrum (pds). the low-energyspectrum becomes even softer, and the pds is completely dominated by the 1/fnoise, when the ``true'' soft state is reached. in this paper, subsequent rxteobservations of cyg x-1 in the soft state are examined, and the results confirmour earlier conclusions. furthermore, we show the results from observationstaken during a soft-to-hard transition. as expected, the white noise appearsagain, and accordingly, the 1/f noise becomes less dominant, similar to thesettling period at the end of the hard-to-soft transition. the low-frequency1/f noise has not been observed when cyg x-1 is in the hard state. therefore,it seems to be positively correlated with the disk mass accretion rate which islow in the hard state and high in the soft state. the difference in theobserved spectral and timing properties between the hard and soft states isqualitatively consistent with a simple ``fluctuating corona'' model(astro-ph/9610071). here we present more evidence for it.

astro-ph;9701027	the 1996 soft state transitions of cygnus x-1	we report continuous monitoring of cygnus x-1 in the 1.3 to 200 kev bandusing asm/rxte and batse/cgro for about 200 days from 1996 february 21 to 1996early september. during this period cygnus x-1 experienced a hard-to-soft andthen a soft-to-hard state transition. the low-energy x-ray (1.3-12 kev) andhigh-energy x-ray (20-200 kev) fluxes are strongly anti-correlated during thisperiod. during the state transitions flux variations of about a factor of 5 and15 were seen in the 1.3-3.0 kev and 100-200 kev bands, respectively, while theaverage 4.8-12 kev flux remains almost unchanged. the net effect of thispivoting is that the total 1.3-200 kev luminosity remained unchanged to withinabout 15%. the bolometric luminosity in the soft state may be as high as 50-70%above the hard state luminosity, after color corrections for the luminositybelow 1.3 kev. the blackbody component flux and temperature increase in thesoft state is probably caused by a combination of the optically thick disk massaccretion rate increase and a decrease of the inner disk radius.

astro-ph;9912028	the timing evolution of 4u 1630-47 during its 1998 outburst	we report on the evolution of the timing of 4u1630-47 during its 1998outburst using data obtained with the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte). thecount rate and position in hardness-intensity, color-color diagrams and simplespectral fits are used to track the concurrent spectral changes. the sourceshowed seven distinct types of timing behavior, most of which show differenceswith the canonical black hole spectral/timing states. in marked contrast toprevious outbursts, we find quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) signals duringnearly all stages of the outburst with frequencies between 0.06hz and 14hz anda remarkable variety of other characteristics. in particular we find large (upto 23% rms) amplitude qpo on the early rise. later, slow 0.1hz semi- regularshort (~ 5 sec), 9 to 16% deep dips dominate the light curve. at this timethere are two qpos, one stable near 13.5hz and the other whose frequency dropsfrom 6--8hz to ~4.5 hz during the dips. bepposax observations during the verylate declining phase show 4u1630-47 in a low state.
