0905.4502	tracing sagittarius structure with sdss and segue imaging and  spectroscopy	we show that the sagittarius dwarf tidal stream can be traced with very redk/m-giant stars selected from sdss photometry. a subset of these stars arespectroscopically confirmed with segue and sdss spectra, and the distance scaleof 2mass and sdss m giants is calibrated to the rr lyrae distance scale. theabsolute g band magnitude of the k/m-giant stars at the tip of the giant branchis m_g=-1.0. the line-of-sight velocities of the m giant and bhb stars that arespatially coincident with the sgr dwarf tidal stream are consistent with thoseof previous authors, reinforcing the need for new models that can explain allof the sgr tidal debris stream observations. we estimate stellar densitiesalong the tidal tails that can be used to help constrain future models. thek/m-giant, bhb, and f-turnoff stars in the lower surface brightness tidalstream that is adjacent to the main leading sgr dwarf tidal tail havevelocities and metallicities that are similar to those of the stars in theleading tidal tail. the ratio of k/m giants to bhbs and bhbs to f-turnoff starsare also similar for both branches of the leading tidal tail. we show thatthere is an additional low-metallicity tidal stream near the sgr trailing tidaltail.

0908.2627	insight into the formation of the milky way through cold halo  substructure. i. the echos of milky way formation	we identify ten -- seven for the first time -- elements of cold halosubstructure (echos) in the volume within 17.5 kpc of the sun in the inner haloof the milky way. our result is based on the observed spatial and radialvelocity distribution of metal-poor main sequence turnoff (mpmsto) stars in 137sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration (segue) lines ofsight. we point out that the observed radial velocity distribution isconsistent with a smooth stellar component of the milky way's inner halooverall, but disagrees significantly at the radial velocities that correspondto our detections. we show that all of our detections are statisticallysignificant and that we expect no false positives. we also use our detectionsand completeness estimates to infer a formal upper limit of 0.34 +/- 0.02 onthe fraction of the mpmsto population in the inner halo that belong to echos.our detections and completeness calculations suggest that there is asignificant population of low fractional overdensity echos in the inner halo,and we predict that 1/3 of the inner halo (by volume) harbors echos with mpmstostar number densities n ~ 15 kpc^-3. echos are likely older than known surfacebrightness substructure, so our detections provide us with a direct measure ofthe accretion history of the milky way in a region and time interval that hasyet to be fully explored. in concert with previous studies, our result suggeststhat the level of merger activity has been roughly constant over the past fewgyr and that there has been no accretion of single stellar systems more massivethan a few percent of a milky way mass in that interval.

0909.3019	structure and kinematics of the stellar halos and thick disks of the  milky way based on calibration stars from sdss dr7	the structure and kinematics of the recognized stellar components of themilky way are explored, based on well-determined atmospheric parameters andkinematic quantities for 32360 calibration stars from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) and its first extension, (sdss-ii), which included the sub-surveysegue: sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration. full spacemotions for a sub-sample of 16920 stars, exploring a local volume within 4 kpcof the sun, are used to derive velocity ellipsoids for the inner- andouter-halo components of the galaxy, as well as for the canonical thick-diskand proposed metal-weak thick-disk populations. we first examine the questionof whether the data require the presence of at least a two-component halo inorder to account for the rotational behavior of likely halo stars in the localvolume, and whether more than two components are needed. we also address thequestion of whether the proposed metal-weak thick disk is kinematically andchemically distinct from the canonical thick disk. in addition, we consider thefractions of each component required to understand the nature of the observedkinematic behavior of the stellar populations of the galaxy as a function ofdistance from the plane. scale lengths and scale heights for the thick-disk andmetal-weak thick-disk components are determined. spatial density profiles forthe inner- and outer-halo populations are inferred from a jeans theoremanalysis. the full set of calibration stars (including those outside the localvolume) is used to test for the expected changes in the observed stellarmetallicity distribution function with distance above the galactic planein-situ, due to the changing contributions from the underlying stellarpopulations.

0910.4731	metallicity mapping with gri photometry: the virgo overdensity and the  halos of the galaxy	we describe the methodology required for estimation of photometric estimatesof metallicity based on the sdss gri passbands, which can be used to probe theproperties of main-sequence stars beyond ~ 10 kpc, complementing studies ofnearby stars from more metallicity-sensitive color indices that involve the upassband. as a first application of this approach, we determine photometricmetal abundance estimates for individual main-sequence stars in the virgooverdensity, which covers almost 1000 square degrees on the sky, based on acalibration of the metallicity sensitivity of stellar isochrones in the grifilter passbands using field stars with well-determined spectroscopic metalabundances. despite the low precision of the method for individual stars,internal errors of in [fe/h] ~ +/- 0.1 dex can be achieved for bulk stellarpopulations. the global metal abundance of the virgo overdensity determined inthis way is &lt;[fe/h]&gt; = -2.0 +/- 0.1 (internal) +/- 0.5 (systematic), fromphotometric measurements of 0.7 million stars with heliocentric distances from~ 10 kpc to ~ 20 kpc. a preliminary metallicity map, based on results for 2.9million stars in the northern sdss dr-7 footprint, exhibits a shift to lowermetallicities as one proceeds from the inner- to the outer-halo population,consistent with recent interpretation of the kinematics of local samples ofstars with spectroscopically available metallicity estimates and full spacemotions.

1001.2512	a search for unrecognized carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars in the galaxy	we have developed a new procedure to search for carbon-enhanced metal-poor(cemp) stars from the hamburg/eso (hes) prism-survey plates. this methodemploys an extended line index for the ch g-band, which we demonstrate to havesuperior behavior when compared to the narrower g-band index formerly employedto estimate g-band strengths for these spectra. although cemp stars have beenfound previously among candidate metal-poor stars selected from the hes, theselection on metallicity undersamples the population ofintermediate-metallicity cemp stars (-2.5&lt;=[fe/h]&lt;=-1.0); such stars are ofimportance for constraining the onset of the s-process in metal-deficientasymptotic giant-branch stars (thought to be associated with the origin ofcarbon for roughly 80% of cemp stars). the new candidates also includesubstantial numbers of warmer carbon-enhanced stars, which were missed inprevious hes searches for carbon stars due to selection criteria thatemphasized stars with cooler temperatures.  a first subsample, biased towards brighter stars (b&lt;15.5), has been extractedfrom the scanned hes plates. after visual inspection, a list of 669 previouslyunidentified candidate cemp stars was compiled. follow-up spectroscopy for apilot sample of 132 candidates was obtained with the goodman spectrograph onthe soar 4.1m telescope. our results show that most of the observed stars liein the targeted metallicity range, and possess prominent carbon absorptionfeatures at 4300a. the success rate for the identification of new cemp stars is43% (13 out of 30) for [fe/h]&lt;-2.0. for stars with [fe/h]&lt;-2.5, the ratioincreases to 80% (4 out of 5 objects), including one star with [fe/h]&lt;-3.0.

1002.0001	binary contamination in the segue sample: effects on sspp determinations  of stellar atmospheric parameters	using numerical modeling and a grid of synthetic spectra, we examine theeffects that unresolved binaries have on the determination of various stellaratmospheric parameters for segue targets measured using the segue stellarparameter pipeline (sspp). to model undetected binaries that may be in thesegue sample, we use a variety of mass distributions for the primary andsecondary stars in conjunction with empirically determined relationships fororbital parameters to determine the fraction of g-k dwarf stars, as defined bysdss color cuts, that will be blended with a secondary companion. we focus onthe g-k dwarf sample in segue as it records the history of chemical enrichmentin our galaxy. to determine the effect of the secondary on the spectroscopicparameters, we synthesize a grid of model spectra from 3275 to 7850 k (~0.1 to1.0 \msun) and [fe/h]=-0.5 to -2.5 from marcs model atmospheres usingturbospectrum. we analyze both "infinite" signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) modelsand degraded versions, at median s/n of 50, 25 and 10. by running individualand combined spectra (representing the binaries) through the sspp, we determinethat ~10% of the blended g-k dwarf pairs with s/n&gt;=25 will have theiratmospheric parameter determinations, in particular temperature andmetallicity, noticeably affected by the presence of an undetected secondary. toaccount for the additional uncertainty from binary contamination at a s/n~10,uncertainties of ~140 k and ~0.17 dex in [fe/h] must be added in quadrature tothe published uncertainties of the sspp. (abridged)

1002.3607	statistical properties of blue horizontal branch stars in the spheroid:  detection of a moving group approximately 50 kpc from the sun	a new moving group comprising at least four blue horizontal branch (bhb)stars is identified at (l,b) = (65 deg, 48 deg). the horizontal branch atg0=18.9 magnitude implies a distance of 50 kpc from the sun. the heliocentricradial velocity is rv = -157 +/- 4 km/s, corresponding to v(gsr) = -10 km/s;the dispersion in line-of-sight velocity is consistent with the instrumentalerrors for these stars. the mean metallicity of the moving group is [fe/h]approximately -2.4, which is significantly more metal poor than the stellarspheroid. we estimate that the bhb stars in the outer halo have a meanmetallicity of [fe/h] = -2.0, with a wide scatter and a distribution that doesnot change much as a function of distance from the sun. we explore thesystematics of sdss dr7 surface gravity metallicity determinations for faintbhb stars, and present a technique for estimating the significance of clumpsdiscovered in multidimensional data. this moving group cannot be distinguishedin density, and highlights the need to collect many more spectra of galacticstars to unravel the merger history of the galaxy.

1011.1925	quantifying kinematic substructure in the milky way's stellar halo	we present and analyze the positions, distances, and radial velocities forover 4000 blue horizontal-branch (bhb) stars in the milky way's halo, drawnfrom sdss dr8. we search for position-velocity substructure in these data, asignature of the hierarchical assembly of the stellar halo. using a cumulative"close pair distribution" (cpd) as a statistic in the 4-dimensional space ofsky position, distance, and velocity, we quantify the presence ofposition-velocity substructure at high statistical significance among the bhbstars: pairs of bhb stars that are close in position on the sky tend to havemore similar distances and radial velocities compared to a random sampling ofthese overall distributions. we make analogous mock-observations of 11numerical halo formation simulations, in which the stellar halo is entirelycomposed of disrupted satellite debris, and find a level of substructurecomparable to that seen in the actually observed bhb star sample. this resultquantitatively confirms the hierarchical build-up of the stellar halo through asignature in phase (position-velocity) space. in detail, the structure presentin the bhb stars is somewhat less prominent than that seen in most simulatedhalos, quite possibly because bhb stars represent an older sub-population. bhbstars located beyond 20 kpc from the galactic center exhibit strongersubstructure than at $\rm r_{gc} &lt; 20$ kpc.

1012.1580	mapping the asymmetric thick disk: iii. the kinematics and interaction  with the galactic bar	in the first two papers of this series, larsen et al (2010a,b) describe ourfaint ccd survey in the inner galaxy and map the over-density of thick diskstars in quadrant i (q1) to 5 kpc or more along the line of sight. the regionsshowing the strongest excess are above the density contours of the bar in thegalactic disk. in this third paper on the asymmetric thick disk, we report onradial velocities and derived metallicity parameters for over 4000 stars in q1,above and below the plane and in q4 above the plane. we confirm thecorresponding kinematic asymmetry first reported by parker et al. (2004),extended to greater distances and with more spatial coverage. the thick diskstars in q1 have a rotational lag of 60 -- 70 km/s relative to circularrotation, and the metal-weak thick disk stars have an even greater lag of 100km/s. both lag their corresponding populations in q4 by approximately 30 km/s.interestingly, the disk stars in q1 also appear to participate in therotational lag by about 30 km/s. the enhanced rotational lag for the thick diskin q1 extends to 4 kpc or more from the sun. at 3 to 4 kpc, our sight linesextend above the density contours on the near side of the bar, and as our linesof sight pass directly over the bar the rotational lag appears to decrease.this is consistent with a "gravitational wake" induced by the rotating bar inthe disk which would trap and pile up stars behind it. we conclude that adynamical interaction with the stellar bar is the most probable explanation forthe observed kinematic and spatial asymmetries.

1104.1424	insight into the formation of the milky way through cold halo  substructure. ii. the elemental abundances of echos	we determine the average metallicities of the elements of cold halosubstructure (echos) that we previously identified in the inner halo of themilky way within 17.5 kpc of the sun. as a population, we find that starskinematically associated with echos are chemically distinct from the backgroundkinematically smooth inner halo stellar population along the same sloanextension for galactic understanding and exploration (segue) line of sight.echos are systematically more iron-rich, but less alpha-enhanced than thekinematically-smooth component of the inner halo. echos are also chemicallydistinct from other milky way components: more iron-poor than typicalthick-disk stars and both more iron-poor and alpha-enhanced than typicalthin-disk stars. in addition, the radial velocity dispersion distribution ofechos extends beyond sigma ~ 20 km s^-1. globular clusters are unlikely echosprogenitors, as echos have large velocity dispersions and are found in a regionof the galaxy in which iron-rich globular clusters are very rare. likewise, thechemical composition of stars in echos do not match predictions for starsformed in the milky way and subsequently scattered into the inner halo. dwarfspheroidal (dsph) galaxies are possible echos progenitors, and if echos areformed through the tidal disruption of one or more dsph galaxies, the typicalechos [fe/h] ~ -1.0 and radial velocity dispersion sigma ~ 20 km s^-1 implies adsph with m_tot &gt;~ 10^9 m_sun. our observations confirm the predictions oftheoretical models of milky way halo formation that suggest that prominentsubstructures are likely to be metal-rich, and our result implies that the mostlikely metallicity for a recently accreted star currently in the inner halo is[fe/h] ~ -1.0.

1104.2513	the case for the dual halo of the milky way	carollo et al. have recently resolved the stellar population of the milky wayhalo into at least two distinct components, an inner halo and an outer halo.this result has been criticized by schoenrich et al., who claim that theretrograde signature associated with the outer halo is due to the adoption offaulty distances. we refute this claim, and demonstrate that the schoenrich etal. photometric distances are themselves flawed because they adopted anincorrect main-sequence absolute magnitude relationship from the work ofivezi\'c et al. when compared to the recommended relation from ivezi\'c et al.,which is tied to a milky way globular cluster distance scale and accounts forage and metallicity effects, the relation adopted by schoenrich et al. yieldsup to 18% shorter distances for stars near the main-sequence turnoff (to). useof the correct relationship yields agreement between the distances assigned bycarollo et al. and ivezi\'{c} et al. for low-metallicity dwarfs to within6-10%. schoenrich et al. also point out that intermediate-gravity stars (3.5 &lt;=log g &lt;= 4.0) with colors redder than the to region are likely misclassified,with which we concur. we implement a new procedure to reassign luminosityclassifications for the to stars that require it. new derivations of therotational behavior demonstrate that the retrograde signature and high velocitydispersion of the outer-halo population remains. we summarize additional linesof evidence for a dual halo, including a test of the retrograde signature basedon proper motions alone, and conclude that the preponderance of evidencestrongly rejects the single-halo interpretation.

1104.3114	formation and evolution of the disk system of the milky way: [alpha/fe]  ratios and kinematics of the segue g-dwarf sample	we employ measurements of the [alpha/fe] ratio derived from low-resolution(r~2000) spectra of 17,277 g-type dwarfs from the segue survey to separate theminto likely thin- and thick-disk subsamples. both subsamples exhibit stronggradients of orbital rotational velocity with metallicity, of opposite signs,-20 to -30 km/s/dex for the thin-disk and +40 to +50 km/s/dex for thethick-disk population. the rotational velocity is uncorrelated withgalactocentric distance for the thin-disk subsample, and exhibits a small trendfor the thick-disk subsample. the rotational velocity decreases with distancefrom the plane for both disk components, with similar slopes (-9.0 {\pm} 1.0km/s/kpc). thick-disk stars exhibit a strong trend of orbital eccentricity withmetallicity (about -0.2/dex), while the eccentricity does not change withmetallicity for the thin-disk subsample. the eccentricity is almost independentof galactocentric radius for the thin-disk population, while a marginalgradient of the eccentricity with radius exists for the thick-disk population.both subsamples possess similar positive gradients of eccentricity withdistance from the galactic plane. the shapes of the eccentricity distributionsfor the thin- and thick-disk populations are independent of distance from theplane, and include no significant numbers of stars with eccentricity above 0.6.among several contemporary models of disk evolution we consider, radialmigration appears to have played an important role in the evolution of thethin-disk population, but possibly less so for the thick disk, relative to thegas-rich merger or disk heating scenarios. we emphasize that more physicallyrealistic models and simulations need to be constructed in order to carry outthe detailed quantitative comparisons that our new data enable.

1109.3993	searches for metal-poor stars from the hamburg/eso survey using the ch  g-band	we describe a new method to search for metal-poor candidates from thehamburg/eso objective-prism survey (hes) based on identifying stars withapparently strong ch g-band strengths for their colors. the hypothesis weexploit is that large over-abundances of carbon are common among metal-poorstars. the selection was made by considering two line indices in the 4300aregion, applied directly to the low-resolution prism spectra. this work alsoextends a previously published method by adding bright sources to the sample.the spectra of these stars suffer from saturation effects, compromising theindex calculations and leading to an undersampling of the brighter candidates.visual inspection and classification of the spectra from the hes plates yieldeda list of 5,288 new metal-poor candidates, which are presently being used astargets for medium-resolution spectroscopic follow-up. estimates of the stellaratmospheric parameters, as well as carbon abundances, are now available for 117of the first candidates, based on follow-up medium-resolution spectra obtainedwith the soar 4.1m and gemini 8m telescopes. we demonstrate that our new methodimproves the metal-poor star fractions found by our pilot study by up to afactor of three in the same magnitude range, as compared with our pilot studybased on only one ch g-band index. our selection scheme obtained roughly a 40%success rate for identification of stars with [fe/h] &lt; -1.0; the primarycontaminant is late-type stars with near solar abundances and, often, emissionline cores that filled in the caii k line on the prism spectrum. because theselection is based on carbon, we greatly increase the numbers of known cempstars from the hes with intermediate metallicities -2.0 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -1.0, whichprevious survey efforts undersampled. there are eight newly discovered starswith [fe/h] &lt; -3.0 in our sample, including two with [fe/h] &lt; -3.5.

1110.5933	metallicity gradients in the milky way disk as observed by the segue  survey	the observed radial and vertical metallicity distribution of old stars in themilky way disk provides a powerful constraint on the chemical enrichment anddynamical history of the disk. we present the radial metallicity gradient,\delta[fe/h]/\delta r, as a function of height above the plane, |z|, using 7010main sequence turnoff stars observed by the sloan extension for galacticunderstanding and exploration (segue) survey. the sample consists of mostly oldthin and thick disk stars, with a minimal contribution from the stellar halo,in the region 6 &lt; r &lt; 16 kpc, 0.15 &lt; |z| &lt; 1.5 kpc. the data reveal that theradial metallicity gradient becomes flat at heights |z| &gt; 1 kpc. the medianmetallicity at large |z| is consistent with the metallicities seen in outerdisk open clusters, which exhibit a flat radial gradient at [fe/h] ~ -0.5. wenote that the outer disk clusters are also located at large |z|; because theflat gradient extends to small r for our sample, there is some ambiguity inwhether the observed trends for clusters are due to a change in r or |z|. wetherefore stress the importance of considering both the radial and verticaldirections when measuring spatial abundance trends in the disk. the flatteningof the gradient at high |z| also has implications on thick disk formationscenarios, which predict different metallicity patterns in the thick disk. aflat gradient, such as we observe, is predicted by a turbulent disk at highredshift, but may also be consistent with radial migration, as long as mixingis strong. we test our analysis methods using a mock catalog based on the modelof sch\"onrich &amp; binney, and we estimate our distance errors to be ~25%. wealso show that we can properly correct for selection biases by assigningweights to our targets.

1111.1724	the spatial structure of mono-abundance sub-populations of the milky way  disk	the spatial, kinematic, and elemental-abundance structure of the milky way'sstellar disk is complex, and has been difficult to dissect with localspectroscopic or global photometric data. here, we develop and apply a rigorousdensity modeling approach for galactic spectroscopic surveys that enablesinvestigation of the global spatial structure of stellar sub-populations innarrow bins of [\alpha/fe] and [fe/h], using 23,767 g-type dwarfs fromsdss/segue. we fit models for the number density of each such mono-abundancecomponent, properly accounting for the complex spectroscopic segue sampling ofthe underlying stellar population. we find that each mono-abundancesub-population has a simple spatial structure that can be described by a singleexponential in both the vertical and radial direction, with continuouslyincreasing scale heights (~200 pc to 1 kpc) and decreasing scale lengths (&gt;4.5kpc to 2 kpc) for increasingly older sub-populations, as indicated by theirlower metallicities and [\alpha/fe] enhancements. that the abundance-selectedsub-components with the largest scale heights have the shortest scale lengthsis in sharp contrast with purely geometric `thick--thin disk' decompositions.to the extent that [\alpha/fe] is an adequate proxy for age, our resultsdirectly show that older disk sub-populations are more centrally concentrated,which implies inside-out formation of galactic disks. the fact that the largestscale-height sub-components are most centrally concentrated in the milky way isan almost inevitable consequence of explaining the vertical structure of thedisk through internal evolution. whether the simple spatial structure of themono-abundance sub-components, and the striking correlations between age, scalelength, and scale height can be plausibly explained by satellite accretion orother external heating remains to be seen.

1201.5898	signatures of minor mergers in the milky way disc i: the segue stellar  sample	it is now known that minor mergers are capable of creating structure in thephase-space distribution of their host galaxy's disc. in order to search forsuch imprints in the milky way, we analyse the segue f/g-dwarf and the schusteret al. (2006) stellar samples. we find similar features in these two completelyindependent stellar samples, consistent with the predictions of a milky wayminor-merger event. we next apply the same analyses to high-resolution,idealised n-body simulations of the interaction between the sagittarius dwarfgalaxy and the milky way. the energy distributions of stellar particle samplesin small spatial regions in the host disc reveal strong variations of structurewith position. we find good matches to the observations for models with a massof sagittarius' dark matter halo progenitor $\lessapprox 10^{11}$ m$_{\odot}$.thus, we show that this kind of analysis could be used to provideunprecedentedly tight constraints on sagittarius' orbital parameters, as wellas place a lower limit on its mass.

1202.2360	insight into the formation of the milky way through cold halo  substructure. iii. statistical chemical tagging in the smooth halo	we find that the relative contribution of satellite galaxies accreted at highredshift to the stellar population of the milky way's smooth halo increaseswith distance, becoming observable relative to the classical smooth halo about15 kpc from the galactic center. in particular, we determineline-of-sight-averaged [fe/h] and [alpha/fe] in the metal-poor main-sequenceturnoff (mpmsto) population along every sloan extension for galacticunderstanding and exploration (segue) spectroscopic line of sight. restrictingour sample to those lines of sight along which we do not detect elements ofcold halo substructure (echos), we compile the largest spectroscopic sample ofstars in the smooth component of the halo ever observed in situ beyond 10 kpc.we find significant spatial autocorrelation in [fe/h] in the mpmsto populationin the distant half of our sample beyond about 15 kpc from the galactic center.inside of 15 kpc however, we find no significant spatial autocorrelation in[fe/h]. at the same time, we perform segue-like observations of n-bodysimulations of milky way analog formation. while we find that halos formedentirely by accreted satellite galaxies provide a poor match to ourobservations of the halo within 15 kpc of the galactic center, we do observespatial autocorrelation in [fe/h] in the simulations at larger distances. thisobservation is an example of statistical chemical tagging and indicates thatspatial autocorrelation in metallicity is a generic feature of stellar halosformed from accreted satellite galaxies.

1202.2819	the vertical motions of mono-abundance sub-populations in the milky way  disk	we present the vertical kinematics of stars in the milky way's stellar diskinferred from sdss/segue g-dwarf data, deriving the vertical velocitydispersion, \sigma_z, as a function of vertical height |z| and galactocentricradius r for a set of 'mono-abundance' sub-populations of stars with verysimilar elemental abundances [\alpha/fe] and [fe/h]. we find that allcomponents exhibit nearly isothermal kinematics in |z|, and a slow outwarddecrease of the vertical velocity dispersion: \sigma_z (z,r|[\alpha/fe],[fe/h])~ \sigma_z ([\alpha/fe],[fe/h]) x \exp (-(r-r_0)/7 kpc}). the characteristicvelocity dispersions of these components vary from ~ 15 km/s for chemicallyyoung, metal-rich stars, to &gt;~ 50 km/s for metal poor stars. the mean \sigma_zgradient away from the mid plane is only 0.3 +/- 0.2 km/s/kpc. we find acontinuum of vertical kinetic temperatures (~\sigma^2_z) as function of([\alpha/fe],[fe/h]), which contribute to the stellar surface mass density as\sigma_{r_0}(\sigma^2_z) ~ \exp(-\sigma^2_z). the existence of isothermalmono-abundance populations with intermediate dispersions reject the notion of athin-thick disk dichotomy. this continuum of disks argues against models wherethe thicker disk portions arise from massive satellite infall or heating;scenarios where either the oldest disk portion was born hot, or where internalevolution plays a major role, seem the most viable. the wide range of \sigma_z([\alpha/fe],[fe/h]) combined with a constant \sigma_z(z) for each abundancebin provides an independent check on the precision of the segue abundances:\delta_[\alpha/fe] ~ 0.07 dex and \delta_[fe/h] ~ 0.15 dex. the radial declineof the vertical dispersion presumably reflects the decrease in disksurface-mass density. this measurement constitutes a first step toward a purelydynamical estimate of the mass profile the disk in our galaxy.

1211.0549	the segue k giant survey ii: a catalog of distance determinations for  the segue k giants in the galactic halo	we present an online catalog of distance determinations for $\rm 6036$ kgiants, most of which are members of the milky way's stellar halo. theirmedium-resolution spectra from sdss/segue are used to derive metallicities andrough gravity estimates, along with radial velocities. distance moduli arederived from a comparison of each star's apparent magnitude with the absolutemagnitude of empirically calibrated color-luminosity fiducials, at the observed$(g-r)_0$ color and spectroscopic [fe/h]. we employ a probabilistic approachthat makes it straightforward to properly propagate the errors inmetallicities, magnitudes, and colors into distance uncertainties. we also foldin ${\it prior}$ information about the giant-branch luminosity function and thedifferent metallicity distributions of the segue k-giant targetingsub-categories. we show that the metallicity prior plays a small role in thedistance estimates, but that neglecting the luminosity prior could lead to asystematic distance modulus bias of up to 0.25 mag, compared to the case ofusing the luminosity prior. we find a median distance precision of $16\%$, withdistance estimates most precise for the least metal-poor stars near the tip ofthe red-giant branch. the precision and accuracy of our distance estimates arevalidated with observations of globular and open clusters. the stars in ourcatalog are up to 125 kpc distant from the galactic center, with 283 starsbeyond 50 kpc, forming the largest available spectroscopic sample of distanttracers in the galactic halo.

0712.0776	identification of rr lyrae variables in sdss from single-epoch  photometric and spectroscopic observations	we describe a new rr lyrae identification technique based on out-of-phasesingle-epoch photometric and spectroscopic observations contained in sdss datarelease 6 (dr-6). this technique detects variability by exploiting the largedisparity between the g-r color and the strength of the hydrogen balmer lineswhen the two observations are made at random phases. comparison with a largesample of known variables in the sdss equatorial stripe (stripe 82) shows thatthe discovery efficiency for our technique is ~85%. analysis of stars withmultiple spectroscopic observations suggests a similar efficiency throughoutthe entire dr-6 sample. we also develop a technique to estimate the average gapparent magnitude (over the pulsation cycle) for individual rr lyrae stars,using the &lt;g-r&gt; for the entire sample and measured colors for each star. theresulting distances are found to have precisions of ~14%. finally, we explorethe properties of our dr-6 sample of n = 1087 variables, and recover portionsof the sagittarius northern and southern stream. analysis of the distance andvelocity for the southern stream are consistent with previously published datafor blue horizontal-branch stars. in a sample near the north galactic polarcap, we find evidence for the descending leading northern arm, and a possibledetection of the trailing arm.

1211.7073	the stellar metallicity distribution function of the galactic halo from  sdss photometry	we explore the stellar metallicity distribution function of the galactic halobased on sdss ugriz photometry. a set of stellar isochrones is calibrated usingobservations of several star clusters and validated by comparisons withmedium-resolution spectroscopic values over a wide range of metal abundance. weestimate distances and metallicities for individual main-sequence stars in themultiply scanned sdss stripe 82, at heliocentric distances in the range 5 - 8kpc and |b| &gt; 35 deg, and find that the in situ photometric metallicitydistribution has a shape that matches that of the kinematically-selected localhalo stars from ryan &amp; norris. we also examine independent kinematicinformation from proper-motion measurements for high galactic latitude stars inour sample. we find that stars with retrograde rotation in the rest frame ofthe galaxy are generally more metal poor than those exhibiting prograderotation, which is consistent with earlier arguments by carollo et al. that thehalo system comprises at least two spatially overlapping components withdiffering metallicity, kinematics, and spatial distributions. the observedphotometric metallicity distribution and that of ryan &amp; norris can be describedby a simple chemical evolution model by hartwick (or by a single gaussiandistribution); however, the suggestive metallicity-kinematic correlationcontradicts the basic assumption in this model that the milky way halo consistsprimarily of a single stellar population. when the observed metallicitydistribution is deconvolved using two gaussian components with peaks at [fe/h]~ -1.7 and -2.3, the metal-poor component accounts for ~20% - 35% of the entirehalo population in this distance range.

1212.4296	very metal-poor outer-halo stars with round orbits	the orbital motions of halo stars in the milky way reflect the orbitalmotions of the progenitor systems in which they formed, making it possible totrace the mass-assembly history of the galaxy. direct measurement ofthree-dimensional velocities, based on accurate proper motions andline-of-sight velocities, has revealed that the majority of halo stars in theinner-halo region move on eccentric orbits. however, our understanding of themotions of distant, in-situ halo-star samples is still limited, due to the lackof accurate proper motions for these stars. here we explore a model-independentanalysis of the line-of-sight velocities and spatial distribution of a recentsample of 1865 carefully selected halo blue horizontal-branch (bhb) starswithin 30 kpc of the galactic center. we find that the mean rotational velocityof the very metal-poor ([fe/h] &lt; -2.0) bhb stars significantly lags behind thatof the relatively more metal-rich ([fe/h] &gt; -2.0) bhb stars. we also find thatthe relatively more metal-rich bhb stars are dominated by stars with eccentricorbits, as previously observed for other stellar samples in the inner-haloregion. by contrast, the very metal-poor bhb stars are dominated by stars onrounder, lower-eccentricity orbits. our results indicate that the motion of theprogenitor systems of the milky way that contributed to the stellar populationsfound within 30 kpc correlates directly with their metal abundance, which maybe related to their physical properties such as gas fractions. these resultsare consistent with the existence of an inner/outer halo structure for the halosystem, as advocated by carollo et al. (2010).

0801.4187	carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars. iii. main-sequence turn-off stars from  the sdss/segue sample	the chemical compositions of seven carbon-enhanced metal-poor (cemp) turn-offstars are determined from high-resolution spectroscopy. five of them areselected from the sdss/segue sample of metal-poor stars. the effectivetemperatures of these objects are all higher than 6000 k, while theirmetallicities, parametrized by [fe/h], are all below -2. six of our programobjects exhibit high abundance ratios of barium ([ba/h]&gt; +1), suggesting largecontributions of the products of former agb companions via mass transfer acrossbinary systems. combining our results with previous studies provides a total of20 cemp main-sequence turn-off stars for which the abundances of carbon and atleast some neutron-capture elements are determined. inspection of the [c/h]ratios for this sample of cemp turn-off stars show that they are generallyhigher than those of cemp giants; their dispersion in this ratio is alsosmaller. we take these results to indicate that the carbon-enhanced materialprovided from the companion agb star is preserved at the surface of turn-offstars with no significant dilution. in contrast, a large dispersion in theobserved [ba/h] is found for the sample of cemp turn-off stars, suggesting thatthe efficiency of the s-process in very metal-poor agb stars may differ greatlyfrom star to star. four of the six stars from the sdss/segue sample exhibitkinematics that are associated with membership in the outer-halo population, aremarkably high fraction.

1310.3276	carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars in sdss/segue. i. carbon abundance  estimation and frequency of cemp stars	we describe a method for the determination of stellar [c/fe] abundance ratiosusing low-resolution (r = 2000) stellar spectra from the sdss and segue. bymeans of a star-by-star comparison with a set of sdss/segue spectra withavailable estimates of [c/fe] based on published high-resolution analyses, wedemonstrate that we can measure [c/fe] from sdss/segue spectra with s/n &gt; 15 toa precision better than 0.35 dex. using the measured carbon-to-iron abundanceratios obtained by this technique, we derive the frequency of carbon-enhancedstars ([c/fe] &gt; +0.7) as a function of [fe/h], for both the sdss/segue starsand other samples from the literature. we find that the differential frequencyslowly rises from almost zero to about 14% at [fe/h] ~ -2.4, followed by asudden increase, by about a factor of three, to 39% from [fe/h] ~ -2.4 to[fe/h] ~ -3.7. we also examine how the cumulative frequency of cemp starsvaries across different luminosity classes. the giant sample exhibits acumulative cemp frequency of 32% for [fe/h] &lt; -2.5, 31% for [fe/h] &lt; -3.0, and33% for [fe/h] &lt; -3.5. for the main-sequence turnoff stars, we obtain a lowercumulative cemp frequency, around 10% for [fe/h] &lt; -2.5. the dwarf populationdisplays a large change in the cumulative frequency for cemp stars below [fe/h]= -2.5, jumping from 15% for [fe/h] &lt; -2.5 to about 75% for [fe/h] &lt; -3.0. whenwe impose a restriction with respect to distance from the galactic mid-plane(|z| &lt; 5 kpc), the frequency of the cemp giants does not increase at lowmetallicity ([fe/h] &lt; -2.5), but rather, decreases, due to the dilution ofc-rich material in stars that have undergone mixing with cno-processed materialfrom their interiors. the frequency of cemp stars near the main-sequenceturnoff, which are not expected to have experienced mixing, increases for[fe/h] &lt; -3.0.

1311.4569	chemical cartography with apogee: large-scale mean metallicity maps of  the milky way	we present galactic mean metallicity maps derived from the first year of thesdss-iii apogee experiment. mean abundances in different zones ofgalactocentric radius (0 &lt; r &lt; 15 kpc) at a range of heights above the plane (0&lt; |z| &lt; 3 kpc), are derived from a sample of nearly 20,000 stars withunprecedented coverage, including stars in the galactic mid-plane at largedistances. we also split the sample into subsamples of stars with low andhigh-[{\alpha}/m] abundance ratios. we assess possible biases in deriving themean abundances, and find they are likely to be small except in the innerregions of the galaxy. a negative radial gradient exists over much of thegalaxy; however, the gradient appears to flatten for r &lt; 6 kpc, in particularnear the galactic mid-plane and for low-[{\alpha}/m] stars. at r &gt; 6 kpc, thegradient flattens as one moves off of the plane, and is flatter at all heightsfor high-[{\alpha}/m] stars than for low-[{\alpha}/m] stars. alternatively,these gradients can be described as vertical gradients that flatten at largergalactocentric radius; these vertical gradients are similar for both low andhigh-[{\alpha}/m] populations. stars with higher [{\alpha}/m] appear to have aflatter radial gradient than stars with lower [{\alpha}/m]. this could suggestthat the metallicity gradient has grown steeper with time or, alternatively,that gradients are washed out over time by migration of stars.

1402.4251	possible evidence for metal accretion onto the surfaces of metal-poor  main-sequence stars	the entire evolution of the milky way, including its mass-assembly andstar-formation history, is imprinted onto the chemo-dynamical distributionfunction of its member stars, f(x, v, [x/h]), in the multi-dimensional phasespace spanned by position, velocity, and elemental abundance ratios. inparticular, the chemo-dynamical distribution functions for low-mass stars(e.g., g- or k-type dwarfs) are precious tracers of the earliest stages of themilky way's formation, since their main-sequence lifetimes approach or exceedthe age of the universe. a basic tenet of essentially all previous analyses isthat the stellar metallicity, usually parametrized as [fe/h], is conserved overtime for main-sequence stars (at least those that have not been polluted due tomass transfer from binary companions). if this holds true, any correlationsbetween metallicity and kinematics for long-lived main-sequence stars ofdifferent masses, effective temperatures, or spectral types must strictly bethe same, since they reflect the same mass-assembly and star-formationhistories. by analyzing a sample of nearby metal-poor halo and thick-disk starson the main sequence, taken from data release 8 of the sloan digital skysurvey, we find that the median metallicity of g-type dwarfs is systematicallyhigher (by about 0.2 dex) than that of k-type dwarfs having the same medianrotational velocity about the galactic center. if it can be confirmed, thisfinding may invalidate the long-accepted assumption that the atmosphericmetallicities of long-lived stars are conserved over time.

1405.6724	the vertical metallicity gradient of the milky way disk: transitions in  [a/fe] populations	using g dwarfs from the sloan extension for galactic understanding andexploration (segue) survey, we have determined a vertical metallicity gradientover a large volume of the milky way's disk, and examined how this gradientvaries for different [a/fe] subsamples. this sample contains over 40,000 starswith low-resolution spectroscopy over 144 lines of sight. we employ the seguestellar parameter pipeline (sspp) to obtain estimates of effective temperature,surface gravity, [fe/h], and [a/fe] for each star and extract multiplevolume-complete subsamples of approximately 1000 stars each. based on thesurvey's consistent target-selection algorithm, we adjust each subsample todetermine an unbiased picture of the disk in [fe/h] and [a/fe]; consequently,each individual star represents the properties of many. the segue sample allowsus to constrain the vertical metallicity gradient for a large number of starsover a significant volume of the disk, between ~0.3 and 1.6 kpc from thegalactic plane, and examine the in situ structure, in contrast to previousanalyses which are more limited in scope. this work does not pre-suppose a diskstructure, whether composed of a single complex population or a distinct thinand thick disk component. the metallicity gradient is -0.243 +0.039 -0.053dex/kpc for the sample as a whole, which we compare to various literatureresults. each [a/fe] subsample dominates at a different range of heights abovethe plane of the galaxy, which is exhibited in the gradient found in the sampleas a whole. stars over a limited range in [a/fe] show little change in median[fe/h] with height. if we associate [a/fe] with age, our consistent verticalmetallicity gradients with [a/fe] suggest that stars formed in different epochsexhibit comparable vertical structure, implying similar star-formationprocesses and evolution.

1501.00963	the eleventh and twelfth data releases of the sloan digital sky survey:  final data from sdss-iii	the third generation of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss-iii) took datafrom 2008 to 2014 using the original sdss wide-field imager, the original andan upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a new near-infraredhigh-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical interferometer. all the datafrom sdss-iii are now made public. in particular, this paper describes datarelease 11 (dr11) including all data acquired through 2013 july, and datarelease 12 (dr12) adding data acquired through 2014 july (including all dataincluded in previous data releases), marking the end of sdss-iii observing.relative to our previous public release (dr10), dr12 adds one million newspectra of galaxies and quasars from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples thenumber of h-band spectra of stars as part of the apache point observatory (apo)galactic evolution experiment (apogee), and includes repeated accurate radialvelocity measurements of 5500 stars from the multi-object apo radial velocityexoplanet large-area survey (marvels). the apogee outputs now include measuredabundances of 15 different elements for each star. in total, sdss-iii added2350 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of thesloan exploration of galactic understanding and evolution 2 (segue-2) survey;2,497,484 boss spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 apogee spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040marvels spectra of 5,513 stars. since its first light in 1998, sdss has imagedover 1/3 of the celestial sphere in five bands and obtained over five millionastronomical spectra.

1501.03559	the frequency of field blue-straggler stars in the thick disk and halo  system of the galaxy	we present an analysis of a new, large sample of field blue-straggler stars(bsss) in the thick disk and halo system of the galaxy, based on stellarspectra obtained during the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the sloanextension for galactic understanding and exploration (segue). using estimatesof stellar atmospheric parameters obtained from application of the seguestellar parameter pipeline, we obtain a sample of some 8000 bsss, which areconsidered along with a previously selected sample of some 4800 bluehorizontal-branch (bhb) stars. we derive the ratio of bsss to bhb stars,f$_{\rm bss/bhb}$, as a function of galactocentric distance and distance fromthe galactic plane. the maximum value found for f$_{\rm bss/bhb}$ is $\sim~$4.0in the thick disk (at 3 kpc $&lt;$ $|$z$|$ $&lt;$ 4 kpc), declining to on the orderof $\sim~1.5-2.0$ in the inner-halo region; this ratio continues to decline to$\sim~$1.0 in the outer-halo region. we associate a minority of field bsss witha likely extragalactic origin; at least 5$\%$ of the bss sample exhibit radialvelocities, positions, and distances commensurate with membership in thesagittarius stream.

1501.05500	spectro-photometric distances to stars: a general-purpose bayesian  approach	we developed a code that estimates distances to stars using measuredspectroscopic and photometric quantities. we employ a bayesian approach tobuild the probability distribution function over stellar evolutionary modelsgiven these data, delivering estimates of model parameters for each starindividually. the code was first tested on simulations, successfully recoveringinput distances to mock stars with &lt;1% bias.the method-intrinsic randomdistance uncertainties for typical spectroscopic survey measurements amount toaround 10% for dwarf stars and 20\% for giants, and are most sensitive to thequality of $\log g$ measurements. the code was validated by comparing ourdistance estimates to parallax measurements from the hipparcos mission fornearby stars (&lt; 300 pc), to asteroseismic distances of corot red giant stars,and to known distances of well-studied open and globular clusters. the externalcomparisons confirm that our distances are subject to very small systematicbiases with respect to the fundamental hipparcos scale (+0.4 % for dwarfs, and+1.6% for giants). the typical random distance scatter is 18% for dwarfs, and26% for giants. for the corot-apogee sample, the typical random distancescatter is ~15%, both for the nearby and farther data. our distances aresystematically larger than the corot ones by about +9%, which can mostly beattributed to the different choice of priors. the comparison to known distancesof star clusters from segue and apogee has led to significant systematicdifferences for many cluster stars, but with opposite signs, and withsubstantial scatter. finally, we tested our distances against those previouslydetermined for a high-quality sample of giant stars from the rave survey, againfinding a small systematic trend of +5% and an rms scatter of 30%.

1501.06908	carbon in red giants in globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies	we present carbon abundances of red giants in milky way globular clusters anddwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs). our sample includes measurements of carbonabundances for 154 giants in the clusters ngc 2419, m68, and m15 and 398 giantsin the dsphs sculptor, fornax, ursa minor, and draco. this sample doubles thenumber of dsph stars with measurements of [c/fe]. the [c/fe] ratio in theclusters decreases with increasing luminosity above log(l/l_sun) ~= 1.6, whichcan be explained by deep mixing in evolved giants. the same decrease isobserved in dsphs, but the initial [c/fe] of the dsph giants is not uniform.stars in dsphs at lower metallicities have larger [c/fe] ratios. we hypothesizethat [c/fe] (corrected to the initial carbon abundance) declines withincreasing [fe/h] due to the metallicity dependence of the carbon yield ofasymptotic giant branch stars and due to the increasing importance of type iasupernovae at higher metallicities. we also identified 11 very carbon-richgiants (8 previously known) in three dsphs. however, our selection biasespreclude a detailed comparison to the carbon-enhanced fraction of the milky waystellar halo. nonetheless, the stars with [c/fe] &lt; +1 in dsphs follow adifferent [c/fe] track with [fe/h] than the halo stars. specifically, [c/fe] indsphs begins to decline at lower [fe/h] than in the halo. the difference in themetallicity of the [c/fe] "knee" adds to the evidence from [alpha/fe]distributions that the progenitors of the halo had a shorter timescale forchemical enrichment than the surviving dsphs.

0804.3850	the milky way tomography with sdss: ii. stellar metallicity	using effective temperature and metallicity derived from sdss spectra for~60,000 f and g type main sequence stars (0.2&lt;g-r&lt;0.6), we develop polynomialmodels for estimating these parameters from the sdss u-g and g-r colors. weapply this method to sdss photometric data for about 2 million f/g stars andmeasure the unbiased metallicity distribution for a complete volume-limitedsample of stars at distances between 500 pc and 8 kpc. the metallicitydistribution can be exquisitely modeled using two components with a spatiallyvarying number ratio, that correspond to disk and halo. the two components alsopossess the kinematics expected for disk and halo stars. the metallicity of thehalo component is spatially invariant, while the median disk metallicitysmoothly decreases with distance from the galactic plane from -0.6 at 500 pc to-0.8 beyond several kpc. the absence of a correlation between metallicity andkinematics for disk stars is in a conflict with the traditional decompositionin terms of thin and thick disks. we detect coherent substructures in thekinematics--metallicity space, such as the monoceros stream, which rotatesfaster than the lsr, and has a median metallicity of [fe/h]=-0.96, with an rmsscatter of only ~0.15 dex. we extrapolate our results to the performanceexpected from the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst) and estimate that thelsst will obtain metallicity measurements accurate to 0.2 dex or better, withproper motion measurements accurate to ~0.2 mas/yr, for about 200 million f/gdwarf stars within a distance limit of ~100 kpc (g&lt;23.5).

1503.09133	the segue k giant survey. iii. quantifying galactic halo substructure	we statistically quantify the amount of substructure in the milky way stellarhalo using a sample of 4568 halo k giant stars at galactocentric distancesranging over 5-125 kpc. these stars have been selected photometrically andconfirmed spectroscopically as k giants from the sloan digital sky survey'ssegue project. using a position-velocity clustering estimator (the 4distance)and a model of a smooth stellar halo, we quantify the amount of substructure inthe halo, divided by distance and metallicity. overall, we find that the haloas a whole is highly structured. we also confirm earlier work using bhb starswhich showed that there is an increasing amount of substructure with increasinggalactocentric radius, and additionally find that the amount of substructure inthe halo increases with increasing metallicity. comparing to resampled bhbstars, we find that k giants and bhbs have similar amounts of substructure overequivalent ranges of galactocentric radius. using a friends-of-friendsalgorithm to identify members of individual groups, we find that a largefraction (~33%) of grouped stars are associated with sgr, and identify starsbelonging to other halo star streams: the orphan stream, the cetus polarstream, and others, including previously unknown substructures. a largefraction of sample k giants (more than 50%) are not grouped into anysubstructure. we find also that the sgr stream strongly dominates groups in theouter halo for all except the most metal-poor stars, and suggest that this isthe source of the increase of substructure with galactocentric radius andmetallicity.

1507.03656	metal-poor stars observed with the magellan telescope. iii. new  extremely and ultra metal-poor stars from sdss/segue and insights on the  formation of ultra metal-poor stars	we report the discovery of one extremely metal-poor (emp; [fe/h]&lt;-3) and oneultra metal-poor (ump; [fe/h]&lt;-4) star selected from the sdss/segue survey.these stars were identified as emp candidates based on their medium-resolution(r~2,000) spectra, and were followed-up with high-resolution (r~35,000)spectroscopy with the magellan-clay telescope. their derived chemicalabundances exhibit good agreement with those of stars with similarmetallicities. we also provide new insights on the formation of the ump stars,based on comparison with a new set of theoretical models of supernovaenucleosynthesis. the models were matched with 20 ump stars found in theliterature, together with one of the program stars (sdss j1204+1201), with[fe/h]=-4.34. from fitting their abundances, we find that the supernovaeprogenitors, for stars where carbon and nitrogen are measured, had massesranging from 20.5 m_sun to 28 m_sun and explosion energies from 0.3 to0.9x10^51 erg. these results are highly sensitive to the carbon and nitrogenabundance determinations, which is one of the main drivers for futurehigh-resolution follow-up of ump candidates. in addition, we are able toreproduce the different cno abundance patterns found in ump stars with a singleprogenitor type, by varying its mass and explosion energy.

1510.07630	the fractions of inner- and outer-halo stars in the local volume	we obtain a new determination of the metallicity distribution function (mdf)of stars within $\sim5$-$10$ kpc of the sun, based on recently improved co-addsof $ugriz$ photometry for stripe 82 from the sloan digital sky survey. our newestimate uses the methodology developed previously by an et al. to study insitu halo stars, but is based on a factor of two larger sample than availablebefore, with much-improved photometric errors and zero-points. the newlyobtained mdf can be divided into multiple populations of halo stars, with peakmetallicities at [fe/h] $\approx -1.4$ and $-1.9$, which we associate with theinner-halo and outer-halo populations of the milky way, respectively. we findthat the kinematics of these stars (based on proper-motion measurements at highgalactic latitude) supports the proposed dichotomy of the halo, as stars withretrograde motions in the rest frame of the galaxy are generally moremetal-poor than stars with prograde motions, consistent with previous claims.in addition, we generate mock catalogs of stars from a simulated milk way halosystem, and demonstrate for the first time that the chemically- andkinematically-distinct properties of the inner- and outer-halo populations arequalitatively in agreement with our observations. the decomposition of theobserved mdf and our comparison with the mock catalog results suggest that theouter-halo population contributes on the order of $\sim35\%$-$55\%$ of halostars in the local volume.

0808.0001	galactic globular and open clusters in the sloan digital sky survey. i.  crowded field photometry and cluster fiducial sequences in ugriz	we present photometry for globular and open cluster stars observed with thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). in order to exploit over 100 million stellarobjects with r &lt; 22.5 mag observed by sdss, we need to understand thecharacteristics of stars in the sdss ugriz filters. while star clusters provideimportant calibration samples for stellar colors, the regions close to globularclusters, where the fraction of field stars is smallest, are too crowded forthe standard sdss photometric pipeline to process. to complement the sdssimaging survey, we reduce the sdss imaging data for crowded cluster fieldsusing the daophot/allframe suite of programs and present photometry for 17globular clusters and 3 open clusters in a sdss value-added catalog. ourphotometry and cluster fiducial sequences are on the native sdss 2.5-meterugriz photometric system, and the fiducial sequences can be directly applied tothe sdss photometry without relying upon any transformations. model photometryfor red giant branch and main-sequence stars obtained by girardi et al. cannotbe matched simultaneously to fiducial sequences; their colors differ by~0.02-0.05 mag. good agreement (&lt; ~0.02 mag in colors) is found with clem etal. empirical fiducial sequences in u'g'r'i'z' when using the transformationequations in tucker et al.

astro-ph;0508423	the metallicity distribution function of the halo of the milky way	we report on the distribution of metallicities, [fe/h], for very metal-poorstars in the halo of the galaxy. although the primary information on the natureof the metallicity distribution function (mdf) is obtained from the two majorrecent surveys for metal-poor stars, the hk survey of beers and collaborators,and the hamburg/eso survey of christlieb and collaborators, we also discuss themdf derived from the publicly available database of stellar spectra andphotometry contained in the third data release of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss dr-3). even though the sdss was not originally planned as a stellarsurvey, significant numbers of stars have been observed to date -- dr-3contains spectroscopy for over 70,000 stars, at least half of which aresuitable for abundance determinations. there are as many very metal-poor([fe/h] &lt; -2.0) stars in dr-3 as have been obtained from all previous surveyefforts combined. we also discuss prospects for significant expansion of thelist of metal-poor stars to be obtained from the recently funded extension ofthe sdss, which includes the project segue: sloan extension for galacticunderstanding and exploration.
