0902.4464	a submillimetre galaxy at z=4.76 in the laboca survey of the extended  chandra deep field south	we report on the identification of the highest redshift submm-selected sourcecurrently known: lessj033229.4-275619. this source was detected in the largeapex bolometer camera (laboca) extended chandra deep field south (ecdfs)submillimetre survey (less), a sensitive 870-um survey (~1.2-mjy rms) of thefull 30'x30' ecdfs with the laboca camera on the atacama pathfinder experiment(apex) telescope. the submm emission is identified with a radio counterpart forwhich optical spectroscopy provides a redshift of z=4.76. we show that thebolometric emission is dominated by a starburst with a star formation rate of~1000 msun/yr, although we also identify a moderate luminosity active galacticnucleus (agn) in this galaxy. thus it has characteristics similar to those ofz~2 submm galaxies (smgs), with a mix of starburst and obscured agn signatures.this demonstrates that ultraluminous starburst activity is not just restrictedto the hosts of the most luminous (and hence rare) qsos at z~5, but was alsooccurring in less extreme galaxies at a time when the universe was less than10% of its current age. assuming that we are seeing the major phase of starformation in this galaxy, then we demonstrate that it would be identified as aluminous distant red galaxy at z~3 and that the current estimate of the spacedensity of z&gt;4 smgs is only sufficient to produce ~10% of the luminous redgalaxy population at these early times. however, this leaves open thepossibility that some of these galaxies formed through less intense, but moreextended star formation events. if the progenitors of all of the luminous redgalaxies at z~3 go through an ultraluminous starburst at z&gt;4 then the requiredvolume density of z&gt;4 smgs will exceed that predicted by current galaxyformation models by more than an order of magnitude.

0911.4861	the hizels/ukirt large area survey for bright lyman-alpha emitters at  z~9	we present the largest area survey to date (1.4 deg2) for lyman-alphaemitters (laes) at z~9, as part of the hi-z emission line survey (hizels). thesurvey, which primarily targets h-alpha emitters at z &lt; 3, uses the wide fieldcamera on the united kingdom infrared telescope and a custom narrow-band filterin the j band to reach a lyman-alpha luminosity limit of ~10^43.8 erg/s over aco-moving volume of 1.12x10^6 mpc^3 at z = 8.96+-0.06. two candidates werefound out of 1517 line emitters, but those were rejected as laes afterfollow-up observations. this improves the limit on the space density of brightlyman-alpha emitters by 3 orders of magnitude and is consistent withsuppression of the bright end of the lyman-alpha luminosity function beyondz~6. combined with upper limits from smaller but deeper surveys, this rules outsome of the most extreme models for high-redshift lyman-alpha emitters. thepotential contamination of narrow-band lyman-alpha surveys at z&gt;7 by galacticbrown dwarf stars is also examined, leading to the conclusion that suchcontamination may well be significant for searches at 7.7 &lt; z &lt; 8.0, 9.1 &lt; z &lt;9.5 and 11.7 &lt; z &lt; 12.2.

0912.1591	gas, dust and stars in the scuba galaxy, smm j02399-0136: the evla  reveals a colossal galactic nursery	we present new multi-wavelength observations of the first submm-selectedgalaxy, smm j02399-0136 at z=2.8. these observations include mapping of the coj=1-0 emission using elements of the expanded vla, as well as high-resolution1.4-ghz imaging and optical/ir data from the vla, hst, spitzer and keck.together these new data provide fundamental insights into the mass anddistribution of stars, gas and dust within this archetypal smg. the co j=1-0emission, with its minimal excitation and density requirements, traces the bulkof the metal-rich molecular gas, and reveals a mass of ~10^11 m(sun), extendingover ~5" (~25 kpc in the source plane), although there is tentative evidencethat it may be significantly larger. our data suggest that three or moredistinct structures are encompassed by this molecular gas reservoir, includingthe bal quasar from which the redshift of the smg was initially determined. inparticular, the new rest-frame near-ir observations identify a massive,obscured, starburst coincident with a previously known ly-alpha cloud. thisstarburst dominates the far-ir emission from the system and requires are-assessment of previous claims that the gas reservoir resides in a massive,extended disk around the bal qso. instead it appears that smm j02399-0136comprises a merger between a far-ir-luminous, but highly obscured starburst,the bal qso host and a faint third component. our findings suggest that thissmg and its immediate environment mark a vast and complex galactic nursery andthat detailed studies of other smgs are likely to uncover a similarly richdiversity of properties.

1002.2518	a hubble space telescope nicmos and acs morphological study of z~2  submillimetre galaxies	we present a quantitative morphological analysis using hst nicmos h160- andacs i775- band imaging of 25 spectroscopically confirmed submillimetre galaxies(smgs) which have redshifts between z=0.7-3.4. our analysis also employs acomparison sample of more typical star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts(such as lbgs) which have lower far-infrared luminosities. this is the firstlarge-scale study of the morphologies of smgs in the near-infrared at ~0.1"resolution (&lt;1kpc). we find that the half light radii of the smgs(r_h=2.3+/-0.3 and 2.8+/-0.4kpc in the observed i- and h-bands respectively)and asymmetries are not statistically distinct from the comparison sample ofstar-forming galaxies. however, we demonstrate that the smg morphologies differmore between the rest-frame uv and optical-bands than typical star-forminggalaxies and interpret this as evidence for structured dust obscuration. weshow that the composite observed h-band light profile of smgs is better fitwith a sersic index with n~2, suggesting the stellar structure of smgs is bestdescribed by a spheroid/elliptical galaxy light distribution. we also comparethe sizes and stellar masses of smgs to local and high-redshift populations,and find that the smgs have stellar densities which are comparable to localearly-type galaxies, as well as luminous, red and dense galaxies at z~1.5 whichhave been proposed as direct smg descendants, although the smg stellar massesand sizes are systematically larger. overall, our results suggest that thephysical processes occuring within the galaxies are too complex to be simplycharacterised by the rest-frame uv/optical morphologies which appear to beessentially decoupled from all other observables, such as bolometricluminosity, stellar or dynamical mass.

1003.3674	intense star formation within resolved compact regions in a galaxy at  z=2.3	massive galaxies in the early universe have been shown to be forming stars atsurprisingly high rates. prominent examples are dust-obscured galaxies whichare luminous when observed at sub-millimeter (sub-mm) wavelengths and which maybe forming stars at rates upto 1,000mo/yr. these intense bursts of starformation are believed to be driven by mergers between gas rich galaxies.however, probing the properties of individual star-forming regions within thesegalaxies is beyond the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the largesttelescopes at present. here, we report observations of the sub-mm galaxysmmj2135-0102 at redshift z=2.3259 which has been gravitationally magnified bya factor of 32 by a massive foreground galaxy cluster lens. this cosmicmagnification, when combined with high-resolution sub-mm imaging, resolves thestar-forming regions at a linear scale of just ~100 parsecs. we find that theluminosity densities of these star-forming regions are comparable to the densecores of giant molecular clouds in the local universe, but they are ~100xlarger and 10^7 times more luminous. although vigorously star-forming, theunderlying physics of the star formation processes at z~2 appears to be similarto that seen in local galaxies even though the energetics are unlike anythingfound in the present-day universe.

1003.5183	hizels: the high redshift emission line survey with ukirt	in these proceedings we report on hizels, the high-z emission line survey,our successful panoramic narrow-band campaign survey using wfcam on ukirt todetect and study emission line galaxies at z~1-9. hizels employs the h2(s1)narrow-band filter together with custom-made narrow-band filters in the j andh-bands, with the primary aim of delivering large, identically-selected samplesof h-alpha emitting galaxies at redshifts of 0.84, 1.47 and 2.23. comparisonsbetween the luminosity function, the host galaxy properties, the clustering,and the variation with environment of these h-alpha-selected samples areyielding unique constraints on the nature and evolution of star-forminggalaxies, across the peak epoch of star-formation activity in the universe. weprovide a summary of the project status, and detail the main scientific resultsobtained so far: the measurement of the evolution of the cosmic star-formationrate density out to z &gt; 2 using a single star-formation indicator,determination of the morphologies, environments and dust-content of thestar-forming galaxies, and a detailed investigation of the evolution of theirclustering properties. we also summarise the on-going work and future goals ofthe project.

1004.4001	detection of molecular gas in a distant submillimetre galaxy at z=4.76  with atca	we have detected the co(2-1) transition from the submillimetre galaxy (smg)lessj033229.4-275619 at z=4.755 using the new compact array broadband backendsystem on the australian telescope compact array. these data have identified amassive gas reservoir available for star formation for the first time in an smgat z~5. we use the luminosity and velocity width (fwhm of 160 km/s) of theco(2--1) line emission to constrain the gas and dynamical mass ofmgas~1.6x10^10 msun and mdyn(&lt;2kpc)~5x10^10 (0.25/sin^2(i)) msun, respectively,similar to that observed for smgs at lower redshifts of z~2-4, although we notethat our observed co fwhm is a factor of ~3 narrower than typically seen insmgs. together with the stellar mass we estimate a total baryonic mass ofmbary~1x10^11 msun, consistent with the dynamical mass for this young galaxywithin the uncertainties. dynamical and baryonic mass limits of high-redshiftgalaxies are useful tests of galaxy formation models: using the known z~4-5smgs as examples of massive baryonic systems, we find that their space densityis consistent with that predicted by current galaxy formation models. inaddition, these observations have helped to confirm that z~4-5 smgs possess thebaryonic masses and gas consumption timescales necessary to be the progenitorsof the luminous old red galaxies seen at z~3. our results provide a preview ofthe science that alma will enable on the formation and evolution of theearliest massive galaxies in the universe.

0708.3671	a multiwavelength analysis of the strong lensing cluster rcs  022434-0002.5 at z=0.778	we present the results of two (101 ks total) chandra observations of thez=0.778 optically selected lensing cluster rcs022434-0002.5, along with weaklensing and dynamical analyses of this object. an x-ray spectrum extractedwithin r(2500) (362 h(70)^(-1) kpc) results in an integrated clustertemperature of 5.1 (+0.9,-0.5) kev. the surface brightness profile ofrcs022434-0002.5 indicates the presence of a slight excess of emission in thecore. a hardness ratio image of this object reveals that this central emissionis primarily produced by soft x-rays. further investigation yields a clustercooling time of 3.3 times 10^9 years, which is less than half of the age of theuniverse at this redshift given the current lcdm cosmology. a weak lensinganalysis is performed using hst images, and our weak lensing mass estimate isfound to be in good agreement with the x-ray determined mass of the cluster.spectroscopic analysis reveals that rcs022434-0002.5 has a velocity dispersionof 900 +/- 180 km/s, consistent with its x-ray temperature. the core gas massfraction of rcs022434-0002.5 is, however, found to be three times lower thanexpected universal values. the radial distribution of x-ray point sourceswithin r(200) of this cluster peaks at ~0.7 r(200), possibly indicating thatthe cluster potential is influencing agn activity at that radius. correlationsbetween x-ray and radio (vla) point source positions are also examined.

0708.3838	spectroscopic follow-up of a cluster candidate at z = 1.45	we have obtained deep optical spectroscopic data of the highest-redshiftcluster candidate (z ~ 1.4, cvb13) selected by van breukelen et al. (2006) in aphotometric optical/infrared catalogue of the subaru xmm-newton deep field. thedata, which comprise 104 targeted galaxies, were taken with the deep imagingmulti-object spectrograph (deimos) on the keck 2 telescope and yielded 31secure redshifts in the range 1.25 &lt; z &lt; 1.54 within a 7' x 4' field centred oncvb13. instead of one massive cluster at z = 1.4, we find evidence for threeprojected structures at z = 1.40, z = 1.45, and z = 1.48. the moststatistically robust of these structures, at z = 1.454, has sixspectroscopically confirmed galaxies. its total mass is estimated at &gt; 10^14m_sun and it may therefore be termed a cluster. there is an x-ray source at thecluster position which is marginally spatially resolved but whose x-rayspectrum is too hard to be thermal cluster emission. its origin could be thesummed x-ray emission from active galaxies in, and projected onto, the cluster.serendipitously we have discovered a cluster at z = 1.28 with a mass of &gt; 10^14m_sun at the same position on the sky, comprising six spectroscopicallyconfirmed cluster galaxies and at least one additional radio source. theselection of cvb13 for the cluster catalogue was evidently aided by thesuperposition of other, presumably lower-mass, structures, whereas the singlecluster at z = 1.28 contained too few galaxies to be isolated by the samealgorithm. given the complicated nature of such structures, caution must beemployed when measuring the mass function of putative high-redshift clusterswith photometric techniques alone.

1110.2780	the ism in distant star-forming galaxies: turbulent pressure,  fragmentation and cloud scaling relations in a dense gas disk at z=2.3	we have used the iram plateau de bure interferometer and the expanded verylarge array to obtain a high resolution map of the co(6-5) and co(1-0) emissionin the lensed, star-forming galaxy smmj2135-0102 at z=2.32. the kinematics ofthe gas are well described by a model of a rotationally-supported disk with aninclination-corrected rotation speed, v_rot = 320+/-25km/s, a ratio ofrotational- to dispersion- support of v/sigma=3.5+/-0.2 and a dynamical mass of6.0+/-0.5x10^10mo within a radius of 2.5kpc. the disk has a toomre parameter,q=0.50+/-0.15, suggesting the gas will rapidly fragment into massive clumps onscales of l_j ~ 400pc. we identify star-forming regions on these scales andshow that they are 10x denser than those in quiescent environments in localgalaxies, and significantly offset from the local molecular cloud scalingrelations (larson's relations). the large offset compared to local molecularcloud linewidth-size scaling relations imply that supersonic turbulence shouldremain dominant on scales ~100x smaller than in the kinematically quiescent ismof the milky way, while the molecular gas in smmj2135 is expected to be ~50xdenser than that in the milky way on all scales. this is most likely due to thehigh external hydrostatic pressure we measure for the interstellar medium(ism), p_tot/kb ~ (2+/-1)x10^7k/cm3. in such highly turbulent ism, the subsonicregions of gravitational collapse (and star-formation) will be characterised bymuch higher critical densities, n_crit&gt;=10^8/cm3, a factor ~1000x more than thequiescent ism of the milky way.

1209.1390	an alma survey of sub-millimetre galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: detection of [c ii] at z=4.4	we present alma 870-um (345ghz) observations of two sub-millimetre galaxies(smgs) drawn from an alma study of the 126 sub-millimeter sources from thelaboca extended chandra deep field south survey (less). the alma data identifythe counterparts to these previously unidentified sub-millimeter sources andserendipitously detect bright emission lines in their spectra which we show aremost likely to be [c ii]157.74um emission yielding redshifts of z=4.42 andz=4.44. this blind detection rate within the 7.5-ghz bandpass of alma isconsistent with the previously derived photometric redshift distribution ofsmgs and suggests a modest, but not dominant (&lt;25%), tail of 870-um selectedsmgs at z&gt;4. we find that the ratio of l_cii/l_fir in these smgs is much higherthan seen for similarly far-infrared-luminous galaxies at z~0, which isattributed to the more extended gas reservoirs in these high-redshift ulirgs.indeed, in one system we show that the [c ii] emission shows hints of extendedemission on &gt;3kpc scales. finally, we use the volume probed by our alma surveyto show that the bright end of the [c ii] luminosity function evolves stronglybetween z=0 and z~4.4, reflecting the increased ism cooling in galaxies as aresult of their higher star-formation rates. these observations demonstratethat even with short integrations, alma is able to detect the dominant finestructure cooling lines from high-redshift ulirgs, measure their energetics andtrace their evolution with redshift.

1209.4902	goods-herschel: impact of active galactic nuclei and star formation  activity on infrared spectral energy distributions at high redshift	we explore the effects of active galactic nuclei (agn) and star formationactivity on the infrared (0.3-1000 microns) spectral energy distributions ofluminous infrared galaxies from z = 0.5 to 4.0. we have compiled a large sampleof 151 galaxies selected at 24 microns (s24 &gt; 100 ujy) in the goods-n and ecdfsfields for which we have deep spitzer irs spectroscopy, allowing us todecompose the mid-ir spectrum into contributions from star formation and agnactivity. a significant portion (~25%) of our sample is dominated by an agn inthe mid-ir. based on the mid-ir classification, we divide our full sample intofour sub-samples: z~1 star-forming (sf) sources; z~2 sf sources; agn with clear9.7 micron silicate absorption; and agn with featureless mid-ir spectra. fromour large spectroscopic sample and wealth of multi-wavelength data, includingdeep herschel imaging at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 microns, we use 95galaxies with complete spectral coverage to create a composite spectral energydistribution (sed) for each sub-sample. we then fit a two-temperature componentmodified blackbody to the seds. we find that the ir seds have similar cold dusttemperatures, regardless of the mid-ir power source, but display a markeddifference in the warmer dust temperatures. we calculate the average effectivetemperature of the dust in each sub-sample and find a significant (~20 k)difference between the sf and agn systems. we compare our composite seds tolocal templates and find that local templates do not accurately reproduce themid-ir features and dust temperatures of our high redshift systems. highredshift ir luminous galaxies contain significantly more cool dust than theirlocal counterparts. we find that a full suite of photometry spanning the irpeak is necessary to accurately account for the dominant dust temperaturecomponents in high redshift ir luminous galaxies.

1210.0249	an alma survey of submillimetre galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: high resolution 870um source counts	we report the first counts of faint submillimetre galaxies (smg) in the870-um band derived from arcsecond resolution observations with the atacamalarge millimeter array (alma). we have used alma to map a sample of 122870-um-selected submillimetre sources drawn from the (0.5x0.5)deg^2 labocaextended chandra deep field south submillimetre survey (less). these alma mapshave an average depth of sigma(870um)~0.4mjy, some ~3x deeper than the originallaboca survey and critically the angular resolution is more than an order ofmagnitude higher, fwhm of ~1.5" compared to ~19" for the laboca discovery map.this combination of sensitivity and resolution allows us to precisely pin-pointthe smgs contributing to the submillimetre sources from the laboca map, freefrom the effects of confusion. we show that our alma-derived smg counts broadlyagree with the submillimetre source counts from previous, lower-resolutionsingle-dish surveys, demonstrating that the bulk of the submillimetre sourcesare not caused by blending of unresolved smgs. the difficulty whichwell-constrained theoretical models have in reproducing the high-surfacedensities of smgs, thus remains. however, our observations do show that all ofthe very brightest sources in the less sample, s(870um)&gt;12mjy, compriseemission from multiple, fainter smgs, each with 870-um fluxes of &lt;9mjy. thisimplies a natural limit to the star-formation rate in smgs of &lt;10^3 m_sun/yr,which in turn suggests that the space densities of z&gt;1 galaxies with gas massesin excess of ~5x10^10 m_sun is &lt;10^-5 mpc^-3. we also discuss the influence ofthis blending on the identification and characterisation of the smgcounterparts to these bright submillimetre sources and suggest that it may beresponsible for previous claims that they lie at higher redshifts than faintersmgs.

1301.3155	empirical predictions for (sub-)millimeter line and continuum deep  fields	[abridged] modern (sub-)millimeter/radio interferometers will enable us tomeasure the dust and molecular gas emission from galaxies that haveluminosities lower than the milky way, out to high redshifts and withunprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. this will provide newconstraints on the star formation properties and gas reservoir in galaxiesthroughout cosmic times through dedicated deep field campaigns targeting theco/[cii] lines and dust continuum emission. in this paper, we present empiricalpredictions for such (sub-)millimeter line and continuum deep fields. we basethese predictions on the deepest available optical/near-infrared acs and nicmosdata on the hubble ultra deep field. using a physically-motivated spectralenergy distribution model, we fit the observed optical/near-infrared emissionof 13,099 galaxies with redshifts up to z=5, and obtain median likelihoodestimates of their stellar mass, star formation rate, dust attenuation and dustluminosity. we derive statistical constraints on the dust emission in theinfrared and (sub-)millimeter which are consistent with the observedoptical/near-infrared emission in terms of energy balance. this allows us toestimate, for each galaxy, the (sub-)millimeter continuum flux densities inseveral alma, pdbi/noema and jvla bands. using empirical relations between theobserved co/[cii] line luminosities and the infrared luminosity, we infer theflux of the co(1-0) and [cii] lines from the estimated infrared luminosity ofeach galaxy in our sample. we then predict the fluxes of higher co transitionlines co(2-1) to co(7-6) bracketing two extreme gas excitation scenarios. weuse our predictions to discuss possible deep field strategies with alma. thepredictions presented in this study will serve as a direct benchmark for futuredeep field campaigns in the (sub-)millimeter regime.

1302.0844	on the effect of the cosmic microwave background in high-redshift  (sub-)millimeter observations	modern (sub-)millimeter interferometers enable the measurement of the coolgas and dust emission of high-redshift galaxies (z&gt;5). however, at theseredshifts the cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature is higher,approaching, and even exceeding, the temperature of cold dust and molecular gasobserved in the local universe. in this paper, we discuss the impact of thewarmer cmb on (sub-)millimeter observations of high-redshift galaxies. the cmbaffects the observed (sub-)millimeter dust continuum and the line emission(e.g. carbon monoxide, co) in two ways: (i) it provides an additional source of(both dust and gas) heating; and (ii) it is a non-negligible background againstwhich the line and continuum emission are measured. we show that these twocompeting processes affect the way we interpret the dust and gas properties ofhigh-redshift galaxies using spectral energy distribution models. we quantifythese effects and provide correction factors to compute what fraction of theintrinsic dust (and line) emission can be detected against the cmb as afunction of frequency, redshift and temperature. we discuss implications on thederived properties of high-redshift galaxies from (sub-)millimeter data.specifically, the inferred dust and molecular gas masses can be severelyunderestimated for cold systems if the impact of the cmb is not properly takeninto account.

1307.0502	the prevalence of agn feedback in massive galaxies at z~1	we use the optical--infrared imaging in the ukidss ultra deep survey field,in combination with the new deep radio map of arumugam et al., to calculate thedistribution of radio luminosities among galaxies as a function of stellar massin two redshift bins across the interval 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.2. this is done with the useof a new bayesian method to classify stars and galaxies in surveys withmulti-band photometry, and to derive photometric redshifts and stellar massesfor those galaxies. we compare the distribution to that observed locally andfind agreement if we consider only objects believed to be weak-lined radio-loudgalaxies. since the local distribution is believed to be the result of anenergy balance between radiative cooling of the gaseous halo and mechanical agnheating, we infer that this balance was also present as long ago as z~1. thissupports the existence of a direct link between the presence of alow-luminosity ('hot-mode') radio-loud active galactic nucleus and the absenceof ongoing star formation.

1310.6362	an alma survey of submillimetre galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: the far-infrared properties of smgs	we exploit alma 870um (345ghz) observations of submillimetre sources in theextended chandra deep field south to investigate the far-infrared properties ofhigh-redshift submillimetre galaxies (smgs). using the precisely located 870umalma positions of 99 smgs, together with 24um and radio imaging of this field,we deblend the herschel/spire imaging of this region to extract theirfar-infrared fluxes and colours. the median photometric redshifts for alma less(aless) smgs which are detected in at least two spire bands increases withwavelength of the peak in their seds, with z=2.3+/-0.2, 2.5+/-0.3 and 3.5+/-0.5for the 250, 350 and 500-um peakers respectively. we find that 34 aless smgs donot have a &gt;3-sigma counterpart at 250, 350 or 500-um. these galaxies have amedian photometric redshift of z=3.3+/-0.5, which is higher than the full alesssmg sample; z=2.5+/-0.2. using the photometric redshifts together with the250-870um photometry, we estimate the far-infrared luminosities andcharacteristic dust temperature of each smg. the median infrared luminosity ofthe s_870um&gt;2mjy smgs is l_ir=(3.0+/-0.3)x10^{12}lo(sfr=300+/-30mo/yr). at afixed luminosity, the characteristic dust temperature of these high-redshiftsmgs is 2-3k lower than comparably luminous galaxies at z=0, reflecting themore extended star formation occurring in these systems. by extrapolating the870um number counts to s_ 870um=1mjy, we show that the contribution ofs_870um&gt;1mjy smgs to the cosmic star formation budget is 20% of the total overthe redshift range z~1-4. we derive a median dust mass for these smgs ofm_d=(3.6+/-0.3)x10^8mo and by adopting an appropriate gas-to-dust ratio, weestimate an average molecular mass of m_h2=(4.2+/-0.4)x10^{10}mo. finally, weuse our estimates of the h2 masses to show that smgs with s_870um&gt;1mjy contain~10% of the z~2 volume-averaged h2 mass density at this epoch.

1310.6363	an alma survey of submillimeter galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: the redshift distribution and evolution of submillimeter  galaxies	we present the first photometric redshift distribution for a large unbiasedsample of 870um selected submillimeter galaxies (smgs) with robustidentifications based on observations with the atacama large millimeter array(alma). in our analysis we consider 96 smgs in the extended chandra deep fieldsouth, 77 of which have 4-19 band, optical-near-infrared, photometry. we modelthe spectral energy distributions (seds) for these 77 smgs, deriving a medianphotometric redshift of z=2.3+/-0.1. the remaining 19 smgs have insufficientoptical or near-infrared photometry to derive photometric redshifts, but astacking analysis of irac and herschel observations confirms they are notspurious. assuming these sources have an absolute h-band magnitude distributioncomparable to that of a complete sample of z~1-2 smgs, we demonstrate that theundetected smgs lie at higher redshifts, raising the median redshift for smgsto z=2.5+/-0.2. more critically we show that the proportion of galaxiesundergoing an smg phase at z&gt;3 is 35+/-5% of the total population. we derive amedian stellar mass for smgs of mstar=(8+/-1)x10^10mo, but caution that thereare significant systematic uncertainties in our stellar mass estimate, up to x5for individual sources. we compare our sample of smgs to a volume-limited,morphologically classified sample of ellipticals in the local universe.assuming the star formation activity in smgs has a timescale of ~100myr we showthat their descendants at z~0 would have a space density and m_h distributionwhich are in good agreement with those of local ellipticals. in addition theinferred mass-weighted ages of the local ellipticals broadly agree with thelook-back times of the smg events. taken together, these results are consistentwith a simple model that identifies smgs as events that form most of the starsseen in the majority of luminous elliptical galaxies at the present day.

1312.7834	cold dust in hot regions	we mapped five massive star forming regions with the scuba-2 camera on thejames clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt). temperature and column density maps areobtained from the scuba-2 450 and 850 $\mu$m images. most of the dense clumpswe find have central temperatures below 20 k with some as cold as 8 k,suggesting that they have no internal heating due to the presence of embeddedprotostars. this is surprising, because at the high densities inferred fromthese images and at these low temperatures such clumps should be unstable,collapsing to form stars and generating internal heating. the column densitiesat the clump centres exceed 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and the derived peak visualextinction values are from 25-500 mag for $\beta$ = 1.5-2.5, indicating highlyopaque centres. the observed cloud gas masses range from $\sim$ 10 to 10$^{3}$m$_{\odot}$. the outer regions of the clumps follow an $r^{-2.36\pm0.35}$density distribution and this power-law structure is observed outside oftypically 10$^{4}$ au. all these findings suggest that these clumps arehigh-mass starless clumps and most likely contain high-mass starless cores.

0802.2694	exploring the infrared/radio correlation at high redshift	we have analysed the 24um properties of a radio-selected sample in thesubaru-xmm/newton deep field in order to explore the behaviour of the fir/radiorelation at high redshifts. statistically, the correlation is described by q24,the ratio between the observed flux densities at 24um and 1.4ghz, respectively.using 24um data results in considerably more scatter in the correlation thanprevious work using data at 60-70um. nevertheless, we do observe a steadycorrelation as a function of redshift, up to z~3.5, suggesting its validityback to primeval times. we find q24 = 0.30 +/- 0.56 for the observed and q24 =0.71 +/- 0.47 for the k-corrected radio sample, based on sources with 300ujy &lt;s(1.4ghz) &lt; 3.2mjy and 24um detections. a suitable k-correction given by am82-like mid-ir template suggests no extreme silicate absorption in the bulk ofour radio sample. using thresholds in q24 to identify radio-excess sources, wehave been able to characterise the transition from radio-loud agn tostar-forming galaxies and radio-quiet agn at faint (&lt;1mjy) radio fluxdensities. our results are in broad agreement with previous studies which showa dominant radio-loud agn population at &gt;1mjy. the rest-frame u-b colours ofthe expected radio-excess population have redder distribution than those thatfollow the correlation. this is therefore a promising way to select obscuredtype-2 agn, with a radio loud nature, missed by deep x-ray observations.spectroscopic follow-up of these sources is required to fully test this method.

1504.04376	an alma survey of sub-millimeter galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: physical properties derived from ultraviolet-to-radio modelling	[abridged] the aless survey has followed-up a sample of 122 sub-millimetersources in the extended chandra deep field south at 870um with alma, allowingto pinpoint the positions of sub-millimeter galaxies (smgs) to 0.3'' and tofind their precise counterparts at different wavelengths. this enabled thefirst compilation of the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (seds)of a statistically reliable survey of smgs. in this paper, we present a newcalibration of the magphys modelling code that is optimized to fit theseuv-to-radio seds of z&gt;1 star-forming galaxies using an energy balance techniqueto connect the emission from stellar populations, dust attenuation and dustemission in a physically consistent way. we derive statistically and physicallyrobust estimates of the photometric redshifts and physical parameters for thealess smgs. we find that they have a median stellar mass$m_\ast=(8.9\pm0.1)\times10^{10} m_\odot$, sfr$=280\pm70 m_\odot$/yr, overallv-band dust attenuation $a_v=1.9\pm0.2$ mag, dust mass$m_\rm{dust}=(5.6\pm1.0)\times10^8 m_\odot$, and average dust temperaturetdust~40 k. the average intrinsic sed of the aless smgs resembles that of localulirgs in the ir range, but the stellar emission of our average smg is brighterand bluer, indicating lower dust attenuation, possibly because they are moreextended. we explore how the average seds vary with different parameters, andwe provide a new set of smg templates. to put the aless smgs into context, wecompare their stellar masses and sfrs with those of less actively star-forminggalaxies at the same redshifts. at z~2, about half of the smgs lie above thestar-forming main sequence, while half are at the high-mass end of thesequence. at higher redshifts (z~3.5), the smgs tend to have higher sfr andmstar, but the fraction of smgs that lie significantly above the main sequencedecreases to less than a third.

1505.05148	alma maps the star-forming regions in a dense gas disk at z~3	we exploit long-baseline alma sub-mm observations of the lensed star-forminggalaxy sdp 81 at z=3.042 to investigate the properties of inter-stellar mediumon scales of 50-100pc. the kinematics of the co gas within this system are welldescribed by a rotationally-supported disk with an inclination-correctedrotation speed, v=320+/-20km/s and a dynamical mass of m=(3.5+/-1.0)x10^10mowithin a radius of 1.5 kpc. the disk is gas rich and unstable, with a toomreparameter, q=0.30+/-0.10 and so should collapse in to star-forming regions withjeans length l_j~130pc. we identify five star-forming regions within the ism onthese scales and show that their scaling relations between luminosity,line-widths and sizes are significantly offset from those typical of molecularclouds in local galaxies (larson's relations). these offsets are likely to becaused by the high external hydrostatic pressure for the interstellar medium(ism), p/kb=(40+/-20)x10^7k/cm3, which is ~10,000x higher than the typical ismpressure in the milky way. the physical conditions of the star-forming ism andgiant molecular clouds appears to be similar to the those found in the densestenvironments in the local universe, such as those in the galactic center.

1505.05152	the scuba-2 cosmology legacy survey: alma resolves the bright-end of the  sub-millimeter number counts	we present high-resolution 870-um alma continuum maps of 30 brightsub-millimeter sources in the ukidss uds field. these sources are selected fromdeep, 1-square degrees 850-um maps from the scuba--2 cosmology legacy survey,and are representative of the brightest sources in the field (median scuba2flux s_850=8.7+/-0.4 mjy). we detect 52 sub-millimeter galaxies (smgs) at&gt;4-sigma significance in our 30 alma maps. in 61+/-17% of the alma maps thesingle-dish source comprises a blend of &gt;=2 smgs, where the secondary smgs areultra--luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) with l_ir&gt;10^12 lo. the brightestsmg contributes on average 80+/-4% of the single-dish flux density, and in thealma maps containing &gt;=2 smgs the secondary smg contributes 25+/-3% of theintegrated alma flux. we construct source counts and show that multiplicityboosts the apparent single-dish cumulative counts by 20% at s_870&gt;7.5mjy, andby 60% at s_870&gt;12mjy. we combine our sample with previous alma studies offainter smgs and show that the counts are well-described by a double power-lawwith a break at 8.5+/-0.6mjy. the break corresponds to a luminosity of~6x10^12lsol or a star-formation rate of ~1000mo/yr. for the typical sizes ofthese smgs, which are resolved in our alma data with r=1.2+/-0.1kpc, thisyields a limiting sfr density of ~100msol/yr/kpc2. finally, the number densityof s_870&gt;2mjy smgs is 80+/-30 times higher than that derived from blank-fieldcounts. an over-abundance of faint smgs is inconsistent with line-of-sightprojections dominating multiplicity in the brightest smgs, and indicates that asignificant proportion of these high-redshift ulirgs must be physicallyassociated.

astro-ph;0101028	a massive reservoir of low-excitation molecular gas at high redshift	molecular hydrogen is an important component of galaxies because it fuelsstar formation and accretion onto agn, the two processes that generate thelarge infrared luminosities of gas-rich galaxies. observations of spectral-lineemission from the tracer molecule co are used to probe the properties of thisgas. but the lines that have been studied in the local universe, mostly thelower rotational transitions of j = 1-0 and j = 2-1, have hitherto beenunobservable in high-redshift galaxies. instead, higher transitions have beenused, although the densities and temperatures required to excite these highertransitions may not be reached by much of the gas. as a result, pastobservations may have underestimated the total amount of molecular gas by asubstantial amount. here we report the discovery of large amounts oflow-excitation molecular gas around the infrared-luminous quasar, apm08279+5255 at z = 3.91, using the two lowest excitation lines of 12co (j = 1-0and j = 2-1). the maps confirm the presence of hot and dense gas near thenucleus, and reveal an extended reservoir of molecular gas with low excitationthat is 10 to 100 times more massive than the gas traced by higher-excitationobservations. this raises the possibility that significant amounts oflow-excitation molecular gas may lurk in the environments of high-redshift (z &gt;3) galaxies.

astro-ph;0312269	the canada-uk deep submillimetre survey viii: source identifications in  the 3-hour field	we present optical, near-infrared and radio observations of the 3-hour fieldof the canada-uk deep submillimetre survey. of the 27 submillimetre sources inthe field, nine have secure identifications with either a radio source or anear-ir source. we show that the percentage of sources with secureidentifications in the cudss is consistent with that found for the bright `8mjy' submillimetre survey, once allowance is made for the differentsubmillimetre and radio flux limits. of the 14 secure identifications in thetwo cudss fields, eight are vros or eros, five have colours typical of normalgalaxies, and one is a radio source which has not yet been detected atoptical/near-ir wavelengths. eleven of the identifications have optical/near-irstructures which are either disturbed or have some peculiarity which suggeststhat the host galaxy is part of an interacting system. one difference betweenthe cudss results and the results from the 8-mjy survey is the large number oflow-redshift objects in the cudss; we give several arguments why these aregenuine low-redshift submillimetre sources rather than being gravitationallenses which are gravitationally amplifying a high-$z$ submillimetre source. weconstruct a $k-z$ diagram for various classes of high-redshift galaxy and showthat the scuba galaxies are on average less luminous than classical radiogalaxies, but are very similar in both their optical/ir luminosities and theircolours to the host galaxies of the radio sources detected in $\mu$jy radiosurveys.

astro-ph;0403192	multiply-imaged submm galaxy in a z~2.5 group	we present observations of a remarkable submillimetre-selected galaxy,smmj16359+6612. this distant galaxy lies behind the core of a massive clusterof galaxies, a2218, and is gravitationally lensed by the foreground clusterinto three discrete images which were identified in deep submillimetre maps ofthe cluster core at both 450 and 850micron. subsequent follow-up using deepoptical and nir images identify a faint counterpart to each of the 3 images,with similar red optical--nir colours and hst morphologies. by exploiting adetailed mass model for the cluster lens we estimate that the combined imagesof this galaxy are magnified by a factor of ~45, implying that this galaxywould have un-lensed magnitudes k_s=22.9 and i=26.1, and an un-lensed 850micronflux density of only 0.8mjy. moreover, the highly constrained lens modelpredicted the redshift of smmj16359+6612 to be z=2.6+/-0.4. we confirm thisestimate using deep optical and nir keck spectroscopy, measuring a redshift ofz=2.516. smmj16359+6612 is the faintest submm-selected galaxy so far identifiedwith a precise redshift. thanks to the large gravitational magnification ofthis source, we identify 3 sub-components in this submm galaxy, which are alsoseen in the nirspec data, arguing for either a strong dust (lane) absorption ora merger. interestingly, there are 2 other highly-amplified galaxies at almostidentical redshifts in this field (although neither is a strong submm emitter).the 3 galaxies lie within a ~100kpc region on the background sky, suggestingthis submm galaxy is located in a dense high-redshift group.

astro-ph;0412050	the rest-frame optical spectra of scuba galaxies	we present near-infrared spectroscopy and narrow-band imaging at thewavelength of redshifted h-alpha for a sample of 30 high-redshift, far-infraredluminous galaxies. this sample is selected from surveys in the sub-millimeter,millimeter and radio wavebands and has complete redshift coverage with a medianredshift of z~2.4. removing obvious agn, we find that the predicted h-alphastar formation rates in this diverse population are suppressed (by ~10x)compared to those derived from their far-infrared luminosities. we estimatethat agn are present in at least 40% of the galaxies in our sample. to furtherinvestigate this, we construct a composite rest-frame spectrum for both theentire sample and for those galaxies which individually show no signs ofnuclear activity. we find [nii]/h-alpha ratios for both composite spectra whichsuggest that the energy output of the galaxies is star-formation- rather thanagn-dominated. the median h-alpha line width for our sample (removing obviousagn) is 400+/-70km/s (fwhm), and the typical spatial extent of the h-alphaemission in our narrow-band observations is &lt; 4-8kpc, which indicates adynamical mass of 1-2 x 10^11 mo. this estimate is larger than recent estimatesof the dynamical masses of uv-selected galaxies at similar redshifts derived inan identical manner. we also compared our h-alpha and far-infrared luminositieswith deep chandra observations of a subset of our survey fields and use thesedata to further assess their agn content. we conclude that these high-redshift,far-infrared luminous galaxies represent a population of massive, metal-rich,merging systems with high instantaneous star formation rates, strong dustobscuration and actively-fueled agn which are likely to be the progenitors ofmassive local elliptical galaxies.

(1994), or to 3 sigma &lt;58700 based on the data obtained by braine et al. (1996). these limits areconsistent with values measured in the galactic plane and for nearby starburstnuclei; the former, however, is significantly lower than the ratio found inlow-metallicity systems such as the large magellanic cloud (which might beexpected to have much in common with a damped ly-alpha absorption system athigh redshift). this can be taken as evidence against the reality of the coline detections, with the proviso that a system significantly larger thanpresent-day disk galaxies would not have been fully covered by our small beamwhereas it would have been properly sampled by the frayer et al. observations.finally, we demonstate (as did ivison et al. 1996) that knitting togetheroverlapping bands can generate erroneous results - specifically, an emissionfeature that has a width, profile and central velocity consistent with thecontroversial co emission lines and which could have drawn us to entirely thewrong conclusions.

astro-ph;9810273	a submillimetre survey of the hubble deep field: unveiling  dust-enshrouded star formation in the early universe	the advent of sensitive sub-mm array cameras now allows a proper census ofdust-enshrouded massive star-formation in very distant galaxies, previouslyhidden activity to which even the deepest optical images are insensitive. wepresent the deepest sub-mm survey, taken with the scuba camera on the jamesclerk maxwell telescope (jcmt) and centred on the hubble deep field (hdf). thehigh source density on this image implies that the survey is confusion-limitedbelow a flux density of 2 mjy. however within the central 80 arcsec radiusindependent analyses yield 5 reproducible sources with s(850um) &gt; 2 mjy whichsimulations indicate can be ascribed to individual galaxies. these data lead tointegral source counts which are completely inconsistent with a no evolutionmodel, whilst the combined brightness of the 5 most secure sources in our mapis sufficient to account for 30-50% of the previously unresolved sub-mmbackground, and statistically the entire background is resolved at about the0.3 mjy level. four of the five brightest sources appear to be associated withgalaxies which lie in the redshift range 2 &lt; z &lt; 4. with the caveat that thisis a small sample of sources detected in a small survey area, these submm dataimply a star-formation density over this redshift range that is at least fivetimes higher than that inferred from the rest-frame ultraviolet output of hdfgalaxies.

astro-ph;9810281	deep sub-mm surveys with scuba	we review published deep surveys in the submillimeter (sub-mm) regime fromthe new sub-millimetre common user bolometer array (scuba) on the 15-m jamesclerk maxwell telescope (jcmt), mauna kea, hawaii. summarising the numbercounts of faint sub-mm sources determined from the different surveys we showthat the deepest counts from our completed scuba lens survey, down to 0.5mjy at850um fully account for the far-infrared background (firb) detected by cobe. weconclude that a population of distant, dust-enshrouded ultraluminous infraredgalaxies dominate the firb emission around 1mm. we go on to discuss the natureof this population, starting with the identification of their opticalcounterparts, where we highlight the important role of deep vla radioobservations in this process. taking advantage of the extensive archival hubblespace telescope (hst) observations of our fields, we then investigate themorphological nature of the sub-mm galaxy population and show that a largefraction exhibit disturbed or interacting morphologies. by employing existingbroadband photometry, we derive crude redshift limits for a complete sample offaint sub-mm galaxies indicating that the majority lie at z&lt;5, with at most 20%at higher redshifts. we compare these limits to the initial spectroscopicresults from various sub-mm samples. finally we discuss the nature of thesub-mm population, its relationship to other classes of high-redshift galaxiesand its future role in our understanding of the formation of massive galaxies.

astro-ph;9906196	submm continuum surveys for obscured galaxies	we discuss deep surveys in the submm regime using the scuba bolometer arrayon the jcmt. at 850um scuba has resolved the bulk of the submm background(smbr) detected by cobe into discrete sources brighter than 0.5mjy. theon-going identification and characterisation of this population at otherwavelengths suggests that the bulk of the submm sources brighter than ~1mjy lieat z&gt;1, with a median redshift for the population of &lt;z&gt;~2-3. theoptical/near-infrared properties of the counterparts to the submm sourcesbreakdown as follows: roughly two-thirds have reliable identifications with theothers being more ambiguous. of those with identifications about half areoptically bright (i&lt;23) mergers or interactions with a high proportion showingsignatures of agn activity and the other half are optically faint (i&gt;25)including both blank fields and extremely red objects (eros). we conclude thata population of distant, highly obscured ultraluminous infrared galaxies(ulirgs) dominates the smbr. the wide range in the characteristics of theoptical counterparts is consistent with the dispersion in the restframe uvproperties of local ulirgs. we suggest that the faint submm populationcomprises a class of high redshift dusty, mergers associated with the formationof present day luminous elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;9906311	dust-obscured star formation and agn fuelling in hierarchical models of  galaxy evolution	a large fraction of the luminous distant submm-wave galaxies recentlydetected using scuba on the jcmt appear to be associated with interactingoptical counterparts. we investigate these systems using a simple hierarchicalclustering model of galaxy evolution, in which the large luminosity of thescuba galaxies is assumed to be generated at the epoch of galaxy mergers in aburst of either star formation activity or the fuelling of an active galacticnucleus (agn). the models are well constrained by the observed spectrum of thefir/submm background radiation and the 60-micron counts of low-z iras galaxies.the ratio between the total amount of energy released during mergers and themass of dark matter involved must increase sharply with z at z&lt;1, and thendecrease at higher z, independent of the fraction of the luminosity of mergersthat is produced by starbursts and agn. one additional parameter - thereciprocal of the product of the duration of the enhanced luminosity producedby the merger and the fraction of mergers that induce an enhanced luminosity,which we call the activity parameter - is introduced, to allow the relationshipbetween merging dark matter haloes and the observed counts of distant dustygalaxies to be investigated. the observed counts can only be reproduced if theactivity parameter is greater by a factor of about 5 and 100 at redshifts of 1and 3 respectively, compared with the present epoch. hence, if mergers accountfor the scuba galaxies, then the merger process must have been much moreviolent at high redshifts. we discuss the counts of galaxies and the intensityof background radiation in the optical/near-ir wavebands in the context ofthese hierarchical models, and thus investigate the relationship between thepopulations of scuba and lyman-break galaxies.

astro-ph;9908024	galaxy counts at 450 and 850 microns	surveys of the distant universe have been made using the scubasubmillimeter(submm)-wave camera at the jcmt. 450- and 850-micron data is takensimultaneously by scuba in the same 5-square-arcmin field. deep 850-microncounts of high-redshift dusty galaxies have been published; however, at 450microns both the atmospheric transmission and antenna efficiency are lower, andthe atmospheric noise is higher, and so only upper limits to the 450-microncounts have been reported so far. here we apply the methods used by blain etal. (1999) to derive deep 850-micron counts from scuba images of lensingclusters to the 450-micron images that were obtained in parallel, in which foursources were detected. we present the first 450-micron galaxy count. thisanalysis has only just become possible because the volume of data and thedifficulty of calibration are both greater for the 450-micron array. in lightof recent work, in which the identification of two of the galaxies in oursample was clarified, we also update our deep 850-micron counts.

astro-ph;9911069	the diversity of scuba-selected galaxies	we present extensive observations of a sample of distant, submm galaxiesdetected in the field of the massive cluster lens, a1835, using scuba. taken inconjunction with earlier observations of other submm-selected sources (ivisonet al. 1998; smail et al. 1999; soucail et al. 1999) we now have detailed,multi-wavelength observations of 7 examples of the submm population, havingexploited the combination of achromatic amplification by cluster lenses andlavish archival datasets. these sources, all clearly at z &gt; 1, illustrate thewide range in the radio and optical properties of distant submm-selectedgalaxies. we include detailed observations of the first candidate `pure'starburst submm galaxy at high redshift, a z=2.56 interacting galaxy whichshows no obvious sign of hosting an agn. the remaining sources have varyingdegrees of inferred agn activity (3 from 7 of the most luminous show someevidence of the presence of an agn) although even when an agn is obviouslypresent it is still not apparent if reprocessed radiation from this sourcedominates the submm emission. in contrast with the variation in the spectralproperties, we see relatively homogeneous morphologies for the population, witha large fraction of merging or interacting systems. our study shows thatvirtually identical seds are seen for galaxies which exhibit strikinglydifferent opt/uv spectral-line characteristics. we conclude that standardopt/uv spectral classifications are misleading when applied to distant, highlyobscured galaxies and that we must seek other means of determining the variouscontributions to the overall energy budget of submm galaxies and hence to thefar-ir extragalactic background.
