0910.4393	photometric redshift estimation using gaussian processes	we present a comparison between gaussian processes (gps) and artificialneural networks (anns) as methods for determining photometric redshifts forgalaxies, given training set data. in particular, we compare their degradationin performance as the training set size is degraded in ways which might becaused by the observational limitations of spectroscopy. we find thatperformance with large, complete training sets is very similar, although theann achieves slightly smaller root mean square errors. if the size of thetraining set is reduced by random sampling, the rms errors of both methodsincrease, but they do so to a lesser extent and in a much smoother manner forthe case of gp regression. when training objects are removed at redshifts1.3&lt;z&lt;1.7, to simulate the effects of the "redshift desert" of opticalspectroscopy, the gp regression is successful at interpolating across theredshift gap, while the ann suffers from strong bias for test objects in thisredshift range. overall, gp regression has attractive properties forphotometric redshift estimation, particularly for deep, high-redshift surveyswhere it is difficult to obtain a large, complete training set. at present,unlike the ann code, public gp regression codes do not take account ofinhomogeneous measurement errors on the photometric data, and thus cannotestimate reliable uncertainties on the predicted redshifts. however, a bettertreatment of errors is in principle possible, and the promising results in thispaper suggest that such improved gp algorithms should be pursued.

0912.0039	x-ray groups and clusters of galaxies in the subaru-xmm deep field	we present the results of a search for galaxy clusters in subaru-xmm deep  field. we reach a depth for a total cluster flux in the 0.5-2 kev band of2x10^{-15} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} over one of the widest xmm-newton contiguousraster surveys, covering an area of 1.3 square degrees. cluster candidates areidentified through a wavelet detection of extended x-ray emission. the redsequence technique allows us to identify 57 cluster candidates. we report onthe progress with the cluster spectroscopic follow-up and derive theirproperties based on the x-ray luminosity and cluster scaling relations. inaddition, 3 sources are identified as x-ray counterparts of radio lobes, and in3 further sources, x-ray counterpart of radio lobes provides a significantfraction of the total flux of the source. in the area covered by nir data, ouridentification success rate achieves 86%. we detect a number of radio galaxieswithin our groups and for a luminosity-limited sample of radio galaxies wecompute halo occupation statistics using a marked cluster mass function. wecompare the cluster detection statistics in the sxdf with the predictions ofconcordance cosmology and current knowledge of the x-ray cluster properties,concluding that a reduction of concordance sigma_8 value by 5% is required inorder to match the prediction of the model and the data. this conclusion stillneeds verification through the completion of cluster follow-up.

1001.2018	when galaxies collide: understanding the broad absorption-line radio  galaxy 4c +72.26	we present a range of new observations of the "broad absorption line radiogalaxy" 4c +72.26 (z = 3.5), including sensitive rest-frame ultravioletintegral field spectroscopy using the gemini/gmos-n instrument and subaru/ciscok-band imaging and spectroscopy. we show that 4c +72.26 is a system of twovigorously star-forming galaxies superimposed along the line of sight separatedby ~1300 +/- 200 km/s in velocity, with each demonstrating spectroscopicallyresolved absorption lines. the most active star-forming galaxy also hosts theaccreting supermassive black hole which powers the extended radio source. weconclude that the star formation is unlikely to have been induced by a shockcaused by the passage of the radio jet, and instead propose that a collision isa more probable trigger for the star formation. despite the massive starburst,the uv-mid-infrared spectral energy distribution suggests that the pre-existingstellar population comprises ~10^12 msolar of stellar mass, with the currentburst only contributing a further ~2%, suggesting that 4c +72.26 has alreadyassembled most of its final stellar mass.

1002.1112	an infrared-radio simulation of the extragalactic sky: from the square  kilometer array to herschel	to exploit synergies between the herschel space observatory and nextgeneration radio facilities, we have extended the semi-empirical extragalacticradio continuum simulation of wilman et al. (2008) to the mid- andfar-infrared. here we describe the assignment of infrared spectral energydistributions (seds) to the star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei,using spitzer 24, 70 and 160 micron and scuba 850 micron survey results as themain constraints.  star-forming galaxies dominate the source counts, and a model in which theirfar-infrared-radio correlation and infrared sed assignment procedure areinvariant with redshift underpredicts the observed 24 and 70 micron sourcecounts. the 70 micron deficit can be eliminated if the star-forming galaxiesundergo stronger luminosity evolution than originally assumed for the radiosimulation, a requirement which may be partially ascribed to knownnon-linearity in the far-infrared--radio correlation at low luminosity if itevolves with redshift. at 24 micron, the shortfall is reduced if thestar-forming galaxies develop seds with cooler dust and correspondinglystronger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission features withincreasing redshift at a given far-infrared luminosity, but this trend mayreverse at z&gt;1 in order not to overproduce the sub-mm source counts. theresulting model compares favourably with recent blast results and we haveextended the simulation database to aid the interpretation of herschel surveys.such comparisons may also facilitate further model refinement and revisedpredictions for the ska and its precursors.

1009.5983	measurements of co redshifts with z-spec for lensed submillimeter  galaxies discovered in the h-atlas survey	we present new observations from z-spec, a broadband 185-305 ghzspectrometer, of five sub-millimeter bright lensed sources selected from theherschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) sciencedemonstration phase (sdp) catalog. we construct a redshift finding algorithmusing combinations of the signal-to-noise of all the lines falling in thez-spec bandpass to determine redshifts with high confidence, even in caseswhere the signal-to-noise in individual lines is low. we measure the dustcontinuum in all sources and secure co redshifts for four out of five(z~1.5-3). in one source, sdp.17, we tentatively identify two independentredshifts and a water line, confirmed at z=2.308. our sources have propertiescharacteristic of dusty starburst galaxies, with magnification-corrected starformation rates of 10^(2-3) m_sun/yr. lower limits for the dust masses (~a few10^8 m_sun) and spatial extents (~1 kpc equivalent radius) are derived from thecontinuum spectral energy distributions, corresponding to dust temperaturesbetween 54 and 69k. in the lte approximation, we derive relatively low coexcitation temperatures (&lt; 100 k) and optical depths (tau&lt;1). performing anon-lte excitation analysis using radex, we find that the co lines measured byz-spec (from j=4-&gt;3 to 10-&gt;9, depending on the galaxy) localize the bestsolutions to either a high-temperature / low-density region, or alow-temperature / high-density region near the lte solution, with the opticaldepth varying accordingly. observations of additional co lines, co(1-0) inparticular, are needed to constrain the non-lte models.

1103.0862	mesmer: meerkat search for molecules in the epoch of reionization	[abridged] observations of molecular gas at all redshifts are critical formeasuring the cosmic evolution in molecular gas density and understanding thestar-formation history of the universe. the 12co molecule (j=1-0 transition =115.27 ghz) is the best proxy for extragalactic h2, which is the gas reservoirfrom which star formation occurs, and has been detected out to z~6. typically,redshifted high-j lines are observed at mm-wavelengths, the most commonlytargeted systems exhibiting high sfrs (e.g. submm galaxies), and far-ir-brightqsos. while the most luminous objects are the most readily observed, detectionsof more typical galaxies with modest sfrs are essential for completing thepicture. alma will be revolutionary in terms of increasing the detection rateand pushing the sensitivity limit down to include such galaxies, however thelimited fov when observing at such high frequencies makes it difficult to usealma for studies of the large-scale structure traced out by molecular gas ingalaxies. this article introduces a strategy for a systematic search formolecular gas during the eor (z~7 and above), capitalizing on the fact that thej=1-0 transition of 12co enters the upper bands of cm-wave instruments athigh-z. the fov advantage gained by observing at such frequencies, coupled withmodern broadband correlators allows significant cosmological volumes to beprobed on reasonable timescales. in this article we present an overview of ourfuture observing programme which has been awarded 6,500 hours as one of thelarge survey projects for meerkat, the forthcoming south african ska pathfinderinstrument. its large fov and correlator bandwidth, and high-sensitivityprovide unprecedented survey speed for such work. an existing astrophysicalsimulation is coupled with instrumental considerations to demonstrate thefeasibility of such observations and predict detection rates.

1103.3905	herschel-atlas: the link between accretion luminosity and star formation  in quasar host galaxies	we use the science demonstration field data of the herschel-atlas to studyhow star formation, traced by the far-infrared herschel data, is related toboth the accretion luminosity and redshift of quasars selected from the sloandigital sky survey and the 2slaq survey. by developing a maximum likelihoodestimator to investigate the presence of correlations between the far-infraredand optical luminosities we find evidence that the star-formation in quasarhosts is correlated with both redshift and quasar accretion luminosity.assuming a relationship of the form l_ir \propto l_qso^{\theta} (1 +z)^{\zeta}, we find {\theta} = 0.22 +/- 0.08 and {\zeta} = 1.6 +/- 0.4,although there is substantial additional uncertainty in {\zeta} of order +/- 1,due to uncertainties in the host galaxy dust temperature. we find evidence fora large intrinsic dispersion in the redshift dependence, but no evidence forintrinsic dispersion in the correlation between l_qso and l_ir, suggesting thatthe latter may be due to a direct physical connection between star formationand black hole accretion. this is consistent with the idea that both the quasaractivity and star formation are dependent on the same reservoir of cold gas, sothat they are both affected by the influx of cold gas during mergers or heatingof gas via feedback processes.

1108.3911	herschel-atlas galaxy counts and high redshift luminosity functions: the  formation of massive early type galaxies	exploiting the herschel-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp) survey data,we have determined the luminosity functions (lfs) at rest-frame wavelengths of100 and 250 micron and at several redshifts z&gt;1, for bright sub-mm galaxieswith star formation rates (sfr) &gt;100 m_sun/yr. we find that the evolution ofthe comoving lf is strong up to z~2.5, and slows down at higher redshifts. fromthe lfs and the information on halo masses inferred from clustering analysis,we derived an average relation between sfr and halo mass (and its scatter). wealso infer that the timescale of the main episode of dust-enshrouded starformation in massive halos (m_h&gt;3*10^12 m_sun) amounts to ~7*10^8 yr. given thesfrs, which are in the range 10^2-10^3 m_sun/yr, this timescale implies finalstellar masses of order of 10^11-10^12 m_sun. the corresponding stellar massfunction matches the observed mass function of passively evolving galaxies atz&gt;1. the comparison of the statistics for sub-mm and uv selected galaxiessuggests that the dust-free, uv bright phase, is &gt;10^2 times shorter than thesub-mm bright phase, implying that the dust must form soon after the onset ofstar formation. using a single reference spectral energy distribution (sed; theone of the z~2.3 galaxy smm j2135-0102), our simple physical model is able toreproduce not only the lfs at different redshifts &gt; 1 but also the counts atwavelengths ranging from 250 micron to ~1 mm. owing to the steepness of thecounts and their relatively broad frequency range, this result suggests thatthe dispersion of sub-mm seds of z&gt;1 galaxies around the reference one israther small.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1202.0402	herschel-atlas: towards a sample of ~1000 strongly-lensed galaxies	while the selection of strongly lensed galaxies with 500{\mu}m flux densitys_500&gt;100 mjy has proven to be rather straightforward (negrello et al. 2010),for many applications it is important to analyze samples larger than the onesobtained when confining ourselves to such a bright limit. moreover, only byprobing to fainter flux densities is possible to exploit strong lensing toinvestigate the bulk of the high-z star-forming galaxy population. we describehalos (the herschel-atlas lensed objects selection), a method for efficientlyselecting fainter candidate strongly lensed galaxies, reaching a surfacedensity of ~1.5-2 deg^-2, i.e. a factor of about 4 to 6 higher than that at the100 mjy flux limit. halos will allow the selection of up to ~1000 candidatestrongly lensed galaxies (with amplifications \mu&gt;2) over the full h-atlassurvey area. applying halos to the h-atlas science demonstration phase field(~14.4 deg^2) we find 31 candidate strongly lensed galaxies, whose candidatelenses are identified in the viking near-infrared catalog. using the availableinformation on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a~72% purity of the sample. the redshift distribution of the candidate lensedsources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensedgalaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to substantially higherredshifts than found in the other surveys. the counts of candidate stronglylensed galaxies are also in good agreement with model predictions (lapi et al.2011). even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infraredviking photometry, we show that h-atlas data alone allow the selection of asimilarly deep sample of candidate strongly lensed galaxies with an efficiencyclose to 50%; a slightly lower surface density (~1.45 deg^-2) can be reachedwith a ~70% efficiency.

1205.1929	mining the herschel-atlas: submillimeter-selected blazars in equatorial  fields	the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) provides anunprecedented opportunity to search for blazars at sub-mm wavelengths. wecross-matched the first radio source catalogue with the 11655 sources brighterthan 35 mjy at 500{\mu}m in the \sim 135 square degrees of the sky covered bythe h-atlas equatorial fields at 9 h and 15 h, plus half of the field at 12 h.we found that 379 of the h-atlas sources have a first counterpart within 10arcsec, including 8 catalogued blazars (plus one known blazar that was found atthe edge of one the h-atlas maps). to search for additional blazar candidateswe have devised new diagnostic diagrams and found that known blazars occupy aregion of the log(s500{\mu}m/s350{\mu}m) vs. log(s500{\mu}m/s1.4ghz) planeseparated from that of the other sub-mm sources with radio counterparts. usingthis diagnostic we have selected 12 further candidates that turn out to bescattered in the (r-z) vs. (u-r) plane or in the wise colour-colour diagramproposed by massaro et al. (2012), where known blazars are concentrated in welldefined strips. this suggests that the majority of them either are not blazarsor have spectral energy distributions contaminated by their host galaxies. asignificant fraction of true blazars are found to be hosted by star-forminggalaxies. this finding, supported by an analysis of blazars detected in planck545 and 857 ghz bands, is at odds with the notion that blazar hosts are passiveellipticals and indicates that the sub-mm selection is providing a novelprospect on blazar properties. based on an inspection of the availablephotometric data, including the wise all-sky survey, the unpublished vikingsurvey and new radio observations, we tentatively estimate that there are 11blazars with synchrotron flux density s500{\mu}m &gt; 35mjy over the consideredarea. this result already allows us to constrain blazar evolution models.

1205.4058	the sizes, masses and specific star-formation rates of massive galaxies  at 1.3&lt;z&lt;1.5: strong evidence in favour of evolution via minor mergers	we report the results of a comprehensive study of the relationship betweengalaxy size, stellar mass and specific star-formation rate (ssfr) at redshifts1.3&lt;z&lt;1.5. based on a mass complete (m_star &gt;= 6x10^10 msun), spectroscopicsample from the ukidss ultra-deep survey (uds), with accurate stellar-massmeasurements derived from spectro photometric fitting, we find that at z~1.4the location of massive galaxies on the size-mass plane is determined primarilyby their ssfr. at this epoch we find that massive galaxies which are passive(ssfr &lt;= 0.1 gyr^-1) follow a tight size-mass relation, with half-light radii afactor f=2.4+/-0.2 smaller than their local counterparts. moreover, amongst thepassive sub-sample we find no evidence that the off-set from the localsize-mass relation is a function of stellar population age. based on asub-sample with dynamical mass estimates we also derive an independent estimateof f=2.3+/-0.3 for the typical growth in half-light radius between z~1.4 andthe present day. focusing on the passive sub-sample, we conclude that toproduce the necessary evolution predominantly via major mergers would requirean unfeasible number of merger events and over populate the high-mass end ofthe local stellar mass function. in contrast, we find that a scenario in whichmass accretion is dominated by minor mergers can produce the necessaryevolution, whereby an increase in stellar mass by a factor of ~2, accompaniedby an increase in size by a factor of ~3.5, is sufficient to reconcile thesize-mass relation at z~1.4 with that observed locally. finally, we note that asignificant fraction (44+/-12%) of the passive galaxies in our sample have adisk-like morphology, providing additional evidence that separate physicalprocesses are responsible for the quenching of star-formation and themorphological transformation of massive galaxies (abridged).

1207.2724	a detailed gravitational lens model based on submillimeter array and  keck adaptive optics imaging of a herschel-atlas sub-millimeter galaxy at  z=4.243	we present high-spatial resolution imaging obtained with the submillimeterarray (sma) at 880um and the keck adaptive optics (ao) system at ks-band of agravitationally lensed sub-millimeter galaxy (smg) at z=4.243 discovered in theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey. the sma data (angularresolution ~0.6") resolve the dust emission into multiple lensed images, whilethe keck ao ks-band data (angular resolution ~0.1") resolve the lens into apair of galaxies separated by 0.3". we present an optical spectrum of theforeground lens obtained with the gemini-south telescope that provides a lensredshift of z_lens = 0.595 +/- 0.005. we develop and apply a new lens modelingtechnique in the visibility plane that shows that the smg is magnified by afactor of mu = 4.1 +/- 0.2 and has an intrinsic infrared (ir) luminosity ofl_ir = (2.1 +/- 0.2) x 10^13 lsun. we measure a half-light radius of thebackground source of r_s = 4.4 +/- 0.5 kpc which implies an ir luminositysurface density of sigma_ir = (3.4 +/- 0.9) x 10^11 lsun kpc^-2, a value thatis typical of z &gt; 2 smgs but significantly lower than ir luminous galaxies atz~0. the two lens galaxies are compact (r_lens ~ 0.9 kpc) early-types witheinstein radii of theta_e1 = 0.57 +/- 0.01 and theta_e2 = 0.40 +/- 0.01 thatimply masses of m_lens1 = (7.4 +/- 0.5) x 10^10 msun and m_lens2 = (3.7 +/-0.3) x 10^10 msun. the two lensing galaxies are likely about to undergo adissipationless merger, and the mass and size of the resultant system should besimilar to other early-type galaxies at z~0.6. this work highlights theimportance of high spatial resolution imaging in developing models of stronglylensed galaxies discovered by herschel.

1209.0670	herschel-atlas: the far-infrared properties and star-formation rates of  broad absorption line quasi-stellar objects	we have used data from the herschel-atlas at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m todetermine the far-infrared (fir) properties of 50 broad absorption line quasars(bal qsos). our sample contains 49 high-ionization bal qsos (hibals) and 1low-ionization bal qso (lobal) which are compared against a sample of 329non-bal qsos. these samples are matched over the redshift range 1.5 \leq z &lt;2.3 and in absolute i-band magnitude over the range -28 \leq m_{i} \leq -24. ofthese, 3 bal qsos (hibals) and 27 non-bal qsos are detected at the &gt; 5 sigmalevel. we calculate star-formation rates (sfr) for our individually detectedhibal qsos and the non-detected lobal qso as well as average sfrs for the baland non-bal qso samples based on stacking the herschel data. we find nodifference between the hibal and non-bal qso samples in the fir, even whenseparated based on differing bal qso classifications. using mrk 231 as atemplate, the weighted mean sfr is estimated to be \approx240\pm21 m_{\odot}yr^{-1} for the full sample, although this figure should be treated as an upperlimit if agn-heated dust makes a contribution to the fir emission. despitetentative claims in the literature, we do not find a dependence of {\sc c\,iv}equivalent width on fir emission, suggesting that the strength of any outflowin these objects is not linked to their fir output. these results stronglysuggest that bal qsos (more specifically hibals) can be accommodated within asimple agn unified scheme in which our line-of-sight to the nucleus intersectsoutflowing material. models in which hibals are caught towards the end of aperiod of enhanced spheroid and black-hole growth, during which a windterminates the star-formation activity, are not supported by the observed firproperties.

1211.6440	herschel-atlas/gama: a difference between star-formation rates in  strong-line and weak-line radio galaxies	we have constructed a sample of radio-loud objects with optical spectroscopyfrom the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project over the herschel-atlas phase1 fields. classifying the radio sources in terms of their optical spectra, wefind that strong-emission-line sources (`high-excitation radio galaxies') have,on average, a factor ~4 higher 250-micron herschel luminosity than weak-line(`low-excitation') radio galaxies and are also more luminous thanmagnitude-matched radio-quiet galaxies at the same redshift. using all fiveh-atlas bands, we show that this difference in luminosity between theemission-line classes arises mostly from a difference in the average dusttemperature; strong-emission-line sources tend to have comparable dust massesto, but higher dust temperatures than, radio galaxies with weak emission lines.we interpret this as showing that radio galaxies with strong nuclear emissionlines are much more likely to be associated with star formation in their hostgalaxy, although there is certainly not a one-to-one relationship between starformation and strong-line agn activity. the strong-line sources are estimatedto have star-formation rates at least a factor 3-4 higher than those in theweak-line objects. our conclusion is consistent with earlier work, generallycarried out using much smaller samples, and reinforces the general picture ofhigh-excitation radio galaxies as being located in lower-mass, less evolvedhost galaxies than their low-excitation counterparts.

1305.6154	comparison of hi and optical redshifts of galaxies - the impact of  redshift uncertainties on spectral line stacking	accurate optical redshifts will be critical for spectral co-adding techniquesused to extract detections from below the noise level in ongoing and upcomingsurveys for hi, which will extend our current understanding of gas reservoirsin galaxies to lower column densities and higher redshifts. we have usedexisting, high quality optical and radio data from the sdss and alfalfa surveysto investigate the relationship between redshifts derived from opticalspectroscopy and neutral hydrogen (hi) spectral line observations. we find thatthe two redshift measurements agree well, with a negligible systematic offsetand a small distribution width. employing simple simulations, we determine howthe width of an ideal stacked hi profile depends on these redshift offsets, aswell as larger redshift errors more appropriate for high redshift galaxysurveys. the width of the stacked profile is dominated by the widthdistribution of the input individual profiles when the redshift errors are lessthan the median width of the input profiles, and only when the redshift errorsbecome large, ~150 km/s, do they significantly affect the width of the stackedprofile. this redshift accuracy can be achieved with moderate resolutionoptical spectra. we provide guidelines for the number of spectra required forstacking to reach a specified mass sensitivity, given telescope and surveyparameters, which will be useful for planning optical spectroscopy observingcampaigns to supplement the radio data.

1306.6333	chronos: a nir spectroscopic galaxy survey. from the formation of  galaxies to the peak of activity	chronos is our response to esa's call for white papers to define the sciencefor the future l2, l3 missions. chronos targets the formation and evolution ofgalaxies, by collecting the deepest nir spectroscopic data, from the formationof the first galaxies at z~10 to the peak of formation activity at z~1-3. thestrong emission from the atmospheric background makes this type of surveyimpossible from a ground-based observatory. the spectra of galaxies representthe equivalent of a dna fingerprint, containing information about the pasthistory of star formation and chemical enrichment. the proposed survey willallow us to dissect the formation process of galaxies including the timescalesof quenching triggered by star formation or agn activity, the effect ofenvironment, the role of infall/outflow processes, or the connection betweenthe galaxies and their underlying dark matter haloes. to provide these data,the mission requires a 2.5m space telescope optimised for a campaign of verydeep nir spectroscopy. a combination of a high multiplex and very longintegration times will result in the deepest, largest, high-qualityspectroscopic dataset of galaxies from z=1 to 12, spanning the history of theuniverse, from 400 million to 6 billion years after the big bang, i.e. coveringthe most active half of cosmic history.

1307.6566	the preferentially magnified active nucleus in iras f10214+4724 - iii.  vlbi observations of the radio core	we report 1.7 ghz very long baseline interferometry (vlbi) observations ofiras f10214+4724, a lensed z=2.3 obscured quasar with prodigious starformation. we detect what we argue to be the obscured active nucleus with aneffective angular resolution of &lt; 50 pc at z = 2.3 . the s_{1.7} = 210 micro-jy(9-\sigma) detection of this unresolved source is located within the hstrest-frame ultraviolet/optical arc, however, &gt;~100 mas northward of the arccentre of curvature. this leads to a source plane inversion that places theeuropean vlbi network detection to within milli-arcseconds of the modelled cuspcaustic, resulting in a very large magnification (\mu ~70), over an order ofmagnitude larger than the co (1-0) derived magnification of a spatiallyresolved jvla map, using the same lens model. we estimate the quasar bolometricluminosity from a number of independent techniques and with our x-ray modellingfind evidence that the agn may be close to compton-thick, with an intrinsicbolometric luminosity log(l_{bol,qso} / l_sun) = 11.34 +- 0.27 dex. we make thefirst black hole mass estimate of iras f10214+4724 and find log(m_{bh}/m_sun) =8.36 +- 0.56 which suggests a low black hole accretion rate (\lambda = \dot{m}/ \dot{m}_{edd} ~ 3\pm^7_2 percent). we find evidence for a m_{bh}/m_{spheroid}ratio that is 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than that of submillimetregalaxies (smgs) at z~2. at face value, this suggests iras f10214+4724 hasundergone a different evolutionary path compared to smgs at the same epoch. aprimary result of this work is the demonstration that emission regions ofdiffering size and position can undergo significantly different magnificationboosts (&gt; 1 dex) and therefore distort our view of high-redshift,gravitationally lensed galaxies.

1308.4406	herschel-atlas: correlations between dust and gas in local  submm-selected galaxies	we present an analysis of co molecular gas tracers in a sample of500{\mu}m-selected herschel-atlas galaxies at z&lt;0.05 (cz&lt;14990km/s). using22-500{\mu}m photometry from wise, iras and herschel, with hi data from theliterature, we investigate correlations between warm and cold dust, and tracersof the gas in different phases. the correlation between global co(3-2) linefluxes and fir-submillimetre fluxes weakens with increasing ir wavelength({\lambda}&gt;60{\mu}m), as a result of colder dust being less strongly associatedwith dense gas. conversely, co(2-1) and hi line fluxes both appear to be bettercorrelated with longer wavelengths, suggesting that cold dust is more stronglyassociated with diffuse atomic and molecular gas phases, consistent with itbeing at least partially heated by radiation from old stellar populations. theincreased scatter at long wavelengths implies that submillimetre fluxes are apoorer tracer of sfr. fluxes at 22 and 60{\mu}m are also better correlated withdiffuse gas tracers than dense co(3-2), probably due to very-small-grainemission in the diffuse interstellar medium, which is not correlated with sfr.the fir/co luminosity ratio and the dust mass/co luminosity ratio both decreasewith increasing luminosity, as a result of either correlations between mass andmetallicity (changing co/h2) or between co luminosity and excitation [changingco(3-2)/co(1-0)].

1308.4843	the wise properties of complete samples of radio-loud agn	we present an analysis of four complete samples of radio-loud agn (3crr, 2jy,6ce and 7ce) using near- and mid-ir data taken by the wide-field infraredsurvey explorer (wise). the combined sample consists of 79 quasars and 273radio galaxies, and covers a redshift range 0.003&lt;z&lt;3.395. the dichotomy in themid-ir properties of low- and high-excitation radio galaxies (lergs - hergs) isanalysed for the first time using large complete samples. our resultsdemonstrate that a division in the accretion modes of lergs and hergs clearlystands out in the mid-ir-radio plane (l_(22 \mu m) = 5x10^(43) erg s^(-1)).this means that wise data can be effectively used to diagnose accretion modesin radio-loud agn. the mid-ir properties of all objects were analysed to testthe unification between quasars and radio galaxies, consistent with earlierwork and we argue that smooth torus models best reproduce the observation.quasars are found to have higher mid-ir luminosities than radio galaxies. wealso studied all the sources in the near-ir to gain insights into evolution ofagn host galaxies. a relation found between the near-ir luminosity andredshift, well-known in the near-ir, is apparent in the two near-ir wise bands,supporting the idea that radio sources are hosted by massive ellipticalgalaxies that formed their stars at high redshifts and evolved passivelythereafter. evaluation of the positions of the sample objects in wisecolour-colour diagrams shows that widely used wise colour cuts are notcompletely reliable in selecting agn.

1309.0358	evolution of faint radio sources in the video-xmm3 field	it has been speculated that low luminosity radio-loud agn have the potentialto serve as an important source of agn feedback, and may be responsible forsuppressing star-formation activity in massive elliptical galaxies at latetimes. as such the cosmic evolution of these sources is vitally important tounderstanding the significance of such agn feedback processes and theirinfluence on the global star-formation history of the universe. in this paperwe present a new investigation of the evolution of faint radio sources out to$z{\sim}2.5$. we combine a 1 square degree vla radio survey, complete to adepth of 100 $\mu$jy, with accurate 10 band photometric redshifts from thevideo and cfhtls surveys. the results indicate that the radio populationexperiences mild positive evolution out to $z{\sim}1.2$ increasing their spacedensity by a factor of $\sim$3, consistent with results of several previousstudies. beyond $z$=1.2 there is evidence of a slowing down of this evolution.star-forming galaxies drive the more rapid evolution at low redshifts,$z{&lt;}$1.2, while more slowly evolving agn populations dominate at higherredshifts resulting in a decline in the evolution of the radio luminosityfunction at $z{&gt;}$1.2. the evolution is best fit by pure luminosity evolutionwith star-forming galaxies evolving as $(1+z)^{2.47\pm0.12}$ and agn as$(1+z)^{1.18\pm0.21}$.

1309.4102	isothermal dust models of herschel-atlas galaxies	we use galaxies from the herschel-atlas survey, and a suite of ancillarysimulations based on an isothermal dust model, to study our ability todetermine the effective dust temperature, luminosity and emissivity index of250um selected galaxies in the local universe (z &lt; 0.5). as well as simplefar-infrared sed fitting of individual galaxies based on chi^2 minimisation, weattempt to derive the best global isothermal properties of 13,826 galaxies withreliable optical counterparts and spectroscopic redshifts. using oursimulations, we highlight the fact that applying traditional sed fittingtechniques to noisy observational data in the herschel space observatory bandsintroduces artificial anti-correlation between derived values of dusttemperature and emissivity index. this is true even for galaxies with the mostrobust detections in our sample, making the results hard to interpret. we applya method to determine the best-fit global values of isothermal effectivetemperature and emissivity index for z &lt; 0.5 galaxies in h-atlas, deriving t =22.3 +/- 0.1k and beta = 1.98 +/- 0.02 (or t = 23.5 +/- 0.1k and beta = 1.82+/- 0.02 if we attempt to correct for bias by assuming that t and beta areindependent and normally distributed). we use our technique to test for anevolving emissivity index, finding only weak evidence. the median dustluminosity of our sample is log(ldust/lsolar) = 10.72 +/- 0.05 which (unlike t)shows little dependence on the choice of beta used in our analysis, includingwhether it is variable or fixed. we use a further suite of simulations toemphasise the importance of the h-atlas pacs data for deriving dusttemperatures at these redshifts, even though they are less sensitive than thespire data. the majority of galaxies detected by h-atlas are normalstar-forming galaxies, though a substantial minority (~31%) fall in theluminous infrared galaxy category.

1312.5618	probing the accelerating universe with radio weak lensing in the jvla  sky survey	we outline the prospects for performing pioneering radio weak gravitationallensing analyses using observations from a potential forthcoming jvla skysurvey program. a large-scale survey with the jvla can offer interesting andunique opportunities for performing weak lensing studies in the radio band, afield which has until now been the preserve of optical telescopes. inparticular, the jvla has the capacity for large, deep radio surveys withrelatively high angular resolution, which are the key characteristics requiredfor a successful weak lensing study. we highlight the potential advantages andunique aspects of performing weak lensing in the radio band. in particular, theinclusion of continuum polarisation information can greatly reduce noise inweak lensing reconstructions and can also remove the effects of intrinsicgalaxy alignments, the key astrophysical systematic effect that limits weaklensing at all wavelengths. we identify a vlass "deep fields" program (totalarea ~10-20 square degs), to be conducted at l-band and with high-resolution(a-array configuration), as the optimal survey strategy from the point of viewof weak lensing science. such a survey will build on the unique strengths ofthe jvla and will remain unsurpassed in terms of its combination of resolutionand sensitivity until the advent of the square kilometre array. we identify thebest fields on the jvla-accessible sky from the point of view of overlappingwith existing deep optical and near infra-red data which will provide crucialredshift information and facilitate a host of additional compellingmulti-wavelength science.

1403.0882	evolution in the bias of faint radio sources to z ~ 2.2	quantifying how the baryonic matter traces the underlying dark matterdistribution is key to both understanding galaxy formation and our ability toconstrain the cosmological model. using the cross-correlation function of radioand near-infrared galaxies, we present a large-scale clustering analysis ofradio galaxies to z ~ 2.2. we measure the angular auto-correlation function ofks &lt; 23.5 galaxies in the video-xmm3 field with photometric redshifts out to z= 4 using video and cfhtls photometry in the near-infrared and optical. we thenuse the cross-correlation function of these sources with 766 radio sources ats_1.4 &gt; 90 {\mu}jy to infer linear bias of radio galaxies in four redshiftbins. we find that the bias evolves from b = 0.57 +/- 0.06 at z ~ 0.3 to 8.55+/- 3.11 at z ~ 2.2. furthermore, we separate the radio sources into subsamplesto determine how the bias is dependent on the radio luminosity, and find a biaswhich is significantly higher than predicted by the simulations of wilman etal., and consistent with the lower luminosity but more abundant fr-i populationhaving a similar bias to the highly luminous but rare fr-iis. our results aresuggestive of a higher mass, particularly for fr-i sources than assumed insimulations, especially towards higher redshift.

1404.5676	herschel-atlas: far-infrared properties of radio-loud and radio-quiet  quasars	we have constructed a sample of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars from thefaint im- ages radio sky at twenty-one centimetres (first) and the sloandigital sky survey data release 7 (sdss dr7), over the h-atlas phase 1 area(9h, 12h and 14.5h). using a stacking analysis we find a significantcorrelation between the far-infrared luminosity and 1.4-ghz luminosity forradio-loud quasars. partial correlation analysis confirms the intrinsiccorrelation after removing the redshift contribution while for radio-quietquasars no partial correlation is found. using a single-temperature grey-bodymodel we find a general trend of lower dust temperatures in the case ofradio-loud quasars comparing to radio-quiet quasars. also, radio-loud quasarsare found to have almost constant mean values of dust mass along redshift andoptical luminosity bins. in addition, we find that radio-loud quasars at loweroptical luminosities tend to have on average higher fir and 250-micronluminosity with respect to radio-quiet quasars with the same opticalluminosites. even if we use a two-temperature grey-body model to describe thefir data, the fir luminosity excess remains at lower optical luminosities.these results suggest that powerful radio jets are associated with starformation especially at lower accretion rates.

1406.6365	a close-pair binary in a distant triple supermassive black-hole system	galaxies are believed to evolve through merging, which should lead tomultiple supermassive black holes in some. there are four known triple blackhole systems, with the closest pair being 2.4 kiloparsecs apart (the thirdcomponent is more distant at 3 kiloparsecs), which is far from thegravitational sphere of influence of a black hole with mass $\sim$10$^9$m$_\odot$ (about 100 parsecs). previous searches for compact black hole systemsconcluded that they were rare, with the tightest binary system having aseparation of 7 parsecs. here we report observations of a triple black holesystem at redshift z=0.39, with the closest pair separated by $\sim$140parsecs. the presence of the tight pair is imprinted onto the properties of thelarge-scale radio jets, as a rotationally-symmetric helical modulation, whichprovides a useful way to search for other tight pairs without needing extremelyhigh resolution observations. as we found this tight pair after searching onlysix galaxies, we conclude that tight pairs are more common than hithertobelieved, which is an important observational constraint for low-frequencygravitational wave experiments.

1409.1218	why z &gt; 1 radio-loud galaxies are commonly located in proto-clusters	distant powerful radio-loud active galactic nuclei (rlagn) tend to reside indense environments and are commonly found in proto-clusters at z &gt; 1.3. weexamine whether this occurs because rlagn are hosted by massive galaxies, whichpreferentially reside in rich environments. we compare the environments ofpowerful rlagn at 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.2 from the carla survey to a sample ofradio-quiet galaxies matched in mass and redshift. we find the environments ofrlagn are significantly denser than those of radio-quiet galaxies, implyingthat not more than 50% of massive galaxies in this epoch can host powerfulradio-loud jets. this is not an observational selection effect as we find noevidence to suggest it is easier to observe the radio emission when the galaxyresides in a dense environment. we therefore suggest that the dense mpc-scaleenvironment fosters the formation of a radio-jet from an agn. we show that thenumber density of potential rlagn host galaxies is consistent with every &gt;10^14 solar mass cluster having experienced powerful radio-loud feedback ofduration ~60 myr during 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.2. this feedback could heat theintracluster medium to the extent of 0.5-1 kev per gas particle, which couldlimit the amount of gas available for further star formation in theproto-cluster galaxies.

1411.7680	subarcsecond international lofar radio images of the m82 nucleus at 118  mhz and 154 mhz	the nuclear starburst in the nearby galaxy m82 provides an excellentlaboratory for understanding the physics of star formation. this galaxy hasbeen extensively observed in the past, revealing tens of radio-bright compactobjects embedded in a diffuse free-free absorbing medium. our understanding ofthe structure and physics of this medium in m82 can be greatly improved byhigh-resolution images at low frequencies where the effects of free-freeabsorption are most prominent.  the aims of this study are, firstly, to demonstrate imaging usinginternational baselines of the low frequency array (lofar), and secondly, toconstrain low-frequency spectra of compact and diffuse emission in the centralstarburst region of m82 via high-resolution radio imaging at low frequencies.  the international lofar telescope was used to observe m82 at 110-126mhz and146-162mhz. images were obtained using standard techniques from very longbaseline interferometry. images were obtained at each frequency range: one onlyusing international baselines, and one only using the longest dutch (remote)baselines.  the 154mhz image obtained using international baselines is a new imagingrecord in terms of combined image resolution (0.3$"$) and sensitivity($\sigma$=0.15mjy/beam) at low frequencies ($&lt;327$mhz). we detected 16 objectsat 154mhz, six of these also at 118mhz. four weaker but resolved features arealso found: a linear (50pc) filament and three other resolved objects, of whichtwo show a clear shell structure. we do not detect any emission from eithersupernova 2008iz or from the radio transient source 43.78+59.3. the imagesobtained using remote baselines show diffuse emission, associated with theoutflow in m82, with reduced brightness in the region of the edge-onstar-forming disk.

1412.0852	variation of galactic cold gas reservoirs with stellar mass	the stellar and neutral hydrogen (hi) mass functions at z~0 are fundamentalbenchmarks for current models of galaxy evolution. a natural extension of thesebenchmarks is the two-dimensional distribution of galaxies in the plane spannedby stellar and hi mass, which provides a more stringent test of simulations, asit requires the hi to be located in galaxies of the correct stellar mass.combining hi data from the alfalfa survey, with optical data from sdss, we finda distinct envelope in the hi-to-stellar mass distribution, corresponding to anupper limit in the hi fraction that varies monotonically over five orders ofmagnitude in stellar mass. this upper envelope in hi fraction does not favourthe existence of a significant population of dark galaxies with large amountsof gas but no corresponding stellar population. the envelope shows a break at astellar mass of ~10^9 msun, which is not reproduced by modern models of galaxypopulations tracing both stellar and gas masses. the discrepancy betweenobservations and models suggests a mass dependence in gas storage andconsumption missing in current galaxy evolution prescriptions. the breakcoincides with the transition from galaxies with predominantly irregularmorphology at low masses to regular disks at high masses, as well as thetransition from cold to hot accretion of gas in simulations.

1507.01144	the host galaxies of micro-jansky radio sources	we combine a deep 0.5~deg$^2$, 1.4~ghz deep radio survey in the lockman holewith infrared and optical data in the same field, including the servs andukidss near-infrared surveys, to make the largest study to date of the hostgalaxies of radio sources with typical radio flux densities $\sim 50 \;\mu$jy.87% (1274/1467) of radio sources have identifications in servs to $ab\approx23.1$ at 3.6 or 4.5$\mu$m, and 9% are blended with bright objects (mostlystars), leaving only 4% (59 objects) which are too faint to confidentlyidentify in the near-infrared. we are able to estimate photometric redshiftsfor 68% of the radio sources. we use mid-infrared diagnostics to show that thesource population consists of a mixture of star forming galaxies, rapidlyaccreting (cold mode) agn and low accretion rate, hot mode agn, with neitheragn nor starforming galaxies clearly dominating. we see the breakdown in the$k-z$ relation in faint radio source samples, and show that it is due to radiosource populations becoming dominated by sources with radio luminosities $\sim10^{23}\;{\rm whz^{-1}}$. at these luminosities, both the star forming galaxiesand the cold mode agn have hosts with stellar luminosities about a factor oftwo lower than those of hot mode agn, which continue to reside in only the mostmassive hosts. we show that out to at least $z\sim 2$, galaxies with stellarmasses $&gt;10^{11.5}\, m_{\odot}$ have a radio-loud fraction up to $\sim 30$%.this is consistent with there being a sufficient number of radio sources thatradio-mode feedback could play a role in galaxy evolution.

1507.01552	$\textit{herschel}$-atlas:the connection between star formation and agn  activity in radio-loud and radio-quiet active galaxies	we examine the relationship between star formation and agn activity byconstructing matched samples of local ($0&lt;z&lt;0.6$) radio-loud and radio-quietagn in the $\textit{herschel}$-atlas fields. radio-loud agn are classified ashigh-excitation and low-excitation radio galaxies (hergs, lergs) using theiremission lines and $\textit{wise}$ 22-$\mu$m luminosity. agn accretion and jetpowers in these active galaxies are traced by [oiii] emission-line and radioluminosity, respectively. star formation rates (sfrs) and specific starformation rates (ssfrs) were derived using $\textit{herschel}$ 250-$\mu$mluminosity and stellar mass measurements from the sdss$-$mpa-jhu catalogue. inthe past, star formation studies of agn have mostly focused on high-redshiftsources to observe the thermal dust emission that peaks in the far-infrared,which limited the samples to powerful objects. however, with$\textit{herschel}$ we can expand this to low redshifts. our stacking analysesshow that sfrs and ssfrs of both radio-loud and radio-quiet agn increase withincreasing agn power but that radio-loud agn tend to have lower sfr.additionally, radio-quiet agn are found to have approximately an order ofmagnitude higher ssfrs than radio-loud agn for a given level of agn power. thedifference between the star formation properties of radio-loud and -quiet agnis also seen in samples matched in stellar mass.

1507.07272	radio galaxy zoo: host galaxies and radio morphologies derived from  visual inspection	we present results from the first twelve months of operation of radio galaxyzoo, which upon completion will enable visual inspection of over 170,000 radiosources to determine the host galaxy of the radio emission and the radiomorphology. radio galaxy zoo uses $1.4\,$ghz radio images from both the faintimages of the radio sky at twenty centimeters (first) and the australiatelescope large area survey (atlas) in combination with mid-infrared images at$3.4\,\mu$m from the {\it wide-field infrared survey explorer} (wise) and at$3.6\,\mu$m from the {\it spitzer space telescope}. we present the earlyanalysis of the wise mid-infrared colours of the host galaxies. for images inwhich there is $&gt;\,75\%$ consensus among the radio galaxy zoocross-identifications, the project participants are as effective as the scienceexperts at identifying the host galaxies. the majority of the identified hostgalaxies reside in the mid-infrared colour space dominated by ellipticalgalaxies, quasi-stellar objects (qsos), and luminous infrared radio galaxies(lirgs). we also find a distinct population of radio galaxy zoo host galaxiesresiding in a redder mid-infrared colour space consisting of star-forminggalaxies and/or dust-enhanced non star-forming galaxies consistent with ascenario of merger-driven active galactic nuclei (agn) formation. thecompletion of the full radio galaxy zoo project will measure the relativepopulations of these hosts as a function of radio morphology and power whileproviding an avenue for the identification of rare and extreme radiostructures. currently, we are investigating candidates for radio galaxies withextreme morphologies, such as giant radio galaxies, late-type host galaxieswith extended radio emission, and hybrid morphology radio sources.

0805.3413	a semi-empirical simulation of the extragalactic radio continuum sky for  next generation radio telescopes	we have developed a semi-empirical simulation of the extragalactic radiocontinuum sky suitable for aiding the design of next generation radiointerferometers such as the square kilometre array (ska). the emphasis is onmodelling the large-scale cosmological distribution of radio sources ratherthan the internal details of individual galaxies. here we provide a descriptionof the simulation to accompany the online release of a catalogue of 320 millionsimulated radio sources. the simulation covers 20x20 deg^2 - a plausible upperlimit to the instantaneous field of view attainable with future (e.g. ska)aperture array technologies - out to redshift z=20, and down to flux densitylimits of 10 njy at 151, 610 mhz, 1.4, 4.86 and 18 ghz. five distinct sourcetypes are included: radio-quiet agn, radio-loud agn of the fri and friistructural classes, and star-forming galaxies, the latter split intopopulations of quiescent and starbursting galaxies.  in our semi-empirical approach, the simulated sources are drawn from observed(or extrapolated) luminosity functions and grafted onto an underlying darkmatter density field with biases which reflect their measured large-scaleclustering. a numerical press-schechter-style filtering of the density field isused to identify and populate clusters of galaxies. radio source structures arebuilt from point source and elliptical sub-components, and for fri and friisources an orientation-based unification and beaming model is used to partitionflux between the core and extended lobes and hotspots. the simulation outputcan be post-processed to achieve more complete agreement with observationaldata in the years ahead, with the aim of using these 'idealised skies' intelescope simulators to optimise the design of the ska itself (abridged).

1508.07239	lofar discovery of a 700-kpc remnant radio galaxy at low redshift	remnant radio galaxies represent the final dying phase of radio galaxyevolution, in which the jets are no longer active. due to their rarity in fluxlimited samples and the difficulty of identification, this dying phase remainspoorly understood and the luminosity evolution largely unconstrained. here wepresent the discovery and detailed analysis of a large (700 kpc) remnant radiogalaxy with a low surface brightness that has been identified in lofar imagesat 150 mhz. by combining lofar data with new follow-up westerbork observationsand archival data at higher frequencies, we investigated the source morphologyand spectral properties from 116 to 4850 mhz. by modelling the radio spectrumwe probed characteristic timescales of the radio activity. the source has arelatively smooth, diffuse, amorphous appearance together with a very weakcentral compact core which is associated with the host galaxy located atz=0.051. from our ageing and morphological analysis it is clear that thenuclear engine is currently switched off or, at most, active at a very lowpower state. the host galaxy is currently interacting with another galaxylocated at a projected separation of 15 kpc and a radial velocity offset of 300km/s. this interaction may have played a role in the triggering and/or shutdown of the radio jets. the spectral shape of this remnant radio galaxy differsfrom the majority of the previously identified remnant sources, which showsteep or curved spectra at low to intermediate frequencies. in light of thisfinding and in preparation for new-generation deep low-frequency surveys, wediscuss the selection criteria to be used to select representative samples ofthese sources.

1601.00003	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 325 mhz radio luminosity function  of agn and star forming galaxies	measurement of the evolution of both active galactic nuclei (agn) andstar-formation in galaxies underpins our understanding of galaxy evolution overcosmic time. radio continuum observations can provide key information on thesetwo processes, in particular via the mechanical feedback produced by radio jetsin agn, and via an unbiased dust-independent measurement of star-formationrates. in this paper we determine radio luminosity functions at 325 mhz for asample of agn and star-forming galaxies by matching a 138 deg sq. radio surveyconducted with the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt), with optical imagingand redshifts from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. we find that theradio luminosity function at 325 mhz for star-forming galaxies closely followsthat measured at 1.4 ghz. by fitting the agn radio luminosity function out to$z = 0.5$ as a double power law, and parametrizing the evolution as ${\phi}\propto (1 + z)^{k}$ , we find evolution parameters of $k = 0.92 \pm 0.95$assuming pure density evolution and $k = 2.13 \pm 1.96$ assuming pureluminosity evolution. we find that the low excitation radio galaxies are thedominant population in space density at lower luminosities. comparing our 325mhz observations with radio continuum imaging at 1.4 ghz, we determine separateradio luminosity functions for steep and flat-spectrum agn, and show that thebeamed population of flat-spectrum sources in our sample can be shifted innumber density and luminosity to coincide with the unbeamed population ofsteep-spectrum sources, as is expected in the orientation based unification ofagn.

astro-ph;0204473	measuring the black hole masses of high redshift quasars	a new technique is presented for determining the black-hole masses ofhigh-redshift quasars from optical spectroscopy. the new method utilizes thefull-width half maximum (fwhm) of the low-ionization mgii emission line and thecorrelation between broad-line region (blr) radius and continuum luminosity at3000 angstroms. using archival uv spectra it is found that the correlationbetween blr radius and 3000 angstrom luminosity is tighter than the establishedcorrelation with 5100 angstrom luminosity. furthermore, it is found that thecorrelation between blr radius and 3000 ang luminosity is consistent with arelation of the form $r_{blr} \propto lambda l_{lambda}^{0.5}$, as expected fora constant ionization parameter. using a sample of objects with broad-lineradii determined from reverberation mapping it is shown that the fwhm of mgiiand h beta are consistent with following an exact one-to-one relation, asexpected if both h beta and mgii are emitted at the same radius from thecentral ionizing source. the resulting virial black-hole mass estimator basedon rest-frame uv observables is shown to reproduce black-hole mass measurementsbased on reverberation mapping to within a factor of 2.5 (1 sigma). finally,the new uv black-hole mass estimator is shown to produce identical results tothe established optical (h beta) estimator when applied to 128intermediate-redshift (0.3&lt;z&lt;0.9) quasars drawn from the large bright quasarsurvey and the radio-selected molonglo quasar sample. we therefore concludethat the new uv virial black-hole mass estimator can be reliably used toestimate the black-hole masses of quasars from z~0.25 through to the peak epochof quasar activity at z~2.5 via optical spectroscopy alone.

astro-ph;0209159	probing the absorbing haloes around two high-redshift radio galaxies  with vlt-uves	we present vlt-uves echelle spectroscopy of the hi and civ absorption in thespatially-extended lyman-alpha emission around two high-redshift radio galaxies0200+015 (z=2.23) and 0943-242 (z=2.92). the absorbers in 0943-242 exhibitlittle additional structure compared with previous low-resolution spectroscopyand the main absorber is still consistent with hi column density of ~10^19cm^-2. this is consistent with a picture in which the absorbing gas has lowdensity and low metallicity and is distributed in a smooth absorbing shelllocated beyond the emission-line gas. however, the main absorbers in 0200+015are very different. the previous single absorber fit of hi column density\~10^19 cm^-2, now splits into two ~4 x 10^14 cm^-2 absorbers which extend morethan 15kpc to obscure additional ly-alpha emission coincident with a radio lobein these high-resolution observations. although consistent with the shell-likedistribution for the absorption systems, 0200+015 requires a much higher metalenrichment than 0943-242. the metallicity, inferred from the civ absorption, isconsiderably lower in 0943-242 than in 0200+015. we explain these differenceswith an evolutionary scenario based on the size of the radio source. in bothsources the hi absorption gas originates from either a gas-rich merger orpristine cluster gas which cools and collapses towards the centre of the darkmatter halo. the higher metallicity in the larger radio source (0200+015) maybe a result of a starburst driven superwind (concurrent with the triggering ofthe radio emission) which has engulfed the outer halo in this older source.

astro-ph;0408203	the relationship between radio luminosity and black-hole mass in  optically-selected quasars	using a sample of more than 6000 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) we compare the black-hole mass distributions of radio-loud andradio-quiet quasars. based on the virial black-hole mass estimator theradio-loud quasars (rlqs) are found to harbour systematically more massiveblack holes than radio-quiet quasars (rqqs) with very high significance(&gt;&gt;99.99%), with mean black-hole masses of &lt;\log(m_{bh}/\msun)&gt;=8.89\pm0.02 and&lt;\log(m_{bh}/\msun)&gt;=8.69\pm0.01 for the rlqs and rqqs respectively. crucially,the new rlq and rqq samples have indistinguishable distributions on theredshift-optical luminosity plane, excluding the possibility that eitherparameter is responsible for the observed black-hole mass difference. moreover,this black-hole mass difference is shown to be in good agreement with theoptical luminosity difference observed between rlq and rqq host galaxies at lowredshift (i.e. \delta m_{host}=0.4-0.5 magnitudes). within the sdss samples,black-hole mass is strongly correlated with both radio luminosity and theradio-loudness $\mathcal{r}$ parameter (&gt;7 sigma significance), although therange in radio luminosity at a given black-hole mass is several orders ofmagnitude. it is therefore clear that the influence of additional physicalparameters or evolution must also be invoked to explain the quasarradio-loudness dichotomy.

astro-ph;0409687	evidence that powerful radio jets have a profound influence on the  evolution of galaxies	the relationships between supermassive black holes and the properties oftheir associated dark-matter halos imply that outflows from accreting blackholes provide a feedback mechanism regulating galaxy formation. accreting blackholes with weak or undetectable radio jets (radio-quiet quasars) outnumberthose with powerful jets (radio-loud quasars) by a factor ~10-100, sopowerful-jet outflows are often neglected. however, whenever powerful jets aretriggered, there is a dramatic (factor &gt;100) step-function increase in theefficiency of feedback. we use a feedback model, together with the measuredspace density of flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars, to show that a powerful-jetepisode probably occurred in every protocluster in the universe. before jettriggering, there was time for gravitational collapse to create many (~10-100)surrounding protogalaxies massive enough to host radio-quiet quasars. aftertriggering, the powerful jet pushes back and heats ionized gas so that itcannot fall onto these protogalaxies and cool. once neutral/molecular gasreservoirs become exhausted, there is a synchronized shut down in bothstar-formation and black-hole activity throughout the protocluster. theseconsiderations imply that radio-loud quasars have a profound influence on theevolution of all the galaxies seen in clusters today.

astro-ph;0607289	ionization of large-scale absorbing haloes and feedback events from  high-redshift radio galaxies	we present photoionization calculations for the spatially-extended absorbersobserved towards the extended emission line spectrum of two high-redshift radiogalaxies: 0943-242 (z=2.922) and 0200+015 (z=2.230), with the aim ofreproducing the absorber column ratio, n(civ)/n(hi). we explore the effects ofusing different uv continua in the photoionization calculations. a comparisonis drawn between the absorber in 0200+015 and the two absorbers in the lensedlynx arc nebula at z=3.36, which present similar n(civ)/n(hi) ratios. we findthat hot stars from a powerful starburst, or a metagalactic backgroundradiation (mbr) in which stars dominate over quasars, are equally successful inproducing the observed n(civ)/n(hi), assuming subsolar absorber metallicities.these softer seds eliminate the factor 1000 difference in metallicity betweenthe two absorbers encountered in earlier work assuming a powerlaw sed. thedetected level of continuum flux in 0943-242 is consistent with stellarionization. if the mbr is responsible for the ionization of the radio galaxyabsorbing shells, their radii (if spherical) would be large (&gt; 100 kpc) andtheir mass would be huge (&gt;1e12 m_sun), implying that a feedback event withinthe radiogalaxy has expelled more baryonic material than left within it. if, aswe believe more likely, stellar sources within the radiogalaxy are responsiblefor the absorber's ionization, smaller radii of ~25 kpc and much smaller masses(~1e8-1e10 m_sun) are inferred. this radius is consistent with the observedtransition in radio source size between smaller sources where strong hiabsorption is almost ubiquitous, and the larger sources where it is mostlylacking. finally, we outline additional absorption line diagnostics which couldfurther constrain the properties of the haloes and their ionization sources.
