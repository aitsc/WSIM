0902.2131	multi-frequency imaging of the galaxy cluster abell 2163 using the  sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	we used the apex-sz and laboca bolometer cameras on the apex telescope to mapthe decrement of the sunyaev-zeldovich effect at 150 ghz and the increment at345 ghz toward the galaxy cluster abell 2163. the sze images were used to modelthe radial density and temperature distribution of the icm, and to derive thegas mass fraction in the cluster under the assumption of hydrostaticequilibrium. we used the isothermal beta model to fit the szedecrement/increment radial profiles. we performed a simple, non-parametricde-projection of the radial density and temperature profiles, in conjunctionwith xmm-newton x-ray data, under the simplifying assumption of sphericalsymmetry. we combined the peak sze signals derived in this paper with publishedsze measurements of this cluster to derive the cluster line-of-sight bulkvelocity and the central comptonization, using priors on the icm temperature.we find that the best-fit isothermal model to the sze data is consistent withthe icm properties implied by the x-ray data, particularly inside the central 1mpc radius. although the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and sphericalsymmetry may not be optimal for this complex system, the results obtained underthese assumptions are consistent with x-ray and weak-lensing measurements. thisshows the applicability of the simple joint sze and x-ray de-projectiontechnique described in this paper for clusters with a wide range of dynamicalstates.

0904.3939	constraints on the high-l power spectrum of millimeter-wave anisotropies  from apex-sz	we present measurements of the angular power spectrum of millimeter waveanisotropies with the apex-sz instrument. apex-sz has mapped 0.8 square degreesof sky at a frequency of 150 ghz with an angular resolution of 1'. these newmeasurements significantly improve the constraints on anisotropy power at 150ghz over the range of angular multipoles 3000 &lt; l &lt; 10,000, limiting the totalastronomical signal in a flat band power to be less than 105 microk^2 at 95%cl. we expect both submillimeter-bright, dusty galaxies and to a lesser extentsecondary cmb anisotropies from the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) tosignificantly contribute to the observed power. subtracting the sze powerspectrum expected for sigma_8=0.8 and masking bright sources, the best fitvalue for the remaining power is c_l = 1.1^{+0.9}_{-0.8} x 10^{-5} micro k^2(1.7^{+1.4}_{-1.3} jy^2 sr^{-1}). this agrees well with model predictions forpower due to submillimeter-bright, dusty galaxies. comparing this power to thepower detected by blast at 600 ghz, we find the frequency dependence of thesource fluxes to be s_nu ~ nu^{2.6^{+0.4}_{-0.2}} if both experiments measurethe same population of sources. simultaneously fitting for the amplitude of thesze power spectrum and a poisson distributed point source population, we placean upper limit on the matter fluctuation amplitude of sigma_8 &lt; 1.18 at 95%confidence.

0911.2444	sunyaev-zel'dovich cluster profiles measured with the south pole  telescope	we present sunyaev-zel'dovich measurements of 15 massive x-ray selectedgalaxy clusters obtained with the south pole telescope. the sunyaev-zel'dovich(sz) cluster signals are measured at 150 ghz, and concurrent 220 ghz data areused to reduce astrophysical contamination. radial profiles are computed usinga technique that takes into account the effects of the beams and filtering. inseveral clusters, significant sz decrements are detected out to a substantialfraction of the virial radius. the profiles are fit to the beta model and to ageneralized nfw pressure profile, and are scaled and stacked to probe theiraverage behavior. we find model parameters that are consistent with previousstudies: beta=0.86 and r_core/r_500 = 0.20 for the beta model, and (alpha,beta, gamma, c_500)=(1.0,5.5,0.5,1.0) for the generalized nfw model. bothmodels fit the spt data comparably well, and both are consistent with theaverage sz profile out to the virial radius. the integrated compton-y parametery_sz is computed for each cluster using both model-dependent andmodel-independent techniques, and the results are compared to x-ray estimatesof cluster parameters. we find that y_sz scales with y_x and gas mass with lowscatter. since these observables have been found to scale with total mass, ourresults point to a tight mass-observable relation for the spt cluster survey.

0911.3905	non-parametric modeling of the intra-cluster gas using apex-sz bolometer  imaging data	we demonstrate the usability of mm-wavelength imaging data obtained from theapex-sz bolometer array to derive the radial temperature profile of the hotintra-cluster gas out to radius r_500 and beyond. the goal is to study thephysical properties of the intra-cluster gas by using a non-parametricde-projection method that is, aside from the assumption of spherical symmetry,free from modeling bias. we use publicly available x-ray imaging data from thexmm-newton observatory and our sunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) imaging datafrom the apex-sz experiment at 150 ghz to de-project the density andtemperature profiles for the relaxed cluster abell 2204. we derive the gasdensity, temperature and entropy profiles assuming spherical symmetry, andobtain the total mass profile under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium.for comparison with x-ray spectroscopic temperature models, a re-analysis ofthe recent chandra observation is done with the latest calibration updates.using the non-parametric modeling we demonstrate a decrease of gas temperaturein the cluster outskirts, and also measure the gas entropy profile. theseresults are obtained for the first time independently of x-ray spectroscopy,using sze and x-ray imaging data. the contribution of the sze systematicuncertainties in measuring t_e at large radii is shown to be small compared tothe chandra systematic spectroscopic errors. the upper limit on m_200 derivedfrom the non-parametric method is consistent with the nfw model prediction fromweak lensing analysis.

0912.2338	extragalactic millimeter-wave sources in south pole telescope survey  data: source counts, catalog, and statistics for an 87 square-degree field	we report the results of an 87 square-degree point-source survey centered atr.a. 5h30m, decl. -55 deg. taken with the south pole telescope (spt) at 1.4 and2.0 mm wavelengths with arc-minute resolution and milli-jansky depth. based onthe ratio of flux in the two bands, we separate the detected sources into twopopulations, one consistent with synchrotron emission from active galacticnuclei (agn) and one consistent with thermal emission from dust. we presentsource counts for each population from 11 to 640 mjy at 1.4 mm and from 4.4 to800 mjy at 2.0 mm. the 2.0 mm counts are dominated by synchrotron-dominatedsources across our reported flux range; the 1.4 mm counts are dominated bysynchroton-dominated sources above ~15 mjy and by dust-dominated sources belowthat flux level. we detect 141 synchrotron-dominated sources and 47dust-dominated sources at s/n &gt; 4.5 in at least one band. all of the mostsignificantly detected members of the synchrotron-dominated population areassociated with sources in previously published radio catalogs. some of thedust-dominated sources are associated with nearby (z &lt;&lt; 1) galaxies whose dustemission is also detected by the infrared astronomy satellite (iras). however,most of the bright, dust-dominated sources have no counterparts in any existingcatalogs. we argue that these sources represent the rarest and brightestmembers of the population commonly referred to as sub-millimeter galaxies(smgs). because these sources are selected at longer wavelengths than intypical smg surveys, they are expected to have a higher mean redshiftdistribution and may provide a new window on galaxy formation in the earlyuniverse.

0912.4315	angular power spectra of the millimeter wavelength background light from  dusty star-forming galaxies with the south pole telescope	we use data from the first 100 square-degree field observed by the south poletelescope (spt) in 2008 to measure the angular power spectrum of temperatureanisotropies contributed by the background of dusty star-forming galaxies(dsfgs) at millimeter wavelengths. from the auto and cross-correlation of 150and 220 ghz spt maps, we significantly detect both poisson distributed and, forthe first time at millimeter wavelengths, clustered components of power from abackground of dsfgs. the spectral indices between 150 and 220 ghz of thepoisson and clustered components are found to be 3.86 +- 0.23 and 3.8 +- 1.3respectively, implying a steep scaling of the dust emissivity index beta ~ 2.the poisson and clustered power detected in spt, blast (at 600, 860, and 1200ghz), and spitzer (1900 ghz) data can be understood in the context of a simplemodel in which all galaxies have the same graybody spectrum with dustemissivity index of beta = 2 and dust temperature t_d = 34 k. in this model,half of the 150 ghz background light comes from redshifts greater than 3.2. wealso use the spt data to place an upper limit on the amplitude of the kineticsunyaev-zel'dovich power spectrum at l = 3000 of 13 uk^2 at 95% confidence.

0912.4317	measurements of secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies with  the south pole telescope	we report cosmic microwave background (cmb) power spectrum measurements fromthe first 100 sq. deg. field observed by the south pole telescope (spt) at 150and 220 ghz. on angular scales where the primary cmb anisotropy is dominant,ell ~&lt; 3000, the spt power spectrum is consistent with the standard lambdacdmcosmology. on smaller scales, we see strong evidence for a point sourcecontribution, consistent with a population of dusty, star-forming galaxies.after we mask bright point sources, anisotropy power on angular scales of 3000&lt; ell &lt; 9500 is detected with a signal-to-noise &gt; 50 at both frequencies. wecombine the 150 and 220 ghz data to remove the majority of the point sourcepower, and use the point source subtracted spectrum to detectsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) power at 2.6 sigma. at ell=3000, the sz power in thesubtracted bandpowers is 4.2 +/- 1.5 uk^2, which is significantly lower thanthe power predicted by a fiducial model using wmap5 cosmological parameters.this discrepancy may suggest that contemporary galaxy cluster modelsoverestimate the thermal pressure of intracluster gas. alternatively, thisresult can be interpreted as evidence for lower values of sigma8. when combinedwith an estimate of the kinetic sz contribution, the measured sz amplitudeshifts sigma8 from the primary cmb anisotropy derived constraint of 0.794 +/-0.028 down to 0.773 +/- 0.025. the uncertainty in the constraint on sigma8 fromthis analysis is dominated by uncertainties in the theoretical modelingrequired to predict the amplitude of the sz power spectrum for a given set ofcosmological parameters.

1003.0003	galaxy clusters selected with the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from 2008  south pole telescope observations	we present a detection-significance-limited catalog of 21 sunyaev-zel'dovichselected galaxy clusters. these clusters, along with 1 unconfirmed candidate,were identified in 178 deg^2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the south poletelescope to a depth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz. optical imaging from theblanco cosmology survey (bcs) and magellan telescopes provided photometric (andin some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts rangingfrom z=0.15 to z&gt;1, with a median z = 0.74. of the 21 confirmed galaxyclusters, three were previously identified as abell clusters, three werepresented as spt discoveries in staniszewski et al, 2009, and three were firstidentified in a recent analysis of bcs data by menanteau et al, 2010; theremaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. simulatedobservations of the spt fields predict the sample to be nearly 100% completeabove a mass threshold of m_200 ~ 5x10^14 m_sun/h at z = 0.6. this completenessthreshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to ~4x10^14m_sun/h at z=1. the size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in goodagreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxyclusters and cosmology. in combination with other cosmological probes, we usethe cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. assuming astandard spatially flat wcdm cosmological model, the addition of our catalog tothe wmap 7-year analysis yields sigma_8 = 0.81 +- 0.09 and w = -1.07 +- 0.29, a~50% improvement in precision on both parameters over wmap7 alone.

1006.3068	x-ray properties of the first sze-selected galaxy cluster sample from  the south pole telescope	we present results of x-ray observations of a sample of 15 clusters selectedvia their imprint on the cosmic microwave background (cmb) from the thermalsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. these clusters are a subset of the firstsz-selected cluster catalog, obtained from observations of 178 deg^2 of skysurveyed by the south pole telescope. using x-ray observations with chandra andxmm-newton, we estimate the temperature, t_x, and mass, m_g, of theintracluster medium (icm) within r_500 for each cluster. from these, wecalculate y_x=m_g t_x and estimate the total cluster mass using a m_500-y_xscaling relation measured from previous x-ray studies. the integratedcomptonization, y_sz, is derived from the sz measurements, using additionalinformation from the x-ray measured gas density profiles and a universaltemperature profile. we calculate scaling relations between the x-ray and szobservables, and find results generally consistent with other measurements andthe expectations from simple self-similar behavior. specifically, we fit ay_sz-y_x relation and find a normalization of 0.82 +- 0.07, marginallyconsistent with the predicted ratio of y_sz/y_x=0.91+-0.01 that would beexpected from the density and temperature models used in this work. using they_x derived mass estimates, we fit a y_sz-m_500 relation and find a slopeconsistent with the self-similar expectation of y_sz ~ m^5/3 with anormalization consistent with predictions from other x-ray studies. we comparethe x-ray mass estimates to previously published sz mass estimates derived fromcosmological simulations of the spt survey. we find that the sz mass estimatesare lower by a factor of 0.89+-0.06, which is within the ~15% systematicuncertainty quoted for the simulation-based sz masses.

1012.4788	improved constraints on cosmic microwave background secondary  anisotropies from the complete 2008 south pole telescope data	we report measurements of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) powerspectrum from the complete 2008 south pole telescope (spt) data set. we analyzetwice as much data as the first spt power spectrum analysis, using an improvedcosmological parameter estimator which fits multi-frequency models to the spt150 and $220\,$ghz bandpowers. we find an excellent fit to the measuredbandpowers with a model that includes lensed primary cmb anisotropy, secondarythermal (tsz) and kinetic (ksz) sunyaev-zel'dovich anisotropies, unclusteredsynchrotron point sources, and clustered dusty point sources. in addition tomeasuring the power spectrum of dusty galaxies at high signal-to-noise, thedata primarily constrain a linear combination of the ksz and tsz anisotropycontributions at $150\,$ghz and $\ell=3000$: $d^{tsz}_{3000} +0.5\,d^{ksz}_{3000} = 4.5\pm 1.0 \,\mu{\rm k}^2$. the 95% confidence upperlimits on secondary anisotropy power are $d^{tsz}_{3000} &lt; 5.3\,\mu{\rm k}^2$and $d^{ksz}_{3000} &lt; 6.5\,\mu{\rm k}^2$. we also consider the potentialcorrelation of dusty and tsz sources, and find it incapable of relaxing the tszupper limit. these results increase the significance of the lower than expectedtsz amplitude previously determined from spt power spectrum measurements. wefind that models including non-thermal pressure support in groups and clusterspredict tsz power in better agreement with the spt data. combining the tszpower measurement with primary cmb data halves the statistical uncertainty on$\sigma_8$. however, the preferred value of $\sigma_8$ varies significantlybetween tsz models. improved constraints on cosmological parameters from tszpower spectrum measurements require continued progress in the modeling of thetsz power.

1101.1286	discovery and cosmological implications of spt-cl j2106-5844, the most  massive known cluster at z &gt; 1	using the south pole telescope (spt), we have discovered the most massiveknown galaxy cluster at z &gt; 1, spt-cl j2106-5844. in addition to producing astrong sunyaev-zel'dovich effect signal, this system is a luminous x-ray sourceand its numerous constituent galaxies display spatial and color clustering, allindicating the presence of a massive galaxy cluster. vlt and magellanspectroscopy of 18 member galaxies shows that the cluster is at z =1.132^+0.002_-0.003. chandra observations obtained through a combined hrc-acisgto program reveal an x-ray spectrum with an fe k line redshifted by z = 1.18+/- 0.03. these redshifts are consistent with galaxy colors in extensiveoptical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared imaging. spt-cl j2106-5844 displaysextreme x-ray properties for a cluster, having a core-excluded temperature ofkt = 11.0^+2.6_-1.9 kev and a luminosity (within r_500) of l_x (0.5 - 2.0 kev)= (13.9 +/- 1.0) x 10^44 erg/s. the combined mass estimate from measurements ofthe sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and x-ray data is m_200 = (1.27 +/- 0.21) x 10^15m_sun. the discovery of such a massive gravitationally collapsed system at highredshift provides an interesting laboratory for galaxy formation and evolution,and is a powerful probe of extreme perturbations of the primordial matterdensity field. we discuss the latter, determining that, under the assumption oflambdacdm cosmology with only gaussian perturbations, there is only a 7% chanceof finding a galaxy cluster similar to spt-cl j2106-5844 in the 2500 deg^2 sptsurvey region, and that only one such galaxy cluster is expected in the entiresky.

1112.4215	frequency multiplexed squid readout of large bolometer arrays for cosmic  microwave background measurements	a technological milestone for experiments employing transition edge sensor(tes) bolometers operating at sub-kelvin temperature is the deployment ofdetector arrays with 100s--1000s of bolometers. one key technology for sucharrays is readout multiplexing: the ability to read out many sensorssimultaneously on the same set of wires. this paper describes afrequency-domain multiplexed readout system which has been developed for anddeployed on the apex-sz and south pole telescope millimeter wavelengthreceivers. in this system, the detector array is divided into modules of sevendetectors, and each bolometer within the module is biased with a unique ~mhzsinusoidal carrier such that the individual bolometer signals are wellseparated in frequency space. the currents from all bolometers in a module aresummed together and pre-amplified with superconducting quantum interferencedevices (squids) operating at 4 k. room-temperature electronics demodulate thecarriers to recover the bolometer signals, which are digitized separately andstored to disk. this readout system contributes little noise relative to thedetectors themselves, is remarkably insensitive to unwanted microphonicexcitations, and provides a technology pathway to multiplexing larger numbersof sensors.

1112.5435	cosmological constraints from sunyaev-zel'dovich-selected clusters with  x-ray observations in the first 178 square degrees of the south pole  telescope survey	we use measurements from the south pole telescope (spt) sunyaev zel'dovich(sz) cluster survey in combination with x-ray measurements to constraincosmological parameters. we present a statistical method that fits for thescaling relations of the sz and x-ray cluster observables with mass whilejointly fitting for cosmology. the method is generalizable to multiple clusterobservables, and self-consistently accounts for the effects of the clusterselection and uncertainties in cluster mass calibration on the derivedcosmological constraints. we apply this method to a data set consisting of ansz-selected catalog of 18 galaxy clusters at z &gt; 0.3 from the first 178 deg2 ofthe 2500 deg2 spt-sz survey, with 14 clusters having x-ray observations fromeither chandra or xmm. assuming a spatially flat lcdm cosmological model, wefind the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 (omega_m/0.25)^0.30 = 0.785 +-0.037. in combination with measurements of the cmb power spectrum from the sptand the seven-year wmap data, the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 = 0.795+- 0.016 and omega_m = 0.255 +- 0.016, a factor of 1.5 improvement on eachparameter over the cmb data alone. we consider several extensions beyond thelcdm model by including the following as free parameters: the dark energyequation of state (w), the sum of the neutrino masses (sum mnu), the effectivenumber of relativistic species (neff), and a primordial non-gaussianity (fnl).we find that adding the spt cluster data significantly improves the constraintson w and sum mnu beyond those found when using measurements of the cmb,supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the hubble constant. consideringeach extension independently, we best constrain w=-0.973 +- 0.063 and the sumof neutrino masses sum mnu &lt; 0.28 ev at 95% confidence, a factor of 1.25 and1.4 improvement, respectively, over the constraints without clusters.

1309.5381	inflation physics from the cosmic microwave background and large scale  structure	fluctuations in the intensity and polarization of the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) and the large-scale distribution of matter in the universeeach contain clues about the nature of the earliest moments of time. the nextgeneration of cmb and large-scale structure (lss) experiments are poised totest the leading paradigm for these earliest moments---the theory of cosmicinflation---and to detect the imprints of the inflationary epoch, therebydramatically increasing our understanding of fundamental physics and the earlyuniverse.  a future cmb experiment with sufficient angular resolution and frequencycoverage that surveys at least 1% of the sky to a depth of 1 uk-arcmin candeliver a constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio that will either result in a5-sigma measurement of the energy scale of inflation or rule out alllarge-field inflation models, even in the presence of foregrounds and thegravitational lensing b-mode signal. lss experiments, particularlyspectroscopic surveys such as the dark energy spectroscopic instrument, willcomplement the cmb effort by improving current constraints on running of thespectral index by up to a factor of four, improving constraints on curvature bya factor of ten, and providing non-gaussianity constraints that are competitivewith the current cmb bounds.

1404.6250	the redshift evolution of the mean temperature, pressure, and entropy  profiles in 80 spt-selected galaxy clusters	(abridged) we present the results of an x-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clustersselected in the 2500 deg^2 south pole telescope survey and observed with thechandra x-ray observatory. we divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20clusters based on redshift and central density, performing an x-ray fit to allclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of thetemperature profile. this approach allows us to constrain the shape of thetemperature profile over 0&lt;r&lt;1.5r500, which would be impossible on aper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, onaverage, 2000 x-ray counts. the results presented here represent the firstconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 toz=1.2. we find that high-z (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler bothin the inner (r&lt;0.1r500) and outer (r&gt;r500) regions than their low-z(0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6) counterparts. combining the average temperature profile withmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the averagepressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. overall, our observedpressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of thecore. we find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile atr&lt;0.7r500. we observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r&gt;r500 inour high-z subsample. this flattening is consistent with a temperature bias dueto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 kev) halos, which would goundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. thiswork demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved clusterproperties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but thenumber of observed clusters is high.

0807.4208	sunyaev-zel'dovich effect observations of the bullet cluster (1e  0657-56) with apex-sz	we present observations of the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) in the bulletcluster (1e 0657--56) using the apex-sz instrument at 150 ghz with a resolutionof 1 arcmin. the main results are maps of the sze in this massive, merginggalaxy cluster. the cluster is detected with 23 sigma significance within thecentral 1 arcmin radius of the source position. the sze map has a broadlysimilar morphology to that in existing x-ray maps of this system, and we findno evidence for significant contamination of the sze emission by radio or irsources. in order to make simple quantitative comparisons with cluster gasmodels derived from x-ray observations, we fit our data to an isothermalelliptical beta model, despite the inadequacy of such a model for this complexmerging system. with an x-ray derived prior on the power-law index, beta = 1.04+0.16 -0.10, we find a core radius r_c =142 +/- 18 arcsec, an axial ratio of0.889 +/- 0.072, and a central temperature decrement of -771 +/- 71micro-k_cmb, including a +/-5.5% flux calibration uncertainty. combining theapex-sz map with a map of projected electron surface density from chandra x-rayobservations, we determine the mass-weighted temperature of the cluster gas tobe t_mg=10.8 +/- 0.9 kev, significantly lower than some previously reportedx-ray spectroscopic temperatures. under the assumption of an isothermal clustergas distribution in hydrostatic equilibrium, we compute the gas mass fractionfor prolate and oblate spheroidal geometries and find it to be consistent withprevious results from x-ray and weak lensing observations. this work is thefirst result from the apex-sz experiment, and represents the first reportedscientific result from observations with a large array of multiplexedsuperconducting transition-edge sensor bolometers.

astro-ph;0104489	dasi first results: a measurement of the cosmic microwave background  angular power spectrum	we present measurements of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background(cmb) from the first season of observations with the degree angular scaleinterferometer (dasi). the instrument was deployed at the south pole in theaustral summer 1999--2000, and made observations throughout the followingaustral winter. we have measured the angular power spectrum of the cmb in therange 100&lt;l&lt;900 with high signal-to-noise. in this paper we review theformalism used in the analysis, in particular the use of constraint matrices toproject out contaminants such as ground and point source signals, and to testfor correlations with diffuse foreground templates. we find no evidence offoregrounds other than point sources in the data, and find a maximum likelihoodtemperature spectral index beta = -0.1 +/- 0.2 (1 sigma), consistent with cmb.we detect a first peak in the power spectrum at l approx 200, in agreement withprevious experiments. in addition, we detect a peak in the power spectrum at lapprox 550 and power of similar magnitude at l approx 800 which are consistentwith the second and third harmonic peaks predicted by adiabatic inflationarycosmological models.

astro-ph;0205384	the anisotropy of the microwave background to l = 3500: deep field  observations with the cosmic background imager	we report measurements of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave backgroundradiation over the multipole range l ~ 200 - 3500 with the cosmic backgroundimager based on deep observations of three fields. these results confirm thedrop in power with increasing l first reported in earlier measurements withthis instrument, and extend the observations of this decline in power out to l\~ 2000. the decline in power is consistent with the predicted damping ofprimary anisotropies. at larger multipoles, l = 2000 - 3500, the power is 3.1sigma greater than standard models for intrinsic microwave backgroundanisotropy in this multipole range, and 3.5 sigma greater than zero. thisexcess power is not consistent with expected levels of residual radio sourcecontamination but, for sigma_8 &gt;~ 1, is consistent with predicted levels due toa secondary sunyaev-zeldovich anisotropy. further observations are necessary toconfirm the level of this excess and, if confirmed, determine its origin.

astro-ph;0205388	the anisotropy of the microwave background to l = 3500: mosaic  observations with the cosmic background imager	using the cosmic background imager, a 13-element interferometer arrayoperating in the 26-36 ghz frequency band, we have observed 40 sq deg of sky inthree pairs of fields, each ~ 145 x 165 arcmin, using overlapping pointings(mosaicing). we present images and power spectra of the cosmic microwavebackground radiation in these mosaic fields. we remove ground radiation andother low-level contaminating signals by differencing matched observations ofthe fields in each pair. the primary foreground contamination is due to pointsources (radio galaxies and quasars). we have subtracted the strongest sourcesfrom the data using higher-resolution measurements, and we have projected outthe response to other sources of known position in the power-spectrum analysis.the images show features on scales ~ 6 - 15 arcmin, corresponding to masses ~(5 - 80)*10^{14} msun at the surface of last scattering, which are likely to bethe seeds of clusters of galaxies. the power spectrum estimates have aresolution delta-l = 200 and are consistent with earlier results in themultipole range l &lt;~ 1000. the power spectrum is detected with highsignal-to-noise ratio in the range 300 &lt;~ l &lt;~ 1700. for 1700 &lt;~ l &lt;~ 3000 theobservations are consistent with the results from more sensitive cbi deep-fieldobservations. the results agree with the extrapolation of cosmological modelsfitted to observations at lower l, and show the predicted drop at high l (the"damping tail").

astro-ph;0209478	detection of polarization in the cosmic microwave background using dasi	we report the detection of polarized anisotropy in the cosmic microwavebackground radiation with the degree angular scale interferometer (dasi),located at the amundsen-scott south pole research station. observations in allfour stokes parameters were obtained within two 3.4 fwhm fields separated byone hour in right ascension. the fields were selected from the subset of fieldsobserved with dasi in 2000 in which no point sources were detected and arelocated in regions of low galactic synchrotron and dust emission. thetemperature angular power spectrum is consistent with previous measurements andits measured frequency spectral index is -0.01 (-0.16 -- 0.14 at 68%confidence), where 0 corresponds to a 2.73 k planck spectrum. the powerspectrum of the detected polarization is consistent with theoreticalpredictions based on the interpretation of cmb anisotropy as arising fromprimordial scalar adiabatic fluctuations. specifically, e-mode polarization isdetected at high confidence (4.9 sigma). assuming a shape for the powerspectrum consistent with previous temperature measurements, the level found forthe e-mode polarization is 0.80 (0.56 -- 1.10), where the predicted level givenprevious temperature data is 0.9 -- 1.1. at 95% confidence, an upper limit of0.59 is set to the level of b-mode polarization with the same shape andnormalization as the e-mode spectrum. the te correlation of the temperature ande-mode polarization is detected at 95% confidence, and also found to beconsistent with predictions. these results provide strong validation of theunderlying theoretical framework for the origin of cmb anisotropy and lendconfidence to the values of the cosmological parameters that have been derivedfrom cmb measurements.

astro-ph;0411122	the south pole telescope	a new 10 meter diameter telescope is being constructed for deployment at thensf south pole research station. the telescope is designed for conductinglarge-area millimeter and sub-millimeter wave surveys of faint, low contrastemission, as required to map primary and secondary anisotropies in the cosmicmicrowave background. to achieve the required sensitivity and resolution, thetelescope design employs an off-axis primary with a 10m diameter clearaperture. the full aperture and the associated optics will have a combinedsurface accuracy of better than 20 microns rms to allow precision operation inthe submillimeter atmospheric windows. the telescope will be surrounded with alarge reflecting ground screen to reduce sensitivity to thermal emission fromthe ground and local interference. the optics of the telescope will support asquare degree field of view at 2mm wavelength and will feed a new 1000-elementmicro-lithographed planar bolometric array with superconducting transition-edgesensors and frequency-multiplexed readouts. the first key project will be toconduct a survey over approximately 4000 degrees for galaxy clusters using thesunyaev-zel'dovich effect. this survey should find many thousands of clusterswith a mass selection criteria that is remarkably uniform with redshift. armedwith redshifts obtained from optical and infrared follow-up observations, it isexpected that the survey will enable significant constraints to be placed onthe equation of state of the dark energy.

0810.1578	galaxy clusters discovered with a sunyaev-zel'dovich effect survey	the south pole telescope (spt) is conducting a sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effectsurvey over large areas of the southern sky, searching for massive galaxyclusters to high redshift. in this preliminary study, we focus on a 40square-degree area targeted by the blanco cosmology survey (bcs), which iscentered roughly at right ascension 5h30m, declination -53 degrees. over twoseasons of observations, this entire region has been mapped by the spt at 95ghz, 150 ghz, and 225 ghz. we report the four most significant spt detectionsof sz clusters in this field, three of which were previously unknown and,therefore, represent the first galaxy clusters discovered with an sz survey.the sz clusters are detected as decrements with greater than 5-sigmasignificance in the high-sensitivity 150 ghz spt map. the sz spectrum of thesesources is confirmed by detections of decrements at the corresponding locationsin the 95 ghz spt map and non-detections at those locations in the 225 ghz sptmap. multiband optical images from the bcs survey demonstrate significantconcentrations of similarly colored galaxies at the positions of the szdetections. photometric redshift estimates from the bcs data indicate that twoof the clusters lie at moderate redshift (z ~ 0.4) and two at high redshift (z&gt;~ 0.8). one of the sz detections was previously identified as a galaxy clusterusing x-ray data from the rosat all-sky survey (rass). potential rasscounterparts (not previously identified as clusters) are also found for two ofthe new discoveries. these first four galaxy clusters are the most significantsz detections from a subset of the ongoing spt survey. as such, they serve as ademonstration that sz surveys, and the spt in particular, can be an effectivemeans for finding galaxy clusters.
