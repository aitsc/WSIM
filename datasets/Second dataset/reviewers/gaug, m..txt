0907.0738	search for dark matter signatures with magic-i and prospects for magic  phase-ii	in many dark matter (dm) scenarios, the annihilation of dm particles canproduce gamma rays with a continuum spectrum that extends up to very highenergies of the order of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale (hundreds ofgev). astrophysical structures supposed to be dynamically dominated by dm, suchas dwarf spheroidal galaxies, galaxy clusters (the largest ones in the localuniverse being mostly observable from the northern hemisphere) and intermediatemass black holes, can be considered as interesting targets to look for dmannihilation with imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes (iacts). instead,the center of our galaxy seems to be strongly contaminated with astrophysicalsources. the 17m major atmospheric gamma-ray imaging cherenkov (magic-i)telescope, situated in the canary island of la palma (2200 m a.s.l.), is bestsuited for dm searches, due to its unique combination of high sensitivity andlow energy threshold among current iacts which can potentially allow to provideclues on the high energy end, and possibly peak, of the gamma-ray dm-inducedspectrum constrained at lower energies with the fermi space telescope. therecent results achieved by magic-i for some of the best candidates, as well asthe dm detection prospects for the magic phase ii, are reported.

0909.3267	magic gamma-ray telescope observation of the perseus cluster of  galaxies: implications for cosmic rays, dark matter, and ngc1275	the perseus galaxy cluster was observed by the magic cherenkov telescope fora total effective time of 24.4 hr during 2008 november and december. theresulting upper limits on the gamma-ray emission above 100 gev are in the rangeof 4.6 to 7.5 x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} for spectral indices from -1.5 to -2.5,thereby constraining the emission produced by cosmic rays, dark matterannihilations, and the central radio galaxy ngc1275. results are compatiblewith cosmological cluster simulations for the cosmic-ray-induced gamma-rayemission, constraining the average cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure to &lt;4% forthe cluster core region (&lt;8% for the entire cluster). using simplifiedassumptions adopted in earlier work (a power-law spectrum with an index of-2.1, constant cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure for the peripheral clusterregions while accounting for the adiabatic contraction during the cooling flowformation), we would limit the ratio of cosmic ray-to-thermal energy toe_cr/e_th&lt;3%. the upper limit also translates into a level of gamma-rayemission from possible annihilations of the cluster dark matter (the dominantmass component) that is consistent with boost factors of ~10^4 for thetypically expected dark matter annihilation-induced emission. finally, theupper limits obtained for the gamma-ray emission of the central radio galaxyngc1275 are consistent with the recent detection by the fermi-lat satellite.due to the extremely large doppler factors required for the jet, a one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model is implausible in this case. we reproduce theobserved spectral energy density by using the structured jet (spine-layer)model which has previously been adopted to explain the high-energy emission ofradio galaxies.

0910.4381	correlated x-ray and very high energy emission in the gamma-ray binary  ls i +61 303	the discovery of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emitting x-ray binaries hastriggered an intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration,absorption, and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems, which providevariable conditions along eccentric orbits. despite this, the nature of some ofthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the vhe emission, isunclear. to answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelengthcampaign of the vhe gamma-ray emitting x-ray binary ls i +61 303 including themagic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007september. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and vhe bands, with thepeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linear fit to thesimultaneous x-ray/vhe pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlationcoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs providesr=0.81. since a variable absorption of the vhe emission towards the observer isnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates asimultaneity in the emission processes. assuming that they are dominated by asingle particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the x-ray/vhe fluxratio favors leptonic models. this fact, together with the detected photonindices, suggests that in ls i +61 303 the x-rays are the result of synchrotronradiation of the same electrons that produce vhe emission as a result ofinverse compton scattering of stellar photons.

1004.1093	search for an extended vhe gamma-ray emission from mrk 421 and mrk 501  with the magic telescope	context: part of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray radiation coming fromextragalactic sources is absorbed through the pair production process on theextragalactic background light photons. extragalactic magnetic fields alter thetrajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic backgroundphotons to gamma-ray energies by inverse compton scattering. these secondaryphotons can form an extended halo around bright vhe sources.  aims: we searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars mrk 421and mrk 501 using the magic telescope data.  methods: if extended emission is present, the angular distribution ofreconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader thanfor a point-like source. in the analysis of a few tens of hours ofobservational data taken from mrk 421 and mrk 501 we used a newly developedmethod that provides better angular resolution. this method is based on theusage of multidimensional decision trees. comparing the measured shapes ofangular distributions with those expected from a point-like source one candetect or constrain possible extended emission around the source. we alsostudied the influence of different types of systematic errors on the shape ofthe distribution of reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions for a pointsource.  results: we present upper limits for an extended emission calculated for bothsources for various source extensions and emission profiles. we discusspossible constraints on the extragalactic magnetic fields strength. we obtainupper limits on the extended emission around the mrk~421 (mrk~501) on the levelof &lt; 5% (&lt; 4%) of the crab nebula flux above the energy threshold of 300 gev.using these results we discuss possible constraints on the extragalacticmagnetic fields strength around a few times $10^{-15}$~g.

1004.3665	magic observation of the grb080430 afterglow	context: gamma-ray bursts are cosmological sources emitting radiation fromthe gamma-rays to the radio band. substantial observational efforts have beendevoted to the study of gamma-ray bursts during the prompt phase, i.e. theinitial burst of high-energy radiation, and during the long-lasting afterglows.in spite of many successes in interpreting these phenomena, there are stillseveral open key questions about the fundamental emission processes, theirenergetics and the environment. aim: independently of specific gamma-ray bursttheoretical recipes, spectra in the gev/tev range are predicted to beremarkably simple, being satisfactorily modeled with power-laws, and thereforeoffer a very valuable tool to probe the extragalactic background lightdistribution. furthermore, the simple detection of a component at very-highenergies, i.e. at $\sim 100$\,gev, would solve the ambiguity about theimportance of various possible emission processes, which provide barelydistinguishable scenarios at lower energies. methods: we used the results ofthe magic telescope observation of the moderate resdhift ($z\sim0.76$)\object{grb\,080430} at energies above about 80\,gev, to evaluate theperspective for late-afterglow observations with ground based gev/tevtelescopes. results: we obtained an upper limit of $f_{\rm 95%\,cl} = 5.5\times 10^{-11}$\,erg\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$ for the very-high energy emission of\object{grb\,080430}, which cannot set further constraints on the theoreticalscenarios proposed for this object also due to the difficulties in modeling thelow-energy afterglow. nonetheless, our observations show that cherenkovtelescopes have already reached the required sensitivity to detect the gev/tevemission of grbs at moderate redshift ($z \lesssim 0.8$), provided theobservations are carried out at early times, close to the onset of theirafterglow phase.

1311.2833	magic observations and multifrequency properties of the flat spectrum  radio quasar 3c 279 in 2011	we study the multifrequency emission and spectral properties of the quasar 3c279. we observed 3c 279 in very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) gamma rays, withthe magic telescopes during 2011, for the first time in stereoscopic mode. wecombine these measurements with observations at other energy bands: in highenergy (he, e&gt;100mev) gamma rays from fermi-lat, in x-rays from rxte, in theoptical from the kva telescope and in the radio at 43ghz, 37ghz and 15ghz fromthe vlba, mets\"ahovi and ovro radio telescopes and optical polarisationmeasurements from the kva and liverpool telescopes. during the magicobservations (february to april 2011) 3c 279 was in a low state in optical,x-ray and gamma rays. the magic observations did not yield a significantdetection. these upper limits are in agreement with the extrapolation of the hegamma-ray spectrum, corrected for extragalactic background light absorption,from fermi-lat. the second part of the magic observations in 2011 was triggeredby a high activity state in the optical and gamma-ray bands. during the opticaloutburst the optical electric vector position angle rotatated of about 180degrees. there was no simultaneous rotation of the 43ghz radio polarisationangle. no vhe gamma rays were detected by magic, and the derived upper limitssuggest the presence of a spectral break or curvature between the fermi-lat andmagic bands. the combined upper limits are the strongest derived to date forthe source at vhe and below the level of the previously detected flux by afactor 2. radiation models that include synchrotron and inverse comptonemissions match the optical to gamma-ray data, assuming an emission componentinside the broad line region (blr) responsible for the high-energy emission andone outside the blr and the infrared torus causing optical and low-energyemission. we interpreted the optical polarisation with a bent trajectory model.

1311.3637	magic upper limits on the grb 090102 afterglow	indications of a gev component in the emission from grbs are known since theegret observations during the 1990's and they have been confirmed by the dataof the fermi satellite. these results have, however, shown that ourunderstanding of grb physics is still unsatisfactory. the new generation ofcherenkov observatories and in particular the magic telescope, allow for thefirst time the possibility to extend the measurement of grbs from several tensup to hundreds of gev energy range. both leptonic and hadronic processes havebeen suggested to explain the possible gev/tev counterpart of grbs.observations with ground-based telescopes of very high energy photons (e&gt;30gev) from these sources are going to play a key role in discriminating amongthe different proposed emission mechanisms, which are barely distinguishable atlower energies. magic telescope observations of the grb 090102 (z=1.547) fieldand fermi large area telescope (lat) data in the same time interval areanalysed to derive upper limits of the gev/tev emission. we compare theseresults to the expected emissions evaluated for different processes in theframework of a relativistic blast wave model for the afterglow. simultaneousupper limits with fermi and a cherenkov telescope have been derived for thisgrb observation. the results we obtained are compatible with the expectedemission although the difficulties in predicting the he and vhe emission forthe afterglow of this event makes it difficult to draw firmer conclusions.nonetheless, magic sensitivity in the energy range of overlap with space-basedinstruments (above about 40 gev) is about one order of magnitude better withrespect to fermi. this makes evident the constraining power of ground-basedobservations and shows that the magic telescope has reached the requiredperformance to make possible grb multiwavelength studies in the very highenergy range.

1312.1535	optimized dark matter searches in deep observations of segue 1 with  magic	we present the results of stereoscopic observations of the satellite galaxysegue 1 with the magic telescopes, carried out between 2011 and 2013. withalmost 160 hours of good-quality data, this is the deepest observationalcampaign on any dwarf galaxy performed so far in the very high energy range ofthe electromagnetic spectrum. we search this large data sample for signals ofdark matter particles in the mass range between 100 gev and 20 tev. for this weuse the full likelihood analysis method, which provides optimal sensitivity tocharacteristic gamma-ray spectral features, like those expected from darkmatter annihilation or decay. in particular, we focus our search on gamma-raysproduced from different final state standard model particles, annihilation withinternal bremsstrahlung, monochromatic lines and box-shaped signals. ourresults represent the most stringent constraints to the annihilationcross-section or decay lifetime obtained from observations of satellitegalaxies, for masses above few hundred gev. in particular, our strongest limit(95% confidence level) corresponds to a ~500 gev dark matter particleannihilating into tau+tau-, and is of order &lt;sigma v&gt; ~ 1.2x10^{-24} cm^3s^{-1} - a factor ~40 above the &lt;sigma v&gt; thermal value.

1401.0464	magic long-term study of the distant tev blazar pks 1424+240 in a  multiwavelength context	we present a study of the very high energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-rayemission of the blazar pks 1424+240 observed with the magic telescopes. theprimary aim of this paper is the multiwavelength spectral characterization andmodeling of this blazar, which is made particularly interesting by the recentdiscovery of a lower limit of its redshift of z &gt; 0.6 and makes it a promisingcandidate to be the most distant vhe source. the source has been observed withthe magic telescopes in vhe gamma rays for a total observation time of ~33.6 hfrom 2009 to 2011. the source was marginally detected in vhe gamma rays during2009 and 2010, and later, the detection was confirmed during an opticaloutburst in 2011. the combined significance of the stacked sample is ~7.2sigma. the differential spectra measured during the different campaigns can bedescribed by steep power laws with the indices ranging from 3.5 +/- 1.2 to 5.0+/- 1.7. the magic spectra corrected for the absorption due to theextragalactic background light connect smoothly, within systematic errors, withthe mean spectrum in 2009-2011 observed at lower energies by the fermi-lat. theabsorption-corrected magic spectrum is flat with no apparent turn down up to400 gev. the multiwavelength light curve shows increasing flux in radio andoptical bands that could point to a common origin from the same region of thejet. the large separation between the two peaks of the constructednon-simultaneous spectral energy distribution also requires an extremely highdoppler factor if an one zone synchrotron self-compton model is applied. wefind that a two-component synchrotron self-compton model describes the spectralenergy distribution of the source well, if the source is located at z~0.6.

1410.7059	discovery of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the blazar 1es  0033+595 by the magic telescopes	the number of known very high energy (vhe) blazars is $\sim\,50$, which isvery small in comparison to the number of blazars detected in otherfrequencies. this situation is a handicap for population studies of blazars,which emit about half of their luminosity in the $\gamma$-ray domain. moreover,vhe blazars, if distant, allow for the study of the environment that thehigh-energy $\gamma$-rays traverse in their path towards the earth, like theextragalactic background light (ebl) and the intergalactic magnetic field(igmf), and hence they have a special interest for the astrophysics community.we present the first vhe detection of 1es\,0033+595 with a statisticalsignificance of 5.5\,$\sigma$. the vhe emission of this object is constantthroughout the magic observations (2009 august and october), and can beparameterized with a power law with an integral flux above 150 gev of$(7.1\pm1.3)\times 10^{-12} {\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}}$ and a photon indexof ($3.8\pm0.7$). we model its spectral energy distribution (sed) as the resultof inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons. for the study of the sedwe used simultaneous optical r-band data from the kva telescope, archival x-raydata by \textit{swift} as well as \textit{integral}, and simultaneous highenergy (he, $300$\,mev~--~$10$\,gev) $\gamma$-ray data from the \textit{fermi}lat observatory. using the empirical approach of prandini et al. (2010) and the\textit{fermi}-lat and magic spectra for this object, we estimate the redshiftof this source to be $0.34\pm0.08\pm0.05$. this is a relevant result becausethis source is possibly one of the ten most distant vhe blazars known to date,and with further (simultaneous) observations could play an important role inblazar population studies, as well as future constraints on the ebl and igmf.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1503.05481	strategy implementation for the cta atmospheric monitoring program	the cherenkov telescope array (cta) is the next generation facility ofimaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes. it will reach unprecedentedsensitivity and energy resolution in very-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy. ctawill detect cherenkov light emitted within an atmospheric shower of particlesinitiated by cosmic-gamma rays or cosmic rays entering the earth's atmosphere.from the combination of images the cherenkov light produces in the telescopes,one is able to infer the primary particle energy and direction. a correctenergy estimation can be thus performed only if the local atmosphere is wellcharacterized. the atmosphere not only affects the shower development itself,but also the cherenkov photon transmission from the emission point in theparticle shower, at about 10-20 km above the ground, to the detector. cherenkovlight on the ground is peaked in the uv-blue region, and therefore molecularand aerosol extinction phenomena are important. the goal of cta is to controlsystematics in energy reconstruction to better than 10%. for this reason, acareful and continuous monitoring and characterization of the atmosphere isrequired. in addition, cta will be operated as an observatory, with data madepublic along with appropriate analysis tools. high-level data quality can onlybe ensured if the atmospheric properties are consistently and continuouslytaken into account. in this contribution, we concentrate on discussing theimplementation strategy for the various atmospheric monitoring instrumentscurrently under discussion in cta. these includes raman lidars and ceilometers,stellar photometers and others available both from commercial providers andpublic research centres.

1504.06115	magic detection of short-term variability of the high-peaked bl lac  object 1es 0806+524	the high-frequency-peaked bl lac (hbl) 1es 0806+524 (z = 0.138) wasdiscovered in vhe $\gamma$ rays in 2008. until now, the broad-band spectrum of1es 0806+524 has been only poorly characterized, in particular at highenergies. we analysed multiwavelength observations from $\gamma$ rays to radioperformed from 2011 january to march, which were triggered by the high activitydetected at optical frequencies. these observations constitute the most precisedetermination of the broad-band emission of 1es 0806+524 to date. thestereoscopic magic observations yielded a $\gamma$-ray signal above 250 gev of$(3.7 \pm 0.7)$ per cent of the crab nebula flux with a statisticalsignificance of 9.9 $\sigma$. the multiwavelength observations showedsignificant variability in essentially all energy bands, including a vhe$\gamma$-ray flare that lasted less than one night, which providedunprecedented evidence for short-term variability in 1es 0806+524. the spectrumof this flare is well described by a power law with a photon index of $2.97 \pm0.29$ between $\sim$150 gev and 1 tev and an integral flux of $(9.3 \pm 1.9)$per cent of the crab nebula flux above 250 gev. the spectrum during thenon-flaring vhe activity is compatible with the only available vhe observationperformed in 2008 with veritas when the source was in a low optical state. thebroad-band spectral energy distribution can be described with a one-zonesynchrotron self compton model with parameters typical for hbls, indicatingthat 1es 0806+524 is not substantially different from the hbls previouslydetected.

1508.06625	the camera calibration strategy of the cherenkov telescope array	the cherenkov telescope array (cta) will be the next generation ground basedobservatory in very high energy gamma ray astronomy. the facility will achievea wide energy coverage, starting from a threshold of a few tens of gev up tohundreds of tev by utilising several classes of telescopes, each optimised fordifferent regions of the gamma-ray spectrum. the required energy resolution ofbetter than 10-15% over most of the energy range and a goal of 5% systematicuncertainty on the measurement of the cherenkov light intensity at the positionof each telescope means that a very precise evaluation of the entire systemwill need to be made. the composite nature of the array means multiple cameratechnologies will be employed so multiple calibration systems and procedureswill be necessary to meet the performance requirements. additional constraintswill come from the need to minimise observing time losses and that theobservatory is foreseen to operate for tens of years, so both short and longterm systematic changes in performance will need to be investigated andmonitored. this contribution summarises the recommended camera calibrationstrategy of cta based on the experience with current iacts.

1509.04936	first nustar observations of mrk 501 within a radio to tev  multi-instrument campaign	we report on simultaneous broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazarmarkarian 501 between 1 april and 10 august 2013, including the first detailedcharacterization of the synchrotron peak with swift and nustar. during thecampaign, the nearby bl lac object was observed in both a quiescent and anelevated state. the broadband campaign includes observations with nustar,magic, veritas, the fermi large area telescope (lat), swift x-ray telescope anduv optical telescope, various ground-based optical instruments, including thegasp-webt program, as well as radio observations by ovro, mets\"ahovi and thef-gamma consortium. some of the magic observations were affected by a sandlayer from the saharan desert, and had to be corrected using event-by-eventcorrections derived with a lidar (light detection and ranging) facility. thisis the first time that lidar information is used to produce a physics resultwith cherenkov telescope data taken during adverse atmospheric conditions, andhence sets a precedent for the current and future ground-based gamma-rayinstruments. the nustar instrument provides unprecedented sensitivity in hardx-rays, showing the source to display a spectral energy distribution between 3and 79 kev consistent with a log-parabolic spectrum and hard x-ray variabilityon hour timescales. none (of the four extended nustar observations) showsevidence of the onset of inverse-compton emission at hard x-ray energies. weapply a single-zone equilibrium synchrotron self-compton model to fivesimultaneous broadband spectral energy distributions. we find that thesynchrotron self-compton model can reproduce the observed broadband statesthrough a decrease in the magnetic field strength coinciding with an increasein the luminosity and hardness of the relativistic leptons responsible for thehigh-energy emission.

1510.07048	teraelectronvolt pulsed emission from the crab pulsar detected by magic	aims: to investigate the extension of the very-high-energy spectral tail ofthe crab pulsar at energies above 400 gev. methods: we analyzed $\sim$320 hoursof good quality data of crab with the magic telescope, obtained from february2007 until april 2014. results: we report the most energetic pulsed emissionever detected from the crab pulsar reaching up to 1.5 tev. the pulse profileshows two narrow peaks synchronized with the ones measured in the gev energyrange. the spectra of the two peaks follow two different power-law functionsfrom 70 gev up to 1.5 tev and connect smoothly with the spectra measured above10 gev by the large area telescope (lat) on board of the fermi satellite. whenmaking a joint fit of the lat and magic data, above 10 gev, the photon indicesof the spectra differ by 0.5$\pm$0.1. conclusions: we measured with the magictelescopes the most energetic pulsed photons from a pulsar to date. such tevpulsed photons require a parent population of electrons with a lorentz factorof at least $5\times 10^6$. these results strongly suggest ic scattering offlow energy photons as the emission mechanism and a gamma-ray production regionin the vicinity of the light cylinder.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.
