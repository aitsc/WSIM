0902.2213	the macho project hst follow-up: the large magellanic cloud microlensing  source stars	we present hubble space telescope (hst) wfpc2 photometry of 13 microlensedsource stars from the 5.7 year large magellanic cloud (lmc) survey conducted bythe macho project. the microlensing source stars are identified by derivingaccurate centroids in the ground-based macho images using difference imageanalysis (dia) and then transforming the dia coordinates to the hst frame. noneof these sources is coincident with a background galaxy, which rules out thepossibility that the macho lmc microlensing sample is contaminated withmisidentified supernovae or agn in galaxies behind the lmc. this supports theconclusion that the macho lmc microlensing sample has only a small amount ofcontamination due to non-microlensing forms of variability. we compare thewfpc2 source star magnitudes with the lensed flux predictions derived frommicrolensing fits to the light curve data. in most cases the source starbrightness is accurately predicted. finally, we develop a statistic whichconstrains the location of the large magellanic cloud (lmc) microlensing sourcestars with respect to the distributions of stars and dust in the lmc andcompare this to the predictions of various models of lmc microlensing. thistest excludes at &gt; 90% confidence level models where more than 80% of thesource stars lie behind the lmc. exotic models that attempt to explain theexcess lmc microlensing optical depth seen by macho with a population ofbackground sources are disfavored or excluded by this test. models in whichmost of the lenses reside in a halo or spheroid distribution associated witheither the milky way or the lmc are consistent which these data, but lmc haloor spheroid models are favored by the combined macho and eros microlensingresults.

1001.5427	sn 2009kf : a uv bright type iip supernova discovered with pan-starrs 1  and galex	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of a luminous type iipsupernova 2009kf discovered by the pan-starrs 1 (ps1) survey and detected alsoby galex. the sn shows a plateau in its optical and bolometric light curves,lasting approximately 70 days in the rest frame, with absolute magnitude of m_v= -18.4 mag. the p-cygni profiles of hydrogen indicate expansion velocities of9000km/s at 61 days after discovery which is extremely high for a type iip sn.sn 2009kf is also remarkably bright in the near-ultraviolet (nuv) and shows aslow evolution 10-20 days after optical discovery. the nuv and opticalluminosity at these epochs can be modelled with a black-body with a hoteffective temperature (t ~16,000 k) and a large radius (r ~1x10^{15} cm). thebright bolometric and nuv luminosity, the lightcurve peak and plateau duration,the high velocities and temperatures suggest that 2009kf is a type iip snpowered by a larger than normal explosion energy. recently discovered high-zsne (0.7 &lt; z &lt; 2.3) have been assumed to be iin sne, with the bright uvluminosities due to the interaction of sn ejecta with a dense circumstellarmedium (csm). uv bright sne similar to sn 2009kf could also account for thesehigh-z events, and its absolute magnitude m_nuv = -21.5 +/- 0.5 mag suggestssuch sne could be discovered out to z ~2.5 in the ps1 survey.

1003.0003	galaxy clusters selected with the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from 2008  south pole telescope observations	we present a detection-significance-limited catalog of 21 sunyaev-zel'dovichselected galaxy clusters. these clusters, along with 1 unconfirmed candidate,were identified in 178 deg^2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the south poletelescope to a depth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz. optical imaging from theblanco cosmology survey (bcs) and magellan telescopes provided photometric (andin some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts rangingfrom z=0.15 to z&gt;1, with a median z = 0.74. of the 21 confirmed galaxyclusters, three were previously identified as abell clusters, three werepresented as spt discoveries in staniszewski et al, 2009, and three were firstidentified in a recent analysis of bcs data by menanteau et al, 2010; theremaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. simulatedobservations of the spt fields predict the sample to be nearly 100% completeabove a mass threshold of m_200 ~ 5x10^14 m_sun/h at z = 0.6. this completenessthreshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to ~4x10^14m_sun/h at z=1. the size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in goodagreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxyclusters and cosmology. in combination with other cosmological probes, we usethe cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. assuming astandard spatially flat wcdm cosmological model, the addition of our catalog tothe wmap 7-year analysis yields sigma_8 = 0.81 +- 0.09 and w = -1.07 +- 0.29, a~50% improvement in precision on both parameters over wmap7 alone.

1008.2674	ultra-bright optical transients are linked with type ic supernovae	recent searches by unbiased, wide-field surveys have uncovered a group ofextremely luminous optical transients. the initial discoveries of sn 2005ap bythe texas supernova search and scp-06f6 in a deep hubble pencil beam surveywere followed by the palomar transient factory confirmation of host redshiftsfor other similar transients. the transients share the common properties ofhigh optical luminosities (peak magnitudes ~ -21 to -23), blue colors, and alack of h or he spectral features. the physical mechanism that produces theluminosity is uncertain, with suggestions ranging from jet-driven explosion topulsational pair-instability. here we report the most detailed photometric andspectral coverage of an ultra-bright transient (sn 2010gx) detected in thepan-starrs 1 sky survey. in common with other transients in this family,early-time spectra show a blue continuum, and prominent broad absorption linesof o ii. however, about 25d after discovery, the spectra developed type icsupernova features, showing the characteristic broad fe ii and si ii absorptionlines. detailed, post-maximum follow-up may show that all sn 2005ap andscp-06f6 type transients are linked to supernovae ic. this poses problems inunderstanding the physics of the explosions: there is no indication fromlate-time photometry that the luminosity is powered by 56ni, the broadlightcurves suggest very large ejected masses, and the slow spectral evolutionis quite different from typical ic timescales. the nature of the progenitorstars and the origin of the luminosity are intriguing and open questions.

1009.5720	laser ranging to the lost lunokhod~1 reflector	in 1970, the soviet lunokhod 1 rover delivered a french-built laser reflectorto the moon. although a few range measurements were made within three months ofits landing, these measurements---and any that may have followed---areunpublished and unavailable. the lunokhod 1 reflector was, therefore,effectively lost until march of 2010 when images from the lunar reconnaissanceorbiter (lro) provided a positive identification of the rover and determinedits coordinates with uncertainties of about 100 m. this allowed the apachepoint observatory lunar laser-ranging operation (apollo) to quickly acquire alaser signal. the reflector appears to be in excellent condition, delivering asignal roughly four times stronger than its twin reflector on the lunokhod 2rover. the lunokhod 1 reflector is especially valuable for science because itis closer to the moon's limb than any of the other reflectors and, unlike thelunokhod 2 reflector, we find that it is usable during the lunar day. we reportthe selenographic position of the reflector to few-centimeter accuracy, commenton the health of the reflector, and illustrate the value of this reflector forachieving science goals.

1205.0252	an ultraviolet-optical flare from the tidal disruption of a helium-rich  stellar core	the flare of radiation from the tidal disruption and accretion of a star canbe used as a marker for supermassive black holes that otherwise lie dormant andundetected in the centres of distant galaxies. previous candidate flares havehad declining light curves in good agreement with expectations, but with poorconstraints on the time of disruption and the type of star disrupted, becausethe rising emission was not observed. recently, two `relativistic' candidatetidal disruption events were discovered, each of whose extreme x-ray luminosityand synchrotron radio emission were interpreted as the onset of emission from arelativistic jet. here we report the discovery of a luminousultraviolet-optical flare from the nuclear region of an inactive galaxy at aredshift of 0.1696. the observed continuum is cooler than expected for a simpleaccreting debris disk, but the well-sampled rise and decline of its light curvefollows the predicted mass accretion rate, and can be modelled to determine thetime of disruption to an accuracy of two days. the black hole has a mass ofabout 2 million solar masses, modulo a factor dependent on the mass and radiusof the star disrupted. on the basis of the spectroscopic signature of ionizedhelium from the unbound debris, we determine that the disrupted star was ahelium-rich stellar core.

1205.3103	weak-lensing mass measurements of five galaxy clusters in the south pole  telescope survey using magellan/megacam	we use weak gravitational lensing to measure the masses of five galaxyclusters selected from the south pole telescope (spt) survey, with the primarygoal of comparing these with the spt sunyaev--zel'dovich (sz) and x-ray basedmass estimates. the clusters span redshifts 0.28 &lt; z &lt; 0.43 and have massesm_500 &gt; 2 x 10^14 h^-1 m_sun, and three of the five clusters were discovered bythe spt survey. we observed the clusters in the g'r'i' passbands with themegacam imager on the magellan clay 6.5m telescope. we measure a mean ratio ofweak lensing (wl) aperture masses to inferred aperture masses from the sz data,both within an aperture of r_500,sz derived from the sz mass, of 1.04 +/- 0.18.we measure a mean ratio of spherical wl masses evaluated at r_500,sz tospherical sz masses of 1.07 +/- 0.18, and a mean ratio of spherical wl massesevaluated at r_500,wl to spherical sz masses of 1.10 +/- 0.24. we explorepotential sources of systematic error in the mass comparisons and conclude thatall are subdominant to the statistical uncertainty, with dominant terms beingcluster concentration uncertainty and n-body simulation calibration bias.expanding the sample of spt clusters with wl observations has the potential tosignificantly improve the spt cluster mass calibration and the resultingcosmological constraints from the spt cluster survey. these are the first wldetections using megacam on the magellan clay telescope.

1207.4369	redshifts, sample purity, and bcg positions for the galaxy cluster  catalog from the first 720 square degrees of the south pole telescope survey	we present the results of the ground- and space-based optical andnear-infrared (nir) follow-up of 224 galaxy cluster candidates detected withthe sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect in the 720 deg^2 of the south pole telescope(spt) survey completed in the 2008 and 2009 observing seasons. we use theoptical/nir data to establish whether each candidate is associated with anoverdensity of galaxies and to estimate the cluster redshift. most photometricredshifts are derived through a combination of three different cluster redshiftestimators using red-sequence galaxies, resulting in an accuracy of \deltaz/(1+z)=0.017, determined through comparison with a subsample of 57 clustersfor which we have spectroscopic redshifts. we successfully measure redshiftsfor 158 systems and present redshift lower limits for the remaining candidates.the redshift distribution of the confirmed clusters extends to z=1.35 with amedian of z_{med}=0.57. approximately 18% of the sample with measured redshiftslies at z&gt;0.8. we estimate a lower limit to the purity of this spt sz-selectedsample by assuming that all unconfirmed clusters are noise fluctuations in thespt data. we show that the cumulative purity at detection significance \xi&gt;5(\xi&gt;4.5) is &gt;= 95 (&gt;= 70%). we present the red brightest cluster galaxy (rbcg)positions for the sample and examine the offsets between the spt candidateposition and the rbcg. the radial distribution of offsets is similar to thatseen in x-ray-selected cluster samples, providing no evidence that sz-selectedcluster samples include a different fraction of recent mergers thanx-ray-selected cluster samples.

1208.2962	a massive, cooling-flow-induced starburst in the core of a highly  luminous galaxy cluster	in the cores of some galaxy clusters the hot intracluster plasma is denseenough that it should cool radiatively in the cluster's lifetime, leading tocontinuous "cooling flows" of gas sinking towards the cluster center, yet nosuch cooling flow has been observed. the low observed star formation rates andcool gas masses for these "cool core" clusters suggest that much of the coolingmust be offset by astrophysical feedback to prevent the formation of a runawaycooling flow. here we report x-ray, optical, and infrared observations of thegalaxy cluster spt-clj2344-4243 at z = 0.596. these observations reveal anexceptionally luminous (l_2-10 kev = 8.2 x 10^45 erg/s) galaxy cluster whichhosts an extremely strong cooling flow (dm/dt = 3820 +/- 530 msun/yr). further,the central galaxy in this cluster appears to be experiencing a massivestarburst (740 +/- 160 msun/yr), which suggests that the feedback sourceresponsible for preventing runaway cooling in nearby cool core clusters may notyet be fully established in spt-clj2344-4243. this large star formation rateimplies that a significant fraction of the stars in the central galaxy of thiscluster may form via accretion of the intracluster medium, rather than thecurrent picture of central galaxies assembling entirely via mergers.

1302.0009	ps1-10afx at z=1.388: pan-starrs1 discovery of a new type of  superluminous supernova	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of ps1-10afx, a uniquehydrogen-deficient superluminous supernova (slsn) at z=1.388. the light curvepeaked at z_p1=21.7 mag, making ps1-10afx comparable to the most luminous knownsne, with m_u = -22.3 mag. our extensive optical and nir observations indicatethat the bolometric light curve of ps1-10afx rose on the unusually fasttimescale of ~12 d to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1e44 erg/s (m_bol= -22.8 mag) and subsequently faded rapidly. equally important, the sed isunusually red for a slsn, with a color temperature of 6800 k near maximumlight, in contrast to previous h-poor slsne, which are bright in the uv. thespectra more closely resemble those of a normal sn ic than any known slsn, witha photospheric velocity of 11,000 km/s and evidence for line blanketing in therest-frame uv. despite the fast rise, these parameters imply a very largeemitting radius (&gt;5e15 cm). we demonstrate that no existing theoretical modelcan satisfactorily explain this combination of properties: (i) a nickel-poweredlight curve cannot match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fasttimescale; (ii) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly-rotatingmagnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta; and (iii) modelsinvoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium cannot explain theobserved spectra or color evolution. the host galaxy is well detected inpre-explosion imaging with a luminosity near l*, a star formation rate of 15m_sun/yr, and is fairly massive (2e10 m_sun), with a stellar population age of1e8 yr, also in contrast to the dwarf hosts of known h-poor slsne. ps1-10afx isdistinct from known examples of slsne in its spectra, colors, light-curveshape, and host galaxy properties, suggesting that it resulted from a differentchannel than other hydrogen-poor slsne.

1307.5324	a search for fast optical transients in the pan-starrs1 medium-deep  survey: m dwarf flares, asteroids, limits on extragalactic rates, and  implications for lsst	[abridged] we present a search for fast optical transients (~0.5 hr-1 day)using repeated observations of the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey (ps1/mds)fields. our search takes advantage of the consecutive g/r-band observations(16.5 min in each filter), by requiring detections in both bands, withnon-detections on preceding and subsequent nights. we identify 19 transientsbrighter than 22.5 ab mag (s/n&gt;10). of these, 11 events exhibit quiescentcounterparts in the deep ps1/mds templates that we identify as m4-m9 dwarfs.the remaining 8 transients exhibit a range of properties indicative ofmain-belt asteroids near the stationary point of their orbits. withidentifications for all 19 transients, we place an upper limit ofr_fot(0.5hr)&lt;0.12 deg^-2 d^-1 (95% confidence level) on the sky-projected rateof extragalactic fast transients at &lt;22.5 mag, a factor of 30-50 times lowerthan previous limits; the limit for a timescale of ~day is r_fot&lt;2.4e-3 deg^-2d^-1. to convert these sky-projected rates to volumetric rates, we explore theexpected peak luminosities of fast optical transients powered by variousmechanisms, and find that non-relativistic events are limited to m~-10 mag(m~-14 mag) for a timescale of ~0.5 hr (~day), while relativistic sources(e.g., grbs, magnetar-powered transients) can reach much larger luminosities.the resulting volumetric rates are &lt;13 (m~-10 mag), &lt;0.05 (m~-14 mag) and &lt;1e-6mpc^-3 yr^-1 (m~-24 mag), significantly above the nova, supernova, and grbrates, respectively, indicating that much larger surveys are required toprovide meaningful constraints. motivated by the results of our search wediscuss strategies for identifying fast optical transients in the lsst mainsurvey, and reach the optimistic conclusion that the veil of foregroundcontaminants can be lifted with the survey data, without the need for expensivefollow-up observations.

1309.3009	the uv-bright, slowly declining transient ps1-11af as a partial tidal  disruption event	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of the long-lived and blue transientps1-11af, which was also detected by galex with coordinated observations in thenear-ultraviolet (nuv) band. ps1-11af is associated with the nucleus of anearly-type galaxy at redshift z=0.4046 that exhibits no evidence for starformation or agn activity. four epochs of spectroscopy reveal a pair oftransient broad absorption features in the uv on otherwise featureless spectra.despite the superficial similarity of these features to p-cygni absorptions ofsupernovae (sne), we conclude that ps1-11af is not consistent with theproperties of known types of sne. blackbody fits to the spectral energydistribution are inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a sn, andthe velocities of the absorption features are too high to represent material inhomologous expansion near a sn photosphere. however, the constant blue colorsand slow evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous optically-selectedtidal disruption events (tdes). the shape of the optical light curve isconsistent with models for tdes, but the minimum accreted mass necessary topower the observed luminosity is only ~0.002m_sun, which points to a partialdisruption model. a full disruption model predicts higher bolometricluminosities, which would require most of the radiation to be emitted in aseparate component at high energies where we lack observations. in addition,the observed temperature is lower than that predicted by pure accretion diskmodels for tdes and requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature.three deep non-detections in the radio with the vla over the first two yearsafter the event set strict limits on the production of any relativistic outflowcomparable to swift j1644+57, even if off-axis.

1309.7044	robust quantification of galaxy cluster morphology using asymmetry and  central concentration	we present a novel quantitative scheme of cluster classification based on themorphological properties that are manifested in x-ray images. we use aconventional radial surface brightness concentration parameter (c_{sb}) asdefined previously by others, and a new asymmetry parameter, which we define inthis paper. our asymmetry parameter, which we refer to as photon asymmetry($a_{phot}), was developed as a robust substructure statistic for clusterobservations with only a few thousand counts. to demonstrate that photonasymmetry exhibits better stability than currently popular power ratios andcentroid shifts, we artificially degrade the x-ray image quality by: (a) addingextra background counts, (b) eliminating a fraction of the counts, (c)increasing the width of the smoothing kernel, and (d) simulating clusterobservations at higher redshift. the asymmetry statistic presented here has asmaller statistical uncertainty than competing substructure parameters,allowing for low levels of substructure to be measured with confidence.a_{phot} is less sensitive to the total number of counts than competingsubstructure statistics, making it an ideal candidate for quantifyingsubstructure in samples of distant clusters covering wide range ofobservational s/n. additionally, we show that the asymmetry-concentrationclassification separates relaxed, cool core clusters frommorphologically-disturbed mergers, in agreement with by-eye classifications.our algorithms, freely available as python scripts(https://github.com/ndaniyar/aphot) are completely automatic and can be used torapidly classify galaxy cluster morphology for large numbers of clusterswithout human intervention.

1310.4446	slowly fading super-luminous supernovae that are not pair-instability  explosions	super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second attheir peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies atredshifts of 0.1-4. some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'supernovae. such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times thatof the sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. in thesestars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted toelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclearexplosions. many solar masses of 56ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to56fe via 56co, powering bright light curves. such massive progenitors areexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early universe. recently,supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years afterthe big bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the sun was observed to looklike a fading pair-instability supernova. here we report observations of twoslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times andblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. theirlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call thenature of that event into question. our early spectra closely resemble typicalfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered byradioactivity. modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses ofmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosionmechanism. the lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests thattheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of thecore-collapse rate.

1312.3015	measurement of galaxy cluster integrated comptonization and mass scaling  relations with the south pole telescope	we describe a method for measuring the integrated comptonization (ysz) ofclusters of galaxies from measurements of the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect inmultiple frequency bands and use this method to characterize a sample of galaxyclusters detected in south pole telescope (spt) data. we test this method onsimulated cluster observations and verify that it can accurately recovercluster parameters with negligible bias. in realistic simulations of anspt-like survey, with realizations of cosmic microwave background anisotropy,point sources, and atmosphere and instrumental noise at typical spt-sz surveylevels, we find that ysz is most accurately determined in an aperturecomparable to the spt beam size. we demonstrate the utility of this method tomeasure ysz and to constrain mass scaling relations using x-ray mass estimatesfor a sample of 18 galaxy clusters from the spt-sz survey. measuring ysz withina 0.75' radius aperture, we find an intrinsic log-normal scatter of 21+/-11% inysz at a fixed mass. measuring ysz within a 0.3 mpc projected radius(equivalent to 0.75' at the survey median redshift z = 0.6), we find a scatterof 26+/-9%. prior to this study, the spt observable found to have the lowestscatter with mass was cluster detection significance. we demonstrate, from bothsimulations and spt observed clusters, that ysz measured within an aperturecomparable to the spt beam size is equivalent, in terms of scatter with clustermass, to spt cluster detection significance.

1401.7424	characterization of the praesepe star cluster by photometry and proper  motions with 2mass, ppmxl, and pan-starrs	membership identification is the first step to determine the properties of astar cluster. low-mass members in particular could be used to trace thedynamical history, such as mass segregation, stellar evaporation, or tidalstripping, of a star cluster in its galactic environment. we identified membercandidates with stellar masses $\sim$0.11--2.4 msun of the intermediate-agepraesepe cluster (m44), by using pan-starrs and 2mass photometry, and ppmxlproper motions. within a sky area of 3 deg radius, 1040 candidates areidentified, of which 96 are new inclusions. using the same set of selectioncriteria on field stars led to an estimate of a false positive rate 16%,suggesting 872 of the candidates being true members. this most complete andreliable membership list allows us to favor the bt-settl model in comparisonwith other stellar models. the cluster shows a distinct binary track above themain sequence, with a binary frequency of 20--40%, and a high occurrence rateof similar mass pairs. the mass function is consistent with that of the diskpopulation but shows a deficit of members below 0.3 solar masses. a clear masssegregation is evidenced, with the lowest-mass members in our sample beingevaporated from this disintegrating cluster.

1402.1631	selecting superluminous supernovae in faint galaxies from the first year  of the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey	the pan-starrs1 (ps1) survey has obtained imaging in 5 bands (grizy_p1) over10 medium deep survey (mds) fields covering a total of 70 square degrees. thispaper describes the search for apparently hostless supernovae (sne) within thefirst year of ps1 mds data with an aim of discovering new superluminoussupernovae (slsne). a total of 249 hostless transients were discovered down toa limiting magnitude of m_ab ~ 23.5, of which 76 were classified as type iasne. there were 57 sne with complete light curves that are likely core-collapsesne (ccsne) or slsne and 12 of these have had spectra taken. of these 12hostless, non-type ia sne, 7 were slsne of type ic at redshifts between0.5-1.4. this illustrates that the discovery rate of type ic slsne can bemaximised by concentrating on hostless transients and removing normal sne ia.we present data for two new possible slsne; ps1-10pm (z = 1.206) and ps1-10ahf(z = 1.1), and estimate the rate of slsne-ic to be between 3^{+3}_{-2} *10^{-5} and 8^{+2}_{-1} * 10^{-5} of the ccsne rate within 0.3 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.4 byapplying a monte-carlo technique. the rate of slowly evolving, sn2007bi-likeexplosions is estimated as a factor of 10 lower than this range.

1404.6250	the redshift evolution of the mean temperature, pressure, and entropy  profiles in 80 spt-selected galaxy clusters	(abridged) we present the results of an x-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clustersselected in the 2500 deg^2 south pole telescope survey and observed with thechandra x-ray observatory. we divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20clusters based on redshift and central density, performing an x-ray fit to allclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of thetemperature profile. this approach allows us to constrain the shape of thetemperature profile over 0&lt;r&lt;1.5r500, which would be impossible on aper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, onaverage, 2000 x-ray counts. the results presented here represent the firstconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 toz=1.2. we find that high-z (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler bothin the inner (r&lt;0.1r500) and outer (r&gt;r500) regions than their low-z(0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6) counterparts. combining the average temperature profile withmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the averagepressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. overall, our observedpressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of thecore. we find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile atr&lt;0.7r500. we observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r&gt;r500 inour high-z subsample. this flattening is consistent with a temperature bias dueto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 kev) halos, which would goundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. thiswork demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved clusterproperties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but thenumber of observed clusters is high.

1409.0850	galaxy clusters discovered via the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect in the  2500-square-degree spt-sz survey	we present a catalog of galaxy clusters selected via their sunyaev-zel'dovich(sz) effect signature from 2500 deg$^2$ of south pole telescope (spt) data.this work represents the complete sample of clusters detected at highsignificance in the 2500-square-degree spt-sz survey, which was completed in2011. a total of 677 (409) cluster candidates are identified above asignal-to-noise threshold of $\xi$ =4.5 (5.0). ground- and space-based opticaland near-infrared (nir) imaging confirms overdensities of similarly coloredgalaxies in the direction of 516 (or 76%) of the $\xi$&gt;4.5 candidates and 387(or 95%) of the $\xi$&gt;5 candidates; the measured purity is consistent withexpectations from simulations. of these confirmed clusters, 415 were firstidentified in spt data, including 251 new discoveries reported in this work. weestimate photometric redshifts for all candidates with identified opticaland/or nir counterparts; we additionally report redshifts derived fromspectroscopic observations for 141 of these systems. the mass threshold of thecatalog is roughly independent of redshift above $z$~0.25 leading to a sampleof massive clusters that extends to high redshift. the median mass of thesample is $m_{\scriptsize 500c}(\rho_\mathrm{crit})$ ~ 3.5 x 10$^{14} m_\odoth^{-1}$, the median redshift is $z_{med}$ =0.55, and the highest-redshiftsystems are at $z$&gt;1.4. the combination of large redshift extent, cleanselection, and high typical mass makes this cluster sample of particularinterest for cosmological analyses and studies of cluster formation andevolution.

1508.05361	supercal: cross-calibration of multiple photometric systems to improve  cosmological measurements with type ia supernovae	current cosmological analyses which use type ia supernova (sn ia)observations combine sn samples to expand the redshift range beyond that of asingle sample and increase the overall sample size. the inhomogeneousphotometric calibration between different sn samples is one of the largestsystematic uncertainties of the cosmological parameter estimation. to placethese different samples on a single system, analyses currently use observationsof a small sample of very bright flux standards on the $hst$ system. we proposea complementary method, called `supercal', in which we use measurements ofsecondary standards in each system, compare these to measurements of the samestars in the pan-starrs1 (ps1) system, and determine offsets for each systemrelative to ps1, placing all sn observations on a single, consistentphotometric system. ps1 has observed $3\pi$ of the sky and has a relativecalibration of better than 5 mmag (for $\sim15&lt;griz&lt;21$ mag), making it anideal reference system. we use this process to recalibrate optical observationstaken by the following sn samples: ps1, snls, sdss, csp, and cfa1-4. we measurediscrepancies on average of 10 mmag, but up to 35 mmag, in various opticalpassbands. we find that correcting for these differences changes recoveredvalues for the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w$, by on average$2.6\%$. this change is roughly half the size of current statisticalconstraints on $w$. the size of this effect strongly depends on the error inthe $b-v$ calibration of the low-$z$ surveys. the supercal method will allowfuture analyses to tie past samples to the best calibrated sample.

astro-ph;0001272	the macho project: microlensing results from 5.7 years of lmc  observations	we report on our search for microlensing towards the large magellanic cloud(lmc). analysis of 5.7 years of photometry on 11.9 million stars in the lmcreveals 13 - 17 microlensing events. this is significantly more than the $\sim$2 to 4 events expected from lensing by known stellar populations. thetimescales ($\that$) of the events range from 34 to 230 days. we estimate themicrolensing optical depth towards the lmc from events with $2 &lt; \that &lt; 400$days to be 1.2 ^{+0.4}_ {-0.3} \ten{-7}$, with an additional 20% to 30% ofsystematic error. the spatial distribution of events is mildly inconsistentwith lmc/lmc disk self-lensing, but is consistent with an extended lensdistribution such as a milky way or lmc halo. interpreted in the context of agalactic dark matter halo, consisting partially of compact objects, a maximumlikelihood analysis gives a macho halo fraction of 20% for a typical halo modelwith a 95% confidence interval of 8% to 50%. a 100% macho halo is ruled out atthe 95% c.l. for all except our most extreme halo model. interpreted as agalactic halo population, the most likely macho mass is between $ 0.15 \msun$and $ 0.9 \msun$, depending on the halo model, and the total mass in machos outto 50 kpc is found to be 9+4-3 10^{10} msun, independent of the halo model.these results are marginally consistent with our previous results, but arelower by about a factor of two. besides a larger data set, this work alsoincludes an improved efficiency determination, improved likelihood analysis,and more thorough testing of systematic errors, especially with respect to thetreatment of potential backgrounds to microlensing, such as supernovae ingalaxies behind the lmc.

astro-ph;0001435	the macho project 9 million star color-magnitude diagram of the large  magellanic cloud	we present a 9 million star color-magnitude diagram (9m cmd) of the lmc bar.the 9m cmd reveals a complex superposition of different age and metallicitystellar populations, with important stellar evolutionary phases occurring over3 orders of magnitude in number density. first, we count the non-variablesupergiants, the associated cepheids, and measure the effective temperaturesdefining the instability strip. lifetime predictions of stellar evolutiontheory are tested, with implications for the origin of low-luminosity cepheids.the highly-evolved agb stars have a bimodal distribution in brightness, whichwe interpret as discrete old populations (&gt;1 gyr). the faint agb may bemetal-poor and very old. we identify the clusters ngc 411 and m3 as templatesfor the admixture of old stellar populations. however, there are indicationsthat the old and metal-poor field population has a red hb morphology: the rrlyraes lie on the red edge of the instability strip, the agb-bump is very red,and the ratio of agb-bump stars to rr lyraes is quite large. if the hb secondparameter is age, the old and metal-poor field population likely formed afterthe oldest clusters. lifetime predictions of stellar evolution theory lead usto associate a significant fraction of the red hb clump giants with the sameold and metal-poor population producing the rr lyraes and the agb-bump. in thiscase, compared to the age-dependent luminosity predictions of stellar evolutiontheory, the red hb clump is too bright relative to the rr lyraes and agb-bump.last, the surface density profile of rr lyraes is fit by an exponential,favoring a disk-like rather than spheroidal distribution. we conclude that theage of the lmc disk is probably similar to the age of the galactic disk.(abridged)

astro-ph;0002510	the macho project: microlensing optical depth towards the galactic bulge  from difference image analysis	we present the microlensing optical depth towards the galactic bulge based onthe detection of 99 events found in our difference image analysis (dia) survey.this analysis encompasses three years of data, covering ~ 17 million stars in ~4 deg^2, to a source star baseline magnitude limit of v = 23. the dia techniqueimproves the quality of photometry in crowded fields, and allows us to detectmore microlensing events with faint source stars. we find this method increasesthe number of detection events by 85% compared with the standard analysistechnique. dia light curves of the events are presented and the microlensingfit parameters are given. the total microlensing optical depth is estimated tobe tau_(total)= 2.43^(+0.39/-0.38) x 10^(-6) averaged over 8 fields centered atl=2.68 and b=-3.35. for the bulge component we findtau_(bulge)=3.23^(+0.52/-0.50) x 10^(-6) assuming a 25% stellar contributionfrom disk sources. these optical depths are in good agreement with the pastdeterminations of the macho alcock et al. (1997) and ogle udalski et al. (1994)groups, and are higher than predicted by contemporary galactic models. we showthat our observed event timescale distribution is consistent with thedistribution expected from normal mass stars, if we adopt the stellar massfunction of scalo (1986) as our lens mass function. however, we note that asthere is still disagreement about the exact form of the stellar mass function,there is uncertainty in this conclusion. based on our event timescaledistribution we find no evidence for the existence of a large population ofbrown dwarfs in the direction of the galactic bulge.

astro-ph;0102262	the macho project lmc variable star inventory: x. the r coronae borealis  stars	we report the discovery of eight new r coronae borealis (rcb) stars in thelarge magellanic cloud (lmc) using the macho project photometry database. thediscovery of these new stars increases the number of known rcb stars in the lmcto thirteen. we have also discovered four stars similar to the galacticvariable dy per. these stars decline much more slowly and are cooler than thercb stars. the absolute luminosities of the galactic rcb stars are unknownsince there is no direct measurement of the distance to any galactic rcb star.hence, the importance of the lmc rcb stars. we find a much larger range ofabsolute magnitudes (m(v) = -2.5 to -5 mag) than inferred from the smallpre-macho sample of lmc rcb stars. it is likely that there is a temperature -m(v)relationship with the cooler stars being intrinsically fainter. cool (~5000k) rcb stars are much more common than previously thought based on the galacticrcb star sample. using the fairly complete sample of rcb stars discovered inthe macho fields, we have estimated the likely number of rcb stars in thegalaxy to be ~3,200. the smc macho fields were also searched for rcb stars butnone were found.

astro-ph;0109467	gravitational microlensing events due to stellar mass black holes	we present an analysis of the longest timescale microlensing eventsdiscovered by the macho collaboration during a 7 year survey of the galacticbulge. we find 6 events that exhibit very strong microlensing parallax signalsdue, in part, to accurate photometric data from the gman and mpscollaborations. the microlensing parallax fit parameters are used in alikelihood analysis, which is able to estimate the distance and masses of thelens objects based upon a standard model of the galactic velocity distribution.this analysis indicates that the most likely masses of 5 of the 6 lenses are &gt;1 msun, which suggests that a substantial fraction of the galactic lenses maybe massive stellar remnants. this could explain the observed excess of longtimescale microlensing events. the lenses for events macho-96-blg-5 andmacho-98-blg-6 are the most massive, with mass estimates of m/msun = 6 +10/-3and m/msun = 6 +7/-3, respectively. the observed upper limits on the absolutebrightness of main sequence stars for these lenses are &lt; 1 lsun, so both lensesare black hole candidates. the black hole interpretation is also favored by alikelihood analysis with a bayesian prior using a conventional model for thelens mass function. we consider the possibility that the source stars for someof these 6 events may lie in the foreground or background of the galacticbulge, but we find that this is unlikely. future hst observations of theseevents can either confirm the black hole lens hypothesis or detect the lensstars and provide a direct measurement of their masses. future observations ofsimilar events by sim or the keck or vlti interferometers will allow directmeasurements of the lens masses for stellar remnant lenses as well.

astro-ph;0304464	recent microlensing results from the macho project	we describe a few recent microlensing results from the macho collaboration.the aim of the macho project was the identification and quantitativedescription of dark and luminous matter in the milky way using microlensingtoward the magellanic clouds and galactic bulge. we start with a discussion ofthe hst follow-up observations of the microlensing events toward the lmcdetected in the first 5 years of the experiment. using color-magnitude diagramswe attempt to distinguish between two possible locations of the microlensingsources: 1) in the lmc or 2) behind the lmc. we conclude that unless theextinction is extremely patchy, it is very unlikely that most of the lmc eventshave sources behind the lmc. during an examination of the hst images of the 13lmc events we found a very red object next to the source star of event lmc-5.astrometry, microlensing parallax fit, and a spectrum suggest that in this casewe directly image the lens - a low-mass disk star.  then we focus on the majority of events observed by the macho project, whichare detected toward the galactic bulge. we argue that the microlensing opticaldepth toward the bulge is best measured using events that have clump giantsources, which are almost unaffected by blending. from this sample we derive alow optical depth toward the galactic bulge of (1.4 +/- 0.3) x 10^{-6}, in goodagreement with other observational constraints and with theoretical models. thepresence of many long-duration events among the bulge candidates allows us toinvestigate the microlensing parallax effect. events with the strongestparallax signal are probably due to massive remnants. events macho-96-blg-5 andmacho-98-blg-6 might have been caused by the 6-solar-mass black holes.

astro-ph;0410319	microlensing optical depth towards the galactic bulge using clump giants  from the macho survey	using 7 years of macho survey data, we present a new determination of theoptical depth to microlensing towards the galactic bulge. we select the sampleof 62 microlensing events (60 unique) on clump giant sources and perform adetailed efficiency analysis. we use only the clump giant sources because theseare bright bulge stars and are not as strongly affected by blending as otherevents. using a subsample of 42 clump events concentrated in just 4.5 squaredegrees, we find tau = 2.17^{+0.47}_{-0.38} x 10^{-6} at (l,b) = (1.50, -2.68),somewhat smaller than found in most previous macho studies, but in excellentagreement with recent theoretical predictions. we also present the opticaldepth in each of the 19 fields in which we detected events, and find limits onoptical depth for fields with no events. the errors in optical depth inindividual fields are dominated by poisson noise. we measure optical depthgradients (1.06 +/- 0.71) x 10^{-6} deg^{-1} and (0.29 +/- 0.43) x 10^{-6}deg^{-1} in the galactic latitude b and longitude l directions, respectively.finally, we discuss the possibility of anomalous duration distribution ofevents in the field 104 centered on (l,b) = (3.11, -3.01) as well asinvestigate spatial clustering of events in all fields.

astro-ph;0411357	spectroscopy of high-redshift supernovae from the essence project: the  first two years	we present the results of spectroscopic observations of targets discoveredduring the first two years of the essence project. the goal of essence is touse a sample of ~200 type ia supernovae (sne ia) at moderate redshifts (0.2 &lt; z&lt; 0.8) to place constraints on the equation of state of the universe.spectroscopy not only provides the redshifts of the objects, but also confirmsthat some of the discoveries are indeed sne ia. this confirmation is criticalto the project, as techniques developed to determine luminosity distances tosne ia depend upon the knowledge that the objects at high redshift are the sameas the ones at low redshift. we describe the methods of target selection andprioritization, the telescopes and detectors, and the software used to identifyobjects. the redshifts deduced from spectral matching of high-redshift sne iawith low-redshift sne ia are consistent with those determined from host-galaxyspectra. we show that the high-redshift sne ia match well with low-redshifttemplates. we include all spectra obtained by the essence project, including 52sne ia, 5 core-collapse sne, 12 active galactic nuclei, 19 galaxies, 4 possiblyvariable stars, and 16 objects with uncertain identifications.

astro-ph;0508681	hubble space telescope observations of nine high-redshift essence  supernovae	we present broad-band light curves of nine supernovae ranging in redshiftfrom 0.5 to 0.8. the supernovae were discovered as part of the essence project,and the light curves are a combination of cerro tololo 4-m and hubble spacetelescope (hst) photometry. on the basis of spectra and/or light-curve fitting,eight of these objects are definitely type ia supernovae, while theclassification of one is problematic. the essence project is a five-yearendeavor to discover about 200 high-redshift type ia supernovae, with the goalof tightly constraining the time average of the equation-of-state parameter [w= p/(rho c^2)] of the "dark energy." to help minimize our systematic errors,all of our ground-based photometry is obtained with the same telescope andinstrument. in 2003 the highest-redshift subset of essence supernovae wasselected for detailed study with hst. here we present the first photometricresults of the survey. we find that all but one of the essence sne have slowlydeclining light curves, and the sample is not representative of thelow-redshift set of essence type ia supernovae. this is unlikely to be a signof evolution in the population. we attribute the decline-rate distribution ofhst events to a selection bias at the high-redshift edge of our sample and findthat such a bias will infect other magnitude-limited sn ia searches unlessappropriate precautions are taken.

astro-ph;0510089	using line profiles to test the fraternity of type ia supernovae at high  and low redshifts	using archival data of low-redshift (z &lt; 0.01) type ia supernovae (sn ia) andrecent observations of high-redshift (0.16 &lt; z &lt;0.64; matheson et al. 2005) snia, we study the "uniformity'' of the spectroscopic properties of nearby anddistant sn ia. we find no difference in the measures we describe here. in thispaper, we base our analysis solely on line-profile morphology, focusing onmeasurements of the velocity location of maximum absorption (vabs) and peakemission (vpeak). we find that the evolution of vabs and vpeak for our samplelines (ca ii 3945, si ii 6355, and s ii 5454, 5640) is similar for both thelow- and high-redshift samples. we find that vabs for the weak s ii 5454, 5640lines, and vpeak for s ii 5454, can be used to identify fast-declining [dm15 &gt;1.7] sn ia, which are also subluminous. in addition, we give the first directevidence in two high-z sn ia spectra of a double-absorption feature in ca ii3945, an event also observed, though infrequently, in low-redshift sn iaspectra (6/22 sn ia in our local sample). we report for the first time theunambiguous and systematic intrinsic blueshift of peak emission of opticalp-cygni line profiles in type ia spectra, by as much as 8000 km/s. all thehigh-z sn ia analyzed in this paper were discovered and followed up by theessence collaboration, and are now publicly available.

astro-ph;0701041	observational constraints on the nature of the dark energy: first  cosmological results from the essence supernova survey	we present constraints on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter,w=p/(rho c^2), using 60 type ia supernovae (sne ia) from the essence supernovasurvey. we derive a set of constraints on the nature of the dark energyassuming a flat universe. by including constraints on (omega_m, w) from baryonacoustic oscillations, we obtain a value for a static equation-of-stateparameter w=-1.05^{+0.13}_{-0.12} (stat; 1 sigma) +- 0.11 (sys) andomega_m=0.274^{+0.033}_{-0.020} (stat; 1 sigma) with a best-fit chi^2/dof of0.96. these results are consistent with those reported by the supernova legacysurvey in a similar program measuring supernova distances and redshifts. weevaluate sources of systematic error that afflict supernova observations andpresent monte carlo simulations that explore these effects. currently, thelargest systematic currently with the potential to affect our measurements isthe treatment of extinction due to dust in the supernova host galaxies.combining our set of essence sne ia with the supernova legacy survey sne ia, weobtain a joint constraint of w=-1.07^{+0.09}_{-0.09} (stat; 1 sigma) +- 0.12(sys), omega_m=0.267^{+0.028}_{-0.018} (stat; 1 sigma) with a best-fitchi^2/dof of 0.91. the current sn ia data are fully consistent with acosmological constant.

astro-ph;0701043	the essence supernova survey: survey optimization, observations, and  supernova photometry	we describe the implementation and optimization of the essence supernovasurvey, which we have undertaken to measure the equation of state parameter ofthe dark energy. we present a method for optimizing the survey exposure timesand cadence to maximize our sensitivity to the dark energy equation of stateparameter w=p/rho c^2 for a given fixed amount of telescope time. for oursurvey on the ctio 4m telescope, measuring the luminosity distances andredshifts for supernovae at modest redshifts (z~0.5 +- 0.2) is optimal fordetermining w. we describe the data analysis pipeline based on using reliableand robust image subtraction to find supernovae automatically and in nearreal-time. since making cosmological inferences with supernovae reliescrucially on accurate measurement of their brightnesses, we describe ourefforts to establish a thorough calibration of the ctio 4m natural photometricsystem. in its first four years, essence has discovered and spectroscopicallyconfirmed 102 type ia sne, at redshifts from 0.10 to 0.78, identified throughan impartial, effective methodology for spectroscopic classification andredshift determination. we present the resulting light curves for the all typeia supernovae found by essence and used in our measurement of w, presented inwood-vasey et al, 2007.

astro-ph;9309052	possible gravitational microlensing of a star in the large magellanic  cloud	there is now abundant evidence for the presence of large quantities of unseenmatter surrounding normal galaxies, including our own$^{1,2}$. the nature ofthis `dark matter' is unknown, except that it cannot be made of normal stars,dust, or gas, as they would be easily detected. exotic particles such asaxions, massive neutrinos or other weakly interacting massive particles(collectively known as wimps) have been proposed)$^{3,4}$, but have yet to bedetected. a less exotic alternative is normal matter in the form of bodies withmasses ranging from that of a large planet to a few $ \msun$. such objects,known collectively as massive compact halo objects$^5$ (machos) might be browndwarfs or `jupiters' (bodies too small to produce their own energy by fusion),neutron stars, old white dwarfs, or black holes. paczynski$^6$ suggested thatmachos might act as gravitational microlenses, occasionally causing theapparent brightness of distant background stars temporarily to increase. we areconducting a microlensing experiment to determine whether the dark matter haloof our galaxy is made up of machos. here we report a candidate for amicrolensing event, detected by monitoring the light curves of 1.8 millionstars in the large magellanic cloud for one year. the light curve shows novariation for most of the year of data taking, and an upward excursion lastingover 1 month, with a maximum increase of $\approx \bf 2$ mag. the most probablelens mass, inferred from the duration of the event, is $\bf \sim 0.1 \,\msun$.

astro-ph;9411019	theory of exploring the dark halo with microlensing 1: power--law models	the detection of microlensing has opened the way for the development of newmethods in galactic astronomy. this series of papers investigates whatmicrolensing can teach us about the structure and shape of the dark halo. inthis paper we present formulas for the microlensing rate, optical depth andevent duration distributions for a simple set of axisymmetric disk-halo models.the halos are based on the "power--law models" which have simple velocitydistributions. using these models, we show that there is a large uncertainty inthe predicted microlensing rate because of uncertainty in the halo parameters.for example, models which reproduce the measured galactic observables to withintheir errors still differ in microlensing rate towards the magellanic clouds bymore than a factor of ten. we find that while the more easily computed opticaldepth correlates well with microlensing rate, the ratio of optical depth torate can vary by a factor of two (or greater if the disk is maximal).comparison of microlensing rates towards the large and small magellanic clouds(lmc and smc) and m31 can be used to aid determinations of the halo flatteningand rotation curve slope. for example, the ratio of microlensing rates towardsthe lmc and smc is $\sim 0.7-0.8$ for e0 halos and $\sim 1.0 - 1.2$ for e7halos (c.f. sackett \&amp; gould 1993). once the flattening has been established,the ratio of microlensing rates towards m31 and the lmc may help to distinguishbetween models with rising, flat or falling rotation curves. comparison ofrates along lmc and galactic bulge lines-of-sight gives useful information onthe halo core radius, although this may not be so easy to extract in practice.maximal disk models provide substantially smaller halo optical depths, shorterevent durations and even larger model uncertainties.

astro-ph;9411061	the macho project lmc variable star inventory: i. beat cepheids -  conclusive evidence for the excitation of the second overtone in classical  cepheids	we report the discovery of 45 beat cepheids in the large magellanic cloud(lmc) using the macho project photometry database. the variables which arepulsating simultaneously in two radial modes are shown to break cleanly intotwo period-ratio groups, providing the first unambiguous evidence that thesecond overtone is indeed excited in real cepheids. thirty stars are beating inthe fundamental and first overtone mode (f/1h, with a period ratio in theneighborhood of 0.72), and fifteen stars are beating in the first and secondovertone (1h/2h, with a period ratio near 0.80). the f/1h period ratios aresystematically higher than known galactic beat cepheids, indicating ametallicity dependence whose sense is in agreement with theory. beat cepheidsin the lmc are found to select the 1h/2h mode for fundamental periods shorterthan 1.25 days. we find the fraction of cepheids excited in two modes to beabout 20\% for stars with fundamental periods shorter than 2.5 days. we fail toconfirm any of the proposed beat cepheid candidates common to our sample fromthe surveys of andreasen (1987) and andreasen \&amp; petersen (1987). we alsopresent finder charts and find several of the beat cepheids to be in or nearlmc clusters.

astro-ph;9506113	the macho project first year lmc results: the microlensing rate and the  nature of the galactic dark halo	the macho collaboration reports on the analysis of our first year lmc data,9.5 million light curves with an average of 235 observations each. automatedselection procedures give 3 events consistent with microlensing. we evaluateour experimental detection efficiency using a range of monte- carlosimulations. using a `standard' halo density profile we find that a halocomprised entirely of machos in the mass range 3 \ten{-4} to 0.06 \msun wouldpredict &gt; 15 detected events in this dataset; thus a standard spherical halocannot be dominated by objects in this mass range. assuming all three eventsare microlensing of halo objects and fitting a naive spherical halo model toour data yields a macho halo fraction f =0.19+0.16-0.10, a total mass in machos(inside 50 kpc) of 7.6+6-4 \ten{10} \msun, and a microlensing optical depth8.8+7-5 \ten{-8} (68\% cl). exploring a wide range of halo models we find thatour constraints on the macho fraction are quite model-dependent, butconstraints on the total mass in machos within 50 kpc are quite secure.

astro-ph;9506114	first observation of parallax in a gravitational microlensing event	we present the first detection of parallax effects in a gravitationalmicrolensing event. parallax in a gravitational microlensing event observedonly from the earth appears as a distortion of the lightcurve due to the motionof the earth around the sun. this distortion can be detected if the eventduration is not much less than a year and if the projected velocity of the lensis not much larger than the orbital velocity of the earth about the sun. theevent presented here has a duration of 220 days and clearly shows thedistortion due to the earth's motion. we find that the projected velocity ofthe lens is 75+/-5 km/s at an angle of 28+/-4 deg from the direction ofincreasing galactic longitude, as expected for a lens in the galactic disk.  a likelihood analysis yields estimates of the distance to and mass of thelens: d_{lens} = 1.7 (+1.1/-0.7) kpc and m = 1.3 (+1.3/-0.6) msun, suggestingthat the lens is a remnant such as a white dwarf or neutron star. a less likelypossibility is that the lens is a main sequence star. if so, we can add ourupper limit on the observed flux from the lens to the analysis. this modifiesthe estimates to: d_{lens} = 2.8 (+1.1/-0.6) kpc, and m = 0.6 (+0.4/-0.2) msun.

astro-ph;9512146	the macho project: 45 candidate microlensing events from the first year  galactic bulge data	we report the detection of 45 candidate microlensing events in fields towardthe galactic bulge. these come from the analysis of 24 fields containing 12.6million stars observed for 190 days in 1993. many of these events are ofextremely high signal to noise and are remarkable examples of gravitationalmicrolensing. the distribution of peak magnifications is shown to be consistentwith the microlensing interpretation of these events. using a sub-sample of 1.3million ``clump giant" stars whose distance and detection efficiency are wellknown, we find 13 events and estimate the microlensing optical depth toward thegalactic bulge as $\tau_{\rm bulge} = 3.9 {+ 1.8 \atop - 1.2} \times 10^{-6}$averaged over an area of $\sim 12$ square degrees centered at galacticcoordinates $\ell = 2.55^\circ$ and $b = -3.64^\circ$. this is similar to thevalue reported by the ogle collaboration, and is marginally higher than currenttheoretical models for $\tau_{\rm bulge}$. the optical depth is also seen toincrease significantly for decreasing $\vert b\vert$. these results demonstratethat obtaining large numbers of microlensing events toward the galactic bulgeis feasible, and that the study of such events will have important consequencesfor the structure of the galaxy and its dark halo.

astro-ph;9604176	the macho project: limits on planetary mass dark matter in the galactic  halo from gravitational microlensing	the macho project has been monitoring about ten million stars in the largemagellanic cloud in the search for gravitational microlensing events caused bymassive compact halo objects (machos) in the halo of the milky way. in ourstandard analysis, we have searched this data set for well sampled, longduration microlensing lightcurves, detected several microlensing eventsconsistent with machos in the 0.1 &lt; m &lt; 1.0 m_sun mass range, and set limits onthe abundance of objects with masses 1e-5 &lt; m &lt; 0.1 m_sun. in this paper, wepresent a different type of analysis involving the search for very short timescale brightenings of stars which is used to set strong limits on the abundanceof lower mass machos. our analysis of the first two years of data toward thelmc indicates that machos with masses in the range 2.5e-7 &lt; m &lt; 5.2e-4 m_suncannot make up the entire mass of a standard spherical dark halo. combiningthese results with those from the standard analysis, we find that the halo darkmatter may not be comprised of objects with masses 2.5e-7 &lt; m &lt; 8.1e-2 m_sun.

astro-ph;9606012	a binary lensing event toward the lmc: observations and dark matter  implications	the macho collaboration has recently analyzed 2.1 years of photometric datafor about 8.5 million stars in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). this analysishas revealed 8 candidate microlensing events and a total microlensing opticaldepth of $\tau_{meas} = 2.9 +1.4/-0.9 \times 10^{-7}$. this significantlyexceeds the number of events (1.1) and the microlensing optical depth predictedfrom known stellar populations: $\tau_{back} = 5.4\times 10^{-8}$, but it isconsistent with models in which about half of the standard dark halo mass iscomposed of machos of mass $\sim 0.5 \msun$. one of these 8 events appears tobe a binary lensing event with a caustic crossing that is partially resolvedwhich allows us to estimate the distance to the lenses. if the source star isnot a short period binary star, then we show that the lens system is verylikely to reside in the lmc. however, if we assume that the optical depth forlmc-lmc lensing is large enough to account for our entire lensing signal, thenthe binary event does not appear to be consistent with lensing of a single lmcsource star by a binary residing in the lmc. thus, while the binary lens mayindeed reside in the lmc, there is no indication that most of the lenses residein the lmc.

astro-ph;9606134	the macho project 2nd year lmc microlensing results and dark matter  implications	the macho project is searching for galactic dark matter in the form ofmassive compact halo objects (machos). millions of stars in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc), small magellanic cloud (smc), and galactic bulge arephotometrically monitored in an attempt to detect rare gravitationalmicrolensing events caused by otherwise invisible machos. analysis of two yearsof photometry on 8.5 million stars in the lmc reveals 8 candidate microlensingevents, far more than the $\sim1$ event expected from lensing by low-mass starsin known galactic populations. from these eight events we estimate the opticaldepth towards the lmc from events with $2 &lt; \that &lt; 200$ days to be$\tau_2^{200} \approx 2.9 ^{+1.4}_{-0.9} \ten{-7}$. this exceeds the opticaldepth of $0.5\ten{-7}$ expected from known stars and is to be compared with anoptical depth of $4.7\ten{-7}$ predicted for a ``standard'' halo composedentirely of machos. the total mass in this lensing population is $\approx2^{+1.2}_{-0.7} \ten{11} \msun$ (within 50 kpc from the galactic center). eventtimescales yield a most probable macho mass of $0.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\msun$,although this value is quite model dependent.

astro-ph;9702199	macho alert 95-30 : first real-time observation of extended source  effects in gravitational microlensing	we present analysis of macho alert 95-30, a dramatic gravitationalmicrolensing event towards the galactic bulge whose peak magnification departssignificantly from the standard point-source microlensing model. alert 95-30was observed in real-time by the global microlensing alert network (gman),which obtained densely sampled photometric and spectroscopic data throughoutthe event. we interpret the light-curve ``fine structure'' as indicatingtransit of the lens across the extended face of the source star. this signifiesresolution of a star several kpc distant. we find a lens angular impactparameter theta_{min}/theta_{source} = 0.715 +/- 0.003. this information, alongwith the radius and distance of the source, provides an additional constrainton the lensing system. spectroscopic and photometric data indicate the sourceis an m4 iii star of radius 61 +/- 12 rsun, located on the far side of thebulge at 9 kpc. we derive a lens angular velocity, relative to the source, of21.5 +/- 4.9 km/s/kpc, where the error is dominated by uncertainty in thesource radius. likelihood analysis yields a median lens mass of0.67{+2.53}{-0.46} msun, located with 80% probability in the galactic bulge ata distance of 6.93{+1.56}{-2.25} kpc. if the lens is a main-sequence star, wecan include constraints on the lens luminosity. this modifies our estimates tom_lens = 0.53{+0.52}{-0.35} msun and d_lens = 6.57{+0.99}{-2.25} kpc. spectrataken during the event show that the absorption line equivalent widths of halpha and the tio bands near 6700 a vary, as predicted for microlensing of anextended source. this is most likely due to center-to-limb variation in thestellar spectral lines. these data demonstrate the feasibility of usingmicrolensing limb crossings as a tool to probe stellar atmospheres directly.

astro-ph;9710037	the mount stromlo abell cluster supernova search	we have initiated a three-year project to find supernovae (sne) in awell-defined sample of high-density southern abell clusters with redshifts$z\leq0.08$. these observations will provide a volume-limited sample of sne iato more than a magnitude below their peak brightness, and will enable us to:(1) measure the luminosity function of sne, (2) further explore the correlationof light curve shape with the absolute luminosity of sne ia to betterunderstand sne ia as distance indicators, (3) measure sn rates, (4) measure thebulk motion of the local group using sne ia, and (5) directly compare sn iadistances to brightest cluster galaxy distances. we use the macho wide-field2-color imager on the 1.3m telescope at mount stromlo to routinely monitor$\sim 12$ clusters per week. we describe our technique for target selection andscheduling search observations, and for finding and identifying sn candidates.we also describe the results from the first year of our program, including thedetection of 19 sne, several rr-lyrae variables, and hundreds of asteroids.

astro-ph;9807163	discovery and characterization of a caustic crossing microlensing event  in the smc	we present photometric observations and analysis of the second microlensingevent detected towards the small magellanic cloud (smc), macho alert 98-smc-1.this event was detected early enough to allow intensive observation of thelightcurve. these observations revealed 98-smc-1 to be the first causticcrossing, binary microlensing event towards the magellanic clouds to bediscovered in progress.  frequent coverage of the evolving lightcurve allowed an accurate predictionfor the date of the source crossing out of the lens caustic structure. thecaustic crossing temporal width, along with the angular size of the sourcestar, measures the proper motion of the lens with respect to the source, andthus allows an estimate of the location of the lens. lenses located in thegalactic halo would have a velocity projected to the smc of v^hat ~1500 km/s,while an smc lens would typically have v^hat ~60 km/s.  we have performed a joint fit to the macho/gman data presented here,including recent eros data of this event. these joint data are sufficient toconstrain the time for the lens to move an angle equal to the source angularradius; 0.116 +/- 0.010 days. we estimate a radius for the lensed source of 1.4+/- 0.1 r_sun. this yields a projected velocity of v^hat = 84 +/- 9 km/s. only0.15% of halo lenses would be expected to have a v^hat value at least as smallas this, while 31% of smc lenses would be expected to have v^hat as large asthis. this implies that the lensing system is more likely to reside in the smcthan in the galactic halo.

astro-ph;9811240	the macho project large magellanic cloud variable star inventory. viii.  the recent star formation history of the lmc from the cepheid period  distribution	we present an analysis of the period distribution of $\sim 1800$ cepheids inthe large magellanic cloud, based on data obtained by the macho microlensingexperiment and on a previous catalogue by payne-gaposchkin. using stellarevolution and pulsation models, we construct theoretical period-frequencydistributions that are compared to the observations. these models reveal that asignificant burst of star formation has occurred recently in the lmc ($\sim1.15\times 10^8$ years). we also show that during the last $\sim 10^8$ years,the main center of star formation has been propagating from se to nw along thebar. we find that the evolutionary masses of cepheids are still smaller thanpulsation masses by $\sim 7$ % and that the red edge of the cepheid instabilitystrip could be slightly bluer than indicated by theory. there are $\sim 600$cepheids with periods below $\sim 2.5$ days cannot be explained by evolutiontheory. we suggest that they are anomalous cepheids; a number of these starsare double-mode cepheids.

astro-ph;9903215	difference image analysis of galactic microlensing i. data analysis	this is a preliminary report on the application of difference image analysis(dia) to galactic bulge images. the aim of this analysis is to increase thesensitivity to the detection of gravitational microlensing. we discuss how thedia technique simplifies the process of discovering microlensing events bydetecting only objects which have variable flux. we illustrate how the diatechnique is not limited to detection of so called ``pixel lensing'' events,but can also be used to improve photometry for classical microlensing events byremoving the effects of blending. we will present a method whereby dia can beused to reveal the true unblended colours, positions and light curves ofmicrolensing events. we discuss the need for a technique to obtain the accuratemicrolensing time scales from blended sources, and present a possible solutionto this problem using the existing hst colour magnitude diagrams of thegalactic bulge and lmc. the use of such a solution with both classical andpixel microlensing searches is discussed. we show that one of the major causesof systematic noise in dia is differential refraction. a technique for removingthis systematic by effectively registering images to a common airmass ispresented. improvements to commonly used image differencing techniques arediscussed.

astro-ph;9906096	sn1997cy/grb970514 - a new piece in the grb puzzle?	we present observations of sn1997cy, a supernova discovered as part of themount stromlo abell cluster sn search, which does not easily fit into thetraditional classification scheme for supernovae. this object's extraordinaryoptical properties and coincidence with grb970514, a short duration gamma rayburst, suggest a second case, after sn1998bw/grb980425, for a sn-grbassociation. sn1997cy is among the most luminous sne yet discovered and has apeculiar spectrum. we present evidence that sn1997cy ejected approximately 2solar masses of 56ni, supported by its late-time light curve, and feii/[feiii]lines in its spectrum, although it is possible that both these observations canbe explained via circumstellar interaction. while sn1998bw and sn1997cy appearto be very different objects with respect to both their gamma ray and opticalproperties, sn1997cy and the optical transient associated with grb970508 haveroughly similar late-time optical behavior. this similarity may indicate thatthe late-time optical output of these two intrinsically bright transient eventshave a common physical process. although the connection between grb970514 andsn1997cy is suggestive, it is not conclusive. however, if this association isreal, followup of short duration grbs detected with batse or hete2 shouldreveal objects similar to sn1997cy.

astro-ph;9909227	calibration of the macho photometry database	the macho project is a microlensing survey that monitors the brightnesses of60 million stars in the large magellanic cloud (lmc), small magellanic cloud,and galactic bulge. our database presently contains about 80 billionphotometric measurements, a significant fraction of all astronomicalphotometry. we describe the calibration of macho two-color photometry andtransformation to the standard kron-cousins v and r system. calibrated machophotometry may be properly compared with all other observations on thekron-cousins standard system, enhancing the astrophysical value of these data.for 9 million stars in the lmc bar, independent photometric measurements of20,000 stars with v &lt; 18 mag in field-overlap regions demonstrate an internalprecision sigv = 0.021, sigr = 0.019, and sig(v-r) = 0.028 mag. the accuracy ofthe zero-point in this calibration is estimated to be +-0.035 mag for starswith colors in the range -0.1 &lt; (v-r) &lt; 1.2 mag. a comparison of calibratedmacho photometry with published photometric sequences and new hubble spacetelescope observations shows agreement. the current calibration zero-pointuncertainty for the remainder of the macho photometry database is estimated tobe +- 0.10 mag in v or r and +-0.04 mag in (v-r). we describe the firstapplication of calibrated macho photometry data: the construction of acolor-magnitude diagram used to calculate our experimental sensitivity todetect microlensing in the lmc.

0811.4424	spectroscopy of high-redshift supernovae from the essence project: the  first four years	we present the results of spectroscopic observations from the essencehigh-redshift supernova (sn) survey during its first four years of operation.this sample includes spectra of all sne ia whose light curves were presented bymiknaitis et al. (2007) and used in the cosmological analyses of davis et al.(2007) and wood-vasey et al. (2007). the sample represents 273 hours ofspectroscopic observations with 6.5 - 10-m-class telescopes of objects detectedand selected for spectroscopy by the essence team. we present 174 spectra of156 objects. combining this sample with that of matheson et al. (2005), we havea total sample of 329 spectra of 274 objects. from this, we are able tospectroscopically classify 118 type ia sne. as the survey has matured, theefficiency of classifying sne ia has remained constant while we have observedboth higher-redshift sne ia and sne ia farther from maximum brightness.examining the subsample of sne ia with host-galaxy redshifts shows thatredshifts derived from only the sn ia spectra are consistent with redshiftsfound from host-galaxy spectra. moreover, the phases derived from only the snia spectra are consistent with those derived from light-curve fits. bycomparing our spectra to local templates, we find that the rate of objectssimilar to the overluminous sn 1991t and the underluminous sn 1991bg in oursample are consistent with that of the local sample. we do note, however, thatwe detect no object spectroscopically or photometrically similar to sn 1991bg.although systematic effects could reduce the high-redshift rate we expect basedon the low-redshift surveys, it is possible that sn 1991bg-like sne ia are lessprevalent at high redshift.
