0902.0651	x-ray absorption and reflection in active galactic nuclei	x-ray spectroscopy offers an opportunity to study the complex mixture ofemitting and absorbing components in the circumnuclear regions of activegalactic nuclei, and to learn about the accretion process that fuels agn andthe feedback of material to their host galaxies. we describe the spectralsignatures that may be studied and review the x-ray spectra and spectralvariability of active galaxies, concentrating on progress from recent chandra,xmm-newton and suzaku data for local type 1 agn. we describe the evidence forabsorption covering a wide range of column densities, ionization and dynamics,and discuss the growing evidence for partial-covering absorption from data atenergies &gt; 10 kev. such absorption can also explain the observed x-ray spectralcurvature and variability in agn at lower energies and is likely an importantfactor in shaping the observed properties of this class of source.consideration of self-consistent models for local agn indicates that x-rayspectra likely comprise a combination of absorption and reflection effects frommaterial originating within a few light days of the black hole as well as onlarger scales. it is likely that agn x-ray spectra may be strongly affected bythe presence of disk-wind outflows that are expected in systems with highaccretion rates, and we describe models that attempt to predict the effects ofradiative transfer through such winds, and discuss the prospects for new datato test and address these ideas.

0906.0312	a compton-thick wind in the high luminosity quasar, pds 456	pds 456 is a nearby (z=0.184), luminous (l_bol ~10^47 erg/s) type i quasar. adeep 190 ks suzaku observation in february 2007 revealed the complex, broadband x-ray spectrum of pds 456. the suzaku spectrum exhibits highlystatistically significant absorption features near 9 kev in the quasarrest--frame. we show that the most plausible origin of the absorption is fromblue-shifted resonance (1s-2p) transitions of hydrogen-like iron (at 6.97 kevin the rest frame). this indicates that a highly ionized outflow may be presentmoving at near relativistic velocities (~0.25c). a possible hard x-ray excessis detected above 15 kev with hxd (at 99.8% confidence), which may arise fromhigh column density gas (nh&gt;10^24cm^-2) partially covering the x-ray emission,or through strong compton reflection. here we propose that the iron k-shellabsorption in pds 456 is associated with a thick, possibly clumpy outflow,covering about 20% of $4\pi$ steradian solid angle. the outflow is likelylaunched from the inner accretion disk, within 15-100 gravitational radii ofthe black hole. the kinetic power of the outflow may be similar to thebolometric luminosity of pds 456. such a powerful wind could have a significanteffect on the co-evolution of the host galaxy and its supermassive black hole,through feedback.

0907.3114	the absorption-dominated model for the x-ray spectra of type i active  galaxies: mcg-6-30-15	mcg-6-30-15 is the archetypal example of a type i active galaxy showing broad"red-wing" emission in its x-ray spectrum at energies below the 6.4 kev fek-alpha emission line and a continuum excess above 20 kev. miller et al. (2008)showed that these spectral features could be caused by clumpy absorbingmaterial, but reynolds et al. (2009) have argued that the observed fe k-alphaline luminosity is inconsistent with this explanation unless the globalcovering factor of the absorber(s) is very low. however, the reynolds et al.calculation effectively considers the only source of opacity to be the fe kbound-free transition and neglects the opacity at the line energy: correctionto realistic opacity decreases the predicted line flux by a large factor. wealso discuss the interpretation of the covering factor and the possible effectof occultation by the accretion disk. finally, we consider a model formcg-6-30-15 dominated by clumpy absorption, which is consistent with globalcovering factor 0.45, although models that include the effects of comptonscattering are required to reach a full understanding. variations in coveringfraction may dominate the observed x-ray spectral variability.

0909.0899	on the efficiency of production of the fe kalpha emission line in  neutral matter	the absolute luminosity of the fe kalpha emission line from matterilluminated by x-rays in astrophysical sources is nontrivial to calculateexcept when the line-emitting medium is optically-thin to absorption andscattering. we characterize the fe kalpha line flux using a dimensionlessefficiency, defined as the fraction of continuum photons above the fe k shellabsorption edge threshold energy that appear in the line. the optically-thinapproximation begins to break down even for column densities as small as 2 x10^22 cm^-2. we show how to obtain reliable estimates of the fe kalpha lineefficiency in the case of cold, neutral matter, even for the compton-thickregime. we find that, regardless of geometry and covering factor, the largestfe kalpha line efficiency is attained well before the medium becomescompton-thick. for cosmic elemental abundances it is difficult to achieve anefficiency higher than a few percent under the most favorable conditions andlines of sight. for a given geometry, compton-thick lines-of-sight may have fekalpha line efficiencies that are orders of magnitude less than the maximumpossible for that geometry. configurations that allow unobscured views of acompton-thick reflecting surface are capable of yielding the highestefficiencies. our results can be used to estimate the predicted flux of thenarrow fe kalpha line at ~6.4 kev from absorption models in agn. in particularwe show that contrary to a recent claim in the literature, absorption dominatedmodels for the relativistic fe kalpha emission line in mcg -6-30-15 do notover-predict the narrow fe kalpha line for any column density or coveringfactor.

0910.5365	a correlation between the spectral and timing properties of agn	we present the results from a combined study of the average x-ray spectraland timing properties of 14 nearby agn. for 11 of the sources in the sample, weused all the available data from the rxte archive, which were taken until theend of 2006. there are 7795 rxte observations in total for these agn, obtainedover a period of ~7-11 years. we extracted their 3-20 kev spectra and fittedthem with a simple power-law model, modified by the presence of a gaussian line(at 6.4 kev) and cold absorption, when necessary. we used these best-fit slopesto estimate the mean spectral slope for each object, while we used results fromthe literature to estimate the average spectral slope of the three objectswithout archival, monitorin rxte data. our results show that the agn averagespectral slopes are not correlated either with the black hole mass or thecharacteristic frequencies that were detected in the power spectra.they arepositively correlated, though, with the characteristic frequency whennormalised to the sources black hole mass. this is similar to thespectral-timing correlation that has been observed in cyg x-1, but not thesame.the agn spectral-timing correlation can be explained if we assume that theaccretion rate determines both the average spectral slope and thecharacteristic time scales in agn. the spectrum should steepen and thecharacteristic frequency should increase, proportionally, with increasingaccretion rate. we also provide a quantitative expression between spectralslope and accretion rate. thermal comptonisation models are broadly consistentwith our result, but only if the ratio of the soft photons' luminosity to thepower injected to the hot corona is proportionally related to the accretionrate.

0912.0456	spectral variability and reverberation time delays in the suzaku x-ray  spectrum of ngc 4051	long-exposure suzaku x-ray observations of the active galaxy ngc 4051 from2005 and 2008 are analysed, in an attempt to reach a self-consistentunderstanding of the spectral variability on long timescales and at high timeresolution. principal components analysis and a maximum likelihood method ofpower spectrum analysis are used. in common with other type i agn, the spectralvariability is dominated by a varying-normalisation power-law componenttogether with a quasi-steady, hard-spectrum offset component that contains fe katomic features. ngc 4051 displays a strong excess over a power-law at energiesabove 20 kev, some fraction of which also appears to vary with the power-lawcontinuum. the fast-timescale power spectrum has a shape consistent withprevious determinations, but significant differences are found between the lowand high flux states of the source, demonstrating that the power spectrum isnon-stationary. frequency-dependent time lags between the hard and soft bandsof up to 970+/-225s are measured. the existence of the observed lags excludesthe possibility that the hard spectral component originates as reflection fromthe inner accretion disk. we instead show that the frequency- andenergy-dependent time lags may be explained as reverberation, caused byreflection from a thick shell of material with maximum lags of about 10,000s.if the reflecting material surrounds the agn, it extends to a distance about1.5x10^14 cm, 600 gravitational radii, from the illuminating source and theglobal covering factor is c(g) &gt;~ 0.4, confirming suggestions that type i agnhave high covering factors of absorbing and reflecting material. given thespectral and timing similarities with other type i agn, we infer that thisstructure is common in the type i population.

0707.2950	relativistic iron k emission and absorption in the seyfert 1.9 galaxy  mcg-5-23-16	we present the results of the simultaneous deep xmm and chandra observationsof the bright seyfert 1.9 galaxy mcg-5-23-16, which is thought to have one ofthe best known examples of a relativistically broadened iron k-alpha line. thetime averaged spectral analysis shows that the iron k-shell complex is bestmodeled with an unresolved narrow emission component (fwhm &lt; 5000 km/s, ew ~ 60ev) plus a broad component. this latter component has fwhm ~ 44000 km/s and ew~ 50 ev. its profile is well described by an emission line originating from anaccretion disk viewed with an inclination angle ~ 40^\circ and with theemission arising from within a few tens of gravitational radii of the centralblack hole. the time-resolved spectral analysis of the xmm epic-pn spectrumshows that both the narrow and broad components of the fe k emission lineappear to be constant in time within the errors. we detected a narrow sporadicabsorption line at 7.7 kev which appears to be variable on a time-scale of 20ksec. if associated with fe xxvi ly-alpha this absorption is indicative of apossibly variable, high ionization, high velocity outflow. the variability ofthis absorption feature appears to rule out a local (z=0) origin. the analysisof the xmm rgs spectrum reveals that the soft x-ray emission of mcg-5-23-16 islikely dominated by several emission lines superimposed on an unabsorbedscattered power-law continuum. the lack of strong fe l shell emission togetherwith the detection of a strong forbidden line in the o vii triplet isconsistent with a scenario where the soft x-ray emission lines are produced ina plasma photoionized by the nuclear emission.

0912.4946	remarkable spectral variability of pds 456	we report on the highest to date signal-to-noise-ratio x-ray spectrum of theluminous quasar pds 456, as obtained during two xmm-newton orbits in september2007. the present spectrum is considerably different from several previousx-ray spectra recorded for pds 456 since 1998. the ultra-high-velocity outflowseen as recently as february 2007 is not detected in absorption. conversely, asignificant reflection component is detected. the reflection model suggests thereflecting medium may be outflowing at a velocity v/c = -0.06 +/- 0.02. thepresent spectrum is analyzed in the context of the previous ones in an attemptto understand all spectra within the framework of a single model. we examinewhether an outflow with variable partial covering of the x-ray source along theline of sight that also reflects the source from other lines of sight canexplain the dramatic variations in the broad-band spectral curvature of pds456. it is established that absorption plays a major role in shaping thespectrum of other epochs, while the 2007 xmm-newton spectrum is dominated byreflection, and the coverage of the source by the putative outflow is small (&lt;20%).

1002.0082	significant x-ray line emission in the 5-6 kev band of ngc 4051	a suzaku x-ray observation of ngc 4051 taken during 2005 nov reveals lineemission at 5.44 kev in the rest-frame of the galaxy which does not have anobvious origin in known rest-frame atomic transitions. the improvement to thefit statistic when this line is accounted for establishes its reality at &gt;99.9%confidence: we have also verified that the line is detected in the three xisunits independently. comparison between the data and monte carlo simulationsshows that the probability of the line being a statistical fluctuation is p &lt;3.3 x 10^-4. consideration of three independent line detections in suzaku datataken at different epochs yields a probability p&lt; 3 x 10^-11 and thusconclusively demonstrates that it cannot be a statistical fluctuation in thedata. the new line and a strong component of fe ka emission from neutralmaterial are prominent when the source flux is low, during 2005. spectra from2008 show evidence for a line consistent with having the same flux and energyas that observed during 2005, but inconsistent with having a constantequivalent width against the observed continuum. the stability of the line fluxand energy suggests that it may not arise in transient hotspots, as has beensuggested for similar lines in other sources, but could arise from a speciallocation in the reprocessor, such as the inner edge of the accretion disk.alternatively, the line energy may be explained by spallation of fe into cr, asdiscussed in a companion paper.

1002.0544	multi-dimensional modelling of x-ray spectra for agn accretion-disk  outflows ii	highly-ionized fast accretion-disk winds have been suggested as anexplanation for a variety of observed absorption and emission features in thex-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei. simple estimates have suggested thatthese flows may be massive enough to carry away a significant fraction of theaccretion energy and could be involved in creating the link betweensupermassive black holes and their host galaxies. however, testing thesehypotheses, and quantifying the outflow signatures, requires high-qualitytheoretical spectra for comparison with observations. here we describeextensions of our monte carlo radiative transfer code that allow us to generaterealistic theoretical spectra for a much wider variety of disk wind models thanpossible in our previous work. in particular, we have expanded the range ofatomic physics simulated by the code so that l- and m-shell ions can now beincluded. we have also substantially improved our treatment of both ionizationand radiative heating such that we are now able to compute spectra for outflowscontaining far more diverse plasma conditions. we present example calculationsthat illustrate the variety of spectral features predicted by parametrizedoutflow models and demonstrate their applicability to the interpretation ofdata by comparison with observations of the bright quasar pg1211+143. we findthat the major features in the observed 2 - 10 kev spectrum of this object canbe well-reproduced by our spectra, confirming that it likely hosts a massiveoutflow.

0708.1338	the variable x-ray spectrum of markarian 766 - ii. time-resolved  spectroscopy	context: the variable x-ray spectra of agn systematically show steeppower-law high states and hard-spectrum low states. the hard low state haspreviously been found to be a component with only weak variability. the originof this component and the relative importance of effects such as absorption andrelativistic blurring are currently not clear. aims: in a follow-up of previousprincipal components analysis, we aim to determine the relative importance ofscattering and absorption effects on the time-varying x-ray spectrum of thenarrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy mrk~766. methods: time-resolved spectroscopy,slicing xmm and suzaku data down to 25 ks elements, is used to investigatewhether absorption or scattering components dominate the spectral variations inmrk 766.time-resolved spectroscopy confirms that spectral variability in mrk766 can be explained by either of two interpretations of principal componentsanalysis. detailed investigation confirm rapid changes in the relativestrengths of scattered and direct emission or rapid changes in absorbercovering fraction provide good explanations of most of the spectralvariability. however, a strong correlation between the 6.97 kev absorption lineand the primary continuum together with rapid opacity changes show thatvariations in a complex and multi-layered absorber, most likely a disk wind,are the dominant source of spectral variability in mrk 766

1006.1318	evidence for a truncated accretion disc in the low luminosity seyfert  galaxy, ngc 7213?	we present the broad-band 0.6-150 kev suzaku and swift bat spectra of the lowluminosity seyfert galaxy, ngc 7213. the time-averaged continuum emission iswell fitted by a single powerlaw of photon index gamma = 1.75 and fromconsideration of the fermi flux limit we constrain the high energy cutoff to be350 kev &lt; e &lt; 25 mev. line emission from both near-neutral iron k_alpha at 6.39kev and highly ionised iron, from fe_(xxv) and fe_(xxvi), is strongly detectedin the suzaku spectrum, further confirming the results of previous observationswith chandra and xmm-newton. we find the centroid energies for the fe_(xxv) andfe_(xxvi) emission to be 6.60 kev and 6.95 kev respectively, with the latterappearing to be resolved in the suzaku spectrum. we show that the fe_(xxv) andfe_(xxvi) emission can result from a highly photo-ionised plasma of columndensity n_(h) ~ 3 x 10^(23) cm^(-2). a compton reflection component, e.g.,originating from an optically-thick accretion disc or a compton-thick torus,appears either very weak or absent in this agn, subtending &lt; 1 sr to the x-raysource, consistent with previous findings. indeed the absence of either neutralor ionised compton reflection coupled with the lack of any relativistic fe ksignatures in the spectrum suggests that an inner, optically-thick accretiondisc is absent in this source. instead, the accretion disc could be truncatedwith the inner regions perhaps replaced by a compton-thin radiativelyinefficient accretion flow. thus, the fe_(xxv) and fe_(xxvi) emission couldboth originate in ionised material perhaps at the transition region between thehot, inner flow and the cold, truncated accretion disc on the order of 10^(3) -10^(4) gravitational radii from the black hole. the origin for the unresolvedneutral fe k_alpha emission is then likely to be further out, perhapsoriginating in the optical blr or a compton-thin pc-scale torus.

1006.3449	multi-dimensional modelling of x-ray spectra for agn accretion-disk  outflows iii: application to a hydrodynamical simulation	we perform multi-dimensional radiative transfer simulations to computespectra for a hydrodynamical simulation of a line-driven accretion disk windfrom an active galactic nucleus. the synthetic spectra confirm expectationsfrom parameterized models that a disk wind can imprint a wide variety ofspectroscopic signatures including narrow absorption lines, broad emissionlines and a compton hump. the formation of these features is complex withcontributions originating from many of the different structures present in thehydrodynamical simulation. in particular, spectral features are shaped both bygas in a successfully launched outflow and in complex flows where material islifted out of the disk plane but ultimately falls back. we also confirm thatthe strong fe kalpha line can develop a weak, red-skewed line wing as a resultof compton scattering in the outflow. in addition, we demonstrate that x-rayradiation scattered and reprocessed in the flow has a pivotal part in both thespectrum formation and determining the ionization conditions in the wind. wefind that scattered radiation is rather effective in ionizing gas which isshielded from direct irradiation from the central source. this effect likelymakes the successful launching of a massive disk wind somewhat more challengingand should be considered in future wind simulations.

1006.5035	x-ray reverberation in 1h0707-495 revisited	the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707-495 has previously been identified asshowing time lags between flux variations in the soft- (0.3-1 kev) andmedium-energy (1-4 kev) x-ray bands that oscillate between positive andnegative values as a function of the frequency of the mode of variation. herewe measure and analyse the lags also between a harder x-ray band (4-7.5 kev)and the soft and medium bands, using existing xmm-newton data, and demonstratethat the entire spectrum of lags, considering both the full energy range,0.3-7.5 kev, and the full frequency range, 10^-5 &lt; nu &lt; 10^-2 hz, areinconsistent with previous claims of arising as reverberation associated withthe inner accretion disk. instead we demonstrate that a simple reverberationmodel, in which scattering or reflection is present in all x-ray bands,explains the full set of lags without requiring any ad hoc explanation for thetime lag sign changes. the range of time delays required to explain theobserved lags extends up to about 1800 s in the hard band. the results areconsistent with reverberation caused by scattering of x-rays passing through anabsorbing medium whose opacity decreases with increasing energy and thatpartially-covers the source. a high covering factor of absorbing and scatteringcircumnuclear material is inferred.

1010.2750	a multi-wavelength study of the nature of type 1.8/1.9 seyfert galaxies	we focus on determining the underlying physical cause of a seyfert galaxy'sappearance as type a 1.8 or 1.9. are these "intermediate" seyfert types typicalseyfert 1 nuclei with reddened broad-line regions? or are they objects withintrinsically weak continua and broad emission lines? we compare measurementsof the optical reddening of the narrow and broad-line regions with each otherand with the x-ray column derived from xmm-newton 0.5-10 kev spectra todetermine the presence and location of dust in the line of sight. we alsosearched the literature to see if the objects showed evidence for broad-linevariability, and determined if the changes were consistent with a change inreddening or a change in the intrinsic ionizing continuum flux. we find that 10of 19 objects previously classified as seyfert 1.8/1.9s received thisdesignation due to their low continuum flux. in four objects the classificationwas due to blr reddening, either by the torus or dust structures in thevicinity of the nlr; in the remaining five objects there is not sufficientevidence to favor one scenario over the other. these findings imply that, ingeneral, samples of 1.8/1.9s are not suitable for use in studies of the gas anddust in the central torus.

0709.3076	spitzer/irs observations of seyfert 1.8s and 1.9s: a comparison with  seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s	we present spitzer space telescope mid-infrared spectra of 12 seyfert 1.8 and1.9 galaxies over the 5-38 um region. we compare the spectral characteristicsof this sample to those of 58 seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies from the spitzerarchives. an analysis of the spectral shapes, the silicate 10 um feature andthe emission line fluxes have enabled us to characterize the mid-ir propertiesof seyfert 1.8/1.9s. we find that the equivalent widths of the 10 um silicatefeature are generally weak in all seyfert galaxies, as previously reported byseveral studies. the few seyfert galaxies in this sample that show deep 10 umsilicate absorption features are highly inclined and/or merging galaxies. it islikely that these absorption features originate primarily in the dustyinterstellar medium of the host galaxy rather than in a dusty torus on parsecscales close to the central engine. we find that the equivalent width of thepolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) band at 6.2 um correlates strongly withthe 20-30 um spectral index. either of these quantities are good indicators ofthe amount of starburst contribution to the mid-ir spectra. the spectra ofseyfert 1.8 and 1.9s are dominated by these starburst features, similar to mostseyfert 2s. they show strong pah bands and a strong red continuum toward 30 um.the strengths of the high-ionization forbidden narrow emission lines [o iv]25.89 um, [ne iii] 15.56 um and [ne v] 14.32 um relative to [ne ii] 12.81 umare weaker in seyfert 1.8/1.9s and seyfert 2s as compared to seyfert 1s. theweakness of high-ionization lines in seyfert 1.8-1.9s is suggestive ofintrinsically weak active galactic nuclei (agn) continua, and/or stronger starformation activity leading to enhanced [ne ii]. we discuss the implications ofthese observational results in the context of the unified model of agn.

1204.2535	modeling the fe k line profiles in type i agn with a compton-thick disk  wind	we have modeled a small sample of seyfert galaxies that were previouslyidentified as having simple x-ray spectra with little intrinsic absorption. thesources in this sample all contain moderately broad components of fe k-shellemission and are ideal candidates for testing the applicability of acompton-thick accretion-disk wind model to agn emission components. viewingangles through the wind allow the observer to see the absorption signature ofthe gas, whereas face-on viewing angles allow the observer to see the scatteredlight from the wind. we find that the fe k emission line profiles are welldescribed with a model of a compton-thick accretion-disk wind of solarabundances, arising tens to hundred of gravitational radii from the centralblack hole. further, the fits require a neutral component of fe k alphaemission that is too narrow to arise from the inner part of the wind, andlikely comes from a more distant reprocessing region. our study demonstratesthat a compton-thick wind can have a profound effect on the observed x-rayspectrum of an agn, even when the system is not viewed through the flow.

1207.7194	synthetic x-ray spectra for simulations of the dynamics of an accretion  flow irradiated by a quasar	ultraviolet and x-ray observations show evidence of outflowing gas aroundmany active galactic nuclei. some of these outflows may be driven off gasinfalling towards the central black hole. we perform radiative transfercalculations to compute the gas ionization state and x-ray spectra for two- andthree-dimensional (3d) hydrodynamical simulations of this outflow-from-inflowscenario. by comparison with observations, our results can be used to test thetheoretical models and guide future numerical simulations. we predict bothabsorption and emission features, most of which are formed in a polar funnel ofoutflowing gas. this outflow causes strong absorption for observer orientationangles of &lt; 35 degrees. particularly in 3d, the strength of this absorptionvaries significantly for different lines-of-sight owing to the fragmentarystructure of the gas flow. although infalling material occupies a largefraction of the simulation volume, we do not find that it imprints strongabsorption features since the ionization state is very high. thus, an absenceof observed inflow absorption features does not exclude the models. the mainspectroscopic consequence of the infalling gas is a scattered continuumcomponent that partially re-fills the absorption features caused by theoutflowing polar funnel. fluorescence and scattering in the outflow ispredicted to give rise to several emission features for all observerorientations. for the hydrodynamical simulations considered we find bothionization states and column densities for the outflowing gas that are too highto be quantitatively consistent with well-observed x-ray absorption systems.nevertheless, our results are qualitatively encouraging and further explorationof the model parameter space is warranted.

1210.0469	direct measurement of the x-ray time-delay transfer function in active  galactic nuclei	the origin of the observed time lags, in nearby active galactic nuclei (agn),between hard and soft x-ray photons is investigated using new xmm-newton datafor the narrow-line seyfert i galaxy ark 564 and existing data for 1h0707-495and ngc 4051. these agn have highly variable x-ray light curves that containfrequent, high peaks of emission. the averaged light curve of the peaks isdirectly measured from the time series, and it is shown that (i) peaks occur atthe same time, within the measurement uncertainties, at all x-ray energies, and(ii) there exists a substantial tail of excess emission at hard x-ray energies,which is delayed with respect to the time of the main peak, and is particularlyprominent in ark 564. observation (i) rules out that the observed lags arecaused by comptonization time delays and disfavors a simple model ofpropagating fluctuations on the accretion disk. observation (ii) is consistentwith time lags caused by compton-scattering reverberation from material a fewthousand light-seconds from the primary x-ray source. the power spectraldensity and the frequency-dependent phase lags of the peak light curves areconsistent with those of the full time series. there is evidence fornon-stationarity in the ark 564 time series in both the fourier and peaksanalyses. a sharp `negative' lag (variations at hard photon energies lead softphoton energies) observed in ark 564 appears to be generated by the shape ofthe hard-band transfer function and does not arise from soft-band reflection ofx-rays. these results reinforce the evidence for the existence of x-rayreverberation in type i agn, which requires that these agn are significantlyaffected by scattering from circumnuclear material a few tens or hundreds ofgravitational radii in extent.

1210.5949	decoupling absorption and continuum variability in the seyfert 2 ngc  4507	we present the results of the suzaku observation of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc4507. this source is one of the x-ray brightest compton-thin seyfert 2s and acandidate for a variable absorber. suzaku caught ngc 4507 in a highly absorbedstate characterised by a high column density (nh \sim8 x10^23 cm^-2), a strongreflected component (r\sim 1.9) and a high equivalent width fe k alpha emissionline (ew\sim 500 ev). the fe k alpha emission line is unresolved at theresolution of the suzaku ccds (sigma &lt; 30 ev or fwhm &lt; 3000 km s^-1) and mostlikely originates in a distant absorber. the fe k beta emission line is alsoclearly detected and its intensity is marginally higher than the theoreticalvalue for low ionisation fe. a comparison with previous observations performedwith xmm-newton and bepposax reveals that the x-ray spectral curvature changeson a timescale of a few months. we analysed all these historical observations,with standard models as well as with a most recent model for a toroidalreprocessor and found that the main driver of the observed 2-10 kev spectralvariability is a change of the line-of-sight obscuration, varying from\sim4x10^23 cm^-2 to \sim9 x 10^23 cm^-2. the primary continuum is alsovariable, although its photon index does not appear to vary, while the fe kalpha line and reflection component are consistent with being constant acrossthe observations. this suggests the presence of a rather constant reprocessorand that the observed line of sight nh variability is either due to a certaindegree of clumpiness of the putative torus or due to the presence of a secondclumpy absorber.

1211.3403	the global implications of the hard x-ray excess in type 1 agn	recent evidence for a strong 'hard excess' of flux at energies &gt; 20 kev insome suzaku observations of type 1 active galactic nuclei (agn) has motivatedan exploratory study of the phenomenon in the local type 1 agn population. wehave selected all type 1 agn in the swift burst alert telescope (bat) 58-monthcatalog and cross-correlated them with the holdings of the suzaku publicarchive. we find the hard excess phenomenon to be a ubiquitous property of type1 agn. taken together, the spectral hardness and equivalent width of fe k alphaemission are consistent with reprocessing by an ensemble of compton-thickclouds that partially cover the continuum source. in the context of such amodel, ~ 80 % of the sample has a hardness ratio consistent with &gt; 50% coveringof the continuum by low-ionization, compton-thick gas. more detailed study ofthe three hardest x-ray spectra in our sample reveal a sharp fe k absorptionedge at ~ 7 kev in each of them, indicating that blurred reflection is notresponsible for the very hard spectral forms. simple considerations place thedistribution of compton-thick clouds at or within the optical broad lineregion.

1303.4309	the hard x-ray spectrum of ngc 1365: scattered light, not black hole  spin	active galactic nuclei (agn) show excess x-ray emission above 10 kev comparedwith extrapolation of spectra from lower energies. risaliti et al. haverecently attempted to model the hard x-ray excess in the type 1.8 agn ngc 1365,concluding that the hard excess most likely arises from compton-scatteredreflection of x-rays from an inner accretion disk close to the black hole.their analysis disfavored a model in which the hard excess arises from a highcolumn density of circumnuclear gas partially covering a primary x-ray source,despite such components being required in the ngc 1365 data below 10 kev. usinga monte carlo radiative transfer approach, we demonstrate that this conclusionis invalidated by (i) use of slab absorption models, which have unrealistictransmission spectra for partial covering gas, (ii) neglect of the effect ofcompton scattering on transmitted spectra and (iii) inadequate modeling of thespectrum of scattered x-rays. the scattered spectrum is geometry dependent and,for high global covering factors, may dominate above 10 kev. we further showthat, in models of circumnuclear gas, the suppression of the observed hardx-ray flux by reprocessing may be no larger than required by the `lightbending' model invoked for inner disk reflection, and the expected emissionline strengths lie within the observed range. we conclude that thetime-invariant `red wing' in agn x-ray spectra is probably caused by continuumtransmitted through and scattered from circumnuclear gas, not by highlyredshifted line emission, and that measurement of black hole spin is notpossible.

1308.4550	a high resolution view of the warm absorber in the quasar mr2251-178	high resolution x-ray spectroscopy of the warm absorber in the nearby quasar,mr2251-178 (z = 0.06398) is presented. the observations were carried out in2011 using the chandra high energy transmission grating and the xmm-newtonreflection grating spectrometer, with net exposure times of approximately 400ks each. a multitude of absorption lines from c to fe are detected, revealingat least 3 warm absorbing components ranging in ionization parameter fromlog(\xi/erg cm s^-1) = 1-3 and with outflow velocities &lt; 500 km/s. the lowestionization absorber appears to vary between the chandra and xmm-newtonobservations, which implies a radial distance of between 9-17 pc from the blackhole. several broad soft x-ray emission lines are strongly detected, mostnotably from he-like oxygen, with fwhm velocity widths of up to 10000 km/s,consistent with an origin from broad line region (blr) clouds. in addition tothe warm absorber, gas partially covering the line of sight to the quasarappears to be present, of typical column density n_h = 10^23 cm^-2. we suggestthat the partial covering absorber may arise from the same blr cloudsresponsible for the broad soft x-ray emission lines. finally the presence of ahighly ionised outflow in the iron k band from both 2002 and 2011 chandra hetgobservations appears to be confirmed, which has an outflow velocity of -15600\pm 2400 km/s. however a partial covering origin for the iron k absorptioncannot be excluded, resulting from low ionization material with little or nooutflow velocity.

0705.0628	a photoionization model for the soft x-ray spectrum of ngc 4151	we present analysis of archival data from multiple xmm-newton observations ofthe seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4151. spectral data from the rgs instruments revealseveral strong soft x-ray emission lines, chiefly from hydrogen-like andhelium-like oxygen, nitrogen, neon and carbon. radiative recombination continua(rrc) from oxygen and carbon are also detected. our analysis suggests that theemission data are consistent with photoionization. using the cloudyphotoionization code, we found that, while a two-component, high column densitymodel (10e23 cm-2) with low covering factor proved adequate in reproducing alldetected lyman series lines, it proved insufficient in modeling he-liketriplets observed (neon, oxygen, and nitrogen). if resonance line data wereignored, the two-component model was sufficient to match flux fromintercombination and forbidden lines. however, with the inclusion of resonanceline data, he-like triplets could no longer be modeled with only twocomponents. we found that observed oxygen g and r ratios especially wereanomalous in parameter space investigated. we investigated, and were forced todismiss, the possibility that a third purely collisional component could beresponsible for enhanced resonance line contributions. we succeeded in modelingthe observed spectrum with the addition of a third, lower column density(10e20.5 cm-2) component with non-zero microturbulence and high coveringfactor. while sufficient to reproduce observed soft x-ray flux, our model facescertain shortcomings, particularly in a less-than-ideal visual fit to the lineprofile. two of the three emission model components bear similarities tocomponents determined by kraemer et al. (2005) in their study of ngc 4151absorption spectra.

1311.0734	variability of the high velocity outflow in the quasar pds 456	we present a comparison of two suzaku x-ray observations of the nearby(z=0.184), luminous ($l_{bol} \sim 10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$) type i quasar,pds456. a new 125ks suzaku observation in 2011 caught the quasar during aperiod of low x-ray flux and with a hard x-ray spectrum, in contrast to aprevious 190ks suzaku observation in 2007 when the quasar appeared brighter andhad a steep ($\gamma&gt;2$) x-ray spectrum. the 2011 x-ray spectrum contains apronounced trough near 9\,kev in the quasar rest frame, which can be modeledwith blue-shifted iron k-shell absorption, most likely from the he and h-liketransitions of iron. the absorption trough is observed at a similar rest-frameenergy as in the earlier 2007 observation, which appears to confirm theexistence of a persistent high velocity wind in pds 456, at an outflow velocityof $0.25-0.30$c. the spectral variability between 2007 and 2011 can beaccounted for by variations in a partial covering absorber, increasing incovering fraction from the brighter 2007 observation to the hard and faint 2011observation. overall the low flux 2011 observation can be explained if pds 456is observed at relatively low inclination angles through a compton thick wind,originating from the accretion disk, which significantly attenuates the x-rayflux from the quasar.

1402.3509	determining inclinations of active galactic nuclei via their narrow-line  region kinematics - ii. correlation with observed properties	active galactic nuclei (agn) are axisymmetric systems to first order; theirobserved properties are likely strong functions of inclination with respect toour line of sight, yet the specific inclinations of all but a few agn aregenerally unknown. by determining the inclinations and geometries of nearbyseyfert galaxies using the kinematics of their narrow-line regions (nlrs), andcomparing them with observed properties, we find strong correlations betweeninclination and total hydrogen column density, infrared color, and h-betafull-width at half maximum (fwhm). these correlations provide evidence that theorientation of agn with respect to our line of sight affects how we perceivethem, beyond the seyfert type dichotomy. they can also be used to constrain 3dmodels of agn components such as the broad-line region and torus. additionally,we find weak correlations between agn luminosity and several modeled nlrparameters, which suggests that the nlr geometry and kinematics are dependentto some degree on the agn's radiation field.

1402.3700	revealing the location and structure of the accretion disk-wind in  pds456	we present evidence for the rapid variability of the high velocity ironk-shell absorption in the nearby ($z=0.184$) quasar pds456. from a recent longsuzaku observation in 2013 ($\sim1$ms effective duration) we find that the theequivalent width of iron k absorption increases by a factor of $\sim5$ duringthe observation, increasing from $&lt;105$ev within the first 100ks of theobservation, towards a maximum depth of $\sim500$ev near the end. the impliedoutflow velocity of $\sim0.25$c is consistent with that claimed from earlier(2007, 2011) suzaku observations. the absorption varies on time-scales as shortas $\sim1$ week. we show that this variability can be equally well attributedto either (i) an increase in column density, plausibly associated with a clumpytime-variable outflow, or (ii) the decreasing ionization of a smoothhomogeneous outflow which is in photo-ionization equilibrium with the localphoton field. the variability allows a direct measure of absorber location,which is constrained to within $r=200-3500$$\rm{r_{g}}$ of the black hole. evenin the most conservative case the kinetic power of the outflow is $\gtrsim6\%$of the eddington luminosity, with a mass outflow rate in excess of $\sim40\%$of the eddington accretion rate. the wind momentum rate is directly equivalentto the eddington momentum rate which suggests that the flow may have beenaccelerated by continuum-scattering during an episode of eddington-limitedaccretion.

0803.0080	tracing a disk wind in ngc 3516	x-ray spectra of agn often contain signatures indicative of absorption inmultiple layers of gas whose ionization-state and covering fraction may varywith time. it has been unclear to date how much of the observed x-ray spectraland timing behavior in agn can be attributed to variations in absorption,versus variations in the strengths of emission or reflection components.diagnostics of the inner regions of agn cannot be reliably performed until theorigin of observed effects is understood. we investigate the role of the x-rayabsorbers in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3516. time-averaged and flux-selectedspectroscopy is used to examine the behavior of ngc 3516 observed in chandrahetg and xmm data from oct 2006. new h-like and he-like emission and absorptionfeatures discovered in the fe k regime reveal a previously unknown zone ofcircumnuclear gas in ngc 3516 with log xi ~ 4.3 and column density 1e23 cm^-2.a lower-ionization layer with log xi ~2 and of similar column density isconfirmed from previous observations, this layer has a covering fraction around50%, and changes in covering provide a simple explanation of a deep dip in thelight curve that we interpret as an eclipse of the continuum due to passage ofa cloud across the sight line within half a day. these inner zones of absorbinggas are detected to have outflow velocities in the range 1000-2000 km/s, this,and constraints on radial location are consistent with an origin as part of adisk wind in ngc 3516.

0803.1668	fourier-resolved energy spectra of the narrow line seyfert 1 mkn 766	we compute fourier-resolved x-ray spectra of the seyfert 1 markarian 766 tostudy the shape of the variable components contributing to the 0.3-10 kevenergy spectrum and their time-scale dependence. the fractional variabilityspectra peak at 1-3 kev, as in other seyfert 1 galaxies, consistent with eithera constant contribution from a soft excess component below 1 kev and comptonreflection component above 2 kev, or variable warm absorption enhancing thevariability in the 1-3 kev range. the rms spectra, which shows the shape of thevariable components only, is well described by a single power law with anabsorption feature around 0.7 kev, which gives it an apparent soft excess. thisspectral shape can be produced by a power law varying in normalisation,affected by an approximately constant (within each orbit) warm absorber, withparameters similar to those found by turner et al. for the warm-absorber layercovering all spectral components in their scattering scenario. the total softexcess in the average spectrum can therefore be produced by a combination ofconstant warm absorption on the power law plus an additional less variablecomponent. on shorter time-scales, the rms spectrum hardens and this evolutionis well described by a change in power law slope, while the absorptionparameters remain the same. the frequency dependence of the rms spectra can beinterpreted as variability arising from propagating fluctuations through anextended emitting region, whose emitted spectrum is a power law that hardenstowards the centre. this scenario reduces the short time-scale variability oflower energy bands making the variable spectrum harder on shorter time-scalesand at the same time explains the hard lags found in these data by markowitz etal.

0803.2680	an absorption origin for the x-ray spectral variability of mcg-6-30-15	the seyfert i galaxy mcg-6-30-15 shows one of the best examples of a broad"red wing" of emission in its x-ray spectrum at energies 2 &lt; e &lt; 6.4 kev,commonly interpreted as being caused by relativistically-blurred reflectionclose to the event horizon of the black hole. we aim to test an alternativemodel in which absorption creates the observed spectral shape, explains thepuzzling lack of variability of the red wing and reduces the high reflectionalbedo, substantially greater than unity, that is otherwise inferred atenergies e &gt; 20 kev. we compiled all the available long-exposure, high-qualitydata for mcg-6-30-15: 522 ks of chandra hetgs, 282 ks of xmm-newton pn/rgs and253 ks of suzaku xis/pin data. this is the first analysis of this full dataset.we investigated the spectral variability on timescales &gt;20 ks using principalcomponents analysis and fitted spectral models to "flux state" and mean spectraover the energy range 0.5-45 kev (depending on detector). the absorber modelwas based on the zones previously identified in the high-resolution gratingdata. joint fits were carried out to any data that were simultaneous. multipleabsorbing zones covering a wide range of ionisation are required by the gratingdata, including a highly ionised outflowing zone. a variable partial-coveringzone plus absorbed low-ionisation reflection, distant from the source, providesa complete description of the variable x-ray spectrum. a single model fits allthe data. we conclude that these zones are responsible for the red wing, itsapparent lack of variability, the absorption structure around the fe k-alphaline, the soft-band "excess" and the high flux seen in the hard x-ray band. arelativistically-blurred fe line is not required in this model. we suggest thepartial covering zone is a clumpy wind from the accretion disk.

1410.6799	physical conditions in the x-ray emission-line gas in ngc 1068	we present a detailed, photoionization modeling analysis ofxmm-newton/reflection grating spectrometer observations of the seyfert 2 galaxyngc 1068. the spectrum, previously analyzed by kinkhabwala et al. (2002),reveals a myriad of soft-xray emission lines, including those from h- andhe-like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon, and m- and l-shell iron. as notedin the earlier analysis, based on the narrowness of the radiative recombinationcontinua, the electron temperatures in the emission-line gas are consistentwith photoionization, rather than collisional ionization. the strengths of thecarbon and nitrogen emission lines, relative to those of oxygen, suggestunusual elemental abundances, which we attribute to star-formation history ofthe host galaxy. overall, the emission-lines are blue-shifted with respect tosystemic, with radial velocities ~ 160 km/s, similar to that of [o iii] 5007,and thus consistent with the kinematics and orientation of the opticalemission-line gas and, hence, likely part of an agn-driven outflow. we wereable to achieve an acceptable fit to most of the strong emission-lines with atwo-component photoionization model, generated with cloudy. the two componentshave ionization parameters and column densities of logu = -0.05 and 1.22, andlogn(h) = 20.85 and 21.2, and covering factors of 0.35 and 0.84, respectively.the total mass of the x-ray gas is roughly of an order of magnitude greaterthan the mass of ionized gas determined from optical and near-ir spectroscopy,which indicates that it may be the dominant component of the narrow lineregion. furthermore, we suggest that the medium which produces thescattered/polarized optical emission in ngc~1068 possesses similar physicalcharacteristics to those of the more highly-ionized of the x-ray modelcomponents.

1506.00614	the suzaku view of highly-ionised outflows in agn: ii -- location,  energetics and scalings with bolometric luminosity	ongoing studies with xmm-newton have shown that powerful accretion discwinds, as revealed through highly-ionised fe\,k-shell absorption at e&gt;=6.7 kev,are present in a significant fraction of active galactic nuclei (agn) in thelocal universe (tombesi et al. 2010). in gofford et al. (2013) we analysed asample of 51 suzaku-observed agn and independently detected fe k absorption in~40% of the sample, and we measured the properties of the absorbing gas. inthis work we build upon these results to consider the properties of theassociated wind. on average, the fast winds (v_out&gt;0.01c) are located&lt;r&gt;~10^{15-18} cm (typically ~10^{2-4} r_s) from their black hole, their massoutflow rates are of the order &lt;m_out&gt;~0.01-1 msun/yr or ~(0.01-1) m_edd andkinetic power is constrained to &lt;l_k&gt; ~10^{43-45} erg/s, equivalent to~(0.1-10%) l_edd. we find a fundamental correlation between the sourcebolometric luminosity and the wind velocity, with v_out \propto l_bol^{\alpha}and \alpha=0.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ (90% confidence), which indicates that moreluminous agn tend to harbour faster fe k winds. the mass outflow rate m_out,kinetic power l_k and momentum flux p_out of the winds are also consequentlycorrelated with l_bol, such that more massive and more energetic winds arepresent in more luminous agn. we investigate these properties in the frameworkof a continuum-driven wind, showing that the observed relationships are broadlyconsistent with a wind being accelerated by continuum-scattering. we find that,globally, a significant fraction (~85%) of the sample can plausibly exceed thel_k/l_bol~0.5% threshold thought necessary for feedback, while 45% may alsoexceed the less conservative ~5% of l_bol threshold as well. this suggests thatthe winds may be energetically significant for agn--host-galaxy feedbackprocesses.

1511.07107	the global implications of the hard excess ii: analysis of the local  population of radio quiet agn	active galactic nuclei (agn) show evidence for reprocessing gas, outflowingfrom the accreting black hole. the combined effects of absorption andscattering from the circumnuclear material likely explains the `hard excess' ofx-ray emission above 20 kev, compared with extrapolation of spectra from lowerx-ray energies. in a recent {\it suzaku} study, we established the ubiquitoushard excess in hard x-ray-selected, radio-quiet type\,1 agns to be consistentwith reprocessing of the x-ray continuum an ensemble of clouds, located tens tohundreds of gravitational radii from the nuclear black hole. here we add hardx-ray-selected, type\,2 agn to extend our original study and show that thegross x-ray spectral properties of the entire local population of radio quietagn may be described by a simple unified scheme. we find a broad, continuousdistribution of spectral hardness ratio and fe\,k$\alpha$ equivalent widthacross all agn types, which can be reproduced by varying the observer'ssightline through a single, simple model cloud ensemble, provided the radiativetransfer through the model cloud distribution includes not only photoelectricabsorption but also 3d compton scattering. variation in other parameters of thecloud distribution, such as column density or ionisation, should be expectedbetween agn, but such variation is not required to explain the gross x-rayspectral properties.

astro-ph;0002206	on the reddening in x-ray absorbed seyfert 1 galaxies	there are several seyfert galaxies for which there is a discrepancy betweenthe small column of neutral hydrogen deduced from x-ray observations and themuch greater column derived from the reddening of the optical/uv emission linesand continuum. the standard paradigm has the dust within the highly ionized gaswhich produces o~vii and o~viii absorption edges (i.e., a ``dusty warmabsorber''). we present an alternative model in which the dust exists in acomponent of gas in which hydrogen has been stripped, but which is at too lowan ionization state to possess significant columns of o~vii and o~viii (i.e, a``lukewarm absorber''). the lukewarm absorber is at sufficient radial distanceto encompass much of the narrow emission-line region, and thus accounts for thenarrow-line reddening, unlike the dusty warm absorber. we test the model byusing a combination of photoionization models and absorption edge fits toanalyze the combined rosat/asca dataset for the seyfert 1.5 galaxy, ngc 3227.we show that the data are well fit by a combination of the lukewarm absorberand a more highly ionized component similar to that suggested in earlierstudies. we predict that the lukewarm absorber will produce strong uvabsorption lines of n v, c iv, si iv and mg ii. finally, these resultsillustrate that singly ionized helium is an important, and often overlooked,source of opacity in the soft x-ray band (100 - 500 ev).

astro-ph;0209221	sheep: the search for the high energy extragalactic population	we present the sheep survey for serendipitously-detected hard x-ray sourcesin asca gis images. in a survey area of $\sim 40$ deg$^{2}$, 69 sources weredetected in the 5-10 kev band to a limiting flux of $\sim 10^{-13}$ ergcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. the number counts agree with those obtained by the similarbepposax hellas survey, and both are in close agreement with asca and bepposax2-10 kev surveys. spectral analysis of the sheep sample reveals that the 2-10and 5-10 kev surveys do not sample the same populations, however, as we findconsiderably harder spectra, with an average $\gamma\sim1.0$ assuming noabsorption. the implication is that the agreement in the number counts iscoincidental, with the 5-10 kev surveys gaining approximately as many hardsources as they lose soft ones, when compared to the 2-10 kev surveys. this ishard to reconcile with standard agn ``population synthesis'' models for thex-ray background, which posit the existence of a large population of absorbedsources. we find no evidence of the population hardening at faint fluxes, withthe exception that the few very brightest objects are anomalously soft. 53 ofthe sheep sources have been covered by rosat in the pointed phase. of these 32were detected. an additional 3 were detected in the rass. as expected thesources detected with rosat are systematically softer than those detected withasca alone, and of the sample as a whole (truncated).

astro-ph;0309096	the ionized gas and nuclear environment in ngc 3783. iv. variability and  modeling of the 900 ks chandra spectrum	we present a detailed spectral analysis of the data obtained from ngc 3783during the period 2000-2001 using chandra. this analysis leads us to thefollowing results. 1) ngc 3783 fluctuated in luminosity by a factor ~1.5 duringindividual observations (~170 ks duration). these fluctuations were notassociated with significant spectral variations. 2) on a longer time scale(20-120 days), we found the source to exhibit two very different spectralshapes. the main difference between these can be well-described by theappearance and disappearance of a spectral component that dominates theunderlying continuum at the longest wavelengths. the spectral variations arenot related to the brightening or the fading of the continuum at shortwavelengths in any simple way. 3) the appearance of the soft continuumcomponent is consistent with being the only spectral variation, and there is noneed to invoke changes in the opacity of the absorbers. 4) photoionizationmodeling indicates that a combination of three ionized absorbers, each splitinto two kinematic components, can explain the strengths of almost all theabsorption lines and bound-free edges. all three components are thermallystable and seem to have the same gas pressure. 5) the only real discrepancybetween our model and the observations concerns the range of wavelengthsabsorbed by the iron m-shell uta feature. this most likely arises as the resultof our underestimation of the poorly-known dielectronic recombination ratesappropriate for these ions. 6) the lower limit on the distance of the absorbinggas in ngc 3783 is between 0.2 and 3.2 pc. the assumption of pressureequilibrium imposes an upper limit of about 25 pc on the distance of theleast-ionized component from the central source.

(2004). alternatively, the emission from a narrow annulus at the surfaceof the accretion disk is unlikely due to the very small inclination angle (i.e.less than 10 deg) required to explain the narrow, redshifted line in thisintermediate seyfert galaxy. however emission from a small, localized hot-spoton the disk, occurring within a fraction of a complete disk orbit, could alsoexplain the redshifted line. this scenario would be directly testable in alonger observation, as one would see significant variations in the energy andintensity of the line within an orbital timescale.

astro-ph;0507354	simultaneous ultraviolet and x-ray observations of the seyfert galaxy  ngc 4151. i. physical conditions in the x-ray absorbers	we present a detailed analysis of the intrinsic x-ray absorption in theseyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4151 using chandra/hetgs data obtained 2002 may, as partof a program which included simultaneous uv spectra using hst/stis and fuse.ngc 4151 was in a relatively low flux state during the observations reportedhere, although roughly 2.5 times as bright in the 2 --10 kev band as during achandra observation in 2000. the soft x-ray band was dominated by emissionlines, which show no discernible variation in flux between the twoobservations. the 2002 data show the presence of a very highly ionizedabsorber, in the form of h-like and he-like mg, si, and s lines, as well aslower ionization gas via the presence of inner-shell absorption lines fromlower-ionization species of these elements. the former is too highly ionized tobe radiatively accelerated in a sub-eddington source such as ngc 4151. we findthat the lower ionization gas had a column density a factor of ~ 3 higherduring the 2000 observation. if due to bulk motion, we estimate that thiscomponent must have a velocity of more than 1250 km/sec transverse to ourline-of-sight. we suggest that these results are consistent with amagneto-hydrodynamic flow.

astro-ph;0509280	evidence for gravitational infall of matter onto the super-massive black  hole in the quasar pg 1211+143?	we report the detection of redshifted iron k-alpha absorption lines in thechandra letg spectrum of the narrow-line quasar, pg 1211+143. the absorptionlines are observed at 4.22 kev and 4.93 kev in the quasar spectrum,corresponding to 4.56 kev and 5.33 kev in the rest frame of pg 1211+143. frommonte carlo simulations, the chance probability of both lines being falsedetections is low at 1.36e-04. highly redshifted ionized iron k-alpha (fe xxvor fe xxvi) is the most plausible identification for the lines at theirobserved energies. if identified with h-like iron k-alpha at 6.97 kev, then therelativistic velocity shifts required are 0.40c and 0.26c. the extremevelocities can be explained by pure gravitational redshift if the matter existsin a stable orbit within 6 gravitational radii of the black hole. this wouldrequire a kerr metric for the black hole. alternatively the absorption may bethe result of matter infalling directly onto the black hole, with a maximumobserved velocity of 0.38c at 6rg in the schwarzschild metric. this matter mayoriginate in a failed outflow or jet, which does not escape the gravitationalpotential of the black hole.

astro-ph;0610585	an xmm-newton survey of broad iron lines in agn	we report on the iron k-alpha line properties of a sample of seyfert galaxiesobserved with the xmm-newton epic pn instrument. using a systematic and uniformanalysis, we find that complexity at iron-k is extremely common in the xmmspectra. once appropriate soft x-ray absorption, narrow 6.4 kev emission andassociated compton reflection are accounted for, ~75 of the sample show animprovement when a further gaussian component is introduced. the typicalproperties of the broad emission are both qualitatively and quantitativelyconsistent with previous results from asca. the complexity is in general verywell described by relativistic accretion disk models. in most cases thecharacteristic emission radius is constrained to be within ~50 r_g, wherestrong gravitational effects become important. we find in about 1/3 of thesample the accretion disk interpretation is strongly favoured over competingmodels. in a few objects no broad line is apparent. we find evidence foremission within 6 r_g in only two cases, both of which exhibit highly complexabsorption. evidence for black hole spin based on the x-ray spectra thereforeremains tentative.

astro-ph;0611072	the energy-dependent x-ray timing characteristics of the narrow line  seyfert 1 mkn 766	we present the energy-dependent power spectral density (psd) andcross-spectral properties of mkn 766, obtained from combining data obtainedduring an xmm-newton observation spanning six revolutions in 2005 with dataobtained from an xmm-newton long-look in 2001. the psd shapes and rms-fluxrelations are found to be consistent between the 2001 and 2005 observations,suggesting the 2005 observation is simply a low-flux extension of the 2001observation and permitting us to combine the two data sets. the resulting psdhas the highest temporal frequency resolution for any agn psd measured to date.applying a broken power-law model yields break frequencies which increase intemporal frequency with photon energy. obtaining a good fit when assumingenergy-independent break frequencies requires the presence of a lorentzian at4.6+/-0.4 * 10^-4 hz whose strength increases with photon energy, a behaviorseen in black hole x-ray binaries. the cross-spectral properties are measured;temporal frequency-dependent soft-to-hard time lags are detected in this objectfor the first time. cross-spectral results are consistent with those for otheraccreting black hole systems. the results are discussed in the context ofseveral variability models, including those based on inwardly-propagatingviscosity variations in the accretion disk.

astro-ph;0611673	the variable x-ray spectrum of markarian 766 - i. principal components  analysis	aims: we analyse a long xmm-newton spectrum of the narrow-line seyfert 1galaxy mrk 766, using the marked spectral variability on timescales &gt;20ks toseparate components in the x-ray spectrum. methods: principal componentsanalysis is used to identify distinct emission components in the x-rayspectrum, possible alternative physical models for those components are thencompared statistically. results: the source spectral variability iswell-explained by additive variations, with smaller extra contributions mostlikely arising from variable absorption. the principal varying component,eigenvector one, is found to have a steep (photon index 2.4) power-law shape,affected by a low column of ionised absorption that leads to the appearance ofa soft excess. eigenvector one varies by a factor 10 in amplitude ontime-scales of days and appears to have broad ionised fe k-alpha emissionassociated with it: the width of the ionised line is consistent with an originat about 100 gravitational radii. there is also a strong component ofnear-constant emission that dominates in the low state, whose spectrum isextremely hard above 1 kev, with a soft excess at lower energies, and with astrong edge at fe k but remarkably little fe k-alpha emission. although thiscomponent may be explained as relativistically-blurred reflection from theinner accretion disc, we suggest that its spectrum and lack of variability mayalternatively be explained as either (i) ionised reflection from an extendedregion, possibly a disc wind, or (ii) a signature of absorption by a disc windwith a variable covering fraction. absorption features in the low state mayindicate the presence of an outflow.

astro-ph;0612485	an xmm-newton view of the x-ray flat radio-quiet quasar pg 1416-129	(abridged) the radio-quiet quasar pg1416-129 (z=0.129) exhibits atypicaloptical and x-ray properties. between 1990 and 2000, in response to its opticalcontinuum decrease, the ``classical'' broad component of hbeta almostcompletely disappeared, with a factor of 10 decrease in the line flux. in thex-ray band, this object was observed by ginga in 1988 to have the hardestquasar photon index, with gamma=1.1+/-0.1. we present an xmm/epic observationof pg1416-129 performed in july 2004. we analyze the time-averaged pn spectrumof this quasar, as well as perform time-resolved spectroscopy. we find thatduring the present xmm observation, pg1416-129 still has a rather hard photonindex, both in the soft and hard energy ranges, compared to radio-quiet quasarsbut compatible with the photon index value found for radio-loud quasars. thisobject also shows long-term luminosity variability over 16 years by a factor ofthree with a variation of photon index from ~1.2 to ~1.8. in the soft energyband (0.2-2kev), we found a very weak soft x-ray excess compared to other rqquasars. the whole time averaged spectrum is fit very well either by x-rayionized reflection from the accretion disk surface, by a warm absorber-emitterplus power-law, or by a smeared absorption/emission from a relativisticoutflow. while no constant narrow fek line at 6.4kev is observed, we find thepossible presence of two non-simultaneous transient iron lines: a redshiftednarrow iron line at about 5.5kev (96.4% confidence level according tomulti-trial monte-carlo simulations) at the beginning of this observation andthe appearance of a line at 6.3-6.4kev (99.1% c.l.) at the end of theobservation. these variable lines could be generated by discrete hot-spots onthe accretion disk surface.

astro-ph;9603057	asca observations of the composite warm absorber in ngc 3516	we obtained x-ray spectra of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc~3516 in march 1995using asca. simultaneous far-uv observations were obtained with hut on theastro-2 shuttle mission. the asca spectrum shows a lightly absorbed power lawof energy index 0.78. the low energy absorbing column is significantly lessthan previously seen. prominent o~vii and o~viii absorption edges are visible,but, consistent with the much lower total absorbing column, no fe k absorptionedge is detectable. a weak, narrow fe~k$\alpha$ emission line from coldmaterial is present as well as a broad fe~k$\alpha$ line. these features aresimilar to those reported in other seyfert 1 galaxies. a single warm absorbermodel provides only an imperfect description of the low energy absorption. inaddition to a highly ionized absorber with ionization parameter $u = 1.66$ anda total column density of $1.4 \times 10^{22}~\rm cm^{-2}$, adding a lowerionization absorber with $u = 0.32$ and a total column of $6.9 \times10^{21}~\rm cm^{-2}$ significantly improves the fit. the contribution ofresonant line scattering to our warm absorber models limits the dopplerparameter to $&lt; 160~\rm km~s^{-1}$ at 90\% confidence. turbulence at the soundspeed of the photoionized gas provides the best fit. none of the warm absorbermodels fit to the x-ray spectrum can match the observed equivalent widths ofall the uv absorption lines. accounting for the x-ray and uv absorptionsimultaneously requires an absorbing region with a broad range of ionizationparameters and column densities.

astro-ph;9606169	asca observations of seyfert 1 galaxies: ii. relativistic iron k-alpha  emission	we present evidence for widespread relativistic effects in the centralregions of active galactic nuclei. in a sample of 18 seyfert 1 galaxiesobserved by \asca, 14 show an iron k$\alpha$ line which is is resolved, withmean width $\sigma_{\rm k\alpha}=0.43\pm 0.12$~kev for a gaussian profile (fullwidth at half maximum, fwhm$\sim 50,000$~km s$^{-1}$). however, many of theline profiles are asymmetric. a strong red wing is indicative of gravitationalredshifts close to a central black hole and accretion disk models provide anexcellent description of the data. the peak energy of the line is 6.4~kev,indicating that it arises by fluorescence in near-neutral material. our fitsimply a low inclination for the disk in these seyfert 1 galaxies, with a meanof 30\deg, consistent with orientation-dependent unification schemes.differences in the line profiles from source-to-source imply slight variationsin geometry, which cannot be accounted for solely by inclination. in mostcases, we require that the line emission arises from a range of radii. althougha small contribution to the emission from a region other than the disk is notruled out, it is not generally required and has little effect on ourconclusions regarding the disk line. our data are fit equally well withrotating (kerr) and non-rotating (schwarzschild) black hole models. we find amean spectral index in the 3-10 kev range of $&lt;\gamma_{3-10}&gt;=1.91\pm 0.07$after accounting for the effects of reflection. such observations probe theinnermost regions of agn, and arguably provide the best evidence yet obtainedfor the existence of super-massive black holes in the centers of activegalaxies.

astro-ph;9705087	asca observations of type-2 seyfert galaxies: ii. the importance of  x-ray scattering and reflection	we discuss the importance of x-ray scattering and compton reflection intype-2 seyfert galaxies, based upon the analysis of asca observations of 25such sources. consideration of the iron kalpha, [o iii] line and x-rayvariability suggest that ngc 1068, ngc 4945, ngc 2992, mrk 3, mrk 463e and mrk273 are dominated by reprocessed x-rays. we examine the properties of thesesources in more detail.  we find that the iron kalpha complex contains significant contributions fromneutral and high-ionization species of iron. compton reflection, hot gas andstarburst emission all appear to make significant contributions to the observedx-ray spectra.  mrk 3 is the only source in this subsample which does not have a significantstarburst contamination. the asca spectrum below 3 kev is dominated by hotscattering gas with u_x ~ 5, n_h ~ 4 x 10^23 cm^-2. this material is morehighly ionized than the zone of material comprising the warm absorber seen inseyfert~1 galaxies, but may contain a contribution from shock-heated gasassociated with the jet. estimates of the x-ray scattering fraction cover 0.25- 5%. the spectrum above 3 kev appears to be dominated by a compton reflectioncomponent although there is evidence that the primary continuum componentbecomes visible close to 10 kev.

astro-ph;9708046	asca observations of seyfert 1 galaxies: iii. the evidence for  absorption &amp; emission due to photoionized gas	(abridged) we present the results from a detailed analysis of the 0.6 - 10kev spectra of 23 asca observations of 18 objects. we find that in most casesthe underlying continuum can be well-represented by a powerlaw with a photonindex gamma approx 2. however we find strong evidence for photoionized gas inthe line-of-sight to 13/18 objects. we present detailed modelling of this gasbased upon the ion photoionization code. we find the x-ray ionization parameterfor the ionized material is strongly peaked at ux approx 0.1. the columndensities of ionized material are typically in the range n_{h,z} approx10^{21}--10^{23} cm^{-2}, although highly ionized column densities up to10^{24} cm^{-2} cannot be excluded in some cases. we also investigate theimportance of the emission-spectrum from the ionized gas, finding that itsignificantly improves the fit to many sources with an intensity consistentwith material subtending a large solid angle at the central source. a deficitof counts is observed at approx 1 kev in the sources exhibiting the strongestabsorption features. we suggest this is likely to be the signature of a secondzone of (more highly) ionized gas, which might have been seen previously in thedeep fe k-shell edges observed in some ginga observations. we find evidencethat the ionized material in ngc 3227 and mcg-6-30-15 contains embedded dust,whilst there is no such evidence in the other sources

astro-ph;9803051	asca observations of the ionized gas in the seyfert galaxy ngc 3783	we present the results from asca observations of ngc 3783 carried out during1993 and 1996. variability is observed both between the two epochs and withinthe individual observations, the latter due to a non-stationary process.  we find the spectra at both epochs to contain features due to absorption byionized material, predominantly due to ovii and oviii. we find the opacity forsuch material to decrease by a factor approx 2 in the approx 0.7--1.0 kev bandbetween the epochs while the photoionizing flux increases by approx25%. bycomparison with detailed photoionization models we show this behaviour isinconsistent with that expected from a single-zone of photoionized gas. adeficit in the data compared to such models, consistent with excess absorptionby oviii, supports the suggestion that the material consists of two or morezones.  significant fe k-shell emission is also observed during both epochs. we showthis emission is dominated by the asymmetric line profile expected from theinnermost regions of the accretion flow. we find no evidence that the feemission varied in either shape or equivalent width between the two epochs.

astro-ph;9803205	the soft x-ray spectrum of scattering--dominated agn	this paper discusses the properties of scattering--dominated active galacticnuclei (agn). we define these to be agn for which the direct line-of-sight tothe continuum source is obscured by compton-thick material. the aim is toconstruct, for the first time, a model consistent with x-ray line luminosities,line ratios and various luminosity indicators. the asca spectra of six suchsources show several x-ray lines that can be reliably measured, mostly due tohighly ionized magnesium, silicon sulphur and iron. these enable us toinvestigate the physical conditions of the scattering material. the sourcesshow evidence of he-like and h-like iron lines that are likely to be producedin hot (t approx 10^6 k) photoionized gas. by measuring the ew of the lines,and by constructing a diagnostic line-ratio diagram, we demonstrate that thesilicon and magnesium lines are produced by the same gas emitting the highlyionized iron lines. the properties of this gas are rather different from theproperties of warm absorbers in type i agn. neutral 6.4 kev iron lines are alsodetected, originating in a different component which can be either compton-thinor compton-thick. the best measured iron lines suggest an enhancement ofn_{fe}/n_h by a factor approx 2 compared to solar, in both the hot and coolcompton-thin components. we further show that in four of the sources, the fekalpha(6.4kev)/hbeta (lambda 4861ang) line ratio is consistent with thatpredicted for typical narrow line region clouds, and the reddening correctedhbeta is known, provided the column density is larger than approx10^{22.5}/cm^2, alpha_{ox} is smaller than 1.3. for some sources, this is aviable alternative to the commonly assumed compton thick medium as the originof the 6.4 kev iron line.

astro-ph;9804135	new constraints on the continuum-emission mechanism of agn: intensive  monitoring of ngc 7469 in the x-ray and ultraviolet	we have undertaken near-continuous monitoring of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc7469 in the x-ray with rxte over a ~30d baseline. the source shows strongvariability with a root-mean-square (rms) amplitude of ~16 per cent, andpeak-to-peak variations of a factor of order 2. simultaneous data over thisperiod were obtained in the ultraviolet (uv) using iue, making this the mostintensive x-ray uv/x-ray variability campaign performed for any active galaxy.comparison of the continuum light curves reveals very similar amplitudes ofvariability, but different variability characteristics, with the x-rays showingmuch more rapid variations. the data are not strongly correlated at zero lag.the largest absolute value of the correlation coefficient occurs for ananticorrelation between the two bands, with the x-ray variations leading the uvby ~4d. the largest positive correlation is for the ultraviolet to lead thex-rays by ~4d. neither option appears to be compatible with any simpleinterband transfer function. the peak positive correlation at ~4d occursbecause the more prominent peaks in the uv light curve appear to lead those inthe x-rays by this amount. however, the minima of the light curves arenear-simultaneous. these observations provide new constraints on theoreticalmodels of the central regions of active galactic nuclei. models in which theobserved uv emission is produced solely by re-radiation of absorber x-rays areruled out by our data, as are those in which the x-rays are produced solely bycompton upscattering of the observed uv component by a constant distribution ofparticles.

astro-ph;9902161	the effect of intrinsic uv absorbers on the ionizing continuum and  narrow emission line ratios in seyfert galaxies	we explore the effects of uv absorbing material on the shape of the euvcontinuum radiation emitted by the active galactic nucleus, and on the relativestrengths of emission lines, formed in the narrow line regions of seyfertgalaxies, excited by this continuum. within a sample of seyfert 1.5 galaxies,objects with flatter soft x-ray slopes tend to have lower values of he ii4686/h-beta, which implies a correlation between the observed spectral energydistribution of the ionizing continuum and the narrow emission line strengths.objects with the flattest soft x-ray continua tend to possess high columndensity uv absorption and it is plausible that the differences in narrowemission line ratios among these galaxies are an indication of the effects ofabsorbing material internal to the narrow line region, rather than intrinsicdifferences in continuum shape. we have generated a set of photoionizationmodels to examine the effect of a range of uv absorbers on the ionizingcontinuum and, hence, the resulting conditions in a typical narrow line cloud.our results indicate that a low ionization uv absorber with large coveringfactor will indeed produce the combination of narrow line ratios and soft x-rayspectral characteristics observed in several seyfert 1.5 galaxies. our resultsalso suggest that low ionization uv absorption may be more common thancurrently believed.

astro-ph;9907193	the properties of the relativistic iron k-line in ngc 3516	we present an analysis of the relativistic iron k-alpha line in the seyfert 1galaxy ngc 3516, based on a continuous, five-day asca observation. the broadprofile which has been found in several other agn is confirmed in ngc 3516 withunprecedented signal-to-noise ratio. disk-line models with either a kerr orschwarzschild metric fit the integrated profile, but both require emission verystrongly concentrated in the inner disk. we find tentative evidence for theline signatures of ni k-alpha and/or fe k-beta. the continuum flux varied by\~50 per cent during the observation and time-resolved analysis shows that theline also changes. the line core seems to follow the continuum, but the bluewing is unrelated and shows a greater amplitude (factor ~2) of variability. thered wing is formally consistent with a constant but appears to be correlatedwith the blue wing. we interpret this as evidence for independent variabilityof the broadest parts of the line. there also appears to be an absorptionfeature in the profile, consistent with resonance scattering in infallingmaterial. this variable feature may be the signature of material being accretedby the central black hole.

astro-ph;9910216	bepposax observation of ngc 7582: constraints on the x-ray absorber	this paper presents a bepposax observation of ngc 7582 made during 1998november and an optical spectrum taken in 1998 october. the new x-ray datareveal a previously unknown hard x-ray component in ngc 7582, peaking close to20 kev. rapid variability is observed with correlated changes in the 5-10 and13-60 kev bands indicating that a single continuum component, produced by theactive nucleus, provides the dominant flux across both bands. changes in thenuclear x-ray flux appear unrelated to the gradual decline in optical fluxnoted since the high-state in 1998 july. the x-ray continuum is attenuated by athick absorber of n_h ~ 1.6 x 10e24 cm^-2 covering ~60% of the nucleus, plus ascreen with n_h ~ 1.4 x 10e23 cm^-2 covering the entire nucleus. comparison ofthe bepposax and asca spectra shows an increase in the full screen by n_h ~7 x10e22 cm^-2 since 1994, confirming the absorption variability found by xue etal. the increase in soft x-ray flux between 1994 and 1998 is consistent withthe appearance of holes in the full screen producing some clear lines-of-sightto the broad-line-region.

astro-ph;9910218	x-ray observations of optically-selected, radio-quiet quasars i: the  asca results	we present the result of 27 asca observations of 26 radio-quiet quasars(rqqs) from the pg survey. all the rqqs were detected except 2 balqsos. we findthe variability characteristics of the sources to be consistent with seyf-1s. apowerlaw offers an acceptable description of the time-averaged spectra in the2-10 kev (rqq-frame) band for all but 1 dataset. the photon indices vary fromobject to object over the range 1.5~&lt;gamma(2-10 kev)~&lt;3 with a meangamma(2-10kev)~2 and dispersion ~=0.25. the distribution of gamma(2-10 kev istherefore similar to that observed in other rq agn, and seems unrelated tox-ray luminosity. no single model adequately describes the full 0.6-10 kev(obs-frame) continuum of all the rqqs. ~50% of the sources can be described bya single powerlaw (or with only very subtle deviations). all but one of theremaining datasets have convex spectra (flattening to higher energies). theexception is pg 1411+442, in which a substantial column density obscures ~98%of the continuum. we find only 5 (or 6) of 14 objects with z&lt;~0.25 to have a'soft excess' at energies &lt;~1 kev, but find no universal shape for thesespectral components. the spectrum of pg 1244+026 contains an emission featureat ~1 kev. the detection rate of absorption due to ionized material in theserqqs is lower than in seyf-1s. in part, this may be due to selection effects.however, when detected, the absorbers in the rqqs exhibit a similar range ofcolumn density and ionization parameter as seyf-1s. we find evidence of fek-shell emission in at least 8 rqqs. these are all low-luminosity objects, andthe line parameters are consistent with other low-luminosity rq agn. however wefind a trend whereby the profile and strength of the fe k-shell emissionchanges as a function of luminosity.
