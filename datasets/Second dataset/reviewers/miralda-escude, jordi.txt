0910.2712	radiative transfer modeling of lyman alpha emitters. i. statistics of  spectra and luminosity	we combine a cosmological reionization simulation with box size of 100mpc/hon a side and a monte carlo lyman-alpha (lya) radiative transfer code to modellyman alpha emitters (laes) at z~5.7. the model introduces lya radiativetransfer as the single factor for transforming the intrinsic lya emissionproperties into the observed ones. spatial diffusion of lya photons fromradiative transfer results in extended lya emission and only the central partwith high surface brightness can be observed. because of radiative transfer,the appearance of laes depends on density and velocity structures incircumgalactic and intergalactic media as well as the viewing angle, whichleads to a broad distribution of apparent (observed) lya luminosity for a givenintrinsic lya luminosity. radiative transfer also causes frequency diffusion oflya photons. the resultant lya line is asymmetric with a red tail. the peak ofthe lya line shifts towards longer wavelength and the shift is anti-correlatedwith the apparent to intrinsic lya luminosity ratio. the simple radiativetransfer model provides a new framework for studying laes. it is able toexplain an array of observed properties of z~5.7 laes in ouchi et al. (2008),producing lya spectra, morphology, and apparent lya luminosity function (lf)similar to those seen in observation. the broad distribution of apparent lyaluminosity at fixed uv luminosity provides a natural explanation for theobserved uv lf, especially the turnover towards the low luminosity end. themodel also reproduces the observed distribution of lya equivalent width (ew)and explains the deficit of uv bright, high ew sources. because of the broaddistribution of the apparent to intrinsic lya luminosity ratio, the modelpredicts effective duty cycles and lya escape fractions for laes.

1003.4990	radiative transfer modeling of lyman alpha emitters. ii. new effects in  galaxy clustering	we study the clustering properties of z~5.7 lyman-alpha emitters (laes) in acosmological reionization simulation with a full lya radiative transfercalculation. lya radiative transfer substantially modifies the intrinsic lyaemission properties, compared to observed ones, depending on the density andvelocity structure environment around the lya emitting galaxy. thisenvironment-dependent lya selection introduces new features in lae clustering,suppressing (enhancing) the line-of-sight (transverse) density fluctuations andgiving rise to scale-dependent galaxy bias. in real space, the contours of thethree-dimensional two-point correlation function of laes appear to beprominently elongated along the line of sight on large scales, an effect thatis opposite to and much stronger than the linear redshift-space distortioneffect. the projected two-point correlation function is greatly enhanced inamplitude by a factor of up to a few, compared to the case without theenvironment dependent selection effect. the new features in lae clustering canbe understood with a simple, physically motivated model, where lya selectiondepends on matter density, velocity, and their gradients. we discuss theimplications and consequences of the effects on galaxy clustering from lyaselection in interpreting clustering measurements and in constraining cosmologyand reionization from laes.

1010.3017	extended lyman-alpha emission around star-forming galaxies	lyman-alpha (lya) photons that escape the interstellar medium of star-forminggalaxies may be resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen atoms in thecircumgalactic and intergalactic media, thereby increasing the angular extentof the galaxy's lya emission. we present predictions of this extended, lowsurface brightness lya emission based on radiative transfer modeling in acosmological reionization simulation. the extended emission can be detectedfrom stacked narrowband images of lya emitters (laes) or of lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs). its average surface brightness profile has a central cusp,then flattens to an approximate plateau beginning at an inner characteristicscale below ~0.2 mpc (comoving), then steepens again beyond an outercharacteristic scale of ~1 mpc. the inner scale marks the transition fromscattered light of the central source to emission from clustered sources, whilethe outer scale marks the spatial extent of scattered emission from theseclustered sources. both scales tend to increase with halo mass, uv luminosity,and observed lya luminosity. the extended emission predicted by our simulationis already within reach of deep narrowband photometry using large ground-basedtelescopes. such observations would test radiative transfer models of emissionfrom laes and lbgs, and they would open a new window on the circumgalacticenvironment of high-redshift star-forming galaxies.

1101.1529	sdss-iii: massive spectroscopic surveys of the distant universe, the  milky way galaxy, and extra-solar planetary systems	building on the legacy of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss-i and ii),sdss-iii is a program of four spectroscopic surveys on three scientific themes:dark energy and cosmological parameters, the history and structure of the milkyway, and the population of giant planets around other stars. in keeping withsdss tradition, sdss-iii will provide regular public releases of all its data,beginning with sdss dr8 (which occurred in jan 2011). this paper presents anoverview of the four sdss-iii surveys. boss will measure redshifts of 1.5million massive galaxies and lya forest spectra of 150,000 quasars, using thebao feature of large scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations ofthe distance scale and hubble expansion rate at z&lt;0.7 and at z~2.5. segue-2,which is now completed, measured medium-resolution (r=1800) optical spectra of118,000 stars in a variety of target categories, probing chemical evolution,stellar kinematics and substructure, and the mass profile of the dark matterhalo from the solar neighborhood to distances of 100 kpc. apogee will obtainhigh-resolution (r~30,000), high signal-to-noise (s/n&gt;100 per resolutionelement), h-band (1.51-1.70 micron) spectra of 10^5 evolved, late-type stars,measuring separate abundances for ~15 elements per star and creating the firsthigh-precision spectroscopic survey of all galactic stellar populations (bulge,bar, disks, halo) with a uniform set of stellar tracers and spectraldiagnostics. marvels will monitor radial velocities of more than 8000 fgk starswith the sensitivity and cadence (10-40 m/s, ~24 visits per star) needed todetect giant planets with periods up to two years, providing an unprecedenteddata set for understanding the formation and dynamical evolution of giantplanet systems.

1105.0606	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: quasar target  selection for data release nine	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), a five-yearspectroscopic survey of 10,000 deg^2, achieved first light in late 2009. one ofthe key goals of boss is to measure the signature of baryon acousticoscillations in the distribution of ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of asample of ~150,000 z&gt;2.2 quasars. along with measuring the angular diameterdistance at z\approx2.5, boss will provide the first direct measurement of theexpansion rate of the universe at z &gt; 2. one of the biggest challenges inachieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. during the first yearof the boss survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and testedto meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in thisredshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. to achieve these surface densities,the magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g &lt;= 22.0 or r&lt;=21.85.while detection of the bao signature in the ly-alpha absorption in quasarspectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysicalstudies do. we therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targetsdeg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%. this "core"subsample will be fixed for years two through five of the survey. in this paperwe describe the evolution and implementation of the boss quasar targetselection algorithms during the first two years of boss operations. we analyzethe spectra obtained during the first year. 11,263 new z&gt;2.2 quasars werespectroscopically confirmed by boss. our current algorithms select an averageof 15 z &gt; 2.2 quasars deg^-2 from 40 targets deg^-2 using single-epoch sdssimaging. multi-epoch optical data and data at other wavelengths can furtherimprove the efficiency and completeness of boss quasar target selection.[abridged]

1202.5496	a star disrupted by a stellar black hole as the origin of the cloud  falling toward the galactic center	we propose that the cloud moving on a highly eccentric orbit near the centralblack hole in our galaxy, reported by gillessen et al., is formed by aphotoevaporation wind originating in a disk around a star that is tidallyperturbed and shocked at every peribothron passage. the disk is proposed tohave formed when a stellar black hole flew by the star, tidally disrupted itsenvelope, and placed the star on its present orbit with some of the tidaldebris forming a disk. a disrupting encounter at the location of the observedcloud is most likely to be caused by a stellar black hole because of theexpected dynamical mass segregation; the rate of these disk-forming encountersmay be as high as $\sim 10^{-6}$ per year. the star should also be spun up bythe encounter, so the disk may subsequently expand by absorbing angularmomentum from the star. once the disk expands up to the tidal truncationradius, the tidal perturbation of the outer disk edge at every peribothron mayplace gas streams on larger orbits which can give rise to a photoevaporationwind that forms the cloud at every orbit. this model predicts that, after thecloud is disrupted at the next peribothron passage in 2013, a smallerunresolved cloud will gradually grow around the star on the same present orbit.an increased infrared luminosity from the disk may also be detectable when theperibothron is reached. we also note that this model revives the encountertheory for planet formation.

1203.5306	the clustering of intermediate redshift quasars as measured by the  baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey	we measure the quasar two-point correlation function over the redshift range2.2&lt;z&lt;2.8 using data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey. we use ahomogeneous subset of the data consisting of 27,129 quasars with spectroscopicredshifts---by far the largest such sample used for clustering measurements atthese redshifts to date. the sample covers 3,600 square degrees, correspondingto a comoving volume of 9.7(gpc/h)^3 assuming a fiducial lambdacdm cosmology,and it has a median absolute i-band magnitude of -26, k-corrected to z=2. afteraccounting for redshift errors we find that the redshift space correlationfunction is fit well by a power-law of slope -2 and amplitude s_0=(9.7\pm0.5)mpc/h over the range 3&lt;s&lt;25mpc/h. the projected correlation function, whichintegrates out the effects of peculiar velocities and redshift errors, is fitwell by a power-law of slope -1 and r_0=(8.4\pm 0.6)mpc/h over the range4&lt;r&lt;16mpc/h. there is no evidence for strong luminosity or redshift dependenceto the clustering amplitude, in part because of the limited dynamic range inour sample. our results are consistent with, but more precise than, previousmeasurements at similar redshifts. our measurement of the quasar clusteringamplitude implies a bias factor of b~3.5 for our quasar sample. we compare thedata to models to constrain the manner in which quasars occupy dark matterhalos at z~2.4 and infer that such quasars inhabit halos with a characteristicmass of &lt;m&gt;~10^{12}msun/h with a duty cycle for the quasar activity of 1 percent.

1211.5146	the boss lyman-alpha forest sample from sdss data release 9	we present the boss lyman-alpha (lya) forest sample from sdss data release 9,comprising 54,468 quasar spectra with zqso &gt; 2.15 suitable for lya forestanalysis. this data set probes the intergalactic medium with absorptionredshifts 2.0 &lt; z_alpha &lt; 5.7 over an area of 3275 square degrees, andencompasses an approximate comoving volume of 20 h^-3 gpc^3. with eachspectrum, we have included several products designed to aid in lya forestanalysis: improved sky masks that flag pixels where data may be unreliable,corrections for known biases in the pipeline estimated noise, masks for thecores of damped lya systems and corrections for their wings, and estimates ofthe unabsorbed continua so that the observed flux can be converted to afractional transmission. the continua are derived using a principal componentfit to the quasar spectrum redwards of restframe lya (lambda &gt; 1216 ang),extrapolated into the forest region and normalized by a linear function to fitthe expected evolution of the lya forest mean-flux. the estimated continuumerrors are ~5% rms. we also discuss possible systematics arising from uncertainspectrophotometry and artifacts in the flux calibration; global corrections forthe latter are provided. our sample provides a convenient starting point forusers to analyze clustering in boss lya forest data, and it provides a fiducialdata set that can be used to compare results from different analyses of baryonacoustic oscillations in the lya forest. the full data set is available fromthe sdss-iii dr9 web site.

astro-ph;0002050	a test of the collisional dark matter hypothesis from cluster lensing	spergel &amp; steinhardt proposed the possibility that the dark matter particlesare self-interacting, as a solution to two discrepancies between thepredictions of cold dark matter models and the observations: first, theobserved dark matter distribution in some dwarf galaxies has large,constant-density cores, as opposed to the predicted central cusps; and second,small satellites of normal galaxies are much less abundant than predicted. thedark matter self-interaction would produce isothermal cores in halos, and wouldalso expel the dark matter particles from dwarfs orbiting within large halos.however, another inevitable consequence of the model is that halos shouldbecome spherical once most particles have interacted. here, i rule out thismodel by the fact that the innermost regions of dark matter halos in massiveclusters of galaxies are elliptical, as shown by gravitational lensing andother observations. the absence of collisions in the lensing cores of massiveclusters implies that any dark matter self-interaction is too weak to haveaffected the observed density profiles in the dark-matter dominated dwarfgalaxies, or to have eased the destruction of dwarf satellites in galactichalos. if $s_x$ is the cross section and $m_x$ the mass of the dark matterparticle, then $s_x/m_x &lt; 10^{-25.5} \cm^2/\gev$.

astro-ph;0003269	a cluster of black holes at the galactic center	if the stellar population of the bulge contains black holes formed in thefinal core collapse of ordinary stars with m \ga 30 m_{\odot}, then about25,000 stellar mass black holes should have migrated by dynamical friction intothe central parsec of the milky way, forming a black hole cluster around thecentral supermassive black hole. these black holes can be captured by thecentral black hole when they randomly reach a highly eccentric orbit due torelaxation, either by direct capture (when their newtonian peribothron is lessthan 4 schwarzschild radii), or after losing orbital energy throughgravitational waves. the overall depletion timescale is ~ 30 gyr, so most ofthe 25,000 black holes remain in the central cluster today. the presence ofthis black hole cluster would have several observable consequences. first, thelow-mass, old stellar population should have been expelled from the regionoccupied by the black hole cluster due to relaxation, implying a core in theprofile of solar-mass red giants with a radius of ~ 2 pc (i.e., 1'). theobserved central density cusp (which has a core radius of only a few arcseconds) should be composed primarily of young (\la 1 gyr) stars. second,flares from stars being captured by supermassive black holes in other galaxiesshould be rarer than usually expected because the older stars will have beenexpelled from the central regions by the black hole clusters of those galaxies.third, the young (\la 2 gyr) stars found at distances ~ 3 - 10 pc from thegalactic center should be preferentially on highly eccentric orbits. fourth, iffuture high-resolution $k$-band images reveal sources microlensed by the milkyway's central black hole, then the cluster black holes could give rise tosecondary (``planet-like'') perturbations on the main event.

astro-ph;0005553	a measurement of the temperature-density relation in the intergalactic  medium using a new lyman-alpha absorption line fitting method	the evolution of the temperature in the intergalactic medium is related tothe reionization of hydrogen and helium, and has important consequences for ourunderstanding of the lya forest and of galaxy formation in gravitational modelsof large-scale structure. we measure the temperature-density relation ofintergalactic gas from lya forest observations of eight quasar spectra withhigh resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, using a new line fitting techniqueto obtain a lower cutoff of the distribution of line widths from which thetemperature is derived. we carefully test the accuracy of this technique torecover the gas temperature with a hydrodynamic simulation. the temperature atredshift z=(3.9, 3.0, 2.4) is best determined at densities slightly above themean: t_star=(20200\pm2700, 20200\pm1300, 22600\pm1900)k (statistical errorbars) for gas density (in units of the mean density) delta_star=(1.42\pm0.08,1.37\pm0.11, 1.66\pm0.11). the power-law index of the temperature-densityrelation, defined by t=t_star(delta/delta_star)^{gamma-1}, is gamma-1=(0.43\pm0.45, 0.29\pm0.30, 0.52\pm0.14) for the same three redshifts. thetemperature at the fixed over-density delta=1.4 is t_1.4=(20100\pm2800,20300\pm1400, 20700\pm1900)k. these temperatures are higher than expected forphotoionized gas in ionization equilibrium with a cosmic background, and can beexplained by a gradual additional heating due to on-going heii reionization.the measurement of the temperature reduces one source of uncertainty in thelower limit to the baryon density implied by the observed mean flux decrement.we find that the temperature cannot be reliably measured for under-dense gas,because the velocities due to expansion always dominate the widths of thecorresponding weak lines.

astro-ph;0104034	orbital perturbations on transiting planets: a possible method to  measure stellar quadrupoles and to detect earth-mass planets	the recent discovery of a planetary transit in the star hd 209458, and thesubsequent highly precise observation of the transit lightcurve with hubblespace telescope, is encouraging to search for any phenomena that might inducesmall changes in the light curve. here we consider the effect of the quadrupolemoment of the parent star and of a possible second planet perturbing the orbitof the transiting planet. both of these cause a precession of the orbital planeand of the periastron of the planet, which result in a long-term variation ofthe duration and the period of the transits. for a transiting planet at 0.05au, either a quadrupole moment similar to that of the sun or the gravitationaltug from an earth-like planet on an orbit of semimajor axis ~ 0.2 au and arelative inclination near the optimal 45 degrees would cause a transit durationtime derivative of ~ 1 second per year.

astro-ph;0106424	self-absorption of ionizing radiation and extended lyman alpha emission  in high- redshift qsos	we calculate the neutral hydrogen column density of self-absorption in qsospredicted in a model where the qsos are located in the same halos that containthe gas in damped lya absorption systems. the model is parameterized by theprobability p_0 that any halo has an active qso. we assume that the qsos ionizethe gas, but do not expel or heat it. the derived hi column densities producenegligible lyman limit absorption, even in the lowest luminosity qsos, with anoptical depth of only ~ 10% for luminosity l=0.01 l_*, when p_0=10^{-2}. wealso compute the heii lyman limit self-absorption, which is slightly higher butstill negligible. the self-absorption can be higher if the gas is highlyclumped; only in this case the overall emissivity from qsos could besignificantly reduced due to absorption by the known damped lya systems, toaffect the predicted intensity of the ionizing background or the epoch of heiireionization. the presence of the gas associated with damped absorption systemsaround qsos could also be detected from the narrow lya emission line, whichshould have and angular extent of 0.1 to 1'' in typical high-redshift qsos.

astro-ph;0201275	self-shielding effects on the column density distribution of damped  lyman alpha systems	we calculate the column density distribution of damped lyman alpha systems,modeled as spherical isothermal gaseous halos ionized by the external cosmicbackground. the effects of self-shielding introduce a hump in thisdistribution, at a column density n_{hi} \sim 1.6x10^{17} x^{-1} cm^{-2}, wherex is the neutral fraction at the radius where self-shielding starts beingimportant. the most recent compilation of the column density distribution bystorrie-lombardi &amp; wolfe shows marginal evidence for the detection of thisfeature due to self-shielding, suggesting a value x \sim 10^{-3}. assuming aphotoionization rate \gamma \sim 10^{-12} s^{-1} from the external ionizingbackground, the radius where self-shielding occurs is inferred to be about3.8kpc. if damped lyman alpha systems consist of a clumpy medium, this shouldbe interpreted as the typical size of the gas clumps in the region where theybecome self-shielding. clumps of this size with typical column densities n_h\sim 3x10^{20} cm^{-2} would be in hydrostatic equilibrium at thecharacteristic photoionization temperature \sim 10^4 k if they do not containdark matter. since this size is similar to the overall radius of damped \lyasystems in cold dark matter models, where all halos are assumed to containsimilar gas clouds producing damped absorbers, this suggests that the gas indamped absorbers is in fact not highly clumped.

astro-ph;0203287	monte carlo simulation of lyman alpha scattering and application to  damped lyman alpha systems	a monte carlo code to solve the transfer of lyman alpha (lya) photons isdeveloped, which can predict the lya image and two-dimensional lya spectra of ahydrogen cloud with any given geometry, lya emissivity, neutral hydrogendensity distribution, and bulk velocity field. we apply the code to severalsimple cases of a uniform cloud to show how the lya image and emitted linespectrum are affected by the column density, internal velocity gradients, andemissivity distribution. we then apply the code to two models for damped lyaabsorption systems: a spherical, static, isothermal cloud, and a flattened,axially symmetric, rotating cloud. if the emission is due to fluorescence ofthe external background radiation, the lya image should have a corecorresponding to the region where hydrogen is self-shielded. the emission lineprofile has the characteristic double peak with a deep central trough. we showhow rotation of the cloud causes the two peaks to shift in wavelength as theslit is perpendicular to the rotation axis, and how the relative amplitude ofthe two peaks is changed. in reality, damped lya systems are likely to have aclumpy gas distribution with turbulent velocity fields, which should smooth theline emission profile, but should still leave the rotation signature of thewavelength shift across the system.

astro-ph;0211071	on the evolution of the ionizing emissivity of galaxies and quasars  required by the hydrogen reionization	the average rate of emission of ionizing radiation per unit volume (oremissivity) in the universe can be calculated as the ratio of the intensity ofthe ionizing background to the mean free path of ionizing photons. theintensity of the background is measured from the mean transmitted flux of thelya forest, and the mean free path is measured from the abundance of lymanlimit systems, which has been observed so far up to z=4. this yields anemissivity that is not larger than 7 ionizing photons per hubble time for eachatom in the universe at z=4, which may reasonably arise from qsos andstar-forming galaxies. in order for the reionization to end by z=6, andassuming that the clumping factor of ionized gas during the reionization epochis close to unity, this ionizing emissivity cannot decline from z=4 up to z ~ 9by more than a factor 1.5. if the clumping factor were much larger than unity,then the emissivity would need to rapidly increase with redshift. unless theionizing emissivity increases substantially from z=4 to z ~ 10 - 20, thethomson optical depth to the cmb must be in the range 0.045 &lt; tau &lt; 0.09.

astro-ph;0303395	the spin-kinetic temperature coupling and the heating rate due to lyman  alpha scattering before reionization: predictions for 21cm emission and  absorption	we investigate the interaction of lyman alpha photons produced by the firststars in the universe with the intergalactic medium (igm) prior toreionization. the background lyman alpha spectral profile is obtained bysolving a fokker-planck equation. accurate values of the heating and scatteringrates, and the spin-kinetic temperature coupling coefficient, are presented. weshow that the heating rate induced by the lyman alpha scatterings is much lowerthan found previously, and is basically negligible. the dominant heating sourceis most likely the x-rays from the first ionizing sources, which are able topenetrate into the atomic medium. the scattering of lyman alpha photons couplesthe hydrogen spin temperature to the kinetic temperature. if the first ionizingsources in the universe did not emit significant x-rays, the spin temperaturewould be rapidly brought down to the very low gas kinetic temperature, and a21cm absorption signal against the cmb larger than 100 mk would be predicted.however, we argue that sufficient x-rays are likely to have been emitted by thefirst stellar population, implying that the gas kinetic temperature shouldrapidly increase, turning a reduced and brief absorption signal into emission,with a smaller amplitude of about 10 mk. the detection of the 21cm absorptionand emission feature would be a hallmark in unravelling the history of the``dark age'' before reionization.

astro-ph;0307184	history of hydrogen reionization in the cold dark matter model	we calculate the reionization history in cold dark matter (cdm) models. theepoch of the end of reionization and the thomson scattering optical depth tothe cosmic microwave background depend on the power spectrum amplitude on smallscales and on the ionizing photon emissivity per unit mass in collapsed halos.we calibrate the emissivity to reproduce the measured ionizing backgroundintensity at z=4. models in which all cdm halos have either a constantemissivity or a constant energy emitted per hubble time, per unit mass, predictthat reionization ends near z~6 and the optical depth is in the range 0.05 &lt;tau_e &lt; 0.09, consistent with wmap results at the 1 to 2 sigma level. if theoptical depth is as high as 0.17 (as suggested by wmap), halos of velocitydispersion ~ 3-30 km/s at z&gt;15 must have ionizing emissivities per unit masslarger by a factor &gt;~ 50 compared to the more massive halos that produce theionizing emissivity at z=4. this factor increases to 100 if the cdm powerspectrum amplitude is required to agree with the croft et al. (2002)measurement from the lyman alpha forest. if tau_e &gt;~ 0.17 were confirmed, ahigher ionizing emissivity at z&gt;15 compared to z=4 might arise from an enhancedstar formation rate or quasar abundance per unit mass and an increased escapefraction for ionizing photons; the end of reionization could have been delayedto z~6 because of the suppression of gas accretion and star formation inlow-mass halos as the medium was reionized.

astro-ph;0307563	the transverse proximity effect: a probe to the environment, anisotropy,  and megayear variability of qsos	the transverse proximity effect is the expected decrease in the strength ofthe lya forest absorption in a qso spectrum when another qso lying close to theline of sight enhances the photoionization rate above that due to the averagecosmic ionizing background. we select three qsos from the early data release ofthe sloan digital sky survey that have nearby foreground qsos, with proper lineof sight tangential separations of 0.50, 0.82, and 1.10 h^{-1} mpc. we estimatethat the ionizing flux from the foreground qso should increase thephotoionization rate by a factor (94, 13, 13) in these three cases, which wouldbe clearly detectable in the first qso and marginally so in the other two. wedo not detect the transverse proximity effect. three possible explanations areprovided: an increase of the gas density in the vicinity of qsos, timevariability, and anisotropy of the qso emission. we find that the increase ofgas density near qsos can be important if they are located in the most massivehalos present at high redshift, but is not enough to fully explain the absenceof the transverse proximity effect. anisotropy requires an unrealisticallysmall opening angle of the qso emission. variability demands that theluminosity of the qso with the largest predicted effect was much lower 10^6years ago, whereas the transverse proximity effect observed in the heii lyaabsorption in qso 0302-003 by jakobsen et al.

astro-ph;0310717	star captures by quasar accretion disks: a possible explanation of the  m-sigma relation	a new theory of quasars is presented in which the matter of thin accretiondisks around black holes is supplied by stars that plunge through the disk.stars in the central part of the host galaxy are randomly perturbed to highlyradial orbits, and as they repeatedly cross the disk they lose orbital energyby drag, eventually merging into the disk. requiring the rate of stellar masscapture to equal the mass accretion rate into the black hole, a relationbetween the black hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion is predicted ofthe form m_{bh} \propto sigma_*^{30/7}. the normalization depends on variousuncertain parameters such as the disk viscosity, but is consistent withobservation for reasonable assumptions. we show that a seed central black holein a newly formed stellar system can grow at the eddington rate up to thispredicted mass via stellar captures by the accretion disk. once this mass isreached, star captures are insufficient to maintain an eddington accretionrate, and the quasar may naturally turn off as the accretion switches to alow-efficiency advection mode. the model provides a mechanism to deliver massto the accretion disk at small radius, probably solving the problem ofgravitational instability to star formation in the disk at large radius. wenote that the matter from stars that is incorporated to the disk has an averagespecific angular momentum that is very small or opposite to that of the disk,and discuss how a rotating disk may be maintained as it captures this matter ifa small fraction of the accreted mass comes from stellar winds that form a diskextending to larger radius. we propose several observational tests andconsequences of this theory.

astro-ph;0406217	formation of the black holes in the highest redshift quasars	the recent discovery of luminous quasars up to a redshift z=6.43 has renewedinterest in the formation of black holes massive enough to power quasars. ifblack holes grow by eddington-limited gas accretion with a radiative efficiencyof at least 10%, the time required to grow from a stellar black hole to ~10^9msun is ~10^9 years, close to the age of the universe at z=6. black holemergers may accelerate the rate of mass growth, but can also completely ejectblack holes from halo centers owing to the gravitational wave recoil effect.recently, haiman concluded that black hole ejections likely do not allow blackholes to grow to ~10^9 msun by z=6.43. we reexamine this problem and show that,by using a different halo escape velocity, accounting for the dependence of therecoil velocity on the black hole binary mass ratio and spins, and allowingseed black holes to form in all halos down to virial temperatures of 2000 k,black hole masses may reach ~10^9 msun as early as z=9 starting from stellarseeds, without super-eddington accretion. in this particular case, we find thatthese massive black holes form from the merger of ~10^4 stellar black holesformed in low-mass halos at z~20, which must all grow close to the maximumeddington rate over most of the time available from their birth to z~6. thealternative is that black holes can grow more rapidly by super-eddingtonaccretion.

astro-ph;0410315	on the importance of local sources of radiation in cosmological  absorption systems	an upper limit to the importance of local sources of radiation compared tothe cosmic background in cosmological absorption systems is derived, as asimple consequence of the conservation of surface brightness. the limit dependsonly on the rate of incidence of the absorbers and the mean free path of theradiation. it is found that, on average, the ionizing radiation intensity fromlocal sources in lyman limit systems at z&gt;2 must be less than half of theintensity of the cosmic background. in absorbers with column densities muchlower than lyman limit systems, the local source contribution must benegligible. the limit on the ratio of local source to background intensities isthen applied to the class of damped lya absorption systems with detectableexcited cii lines. a cooling rate of the gas in these systems has been measuredby wolfe et al., who assumed that the balancing heating source is photoelectricheating on dust by light at ~ 1500 a . the intensity from local star formationat this wavelength in this class of damped lya systems is found to be at most ~3 times the background intensity. if the heating source is indeed photoelectricheating of dust, the background created by sources associated with damped lyasystems can then be estimated from the average cooling rates measured in theabsorbers. current results yield a background intensity higher than previousestimates based on observed galaxy and quasar luminosity functions, althoughwith a large uncertainty. the possibility of other sources of heating, such asshock-heating in a turbulent medium, should be explored.

astro-ph;0503674	galactic wind effects on the lyman-alpha absorption in the vicinity of  galaxies	we present predictions of ly-alpha forest-galaxy correlations at z=3 fromeulerian simulations that include the effects of galactic winds, drivenprimarily by supernova explosions. galactic winds produce expanding bubbles ofshock-heated gas within ~0.5 comoving mpc/h of luminous galaxies in thesimulation, which have space density similar to that of observed lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs). however, most of the low-density intergalactic gas thatdetermines the observed properties of the ly-alpha forest is unaffected bywinds. the impact of winds on the ly-alpha optical depth near galaxies is lessdramatic than their impact on gas temperature because winds heat only a smallfraction of the gas present in the turnaround regions surrounding galaxies.hence, ly-alpha absorption from gas outside the wind bubbles is spread out overthe same velocity range occupied by the wind-heated gas. in general, ly-alphaabsorption is expected to be stronger than average near galaxies because of thehigh gas density. winds result in a modest reduction of this expected increaseof ly-alpha absorption. our predictions can be compared to future observationsto detect the wind effects and infer their strength, although with the caveatthat the results are still dependent on the correspondence of simulatedgalaxies and observed lbgs. we find that wind effects in our simulations arenot strong enough to reproduce the high ly-alpha transmission within 0.5 mpc/hcomoving of galaxies that has been suggested by recent observations; powerfulgalactic explosions or ejecta with hyper-escape velocities would be required,but these are unlikely to be produced by ordinary star formation and supernovaealone

astro-ph;0511489	the maximum contribution to reionization from metal-free stars	we estimate the maximum contribution to reionization from the firstgeneration of massive stars, with zero metallicity, under the assumption thatone of these stars forms with a fixed mass in every collapsed halo in whichmetal-free gas is able to cool. we assume that any halo that has already hadstars previously formed in one of their halo progenitors will form only starswith metals, which are assigned an emissivity of ionizing radiation equal tothat determined at z=4 from the measured intensity of the ionizing background.we examine the impact of molecular hydrogen photodissociation (which tends toreduce cooling when a photodissociating background is produced by the firststars) and x-ray photoheating (which heats the atomic medium, raising theentropy of the gas before it collapses into halos). we find that in thecdm$\lambda$ model supported by present observations, and even assuming nonegative feedbacks for the formation of metal-free stars, a reionized massfraction of 50% is not reached until redshift $z\sim 12$. the combination ofordinary metal-enriched stars and early metal-free stars can yield a cmboptical depth to electron scattering of at most 0.13. the contribution ofmetal-free stars to the present cosmic infrarred background is negligiblysmall.

astro-ph;0605439	the 21cm signature of the first stars	we predict the 21-cm signature of the first metal-free stars. the soft x-raysemitted by these stars penetrate the atomic medium around their host halos,generating lyman alpha photons that couple the spin and kinetic temperatures.these creates a region we call the lyman alpha sphere, visible in 21-cm againstthe cmb, which is much larger than the hii region produced by the same star.the spin and kinetic temperatures are strongly coupled before the x-rays cansubstantially heat the medium, implying that a strong 21-cm absorption signalfrom the adiabatically cooled gas in hubble expansion around the star isexpected when the medium has not been heated previously. a central region ofemission from the gas heated by the soft x-rays is also present although with aweaker signal than the absorption. the lyman alpha sphere is a universalsignature that should be observed around any first star illuminating itsvicinity for the first time. the 21-cm radial profile of the lyman alpha spherecan be calculated as a function of the luminosity, spectrum and age of thestar. for a star of a few hundred solar masses and zero metallicity (asexpected for the first stars), the physical radius of the lyman alpha spherecan reach tens of kiloparsecs. the first metal-free stars should be stronglyclustered because of high cosmic biasing; this implies that the regionsproducing a 21-cm absorption signal may contain more than one star and willgenerally be irregular and not spherical, because of the complex distributionof the gas. we discuss the feasiblity of detecting these lyman alpha spheres,which would be present at redshifts $z\sim 30$ in the cold dark matter model.their observation would represent a direct proof of the detection of a firststar.

astro-ph;0606009	the eccentricity-mass distribution of exoplanets: signatures of  different formation mechanisms?	we examine the distributions of eccentricity and host star metallicity ofexoplanets as a function of their mass. planets with m sin i &gt;~ 4 m_j have aneccentricity distribution consistent with that of binary stars, while planetswith m sin i &lt;~ 4 m_j are less eccentric than binary stars and more massiveplanets. in addition, host star metallicities decrease with planet mass. thestatistical significance of both of these trends is only marginal with thepresent sample of exoplanets. to account for these trends, we hypothesize thatthere are two populations of gaseous planets: the low-mass population forms bygas accretion onto a rock-ice core in a circumstellar disk and is more abundantat high metalliticities, and the high-mass population forms directly byfragmentation of a pre-stellar cloud. planets of the first population form ininitially circular orbits and grow their eccentricities later, and may have amass upper limit from the total mass of the disk that can be accreted by thecore. the second population may have a mass lower limit resulting fromopacity-limited fragmentation. this would roughly divide the two populations inmass, although they would likely overlap over some mass range. if most objectsin the second population form before the pre-stellar cloud becomes highlyopaque, they would have to be initially located in orbits larger than ~30 au,and would need to migrate to the much smaller orbits in which they areobserved. the higher mean orbital eccentricity of the second population mightbe caused by the larger required intervals of radial migration, and the browndwarf desert might be due to the inability of high-mass brown dwarfs to migrateinwards sufficiently in radius.

astro-ph;0702199	the most massive black holes in the universe: effects of mergers in  massive galaxy clusters	recent observations support the idea that nuclear black holes grew by gasaccretion while shining as luminous quasars at high redshift, and theyestablish a relation of the black hole mass with the host galaxy's spheroidalstellar system. we develop an analytic model to calculate the expected impactof mergers on the masses of black holes in massive clusters of galaxies. we usethe extended press-schechter formalism to generate monte carlo merger historiesof halos with a mass 10^{15} h^{-1} msun. we assume that the black hole massfunction at z=2 is similar to that inferred from observations at z=0 (sincequasar activity declines markedly at z&lt;2), and we assign black holes to theprogenitor halos assuming a monotonic relation between halo mass and black holemass. we follow the dynamical evolution of subhalos within larger halos,allowing for tidal stripping, the loss of orbital energy by dynamical friction,and random orbital perturbations in gravitational encounters with subhalos, andwe assume that mergers of subhalos are followed by mergers of their centralblack holes. our analytic model reproduces numerical estimates of the subhalomass function. we find that the most massive black holes in massive clusterstypically grow by a factor ~ 2 by mergers after gas accretion has stopped. inour ten realizations of 10^{15} h^{-1} msun clusters, the highest initial (z=2)black hole masses are 5-7 x 10^9 msun, but four of the clusters contain blackholes in the range 1-1.5 x 10^{10} msun at z=0. satellite galaxies may hostblack holes whose mass is comparable to, or even greater than, that of thecentral galaxy. thus, black hole mergers can significantly extend the very highend of the black hole mass function.

astro-ph;9701012	a lower bound on the cosmic baryon density	we derive analytic lower bounds on the cosmic baryon density by requiringthat the high-redshift igm contain enough neutral hydrogen to produce theobserved \lya absorption in quasar spectra. the key theoretical assumption isthat absorbing structures are no more extended in redshift space than in realspace. this assumption might not hold if \lya clouds are highly overdense andthermally broadened, but it is likely to hold in the gravitational instabilitypicture for the \lya forest suggested by cosmological simulations,independently of the details of the cosmological model. the other ingredientsin these bounds are an estimate of the uv background from quasars, atemperature $t~10^4k$ for the "warm" photoionized igm that produces most of the\lya absorption, a value of the hubble constant, and observational estimates ofthe mean \lya flux decrement $\dbar$ or, for a more restrictive bound, thedistribution function $p(\tau)$ of \lya optical depths. with plausibleparameter values, the mean decrement bound implies a baryon density parameter$\omb \ga 0.0125/h^2$. with conservative values, the bound weakens to $\omb \ga0.005/h^2$, but the required clustering of the igm is then incompatible withother properties of quasar spectra. a recent observational determination of$p(\tau)$ implies $\omb \ga 0.0125/h^2$ even for a conservative estimate of theuv background, and $\omb \ga 0.018/h^2$ for a more reasonable estimate. thesebounds are consistent with recent low estimates of the primordialdeuterium-to-hydrogen ratio $\dtoh$, which imply $\omb \approx 0.025/h^2$, butthe $p(\tau)$ bound can only be reconciled with high $\dtoh$ estimates byabandoning standard big bang nucleosynthesis or the gravitational instabilitypicture for the origin of the \lya forest.

astro-ph;9701093	high-redshift supernovae and the metal-poor halo stars: signatures of  the first generation of galaxies	recent evidence on the metal content of the high-redshift lyman alpha forestseen in quasar spectra suggests that an early generation of galaxies enrichedthe intergalactic medium (igm) at z ~ 5. we calculate the number of supernovaethat need to have taken place to produce the observed metallicity. theprogenitor stars of the supernovae should have emitted $\sim 20$ ionizingphotons for each baryon in the universe, i.e., more than enough to ionize theigm. we calculate that the rate of these supernovae is such that about one ofthem should be observable at any time per square arc minute. their fluxes are,of course, extremely faint: at z=5, the peak magnitude should be k=27 with aduration of ~ 1 year. however, these supernovae should still be the brightestobjects in the universe beyond some redshift, because the earliest galaxiesshould form before quasars and they should have very low mass, so theirluminosities should be much lower than that of a supernova.  we also show that, under the assumption of a standard initial mass function,a significant fraction of the stars in the galactic halo should have formed inthe early galaxies that reionized and enriched the igm, and which later musthave merged with our galaxy. these stars should have a more extended radialdistribution than the observed halo stars.

astro-ph;9707193	searching for the earliest galaxies using the gunn-peterson trough and  the lyman alpha emission line	if the universe was reionized by o and b stars in an early population ofgalaxies, the associated supernovae should have enriched the universe to a meanmetallicity $\bar z = 10^{-5} (1+ n_{rec})$, where $n_{rec}$ is the mean numberof times that each baryon recombined during the reionization era. this isconsistent with recent observations of the metallicity in the lya forest at$z\simeq 3$. the mean surface brightness observable at present from thegalaxies that produced these heavy elements, in the rest-frame wavelengths$1216\aa &lt; \lambda \lesssim 2500\aa$, should be $\sim 10^{-6} (\bar z/10^{-4})(\omega_b h^2/0.02) ~ photons \cm^{-2} s^{-1} arcsec^{-2}$. most of thisradiation was emitted at $z&gt;5$, before reionization was complete. thesehigh-redshift galaxies may be detectable in near-infrared photometric surveys,identifying them via the gunn-peterson trough (analogous to the use of thelyman limit cutoff to search for galaxies at $z\sim 3$, where the lya forestblanketing is smaller). their spectrum may also be characterized by a stronglya emission line. however, the spectra of galaxies seen behind intervening gasthat is still neutral should show the red damping wing of the gunn-petersontrough, with a predictable profile that obstructs part of the lya emission. thelow-mass galaxies formed before reionization might constitute a distinctivepopulation; we discuss the signature that this population could have in thefaint number counts. although most of these galaxies should have merged intolarger ones, those that survived to the present could be dwarf spheroidals.

astro-ph;9708253	reionization of the intergalactic medium and the damping wing of the  gunn-peterson trough	observations of high-redshift quasars show that the igm must have beenreionized at some redshift $z&gt;5$. if a source of radiation could be observed atthe rest-frame lya wavelength, at a sufficiently high redshift where some ofthe igm in the line-of-sight was not yet reionized, the gunn-peterson troughshould be present. longward of the lya wavelength, a damping wing should beobserved caused by the neutral igm whose absorption profile can be predicted.measuring the shape of this damping wing would provide irrefutable evidence ofthe observation of the igm before reionization, and a determination of thedensity of the neutral igm. this measurement might be hindered by the possiblepresence of a dense absorption system associated with the source.  shortward of the \lya wavelength, absorption should be seen from the patchystructure of the igm in the process of reionization. we show that a completegunn-peterson trough is most likely to continue to be observed through theepoch where the igm is partially ionized. the damping wings of the neutralpatches should overlap if the proper pathlength through an ionized region isless than 1 h^{-1} mpc; even in larger ionized regions, the characteristicbackground intensity should be low enough to yield a very high optical depthdue to the residual neutral fraction, although occasionally some flux may betransmitted through large, underdense voids within an ionized region. the caseof the heii reionization is also discussed, and we argue that helium wasalready doubly ionized by z=3 throughout the igm.  the recently discovered afterglows of gamma-ray bursts might soon be observedat very high redshifts. their featureless continuum spectrum and highluminosities make them ideal sources for studying absorption by the igm.

astro-ph;9804038	the x-ray forest: a new prediction of hierarchical structure formation  models	we use numerical simulations of structure formation in a cold dark mattermodel to predict the absorption lines in the soft x-rays produced by heavyelements in the shock-heated intergalactic medium at low redshift. thesimulation incorporates a model for metal production in galaxies and thesubsequent dispersion of the metals to the intergalactic medium. we analyze inparticular absorption lines produced by oxygen, and calculate the ionizationstage taking into account the observed x-ray background at the present time. wefind that oxygen is fully ionized by the x-ray background in low-density voids,and is mostly in the form of ovii and oviii in the sheets and filamentaryregions. strong absorption lines of ovii and oviii with equivalent widths w ~100 km/s are produced in filamentary regions of overdensities ~ 100 andtemperatures ~ 10^6 k, located in the outskirts of groups and clusters ofgalaxies. the ovii line at e = 574 ev is generally the strongest one in thesesystems. our model predicts that any x-ray source (such as a quasar) shouldtypically show about one ovii absorption line with w &gt; 100 km/s in the intervalfrom z=0 to z=0.3. these lines could be detected with the upcoming generationof x-ray telescopes, and their origin in intervening systems could be confirmedby the association with groups of galaxies and x-ray emitting halos near theline-of-sight at the same redshift. the hot intergalactic medium may be one ofthe main reservoirs of baryons in the present universe, and the heavy elementx-ray absorption lines offer a promising possibility of detecting this newcomponent in the near future.

astro-ph;9805278	microlensing in the galactic bulge: effects of the disk behind the bulge	a large number of microlensing events have been observed in the direction ofthe galactic bulge, with a measured optical depth in the range 2 - 3 x 10^{-6}.it has been shown that most of these events are due to bulge stars being lensedby other bulge stars or by foreground disk stars. among the stars observed inthe bulge fields, there should also be disk stars located behind the bulge;here, we consider their effect on the microlensing rates. the optical depth ofbackground disk stars is much higher than that of typical bulge stars, reaching10^{-5} at 6 kpc behind the bulge. thus, although background disk stars are avery small fraction of the stars in baade's window, we find that ~ 5 to 10 % ofthe optical depth should be due to disk stars more than 3 kpc behind the bulge.this fraction is sensitive to the luminosity function of disk stars at largescale-height, to the magnitude cutoff of the survey, and to the amplificationbias effect causing large numbers of ``blended'' events. we consider also theeffect of a warp and flare in the disk at large distances behind the bulge;this could increase the optical depth from the background disk to ~ 20 % of thetotal. events on background disk stars should on average be longer than otherevents and could be distinguished also by measuring the proper motion ordistance of the stars that have been microlensed. the number of these eventscould be an interesting probe to the structure and stellar population of thefar-side of the galactic disk.

astro-ph;9807137	measuring the cosmological geometry from the lyman alpha forest along  parallel lines of sight	we discuss the feasibility of measuring the cosmological metric using theredshift space correlation function of the lya forest in multiple lines ofsight, as a function of angular and velocity separation. the geometricparameter that is measured is f(z) = h(z) d(z)/c, where h(z) is the hubbleconstant and d(z) the angular diameter distance at redshift z. the correlationfunction is computed in linear theory. we describe a method to measure it fromobservations with the gaussianization procedure of croft et al (1998) to mapthe lya forest transmitted flux to an approximation of the linear densityfield. the effect of peculiar velocities on the shape of the recovered powerspectrum is pointed out. we estimate the error in recovering the f(z) factorfrom observations due to the variance in the lya absorbers. we show that ~ 20pairs of quasars (separations &lt; 3') are needed to distinguish a flat \omega_0=1universe from a universe with \omega_0=0.2, \omega_\lambda=0.8. a secondparameter that is obtained from the correlation function of the lya forest is\beta \simeq \omega(z)^{0.6}/b (affecting the magnitude of the peculiarvelocities), where b is a linear theory bias of the lya forest. the statisticalerror of f(z) is reduced if b can be determined independently from numericalsimulations, reducing the number of quasar pairs needed for constrainingcosmology to approximately six. on small scales, where the correlation functionis higher, f(z) should be measurable with fewer quasars, but non-linear effectsmust then be taken into account. the anisotropy of the non-linear redshiftspace correlation function as a function of scale should also provide a precisequantitative test of the gravitational instability theory of the lya forest.

astro-ph;9808277	small-angle scattering of x-rays from extragalactic sources by dust in  intervening galaxies	gamma-ray bursts are now known to be a cosmological population of objects,which are often accompanied by x-ray and optical afterglows. the total energyemitted in the afterglow can be similar to the energy radiated in the gamma-rayburst itself. if a galaxy containing a large column density of dust is near theline of sight to a gamma-ray burst, small-angle scattering of the x-rays due todiffraction by the dust grains will give rise to an x-ray echo of theafterglow. a measurement of the angular size of the echo at a certain timeafter the afterglow is observed yields a combination of the angular diameterdistances to the scattering galaxy and the gamma-ray burst that can be used toconstrain cosmological models in the same way as a time delay in agravitational lens. the scattering galaxy will generally cause gravitationallensing as well, and this should modify the shape of the x-ray echo from acircular ring.  the main difficulty in detecting this phenomenon is the very low fluxexpected for the echo. the flux can be increased when the gamma-ray burst ishighly magnified by gravitational lensing, or when the deflecting galaxy is atlow redshift. x-ray echos of continuous (but variable) sources, such asquasars, may also be detectable with high-resolution instruments and wouldallow similar measurements.

astro-ph;9809237	galaxy formation and the kinematics of damped lyman alpha systems	a model of damped lyman alpha systems is presented based on randomly movingclouds in spherical halos. we use the press-schechter model for the abundanceof halos, and assume that each halo has a similar population of clouds, withtotal mass and spatial distribution constrained to fit observations of thecolumn density distribution. we show that the kinematics of the multipleabsorbing components revealed in absorption profiles of the low-ionizationlines, presented by prochaska &amp; wolfe, are consistent with our spherical halomodel.  the presence of multiple absorbing components with a large covering factor,combined with the small impact parameters of the systems predicted in ouranalytical model and in numerical simulations, implies a high rate of energydissipation in cloud collisions. we calculate the rate of energy dissipation inour model, and show that it is far greater than the rate at which energy can besupplied by gravitational mergers of halos. this poses a problem for the modelof merging protogalactic clumps of haehnelt et al., based on numericalsimulations. we also present new constraints on the amplitude of the powerspectrum in hierarchical theories required to account for the observed velocitydispersion in the absorbers. we find that the linearly extrapolated rmsfluctuation on spheres of radius hr = 100 km/s at z=4 must be greater than0.75. although this limit is obtained only for our specific model of theabsorbing components, it should not be highly model-dependent because thevelocity dispersion of the absorbers is essentially determined by the velocitydispersion of the halos where the gas is moving.

astro-ph;9812306	reionization of the inhomogeneous universe	a model of the density distribution in the intergalactic medium, motivated bythat found in numerical simulations, is used to demonstrate the effect of aclumpy igm and discrete sources on the reionization of the universe. in aninhomogeneous universe reionization occurs outside-in, starting in voids andgradually penetrating into overdense regions. reionization should not be suddenbut gradual, with a continuous rise of the photon mean free path over a fairfraction of the hubble time as the emissivity increases. we show that ahydrogen gunn-peterson trough should be present at $z\simeq 6$ unless theemissivity increases with redshift at $z&gt;4$. however, the epoch of overlap ofcosmological \hii regions could have occurred at a higher redshift if sourcesof low luminosity reionized the igm; the gunn-peterson trough at $z\sim 6$would then appear because even the most underdense voids have a large enoughneutral fraction in ionization equilibrium to be optically thick to \lyaphotons. cosmological \hii regions near the epoch of overlap can produce gapsof transmitted flux only if luminous quasars contributed to the reionization.despite the clumpiness of the matter distribution, recombinations are not veryimportant during the reionization of hydrogen because the high density gas isnot ionized until a late time. we show that the \heii reionization was mostlikely delayed relative to the hydrogen reionization, but should be completedby $z\sim 3$, the redshift where observations are available. the reported largeoptical depth fluctuations of \heii are probably not due to an incomplete \heiireionization, but arise from a combination of density fluctuations and thevariations in the intensity of the ionizing background due to luminous qso's.

astro-ph;9909131	soft x-ray absorption by high-redshift intergalactic helium	the lyman alpha absorption from intergalactic, once-ionized helium (heii) hasbeen measured with hst in four quasars over the last few years, over theredshift range 2.4 &lt; z &lt; 3.2. these observations have indicated that the heiireionization may not have been completed until z\simeq 2.8, and that largefluctuations in the intensity of the heii-ionizing background were presentbefore this epoch. the detailed history of heii reionization at higherredshifts is, however, model-dependent and difficult to determine from theseobservations, because the igm can be completely optically thick to lya photonswhen only a small fraction of the helium remains as heii. in addition, findingquasars in which the heii lya absorption can be observed becomes increasinglydifficult at higher redshift, owing to the large abundance of hydrogen lymanlimit systems.  it is pointed out here that heii in the igm should also cause detectablecontinuum absorption in the soft x-rays. the spectrum of a high-redshift sourceseen behind the igm when most of the helium was heii should recover from theheii lyman continuum absorption at an observed energy \sim 0.1 kev. galacticabsorption will generally be stronger, but not by a large factor; theintergalactic heii absorption can be detected as an excess over the expectedgalactic absorption from the 21cm hi column density. in principle, this methodallows a direct determination of the fraction of helium that was singly ionizedas a function of redshift, if the measurement is done on a large sample ofhigh-redshift sources over a range of redshift.

astro-ph;9911196	the observed probability distribution function, power spectrum, and  correlation function of the transmitted flux in the lyman-alpha forest	a sample of eight quasars observed at high resolution and signal-to-noise isused to determine the probability distribution function (pdf), the powerspectrum, and the correlation function of the transmitted flux in the \lyaforest, in three redshift bins centered at z=2.41, 3.00, and 3.89. all theresults are presented in tabular form, with full error covariance matrices toallow for comparisons with any numerical simulations and with other data sets.the observations are compared with a numerical simulation of the \lya forest ofa lambda-cdm model with omega=0.4, known to agree with other large-scalestructure observational constraints. there is excellent agreement for the pdf,if the mean transmitted flux is adjusted to match the observations. a smalldifference between the observed and predicted pdf is found at high fluxes andlow redshift, which may be due to the uncertain effects of fitting the spectralcontinuum. using the numerical simulation, we show how the flux power spectrumcan be used to recover the initial power spectrum of density fluctuations. fromour sample of eight quasars, we measure the amplitude of the mass powerspectrum to correspond to a linear variance per unit ln(k) of$\delta^2_\rho(k)=0.72\pm0.09$ at k=0.04(km/s)^{-1} and z=3, and the slope ofthe power spectrum near the same k to be $n_p=-2.55\pm0.10$ (statistical errorbars). the results are statistically consistent with croft et. al. (1999),although our value for the rms fluctuation is lower by a factor 0.75. for thelambda-cdm model we use, the implied primordial slope is $n=0.93\pm0.10$, andthe normalization is $\sigma_8=0.68+1.16(0.95-n)\pm0.04$.

astro-ph;9911214	the first stars: where did they form?	several emerging links between high-redshift observational cosmology and thegalactic fossil evidence found in the kinematics, metallicities and ages ofmilky way stars are discussed. in a flat cold dark matter model with$\omega\simeq 0.3$ that agrees with present large-scale structure observations,the oldest stars in the milky way should have formed in the first halos wheregas was able to cool, at $z\simeq 20$. these earliest, weakly bound dwarfgalaxies probably turned only a small fraction of their gas to stars, whichshould be metal-poor. however, the merging rate in the early universe was muchfaster than the present one, so massive halos with more efficient starformation and metallicities up to the highest values present today in the bulgecould have formed less than $10^9$ years after the oldest stars. the meanmetallicity produced in the universe by a given redshift is related to the meansurface brightness of star-forming galaxies above this redshift, and also tothe reionization epoch if galaxies were the dominant sources of ionizingradiation. the biased distribution of the early dwarf galaxies where the firststars formed should result in an age gradient with radius of thelow-metallicity stars in the milky way, with the oldest ones concentrated inthe bulge and the youngest in the outer halo.

0812.3414	photo-z optimization for measurements of the bao radial direction	baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) in the radial direction offer a method todirectly measure the universe expansion history, and to set limits to spacecurvature when combined to the angular bao signal. in addition to spectroscopicsurveys, radial bao might be measured from accurate enough photometricredshifts obtained with narrow-band filters. we explore the requirements for aphotometric survey using luminous red galaxies (lrg) to competitively measurethe radial bao signal and discuss the possible systematic errors of thisapproach. if lrg were a highly homogeneous population, we show that the photo-zaccuracy would not substantially improve by increasing the number of filtersbeyond $\sim 10$, except for a small fraction of the sources detected at highsignal-to-noise, and broad-band filters would suffice to achieve the target$\sigma_z = 0.003 (1+z)$ for measuring radial bao. using the lrg spectraobtained from sdss, we find that the spectral variability of lrg substantiallyworsens the achievable photometric redshift errors, and that the optimal systemconsists of $\sim$ 30 filters of width $\delta \lambda / \lambda \sim 0.02$. a$s/n &gt; 20$ is generally necessary at the filters on the red side of the$h\alpha$ break to reach the target photometric accuracy. we estimate that a5-year survey in a dedicated telescope with etendue in excess of 60 ${\rm m}^2{\rm deg}^2$ would be necessary to obtain a high enough density of galaxies tomeasure radial bao with sufficiently low shot noise up to $z= 0.85$. weconclude that spectroscopic surveys have a superior performance thanphotometric ones for measuring bao in the radial direction.
