0909.0750	the size-star formation relation of massive galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5	we study the relation between size and star formation activity in a completesample of 225 massive (m &gt; 5 x 10^10 msun) galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, selected fromthe fireworks uv-ir catalog of the cdfs. based on stellar population synthesismodel fits to the observed restframe uv-nir seds, and independent mips 24micron observations, 65% of galaxies are actively forming stars, while 35% arequiescent. using sizes derived from 2d surface brightness profile fits to highresolution (fwhm_{psf}~0.45 arcsec) groundbased isaac data, we confirm andimprove the significance of the relation between star formation activity andcompactness found in previous studies, using a large, complete mass-limitedsample. at z~2, massive quiescent galaxies are significantly smaller thanmassive star forming galaxies, and a median factor of 0.34+/-0.02 smaller thangalaxies of similar mass in the local universe. 13% of the quiescent galaxiesare unresolved in the isaac data, corresponding to sizes &lt;1 kpc, more than 5times smaller than galaxies of similar mass locally. the quiescent galaxiesspan a kormendy relation which, compared to the relation for local early types,is shifted to smaller sizes and brighter surface brightnesses and isincompatible with passive evolution. the progenitors of the quiescent galaxies,were likely dominated by highly concentrated, intense nuclear star bursts atz~3-4, in contrast to star forming galaxies at z~2 which are extended anddominated by distributed star formation.

0909.1806	z~7 galaxies in the hudf: first epoch wfc3/ir results	we present a sample of 16 robust z~7 z-drop galaxies detected by the newlyinstalled wfc3/ir camera on the hubble space telescope. our analysis is basedon the first epoch data of the hudf09 program covering the hubble ultra deepfield with 60 orbits of y, j, and h observations. these remarkable data cover4.7 arcmin^2 and are the deepest nir images ever taken, reaching to ~29 mag ab(5 sigma). the 16 z~6.5-7.5 galaxies have been identified based on the lymanbreak technique utilizing (z-y) vs. (y-j) colors. they have magnitudes j =26.0-29.0 (ab), an average apparent half-light radius of ~0.16 arcsec (&lt;~1kpc), and show very blue colors (some even beta&lt;~-2.5), in particular at lowluminosities. the wfc3/ir data confirms previous nicmos detections indicatingthat the dropout selection at z~7 is very reliable. our data allow a firstdetermination of the faint end slope of the z~7 luminosity function, reachingdown to m_uv ~ -18, a full magnitude fainter than previous measurements. whenfixing phi*=1.4e-3/mpc^3/mag to the value previously measured at z~6, we find abest-fit value of alpha=-1.77+-0.20, with a characteristic luminosity ofm_*=-19.91+-0.09. this steep slope is similar to what is seen at z~2-6 andindicates that low luminosity galaxies could potentially provide adequate fluxto reionize the universe. the remarkable depth and resolution of these newimages provide insights into the coming power of jwst.

0910.0001	very blue uv-continuum slopes of low luminosity z~7 galaxies from  wfc3/ir: evidence for extremely low metallicities?	we use the ultra-deep wfc3/ir data over the hudf and the early releasescience wfc3/ir data over the cdf-south goods field to quantify the broadbandspectral properties of candidate star-forming galaxies at z~7. we determine theuv-continuum slope beta in these galaxies, and compare the slopes with galaxiesat later times to measure the evolution in beta. for luminous l*(z=3) galaxies,we measure a mean uv-continuum slope beta of -2.0+/-0.2, which is comparable tothe beta~-2 derived at similar luminosities at z~5-6. however, for the lowerluminosity 0.1l*(z=3) galaxies, we measure a mean beta of -3.0+/-0.2. this issubstantially bluer than is found for similar luminosity galaxies at z~4, just800 myr later, and even at z~5-6. in principle, the observed beta of -3.0 canbe matched by a very young, dust-free stellar population, but when nebularemission is included the expected beta becomes &gt;~-2.7. to produce these veryblue beta's (i.e., beta~-3), extremely low metallicities and mechanisms toreduce the red nebular emission are likely required. for example, a largeescape fraction (i.e., f_{esc}&gt;~0.3) could minimize the contribution from thisred nebular emission. if this is correct and the escape fraction in faint z~7galaxies is &gt;~0.3, it may help to explain how galaxies reionize the universe.

0910.0838	ultradeep infrared array camera observations of sub-l* z~7 and z~8  galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field: the contribution of low-luminosity  galaxies to the stellar mass density and reionization	we study the spitzer infrared array camera (irac) mid-infrared (rest-frameoptical) fluxes of 14 newly wfc3/ir-detected z=7 z_{850}-dropout galaxies and 5z=8 y_{105}-dropout galaxies. the wfc3/ir depth and spatial resolution allowaccurate removal of contaminating foreground light, enabling reliable fluxmeasurements at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. none of the galaxies are detected to[3.6]=26.9 (ab, 2 sigma), but a stacking analysis reveals a robust detectionfor the z_{850}-dropouts and an upper limit for the y_{105}-dropouts. weconstruct average broadband seds using the stacked acs, wfc3, and irac fluxesand fit stellar population synthesis models to derive mean redshifts, stellarmasses, and ages. for the z_{850}-dropouts, we find z=6.9^{+0.1}_{-0.1},(u-v)_{rest}=0.4, reddening a_v=0, stellar mass m*=1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.6} x 10^9m_sun (salpeter imf). the best-fit ages ~300myr, m/l_v=0.2, andssfr=1.7gyr^{-1} are similar to values reported for luminous z=7 galaxies,indicating the galaxies are smaller but not younger. the sub-l* galaxiesobserved here contribute significantly to the stellar mass density and underfavorable conditions may have provided enough photons for sustainedreionization at 7&lt;z&lt;11. in contrast, the z=8.3^{+0.1}_{-0.2} y_{105}-dropoutshave stellar masses that are uncertain by 1.5 dex due to the near-completereliance on far-uv data. adopting the 2 sigma upper limit on the m/l(z=8), thestellar mass density to m_{uv,ab} &lt; -18 declines fromrho*(z=7)=3.7^{+1.0}_{-1.8} x 10^6 m_sun mpc^{-3} to rho*(z=8) &lt; 8 x 10^5 m_sunmpc^{-3}, following (1+z)^{-6} over 3&lt;z&lt;8. lower masses at z=8 would signifymore dramatic evolution, which can be established with deeper iracobservations, long before the arrival of the james webb space telescope.

0910.2227	the dead sequence: a clear bimodality in galaxy colors from z=0 to z=2.5	we select 25,000 galaxies from the newfirm medium band survey (nmbs) to studythe rest-frame u-v color distribution of galaxies at 0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. the fiveunique nir filters of the nmbs enable the precise measurement of photometricredshifts and rest-frame colors for 9,900 galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. therest-frame u-v color distribution at all z&lt;~2.5 is bimodal, with a red peak, ablue peak, and a population of galaxies in between (the green valley). modelfits to the optical-nir seds and the distribution of mips-detected galaxiesindicate that the colors of galaxies in the green valley are determined largelyby the amount of reddening by dust. this result does not support the simplestinterpretation of green valley objects as a transition from blue star-formingto red quiescent galaxies. we show that correcting the rest-frame colors fordust reddening allows a remarkably clean separation between the red and bluesequences up to z~2.5. our study confirms that dusty starburst galaxies cancontribute a significant fraction to red sequence samples selected on the basisof a single rest-frame color (i.e. u-v), so extra care must be taken if samplesof truly "red and dead" galaxies are desired. interestingly, of galaxiesdetected at 24 microns, 14% remain on the red sequence after applying thereddening correction.

0911.1356	star formation rates and stellar masses of z=7-8 galaxies from irac  observations of the wfc3/ir ers and the hudf field	we investigate the spitzer/irac properties of 36 z~7 z-dropout galaxies and 3z~8 y-dropout galaxies derived from deep/wide-area wfc3/ir data of the earlyrelease science, the ultradeep hudf09, and wide-area nicmos data. we fitstellar population synthesis models to the seds to derive mean redshifts,stellar masses, and ages. the z~7 galaxies are best characterized bysubstantial ages (&gt;100 myr) and m/l_v~0.2. the main trend with decreasingluminosity is that of bluing of the far-uv slope from beta~-2.0 to beta~-3.0.this can be explained by decreasing metallicity, except for the lowestluminosity galaxies (0.1 l*{z=3}), where low metallicity and smooth sfhs failto match the blue far-uv and moderately red h-[3.6] color. such colors mayrequire episodic sfhs with short periods of activity and quiescence ("on-off"cycles) and/or a contribution from emission lines. the stellar mass of oursample of z~7 star forming galaxies correlates with sfr according to log m* =8.70 (+-0.09) + 1.06(+-0.10) log sfr, implying star formation may havecommenced at z&gt;10. no galaxies are found with sfrs much higher or lower thanthe past averaged sfr suggesting that the typical star formation timescales areprobably a substantial fraction of the hubble time. we report the first iracdetection of y-dropout galaxies at z~8. the average rest-frame u-v=0.3 (ab) ofthe 3 galaxies are similar to faint z~7 galaxies, implying similar m/l. thestellar mass density to m_{uv,ab}&lt;-18 is rho*(z=8) = 1.8^{+0.7}_{-1.0} x 10^6m_sun mpc^-3, following log rho*(z)= 10.6(+-0.6) - 4.4(+-0.7) log(1+z) [m_sunmpc^-3] over 3&lt;z&lt; 8.

0912.4263	a candidate redshift z ~ 10 galaxy and rapid changes in that population  at an age of 500 myr	searches for very-high-redshift galaxies over the past decade have yielded alarge sample of more than 6,000 galaxies existing just 900-2,000 million years(myr) after the big bang (redshifts 6 &gt; z &gt; 3; ref. 1). the hubble ultra deepfield (hudf09) data have yielded the first reliable detections of z ~ 8galaxies that, together with reports of a gamma-ray burst at z ~ 8.2 (refs 10,11), constitute the earliest objects reliably reported to date. observations ofz ~ 7-8 galaxies suggest substantial star formation at z &gt; 9-10. here we usethe full two-year hudf09 data to conduct an ultra-deep search for z ~ 10galaxies in the heart of the reionization epoch, only 500 myr after the bigbang. not only do we find one possible z ~ 10 galaxy candidate, but we showthat, regardless of source detections, the star formation rate density is muchsmaller (~10%) at this time than it is just ~200 myr later at z ~ 8. thisdemonstrates how rapid galaxy build-up was at z ~ 10, as galaxies increased inboth luminosity density and volume density from z ~ 8 to z ~ 10. the 100-200myr before z ~ 10 is clearly a crucial phase in the assembly of the earliestgalaxies.

1005.1661	the evolution of the uv luminosity function from z ~ 0.75 to z ~ 2.5  using hst ers wfc3/uvis observations	we present uv luminosity functions (lfs) at 1500 angstrom derived from thehst early release science wfc3/uvis data acquired over ~50 arcmin^2 of thegoods-south field. the lfs are determined over the entire redshift rangez=0.75-2.5 using two methods, similar to those used at higher redshifts forlyman break galaxies (lbgs): (1) 13-band uv+optical+nir photometric redshiftsto study galaxies in the range z=0.5-2 in three bins of dz=0.5, and (2) dropoutsamples in three redshift windows centered at z~1.5, z~1.9, and z~2.5. thecharacteristic luminosity dims by ~1.5 mag from z=2.5 to z=0.75, consistentwith earlier work. however, the other schechter function parameters, thefaint-end slope and the number density, are found to be remarkably constantover the range z=0.75-2.5. using these lf determinations we find the uvluminosity density to increase by ~1.4 dex according to (1+z)^{2.58+-0.15} fromz~0 to its peak at z~2.5. strikingly, the inferred faint-end slopes for our lfsare all steeper than alpha=-1.5, in agreement with higher-redshift lbg studies.since the faint-end slope in the local universe is found to be much flatterwith alpha~=-1.2, this poses the question as to when and how the expectedflattening occurs. despite relatively large uncertainties, our data suggestalpha~=-1.7 at least down to z~1. these new results from such a shallow earlydataset demonstrate very clearly the remarkable potential of wfc3/uvis for thethorough characterization of galaxy evolution over the full redshift rangez~0.5 to z~3.

1006.5453	the age spread of quiescent galaxies with the newfirm medium-band  survey: identification of the oldest galaxies out to z~2	with a complete, mass-selected sample of quiescent galaxies from the newfirmmedium-band survey (nmbs), we study the stellar populations of the oldest andmost massive galaxies (&gt;10^11 msun) to high redshift. the sample includes 570quiescent galaxies selected based on their extinction-corrected u-v colors outto z=2.2, with accurate photometric redshifts, sigma_z/(1+z)~2%, and rest-framecolors, sigma_u-v~0.06 mag. we measure an increase in the intrinsic scatter ofthe rest-frame u-v colors of quiescent galaxies with redshift. this scatter incolor arises from the spread in ages of the quiescent galaxies, where we seeboth relatively quiescent red, old galaxies and quiescent blue, youngergalaxies towards higher redshift. the trends between color and age areconsistent with the observed composite rest-frame spectral energy distributions(seds) of these galaxies. the composite seds of the reddest and bluestquiescent galaxies are fundamentally different, with remarkably well-defined4000a- and balmer-breaks, respectively. some of the quiescent galaxies may beup to 4 times older than the average age- and up to the age of the universe, ifthe assumption of solar metallicity is correct. by matching the scatterpredicted by models that include growth of the red sequence by thetransformation of blue galaxies to the observed intrinsic scatter, the dataindicate that most early-type galaxies formed their stars at high redshift witha burst of star formation prior to migrating to the red sequence. the observedu-v color evolution with redshift is weaker than passive evolution predicts;possible mechanisms to slow the color evolution include increasing amounts ofdust in quiescent galaxies towards higher redshift, red mergers at z&lt;1, and afrosting of relatively young stars from star formation at later times.

0709.0806	the uv colours of high-redshift early-type galaxies: evidence for recent  star formation and stellar mass assembly over the last 8 billion years	we combine deep ubvrizjk photometry from the multiwavelength survey byyale-chile (musyc) with redshifts from the combo-17 survey to perform alarge-scale study of the rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) properties of 674high-redshift (0.5&lt;z&lt;1) early-type galaxies, drawn from the extended chandradeep field south (e-cdfs). galaxy morphologies are determined through visualinspection of hubble space telescope (hst) images taken from the gems survey.we harness the sensitivity of the uv to young (&lt;1 gyr old) stars to quantifythe recent star formation history of early-type galaxies across a range ofluminosities (-23.5 &lt; m(v) &lt; -18). comparisons to simple stellar populationsforming at high redshift indicate that only ~1.1 percent of early-types in thissample are consistent with purely passive ageing since z=2. parametrising therecent star formation (rsf) in terms of the mass fraction of stars less than agyr old, we find that the early-type population as a whole shows a typical rsfbetween 5 and 13% in the redshift range 0.5&lt;z&lt;1. early-types on the uv redsequence show rsf values less than 5% while the reddest early-types arevirtually quiescent with rsf values of ~1%. we find compelling evidence thatearly-types of all luminosities form stars over the lifetime of the universe,although the bulk of their star formation is already complete at high redshift.this tail-end of star formation is measurable and not negligible, with luminous(-23&lt;m(v)&lt;-20.5) early-types potentially forming 10-15% of their mass sincez=1, with their less luminous (m(v)&gt;-20.5) counterparts potentially forming30-60 percent of their mass in the same redshift range.

1105.2297	expanded search for z~10 galaxies from hudf09, ers, and candels data:  evidence for accelerated evolution at z&gt;8?	we search for z~10 galaxies over ~160 arcmin^2 of wfc3/ir data in the chandradeep field south, using the public hudf09, ers, and candels surveys, that reachto 5sigma depths ranging from 26.9 to 29.4 in h_160 ab mag. z&gt;~9.5 galaxycandidates are identified via j_125-h_160&gt;1.2 colors and non-detections in anyband blueward of j_125. spitzer irac photometry is key for separating thegenuine high-z candidates from intermediate redshift (z~2-4) galaxies withevolved or heavily dust obscured stellar populations. after removing 16 sourcesof intermediate brightness (h_160~24-26 mag) with strong irac detections, weonly find one plausible z~10 galaxy candidate in the whole data set, previouslyreported in bouwens et al. (2011). the newer data cover a 3x larger area andprovide much stronger constraints on the evolution of the uv luminosityfunction (lf). if the evolution of the z~4-8 lfs is extrapolated to z~10, sixz~10 galaxies are expected in our data. the detection of only one sourcesuggests that the uv lf evolves at an accelerated rate before z~8. theluminosity density is found to increase by more than an order of magnitude inonly 170 myr from z~10 to z~8. this increase is &gt;=4x larger than expected fromthe lower redshift extrapolation of the uv lf. we are thus likely witnessingthe first rapid build-up of galaxies in the heart of cosmic reionization.future deep hst wfc3/ir data, reaching to well beyond 29 mag, can enable a morerobust quantification of the accelerated evolution around z~10.

1201.0755	the bright end of the uv luminosity function at z~8: new constraints  from candels data in goods-south	we present new z~8 galaxy candidates from a search over ~95 arcmin^2 ofwfc3/ir data, tripling the previous search area for bright z~8 galaxies. ouranalysis uses newly acquired wfc3/ir imaging data from the candels multi-cycletreasury program over the goods south field. these new data are combined withexisting deep optical acs imaging to search for relatively bright (m_uv &lt; -19.5mag) z~8 galaxy candidates using the lyman break technique. these newcandidates are used to determine the bright end of the uv luminosity function(lf) of star-forming galaxies at z~8. to minimize contamination from lowerredshift galaxies, we make full use of all optical acs data and impose strictnon-detection criteria based on an optical chi^2_opt flux measurement. in thewhole search area we identify 16 candidate z~8 galaxies, spanning a magnituderange h_160 = 25.7-27.9 mag. the new data show that the uv lf is a factor ~1.7xlower at m_uv &lt; -19.5 mag than determined from the hudf09 and ers data alone.combining this new sample with the previous candidates from the hudf09 and ersdata allows us to perform the most accurate measurement of the z~8 uv lf yet.schechter function fits to the combined data result in a best-fitcharacteristic magnitude of m*(z=8) = -20.04+-0.46 mag. the faint-end slope isvery steep, though quite uncertain, with alpha = -2.06+-0.32. a combination ofwide area data with additional ultra-deep imaging will be required tosignificantly reduce the uncertainties on these parameters in the future.

1209.3037	the spectral energy distributions of z~8 galaxies from the irac ultra  deep fields: emission lines, stellar masses, and specific star formation  rates at 650 myr	using new ultradeep spitzer/irac photometry from the irac ultradeep fieldprogram (iudf), we investigate the stellar populations of a sample of 63y-dropout galaxy candidates at z~8, only 650myr after the big bang. the sourcesare selected from hst/acs+wfc3/ir data over the hubble ultra deep field (hudf),two hudf parallel fields, and wide area data over the candels/goods-south. thenew spitzer/irac data increase the coverage at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron to~120h over the hudf reaching depths of ~28 (ab,1 sigma). the improved depth andinclusion of brighter candidates result in direct &gt;3 sigma irac detections of20/63 sources, of which 11/63 are detected at &gt; 5 sigma. the average[3.6]-[4.5] colors of irac detected galaxies at z~8 are markedly redder thanthose at z~7, observed only 130myr later. the simplest explanation is that wewitness strong rest-frame optical emission lines (in particular[oiii]4959,5007+hbeta) moving through the irac bandpasses with redshift.assuming that the average rest-frame spectrum is the same at both z~7 and z~8we estimate a rest-frame equivalent width of w([oiii]4959,5007+hbeta) = 670(+260,-170) angstrom contributing 0.56 (+0.16,-0.11) mag to the 4.5 micronfilter at z~8. the corresponding w(halpha) = 430 (+160,-110) angstrom impliesan average specific star formation rate of ssfr = 11 (+11,-5) gyr^-1 and astellar population age of 100 (+100,-50) myr. correcting the spectral energydistribution for the contribution of emission lines lowers the average best-fitstellar masses and mass-to-light ratios by x3, decreasing the integratedstellar mass density to rho*(z=8,muv&lt;-18)=0.6 (+0.4,-0.3) x 10^6 msun mpc^-3.

1211.1010	a rest-frame optical view on z~4 galaxies i: color and age distributions  from deep irac photometry of the iudf10 and goods surveys	we present a study of rest-frame uv-to-optical color distributions for z~4galaxies based on the combination of deep hst/acs+wfc3/ir data withspitzer/irac imaging. in particular, we use new, ultra-deep data from the iracultradeep field program (iudf10). our sample contains a total of ~2600 galaxiesselected as b-dropout lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in the hudf and one of itsdeep parallel fields, the hudf09-2, as well as goods-north and south. thissample is used to investigate the uv continuum slopes beta and balmer breakcolors (j_125-[4.5]) as a function of rest-frame optical luminosity. the [4.5]filter is chosen to avoid potential contamination by strong rest-frame opticalemission lines. we find that galaxies at m_z&lt;-21.5 (roughly corresponding tol*[z~4]) are significantly redder than their lower luminosity counterparts. theuv continuum slopes and the j_125-[4.5] colors are well correlated. the mostsimple explanation for this correlation is that the dust reddening at theseredshifts is better described by an smc-like extinction curve, rather than thetypically assumed calzetti reddening. after correcting for dust, we find thatthe galaxy population shows mean stellar population ages in the range 10^8.5 to10^9 yr, with a dispersion of ~0.5 dex, and only weak trends as a function ofluminosity. in contrast to some results from the literature, we find that onlya small fraction of galaxies shows balmer break colors which are consistentwith extremely young ages, younger than 100 myr. under the assumption of smoothstar-formation histories, this fraction is only 12-19% for galaxies atm_z&lt;-19.75. our results are consistent with a gradual build-up of stars anddust in galaxies at z&gt;4, with only a small fraction of stars being formed inshort, intense bursts of star-formation.

1211.3105	photometric constraints on the redshift of z~10 candidate udfj-39546284  from deeper wfc3/ir+acs+irac observations over the hudf	ultra-deep wfc3/ir observations on the hudf from the hudf09 program revealedjust one plausible z~10 candidate udfj-39546284. udfj-39546284 had all theproperties expected of a galaxy at z~10 showing (1) no detection in the deepacs+wfc3 imaging data blueward of the f160w band, exhibiting (2) a bluespectral slope redward of the break, and showing (3) no prominent detection indeep irac observations. the new, similarly deep wfc3/ir hudf12 f160wobservations over the hudf09/xdf allow us to further assess this candidate.these observations show that this candidate, previously only detected at ~5.9sigma in a single band, clearly corresponds to a real source. it is detected at~5.3 sigma in the new h-band data and at ~7.8 sigma in the full 85-orbit h-bandstack. interestingly, the non-detection of the source (&lt;1 sigma) in the newf140w observations suggests a higher redshift. formally, the best-fit redshiftof the source utilizing all the wfc3+acs (and irac+k-band) observations is11.8+/-0.3. however, we consider the z~12 interpretation somewhat unlikely,since the source would either need to be ~20x more luminous than expected orshow very high-ew ly-alpha emission (which seems improbable given the extensiveneutral gas prevalent early in the reionization epoch). lower-redshiftsolutions fail if only continuum models are allowed. plausible lower-redshiftsolutions require that the h-band flux be dominated by line emission such ashalpha or [oiii] with extreme ews. the tentative detection of line emission at1.6 microns in udfj-39546284 in a companion paper suggests that such emissionmay have already been found.

1301.6162	probing the dawn of galaxies at z~9-12: new constraints from hudf12/xdf  and candels data	we present a comprehensive analysis of z&gt;8 galaxies based on ultra-deepwfc3/ir data. we constrain the evolution of the uv luminosity function (lf) andluminosity densities from z~11 to z~8 by exploiting all the wfc3/ir data overthe hubble ultra-deep field from the hudf09 and the new hudf12 program, inaddition to the hudf09 parallel field data, as well as wider area wfc3/irimaging over goods-south. galaxies are selected based on the lyman breaktechnique in three samples centered around z~9, z~10 and z~11, with seven z~9galaxy candidates, and one each at z~10 and z~11. we confirm a new z~10candidate (with z=9.8+-0.6) that was not convincingly identified in our firstz~10 sample. the deeper data over the hudf confirms all our previous z&gt;~7.5candidates as genuine high-redshift candidates, and extends our samples tohigher redshift and fainter limits (h_160~29.8 mag). we perform one of thefirst estimates of the z~9 uv lf and improve our previous constraints at z~10.extrapolating the lower redshift uv lf evolution should have revealed 17 z~9and 9 z~10 sources, i.e., a factor ~3x and 9x larger than observed. theinferred star-formation rate density (sfrd) in galaxies above 0.7 m_sun/yrdecreases by 0.6+-0.2 dex from z~8 to z~9, in good agreement with previousestimates. the low number of sources found at z&gt;8 is consistent with a veryrapid build-up of galaxies across z~10 to z~8. from a combination of allcurrent measurements, we find a best estimate of a factor 10x decrease in thesfrd from z~8 to z~10, following (1+z)^(-11.4+-3.1). our measurements thusconfirm our previous finding of an accelerated evolution beyond z~8, andsignify a rapid build-up of galaxies with m_uv&lt;-17.7 within only ~200 myr fromz~10 to z~8, in the heart of cosmic reionization.

1305.1931	the hst extreme deep field xdf: combining all acs and wfc3/ir data on  the hudf region into the deepest field ever	the extreme deep field (xdf) combines data from ten years of observationswith the hst advanced camera for surveys (acs) and the wide-field camera 3infra-red (wfc3/ir) into the deepest image of the sky ever in theoptical/near-ir. since the initial observations on the hubble ultra-deep field(hudf) in 2003, numerous surveys and programs, including supernova followup,hudf09, candels, and hudf12 have contributed additional imaging data across thehudf region. yet these have never been combined and made available as onecomplete ultra-deep optical and near-infrared image dataset. we do so now forthe extreme deep field (xdf) program. our new and improved processingtechniques provide higher quality reductions of the total dataset. all wfc3near-ir and optical acs data sets have been fully combined and accuratelymatched, resulting in the deepest imaging ever taken at these wavelengthsranging from 29.1 to 30.3 ab mag (5sigma in a 0.35" diameter aperture) in 9filters. the gains in the optical for the four filters done in the original acshudf correspond to a typical improvement of 0.15 mag, with gains of 0.25 mag inthe deepest areas. such gains are equivalent to adding ~130 to ~240 orbits ofacs data to the hudf. improved processing alone results in a typical gain of~0.1 mag. our 5sigma (optical+near-ir) sextractor catalogs reveal about 14140sources in the full field and about 7121 galaxies in the deepest part of thexdf (the hudf09 region). the xdf is the deepest image of the universe evertaken, reaching, in the combined image for a flat f_nu source, to 31.2 ab mag5sigma (32.9 at 1sigma) in a 0.35" diameter aperture.

1309.2280	the most luminous z~9-10 galaxy candidates yet found: the luminosity  function, cosmic star-formation rate, and the first mass density estimate at  500 myr	[abridged] we present the discovery of four surprisingly bright (h_160 ~ 26 -27 mag ab) galaxy candidates at z~9-10 in the complete hst candels wfc3/irgoods-n imaging data, doubling the number of z~10 galaxy candidates that areknown, just ~500 myr after the big bang. two similarly bright sources are alsodetected in a systematic re-analysis of the goods-s data set. three of the fourgalaxies in goods-n are significantly detected at 4.5-6.2sigma in the very deepspitzer/irac 4.5 micron data, as is one of the goods-s candidates. furthermore,the brightest of our candidates (at z=10.2+-0.4) is robustly detected also at3.6 micron (6.9sigma), revealing a flat uv spectral energy distribution with aslope beta=-2.0+-0.2, consistent with demonstrated trends with luminosity athigh redshift. the abundance of such luminous candidates suggests that theluminosity function evolves more significantly in phi_* than in l_* at z&gt;~8with a higher number density of bright sources than previously expected.despite the discovery of these luminous candidates, the cosmic star formationrate density for galaxies with sfr &gt;0.7 m_sun/yr shows an order-of-magnitudeincrease in only 170 myr from z ~ 10 to z ~ 8, consistent with previousresults. based on the irac detections, we derive galaxy stellar masses at z~10,finding that these luminous objects are typically 10^9 m_sun. the cosmicstellar mass density at z~10 is log10 rho_* = 4.7^+0.5_-0.8 m_sun mpc^-3 forgalaxies brighter than m_uv~-18. the remarkable brightness, and henceluminosity, of these z~9-10 candidates highlights the opportunity for deepspectroscopy to determine their redshift and nature, demonstrates the value ofadditional search fields covering a wider area to understand star-formation inthe very early universe, and highlights the opportunities for jwst to map thebuildup of galaxies at redshifts much earlier than z~10.

0802.2713	hubble space telescope images of red mergers: how dry are they?	mergers between red galaxies are observed to be common in the nearbyuniverse, and are thought to be the dominant mechanism by which massivegalaxies grow their mass at late times. these ``dry'' mergers can be readilyidentified in very deep ground based images, thanks to their extended lowsurface brightness tidal features. however, ground-based images lack therequired resolution to determine the morphologies of the merging galaxies, andto measure the amount of dust and associated gas. we present hst/acs and wfpc2observations of a sample of 31 bulge-dominated red-sequence galaxies at z~0.1,comprised of ongoing mergers, merger remnants, and undisturbed galaxies. nearlyall galaxies have early-type morphologies and most are well-fit by r^1/4 lawsurface brightness profiles. we find that only 10% of the galaxies showevidence for the presence of dust. the amount of cold gas (or its upper limit)is calculated from the mean color-excess, assuming a simple relation betweengas mass and dust mass. the gas mass is low for all galaxies, and we find thatmgas/mstellar &lt; 3x10^-4. we infer that red mergers in the nearby universemostly involve early-type galaxies containing little cold gas and dust. thismay imply that the progenitors were mostly devoid of gas and/or that feedbackmechanisms are very effective in preventing the gas to cool. the lack of gas inthese objects may also imply a relatively large fraction of binary black holesin the centers of massive ellipticals.

1403.4295	uv luminosity functions at redshifts z~4 to z~10: 10000 galaxies from  hst legacy fields	the remarkable hst datasets from the candels, hudf09, hudf12, ers, andborg/hippies programs have allowed us to map out the evolution of the uv lffrom z~10 to z~4. we have identified 5859, 3001, 857, 481, 217, and 6 galaxycandidates at z~4, z~5, z~6, z~7, z~8, and z~10, respectively from the ~1000arcmin**2 area probed. the selection of z~4-8 galaxies over the five candelsfields allows us to assess the cosmic variance; the largest variations areapparent at z&gt;=7. our new lf determinations at z~4 and z~5 span a 6-magbaseline (-22.5 to -16 ab mag). these determinations agree well with previousestimates, but the larger samples and volumes probed here result in a morereliable sampling of &gt;l* galaxies and allow us to reassess the form of the uvlfs. our new lf results strengthen our earlier findings to 3.4 sigmasignificance for a steeper faint-end slope to the uv lf at z&gt;4, with alphaevolving from alpha=-1.64+/-0.04 at z~4 to alpha=-2.06+/-0.13 at z~7 (and alpha= -2.02+/-0.23 at z~8), consistent with that expected from the evolution of thehalo mass function. with our improved constraints at the bright end, we findless evolution in the characteristic luminosity m* over the redshift range z~4to z~7; the observed evolution in the lf is now largely represented by changesin phi*. no evidence for a non-schechter-like form to the z~4-8 lfs is found. asimple conditional lf model based on halo growth and evolution in the m/l ratioof halos ((1+z)**-1.5) provides a good representation of the observedevolution.

1404.2844	3d-hst+candels: the evolution of the galaxy size-mass distribution since  $z=3$	spectroscopic + photometric redshifts, stellar mass estimates, and rest-framecolors from the 3d-hst survey are combined with structural parametermeasurements from candels imaging to determine the galaxy size-massdistribution over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;3. separating early- and late-typegalaxies on the basis of star-formation activity, we confirm that early-typegalaxies are on average smaller than late-type galaxies at all redshifts, andfind a significantly different rate of average size evolution at fixed galaxymass, with fast evolution for the early-type population, r_eff ~ (1+z)^-1.48,and moderate evolution for the late-type population, r_eff ~ (1+z)^-0.75. thelarge sample size and dynamic range in both galaxy mass and redshift, incombination with the high fidelity of our measurements due to the extensive useof spectroscopic data, not only fortify previous results, but also enable us toprobe beyond simple average galaxy size measurements. at all redshifts theslope of the size-mass relation is shallow, r_eff ~ m_star^0.22, for late-typegalaxies with stellar mass &gt;3x10^9 m_sol, and steep, r_eff m_star^0.75, forearly-type galaxies with stellar mass &gt;2x10^10 m_sol. the intrinsic scatter is&lt;~0.2 dex for all galaxy types and redshifts. for late-type galaxies, thelogarithmic size distribution is not symmetric, but skewed toward small sizes:at all redshifts and masses a tail of small late-type galaxies exists thatoverlaps in size with the early-type galaxy population. the number density ofmassive (~10^11 m_sol), compact (r_eff &lt; 2 kpc) early-type galaxies increasesfrom z=3 to z=1.5-2 and then strongly decreases at later cosmic times.

1407.4233	geometry of star-forming galaxies from sdss, 3d-hst and candels	we determine the intrinsic, 3-dimensional shape distribution of star-forminggalaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, as inferred from their observed projected axis ratios. inthe present-day universe star-forming galaxies of all masses 1e9 - 1e11 msolare predominantly thin, nearly oblate disks, in line with previous studies. wenow extend this to higher redshifts, and find that among massive galaxies (m* &gt;1e10 msol) disks are the most common geometric shape at all z &lt; 2. lower-massgalaxies at z&gt;1 possess a broad range of geometric shapes: the fraction ofelongated (prolate) galaxies increases toward higher redshifts and lowermasses. galaxies with stellar mass 1e9 msol (1e10 msol) are a mix of roughlyequal numbers of elongated and disk galaxies at z~1 (z~2). this suggests thatgalaxies in this mass range do not yet have disks that are sustained over manyorbital periods, implying that galaxies with present-day stellar masscomparable to that of the milky way typically first formed such sustainedstellar disks at redshift z~1.5-2. combined with constraints on the evolutionof the star formation rate density and the distribution of star formation overgalaxies with different masses, our findings imply that, averaged over cosmictime, the majority of stars formed in disks.

1409.1228	first frontier field constraints on the cosmic star-formation rate  density at z~10 - the impact of lensing shear on completeness of  high-redshift galaxy samples	we search the complete hubble frontier field dataset of abell 2744 and itsparallel field for z~10 sources to further refine the evolution of the cosmicstar-formation rate density (sfrd) at z&gt;8. we independently confirm two imagesof the recently discovered triply-imaged z~9.8 source by zitrin et al. (2014)and set an upper limit for similar z~10 galaxies with red colors ofj_125-h_160&gt;1.2 in the parallel field of abell 2744. we utilize extensivesimulations to derive the effective selection volume of lyman-break galaxies atz~10, both in the lensed cluster field and in the adjacent parallel field.particular care is taken to include position-dependent lensing shear toaccurately account for the expected sizes and morphologies of highly-magnifiedsources. we show that both source blending and shear reduce the completeness ata given observed magnitude in the cluster, particularly near the criticalcurves. these effects have a significant, but largely overlooked, impact on thedetectability of high-redshift sources behind clusters, and substantiallyreduce the expected number of highly-magnified sources. the detections andlimits from both pointings result in a sfrd which is higher by 0.4+-0.4 dexthan previous estimates at z~10 from blank fields. nevertheless, thecombination of these new results with all other estimates remain consistentwith a rapidly declining sfrd in the 170 myr from z~8 to z~10 as predicted bycosmological simulations and dark-matter halo evolution in lambdacdm. oncebiases introduced by magnification-dependent completeness are accounted for,the full six cluster and parallel frontier field program will be an extremelypowerful new dataset to probe the evolution of the galaxy population at z&gt;8before the advent of the jwst.

astro-ph;0110153	a massive disk galaxy at z=1.34	we report the discovery of a rapidly rotating disk in a k-selected galaxy atz=1.34. spatially resolved kinematics are determined from deep, moderateresolution keck spectroscopy covering the redshifted [oii] 3727 line. aconservative estimate of the maximum rotation velocity v_max = 290 +- 20 km/s,placing the galaxy among the most rapid rotators known. an hst wfpc2 imagetaken in the f814w filter (rest-frame u) shows that the [oii] emissionoriginates in a ring of star forming regions ~3'' (~20 kpc) across. in thek-band the galaxy is compact, and its position coincides with the center of thestar forming ring seen in the rest-frame near-uv. the galaxy has m_v = -22.4 +-0.2 (~3 l*) in the rest-frame, and its spectral energy distribution is verywell fitted by that of a redshifted sb/c galaxy. the observed kinematics,morphology, and spectral energy distribution are consistent with a massivebulge-disk system at z=1.34. the lower limit on v_max gives an upper limit onthe offset from the present-day tully-fisher relation. the galaxy isoverluminous by less than 0.7 +- 0.4 magnitudes in rest-frame v, consistentwith previous studies of disk galaxies at lower redshift. taken together, theseresults suggest that some of the most luminous spiral galaxies in the nearbyuniverse were already in place ~10^10 yr ago, placing a constraint on modelsfor their formation.

astro-ph;0211566	the fundamental plane and the evolution of the m/l ratio of early-type  field galaxies up to z~1	we analyse the fundamental plane (fp) of 26 strong gravitational lensgalaxies with redshifts up to z~1, using tabulated data from kochanek et al.(2000) and rusin et al. (2003). the lens galaxies effectively form amass-selected sample of early-type galaxies in environments of relatively lowdensity. we analyse the fp and its evolution in the restframe johnson b andgunn r bands. assuming that early-type galaxies are a homologous family, the fpthen provides a direct measurement of the m/l ratio evolution. if we assumethat the m/l ratios of field early-type galaxies evolve as power-laws, we findfor the lens galaxies an evolution rate dlog(m/l)/dz of -0.62 +/-0.13 inrestframe b, corresponding to a mean stellar formation redshift of &lt;z*&gt;=1.8(-0.5/+1.4). this formation epoch does not differ significantly from that ofcluster galaxies &lt;z*cl&gt;=2.0 (-0.2/+0.3), obtained by van dokkum &amp; franx (2001)after correction for maximum progenitor bias. however, if we impose theconstraint that lens and cluster galaxies that are of the same age have equalm/l ratios and we do not correct for progenitor bias, we find that the stellarpopulations of the lens galaxies are 10-15 % younger. we find that both the m/lratios as well as the restframe colors of the lens galaxies show significantscatter. about half of the lens galaxies are consistent with an oldcluster-like stellar populations, but the other galaxies are bluer and best fitby single burst models with younger stellar formation redshifts as low as z*~1.moreover, the scatter in color is correlated with the scatter in m/l ratio. weinterpret this as evidence of a significant age spread among the stellarpopulations of lens galaxies, whereas the ages of the stellar populations ofthe cluster galaxies are well approximated by a single formation epoch.

astro-ph;0312230	the fundamental plane of field early type galaxies at z=1	we present deep vlt spectra of early type galaxies at z~1 in the chandra deepfield south, from which we derive velocity dispersions. together withstructural parameters from hubble space telescope imaging, we can study thefundamental plane for field early type galaxies at that epoch. we determineaccurate mass-to-light ratios and colors for four field early type galaxies inthe redshift range 0.96&lt;z&lt;1.14, and two with 0.65&lt;z&lt;0.70.  the galaxies were selected by color and morphology, and have generally redcolors. their velocity dispersions show, however, that they have a considerablespread in mass-to-light ratios (factor of 3). we find that the colors anddirectly measured mass-to-light ratios correlate well, demonstrating that thespread in mass-to-light ratios is real and reflects variations in stellarpopulations.  the most massive galaxies have mass-to-light ratios comparable to massivecluster galaxies at similar redshift, and therefore have stellar populationswhich formed at high redshift (z&gt;2). the lower mass galaxies at z~1 have alower average mass-to-light ratio, and one is a genuine 'e+a' galaxy. themass-to-light ratios indicate that their luminosity weighted ages are a factorof three younger at the epoch of observation, due to either a late formationredshift, or due to late bursts of star formation contributing 20-30% of themass.

astro-ph;0312594	the detailed optical light curve of grb 030329	(abridged) we present densely sampled bvri light curves of the opticaltransient associated with the gamma-ray burst grb 030329, the result of acoordinated observing campaign conducted at five observatories. augmented withpublished observations of this grb, the compiled optical dataset contains 2687photometric measurements, obtained between 78 minutes and 79 days after theburst. we show that the underlying supernova 2003dh evolved faster than, andwas probably somewhat fainter than the type ic sn 1998bw, associated with grb980425. we find that our data can be described by a broken power-law decayperturbed by a complex variable component. the early- and late-time decayslopes are determined to be ~1.1 and ~2, respectively. assuming this singlepower-law model, we constrain the break to lie between ~3 and ~8 days after theburst. this simple, singly-broken power-law model, derived only from theanalysis of our optical observations, may also account for available multi-banddata, provided that the break happened ~8 days after the burst. the morecomplex double-jet model of berger et al. provides a comparable fit to theoptical, x-ray, mm and radio observations of this event. we detect asignificant change in optical colors during the first day. our color analysisis consistent with a cooling break frequency sweeping through the optical bandduring the first day. the light curves of grb 030329 reveal a rich array ofvariations, superposed over the mean power-law decay. we find that the earlyvariations are asymmetric, with a steep rise followed by a relatively slower(by a factor of about two) decline. the variations maintain a similar timescale during the first four days, and then get significantly longer.

astro-ph;0502082	gemini near infrared spectrograph observations of a red star forming  galaxy at z=2.225: evidence for shock-ionization due to a galactic wind	recent studies have shown that k-luminous galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;2.5 have highhalpha line widths and high [nii]/halpha ratios. if these lines arise fromphoto-ionization by massive stars in hii regions these results imply thatmassive, metal rich galaxies exist at high redshift. here we investigate theionization mechanism in a galaxy with ks=19.1 and z=2.225 in the chandra deepfield south, using the new gemini near infrared spectrograph (gnirs). gnirs'cross-dispersed mode gives simultaneous access to the entire 1-2.5 micronwavelength range, allowing accurate measurements of line ratios of distantgalaxies. from the ratio of halpha/hbeta we infer that the line emitting gas isheavily obscured, with e(b-v)=0.8. the reddening is higher than that inferredpreviously from the uv-optical continuum emission, consistent with findings fornearby star burst galaxies. we find that the galaxy has seyfert-like lineratios, [nii]/halpha ~ 0.6 and [oiii]/hbeta ~ 6, which can be caused byphoto-ionization by an active galactic nucleus (agn) or shock ionization due toa strong galactic wind. although we cannot exclude the presence of an agn, thelack of agn spectral features in the rest-frame ultraviolet, the consistency ofradio, x-ray, and rest-frame uv star formation indicators, the fact that the[oiii]/hbeta ratio remains high out to ~10 kpc from the nucleus, and theobserved gas kinematics all argue for the wind hypothesis. similarshock-induced ionization is seen in nearby star burst galaxies with strongwinds. the evidence for shock ionization implies that measurements ofmetallicities and dynamical masses of star forming z&gt;2 galaxies should beregarded with caution, especially since the existence of strong galactic windsin these objects is well established.

astro-ph;0510186	faint infrared extragalactic survey: data and source catalogue of the  ms1054-03 field	we present deep near-infrared js, h, and ks band imaging of a field aroundms1054-03, a massive cluster at z=0.83. the observations were carried out withisaac at the eso vlt as part of the faint infrared extragalactic survey(fires). the total integration time amounts to 25.9h in js, 24.4h in h, and26.5h in ks, divided nearly equally between four pointings covering 5.5'x5.3'.the 3-sigma total limiting ab magnitudes for point sources from the shallowestto deepest pointing are js=26.0-26.2, h=25.5-25.8, and ks=25.3-25.7. theeffective spatial resolution of the coadded images has fwhm=0.48", 0.46", and0.52" in js, h, and ks. we complemented the isaac data with deep opticalimaging using existing hst wfpc2 mosaics in the f606w and f814w filters and newu, b and v band data from vlt fors1. we constructed a ks-band limitedmulticolour source catalogue to ks(total,ab)=25 (about 5-sigma for pointsources). the catalogue contains 1858 objects, of which 1663 have eight-bandphotometry. we describe the observations, data reduction, source detection andphotometric measurements method. we present the number counts, colourdistributions, and photometric redshifts z_ph of the catalogue sources. we findthat our counts at the faint end 22&lt;ks(ab)&lt;25, with slope dlog(n)/dm=0.20, lieat the flatter end of published counts in other deep fields and are consistentwith those we derived in the hdf-south, the other fires field. spectroscopicredshifts z_sp are available for about 330 sources in the ms1054-03 field;comparison between the z_ph and z_sp shows very good agreement, with&lt;|z_sp-z_ph|/(1+z_sp)&gt;=0.078. the ms1054-03 field observations complement ourhdf-south data set with nearly five times larger area at about 0.7 brightermagnitudes.

astro-ph;0511581	the evolution of rest-frame k-band properties of early-type galaxies  from z=1 to the present	we measure the evolution of the rest-frame k-band fundamental plane from z=1to the present by using irac imaging of a sample of early-type galaxies in thechandra deep field-south at z~1 with accurately measured dynamical masses. wefind that $m/l_k$ evolves as $\delta\ln{(m/l_k)}=(-1.18\pm0.10)z$, which isslower than in the b-band ($\delta\ln{(m/l_b)}=(-1.46\pm0.09)z$). in the b-bandthe evolution has been demonstrated to be strongly mass dependent. in thek-band we find a weaker trend: galaxies more massive than$m=2\times10^{11}m_{\odot}$ evolve as $\delta\ln{(m/l_k)}=(-1.01\pm0.16)z$;less massive galaxies evolve as $\delta\ln{(m/l_k)}=(-1.27\pm0.11)z$. asexpected from stellar population models the evolution in $m/l_k$ is slower thanthe evolution in $m/l_b$. however, when we make a quantitative comparison, wefind that the single burst bruzual-charlot models do not fit the results well,unless large dust opacities are allowed at z=1. models with a flat imf fitbetter, maraston models with a different treatment of agb stars fit best. theseresults show that the interpretation of rest-frame near-ir photometry isseverely hampered by model uncertainties and therefore that the determinationof galaxy masses from rest-frame near-ir photometry may be harder than wasthought before.

astro-ph;0606642	line strengths in early-type cluster galaxies at z=0.33: implications  for alpha/fe, nitrogen and the histories of e/s0s	[heavily abbreviated] in this paper we analyze previously published spectrawith high signal-to-noise ratios of e/s0 galaxies in the rich cluster cl1358+62at z=0.33, and introduce techniques for fitting stellar population models tothe data. here we focus on the 19 e and s0 galaxies with an homogeneous set ofeight blue lick indices. we explore the galaxy properties using six-parameterstellar population models from the literature, and describe an approach forfitting the models differentially, such that the largest systematic errors areavoided. we find: (1) no differences between the stellar population parametersof es and s0s, at fixed sigma; (2) the stars in the es and s0s are uniformlyold, consistent with previously published results using m/l ratios; (3) asignificant correlation of [z/h] with sigma, in a manner consistent with theobserved b-v colors of the galaxies; (4) no significant correlation of[alpha/fe] with sigma; and (5) a significant anti-correlation of [alpha/n] with[z/h], which we interpret as the signature of secondary nitrogen. neither[alpha/c], nor [alpha/ca] shows significant variation. while the differencesbetween our conclusions and the current view of stellar populations may pointto serious deficiencies, our deduced correlation of mean metallicity with sigmadoes reproduce the b-v colors of the galaxies, as well as the slope of thelocal mg-sigma relation. in matching the inferred population trends withpublished data on nearby galaxies, the line strength-line width relations matchwell, save for the narrow iron indices. taken together, these results reduceearly-type galaxies in clusters to a family with one-parameter, velocitydispersion, greatly simplifying scenarios for their formation and evolution.

astro-ph;0608678	could grb 060614 and its presumed host galaxy be a chance superposition?	the lack of an observed supernova associated with grb 060614 appears torequire a new paradigm for the formation of (a subset of) long-duration grbs.this requirement is based on the presumed low redshift of the burst, which wasinferred from the spatial coincidence of the afterglow with a z=0.125 galaxy.we explore the possibility that this low-redshift galaxy is a chancesuperposition along the line of sight to grb 060614. we examine the galaxydistribution of the field of grb 060614 and find that the probability of achance association with a galaxy at least as bright as the putative host isonly ~ 0.5 - 1.9%. however, for the current ensemble of ~180 swift grbs it islikely that several such coincidences have occurred, and given the"non-standard" nature of grb 060614 it is not implausible that this is one suchoccurrence. thus the conclusion that grb 060614 requires a revision to theformation paradigm for long-duration grbs should be approached with caution.

astro-ph;0612454	spectroscopy of z~6 i-dropout galaxies: frequency of ly-alpha emission  and the sizes of ly-alpha emitting galaxies	we report on deep spectroscopy using lris on keck i and fors2 on the vlt of asample of 22 candidate z~6 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) selected by the i-z&gt; 1.3dropout criterion. redshifts could be measured for eight objects. theseredshifts are all in the range z = 5.5 - 6.1, confirming the efficiency of thei-z color selection technique. six of the confirmed galaxies show ly-alphaemission. assuming that the 14 objects without redshifts are z~6 lbgs, but lackdetectable ly-alpha emission lines, we infer that the fraction of ly-alphaemitting lbgs with ly-alpha equivalent widths greater than 20 angstroms amongz~6 lbgs is ~30%, similar to that found at z~3. every ly-alpha emitting objectin our sample is compact with r &lt;= 0.14". furthermore, all the ly-alphaemitting objects in our sample are more compact than average relative to theobserved size-magnitude relation of a large i-dropout sample (332 candidate z~6objects). we can reject the hypothesis that the ly-alpha emitting population isa subset of the rest of the z~6 lbg population at &gt;97% confidence. we speculatethe small sizes of ly-alpha emitting lbgs are due to these objects being lessmassive than other lbgs at z~6.

astro-ph;9507101	dust in the cores of early-type galaxies	the dust properties of all early-type galaxies imaged with the planetarycamera of the hst in cycles i-iii are examined. dust is detected in 31 out of64 galaxies, although the sample is biased against the detection of dust. fromthe distribution of observed axis ratios of the dust features it is inferredthat 78 \pm 16% of early-type galaxies contain nuclear dust. from thedependence of the angle between dust major axis and galaxy major axis on sizeand appearance of the dust, it is found that dust features with semi-major axissize a_d &gt; 250 pc are generally not settled. if it is assumed that dust laneswith a_d &lt; 250 pc are in equilibrium in the galaxy potential, the observeddistribution of misalignment angles can only be explained if ellipticalgalaxies have a mean triaxiality &lt;t&gt; &gt;= 0.4. the best fit is obtained for &lt;t&gt; =0.8, higher than values derived through other methods. this difference cannotbe explained by a dependence of $\langle t \rangle$ on radius. therefore, itseems dust is not always completely relaxed, even on the smallest scales.furthermore, the rotation axis of the dust does not generally coincide withthat of the stars. this seems to suggest that the dust is acquired fromoutside, and has some way of losing its angular momentum efficiently.

astro-ph;9902272	the afterglow, the redshift, and the extreme energetics of the gamma-ray  burst 990123	afterglow, or long-lived emission, has now been detected from about a dozenwell-positioned gamma-ray bursts. distance determinations made by measuringoptical emission lines from the host galaxy, or absorption lines in theafterglow spectrum, place the burst sources at significant cosmologicaldistances, with redshifts ranging from ~1--3. the energy required to producethe bright gamma-ray flashes is enormous: up to ~10^{53} erg or 10 percent ofthe rest mass energy of a neutron star, if the emission is isotropic. here wepresent the discovery of the optical afterglow and the redshift of grb 990123,the brightest well-localized grb to date. with our measured redshift of &gt;1.6,the inferred isotropic energy release exceeds the rest mass of a neutron starthereby challenging current theoretical models for the origin of grbs. we arguethat the optical and ir afterglow measurements reported here may provide thefirst observational evidence of beaming in a grb, thereby reducing the requiredenergetics to a level where stellar death models are still tenable.

astro-ph;9910249	luminous red mergers in the z=0.83 cluster ms1054-03: direct evidence  for hierarchical formation of massive early-type galaxies	we present results from a morphological study of the distant x-ray clusterms1054-03 at z=0.83. we have obtained a large, two color hst wfpc2 mosaic ofthis cluster, and measured redshifts of 186 galaxies in the ms1054-03 fieldwith the 10m keck telescope. of 81 spectroscopically confirmed cluster galaxiesobserverd with hst, 13 are merger systems. most of these mergers will likelyevolve into luminous elliptical galaxies, and some may evolve into s0 galaxies.if the galaxy population in ms1054-03 is typical for its redshift up to 50% ofellipticals may have formed in mergers at z&lt;1. the mergers are generally redand have no detected oii 3727 emission. this result is consistent with the oldstellar ages of ellipticals inferred from other studies. the mergers arepreferentially found towards the outskirts of the cluster, indicating theyprobably occur in infalling clumps. a significant overabundance of close pairsof red galaxies detected in the outskirts of ms1054-03 confirms the largenumber of interacting galaxies in this cluster.

astro-ph;9911353	a high fraction of mergers in the cluster ms1054-03 at z=0.83	we used the hubble space telescope to take a wide field, multicolor image ofthe high redshift cluster ms1054-03 at z=0.83. the keck telescope was used totake 200 redshifts in the field. we have a total of 81 spectroscopicallyconfirmed cluster members with deep wfpc2 imaging. a surprisingly large numberof these cluster members are mergers: 13 out of 77 galaxies are classified asmerger remnants, or mergers in progress. most of these are red, and massive.their restframe b luminosities are amongst the brightest in the cluster: wefind that 5 out of the brightest 16 are mergers. no such bright mergers werefound in a lower redshift cluster with similar wide field coverage. the mergersin ms1054-03 are preferentially found in the outskirts of the cluster. thedistribution of pairs in the outskirts of the cluster shows an excess ofgalaxies with separation &lt; 10 h^-1 kpc, which is independent confirmation ofthe enhanced interaction rate. the fraction of mergers (17 %) is comparable tothe fraction of ellipticals (22 %). hence up to 50 % of low redshiftellipticals may have formed through mergers since z=1. there is no evidence forstrong star formation in most of the mergers. the mean stellar ages of themergers may therefore be much older than the ``assembly age'', i.e., the agesince the time the system was put together. these new results are qualitativelyconsistent with predictions from hierarchical galaxy formation, and areinconsistent with an early collapse for all early type galaxies.
