0901.3553	the impact of inhomogeneous reionization on the satellite galaxy  population of the milky way	we use the publicly available subhalo catalogs from the via lactea simulationalong with a gpc-scale n-body simulation to understand the impact ofinhomogeneous reionization on the satellite galaxy population of the milky way.the large-volume simulation is combined with a model for reionization thatallows us to predict the distribution of reionization times for milky way masshalos. motivated by this distribution, we identify candidate satellite galaxiesin the simulation by requiring that any subhalo must grow above a specifiedmass threshold before it is reionized; after this time the photoionizingbackground will suppress both the formation of stars and the accretion of gas.we show that varying the reionization time over the range expected for milkyway mass halos can change the number of satellite galaxies by roughly twoorders of magnitude. this conclusion is in contradiction with a number ofstudies in the literature, and we conclude that this is a result ofinconsistent application of the results of gnedin (2000). we compare oursatellite galaxies to observations using both abundance matching and stellarpopulation synthesis methods to assign luminosities to our subhalos and accountfor observational completeness effects. additionally, if we assume that themass threshold is set by the virial temperature tvir = 8e3k we find that ourmodel accurately matches the vmax distribution, radial distribution, andluminosity function of observed milky way satellites for a reionization timezreion = 9.6^{1.0}_{-2.1}, assuming that the via lacteasubhalo distribution isrepresentative of the milky way. this results in the presence of119^{+202}_{-50} satellite galaxies.

0908.4129	outflow feedback regulated massive star formation in parsec-scale  cluster forming clumps	(abridged) we investigate massive star formation in turbulent, magnetized,parsec-scale clumps of molecular clouds including protostellar outflow feedbackusing enzo-based mhd simulations with accreting sink particles and effectiveresolution $2048^3$. we find that, in the absence of regulation by magneticfields and outflow feedback, massive stars form readily in a turbulent,moderately condensed clump of $\sim 1,600$ solar masses, along with a clusterof hundreds of lower mass stars. the massive stars are fed at high rates by (1)transient dense filaments produced by large-scale turbulent compression atearly times, and (2) by the clump-wide global collapse resulting fromturbulence decay at late times. in both cases, the bulk of the massive star'smass is supplied from outside a 0.1 pc-sized "core" that surrounds the star. inour simulation, the massive star is clump-fed rather than core-fed. the needfor large-scale feeding makes the massive star formation prone to regulation byoutflow feedback, which directly opposes the feeding processes. the outflowsreduce the mass accretion rates onto the massive stars by breaking up the densefilaments that feed the massive star formation at early times, and bycollectively slowing down the global collapse that fuel the massive starformation at late times. the latter is aided by a moderate magnetic field ofstrength in the observed range. we conclude that the massive star formation inour simulated turbulent, magnetized, parsec-scale clump is outflow-regulatedand clump-fed (orcf for short). an important implication is that the formationof low-mass stars in a dense clump can affect the formation of massive stars inthe same clump, through their outflow feedback on the clump dynamics.

0909.0513	computational eulerian hydrodynamics and galilean invariance	eulerian hydrodynamical simulations are a powerful and popular tool formodeling fluids in astrophysical systems. in this work, we critically examinerecent claims that these methods violate galilean invariance of the eulerequations. we demonstrate that eulerian hydrodynamics methods do converge to agalilean-invariant solution, provided a well-defined convergent solutionexists. specifically, we show that numerical diffusion, resulting fromdiffusion-like terms in the discretized hydrodynamical equations solved byeulerian methods, accounts for the effects previously identified as evidencefor the galilean non-invariance of these methods. these velocity-dependentdiffusive terms lead to different results for different bulk velocities whenthe spatial resolution of the simulation is kept fixed, but their effectbecomes negligible as the resolution of the simulation is increased to obtain aconverged solution. in particular, we find that kelvin-helmholtz instabilitiesdevelop properly in realistic eulerian calculations regardless of the bulkvelocity provided the problem is simulated with sufficient resolution (a factorof 2-4 increase compared to the case without bulk flows for realisticvelocities). our results reiterate that high-resolution eulerian methods canperform well and obtain a convergent solution, even in the presence of highlysupersonic bulk flows.

0707.2059	suppression of h_2 cooling in the ultraviolet background	the first luminous objects in the concordance cosmology form by molecularhydrogen cooling in dark matter dominated halos of masses ~10^6 m_sun. we useeulerian adaptive mesh refinement simulations to demonstrate that in thepresence of a large soft ultraviolet radiation background, molecular hydrogenis the dominant coolant. even for very large radiation backgrounds, the halomasses that cool and collapse are up to two orders of magnitude smaller thanthe halos that cool via atomic hydrogen line cooling. the abundance of coolinghalos and the cosmic mass fraction contained within them depends exponentiallyon this critical mass scale. consequently, the majority of current models ofcosmological reionization, chemical evolution, supermassive black holeformation, and galaxy formation underestimate the number of star formingprogenitors of a given system by orders of magnitude. at the highest redshifts,this disagreement is largest. we also show that even in the absence of residualelectrons, collisional ionization in central shocks create a sufficient amountof electrons to form molecular hydrogen and cool the gas in halos of virialtemperatures far below the atomic cooling limit.

1003.6132	the effect of absorption systems on cosmic reionization	we use large-scale simulations to investigate the morphology of reionizationduring the final, overlap phase. our method uses an efficient three-dimensionalsmoothing technique which takes into account the finite mean free path due toabsorption systems, lambda, by only smoothing over scales r_s&lt;lambda. the largedynamic range of our calculations is necessary to resolve the neutral patchesleft at the end of reionization within a representative volume; we find thatsimulation volumes exceeding several hundred mpc on a side are necessary inorder to properly model reionization when the neutral fraction is ~0.01-0.3.our results indicate a strong dependence of percolation morphology on a largeand uncertain region of model parameter space. the single most importantparameter is the mean free path to absorption systems, which serve as opaquebarriers to ionizing radiation. if these absorption systems were as abundant assome realistic estimates indicate, the spatial structure of the overlap phaseis considerably more complex than previously predicted. in view of the lack ofconstraints on the mean free path at the highest redshifts, current theoriesthat do not include absorption by lyman-limit systems, and in particularthree-dimensional simulations, may underestimate the abundance of neutralclouds at the end of reionization. this affects predictions for the 21 cmsignal associated with reionization, interpretation of absorption features inquasar spectra at z ~5-6, the connection between reionization and the localuniverse, and constraints on the patchiness and duration of reionization fromtemperature fluctuations measured in the cosmic microwave background arisingfrom the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect.

1008.0409	lowering the characteristic mass of cluster stars by magnetic fields and  outflow feedback	magnetic fields are generally expected to increase the characteristic mass ofstars formed in stellar clusters, because they tend to increase the effectivejeans mass. we test this expectation using adaptive mesh refinement (amr)magnetohydrodynamic simulations of cluster formation in turbulent magnetizedclumps of molecular clouds, treating stars as accreting sink particles. we findthat, contrary to the common expectation, a magnetic field of strength in theobserved range decreases, rather than increases, the characteristic stellarmass. it (1) reduces the number of intermediate-mass stars that are formedthrough direct turbulent compression, because sub-regions of the clump withmasses comparable to those of stars are typically magnetically subcritical andcannot be compressed directly into collapse, and (2) increases the number oflow-mass stars that are produced from the fragmentation of dense filaments. thefilaments result from mass accumulation along the field lines. in order tobecome magnetically supercritical and fragment, the filament must accumulate alarge enough column density (proportional to the field strength), which yieldsa high volume density (and thus a small thermal jeans mass) that is conduciveto forming low-mass stars. we find, in addition, that the characteristicstellar mass is reduced further by outflow feedback. the conclusion is thatboth magnetic fields and outflow feedback are important in shaping the stellarinitial mass function (imf).

1206.1043	the birth of a galaxy. ii. the role of radiation pressure	massive stars provide feedback that shapes the interstellar medium ofgalaxies at all redshifts and their resulting stellar populations. here wepresent three adaptive mesh refinement radiation hydrodynamics simulations thatillustrate the impact of momentum transfer from ionising radiation to theabsorbing gas on star formation in high-redshift dwarf galaxies. momentumtransfer is calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation with a raytracing algorithm that is adaptive in spatial and angular coordinates. we findthat momentum input partially affects star formation by increasing theturbulent support to a three-dimensional rms velocity equal to the circularvelocity of early haloes. compared to a calculation that neglects radiationpressure, the star formation rate is decreased by a factor of five to 1.8 x10^{-2} msun/yr in a dwarf galaxy with a dark matter and stellar mass of 2.0 x10^8 and 4.5 x 10^5 solar masses, respectively, when radiation pressure isincluded. its mean metallicity of 10^{-2.1} z_sun is consistent with theobserved dwarf galaxy luminosity-metallicity relation. however, what one maynaively expect from the calculation without radiation pressure, the centralregion of the galaxy overcools and produces a compact, metal-rich stellarpopulation with an average metallicity of 0.3 z_sun, indicative of an incorrectphysical recipe. in addition to photo-heating in hii regions, radiationpressure further drives dense gas from star forming regions, so supernovaefeedback occurs in a warmer and more diffuse medium, launching metal-richoutflows. capturing this aspect and a temporal separation between the start ofradiative and supernova feedback are numerically important in the modeling ofgalaxies to avoid the "overcooling problem". we estimate that dust in earlylow-mass galaxies is unlikely to aid in momentum transfer from radiation to thegas.

1210.3361	dwarf galaxies with ionizing radiation feedback. i: escape of ionizing  photons	we describe a new method for simulating ionizing radiation and supernovafeedback in the analogues of low-redshift galactic disks. in this method, whichwe call star-forming molecular cloud (sfmc) particles, we use a ray-tracingtechnique to solve the radiative transfer equation for ultraviolet photonsemitted by thousands of distinct particles on the fly. joined with highnumerical resolution of 3.8 pc, the realistic description of stellar feedbackhelps to self-regulate star formation. this new feedback scheme also enables usto study the escape of ionizing photons from star-forming clumps and from agalaxy, and to examine the evolving environment of star-forming gas clumps. bysimulating a galactic disk in a halo of 2.3e11 msun, we find that the averageescape fraction from all radiating sources on the spiral arms (excluding thecentral 2.5 kpc) fluctuates between 0.08% and 5.9% during a ~20 myr period witha mean value of 1.1%. the flux of escaped photons from these sources is notstrongly beamed, but manifests a large opening angle of more than 60 degreefrom the galactic pole. further, we investigate the escape fraction per sfmcparticle, f_esc(i), and how it evolves as the particle ages. we discover thatthe average escape fraction f_esc is dominated by a small number of sfmcparticles with high f_esc(i). on average, the escape fraction from a sfmcparticle rises from 0.27% at its birth to 2.1% at the end of a particlelifetime, 6 myrs. this is because sfmc particles drift away from the dense gasclumps in which they were born, and because the gas around the star-formingclumps is dispersed by ionizing radiation and supernova feedback. the frameworkestablished in this study brings deeper insight into the physics of photonescape fraction from an individual star-forming clump, and from a galacticdisk.

1210.6652	a new approach to simulating collisionless dark matter fluids	recently, we have shown how current cosmological n-body codes already followthe fine grained phase-space information of the dark matter fluid. using atetrahedral tesselation of the three-dimensional manifold that describesperfectly cold fluids in six-dimensional phase space, the phase-spacedistribution function can be followed throughout the simulation. this allowsone to project the distribution function into configuration space to obtainhighly accurate densities, velocities, and velocity dispersions. here, weexploit this technique to show first steps on how to devise an improvedparticle-mesh technique. at its heart, the new method thus relies on apiecewise linear approximation of the phase space distribution function ratherthan the usual particle discretisation. we use pseudo-particles thatapproximate the masses of the tetrahedral cells up to quadrupolar order as thelocations for cloud-in-cell (cic) deposit instead of the particle locationsthemselves as in standard cic deposit. we demonstrate that this modificationalready gives much improved stability and more accurate dynamics of thecollisionless dark matter fluid at high force and low mass resolution. wedemonstrate the validity and advantages of this method with various testproblems as well as hot/warm-dark matter simulations which have been known toexhibit artificial fragmentation. this completely unphysical behaviour is muchreduced in the new approach. the current limitations of our approach arediscussed in detail and future improvements are outlined.

1210.6988	dwarf galaxies with ionizing radiation feedback. ii: spatially-resolved  star formation relation	we investigate the spatially-resolved star formation relation using agalactic disk formed in a comprehensive high-resolution (3.8 pc) simulation.our new implementation of stellar feedback includes ionizing radiation as wellas supernova explosions, and we handle ionizing radiation by solving theradiative transfer equation rather than by a subgrid model. photoheating bystellar radiation stabilizes gas against jeans fragmentation, reducing the starformation rate. because we have self-consistently calculated the location ofionized gas, we are able to make spatially-resolved mock observations of starformation tracers, such as h-alpha emission. we can also observe how stellarfeedback manifests itself in the correlation between ionized and molecular gas.applying our techniques to the disk in a galactic halo of 2.3e11 msun, we findthat the correlation between star formation rate density (estimated from mockh-alpha emission) and molecular hydrogen density shows large scatter,especially at high resolutions of &lt;~ 75 pc that are comparable to the size ofgiant molecular clouds (gmcs). this is because an aperture of gmc size capturesonly particular stages of gmc evolution, and because h-alpha traces hot gasaround star-forming regions and is displaced from the molecular hydrogen peaksthemselves. by examining the evolving environment around star clusters, wespeculate that the breakdown of the traditional star formation laws of thekennicutt-schmidt type at small scales is further aided by a combination ofstars drifting from their birthplaces, and molecular clouds being dispersed viastellar feedback.

1212.3333	single-pass gpu-raycasting for structured adaptive mesh refinement data	structured adaptive mesh refinement (samr) is a popular numerical techniqueto study processes with high spatial and temporal dynamic range. it reducescomputational requirements by adapting the lattice on which the underlyingdifferential equations are solved to most efficiently represent the solution.particularly in astrophysics and cosmology such simulations now can capturespatial scales ten orders of magnitude apart and more. the irregular locationsand extensions of the refined regions in the samr scheme and the fact thatdifferent resolution levels partially overlap, poses a challenge for gpu-baseddirect volume rendering methods. kd-trees have proven to be advantageous tosubdivide the data domain into non-overlapping blocks of equally sized cells,optimal for the texture units of current graphics hardware, but previousgpu-supported raycasting approaches for samr data using this data structurerequired a separate rendering pass for each node, preventing the application ofmany advanced lighting schemes that require simultaneous access to more thanone block of cells. in this paper we present a single-pass gpu-raycastingalgorithm for samr data that is based on a kd-tree. the tree is efficientlyencoded by a set of 3d-textures, which allows to adaptively sample completerays entirely on the gpu without any cpu interaction. we discuss two differentdata storage strategies to access the grid data on the gpu and apply them toseveral datasets to prove the benefits of the proposed method.

1301.7426	how closely do baryons follow dark matter on large scales?	we investigate the large-scale clustering and gravitational interaction ofbaryons and dark matter (dm) over cosmic time using a set of collisionlessn-body simulations. both components, baryons and dm, are evolved from distinctprimordial density and velocity power spectra as predicted by early-universephysics. we first demonstrate that such two-component simulations require anunconventional match between force and mass resolution (i.e. force softening onat least the mean particle separation scale). otherwise, the growth on anyscale is not correctly recovered because of a spurious coupling between the twospecies at the smallest scales. with these simulations, we then demonstrate howthe primordial differences in the clustering of baryons and dm areprogressively diminished over time. in particular, we explicitly show how thebao signature is damped in the spatial distribution of baryons and imprinted inthat of dm. this is a rapid process, yet it is still not fully completed at lowredshifts. on large scales, the overall shape of the correlation function ofbaryons and dm differs by 2% at z = 9 and by 0.2% at z = 0. the differences inthe amplitude of the bao peak are approximately a factor of 5 larger: 10% at z= 9 and 1% at z = 0. these discrepancies are, however, smaller than effectsexpected to be introduced by galaxy formation physics in both the shape of thepower spectrum and in the bao peak, and are thus unlikely to be detected giventhe precision of the next generation of galaxy surveys. hence, our resultsvalidate the standard practice of modelling the observed galaxy distributionusing predictions for the total mass clustering in the universe.

1304.2406	the warm dm halo mass function below the cut-off scale	warm dark matter (wdm) cosmologies are a viable alternative to the cold darkmatter (cdm) scenario. unfortunately, an accurate scrutiny of the wdmpredictions with n-body simulations has proven difficult due to numericalartefacts. here, we report on cosmological simulations that, for the firsttime, are devoid of those problems, and thus, are able to accurately resolvethe wdm halo mass function well below the cut-off. we discover a complexpicture, with perturbations at different evolutionary stages populatingdifferent ranges in the halo mass function. on the smallest mass scales we canresolve, identified objects are typically centres of filaments that arestarting to collapse. on intermediate mass scales, objects typically correspondto fluctuations that have collapsed and are in the process of relaxation,whereas the high mass end is dominated by objects similar to haloes identifiedin cdm simulations. we then explicitly show how the formation of low-masshaloes is suppressed, which translates into a strong cut-off in the halo massfunction. this disfavours some analytic formulations that predict a halo massfunction that would extend well below the free streaming mass. we argue for amore detailed exploration of the formation of the smallest structures expectedto form in a given cosmology, which, we foresee, will advance our overallunderstanding of structure formation.

1306.2971	reionization histories of milky way mass halos	we investigate the connection between the epoch of reionization and thepresent day universe, by examining the extended mass reionization histories ofdark matter halos identified at z=0. we combine an n-body dark mattersimulation of a 600 mpc volume with a three-dimensional, seminumericalreionization model. this provides reionization redshifts for each particle,which can then be connected with the properties of their halos at the presenttime. we find that the vast majority of present-day halos with masses largerthan ~ few x 10^11 msun reionize earlier than the rest of the universe. we alsofind significant halo-to-halo diversity in mass reionization histories, andfind that in realistic inhomogenous models, the material within a given halo isnot expected to reionize at the same time. in particular, the scatter inreionization times within individual halos is typically larger than the scatteramong halos. from our fiducial reionization model, we find that the typical 68%scatter in reionization times within halos is ~ 115 myr for 10^(12 \pm 0.25)msun halos, decreasing slightly to ~ 95 myr for 10^(15 \pm 0.25) msun halos. wefind a mild correlation between reionization history and environment: haloswith shorter reionization histories are typically in more clusteredenvironments, with the strongest trend on a scale of ~ 20 mpc. material inmilky way mass halos with short reionization histories is preferentiallyreionized in relatively large hii regions, implying reionization mostly bysources external to the progenitors of the present-day halo. we investigate theimpact on our results of varying the reionization model parameters, which spana range of reionization scenarios with varying timing and morphology.

1404.2280	the properties of cosmic velocity fields	understanding the velocity field is very important for modern cosmology: itgives insights to structure formation in general, and also its properties arecrucial ingredients in modelling redshift-space distortions and in interpretingmeasurements of the kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect. unfortunately,characterising the velocity field in cosmological n-body simulations isinherently complicated by two facts: i) the velocity field becomes manifestlymulti-valued after shell-crossing and has discontinuities at caustics. this isdue to the collisionless nature of dark matter. ii) n-body simulations samplethe velocity field only at a set of discrete locations, with poor resolution inlow-density regions. in this paper, we discuss how the associated problems canbe circumvented by using a phase-space interpolation technique. this methodprovides extremely accurate estimates of the cosmic velocity fields and itsderivatives, which can be properly defined without the need of the arbitrary"coarse-graining" procedure commonly used. we explore in detail theconfiguration-space properties of the cosmic velocity field on very largescales and in the highly nonlinear regime. in particular, we characterise thedivergence and curl of the velocity field, present their one-point statistics,analyse the fourier-space properties and provide fitting formulae for thevelocity divergence bias relative to the non-linear matter power spectrum. wefurthermore contrast some of the interesting differences in the velocity fieldsof warm and cold dark matter models. we anticipate that the high-precisionmeasurements carried out here will help to understand in detail the dynamics ofdark matter and the structures it forms.

astro-ph;0009125	photon consumption in minihalos during cosmological reionization	at the earliest epochs of structure formation in cold dark matter (cdm)cosmologies, the smallest nonlinear objects are the numerous small halos thatcondense with virial temperatures below 10,000 k. such ``minihalos'' are notyet resolved in large-scale three-dimensional cosmological simulations. here weemploy a semi-analytic method, combined with three-dimensional simulations ofindividual minihalos, to examine their importance during cosmologicalreionization. we show that, depending on when reionization takes place, theypotentially play an important role as sinks of ionizing radiation. ifreionization occurs at sufficiently high redshifts (z_r &gt; 20), theintergalactic medium is heated to 10,000 k and most minihalos never form. onthe other hand, if z_r &lt; 20, a significant fraction (&gt;10 percent) of allbaryons have already collapsed into minihalos, and are subsequently removedfrom the halos by photoevaporation as the ionizing background flux builds up.we show that this process can require a significant budget of ionizing photons;exceeding the production by a straightforward extrapolation back in time ofknown quasar and galaxy populations by a factor of up to 10 and 3,respectively.

astro-ph;0111046	on the "initial" angular momentum of galaxies	spherical density profiles and specific angular momentum profiles of darkmatter halos found in cosmological n-body simulations have been measuredextensively. the distribution of the total angular momentum of dark matterhalos is also used routinely in semi-analytic modeling of the formation of diskgalaxies. however, it is unclear whether the initial (i.e. at the time the halois assembled) angular momentum distributions of baryons is related to the darkmatter at all. theoretical models for ellipticities in weak lensing studiesoften rely on an assumed correlation of the angular momentum vectors of darkmatter and gas in galaxies. both of these assumptions are shown to be inreasonable agreement with high resolution cosmological smoothed particlehydrodynamical simulations that follow the dark matter as long as onlyadiabatic gas physics are included. however, we argue that in more realisticmodels of galaxy formation one expects pressure forces to play a significantrole at turn--around. consequently the torquing force on dm and baryons will beuncorrelated and their respective angular momenta are not expected to align. ansph simulation with ad-hoc feedback is presented that illustrates theseeffects. massive low redshift elliptical galaxies may be a notable exceptionwhere "light may trace mass".

astro-ph;0112088	the formation of the first star in the universe	we describe results from a fully self-consistent three dimensionalhydrodynamical simulation of the formation of one of the first stars in theuniverse. dark matter dominated pre-galactic objects form because ofgravitational instability from small initidal density perturbations. as theyassemble via hierarchical merging, primordial gas cools through ro-vibrationallines of hydrogen molecules and sinks to the center of the dark matterpotential well. the high redshift analog of a molecular cloud is formed. whenthe dense, central parts of the cold gas cloud become self-gravitating, a densecore of approximately 100 solar mass undergoes rapid contraction. at densitiesn&gt;10^9 cm^-3 a one solar mass proto-stellar core becomes fully molecular due tothree-body h_2 formation. contrary to analytical expectations this process doesnot lead to renewed fragmentation and only one star is formed. the calculationis stopped when optical depth effects become important, leaving the final massof the fully formed star somewhat uncertain. at this stage the protostar isacreting material very rapidly (~0.01 solar masses per year). radiativefeedback from the star will not only halt its growth but also inhibit theformation of other stars in the same pre-galactic object (at least until thefirst star ends its life, presumably as a supernova). we conclude that at mostone massive (m &gt;&gt; 1 solar mass) metal free star forms per pre-galactic halo,consistent with recent abundance measurements of metal poor galactic halostars.

astro-ph;0201095	the angular momentum of gas in proto-galaxies i. implications for the  formation of disk galaxies	we use non-radiative n-body/sph simulations of structure formation in a lcdmcosmology to compare the angular momentum distributions of dark matter and gasin a large sample of halos. we show that the two components have identical spinparameter distributions and that their angular momentum distributions withinindividual halos are very similar, all in excellent agreement with standardassumptions. despite these similarities, however, we find that the angularmomentum vectors of the gas and dark matter are poorly aligned, with a medianmisalignment angle of about 30 degrees, which might have important implicationsfor spin correlation statistics used in weak lensing studies. we presentdistributions for the component of the angular momentum that is aligned withthe total angular momentum of each halo, and find that for between 5 and 50percent of the mass this component is negative. this disagrees with the`universal' angular momentum distribution suggested by bullock et al.

astro-ph;0206428	the nature of the ionising background at z=2.5-5	using radiative transfer calculations and cosmological simulations ofstructure formation, we study constraints that can be placed on the nature ofthe cosmic ultraviolet (uv) background in the redshift interval 2.5&lt; z &lt;5. ourapproach makes use of observational estimates of the opacities of hydrogen andsingly ionised helium in the intergalactic medium during this epoch. inparticular, we model the reionisation of he ii by sources of hard ultravioletradiation, i.e. quasars, and infer values for our parameterisation of thispopulation from observational estimates of the opacity of the he ii lyman-alphaforest. next, we estimate the photoionisation rate of h i from these sourcesand find that their contribution to the ionising background is insufficient toaccount for the measured opacity of the h i lyman-alpha forest at a redshift z3. this motivates us to include a soft, stellar component to the ionisingbackground to boost the hydrogen photoionisation rate, but which has anegligible impact on the he ii opacity. in order to simultaneously matchobservational estimates of the h i and he ii opacities, we find that galaxiesand quasars must contribute about equally to the ionising background in h i atz~ 3.

astro-ph;0308117	the angular momentum of gas in proto-galaxies: ii -- the impact of  preheating	we examine the effect of preheating of the intergalactic medium on galaxyformation using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. by performingsimulations both with and without a simple model for preheating, we analyse andcompare the angular momentum distributions of the dark matter and the baryons.preheating unbinds baryons from their dark matter haloes, yielding a baryonicmass fraction that declines with decreasing halo mass. in addition, the spinparameter of the gas is reduced with respect to the case without preheating,while the misalignment between the angular momentum directions of the gas anddark matter increases strongly. the angular momentum distributions ofindividual haloes reveal that preheating decreases (increases) the massfraction with low (negative) specific angular momentum. we discuss theimplications of these findings for the formation of disk galaxies in apreheated intergalactic medium, and compare our results to the predictions ofmaller &amp; dekel (2002), who propose an alternative interpretation for the originof the angular momentum of (proto)-galaxies.

astro-ph;0311355	fragmentation and the formation of primordial protostars: the possible  role of collision induced emission	the mechanisms which could lead to chemo-thermal instabilities andfragmentation during the formation of primordial protostars are investigatedanalytically. we introduce approximations for h2 cooling rates bridging theoptically thin and thick regimes. these allow us to discuss instabilities up todensities when protostars become optically thick to continuum radiation(n~10^16 cm^-3). during the collapse, instability arises at two differentstages: at low density (n~10^8-10^11 cm^-3), it is due to fast 3-body reactionsconverting h into h2; at high density (n&gt;10^13 cm^-3), it is due to collisionalinduced emission (cie). in agreement with the 3d simulations, we find that theinstability at low densities cannot lead to fragmentation, because fluctuationsdo not survive turbulent mixing, and because their growth is slow. thesituation at high density is similar. the cie-induced instability is as weak asthe low density one, with similar ratios of growth and dynamical time scales.fluctuation growth time is longer than free fall time, and fragmentation seemsunlikely. one then expects the first stars to be massive, not to form binariesnor harbour planets. nevertheless, full 3d simulations are required. they couldbecome possible using simplified estimates of radiative transfer effects, whichwe show to work very well in the 1d case. this indicates that the effects ofradiative transfer during the initial stages of formation of primordialprotostars can be treated as local corrections to cooling.

astro-ph;0503330	forming a primordial star in a relic hii region	there has been considerable theoretical debate over whether photoionizationand supernova feedback from the first population iii stars facilitate orsuppress the formation of the next generation of stars. we present results froman eulerian adaptive mesh refinement simulation demonstrating the formation ofa primordial star within a region ionized by an earlier nearby star. despitethe higher temperatures of the ionized gas and its flow out of the dark matterpotential wells, this second star formed within 23 million years of itsneighbor's death. the enhanced electron fraction within the hii regioncatalyzes rapid molecular hydrogen formation that leads to faster cooling inthe subsequent star forming halos than in the first halos. this "secondgeneration" primordial protostar has a much lower accretion rate because,unlike the first protostar, it forms in a rotationally supported disk ofapprox. 10-100 solar masses. this is primarily due to the much higher angularmomentum of the halo in which the second star forms. in contrast to previouslypublished scenarios, such configurations may allow binaries or multiple systemsof lower mass stars to form. these first high resolution calculations offerinsight into the impact of feedback upon subsequent populations of stars andclearly demonstrate how primordial chemistry promotes the formation ofsubsequent generations of stars even in the presence of the entropy injected bythe first stars into the igm.

astro-ph;0511365	an excursion set model of the cosmic web: the abundance of sheets,  filaments and halos	we discuss an analytic approach for modeling structure formation in sheets,filaments and knots. this is accomplished by combining models of triaxialcollapse with the excursion set approach: sheets are defined as objects whichhave collapsed along only one axis, filaments have collapsed along two axes,and halos are objects in which triaxial collapse is complete. in the simplestversion of this approach, which we develop here, large scale structure shows aclear hierarchy of morphologies: the mass in large-scale sheets is partitionedup among lower mass filaments, which themselves are made-up of still lower masshalos. our approach provides analytic estimates of the mass fraction in sheets,filaments and halos, and its evolution, for any background cosmological modeland any initial fluctuation spectrum. in the currently popular $\lambda$cdmmodel, our analysis suggests that more than 99% of the cosmic mass is insheets, and 72% in filaments, with mass larger than $10^{10} m_{\odot}$ at thepresent time. for halos, this number is only 46%. our approach also providesanalytic estimates of how halo abundances at any given time correlate with themorphology of the surrounding large-scale structure, and how halo evolutioncorrelates with the morphology of large scale structure.

astro-ph;9712119	a minihalo model for the lyman limit absorption systems at high redshift	we propose that a large fraction of the qso lyman limit absorption systems(lls) observed at high redshift (z &gt; 3) originate from gas trapped in smallobjects, such as minihalos, that form prior to reionization. in the absence ofa strong uv flux, the gas is predominantly neutral and may form clouds with hicolumn density nhi &gt; 10^18 cm^-2. due to their high densities and high hicolumn densities, these clouds are not destroyed by the onset of the uvbackground at a later time. thus, if not disrupted by other processes, such asmergers into larger systems or `blow away' by supernovae, they will producells. we show that the observed number density of lls at high redshifts can wellbe reproduced by the survived `minihalos' in hierarchical clustering modelssuch as the standard cold dark matter model. the number density of lls in sucha population increases with z even beyond the redshifts accessible to currentobservations and dies off quickly at z &lt; 2. this population is distinct fromother populations because the absorbing systems have small velocity widths anda close to primordial chemical composition. the existence of such a populationrequires that the reionization of the universe occurs late, at z &lt; 20.

astro-ph;9810215	the formation and fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds	many questions in physical cosmology regarding the thermal history of theintergalactic medium, chemical enrichment, reionization, etc. are thought to beintimately related to the nature and evolution of pregalactic structure. inparticular the efficiency of primordial star formation and the primordial imfare of special interest. we present results from high resolutionthree-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations that follow the collapseof primordial molecular clouds and their subsequent fragmentation within acosmologically representative volume. comoving scales from 128 kpc down to 0.5pc are followed accurately. dark matter dynamics, hydrodynamics and allrelevant chemical and radiative processes (cooling) are followedself-consistently for a cluster normalized cdm structure formation model.primordial molecular clouds with ~100,000 solar masses are assembled by mergersof multiple objects that have formed hydrogen molecules in the gas phase with afractional abundance of &lt;~ 10^-4. as the subclumps merge cooling decreases thetemperature to ~200 kelvin in multiple "cold pockets" of the merger product.within these cold pockets, quasi-hydrostatically contracting cores with masses\~ 100 m_sun and number densities &gt; 100,000/cm^3 are found. we find that lessthan 1% of the primordial gas in such small scale structures cools andcollapses to sufficiently high densities to be available for primordial starformation. furthermore, our results indicate that the formation of very massiveobjects, massive black holes, fragmentation of a large fraction of baryons intobrown dwars or jupiter size fragments seems, in contrast to various claims inthe literature, very unlikely. the expected escape fraction of uv photons with(h nu) &gt; 11ev is very small.

astro-ph;9901313	absorption line signatures of gas in mini dark matter halos	recent observations and theoretical calculations suggest that some qsoabsorption line systems may be due to gas in small dark matter halos withcircular velocities on the order of 30 km/s. additional observational evidencesuggests that, in general, many absorption line systems may also be multi-phasein nature. thus, computing the absorption lines of mini-halos, in addition toproviding signatures of small halos, is a natural way to explore multi-phasebehavior. the state of gas in mini-halos is strongly affected by the backgrounduv radiation field. to address this issue a code was developed that includesmany of the chemical and radiative processes found in cloudy and alsoincorporates spherically symmetric multi-wavelength radiative transfer of anisotropic field, non-equilibrium chemistry, heating, cooling andself-consistent quasi hydro-static equilibrium gas dynamics. with this codedetailed simulations were conducted of gas in mini-halos using different typesof background spectra. from these simulations the absorption line signatures ofthe gas were computed and compared with a variety of observations: highredshift metal lines, he lines and low redshift metal line systems. based onthese results the mini-halo model absorption line signatures appear to beconsistent with many current observations given a sufficiently soft spectrum.

astro-ph;9903336	the radiative feedback of the first cosmological objects	in hierarchical models of structure formation, an early cosmic uv background(uvb) is produced by the small (t_vir &lt; 10^4 k) halos that collapse beforereionization. the uvb at energies below 13.6ev suppresses the formation ofstars or black holes inside small halos, by photo-dissociating their onlycooling agent, molecular h2. we self-consistently compute the buildup of theearly uvb in press-schechter models, coupled with h2 photo-dissociation both inthe intergalactic medium (igm), and inside virialized halos. we find that theintergalactic h2 has a negligible effect on the uvb, both because its initialoptical depth is small (tau&lt;0.1), and because it is photo-dissociated at anearly stage. if the uv sources in the first collapsed halos are stars, thentheir uv flux suppresses further star-formation inside small halos. thisresults in a pause in the buildup of the uvb, and reionization is delayed untillarger halos (t_vir&gt; 10^4 k) collapse. if the small halos host mini-quasarswith hard spectra extending to approximately 1 kev, then their x-rays balancethe effects of the uvb, the negative feedback does not occur, and reionizationcan be caused by the small halos.

0811.0820	accretion onto the first stellar mass black holes	the first stars in the universe, forming at redshifts z&gt;15 in minihalos withmasses of order 10^6 msun, may leave behind black holes as their remnants.these objects could conceivably serve as "seeds" for much larger black holesobserved at redshifts z~6. we study the growth of the remnant black holesthrough accretion including for the first time the emitted accretion radiationwith adaptive mesh refinement cosmological radiation-hydrodynamicalsimulations. the effects of photo-ionization and heating dramatically affectthe accretion flow from large scales, resulting in negligible mass growth ofthe black hole. we compare cases with the accretion luminosity included andneglected to show that the accretion radiation drastically changes theenvironment within 100 pc of the black hole, where gas temperatures areincreased by an order of magnitude. the gas densities are reduced and furtherstar formation in the same minihalo prevented for the two hundred million yearsof evolution we followed. these calculations show that even without theradiative feedback included most seed black holes do not gain mass asefficiently as has been hoped for in previous theories, implying that blackhole remnants of pop iii stars that formed in minihalos are not likely to bethe origin of miniquasars. most importantly, however, these calculationsdemonstrate that if early stellar mass black holes are indeed accreting closeto the bondi-hoyle rate with ten percent efficiency they have a dramatic localeffect in regulating star formation in the first galaxies.

0706.0754	metal cooling in simulations of cosmic structure formation	the addition of metals to any gas can significantly alter its evolution byincreasing the rate of radiative cooling. in star-forming environments,enhanced cooling can potentially lead to fragmentation and the formation oflow-mass stars, where metal-free gas-clouds have been shown not to fragment.adding metal cooling to numerical simulations has traditionally required achoice between speed and accuracy. we introduce a method that uses thesophisticated chemical network of the photoionization software, cloudy, toinclude radiative cooling from a complete set of metals up to atomic number 30(zn) that can be used with large-scale three-dimensional hydrodynamicsimulations. our method is valid over an extremely large temperature range (10k &lt; t &lt; 10^8 k), up to hydrogen number densities of 10^12 cm^-3. at thisdensity, a sphere of 1 msun has a radius of roughly 40 au. we implement ourmethod in the adaptive mesh refinement (amr) hydrodynamic/n-body code, enzo.using cooling rates generated with this method, we study the physicalconditions that led to the transition from population iii to population ii starformation. while c, o, fe, and si have been previously shown to make thestrongest contribution to the cooling in low-metallicity gas, we find that upto 40% of the metal cooling comes from fine-structure emission by s, when solarabundance patterns are present. at metallicities, z &gt; 10^-4 zsun, regions ofdensity and temperature exist where gas is both thermally unstable and has acooling time less than its dynamical time. we identify these doubly unstableregions as the most inducive to fragmentation. at high redshifts, the cmbinhibits efficient cooling at low temperatures and, thus, reduces the size ofthe doubly unstable regions, making fragmentation more difficult.

0812.3405	connecting reionization to the local universe	we present results of combined n-body and three-dimensional reionizationcalculations to determine the relationship between reionization history andlocal environment in a volume 1 gpc/h across and a resolution of about 1 mpc.we resolve the formation of about 2x10^6 halos of mass greater than ~10^12 msunat z=0, allowing us to determine the relationship between halo mass andreionization epoch for galaxies and clusters. for our fiducial reionizationmodel, in which reionization begins at z~15 and ends by z~6, we find a strongbias for cluster-size halos to be in the regions which reionized first, atredshifts 10&lt;z&lt;15. consequently, material in clusters was reionized withinrelatively small regions, on the order of a few mpc, implying that all clustersin our calculation were reionized by their own progenitors. milky way masshalos were on average reionized later and by larger regions, with adistribution similar to the global one, indicating that low mass halos arerelatively uncorrelated with reionization when only their mass is taken as aprior. on average, we find that most halos with mass less than 10^13 msun werereionized internally, while almost all halos with masses greater than 10^14msun were reionized by their own progenitors. we briefly discuss theimplications of this work in light of the "missing satellites" problem and howthis new approach may be extended further.
