0901.4809	variable partial covering and a relativistic iron line in ngc 1365	we present a complete analysis of the hard x-ray (2-10 kev) properties of theseyfert galaxy ngc 1365, based on a 60 ks xmm-newton observation performed injanuary 2004. the two main results are: 1) we detect an obscuring cloud withn_h~3.5x10^23 cm^(-2) crossing the line of sight in ~25 ks. this implies adimension of the x-ray source not larger than a few 10^13 cm and a distance ofthe obscuring cloud of the order of 10^16 cm. adopting the black hole massm(bh) estimated from the m(bh)-velocity dispersion relation, the source size isd_s&lt;20 r_g and the distance and density of the obscuring clouds arer~3000-10000 r_g and n~10^(10) cm^(-3), i.e. typical values for broad lineregion clouds. 2) an iron emission line with a relativistic profile is detectedwith high statistical significance. a time integrated fit of the line+continuumreflection components suggests a high iron abundance (~3 times solar) and anorigin of these components in the inner part (~10 r_g) of the accretion disk,in agreement with the small source size inferred from the analysis of theabsorption variability.

0902.2398	lsd: lyman-break galaxies stellar populations and dynamics. i: mass,  metallicity and gas at z~3.1	we present the first results of a project, lsd, aimed at obtainingspatially-resolved, near-infrared spectroscopy of a complete sample oflyman-break galaxies at z~3. deep observations with adaptive optics resulted inthe detection of the main optical lines, such as [oii], hbeta and [oiii], whichare used to study sizes, sfrs, morphologies, gas-phase metallicities, gasfractions and effective yields. optical, near-ir and spitzer/irac photometry isused to measure stellar mass. we obtain that morphologies are usually complex,with the presence of several peaks of emissions and companions that are notdetected in broad-band images. typical metallicities are 10-50% solar, with astrong evolution of the mass-metallicity relation from lower redshifts. stellarmasses, gas fraction, and evolutionary stages vary significantly among thegalaxies, with less massive galaxies showing larger fractions of gas. incontrast with observations in the local universe, effective yields decreasewith stellar mass and reach solar values at the low-mass end of the sample.this effect can be reproduced by gas infall with rates of the order of thesfrs. outflows are present but are not needed to explain the mass-metallicityrelation. we conclude that a large fraction of these galaxies are activelycreating stars after major episodes of gas infall or merging.

0907.1236	exploring the active galactic nucleus and starburst content of local  ultraluminous infrared galaxies through 5-8 micron spectroscopy	we present a 5-8 micron analysis of the spitzer-irs spectra of 71ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) with redshift z &lt; 0.15, devoted to thestudy of the role of active galactic nuclei (agn) and starbursts (sb) as thepower source of the extreme infrared emission. around 5 micron an agn is muchbrighter (by a factor 30) than a starburst of equal bolometric luminosity. thisallows us to detect the presence of even faint accretion-driven cores insideulirgs: signatures of agn activity are found in 70 per cent of our sample(50/71 sources). through a simple analytical model we are also able to obtain aquantitative estimate of the agn/sb contribution to the overall energy outputof each source. although the main fraction of ulirg luminosity is confirmed toarise from star formation events, the agn contribution is non-negligible (23per cent) and is shown to increase with luminosity. the existence of a ratherheterogeneous pattern in the composition and geometrical structure of the dustamong ulirgs is newly supported by the comparison between individual absorptionfeatures and continuum extinction.

0909.3267	magic gamma-ray telescope observation of the perseus cluster of  galaxies: implications for cosmic rays, dark matter, and ngc1275	the perseus galaxy cluster was observed by the magic cherenkov telescope fora total effective time of 24.4 hr during 2008 november and december. theresulting upper limits on the gamma-ray emission above 100 gev are in the rangeof 4.6 to 7.5 x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} for spectral indices from -1.5 to -2.5,thereby constraining the emission produced by cosmic rays, dark matterannihilations, and the central radio galaxy ngc1275. results are compatiblewith cosmological cluster simulations for the cosmic-ray-induced gamma-rayemission, constraining the average cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure to &lt;4% forthe cluster core region (&lt;8% for the entire cluster). using simplifiedassumptions adopted in earlier work (a power-law spectrum with an index of-2.1, constant cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure for the peripheral clusterregions while accounting for the adiabatic contraction during the cooling flowformation), we would limit the ratio of cosmic ray-to-thermal energy toe_cr/e_th&lt;3%. the upper limit also translates into a level of gamma-rayemission from possible annihilations of the cluster dark matter (the dominantmass component) that is consistent with boost factors of ~10^4 for thetypically expected dark matter annihilation-induced emission. finally, theupper limits obtained for the gamma-ray emission of the central radio galaxyngc1275 are consistent with the recent detection by the fermi-lat satellite.due to the extremely large doppler factors required for the jet, a one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model is implausible in this case. we reproduce theobserved spectral energy density by using the structured jet (spine-layer)model which has previously been adopted to explain the high-energy emission ofradio galaxies.

0910.4381	correlated x-ray and very high energy emission in the gamma-ray binary  ls i +61 303	the discovery of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emitting x-ray binaries hastriggered an intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration,absorption, and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems, which providevariable conditions along eccentric orbits. despite this, the nature of some ofthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the vhe emission, isunclear. to answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelengthcampaign of the vhe gamma-ray emitting x-ray binary ls i +61 303 including themagic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007september. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and vhe bands, with thepeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linear fit to thesimultaneous x-ray/vhe pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlationcoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs providesr=0.81. since a variable absorption of the vhe emission towards the observer isnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates asimultaneity in the emission processes. assuming that they are dominated by asingle particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the x-ray/vhe fluxratio favors leptonic models. this fact, together with the detected photonindices, suggests that in ls i +61 303 the x-rays are the result of synchrotronradiation of the same electrons that produce vhe emission as a result ofinverse compton scattering of stellar photons.

1001.4947	the local galactic magnetic field in the direction of geminga	the milagro hot spot a, close to the galactic anticenter direction, has beententatively attributed to cosmic rays from a local reservoir (at a distance~100 pc), freely streaming along diverging and smooth magnetic field lines.this is at variance with the geometry of the ~kpc scale galactic magneticfield, which is known to be aligned with the spiral arms. we investigate theinformation available on the geometry of the magnetic field on the scales (~100pc) of relevance here. the magnetic field immediately upstream of theheliosphere has been investigated by previous authors by modeling theinteraction of this field with the solar wind. at larger distances, we use thedispersion measure and the rotation measure of nearby pulsars (especiallytowards the third galactic quadrant). additional information about the localfield towards the north polar spur is taken from previous studies of thediffuse radio emission and the polarization of starlight. the asymmetry of theheliosphere with respect to the incoming interstellar medium implies a magneticfield almost orthogonal to the local spiral arm, in the general direction ofhot spot a, but more to the south. this is in good agreement with the nearbypulsar data on the one side, and the north polar spur data on the other. thelocal magnetic field on scales of ~100 parsecs around the sun seems to beoriented so as to provide a direct connection between the solar system and apossible site of the geminga supernova; the residual angular difference and theshape and orientation of the milagro hot spot can be attributed to the fieldtrailing in the wake of the heliosphere.

1004.1093	search for an extended vhe gamma-ray emission from mrk 421 and mrk 501  with the magic telescope	context: part of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray radiation coming fromextragalactic sources is absorbed through the pair production process on theextragalactic background light photons. extragalactic magnetic fields alter thetrajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic backgroundphotons to gamma-ray energies by inverse compton scattering. these secondaryphotons can form an extended halo around bright vhe sources.  aims: we searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars mrk 421and mrk 501 using the magic telescope data.  methods: if extended emission is present, the angular distribution ofreconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader thanfor a point-like source. in the analysis of a few tens of hours ofobservational data taken from mrk 421 and mrk 501 we used a newly developedmethod that provides better angular resolution. this method is based on theusage of multidimensional decision trees. comparing the measured shapes ofangular distributions with those expected from a point-like source one candetect or constrain possible extended emission around the source. we alsostudied the influence of different types of systematic errors on the shape ofthe distribution of reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions for a pointsource.  results: we present upper limits for an extended emission calculated for bothsources for various source extensions and emission profiles. we discusspossible constraints on the extragalactic magnetic fields strength. we obtainupper limits on the extended emission around the mrk~421 (mrk~501) on the levelof &lt; 5% (&lt; 4%) of the crab nebula flux above the energy threshold of 300 gev.using these results we discuss possible constraints on the extragalacticmagnetic fields strength around a few times $10^{-15}$~g.

1004.3665	magic observation of the grb080430 afterglow	context: gamma-ray bursts are cosmological sources emitting radiation fromthe gamma-rays to the radio band. substantial observational efforts have beendevoted to the study of gamma-ray bursts during the prompt phase, i.e. theinitial burst of high-energy radiation, and during the long-lasting afterglows.in spite of many successes in interpreting these phenomena, there are stillseveral open key questions about the fundamental emission processes, theirenergetics and the environment. aim: independently of specific gamma-ray bursttheoretical recipes, spectra in the gev/tev range are predicted to beremarkably simple, being satisfactorily modeled with power-laws, and thereforeoffer a very valuable tool to probe the extragalactic background lightdistribution. furthermore, the simple detection of a component at very-highenergies, i.e. at $\sim 100$\,gev, would solve the ambiguity about theimportance of various possible emission processes, which provide barelydistinguishable scenarios at lower energies. methods: we used the results ofthe magic telescope observation of the moderate resdhift ($z\sim0.76$)\object{grb\,080430} at energies above about 80\,gev, to evaluate theperspective for late-afterglow observations with ground based gev/tevtelescopes. results: we obtained an upper limit of $f_{\rm 95%\,cl} = 5.5\times 10^{-11}$\,erg\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$ for the very-high energy emission of\object{grb\,080430}, which cannot set further constraints on the theoreticalscenarios proposed for this object also due to the difficulties in modeling thelow-energy afterglow. nonetheless, our observations show that cherenkovtelescopes have already reached the required sensitivity to detect the gev/tevemission of grbs at moderate redshift ($z \lesssim 0.8$), provided theobservations are carried out at early times, close to the onset of theirafterglow phase.

1005.0740	magic constraints on gamma-ray emission from cygnus x-3	cygnus x-3 is a microquasar consisting of an accreting compact objectorbiting around a wolf-rayet star. it has been detected at radio frequenciesand up to high-energy gamma rays (above 100 mev). however, many models alsopredict a very high energy (vhe) emission (above hundreds of gev) when thesource displays relativistic persistent jets or transient ejections. therefore,detecting such emission would improve the understanding of the jet physics. theimaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope magic observed cygnus x-3 for about 70hours between 2006 march and 2009 august in different x-ray/radio spectralstates and also during a period of enhanced gamma-ray emission. magic found noevidence for a vhe signal from the direction of the microquasar. an upper limitto the integral flux for energies higher than 250 gev has been set to 2.2 x10-12 photons cm-2 s-1 (95% confidence level). this is the best limit so far tothe vhe emission from this source. the non-detection of a vhe signal during theperiod of activity in the high-energy band sheds light on the location of thepossible vhe radiation favoring the emission from the innermost region of thejets, where absorption is significant. the current and future generations ofcherenkov telescopes may detect a signal under precise spectral conditions.

1005.3365	"comets" orbiting a black hole	we use a long (300 ksec), continuous suzaku x-ray observation of the activenucleus in ngc1365 to investigate the structure of the circumnuclear blr cloudsthrough their occultation of the x-ray source. the variations of the absorbingcolumn density and of the covering factor indicate that the clouds surroundingthe black hole are far from having a spherical geometry (as sometimes assumed),instead they have a strongly elongated and cometary shape, with a dense head(n=10^11 cm^-3) and an expanding, dissolving tail. we infer that the cometarytails must be longer than a few times 10^13 cm and their opening angle must besmaller than a few degrees. we suggest that the cometary shape may be a commonfeature of blr clouds in general, but which has been difficult to recognizeobservationally so far. the cometary shape may originate from shocks andhydrodynamical instabilities generated by the supersonic motion of the blrclouds into the intracloud medium. as a consequence of the mass loss into theirtail, we infer that the blr clouds probably have a lifetime of only a fewmonths, implying that they must be continuously replenished. we also find alarge, puzzling discrepancy (two orders of magnitude) between the mass of theblr inferred from the properties of the absorbing clouds and the mass of theblr inferred from photoionization models; we discuss the possible solutions tothis discrepancy.

1010.2037	[o iii] equivalent width and orientation effects in quasars	the flux of the [oiii] line is considered to be a good indicator of thebolometric emission of quasars. the observed continuum emission from theaccretion disc should instead be strongly dependent on the inclination angletheta between the disc axis and the line of sight. based on this, theequivalent width (ew) of [oiii] should provide a direct measure of theta. herewe analyze the distribution of ew([oiii]) in a sample of ~6,000 sdss quasars,and find that it can be accurately reproduced assuming a relatively smallintrinsic scatter and a random distribution of inclination angles. this resulthas several implications: 1) it is a direct proof of the disc-like emission ofthe optical continuum of quasars; 2) the value of ew([oiii]) can be used as aproxy of the inclination, to correct the measured continuum emission and thenestimate the bolometric luminosity of quasars; 3) the presence of almostedge-on discs among broad line quasars implies that the accretion disc is notaligned with the circumnuclear absorber, and/or that the covering fraction ofthe latter is rather small. finally, we show that a similar analysis of ewdistributions of broad lines (hbeta, mg ii, c iv) provides no evidence ofinclination effects, suggesting a disc-like geometry of the broad emission lineregion.

1103.0477	searches for dark matter annihilation signatures in the segue 1  satellite galaxy with the magic-i telescope	we report the results of the observation of the nearby satellite galaxy segue1 performed by the magic-i ground-based gamma-ray telescope between november2008 and march 2009 for a total of 43.2 hours. no significant gamma-rayemission was found above the background. differential upper limits on thegamma-ray flux are derived assuming various power-law slopes for the possibleemission spectrum. integral upper limits are also calculated for severalpower-law spectra and for different energy thresholds. the values are of theorder of 10^{-11} ph cm^{-2}$ s^{-1} above 100 gev and 10^{-12} ph cm^{-2}s^{-1} above 200 gev. segue 1 is currently considered one of the mostinteresting targets for indirect dark matter searches. in these terms, theupper limits have been also interpreted in the context of annihilating darkmatter particles. for such purpose, we performed a grid scan over a reasonableportion of the parameter space for the minimal supergravity model and computedthe flux upper limit for each point separately, taking fully into account thepeculiar spectral features of each model. we found that in order to match theexperimental upper limits with the model predictions, a minimum flux boost of10^{3} is required, and that the upper limits are quite dependent on the shapeof the gamma-ray energy spectrum predicted by each specific model. finally wecompared the upper limits with the predictions of some dark matter models ableto explain the pamela rise in the positron ratio, finding that segue 1 data arein tension with the dark matter explanation of the pamela spectrum in the caseof a dark matter candidate annihilating into tau+tau-. a complete exclusionhowever is not possible due to the uncertainties in the segue 1 astrophysicalfactor.

1103.5677	a search for very high energy gamma-ray emission from scorpius x-1 with  the magic telescopes	the acceleration of particles up to gev or higher energies in microquasarshas been the subject of considerable theoretical and observational efforts inthe past few years. sco x-1 is a microquasar from which evidence of highlyenergetic particles in the jet has been found when it is in the so-calledhorizontal branch (hb), a state when the radio and hard x-ray fluxes are higherand a powerful relativistic jet is present. here we present the first very highenergy gamma-ray observations of sco x-1 obtained with the magic telescopes. ananalysis of the whole dataset does not yield a significant signal, with 95% clflux upper limits above 300 gev at the level of 2.4x10^{-12} ph/cm^2/s.simultaneous rxte observations were conducted to search for tev emission duringparticular x-ray states of the source. a selection of the gamma-ray dataobtained during the hb based on the x-ray colors did not yield a signal either,with an upper limit of 3.4x10^{-12} ph/cm^2/s. these upper limits place aconstraint on the maximum tev luminosity to non-thermal x-ray luminosity ofl_{vhe}/l_{ntx}&lt;0.02, that can be related to a maximum tev luminosity to jetpower ratio of l_{vhe}/l_{j}&lt;10^{-3}. our upper limits indicate that theunderlying high-energy emission physics in sco x-1 must be inherently differentfrom that of the hitherto detected gamma-ray binaries.

1105.2318	probing general relativistic effects during agn x-ray eclipses	long x-ray observations of bright active galactic nuclei show that x-rayeclipses, with durations from a few hours to a few days, are rather common.this opens up a new window of opportunity in the search for signatures ofrelativistic effects in agns: an obscuring cloud covers/uncovers differentparts of the accretion disc at different times, allowing a direct check of theexpected pattern of disc emission. in particular, the combination ofgravitational redshift and relativistic doppler boosting should imply strongdifferences between the receding and approaching parts of an inclined thindisc. at present, these effects may be already detectable with a "lucky"xmm-newton or suzaku observation of a complete eclipse by a compton-thick cloud(a rare, but not impossible-to-see event). in the future, higher sensitivityobservatories will be able to perform these tests easily on tens of agns. thiswill provide a powerful and direct way to test extreme gravity, and to probethe structure of agns in the close vicinity of the central black holes.

1106.1589	mrk 421 active state in 2008: the magic view, simultaneous  multi-wavelength observations and ssc model constrained	context: the blazar markarian 421 is one of the brightest tev gamma-raysources of the northern sky. from december 2007 until june 2008 it wasintensively observed in the very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev) band by thesingle-dish major atmospheric gamma-ray imaging cherenkov telescope (magic-i).aims: we aimed to measure the physical parameters of the emitting region of theblazar jet during active states. methods: we performed a dense monitoring ofthe source in vhe with magic-i, and also collected complementary data in softx-rays and optical-uv bands; then, we modeled the spectral energy distributions(sed) derived from simultaneous multi-wavelength data within the synchrotronself--compton (ssc) framework. results: the source showed intense and prolongedgamma-ray activity during the whole period, with integral fluxes (e &gt; 200 gev)seldom below the level of the crab nebula, and up to 3.6 times this value.eight datasets of simultaneous optical-uv (kva, swift/uvot), soft x-ray(swift/xrt) and magic-i vhe data were obtained during different outburstphases. the data constrain the physical parameters of the jet, once thespectral energy distributions obtained are interpreted within the framework ofa single-zone ssc leptonic model. conclusions: the main outcome of the study isthat within the homogeneous model high doppler factors (40 &lt;= delta &lt;= 80) areneeded to reproduce the observed sed; but this model cannot explain theobserved short time-scale variability, while it can be argued thatinhomogeneous models could allow for less extreme doppler factors, more intensemagnetic fields and shorter electron cooling times compatible with hour orsub-hour scale variability.

1111.5544	constraining cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the perseus galaxy  cluster with tev observations by the magic telescopes	galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase ofhierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks thatcontribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (crs). hence,clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act asenergy reservoirs for additional cr sources, such as active galactic nuclei andsupernova-driven galactic winds. to detect the gamma-ray emission from crinteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to dateobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energygamma-rays and observed the perseus cluster with the magic cherenkov telescopesfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. this campaign resulted inthe detection of the central radio galaxy ngc 1275 at energies e &gt; 100 gev witha very steep energy spectrum. here, we restrict our analysis to energies e &gt;630 gev and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. this constrains the averagecr-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and themodel for cr emission. comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictionsfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include crs constrains the maximumcr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible cr transport processes such ascr streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. finally, we derivelower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the perseus radiomini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created inhadronic cr interactions: assuming a spectrum of e^-2.2 around tev energies asimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9microg, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength towardlarger radii.

1201.4074	morphological and spectral properties of the w51 region measured with  the magic telescopes	the w51 complex hosts the supernova remnant w51c which is known to interactwith the molecular clouds in the star forming region w51b. in addition, apossible pulsar wind nebula cxo j192318.5+140305 was found likely associatedwith the supernova remnant. gamma-ray emission from this region was discoveredby fermi/lat (between 0.2 and 50 gev) and h.e.s.s. (&gt;1 tev). the spatialdistribution of the events could not be used to pinpoint the location of theemission among the pulsar wind nebula, the supernova remnant shell and/or themolecular cloud. however, the modeling of the spectral energy distributionpresented by the fermi/lat collaboration suggests a hadronic emissionmechanism. we performed observations of the w51 complex with the magictelescopes for more than 50 hours. the good angular resolution in the medium(few hundred gev) to high (above 1 tev) energies allow us to performmorphological studies. we detect an extended emission of very-high-energy gammarays, with a significance of 11 standard deviations. we extend the spectrumfrom the highest fermi/lat energies to \sim 5 tev and find that it follows asingle power law with an index of 2.58 \pm 0.07stat \pm 0.22syst . the mainpart of the emission coincides with the shocked cloud region, while we find afeature extending towards the pulsar wind nebula. the possible contribution ofthe pulsar wind nebula, assuming a point-like source, shows no dependence onenergy and it is about 20% of the overall emission. the broad band spectralenergy distribution can be explained with a hadronic model that implies protonacceleration above 100 tev. this result, together with the morphology of thesource, tentatively suggests that we observe ongoing acceleration of ions inthe interaction zone between supernova remnant and cloud. these results shedlight on the long-standing problem of the origin of galactic cosmic rays.

1310.8500	contemporaneous observations of the radio galaxy ngc 1275 from radio to  very high energy gamma-rays	the radio galaxy ngc 1275, recently identified as a very high energy (vhe,&gt;100 gev) gamma-ray emitter by magic, is one of the few non-blazar agn detectedin the vhe regime. in order to better understand the origin of the gamma-rayemission and locate it within the galaxy, we studied contemporaneousmulti-frequency observations of ngc 1275 and modeled the overall spectralenergy distribution (sed). we analyzed unpublished magic observations carriedout between oct. 2009 and feb. 2010, and the previously published ones takenbetween aug. 2010 and feb. 2011. we studied the multi-band variability andcorrelations by analyzing data of fermi-lat (0.1-100 gev), as well as chandra(x-ray), kva (optical) and mojave (radio) data taken during the same period.using customized monte carlo simulations corresponding to early magic stereodata, we detect ngc 1275 also in the earlier campaign. the flux level andenergy spectra are similar to the results of the second campaign. the monthlylight curve &gt;100 gev shows a hint of variability at the 3.6 sigma level. in thefermi-lat band, both flux and spectral shape variabilities are reported. theoptical light curve is variable and shows a clear correlation with thegamma-ray flux &gt;100 mev. in radio, 3 compact components are resolved in theinnermost part of the jet. one of them shows a similar trend as the lat and kvalight curves. the 0.1-650 gev spectra measured simultaneously with magic andfermi-lat can be well fitted either by a log-parabola or by a power-law with asub-exponential cutoff for both campaigns. a single-zonesynchrotron-self-compton model, with an electron spectrum following a power-lawwith an exponential cutoff, can explain the broadband sed and the multi-bandbehavior of the source. however, this model suggests an untypical lowbulk-lorentz factor or a velocity alignment closer to the line of sight thanthe pc-scale radio jet.

1311.2833	magic observations and multifrequency properties of the flat spectrum  radio quasar 3c 279 in 2011	we study the multifrequency emission and spectral properties of the quasar 3c279. we observed 3c 279 in very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) gamma rays, withthe magic telescopes during 2011, for the first time in stereoscopic mode. wecombine these measurements with observations at other energy bands: in highenergy (he, e&gt;100mev) gamma rays from fermi-lat, in x-rays from rxte, in theoptical from the kva telescope and in the radio at 43ghz, 37ghz and 15ghz fromthe vlba, mets\"ahovi and ovro radio telescopes and optical polarisationmeasurements from the kva and liverpool telescopes. during the magicobservations (february to april 2011) 3c 279 was in a low state in optical,x-ray and gamma rays. the magic observations did not yield a significantdetection. these upper limits are in agreement with the extrapolation of the hegamma-ray spectrum, corrected for extragalactic background light absorption,from fermi-lat. the second part of the magic observations in 2011 was triggeredby a high activity state in the optical and gamma-ray bands. during the opticaloutburst the optical electric vector position angle rotatated of about 180degrees. there was no simultaneous rotation of the 43ghz radio polarisationangle. no vhe gamma rays were detected by magic, and the derived upper limitssuggest the presence of a spectral break or curvature between the fermi-lat andmagic bands. the combined upper limits are the strongest derived to date forthe source at vhe and below the level of the previously detected flux by afactor 2. radiation models that include synchrotron and inverse comptonemissions match the optical to gamma-ray data, assuming an emission componentinside the broad line region (blr) responsible for the high-energy emission andone outside the blr and the infrared torus causing optical and low-energyemission. we interpreted the optical polarisation with a bent trajectory model.

1311.3637	magic upper limits on the grb 090102 afterglow	indications of a gev component in the emission from grbs are known since theegret observations during the 1990's and they have been confirmed by the dataof the fermi satellite. these results have, however, shown that ourunderstanding of grb physics is still unsatisfactory. the new generation ofcherenkov observatories and in particular the magic telescope, allow for thefirst time the possibility to extend the measurement of grbs from several tensup to hundreds of gev energy range. both leptonic and hadronic processes havebeen suggested to explain the possible gev/tev counterpart of grbs.observations with ground-based telescopes of very high energy photons (e&gt;30gev) from these sources are going to play a key role in discriminating amongthe different proposed emission mechanisms, which are barely distinguishable atlower energies. magic telescope observations of the grb 090102 (z=1.547) fieldand fermi large area telescope (lat) data in the same time interval areanalysed to derive upper limits of the gev/tev emission. we compare theseresults to the expected emissions evaluated for different processes in theframework of a relativistic blast wave model for the afterglow. simultaneousupper limits with fermi and a cherenkov telescope have been derived for thisgrb observation. the results we obtained are compatible with the expectedemission although the difficulties in predicting the he and vhe emission forthe afterglow of this event makes it difficult to draw firmer conclusions.nonetheless, magic sensitivity in the energy range of overlap with space-basedinstruments (above about 40 gev) is about one order of magnitude better withrespect to fermi. this makes evident the constraining power of ground-basedobservations and shows that the magic telescope has reached the requiredperformance to make possible grb multiwavelength studies in the very highenergy range.

1312.1535	optimized dark matter searches in deep observations of segue 1 with  magic	we present the results of stereoscopic observations of the satellite galaxysegue 1 with the magic telescopes, carried out between 2011 and 2013. withalmost 160 hours of good-quality data, this is the deepest observationalcampaign on any dwarf galaxy performed so far in the very high energy range ofthe electromagnetic spectrum. we search this large data sample for signals ofdark matter particles in the mass range between 100 gev and 20 tev. for this weuse the full likelihood analysis method, which provides optimal sensitivity tocharacteristic gamma-ray spectral features, like those expected from darkmatter annihilation or decay. in particular, we focus our search on gamma-raysproduced from different final state standard model particles, annihilation withinternal bremsstrahlung, monochromatic lines and box-shaped signals. ourresults represent the most stringent constraints to the annihilationcross-section or decay lifetime obtained from observations of satellitegalaxies, for masses above few hundred gev. in particular, our strongest limit(95% confidence level) corresponds to a ~500 gev dark matter particleannihilating into tau+tau-, and is of order &lt;sigma v&gt; ~ 1.2x10^{-24} cm^3s^{-1} - a factor ~40 above the &lt;sigma v&gt; thermal value.

0802.2181	the milagro anticenter hot spots: cosmic rays from the geminga supernova  ?	the milagro experiment has announced the discovery of an excess flux of tevcosmic rays from the general direction of the heliotail, also close to thegalactic anticenter. we investigate the hypothesis that the excess cosmic rayswere produced in the sn explosion that gave birth to the geminga pulsar. theassumptions underlying our proposed scenario are that the geminga supernovaoccurred about 3.4 10^5 years ago (as indicated by the spin down timescale),that a burst of cosmic rays was injected with total energy 10^49 erg (i.e.,about 1% of a typical sn output), and that the geminga pulsar was born with apositive radial velocity of 100--200 km s^-1. we find that our hypothesis isconsistent with the available information. in a first variant (likelyoversimplified), the cosmic rays have diffused according to the bohmprescription (i.e., with a diffusion coefficient on the order of c times r_l,with c the speed of light and r_l the larmor radius). an alternative schemeassumes that diffusion only occurred initially, and the final propagation tothe sun was a free streaming in a diverging magnetic field. if the observedcosmic ray excess does indeed arise from the geminga sn explosion, thelong--sought "smoking gun" connecting cosmic rays with supernovae would finallybe at hand. it could be said that, while looking for the "smoking gun", we werehit by the bullets themselves.

1402.0291	search for very-high-energy gamma rays from the z = 0.896 quasar 4c  +55.17 with the magic telescopes	the bright gamma-ray quasar 4c +55.17 is a distant source ($z = 0.896$) witha hard spectrum at gev energies as observed by the large area telescope (lat)on board the {{\it fermi}} satellite. this source is identified as a goodsource candidate for very-high-energy (vhe; $&gt; 30$ gev) gamma rays. in generalvhe gamma rays from distant sources provide an unique opportunity to study theextragalactic background light (ebl) and underlying astrophysics. the fluxintensity of this source in the vhe range is investigated. then, constraints onthe ebl are derived from the attenuation of gamma-ray photons coming from thedistant blazar. we searched for a gamma-ray signal from this object using the35-hour observations taken by the magic telescopes between november 2010 andjanuary 2011. no significant vhe gamma-ray signal was detected. we computed theupper limits of the integrated gamma-ray flux at $95\%$ confidence level of$9.4 \times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and $2.5 \times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above $100$ gev and $200$ gev, respectively. the differential upperlimits in four energy bins in the range from $80$ gev to $500$ gev are alsoderived. the upper limits are consistent with the attenuation predicted bylow-flux ebl models on the assumption of a simple power-law spectrumextrapolated from lat data.

1405.4660	search for x-ray occultations in active galactic nuclei	recent time-resolved spectral studies of a few active galactic nuclei in hardx-rays revealed occultations of the x-ray primary source probably by broad lineregion (blr) clouds. an important open question on the structure of thecircumnuclear medium of agn is whether this phenomenon is common, i.e. whethera significant fraction of the x-ray absorption in agn is due to blr clouds.here we present the first attempt to perform this kind of analysis in ahomogeneous way, on a statistically representative sample of agn, consisting ofthe ~40 brightest sources with long xmm-newton and/or suzaku observations. wedescribe our method, based on a simple analysis of hardness-ratio light curves,and its validation through a complete spectroscopic analysis of a few cases. wefind that x-ray eclipses, most probably due to clouds at the distance of theblr, are common in sources where the expected occultation time is compatiblewith the observation time, while they are not found in sources with longerestimated occultation times. overall, our results show that occultations by blrclouds may be responsible for most of the observed x-ray spectral variabilityat energies higher than 2 kev, on time scales longer than a few ks.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1501.03620	mass without radiation: heavily obscured agn, the x-ray background and  the black hole mass density	a recent revision of black hole scaling relations (kormendy &amp; ho 2013),indicates that the local mass density in black holes should be increased by upto a factor of five with respect to previously determined values. the localblack hole mass density is connected to the mean radiative efficiency ofaccretion through the time integral of the agn volume density and a significantincrease of the local black holes mass density would have interestingconsequences on agn accretion properties and demography. one possibility toexplain a large black hole mass density is that most of the black hole growthis via radiatively inefficient channels such as super eddington accretion,however, given the intrinsic degeneracies in the soltan argument, this solutionis not unique. here we show how it is possible to accommodate a larger fractionof heavily buried, compton thick agn, without violating the limit imposed bythe hard x-ray and mid-infrared backgrounds spectral energy density.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

0806.2410	amaze. i. the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation at z&gt;3	we present initial results of an eso-vlt large programme (amaze) aimed atdetermining the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation at z&gt;3 by means ofdeep near-ir spectroscopy. gas metallicities are measured, for an initialsample of nine star forming galaxies at z~3.5, by means of optical nebularlines redshifted into the near-ir. stellar masses are accurately determined byusing spitzer-irac data, which sample the rest-frame near-ir stellar light inthese distant galaxies. when compared with previous surveys, themass-metallicity relation inferred at z~3.5 shows an evolution much strongerthan observed at lower redshifts. the evolution is prominent even in massivegalaxies, indicating that z~3 is an epoch of major action in terms of starformation and metal enrichment also for massive systems. there are alsoindications that the metallicity evolution of low mass galaxies is strongerrelative to high mass systems, an effect which can be considered the chemicalversion of the galaxy downsizing. the mass-metallicity relation observed atz~3.5 is difficult to reconcile with the predictions of some hierarchicalevolutionary models. such discrepancies suggest that at z&gt;3 galaxies areassembled mostly with relatively un-evolved sub-units, i.e. small galaxies withlow star formation efficiency. the bulk of the star formation and metallicityevolution probably occurs once small galaxies are already assembled into biggersystems.

astro-ph;0006233	sub-mm and x-ray background: two unrelated phenomena?	obscured agns are thought to contribute a large fraction of the hard x-raybackground (2-10 kev), and have also been proposed as the powerhouse of afraction of the scuba sources which make most of the background at 850um, thusproviding a link between the two spectral windows. we have tackled this issueby comparing data at 2-10 kev and at 850um for a sample of 34 sources at fluxes(or limiting fluxes) which resolve most of the background in the two bands. wepresent here new scuba observations, and new correlations between separate datasets retrieved from the literature. similar correlations presented by othersare added for completeness. none of the 11 hard x-ray (2-10 kev) sources has acounterpart at 850um, with the exception of a chandra source in the ssa13field, which is a candidate type 2, heavily absorbed qso at high redshift. theratios f(850um)/f(5kev) (mostly upper limits) of the x-ray sources aresignificantly lower than the value observed for the cosmic background. inparticular, we obtain that 2-10 kev sources brighter than 10^-15 erg s^-1cm^-2, which make at least 75% of the background in this band, contribute forless than 7% to the submillimeter background. out of the 24 scuba sources, 23are undetected by chandra. the ratios f(850um)/f(5kev) (mostly lower limits) ofthese scuba sources indicate that most of them must be powered either bystarburst activity, or by an agn which is obscured by a column nh &gt; 10^25cm^-2, with a reflection efficiency in the hard x rays significantly lower than1% in most cases. however, agns of this type could not contribute significantlyto the 2-10 kev background.

astro-ph;0010009	dust in active nuclei. i. evidence for "anomalous" properties	we present observational evidences that dust in the circumnuclear region ofagns has different properties than in the galactic diffuse interstellar medium.by comparing the reddening of optical and infrared broad lines and the x-rayabsorbing column density we find that the e(b-v)/n_h ratio is nearly alwayslower than galactic by a factor ranging from ~3 up to ~100. other observationalresults indicate that the av/n_h ratio is significantly lower than galactic invarious classes of agns including intermediate type 1.8-1.9 seyferts, hardx-ray selected and radio selected quasars, broad absorption line qsos and grismselected qsos. the lack of prominent absorption features at 9.7um (silicates)and at 2175a (carbon dip) in the spectra of seyfert 2s and of reddened seyfert1s, respectively, add further evidence for dust in the circumnuclear region ofagns being different from galactic.  these observational results indicate that the dust composition in thecircumnuclear region of agns could be dominated by large grains, which make theextinction curve flatter, featureless and are responsible for the reduction ofthe e(b-v)/n_h and av/n_h ratios.  regardless of the physical origin of these phenomena, the reduced dustabsorption with respect to what expected from the gaseous column density shouldwarn about a mismatch between the optical and the x-ray classification of theactive galactic nuclei in terms of their obscuration.

astro-ph;0304529	an xmm-newton hard x-ray survey of ulirgs	xmm-newton observations of 10 ulirgs are reported. the aim is to investigatein hard x-rays a complete ulirg sample selected from the bright iras 60$\mu$mcatalogue. all sources are detected in x-rays, 5 of which for the first time.these observations confirm that ulirgs are intrinsically faint x-rays sources,their observed x-ray luminosities being typically l(2-10 kev)&lt;1e42-43 erg/s,whereas their bolometric luminosities are l&gt;1e45 erg/s. in all sources we findevidence for thermal emission from hot plasma with kt~0.7kev, dominating thex-ray spectra below 1kev, and likely associated with a nuclear or circumnuclearstarburst. this thermal emission appears uncorrelated with the fir luminosity,suggesting that,in addition to the ongoing rate of star formation, otherparameters may also affect it. the soft x-ray emission appears to be extendedon a scale of ~30kpc for mkn231 and iras19254-7245, possible evidence ofgalactic superwinds. in these 2 sources, in iras20551-4250 and iras23128-5919we find evidence for the presence of hidden agns, while a minor agncontribution may be suspected also in iras20100-4156. in particular, we havedetected a strong fe line at 6.4kev in the spectrum of iras19254-7245 and aweaker one in mkn231, suggestive of deeply buried agns. for the other sources,the x-ray luminosities and spectral shapes are consistent with hot thermalplasma and x-ray binary emissions of mainly starburst origin. we find that the2-10kev luminosities in these sources, most likely due to high-mass x-raybinaries, are correlated with l_fir: both luminosities are good indicators ofthe current global sfr in the galaxy. the composite nature of ulirgs is thenconfirmed, with hints for a predominance of the starburst over the agnphenomenon in these objects.

astro-ph;0311619	local supermassive black holes, relics of active galactic nuclei and the  x-ray background	we quantify the importance of mass accretion during agn phases in the growthof supermassive black holes (bh) by comparing the mass function of black holesin the local universe with that expected from agn relics, which are black holesgrown entirely with mass accretion during agn phases. the local bh massfunction (bhmf) is estimated by applying the well-known correlations between bhmass, bulge luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity andvelocity functions. the density of bh's in the local universe is 4.6 (-1.4;+1.9) (h/0.7)^2 10^5 msun mpc^-3. the relic bhmf is derived from the continuityequation with the only assumption that agn activity is due to accretion ontomassive bh's and that merging is not important. we find that the relic bhmf atz=0 is generated mainly at z&lt;3. moreover, the bh growth is anti-hierarchical inthe sense that smaller bh's (mbh&lt; 10^7 msun) grow at lower redshifts (z&lt;1) withrespect to more massive one's (z~1-3). unlike previous work, we find that thebhmf of agn relics is perfectly consistent with the local bhmf indicating thelocal bh's were mainly grown during agn activity. this agreement is obtainedwhile satisfying, at the same time, the constraints imposed from the x-raybackground. the comparison with the local bhmf also suggests that the mergingprocess is not important in shaping the relic bhmf, at least at low redshifts(z&lt;3). our analysis thus suggests the following scenario: local black holesgrew during agn phases in which accreting matter was converted into radiationwith efficiencies epsilon = 0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction lambda =0.1-1.7 of the eddington luminosity. the average total lifetime of these activephases ranges from ~4.5 10^8 yr for mbh&lt; 10^8 msun to ~1.5 10^8 yr for mbh&gt;10^9 msun.

astro-ph;0409542	local supermassive black holes and relics of active galactic nuclei	we summarize a study where we test the hypothesis that local black holes (bh)are relics of agn activity. we compare the mass function of bhs in the localuniverse with that expected from agn relics, which are bhs grown entirely withmass accretion during agn phases. the local bh mass function (bhmf) isestimated by applying the well-known correlations between bh mass, bulgeluminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity and velocityfunctions. the density of bhs in the local universe is 4.6 (-1.4;+1.9) 10^5msun mpc-3. the relic bhmf is derived from the continuity equation with theonly assumption that agn activity is due to accretion onto massive bhs and thatmerging is not important. we find that the relic bhmf at z=0 is generatedmainly at z&lt;3. moreover, the bh growth is anti-hierarchical in the sense thatsmaller bhs (mbh&lt;10^7 msun) grow at lower redshifts (z&lt;1) with respect to moremassive ones (z~1-3). unlike previous work, we find that the bhmf of agn relicsis perfectly consistent with the local bhmf indicating the local bhs weremainly grown during agn activity. this agreement is obtained while satisfying,at the same time, the constraints imposed by the x-ray background. thecomparison with the local bhmf also suggests that the merging process is notimportant in shaping the relic bhmf, at least at low redshifts (z&lt;3). ouranalysis thus suggests the following scenario: local bhs grew during agn phasesin which accreting matter was converted into radiation with efficiencieseff=0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction lambda=0.1-1.7 of the eddingtonluminosity. the average total lifetime of these active phases ranges from ~4.510^8 yr for mbh&lt;10^7 msun to ~1.5 10^8 yr for mbh&gt;10^9 msun.

astro-ph;0510282	unveiling the nature of ultraluminous infrared galaxies with 3-4 micron  spectroscopy	we present the results of l-band spectroscopical observations of local brightulirgs, performed with isaac at the vlt. we discuss the l-band spectralfeatures of seven single sources, and the statistical properties of a completesample of 15 sources obtained combining our observations with other published3-4 micron spectra. our main results are: 1. when a spectral indicatorsuggesting the presence of an agn (low equivalent width of the 3.3 micronemission line, steep lambda-f_lambda spectrum, presence of an absorptionfeature at 3.4 micron) is found, the agn is always confirmed by independentanalysis at other wavelengths. conversely, in all known agns at least one ofthe above indicators is present. 2. two new diagnostic diagrams are proposedcombining the above indicators, in which starbursts and agns are clearly andcompletely separated. 3. the above diagnostic techniques are possible withspectra of relatively low quality, which can be obtained for several tens ofulirgs with currently available telescopes. this makes l-band spectroscopy thecurrent best tool to disentangle agns and starbursts contributions in ulirgs.4. the l-band properties of ulirgs are heterogeneous. however, we show that allthe spectral differences among ulirgs can be reproduced starting from pureintrinsic agn and sb spectra and varying two parameters: the amount of dustextinction of the agn component, and the relative agn/sb contribution to thebolometric luminosity. 5. using the above decomposition model, we show thatagns in ulirgs have a low dust-to-gas ratio and a dust extinction curvedifferent from galactic. 6. the estimate of the contribution of agns in acomplete sample show that agns are hosted by ~2/3 of ulirgs, but theirenergetic contribution is relevant only in ~20% of the sample.

astro-ph;9808168	the disks of galaxies with seyfert and starburst nuclei: ii.  near-infrared structural properties	we have derived the near-infrared structural components of a sample ofseyfert and starburst (sbn) host galaxies by fitting the images of hunt et al.(1997,apjs,108,229) with a new two-dimensional decomposition algorithm. ananalysis of the fitted parameters shows that seyfert 1 and sbn bulges resemblenormal early-type bulges in structure and color, with (j-k)^c_b about 0.1 magredder than disk (j-k)^c_d. seyfert 2 bulges, instead, are bluer than normalwith (j-k)^c_b ~ (j-k)^c_d. seyfert disks (especially type 1), but not those ofsbns, are abnormally bright (in surface brightness), significantly more so thaneven the brightest normal disks. seyfert disks are also compact, but similar tothose in normal early-type spirals. for a given mass, seyferts and especiallysbns are abnormally rich in neutral hydrogen, and there is strong, albeitindirect, evidence for lower mass-to-light (m/l) ratios in seyfert and sbndisks, but for normal m/ls in their bulges. in seyferts and sbns, hi massfractions and m/l ratios are anticorrelated, and we attribute the high gas massfractions and low m/ls in sbns and several seyferts to ongoing star formation.such abundant gas in seyferts would be expected to inhibit bar formation, whichmay explain why active galaxies are not always barred.

astro-ph;9811074	a 3 dimensional diagnostic diagram for seyfert 2s: probing x-ray  absorption and compton thickness	we present and discuss a "3-dimensional" diagnostic diagram for seyfert2galaxies obtained by means of x-ray and [oiii] data on a large sample ofobjects (reported in the appendix). the diagram shows the kalpha iron lineequivalent width as a function of both the column density derived from thephotoelectric cutoff and the 2-10 kev flux normalized to the [oiii] opticalline flux (the latter corrected for extinction and assumed to be a trueindicator of the source intrinsic luminosity). we find that the hard x-rayproperties of type 2 objects depend on a single parameter, the absorbing columndensity along the line of sight,in accordance with the unified model. thediagram can be used to identify compton thick sources and to isolate and studypeculiar objects. from this analysis we have obtained a column densitydistribution of seyfert 2 galaxies which is thought to be a good approximationof the real distribution. a large population of heavily absorbed objects isdiscovered, including many compton thick candidates. our results indicate thatthe mean log nh/cm^(-2)in type 2 seyferts is 23.5 and that as much as 23-30% ofsources have nh &gt; 10^24 cm^(-2).

astro-ph;9904422	beyond the standard model for the cosmic x-ray background	the synthesis model for the cosmic x-ray background (xrb) -based on theintegrated emission of active galactic nuclei (agns)- is complemented with newobservational results. we adopt the most recent estimates of the agn x-rayluminosity function and evolution. we adopt the column density distribution oftype 2 agns observed in the local universe, instead of describing it as a setof free parameters. we maintain the standard assumptions that type 2 agns havethe same luminosity function -apart from a constant factor- and the sameevolution of type 1s, and that the spectral shapes of both types areindependent of redshift. we explore various parametrizations of the data, andin all cases we find that the xrb can be fitted, but the number density ratioof type 2s to type 1s must be higher than the local value, and/or the hardx-ray counts in the 2-10 kev band and the preliminary bepposax counts in the5-10 kev band are underestimated at a level of a few sigma. these resultsconsistently suggest that type 2 agns could undergo a faster evolution thantype 1s, or other sources with hard x-ray spectra might contribute to the xrbat intermediate or high redshifts.
