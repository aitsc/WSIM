0908.1460	fast: a fully asynchronous split time-integrator for self-gravitating  fluid	we describe a new algorithm for the integration of self-gravitating fluidsystems using sph method. we split the hamiltonian of a self-gravitating fluidsystem to the gravitational potential and others (kinetic and internalenergies) and use different time-steps for their integrations. the timeintegration is done in the way similar to that used in the mixed variable ormultiple stepsize symplectic schemes. we performed three test calculations. onewas the spherical collapse and the other was an explosion. we also performed arealistic test, in which the initial model was taken from a simulation ofmerging galaxies. in all test calculations, we found that the number oftime-steps for gravitational interaction were reduced by nearly an order ofmagnitude when we adopted our integration method. in the case of the realistictest, in which the dark matter potential dominates the total system, the totalcalculation time was significantly reduced. simulation results were almost thesame with those of simulations with the ordinary individual time-step method.our new method achieves good performance without sacrificing the accuracy ofthe time integration.

0910.1587	triplets of supermassive black holes: astrophysics, gravitational waves  and detection	supermassive black holes (smbhs) found in the centers of many galaxies havebeen recognized to play a fundamental active role in the cosmological structureformation process. in hierarchical formation scenarios, smbhs are expected toform binaries following the merger of their host galaxies. if these binaries donot coalesce before the merger with a third galaxy, the formation of a blackhole triple system is possible. numerical simulations of the dynamics oftriples within galaxy cores exhibit phases of very high eccentricity (as highas $e \sim 0.99$). during these phases, intense bursts of gravitationalradiation can be emitted at orbital periapsis. this produces a gravitationalwave signal at frequencies substantially higher than the orbital frequency. thelikelihood of detection of these bursts with pulsar timing and the laserinterferometer space antenna ({\it lisa}) is estimated using several populationmodels of smbhs with masses $\gtrsim 10^7 {\rm m_\odot}$. assuming a fractionof binaries $\ge 0.1$ in triple system, we find that few to few dozens of thesebursts will produce residuals $&gt;1$ ns, within the sensitivity range offorthcoming pulsar timing arrays (ptas). however, most of such bursts will bewashed out in the underlying confusion noise produced by all the other'standard' smbh binaries emitting in the same frequency window. a detailed dataanalysis study would be required to assess resolvability of such sources.implementing a basic resolvability criterion, we find that the chance ofcatching a resolvable burst at a one nanosecond precision level is 2-50%,depending on the adopted smbh evolution model. on the other hand, theprobability of detecting bursts produced by massive binaries (masses $\gtrsim10^7\msun$) with {\it lisa} is negligible.

0707.2928	formation of protoplanets from massive planetesimals in binary systems	more than half of stars reside in binary or multiple star systems and manyplanets have been found in binary systems. from theoretical point of view,however, whether or not the planetary formation proceeds in a binary system isa very complex problem, because secular perturbation from the companion starcan easily stir up the eccentricity of the planetesimals and causehigh-velocity, destructive collisions between planetesimals. early stage ofplanetary formation process in binary systems has been studied by restrictedthree-body approach with gas drag and it is commonly accepted that accretion ofplanetesimals can proceed due to orbital phasing by gas drag. however, the gasdrag becomes less effective as the planetesimals become massive. therefore itis still uncertain whether the collision velocity remains small and planetaryaccretion can proceed, once the planetesimals become massive. we performed {\itn}-body simulations of planetary formation in binary systems starting frommassive planetesimals whose size is about 100-500 km. we found that theeccentricity vectors of planetesimals quickly converge to the forcedeccentricity due to the coupling of the perturbation of the companion and themutual interaction of planetesimals if the initial disk model is sufficientlywide in radial distribution. this convergence decreases the collision velocityand as a result accretion can proceed much in the same way as in isolatedsystems. the basic processes of the planetary formation, such as runaway growthand oligarchic growth and final configuration of the protoplanets areessentially the same in binary systems and single star systems, at least in thelate stage where the effect of gas drag is small.

1001.0773	simulating the universe on an intercontinental grid of supercomputers	understanding the universe is hampered by the elusiveness of its most commonconstituent, cold dark matter. almost impossible to observe, dark matter can bestudied effectively by means of simulation and there is probably no otherresearch field where simulation has led to so much progress in the last decade.cosmological n-body simulations are an essential tool for evolving densityperturbations in the nonlinear regime. simulating the formation of large-scalestructures in the universe, however, is still a challenge due to the enormousdynamic range in spatial and temporal coordinates, and due to the enormouscomputer resources required. the dynamic range is generally dealt with by thehybridization of numerical techniques. we deal with the computationalrequirements by connecting two supercomputers via an optical network and makethem operate as a single machine. this is challenging, if only for the factthat the supercomputers of our choice are separated by half the planet, as oneis located in amsterdam and the other is in tokyo. the co-scheduling of the twocomputers and the 'gridification' of the code enables us to achieve a 90%efficiency for this distributed intercontinental supercomputer.

1003.4125	the origin of s-stars and a young stellar disk: distribution of debris  stars of a sinking star cluster	within the distance of 1 pc from the galactic center (gc), more than 100young massive stars have been found. the massive stars at 0.1-1 pc from the gcare located in one or two disks, while those within 0.1 pc from the gc,s-stars, have an isotropic distribution. how these stars are formed is not wellunderstood, especially for s-stars. here we propose that a young star clusterwith an intermediate-mass black hole (imbh) can form both the disks ands-stars. we performed a fully self-consistent $n$-body simulation of a starcluster near the gc. stars escaped from the tidally disrupted star cluster werecarried to the gc due to an 1:1 mean motion resonance with the imbh formed inthe cluster. in the final phase of the evolution, the eccentricity of the imbhbecomes very high. in this phase, stars carried by the 1:1 resonance with theimbh were dropped from the resonance and their orbits are randomized by achaotic kozai mechanism. the mass function of these carried stars is extremelytop-heavy within 10". the surface density distributions of young massive starshas a slope of -1.5 within 10" from the gc. the distribution of stars in themost central region is isotropic. these characteristics agree well with thoseof stars observed within 10" from the gc.

1005.1752	a natural symmetrization for the plummer potential	we propose a symmetrized form of the softened gravitational potential whichis a natural extension of the plummer potential. the gravitational potential atthe position of particle i (x_i,y_i,z_i), induced by particle j at(x_j,y_j,z_j), is given by: phi_ij = -g m_j/|r_ij^2+e_i^2+e_j^2|^1/2, where gis the gravitational constant, m_j is the mass of particle j, r_ij =|(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2+(z_i-z_j)^2|^1/2 and e_i and e_j are the gravitationalsoftening lengths of particles i and j, respectively. this form is formally anextension of the newtonian potential to five dimensions. the derivative of thisequation in the x,y, and z directions correspond to the gravitationalaccelerations in these directions and these are always symmetric between twoparticles.  when one applies this potential to a group of particles with differentsoftening lengths, as is the case with a tree code, an averaged gravitationalsoftening length for the group can be used. we find that the most suitableaveraged softening length for a group of particles is &lt;e_j^2&gt; = sum_j^n m_je_j^2 / m, where m = sum_j^n m_j and n are the mass and number of all particlesin the group, respectively. the leading error related to the softening lengthis o(sum_j r_j d(e_j^2)/r_ij^3), where r_j is the distance between particle jand the center of mass of the group and d(e_j^2) = e_j^2 - &lt;e_j^2&gt;. using thisaveraged gravitational softening length with the tree method, one can use asingle tree to evaluate the gravitational forces for a system of particles witha wide variety of gravitational softening lengths. consequently, this willreduce the calculation cost of the gravitational force for such a system withdifferent softenings without the need for complicated forms of softening. wepresent the result of simple numerical tests. we found that our modification ofthe plummer potential works well.

0708.1987	environmental effect on the subhalo abundance -- a solution to the  missing dwarf problem	recent high-resolution simulations of the formation of dark-matter halos haveshown that the distribution of subhalos is scale-free, in the sense that ifscaled by the velocity dispersion of the parent halo, the velocity distributionfunction of galaxy-sized and cluster-sized halos are identical. forcluster-sized halos, simulation results agreed well with observations.simulations, however, predicted far too many subhalos for galaxy-sized halos.our galaxy has several tens of known dwarf galaxies. on the other hands,simulated dark-matter halos contain thousands of subhalos. we have performedsimulation of a single large volume and measured the abundance of subhalos inall massive halos. we found that the variation of the subhalo abundance is verylarge, and those with largest number of subhalos correspond to simulated halosin previous studies. the subhalo abundance depends strongly on the localdensity of the background. halos in high-density regions contain large numberof subhalos. our galaxy is in the low-density region. for our simulated halosin low-density regions, the number of subhalos is within a factor of three tothat of our galaxy. we argue that the ``missing dwarf problem'' is not a realproblem but caused by the biased selection of the initial conditions inprevious studies, which were not appropriate for field galaxies.

1011.4017	eccentric evolution of smbh binaries	in recent numerical simulations \citep{matsubayashi07,lockmann08}, it hasbeen found that the eccentricity of supermassive black hole(smbh) -intermediate black hole(imbh) binaries grows toward unity through interactionswith stellar background. this increase of eccentricity reduces the mergingtimescale of the binary through the gravitational radiation to the value wellbelow the hubble time. it also gives the theoretical explanation of theexistence of eccentric binary such as that in oj287 \citep{lehto96,valtonen08}. in self-consistent n-body simulations, this increase ofeccentricity is always observed. on the other hand, the result of scatteringexperiment between smbh binaries and field stars \citep{quinlan96} indicated noincrease of eccentricity. this discrepancy leaves the high eccentricity of thesmbh binaries in $n$-body simulations unexplained. here we present astellar-dynamical mechanism that drives the increase of the eccentricity of ansmbh binary with large mass ratio. there are two key processes involved. thefirst one is the kozai mechanism under non-axisymmetric potential, whicheffectively randomizes the angular momenta of surrounding stars. the other isthe selective ejection of stars with prograde orbits. through these twomechanisms, field stars extract the orbital angular momentum of the smbhbinary. our proposed mechanism causes the increase in the eccentricity of mostof smbh binaries, resulting in the rapid merger through gravitational waveradiation. our result has given a definite solution to the "last-parsecproblem".

1102.0833	binary formation in planetesimal disks i. equal mass planetesimals	as to april 2010, 48 tno (trans-neptunian object) binaries have been found.this is about 6% of known tnos. however, in previous theoretical studies ofplanetary formation in the tno region, the effect of binary formation has beenneglected. tno binaries can be formed through a variety of mechanisms, such asthree-body process, dynamical friction on two massive bodies, inelasticcollisions between two bodies etc. most of these mechanisms become moreeffective as the distance from the sun increases. in this paper, we studiedthree-body process using direct n-body simulations. we systematically changedthe distance from the sun, the number density of planetesimals, and the radiusof the planetesimals and studied the effect of the binaries on the collisionrate of planetesimals. in the tno region, binaries are involved in 1/3 - 1/2 ofcollisions, and the collision rate is increased by about a factor of a fewcompared to the theoretical estimate for the direct two-body collisions. thus,it is possible that the binaries formed through three-body processsignificantly enhance the collision rate and reduce the growth time scale. inthe terrestrial planet region, binaries are less important, because the ratiobetween the hill radius and physical size of the planetesimals is relativelysmall. although the time scale of our simulations is short, they clearlydemonstrated that the accretion process in the tno region is quite differentfrom that in the terrestrial planet region. simulations which cover longer timescale are required to obtain more accurate estimate for the accretionenhancement.

1111.3406	origin of multiple nuclei in ultraluminous infrared galaxies	ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) with multiple ($\ge 3$) nuclei arefrequently observed. it has been suggested that these nuclei are produced bymultiple major mergers of galaxies. the expected rate of such mergers is,however, too low to reproduce the observed number of ulirgs with multiplenuclei. we have performed high-resolution simulations of the merging of twogas-rich disk galaxies. we found that extremely massive and compact starclusters form from the strongly disturbed gas disks after the first or secondencounter between the galaxies. the mass of such clusters reaches $\sim 10^8m_{\odot}$, and their half-mass radii are $20-30 \rm{pc}$. since these clustersconsist of young stars, they appear to be several bright cores in the galacticcentral region ($\sim \rm{kpc}$). the peak luminosity of these clusters reaches$\sim 10%$ of the total luminosity of the merging galaxy. these massive andcompact clusters are consistent with the characteristics of the observedmultiple nuclei in ulirgs. multiple mergers are not necessary to explainmultiple nuclei in ulirgs.

1202.4277	a density independent formulation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics	the standard formulation of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) assumesthat the local density distribution is differentiable. this assumption is usedto derive the spatial derivatives of other quantities. however, this assumptionbreaks down at the contact discontinuity. at the contact discontinuity, thedensity of the low-density side is overestimated while that of the high-densityside is underestimated. as a result, the pressure of the low (high) densityside is over (under) estimated. thus, unphysical repulsive force appears at thecontact discontinuity, resulting in the effective surface tension. this tensionsuppresses fluid instabilities. in this paper, we present a new formulation ofsph, which does not require the differentiability of density. instead of themass density, we adopt the internal energy density (pressure), and itsarbitrary function, which are smoothed quantities at the contact discontinuity,as the volume element used for the kernel integration. we call this newformulation density independent sph (disph). it handles the contactdiscontinuity without numerical problems. the results of standard tests such asthe shock tube, kelvin-helmholtz and rayleigh-taylor instabilities, point likeexplosion, and blob tests are all very favorable to disph. we conclude thatdisph solved most of known difficulties of the standard sph, withoutintroducing additional numerical diffusion or breaking the exact force symmetryor energy conservation. our new sph includes the formulation proposed byritchie &amp; thomas (2001) as a special case. our formulation can be extended tohandle a non-ideal gas easily.

1208.4131	few-body modes of binary formation in core collapse	at the moment of deepest core collapse, a star cluster core contains lessthan ten stars. this small number makes the traditional treatment of hardbinary formation, assuming a homogeneous background density, suspect. in aprevious paper, we have found that indeed the conventional wisdom of binaryformation, based on three-body encounters, is incorrect. here we refine thatinsight, by further dissecting the subsequent steps leading to hard binaryformation. for this purpose, we add some analysis tools in order to make thestudy less subjective. we find that the conventional treatment does remainvalid for direct three-body scattering, but fails for resonant three-bodyscattering. especially democratic resonance scattering, which forms animportant part of the analytical theory of three-body binary formation, takestoo much space and time to be approximated as being isolated, in the context ofa cluster core around core collapse. we conclude that, while three-bodyencounters can be analytically approximated as isolated, subsequent strongperturbations typically occur whenever those encounters give rise to democraticresonances. we present analytical estimates postdicting our numerical results.if we only had been a bit more clever, we could have predicted this qualitativebehaviour.

1309.7352	evolution of star clusters in a cosmological tidal field	we present a method to couple n-body star cluster simulations to acosmological tidal field, using the astrophysical multipurpose softwareenvironment. we apply this method to star clusters embedded in the cosmogriddark matter-only lambdacdm simulation. our star clusters are born at z = 10(corresponding to an age of the universe of about 500 myr) by selecting a darkmatter particle and initializing a star cluster with 32,000 stars on itslocation. we then follow the dynamical evolution of the star cluster within thecosmological environment.  we compare the evolution of star clusters in two milky-way size haloes with adifferent accretion history. the mass loss of the star clusters is continuousirrespective of the tidal history of the host halo, but major merger eventstend to increase the rate of mass loss. from the selected two dark matterhaloes, the halo that experienced the larger number of mergers tends to drive asmaller mass loss rate from the embedded star clusters, even though the finalmasses of both haloes are similar. we identify two families of star clusters:native clusters, which become part of the main halo before its final majormerger event, and the immigrant clusters, which are accreted upon or after thisevent; native clusters tend to evaporate more quickly than immigrant clusters.accounting for the evolution of the dark matter halo causes immigrant starclusters to retain more mass than when the z=0 tidal field is taken as a staticpotential. the reason for this is the weaker tidal field experienced byimmigrant star clusters before merging with the larger dark matter halo.

1409.4758	binary formation in planetesimal disks ii. planetesimals with mass  spectrum	many massive objects have been found in the outer region of the solar system.how they were formed and evolved has not been well understood, although therehave been intensive studies on accretion process of terrestrial planets. one ofthe mysteries is the existence of binary planetesimals with near-equal masscomponents and highly eccentric orbits. these binary planetesimals are quitedifferent from the satellites observed in the asteroid belt region. the ratioof the hill radius to the physical radius of the planetesimals is much largerfor the outer region of the disk, compared to the inner region of the disk. thehill radius increases with the semi major axis. therefore, planetesimals in theouter region can form close and eccentric binaries, while those in the innerregion would simply collide. in this paper, we carried out $n$-body simulationsin different regions of the disk and studied if binaries form in the outerregion of the disk. we found that large planetesimals tend to form binaries. asignificant fraction of large planetesimals are components of the binaries.planetesimals that become the components of binaries eventually collide with athird body, through three-body encounters. thus, the existence of binaries canenhance the growth rate of planetesimals in the trans-neptunian object (tno)region.

astro-ph;0005248	star cluster ecology iva: dissection of an open star  cluster---photometry	the evolution of star clusters is studied using n-body simulations in whichthe evolution of single stars and binaries are taken self-consistently intoaccount. initial conditions are chosen to represent relatively young galacticopen clusters, such as the pleiades, praesepe and the hyades. the calculationsinclude a realistic mass function, primordial binaries and the externalpotential of the parent galaxy. our model clusters are generally significantlyflattened in the galactic tidal field, and dissolve before deep core collapseoccurs. the binary fraction decreases initially due to the destruction of softbinaries, but increases later because lower mass single stars escape moreeasily than the more massive binaries. at late times, the cluster core is quiterich in giants and white dwarfs. there is no evidence for preferentialevaporation of old white dwarfs, on the contrary the formed white dwarfs arelikely to remain in the cluster. stars tend to escape from the cluster throughthe first and second lagrange points, in the direction of and away from thegalactic center. mass segregation manifests itself in our models well within aninitial relaxation time. as expected, giants and white dwarfs are much morestrongly affected by mass segregation than main-sequence stars. open clustersare dynamically rather inactive. however, the combined effect of stellar massloss and evaporation of stars from the cluster potential drives its dissolutionon a much shorter timescale than if these effects are neglected. the often-usedargument that a star cluster is barely older than its relaxation time andtherefore cannot be dynamically evolved is clearly in error for the majority ofstar clusters.

astro-ph;0106252	missing link found? --- the ``runaway'' path to supermassive black holes	observations of stellar kinematics, gas dynamics and masers around galacticnuclei have now firmly established that many galaxies host central supermassiveblack holes (smbhs) with masses in the range $10^6 \sim 10^9$m$_{\odot}$.however, how these smbhs formed is not well understood. one reason for thissituation is the lack of observations of intermediate-mass bhs (imbhs), whichcould bridge the gap between stellar-mass bhs and smbhs. recently, this missinglink (i.e., an imbh) has been found in observations made by the asca and thechandra of the central region of the starburst galaxy m82 \citep{mt99, pg99,mt01, ka01}. subsequent observations by subaru have revealed that this imbhapparently coincides with a young compact star cluster. based on thesefindings, we suggest a new formation scenario for smbhs. in this scenario,imbhs first form in young compact star clusters through runaway merging ofmassive stars. while these imbhs are forming, the host star clusters sinktoward the galactic nucleus through dynamical friction, and upon evaporationdeposit their imbhs near the galactic center. the imbhs then form binaries andeventually merge via gravitational radiation, forming an smbh.

astro-ph;0208452	to circularize or not to circularize? -- orbital evolution of satellite  galaxies	we investigated the orbital evolution of satellite galaxies using numericalsimulations. it has been long believed that the orbit suffers circularizationdue to the dynamical friction from the galactic halo during orbital decay. thiscircularization was confirmed by numerous simulations where dynamical frictionis added as external force. however, some of the resent n-body simulationsdemonstrated that circularization is much slower than expected from approximatecalculations. we found that the dominant reason for this discrepancy is theassumption that coulomb logarithm log lambda is constant, which has been usedin practically all recent calculations. since the size of the satellite isrelatively large, accurate determination of the outer cutoff radius is crucialto obtain good estimate for the dynamical friction. an excellent agreementbetween $n$-body simulations and approximate calculations was observed when theouter cutoff radius is taken to be the distance of the satellite to the centerof the galaxy. when satellite is at the perigalacticon, the distance to thecenter is smaller and therefore log lambda becomes smaller. as a result, thedynamical friction becomes less effective.  we apply our result to the large magellanic cloud. we found that the expectedlifetime of the lmc is twice as long as that would be predicted with previouscalculations. previous study predicts that the lmc will merge into the milkyway after 7 g years, while we found that the merging will take place after 14 gyears from now. our result suggests that generally satellites formed around agalaxy have longer lifetime than previous estimates.

astro-ph;0211471	dynamical evolution of star clusters in tidal fields	we report results of a large set of n-body calculations aimed to study theevolution of multi-mass star clusters in external tidal fields. our clustersstart with the same initial mass-functions, but varying particle numbers,orbital types and density profiles. our main focus is to study how the stellarmass-function and other cluster parameters change under the combined influenceof stellar evolution, two-body relaxation and the external tidal field. we findthat the lifetimes of star clusters moving on similar orbits scale as t simt_rh^x, where t_rh is the relaxation time, and the exponent x depends on theinitial concentration of the cluster and is around x approx 0.75. from theresults for the lifetimes, we predict that between 53% to 67% of all galacticglobular clusters will be destroyed within the next hubble time. low-mass starsare preferentially lost and the depletion is strong enough to turn initiallyincreasing mass-functions into mass-functions which decrease towards thelow-mass end. the details of this depletion are insensitive to the startingcondition of the cluster. the preferential depletion of low-mass stars fromstar clusters leads to a decrease of their mass-to-light ratios except for ashort period close to final dissolution. the fraction of compact remnants isincreasing throughout the evolution and they are more strongly concentratedtowards the cluster cores than main-sequence stars. for a sample of galacticglobular clusters with well observed parameters, we find a correlation betweenthe observed slope of the mass-function and the lifetimes predicted by us. itseems possible that galactic globular clusters started with a mass-functionsimilar to what one observes for the average mass-function of the galactic discand bulge.

astro-ph;0307327	evolution of massive black hole binaries	we present the result of large-scale n-body simulations of thestellar-dynamical evolution of a massive black-hole binary at the center of aspherical galaxy. we focus on the dependence of the hardening rate on therelaxation timescale of the parent galaxy. a simple theoretical argumentpredicts that a binary black hole creates the ``loss cone'' around it. once theloss cone is formed, the hardening rate is determined by the rate at whichfield stars diffuse into the loss cone. therefore the hardening timescalebecomes proportional to the relaxation timescale. recent n-body simulations,however, have failed to confirm this theory and various explanations have beenproposed. by performing simulations with sufficiently large n (up to $10^6$)for sufficiently long time, we found that the hardening rate does depend on n.our result is consistent with the simple theoretical prediction that thehardening timescale is proportional to the relaxation timescale. thisdependence implies that most massive black hole binaries are unlikely to mergewithin the hubble time through interaction with field stars and gravitationalwave radiation alone.

astro-ph;0402622	the formation of massive black holes through collision runaway in dense  young star clusters	a luminous x-ray source is associated with a cluster (mgg-11) of young stars\~200pc from the center of the starburst galaxy m82. the properties of thex-ray source are best explained by a black hole with a mass of at least350msun, which is intermediate between stellar-mass and supermassive blackholes. a nearby but somewhat more massive star cluster (mgg-9) shows noevidence of such an intermediate mass black hole, raising the issue of justwhat physical characteristics of the clusters can account for this difference.here we report numerical simulations of the evolution and the motions of starswithin the clusters, where stars are allowed to mergers with each other. wefind that for mgg-11 dynamical friction leads to the massive stars sinkingrapidly to the center of the cluster to participate in a runaway collision,thereby producing a star of 800-3000msun, which ultimately collapses to anblack hole of intermediate mass. no such runaway occurs in the cluster mgg-9because the larger cluster radius leads to a mass-segregation timescale afactor of five longer than for mgg-11.

astro-ph;0406227	massive black holes in star clusters. i. equal-mass clusters	in this paper we report results of collisional n-body simulations of thedynamical evolution of equal-mass star clusters containing a massive centralblack hole. each cluster is composed of between 5,000 to 180,000 stars togetherwith a central black hole which contains between 0.2% to 10% of the totalcluster mass.  we find that for large enough black hole masses, the central density followsa power-law distribution with slope \rho \sim r^{-1.75} inside the radius ofinfluence of the black hole, in agreement with predictions from earlier fokkerplanck and monte carlo models. the tidal disruption rate of stars is within afactor of two of that derived in previous studies. it seems impossible to growan intermediate-mass black hole (imbh) from a m \le 100 msun progenitor in aglobular cluster by the tidal disruption of stars, although m = 10^3 msun imbhscan double their mass within a hubble time in dense globular clusters. the sameis true for the supermassive black hole at the centre of the milky way.  black holes in star clusters will feed mainly on stars tightly bound to themand the re-population of these stars causes the clusters to expand, reversingcore-collapse without the need for dynamically active binaries. closeencounters of stars in the central cusp also lead to an increased mass lossrate in the form of high-velocity stars escaping from the cluster. a companionpaper will extend these results to the multi-mass case.

astro-ph;0408431	formation of omega centauri by tidal stripping of a dwarf galaxy	we have investigated whether or not a tidal stripping scenario can reproducethe observed surface-brightness profile of omega centauri using n-bodysimulations. assuming that the progenitor of omega centauri is a dwarfelliptical galaxy, we model it with a king model with a core radius being thesame as that of omega centauri. a dark matter halo of the dwarf is not takeninto account. we consider two different models of the milky way potential: asingular isothermal sphere and a three-component model. the progenitor dwarf isexpressed as an n-body system, which orbits in the fixed galactic potential.the dwarf lost more than 90 per cent of its mass during the first fewpericenter passages. thereafter, the mass remains practically constant. thefinal surface-density profile is in good agreement with the observational dataon omega centauri, if the pericenter distance of the orbit of the progenitordwarf is around 500 pc. this value is within the error bar of the currentproper motion data on omega centauri and galactic parameters. although oursimulation is limited to a king-like progenitor dwarf without a dark matterhalo, it strongly suggests that the current density profile of omega centauriis nicely reproduced by a tidal stripping scenario, in other words, that omegacentauri can plausibly be identified with a stripped dwarf elliptical.

astro-ph;0410597	which globular clusters contain intermediate-mass black holes?	it has been assumed that intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs) in globularclusters can only reside in the most centrally concentrated clusters, with aso-called `core-collapsed' density profile. while this would be a naturalguess, it is in fact wrong. we have followed the evolution of star clusterscontaining imbhs with masses between 125 \le m_{bh} \le 1000 m_{\odot} throughdetailed n-body simulations, and we find that a cluster with an imbh, inprojection, appears to have a relatively large `core' with surface brightnessonly slightly rising toward the center. this makes it highly unlikely that anyof `core-collapsed' clusters will harbor an imbh. on the contrary, the placesto look for an imbh are those clusters that can be fitted well bymedium-concentration king models.  the velocity dispersion of the visible stars in a globular cluster with animbh is nearly constant well inside the apparent core radius. for a cluster ofmass m_c containing an imbh of mass m_{bh}, the influence of the imbh becomessignificant only at a fraction 2.5 m_{bh}/m_c of the half-mass radius, deepwithin the core, where it will affect only a small number of stars. inconclusion, observational detection of an imbh may be possible, but will bechallenging.

astro-ph;0511397	the ecology of star clusters and intermediate mass black holes in the  galactic bulge	we simulate the inner 100pc of the milky-way galaxy to study the formationand evolution of the population of star clusters and intermediate mass blackholes. for this study we perform extensive direct n-body simulations of thestar clusters which reside in the bulge, and of the inner few tenth of parsecsof the super massive black hole in the galactic center. in our n-bodysimulations the dynamical friction of the star cluster in the tidal field ofthe bulge are taken into account via (semi)analytic soluations. the n-bodycalculations are used to calibrate a (semi)analytic model of the formation andevolution of the bulge. we find that about 10% of the clusters born within100pc of the galactic center undergo core collapse during their inwardmigration and form intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs) via runaway stellarmerging. after the clusters dissolve, these imbhs continue their inward drift,carrying a few of the most massive stars with them. we predict that regionwithin about 10 parsec of the smbh is populated by about 50imbhs of some1000msun. several of these are expected to be accompanied still by some of themost massive stars from the star cluster. we also find that within a fewmilliparsec of the smbh there is a steady population of several imbhs. thispopulation drives the merger rate between imbhs and the smbh at a rate of aboutone per 10myr, sufficient to build the accumulate majority of mass of the smbh.mergers of imbhs with smbhs throughout the universe are detectable by lisa, ata rate of about two per week.

astro-ph;0511651	dynamical friction on satellite galaxies	for a rigid model satellite, chandrasekhar's dynamical friction formuladescribes the orbital evolution quite accurately, when the coulomb logarithm ischosen appropriately. however, it is not known if the orbital evolution of areal satellite with the internal degree of freedom can be described by thedynamical friction formula. we performed n-body simulation of the orbitalevolution of a self-consistent satellite galaxy within a self-consistent parentgalaxy. we found that the orbital decay of the simulated satellite issignificantly faster than the estimate from the dynamical friction formula. themain cause of this discrepancy is that the stars stripped out of the satelliteare still close to the satellite, and increase the drag force on the satellitethrough two mechanisms. one is the direct drag force from particles in thetrailing tidal arm, a non-axisymmetric force that slows the satellite down. theother is the indirect effect that is caused by the particles remaining close tothe satellite after escape. the force from them enhances the wake caused in theparent galaxy by dynamical friction, and this larger wake in turn slows thesatellite down more than expected from the contribution of its bound mass. wefound these two have comparable effects, and the combined effect can be aslarge as 20% of the total drag force on the satellite.

astro-ph;0511782	evolution of galactic nuclei. i. orbital evolution of imbh	resent observations and theoretical interpretations suggest that imbhs(intermediate-mass black hole) are formed in the centers of young and compactstar clusters born close to the center of their parent galaxy. such a starcluster would sink toward the center of the galaxy, and at the same time starsare stripped out of the cluster by the tidal field of the parent galaxy. weinvestigated the orbital evolution of the imbh, after its parent cluster iscompletely disrupted by the tidal field of the parent galaxy, by means oflarge-scale n-body simulations. we constructed a model of the central region ofour galaxy, with an smbh (supermassive black hole) and bahcall-wolf stellarcusp, and placed an imbh in a circular orbit of radius 0.086pc. the imbh sinkstoward the smbh through dynamical friction, but dynamical friction becomesineffective when the imbh reached the radius inside which the initial stellarmass is comparable to the imbh mass. this is because the imbh kicks out thestars. this behavior is essentially the same as the loss-cone depletionobserved in simulations of massive smbh binaries. after the evolution throughdynamical friction stalled, the eccentricity of the orbit of the imbh goes up,resulting in the strong reduction in the merging timescale throughgravitational wave radiation. our result indicates that the imbhs formed closeto the galactic center can merge with the central smbh in short time. thenumber of merging events detectable with decigo is estimated to be around 50per year. event rate for lisa would be similar or less, depending on the growthmode of imbhs.

astro-ph;0703290	evolution of collisionally merged massive stars	we investigate the evolution of collisionally merged stars with mass of ~100msun which might be formed in dense star clusters. we assumed that massivestars with several tens msun collide typically after ~1myr of the formation ofthe cluster and performed hydrodynamical simulations of several collisionevents. our simulations show that after the collisions, merged stars haveextended envelopes and their radii are larger than those in the thermalequilibrium states and that their interiors are he-rich because of the stellarevolution of the progenitor stars. we also found that if the mass-ratio ofmerging stars is far from unity, the interior of the merger product is not wellmixed and the elemental abundance is not homogeneous. we then followed theevolution of these collision products by a one dimensional stellar evolutioncode. after an initial contraction on the kelvin-helmholtz (thermal adjustment)timescale (~1000-10000 yr), the evolution of the merged stars traces that ofsingle homogeneous stars with corresponding masses and abundances, while theinitial contraction phase shows variations which depend on the mass ratio ofthe merged stars. we infer that, once runaway collisions have set in,subsequent collisions of the merged stars take place before mass loss bystellar winds becomes significant. hence, stellar mass loss does not inhibitthe formation of massive stars with mass of ~1000msun.

astro-ph;9906419	progrape-1: a programmable, multi-purpose computer for many-body  simulations	we have developed progrape-1 (programmable grape-1), a programmablemulti-purpose computer for many-body simulations. the main difference betweenprogrape-1 and "traditional" grape systems is that the former uses fpga (fieldprogrammable gate array) chips as the processing elements, while the latterrely on the hardwired pipeline processor specialized to gravitationalinteractions. since the logic implemented in fpga chips can be reconfigured, wecan use progrape-1 to calculate not only gravitational interactions but alsoother forms of interactions such as van der waals force, hydrodynamicalinteractions in sph calculation and so on. progrape-1 comprises two alteraepf10k100 fpga chips, each of which contains nominally 100,000 gates. toevaluate the programmability and performance of progrape-1, we implemented apipeline for gravitational interaction similar to that of grape-3. one pipelinefitted into a single fpga chip, which operated at 16 mhz clock. thus, forgravitational interaction, progrape-1 provided the speed of 0.96gflops-equivalent. progrape will prove to be useful for wide-range ofparticle-based simulations in which the calculation cost of interactions otherthan gravity is high, such as the evaluation of sph interactions.

astro-ph;9909116	grape-5: a special-purpose computer for n-body simulation	we have developed a special-purpose computer for gravitational many-bodysimulations, grape-5. grape-5 is the successor of grape-3. both consist ofeight custom pipeline chips (g5 chip and grape chip). the difference betweengrape-5 and grape-3 are: (1) the g5 chip contains two pipelines operating at 80mhz, while the grape chip had one at 20 mhz. thus, the calculation speed of theg5 chip and that of grape-5 board are 8 times faster than that of grape chipand grape-3 board. (2) the grape-5 board adopted pci bus as the interface tothe host computer instead of vme of grape-3, resulting in the communicationspeed one order of magnitude faster. (3) in addition to the pure 1/r potential,the g5 chip can calculate forces with arbitrary cutoff functions, so that itcan be applied to ewald or p^3m methods. (4) the pairwise force calculated ongrape-5 is about 10 times more accurate than that on grape-3. on one grape-5board, one timestep of 128k-body simulation with direct summation algorithmtakes 14 seconds. with barnes-hut tree algorithm (theta = 0.75), one timestepof 10^6-body simulation can be done in 16 seconds.
