0901.3027	x-ray emission from the m9 dwarf 1rxs j115928.5-524717 - quasi-quiescent  coronal activity at the end of the main sequence	methods: we analyse an xmm-newton observation of 1rxs j115928.5-524717, anultracool dwarf with spectral type m9 and compare its x-ray properties to thoseof other similar very late-type stars. results: we clearly detected 1rxsj115928.5-524717 at soft x-ray energies in all epic detectors. only minorvariability was present during the observation and we attribute the x-rayemission to quasi-quiescent activity. the coronal plasma is described well by atwo-temperature model at solar metallicity with temperatures of 2 mk and 6 mkand an x-ray luminosity of about l_x = 1.0 x 10^26 erg/s in the 0.2-2.0 kevband. the corresponding activity level of log l_x/l_bol = -4.1 points to amoderately active star. altogether, x-ray activity from very low-mass starsshows similar trends to more massive stars, despite their different interiorstructure. 1rxsj115928.5-524717 is, after lhs 2065, the second ultracool m9dwarf that emits x-rays at detectable levels in quasi-quiescence. while faintin absolute numbers,both stars are rather x-ray active, implying the existenceof an efficient dynamo mechanisms that is capable of creating magnetic activityand coronal x-ray emission.

0903.0966	altair - the 'hottest' magnetically active star in x-rays	the a7 star altair is one of the hottest magnetically active stars. itsproximity to the sun allows a detailed investigation of a corona in x-rays fora star with a shallow convection zone. we used a deep xmm-newton observation ofaltair and analyzed x-ray light curves, spectra, and emission lines,investigated the temporal behavior and properties of the x-ray emitting plasmaand studied the global coronal structure. we find that altair's corona with anx-ray luminosity of l_x =1.4 x 10^27 erg/s and a very low activity level of logl_x/l_bol = -7.4, is located predominantly at low latitude regions. the x-rayemission is dominated by cool plasma (1-4 mk) at low density, and elementalabundances exhibit a solar-like fip effect and ne/o ratio. the x-ray brightnessvaries by 30 % over the observation, most likely due to rotational modulationand minor activity; in contrast, no strong flares or significant amounts of hotplasma were detected. the x-ray activity level of altair is apparently close tothe saturation level, which is reduced by roughly four orders of magnitude whencompared to late-type stars. with its fast rotation, altair provides aninefficient, but very stable dynamo that mainly operates in convective layersbelow its 'cooler' surface areas around the equator. this dynamo mechanismresults in magnetic activity and leads to x-ray properties that are overallvery similar to those of the quiescent sun, despite very different underlyingstars.

0706.2879	x-rays from ru lupi - accretion and winds in ctts	using three xmm-newton observations we study the x-ray emission of ru lup, aaccreting and wind-driving ctts. in comparison with other bright ctts we studypossible signatures of accretion and winds in their x-ray emission. results: wefind three levels of activity among the observations of ru lup, clearly ofmagnetic origin due to the corresponding high plasma temperatures. densityanalysis with the ovii triplet indicates high densities in the cool plasma,suggesting accretion shocks to be a significant contributor to the soft x-rayemission. no strong overall metal depletion is observed. excess emission at 6.4kev during the more active phase suggest the presence of iron fluorescence. inaccreting stars we find an excess of cool plasma as evidenced by loweroviii/ovii line ratios compared to main-sequence stars. high density plasmaappears to be only present in low-mass ctts, while accreting stars withintermediate masses (&gt; 2 m_sun) have lower densities. conclusions: in allinvestigated ctts the characteristics of the cooler x-ray emitting plasma areinfluenced by the accretion process. we suspect different accretion rates andamount of funneling, possibly linked to stellar mass and radius, to be mainlyresponsible for the different properties of their cool plasma component. theexceptional strong x-ray absorption in ru lup and other ctts is probablyrelated to accretion flows and an optically transparent wind emanating from thestar or the disk.

0912.4428	multi-band transit observations of the tres-2b exoplanet	we present a new data set of transit observations of the tres-2b exoplanettaken in spring 2009, using the 1.2m oskar-luhning telescope (olt) of hamburgobservatory and the 2.2m telescope at calar alto observatory using busca (bonnuniversity simultaneous camera). both the new olt data, taken with the sameinstrumental setup as our data taken in 2008, as well as the simultaneouslyrecorded multicolor busca data confirm the low inclination values reportedpreviously, and in fact suggest that the tres-2b exoplanet has already passedthe first inclination threshold (i_min,1 = 83.417) and is not eclipsing thefull stellar surface any longer. using the multi-band busca data we demonstratethat the multicolor light curves can be consistently fitted with a given set oflimb darkening coefficients without the need to adjust these coefficients, andfurther, we can demonstrate that wavelength dependent stellar radius changesmust be small as expected from theory. our new observations provide furtherevidence for a change of the orbit inclination of the transiting extrasolarplanet tres-2b reported previously. we examine in detail possible causes forthis inclination change and argue that the observed change should beinterpreted as nodal regression. while the assumption of an oblate host starrequires an unreasonably large second harmonic coefficient, the existence of athird body in the form of an additional planet would provide a very naturalexplanation for the observed secular orbit change. given the lack of clearlyobserved short-term variations of transit timing and our observed secular nodalregression rate, we predict a period between approximately 50 and 100 days fora putative perturbing planet of jovian mass. such an object should bedetectable with present-day radial velocity (rv) techniques.

1005.1885	the absence of sub-minute periodicity in classical t tauri stars	classical t tauri stars (ctts) are young, late-type objects, that stillaccrete matter from a circumstellar disk. analytical treatments and numericalsimulations predict instabilities of the accretion shock on the stellarsurface. we search for variability on timescales below a few minutes in thectts tw hya and aa tau. tw hya was observed with salticam on the southernafrican large telescope (salt) in narrow-band filters around the balmer jump.the observations were performed in slit mode, which provides a time resolutionof about 0.1 s. for aa tau we obtained observations with optima, a singlephoton-counting device with even better time resolution. small-scalevariability typically lasts a few seconds, however, no significant periodicityis detected. we place a 99 % confidence upper limit on the pulsed fraction ofthe lightcurves. the relative amplitude is below 0.001 for tw hya in thefrequency range 0.02-3 hz in the 340 nm filter and 0.1-3 hz in the 380 nmfilter. the corresponding value for aa tau is an amplitude of 0.005 for 0.02-50hz. the relevant timescales indicate that shock instabilites should not be seendirectly in our optical and uv observations, but the predicted oscialltionswould induce observable variations in the reddening. we discuss how themagnetic field could stabilise the accretion shock.

1005.4459	the disk-bearing young star im lup	classical t tauri stars (ctts) differ in their x-ray signatures from olderpre-main sequence stars, e.g. weak-lined tts (wtts). ctts show a soft excessand deviations from the low-density coronal limit in the he-like triplets. wetest whether these features correlate with accretion or the presence of a diskby observing im lup, a disk-bearing object apparently in transition betweenctts and wtts without obvious accretion. we analyse a chandra grating spectrumand additional xmm-newton data of im lup and accompanying optical spectra, someof them taken simultaneously to the x-ray observations. we fit the x-rayemission lines and decompose the ha emission line in different components. inx-rays im lup has a bright and hot active corona, where elements of lowfirst-ionisation potential are depleted. the he-like ne ix triplet is in thelow-density state, but due to the small number of counts a high-densityscenario cannot be excluded on the 90% confidence level. in all x-rayproperties im lup resembles a main-sequence star, but it is also compatiblewith ctts signatures on the 90% confidence level, thus we cannot decide if thesoft excess and deviations from the low-density coronal limit in the he-liketriplets in ctts require accretion or only the presence of a disk. im lup ischromospherically active, which explains most of the emission in ha. despiteits low equivalent width, the complexity of the ha line profile is reminiscentof ctts. we present an estimate for the mass accretion rate of 10e-11 msun/yr.

1105.1663	the x-ray puzzle of the l1551 irs 5 jet	protostars are actively accreting matter and they drive spectacular, dynamicoutflows, which evolve on timescales of years. x-ray emission from these jetshas been detected only in a few cases and little is known about its timeevolution. we present a new chandra observation of l1551 irs 5's jet in thecontext of all available x-ray data of this object. specifically, we perform aspatially resolved spectral analysis of the x-ray emission and find that (a)the total x-ray luminosity is constant over almost one decade, (b) the majorityof the x-rays appear to be always located close to the driving source, (c)there is a clear trend in the photon energy as a function of the distance tothe driving source indicating that the plasma is cooler at larger distances and(d) the x-ray emission is located in a small volume which is unresolvedperpendicular to the jet axis by chandra. a comparison of our x-ray data of thel1551 irs 5 jet both with models as well as x-ray observations of otherprotostellar jets shows that a base/standing shock is a likely and plausibleexplanation for the apparent constancy of the observed x-ray emission. internalshocks are also consistent with the observed morphology if the supply of jetmaterial by the ejection of new blobs is sufficiently constant. we concludethat the study of the x-ray emission of protostellar jet sources allows us todiagnose the innermost regions close to the acceleration region of theoutflows.

1106.0189	a correlation between host star activity and planet mass for close-in  extrasolar planets?	the activity levels of stars are influenced by several stellar properties,such as stellar rotation, spectral type and the presence of stellar companions.in analogy to binaries, planetary companions are also thought to be able tocause higher activity levels in their host stars, although at lower levels.especially in x-rays, such influences are hard to detect because coronae ofcool stars exhibit a considerable amount of intrinsic variability. recently, acorrelation between the mass of close-in exoplanets and their host star's x-rayluminosity has been detected, based on archival x-ray data from the rosatall-sky survey. this finding has been interpreted as evidence for star-planetinteractions. we show in our analysis that this correlation is caused byselection effects due to the flux limit of the x-ray data used and due to theintrinsic planet detectability of the radial velocity method, and thus does nottrace possible planet-induced effects. we also show that the correlation is notpresent in a corresponding complete sample derived from combined xmm-newton androsat data.

1112.2008	estimating transiting exoplanet masses from precise optical photometry	we present a theoretical analysis of the optical light curves (lcs) forshort-period high-mass transiting extrasolar planet systems. our methodconsiders the primary transit, the secondary eclipse, and the overall phaseshape of the lc between the occultations. phase variations arise from (i)reflected and thermally emitted light by the planet, (ii) the ellipsoidal shapeof the star due to the gravitational pull of the planet, and (iii) the dopplershift of the stellar light as the star orbits the center of mass of the system.our full model of the out-of-eclipse variations contains information about theplanetary mass, orbital eccentricity, the orientation of periastron and theplanet's albedo. for a range of hypothetical systems we demonstrate that theellipsoidal variations (ii.) can be large enough to be distinguished from theremaining components and that this effect can be used to constrain the planet'smass. to detect the ellipsoidal variations, the lc requires a minimum precisionof 10-4, which coincides with the precision of the kepler mission. as a test ofour approach, we consider the kepler lc of the transiting object hat-p-7. weare able to estimate the mass of the companion, and confirm its planetarynature solely from the lc data. future space missions, such as plato and thejames webb space telescope with even higher photometric precision, will be ableto reduce the errors in all parameters. detailed modeling of any out-of-eclipsevariations seen in new systems will be a useful diagnostic tool prior to therequisite ground based radial velocity follow-up.

0712.0173	magnetic fields in x-ray emitting a-type stars	a common explanation for the observed x-ray emission of a-type stars is thepresence of a hidden late-type companion. while this hypothesis can be shown tobe correct in some cases, there is also evidence suggesting that low-masscompanions cannot be the proper cause for the observed x-ray activity in allcases. babel &amp; montmerle (1997) presented a theoretical framework to explainthe x-ray emission for magnetic ap/bp stars, focusing on the a0p star iq aur.we test if this theoretical model is capable to explain the observed x-rayemissions. we present observations of 13 a-type stars that have been associatedwith x-ray emission detected by rosat. to determine the mean longitudinalmagnetic field strength we measured the circular polarization in the wings ofthe balmer lines using fors 1. although the emission of those objects withmagnetic fields fits the prediction of the babel &amp; montmerle model, not allx-ray detections are related to the presence of a magnetic field. additionally,the strengths of magnetic fields do not correlate with the x-ray luminosity andthus the magnetically confined wind shock model cannot explain the x-rayemission from all investigated stars.

1307.2846	hst fuv imaging of dg tau: fluorescent molecular hydrogen emission from  the wide angle outflow	one of the best-studied jets from all young stellar objects is the jet of dgtau, which we imaged in the fuv with hst for the first time. these high spatialresolution images were obtained with long-pass filters and allow us toconstruct images tracing mainly molecular hydrogen and c iv emission. we findthat the h2 emission appears as a limb-brightened cone with additional emissionclose to the jet axis. the length of the rims is about 0.3 arcsec or 42 au(proj.) before their brightness strongly drops, and the opening angle is about90 deg. comparing our fuv data with near-ir data we find that the fluorescenth2 emission likely traces the outer, cooler part of the disk wind while anorigin of the h2 emission in the surface layers (atmosphere) of the (flared)disk is unlikely. furthermore, the spatial shape of the h2 emission showslittle variation over six years which suggests that the outer part of the diskwind is rather stable and probably not associated with the formation ofindividual knots. the c iv image shows that the emission is concentratedtowards the jet axis. we find no indications for additional c iv emission atlarger distances, which strengthens the association with the x-ray emissionobserved to originate within the dg tau jet.

1510.03276	how do starspots influence the transit timing variations of exoplanets?  simulations of individual and consecutive transits	transit timing variations (ttvs) of exoplanets are normally interpreted asthe consequence of gravitational interaction with additional bodies in thesystem. however, ttvs can also be caused by deformations of the system transitsby starspots, which might thus pose a serious complication in theirinterpretation. we therefore simulate transit light curves deformed byspot-crossing events for different properties of the stellar surface and theplanet, such as starspot position, limb darkening, planetary period, and impactparameter. mid-transit times determined from these simulations can besignificantly shifted with respect to the input values; these shifts cannot belarger than ~1% of the transit duration and depend most strongly on thelongitudinal position of the spot during the transit and the transit duration.consequently, ttvs with amplitudes larger than the above limit are veryunlikely to be caused by starspots. we also investigate whether ttvs fromsequences of consecutive transits with spot-crossing anomalies can bemisinterpreted as the result of an additional body in the system. we use thegeneralized lomb-scargle periodogram to search for periods in ttvs and concludethat low amplitude ttvs with statistically significant periods around activestars are the most problematic cases. in those cases where the photometricprecision is high enough to inspect the transit shapes for deformations, itshould be possible to identify ttvs caused by starspots, however, especiallyfor cases with low transit signal to noise light curves (tsnr $\lesssim$ 15) itbecomes quite difficult to reliably decide whether these periods come fromstarspots, physical companions in the system or if they are random noiseartifacts.

1511.09341	simulating the escaping atmospheres of hot gas planets in the solar  neighborhood	absorption of high-energy radiation in planetary thermospheres is believed tolead to the formation of planetary winds. the resulting mass-loss rates canaffect the evolution, particularly of small gas planets. we present 1d,spherically symmetric hydrodynamic simulations of the escaping atmospheres of18 hot gas planets in the solar neighborhood. our sample only includes stronglyirradiated planets, whose expanded atmospheres may be detectable via transitspectroscopy. the simulations were performed with the pluto-cloudy interface,which couples a detailed photoionization and plasma simulation code with ageneral mhd code. we study the thermospheric escape and derive improvedestimates for the planetary mass-loss rates. our simulations reproduce thetemperature-pressure profile measured via sodium d absorption in hd 189733 b,but show unexplained differences in the case of hd 209458 b. in contrast togeneral assumptions, we find that the gravitationally more tightly boundthermospheres of massive and compact planets, such as hat-p-2 b arehydrodynamically stable. compact planets dispose of the radiative energy inputthrough hydrogen ly$\alpha$ and free-free emission. radiative cooling is alsoimportant in hd 189733 b, but it decreases toward smaller planets like gj 436b. the simulations show that the strong and cool winds of smaller planetsmainly cause strong ly$\alpha$ absorption but little emission. compact andmassive planets with hot, stable thermospheres cause small absorption signalsbut are strong ly$\alpha$ emitters, possibly detectable with the currentinstrumentation. the absorption and emission signals provide a possibledistinction between these two classes of thermospheres in hot gas planets.according to our results, wasp-80 and gj 3470 are currently the most promisingtargets for observational follow-up aimed at detecting atmospheric ly$\alpha$absorption signals.

1511.09348	energy-limited escape revised	gas planets in close proximity to their host stars experiencephotoevaporative mass loss. the energy-limited escape concept is generally usedto derive estimates for the planetary mass-loss rates. our photoionizationhydrodynamics simulations of the thermospheres of hot gas planets show that theenergy-limited escape concept is valid only for planets with a gravitationalpotential lower than $\log_\mathrm{10}\left( -\phi_{\mathrm{g}}\right) &lt;13.11~$erg$\,$g$^{-1}$ because in these planets the radiative energy input isefficiently used to drive the planetary wind. massive and compact planets with$\log_\mathrm{10}\left( -\phi_{\mathrm{g}}\right) \gtrsim 13.6~$erg$\,$g$^{-1}$exhibit more tightly bound atmospheres in which the complete radiative energyinput is re-emitted through hydrogen ly$\alpha$ and free-free emission. theseplanets therefore host hydrodynamically stable thermospheres. between these twoextremes the strength of the planetary winds rapidly declines as a result of adecreasing heating efficiency. small planets undergo enhanced evaporationbecause they host expanded atmospheres that expose a larger surface to thestellar irradiation. we present scaling laws for the heating efficiency and theexpansion radius that depend on the gravitational potential and irradiationlevel of the planet. the resulting revised energy-limited escape concept can beused to derive estimates for the mass-loss rates of super-earth-sized planetsas well as massive hot jupiters with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres.

0807.2025	multiwavelength observations of a giant flare on cn leonis i. the  chromosphere as seen in the optical spectra	flares on dm stars contain plasmas at very different temperatures and thusaffect a wide wavelength range in the electromagnetic spectrum. while thecoronal properties of flares are studied best in x-rays, the chromosphere ofthe star is observed best in the optical and ultraviolet ranges. therefore,multiwavelength observations are essential to study flare properties throughoutthe atmosphere of a star. we analysed simultaneous observations with uves/vltand xmm-newton of the active m5.5 dwarf cn leo (gl 406) exhibiting a majorflare. the optical data cover the wavelength range from 3000 to 10000 angstrom.  from our optical data, we find an enormous wealth of chromospheric emissionlines occurring throughout the spectrum. we identify a total of 1143 emissionlines, out of which 154 are located in the red arm, increasing the number ofobserved emission lines in this red wavelength range by about a factor of 10.here we present an emission line list and a spectral atlas. we also find lineasymmetries for h i, he i, and ca ii lines. for the last, this is the firstobservation of asymmetries due to a stellar flare. during the flare onset,there is additional flux found in the blue wing, while in the decay phase,additional flux is found in the red wing. we interpret both features as causedby mass motions. in addition to the lines, the flare manifests itself in theenhancement of the continuum throughout the whole spectrum, inverting thenormal slope for the net flare spectrum.

astro-ph;0407231	on the sizes of stellar x-ray coronae	spatial information from stellar x-ray coronae can be inferred by use ofscaling laws from the solar corona. this requires measurement of the physicalparameters temperature and density. we concentrate on the newly availabledensity measurements from line fluxes of x-ray lines measured for a largesample of 64 grating spectra of 42 stellar coronae obtained with chandra andxmm-newton. line counts of strong h-like and he-like ions and fexxi lines weremeasured with the cora line fitting tool by ness and wichmann 2002. densitiesare estimated from he-like f/i flux ratios of ovii and neix representing onlycooler (1-6mk) plasma components. the densities scatter between log n_e =9.5-11 from the ovii triplet and between log n_e = 10.5-12 from the neixtriplet, but we caution that the latter triplet may be biased by contaminationfrom fexix and fexxi lines. we find that low-activity stars tend to showdensities of no more than a few times 10^10cm^-3, whereas no definitive trendis found for the more active stars. investigating the densities of the hotterplasma with various fexxi line ratios, we found no consistent proof for thepresence of very high densities. this result is in line with constant pressurein the emitting active regions. we focus on the commonly used rtv78 scaling lawto derive loop lengths from temperatures and densities assuming loop-likestructures as identical building blocks. we derive emitting volumes from directmeasurements of ion-specific emission measures and densities. available volumesare calculated from the loop-lengths and stellar radii. the ratios of thesevolumes depict volume filling factors, which we find similar up to 0.1 for allstages of activity for ovii and increasing for neix.

astro-ph;0609015	the coronal ne/o abundance of alpha centauri	recent improvements in the modeling of solar convection and line formationled to downward revisions of the solar photospheric abundances of the lighterelements, which in turn led to changes in the radiative opacity of the solarinterior and hence to conflicts with the solar convection zone depth asinferred from helioseismic oscillation frequencies. an increase of the solarne/o abundance to values as observed for nearby stars has been proposed as asolution. because of the absence of strong neon lines in the optical, neonabundances are difficult to measure and the correct solar and stellar ne/oabundances are currently hotly debated. based on x-ray spectra obtained withxmm-newton, we determine a reference value of ne/o for the inactive, solar-likestar alpha cen (primarily alpha cen b, which is the dominant component inx-rays), with three independent, line-based methods, using differentialemission measure reconstruction and an emission measure-independent method. ourresults indicate a value of approx. 0.28 for ne/o in alpha cen, approximatelytwice the value measured for the sun, but still below the average valueobtained for other stars. the low ne/o abundance of the sun is peculiar whencompared to alpha cen and other stars; our results emphasize the necessity toobtain more and accurate ne/o abundance measurements of low activity stars.

astro-ph;0610778	a deep xmm-newton x-ray observation of the chamaeleon i dark cloud	methods. the northern-eastern fringe of the chameleon i dark cloud wasobserved with xmm-newton, revisiting a region observed with rosat 15 years ago.centered on the extended x-ray source chxr49 we are able to resolve it intothree major contributing components and to analyse their spectral properties.furthermore, the deep exposure allows not only the detection of numerous,previously unknown x-ray sources, but also the investigation of variability andthe study of the x-ray properties for the brighter targets in the field. we useepic spectra, to determine x-ray brightness, coronal temperatures and emissionmeasures for these sources, compare the properties of classical and weak-line ttauri stars and make a comparison with results from the rosat observation.  results. x-ray properties of t tauri stars in cha i are presented. thexmm-newton images resolve some previously blended x-ray sources, confirmseveral possible ones and detect many new x-ray targets, resulting in the mostcomprehensive list with 71 x-ray sources in the northern cha i dark cloud. theanalysis of medium resolution spectra shows an overlapping distribution ofspectral properties for classical and weak-line t tauri stars, with the x-raybrighter stars having hotter coronae and a higher l_x/l_bol ratio. x-rayluminosity correlates with bolometric luminosity, whereas the l_x/l_bol ratiois slightly lower for the classical t tauri stars. large flares as well as alow iron and a high neon abundance are found in both types of t tauri stars.abundance pattern, plasma temperatures and emission measure distributionsduring quiescent phases are attributed toa high level of magnetic activity asthe dominant source of their x-ray emission.

astro-ph;0702520	x-ray activity cycles in stellar coronae	we present updated results from the ongoing xmm-newton monitoring program ofmoderately active, solar-like stars to investigate stellar x-ray activitycycles; here we report on the binary systems alpha cen a/b and 61 cyg a/b. for61 cyg a we find a coronal x-ray cycle which clearly reflects the chromosphericactivity cycle and is in phase with a rosat campaign performed in the 1990s. 61cyg a is the first example of a persistent coronal cycle observed on a starother than the sun. the changes of its coronal properties during the cycleresemble the solar behaviour. the coronal activity of 61 cyg b is moreirregular, but also follows the chromospheric activity. long-term variabilityis also present on alpha cen a and b. we find that alpha cen a, a g2 star verysimilar to our sun, fainted in x-rays by at least an order of magnitude duringthe observation program. this behaviour has never been observed before on alphacen a, but is rather similar to the x-ray behaviour of the sun. the x-rayemission of the alpha cen system is dominated in our observations by alpha cenb, which might also have an activity cycle indicated by a significant faintingsince 2005.

astro-ph;9909040	continuous heating of a giant x-ray flare on algol	giant flares can release large amounts of energy within a few days: x-rayemission alone can be up to ten percent of the star's bolometric luminosity.these flares exceed the luminosities of the largest solar flares by many ordersof magnitude, which suggests that the underlying physical mechanisms supplyingthe energy are different from those on the sun. magnetic coupling between thecomponents in a binary system or between a young star and an accretion disk hasbeen proposed as a prerequisite for giant flares. here we report x-rayobservations of a giant flare on algol b, a giant star in an eclipsing binarysystem. we observed a total x-ray eclipse of the flare, which demonstrates thatthe plasma was confined to algol b, and reached a maximum height of 0.6 stellarradii above its surface. the flare occurred around the south pole of algol b,and energy must have been released continously throughout its life. we concludethat a specific extrastellar environment is not required for the presence of aflare, and that the processes at work are therefore similar to those on thesun.

astro-ph;9909041	spectroscopic analysis of a super-hot giant flare observed on algol by  bepposax on 30 august 1997	we present an x-ray observation of the eclipsing binary algol, obtained withthe bepposax observatory. during the observation a huge flare was observed,exceptional both in duration as well as in peak plasma temperature and totalenergy release. the wide spectral response of the different bepposaxinstruments, together with the long decay time scale of the flare, allowed usto perform a detailed time-resolved x-ray spectroscopic analysis of the flare.we derive the physical parameters of the emitting region together with theplasma density applying different methods to the observed flare decay. thex-ray emission from the flare is totally eclipsed during the secondary opticaleclipse, so that the size of the emitting region is strongly constrained (asdescribed in a companion paper) on purely geometrical arguments. the size ofthe flare thus derived is much smaller than the size derived from the analysisof the evolution of the spectral parameters using the quasi-static coolingformalism, showing that the time evolution of the flare is determinedessentially from the temporal profile of the heating, with the intrinsic decayof the flaring loop having little relevance. the very high signal-to-noise ofthe individual spectra strongly constrains some of the derived physicalparameters. in particular, very significant evidence for a three-fold increasein coronal abundance and for a large increase in absorbing column densityduring the initial phases of the flare evolution is present.

0809.4129	discovery of x-ray emission from the eclipsing brown-dwarf binary 2mass  j05352184-0546085	the eclipsing brown-dwarf binary system 2mass j05352184-0546085 is a case suigeneris. for the first time, it allows a detailed analysis of the individualproperties of young brown dwarfs, in particular, masses, and radii, and thetemperature ratio of the system components can be determined accurately. thesystem shows a "temperature reversal" with the more massive component being thecooler one, and both components are found to be active. we analyze x-ray imagesobtained by chandra and xmm-newton containing 2mass j05352184-0546085 in theirrespective field of view. the chandra observatory data show a clear x-raysource at the position of 2mass j05352184-0546085, whereas the xmm-newton datasuffer from contamination from other nearby sources, but are consistent withthe chandra detection. no indications of flaring activity are found in eitherof the observations (together about 70 ks), and we thus attribute the observedflux to quiescent emission. with an x-ray luminosity of 3*10^{28} erg/s we findan l_x/l_{bol}-ratio close to the saturation limit of 10^{-3} and anl_{x}/l_{h\alpha}-ratio consistent with values obtained from low-mass stars.the x-ray detection of 2mass j05352184-0546085 reported here providesadditional support for the interpretation of the temperature reversal in termsof magnetically suppressed convection, and suggests that the activity phenomenaof young brown dwarfs resemble those of their more massive counterparts.

0810.0150	coronal properties of the eq peg binary system	the activity indicators of m dwarfs are distinctly different for early andlate types. the coronae of early m dwarfs display high x-ray luminosities andtemperatures, a pronounced inverse fip effect, and frequent flaring to theextent that no quiescent level can be defined in many cases. for late m dwarfs,fewer but more violent flares have been observed, and the quiescent x-rayluminosity is much lower. to probe the relationship between coronal propertieswith spectral type of active m dwarfs, we analyze the m3.5 and m4.5 componentsof the eq peg binary system in comparison with other active m dwarfs ofspectral types m0.5 to m5.5. we investigate the timing behavior of bothcomponents of the eq peg system, reconstruct their differential emissionmeasure, and investigate the coronal abundance ratios based on emission-measureindependent line ratios from their chandra hetgs spectra. finally we test fordensity variations in different states of activity. the x-ray luminosity of eqpeg a (m3.5) is by a factor of 6-10 brighter than that of eq peg b (m4.5). likemost other active m dwarfs, the eq peg system shows an inverse fip effect. theabundances of both components are consistent within the errors; however, thereseems to be a tendency toward the inverse fip effect being less pronounced inthe less active eq peg b when comparing the quiescent state of the two stars.this trend is supported by our comparison with other m dwarfs. as the x-rayluminosity decreases with later spectral type, so do coronal temperatures andflare rate. the amplitude of the observed abundance anomalies, i.e. the inversefip effect, declines; however, clear deviations from solar abundances remain.

0810.1836	further x-ray detections of herbig stars	the interpretation of x-ray detections from herbig ae/be stars is disputed asit is not clear if these intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars are able todrive a dynamo and ensuing phenomena of magnetic activity. alternative x-rayproduction mechanisms, related to stellar winds, star-disk magnetospheres, orunresolved late-type t tauri star companions have been proposed. in a series ofpapers we have been investigating high-resolution x-ray chandra images ofherbig ae/be and main-sequence b-type stars to test the t tauri hypothesis byspatially resolving known visual companions from the primaries. here we reporton six as yet unpublished chandra exposures from our x-ray survey of herbigstars. the target list comprises six herbig stars with known cool companions,and three further a/b-type stars that are serendipitously in the chandrafield-of-view. in this sample we record a detection rate of 100%, i.e. alla/b-type stars display x-ray emission at levels of log(l_x/l_bol) ~ -5...-7.the analysis of hardness ratios confirms that haebe's have hotter and/or moreabsorbed x-ray emitting plasma than more evolved b-type stars. radiative windsare ruled out as exclusive emission mechanism on basis of the high x-raytemperatures. confirming earlier results, the x-ray properties of herbig ae/bestars are not vastly different from those of their late-type companion stars(if such are known). the diagnostics provided by the presently available dataleave open if the hard x-ray emission of herbig stars is due to young age orindicative of further coronally active low-mass companion stars. in the lattercase, our detection statistics imply a high fraction of higher-order multiplesystems among herbig stars.

0812.0285	jets, accretion, coronae and all that: the enigmatic x-rays from the  herbig star hd 163296	herbig ae/be stars (haebe) are pre-main sequence objects in the mass rangebetween 2 and 8 solar masses. their x-ray properties are uncertain and, as yet,unexplained. we want to elucidate the x-ray generating mechanism in haebes. wepresent a xmm-newton observation of the haebe hd 163296. we analyse the lightcurve, the broad band and the grating spectra, fit emission measures andabundances and apply models for accretion and wind shocks. we find threetemperature components ranging from 0.2 kev to 2.7 kev. the o vii he-liketriplet indicates a x-ray formation region in a low density environment with aweak uv photon field, i. e. above the stellar surface. this makes an origin inan accretion shock unlikely, instead we suggest a shock at the base of the jetfor the soft component and a coronal origin for the hot component. a massoutflow of 10^{-10} solar masses per year is sufficient to power the softx-rays. hd 163296 is thought to be single, so this data represent genuine haebex-ray emission. hd 163296 might be prototypical for its class.
