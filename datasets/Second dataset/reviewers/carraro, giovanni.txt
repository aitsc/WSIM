0905.2791	extragalactic chemical abundances: do hii regions and young stars tell  the same story? the case of the spiral galaxy ngc 300	(abridged) we have obtained new spectrophotometric data for 28 hii regions inthe spiral galaxy ngc 300, a member of the nearby sculptor group. the detectionof auroral lines, including [oiii]4363, [siii]6312 and [nii]5755, has allowedus to measure electron temperatures and direct chemical abundances for thewhole sample. we determine for the first time in this galaxy a radial gas-phaseoxygen abundance gradient based solely on auroral lines, and obtain thefollowing least-square solution: 12+log(o/h)=8.57-0.41 r/r25, where thegalactocentric distance is expressed in terms of the isophotal radius r25. thegradient corresponds to -0.077 dex/kpc, and agrees very well with thegalactocentric trend in metallicity obtained for 29 b and a supergiants in thesame galaxy. the intercept of the regression for the nebular data virtuallycoincides with the intercept obtained from the stellar data. this allows littleroom for depletion of nebular oxygen onto dust grains, although in this kind ofcomparison we are somewhat limited by systematic uncertainties, such as thoserelated to the atomic parameters used to derive the chemical compositions.  we discuss the implications of our result with regard to strong-lineabundance indicators commonly used to estimate the chemical compositions ofstar-forming galaxies, such as r23. by applying a few popular calibrations ofthese indices based on grids of photoionization models on the ngc 300 hiiregion fluxes we find metallicities that are higher by 0.3 dex (a factor oftwo) or more relative to our nebular (te-based) and stellar ones.  we confirm a metallicity dependence of the `softness' parametereta=(o+/o++)/(s+/s++), in the sense that softer stellar continua are found athigh metallicity.

0905.3017	homogeneous photometry and star counts in the field of 9 galactic star  clusters	we present homogeneous $v,i$ ccd photometry of nine stellar fields in the twoinner quadrants of the galactic plane. the lines-of-view to most of thesefields aim in the direction of the very inner galaxy, where the galactic fieldis very dense, and extinction is high and patchy. our nine fields are,according to several catalogs, centred on galactic star clusters, namelytrumpler 13, trumpler 20, lynga 4, hogg 19, lynga 12, trumpler 25, trumpler 26,ruprecht 128, and trumpler 34. apart from their coordinates, and in some casesadditional basic data (mainly from the 2mass archive), their properties arepoorly known. by means of star count techniques and field star decontaminatedcolor-magnitude diagrams, the nature and size of these visual over-densitieshas been established; and, when possible, new cluster fundamental parametershave been derived. to strengthen our findings, we complement our data-set withjhk$_{s}$ photometry from the 2mass archive, that we analyze using a suitablydefined q-parameter. most clusters are projected towards the carina-sagittariumspiral arm. because of that, we detect in the color magnitude diagrams of mostof the other fields several distinctive sequences produced by young populationwithin the arm. all the clusters are of intermediate or old age. the mostinteresting cases detected by our study are, perhaps, that of trumpler 20,which seems to be much older than previously believed, as indicated by itsprominent -and double- red clump; and that of hogg 19, a previously overlookedold open cluster, whose existence in such regions of the milky way is puzzling.

0905.4762	old open clusters in the sagittarius dsph tidal stream -- kith or kin?	a widely supported formation scenario for the galactic disc is that it formedinside-out from material accumulated via accretion events. the sagittariusdwarf spheroidal galaxy (sgr dsph) is the best example of a such accretion, andits ongoing disruption has resulted in that its stars are being deposited inthe milky way halo and outer disc. it is therefore appealing to search forpossible signatures of the sgr dsph contribution to the build-up of thegalactic disc. interestingly, models of the sgr dsph stream indicate clearlythat the trailing tail passes through the outer galactic disc, at the samegalactocentric distance as some anti-centre old open star clusters. weinvestigate in this letter the possibility that the two outermost old openclusters, berkeley~29 and saurer~1, could have formed inside the sgr dsph andthen left behind in the outer galactic disc as a result of tidal interactionwith the milky way. the actual location of these two star clusters, inside thesgr dsph trailing tail, is compatible with this scenario, and their chemicaland kinematical properties, together with our present understanding of theage-metallicity relationship in the sgr dsph, lends further support to thispossible association. hence, we find it likely that the old open star clustersberkeley~29 and saurer~1 have extra-galactic origins.

0908.2866	model-independent diagnostics of highly reddened milky way star  clusters: age calibration	the next generation near- and mid-infrared galactic surveys will yield alarge number of new highly obscured star clusters. detailed characterization ofthese new objects with spectroscopy is time-consuming. diagnostic tools thatwill be able to characterize clusters based only on the available photometrywill be needed to study large samples of the newly found objects. thebrightness difference between the red clump and the main-sequence turn-offpoint have been used as a model-independent age calibrator for clusters withages from a few 10$^8$ to 10$^{10}$ yr in the optical. here we apply for thefirst time the method in the near-infrared. we calibrated this difference in$k$-band, which is likely to be available for obscured clusters, and we applyit to a number of test clusters with photometry comparable to the one that willbe yielded by the current or near-future surveys. the new calibration yieldsreliable ages over the range of ages for which the red clump is present inclusters. the slope of the relation is smoother than that of the corresponding$v$-band relation, reducing the uncertainty in the age determinations withrespect to the optical ones.

0911.3044	the metallicity of the open cluster tombaugh 2	we investigate the nature of the chemical composition of the outer disc opencluster tombaugh 2, that a recent study by frinchaboy et al.

(2008). we find ca and ba to be slightly enhancedwhile ni and sc are solar. the r-process element eu was found to be enhanced,giving an average [eu/ba]=+0.17. the li abundance decreases with teff on theupper giant branch and maintains a low level for red clump stars. the meanmetallicity we derive is in good agreement with that expected from the radialabundance gradient in the disc for a cluster at its galactocentric distance.the surprising result found by frinchaboy et al. (2008), that is the presenceof 2 distinct abundance groups within the cluster, implying either a completelyunique open cluster with an intrinsic metallicity spread, or a very unlikelysuperposition of a cold stellar stream and a very distant open cluster, is notsupported by our new result.

0912.0653	not an open cluster after all: the ngc 6863 asterism in aquila	shortly after birth, open clusters start dissolving; gradually losing starsinto the surrounding star field. the time scale for complete disintegrationdepends both on their initial membership and location within the galaxy. openclusters undergoing the terminal phase of cluster disruption or open clusterremnants (ocrs) are notoriously difficult to identify. from an observationalpoint, a combination of low number statistics and minimal contrast against thegeneral stellar field conspire to turn them into very challenging objects. tomake the situation even worst, random samples of field stars often displayfeatures that may induce to classify them erroneously as extremely evolved openclusters. in this paper, we provide a detailed study of the stellar content andkinematics of ngc 6863, a compact group of a few stars located in aquila anddescribed by the poss as a non existent cluster. nonetheless, this object hasbeen recently classified as ocr. the aim of the present work is to eitherconfirm or disprove its ocr status by a detailed star-by-star analysis. theanalysis is performed using wide-field photometry in the ubvi pass-band, propermotions from the ucac3 catalogue, and high resolution spectroscopy as well asresults from extensive $n$-body calculations. our results show that the fourbrightest stars commonly associated to ngc 6863 form an asterism, a group ofnon-physically associated stars projected together, leading to the conclusionthat ngc 6863 is not a real open cluster.

1006.1277	the edge of the young galactic disc	in this work we report and discuss the detection of two distant diffusestellar groups in the third galactic quadrant. they are composed of youngstars, with spectral types ranging from late o to late b, and lie atgalactocentric distances between 15 and 20 kpc. these groups are located in thearea of two cataloged open clusters (vdb-hagen~04 and ruprecht~30), projectedtowards the vela-puppis constellations, and within the core of the canis majorover-density. their reddening and distance has been estimated analyzing theircolor-color and color-magnitude diagrams, derived from deep $ubv$ photometry.the existence of young star aggregates at such extreme distances from thegalactic center challenges the commonly accepted scenario in which the galacticdisc has a sharp cut-off at about 14 kpc from the galactic center, andindicates that it extends to much greater distances (as also supported byrecent detection of co molecular complexes well beyond this distance). whilethe groups we find in the area of ruprecht~30 are compatible with the orion andnorma-cygnus spiral arms, respectively, the distant group we identify in theregion of vdb-hagen~4 lies in the external regions of the norma-cygnus arm, ata galactocentric distance ($\sim$20 kpc) where no young stars had been detectedso far in the optical.

1205.6293	the central blue straggler population in four outer-halo globular  clusters	using hst/wfpc2 data, we have performed a comparative study of the bluestraggler star (bss) populations in the central regions of the globularclusters am 1, eridanus, palomar 3, and palomar 4. located at distances rgc &gt;50 kpc from the galactic centre, these are (together with palomar 14 and ngc2419) the most distant clusters in the halo. we determine theircolour-magnitude diagrams and centres of gravity. the four clusters turn out tohave similar ages (10.5-11 gyr), significantly smaller than those of theinner-halo globulars, and similar metallicities. by exploiting wide fieldground based data, we build the most extended radial density profiles fromresolved star counts ever published for these systems. these are wellreproduced by isotropic king models of relatively low concentration. bsssappear to be significantly more centrally segregated than red giants in allglobular clusters, in agreement with the estimated core and half-massrelaxation times which are smaller than the cluster ages. assuming that this isa signature of mass segregation, we conclude that am 1 and eridanus areslightly dynamically more evolved than pal 3 and pal 4.

1209.3273	photometric distances to young stars in the inner galactic disk	we present results of the first extensive and deep ccd photometric surveycarried out in the field of the open cluster trumpler 27, an object in theconstellation of sagittarius not far from the galaxy center.  we look for young stars clumps that might plausibly be associated with spiralstructure. wide-field ubvi photometry combined with infrared information allowsus to reconstruct the distribution in reddening and distance of young stars inthe field using the color-color and color-magnitude diagrams.  the analysis of our data, combined too with extensive spectroscopy taken fromliterature shows that the real entity of trumpler 27 as an open cluster is farfrom being firmly stated. in fact, instead of finding a relatively compactgroup of stars confined to a small distance range, we found that starsassociated to trumpler 27 are, indeed, a superposition of early type stars seenalong the line of sight extending over several kiloparsecs beyond even thecenter of the galaxy. we demonstrate that at each distance range it becomespossible to generate a color-magnitude diagram resembling that of an opencluster. this way, our analysis indicates that what was considered an opencluster characterized by a significant age spread is a stellar continuum thatreaches its maximum number of stars at approximately 3.5 kpc from the sun, thedistance of the scutum-crux arm approximately. at the same time, and afteranalyzing the way early type stars distribute with distance, we found some ofthese stellar groups may be linked, within the distance errors, with otherinner spiral arms of our galaxy, including the near 3 kpc arm at approximately5 kpc from the sun. however, very young stars by themselves do not seem totrace strongly the inner spiral arms since they are distributed evenly acrossseveral kiloparsecs toward the center of the galaxy.

0801.1258	constraints to uranus' great collision. iv. the origin of prospero	it is widely accepted that the large obliquity of uranus is the result of agreat tangential collision (gc) with an earth size proto-planet at the end ofthe accretion. we attempt to constraint the gc scenario as the cause of uranus'obliquity as well as on the mechanisms able to give origin to the uranianirregulars. different capture mechanisms for irregulars operate at differentstages on the giant planets formation process. the mechanisms able to capturethe uranian irregulars before and after the gc are analysed. assuming that theywere captured before the gc, we calculate the orbital transfer of the nineirregulars by the impulse imparted by the gc. if their orbital transfer resultsdynamically implausible, they should have originated after the gc. weinvestigate and discuss the dissipative mechanisms able to operate later. inparticular prospero could not exist at the time of the gc. different capturemechanisms for prospero after the gc are investigated. gas drag byuranus'envelope and pull-down capture are not plausible mechanisms. capture ofprospero through a collisionless interaction seems to be difficult. the gcitself provides a mechanism of permanent capture. however, the capture ofprospero by the gc is a low probable event. catastrophic collisions could be apossible mechanism for the birth of prospero and the other irregulars after thegc. orbital and physical clusterings should then be expected. either prosperohad to originate after the gc or the gc did not occur. in the former case, themechanism for the origin of prospero after the gc remains an open question. inthe latter case, another theory to account for uranus' obliquity and theformation of the uranian regular satellites on the equatorial plane of theplanet would be needed.

1311.0760	investigating potential planetary nebula/cluster pairs	fundamental parameters characterizing the end-state of intermediate-massstars may be constrained by discovering planetary nebulae (pne) in openclusters (ocs). cluster membership may be exploited to establish the distance,luminosity, age, and physical size for pne, and the intrinsic luminosity andmass of its central star. four potential pn-oc associations were investigated,to assess the cluster membership for the pne. radial velocities were measuredfrom intermediate-resolution optical spectra, complemented with previousestimates in the literature. when the radial velocity study supported the pn/ocassociation, we analyzed if other parameters (e.g., age, distance, reddening,central star brightness) were consistent with this conclusion. our measurementsimply that the pne vbe3 and hefa1 are not members of the ocs ngc5999 andngc6067, respectively, and likely belong to the background bulge population.conversely, consistent radial velocities indicate that ngc2452/ngc2453 could beassociated, but our results are not conclusive and additional observations arewarranted. finally, we demonstrate that all the available information point tohe2-86 being a young, highly internally obscured pn member of ngc4463. newnear-infrared photometry acquired via the vista variables in the via lactea esopublic survey was used in tandem with existing ubv photometry to measure thedistance, reddening, and age of ngc4463, finding d=1.55+-0.10 kpc,e(b-v)=0.41+-0.02, and tau=65+-10 myr, respectively. the same values should beadopted for the pn if the proposed cluster membership will be confirmed.

1401.1563	chemical abundance analysis of the old, rich open cluster trumpler 20	trumpler 20 is an open cluster located at low galactic longitude, just beyondthe great carina spiral arm, and whose metallicity and fundamental parameterswere very poorly known until now. as it is most likely a rare example of anold, rich open cluster -- possibly a twin of ngc 7789 -- it is useful tocharacterize it. to this end, we determine here the abundance of severalelements and their ratios in a sample of stars in the clump of trumpler 20. theprimary goal is to measure trumpler 20 metallicity, so far very poorlyconstrained, and revise the cluster's fundamental parameters. we presenthigh-resolution spectroscopy of eight clump stars. based on their radialvelocities, we identify six bona fide cluster members, and for five of them(the sixth being a fast rotator) we perform a detailed abundance analysis.  we find that trumpler 20 is slightly more metal-rich than the sun, having[fe/h]=+0.09$\pm$0.10. the abundance ratios of alpha-elements are generallysolar. in line with recent studies of clusters as old as trumpler 20, ba isoverabundant compared to the sun. our analysis of the iron-peak elements (crand ni) does not reveal anything anomalous. based on these results, were-estimate the cluster age to be 1.5$^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ gyr. its distance to thegalactic centre turns out to be 7.3 kpc. with this distance and metallicity,trumpler 20 fits fairly well in the metallicity gradient for the galactic innerdisc. with this new study, the characterization of trumpler~20 is now on muchmore solid ground. further studies should focus on the estimate of the binaryfraction and on its main sequence membership.

(2007) to derive the distance to ngc 3109 using theflux-weighted gravity-luminosity relation (fglr). using primarily fe-groupelements, we find an average metallicity of [z] = -0.67 +/- 0.13, and noevidence of a metallicity gradient in the galaxy. our metallicities are higherthan those found by evans et al. (2007) based on the oxygen abundances ofearly-b supergiants ([z] = -0.93 +/- 0.07), suggesting a low alpha/fe ratio forthe galaxy. we adjust the position of ngc 3109 on the bsg-determined galaxymass-metallicity relation accordingly and compare it to metallicity studies ofhii regions in star-forming galaxies. we derive an fglr distance modulus of25.55 +/- 0.09 (1.27 mpc) that compares well with cepheid and tip of the redgiant branch (trgb) distances. the fglr itself is consistent with those foundin other galaxies, demonstrating the reliability of this method as a measure ofextragalactic distances.

1404.6748	updated properties of the old open cluster melotte 66: searching for  multiple stellar populations	multiple generations of stars are routinely encountered in globular clustersbut no convincing evidence has been found in galactic open clusters to date. inthis paper we use new photometric and spectroscopic data to search for multiplestellar population signatures in the old, massive open cluster, melotte~66. thecluster is known to have a red giant branch wide in color, which could be anindication of metallicity spread. also the main sequence is wider than what isexpected from photometric errors only. this evidence might be associated witheither differential reddening or binaries. both hypothesis have, however, to beevaluated in detail before recurring to the presence of multiple stellarpopulations. new, high-quality, ccd ubvi photometry have been acquired to thisaim with high-resolution spectroscopy of seven clump stars, that arecomplemented with literature data. our photometric study confirms that thewidth of the main sequence close to the turn off point is entirely accountedfor by binary stars and differential reddening, with no need to advocate moresofisticated scenarios, such as metallicity spread or multiple main sequences.by constructing synthetic color-magnitude diagrams, we infer that the binaryfraction has to be as large as 30$%$ and their mass ratio in the range 0.6-1.0.as a by-product of our simulations, we provide new estimates of the clusterfundamental parameters. we measure a reddening e(b-v)=0.15$\pm$0.02, andconfirm the presence of a marginal differential reddening. the distance to thecluster is $4.7^{+0.2}_{-0.1} $kpc and the age is 3.4$\pm$0.3 gyr, which issomewhat younger and better constrained than previous estimates. our detailedabundance analysis reveals that, overall, melotte~66 looks like a typicalobject of the old thin disk population.

1409.0068	the thickening of the thin disk in the third galactic quadrant	in the third galactic quadrant (180 &lt; l &lt; 270) of the milky way, the galacticthin disk exhibits a significant warp ---shown both by gas and young stars---bending down a few kpc below the formal galactic plane (b=0). this warp showsits maximum at 240, in the direction of the canis major constellation. in aseries of papers we have traced the detailed structure of this region usingopen star clusters, putting particular emphasis on the spiral structure of theouter disk. we noticed a conspicuous accumulation of young star clusters within2-3 kpc from the sun and close to b=0, that we interpreted as the continuationof the local (orion) arm towards the outer disk. while most clusters (and youngstars in their background) follow closely the warp of the disk, our decade-oldsurvey of the spiral structure of this region led us to identify threeclusters, haffner~18(1 and 2) and haffner~19, which remain very close to b=0and lie at distances (4.5, 8.0, and 6.4 kpc) where most of the material isalready significantly warped. here we report on a search for clusters thatshare the same properties as haffner~18 and 19, and investigate the possiblereasons for such an unexpected occurrence. we present ubvri photometry of5~young clusters, namely ngc~2345, ngc~2374, trumpler~9, haffner~20, andhaffner~21, which also lie close to the formal galactic plane. with theexception of haffner~20, in the background of these clusters we detected youngstars that appear close to b=0, and are located at distances up to 8 kpc fromthe sun, thus deviating significantly from the warp. these populations define astructure that distributes over almost the entire third galactic quadrant. wediscuss this structure in the context of a possible thin disk flaring, in fullsimilarity with the galactic thick disk.

1511.00835	iau commission 37 "star clusters and associations" legacy report	it is widely accepted that stars do not form in isolation but result from thefragmentation of molecular clouds, which in turn leads to star clusterformation. over time, clusters dissolve or are destroyed by interactions withmolecular clouds or tidal stripping, and their members become part of thegeneral field population. star clusters are thus among the basic buildingblocks of galaxies. in turn, star cluster populations, from young associationsand open clusters to old globulars, are powerful tracers of the formation,assembly, and evolutionary history of their parent galaxies. although theirimportance had been recognised for decades, major progress in this area hasonly become possible in recent years, both for galactic and extragalacticcluster populations. star clusters are the observational foundation for stellarastrophysics and evolution, provide essential tracers of galactic structure,and are unique stellar dynamical environments. star formation, stellarstructure, stellar evolution, and stellar nucleosynthesis continue to benefitand improve tremendously from the study of these systems. additionally,fundamental quantities such as the initial mass function can be successfullyderived from modelling either the h-r diagrams or the integrated velocitystructures of, respectively, resolved and unresolved clusters and clusterpopulations. star cluster studies thus span the fields of galactic andextragalactic astrophysics, while heavily affecting our detailed understandingof the process of star formation in dense environments.this report highlightsscience results of the last decade in the major fields covered by iaucommission 37: star clusters and associations.

astro-ph;0006012	the dark and luminous matter coupling in the formation of spheroids: a  sph investigation	using n-body/hydrodynamical simulations which include prescriptions for starformation, feed-back and chemical evolution, we explore the interaction betweenbaryons and dark matter at galactic scale. the n-body simulations are performedusing a tree-sph code that follows the evolution of individual dm halos insidewhich stars form from cooling gas, and evolve delivering in the interstellarmedium mass, metals, and energy. we examine the formation and evolution of agiant and a dwarf elliptical galaxy of total mass 10^12 and 10^9 solar masses,respectively. starting from an initial density profile like the universalnavarro profile in the inner region, baryons sink towards the center due tocooling energy losses. at the end of the collapse, the innermost part (1/20 ofthe halo size) of the galaxy is baryon-dominated, whereas the outer regions aredm dominated. the star formation proceeds at much faster speed in the giantgalaxy where a spheroid of 8 \times 10^10 solar masses is formed in 2 gyr, withrespect to the dwarf galaxy where the spheroid of 2 \times 10^7 solar masses isformed in 4 gyr. for the two objects the final distribution of stars is wellfitted by a hernquist profile with effective radii of r_e = 30 kpc, and 2.8kpc, respectively. the dark-to-luminous tarnsition radius r_ibd occurs roughlyat 1 r_e, as in real ellipticals. the dm halo density evolution isnon-adiabatic and does not lead to a core radius.

astro-ph;0309136	morphological evolution of dwarf galaxies in the local group	the dwarf galaxies of the local group can be separated in three morphologicalgroups: irregular, elliptical and spheroidal. as in the large galaxy clusters,there seems to be a morphology-position relationship: irregular galaxies arepreferentially found in the outskirts (low density regions) of the local group,whereas dwarf ellipticals and spheroidals are more frequent in the central,high density regions. to cast light on the nature and origin of dwarf galaxiesin the local group, mayer et al.(2001) have suggested that a dwarf irregulargalaxy tidally interacting with a galaxy of much larger mass may be re-shapedinto a dwarf spheroidal or elliptical object. in this paper we check by meansof n-body tree-sph simulations whether this is possible for a selected sampleof galaxies of the local group. using the best data available in literature tofix the dynamical and kinematical status of a few dwarf galaxies in the localgroup, we follow the evolution of an ideal satellite, which supposedly startedas an irregular object during its orbital motion around the milky way. we findthat the tidal interactions with the milky way remove a large fraction of themass of the dwarf irregular and gradually reshape it into a spherical object.

(2002). ages, age spreads and distances are thenestimated by comparing the colour magnitude diagrams and the hertzsprung-russeldiagram with post and pre-main sequence tracks and isochrones. we find thattrumpler 14 and collinder 232 lie at the same distance from the sun (about 2.5kpc), whereas trumpler 16 lies much further out, at about 4 kpc from the sun.as for the age, we find that trumpler 16 is older than both trumpler 14 andcollinder 232. for all the clusters we indicate the existence of a significantage dispersion, whose precise value is hampered by our inability to properlydistinguish members from non-members. we finally suggest that collinder 232 isa physical aggregate and provide estimates of its basic parameters.

astro-ph;0702253	whiting 1: the youngest globular cluster associated with the sgr dsph	recently, carraro (2005) drew attention to the remarkable star clusterwhiting 1 by showing that it lies about 40 kpc from the sun and is thereforeunquestionably a member of the galactic halo (b=-60.6 deg.). its cmd indicatedthat whiting 1 is very young (5 gyrs) for a globular cluster. it is very likelythat whiting 1 originated in a dwarf galaxy that has since been disrupted bythe milky way. deep ccd photometry in the bvi pass-bands obtained with the vltis used to improve the quality of the cmd and to determine the cluster'sluminosity function and surface density profile. high-resolution spectrogramsobtained with magellan are used to measure the cluster's radial velocity and toplace limits on its possible metallicity. the measurements of distance andradial velocity are used to test the cluster's membership in the stellarstreams from the sgr dsph. from our cmd of whiting 1, we derive new estimatesfor the cluster's age (6.5 gyrs), metallicity ([fe/h]=-0.65), and distance(29.4 kpc). from echelle spectrograms of three stars, we obtain -130.6 km/s forthe cluster's radial velocity and show from measurements of two infra-red caiilines that the [fe/h] of the cluster probably lies in the range -1.1 to -0.4.we demonstrate that the position of whiting 1 on the sky, its distance from thesun, and its radial velocity are identical to within the errors of both thetheoretical predictions of the trailing stream of stars from the sgr dsphgalaxy and the previous observations of the m giant stars that delineate thestreams. with the addition of whiting 1, there is now strong evidence that 6globular clusters formed within the sgr dsph.

astro-ph;9712011	the spatial distribution and luminosity function of the open cluster ngc  4815	ngc 4815 is a distant and populous open cluster, which lies in the galacticplane in a region of strong absorption. as a consequence, its membership,spatial distribution and luminosity function are not well determined. in thispaper, we present an algorithm which uses both positional and photometric datasimultaneously to search for open cluster members. the contribution of thefield stars is estimated by our galaxy model software. the method has beendeveloped for deep ccd photometric observations, but it can also be used toinvestigate the membership in an n-dimensional space, including proper motions,radial velocity and metallicity. a clean and well defined colour-magnitudediagram (cmd) for ngc 4815 has been obtained after decontaminating from fieldstars. we have investigated the spatial distribution of cluster members and theluminosity function. we have shown that the projected surface distribution ofstars is well-represented by an exponentially decreasing function with a scalelength of 1.67 $\pm$ 0.06 arcmin. we have found evidence for mass segregation.the luminosity function for ngc 4815 is similar to that of the hyades cluster,and shows a gap at $v$ = 15 mag.

astro-ph;9712307	galaxy formation and evolution: i. the padua treesph code (pd-sph)	in this paper we report on pd-sph the new tree-sph code developed in padua.the main features of the code are described and the results of a new andindependent series of 1-d and 3-d tests are shown. the paper is mainlydedicated to the presentation of the code and to the critical discussion of itsperformances. in particular great attention is devoted to the convergencyanalysis. the code is highly adaptive in space and time by means of individualsmoothing lengths and individual time steps. at present it contains both darkand baryonic matter, this latter in form of gas and stars, cooling, thermalconduction, star formation, and feed-back from type i and ii supernovae,stellar winds, and ultraviolet flux from massive stars, and finally chemicalenrichment. new cooling rates that depend on the metal abundance of theinterstellar medium are employed, and the differences with respect to thestandard ones are outlined. finally, we show the simulation of the dynamicaland chemical evolution of a disk-like galaxy with and without feed-back. thecode is suitably designed to study in a global fashion the problem of formationand evolution of elliptical galaxies, and in particular to feed aspectro-photometric code from which the integrated spectra, magnitudes, andcolors (together with their spatial gradients) can be derived.

astro-ph;9812278	near ir photometry of the old open clusters berkeley 17 and berkeley 18.  probing the age of the galactic disc	we report on near ir ($j$ and $k$ bands) observations of two $8 \times 8\~(arcmin)^{2}$ regions centered on the old open clusters berkeley~17 andberkeley~18, for which only optical photometry (in $b$,$v$ and $i$ bands)exists. $j$ and $k$ photometry allows us to obtain an independent estimate ofcluster metallicity by means of the relationship between the spectroscopicmetallicity and the red giant branch (rgb) slope calibrated by tiede et al(1997). from the analysis of the colour magnitude diagram (cmd) and luminosityfunction (lf), berkeley~17 turns out to have a metal content$[fe/h]~\sim~-0.35$. it is $9~gyr$ old, suffers from a reddening $e(b-v) = 0.58mag$ and has an heliocentric distance of $2.5 kpc$. berkeley~17 comes out to besubstantially younger than in previous work (age $\approx 13~gyr$). on theother hand berkeley~18 is found to have solar metal abundance, and to beyounger than berkeley~17, with an age of about $4~gyr$. while we confirmkaluzny (1997) reddening estimate, we significantly revise the distance of thecluster, which lies $4.5 kpc$ from the sun. these results on two open clustersbelieved to be between the oldest put constraints on the age and the evolutionof the galactic disc. the absence of clusters older than $8-9~gyr$ suggests thepossibility that the galaxy underwent a star formation minimum between 13 and$10~gyr$ ago.

astro-ph;9905356	is the galactic disk older than the halo?	aim of this study is to infer the age of the galactic disk by means of theages of old open clusters, and comment on some recent claims that the galacticdisk can be older than the halo. to this purpose, we analyze thecolor-magnitude diagrams (cmds) of six very old clusters, namely ngc 188, ngc6791, collinder 261, melotte 66, berkeley 39 and berkeley 17, and determinetheir ages. for each cluster we use the most recent photometric andspectroscopic data and metallicity estimates. the ages are derived from theisochrone fitting method using the stellar models of the padua library(bertelli et al . 1994, girardi et al. 1999). we find that the ages of theseclusters fall in the range 4 to 9-10 gyr: melotte 66 is the youngest whereasngc 6791 and berkeley 17 have ages of about 9-10 gyr. previous estimates forberkeley 17 indicated an age as old as 12 gyr, almost falling within the rangeof classical globular clusters. in our analysis, this cluster is always veryold but perhaps somewhat younger than in previous studies. however we callattention on the fact that the above ages are to be taken as provisionalestimates, because of the many uncertaintes still affecting stellar models inthe mass range 1.0 to 1.5 mo. despite this drawback of extant theory of stellarstructure, if ngc 6791 and berkeley 17 set the limit to the age of the galacticdisk, this component of the milky way can be as old as 9-10 gyr, but surelyyounger than the galactic halo, at least as inferred from recent determinationsof the age of globular clusters. finally, it is worth recalling that openclusters can only provide a lower limit to the age of the galactic disk, whileother indicators - like white dwarfs - are perhaps more suited to this task.

astro-ph;9912561	the elusive old population of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy leo i	we report the discovery of a significant old population in the dwarfspheroidal (dsph) galaxy leo i as a result of a wide-area search with the esonew technology telescope. studies of the stellar content of local group dwarfgalaxies have shown the presence of an old stellar population in almost all ofthe dwarf spheroidals. the only exception was leo i, which alone appeared tohave delayed its initial star formation episode until just a few gyr ago. thecolor-magnitude diagram of leo i now reveals an extended horizontal branch,unambiguously indicating the presence of an old, metal-poor population in theouter regions of this galaxy. yet we find little evidence for a stellarpopulation gradient, at least outside r &gt; 2' (0.16 kpc), since the oldhorizontal branch stars of leo i are radially distributed as their morenumerous intermediate-age helium-burning counterparts. the discovery of adefinitely old population in the predominantly young dwarf spheroidal galaxyleo i points to a sharply defined first epoch of star formation common to allof the local group dsph's as well as to the halo of the milky way.

0810.2007	searching for spiral features in the outer galactic disk. the field  towards wr38 and wr38a	the detailed spiral structure in the outer galactic disk is still poorlyknown, and for several galactic directions we rely on model extrapolations. oneof these regions is the fourth galactic quadrant, in the sector comprisedbetween vela and carina (270 &lt;l&lt; 300) where no spiral arms have been detectedso far in the optical beyond 270. by means of deep ubvi photometry, we searchfor spiral features in known low absorption windows.u photometry, althoughdemanding, constitutes a powerful tool to detect and characterize distantaggregates, and allows to derive firmer distance estimates. we studied adirection close to the tangent (l=290) to the carina arm, in an attempt todetect optical spiral tracers beyond the carina branch, where radioobservations and models predictions indicate the presence of the extension ofthe perseus and norma-cygnus spiral arms in the fourth quadrant.along this lineof sight, we detect three distinct groups of young stars. two of them, at 2.5and 6.0 kpc, belong to the carina spiral arm (which is crossed twice in thisparticular direction).the latter is here detected for the first time. the thirdgroup, at a distance of 12.7 kpc, is part of the perseus arm which lies beyondthe carina arm, and constitutes the first optical detection of this arm in thefourth galactic quadrant. the position of this feature is compatible with hiobservations and model predictions. we furthermore present evidence that thisextremely distant group, formerly thought to be a star cluster (shorlin 1), isin fact a diffuse young population. in addition, our data-set does not supportthe possible presence of the monoceros ring toward this direction. this studyhighlights how multicolor optical studies can be effective to probe the spiralstructure in the outer galactic disk.
