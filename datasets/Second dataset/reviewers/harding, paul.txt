0903.3043	mapping the galactic halo viii: quantifying substructure	we have measured the amount of kinematic substructure in the galactic halousing the final data set from the spaghetti project, a pencil-beam highlatitude sky survey. our sample contains 101 photometrically selected andspectroscopically confirmed giants with accurate distance, radial velocity andmetallicity information. we have developed a new clustering estimator: the"4distance" measure, which when applied to our data set leads to theidentification of 1 group and 7 pairs of clumped stars. the group, with 6members, can confidently be matched to tidal debris of the sagittarius dwarfgalaxy. two pairs match the properties of known virgo structures. using modelsof the disruption of sagittarius in galactic potentials with different degreesof dark halo flattening, we show that this favors a spherical or prolate haloshape, as demonstrated by newberg et al. (2007) using sdss data. one additionalpair can be linked to older sagittarius debris. we find that 20% of the starsin the spaghetti data set are in substructures. from comparison with randomdata sets we derive a very conservative lower limit of 10% to the amount ofsubstructure in the halo. however, comparison to numerical simulations showsthat our results are also consistent with a halo entirely built up fromdisrupted satellites, provided the dominating features are relatively broad dueto early merging or relatively heavy progenitor satellites.

0905.4502	tracing sagittarius structure with sdss and segue imaging and  spectroscopy	we show that the sagittarius dwarf tidal stream can be traced with very redk/m-giant stars selected from sdss photometry. a subset of these stars arespectroscopically confirmed with segue and sdss spectra, and the distance scaleof 2mass and sdss m giants is calibrated to the rr lyrae distance scale. theabsolute g band magnitude of the k/m-giant stars at the tip of the giant branchis m_g=-1.0. the line-of-sight velocities of the m giant and bhb stars that arespatially coincident with the sgr dwarf tidal stream are consistent with thoseof previous authors, reinforcing the need for new models that can explain allof the sgr tidal debris stream observations. we estimate stellar densitiesalong the tidal tails that can be used to help constrain future models. thek/m-giant, bhb, and f-turnoff stars in the lower surface brightness tidalstream that is adjacent to the main leading sgr dwarf tidal tail havevelocities and metallicities that are similar to those of the stars in theleading tidal tail. the ratio of k/m giants to bhbs and bhbs to f-turnoff starsare also similar for both branches of the leading tidal tail. we show thatthere is an additional low-metallicity tidal stream near the sgr trailing tidaltail.

0906.4703	the connection between diffuse light and intracluster planetary nebulae  in the virgo cluster	we compare the distribution of diffuse intracluster light detected in thevirgo cluster via broadband imaging with that inferred from searches forintracluster planetary nebulae (ipne). we find a rough correspondence on largescales (~ 100 kpc) between the two, but with very large scatter (~ 1.3mag/arcsec^2). on smaller scales (1 -- 10 kpc), the presence or absence ofcorrelation is clearly dependent on the underlying surface brightness. on thesescales, we find a correlation in regions of higher surface brightness (mu_v &lt;~27) which are dominated by the halos of large galaxies such as m87, m86, andm84. in those cases, we are likely tracing pne associated with galaxies ratherthan true ipne. in true intracluster fields, at lower surface brightness, thecorrelation between luminosity and ipn candidates is much weaker. while acorrelation between broadband light and ipne is expected based on stellarpopulations, a variety of statistical, physical, and methodological effects canact to wash out this correlation and explain the lack of a strong correlationat lower surface brightness found here.

0707.4477	halo star streams in the solar neighborhood	we have assembled a sample of halo stars in the solar neighborhood to lookfor halo substructure in velocity and angular momentum space. our sampleincludes red giants, rr lyrae, and red horizontal branch stars within 2.5 kpcof the sun with [fe/h] less than -1.0. it was chosen to include stars withaccurate distances, space velocities, and metallicities as well aswell-quantified errors. we confirm the existence of the streams found by helmiand coworkers, which we refer to as the h99 streams. these streams have adouble-peaked velocity distribution in the z direction. we use the results ofmodeling of the h99 streams by helmi and collaborators to test how one mightuse v_z velocity information and radial velocity information to detectkinematic substructure in the halo. we find that detecting the h99 streams withradial velocities alone would require a large sample. we use the velocitydistribution of the h99 streams to estimate their age. from our model of theprogenitor of the h99 streams, we determine that it was accreted between 6 and9 gyr ago. the h99 streams have [alpha/fe] abundances similar to other halostars in the solar neighborhood, suggesting that the gas that formed thesestars were enriched mostly by type ii sne. we have also discovered in angularmomentum space two other possible substructures, which we refer to as theretrograde and prograde outliers. the retrograde outliers are likely to be halosubstructure, but the prograde outliers are most likely part of the smoothhalo. the retrograde outliers have significant structure in the v_phi directionand show a range of [alpha/fe]. the methods presented in this paper can be usedto exploit the kinematic information present in future large databases likerave, sdssii/segue, and gaia.

1003.4500	optical colors of intracluster light in the virgo cluster core	we continue our deep optical imaging survey of the virgo cluster using thecwru burrell schmidt telescope by presenting b-band surface photometry of thecore of the virgo cluster in order to study the cluster's intracluster light(icl). we find icl features down to mu_b ~ 29 mag sq. arcsec, confirming theresults of mihos et al. (2005), who saw a vast web of low-surface brightnessstreams, arcs, plumes, and diffuse light in the virgo cluster core using v-bandimaging. by combining these two data sets, we are able to measure the opticalcolors of many of the cluster's low-surface brightness features. while much ofour imaging area is contaminated by galactic cirrus, the cluster core near thecd galaxy, m87, is unobscured. we trace the color profile of m87 out to over2000 arcsec, and find a blueing trend with radius, continuing out to thelargest radii. moreover, we have measured the colors of several icl featureswhich extend beyond m87's outermost reaches and find that they have similarcolors to the m87's halo itself, b-v ~ 0.8. the common colors of these featuressuggests that the extended outer envelopes of cd galaxies, such as m87, may beformed from similar streams, created by tidal interactions within the cluster,that have since dissolved into a smooth background in the cluster potential.

1004.1473	diffuse tidal structures in the halos of virgo ellipticals	we use deep v-band surface photometry of five of the brightest ellipticalgalaxies in the virgo cluster to search for diffuse tidal streams, shells, andplumes in their outer halos (r &gt; 50 kpc). we fit and subtract ellipticalisophotal models from the galaxy images to reveal a variety of substructure,with surface brightnesses in the range mu_v= 26-29 mag/arcsec^2. m49 possessesan extended, interleaved shell system reminiscent of the radial accretion of asatellite companion, while m89's complex system of shells and plumes suggests amore complicated accretion history involving either multiple events or a majormerger. m87 has a set of long streamers as might be expected from stripping oflow luminosity dwarfs on radial orbits in virgo. m86 also displays a number ofsmall streams indicative of stripping of dwarf companions, but these comprisemuch less luminosity than those of m87. only m84 lacks significant tidalfeatures. we quantify the photometric properties of these structures, anddiscuss their origins in the context of each galaxy's environment andkinematics within the virgo cluster.

1101.1529	sdss-iii: massive spectroscopic surveys of the distant universe, the  milky way galaxy, and extra-solar planetary systems	building on the legacy of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss-i and ii),sdss-iii is a program of four spectroscopic surveys on three scientific themes:dark energy and cosmological parameters, the history and structure of the milkyway, and the population of giant planets around other stars. in keeping withsdss tradition, sdss-iii will provide regular public releases of all its data,beginning with sdss dr8 (which occurred in jan 2011). this paper presents anoverview of the four sdss-iii surveys. boss will measure redshifts of 1.5million massive galaxies and lya forest spectra of 150,000 quasars, using thebao feature of large scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations ofthe distance scale and hubble expansion rate at z&lt;0.7 and at z~2.5. segue-2,which is now completed, measured medium-resolution (r=1800) optical spectra of118,000 stars in a variety of target categories, probing chemical evolution,stellar kinematics and substructure, and the mass profile of the dark matterhalo from the solar neighborhood to distances of 100 kpc. apogee will obtainhigh-resolution (r~30,000), high signal-to-noise (s/n&gt;100 per resolutionelement), h-band (1.51-1.70 micron) spectra of 10^5 evolved, late-type stars,measuring separate abundances for ~15 elements per star and creating the firsthigh-precision spectroscopic survey of all galactic stellar populations (bulge,bar, disks, halo) with a uniform set of stellar tracers and spectraldiagnostics. marvels will monitor radial velocities of more than 8000 fgk starswith the sensitivity and cadence (10-40 m/s, ~24 visits per star) needed todetect giant planets with periods up to two years, providing an unprecedenteddata set for understanding the formation and dynamical evolution of giantplanet systems.

1101.1559	the eighth data release of the sloan digital sky survey: first data from  sdss-iii	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) started a new phase in august 2008, withnew instrumentation and new surveys focused on galactic structure and chemicalevolution, measurements of the baryon oscillation feature in the clustering ofgalaxies and the quasar ly alpha forest, and a radial velocity search forplanets around ~8000 stars. this paper describes the first data release ofsdss-iii (and the eighth counting from the beginning of the sdss). the releaseincludes five-band imaging of roughly 5200 deg^2 in the southern galactic cap,bringing the total footprint of the sdss imaging to 14,555 deg^2, or over athird of the celestial sphere. all the imaging data have been reprocessed withan improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final, self-consistent photometricrecalibration and flat-field determination. this release also includes all datafrom the second phase of the sloan extension for galactic understanding andevolution (segue-2), consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 starsat both high and low galactic latitudes. all the more than half a millionstellar spectra obtained with the sdss spectrograph have been reprocessedthrough an improved stellar parameters pipeline, which has better determinationof metallicity for high metallicity stars.

1101.3779	star clusters in m31: ii. old cluster metallicities and ages from  hectospec data	we present new high signal-to-noise spectroscopic data on the m31 globularcluster system, obtained with the hectospec multifiber spectrograph on the 6.5mmmt. more than 300 clusters have been observed at a resolution of 5a. theprimary focus of this paper is the determination of mean cluster metallicities,ages and reddenings. metallicities were estimated using a calibration of lickindices with [fe/h] provided by galactic gcs. the metallicity distribution isnot generally bimodal, in strong distinction with the bimodal galactic globulardistribution. rather, the m31 distribution shows a broad peak, centered at[fe/h]=-1, suggesting that the cluster systems of m31 and the milky way haddifferent formation histories. ages for clusters with [fe/h] &gt; -1 weredetermined using the automatic stellar population analysis program ez_ages. wefind no evidence for massive clusters in m31 with intermediate ages. moreover,we find that the mean ages of the old gcs are remarkably constant over about adecade in metallicity (-0.95 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; 0.0).

1104.3114	formation and evolution of the disk system of the milky way: [alpha/fe]  ratios and kinematics of the segue g-dwarf sample	we employ measurements of the [alpha/fe] ratio derived from low-resolution(r~2000) spectra of 17,277 g-type dwarfs from the segue survey to separate theminto likely thin- and thick-disk subsamples. both subsamples exhibit stronggradients of orbital rotational velocity with metallicity, of opposite signs,-20 to -30 km/s/dex for the thin-disk and +40 to +50 km/s/dex for thethick-disk population. the rotational velocity is uncorrelated withgalactocentric distance for the thin-disk subsample, and exhibits a small trendfor the thick-disk subsample. the rotational velocity decreases with distancefrom the plane for both disk components, with similar slopes (-9.0 {\pm} 1.0km/s/kpc). thick-disk stars exhibit a strong trend of orbital eccentricity withmetallicity (about -0.2/dex), while the eccentricity does not change withmetallicity for the thin-disk subsample. the eccentricity is almost independentof galactocentric radius for the thin-disk population, while a marginalgradient of the eccentricity with radius exists for the thick-disk population.both subsamples possess similar positive gradients of eccentricity withdistance from the galactic plane. the shapes of the eccentricity distributionsfor the thin- and thick-disk populations are independent of distance from theplane, and include no significant numbers of stars with eccentricity above 0.6.among several contemporary models of disk evolution we consider, radialmigration appears to have played an important role in the evolution of thethin-disk population, but possibly less so for the thick disk, relative to thegas-rich merger or disk heating scenarios. we emphasize that more physicallyrealistic models and simulations need to be constructed in order to carry outthe detailed quantitative comparisons that our new data enable.

1112.2214	the metallicity distribution functions of segue g and k dwarfs:  constraints for disk chemical evolution and formation	we present the metallicity distribution function (mdf) for 24,270 g and16,847 k dwarfs at distances from 0.2 to 2.3 kpc from the galactic plane, basedon spectroscopy from the sloan extension for galactic understanding andexploration (segue) survey. this stellar sample is significantly larger in bothnumber and volume than previous spectroscopic analyses, which were limited tothe solar vicinity, making it ideal for comparison with local volume-limitedsamples and galactic models. for the first time, we have corrected the mdf forthe various observational biases introduced by the segue target selectionstrategy. the segue sample is particularly notable for k dwarfs, which are toofaint to examine spectroscopically far from the solar neighborhood. the mdf ofboth spectral types becomes more metal-poor with increasing |z|, which reflectsthe transition from a sample with small [alpha/fe] values at small heights toone with enhanced [alpha/fe] above 1 kpc. comparison of our segue distributionsto those of two different milky way models reveals that both are moremetal-rich than our observed distributions at all heights above the plane. ourunbiased observations of g and k dwarfs provide valuable constraints over the|z|-height range of the milky way disk for chemical and dynamical galaxyevolution models, previously only calibrated to the solar neighborhood, withparticular utility for thin- and thick-disk formation models.

1203.1641	exploring the unusually high black hole-to-bulge mass ratios in ngc4342  and ngc4291: the asynchronous growth of bulges and black holes	we study two nearby, early-type galaxies, ngc4342 and ngc4291, that hostunusually massive black holes relative to their low stellar mass. the observedblack hole-to-bulge mass ratios of ngc4342 and ngc4291 are ~6.9% and ~1.9%,respectively, which significantly exceed the typical observed ratio of ~0.2%.as a consequence of the exceedingly large black hole-to-bulge mass ratios,ngc4342 and ngc4291 are ~5.1 sigma and ~3.4 sigma outliers from the m_bh -m_bulge scaling relation, respectively. in this paper, we explore the origin ofthe unusually high black hole-to-bulge mass ratio. based on chandra x-rayobservations of the hot gas content of ngc4342 and ngc4291, we computegravitating mass profiles, and conclude that both galaxies reside in massivedark matter halos, which extend well beyond the stellar light. the presence ofdark matter halos around ngc4342 and ngc4291 and a deep optical image of theenvironment of ngc4342 indicate that tidal stripping, in which &gt;90% of thestellar mass was lost, cannot explain the observed high black hole-to-bulgemass ratios. therefore, we conclude that these galaxies formed with low stellarmasses, implying that the bulge and black hole did not grow in tandem. we alsofind that the black hole mass correlates well with the properties of the darkmatter halo, suggesting that dark matter halos may play a major role inregulating the growth of the supermassive black holes.

1203.6594	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: baryon acoustic oscillations in the data release 9  spectroscopic galaxy sample	we present measurements of galaxy clustering from the baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss), which is part of the sloan digital sky survey iii(sdss-iii). these use the data release 9 (dr9) cmass sample, which contains264,283 massive galaxies covering 3275 square degrees with an effectiveredshift z=0.57 and redshift range 0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7. assuming a concordancelambda-cdm cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2gpc^3, and represents the largest sample of the universe ever surveyed at thisdensity, n = 3 x 10^-4 h^-3 mpc^3. we measure the angle-averaged galaxycorrelation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstructionof the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature. the acoustic features aredetected at a significance of 5\sigma in both the correlation function andpower spectrum. combining with the sdss-ii luminous red galaxy sample, thedetection significance increases to 6.7\sigma. fitting for the position of theacoustic features measures the distance to z=0.57 relative to the sound horizondv /rs = 13.67 +/- 0.22 at z=0.57. assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds toa distance dv(z=0.57) = 2094 +/- 34 mpc. at 1.7 per cent, this is the mostprecise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. we place thisresult alongside previous bao measurements in a cosmological distance ladderand find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. we usethese distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, findingcontinuing support for a flat universe with a cosmological constant.

1209.2251	the metallicity profile of m31 from spectroscopy of hundreds of hii  regions and pne	the oxygen abundance gradients among nebular emission line regions in spiralgalaxies have been used as important constraints for models of chemicalevolution. we present the largest ever full-wavelength optical spectroscopicsample of emission line nebulae in a spiral galaxy (m31). we have collectedspectra of 253 hii regions and 407 planetary nebulae with the hectospecmulti-fiber spectrograph of the mmt. we measure the line-of-sight extinctionfor 199 hii regions and 333 pne; we derive oxygen abundance directly, based onthe electron temperature, for 51 pne; and we use strong line methods toestimate oxygen abundance for 192 hii regions and nitrogen abundance for 52 hiiregions. the relatively shallow oxygen abundance gradient of the more extendedhii regions in our sample is generally in agreement with the result of zaritskyet al. (1994), based on only 19 m31 hii regions, but varies with thestrong-line diagnostic employed. our large sample size demonstrates that thereis significant intrinsic scatter around this abundance gradient, as much as 3times the systematic uncertainty in the strong line diagnostics. the intrinsicscatter is similar in the nitrogen abundances, although the gradient issignificantly steeper. on small scales (deprojected distance &lt; 0.5 kpc), hiiregions exhibit local variations in oxygen abundance that are larger than 0.3dex in 33% of neighboring pairs. we do not identify a significant oxygenabundance gradient among pne, but we do find a significant gradient in the [nii] ratio that varies systematically with surface brightness. our resultsunderscore the complex and inhomogeneous nature of the ism of m31, and ourdataset illustrates systematic effects relevant to future studies of themetallicity gradients in nearby spiral galaxies.

1211.0549	the segue k giant survey ii: a catalog of distance determinations for  the segue k giants in the galactic halo	we present an online catalog of distance determinations for $\rm 6036$ kgiants, most of which are members of the milky way's stellar halo. theirmedium-resolution spectra from sdss/segue are used to derive metallicities andrough gravity estimates, along with radial velocities. distance moduli arederived from a comparison of each star's apparent magnitude with the absolutemagnitude of empirically calibrated color-luminosity fiducials, at the observed$(g-r)_0$ color and spectroscopic [fe/h]. we employ a probabilistic approachthat makes it straightforward to properly propagate the errors inmetallicities, magnitudes, and colors into distance uncertainties. we also foldin ${\it prior}$ information about the giant-branch luminosity function and thedifferent metallicity distributions of the segue k-giant targetingsub-categories. we show that the metallicity prior plays a small role in thedistance estimates, but that neglecting the luminosity prior could lead to asystematic distance modulus bias of up to 0.25 mag, compared to the case ofusing the luminosity prior. we find a median distance precision of $16\%$, withdistance estimates most precise for the least metal-poor stars near the tip ofthe red-giant branch. the precision and accuracy of our distance estimates arevalidated with observations of globular and open clusters. the stars in ourcatalog are up to 125 kpc distant from the galactic center, with 283 starsbeyond 50 kpc, forming the largest available spectroscopic sample of distanttracers in the galactic halo.

1211.3095	the extended optical disk of m101	we have used deep, wide-field optical imaging to study the faint outskirts ofthe luminous spiral galaxy m101 (ngc 5457), as well as its surroundingenvironment. over six square degrees, our imaging has a limiting surfacebrightness of mu_b ~ 29.5 mag/arcsec^2, and has revealed the stellar structureof m101's disk out to nearly 25 arcminutes (50 kpc), three times our measuredr25 isophotal size of the optical disk. at these radii, the well-knownasymmetry of the inner disk slews 180 degrees, resulting in an asymmetric plumeof light at large radius which follows the very extended hi disk to thenortheast of m101. this plume has very blue colors (b-v ~ 0.2), suggesting itis the somewhat more evolved (few hundred myr to ~ 1 gyr) counterpart of theyoung far ultraviolet emitting population traced by galex imaging. we alsodetect another, redder spur of extended light to the east of the disk, and bothstructures are reminiscent of features produced during fly-by galaxyinteractions. however, we see no evidence of very extended tidal tails aroundm101 or any of its companions which might be expected from a recent encounterwith a massive companion. we consider the properties of m101's outer disk inlight of possible past interactions with the nearby companion galaxies ngc 5477and ngc 5474. the detection of optical starlight at such large radii gives usthe ability to study star formation histories and stellar populations in outerdisks over a longer timescales than those traced by the uv or halpha emittingpopulations. our data suggest ongoing buildup of the m101's outer disk due toencounters in the group environment triggering extended star formation andtidal heating of existing disk populations.

1301.4898	stellar populations in the outer halo of the massive elliptical m49	we use deep surface photometry of the giant elliptical m49 (ngc 4472),obtained as part of our survey for diffuse light in the virgo cluster, to studythe stellar populations in its outer halo. our data trace m49's stellar haloout to ~ 100 kpc (7 re), where we find that the shallow color gradient seen inthe inner regions becomes dramatically steeper. the outer regions of the galaxyare quite blue (b-v ~ 0.7); if this is purely a metallicity effect, it arguesfor extremely metal poor stellar populations with [fe/h] &lt; -1. we also findthat the extended accretion shells around m49 are distinctly redder than thegalaxy's surrounding halo, suggesting that we are likely witnessing the buildupof both the stellar mass and metallicity in m49's outer halo due to late timeaccretion. while such growth of galaxy halos is predicted by models ofhierarchical accretion, this growth is thought to be driven by more massiveaccretion events which have correspondingly higher mean metallicity thaninferred for m49's halo. thus the extremely metal-poor nature of m49's extendedhalo provides some tension against current models for elliptical galaxyformation.

1308.6590	star clusters in m31. v. evidence for self-enrichment in old m31  clusters from integrated spectroscopy	in the past decade, the notion that globular clusters (gcs) are composed ofcoeval stars with homogeneous initial chemical compositions has been challengedby growing evidence that they host an intricate stellar population mix, likelyindicative of a complex history of star formation and chemical enrichment.several models have been proposed to explain the existence of multiple stellarpopulations in gcs, but no single model provides a fully satisfactory match toexisting data. correlations between chemistry and global parameters such ascluster mass or luminosity are fundamental clues to the physics of gcformation. in this letter, we present an analysis of the mean abundances of fe,mg, c, n, and ca for 72 old gcs from the andromeda galaxy. we show for thefirst time that there is a correlation between the masses of gcs and the meanstellar abundances of nitrogen, spanning almost two decades in mass. thisresult sheds new light on the formation of gcs, providing important constraintson their internal chemical evolution and mass loss history.

1309.7479	short grb 130603b: discovery of a jet break in the optical and radio  afterglows, and a mysterious late-time x-ray excess	we present radio, optical/nir, and x-ray observations of the afterglow of theshort-duration 130603b, and uncover a break in the radio and optical bands at0.5 d after the burst, best explained as a jet break with an inferred jetopening angle of 4-8 deg. grb 130603b is only the third short grb with a radioafterglow detection to date, and the first time that a jet break is evident inthe radio band. we model the temporal evolution of the spectral energydistribution to determine the burst explosion properties and find anisotropic-equivalent kinetic energy of (0.6-1.7) x 10^51 erg and a circumburstdensity of 5 x 10^-3-30 cm^-3. from the inferred opening angle of grb 130603b,we calculate beaming-corrected energies of egamma (0.5-2) x 10^49 erg and ek(0.1-1.6) x 10^49 erg. along with previous measurements and lower limits wefind a median short grb opening angle of 10 deg. using the all-sky observedrate of 10 gpc^-3 yr^-1, this implies a true short grb rate of 20 yr^-1 within200 mpc, the advanced ligo/virgo sensitivity range for neutron star binarymergers. finally, we uncover evidence for significant excess emission in thex-ray afterglow of grb 130603b at &gt;1 d and conclude that the additional energycomponent could be due to fall-back accretion or spin-down energy from amagnetar formed following the merger.

1403.1872	testing the asteroseismic mass scale using metal-poor stars  characterized with apogee and kepler	fundamental stellar properties, such as mass, radius, and age, can beinferred using asteroseismology. cool stars with convective envelopes haveturbulent motions that can stochastically drive and damp pulsations. theproperties of the oscillation frequency power spectrum can be tied to mass andradius through solar-scaled asteroseismic relations. stellar properties derivedusing these scaling relations need verification over a range of metallicities.because the age and mass of halo stars are well-constrained by astrophysicalpriors, they provide an independent, empirical check on asteroseismic massestimates in the low-metallicity regime. we identify nine metal-poor red giants(including six stars that are kinematically associated with the halo) from asample observed by both the kepler space telescope and the sloan digital skysurvey-iii apogee spectroscopic survey. we compare masses inferred usingasteroseismology to those expected for halo and thick-disk stars. although oursample is small, standard scaling relations, combined with asteroseismicparameters from the apokasc catalog, produce masses that are systematicallyhigher (&lt;{\delta}m&gt;=0.17+/-0.05 msun) than astrophysical expectations. themagnitude of the mass discrepancy is reduced by known theoretical correctionsto the measured large frequency separation scaling relationship. usingalternative methods for measuring asteroseismic parameters induces systematicshifts at the 0.04 msun level. we also compare published asteroseismic analyseswith scaling relationship masses to examine the impact of using the frequencyof maximum power as a constraint. upcoming apokasc observations will provide alarger sample of ~100 metal-poor stars, important for detailed asteroseismiccharacterization of galactic stellar populations.

1405.6724	the vertical metallicity gradient of the milky way disk: transitions in  [a/fe] populations	using g dwarfs from the sloan extension for galactic understanding andexploration (segue) survey, we have determined a vertical metallicity gradientover a large volume of the milky way's disk, and examined how this gradientvaries for different [a/fe] subsamples. this sample contains over 40,000 starswith low-resolution spectroscopy over 144 lines of sight. we employ the seguestellar parameter pipeline (sspp) to obtain estimates of effective temperature,surface gravity, [fe/h], and [a/fe] for each star and extract multiplevolume-complete subsamples of approximately 1000 stars each. based on thesurvey's consistent target-selection algorithm, we adjust each subsample todetermine an unbiased picture of the disk in [fe/h] and [a/fe]; consequently,each individual star represents the properties of many. the segue sample allowsus to constrain the vertical metallicity gradient for a large number of starsover a significant volume of the disk, between ~0.3 and 1.6 kpc from thegalactic plane, and examine the in situ structure, in contrast to previousanalyses which are more limited in scope. this work does not pre-suppose a diskstructure, whether composed of a single complex population or a distinct thinand thick disk component. the metallicity gradient is -0.243 +0.039 -0.053dex/kpc for the sample as a whole, which we compare to various literatureresults. each [a/fe] subsample dominates at a different range of heights abovethe plane of the galaxy, which is exhibited in the gradient found in the sampleas a whole. stars over a limited range in [a/fe] show little change in median[fe/h] with height. if we associate [a/fe] with age, our consistent verticalmetallicity gradients with [a/fe] suggest that stars formed in different epochsexhibit comparable vertical structure, implying similar star-formationprocesses and evolution.

1410.2503	the apokasc catalog: an asteroseismic and spectroscopic joint survey of  targets in the kepler fields	we present the first apokasc catalog of spectroscopic and asteroseismicproperties of 1916 red giants observed in the kepler fields. the spectroscopicparameters provided from the apache point observatory galactic evolutionexperiment project are complemented with asteroseismic surface gravities,masses, radii, and mean densities determined by members of the keplerasteroseismology science consortium. we assess both random and systematicsources of error and include a discussion of sample selection for giants in thekepler fields. total uncertainties in the main catalog properties are of order80 k in teff , 0.06 dex in [m/h], 0.014 dex in log g, and 12% and 5% in massand radius, respectively; these reflect a combination of systematic and randomerrors. asteroseismic surface gravities are substantially more precise andaccurate than spectroscopic ones, and we find good agreement between their meanvalues and the calibrated spectroscopic surface gravities. there are, however,systematic underlying trends with teff and log g. our effective temperaturescale is between 0-200 k cooler than that expected from the infrared fluxmethod, depending on the adopted extinction map, which provides evidence for alower value on average than that inferred for the kepler input catalog (kic).we find a reasonable correspondence between the photometric kic andspectroscopic apokasc metallicity scales, with increased dispersion in kicmetallicities as the absolute metal abundance decreases, and offsets in teffand log g consistent with those derived in the literature. we present meanfitting relations between apokasc and kic observables and discuss futureprospects, strengths, and limitations of the catalog data.

1412.1482	overview of the sdss-iv manga survey: mapping nearby galaxies at apache  point observatory	we present an overview of a new integral field spectroscopic survey calledmanga (mapping nearby galaxies at apache point observatory), one of three coreprograms in the fourth-generation sloan digital sky survey (sdss-iv) that beganon 2014 july 1. manga will investigate the internal kinematic structure andcomposition of gas and stars in an unprecedented sample of 10,000 nearbygalaxies. we summarize essential characteristics of the instrument and surveydesign in the context of manga's key science goals and present prototypeobservations to demonstrate manga's scientific potential. manga employsdithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary indiameter from 12" (19 fibers) to 32" (127 fibers). two dual-channelspectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 a atr~2000. with a typical integration time of 3 hr, manga reaches a target r-bandsignal-to-noise ratio of 4-8 (per a, per 2" fiber) at 23 ab mag per sq. arcsec,which is typical for the outskirts of manga galaxies. targets are selected withstellar mass greater than 1e9 msun using sdss-i redshifts and i-band luminosityto achieve uniform radial coverage in terms of the effective radius, anapproximately flat distribution in stellar mass, and a sample spanning a widerange of environments. analysis of our prototype observations demonstratesmanga's ability to probe gas ionization, shed light on recent star formationand quenching, enable dynamical modeling, decompose constituent components, andmap the composition of stellar populations. manga's spatially resolved spectrawill enable an unprecedented study of the astrophysics of nearby galaxies inthe coming 6 yr.

1501.00963	the eleventh and twelfth data releases of the sloan digital sky survey:  final data from sdss-iii	the third generation of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss-iii) took datafrom 2008 to 2014 using the original sdss wide-field imager, the original andan upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a new near-infraredhigh-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical interferometer. all the datafrom sdss-iii are now made public. in particular, this paper describes datarelease 11 (dr11) including all data acquired through 2013 july, and datarelease 12 (dr12) adding data acquired through 2014 july (including all dataincluded in previous data releases), marking the end of sdss-iii observing.relative to our previous public release (dr10), dr12 adds one million newspectra of galaxies and quasars from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples thenumber of h-band spectra of stars as part of the apache point observatory (apo)galactic evolution experiment (apogee), and includes repeated accurate radialvelocity measurements of 5500 stars from the multi-object apo radial velocityexoplanet large-area survey (marvels). the apogee outputs now include measuredabundances of 15 different elements for each star. in total, sdss-iii added2350 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of thesloan exploration of galactic understanding and evolution 2 (segue-2) survey;2,497,484 boss spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 apogee spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040marvels spectra of 5,513 stars. since its first light in 1998, sdss has imagedover 1/3 of the celestial sphere in five bands and obtained over five millionastronomical spectra.

1501.04599	deep imaging of m51: a new view of the whirlpool's extended tidal debris	we present deep, wide-field imaging of the m51 system using cwru's burrellschmidt telescope at kpno to study the faint tidal features that constrain itsinteraction history. our images trace m51's tidal morphology down to a limitingsurface brightness of $\mu_{b,lim}\sim $30 mag arcsec$^{-2}$, and provideaccurate colors ($\sigma_{b-v} &lt; 0.1$) down to $\mu_b\sim 28$. we identify twonew tidal streams in the system (the south and northeast plumes) with surfacebrightnesses of $\mu_b =29$ and luminosities of $\sim 10^6 l_{\odot,b}$. whilethe northeast plume may be a faint outer extension of the tidal "crown" northof ngc 5195 (m51b), the south plume has no analogue in any existing m51simulation and may represent a distinct tidal stream or disrupted dwarf galaxy.we also trace the extremely diffuse northwest plume out to a total extent of20' (43 kpc) from ngc 5194(m51a), and show it to be physically distinct fromthe overlapping bright tidal streams from m51b. the northwest plume'smorphology and red color ($b-v=0.8$) instead argue that it originated fromtidal stripping of m51a's extreme outer disk. finally, we confirm the strongsegregation of gas and stars in the southeast tail, and do not detect anydiffuse stellar component in the hi portion of the tail. extant simulations ofm51 have difficulty matching both the wealth of tidal structure in the systemand the lack of stars in the hi tail, motivating new modeling campaigns tostudy the dynamical evolution of this classic interacting system.

0704.0655	exploring the variable sky with the sloan digital sky survey	we quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using acatalog based on multiple sdss imaging observations. the catalog covers sdssstripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the sdss ugrizsystem for 1.4 million unresolved sources. in each photometric bandpass wecompute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select andstudy variable sources. we find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighterthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the gand r bands. the majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (&lt;2)quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adoptedflux-limited sample. we find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method forfinding low-redshift quasars as is the uv excess color selection (at highgalactic latitudes). we analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness forquasars and find that is centered on zero. we find that about 1/4 of thevariable stars are rr lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the mainstellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. the distribution oflightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellarlocus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with algol-likebehavior). using over six hundred rr lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halosubstructure out to distances of 100 kpc. we extrapolate these results toexpected performance by the large synoptic survey telescope and estimate thatit will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 millionlow-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.

1503.02110	chemical cartography with apogee: metallicity distribution functions and  the chemical structure of the milky way disk	using a sample of 69,919 red giants from the sdss-iii/apogee data release 12,we measure the distribution of stars in the [$\alpha$/fe] vs. [fe/h] plane andthe metallicity distribution functions (mdf) across an unprecedented volume ofthe milky way disk, with radius $3&lt;r&lt;15$ kpc and height $|z|&lt;2$ kpc. stars inthe inner disk ($r&lt;5$ kpc) lie along a single track in [$\alpha$/fe] vs.[fe/h], starting with $\alpha$-enhanced, metal-poor stars and ending at[$\alpha$/fe]$\sim0$ and [fe/h]$\sim+0.4$. at larger radii we find two distinctsequences in [$\alpha$/fe] vs. [fe/h] space, with a roughly solar-$\alpha$sequence that spans a decade in metallicity and a high-$\alpha$ sequence thatmerges with the low-$\alpha$ sequence at super-solar [fe/h]. the location ofthe high-$\alpha$ sequence is nearly constant across the disk, however thereare very few high-$\alpha$ stars at $r&gt;11$ kpc. the peak of the midplane mdfshifts to lower metallicity at larger $r$, reflecting the galactic metallicitygradient. most strikingly, the shape of the midplane mdf changes systematicallywith radius, with a negatively skewed distribution at $3&lt;r&lt;7$ kpc, to a roughlygaussian distribution at the solar annulus, to a positively skewed shape in theouter galaxy. for stars with $|z|&gt;1$ kpc or [$\alpha$/fe]$&gt;0.18$, the mdf showslittle dependence on $r$. the positive skewness of the outer disk mdf may be asignature of radial migration; we show that blurring of stellar populations byorbital eccentricities is not enough to explain the reversal of mdf shape but asimple model of radial migration can do so.

1503.09133	the segue k giant survey. iii. quantifying galactic halo substructure	we statistically quantify the amount of substructure in the milky way stellarhalo using a sample of 4568 halo k giant stars at galactocentric distancesranging over 5-125 kpc. these stars have been selected photometrically andconfirmed spectroscopically as k giants from the sloan digital sky survey'ssegue project. using a position-velocity clustering estimator (the 4distance)and a model of a smooth stellar halo, we quantify the amount of substructure inthe halo, divided by distance and metallicity. overall, we find that the haloas a whole is highly structured. we also confirm earlier work using bhb starswhich showed that there is an increasing amount of substructure with increasinggalactocentric radius, and additionally find that the amount of substructure inthe halo increases with increasing metallicity. comparing to resampled bhbstars, we find that k giants and bhbs have similar amounts of substructure overequivalent ranges of galactocentric radius. using a friends-of-friendsalgorithm to identify members of individual groups, we find that a largefraction (~33%) of grouped stars are associated with sgr, and identify starsbelonging to other halo star streams: the orphan stream, the cetus polarstream, and others, including previously unknown substructures. a largefraction of sample k giants (more than 50%) are not grouped into anysubstructure. we find also that the sgr stream strongly dominates groups in theouter halo for all except the most metal-poor stars, and suggest that this isthe source of the increase of substructure with galactocentric radius andmetallicity.

1507.02270	galaxies at the extremes: ultra-diffuse galaxies in the virgo cluster	we report the discovery of three large (r29 &gt;~ 1 arcminute) extremely lowsurface brightness (mu_(v,0) ~ 27.0) galaxies identified using our deep,wide-field imaging of the virgo cluster from the burrell schmidt telescope.complementary data from the next generation virgo cluster survey do not resolvered giant branch stars in these objects down to i=24, yielding a lower distancelimit of 2.5 mpc. at the virgo distance, these objects have half-light radii3-10 kpc and luminosities l_v=2-9x10^7 lsun. these galaxies are comparable insize but lower in surface brightness than the large ultradiffuse lsb galaxiesrecently identified in the coma cluster, and are located well within virgo'svirial radius; two are projected directly on the cluster core. one objectappears to be a nucleated lsb in the process of being tidally stripped to forma new virgo ultracompact dwarf galaxy. the others show no sign of tidaldisruption, despite the fact that such objects should be most vulnerable totidal destruction in the cluster environment. the relative proximity of virgomakes these objects amenable to detailed studies of their structural propertiesand stellar populations. they thus provide an important new window onto theconnection between cluster environment and galaxy evolution at the extremes.

1509.06529	sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey data release 12: galaxy  target selection and large scale structure catalogues	the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), part of the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) iii project, has provided the largest survey of galaxyredshifts available to date, in terms of both the number of galaxy redshiftsmeasured by a single survey, and the effective cosmological volume covered. keyto analysing the clustering of these data to provide cosmological measurementsis understanding the detailed properties of this sample. potential issuesinclude variations in the target catalogue caused by changes either in thetargeting algorithm or properties of the data used, the pattern ofspectroscopic observations, the spatial distribution of targets for whichredshifts were not obtained, and variations in the target sky density due toobservational systematics. we document here the target selection algorithmsused to create the galaxy samples that comprise boss. we also present thealgorithms used to create large scale structure catalogues for the final datarelease (dr12) samples and the associated random catalogues that quantify thesurvey mask. the algorithms are an evolution of those used by the boss team toconstruct catalogues from earlier data, and have been designed to accuratelyquantify the galaxy sample. the code used, designated mksample, is releasedwith this paper.

1511.01496	sdss-iv/manga: spectrophotometric calibration technique	mapping nearby galaxies at apache point observatory (manga), one of threecore programs in the sloan digital sky survey-iv (sdss-iv), is anintegral-field spectroscopic (ifs) survey of roughly 10,000 nearby galaxies. itemploys dithered observations using 17 hexagonal bundles of 2 arcsec fibers toobtain resolved spectroscopy over a wide wavelength range of 3,600-10,300a. tomap the internal variations within each galaxy, we need to perform accurate{\it spectral surface photometry}, which is to calibrate the specific intensityat every spatial location sampled by each individual aperture element of theintegral field unit. the calibration must correct only for the flux loss due toatmospheric throughput and the instrument response, but not for losses due tothe finite geometry of the fiber aperture. this requires the use of standardstar measurements to strictly separate these two flux loss factors (throughputversus geometry), a difficult challenge with standard single-fiber spectroscopytechniques due to various practical limitations. therefore, we developed atechnique for spectral surface photometry using multiple small fiber-bundlestargeting standard stars simultaneously with galaxy observations. we discussthe principles of our approach and how they compare to previous efforts, and wedemonstrate the precision and accuracy achieved. manga's relative calibrationbetween the wavelengths of h$\alpha$ and h$\beta$ has a root-mean-square (rms)of 1.7%, while that between [nii] $\lambda$6583a and [oii] $\lambda$3727a hasan rms of 4.7%. using extinction-corrected star formation rates and gas-phasemetallicities as an illustration, this level of precision guarantees that fluxcalibration errors will be sub-dominant when estimating these quantities. theabsolute calibration is better than 5% for more than 89% of manga's wavelengthrange.

astro-ph;0001492	mapping the galactic halo i. the `spaghetti' survey	we describe a major survey of the milky way halo designed to test forkinematic substructure caused by destruction of accreted satellites. we use thewashington photometric system to identify halo stars efficiently forspectroscopic followup. tracers include halo giants (detectable out to morethan 100 kpc), blue horizontal branch stars, halo stars near the main sequenceturnoff, and the ``blue metal-poor stars'' of preston et al (1994). wedemonstrate the success of our survey by showing spectra of stars we haveidentified in all these categories, including giants as distant as 75 kpc. wediscuss the problem of identifying the most distant halo giants. in particular,extremely metal-poor halo k dwarfs are present in approximately equal numbersto the distant giants for v fainter than 18, and we show that our method willdistinguish reliably between these two groups of metal-poor stars. we plan tosurvey 100 square degrees at high galactic latitude, and expect to increase thenumbers of known halo giants, bhb stars and turnoff stars by more than an orderof magnitude. in addition to the strong test that this large sample willprovide for the question `was the milky way halo accreted from satellitegalaxies?', we will improve the accuracy of mass measurements of the milky waybeyond 50 kpc via the kinematics of the many distant giants and bhb stars wewill find. we show that one of our first datasets constrains the halo densitylaw over galactocentric radii of 5-20 kpc and z heights of 2-15 kpc. the datasupport a flattened power-law halo with b/a of 0.6 and exponent -3.0. morecomplex models with a varying axial ratio may be needed with a larger dataset.

astro-ph;0309254	andromeda viii - a new tidally distorted satellite of m31	we report the detection of a new satellite of m31, projected close to m32.and viii is tidally distorted, with length ~10 kpc and width a few kpc. itcontains 5-12 planetary nebulae (pne) and 1-3 globular clusters, and has avelocity of -204 km/s with respect to m31, some 350 km/s away from m32'svelocity. there are also about 4 x 10^5 solar masses of hi, well-separated fromthe disk, at the same position and velocity. the satellite has luminosity of1.2-2.4 x 10^8 solar luminosities, and a central surface brightness of order\mu_v=24. both these values are typical of local group dwarf galaxies. itssurface brightness is some 6 magnitudes brighter than any of the stellarstreams found in the milky way or m31. the three associated globular clustershave reddening consistent with foreground reddening from the milky way only,making it likely that the satellite is in front of m31, unlike the giant tidalstream of ibata et al.(2001), which is behind m31 in the se quadrant. however,the major axis of and viii is aligned with the western edge of this giantstream, and we suggest that its unusual fan shape is caused by superposition oftwo streams, the westernmost of which was tidally stripped from and viii.

astro-ph;0403414	deep ccd surface photometry of galaxy clusters ii: searching for  intracluster starlight in non-cd clusters	we report the search for intracluster light in four abell type ii/iii(non-cd) galaxy clusters: abell 801, 1234, 1553, &amp; 1914. we find on averagethat these clusters contain $\sim$ 10% of their detected stellar luminosity ina diffuse component. we show that for two of the clusters the intraclusterlight closely follows the galaxy distribution, but in the other two cases,there are noticeable differences between the spatial distribution of thegalaxies and the intracluster light. we report the results of a search forintracluster tidal debris in each cluster, and note that abell 1914 inparticular has a number of strong tidal features likely due to its status as arecent cluster merger. one of the abell 1914 features appears to be spatiallycoincident with an extension seen in weak lensing maps, implying the featuretraces a large amount of mass. we compare these results to numericalsimulations of hierarchically-formed galaxy clusters, and find good generalagreement between the observed and simulated images, although we also find thatour observations sample only the brightest features of the intracluster light.together, these results suggest that intracluster light can be a valuable toolin determining the evolutionary state of galaxy clusters.

astro-ph;0408137	planetary nebulae kinematics in m31	we present kinematics of 135 planetary nebulae in m31 from a survey covering3.9 square degrees and extending out to 15 kpc from the southwest major axisand more than 20 kpc along the minor axis. the majority of our sample, evenwell outside the disk, shows significant rotational support (mean line-of-sightvelocity 116 km/s). we argue that these pn belong to the outer part of m31'slarge de vaucouleurs bulge. only five pn have velocities clearly inconsistentwith this fast rotating bulge. all five may belong to tidal streams in m31'souter halo. one is projected on the northern spur, and is counter-rotating withrespect to the disk there. two are projected along the major axis at x=-10 kpcand have m32-like velocities; they could be debris from that galaxy. theremaining two halo pn are located near the center of the galaxy and theirvelocities follow the gradient found by ibata et al. (2004), implying thatthese pn could belong to the southern stream. if m31 has a non-rotating,pressure-supported halo, we have yet to find it, and it must be a very minorcomponent of the galaxy.

astro-ph;0605580	rr lyrae variables in m33. i. evidence for a field halo population	we present observations of rr lyrae variables in the local group late-typespiral galaxy m33. using the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble spacetelescope, we have identified 64 ab-type rr lyraes in m33. we have estimatedreddenings for these stars based on their minimum light v-i colors andmetallicities based on their periods. from the distributions of theseproperties, we conclude that the rr lyraes belong to two populations - oneassociated with the halo of m33 and the other with its disk. given that rrlyraes are produced by populations older than ~10 gyr, this suggests that notonly does the field halo of m33 contain an old component, but so does its disk.this is one of the best pieces of evidence for the existence of a halo fieldcomponent in m33. using a relation between rr lyrae absolute magnitude andmetallicity (mv(rr) = 0.23[fe/h] + 0.93), we estimate a mean distance modulusof &lt;(m-m)o&gt; = 24.67 +/- 0.08 for m33. this places m33 approximately 70 kpcbeyond m31 in line-of-sight distance.

astro-ph;0611868	the stellar populations of m33's outer regions ii: deep acs imaging	studying the stellar populations in the outskirts of spiral galaxies canprovide important constraints on their structure, formation, and evolution. tothat end, we present vi photometry obtained with the advanced camera forsurveys for three fields located ~ 20' - 30' in projected distance southeast ofm33's nucleus (corresponding to ~ 4 - 6 visual scale lengths or ~ 9 - 13 kpc indeprojected radius). the color-magnitude diagrams reveal a mixed stellarpopulation whose youngest constituents have ages no greater than ~ 100 myr andwhose oldest members have ages of at least several gyr. the presence of starsas massive as 3 - 5 msun is consistent with global star formation thresholds indisk galaxies but could argue for a threshold in m33 that is on the low end ofobservational and theoretical expectations. the metallicity gradient asinferred by comparing the observed red giant branch (rgb) to the galacticglobular clusters is consistent with m33's inner disk gradient traced byseveral other studies. the surface density of rgb stars drops off exponentiallywith a radial scale length of 4.7' +/- 0.1'. the scale length increases withage in a manner similar to the vertical scale height of several nearbylate-type spirals. based on the metallicity gradient, density gradient, andmixed nature of the stellar populations, we conclude these fields are dominatedby a disk population although we cannot rule out the presence of a small halocomponent.

astro-ph;0611892	the stellar populations of m33's outer regions iii: star formation  history	we present a detailed analysis of the star formation history (sfh) of threefields in m33 located ~ 4 - 6 visual scale lengths from its nucleus. thesefields were imaged with the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble spacetelescope and reach ~ 2.5 magnitudes below the red clump of core helium burningstars. the observed color-magnitude diagrams are modeled as linear combinationsof individual synthetic populations with different ages and metallicities. togain a better understanding of the systematic errors we have conducted theanalysis with two different sets of stellar evolutionary tracks which wedesignate as padova (girardi et al. 2000) and teramo (pietrinferni et al.2004). the precise details of the results depend on which tracks are used butwe can make several conclusions that are fairly robust despite the differences.both sets of tracks predict the mean age to increase and the mean metallicityto decrease with radius. allowing age and metallicity to be free parameters andassuming star formation began ~ 14 gyr ago, we find that the mean age of allstars and stellar remnants increases from ~ 6 gyr to ~ 8 gyr and the meanglobal metallicity decreases from ~ -0.7 to ~ -0.9. the fraction of starsformed by 4.5 gyr ago increases from ~ 65% to ~ 80%. the mean star formationrate 80 - 800 myr ago decreases from ~ 30% of the lifetime average to just ~5%. the random errors on these estimates are ~ 10%, 1.0 gyr, and 0.1 dex. bycomparing the results of the two sets of stellar tracks for the real data andfor test populations with known sfh we have estimated the systematic errors tobe 15%, 1.0 gyr, and 0.2 dex. these do not include uncertainties in thebolometric corrections or variations in alpha-element abundance which deservefuture study.

astro-ph;9809275	hst wfpc2 color-magnitude diagrams of halo globular clusters in m33:  implications for the early formation history of the local group	we have constructed color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) for ten globular clustersin the halo of the nearby spiral galaxy m33 based on hubble space telescopewide-field planetary camera 2 observations in the f555w (~v) and f814w (~i)filters. these data reveal the morphology of the hb and allow us to estimatethe cluster metallicity using the shape and color of the red giant branch. theprincipal result we report herein is that 8 of the 10 clusters possessexclusively red hb morphologies yet their metallicities are as metal-poor as[fe/h] ~ -1.6. indeed, these 8 clusters present basically only giant branchclumps reminiscent of intermediate age star clusters in the magellanic clouds.in addition, two of the clusters form a second parameter pair which havesimilar metallicities but very disparate hb types. under the assumption thatcluster age is the global second parameter, the average age of halo globularclusters in m33 appears to be a few gyr younger than halo clusters in the milkyway. using the observed properties of hb stars in m31 and m33 along withpublished main-sequence turnoff ages for the globular clusters in the milkyway, lmc, smc, and the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (sgr), we attempt to sketchthe early formation history of these galaxies. this indicates that the milkyway, m31, m33, the lmc, and sgr all experienced their first epoch of clusterformation soon after the big bang. three to four gyr later, the smc began toform its first generation of clusters; the bulk of the m33 clusters formedlater still. we note that the halo clusters in m33 formed over a much longertime period than those in the milky way and m31.

astro-ph;9812157	the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale. xv. a cepheid  distance to the fornax cluster and its implications	using the hubble space telescope (hst) 37 long-period cepheid variables havebeen discovered in the fornax cluster spiral galaxy ngc 1365. the resulting vand i period-luminosity relations yield a true distance modulus of 31.35 +/-0.07 mag, which corresponds to a distance of 18.6 +/- 0.6 mpc. this measurementprovides several routes for estimating the hubble constant. (1) assuming thisdistance for the fornax cluster as a whole yields a local hubble constant of 70+/-18_{random} [+/-7]_{systematic} km/s/mpc. (2) nine cepheid-based distancesto groups of galaxies out to and including the fornax and virgo clusters yieldho = 73 (+/-16)_r [+/-7]_s km/s/mpc. (3) recalibrating the i-band tully-fisherrelation using ngc 1365 and six nearby spiral galaxies, and applying it to 15galaxy clusters out to 100 mpc gives ho = 76 (+/-3)_r [+/-8]_s km/s/mpc. (4)using a broad-based set of differential cluster distance moduli ranging fromfornax to abell 2147 gives ho = 72 (+/-)_r [+/-6]_s km/s/mpc. and finally, (5)assuming the ngc 1365 distance for the two additional type ia supernovae infornax and adding them to the snia calibration (correcting for light curveshape) gives ho = 67 (+/-6)_r [+/-7]_s km/s/mpc out to a distance in excess of500 mpc. all five of these ho determinations agree to within their statisticalerrors. the resulting estimate of the hubble constant combining all thesedeterminations is ho = 72 (+/-5)_r [+/-12]_s km/s/mpc.

0809.5283	star clusters in m31: i. a catalog and a study of the young clusters	we present an updated catalog of 1300 objects in the field of m31, including670 likely star clusters of various types. archival images were inspected toconfirm cluster classifications where possible, but most of the classificationswere based on spectra taken of ~1000 objects with the hectospec fiberpositioner and spectrograph on the 6.5m mmt. the spectra and images of youngclusters are analyzed in detail in this paper. ages, reddenings and masses of140 young clusters are derived by comparing the observed spectra and photometrywith model spectra. we find these to have masses as great as 10^5 with a medianof 10^4 m_sun, and a median age of 0.25 gyr. thus these clusters are similar inmass to the lmc young massive clusters, and are in between milky way openclusters and the globulars of m31 and the milky way. most of the m31 youngclusters have the low concentration typical of milky way open clusters, and weexpect that most of these will be disrupted in the next gyr, but a few havehigh concentrations and will likely survive longer. the spatial distribution ofthe young clusters is well correlated with the star-forming regions as mappedout by mid-ir emission. a kinematic analysis likewise confirms the spatialassociation of the young clusters with the young disk in m31.
