0904.2218	clarifying forecasts of dark energy constraints from baryon acoustic  oscillations	the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) from a galaxy redshiftsurvey provides one of the most promising methods for probing dark energy. inthis paper, we clarify the assumptions that go into the forecasts of darkenergy constraints from bao. we show that assuming a constant np_{0.2}/g^2(z)(where p_{0.2} is the real space galaxy power spectrum at k=0.2h/mpc andredshift z) gives a good approximation of the observed galaxy number densityexpected from a realistic flux-limited galaxy redshift survey. we find thatassuming np_{0.2}/g^2(z)=10 gives very similar dark energy constraints toassuming np_{0.2}=3, but the latter corresponds to a galaxy number densitylarger by ~70% at z=2. we show how the figure-of-merit (fom) for constrainingdark energy depends on the assumed galaxy number density, redshift accuracy,redshift range, survey area, and the systematic errors due to calibration anduncertainties in the theory of nonlinear evolution and galaxy biasing. we findthat an additive systematic noise of up to 0.4-0.5% per dz=0.1 redshift slicedoes not lead to significant decrease in the bao fom.

0910.2492	distance measurements from supernovae and dark energy constraints	constraints on dark energy from current observational data are sensitive tohow distances are measured from type ia supernova (sn ia) data. we find thatflux-averaging of sne ia can be used to test the presence of unknown systematicuncertainties, and yield more robust distance measurements from sne ia. we haveapplied this approach to the nearby + sdss +essence +snls +hst set of 288 sneia, and the ``constitution''of set 397 sne ia. combining the sn ia data withcmb data from wmap five year observations, the sloan digital sky survey baryonacoustic oscillation measurements, the data of 69 gammay-ray bursts, and thehubble constant measurement from the hst project shoes, we measure the darkenergy density function x(z)=\rho_x(z)/\rho_x(0) as a free function of redshift(assumed to be a constant at z&gt;1 or z&gt;1.5). without flux-averaging of sne ia,the combined data using the ``constitution'' set of sne ia seem to indicate adeviation from a cosmological constant at ~95% confidence level at 0&lt; z &lt;0.8;they are consistent with a cosmological constant at ~68% confidence level whensne ia are flux-averaged. the combined data using the nearby +sdss +essence+snls +hst data set of sne ia are consistent with a cosmological constant at68% confidence level with or without flux-averaging of sne ia, and give darkenergy constraints that are significantly more stringent than that using the``constitution'' set of sne ia. assuming a flat universe, dark energy isdetected at &gt;98% confidence level for z&lt;= 0.75 using the combined data with 288sne ia from nearby + sdss+ essence +snls +hst, independent of the assumptionsabout x(z&gt;1). we quantify dark energy constraints without assuming a flatuniverse using the dark energy figure-of-merit (fom) for both $x(z)$ and a darkenergy equation-of-state linear in the cosmic scale factor.

1006.0609	effects of cosmological model assumptions on galaxy redshift survey  measurements	the clustering of galaxies observed in future redshift surveys will provide awealth of cosmological information. matching the signal at different redshiftsconstrains the dark energy driving the acceleration of the expansion of theuniverse. in tandem with these geometrical constraints, redshift-spacedistortions (rsd) depend on the build up of large-scale structure. as pointedout by many authors measurements of these effects are intrinsically coupled. weinvestigate this link, and argue that it strongly depends on the cosmologicalassumptions adopted when analysing data. using representative assumptions forthe parameters of the euclid survey in order to provide a baseline futureexperiment, we show how the derived constraints change due to different modelassumptions. we argue that even the assumption of a friedman-robertson-walker(frw) space-time is sufficient to reduce the importance of the coupling to asignificant degree. taking this idea further, we consider how the data wouldactually be analysed and argue that we should not expect to be able tosimultaneously constrain multiple deviations from the standard $\lambda$cdmmodel. we therefore consider different possible ways in which the universecould deviate from the $\lambda$cdm model, and show how the coupling betweengeometrical constraints and structure growth affects the measurement of suchdeviations.

1006.3517	designing a space-based galaxy redshift survey to probe dark energy	a space-based galaxy redshift survey would have enormous power inconstraining dark energy and testing general relativity, provided that itsparameters are suitably optimized. we study viable space-based galaxy redshiftsurveys, exploring the dependence of the dark energy task force (detf)figure-of-merit (fom) on redshift accuracy, redshift range, survey area, targetselection, and forecast method. fitting formulae are provided for convenience.we also consider the dependence on the information used: the full galaxy powerspectrum p(k, p(k) marginalized over its shape, or just the baryon acousticoscillations (bao). we find that the inclusion of growth rate information(extracted using redshift space distortion and galaxy clustering amplitudemeasurements) leads to a factor of ~ 3 improvement in the fom, assuming generalrelativity is not modified. this inclusion partially compensates for the lossof information when only the bao are used to give geometrical constraints,rather than using the full p(k) as a standard ruler. we find that a space-basedgalaxy redshift survey covering ~20,000 deg^2 over 0.5&lt; z &lt; 2 with\sigma_z/(1+z)&lt;= 0.001 exploits a redshift range that is only easily accessiblefrom space, extends to sufficiently low redshifts to allow both a vast 3-d mapof the universe using a single tracer population, and overlaps withground-based surveys to enable robust modeling of systematic effects. we arguethat these parameters are close to their optimal values given currentinstrumental and practical constraints.

1008.4822	a robust distance measurement and dark energy constraints from the  spherically-averaged correlation function of sloan digital sky survey  luminous red galaxies	we measure the effective distance to z=0.35, d_v(0.35), from the overallshape of the spherically-averaged two-point correlation function of the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7) luminous red galaxy (lrg)sample. we find d_v(0.35)=1428_{-73}^{+74} without assuming a dark energy modelor a flat universe. we find that the derived measurement ofr_s(z_d)/d_v(0.35)=0.1143 \pm 0.0030 (the ratio of the sound horizon at thedrag epoch to the effective distance to z=0.35) is more tightly constrained andmore robust with respect to possible systematic effects. it is also nearlyuncorrelated with \omega_m h^2.  combining our results with the cosmic microwave background and supernovadata, we obtain \omega_k=-0.0032^{+0.0074}_{-0.0072} andw=-1.010^{+0.046}_{-0.045} (assuming a constant dark energy equation of state).by scaling the spherically-averaged correlation function, we find the hubbleparameter h(0.35)=83^{+13}_{-15} km s^{-1}mpc^{-1} and the angular diameterdistance d_a(0.35)=1089^{+93}_{-87} mpc.  we use lasdamas sdss mock catalogs to compute the covariance matrix of thecorrelation function, and investigate the use of lognormal catalogs as analternative. we find that the input correlation function can be accuratelyrecovered from lognormal catalogs, although they give larger errors on allscales (especially on small scales) compared to the mock catalogs derived fromcosmological n-body simulations.

1109.3172	a comparative study of dark energy constraints from current  observational data	we examine how dark energy constraints from current observational data dependon the analysis methods used: the analysis of type ia supernovae (sne ia), andthat of galaxy clustering data. we generalize the flux-averaging analysismethod of sne ia to allow correlated errors of sne ia, in order to reduce thesystematic bias due to weak lensing of sne ia. we find that flux-averagingleads to larger errors on dark energy and cosmological parameters if only sn iadata are used. when sn ia data (the latest compilation by the snls team) arecombined with wmap 7 year results (in terms of our gaussian fits to theprobability distributions of the cmb shift parameters), the latest hubbleconstant (h_0) measurement using the hubble space telescope (hst), and gammaray burst (grb) data, flux-averaging of sne ia increases the concordance withother data, and leads to significantly tighter constraints on the dark energydensity at z=1, and the cosmic curvature \omega_k. the galaxy clusteringmeasurements of h(z=0.35)r_s(z_d) and r_s(z_d)/d_a(z=0.35) (where h(z) is thehubble parameter, d_a(z) is the angular diameter distance, and r_s(z_d) is thesound horizon at the drag epoch) by chuang &amp; wang (2011) are consistent with snia data, given the same pirors (cmb+h_0+grb), and lead to significantlyimproved dark energy constraints when combined. current data are fullyconsistent with a cosmological constant and a flat universe.

0710.3885	differentiating dark energy and modified gravity with galaxy redshift  surveys	the observed cosmic acceleration today could be due to an unknown energycomponent (dark energy), or a modification to general relativity (modifiedgravity). if dark energy models and modified gravity models are required topredict the same cosmic expansion history h(z), they will predict differentgrowth rate for cosmic large scale structure, f_g(z)=d\ln \delta/d\ln a(\delta=(\rho_m-\bar{\rho_m})/\bar{\rho_m}), a is the cosmic scale factor). ifgravity is not modified, the measured h(z) leads to a unique prediction forf_g(z), f_g^h(z). comparing f_g^h(z) with the measured f_g(z) provides atransparent and straightforward test of gravity. we show that a simple \chi^2test provides a general figure-of-merit for our ability to distinguish betweendark energy and modified gravity given the measured h(z) and f_g(z). we study amagnitude-limited nir galaxy redshift survey covering &gt;10,000 (deg)^2 and theredshift range of 0.5&lt;z&lt;2. the resultant data can be divided into 7 redshiftbins, and yield the measurement of h(z) to the accuracy of 1-2% via baryonacoustic oscillation measurements, and f_g(z) to the accuracy of a few percentvia the measurement of redshift space distortions and the bias factor whichdescribes how light traces mass. we find that if the h(z) data are fit by botha dgp gravity model and an equivalent dark energy model that predict the sameexpansion history, a survey area of 11,931 (deg)^2 is required to rule out thedgp gravity model at the 99.99% confidence level. it is feasible for such agalaxy redshift survey to be carried out by the next generation space missionsfrom nasa and esa, and it will revolutionize our understanding of the universeby differentiating between dark energy and modified gravity.

0803.1616	planck priors for dark energy surveys	although cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy data alone cannotconstrain simultaneously the spatial curvature and the equation of state ofdark energy, cmb data provide a valuable addition to other experimentalresults. however computing a full cmb power spectrum with a boltzmann code isquite slow; for instance if we want to work with many dark energy and/ormodified gravity models, or would like to optimize experiments where manydifferent configurations need to be tested, it is possible to adopt a quickerand more efficient approach.  in this paper we consider the compression of the projected planck cmb datainto four parameters, r (scaled distance to last scattering surface), l_a(angular scale of sound horizon at last scattering), omega_b h^2 (baryondensity fraction) and n_s (powerlaw index of primordial matter power spectrum),all of which can be computed quickly. we show that, although this compressionloses information compared to the full likelihood, such information lossbecomes negligible when more data is added. we also demonstrate that the methodcan be used for scalar field dark energy independently of the parametrisationof the equation of state, and discuss how this method should be used for otherkinds of dark energy models.

0803.4295	figure of merit for dark energy constraints from current observational  data	choosing the appropriate figure of merit (fom) for dark energy (de)constraints is key in comparing different de experiments. here we show that fora set of de parameters {f_i}, it is most intuitive to define fom =1/\sqrt{cov(f1,f2,f3,...)}, where cov(f1,f2,f3,...) is the covariance matrix of{f_i}. the {f_i} should be minimally correlated. we demonstrate two usefulchoices of {f_i} using 182 sne ia (compiled by riess et al. 2007), [r(z_*),l_a(z_*), \omega_b h^2] from the five year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe(wmap) observations, and sdss measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation(bao) scale, assuming the hst prior of h_0=72+/-8 km/s mpc^{-1} and withoutassuming spatial flatness. we find that the correlation of (w_0,w_{0.5})[w_0=w_x(z=0), w_{0.5}=w_x(z=0.5), w_x(a) = 3w_{0.5}-2w_0+3(w_0-w_{0.5})a] issignificantly smaller than that of (w_0,w_a) [w_x(a)=w_0+(1-a)w_a]. in order toobtain model-independent constraints on de, we parametrize the de densityfunction x(z)=\rho_x(z)/\rho_x(0) as a free function with x_{0.5}, x_{1.0}, andx_{1.5} [values of x(z) at z=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5] as free parameters estimatedfrom data. if one assumes a linear de equation of state, current data areconsistent with a cosmological constant at 68% c.l. if one assumes x(z) to be afree function parametrized by (x_{0.5}, x_{1.0}, x_{1.5}), current data deviatefrom a cosmological constant at z=1 at 68% c.l., but are consistent with acosmological constant at 95% c.l.. future de experiments will allow us todramatically increase the fom of constraints on (w_0,w_{0.5}) and of (x_{0.5},x_{1.0}, x_{1.5}). this will significantly shrink the de parameter space toenable the discovery of de evolution, or the conclusive evidence for acosmological constant.

1501.06839	analytic photometric redshift estimator for type ia supernovae from the  large synoptic survey telescope	accurate and precise photometric redshifts (photo-z's) of type ia supernovae(sne ia) can enable the use of sne ia, measured only with photometry, to probecosmology. this dramatically increases the science return of supernova surveysplanned for the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst). in this paper wedescribe a significantly improved version of the simple analytic photo-zestimator proposed by wang (2007) and further developed by wang, narayan, andwood-vasey (2007). we apply it to 55,422 simulated sne ia generated using thesnana package with the lsst filters. we find that the estimated errors on thephoto-z's, \sigma_{z_{phot}}/(1+z_{phot}), can be used as filters to produce aset of photo-z's that have high precision, accuracy, and purity. using sn iacolors as well as sn ia peak magnitude in the i band, we obtain a set ofphoto-z's with 2 percent accuracy (with \sigma(z_{phot}-z_{spec})/(1+z_{spec})= 0.02), a bias in z_{phot} (the mean of z_{phot}-z_{spec}) of -9 x 10^{-5},and an outlier fraction (with |(z_{phot}-z_{spec})/(1+z_{spec})|&gt;0.1) of 0.23percent, with the requirement that \sigma_{z_{phot}}/(1+z_{phot})&lt;0.01. usingthe sn ia colors only, we obtain a set of photo-z's with similar quality byrequiring that \sigma_{z_{phot}}/(1+z_{phot})&lt;0.007; this leads to a set ofphoto-z's with 2 percent accuracy, a bias in z_{phot} of 5.9 x 10^{-4}, and anoutlier fraction of 0.32 percent.

astro-ph;0101040	measuring time-dependence of dark energy density from type ia supernova  data	observations of high redshift supernovae imply an accelerating universe whichcan only be explained by an unusual energy component such as vacuum energy orquintessence. to assess the ability of current and future supernova data toconstrain the properties of the dark energy, we allow its density to havearbitrary time-dependence, $\rho_x(z)$. this leads to an equation of state forthe dark energy, $w_x(z)=p_x(z)/\rho_x(z)$, which is a free function ofredshift $z$. we find that current type ia supernova (sne ia) data areconsistent with a cosmological constant, with large uncertainties at $z\ga0.5$. we show that $\rho_x(z)/\rho_x(z=0)$ can be measured reasonably well toabout $z=1.5$ using type ia supernova data from realistic future sn ia pencilbeam surveys, provided that the weak energy condition (energy density of matteris nonnegative for any observer) is imposed.  while it is only possible to differentiate between different models (say,quintessence and k-essence) at $z \la 1.5$ using realistic data, the correcttrend in the time-dependence of the dark energy density can be clearly detectedout to $z=2$, even in the presence of plausible systematic effects. this wouldallow us to determine whether the dark energy is a cosmological constant, orsome exotic form of energy with a time-dependent density.

astro-ph;0108260	prospects for constraining cosmology with the extragalactic cosmic  microwave background temperature	observers have demonstrated that it is now feasible to measure the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) temperature at high redshifts. we explore thepossible constraints on cosmology which might ultimately be derived from suchmeasurements. besides providing a consistency check on standard and alternativecosmologies, possibilities include: constraints on the inhomogeneity andanisotropy of the universe at intermediate redshift $z ^&lt;_\sim 10$; anindependent probe of peculiar motions with respect to the hubble flow; andconstraining the epoch of reionization. we argue that the best possibility isas a probe of peculiar motions. we show, however, that the current measurementuncertainty ($\delta t= \pm 0.002 $k) in the local present absolute cmbtemperature imposes intrinsic limits on the use of such cmb temperaturemeasurements as a cosmological probe. at best, anisotropies at intermediateredshift could only be constrained at a level of $^&gt;_\sim 0.1%$ and peculiarmotions could only be determined to an uncertainty of $^&gt;_\sim 311$ kms$^{-1}$. if the high $z$ cmb temperature can only be measured with a precisioncomparable to the uncertainty of the local interstellar cmb temperature, thenpeculiar motions could be determined to an uncertainty of $1101 (1+z)^{-1}[\delta t_{cmb}(z)/0.01 k] km s^{-1}$.

astro-ph;0109233	unbiased estimate of dark energy density from type ia supernova data	type ia supernovae (sne ia) are currently the best probes of the dark energyin the universe. to constrain the nature of dark energy in a model-independentmanner, we allow the density of dark energy, $\rho_x(z)$, to be an arbitraryfunction of redshift. using simulated data from a space-based supernova pencilbeam survey, we find that by optimizing the number of parameters used toparametrize the dimensionless dark energy density,$f(z)=\rho_x(z)/\rho_x(z=0)$, we can obtain an unbiased estimate of both f(z)and $\omega_m$ (assuming a flat universe and that the weak energy condition issatisfied). a plausible supernova pencil beam survey (with a square degreefield of view and for an observational duration of one year) can yield about2000 sne ia with $0\le z \le 2$. such a survey in space would yield sn peakluminosities with a combined intrinsic and observational dispersion of $\sigma(m_{int})=0.16$ mag. we find that for such an idealized survey, $\omega_m$ canbe measured to 10% accuracy, and f(z) can be estimated to $\sim$ 20% to $z \sim1.5$, and $\sim$ 20-40% to $z \sim 2$, depending on the time dependence of thetrue dark energy density. dark energy densities which vary more slowly can bemore accurately measured. for the anticipated snap mission, $\omega_m$ can bemeasured to 14% accuracy, and f(z) can be estimated to $\sim$ 20% to $z \sim1.2$. our results suggest that snap may gain much sensitivity to thetime-dependence of f(z) and $\omega_m$ by devoting more observational time tothe central pencil beam fields to obtain more sne ia at z&gt;1.2. we also findthat monte carlo analysis gives a more accurate estimate of the dark energydensity than the maximum likelihood analysis.

astro-ph;0204169	a universal probability distribution function for weak-lensing  amplification	we present an approximate form for the weak lensing magnificationdistribution of standard candles, valid for all cosmological models, witharbitrary matter distributions, over all redshifts. our results are based on auniversal probability distribution function (updf), $p(\eta)$, for the reducedconvergence, $\eta$. for a given cosmological model, the magnificationprobability distribution, $p(\mu)$, at redshift $z$ is related to the updf by$p(\mu)=p(\eta)/2|\kappa_{min}|$, where $\eta=1+(\mu-1)/(2|\kappa_{min}|)$, and$\kappa_{min}$ (the minimum convergence) can be directly computed from thecosmological parameters ($\omega_m$ and $\omega_\lambda$). we show that theupdf can be well approximated by a three-parameter stretched gaussiandistribution, where the values of the three parameters depend only on$\xi_\eta$, the variance of $\eta$. in short, all possible weak lensingprobability distributions can be well approximated by a one-parameter family.we establish this family, normalizing to the numerical ray-shooting results fora ${\lambda}$cdm model by wambsganss et al. (1997). each alternativecosmological model is then described by a single function $\xi_\eta(z)$. wefind that this method gives $p(\mu)$ in excellent agreement with numericalray-tracing and three-dimensional shear matrix calculations, and providenumerical fits for three representative models (scdm, $\lambda$cdm, and ocdm).our results provide an easy, accurate, and efficient method to calculate theweak lensing magnification distribution of standard candles, and should beuseful in the analysis of future high-redshift supernova data.

astro-ph;0206483	how sensitive are weak lensing statistics to dark energy content?	future weak lensing surveys will directly probe the clustering of darkmatter, in addition to providing a test for various cosmological models. recentstudies have provided us with the tools which can be used to construct thecomplete probability distribution function for convergence fields. it is alsopossible to construct the bias associated with the hot-spots in convergencemaps. these techniques can be used in both the quasi-linear and the highlynonlinear regimes using various well developed numerical methods. we use theseresults here to study the weak lensing statistics of cosmological models withdark energy. we study how well various classes of dark energy models can bedistinguished from models with a cosmological constant. we find that the ratioof the square root of the variance of convergence is complementary to theconvergence skewness $s_3$ in probing dark energy equation of state; it can beused to predict the expected difference in weak lensing statistics betweenvarious dark energy models, and for choosing optimized smoothing angles toconstrain a given class of dark energy models. our results should be useful forprobing dark energy using future weak lensing data with high statistics fromgalaxy weak lensing surveys and supernova pencil beam surveys.

astro-ph;0301562	direct wavelet expansion of the primordial power spectrum	in order to constrain and possibly detect unusual physics during inflation,we allow the power spectrum of primordial matter density fluctuations,p_{in}(k), to be an arbitrary function in the estimation of cosmologicalparameters from data. the multi-resolution and good localization properties oforthogonal wavelets make them suitable for detecting features in p_{in}(k). weexpand p_{in}(k) directly in wavelet basis functions. the likelihood of thedata is thus a function of the wavelet coefficients of p_{in}(k), as well asthe h_0, \omega_b h^2, $\omega_c h^2 and the \tau_{ri}, in a flat $\lambda$cdmcosmology. we derive constraints on these parameters from cmb anisotropy data(wmap, cbi, and acbar) and large scale structure (lss) data (2dfgrs and pscz)using the markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) technique. the direct waveletexpansion method is different and complimentary to the wavelet band powermethod of mukherjee &amp; wang (2003a,b), and results from the two methods areconsistent. in addition, as we demonstrate, the direct wavelet expansion methodhas the advantage that once the wavelet coefficients have been constrained, thereconstruction of p_{in}(k) can be effectively denoised, i.e., p_{in}(k) can bereconstructed using only the coefficients that, say, deviate from zero atgreater than 1\sigma. in doing so the essential properties of p_{in}(k) areretained. the reconstruction also suffers much less from the correlated errorsof binning methods. the shape of the primordial power spectrum, asreconstructed in detail here, reveals an interesting new feature at 0.001 \lak/{mpc}^{-1} \la 0.005. it will be interesting to see if this feature isconfirmed by future data. the reconstructed and denoised p_{in}(k) is favoredover the scale-invariant and power-law forms at \ga 1\sigma.

0809.0657	model-independent distance measurements from gamma-ray bursts and  constraints on dark energy	gamma-ray bursts (grb) are the most energetic events in the universe, andprovide a complementary probe of dark energy by allowing the measurement ofcosmic expansion history that extends to redshifts greater than 6. unlike typeia supernovae (sne ia), grbs must be calibrated for each cosmological modelconsidered, because of the lack of a nearby sample of grbs formodel-independent calibration. for a flat universe with a cosmologicalconstant, we find omega_m=0.25^{+0.12}_{-0.11} from 69 grbs alone. we show thatthe current grb data can be summarized by a set of model-independent distancemeasurements, with negligible loss of information. we constrain a dark energyequation of state linear in the cosmic scale factor using these distancemeasurements from grbs, together with the "union" compilation of sne ia, wmapfive year observations, and the sdss baryon acoustic oscillation scalemeasurement. we find that a cosmological constant is consistent with currentdata at 68% confidence level for a flat universe. our results provide a simpleand robust method to incorporate grb data in a joint analysis of cosmologicaldata to constrain dark energy.

astro-ph;0601163	dark energy constraints from baryon acoustic oscillations	baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) in the galaxy power spectrum allows us toextract the scale of the comoving sound horizon at recombination, acosmological standard ruler accurately determined by the cosmic microwavebackground anisotropy data. we examine various issues important in the use ofbao to probe dark energy. we find that assuming a flat universe, and priors onomega_m, omega_m h^2, and omega_b h^2 as expected from the planck mission, theconstraints on dark energy parameters (w_0,w') scale much less steeply withsurvey area than (area)^{-1/2} for a given redshift range. the constraints onthe dark energy density rho_x(z), however, do scale roughly with (area)^{-1/2}due to the strong correlation between h(z) and omega_m (which reduces theeffect of priors on omega_m). dark energy constraints from bao are verysensitive to the assumed linear scale of matter clustering and the redshiftaccuracy of the survey. for a bao survey with 0.5&lt;= z &lt;= 2, sigma(r)=0.4(corresponding to k_{max}(z=0)=0.086 h mpc^{-1}), and sigma_z/(1+z)=0.001,(sigma_{w_0},sigma_{w'})=(0.115, 0.183) and (0.069, 0.104) for survey areas of1000 (deg)^2 and 10000 (deg)^2 respectively. we find that it is critical tominimize the bias in the scale estimates in order to derive reliable darkenergy constraints. for a 1000 (10000) square degree bao survey, a 1-sigma biasin ln h(z) leads to a 2-sigma (3-sigma) bias in w'. the bias in w' due to thesame scale bias from ln d_a(z) is slightly smaller and opposite in sign. theresults from this paper will be useful in assessing different proposed baosurveys and guiding the design of optimal dark energy detection strategies.

astro-ph;0604051	robust dark energy constraints from supernovae, galaxy clustering, and  three-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe observations	type ia supernova (sn ia), galaxy clustering, and cosmic microwave backgroundanisotropy (cmb) data provide complementary constraints on the nature of thedark energy in the universe. we find that the three-year wilkinson microwaveanisotropy probe (wmap) observations give a cmb shift parameter of r =(\omega_m h_0^2)^{1/2} \int_0^{z_{cmb}} dz'/h(z')= 1.70 \pm 0.03. using thisnew measured value of the cmb shift parameter, together with the baryonacoustic oscillation (bao) measurement from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss), and sn ia data from the hst/goods program and the first year supernovalegacy survey, we derive model-independent constraints on the dark energydensity rho_x(z) and the cosmic expansion rate h(z). we also derive constraintson the dark energy equation of state w_x(z)=w_0+w'z (with cutoff at z=2) andw_x(a)=w_0+(1-a)w_a.  we find that current data provide slightly tighter constraints on rho_x(z)and h(z) as free functions in redshift, and roughly a factor of two improvementin constraining w_x(z). a cosmological constant remains consistent with data,however, uncertainties remain large for model-independent constraints of darkenergy. significant increase in the number of observed sne ia between redshiftsof 1 and 2, complemented by improved bao and weak lensing cosmographymeasurements (as expected from the jedi mission concept for the joint darkenergy mission), will be required to dramatically tighten model-independentdark energy constraints.

astro-ph;0609639	a model-independent photometric redshift estimator for type ia  supernovae	the use of type ia supernovae (sne ia) as cosmological standard candles isfundamental in modern observational cosmology. in this letter, we derive asimple empirical photometric redshift estimator for sne ia using a training setof sne ia with multiband ($griz$) light-curves and spectroscopic redshiftsobtained by the supernova legacy survey (snls). this estimator is analyticaland model-independent; it does not use spectral templates. we use all theavailable sne ia from snls with near maximum photometry in $griz$ (a total of40 sne ia) to train and test our photometric redshift estimator. the differencebetween the estimated redshifts $z_{phot}$ and the spectroscopic redshifts$z_{spec}$, $(z_{phot}-z_{spec})/(1+z_{spec})$, has rms dispersions of 0.031for 20 sne ia used in the training set, and 0.050 for 20 sne ia not used in thetraining set. the dispersion is of the same order of magnitude as the fluxuncertainties at peak brightness for the sne ia. there are no outlyers.  this photometric redshift estimator should significantly enhance the abilityof observers to accurately target high redshift sne ia for spectroscopy inongoing surveys. it will also dramatically boost the cosmological impact ofvery large future supernova surveys, such as those planned for advancedliquid-mirror probe for astrophysics, cosmology and asteroids (alpaca), and thelarge synoptic survey telescope (lsst).

astro-ph;0703780	observational constraints on dark energy and cosmic curvature	current observational bounds on dark energy depend on assumptions about thecurvature of the universe. we present a simple and efficient method forincorporating constraints from cmb anisotropy data, and use it to deriveconstraints on cosmic curvature and dark energy density as a free function ofcosmic time using current data. we show that there are two cmb shiftparameters, r=sqrt{\omega_m h_0^2} r(z_{cmb}) (scaled distance torecombination) and l_a=\pi r(z_{cmb})/r_s(z_{cmb})(angular scale of the soundhorizon at recombination), with measured values that are nearly uncorrelatedwith each other. allowing nonzero cosmic curvature, the three-year wmap datagive r =1.71 +/- 0.03, l_a =302.5 +/- 1.2, and \omega_b h^2 = 0.02173 +/-0.00082, independent of the dark energy model. the corresponding bounds for aflat universe are r =1.70 +/- 0.03, l_a =302.2 +/- 1.2, and \omega_b h^2 =0.022 +/- 0.00082. we give the covariance matrix of (r, l_a, \omega_b h^2) fromthe three-year wmap data. we find that (r, l_a, \omega_b h^2) provide anefficient and intuitive summary of cmb data as far as dark energy constraintsare concerned. using current cmb, sn ia, and bao data, we find that dark energydensity is consistent with a constant in cosmic time, with marginal deviationsfrom a cosmological constant that may reflect current systematic uncertaintiesor true evolution in dark energy. a flat universe is allowed by current data:\omega_k=-0.006_{-0.012}^{+0.013}_{-0.025}^{+0.025} for w_x(z)=const., and\omega_k=-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.018}_{-0.032}^{+0.041} for w_x(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a)(68%and 95% c.l.). the bounds on cosmic curvature are less stringent if dark energydensity is allowed to be a free function of cosmic time, and are also dependenton the assumption about the early time property of dark energy.

astro-ph;9501116	simple analytical methods for computing the gravity-wave contribution to  the cosmic background radiation anisotropy	we present two simple analytical methods for computing the gravity wavecontribution to the cosmic background radiation (cbr) anisotropy ininflationary models; one method uses a time-dependent transfer function, theother method uses an approximate gravity-wave mode function which is a simplecombination of the lowest order spherical bessel functions. we compare the cbranisotropy tensor multipole spectrum computed using our methods with theprevious result of the highly accurate numerical method, the ``boltzmann''method. our time-dependent transfer function is more accurate than thetime-independent transfer function found by turner, white, and lidsey; however,we find that the transfer function method is only good for $l \la 120$. usingour approximate gravity-wave mode function, we obtain much better accuracy; thetensor multipole spectrum we find differs by less than 2\% for $l \la 50$, lessthan 10\% for $l \la 120$, and less than 20\% for $l \leq 300$ from the``boltzmann'' result. our approximate graviton mode function should be quiteuseful in studying tensor perturbations from inflationary models.

astro-ph;9609022	the secondary infall model of galactic halo formation and the spectrum  of cold dark matter particles on earth	the spectrum of cold dark matter particles on earth is expected to have peaksin velocity space associated with particles which are falling onto the galaxyfor the first time and with particles which have fallen in and out of thegalaxy only a small number of times in the past. we obtain estimates for thevelocity magnitudes and the local densities of the particles in these peaks. tothis end we use the secondary infall model of galactic halo formation which wehave generalized to take account of the angular momentum of the dark matterparticles. the new model is still spherically symmetric and it admitsself-similar solutions. in the absence of angular momentum, the model producesflat rotation curves for a large range of values of a parameter $\epsilon$which is related to the spectrum of primordial density perturbations. we findthat the presence of angular momentum produces an effective core radius, i.e.it makes the contribution of the halo to the rotation curve go to zero at zeroradius. the model provides a detailed description of the large scale propertiesof galactic halos including their density profiles, their extent and totalmass. we obtain predictions for the kinetic energies of the particles in thevelocity peaks and estimates for their local densities as functions of theamount of angular momentum, the age of the universe and $\epsilon$.

astro-ph;9708014	implications of cosmic microwave background anisotropies for large scale  variations in hubble's constant	low amplitude (linear regime) cosmic density fluctuations lead to spatialvariations in the locally measurable value of $h_0$ (denoted as $h_l$),$\delta_h \equiv (h_l-h_0)/h_0$, which are of order 3-6% (95% confidenceinterval) in a sphere of 200$ h^{-1}$mpc in diameter, and of order 1-2% in asphere of 400$ h^{-1}$mpc in diameter, for three currently viable structureformation models (tilted cdm, $\lambda$cdm, and open cdm) as normalized by the4 year cobe dmr data. however, the true matter distribution power spectrum maydiffer from any of the currently viable models. for example, it may containsharp features which have escaped detection so far. the measured cmb dipolevelocity (the galaxy's peculiar velocity with respect to the cmb rest frame)provides additional constraints on the probability distribution of $\delta_h$that supplement our limited knowledge of the power spectrum. for a matter powerspectrum which consists of the smooth power spectrum of a viable cosmologicalmodel plus a delta-function bump, we find that given the cmb dipole velocity,the 95% cl upper limit of $|\delta_h|$ increases approximately by a factor oftwo, but the probability distribution of $\delta_h$ is non-gaussian, withincreased probability at small $\delta_h$ compared to gaussian. abandoningmodel power spectra entirely, we find that the observed cmb dipole velocityalone provides a very robust limit, $\sqrt{&lt; \delta_h^2 &gt;_r} &lt;10.5h^{-1}{mpc}/r$ at 95% cl, in a sphere of radius $r$, for an arbitrary powerspectrum. thus, variations between currently available local measures of $h_0$and its true global value of a few to several percent are to be expected anddifferences as large as 10% are possible based on our current knowledge of thecmb anisotropies.

astro-ph;9802231	cosmology in the next millennium: combining map and sdss data to  constrain inflationary models	the basic cosmological parameters and the primordial power spectrum togethercompletely specify predictions for the cosmic microwave background radiationanisotropy and large scale structure. here we show how we can stronglyconstrain both $a_s^2(k)$ and the cosmological parameters by combining the datafrom the microwave anisotropy probe (map) and the galaxy redshift survey fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we allow $a_s^2(k)$ to be a free function,and thus probe features in the primordial power spectrum on all scales. theprimordial power spectrum in 20 steps in $\log k$ to $k\leq 0.5h$mpc$^{-1}$ canbe determined to $\sim 16%$ accuracy for $k\sim 0.01h$mpc$^{-1}$, and to $\sim1%$ accuracy for $k\sim 0.1h$mpc$^{-1}$. the uncertainty in the primordialpower spectrum increases by a factor up to 3 on small scales if we solvesimultaneously for the dimensionless hubble constant $h$, the cosmologicalconstant ${\lambda}$, the baryon fraction $\omega_b$, the reionization opticaldepth $\tau_{ri}$, and the effective bias between the matter density field andthe redshift space galaxy density field $b_{\it eff}$. alternately, if werestrict $a_s^2(k)$ to be a power law, we find that inclusion of the sdss databreaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the power spectrum and theoptical depth inherent in the map data, significantly reduces the uncertaintiesin the determination of the matter density and the cosmological constant, andallows a determination of the galaxy bias parameter. thus, combining the mapand sdss data allows the independent measurement of important cosmologicalparameters, and a measurement of the primordial power spectrum independent ofinflationary models, giving us valuable information on physics in the earlyuniverse, and providing clues to the correct inflationary model.

astro-ph;9901212	analytical modeling of the weak lensing of standard candles i. empirical  fitting of numerical simulation results	weak lensing leads to the non-gaussian magnification distribution of standardcandles at given redshift $z$, $p(\mu|z)$. in this paper, we give accurate andsimple empirical fitting formulae of the weak lensing numerical simulationresults with the generalized dyer-roeder prescription. the smoothness parameter$\tilde{\alpha}$ essentially represents the amount of matter that can causemagnification of a given source. since matter distribution in our universe isinhomogeneous, we can think of our universe as a mosaic of cones centered onthe observer, each with a different value of $\tilde{\alpha}$. we define the{\it direction dependent} smoothness parameter $\tilde{\alpha}$ via thedyer-roeder equation; there is a unique mapping between $\tilde{\alpha}$ andthe magnification of a source. we find that the distribution of$\tilde{\alpha}$ at given $z$, $p(\tilde{\alpha}|z)$, is well described by amodified gaussian distribution. for the same matter distribution, i.e., thesame $p(\tilde{\alpha}|z)$, different values of $\omega_m$ and$\omega_{\lambda}$ can lead to very different magnification distributions.  our formulae can be conveniently used to calculate the weak lensing effectsfor observed type ia supernovae at arbitrary redshifts.
