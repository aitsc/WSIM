0903.0838	highly structured wind in vela x-1	we present an in-depth analysis of the spectral and temporal behavior of along almost uninterrupted integral observation of vela x-1 in nov/dec 2003. inaddition to an already high activity level, vela x-1 exhibited several veryintense flares with a maximum intensity of more than 5 crab in the 20-40 kevband. furthermore vela x-1 exhibited several off states where the source becameundetectable with isgri. we interpret flares and off states as being due to thestrongly structured wind of the optical companion: when vela x-1 encounters acavity in the wind with strongly reduced density, the flux drops, thuspotentially triggering the onset of the propeller effect which inhibits furtheraccretion, thus giving rise to the off states. the required drop in density totrigger the propeller effect in vela x-1 is of the same order as predicted bytheoretical papers for the densities in the ob star winds. the same structuredwind can give rise to the giant flares when vela x-1 encounters a dense blob inthe wind. further temporal analysis reveals that a short lived qpo with aperiod of ~6800 sec is present. the part of the light curve during which theqpo is present is very close to the off states and just following a highintensity state, thus showing that all these phenomena are related.

0907.3844	is there a highly magnetized neutron star in gx 301-2?	we present the results of an in-depth study of the long-period x-ray pulsargx 301-2. using archival data of integral, rxte asm, and cgro batse, we studythe spectral and timing properties of the source. comparison of our timingresults with previously published work reveals a secular decay of the orbitalperiod at a rate of \simeq -3.25 \times 10^{-5} d yr^{-1}, which is an order ofmagnitude faster than for other known systems. we argue that this is probablyresult either of the apsidal motion or of gravitational coupling of the matterlost by the optical companion with the neutron star, although currentobservations do not allow us to distinguish between those possibilities. wealso propose a model to explain the observed long pulse period. we find that avery strong magnetic field b \sim 10^{14} g can explain the observed pulseperiod in the framework of existing models for torques affecting the neutronstar. we show that the apparent contradiction with the magnetic field strengthb_{crsf} \sim 4 \times 10^{12} g derived from the observed cyclotron lineposition may be resolved if the line formation region resides in a tallaccretion column of height \sim 2.5 - 3 r_{ns}. the color temperature measuredfrom the spectrum suggests that such a column may indeed be present, and ourestimates show that its height is sufficient to explain the observed cyclotronline position.

1005.0842	extreme flux states of ngc 4151 observed with integral	we present a comprehensive spectral analysis of all integral data obtained sofar for the x-ray--bright seyfert galaxy ngc 4151. we also use allcontemporaneous data from rxte, xmm, swift and suzaku. we find a linearcorrelation between the medium and hard-energy x-ray fluxes measured byintegral, which indicates an almost constant spectral index over six years. themajority of integral observations were made when the source was either at avery bright or very dim hard--x-ray state. we find that thermal comptonizationmodels applied to the bright state yields the plasma temperature of 50--70 kevand its optical depth of 1.3--2.6, depending on the assumed source geometry.for the dim state, these parameters are in the ranges of 180--230 kev and0.3--0.7, respectively. the compton parameter is y = 1 for all the spectra,indicating a stable geometry. using this result, we can determine thereflection effective solid angles associated with the close and distantreprocessing media as = 0.3 x 2pi and 0.2 x 2pi, respectively. the plasmaenergy balance, the weak disc reflection and a comparison of the uv fluxesilluminating the plasma to the observed ones are all consistent with an innerhot accretion surrounded by an outer cold disc. the disc truncation radius canbe determined from an approximate equipartition between the observed uv andx-ray emission, and from the fitted disc blackbody model, as 15 gravitationalradii. alternatively, our results can be explained by a mildly relativisticcoronal outflow.

1110.5199	the complex behaviour of the microquasar grs 1915+105 in the rho class  observed with bepposax. ii: time-resolved spectral analysis	bepposax observed grs 1915+105 on october 2000 with a long pointing lastingabout ten days. during this observation, the source was mainly in the rho classcharacterized by bursts with a recurrence time of between 40 and 100 s. weidentify five segments in the burst structure and accumulate the averagespectra of these segments during each satellite orbit. we present a detailedspectral analysis aimed at determining variations that occur during the burstand understanding the physical process that produces them. we compare mecs,hpgspc, and pds spectra with several models. under the assumption that a singlemodel is able to fit all spectra, we find that the combination of amulti-temperature black-body disk and a hybrid corona is able to give aconsistent physical explanation of the source behaviour. our measuredvariations in kt_el, tau, kt_in, and r_in appear to be either correlated oranti-correlated with the count rate in the energy range 1.6-10 kev. thestrongest variations are detected along the burst segments: almost allparameters exhibit significant variations in the segments that have the highestfluxes (pulse) with the exception of r_in, which varies continuously andreaches a maximum just before the peak. the flux of the multi-temperature diskstrongly increases in the pulse and simultaneously the corona contribution issignificantly reduced. the disk luminosity increases in the pulse and ther_in-t_in correlation can be most successfully interpreted in term of the slimdisk model. in addition, the reduction in the corona luminosity at the burstsmight represent the condensation of the corona onto the disk.

1111.1976	the discovery of the 401 hz accreting millisecond pulsar igr j17498-2921  in a 3.8 hr orbit	we report on the detection of a 400.99018734(1) hz coherent signal in therossi x-ray timing explorer light curves of the recently discovered x-raytransient, igr j17498-2921. by analysing the frequency modulation caused by theorbital motion observed between august 13 and september 8, 2011, we derive anorbital solution for the binary system with a period of 3.8432275(3) hr. themeasured mass function, f(m_2, m_1, i)=0.00203807(8) msun, allows to set alower limit of 0.17 msun on the mass of the companion star, while an upperlimit of 0.48 msun is set by imposing that the companion star does not overfillits roche lobe. we observe a marginally significant evolution of the signalfrequency at an average rate of -(6.3 +/- 1.9)e-14 hz/s. the low statisticalsignificance of this measurement and the possible presence of timing noisehampers a firm detection of any evolution of the neutron star spin. we alsopresent an analysis of the spectral properties of igr j17498-2921 based on theobservations performed by the swift-x-ray telescope and the rxte-proportionalcounter array between august 12 and september 22, 2011. during most of theoutburst, the spectra are modeled by a power-law with an index gamma~1.7-2,while values of ~3 are observed as the source fades into quiescence.

1203.4096	the pulse profile and spin evolution of the accreting pulsar in terzan  5, igr j17480-2446, during its 2010 outburst	(abridged) we analyse the spectral and pulse properties of the 11 hztransient accreting pulsar, igr j17480-2446, in the globular cluster terzan 5,considering all the available rxte, swift and integral observations performedbetween october and november, 2010.  by measuring the pulse phase evolution we conclude that the ns spun up at anaverage rate of &lt;nu_dot&gt;=1.48(2)e-12 hz/s, compatible with the accretion of thekeplerian angular momentum of matter at the inner disc boundary. similar toother accreting pulsars, the stability of the pulse phases determined by usingthe second harmonic component is higher than that of the phases based on thefundamental frequency. under the assumption that the second harmonic is a goodtracer of the neutron star spin frequency, we successfully model its evolutionin terms of a luminosity dependent accretion torque. if the ns accretes thespecific keplerian angular momentum of the in-flowing matter, we estimate theinner disc radius to lie between 47 and 93 km when the luminosity attains itspeak value. smaller values are obtained if the interaction between the magneticfield lines and the plasma in the disc is considered.  the phase-averaged spectrum is described by thermal comptonization of photonswith energy of ~1 kev. a hard to soft state transition is observed during theoutburst rise. the comptonized spectrum evolves from a comptonizing cloud at anelectron temperature of ~20 kev towards an optically denser cloud at kt_e~3kev. at the same time, the pulse amplitude decreases from 27% to few per centand becomes strongly energy dependent. we discuss various possibilities toexplain such a behaviour, proposing that at large accretion luminosities asignificant fraction of the in-falling matter is not channelled towards themagnetic poles, but rather accretes more evenly onto the ns surface.

1205.5316	spectral formation in accreting x-ray pulsars: bimodal variation of the  cyclotron energy with luminosity	accretion-powered x-ray pulsars exhibit significant variability of thecyclotron resonance scattering feature (crsf) centroid energy on pulse-to-pulsetimescales, and also on much longer timescales. two types of spectralvariability are observed. for sources in group 1, the crsf energy is negativelycorrelated with the variable source luminosity, and for sources in group 2, theopposite behavior is observed. the physical basis for this bimodal behavior iscurrently not understood. we explore the hypothesis that the accretion dynamicsin the group 1 sources is dominated by radiation pressure near the stellarsurface, and that coulomb interactions decelerate the gas to rest in the group2 sources. we derive a new expression for the critical luminosity such thatradiation pressure decelerates the matter to rest in the supercritical sources.the formula for the critical luminosity is evaluated for 5 sources, using themaximum value of the crsf centroid energy to estimate the surface magneticfield strength. the results confirm that the group 1 sources are supercriticaland the group 2 sources are subcritical, although the situation is less clearfor those highly variable sources that cross over the critical line. we alsoexplain the variation of the crsf energy with luminosity as a consequence ofthe variation of the characteristic emission height. the sign of the heightvariation is opposite in the supercritical and subcritical cases, hencecreating the observed bimodal behavior.

1205.5475	outburst of gx 304-1 monitored with integral: positive correlation  between the cyclotron line energy and flux	x-ray spectra of many accreting pulsars exhibit significant variations as afunction of flux and thus of mass accretion rate. in some of these pulsars, thecentroid energy of the cyclotron line(s), which characterizes the magneticfield strength at the site of the x-ray emission, has been found to varysystematically with flux. gx 304-1 is a recently established cyclotron linesource with a line energy around 50 kev. since 2009, the pulsar shows regularoutbursts with the peak flux exceeding one crab. we analyze the integralobservations of the source during its outburst in january-february 2012. theobservations covered almost the entire outburst, allowing us to measure thesource's broad-band x-ray spectrum at different flux levels. we report on thevariations in the spectral parameters with luminosity and focus on thevariations in the cyclotron line. the centroid energy of the line is found tobe positively correlated with the luminosity. we interpret this result as amanifestation of the local sub-eddington (sub-critical) accretion regimeoperating in the source.

1302.6493	analysis of the new integral earth observations to measure the cosmic  x-ray background	a new series of earth occultation observations has been started in 2012 torefine the determination of the cosmic x-ray background by the integralmission. we show here that the new detector lightcurves in the 3 to 160 kevrange differ from the ones obtained in 2006. instead of the expected modulationinduced by the passage of the earth through the field of view of the jem-x,ibis/isgri and spi instruments, we record unrelated variability on shortertimescales. we discuss the differences obtained with the datasets of 2006 and2012 in view of the changes in pointing direction, spacecraft orbit and solarcycle phase. we conclude that the earth occultation signal in 2012 is likelyblended by radioactive decay resulting from the activation of the spacecraftwhen crossing the proton radiation belt at perigee passage. the observedvariability, on the other hand, results most likely from the current solarmaximum. in addition to a variable particle environment from inhomogeneities ofthe solar wind, we also find evidence for hard x-ray auroral emission. whilethe former can be traced by spi/acs counts, the latter - by enhancingunpredictably the earth emission - is a major disturbance for measuring thediffuse x-ray background through occultation by the earth.

1305.3884	swings between rotation and accretion power in a millisecond binary  pulsar	it is thought that neutron stars in low-mass binary systems can accretematter and angular momentum from the companion star and be spun-up tomillisecond rotational periods. during the accretion stage, the system iscalled a low-mass x-ray binary, and bright x-ray emission is observed. when therate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, thesebinaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by theneutron star's rotating magnetic field. this evolutionary model is supported bythe detection of millisecond x-ray pulsations from several accreting neutronstars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsar. it has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar maytemporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. here wereport observations of accretion-powered, millisecond x-ray pulsations from aneutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. within a fewdays after a month-long x-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. thisnot only shows the evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsars, but also that some systems can swing between the twostates on very short timescales.

1502.04717	giant outburst from the supergiant fast x-ray transient igr j17544-2619:  accretion from a transient disc?	supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) are high mass x-ray binariesassociated with ob supergiant companions and characterised by an x-ray flaringbehaviour whose dynamical range reaches 5 orders of magnitude on timescales ofa few hundred to thousands of seconds. current investigations concentrate onfinding possible mechanisms to inhibit accretion in sfxts and explain theirunusually low average x-ray luminosity. we present the swift observations of anexceptionally bright outburst displayed by the sfxt igr j17544-2619 on 2014october 10 when the source achieved a peak luminosity of $3\times10^{38}$ ergs$^{-1}$. this extends the total source dynamic range to $\gtrsim$10$^6$, thelargest (by a factor of 10) recorded so far from an sfxt. tentative evidencefor pulsations at a period of 11.6 s is also reported. we show that theseobservations challenge, for the first time, the maximum theoretical luminosityachievable by an sfxt and propose that this giant outburst was due to theformation of a transient accretion disc around the compact object.

1503.05090	a possible cyclotron resonance scattering feature near 0.7 kev in  x1822-371	we analyse all available x-ray observations of x1822-371 made withxmm-newton, chandra, suzaku and integral satellites. the observations were notsimultaneous. the suzaku and integral broad band energy coverage allows us toconstrain the spectral shape of the continuum emission well. we use the modelalready proposed for this source, consisting of a comptonised componentabsorbed by interstellar matter and partially absorbed by local neutral matter,and we added a gaussian feature in absorption at $\sim 0.7$ kev. this additionsignificantly improves the fit and flattens the residuals between 0.6 and 0.8kev. we interpret the gaussian feature in absorption as a cyclotron resonantscattering feature (crsf) produced close to the neutron star surface and derivethe magnetic field strength at the surface of the neutron star, $(8.8 \pm 0.3)\times 10^{10}$ g for a radius of 10 km. we derive the pulse period in theepic-pn data to be 0.5928850(6) s and estimate that the spin period derivativeof x1822-371 is $(-2.55 \pm 0.03) \times 10^{-12}$ s/s using all availablepulse period measurements. assuming that the intrinsic luminosity ofx1822-371is at the eddington limit and using the values of spin period and spinperiod derivative of the source, we constrain the neutron star and companionstar masses. we find the neutron star and the companion star masses to be $1.69\pm 0.13$ m$_{\odot}$ and $0.46 \pm 0.02$ m$_{\odot}$, respectively, for aneutron star radius of 10 km.in a self-consistent scenario in which x1822-371is spinning-up and accretes at the eddington limit, we estimate that themagnetic field of the neutron star is $(8.8 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{10}$ g for aneutron star radius of 10 km. if our interpretation is correct, the gaussianabsorption feature near 0.7 kev is the very first detection of a crsf below 1kev in a lmxb.

1505.00548	properties and observability of glitches and anti-glitches in accreting  pulsars	several glitches have been observed in young, isolated radio pulsars, while aclear detection in accretion-powered x-ray pulsars is still lacking. we use thepizzochero snowplow model for pulsar glitches as well as starquake models todetermine for the first time the expected properties of glitches in accretingpulsars and their observability. since some accreting pulsars showaccretion-induced long-term spin-up, we also investigate the possibility thatanti-glitches occur in these stars. we find that glitches caused by quakes in aslow accreting neutron star are very rare and their detection extremelyunlikely. on the contrary, glitches and anti-glitches caused by a transfer ofangular momentum between the superfluid neutron vortices and the non-superfluidcomponent may take place in accreting pulsars more often. we calculate themaximum jump in angular velocity of an anti-glitch and we find that it isexpected to be about 1e-5 - 1e-4 rad/s. we also note that since accretingpulsars usually have rotational angular velocities lower than those of isolatedglitching pulsars, both glitches and anti-glitches are expected to have longrise and recovery timescales compared to isolated glitching pulsars, withglitches and anti-glitches appearing as a simple step in angular velocity.among accreting pulsars, we find that gx 1+4 is the best candidate for thedetection of glitches with currently operating x-ray instruments and futuremissions such as the proposed large observatory for x-ray timing (loft).

1505.04034	missing hard states and regular outbursts: the puzzling case of the  black hole candidate 4u 1630-472	4u 1630-472 is a recurrent x-ray transient classified as a black-holecandidate from its spectral and timing properties. one of the peculiarities ofthis source is the presence of regular outbursts with a recurrence periodbetween 600 and 730 d that has been observed since the discovery of the sourcein 1969. we report on a comparative study on the spectral and timing behaviourof three consecutive outbursts occurred in 2006, 2008 and 2010. we analysed allthe data collected by the international gamma-ray astrophysics laboratory(integral) and the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) during these three yearsof activity. we show that, in spite of having a similar spectral and timingbehaviour in the energy range between 3 and 30 kev, these three outbursts showpronounced differences above 30 kev. in fact, the 2010 outburst extends at highenergies without any detectable cut-off until 150-200 kev, while the twoprevious outbursts that occurred in 2006 and 2008 are not detected at all above30 kev. thus, in spite of a very similar accretion disk evolution, these threeoutbursts exhibit totally different characteristics of the compton electroncorona, showing a softening in their evolution rarely observed before in a lowmass x-ray binary hosting a black hole. we argue the possibility that theunknown perturbation that causes the outbursts to be equally spaced in timecould be at the origin of this particular behaviour. finally we describeseveral possible scenarios that could explain the regularity of the outbursts,identifying the most plausible, such as a third body orbiting around the binarysystem.

1505.06135	swift j1734.5-3027: a new long type-i x-ray bursting source	swift j1734.5-3027 is a hard x-ray transient discovered by swift whileundergoing an outburst in september 2013. archival observations showed thatthis source underwent a previous episode of enhanced x-ray activity in may-june2013. in this paper we report on the analysis of all x-ray data collectedduring the outburst in september 2013, the first that could be intensivelyfollowed-up by several x-ray facilities. our data-set includes integral, swift,and xmm-newton observations. from the timing and spectral analysis of theseobservations, we show that a long type-i x-ray burst took place during thesource outburst, making swift j1734.5-3027 a new member of the class ofbursting neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries. the burst lasted for about 1.9ks and reached a peak flux of (6.0$\pm$1.8)$\times$10$^{-8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ in the 0.5-100 kev energy range. the estimated burst fluence in thesame energy range is (1.10$\pm$0.10)$\times$10$^{-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$. byassuming that a photospheric radius expansion took place during the first$\sim$200 s of the burst and that the accreted material was predominantlycomposed by he, we derived a distance to the source of 7.2$\pm$1.5 kpc.

0805.1811	integral observations of the variability of oao 1657-415	the galactic plane scan (gps) was one of the core observation programmes ofthe integral satellite. the highly variable accreting pulsar oao 1657-415 wasfrequently observed within the gps. we investigate the spectral and timingproperties of oao 1657-415 and their variability on short and long time scalesin the energy range 6-160 kev. during the time covered by the integralobservations, the pulse period evolution shows an initial spin-down, which isfollowed by an equally strong spin-up. in combining our results with historicalpulse period measurements (correcting them for orbital variation) and withstretches of continuous observations by batse, we find that the long-termperiod evolution is characterised by a long-term spin-up overlayed by sets ofrelative spin-down/spin-up episodes, which appear to repeat quasi-periodicallyon a 4.8 yr time scale. we measure an updated local ephemeris and confirm thepreviously determined orbital period with an improved accuracy. the spectraclearly change with pulse phase. the spectrum measured during the main peak ofthe pulse profile is particularly hard. we do not find any evidence of acyclotron line, wether in the phase-averaged spectrum or in phase-resolvedspectra.

1511.01944	a closer view of the igr j11014-6103 outflows	the complex x-ray system igr j11014-6103 (a.k.a. the lighthouse nebula) iscomposed of a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula (pwn) as well as large-scalejet-like features, all launched by igr j11014-6103 which is movingsupersonically in the interstellar medium. previous observations suggested thatthe jet features stem from a ballistic jet of relativistic particles. in orderto confirm the nature of the jet and the marginally detected counter-jet, weobtained a new deep 250 ks chandra observation of the lighthouse nebula. weperformed detailed spatial and spectral analysis of all x-ray components of thesystem. the x-ray pwn is now better resolved and shows a clear bi-modalmorphology. the overall helical pattern of the main jet is confirmed. however,there are large deviations from a simple helical model at small and largescales. significant extended emission is now detected, encompassing the mainjet all along its length. the brightness dip of the main jet at ~50" distancefrom the pulsar is confirmed, the extended emission however preventsconclusions about the coherence at this position of the jet. the counter-jet isnow detected at high statistical significance. in addition, we found twosmall-scale "arcs" departing from the pulsar towards the jets. we also lookedfor possible bow-shock emission in front of the pulsar, with a short vlt/fors2h-alpha observation. no clear emission is found, most likely because ofcontamination from a diffuse surrounding nebulosity. the results of our x-rayanalysis show that current expectations from a ballistic nature of the jets canexplain satisfactorily some of the observational evidences but cannot fullyreproduce the observations. the alternative scenario (diffusion of particlesalong preexisting magnetic field lines in the surrounding medium) however alsocontinues to suffer from conflicts with the observations.

astro-ph;0011242	the variable xmm-newton spectrum of markarian 766	the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy markarian 766 was observed for 60 ks withthe xmm-newton observatory. the source shows a complex x-ray spectrum. the 2-10kev spectrum can be adequately represented by a power law and broad fe kaemission. between 0.7 and 2 kev the spectrum is harder and exhibits a fluxdeficit with respect to the extrapolated medium energy slope. below 0.7 kev,however, there is a strong excess of emission. the rgs spectrum shows anedge-like feature at 0.7 kev; the energy of this feature is inconsistent withthat expected for an ovii edge from a warm absorber. markarian 766 varies by afactor of ~ 2 in overall count rate in the epic and rgs instruments on atimescale of a few thousand seconds, while no significant flux changes areobserved in the ultraviolet with the om. the x-ray variability is spectrallydependent with the largest amplitude variability occurring in the 0.4-2 kevband. the spectral variability can be explained by a change in flux and slopeof the medium energy continuum emission, superimposed on a less variable (orconstant) low energy emission component.

astro-ph;0109515	in.xs: project for a future spaceborne hard x-ray all-sky survey	the latest all-sky survey in hard x-ray band was performed by the heao-1satellite (13-80 kev) with an angular resolution of 24x48 arcmin. a diffusehard x-ray background (hxb) was detected between 3 and 50 kev. the mainscientific goal of in.xs is to resolve a large fraction of this hxb intoindividual sources.  as no distortion by compton up-scattering is seen in the spectrum of themicrowave background, the hard x-ray background is believed to be mainly due topoint sources. type i active galactic nuclei (agn) have softer x-ray spectrathan the hard x-ray background, so other sources must be considered, like fainttype ii or absorbed agn. these could be distinguished through hard x-rayspectroscopic or hardness ratio observations.  here we present in.xs - a mission concept designed to conduct the firstimaging all-sky hard x-ray (2-80 kev) survey. the angular resolution of nearly1 arcmin and good sensitivity at high energies is provided by the latestmultilayer focussing mirrors, with semiconductor-based (gaas) arrays ofdetectors. we also describe the mission operations, and how the all-sky surveywill be complemented by follow-up pointed observations of selected fields. thegood angular resolution will allow correlations and identification with objectsseen at other wavelengths. in addition, since a large fraction of the type iiagn luminosity is emitted in the hard x-ray band, this survey will provide alarge unbiased sample of the agn population. this may provide constraints onagn evolution through the possible observation of a turnover in deep fieldsource statistics.

astro-ph;0206249	high resolution soft x-ray spectroscopy of m87 with the reflection  grating spectrometers on xmm-newton	we present high-resolution x-ray spectroscopic observations of m87 with thereflection grating spectrometers on xmm-newton. we detect strong k-shell lineemission from n, o, ne, mg, some emission from he-like si, a fully resolved setof fe l-shell emission spectra, and some emission from c. the angular intensitydistributions of the strong emission lines are detectably resolved on scales(15-160) arcsec. the gas in the inner arcmin of m87 has a multi-phasestructure, as indicated by the similarity of the emission line profiles of fe lshell ions with widely separated ionization potentials. the global fe lspectrum is approximately consistent with an isothermal plasma at kt_e ~ 1.8kev, in addition to a component with a temperature distribution appropriate toan isobaric cooling flow, but with a minimum temperature cutoff of kt_min ~ 600ev. the behaviour of this cooling-flow component is qualitatively similar towhat is seen in other cooling flow clusters. finally, we do not find any strongevidence for a spatial variation in abundances due to resonance scatteringredistribution in the inner arcminute of the core.

astro-ph;0210662	high resolution x-ray spectroscopic constraints on cooling-flow models  for clusters of galaxies	we present high resolution x-ray spectra of 14 putative cooling-flow clustersof galaxies obtained with the reflection grating spectrometer on xmm-newton.the clusters in the sample span a large range of temperatures and massdeposition rates. various of these spectra exhibit line emission from o viii,ne x, mg xii &amp; xi, al xiii &amp; xii, si xiv &amp; xiii, n vii, and c vi as well as allfe l ions. the spectra exhibit strong emission from cool plasma at just belowthe ambient temperature, $t_0$, down to $t_0/2$, but also exhibit a severedeficit of emission, relative to the predictions of the isobaric cooling-flowmodel at lower temperatures ($&lt;$ $t_0/3$). in addition, the best-resolvedspectra show emission throughout the entire x-ray temperature range, butincreasingly less emission at lower temperatures than the cooling-flow modelwould predict. these results are difficult to reconcile with simpleprescriptions for distorting the emission measure distribution, e.g. byincluding additional heating or rapid cooling terms. we enumerate sometheoretical difficulties in understanding the soft x-ray spectra ofcooling-flows independent of the classic problem of the failure to detect thecooling-flow sink. empirically, the differential luminosity distribution isconsistent with being proportional to the temperature to the power of $\approx$1 to 2, instead of being independent of the temperature, as expected in thestandard multi-phase model. the primary differences in the observed lowtemperature spectra are ascribed to differences in the ambient temperature.

astro-ph;0210665	high resolution x-ray spectroscopic constraints on cooling flow models  of clusters of galaxies and gaseous haloes around elliptical galaxies	in many clusters of galaxies, the cooling time at the core of theintracluster medium is much less than the age of the system, suggesting thatthe the gas should continually lose energy by radiation. simple thermodynamicarguments then require that the expected "cooling flow" should exhibit aspecific spectroscopic signature, characterized by a differential emissionmeasure distribution that is inversely proportional to the cooling function ofthe plasma. that prediction can be quantitatively tested for the first time bythe reflection grating spectrometer (rgs) experiment on xmm-newton, whichprovides high resolution x-ray spectra, even for moderately extended sourceslike clusters. we present rgs data on 14 separate cooling flow clusters,sampling a very wide range in mass deposition rate. surprisingly, in all caseswe find a systematic deficit of low temperature emission relative to thepredictions of the cooling flow models. however, we do see evidence for coolingflow gas at temperatures just below the cluster background temperature, $t_0$,roughly down to $t_0/2$. these results are difficult to reconcile with most ofthe possible explanations for the cooling flow problem that have been proposedto date. we also present rgs data on the massive elliptical galaxy ngc 4636. inthis case, we detect evidence for resonance emission line scattering of highoscillator strength fe l-shell emission lines within the gaseous halo of thegalaxy. the detection of that effect leads to very tight constraints onphysical conditions within the halo. however, here again, the expectedsignature of a cooling flow is not detected, perhaps suggesting somefundamental uncertainty in our understanding of radiative cooling in lowdensity cosmic plasmas.

astro-ph;0309763	spatially resolved x-ray spectroscopy of cooling clusters of galaxies	we present spatially resolved x-ray spectra taken with the epic cameras ofxmm-newton of a sample of 17 cooling clusters and three non-cooling clustersfor comparison. the deprojected spectra are analyzed with a multi-temperaturemodel, independent of any a priori assumptions about the physics behind thecooling and heating mechanisms. all cooling clusters show a central decrementof the average temperature, most of them of a factor of ~2. at each radiuswithin the cooling region the gas is non-isothermal. the differential emissionmeasure distribution peaks near the maximum (ambient) temperature, and steeplydeclines towards lower temperatures, proportional to t^3, or alternatively acut-off at about a quarter to half of the maximum temperature. in general, wefind a poor correlation between radio flux of the central galaxy and thetemperature decrement of the cooling flow. this is interpreted as evidence thatexcept for a few cases heating by a central agn is not the most common cause ofweak cooling flows. we investigate the role of heat conduction by electrons andfind that the theoretically predicted conductivity rates are not high enough tobalance radiation losses. the differential emission measure distribution hasremarkable similarities with the predictions from coronal magnetic loop models.also the physical processes involved (radiative cooling, thermal conductionalong the loops, gravity) are similar for clusters loops and coronal loops. ifcoronal loop models apply to clusters, we find that a few hundred loops perscale height should be present. the typical loop sizes deduced from theobserved emission measure distribution are consistent with the characteristicmagnetic field sizes deduced from faraday rotation measurements.

astro-ph;0404352	high energy gamma ray counterparts of astrophysical sources of  ultra-high energy cosmic rays	if ultra-high energy cosmic rays (uhecrs) are accelerated at astrophysicalpoint sources, the identification of such sources can be achieved if there issome kind of radiation at observable wavelengths that may be associated withthe acceleration and/or propagation processes. no radiation of this type has sofar been detected or at least no such connection has been claimed. the processof photopion production during the propagation of uhecrs from the sources tothe earth results in the generation of charged and neutral pions. the neutral(charged) pions in turn decay to gamma quanta and electrons that initiate anelectromagnetic cascade in the universal photon background. we calculate theflux of this gamma radiation in the gev-tev energy range and find that forsource luminosities compatible with those expected from small scaleanisotropies in the directions of arrival of uhecrs, the fluxes can bedetectable by future cerenkov gamma ray telescopes, such as veritas and hess,provided the intergalactic magnetic field is not larger than $\sim 10^{-10}$gauss and for source distances comparable with the loss length for photopionproduction.

0809.4190	giant outburst of exo 2030+375: pulse-phase resolved analysis of  integral data	in june-september 2006 the be/x-ray binary exo 2030+375 experienced thesecond giant outburst since its discovery. the source was shown to have acomplicated pulse-averaged x-ray spectral continuum with possible evidence ofcyclotron absorption features. in this paper we present the first pulse-phaseresolved analysis of the broad band x-ray spectra of exo 2030+375 obtained withthe integral observatory close to the maximum and during the decay phase of thegiant outburst. we report a strong variability of the spectrum with pulsephase. alternative spectral continuum models are discussed. the dependence ofthe spectral parameters on pulse phase during the maximum of the outburst andthe evolution of the pulse profiles with time are qualitatively consistent withthe pulsar's emission diagram changing from the fan-beam geometry close to themaximum of the outburst to a combination of pencil and fan beams (of comparableintesities) at the end of the decay phase. evidence of a cyclotron absorptionline around 63 kev at the pulse phase interval preceeding the main peak of thepulse profile is present in the spectrum obtained close to the maximum of theoutburst.
