9944220370	Development of high strength self leveling concrete for Hong Kong	In Hong Kong, high strength concrete has been in use for several years and the highest strength concrete used in actual construction has already reached Grade 100. Nowadays, the production of high strength concrete no longer presents much difficulties. However, there is the common problem that the high strength concretes are generally more difficult to compact. It is, therefore, desirable to have high strength concretes which have not only high strength but also high workability. In the present study, several high strength concrete mixes, which are so workable that they are in effect self leveling, are developed. Only locally available materials are used in the trial mixing and thus the mixes are specifically developed for use in Hong Kong. Nevertheless, the mixes may also be used as starting points for development of high strength self leveling concrete in other places.

9944223240	Grade 80-100 self-consolidating concrete for Hong Kong	Compared to normal concrete mixes, high-strength concrete mixes are more cohesive and sticky, and would in general require a larger slump for proper consolidation. On the other hand, apart from high strength, high workability is also desired because it would allow faster and quieter concreting operation and reduce the risk of incomplete consolidation. However, it is not easy to achieve both high strength, which demands a low water/binder ratio, and high workability, which demands a high water content, without increasing the binder paste volume, which may lead to thermal and shrinkage cracking problems. In this study, the feasibility of producing high-strength, self-consolidating concrete with a binder paste volume of not more than 35% in Hong Kong was investigated by trial concrete mixing. A new polycarboxylate-based superplasticiser was used. In total, 18 trial mixes have been cast. All of them have slump higher than 200 mm and 28-day cube strength ranging from 80 to 117 M Pa. Some of them are suitable for making grade 80-100, self-consolidating concrete in Hong Kong.

14544277116	Effects of strain hardening of steel reinforcement on flexural strength and ductility of concrete beams	In the design of reinforced concrete beams, it is a standard practice to use the yield stress of the steel reinforcement for the evaluation of the flexural strength. However, because of strain hardening, the tensile strength of the steel reinforcement is often substantially higher than the yield stress. Thus, it is a common belief that the actual flexural strength should be higher than the theoretical flexural strength evaluated with strain hardening ignored. The possible increase in flexural strength due to strain hardening is a two-edge sword. In some cases, it may be treated as strength reserve contributing to extra safety. In other cases, it could lead to greater shear demand causing brittle shear failure of the beam or unexpected greater capacity of the beam causing violation of the strong column-weak beam design philosophy. Strain hardening may also have certain effect on the flexural ductility. In this paper, the effects of strain hardening on the post-peak flexural behaviour, particularly the flexural strength and ductility, of reinforced normal- and high-strength concrete beams are studied. The results reveal that the effects of strain hardening could be quite significant when the tension steel ratio is relatively small.

18744415197	Effects of confinement on flexural strength and ductility design of HS concrete beams	High-strength concrete is relatively brittle and its use in a reinforced concrete member might result in unacceptably low flexural ductility. One way of improving ductility is to provide confinement. However, in the case of beam design the effects of confinement are generally not considered due mainly to the lack of a suitable design method. In order to develop a design method for improving the flexural ductility of high-strength concrete members through the provision of confinement, the effects of confinement on the flexural behaviour of reinforced concrete beams have been evaluated in this study by complete moment-curvature analysis of beam sections with and without confinement provided. It was found that the provision of confinement significantly increases the ultimate concrete strain, balanced steel ratio and flexural ductility. Furthermore, design formulae for the flexural strength and ductility design of high-strength concrete beams with the effects of confinement taken into account have been developed.

0000736106	Particle size distribution analysis of coarse aggregate using digital image processing	An attempt at applying the digital image processing (DIP) technique to analyze the particle size distribution of coarse aggregate is made. Three different types of aggregates have been analyzed, and thei r gradi ng curves are compared to those obtained by conventional mechanical sieving. Because DIP produces only area gradation and uses a particle size definition different from the square sieve size used in mechanical sieving, direct comparison is not possible unless the gradation basis and particle size definitions of the two methods are aligned. For this purpose, a simple method of converting the area gradation to mass gradation is proposed. Moreover, a size correction factor is used to convert the particle sizes measured by DIP to equivalent square sieve sizes so that comparison between the DIP and mechanical sieving results can be made. The study demonstrates that DIP is a fast, convenient, versatile, and accurate technique for particle size distribution analysis. It is, however, not without limitations, which will be discussed. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0003118433	Tensile strength and elastic modulus of typical concrete made in Hong Kong	The mechanical properties of concrete have been measured experimentally in many places and their correlation given in some technical standards. However, the mechanical properties of concrete are dependent on many factors, including the characteristics of the raw materials used, the curing conditions and the local concrete practice, which may vary from place to place. Hence, the mechanical properties measured in other places may not be directly applicable to Hong Kong. In this study, the cube compressive strength, split cylinder tensile strength, static modulus and dynamic modulus of typical concrete produced in Hong Kong using the local materials under the local conditions were measured and best-fit equations correlating the various mechanical properties derived. The measured results were also compared to theoretical predictions by various correlation equations developed elsewhere to evaluate their applicability to Hong Kong. Concretes with cube compressive strength ranging from 1 to 60 MPa were covered in the study.

0030242639	Shear lag in shear/core walls	Shear lag occurs not only in bridge decks and framed tubes, but also in shear/core walls. However, there have been relatively few studies on shear lag in wall structures. Moreover, most existing theories neglect shear lag in the webs and, although they are acceptable for bridge decks that normally have flanges wider than webs, they may not be applicable to shear/core walls whose webs can be much wider than flanges. To study the shear lag phenomenon in wall structures, a parametric study using finite-element analysis is carried out. Unlike previous studies that neglected shear lag in the webs, many layers of elements are used for both the webs and flanges so that shear lag in the webs can also be taken into account. The results indicate that the shape of the longitudinal stress distribution in an individual web or flange panel is quite independent of the dimensions of the other panels. Based on this observation, design charts and empirical formulas for estimating the shear lag effects are developed for practical applications.

0032097575	Stochastic response analysis of visco-elastic slit shear walls	Slit shear walls are reinforced concrete shear wall structures with purposely built-in vertical slits. If the slits are inserted with visco-elastic damping materials, the shear walls will become visco-elastic sandwich beams. When adequately designed, this kind of structures can be quite effective in resisting earthquake loads. Herein, a simple analysis method is developed for the evaluation of the stochastic responses of visco-elastic slit shear walls. In the proposed method, the stiffness and mass matrices are derived by using Rayleigh-Ritz method, and the responses of the structures are calculated by means of complex modal analysis. Apart from slit shear walls, this analysis method is also applicable to coupled shear walls and cantilevered sandwich beams. Numerical examples are presented and the results clearly show that the seismic responses of shear wall structures can be substantially reduced by incorporating vertical slits into the walls and inserting visco-elastic damping materials into the slits.

0032216074	Elasto-plastic analysis of reinforced concrete slit shear walls	This paper deals with the elasto-plastic behaviour of reinforced concrete slit shear walls, a new type of earthquake-resistant wall structure. The softened truss model was used to analyze the inelastic behaviour of the connecting beams, which are the key vibration-control devices of the structure. Based on the non-linear load-deflection curves of the connecting beams obtained using the softened truss model, the elasto-plastic behaviour of the slit shear wall structure as a whole was evaluated using a non-linear finite-element method. A parametric study was then carded out to investigate the effects of different connecting-beam designs on the performance of slit shear walls. The results reveal that the depth and reinforcement of the connecting beams directly affect the failure mode and ductility of the slit shear wall structure. It is concluded that, with appropriate design, the conversion of a solid shear wall into a slit shear wall can substantially increase the ductility of the wall structure, but there will be a slight reduction in lateral strength.

2442632093	Shear capacity of high-strength concrete beams with their point of inflection within the shear span	The shear strength of concrete does not increase in proportion with the concrete grade. Thus, when high-strength concrete is used in place of normal-strength concrete, the shear capacity of the structure could become critical. In the study presented, the effect of concrete strength on the shear capacity of concrete beams was investigated. As previous research on normal-strength concrete beams has shown that the presence of an inflection point within the shear span can significantly influence the shear capacity, particular effort was made to study this influence in the case of high-strength concrete beams. The results indicate that, as the concrete strength increases, the shear capacity of the beam also increases, but the shear capacity is proportional to the cube-root rather than the square-root of the concrete compressive strength. It is also revealed that the presence of an inflection point can increase the shear capacity by as much as 100%, regardless of whether normal-strength or high-strength concrete is used. Finally, the test results were analysed by comparing them with the predicted strength values calculated using the formulae given in the various codes and Aoyagi's equation.

24744445435	Effects of curing conditions on strength development of high strength concrete	This paper presents the results of a series of studies on the influence of curing conditions on the strength development of high strength concrete. The 1-, 3-, 7-, 14- and 28-day strengths of four different mixes of Grade 75-80 concrete, with or without pulverized fuel ash and / or condensed silica fume, under five different curing regimes were investigated. It is revealed that the curing conditions have significant influence on both the short term and long term strength development of the concrete and that concrete mixes of the same grade but containing different mineral admixtures show distinct favour for a curing regime. These results will be helpful for evaluating suitable curing methods for high strength concrete with different mix proportions.

3142552693	Theoretical study on effect of confinement on flexural ductility of normal and high-strength concrete beams	Compared with normal concrete, high-strength concrete has higher strength but is generally more brittle. Its use in a reinforced concrete structure, if not properly controlled, could lead to an unsustainable reduction in ductility. However, confinement could be provided to improve the ductility of the structure. In this study, the effects of concrete strength and confinement on the flexural ductility of reinforced concrete beams have been evaluated by means of complete moment-curvature analysis of beam sections cast in different concretes and provided with different confinements. The results reveal that the use of high-strength concrete at a constant tension steel ratio would increase the flexural ductility, but at a constant tension to balanced steel ratio would decrease the flexural ductility. In contrast, the provision of confinement would always increase the flexural ductility. It does this in two ways: first, it increases the balanced steel ratio so that, at the same tension steel ratio, the tension to balanced steel ratio is decreased; and second, it increases the residual strength and ductility of the concrete so that, at the same tension to balanced steel ratio, the flexural ductility of the beam section is increased.

32644431545	Effects of shock vibration on concrete	The effects of shock vibration on concrete were studied using a newly developed test method that applies hammer blows to prismatic specimens in the longitudinal direction and evaluates the shortand long-term effects by observing crack formation, measuring the immediate change in ultrasonic pulse velocity, and measuring the reductions in 28-day tensile and compressive strengths. A total of 198 prisms cast of typical concrete mixtures with 28-day cube strength ranging from 40 to 60 MPa had been tested at ages of 12 hours to 28 days. The tests revealed that the major effect of shock vibration is the formation of transverse cracks. Based on the test results, the shock vibration resistances of the concrete mixtures at different ages were determined and correlated to their material properties. It was found that the single most important material parameter governing the shock vibration resistance of concrete is the dynamic tensile strain capacity. Finally, several new sets of vibration control limits, which are less conservative than most existing ones, have been established. Copyright © 2005, American Concrete Institute. All rights reserved.

33746062423	Reducing damage to concrete stitches in bridge decks	In bridge widening projects, it is a common practice to provide a monolithic connection between the existing and new decks by casting an in situ concrete stitching slab. Due to the difficulties associated with complete closure of the bridge, traffic flow has to be maintained on the existing deck. As a result, the existing deck will deflect under traffic load and the concrete stitching slab will be subjected to differential deflection, which is cyclic in nature. Such cyclic differential deflection hinders strength development of the concrete and may affect the structural integrity of the stitching slab. Some possible methods of reducing the differential deflection so as to mitigate damage to the curing concrete stitches have been proposed, but no systematic comparative studies have been carried out. These methods include traffic restriction, provision of temporary shear connections, provision of temporary propping and segmental concrete stitching. This paper evaluates the relative effectiveness of these mitigation measures as well as their different combinations by conducting grillage analysis of the widening bridge deck at various stages of construction. Based on the results, it is advocated that among these, the combination of temporary shear connection and segmental concrete stitching should be the most practicable and effective.

33745831237	Strain energy release rate for interfacial cracks in hybrid beams	The finite element modeling and fracture mechanics concept were used to study the interfacial fracture of a FRP-concrete hybrid structure. The strain energy release rate of the interfacial crack was calculated by the virtual crack extension method. It is shown that the crack growth has three phases, namely, cracking initiation, stable crack growth and unstable crack propagation. The effects of geometric and physical parameters of the hybrid beam on the energy release rate were considered. These parameters include Young's moduli of the FRP, the concrete and the adhesive, thickness of the FRP plate and adhesive, and the distance of FRP plate end from the beam end. The numerical results show that the energy release rate of the interfacial crack is influenced considerably by these parameters. The present investigation can contribute to the mechanism understanding and engineering design of the hybrid structures. © 2005.

33748323139	Passing ability and segregation stability of self-consolidating concrete with different aggregate proportions	An extensive experimental programme has been carried out to study the effects of fine:10 mm:20 mm aggregate proportions on the passing ability and segregation stability of self-consolidating concrete, A total of 18 trial concrete mixes with water/cementitious materials ratios ranging from 0-30 to 0-36 and different combinations of fine and coarse aggregates were produced. In each mix, the paste volume was set at 35%, and pulverised fuel ash, condensed silica fume and a third-generation superplasticiser were added at dosages of 25%, 5% and 3% respectively. All the mixes were tested to have slump flow well above 700 mm. However, not all have satisfactory passing ability and segregation stability, as revealed by J-ring, U-box and sieve segregation tests. The cohesiveness and coarse aggregate content appeared to be the major factors as the passing ability and segregation stability were generally better for mixes with higher cohesiveness and lower coarse aggregate content. Nevertheless, some of the mixes may be considered for making high-strength, self-consolidating concrete. They have the common characteristics of 20mm aggregate content ≤ 10 mm aggregate content and coarse aggregate content ≤ fine aggregate content. © 2006 Thomas Telford Ltd.

33750324061	Practical determination of prestress tendon profile by load-balancing method	The determination of prestress tendon profile is a crucial step in the design of prestressed concrete structures. Like other design procedures, it is perceived to be a trial-and-error process. As an uncommon alternative to the conventional method of working out secondary moments and revising the tendon profile when the line of pressure falls out of the limiting zone, the load-balancing method offers great potential for direct determination of tendon profile. Though decades have passed since its proposition, there are still no comprehensive guidelines as to how the load-balancing method should be implemented. Issues regarding how much load should be balanced and how the method should be applied to two-dimensional structures etc have not been systemicalfy addressed. In this paper, the load-balancing method is revisited. Various considerations in the implementation of the method are discussed and two examples are presented to illustrate the step-by-step procedures. It is shown that the method is actually quite easy to implement, even in complicated structures like curved continuous bridges. Finally, it is advocated that the method is a much more efficient alternative to the conventional method and should be incorporated in the standard design process.

33845201803	Improving flexural ductility of high-strength concrete beams	With the advent of advanced mineral and chemical admixtures, the strength level of concrete has been raised dramatically and high-strength concrete (HSC) is becoming more and more commonly used. However, HSC is generally more brittle than normal strength concrete. In fact, it has been shown that the use of HSC, if not properly controlled, could significantly reduce the flexural ductility of reinforced concrete beams. Herein, it is proposed to compensate for the reduction in flexural ductility owing to the use of HSC by adding compression and confining reinforcements. A parametric study based on complete moment-curvature analysis of beam sections made of different grades of concrete and provided with different amounts of tension, compression and confining reinforcements has been carried out to evaluate the increases in flexural ductility achievable by adding compression and confining reinforcements. From the numerical results, the compression and/or confining reinforcements needed to maintain a consistent level of minimum flexural ductility at all concrete strength levels have been determined and correlated to the concrete strength for direct evaluation in the design of HSC beams.

34347338823	Complete nonlinear response of reinforced concrete beams under cyclic loading	Complete nonlinear analysis is carried out for cyclically loaded reinforced concrete (RC) beams made of normal-and high-strength concrete. The loading stage covers not only the pre-peak stage but also the post-peak stage in particular. The analysis is based on a numerical method that employs the actual stress-strain curves and takes into account the stress-path dependence of concrete and steel reinforcement. The complete nonlinear behavior of RC beams under both non-reversed and reversed cyclic loading is studied based on the moment-curvature relationship obtained. Generally, the response under cyclic loading is found to be dependent on the loading path in bending. The variation of neutral axis depth is different for under- and over-reinforced sections during cyclic loading. The Bauschinger effect of steel reinforcement is insignificant for non-reversed cyclic loading but notable for reversed cyclic loading, especially when the loading extends into the post-peak stage. The beneficial effects of concrete tension stiffening are only observed at the service stage and are more significant for under-reinforced RC beams than over-reinforced ones.

36549036150	Ductility analysis of prestressed concrete beams with unbonded tendons	This paper describes a numerical method for the full-range analysis of prestressed concrete flexural members with unbonded tendons, taking into account the stress-path dependence of materials. The numerical results compare favourably with experimental results. Parametric studies are carried out to evaluate the influence of loading type, span-depth ratio, combined reinforcement index (CRI), partial prestressing ratio, concrete compressive strength, and ratio of compressive reinforcement, etc. on the ductility behaviour. The results indicate that the curvature ductility factor of prestressed concrete members with unbonded tendons decreases with the increase of CRI. The curvature ductility factors for members with bonded and unbonded tendons for given values of CRI are also analyzed and compared. It is generally observed that when the CRI is between 0.15 and 0.20, the ductility factor of an unbonded member is close to that of the bonded one. Above this range of CRI the ductility factor of an unbonded member is higher than that of a bonded one, while below this range the ductility factor of an unbonded member is lower than that of a bonded one. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

35448969200	Effects of traffic vibration on curing concrete stitch: Part II-cracking, debonding and strength reduction	In bridge widening projects, the possible damaging effects of traffic vibration on curing concrete stitch have been causing concern, and design engineers have to consider what traffic restrictions or mitigation measures are necessary. However, different researchers, using different test methods, have obtained widely different results for the threshold vibration causing damage. To resolve this problem, a new vibration test method that can more closely simulate the actual loading conditions of the curing concrete stitch has been developed as presented in Part I [Kwan AKH, Ng PL. Effects of traffic vibration on curing concrete stitch: Part I-test method and control program. Engineering Structures 2007; 29(11):2871-80]. Herein, the results of an experimental program, in which a total of 24 specimens have been tested using the new method, are presented. In the experimental program, the specimens were subjected to different amplitudes of vibration and the damages so caused to each specimen were assessed in terms of cracking, reduction in bond strength, reduction in contraflexural strength and slackness at the construction joints. The results revealed that whilst the threshold curvature causing cracking or slackness is relatively small, the threshold curvature causing significant reduction in bond or contraflexural strength is relatively large, and in fact larger than expected. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

35448975077	Effects of traffic vibration on curing concrete stitch: Part I - test method and control program	When a bridge is widened by constructing a new deck and casting a concrete stitch between the existing deck and the new deck, it is often required to maintain traffic without interruption and as a result the curing concrete stitch would be subjected to traffic induced vibration. A number of experimental investigations had been carried out in the past to study the effects of traffic vibration on curing concrete stitches but widely different results were obtained by different researchers due to the different test methods and equipment used. In fact, in the previous investigations, two important loading conditions have not been properly simulated: (1) the concrete stitch should be subjected to contraflexural loading; and (2) the loading transmitted to the concrete stitch should change as the stiffness of the concrete stitch increases with time. Herein, a new test method that the authors have recently developed for application to several bridge widening projects is presented. In this test method, the above loading conditions are simulated and the applied deflection/loading is real time computer controlled by an impedance dependent control program. The test results so obtained are presented and studied in the accompanying paper (i.e. Part II). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

35548982228	Adding steel fibres to improve shock vibration resistance of concrete	A newly developed shock vibration test method was employed to study the effects of shock vibration on steel-fibrereinforced concrete so as to explore the possibility of improving the shock vibration resistance of concrete. In total, 21 batches of concrete with steel fibre contents ranging from 0 to 4% were cast and subjected to the shock vibration test at ages of 12 h, 1 day and 7 days. The results revealed that the effectiveness of adding steel fibres to alleviate the short-term damage caused by shock vibration (in terms of immediate reduction in ultrasonic pulse velocity) was quite low, especially for shock vibration applied at an early age. However, the effectiveness of adding steel fibres to mitigate the long-term damage caused by shock vibration (in terms of reduction in 28-day direct tensile strength) turned out to be much higher for shock vibration applied at age within 1 day than at later age. One probable reason is that, even after vibration damage had been caused, the continuing development of the steel-concrete bond while the concrete was still young could restore part of the reduced tensile strength. Finally, a new set of shock vibration control limits for steel fibre reinforced concrete was established.

0033101583	Mesoscopic study of concrete I: Generation of random aggregate structure and finite element mesh	Concrete is a composite material with a variety of inhomogeneities. Its composite behavior may be studied analytically using the mesoscopic approach which treats the concrete as a three-phase system consisting of coarse aggregate, mortar matrix with fine aggregate dissolved in it, and interfacial zones between the coarse aggregate and the mortar matrix. For such mesoscopic study, it is first necessary to generate a random aggregate structure in which the shape, size and distribution of the aggregate particles resemble real concrete in the statistical sense. Then, if the composite structure is to be analyzed by the finite element method, a mesh for each of the three phases needs to be generated. In this paper, a procedure for generating random aggregate structures for rounded and angular aggregates based on the Monte Carlo random sampling principle is proposed and a method of mesh generation using the advancing front approach is developed. These are combined with a nonlinear finite element method for mesoscopic study of concrete whose methodology and results will be presented in part II of the paper.

0033101982	Mesoscopic study of concrete II: Nonlinear finite element analysis	At mesoscopic scale, concrete may be regarded as a three-phase composite consisting of coarse aggregate, mortar matrix and interfacial zones. Its composite behavior can be studied by generating a random aggregate structure which resembles the mesoscopic structure of concrete and analyzing the interaction between the three phases using the finite element method. A method of generating random aggregate structures taking into account the size, shape and spatial distributions of aggregate particles has been developed and presented in part I of the paper. Herein, a nonlinear finite element method suitable for mesoscopic study of concrete is developed. Goodman type interface elements are used to model the interfacial zones. Cracking and nonlinear constitutive properties of the materials are taken into account. A failure criterion combining tensile strength and fracture toughness is adopted. Stress relief as cracks propagate is also allowed for. An adaptive incremental displacement controlled iterative scheme which can deal with post-peak behavior is employed. The method is applied to study the strain localization of concrete under uniaxial tension in a numerical example.

0033189502	Particle shape analysis of coarse aggregate using digital image processing	The particle shape characteristics of the coarse aggregate used can significantly affect the workability, strength, and durability of the concrete produced. However, traditionally, particle shape measurements have to be done in a manual way that is both cumbersome and time-consuming. Herein, digital image processing (DIP) techniques are used to analyze the particle shape characteristics of coarse aggregate. The main particle shape characteristics measured are flakiness and elongation. Twenty-five aggregate samples of different rock type and size have been analyzed and the results are compared to results obtained by the traditional manual method. Strong correlation between the DIP and manual measurement results is achieved and thus the DIP method, which is much faster, may be a better alternative for particle shape measurement. In fact, the DIP method yields more information about the particle shape than the manual method. With the DIP method used, it is possible to measure the mean thickness/breadth and length/breadth ratios of the aggregate directly, rather than just the proportion of flaky or elongated particles according to arbitrary definitions.

0034004722	Non-planar beam-wall joints in tall building structures	Stress concentration and local deformation occur at both coplanar and non-planar beam-wall joints. However, over the years, only coplanar joints have been studied in detail. Very few studies on non-planar joints have been carried out and most designers still treat non-planar joints as hinges and neglect the possible coupling effect of beams connected to such joints. There is also no established method for detailed design of non-planar joints. Herein, a parametric study of the behaviour of non-planar beam-wall joints using finite-element analysis is described. On the basis of numerical results, a simple equivalent-frame model is developed. Examples are given to illustrate its applications and the results show that the coupling effect of beams connected to non-planar joints can be very substantial. Moreover, in order to avoid cracking at the joints, it is proposed that in the detailed design (a) the concentrated out-of-plane moment acting from the beam on the wall should be catered for by designing a vertical strip of the wall, having a width as determined in the present study, as a column to resist such a moment; and (b) the bending moment induced in the beam should be properly allowed for and the longitudinal reinforcement so provided adequately anchored into the wall.

0033722668	Sphericity, shape factor, and convexity measurement of coarse aggregate for concrete using digital image processing	A method of measuring the sphericity, shape factor, and convexity of coarse aggregate for concrete using digital image processing (DIP) is developed. Unlike other DIP methods, this method is capable of estimating the thickness and volume of the particles, and can thus be used to measure shape parameters dependent on thickness and to evaluate weighted mean values of the shape parameters of the individual particles in an aggregate sample. A total of 46 rock aggregate samples obtained from five different sources derived from three different types of rock have been analyzed by the method and the shape parameters so measured are correlated to the traditional measure of angularity with the hope of identifying shape parameters that may be used as direct measures of angularity. Several shape parameters are found to have good correlation with the traditional measure of angularity but among them, only the convexity ratio and fullness ratio may be used as measures of angularity. Lastly, it is advocated that the traditional measure of angularity in terms of packing density should be abandoned; packing density by itself is an important indicator of aggregate performance but is not a good measure of angularity.

0033907168	Effective stiffness of coupling beams connected to walls in out-of-plane directions	Based on recent studies on local deformations at coplanar and nonplanar beam-wall joints, the structural behavior of oblique beam-wall joints (joints at which the beams are at oblique angles to the walls) is analyzed and a joint element developed to model their behavior. Both in-plane and out-of-plane wall deformations at the beam-wall joints are taken into account. For general application to analysis of coupled shear/core walls, the stiffness matrix of oblique coupling beams (beams connected to walls at oblique angles) with local deformations at the joints allowed for, is derived. Using this stiffness matrix, the effective stiffness of coupling beams connected to walls in any direction is evaluated, and its dependence on the angles of connection studied. It is also shown through numerical examples that the coupling effect of oblique coupling beams can be quite substantial and thus, should not be neglected.

0034252414	Use of condensed silica fume for making high-strength, self-consolidating concrete	A high concrete strength can be achieved by lowering the water/binder ratio and a high workability by adding a higher dosage of superplasticizer. However, a high-performance concrete with both high strength and high workability cannot be produced by just these means because lowering the water/binder ratio leads to lower workability and there is a limit to the increase in workability that can be attained by adding superplasticizer. To produce a high-strength, high-workability concrete, the concrete strength needs to be increased without lowering the water/binder ratio. This can be done by adding condensed silica fume. In this study, a series of trial mixing aimed at developing high-strength, self-consolidating concrete (mean cube strength >80 MPa and needs no compaction for consolidation) was carried out. Several mixes suitable for making such high-performance concrete have been developed and it was found that the addition of condensed silica fume may, under favourable conditions, increase not only the strength but also the workability of the concrete mix. Based on the trial mix results, charts for the design of high-strength, high-workability concrete mixes made of the studied constituents are presented.

38149126388	Effects of packing density, excess water and solid surface area on flowability of cement paste	Although it has been postulated for many years that it is excess water rather than whole water that lubricates the cementitious materials and governs flowability of paste (excess water is water in excess of that needed to fill up voids), there has been no detailed investigations to study the actual effects of excess water. This was due to the lack of a suitable method for measuring the packing density and voids content of cementitious materials, To resolve the problem, the authors have recently developed a new wet packing method that was applied herein to measure the packing densities and voids contents of cementitious materials containing different amounts of cement, pulverised fuel ash and condensed silica fume. The flowability properties of the paste formed of the cementitious materials with different water contents were also measured and correlated to the excess water contents, each determined as water content minus voids content. The results revealed that whereas an improvement in packing density would increase excess water content, flowability is governed mainly by excess water to solid volume and excess water to solid surface area ratios.

39749099495	Heat loss compensation in semi-adiabatic curing test of concrete	To alleviate early thermal cracking of concrete, a maximum limit is often imposed on the adiabatic temperature rise, which has to be measured by an adiabatic curing test using a specially designed curing chamber. In practice, for convenience and simplicity, the curing tests conducted on site are not truly adiabatic and thus should be regarded as semi-adiabatic. In a semi-adiabatic curing test, due to heat loss, the measured temperature rise is lower than .the adiabatic temperature rise by an error dependent on the specimen size and the heat insulation provided. Herein, to minimize such error, a heat loss compensation method of estimating the heat loss from the spatial and time variations of the measured temperature and compensating for the heat loss, accordingly, is proposed. Ten laboratory-made concrete mixtures were tested to verify the applicability of the method. In addition, two batches of ready mixed concrete, each cast into 0.5 and 1.0 m (1.64 and 3.28 ft) cubes, were tested to demonstrate how a semi-adiabatic curing test could become independent of specimen size and much less affected by imperfect insulation after heat loss compensation. With the proposed heat loss compensation applied, the errors in the adiabatic temperature rise were all within ±1.3 °C (±2.3 °F). Copyright © 2008, American Concrete Institute. All rights reserved,.

38349153245	Rheology of cement paste: Role of excess water to solid surface area ratio	Although many attempts have been made in previous research to identify the various parameters governing the rheology of cement paste, there has been little progress in evaluating the combined effects of these parameters. In this paper, a new parameter, the excess water to solid surface area ratio, is proposed to evaluate the combined effects of water content, packing density, and solid surface area on the rheological properties of cement paste. For the purpose of determining the value of this new parameter, a new wet packing method has been developed to measure the packing density of cementitious materials so that the voids content of the cementitious materials and the amount of excess water in the cement paste can be quantified. A number of cement paste samples containing different proportions of cement, pulverized fuel ash and condensed silica fume, and different water contents have been tested and their rheological properties, as measured by a rheometer, correlated to the new parameter. The correlation revealed that the excess water to solid surface area ratio, which serves as an indicative measure of the average water film thickness, is the single most important factor governing the rheology of cement paste. © 2008 ASCE.

3342966115	Flexural strength-ductility performance of flanged beam sections cast of high-strength concrete	Flanged sections are often used for long-span concrete beams to maximize their structural efficiency. However, although for the same sectional area a flanged section could render a higher flexural strength, it would also lead to a lower flexural ductility, especially when heavily reinforced. Thus, when evaluating the flexural performance of a beam section, both the flexural strength and ductility need to be considered. In this study, the post-peak flexural behaviour of flanged sections is evaluated by means of an analytical method that uses the actual stress-strain curves of the materials and takes into account strain reversal of the tension reinforcement. From the numerical results, the flexural strength-ductility performance of flanged sections is investigated by plotting the strength and ductility that could be simultaneously achieved in the form of design graphs. It is found that (1) at the same overall dimensions and with the same amount of reinforcement provided, a flanged section has lower flexural ductility than a rectangular section; (2) at the same overall dimensions, a flanged section has inferior strength-ductility performance compared to a rectangular section; and (3) at the same sectional area, a flanged section has better strength-ductility performance compared to a rectangular section.

58849118915	Rheology of mortar and its influences on performance of self-consolidating concrete	A two-part experimental program is presented in this paper. In the first part, four self-consolidating mortar mixes were designed with different compositions of cementitious materials including cement, pulverized fuel ash and condensed silica fume. For each SCM mix composition, the superplasticizer dosage was varied and a total of 30 batches of mortar were produced. For every batch of mortar, the rheology was determined by a rheometer and the workability was measured by the mini slump flow test and the mini V-funnel test. From the test results, the saturation SP dosage of each SCM mix was determined. In the second part, four self-consolidating concrete mixes were produced, each comprising a SCM mix with saturation SP dosage and a fixed coarse aggregate content. The workability, filling and passing abilities and segregation stability were measured by the slump flow, U-box and sieve segregation tests, respectively. It was found that the performance of all the SCC mixes was satisfactory. The test results suggested that using a SCM mix with saturation SP dosage as the mortar phase can produce SCC with high performance and therefore is a good starting point to optimize the performance of SCC mixes.

58849135329	Adiabatic temperature rise of incompletely hydrated cement concrete	The temperature rise of concrete during hardening is intimately related to the mix proportion, among which the cement content is a major factor. However, high-strength concrete mixes are often proportioned with low water contents which leads to incomplete hydration of cement contained therein. Hence, the conventional rule of determining concrete temperature rise solely based on the cement content may not yield accurate estimations. An experimental program has been launched to investigate the coupled effects of cement and water contents on the adiabatic temperature rise of concrete. Eighteen concrete mixes were tested with a newly developed semi-adiabatic curing test method and their adiabatic temperature rise obtained by applying heat loss compensation to the test results. The results revealed that, when the water/cement ratio is lower than 0.36, both cement and water contents have effects on the adiabatic temperature rise of concrete. Prediction formula and design chart of adiabatic temperature rise, which are accurate to ±1.3° compared with the test results, are developed. Furthermore, prediction formula of the degree of hydration of concrete is recommended.

84861590937	Wet packing of blended fine and coarse aggregate	All codified methods for measuring the packing density of aggregate are carried out under dry condition. However, these dry packing methods do not account for the effect of water in the concrete mix. In a previous study, a wet packing method for measuring the packing density of fine aggregate under wet condition has been developed and it was found that the packing density of fine aggregate can be substantially higher under wet condition than dry condition. Nevertheless, many researchers still believe that for coarse aggregate, it does not matter much whether the packing density is measured under dry or wet condition. In this study, the wet packing method was extended to measure the packing density of coarse aggregate and blended fine and coarse aggregate. The results revealed that whilst the packing density of coarse aggregate is only slightly higher under wet condition than dry condition, the packing density of blended fine and coarse aggregate is highly dependent on whether the aggregate is dry or wet. Hence, when measuring the packing density of blended aggregate, the wet packing method should always be used. © RILEM 2011.

84908251978	Evaluation of particle packing models by comparing with published test results	The existing particle packing density models each with two or more parameters accounting for certain particle interactions (the loosening effect parameter, wall effect parameter, wedging effect parameter, and compaction index, denoted by a, b, c, and K, respectively) may be classified into the 2-parameter model (with a and b incorporated), the compressible model (with a, b, and K incorporated), and the 3-parameter model (with a, b, and c incorporated). This paper evaluates these models by comparing their respective packing density predictions with the test results published in the literature. It was found that their accuracy varies with both the size ratio and volumetric fractions of the binary mix. In general, when the size ratio is larger than 0.65, all the packing models are sufficiently accurate. However, when the size ratio is smaller than 0.65, some of them become inaccurate and the errors tend to be larger at around the volumetric fractions giving maximum packing density. Relatively, the 3-parameter model is the most accurate and widely applicable.

42449154732	Packing density of cementitious materials: Part 1-measurement using a wet packing method	The packing characteristics of the cementitious materials have great influence on the performance of a concrete mix, but there is so far no generally accepted method of measurement. Herein, a new method, called the wet packing method, is developed. It mixes the cementitious materials with water and then measures the apparent density and voids content of the resulting mixture at varying water/cementitious materials ratio to characterise the packing behaviour of the cementitious materials. Trial mixing and testing revealed that the mixing procedure is crucial to the success of the test method. To ensure thorough mixing within a reasonable time, a special mixing procedure is adopted. Using this method, the packing characteristics of pure cement and blended cementitious materials under different conditions have been measured. Based on the results so obtained, it is advocated that the packing density and water demand should be measured directly using a wet packing method rather than indirectly by any consistence test because the water content at any preset consistence is not necessarily the same as the minimum water content needed to fill up the voids. Some useful applications of the new method are illustrated in Part 2 of this paper. © 2007 RILEM has copyright.

42449162649	Packing density of cementitious materials: Part 2-packing and flow of OPC + PFA + CSF	The wet packing method developed in Part 1 [Wong HHC, Kwan AKH (2007) Packing density of cementitious materials: part 1 measurement using a wet packing method. Mater Struct (Paper No. MAAS3281)] has been successfully applied to measure the packing densities of cementitious materials containing ordinary Portland cement (OPC), pulverised fuel ash (PFA) and condensed silica fume (CSF). The test results for non-blended materials revealed that whilst the addition of a superplasticiser would always increase the packing densities of OPC and PFA, the addition of a polycarboxylate-based superplasticiser could decrease the packing density of CSF. On the other hand, the results for blended materials showed that the packing density could be improved by double blending OPC with either PFA or CSF, and further improved by triple blending OPC, PFA and CSF together in appropriate proportions. A maximum packing density of 0.752 has been achieved and a ternary packing density diagram for determining the mix proportions for maximum packing density has been produced. Furthermore, the positive influence of a higher packing density on cement paste rheology has been demonstrated using the mini-slump cone test. Based on these results, the concept of excess water ratio, which is the major factor governing the rheology of a paste, is introduced. © 2007 RILEM has copyright.

48249108434	Performance criteria for self-consolidating concrete	Self-consolidating concrete (SCC), also called self-compacting concrete, was first developed almost two decades ago. It does not require compaction to achieve good consolidation and is becoming more and more commonly used in many parts of the world. However, SCC is not the same as high-workability concrete; a SCC is a high-workability concrete, but a high-workability concrete is not necessarily a SCC. For a high-workability concrete to be qualified as a SCC, it has to be able to flow through narrow gaps and fill up far-reaching corners in the mould under its own weight, pass through closely spaced reinforcing bars, and remain homogeneous after flowing or dropping a certain distance or through obstacles. In other words, a SCC should have, apart from high workability, also high filling ability, passing ability and segregation stability. This paper introduces some new test methods for measuring the performance of SCC, recommends the performance criteria that may be adopted for different grades of SCC, and presents a laboratory study on the production of SCC using the locally available materials.

57849126324	Packing density of cementitious materials: Measurement and modelling	Packing density has great effect on the performance of a concrete mix. However, little research has been carried out on the packing density of cementitious materials owing to the lack of an established measurement method. Herein, a new method, called the wet packing method, is presented. With this method, the packing densities of blended cementitious materials, consisting of ordinary Portland cement (OPC), pulverised fuel ash (PFA) and condensed silica fume (CSF), were measured. The results verified the theory that the packing density could be significantly increased by blending two or even three cementitious materials together. Comparison between the measured results and the predicted values by three existing packing models, together with some additional tests, revealed that in the presence of a third-generation superplasticiser, the packing density of CSF is dependent on the lime content. When the lime-containing OPC and PFA contents are low, the CSF particles would flocculate and pack rather loosely, but at higher OPC and PFA contents, or with lime added, the CSF would pack to a higher density. With the effect of lime accounted for, very good agreement between the measured results and the predictions by the packing models was achieved.

59649088807	Effects of cement and water contents on adiabatic temperature rise of concrete	The temperature rise of concrete during curing is dependent on the mixture composition and proportions, among which the cement content should be the major factor. If the water content is relatively low, however, the cement would not fully hydrate and the water content should also have significant effects. This paper reports an experimental program aiming to investigate the combined effects of cement and water contents by measuring the adiabatic temperature rise of concrete mixtures with different mixture proportions. A newly developed semi-adiabatic curing test method with heat loss compensation applied was employed to measure the adiabatic temperature rise of the concrete mixtures. The results reveal that, for a given paste volume, the adiabatic temperature rise would be highest at a water-cement ratio (w/c) of 0.36; therefore, the adiabatic temperature rise of a higher strength concrete is not necessarily higher. Furthermore, the degree of hydration would gradually decrease as the w/c decreases. Based on these results, design charts and formulas for predicting the adiabatic temperature rise, heat generation, and degree of hydration of concrete mixtures with w/c ranging from 0.28 to 0.48 have been developed.

65449147943	Shrinkage movement analysis of reinforced concrete floors constructed in stages	Reinforced concrete floors constructed between movement restraints often crack seriously due to shrinkage after completion. One common mitigation measure is to construct the concrete floors in stages to allow part of the shrinkage movement to take place before completion. However, shrinkage movement analysis of concrete floors constructed in stages is quite cumbersome, as the structural configuration changes during construction, thus necessitating reanalysis of the partially completed structure at each stage. Herein, a finite element method for shrinkage movement analysis of concrete floors constructed in stages is developed. It analyses the whole structure, including the completed and uncompleted portions, at all stages. The same mesh is used all the time and therefore re-meshing and location matching are no longer necessary. This is achieved by giving negligibly small stiffness to the uncompleted portions, which in reality do not exist yet. In the analysis, the locked-in strains due to increase in elastic modulus as the concrete hardens and the creep of the hardened concrete are taken into account. Most important of all, this method would enable fully automatic shrinkage movement analysis for the purpose of construction control.

67449104340	Optimum superplasticiser dosage and aggregate proportions for SCC	An experimental study has been carried out to investigate the effect of superplasticiser dosage on the performance of self-consolidating concrete (SCC). Seven concrete mixes with water/cement (w/c) ratios ranging from 0-35 to 0-45 and fine/total (F/T) aggregate ratios ranging from 0-40 to 0-60 were designed and 42 batches of concrete containing different dosages of superplasticiser were produced. The workability, passing and filling abilities, and segregation stability of the concrete produced were measured using the slump flow, U-box, and sieve segregation tests respectively. For each concrete mix designed, the superplasticiser dosages for maximum slump flow without segregation and maximum filling height were determined. It was found that the maximum performance of the concrete mix and the respective required superplasticiser dosage are dependent on the w/c and F/T aggregate ratios. In general, increasing the F/T aggregate ratio would improve the maximum performance but would also increase the superplasticiser dosage needed. Lastly, the robustness of each concrete mix was evaluated quantita-tively as the range of superplasticiser dosage or slump flow satisfying all requirements for SCC Based on these results, the optimum superplasticiser dosage for maximum robustness of each concrete mix was determined.

67349114807	Packing density measurement and modelling of fine aggregate and mortar	A newly developed wet packing method has been applied to measure the packing densities of blended fine aggregates (each a mixture of fine aggregates of different sizes) and mortars (each a mixture of cement and blended fine aggregate) under the wet condition, with or without superplasticizer added, and with or without compaction applied. For the blended fine aggregates, the conventional dry packing method has also been employed to measure their packing densities under the dry condition and the results show that the packing density of fine aggregate is generally higher under wet condition than under dry condition. For both the blended fine aggregates and mortars, the measured packing densities have been compared to the predicted packing densities by two existing packing models. Good agreement between the measured and predicted packing densities has been achieved with the mean absolute error being 2.1% for the blended aggregates and 1.1% for the mortars. This is the first time that the packing densities of mortar samples are directly measured and compared to predictions by packing models to verify the applicability of the wet packing method and the packing models. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

67349183709	Wet packing of crushed rock fine aggregate	It is well known that the performance of concrete is dependent on the packing density of the aggregate. All existing methods of measuring the packing density of aggregate are carried out under dry condition. However, these dry packing methods are sensitive to the amount of compaction applied and do not account for the effect of water in the concrete mix. In this research, a new method, which measures the packing density of aggregate under wet condition, has been developed. It is called the wet packing method and has the advantages that it is less sensitive to the amount of compaction applied and that it includes the effect of water. The wet packing method was compared to the dry packing method by applying both methods to measure the packing density of crushed rock fine aggregate. It was found that the packing density of crushed rock fine aggregate can be 24% higher under wet condition than under dry condition and that the addition of superplasticizer can have a marginal contributing effect. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the beneficial effect of blending different size aggregates together is better revealed by the wet packing method than by the dry packing method. © 2008 RILEM.

67650401361	Flexural ductility of high-strength concrete columns with minimal confinement	The use of high-strength concrete (HSC) instead of normal-strength concrete (NSC) in columns has the advantage of allowing the column size to be reduced and is thus becoming popular. However, since HSC is more brittle than NSC, its use could result in undesirable brittle failure. To evaluate the ductility of columns, nonlinear moment-curvature analysis taking into account the stress-path dependence of the steel reinforcement is required. Based on such analysis, a parametric study has been conducted to investigate the effects of various factors on the ductility of columns. The results revealed that the effect of concrete strength is dependent on the axial stress level (axial load to area ratio) and axial load level (axial load to capacity ratio). At the same axial stress level, the use of HSC has little or basically no adverse effect on the ductility but if the same axial load level is maintained to reduce the column size, the use of HSC would significantly reduce the ductility. Finally, two formulas for direct evaluation of the ductility of columns are developed. © 2008 RILEM.

70350123313	Maximum axial load level and minimum confinement for limited ductility design of high-strength concrete columns	In the design of concrete columns, it is important to provide some nominal flexural ductility even for structures not subjected to earthquake attack. Currently, the nominal flexural ductility is provided by imposing empirical deemed-to-satisfy rules, which limit the minimum size and maximum spacing of the confining reinforcement. However, these existing empirical rules have the major shortcoming that the actual level of flexural ductility provided is not consistent, being generally lower at higher concrete strength or higher axial load level. Hence, for high-strength concrete columns subjected to high axial loads, these existing rules are unsafe. Herein, the combined effects of concrete strength, axial load level, confining pressure and longitudinal steel ratio on the flexural ductility are evaluated using nonlinear moment-curvature analysis. Based on the numerical results, a new design method that provides a consistent level of nominal flexural ductility by imposing an upper limit to the axial load level or a lower limit to the confining pressure is developed. Lastly, two formulas and one design chart for direct evaluation of the maximum axial load level and minimum confining pressure are produced.

7044247889	Dip and strike angles method for yield line analysis of reinforced concrete slabs	Yield line analysis is a useful method for design of reinforced concrete slabs, but has been limited to slabs of simple geometry, because up to now there has been no generally applicable and fully automatic computational procedure for complex-shaped slabs. Herein, a new yield line method that can be applied to any convex polygonal-shaped slab is developed. In this method, the deflections of the slab regions divided by yield lines are measured in terms of the dip and strike angles of the slab surfaces, which can define the geometry of all kinematically admissible collapse mechanisms or yield line patterns. The external work done and the internal energy dissipation at yield lines are evaluated as functions of the dip and strike angles, and the principle of virtual work is used to determine the corresponding load factor. The final solution is obtained by minimising the load factor with respect to the dip and strike angles. A computer program based on this method has been produced. Its correctness is verified by checking against results obtained by others for simple cases, and its versatility is demonstrated by applying it to complicated slabs subjected to point, line, patch and uniformly distributed loads.

0034826342	Model for dowel action of reinforcement bars and its application to deep beam analysis	The dowel action of reinforcing steel bars crossing cracks is modeled for the finite element analysis of reinforced concrete. In the proposed model, the dowel forces and displacements are smeared over the element respectively in order to be consistent with the smeared crack and reinforcement models. The dowel action model is incorporated in a finite element procedure with displacement controlled iteration scheme and secant stiffness formulation, so as to deal with the post-peak behavior of reinforced concrete structures. The analytical results on deep beams agree closely with test data. It is concluded that the dowel action of reinforcing main bars has a significant contribution to the strength and ductility of shear critical members.

0035388646	Finite element analysis of effect of concrete confinement on behavior of shear walls	When concrete in the compression zone of a shear wall is confined by transverse reinforcement, both the strength and ductility of the wall would be increased. However, none of the existing analysis methods in the codes allows for such effect. Herein, a finite element model that takes into account the effect of concrete confinement is developed for nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete structures. In this model, the confinement effect of the transverse reinforcement is incorporated by adjusting the compressive stress-strain relation of the concrete according to the confinement index proposed by Kappos. Shear wall models tested by others under constant vertical load and monotonically increasing horizontal load are analyzed and the analytical results for the failure modes and load-deflection curves of the walls are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. Using the finite element model, a parametric study on the contribution of concrete confinement to the lateral resistance of shear walls is conducted. It is revealed that the effect of concrete confinement is more significant in walls with greater height to width ratio and/or subjected to larger axial compression load. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0035241307	Direct tension test of concrete	The measured tensile strength of concrete is dependent on the test method used. Compared with indirect methods, the direct tension test method gives results closer to the true tensile strength under pure tension condition. Herein, a new direct tension test method for prismatic specimens that uses bonded steel end plates to apply tension load to the concrete has been developed. A three-dimensional finite element analysis of the test assembly showed that the tensile stresses transmitted to the specimen are very evenly distributed. Approximately 200 concrete prisms with compressive strengths ranging from 10 to 70 MPa were tested using this method. The random distribution of the fracture location indicated that there was no preferred fracture location and no significant end effect. Split cylinder and cube compression tests were also carried out, and the results correlated to those of direct tension test to evaluate their relationship. Lastly, some extra concrete prisms of same sectional size but shorter length had been cast and tested. The dependence of direct tensile strength on specimen length revealed that there might be significant size effect, which should be studied in more details in future research.

0035254595	Modeling dowel action of reinforcement bars for finite element analysis of concrete structures	A numerical model for the dowel action of reinforcement bars crossing cracks in concrete is developed for finite element analysis of concrete structures. The beam on elastic foundation theory is used to derive the dowel force-displacement relationship, which is expressed in a smeared form in terms of dowel stress and strain in order to be compatible with the smeared crack and smeared reinforcement models commonly used in finite element analysis. This dowel action model is incorporated in a finite element program that employs secant stiffness formulation and a displacement controlled iteration scheme for nonlinear analysis. Using the finite element program, the nonlinear behaviors of several reinforced concrete beams tested by others are analyzed well into the post-peak range. The beams are analyzed first with the dowel action neglected and then again with the dowel action incorporated. It is found that in certain cases, the dowel action can have significant effects on the shear strength and ductility of reinforced concrete beams and that the analytical results generally agree better with the experimental values when the dowel action is taken into account.

0035413827	Elastic modulus of normal- and high-strength concrete in Hong Kong	The elastic modulus of concrete made in Hong Kong is not quite the same as that of concrete made elsewhere because generally the mechanical properties of concrete are dependent on the types of raw materials used and the local conditions, which vary from place to place. Two separate experimental studies on the elastic modulus of the local concrete have been carried out in the past at The University of Hong Kong but each of these studies covered only a limited range of concrete strength. In this paper, the previous test results are summarized and the apparent discrepancy between them resolved by putting all the results together for a comprehensive statistical analysis. The outcome is a new correlation equation between the elastic modulus and the cube compressive strength for the local concrete covering the full range of cube compressive strength from 15 to 100 MPa. Lastly, design values of elastic modulus for incorporation into the local codes of practice are proposed.

0035322190	Effects of various, shape parameters on packing of aggregate particles	The shape of the aggregate particles used has significant effects on the properties of the concrete produced. One major effect is on the packing density of the aggregate which determines the amount of cement paste needed to fill the voids between the aggregate particles. In order to study how the various shape parameters of aggregate particles would affect the packing of aggregate, aggregate samples of different rock types from different sources have been analysed for their shape characteristics using a newly developed digital image processing technique and their packing densities measured in accordance with an existing method given in the British Standard. The packing densities of the aggregate samples are correlated to the shape parameters to evaluate the effects of the various shape parameters on packing. From the results of the correlation, it is found that the shape factor and the convexity ratio are the most important shape parameters affecting the packing of an aggregate. Two alternative formulas revealing the combined effects of these two shape parameters on the packing density of aggregate are proposed.

73249117821	Flexural ductility of prestressed concrete beams with unbonded tendons	Based on a numerical method to analyse the full-range behaviour of prestressed concrete beams with unbonded tendons, parametric studies are carried out to investigate the influence of 11 parameters on the curvature ductility of unbonded prestressed concrete (UPC) beams. It is found that, among various parameters studied, the depth to prestressing tendons, depth to non-prestressed tension steel, partial prestressing ratio, yield strength of non-prestressed tension steel and concrete compressive strength have substantial effects on the curvature ductility. Although the curvature ductility of UPC beams is affected by a large number of factors, rather simple equations can be formulated for reasonably accurate estimation of curvature ductility. Conversion factors are introduced to cope with the difference in partial safety factors, shapes of equivalent stress blocks and the equations to predict the ultimate tendon stress in BS8110, EC2 and ACI318. The same equations can also be used to provide conservative estimates of ductility of UPC beams with compression steel.

77249157881	Water film thickness, flowability and rheology of cement-sand mortar	It is well known that the fresh properties of cement paste and cement-sand mortar are governed mainly by three parameters: water content, packing density and solid surface area. However, these parameters vary simultaneously upon any change in the mix composition and hence the evaluation of their individual and combined effects has been a difficult task. Recently, the authors have found that the effects of these parameters on the flowability and rheological properties of cement paste may be evaluated in terms of the water film thickness (WFT) of the solid-water mixture. Herein, this concept of WFT is extended to cement-sand mortar made of sand with a maximum size of 1.18 mm. A number of mortar samples proportioned with different water contents and different sand gradings were produced for packing density, flowability and rheological properties measurements. From the results, the WFT of each sample was determined and the effects of the WFT on the flowability and rheological properties of the mortar were investigated. The good correlations between the flowability and rheological properties with the WFT revealed that the concept of WFT is applicable also to cement-sand mortar. © 2010 Thomas Telford Ltd.

77449146422	Minimum flexural ductility design of high-strength concrete columns	High-strength concrete (HSC) has been widely used in the column construction of tall buildings because of its larger stiffness and strength-to-weight ratio. The current design of HSC columns emphasises the strength design but pays little attention to the ductility design. From structural safety point of view, however, it is important to provide a minimum level of ductility to all structures even they are not subjected to earthquake attack. Currently, this minimum level of ductility in concrete columns is provided by imposing empirical deemed-to-satisfy rules, which limit the minimum size and maximum spacing of the confinement. However, these rules, which are concrete strength independent, have the shortcoming that the ductility level provided Is not consistent - generally lower at higher concrete strength or higher axial load level. To overcome such shortcoming, an extensive parametric study based on nonlinear moment-curvature analysis that investigates the combined effects of concrete strength, axial load level, confining pressure and longitudinal steel ratio on the ductility of concrete columns is conducted herein. Based on the results, a new design inequality and chart are developed, which ensures that a consistent level of ductility could be provided to all concrete columns by limiting the maximum axial load level and minimum confinement.

75749084752	Effectiveness of adding confinement for ductility improvement of high-strength concrete columns	The use of high-strength concrete (HSC) can reduce the size of columns in tall buildings and save space. However, this will also reduce the flexural ductility of the columns. To restore the flexural ductility after using HSC, additional confinement has been recommended. In this paper, the effect of adding confinement on the flexural ductility of HSC columns is studied by nonlinear moment-curvature analysis taking into account the stress-path dependence of the steel reinforcement. The analytical results reveal that the addition of confinement would enhance the flexural ductility of columns by increasing the balanced steel ratio and balanced axial load level. However, the effectiveness of adding confinement to improve the flexural ductility of columns decreases as the axial load level or concrete strength increases. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of adding confinement, two previously derived formulas correlating the flexural ductility to various structural parameters are extended to incorporate the effect of the confining pressure. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study aims to extend the concept of WFT to mortar containing condensed silica fume (CSF). For the study, mortar samples with various CSF and water contents were made for packing density, flowability and rheology measurements. It was found that although the effects of adding CSF are fairly complicated, the WFT is still the single most important parameter governing the rheology of CSF mortar. However, the rheological properties are dependent also on the CSF content. Correlations of the rheological properties to both the WFT and CSF content yielded R

77953299031	Reducing drying shrinkage of concrete by treatment of aggregate	Drying shrinkage of concrete has been found to cause cracking, water leakage and other serviceability problems and is thus an important research topic. In early studies, it has been found that the shrinkage of concrete varies with the rock aggregate used. This is partly because the aggregate also shrinks and the shrinkage of aggregate is dependent on the type of rock from which the aggregate is derived. However, there have been few studies on the shrinkage of rock and how the shrinkage of aggregate would affect the shrinkage of concrete. In this study, the shrinkage of the granite rock in Hong Kong was measured. It has been found that the rock shrinks quite substantially upon drying and that its shrinkage is dependent on the initial moisture condition. Based on such observation, two alternative methods of treating the aggregate before use so as to reduce the shrinkage of concrete are proposed. Long-term shrinkage measurement of concrete made with untreated and treated aggregates revealed that the proposed methods of aggregate treatment, which are still rudimentary, can significantly reduce the shrinkage of concrete. © 2010 Thomas Telford Ltd.

A number of shrinkage models have been developed all over the world but they differ widely from each other, indicating that the shrinkage of concrete is dependent on the characteristics of the materials used and the local conditions. Early experimental studies in Hong Kong suggested that the shrinkage of Hong Kong concrete is considerably larger than that estimated using shrinkage models developed elsewhere. This is probably due to the local granite aggregate used. In order to resolve this problem and develop a shrinkage model for Hong Kong, a comprehensive testing programme using fibre-optic strain gauges to measure the shrinkage strain was launched. The shrinkage measurement lasted over 3.5 years and covered concrete mixes with and without pulverised fuel ash added and with paste volume varying from 30 to 40%. © 2010 Thomas Telford Ltd.

77955274940	Improving performance and robustness of SCC by adding supplementary cementitious materials	One major difficulty with large scale production of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) is to consistently maintain the required high performance. In overcoming such difficulty, the robustness of the concrete mix is a key factor to be considered. Herein, it is proposed to add pulverized fuel ash (PFA) and/or condensed silica fume (CSF) to improve the robustness of SCC. To evaluate the effectiveness of adding these supplementary cementitious materials, an experimental program has been launched, in which thirty batches of concrete containing different amounts of supplementary cementitious materials and different dosages of superplasticizer were produced for testing. The workability, passing and filling abilities, and segregation stability of each batch of concrete were measured by the slump flow, U-box and sieve segregation tests, respectively. It was demonstrated that the addition of PFA and/or CSF can significantly improve the performance and, more importantly, the robustness of SCC. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

77955759498	Modelling dowel action of discrete reinforcing bars in cracked concrete structures	Dowel action is one of the component actions for shear force transfer in cracked reinforced concrete. In finite element analysis of concrete structures, the use of discrete representation of reinforcing bars is considered advantageous over the smeared representation due to the relative ease of modelling the bond-slip behaviour. However, there is very limited research on how to simulate the dowel action of discrete reinforcing bars. Herein, a numerical model for dowel action of discrete reinforcing bars crossing cracks in concrete is developed. The model features the derivation of dowel stiffness matrix based on beam-on-elastic-foundation theory and the direct assemblage of dowel stiffness into the concrete element stiffness matrices. The dowel action model is incorporated in a nonlinear finite element programme with secant stiffness formulation. Deep beams tested in the literature are analysed and it is found that the incorporation of dowel action model improves the accuracy of analysis. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.

77955208695	Ductility design of high-strength concrete beams and columns	High-strength concrete (HSC) is increasingly used for the construction of tall buildings and long span bridges. However, most engineers just focus on how to better utilize the strength potential of HSC and little attention is paid to ensure that the HSC structures would have sufficient ductility. In this regard, it should be noted that the current design codes, which do not provide any guidelines for ductility design, are not applicable to HSC structures. In recent years, the authors have been conducting research on how the use of HSC would affect the flexural ductility of concrete members. Herein, an overall summary of their research is presented. It will be shown that depending on the reinforcement detailing and loading conditions, the ductility of HSC structures is not necessarily lower than that of normal concrete structures. Finally, guidelines for the ductility design of HSC beams and columns, augmented with design formulas and charts, are given.

77957711244	Tension stiffening in concrete beams. Part 1: FE analysis	Although after cracking, concrete has negligible tension capacity, the intact concrete between cracks within the tension zone of a reinforced concrete beam can still develop significant tensile stresses to contribute to the flexural stiffness of the concrete beam. Such a tension stiffening effect in a flexural member is not quite the same as that in an axial member because the tensile stresses in a cracked flexural member are induced not only by the steel reinforcement-concrete bond but also by the curvature of the flexural member. In this study, the tensile stresses developed in cracked concrete beams are analysed using a finite-element (FE) model that takes into account the non-linear biaxial behaviour of the concrete and the non-linear bond stress-slip behaviour of the steel reinforcement-concrete interface. Based on the numerical results so obtained, a tensile stress block is proposed for section analysis of the moment-curvature curves of reinforced concrete beams at both the uncracked and cracked states. It will be shown in part 2 of this paper that the tensile stress block may also be used for member analysis of the load-deflection curves of concrete beams without resorting to FE analysis.

77957718165	Tension stiffening in concrete beams. Part 2: Member analysis	Based on finite-element analysis of cracked reinforced concrete beams, a tensile stress block was proposed in part 1 of this paper. Here, the proposed tensile stress block is contrasted with existing ones developed by others to provide an overall review. The proposed tensile stress block is then applied to a section analysis of beams to evaluate the moment-curvature curves of typical beam sections. The section analysis results are compared with available experimental results and empirical curves given in design codes to demonstrate the validity of the tensile stress block. Subsequently, the proposed tensile stress block is applied to member analysis by first dividing the beam member into short segments and then applying section analysis to each segment to evaluate the load- deflection curves of typical beam members. The member analysis results are checked against finite-element analysis results and available experimental results to fine-tune the tensile stress block and verify the accuracy of the finetuned tensile stress block. Such member analysis could be extended to multi-level analysis of frame structures for their full-range load-deflection behaviour at the elastic, post-crack and post-peak states.

78649266603	Shrinkage of high-strength concrete and high-flowability concrete	Throughout the years, a large amount of research on the shrinkage of normal concrete with cube compressive strength up to 60 MPa has been carried out. Relatively, the amount of research on the shrinkage of high-strength concrete and high-fiowability concrete is not as much. However, some engineers have raised the concern that as these high-performance concretes tend to contain more cementitious materials or have a larger paste volume, their shrinkage might be larger than that of normal concrete. To address this issue and find out whether the shrinkage of high-performance concretes could be a major problem, a comprehensive testing programme using optical fibre strain gauges to measure the shrinkage strains was launched. The shrinkage measurement lasted over three years and covered normal concrete, high-strength concrete and high-fiowability concrete with characteristic cube strength ranging from 35 to 80 MPa, paste volume ranging from 30 - 40%, and slump flow up to 750 mm.

78651304266	Adiabatic temperature rise of pulverized fuel ash (PFA) concrete	Owing to the less exothermic pozzolanic reaction of pulverized fuel ash (PFA) compared to cement hydration, the addition of PFA can reduce the heat generation of concrete during its hardening. However, as the water to binder (W/B) ratio would affect the proportions of cement and PFA that could react with water, the conventional practice of determining concrete temperature rise solely based on the cement and PFA contents may not yield accurate estimations. An experimental programme was launched to investigate the adiabatic temperature rise of PFA concrete mixes. Seven concrete mixes without PFA added and 14 concrete mixes with PFA dosages at 20% and 40% were tested with the recently developed semi-adiabatic curing test method. The adiabatic temperature rise was obtained by applying heat loss compensation to the test results. It was found that the incorporation of PFA could suppress the adiabatic temperature rise by 4°C to 14°C. The test results revealed the dependence of adiabatic temperature rise on both PFA dosage and W/B ratio, whose combined effects can be accurately addressed via the prediction formula and design chart developed herein.

78651332725	Improving packing density of powder in cement paste for production of high-performance concrete	The packing density of the powder in cement paste has great influence on the performance of the concrete. A higher packing density could at the same water/powder ratio increase the amount of excess water for lubricating the cement paste and thereby improve the flowability of the concrete. Alternatively, it would allow the water/powder ratio to be reduced to improve the strength of the concrete without compromising the flowability. Therefore, it is of great interest, especially for production of high-performance concrete, to maximize the packing density of the powder. This study aims to investigate the roles of superplasticizer and fillers in the packing density of the powder in cement paste. Packing density tests were carried out to determine the packing density of cement with various dosages of superplasticizer and different fillers (limestone fine, superfine cement and condensed silica fume) added using a newly developed wet packing method. The results showed that the addition of superplasticizer can significantly improve the packing density of cement while the addition of fillers can further improve the packing density of the powder.

79551591958	Mortar design based on water film thickness	The rheology of a fresh concrete is largely determined by the rheology of its mortar portion and hence proper design of the mortar portion should be the first step in the mix design of concrete, especially high-performance concrete. In recent studies, it has been demonstrated that the factors affecting the rheology of cement paste include the water content, packing density and solid surface area and that the combined effects of these factors may be evaluated in terms of the water film thickness (WFT). The present study aims to extend this concept of WFT to cement-sand mortar for the purpose of developing a mix design method based on the WFT. In the study, mortar samples with various water, cement and aggregate contents were produced for packing density, flowability, rheology, cohesiveness and adhesiveness measurements. It was found that both the WFT and cement/aggregate ratio have major effects on the rheological performance of mortar, but the WFT is still the single most important factor. Lastly, based on the test results, a design chart for the mix design of mortar was developed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

79951497927	Effects of CSF content on rheology and cohesiveness of mortar	It is widely known that the addition of condensed silica fume to a concrete mix would improve the cohesiveness and hence segregation stability. However, quite often, this would also impair the flowability. To study the overall effects of condensed silica fume, an experimental programme was launched, whereby 45 mortar samples with different condensed silica fume contents and water/solid ratios, each representing the mortar portion of a concrete mix, were tested for their rheological properties, cohesiveness and packing densities. Their rheological properties were measured in terms of flow spread, flow rate, yield stress and apparent viscosity, while their cohesiveness and packing densities were measured using the sieve segregation and wet packing tests respectively. It was found that the effect of condensed silica fume on flowability could be positive or negative, depending on the water/solid ratio, and when the water/solid ratio is low, the addition of condensed silica fume would improve the flowability by increasing the packing density. It was also found that the effect of condensed silica fume on cohesiveness is always positive. Put together, the overall flowability-cohesiveness performance would be improved by the addition of condensed silica fume. Thomas Telford Ltd © 2011.

0035499735	Post-peak behavior and flexural ductility of doubly reinforced normal- and high-strength concrete beams	The complete moment-curvature curves of doubly reinforced concrete beams made of normal- or high-strength concrete have been evaluated using a newly developed analytical method that takes into account the stress-path dependence of the constitutive properties of the materials. From the moment-curvature curves and the strain distribution results obtained, the post-peak behavior and flexural ductility of doubly reinforced normal- and high-strength concrete beam sections are studied. It is found that the major factors affecting the flexural ductility of reinforced concrete beam sections are the tension steel ratio, compression steel ratio and concrete grade. Generally, the flexural ductility decreases as the amount of tension reinforcement increases, but increases as the amount of compression reinforcement increases. However, the effect of the concrete grade on flexural ductility is fairly complicated, as will be explained in the paper. Quantitative analysis of such effects has been carded out and a formula for direct evaluation of the flexural ductility of doubly reinforced concrete sections developed. The formula should be useful for the ductility design of doubly reinforced normal- and high-strength concrete beams.

0035521831	Flexural strength and ductility of reinforced normal- and high-strength concrete beams	A number of singly reinforced concrete beams made of normal- and high-strength concretes were tested under monotonically increasing loads to study their flexural behaviour and to compare the flexural ductility of normal- and high-strength concrete beams. The flexural strength results verified that British Standard BS 8110, after modification as per the recommendation of The Concrete Society Technical Report 49, is reasonably accurate for application to high-strength concrete beams. On the other hand, the flexural ductility results revealed that the major structural parameters determining the ductility of singly reinforced beams are: (1) for given materials, the tension steel ratio; and (2) in more general cases, the tension steel to balanced steel ratio and the concrete grade. Based on the available test results, a simple formula for predicting the ductility of normal-and high-strength concrete beams is developed. Lastly, in order to avoid brittle failure, it is proposed to set a maximum limit to the tension steel to balanced steel ratio, whose values at different concrete strengths are given in the paper.

0036553864	Effects of using high-strength concrete on flexural ductility of reinforced concrete beams	The complete moment-curvature behavior and flexural ductility of reinforced concrete beams made of normal- or high-strength concrete have been analyzed by a newly developed theoretical method that uses the actual stress-strain curves of the materials and takes into account the strain reversal of the tension reinforcement in the analysis. It was found that as expected the flexural ductility decreases with the tension steel ratio and increases with the compression steel ratio. However, the variation of the flexural ductility with the concrete grade is quite complicated; at fixed tension and compression steel ratios, the flexural ductility increases as the concrete grade increases but at a given degree of being under- or over-reinforced, the flexural ductility decreases as the concrete grade increases. In order to better reveal the combined effects of the steel ratios and the concrete grade, the flexural ductility has been plotted against the flexural strength for different steel ratios and concrete grades. From the graphs plotted, it can be clearly seen that the use of a higher grade concrete could increase flexural ductility at same flexural strength, increase flexural strength at same flexural ductility, or increase both flexural strength and flexural ductility.

0036665384	Shock vibration test of concrete	A new test method for evaluating the effects of shock vibration on concrete has been developed. In this method, shock vibrations are applied to prismatic specimens by hammering each specimen at one end in the longitudinal direction. During the test, the shock vibration applied is measured by using an accelerometer, from which the signals are first digitized and then analyzed to yield the peak particle velocity of the pure vibration component, taken herein as the intensity of the shock vibration. The short- and longterm effects on the concrete are examined by: 1) visual inspection of cracks; 2) ultrasonic tests conducted before and after the hammer impact; and 3) direct tension and equivalent cube strength tests of hammered and control specimens at the age of 28 days. Test results obtained thus far revealed that the major damage caused by shock vibration was the formation of cracks. Even when cracks were not observed on the surfaces, however, there could be significant reductions in ultrasonic pulse velocity and tensile strength, probably due to the formation of internal cracks not observable on the surface. On the other hand, the effect on compressive strength appeared to be relatively small.

0036486550	Testing of coupling beams with equal end rotations maintained and local joint deformation allowed	The strength and ductility of the coupling beams in coupled shear walls can significantly affect the nonlinear behaviour and earthquake resistance of the whole building structure. However, although extensive testing of coupling beams has been performed, the boundary conditions-that the rotations at the two ends of a coupling beam are equal and that local deformation occurs at the beam-wall joints, which could have substantial influence on the test results-have not been correctly simulated. Herein, a new method of testing reinforced concrete coupling beams that ensures equal rotations at the ends of the beam specimen and takes into account local deformation at the beam-wall joints is developed. The method has been successfully applied to test typical reinforced concrete coupling beams with relatively small span/depth ratios and proven to be suitable for studying the post-peak behaviour and failure characteristics of short coupling beams. Test results obtained so far indicate that reinforced concrete coupling beams with small span/depth ratios behave quite differently from ordinary beams in frame structures and that the local deformation at beam-wall joints is quite substantial. Complete load-deflection curves have been acquired and the strength and ductility of the coupling beams evaluated.

0036694950	Cyclic behaviour of deep reinforced concrete coupling beams	Six half-scale models of reinforced concrete coupling beams with span/depth ratios ≤ 2.0 were tested under reversed cyclic load by a newly developed test method that can accurately simulate the boundary conditions of coupling beams in coupled shear wall structures. Five of them were conventionally reinforced and one was diagonally reinforced. Span/depth ratio and reinforcement layout were the main structural variables studied. Test results revealed that the deep conventionally reinforced coupling beams behaved quite differently from the ordinary beams in frame structures. Generally, shear failure was more likely to occur. Moreover, the additional longitudinal reinforcement bars (those placed near the centroidal axis) could contribute significantly to bending strength and therefore lead to an increase in shear demand. Nevertheless, the measured drift ratios of the conventionally reinforced coupling beams still reached 3·6-5·7%, which are not small for deep coupling beams. On the other hand, it was found that the provision of diagonal reinforcement radically changed the load resisting mechanism and significantly improved the energy dissipation capacity of the coupling beam. However, it had not improved the deformability of the coupling beam.

79957823166	Heat generation of curing fly ash concrete at different w/cm	It is well known that the heat generation of curing concrete is higher when the cement content is higher and lower when part of cement is replaced by fly ash (FA). As the water-cementitious material ratio (w/cm,) would affect the proportions of cementitious materials that would react with water, however, it should also have certain effect. To study the combined effects of FA replacement and w/cm, the temperature rises of concrete mixtures with FA replacement ratios ranging from 0 to 40% and w/cm ranging from 0.24 to 0.48 were tested. Heat loss compensation was applied to obtain the adiabatic temperature increases of the concrete mixtures. The results revealed that the heat generation is lower at a lower w/cm, and the reduction in heat generation due to FA replacement is greater at a higher w/cm. At the same required strength, however, the effectiveness of FA replacement in reducing heat generation is higher at a higher strength level when the w/cm is relatively low. Copyright © 2011.

79959782020	Adiabatic temperature rise of condensed silica fume (CSF) concrete	Condensed silica fume (CSF) is often added into concrete mixes to enhance the properties of concrete. However, the effect of CSF on the heat evolution and temperature rise of concrete is not clearly known. Test results in the literature are insufficient and sometimes contradictory to enable any conclusion to be drawn regarding the role of CSF in heat generation behaviour of concrete. Moreover, since the chemical reactions of cement and CSF both involve water and hence cement and CSF are competing with each other in reacting with water, the water to binder (W/B) ratio may affect the temperature rise characteristics of concrete. This paper reports an experimental study of adiabatic temperature rise of CSF concrete conducted at The University of Hong Kong. Five concrete mixes without CSF and 10 concrete mixes with CSF dosages at 5% and 10% were tested with the recently developed semi-adiabatic curing test method. The adiabatic temperature rise was obtained by applying heat loss compensation to the test results. It was found that the addition of CSF could suppress the adiabatic temperature rise of concrete. At the same time, the strength of concrete could be enhanced. Based on the experimental results, prediction formula and design chart of adiabatic temperature rise of CSF concrete were developed. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

80053405181	Multi-layer visco-elastic creep model for time-dependent analysis of concrete structures	Time-dependent analysis of shrinkage and creep effects on concrete structures is crucial for the assessment of shrinkage cracking problem as well as for the evaluation of mitigation measures. For general structures, the time-dependent analyses are most suitably conducted using the finite element method. In accordance with the conventional concrete creep models (including the prevalent codified formulations), when the stresses in concrete vary with time, the corresponding creep strains at any time have to be determined as a summation of individual creep responses due to stress increments in preceding time intervals. However, such summation process entails the memorisation of stress histories for all finite elements, thus leading to prohibitive computer storage requirements for large analysis problems. In this paper, a multi-layer visco-elastic creep model is developed for concrete by combining rheological elements in an optimal configuration. The model successfully circumvents the need of memorising the stress histories of concrete, thereby greatly facilitates the computer analyses of timedependent effects on concrete structures. To demonstrate the general applicability of the proposed model, numerical examples on restrained concrete prism and concrete podium structure are presented. © 2007 Civil-Comp Press.

80053411649	Nonlinear multilevel analysis of reinforced concrete beams	A nonlinear multilevel analysis method for reinforced concrete beams whereby the members are divided into sub-elements and sectional analysis is utilised to evaluate stiffness degradation and strength deterioration is developed. When a reinforced concrete member is subjected to an increasing load, the critical section starts to crack and softens, whereas unloading may occur at the adjacent sections. In order to calculate the actual displacements of beams, it is necessary to obtain the stiffness of various discrete sections by sectional analysis. At sectional level, the secant stiffness is determined from moment-curvature relation, in which the curvature is evaluated based on both transverse displacements and section rotations of the member. Unloading and reloading behaviour of concrete and steel reinforcement is simulated. In carrying out multilevel analysis, in each increment step of displacement, secant iteration is performed to obtain the convergent solution satisfying equilibrium. Examples are included to demonstrate the applicability of the multilevel analysis in predicting the nonlinear load-deflection response of concrete beam with varying reinforcement ratios. © 2007 Civil-Comp Press.

80054780183	Effects of concrete-to-reinforcement bond and loading conditions on tension stiffening	Within the tension zone of a cracked reinforced concrete beam, the intact concrete between adjacent cracks is able to sustain certain level of tensile stresses and contribute to the flexural stiffness of the beam. This tension stiffening effect is of high importance in deflection calculation of concrete beams and can be accounted for in design practice by using a tensile stress block in section analysis. Recently, the authors have employed finite element analysis to evaluate the tension stress fields in cracked concrete beams. Based on the stress field results, tensile stress blocks for practical use in structural design have been formulated. To continue the study, this paper examines the sensitivity of tensile stress block to the concrete-to- reinforcement bond characteristics and to the loading conditions. It is found that the bond characteristics do not have significant effect on the tensile stress block. On the other hand, the loading conditions do significantly affect the tensile stress block. Formulas of stress block parameters are proposed to address the effect of loading conditions.

80955140479	Flexural ductility and deformability of reinforced and prestressed concrete sections	In designing a flexural member for structural safety, both the flexural strength and ductility have to be considered. For this purpose, the flexural ductility of reinforced concrete sections has been studied quite extensively. As there have been relatively few studies on the flexural ductility of prestressed concrete sections, it is not well understood how various structural parameters affect the flexural ductility. In the present study, the full-range flexural responses of reinforced and prestressed concrete sections are analyzed taking into account the nonlinearity and stress-path dependence of constitutive materials. From the numerical results, the effects of steel content, yield strength and degree of prestressing on the yield curvature and ultimate curvature are evaluated. It is found that whilst the concept of flexural ductility in terms of the ductility factor works well for reinforced sections, it can be misleading when applied to prestressed concrete sections. For prestressed concrete sections, the concept of flexural deformability in terms of ultimate curvature times overall depth of section may be more appropriate.

80855130602	Superfine cement for improving packing density, rheology and strength of cement paste	Superfine cement is a cement ground to a much higher fineness than ordinary cement. The addition of a small quantity of superfine cement to fill into the voids of ordinary cement can improve the packing density of the cement and thereby reduce the amount of mixing water needed to fill the voids. In this study, the effects of superfine cement on the packing density of cement (directly measured by a wet packing test), the water film thickness of cement paste (taken as the excess water to solid surface area ratio), and the flowability, rheology and strength of cement paste were investigated. The results showed that the addition of 10% to 20% superfine cement can significantly increase the packing density of the cement and the water film thickness of the cement paste. Such increases in packing density and water film thickness would then improve the flowability, rheology and strength of the cement paste. Hence, superfine cement is an effective cementitious filler for improving cement performance. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

81255157211	Effects of condensed silica fume and superfine cement on flowability of cement paste	Addition of supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) has been contradictorily reported to be beneficial or detrimental to the flowability of concrete and no general conclusion can be drawn up to now. In order to comprehensively disclose the effects of SCM on the flowability, an experimental study had been carried out to measure the flowability of a total of 100 cement paste samples with different condensed silica fume (CSF) and superfine cement (SFC) contents at a wide range of water/cementitious materials (W/CM) ratios. The results showed that the addition of CSF would decrease the flowability at a relatively high W/CM ratio but increase the flowability at a low W/CM ratio, while the addition of SFC could generally improve the flowability of cement paste. Joint addition of SFC and CSF would not exert any definite effect on flowability at a relatively high W/CM ratio but could improve the flowability at a low W/CM ratio. In-depth analysis showed that these results could be well explained by the theory of water film thickness. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84655160831	Roles of water film thickness and SP dosage in rheology and cohesiveness of mortar	In recent studies, the authors have demonstrated that the combined effects of water content, packing density and solid surface area on the rheology of mortar may be evaluated in terms of the water film thickness (WFT). However, in addition to these factors, the superplasticizer (SP) dosage also has some effects. In order to study the roles of the WFT and SP dosage in the rheology and cohesiveness of mortar, a number of cement-sand mortar samples with different SP dosages and water contents were made for packing density, rheology and cohesiveness measurements. The results showed that the packing density and WFT would increase significantly with the SP dosage. At low SP dosage, the rheology of mortar is dependent on both the WFT and SP dosage while at high SP dosage, the rheology of mortar is dependent solely on the WFT. On the contrary, the cohesiveness of mortar is always dependent on both the WFT and SP dosage. Lastly, regression analysis of the test results was carried out and very good correlations of the measured rheological parameters to the WFT and SP dosage have been achieved. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84055222095	Effects of silica fume on heat generation of curing concrete	Currently, silica fume (SF) is quite commonly used for the production of high-performance concrete. The effects ofSF on heat generation of curing concrete, however-especially in the presence of other pozzolanic materials such as fly ash (FA) and at different watercementitious material ratios (w/cm)-are still not clearly known. To study the combined effects of SF and FA at different w/cm, concrete mixtures with SF replacement up to 10%, FA replacement up to 20%, and w/cm ranging from 0.24 to 0.40 were produced for semi-adiabatic curing tests. Heat loss compensation was applied to determine the adiabatic temperature rises of the concrete mixtures. The test results revealed that 1) the heat generation per weight of cementitious materials is generally smaller at a lower w/cm; 2) within the range of parameters studied, SF replacement would reduce the amount of heat generation but increase the rate of heat generation; and 3) compared on an equal strength basis, 5 and 10% SF replacement would reduce the amount of heat generation by approximately 10% and 20%, respectively. © 2011, American Concrete Institute.

84856283313	Flexural ductility and deformability of concrete beams incorporating high-performance materials	High-performance materials, such as high-strength concrete (HSC) and high-strength steel (HSS), are often adopted in tall buildings to reduce member size and save space. The use of HSC and/or HSS can significantly increase the flexural strength of concrete members but may also adversely affect the flexural ductility and deformability. Herein, the pros and cons of using HSC and HSS in concrete beams are investigated in terms of the limits of flexural strength, ductility and deformability that can be simultaneously achieved using nonlinear moment-curvature analysis with stress-path dependence of the reinforcement taken into account. The results reveal that the use of HSC or both HSC and HSS in concrete beams can at the same strength increase the ductility and deformability, or increase the strength without depleting the ductility and deformability. However, the use of HSS has no such benefit, albeit it can reduce the steel area required. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84861183172	Incremental displacement collocation method for the evaluation of tension softening curve of mortar	The tension softening curve (TSC), showing the relationship between the cohesive tensile stress and crack opening displacement, is the constitutive law of the cohesive crack model. Due to the difficulties in measuring local deformations around the crack tip, the TSC is usually determined inversely from the global responses such as load-deflection curve or load-crack mouth opening displacement curve of pre-notched specimens. However, the use of global responses alone in the inverse analysis usually causes problems that may affect the reliability and accuracy of the TSC which is basically a local material property. To overcome these limitations, an incremental displacement collocation method (IDCM) that is able to evaluate the TSC in a step-by-step manner is proposed in this paper. Both global and local responses of a pre-notched mortar beam, which are measured using an electronic speckle pattern interferometry technique, are used in the displacement collocation process. Furthermore, the finite element model (FEM) is utilized to simulate the response of the beam. The TSCs evaluated in this study are verified through the comparisons of the global and local displacements as well as the fracture energy. A tri-linear curve was found to be the best approximation of the TSC of mortar. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84862287191	Effects of CSF on strength, rheology and cohesiveness of cement paste	A number of cement paste samples with condensed silica fume (CSF) contents ranging from 0% to 25% and different water contents were made and their respective strength, rheological properties, cohesiveness and packing density were measured. The results showed that whilst the addition of CSF would increase the strength of cement paste, there is an optimum CSF content beyond which further addition of CSF would cause reduction in strength. More importantly, the addition of CSF has great effects on the flowability, cohesiveness and packing density of cement paste, and under certain conditions can increase both the flowability and cohesiveness. In-depth analysis revealed that the various rheological properties are governed mainly by the water film thickness whereas the cohesiveness is dependent not just on the water film thickness but also on other factors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84865266494	Combined effects of water film thickness and paste film thickness on rheology of mortar	In the mortar portion of a concrete mix, the water must be more than sufficient to fill the voids between the solid particles of cement and fine aggregate whereas the paste volume must be more than sufficient to fill the voids between the solid particles of fine aggregate so that there will be excess water to form water films coating all the solid particles and excess paste to form paste films coating the fine aggregate particles. Hence, it may be postulated that the water film thickness (WFT) and the paste film thickness (PFT) have major effects on the rheology of mortar. In this study, the combined effects of WFT and PFT on the rheology, cohesiveness and adhesiveness of mortar were investigated by testing mortar samples with varying water, cement and aggregate contents. It was found that whilst the WFT is the single most important factor governing the rheology of mortar, the PFT also has significant effects. Particularly, the PFT has certain interesting effects on the cohesiveness and adhesiveness of mortar, which should be duly considered in mortar design. © 2012 The Author(s).

However, its proper use is a great concern because its over-dosage could lead to drastic reduction in the cohesiveness of concrete. Furthermore, experience has indicated that the SP demand, saturation dosage and dosage causing segregation are highly dependent on the powder content and therefore the effects of SP are not simple functions of dosage. This study aims to evaluate the effects of SP dosage on the fresh properties of cement paste containing condensed silica fume (CSF). A number of cement paste samples with different SP dosages and CSF contents were tested. The results showed that the addition of SP would improve the packing density, flowability and rheology but impair the cohesiveness of cement paste. It would also render the cement paste shear thickening. To cater for the effects of powder fineness, it is proposed that the SP dosage should be measured in terms of the quantity of SP per surface area of the powder content. © 2012 Thomas Telford Ltd.

84866108668	Wet packing method for blended aggregate and concrete mix	Although it is well known that the packing density of the particles in a concrete mix has great influence on the performance of concrete, the packing density is seldom directly measured and all codified methods for measuring packing density are carried out under dry condition. These dry packing methods do not account for the effects of water and any chemical admixture present and are not really suitable for water-solid mixtures containing cementitious materials and fine aggregate, which tend to form agglomerates under dry condition. To solve these problems, a new method, called the wet packing method, for measuring the packing density of cementitious materials, fine aggregate and mortar under wet condition has been developed. In this study, the wet packing method was extended to measure the packing density of blended fine and coarse aggregate as well as concrete mix. The results revealed that the packing density of blended aggregate and concrete mix is highly dependent on whether the aggregate and concrete mix are dry or wet. Hence, when measuring the packing density of blended aggregate and concrete mix, the wet packing method should always be used. © 2012 ASCE.

0037320628	Nonlinear behavior of deep reinforced concrete coupling beams	Six large scale models of conventionally reinforced concrete coupling beams with span/depth ratios ranging from 1.17 to 2.00 were tested under monotonically applied shear loads to study their nonlinear behavior using a newly developed test method that maintained equal rotations at the two ends of the coupling beam specimen and allowed for local deformations at the beam-wall joints. By conducting the tests under displacement control, the post-peak behavior and complete load-deflection curves of the coupling beams were obtained for investigation. It was found that after the appearance of flexural and shear cracks, a deep coupling beam would gradually transform itself from an ordinary beam to a truss composed of diagonal concrete struts and longitudinal and transverse steel reinforcement bars. Moreover, in a deep coupling beam, the local deformations at the beam-wall joints could contribute significantly (up to the order of 50%) to the total deflection of the coupling beam, especially at the post-peak stage. Finally, although a coupling beam failing in shear would have a relatively low ductility ratio of only 5 or even lower, a coupling beam failing in flexure could have a relatively high ductility ratio of 10 or higher.

0036872030	Flexural strength and ductility of reinforced concrete beams	In the design of reinforced concrete beams, especially those made of high-strength concrete and those in earthquake-resistant structures, both the flexural strength and ductility need to be considered. From the numerical results obtained in a previous study on the post-peak behaviour and flexural ductility of reinforced concrete beams, the interrelation between the flexural strength and the flexural ductility that could be simultaneously achieved was evaluated and plotted in the form of charts. Using these charts, a new method of beam design called 'concurrent flexural strength and ductility design' that would allow engineers to consider both the strength and ductility requirements at the same time before deciding on whether to use high-strength concrete or add compression reinforcement has been developed. For application to cases in which the concrete grade is prescribed, a simpler method of first determining the limits of steel ratios that would satisfy the ductility requirement and then designing the reinforcement details according to the strength requirement has also been proposed. Examples are presented to illustrate the application of these methods.

84868276998	Adding fly ash microsphere to improve packing density, flowability and strength of cement paste	Fly ash microsphere (FAM) is a superfine fly ash. Being finer than cement, it can fill into the voids between cement grains. To study the effects of adding FAM, cement paste samples with FAM contents ranging from 0 to 60% and different water contents were made for packing density, flowability and strength measurements. The results showed that the addition of up to 40% FAM would significantly increase the packing density of the cementitious materials. With the voids partially filled by FAM and the same volume of water in the voids released, the addition of FAM could increase the water film thickness of the cement paste. Consequently, the addition of FAM could increase flowability at same strength, increase strength at same flowability, or increase both strength and flowability. Hence, FAM is an effective cementitious filler for improving the performance of cement paste and concrete. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84871746448	Semi-adiabatic curing test with heat loss compensation for evaluation of adiabatic temperature rise of concrete	Early thermal cracking has been a prevalent problem in many concrete structures. To mitigate such cracking problem, the adiabatic temperature rise of the curing concrete needs to be limited. In practice, curing tests in different forms of temperature rise evaluation test (TRET) are often employed to determine the temperature rise of concrete. However, due to heat loss to the surroundings, the results from TRET do not truly reflect the temperature rise of concrete under adiabatic condition. To address this issue, a semi-adiabatic curing test method with heat loss compensation to simulate the adiabatic condition was developed as presented in this paper. Using the test method, the adiabatic temperature rise and heat generation of ordinary portland cement (OPC) concrete, pulverised fuel ash (PFA) concrete and condensed silica fume (CSF) concrete were measured. Based on the test results, design charts for estimating the adiabatic temperature rise of OPC, PFA and CSF concretes were devised.

84870945849	Adding limestone fines to reduce heat generation of curing concrete	It is well known that the heat generation of curing concrete may be reduced by decreasing the cement paste volume of the concrete. However, as the cement paste must be more than sufficient to fill the voids between aggregate particles, the cement paste volume should not be limitlessly decreased. Herein, it is proposed to add an inert filler, such as limestone fines, to fill into the voids between aggregate particles so that a smaller cement paste volume may be used and the heat generation of the concrete may be further reduced. To study the effectiveness of adding limestone fines in reducing the heat generation of curing concrete, a series of concrete mixes with water/cement ratios ranging from 0.35 to 0.60 and different amounts of limestone fines added were tested for their workability, strength and heat generation. The results revealed that the addition of limestone fines to decrease the cement paste volume would significantly increase the strength and, more importantly, substantially reduce the heat generation of the concrete.

84873706668	A 3-parameter particle packing model incorporating the wedging effect	The packing of solid particles is an important research topic in particle mechanics and powder technology. However, the packing density of particles is difficult to measure and predict. Although test methods for measurement and theoretical models for prediction have been developed, the measured results and predicted values do not always agree with each other. It is postulated herein that the discrepancies between the measured results and predicted values are mainly due to the wedging effect caused by fine particles trapped at narrow gaps between coarse particles, which has not been considered in the existing packing models. Such wedging effect is explained in the light of experimental results obtained by others and additional results obtained from a comprehensive experimental study conducted herein. It is incorporated into a new 3-parameter packing model, which provides a better insight into the packing structure of solid particles and is generally more accurate than the existing models. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84874584392	Effects of fly ash microsphere on rheology, adhesiveness and strength of mortar	This paper presents a study on the effects of fly ash microsphere (FAM), a superfine spherical-shaped fly ash that can fill into the interstitial voids in cement, on the fresh and hardened properties of mortar. Using a wet packing method to measure the packing density of the solid particles in mortar, it was found that the addition of FAM could effectively increase the packing density and decrease the voids volume. This would, at the same water content, increase the amount of excess water for forming water films coating the solid particles to improve flowability, or at the same flowability requirement, allow the water/cementitious materials ratio to be lowered to increase strength. Furthermore, the water film thickness was found to play an important role in the rheology, adhesiveness and strength of mortar, and is therefore a key parameter to be considered in the design of mortar and concrete mixes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84875705912	Reducing concrete shrinkage by aggregate treatment with polymer latex and water repellent	While the drying shrinkage of concrete is due mainly to the shrinkage of cement paste, the shrinkage of rock aggregate also plays a significant role. Hence, it should be possible to reduce the shrinkage of concrete by hampering the moisture movement across the rock aggregate so that the aggregate would not shrink after casting. Since rock is porous in nature, the moisture movement across rock can only be hampered by blocking or sealing the pores. For this purpose, the use of polymer latex or water repellent to treat the aggregate before casting is proposed. To investigate the effectiveness of such aggregate treatment, a testing program was launched, in which the water absorptions of untreated and treated aggregates were tested and the shrinkage strains of concrete made with the untreated and treated aggregates were measured up to over 600 days. The results demonstrated that the proposed aggregate treatment with polymer latex or water repellent can significantly reduce the concrete shrinkage.

84876306505	Triple blending with fly ash microsphere and condensed silica fume to improve performance of cement paste	In theory, the addition of fly ash microsphere (FAM), which is finer than cement, and condensed silica fume (CSF), which is even finer, to successively fill the voids between cement grains can increase the packing density of the cementitious materials and reduce the volume of voids to be filled with water. This would release more water to increase the flowability at same water/cementitious materials (W/CM) ratio or allow the W/CM ratio to be lowered to increase the strength at same flowability requirement. This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of FAMand CSF on the packing density of cementitious materials and the water film thickness (WFT) in cement paste and investigate the effects of the WFT on the flowability, cohesiveness, adhesiveness, and strength of cement paste. The results showed that adding FAM and CSF can significantly increase the packing density and WFT and thereby greatly improve the overall performance of cement paste. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

84879904288	Non-linear analysis and moment redistribution of prestressed concrete members	Most of the existing codes of practice allow moment redistribution to be applied to reinforced concrete design with upper limits of 20-30%. It is, however, questionable whether the same limits are valid for the design of prestressed concrete members. Research in this area dates back to the 1950s, but investigations have mainly focused on the behaviour at different servicing limits and the effects of various parameters. Work has seldom been done on the effects of moment redistribution on structural safety, as the load-carrying capacity can be compromised with increase in moment redistribution owing to the limited ductility of concrete sections. In the present study, a method for nonlinear finite-element analysis is developed to examine the relationship between the reduction in load-carrying capacity and the moment redistribution applied to the design of prestressed concrete members, and how such a relationship is affected by section deformability and plastic hinge lengths. Results suggest that due care must be exercised when codified moment redistribution for prestressed concrete members is applied.

84880223464	Roles of water film thickness in fresh and hardened properties of mortar	Supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) are commonly added to improve the performance of concrete. However, the effects of SCM on the behaviour of cement paste/mortar/concrete depend on many factors and have so far remained elusive, making the mix design of high-performance concrete containing SCM rather difficult. This paper evaluates the effects of SCM, the fresh and hardened properties of mortar made with superfine cement and condensed silica fume added at different water/cementitious materials ratios. First, the packing densities of the solid particles in the mortar samples were measured directly by a new wet packing method. Then, based on the measured packing densities, a mix parameter called water film thickness (WFT) was quantitatively evaluated. The results showed that the WFT plays important roles in the fresh and hardened properties of mortar, as demonstrated by the good correlations established between the WFT and the rheology as well as the strength of the mortar samples tested.

84880752826	Adding limestone fines, fly ash and silica fume to reduce heat generation of concrete	The conventional method of adding limestone fines and fly ash as cement replacement to reduce the heat generation of curing concrete would significantly lower the strength. To reduce the heat generation and at the same time maintain a reasonable strength, adding limestone fines as cementitious paste replacement (the cementitious paste is the paste formed of cementitious materials and water) and adding fly ash together with silica fume as cement replacement should be a better method. Herein, a series of concrete mixes with water/cementitious materials ratios ranging from 0.40 to 0.50, and various limestone fines, fly ash and silica fume contents were tested for their workability, strength and heat generation. The results revealed that limestone fines, fly ash and silica fume are all effective in reducing heat generation. With all of them added, a concrete mix with a workability of at least 200 mm slump, a cube compressive strength higher than 65 MPa and an adiabatic temperature rise of only 30°C is developed.

84881101742	Modelling dowel action of discrete reinforcing bars for finite element analysis of concrete structures	In the finite element analysis of reinforced concrete structures, discrete representation of the steel reinforcing bars is considered advantageous over smeared representation because of the more realistic modelling of their bond-slip behaviour. However, there is up to now limited research on how to simulate the dowel action of discrete reinforcing bars, which is an important component of shear transfer in cracked concrete structures. Herein, a numerical model for the dowel action of discrete reinforcing bars is developed. It features derivation of the dowel stiffness based on the beam-on-elastic- foundation theory and direct assemblage of the dowel stiffness matrix into the stiffness matrices of adjoining concrete elements. The dowel action model is incorporated in a nonlinear finite element program based on secant stiffness formulation and application to deep beams tested by others demonstrates that the incorporation of dowel action can improve the accuracy of the finite element analysis.

84881112965	Actual microstructure-based numerical method for mesomechanics of concrete	This paper presents an actual microstructure-based numerical method to investigate the mechanical properties of concrete at mesoscopic level. Digital image processing technique is used to capture the concrete surface image and generate the actual 3-phase microstructure of the concrete, which consists of aggregate, matrix and interfacial transition zones. The microstructure so generated is then transformed into a mesh or grid for numerical analysis. A finite difference code FLAC2D is used for the numerical analysis to simulate the mechanical responses and failure patterns of the concrete. Several cases of concrete with different degrees of material heterogeneity and under different compression loading conditions have been analysed. From the numerical results, the effects of the internal material heterogeneities as well as the external confining stresses are studied. It is shown that the material heterogeneities arising from the presence of different phases and the existence of interfacial transition zones have great influence on the overall mechanical behaviour of concrete and that the numerically simulated behaviour of concrete with or without confining stresses applied agrees quite well with the general observations reported in the literature.

84883192482	Yield line analysis of reinforced concrete slabs with openings by dip and strike angles wethod	Using the dip and strike angles method of representing the geometry of yield line pattern in terms of the dip and strike angles of the deflected slab segments, the yield line analysis of reinforced concrete slabs had been successfully computerized. In this study, the dip and strike angles method is generalized for applications to slabs with any number of arbitrary-shaped openings subjected to point, line, patch and uniformly distributed loads. As before, the external work done by applied loads and the internal energy dissipation along yield lines are evaluated as functions of the dip and strike angles, but to allow for the presence of openings, the external work done and internal energy dissipation within the openings are discounted. Based on the principle of virtual work, the load factor is evaluated in terms of the dip and strike angles and the yield line pattern is determined by minimizing the load factor with respect to the dip and strike angles. Examples of slabs with openings under various boundary conditions and loading patterns are presented to illustrate the applicability, efficiency and accuracy of the generalized method.

84883255421	Effects of SP on flowability and cohesiveness of cement-sand mortar	The use of superplasticizer (SP) can effectively improve the flowability of concrete but adding an excessive dosage of SP, especially when the water content is high, may impair cohesiveness and thus cause segregation. This study was to evaluate the effects of SP on the rheology of mortar with different water contents. A number of cement-sand mortar samples were produced and tested for their flowability in terms of flow spread and flow rate, and for their cohesiveness using a microversion of the sieve segregation test. The results showed that the effects of SP on flowability and cohesiveness are dependent not only on the SP dosage but also on the water content. From these results, the "saturation dosage" for achieving highest flowability and the "segregation dosage" that would cause segregation were evaluated to provide design guidance. In-depth analysis revealed that the saturation dosage and segregation dosage are different and therefore should not be mixed up. Furthermore, for best overall flowability-cohesiveness performance, the highest permissible water content plus a relatively low SP dosage should be adopted. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84883651948	Concrete mix design based on water film thickness and paste film thickness	In previous studies on the mortar portion of concrete, it has been found that the water film thickness (WFT) and paste film thickness (PFT) have major effects on the performance of mortar. The present study aims to extend the concepts of WFT and PFT to concrete. For this aim, a number of concrete mixes with various paste volumes, water/cement ratios and fine to total aggregate ratios were produced for slump, flow, strength and packing density measurements, and from the results, the combined effects of WFT and PFT on the deformability, flowability and strength of concrete were studied. It was found that whilst the WFT is the key factor governing the above properties of concrete, the PFT also has significant effects and thus is an important factor to be considered in concrete mix design. Lastly, based on the test results, two design charts for concrete mix design were produced. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84884408947	Adding limestone fines as cement paste replacement to reduce shrinkage of concrete	To reduce the shrinkage of concrete so as to alleviate the various problems so caused, a common strategy is to decrease the cement paste volume. Herein, it is proposed to add limestone fines to fill into the voids between aggregate particles so that the cement paste volume can be decreased more substantially. Following a previous study on the effectiveness of adding limestone fines as cement paste replacement in reducing the heat generation of curing concrete, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness in reducing the shrinkage of hardened concrete. A number of concrete samples with limestone fines added to replace an equal volume of cement paste are tested and the results show that the addition of limestone fines as cement paste replacement could substantially decrease the ultimate shrinkage strain by as much as 28%, and significantly increase the compressive strength.

0039621595	Non-linear seismic response of reinforced concrete slit shear walls	The reinforced concrete slit shear wall system has been introduced recently as a new breed of earthquake resistant structures. Some theoretical and experimental investigations have been conducted to study the behaviour of isolated connecting beams and slit shear wall models under static load, but little work has been carried out to investigate the dynamic behaviour of the structural system. In this paper, the non-linear seismic response of slit shear walls under earthquake excitation is analyzed. Based on a simplified structural model, which is shown to have sufficient accuracy for slit shear wall structures, the influence of the elasto-plastic behaviour of the connecting beams on the dynamic response of the slit shear wall structure is evaluated. The results reveal that yielding of the connecting beams can significantly reduce the deflection response of the slit shear wall structure and the seismic loading induced on it. Moreover, there appears to be an optimum yield strength value for the connecting beams that would lead to the best overall seismic performance of the slit shear wall system. © 1999 Academic Press.

0042884434	Theoretical analysis of post-peak flexural behaviour of normal- and high-strength concrete beams	A new method of analysing the post-peak flexural behaviour of reinforced concrete beams has been developed and applied to normal- and high-strength concrete beams. It was revealed that at the post-peak stage the neutral axis depth keeps on increasing, and at a certain point the strain in the tension reinforcement starts to decrease, even though the curvature is increasing monotonically. Such strain reversal in the tension reinforcement occurs in all concrete beams and has significant effects on the post-peak behaviour and flexural ductility of concrete beams. Therefore, the stress path dependence of the tension reinforcement needs to be taken into account in the analysis. By means of a parametric study, the variation of ultimate concrete strain with tension steel ratio and the effects of various structural parameters on flexural ductility have been studied. Based on the numerical results, design values of ultimate concrete strain that are independent of tension steel ratio have been recommended and a simple formula for predicting the flexural ductility of reinforced normal- and high-strength concrete beams has been developed.

0141842581	Study on a seismic slit shear wall with cyclic experiment and macro-model analysis	The concept of the seismic slit shear wall was proposed in the early 1990's. A series of experimental and theoretic studies on the wall with reinforced concrete short connecting beams cast in the slit were carried out. In this paper another type of slit shear wall is studied. It is one with vertical slit purposely cast within the wall, and the rubber belt penetrated by a part of web shear reinforcement as seismic energy-dissipation device is filled in the slit. Firstly, an experiment under cyclic loading was carried out on two shear wall models, one slit and the other solid. The failure mechanism and energy-dissipation capacity are compared between the two different models, which testifies the seismic performance of the slit wall improved significantly. Secondly, for engineering practice purpose, a macroscopic analytical model is developed to predict the nonlinear behavior of the slit shear wall under cyclic loading. The mechanical properties of each constituent elements of this model are based on the actual behavior of the materials. Furthermore, the effects of both the axial force and bending moment on the shear behavior are taken into account with the aid of the modified compression-field theory. The numerical results are verified to be in close agreement with the experimental measurements.

0242573634	Safety and design of vertical breakwaters	The design of the breakwaters based on the current design manual in Hong Kong uses the overall safety factor approach. This approach, in general, does not provide a safety consistent design, and lacks the invariant property by using different definitions for load effects and resistance identified through the rewriting of equilibrium equations. This study is focused on the selection of the design format to be used for designing vertical breakwaters subjected to wave loading. The required caisson width of a vertical breakwater is evaluated using Goda's formulas and different definitions of the overall safety factor. Also simple probabilistic analysis is carried out. The numerical results show that one should treat the wave induced load effects consistently in order to provide a more safety consistent design. Further, it is indicated that the overall safety factor format in the current design manual for designing breakwaters can be modified into the so-called partial safety factor format. This modification does not change the current design practice for designing breakwaters in Hong Kong, and the new format avoids the problem associated with how to take into account and interpret the uplifting wave pressure in design.

0346245220	Nonlinear finite element analysis of deep reinforced concrete coupling beams	A finite element method for analysing the nonlinear behaviour of reinforced concrete structures that accounts for cracking and compression-softening of the concrete and dowel action and confining effect of the reinforcing bars has been developed by the second and third authors. It was applied in this project to study the load-deflection behaviour and failure characteristics of deep reinforced concrete coupling beams by analysing the models previously tested by the first and second authors and using it to conduct a parametric study on the effects of varying the shear reinforcement and restraining the axial elongation of the coupling beams. The analysis showed good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results and revealed that deep coupling beams behave quite differently from ordinary beams; after cracking, a deep coupling beam behaves more like a truss with a diagonal concrete strut which rotates and causes axial elongation. On the other hand, the parametric study revealed that although adding more shear reinforcement could suppress shear-tension failure, it would cause shear-sliding failure at the beam-wall joints and that although restraining the axial elongation could increase the shear capacity, it would at the end lead to a more brittle failure. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

84890180544	Effect of particle interlock on flow of aggregate through opening	Blockage of concrete flow through opening or gap often occurs during placement of self-consolidating concrete due to particle interlock of coarse aggregate particles. Suggestions to reduce the coarse aggregate content in order to minimize such particle interlock have been made by some researchers. However, reduction of the coarse aggregate content would also decrease the particle packing density and, if overdone, might adversely affect the overall performance of the concrete. A better understanding of how particle interlock would occur is desperately needed. Herein, a systematic study on particle interlock and flow of aggregate through opening is reported. It will be shown that the aggregate grading has great effects on the flow of aggregate through opening and that to alleviate particle interlock, the fine aggregate content should be more than sufficient to fill the voids between the coarse aggregate particles so as to provide a certain thickness of excess fine coating the coarse aggregate particles. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84891363356	Packing density of concrete mix under dry and wet conditions	It is well known that the packing of particles in concrete has great effects on the performance of concrete, but existing codified methods for packing density measurement are all carried out under dry condition and do not account for the effect of water in the concrete mix. In recent studies by the authors, a wet packing method has been developed and the packing densities of cementitious materials, fine aggregate and blended fine plus coarse aggregate were found to be higher under wet condition than dry condition. In this study, both the dry and wet packing methods were applied to concrete mixes containing cementitious materials, fine aggregate and coarse aggregate. It was found that for the entire particle system in a concrete mix, the packing density is higher, the voids ratio is smaller and the filling effects of ultrafine supplementary cementitious materials are better revealed under wet condition than dry condition. Therefore, when measuring the packing density of a concrete mix, the wet packing method should always be used. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84894139207	Processing crushed rock fine to produce manufactured sand for improving overall performance of concrete	River sand (RS) and crushed rock fine (CRF) have been used as fine aggregate in concrete for centuries. However, dredging river beds for RS is now banned in many places due to its adverse environmental impacts. On the other hand, CRF has the major problems of being angular in shape and containing excessive fines. To resolve these problems, the technology of processing CRF to improve the particle shape and reduce the fines content has been developed. Such processed CRF is called manufactured sand (MS). In this research, the particle shape, size distribution, fines content and packing density of MS are studied and the effects of using MS on the performance of concrete are investigated. The results showed that the use of MS can improve the workability of fresh concrete and, if advantage is taken to reduce the water content, can reduce the cement content or increase the strength of hardened concrete. There is, therefore, a high potential for engineering the various properties of MS to enhance the overall performance of concrete. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

84894215239	Correction of strain errors induced by small rigid-body motions in electronic speckle pattern interferometry measurement	Electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) can provide non-contact, high-precision, and full-field displacement measurement. This technique is particularly useful for determining deformations on objects with high strain gradients and complex shapes. However, small rigid-body movements of the object being measured can spoil the accuracy of the ESPI measurement and cause dramatic strain errors. Based on the theory of geometric optics, formulae for evaluating the theoretical strain errors caused by different modes of rigid-body motion were explicitly derived. The proposed formulae were validated by comparing the theoretical strain errors generated from a set of known rigid-body motions with the strains obtained by ESPI. The experimental results agreed well with the theoretical results. The results further revealed that the out-of-plane rigid-body motion had the strongest influence on the strain errors among the rigid-body movements considered. An out-of-plane movement of 0.01 mm could generate a strain error of approximately 40 μ ε. Finally, a correction procedure to eliminate the strain errors has been proposed. The effectiveness of the procedure was demonstrated with a four-point bending test on a concrete beam. This study on the quantitative evaluation and correction of strain errors due to various rigid-body movements is very useful for the practical applications of the ESPI technique in deformation measurement. © 2013 The Hong Kong Institution of Engineers.

84894253952	Adding limestone fines as cement paste replacement to reduce water permeability and sorptivity of concrete	The addition of limestone fines to fill into the voids between aggregate particles can reduce the volume of voids to be filled with cement paste and thus reduce the cement paste volume needed to produce concrete. Apart from decreasing the cement clinker consumption and carbon footprint, this may have other benefits too. In previous studies, the authors have found that the addition of limestone fines as cement paste replacement would substantially improve the dimensional stability. In this study, the authors aimed to evaluate the effects on the water resistance of concrete. For the evaluation, a series of concrete mixes with various water/cement ratios and different limestone fines contents were tested for their workability, strength, water permeability, sorptivity and porosity. It was found that within the ranges of concrete mixes studied, the addition of limestone fines as cement paste replacement would significantly increase the strength and substantially improve the water resistance of the concrete produced. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84896387605	Ternary blending of cement with fly ash microsphere and condensed silica fume to improve the performance of mortar	The addition of condensed silica fume (CSF) to fill into the voids between cement grains would release the water entrapped there to form water films for lubrication. However, the large surface area of CSF would thin down the water film thickness (WFT). By adding also a cementitious material that is finer than cement but not as fine as CSF, such as fly ash microsphere (FAM), the water entrapped in the voids could be released without excessively increasing the surface area. This may produce a larger WFT and better flowability than adding CSF alone. In this research, ternary blending of cement with FAM and CSF was studied by testing mortar mixes with different amounts of FAM and CSF added. It was found that the WFT is the key factor governing the properties of mortar and that ternary blending of cement with both FAM and CSF does offer some advantages. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84898064581	Effects of fines content on packing density of fine aggregate in concrete	The fines content (particles finer than 75 μm) in aggregate has substantial effects on the performance of concrete. Since the fines content has large surface area that would increase the water demand, maximum limits are often imposed. However, the fines content would also fill into the voids between larger particles to increase the packing density and thus reduce the volume of voids to be filled with cement paste. Hence, the fines content is not entirely undesirable and it has been suggested to raise the limits on the fines content. Somehow, due to measurement difficulties, the effects of fines content on the packing density are still not well understood. Herein, the packing density of fine aggregate with varying fines content was measured using both the dry and wet packing methods. It was found that under wet condition, the highest packing density generally occurs at a fines content of about 15%. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84899695276	Effects of limestone fines on water film thickness, paste film thickness and performance of mortar	The addition of limestone fines (LF) to mortar or concrete can improve the performance of the mortar or concrete. However, the effects of adding LF appear to be dependent on the water content and paste volume, and thus it is not easy to comprehend how LF actually works. Herein, it is postulated that the effects of LF are caused by the corresponding changes in water film thickness (WFT) and paste film thickness (PFT). To study the effects of LF, a series of mortar mixes with different paste volumes and LF contents have been tested for their packing density, flowability, cohesiveness and strength. From the packing density results, the WFT and PFT of the mortar mixes were calculated and the measured properties of the mortar mixes were correlated to the WFT and PFT. It was found that the WFT and PFT are the major factors governing the performance of mortar and the effects of LF are caused by the decrease in WFT and the increase in PFT due to the addition of LF. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

0442311096	Minimum flexural ductility design of high-strength concrete beams	In the flexural design of reinforced concrete beams, apart from the provision of adequate strength, it is also necessary to provide a certain minimum level of ductility. Traditionally, this has been done by limiting the tension steel ratio or the neutral axis depth to no more than certain fixed maximum values. However, this would result in a variable level of curvature ductility depending on the concrete grade and the steel yield strength. Of greater concern is that this would lead to a lower level of curvature ductility than has been provided in the past to beams made of conventional materials when high-strength concrete and/or high-strength steel are used. It is proposed herein that instead of limiting the tension steel ratio and the neutral axis depth, it is better to set a fixed minimum to the curvature ductility factor. The maximum values of tension steel ratio and neutral axis depth corresponding to the proposed minimum curvature ductility factor for various concrete grades and steel yield strengths have been evaluated. Based on these maximum values, simplified guidelines for providing minimum flexural ductility have been developed.

1342264173	Finite element analysis of interfacial stresses in FRP-RC hybrid beams	The interfacial stresses in fiber reinforced plastic (FRP)-reinforced concrete (RC) hybrid beams were studied by the finite element method. The mesh sensitivity test shows that the finite element results for interfacial stresses are not sensitive to the finite element mesh. The finite element analysis then is used to calculate the interfacial stress distribution and evaluate the effect of the structural parameters on the interfacial behavior. It is shown that both the normal and shear stresses at the interface are influenced by the material and geometry parameters of the composite beam. This research is helpful for the understanding on mechanical behavior of the interface and design of the FRP-RC hybrid structures. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
