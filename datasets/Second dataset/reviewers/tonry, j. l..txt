0910.0075	optical cross correlation filters: an economical approach for  identifying sne ia and estimating their redshifts	large photometric surveys of transient phenomena, such as pan-starrs andlsst, will locate thousands to millions of type ia supernova candidates peryear, a rate prohibitive for acquiring spectroscopy to determine eachcandidate's type and redshift. in response, we have developed an economicalapproach to identifying sne ia and their redshifts using an uncommon type ofoptical filter which has multiple, discontinuous passbands on a singlesubstrate. observation of a supernova through a specially designed pair ofthese `cross-correlation filters' measures the approximate amplitude and phaseof the cross-correlation between the spectrum and a sn ia template, a quantitytypically used to determine the redshift and type of a high-redshift sn ia.simulating the use of these filters, we obtain a sample of sne ia which is ~98%pure with individual redshifts measured to 0.01 precision. the advantages ofthis approach over standard broadband photometric methods are that it isinsensitive to reddening, independent of the color data used for subsequentdistance determinations which reduces selection or interpretation bias, andbecause it makes use of the spectral features its reliability is greater. agreat advantage over long-slit spectroscopy comes from increased throughput,enhanced multiplexing and reduced set-up time resulting in a net gain in speedof up to ~30 times. this approach is also insensitive to host galaxycontamination. prototype filters were built and successfully used on magellanwith ldss-3 to characterize three snls candidates. we discuss how these filterscan provide critical information for the upcoming photometric supernovasurveys.

0910.5598	searching for sub-kilometer tnos using pan-starrs video mode  lightcurves: preliminary study and evaluation using engineering data	we present a pre-survey study of using pan-starrs high sampling rate videomode guide star images to search for tnos. with suitable selection of the guidestars within the pan-starrs 7 deg^{2} field of view, the lightcurves of theseguide stars can also be used to search for occultations by tnos. the besttarget stars for this purpose are stars with high signal-to-noise ratio (snr)and small angular size.in order to do this, we compiled a catalog using the snrcalculated from stars with m_v &lt;13 mag in the tycho2 catalog then cross matchedthese stars with the 2mass catalog and estimated their angular sizes from (v-k)color. we also outlined a new detection method based on matched filter that isoptimized to search for diffraction patterns in the lightcurves due tooccultation by sub-kilometer tnos. a detection threshold is set to compromisebetween real detections and false positives. depending on the theoretical sizedistribution model used, we expect to find up to a hundred events during thethree-year life time of the pan-starrs-1 project. we have tested the detectionalgorithm and the pipeline on a set of engineering data (taken at 10hz in steadof 30hz). no events were found within the engineering data, which is consistentwith the small size of the data set and the theoretical models. meanwhile, witha total of ~ 22 star-hours video mode data (|\beta| &lt; 10^{\circ}), we are ableto set an upper limit of n(&gt;0.5 km) ~ 2.47x10^10 deg^-2 at 95% confidencelimit.

1008.2674	ultra-bright optical transients are linked with type ic supernovae	recent searches by unbiased, wide-field surveys have uncovered a group ofextremely luminous optical transients. the initial discoveries of sn 2005ap bythe texas supernova search and scp-06f6 in a deep hubble pencil beam surveywere followed by the palomar transient factory confirmation of host redshiftsfor other similar transients. the transients share the common properties ofhigh optical luminosities (peak magnitudes ~ -21 to -23), blue colors, and alack of h or he spectral features. the physical mechanism that produces theluminosity is uncertain, with suggestions ranging from jet-driven explosion topulsational pair-instability. here we report the most detailed photometric andspectral coverage of an ultra-bright transient (sn 2010gx) detected in thepan-starrs 1 sky survey. in common with other transients in this family,early-time spectra show a blue continuum, and prominent broad absorption linesof o ii. however, about 25d after discovery, the spectra developed type icsupernova features, showing the characteristic broad fe ii and si ii absorptionlines. detailed, post-maximum follow-up may show that all sn 2005ap andscp-06f6 type transients are linked to supernovae ic. this poses problems inunderstanding the physics of the explosions: there is no indication fromlate-time photometry that the luminosity is powered by 56ni, the broadlightcurves suggest very large ejected masses, and the slow spectral evolutionis quite different from typical ic timescales. the nature of the progenitorstars and the origin of the luminosity are intriguing and open questions.

1107.3552	pan-starrs1 discovery of two ultra-luminous supernovae at z ~ 0.9	we present the discovery of two ultra-luminous supernovae (sne) at z ~ 0.9with the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey. these sne, ps1-10ky and ps1-10awh, areamongst the most luminous sne ever discovered, comparable to the unusualtransients sn 2005ap and scp 06f6. like sn 2005ap and scp 06f6, they showcharacteristic high luminosities (m_bol ~ -22.5 mag), blue spectra with a fewbroad absorption lines, and no evidence for h or he. we have constructed a fullmulti-color light curve sensitive to the peak of the spectral energydistribution in the rest-frame ultraviolet, and we have obtained time-seriesspectroscopy for these sne. given the similarities between the sne, we combinetheir light curves to estimate a total radiated energy over the course ofexplosion of (0.9-1.4) x 10^51 erg. we find photospheric velocities of12,000-19,000 km/s with no evidence for deceleration measured across ~3rest-frame weeks around light-curve peak, consistent with the expansion of anoptically-thick massive shell of material. we show that, consistent withfindings for other ultra-luminous sne in this class, radioactive decay is notsufficient to power ps1-10ky, and we discuss two plausible origins for theseevents: the initial spin-down of a newborn magnetar in a core-collapse sn, orsn shock breakout from the dense circumstellar wind surrounding a wolf-rayetstar.

1303.1531	ps1-10bzj: a fast, hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova in a metal poor  host galaxy	we present observations and analysis of ps1-10bzj, a superluminous supernova(slsn) discovered in the pan-starrs medium deep survey at a redshift z = 0.650.spectroscopically, ps1-10bzj is similar to the hydrogen-poor slsne 2005ap andscp 06f6, though with a steeper rise and lower peak luminosity (m_bol = -21.4mag) than previous events. we construct a bolometric light curve, and show thatwhile ps1-10bzj's energetics were less extreme than previous events, itsluminosity still cannot be explained by radioactive nickel decay alone. weexplore both a magnetar spin-down and circumstellar interaction scenario andfind that either can fit the data. ps1-10bzj is located in the extended chandradeep field south and the host galaxy is imaged in a number of surveys,including with the hubble space telescope. the host is a compact dwarf galaxy(m_b ~ -18 mag, diameter &lt; 800 pc), with a low stellar mass (m_* ~ 2.4 * 10^7m_sun), young stellar population (\tau_* ~ 5 myr), and a star formation rate of~ 2-3 m_sun/yr. the specific star formation rate is the highest seen in a slsnhost so far (~ 100 gyr^{-1}). we detect the [o iii]\lambda 4363 line, and finda low metallicity: 12+(o/h) = 7.8 +/- 0.2 (~ 0.1 z_sun). together, thisindicates that at least some of the progenitors of slsne come from young,low-metallicity populations.

1303.1818	ps1-12sk is a peculiar supernova from a he-rich progenitor system in a  brightest cluster galaxy environment	we report on our discovery and observations of the pan-starrs1 supernova (sn)ps1-12sk, a transient with properties that indicate atypical star formation inits host galaxy cluster or pose a challenge to popular progenitor system modelsfor this class of explosion. the optical spectra of ps1-12sk classify it as atype ibn sn (c.f. sn 2006jc), dominated by intermediate-width (3x10^3 km/s) andtime variable he i emission. our multi-wavelength monitoring establishes therise time dt = 9-23 days and shows an nuv-nir sed with temperature &gt; 17x10^3 kand a peak rise magnitude of mz = -18.9 mag. sn ibn spectroscopic propertiesare commonly interpreted as the signature of a massive star (17 - 100 m_sun)explosion within a he-enriched circumstellar medium. however, unlike previoustype ibn supernovae, ps1-12sk is associated with an elliptical brightestcluster galaxy, cgcg 208-042 (z = 0.054) in cluster rxc j0844.9+4258. theexpected probability of an event like ps1-12sk in such environments is lowgiven the measured infrequency of core-collapse sne in red sequence galaxiescompounded by the low volumetric rate of sn ibn. furthermore, we find noevidence of star formation at the explosion site to sensitive limits (sigmahalpha &lt; 2x10^-3 m_sun/yr/kpc^2). we therefore discuss white dwarf binarysystems as a possible progenitor channel for sne ibn. we conclude that ps1-12skrepresents either a fortuitous and statistically unlikely discovery, evidencefor a top-heavy imf in galaxy cluster cooling flow filaments, or the first cluesuggesting an alternate progenitor channel for type ibn sne.

1304.3320	super luminous ic supernovae: catching a magnetar by the tail	we report extensive observational data for five of the lowest redshiftsuper-luminous type ic supernovae (sl-sne ic) discovered to date, namelyptf10hgi, sn2011ke, ptf11rks, sn2011kf and sn2012il. photometric imaging of thetransients at +50 to +230 days after peak combined with host galaxy subtractionreveals a luminous tail phase for four of these sl-sne. a high resolution,optical and near infrared spectrum from xshooter provides detection of a broadhe i $\lambda$10830 emission line in the spectrum (+50d) of sn2012il, revealingthat at least some sl-sne ic are not completely helium free. at first sight,the tail luminosity decline rates that we measure are consistent with theradioactive decay of \co, and would require 1-4m of \ni to produce theluminosity. these \ni masses cannot be made consistent with the short diffusiontimes at peak, and indeed are insufficient to power the peak luminosity. weinstead favour energy deposition by newborn magnetars as the power source forthese objects. a semi-analytical diffusion model with energy input from thespin-down of a magnetar reproduces the extensive lightcurve data well. themodel predictions of ejecta velocities and temperatures which are required arein reasonable agreement with those determined from our observations. we derivemagnetar energies of $0.4\lesssim e$($10^{51}$erg) $\lesssim6.9$ and ejectamasses of $2.3\lesssim m_{ej}$(\m) $\lesssim 8.6$. the sample of five sl-sne icpresented here, combined with sn 2010gx - the best sampled sl-sne ic so far -point toward an explosion driven by a magnetar as a viable explanation for allsl-sne ic.

1307.5324	a search for fast optical transients in the pan-starrs1 medium-deep  survey: m dwarf flares, asteroids, limits on extragalactic rates, and  implications for lsst	[abridged] we present a search for fast optical transients (~0.5 hr-1 day)using repeated observations of the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey (ps1/mds)fields. our search takes advantage of the consecutive g/r-band observations(16.5 min in each filter), by requiring detections in both bands, withnon-detections on preceding and subsequent nights. we identify 19 transientsbrighter than 22.5 ab mag (s/n&gt;10). of these, 11 events exhibit quiescentcounterparts in the deep ps1/mds templates that we identify as m4-m9 dwarfs.the remaining 8 transients exhibit a range of properties indicative ofmain-belt asteroids near the stationary point of their orbits. withidentifications for all 19 transients, we place an upper limit ofr_fot(0.5hr)&lt;0.12 deg^-2 d^-1 (95% confidence level) on the sky-projected rateof extragalactic fast transients at &lt;22.5 mag, a factor of 30-50 times lowerthan previous limits; the limit for a timescale of ~day is r_fot&lt;2.4e-3 deg^-2d^-1. to convert these sky-projected rates to volumetric rates, we explore theexpected peak luminosities of fast optical transients powered by variousmechanisms, and find that non-relativistic events are limited to m~-10 mag(m~-14 mag) for a timescale of ~0.5 hr (~day), while relativistic sources(e.g., grbs, magnetar-powered transients) can reach much larger luminosities.the resulting volumetric rates are &lt;13 (m~-10 mag), &lt;0.05 (m~-14 mag) and &lt;1e-6mpc^-3 yr^-1 (m~-24 mag), significantly above the nova, supernova, and grbrates, respectively, indicating that much larger surveys are required toprovide meaningful constraints. motivated by the results of our search wediscuss strategies for identifying fast optical transients in the lsst mainsurvey, and reach the optimistic conclusion that the veil of foregroundcontaminants can be lifted with the survey data, without the need for expensivefollow-up observations.

1307.8124	towards a complete stellar mass function of the hyades. i. pan-starrs1  optical observations of the low-mass stellar content	the hyades cluster is an ideal target to study the dynamical evolution of astar cluster over the entire mass range due to its intermediate age andproximity to the sun. we wanted to extend the hyades mass function towardslower masses down to 0.1 msol and to use the full three-dimensional spatialinformation to characterize the dynamical evolution of the cluster. weperformed a kinematic and photometric selection using the ppmxl and pan-starrs1sky surveys, to search for cluster members up to 30 pc from the cluster centre.we determined our detection efficiency and field star contamination rate toderive the cluster luminosity and mass functions down to masses of 0.1 msol.the thorough astrometric and photometric constraints minimized thecontamination. a minimum spanning tree algorithm was used to quantify the masssegregation. we discovered 43 new hyades member candidates with velocityperpendicular to the hyades motion up to 2 km/s. they have mass estimatesbetween 0.43 and 0.09 msol, for a total mass of 10 msol. this doubles thenumber of hyades candidates with masses smaller than 0.15 msol. we provide anadditional list of 11 possible candidates with velocity perpendicular to thehyades motion up to 4 km/s. the cluster is significantly mass segregated. theextension of the mass function towards lower masses provided an even clearersignature than estimated in the past. we also identified as likely hyadesmember an l0 dwarf previously assumed to be a field dwarf. finally we questionthe membership of a number of previously published candidates, including al2.5-type dwarf.

1309.0503	a search for l/t transition dwarfs with pan-starrs1 and wise: discovery  of seven nearby objects including two candidate spectroscopic variables	we present initial results from a wide-field (30,000 deg^2) search for l/ttransition brown dwarfs within 25 pc using the pan-starrs1 and wise surveys.previous large-area searches have been incomplete for l/t transition dwarfs,because these objects are faint in optical bands and have near-infrared colorsthat are difficult to distinguish from background stars. to overcome theseobstacles, we have cross-matched the pan-starrs1 (optical) and wise (mid-ir)catalogs to produce a unique multi-wavelength database for finding ultracooldwarfs. as part of our initial discoveries, we have identified seven browndwarfs in the l/t transition within 9-15 pc of the sun. the l9.5 dwarf psoj140.2308+45.6487 and the t1.5 dwarf pso j307.6784+07.8263 (both independentlydiscovered by mace et al. 2013) show possible spectroscopic variability at they- and j-bands. two more objects in our sample show evidence of photometricj-band variability, and two others are candidate unresolved binaries based ontheir spectra. we expect our full search to yield a well-defined,volume-limited sample of l/t transition dwarfs that will include many newtargets for study of this complex regime. pso j307.6784+07.8263 in particularmay be an excellent candidate for in-depth study of variability, given itsbrightness (j = 14.2 mag) and proximity (11 pc).

1309.3009	the uv-bright, slowly declining transient ps1-11af as a partial tidal  disruption event	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of the long-lived and blue transientps1-11af, which was also detected by galex with coordinated observations in thenear-ultraviolet (nuv) band. ps1-11af is associated with the nucleus of anearly-type galaxy at redshift z=0.4046 that exhibits no evidence for starformation or agn activity. four epochs of spectroscopy reveal a pair oftransient broad absorption features in the uv on otherwise featureless spectra.despite the superficial similarity of these features to p-cygni absorptions ofsupernovae (sne), we conclude that ps1-11af is not consistent with theproperties of known types of sne. blackbody fits to the spectral energydistribution are inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a sn, andthe velocities of the absorption features are too high to represent material inhomologous expansion near a sn photosphere. however, the constant blue colorsand slow evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous optically-selectedtidal disruption events (tdes). the shape of the optical light curve isconsistent with models for tdes, but the minimum accreted mass necessary topower the observed luminosity is only ~0.002m_sun, which points to a partialdisruption model. a full disruption model predicts higher bolometricluminosities, which would require most of the radiation to be emitted in aseparate component at high energies where we lack observations. in addition,the observed temperature is lower than that predicted by pure accretion diskmodels for tdes and requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature.three deep non-detections in the radio with the vla over the first two yearsafter the event set strict limits on the production of any relativistic outflowcomparable to swift j1644+57, even if off-axis.

1310.0457	the extremely red, young l dwarf pso j318-22: a free-floating  planetary-mass analog to directly imaged young gas-giant planets	we have used pan-starrs1 to discover an extremely red late-l dwarf, which has(j-k)_mko = 2.84 and (j-k)_2mass = 2.78, making it the reddest known fielddwarf and second only to 2mass j1207-39b among substellar companions. near-irspectroscopy shows a spectral type of l7 and reveals a triangular h-bandcontinuum and weak alkali (k i and na i) lines, hallmarks of low surfacegravity. near-ir astrometry from the hawaii infrared parallax program gives adistance of 24.6+/-1.4 pc and indicates a much fainter j-band absolutemagnitude than field l dwarfs. the position and kinematics of pso j318-22 pointto membership in the beta pictoris moving group. evolutionary models give atemperature of 1160 (-40,+30) k and a mass of 6.5 (-1.0, +1.3) mjup, making psoj318-22 one of the lowest mass free-floating objects in the solar neighborhood.this object adds to the growing list of low-gravity field l dwarfs and is thefirst to be strongly deficient in methane relative to its estimatedtemperature. comparing their spectra suggests that young l dwarfs with similarages and temperatures can have different spectral signatures of youth. for thetwo objects with well constrained ages (pso j318-22 and 2mass j0355+11), wefind their temperatures are ~400 k cooler than field objects of similarspectral type but their luminosities are comparable, i.e., these young l dwarfsare very red and unusually cool but not "underluminous." altogether, psoj318-22 is the first free-floating object with the colors, magnitudes,spectrum, luminosity, and mass that overlap the young dusty planets around hr8799 and 2mass j1207-39.

1310.3824	systematic uncertainties associated with the cosmological analysis of  the first pan-starrs1 type ia supernova sample	we probe the systematic uncertainties from 113 type ia supernovae (snia) inthe pan-starrs1 (ps1) sample along with 197 sn ia from a combination oflow-redshift surveys. the companion paper by rest et al. (2013) describes thephotometric measurements and cosmological inferences from the ps1 sample. thelargest systematic uncertainty stems from the photometric calibration of theps1 and low-z samples. we increase the sample of observed calspec standardsfrom 7 to 10 used to define the ps1 calibration system. the ps1 and sdss-iicalibration systems are compared and discrepancies up to ~0.02 mag arerecovered. we find uncertainties in the proper way to treat intrinsic colorsand reddening produce differences in the recovered value of w up to 3%. weestimate masses of host galaxies of ps1 supernovae and detect an insignificantdifference in distance residuals of the full sample of 0.037\pm0.031 mag forhost galaxies with high and low masses. assuming flatness in our analysis ofonly sne measurements, we find $w = {-1.120^{+0.360}_{-0.206}\textrm{(stat)}^{+0.269}_{-0.291}\textrm{(sys)}}$. with additional constraints from bao,cmb(planck) and h0 measurements, we find $w = -1.166^{+0.072}_{-0.069}$ and$\omega_m=0.280^{+0.013}_{-0.012}$ (statistical and systematic errors added inquadrature). significance of the inconsistency with $w=-1$ depends on whetherwe use planck or wmap measurements of the cmb:$w_{\textrm{bao+h0+sn+wmap}}=-1.124^{+0.083}_{-0.065}$.

1310.3828	cosmological constraints from measurements of type ia supernovae  discovered during the first 1.5 years of the pan-starrs1 survey	we present griz light curves of 146 spectroscopically confirmed type iasupernovae ($0.03 &lt; z &lt;0.65$) discovered during the first 1.5 years of thepan-starrs1 medium deep survey. the pan-starrs1 natural photometric system isdetermined by a combination of on-site measurements of the instrument responsefunction and observations of spectrophotometric standard stars. we find thatthe systematic uncertainties in the photometric system are currently 1.2\%without accounting for the uncertainty in the hst calspec definition of the absystem. a hubble diagram is constructed with a subset of 113 out of 146 sne iathat pass our light curve quality cuts. the cosmological fit to 310 sne ia (113ps1 sne ia + 222 light curves from 197 low-z sne ia), using only sne andassuming a constant dark energy equation of state and flatness, yields$w=-1.120^{+0.360}_{-0.206}\textrm{(stat)} ^{+0.269}_{-0.291}\textrm{(sys)}$.when combined with bao+cmb(planck)+$h_0$, the analysis yields $\omega_{\rmm}=0.280^{+0.013}_{-0.012}$ and $w=-1.166^{+0.072}_{-0.069}$ including allidentified systematics (see also scolnic et al. 2014). the value of $w$ isinconsistent with the cosmological constant value of $-1$ at the 2.3$\sigma$level. tension endures after removing either the bao or the $h_0$ constraint,though it is strongest when including the $h_0$ constraint. if we include wmap9cmb constraints instead of those from planck, we find$w=-1.124^{+0.083}_{-0.065}$, which diminishes the discord to $&lt;2\sigma$. wecannot conclude whether the tension with flat $\lambda$cdm is a feature of darkenergy, new physics, or a combination of chance and systematic errors. the fullpan-starrs1 supernova sample with $\sim\!\!$3 times as many sne should providemore conclusive results.

1310.4417	the superluminous supernova ps1-11ap: bridging the gap between low and  high redshift	we present optical photometric and spectroscopic coverage of thesuperluminous supernova (slsn) ps1-11ap, discovered with the pan-starrs1 mediumdeep survey at z = 0.524. this intrinsically blue transient rose slowly toreach a peak magnitude of m_u = -21.4 mag and bolometric luminosity of 8 x10^43 ergs^-1 before settling onto a relatively shallow gradient of decline.the observed decline is significantly slower than those of the superluminoustype ic sne which have been the focus of much recent attention. spectroscopicsimilarities with the lower redshift sn2007bi and a decline rate similar to56co decay timescale initially indicated that this transient could be acandidate for a pair instability supernova (pisn) explosion. overall thetransient appears quite similar to sn2007bi and the lower redshift objectptf12dam. the extensive data set, from 30 days before peak to 230 days after,allows a detailed and quantitative comparison with published models of pisnexplosions. we find that the ps1-11ap data do not match these model explosionparameters well, supporting the recent claim that these sne are not pairinstability explosions. we show that ps1-11ap has many features in common withthe faster declining superluminous ic supernovae and the lightcurve evolutioncan also be quantitatively explained by the magnetar spin down model. at aredshift of z = 0.524 the observer frame optical coverage providescomprehensive restframe uv data and allows us to compare it with thesuperluminous sne recently found at high redshifts between z = 2-4. while thesehigh-z explosions are still plausible pisn candidates, they match thephotometric evolution of ps1-11ap and hence could be counterparts to this lowerredshift transient.

1310.4446	slowly fading super-luminous supernovae that are not pair-instability  explosions	super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second attheir peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies atredshifts of 0.1-4. some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'supernovae. such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times thatof the sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. in thesestars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted toelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclearexplosions. many solar masses of 56ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to56fe via 56co, powering bright light curves. such massive progenitors areexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early universe. recently,supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years afterthe big bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the sun was observed to looklike a fading pair-instability supernova. here we report observations of twoslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times andblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. theirlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call thenature of that event into question. our early spectra closely resemble typicalfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered byradioactivity. modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses ofmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosionmechanism. the lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests thattheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of thecore-collapse rate.

1311.0026	hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae and long-duration gamma-ray  bursts have similar host galaxies	we present optical spectroscopy and optical/near-ir photometry of 31 hostgalaxies of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (slsne), including 15 eventsfrom the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey. our sample spans the redshift range0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.6 and is the first comprehensive host galaxy study of this specificsubclass of cosmic explosions. combining the multi-band photometry andemission-line measurements, we determine the luminosities, stellar masses, starformation rates and metallicities. we find that as a whole, the hosts of slsneare a low-luminosity (&lt;m_b&gt; ~ -17.3 mag), low stellar mass (&lt;m_*&gt; ~ 2 x 10^8m_sun) population, with a high median specific star formation rate (&lt;ssfr&gt; ~ 2gyr^-1). the median metallicity of our spectroscopic sample is low, 12 +log(o/h}) ~ 8.35 ~ 0.45 z_sun, although at least one host galaxy has solarmetallicity. the host galaxies of h-poor slsne are statistically distinct fromthe hosts of goods core-collapse sne (which cover a similar redshift range),but resemble the host galaxies of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) interms of stellar mass, sfr, ssfr and metallicity. this result indicates thatthe environmental causes leading to massive stars forming either slsne or lgrbsare similar, and in particular that slsne are more effectively formed in lowmetallicity environments. we speculate that the key ingredient is large coreangular momentum, leading to a rapidly-spinning magnetar in slsne and anaccreting black hole in lgrbs.

1312.4736	the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey: the role of galaxy group environment  in the star formation rate versus stellar mass relation and quiescent  fraction out to $z \sim 0.8$	using a large sample of field and group galaxies drawn from the pan-starrs1medium-deep survey, we present the specific star formation rate (ssfr) -stellar mass (m*) relation, as well as the quiescent fraction versus m*relation in different environments. we confirm that the fraction of quiescentgalaxies is strongly dependent on environment at a fixed stellar mass, but thatthe amplitude and the slope of the star-forming sequence is similar between thefield and groups: in other words, the ssfr-density relation at a fixed stellarmass is primarily driven by the change in the star-forming and quiescentfractions between different environments rather than a global suppression inthe star formation rate for the star-forming population. however, when werestrict our sample to the cluster-scale environments ($m&gt;10^{14}m_{solar}$),we find a global reduction in the ssfr of the star forming sequence of $17\%$at 4$\sigma$ confidence as opposed to its field counterpart. after removing thestellar mass dependence of the quiescent fraction seen in field galaxies, theexcess in the quiescent fraction due to the environment quenching in groups andclusters is found to increase with stellar mass. we argue that these resultsare in favor of galaxy mergers to be the primary environment quenchingmechanism operating in galaxy groups whereas strangulation is able to reproducethe observed trend in the environment quenching efficiency and stellar massrelation seen in clusters. our results also suggest that the relativeimportance between mass quenching and environment quenching depends on stellarmass -- the mass quenching plays a dominant role in producing quiescentgalaxies for more massive galaxies, while less massive galaxies are quenchedmostly through the environmental effect, with the transition mass around$1-2\times10^{10}m_{solar}$ in the group/cluster environment.

1402.1631	selecting superluminous supernovae in faint galaxies from the first year  of the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey	the pan-starrs1 (ps1) survey has obtained imaging in 5 bands (grizy_p1) over10 medium deep survey (mds) fields covering a total of 70 square degrees. thispaper describes the search for apparently hostless supernovae (sne) within thefirst year of ps1 mds data with an aim of discovering new superluminoussupernovae (slsne). a total of 249 hostless transients were discovered down toa limiting magnitude of m_ab ~ 23.5, of which 76 were classified as type iasne. there were 57 sne with complete light curves that are likely core-collapsesne (ccsne) or slsne and 12 of these have had spectra taken. of these 12hostless, non-type ia sne, 7 were slsne of type ic at redshifts between0.5-1.4. this illustrates that the discovery rate of type ic slsne can bemaximised by concentrating on hostless transients and removing normal sne ia.we present data for two new possible slsne; ps1-10pm (z = 1.206) and ps1-10ahf(z = 1.1), and estimate the rate of slsne-ic to be between 3^{+3}_{-2} *10^{-5} and 8^{+2}_{-1} * 10^{-5} of the ccsne rate within 0.3 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.4 byapplying a monte-carlo technique. the rate of slowly evolving, sn2007bi-likeexplosions is estimated as a factor of 10 lower than this range.

1403.3393	a large catalog of accurate distances to molecular clouds from ps1  photometry	distance measurements to molecular clouds are important, but are often madeseparately for each cloud of interest, employing very different different dataand techniques. we present a large, homogeneous catalog of distances tomolecular clouds, most of which are of unprecedented accuracy. we determinedistances using optical photometry of stars along lines of sight toward theseclouds, obtained from panstarrs-1. we simultaneously infer the reddenings anddistances to these stars, tracking the full probability distribution functionusing a technique presented in green et al. (2014). we fit these star-by-starmeasurements using a simple dust screen model to find the distance to eachcloud. we thus estimate the distances to almost all of the clouds in themagnani et al. (1985) catalog, as well as many other well-studied clouds,including orion, perseus, taurus, cepheus, polaris, california, and monocerosr2, avoiding only the inner galaxy. typical statistical uncertainties in thedistances are 5%, though the systematic uncertainty stemming from the qualityof our stellar models is about 10%. the resulting catalog is the largestcatalog of accurate, directly-measured distances to molecular clouds. ourdistance estimates are generally consistent with available distance estimatesfrom the literature, though in some cases the literature estimates are off by afactor of more than two.

1404.2004	towards characterization of the type iip supernova progenitor  population: a statistical sample of light curves from pan-starrs1	in recent years, wide-field sky surveys providing deep multi-band imaginghave presented a new path for indirectly characterizing the progenitorpopulations of core-collapse supernovae (sn): systematic light curve studies.we assemble a set of 76 grizy-band type iip sn light curves from pan-starrs1,obtained over a constant survey program of 4 years and classified using bothspectroscopy and machine learning-based photometric techniques. we develop andapply a new bayesian model for the full multi-band evolution of each lightcurve in the sample. we find no evidence of a sub-population of fast-decliningexplosions (historically referred to as "type iil" sne). however, we identify ahighly significant relation between the plateau phase decay rate and peakluminosity among our sne iip. these results argue in favor of a singleparameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass, predominantly controllingthe explosions of red supergiants. this relation could also be applied forsupernova cosmology, offering a standardizable candle good to an intrinsicscatter of 0.2 mag. we compare each light curve to physical models fromhydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor initial masses and otherproperties of the pan-starrs1 type iip sn sample. we show that correction ofsystematic discrepancies between modeled and observed sn iip light curveproperties and an expanded grid of progenitor properties, are needed to enablerobust progenitor inferences from multi-band light curve samples of this kind.this work will serve as a pathfinder for photometric studies of core-collapsesne to be conducted through future wide field transient searches.

1405.3668	rapidly-evolving and luminous transients from pan-starrs1	in the past decade, several rapidly-evolving transients have been discoveredwhose timescales and luminosities are not easily explained by traditionalsupernovae (sn) models. the sample size of these objects has remained smalldue, at least in part, to the challenge of detecting short timescale transientswith traditional survey cadences. here we present the results from a searchwithin the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey (ps1-mds) for rapidly-evolving andluminous transients. we identify 10 new transients with a time abovehalf-maximum of less than 12 days and -16.5 &gt; m &gt; -20 mag. this increases thenumber of known events in this region of sn phase space by roughly a factor ofthree. the median redshift of the ps1-mds sample is z=0.275 and they allexploded in star forming galaxies. in general, the transients possess fasterrise than decline timescale and blue colors at maximum light (g - r &lt; -0.2).best fit blackbodies reveal photospheric temperatures/radii that expand/coolwith time and explosion spectra taken near maximum light are dominated by ablue continuum, consistent with a hot, optically thick, ejecta. we find itdifficult to reconcile the short timescale, high peak luminosity (l &gt; 10^43erg/s), and lack of uv line blanketing observed in many of these transientswith an explosion powered mainly by the radioactive decay of ni-56. rather, wefind that many are consistent with either (1) cooling envelope emission fromthe explosion of a star with a low-mass extended envelope which ejected verylittle (&lt;0.03 m_sun) radioactive material, or (2) a shock breakout within adense, optically thick, wind surrounding the progenitor star. after calculatingthe detection efficiency for objects with rapid timescales in the ps1-mds wefind a volumetric rate of 4800 - 8000 events/yr/gpc^3 (4-7% of thecore-collapse sn rate at z=0.2).

1408.6807	observational constraints on the catastrophic disruption rate of small  main belt asteroids	we have calculated 90% confidence limits on the steady-state rate ofcatastrophic disruptions of main belt asteroids in terms of the absolutemagnitude at which one catastrophic disruption occurs per year (hcl) as afunction of the post-disruption increase in brightness (delta m) and subsequentbrightness decay rate (tau). the confidence limits were calculated using thebrightest unknown main belt asteroid (v = 18.5) detected with the pan-starrs1(pan-starrs1) telescope. we measured the pan-starrs1's catastrophic disruptiondetection efficiency over a 453-day interval using the pan-starrs moving objectprocessing system (mops) and a simple model for the catastrophic disruptionevent's photometric behavior in a small aperture centered on the catastrophicdisruption event. our simplistic catastrophic disruption model suggests thatdelta m = 20 mag and 0.01 mag d-1 &lt; tau &lt; 0.1 mag d-1 which would imply that h0= 28 -- strongly inconsistent with h0,b2005 = 23.26 +/- 0.02 predicted bybottke et al. (2005) using purely collisional models. we postulate that thesolution to the discrepancy is that &gt; 99% of main belt catastrophic disruptionsin the size range to which this study was sensitive (100 m) are notimpact-generated, but are instead due to fainter rotational breakups, of whichthe recent discoveries of disrupted asteroids p/2013 p5 and p/2013 r3 areprobable examples. we estimate that current and upcoming asteroid surveys maydiscover up to 10 catastrophic disruptions/year brighter than v = 18.5.

1411.1060	zooming in on the progenitors of superluminous supernovae with the hst	we present hubble space telescope (hst) rest-frame ultraviolet imaging of thehost galaxies of 16 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (slsne), including11 events from the pan-starrs medium deep survey. taking advantage of thesuperb angular resolution of hst, we characterize the galaxies' morphologicalproperties, sizes and star formation rate (sfr) densities. we determine thesupernova (sn) locations within the host galaxies through precise astrometricmatching, and measure physical and host-normalized offsets, as well as the snpositions within the cumulative distribution of uv light pixel brightness. wefind that the host galaxies of h-poor slsne are irregular, compact dwarfgalaxies, with a median half-light radius of just 0.9 kpc. the uv-derived sfrdensities are high (&lt;sigma_sfr&gt; ~ 0.1 m_sun/yr/kpc^2), suggesting that slsneform in overdense environments. their locations trace the uv light of theirhost galaxies, with a distribution intermediate between that of long-durationgamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) (which are strongly clustered on the brightest regionsof their hosts) and a uniform distribution (characteristic of normalcore-collapse sne), though cannot be statistically distinguished from eitherwith the current sample size. taken together, this strengthens the picture thatslsn progenitors require different conditions than those of ordinarycore-collapse sne to form, and that they explode in broadly similar galaxies asdo lgrbs. if the tendency for slsne to be less clustered on the brightestregions than are lgrbs is confirmed by a larger sample, this would indicate adifferent, potentially lower-mass progenitor for slsne than lrgbs.

1501.01314	selection of burst-like transients and stochastic variables using  multi-band image differencing in the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey	we present a novel method for the light-curve characterization of pan-starrs1medium deep survey (ps1 mds) extragalactic sources into stochastic variables(sv) and burst-like (bl) transients, using multi-band image-differencingtime-series data. we select detections in difference images associated withgalaxy hosts using a star/galaxy catalog extracted from the deep ps1 mdsstacked images, and adopt a maximum a posteriori formulation to model theirdifference-flux time-series in four pan-starrs1 photometric bands g,r,i, and z.we use three deterministic light-curve models to fit burst-like transients andone stochastic light curve model, the ornstein-uhlenbeck process, in order tofit variability that is characteristic of active galactic nuclei (agn). weassess the quality of fit of the models band-wise source-wise, using theirestimated leave-out-one cross-validation likelihoods and corrected akaikeinformation criteria. we then apply a k-means clustering algorithm on thesestatistics, to determine the source classification in each band. the finalsource classification is derived as a combination of the individual filterclassifications. we use our clustering method to characterize 4361extragalactic image difference detected sources in the first 2.5 years of theps1 mds, into 1529 bl, and 2262 sv, with a purity of 95.00% for agn, and 90.97%for sn based on our verification sets. we combine our light-curveclassifications with their nuclear or off-nuclear host galaxy offsets, todefine a robust photometric sample of 1233 active galactic nuclei and 812supernovae. we use these samples to identify simple photometric priors thatwould enable their real-time identification in future wide-field synopticsurveys.

1501.05470	machine learning for transient discovery in pan-starrs1 difference  imaging	efficient identification and follow-up of astronomical transients is hinderedby the need for humans to manually select promising candidates from datastreams that contain many false positives. these artefacts arise in thedifference images that are produced by most major ground-based time domainsurveys with large format ccd cameras. this dependence on humans to rejectbogus detections is unsustainable for next generation all-sky surveys andsignificant effort is now being invested to solve the problem computationally.in this paper we explore a simple machine learning approach to real-bogusclassification by constructing a training set from the image data of ~32000real astrophysical transients and bogus detections from the pan-starrs1 mediumdeep survey. we derive our feature representation from the pixel intensityvalues of a 20x20 pixel stamp around the centre of the candidates. this differsfrom previous work in that it works directly on the pixels rather thancatalogued domain knowledge for feature design or selection. three machinelearning algorithms are trained (artificial neural networks, support vectormachines and random forests) and their performances are tested on a held-outsubset of 25% of the training data. we find the best results from the randomforest classifier and demonstrate that by accepting a false positive rate of1%, the classifier initially suggests a missed detection rate of around 10%.however we also find that a combination of bright star variability, nucleartransients and uncertainty in human labelling means that our best estimate ofthe missed detection rate is approximately 6%.

1502.06964	galex detection of shock breakout in type ii-p supernova ps1-13arp:  implications for the progenitor star wind	we present the galex detection of a uv burst at the time of explosion of anoptically normal type ii-p supernova (ps1-13arp) from the pan-starrs1 survey atz=0.1665. the temperature and luminosity of the uv burst match the theoreticalpredictions for shock breakout in a red supergiant, but with a duration afactor of ~50 longer than expected. we compare the $nuv$ light curve ofps1-13arp to previous galex detections of type iip sne, and find cleardistinctions that indicate that the uv emission is powered by shock breakout,and not by the subsequent cooling envelope emission previously detected inthese systems. we interpret the ~ 1 d duration of the uv signal with a shockbreakout in the wind of a red supergiant with a pre-explosion mass-loss rate of~ 10^-3 msun yr^-1. this mass-loss rate is enough to prolong the duration ofthe shock breakout signal, but not enough to produce an excess in the opticalplateau light curve or narrow emission lines powered by circumstellarinteraction. this detection of non-standard, potentially episodic highmass-loss in a rsg sn progenitor has favorable consequences for the prospectsof future wide-field uv surveys to detect shock breakout directly in thesesystems, and provide a sensitive probe of the pre-explosion conditions of snprogenitors.

1503.04214	constraining the radio-loud fraction of quasars at z&gt;5.5	radio-loud active galactic nuclei at z~2-4 are typically located in denseenvironments and their host galaxies are among the most massive systems atthose redshifts, providing key insights for galaxy evolution. findingradio-loud quasars at the highest accessible redshifts (z~6) is important tostudy their properties and environments at even earlier cosmic time. they wouldalso serve as background sources for radio surveys intended to study theintergalactic medium beyond the epoch of reionization in hi 21 cm absorption.currently, only five radio-loud ($r=f_{\nu,5{\rm ghz}}/f_{\nu,4400\aa}&gt;10$)quasars are known at z~6. in this paper we search for 5.5 &lt; z &lt; 7.2 quasars bycross-matching the optical pan-starrs1 and radio first surveys. the radioinformation allows identification of quasars missed by typical color-basedselections. while we find no good 6.4 &lt; z &lt;7.2 quasar candidates at thesensitivities of these surveys, we discover two new radio-loud quasars at z~6.furthermore, we identify two additional z~6 radio-loud quasars which were notpreviously known to be radio-loud, nearly doubling the current z~6 sample. weshow the importance of having infrared photometry for z&gt;5.5 quasars to robustlyclassify them as radio-quiet or radio-loud. based on this, we reclassify thequasar j0203+0012 (z=5.72), previously considered radio-loud, to beradio-quiet. using the available data in the literature, we constrain theradio-loud fraction of quasars at z~6, using the kaplan--meier estimator, to be$8.1^{+5.0}_{-3.2}\%$. this result is consistent with there being no evolutionof the radio-loud fraction with redshift, in contrast to what has beensuggested by some studies at lower redshifts.

1510.01739	pan-starrs1 variability of xmm-cosmos agn. i. impact on photometric  redshifts	[abbreviated] upcoming large area sky surveys like euclid and erositacrucially depend on accurate photometric redshifts (photo-z). theidentification of variable sources, such as agns, and the achievable redshiftaccuracy for varying objects are important in view of the science goals of theeuclid and erosita missions. we probe agn optical variability for a largesample of x-ray-selected agns in the xmm-cosmos field, using the light curvesprovided by the pan-starrs1 (ps1) 3pi and mdf04 surveys. utilizing twodifferent variability parameters, we defined a sample of varying agns for everyps1 band. we investigated the influence of variability on the calculation ofphoto-z by applying three different input photometry sets for our fittingprocedure. for each of the five ps1 bands, we chose either the epochsminimizing the interval in observing time, the median magnitude values, orrandomly drawn light curve points to compute the redshift. in addition, wederived photo-z using ps1 photometry extended by galex/irac bands. we find thatthe photometry produced by the 3pi survey is sufficient to reliably detectvariable sources provided that the fractional variability amplitude is at least3%. considering the photo-z of variable agns, we observe that minimizing thetime spacing of the chosen points yields superior photo-z in terms of thepercentage of outliers (33%) and accuracy (0.07), outperforming the other twoapproaches. drawing random points from the light curve gives rise to typically57% of outliers and an accuracy of 0.4. adding galex/irac bands for theredshift determination weakens the influence of variability. although theredshift quality generally improves when adding these bands, we still obtainnot less than 26% of outliers and an accuracy of 0.05 at best, thereforevariable sources should receive a flag stating that their photo-z may be lowquality.

0807.3070	core-collapse supernovae in low-metallicity environments and future  all-sky transient surveys	aims: massive stars in low-metallicity environments may produce exoticexplosions such as long-duration gamma-ray bursts and pair-instabilitysupernovae when they die as core-collapse supernovae (ccsne). here we determinethe feasibility of searching for these ccsne in metal-poor dwarf galaxies usingvarious survey strategies. methods: we determine oxygen abundances andstar-formation rates for all spectroscopically typed star-forming galaxies inthe sloan digital sky survey, data release 5, within z = 0.04. we then estimatethe ccsn rates for sub-samples of galaxies with differing upper-metallicitylimits. using monte-carlo simulations we then predict the fraction of theseccsne that we can expect to detect using different survey strategies. results:using a single 2m telescope (with a standard ccd camera) search we predict adetection rate of ~1.3 ccsne/yr in galaxies with metallicities below 12 +log(o/h) &lt; 8.2 which are within a volume that will allow detailed follow-upwith 4m and 8m telescopes (z = 0.04). with a network of seven 2m telescopes weestimate ~9.3 ccsne/yr could be found, although this would require more than1,000 hrs of telescope time allocated to the network. within the same radialdistance, a volume-limited search in the future pan-starrs ps1 all-sky surveyshould uncover 12.5 ccsne/yr in low-metallicity galaxies. over a period of afew years this would allow a detailed comparison of their properties. we thenextend our calculations to determine the total numbers of ccsne that canpotentially be found in magnitude-limited surveys with ps1 (24,000/yr, within z&lt; 0.6), ps4 (69,000/yr, within z &lt; 0.8) and lsst (160,000/yr, within z &lt; 0.9)surveys.

astro-ph;0508681	hubble space telescope observations of nine high-redshift essence  supernovae	we present broad-band light curves of nine supernovae ranging in redshiftfrom 0.5 to 0.8. the supernovae were discovered as part of the essence project,and the light curves are a combination of cerro tololo 4-m and hubble spacetelescope (hst) photometry. on the basis of spectra and/or light-curve fitting,eight of these objects are definitely type ia supernovae, while theclassification of one is problematic. the essence project is a five-yearendeavor to discover about 200 high-redshift type ia supernovae, with the goalof tightly constraining the time average of the equation-of-state parameter [w= p/(rho c^2)] of the "dark energy." to help minimize our systematic errors,all of our ground-based photometry is obtained with the same telescope andinstrument. in 2003 the highest-redshift subset of essence supernovae wasselected for detailed study with hst. here we present the first photometricresults of the survey. we find that all but one of the essence sne have slowlydeclining light curves, and the sample is not representative of thelow-redshift set of essence type ia supernovae. this is unlikely to be a signof evolution in the population. we attribute the decline-rate distribution ofhst events to a selection bias at the high-redshift edge of our sample and findthat such a bias will infect other magnitude-limited sn ia searches unlessappropriate precautions are taken.

astro-ph;9912181	a new strategy for deep wide-field high resolution optical imaging	we propose a new strategy for obtaining enhanced resolution (fwhm = 0.12arcsec) deep optical images over a wide field of view. as is well known, thistype of image quality can be obtained in principle simply by fast guiding on asmall (d = 1.5m) telescope at a good site, but only for target objects whichlie within a limited angular distance of a suitably bright guide star. for highaltitude turbulence this 'isokinetic angle' is approximately 1 arcminute. witha 1 degree field say one would need to track and correct the motions ofthousands of isokinetic patches, yet there are typically too few sufficientlybright guide stars to provide the necessary guiding information. our proposedsolution to these problems has two novel features. the first is to useorthogonal transfer charge-coupled device (otccd) technology to effectivelyimplement a wide field 'rubber focal plane' detector composed of an array ofcells which can be guided independently. the second is to combine measuredmotions of a set of guide stars made with an array of telescopes to provide theextra information needed to fully determine the deflection field. we discussthe performance, feasibility and design constraints on a system which wouldprovide the collecting area equivalent to a single 9m telescope, a 1 degreesquare field and 0.12 arcsec fwhm image quality.

0811.4424	spectroscopy of high-redshift supernovae from the essence project: the  first four years	we present the results of spectroscopic observations from the essencehigh-redshift supernova (sn) survey during its first four years of operation.this sample includes spectra of all sne ia whose light curves were presented bymiknaitis et al. (2007) and used in the cosmological analyses of davis et al.(2007) and wood-vasey et al. (2007). the sample represents 273 hours ofspectroscopic observations with 6.5 - 10-m-class telescopes of objects detectedand selected for spectroscopy by the essence team. we present 174 spectra of156 objects. combining this sample with that of matheson et al. (2005), we havea total sample of 329 spectra of 274 objects. from this, we are able tospectroscopically classify 118 type ia sne. as the survey has matured, theefficiency of classifying sne ia has remained constant while we have observedboth higher-redshift sne ia and sne ia farther from maximum brightness.examining the subsample of sne ia with host-galaxy redshifts shows thatredshifts derived from only the sn ia spectra are consistent with redshiftsfound from host-galaxy spectra. moreover, the phases derived from only the snia spectra are consistent with those derived from light-curve fits. bycomparing our spectra to local templates, we find that the rate of objectssimilar to the overluminous sn 1991t and the underluminous sn 1991bg in oursample are consistent with that of the local sample. we do note, however, thatwe detect no object spectroscopically or photometrically similar to sn 1991bg.although systematic effects could reduce the high-redshift rate we expect basedon the low-redshift surveys, it is possible that sn 1991bg-like sne ia are lessprevalent at high redshift.
