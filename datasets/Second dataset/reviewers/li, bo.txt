1001.0819	topological transitions in carbon nanotube networks via nanoscale  confinement	efforts aimed at large-scale integration of nanoelectronic devices thatexploit the superior electronic and mechanical properties of single-walledcarbon nanotubes (swcnts) remain limited by the difficulties associated withmanipulation and packaging of individual swnts. alternative approaches based onultra-thin carbon nanotube networks (cnns) have enjoyed success of late withthe realization of several scalable device applications. however, precisecontrol over the network electronic transport is challenging due to i) an oftenuncontrollable interplay between network coverage and its topology and ii) theinherent electrical heterogeneity of the constituent swnts. in this letter, weuse template-assisted fluidic assembly of swcnt networks to explore the effectof geometric confinement on the network topology. heterogeneous swcnt networksdip-coated onto sub-micron wide ultra-thin polymer channels exhibit a topologythat becomes increasingly aligned with decreasing channel width and thickness.experimental scale coarse-grained computations of interacting swcnts show thatthe effect is a reflection of an aligned topology that is no longer dependenton the network density, which in turn emerges as a robust knob that can inducesemiconductor-to-metallic transitions in the network response. our studydemonstrates the effectiveness of directed assembly on channels with varyingdegrees of confinement as a simple tool to tailor the conductance of theotherwise heterogeneous network, opening up the possibility of robustlarge-scale cnn-based devices.

1001.0958	effectively integrating information content and structural relationship  to improve the go-based similarity measure between proteins	the gene ontology (go) provides a knowledge base to effectively describeproteins. however, measuring similarity between proteins based on go remains achallenge. in this paper, we propose a new similarity measure, informationcoefficient similarity measure (simic), to effectively integrate both theinformation content (ic) of go terms and the structural information of gohierarchy to determine the similarity between proteins. testing on yeastproteins, our results show that simic efficiently addresses the shallowannotation issue in go, thus improves the correlations between go similaritiesof yeast proteins and their expression similarities as well as between gosimilarities of yeast proteins and their sequence similarities. furthermore, wedemonstrate that the proposed simic is superior in predicting yeast proteininteractions. we predict 20484 yeast protein-protein interactions (ppis)between 2462 proteins based on the high simic values of biological process (bp)and cellular component (cc). examining the 214 mips complexes in our predictedppis shows that all members of 159 mips complexes can be found in our ppipredictions, which is more than those (120/214) found in ppis predicted byrelative specificity similarity (rss). integrating ic and structuralinformation of go hierarchy can improve the effectiveness of the semanticsimilarity measure of go terms. the new simic can effectively correct theeffect of shallow annotation, and then provide an effective way to measuresimilarity between proteins based on gene ontology.

1001.2069	perpendicular ion heating by low-frequency alfven-wave turbulence in the  solar wind	we consider ion heating by turbulent alfven waves (aws) and kinetic alfvenwaves (kaws) with perpendicular wavelengths comparable to the ion gyroradiusand frequencies smaller than the ion cyclotron frequency. when the turbulenceamplitude exceeds a certain threshold, an ion's orbit becomes chaotic. the ionthen interacts stochastically with the time-varying electrostatic potential,and the ion's energy undergoes a random walk. using phenomenological arguments,we derive an analytic expression for the rates at which different ion speciesare heated, which we test by simulating test particles interacting with aspectrum of randomly phased aws and kaws. we find that the stochastic heatingrate depends sensitively on the quantity epsilon = dv/vperp, where vperp is thecomponent of the ion velocity perpendicular to the background magnetic fieldb0, and dv (db) is the rms amplitude of the velocity (magnetic-field)fluctuations at the gyroradius scale. in the case of thermal protons, whenepsilon &lt;&lt; eps1, where eps1 is a constant, a proton's magnetic moment is nearlyconserved and stochastic heating is extremely weak. however, when epsilon &gt;eps1, the proton heating rate exceeds the cascade power that would be presentin strong balanced kaw turbulence with the same value of dv, andmagnetic-moment conservation is violated. for the random-phase waves in ourtest-particle simulations, eps1 is approximately 0.2. for protons in low-betaplasmas, epsilon is approximately db/b0 divided by the square root of beta, andepsilon can exceed eps1 even when db/b0 &lt;&lt; eps1. at comparable temperatures,alpha particles and minor ions have larger values of epsilon than protons andare heated more efficiently as a result. we discuss the implications of ourresults for ion heating in coronal holes and the solar wind.

1101.3805	ultra-thin swnts films with tunable, anisotropic transport properties	directional transport properties at the nanoscale remain a challengeprimarily due to issues associated with control over the underlying anisotropyand scalability to macroscopic scales. in this letter, we develop a facileapproach based on template-guided fluidic assembly of high mobility buildingblocks - single walled carbon nanotubes (swnts) - to fabricate ultra-thin andanisotropic swnt films. a major advancement is the complete control over theanisotropy in the assembled nanostructure, realized by three-dimensionalengineering of dip-coated swnt thin films into alternating hydrophilic andhydrophobic micro-line patterns with prescribed intra/inter-line widths andline thicknesses. variations in the contact line profile results in anevaporation-controlled assembly mechanism that leads to the formation of analternating, and more importantly, contiguous swnt network. evidently, thenanoscopic thickness modulations are direct reflections of the substrategeometry and chemistry. the nanostructured film exhibits significant anisotropyin their electrical and thermal transport properties as well as opticaltransparency, as revealed by characterization studies. the direct interplaybetween the anisotropy and the 3d micro-line patterns of the substrate combinedwith the wafer-level scalability of the fluidic assembly allows us to tune thetransport properties for a host of nanoelectronic applications.

1103.5209	standing shocks in the inner slow solar wind	the slow solar wind, or at least a significant part of it, originates fromthe region bordering streamer helmets, where the flow tube geometry is distinctfrom flow tubes rooted in the center of coronal holes. we examine whether thisparticular tube geometry leads to standing shocks in the inner slow wind inthis region. to isolate the influence of tube geometry, a simple isothermalwind model is employed and is solved in terms of the lambert w function. inaddition to a continuous solution, the model may also admit solutions withshocks, readily constructed with a graphical approach. when allowed, the shocksolutions appear in pairs, one with a shock located in the streamer stalk, theother with a shock below the cusp along the streamer border. we show thatsolutions with standing shocks exist in a broad area in the parameter spacecharacterizing the wind temperature and flow tube. in particular, streamerswith cusps located at a heliocentric distance $\gtrsim 3.2 r_\odot$ can readilysupport discontinuous slow winds with temperatures barely higher than 1 mk.

1103.5211	solar winds along curved magnetic field lines	both remote-sensing measurements using the interplanetary scintillation (ips)technique and in situ measurements by the ulysses spacecraft show a bimodalstructure for the solar wind at solar minimum conditions. at present what makesthe fast wind fast and the slow wind slow still remains to be answered. while arobust empirical correlation exists between the coronal expansion rate $f_c$ ofthe flow tubes and the speeds $v$ measured in situ, further data analysissuggests that $v$ depends on more than just $f_c$. we examine whether thenon-radial shape of field lines, which naturally accompanies any non-radialexpansion, could be an additional geometrical factor. we solved the transportequations incorporating the heating due to turbulent alfv\'en waves for anelectron-proton solar wind along curved field lines given by an analyticalmagnetic field model, representative of a solar minimum corona. the field lineshape is found to influence substantially the solar wind parameters, reducingthe asymptotic speed by up to $\sim 130$ km s$^{-1}$, or by $\sim 28%$ inrelative terms, compared with the case neglecting the field line curvature.this effect was interpreted in the general framework of energy addition in thesolar wind: relative to the straight case, the field line curvature enhancesthe effective energy deposition to the subsonic flow, resulting in a higherproton flux and a lower terminal proton speed. our computations suggest thatthe field line curvature could be a geometrical factor which, in addition tothe tube expansion, substantially influences the solar wind speed. furthermore,at solar minima although the field line curvature unlikely affects the polarfast solar wind, it does help make the wind at low latitudes slow, therebyhelping better reproduce the ulysses measurements.

1107.3199	performance guarantee under longest-queue-first schedule in wireless  networks	efficient link scheduling in a wireless network is challenging. typicaloptimal algorithms require solving an np-hard sub-problem. to meet thechallenge, one stream of research focuses on finding simpler sub-optimalalgorithms that have low complexity but high efficiency in practice. in thispaper, we study the performance guarantee of one such scheduling algorithm, thelongest-queue-first (lqf) algorithm. it is known that the lqf algorithmachieves the full capacity region, $\lambda$, when the interference graphsatisfies the so-called local pooling condition. for a general graph $g$, lqfachieves (i.e., stabilizes) a part of the capacity region, $\sigma^*(g)\lambda$, where $\sigma^*(g)$ is the overall local pooling factor of theinterference graph $g$ and $\sigma^*(g) \leq 1$. it has been shown later thatlqf achieves a larger rate region, $\sigma^*(g) \lambda$, where $\sigma^ (g)$is a diagonal matrix. the contribution of this paper is to describe three newachievable rate regions, which are larger than the previously-known regions. inparticular, the new regions include all the extreme points of the capacityregion and are not convex in general. we also discover a counter-intuitivephenomenon in which increasing the arrival rate may sometime help to stabilizethe network. this phenomenon can be well explained using the theory developedin the paper.

1108.1481	a statistical study on the morphology of rays and dynamics of blobs in  the wake of coronal mass ejections	in this paper, with a survey through the large angle and spectrometriccoronagraph (lasco) data from 1996 to 2009, we present 11 events with plasmablobs flowing outwards sequentially along a bright coronal ray in the wake of acoronal mass ejection. the ray is believed to be associated with the currentsheet structure that formed as a result of solar eruption, and the blobs areproducts of magnetic reconnection occurring along the current sheet. the raymorphology and blob dynamics are investigated statistically. it is found thatthe apparent angular widths of the rays at a fixed time vary in a range of2.1-6.6 (2.0-4.4) degrees with an average of 3.5 (2.9) degrees at 3 (4) rs,respectively, and the observed durations of the events vary from 12 h to a fewdays with an average of 27 h. it is also found, based on the analysis of blobmotions, that 58% (26) of the blobs were accelerated, 20% (9) were decelerated,and 22% (10) moved with a nearly-constant speed. comparing the dynamics of ourblobs and those that are observed above the tip of a helmet streamer, we findthat the speeds and accelerations of the blobs in these two cases differsignificantly. it is suggested that these differences of the blob dynamics stemfrom the associated magnetic reconnection involving different magnetic fieldconfigurations and triggering processes.

1202.6147	non-local correlations in the haldane phase for an xxz spin-1 chain: a  perspective from infinite matrix product state representation	string correlations are investigated in an infinite-size xxz spin-1 chain. byusing the infinite matrix product state representation, we calculate along-range string order. in the xy phase, the string correlations decay withina relatively very large lattice distance, which makes a finite-size studydifficult to verify the non-existence of the string order. thus, in the haldanephase, the non-vanishing string correlations in the limit of a very largedistance allow to characterize the phase boundaries to the xy phase and theneel phase, which implies that the transverse long-range string order is theorder parameter for the haldane phase. in addition, the singular behaviors ofthe von neumann entropy and the fidelity per lattice site are shown to captureclearly the phase transition points that are consistent with the results fromthe string order. the estimated critical points including a bkt transition fromthe xy phase to the haldane phase agree well with the previous results:$\delta_{c2} = 0$ for the xy-haldane phase transition and $\delta_{c3} = 1.185$for the haldane-n'eel phase transition from the density renormalization group.from a finite-entanglement scaling of the von neumann entropy with respect tothe truncation dimension, the central charges are found to be $c \simeq 1.0$ at$\delta_{c2} = 0$ and $c \simeq 0.5$ at $\delta_{c3} = 1.185$, respectively,which shows that the xy-haldane phase transition at $\delta_{c2} = 0$ belongsto the heisenberg universality class, while the haldane-neel phase transitionat $\delta_{c2} = 1.185$ belongs to the two-dimensional classical isinguniversality class. it is also shown that, the long-range order parameters andthe von neumann entropy, as well as the fidelity per site approach, can beapplied to characterize quantum phase transitions as a universal phasetransition indicator for one-dimensional lattice many-body systems.

1206.0992	finite-time convergent gossiping	gossip algorithms are widely used in modern distributed systems, withapplications ranging from sensor networks and peer-to-peer networks to mobilevehicle networks and social networks. a tremendous research effort has beendevoted to analyzing and improving the asymptotic rate of convergence forgossip algorithms. in this work we study finite-time convergence ofdeterministic gossiping. we show that there exists a symmetric gossip algorithmthat converges in finite time if and only if the number of network nodes is apower of two, while there always exists an asymmetric gossip algorithm withfinite-time convergence, independent of the number of nodes. for $n=2^m$ nodes,we prove that a fastest convergence can be reached in $nm=n\log_2 n$ nodeupdates via symmetric gossiping. on the other hand, under asymmetric gossipamong $n=2^m+r$ nodes with $0\leq r&lt;2^m$, it takes at least $mn+2r$ nodeupdates for achieving finite-time convergence. it is also shown that theexistence of finite-time convergent gossiping often imposes strong structuralrequirements on the underlying interaction graph. finally, we apply our resultsto gossip algorithms in quantum networks, where the goal is to control thestate of a quantum system via pairwise interactions. we show that finite-timeconvergence is never possible for such systems.

1206.2417	interpretation of the coronal magnetic field configuration of the sun	the origin of the heliospheric magnetic flux on the sun, and hence the originof the solar wind, is a topic of hot debate.while the prevailing view is thatthe solar wind originates from outside coronal streamer helmets, there alsoexists the suggestion that the open magnetic field spans a far widerregion.without the definitive measurement of the coronal magnetic field, it isdifficult to resolve the conflict between the two scenarios without doubt.wepresent two 2-dimensional, alfv\'enic-turbulence-based models of the solarcorona and solar wind, one with and the other without a closed magnetic fieldregion in the inner corona.the purpose of the latter model is to test whetherit is possible to realize a picture suggested by polarimetric measurements ofthe corona using the fexiii 10747\aa\ line, where open magnetic field linesseem to penetrate the streamer base.the boundary conditions at the coronal baseare able to account for important observational constraints, especially thoseon the magnetic flux distribution.interestingly, the two models provide similarpolarized brightness (pb) distributions in the field of view (fov) ofsoho/lasco c2 and c3 coronagraphs.in particular, a dome-shaped feature ispresent in the c2 fov even for the model without any closed magneticfield.moreover, both models fit equally well the ulysses data scaled to 1 au.wesuggest that: 1) the pb observations cannot be safely taken as a proxy for themagnetic field topology, as often implicitly assumed.2) the ulyssesmeasurements, especially the one showing a nearly uniform distribution withheliocentric latitude of the radial magnetic field, do not rule out theubiquity of open magnetic fields on the sun.

1211.7136	an anisotropic-alfvenic-turbulence-based solar wind model with proton  temperature anisotropy	how the solar wind is accelerated to its supersonic speed is intimatelyrelated to how it is heated. mechanisms based on ion-cyclotron resonance havebeen successful in explaining a large number of observations, those concerningthe significant ion temperature anisotropy above coronal holes in particular.however, they suffer from the inconsistency with turbulence theory which saysthat the turbulent cascade in a low-beta medium like the solar corona shouldproceed in the perpendicular rather than the parallel direction, meaning thatthere is little energy in the ion gyro-frequency range for ions to absorb viaion-cyclotron resonance. recently a mechanism based on the interaction betweenthe solar wind particles and the anisotropic turbulence has been proposed,where the perpendicular proton energy addition is via the stochastic heating(chandran et al. 2011). we extend this promising mechanism by properlyaccounting for the effect of proton temperature anisotropy on the propagationof alfven waves, for the radiative losses of electron energy, and for the fieldline curvature that naturally accompanies solar winds in the corona. while thismechanism was shown in previous studies to apply to the polar fast solar wind,we demonstrate here for the first time that it applies also to the slow windflowing along field lines bordering streamer helmets.

1406.0404	parallel-cascade-based mechanisms for heating solar coronal loops: test  against observations	the heating of solar coronal loops is at the center of the problem of coronalheating. given that the origin of the fast solar wind has been tracked down toatmospheric layers with transition region or even chromospheric temperatures,it is worthy attempting to address whether the mechanisms proposed to providethe basal heating of the solar wind apply to coronal loops as well. we extendthe loop studies based on a classical parallel-cascade scenario originallyproposed in the solar wind context by considering the effects of loopexpansion, and perform a parametric study to directly contrast the computedloop densities and electron temperatures with those measured by trace andyohkoh/sxt. this comparison yields that with the wave amplitudesobservationally constrained by sumer measurements, while the computed loops mayaccount for a significant fraction of sxt loops, they seem too hot whencompared with trace loops. lowering the wave amplitudes does not solve thisdiscrepancy, introducing magnetic twist will make the comparison even lessdesirable. we conclude that the nanoflare heating scenario better explainsultraviolet loops, while turbulence-based steady heating mechanisms may be atwork in heating a fraction of soft x-ray loops.

1406.4688	standing sausage modes in coronal loops with plasma flow	magnetohydrodynamic waves are important for diagnosing the physicalparameters of coronal plasmas. field-aligned flows appear frequently in coronalloops.we examine the effects of transverse density and plasma flow structuringon standing sausage modes trapped in coronal loops, and examine theirobservational implications. we model coronal loops as straight cold cylinderswith plasma flow embedded in a static corona. an eigen-value problem governingpropagating sausage waves is formulated, its solutions used to constructstanding modes. two transverse profiles are distinguished, one being thegeneralized epstein distribution (profile e) and the other (n) proposedrecently in nakariakov et al.(2012). a parameter study is performed on thedependence of the maximum period $p_\mathrm{max}$ and cutoff length-to-radiusratio $(l/a)_{\mathrm{cutoff}}$ in the trapped regime on the density parameters($\rho_0/\rho_\infty$ and profile steepness $p$) and flow parameters (magnitude$u_0$ and profile steepness $u$). for either profile, introducing a flowreduces $p_\mathrm{max}$ relative to the static case. $p_\mathrm{max}$ dependssensitively on $p$ for profile n but is insensitive to $p$ for profile e. byfar the most important effect a flow introduces is to reduce the capability forloops to trap standing sausage modes: $(l/a)_{\mathrm{cutoff}}$ may besubstantially reduced in the case with flow relative to the static one. if thedensity distribution can be described by profile n, then measuring the sausagemode period can help deduce the density profile steepness. however, thispractice is not feasible if profile e better describes the densitydistribution. furthermore, even field-aligned flows with magnitudessubstantially smaller than the ambient alfv\'en speed can make coronal loopsconsiderably less likely to support trapped standing sausage modes.

1407.1544	oscillations in a sunspot with light bridges	solar optical telescope onboard hinode observed a sunspot (ar 11836) with twolight bridges (lbs) on 31 aug 2013. we analysed a 2-hour \ion{ca}{2} h emissionintensity data set and detected strong 5-min oscillation power on both lbs andin the inner penumbra. the time-distance plot reveals that 5-min oscillationphase does not vary significantly along the thin bridge, indicating that theoscillations are likely to originate from the underneath. the slit taken alongthe central axis of the wide light bridge exhibits a standing wave feature.however, at the centre of the wide bridge, the 5-min oscillation power is foundto be stronger than at its sides. moreover, the time-distance plot across thewide bridge exhibits a herringbone pattern that indicates a counter-stream oftwo running waves originated at the bridge sides.  thus, the 5-min oscillations on the wide bridge also resemble the propertiesof running penumbral waves. the 5-min oscillations are suppressed in the umbra,while the 3-min oscillations occupy all three cores of the sunspot's umbra,separated by the lbs. the 3-min oscillations were found to be in phase at bothsides of the lbs. it may indicate that either lbs do not affect umbraloscillations, or umbral oscillations at different umbral cores share the samesource. also, it indicates that lbs are rather shallow objects situated in theupper part of the umbra. we found that umbral flashes follow the life cycles ofumbral oscillations with much larger amplitudes. they cannot propagate acrosslbs. umbral flashes dominate the 3-min oscillation power within each core,however, they do not disrupt the phase of umbral oscillation.

1408.5473	measurements of outflow velocities in on-disk plumes from eis hinode  observations	the contribution of plumes to the solar wind has been subject to hot debatein the past decades. the euv imaging spectrometer (eis) on board hinodeprovides a unique means to deduce outflow velocities at coronal heights viadirect doppler shift measurements of coronal emission lines. such directdoppler shift measurements were not possible with previous spectrometers. wemeasure the outflow velocity at coronal heights in several on-disklong-duration plumes, which are located in coronal holes and show significantblue shifts throughout the entire observational period. in one case, a plume ismeasured 4 hours apart. the deduced outflow velocities are consistent,suggesting that the flows are quasi-steady. furthermore, we provide an outflowvelocity profile along the plumes, finding that the velocity corrected for theline-of-sight effect can reach 10 km s$^{-1}$ at 1.02 $r_{\odot}$, 15 kms$^{-1}$ at 1.03 $r_{\odot}$, and 25 km s$^{-1}$ at 1.05 $r_{\odot}$. thisclear signature of steady acceleration, combined with the fact that there is nosignificant blue shift at the base of plumes, provides an important constrainton plume models. at the height of 1.03 $r_{\odot}$, eis also deduced a densityof 1.3$\times10^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$, resulting in a proton flux of about4.2$\times10^9$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ scaled to 1au, which is an order of magnitudehigher than the proton input to a typical solar wind if a radial expansion isassumed. this suggests that, coronal hole plumes may be an important source ofthe solar wind.

1503.00121	region-based rate-control for h.264/avc for low bit-rate applications	rate-control plays an important role in video coding. however, in theconventional rate-control algorithms, the number and position of macroblocks(mbs) inside one basic unit for rate-control is inflexible and predetermined.the different characteristics of the mbs are not fully considered. also, thereis no overall optimization of the coding of basic units. this paper proposes anew region-based rate-control scheme for h.264/avc to improve the codingefficiency. the inter-frame information is explored to objectively divide oneframe into multiple regions based on their rate-distortion behaviors. the mbswith the similar characteristics are classified into the same region, and theentire region instead of a single mb or a group of contiguous mbs is treated asa basic unit for rate-control. a linear rate-quantization stepsize model and alinear distortion-quantization stepsize model are proposed to accuratelydescribe the rate-distortion characteristics for the region-based basic units.moreover, based on the above linear models, an overall optimization model isproposed to obtain suitable quantization parameters (qps) for the region-basedbasic units. experimental results demonstrate that the proposed region-basedrate-control approach can achieve both better subjective and objective qualityby performing the rate-control adaptively with the content, compared to theconventional rate-control approaches.

1505.04774	a much better replacement of the michaelis-menten equation and its  application	michaelis-menten equation is a basic equation of enzyme kinetics and gives anacceptable approximation of real chemical reaction processes. analyzing thederivation of this equation yields the fact that its good performance ofapproximating real reaction processes is due to michaelis-menten curve (15).this curve is derived from quasi-steady-state assumption(qssa), which has beenproved always true and called quasi-steady-state law by banghe li et al [19].  here, we found a quartic equation a(s,e)=0 (22), which gives more accurateapproximation of the reaction process in two aspects: during the quasi-steadystate of a reaction, michaelis-menten curve approximates the reaction well,while our quartic equation $a(s,e)=0$ gives better approximation; near the endof the reaction, our equation approaches the end of the reaction with a tangentline same to that of the reaction, while michaelis-menten curve does not. inaddition, our quartic equation a(s,e)=0 differs to michaelis-menten curve lessthan the order of $1/s^3$ as s approaches $+\infty$.  by considering the above merits of a(s,e)=0, we suggest it as a replacementof michaelis-menten curve. intuitively, this new equation is more complex andharder to understand. but, just because its complexity, it provides moreinformation about the rate constants than michaelis-menten curve does.  finally, we get a better replacement of the michaelis-menten equation bycombing a(s,e)=0 and the equation $dp/dt=k_2c(t)$.

1507.02169	periods and damping rates of fast sausage oscillations in multi-shelled  coronal loops	standing sausage modes are important in interpreting quasi-periodicpulsations in the lightcurves of solar flares. their periods and damping timesplay an important role in seismologically diagnosing key parameters like themagnetic field strength in regions where flare energy is released. usually suchapplications are based on theoretical results neglecting unresolved finestructures in magnetized loops. however, the existence of fine structuring issuggested on both theoretical and observational grounds. adopting the frameworkof cold magnetohydrodynamics (mhd), we model coronal loops as magnetizedcylinders with a transverse equilibrium density profile comprising a monolithicpart and a modulation due to fine structuring in the form of concentric shells.the equation governing the transverse velocity perturbation is solved with aninitial-value-problem approach, and the effects of fine structuring on theperiods $p$ and damping times $\tau$ of global, leaky, standing sausage modesare examined. a parameter study shows that fine structuring, be it periodicallyor randomly distributed, brings changes of only a few percent to $p$ and $\tau$when there are more than about ten shells. the monolithic part, its steepnessin particular, plays a far more important role in determining $p$ and $\tau$.we conclude that when measured values of $p$ and $\tau$ of sausage modes areused for seismological purposes, it is justified to use theoretical resultswhere the effects due to fine structuring are neglected.

0805.3034	curse-of-dimensionality revisited: collapse of the particle filter in  very large scale systems	it has been widely realized that monte carlo methods (approximation via asample ensemble) may fail in large scale systems. this work offers sometheoretical insight into this phenomenon in the context of the particle filter.we demonstrate that the maximum of the weights associated with the sampleensemble converges to one as both the sample size and the system dimensiontends to infinity. specifically, under fairly weak assumptions, if the ensemblesize grows sub-exponentially in the cube root of the system dimension, theconvergence holds for a single update step in state-space models withindependent and identically distributed kernels. further, in an importantspecial case, more refined arguments show (and our simulations suggest) thatthe convergence to unity occurs unless the ensemble grows super-exponentiallyin the system dimension. the weight singularity is also established in modelswith more general multivariate likelihoods, e.g. gaussian and cauchy. althoughpresented in the context of atmospheric data assimilation for numerical weatherprediction, our results are generally valid for high-dimensional particlefilters.

1511.09215	magnetic flux supplement to coronal bright points	coronal bright points (bps) are associated with magnetic bipolar features(mbfs) and magnetic cancellation. here, we investigate how bp-associated mbfsform and how the consequent magnetic cancellation occurs. we analyselongitudinal magnetograms from the helioseismic and magnetic imager toinvestigate the photospheric magnetic flux evolution of 70 bps. from imagestaken in the 193 a passband of the atmospheric imaging assembly (aia) wedermine that the bps' lifetimes vary from 2.7 to 58.8 hours. the formation ofthe bp mbfs is found to involve three processes, namely emergence, convergenceand local coalescence of the magnetic fluxes. the formation of a mbf caninvolve more than one of these processes. out of the 70 cases, flux emergenceis the main process of a mbf buildup of 52 bps, mainly convergence is seen in28, and 14 cases are associated with local coalescence. for mbfs formed bybipolar emergence, the time difference between the flux emergence and the bpappearance in the aia 193 \aa\ passband varies from 0.1 to 3.2 hours with anaverage of 1.3 hours. while magnetic cancellation is found in all 70 bps, itcan occur in three different ways: (i) between a mbf and small weak magneticfeatures (in 33 bps); (ii) within a mbf with the two polarities moving towardseach other from a large distance (34 bps); (iii) within a mbf whose two mainpolarities emerge in the same place simultaneously (3 bps). while a mbf buildsup the skeleton of a bp, we find that the magnetic activities responsible forthe bp heating may involve small weak fields.

1512.03692	inferring flare loop parameters with measurements of standing sausage  modes	standing fast sausage modes in flare loops were suggested to account for aconsiderable number of quasi-periodic pulsations (qpps) in the light curves ofsolar flares. this study continues our investigation into the possibility toinvert the measured periods $p$ and damping times $\tau$ of sausage modes todeduce the transverse alfv\'en time $r/v_{\rm ai}$, density contrast $\rho_{\rmi}/\rho_{\rm e}$, and the steepness of the density distribution transverse toflare loops. a generic dispersion relation (dr) governing linear sausage modesis derived for pressureless cylinders where density inhomogeneity of arbitraryform takes place within the cylinder. we show that in general the inversionproblem is under-determined for qpp events where only a single sausage modeexists, be the measurements spatially resolved or unresolved. while $r/v_{\rmai}$ can be inferred to some extent, the range of possible steepness parametersmay be too broad to be useful. however, for spatially resolved measurementswhere an additional mode is present, it is possible to deduce self-consistently$\rho_{\rm i}/\rho_{\rm e}$, the profile steepness, and the internal alfv\'enspeed $v_{\rm ai}$. we show that at least for a recent qpp event that involvesa fundamental kink mode in addition to a sausage one, flare loop parameters arewell constrained, even if the specific form of the transverse densitydistribution remains unknown. we conclude that spatially resolved, multi-modeqpp measurements need to be pursued for inferring flare loop parameters.

1601.03415	crime modeling with truncated levy flights and effects of police patrol	in this paper, we developed a truncated levy flight model to study the crimedynamics. in the discrete case, our model allows criminals to perform longjumps in between committing crimes with a speed light. this is a more realisticextension of a pioneering random walk model by short et. al and a levy flightmodel thereafter in chaturapruek, et al. we also derive a continuum limit andperform a stability analysis to study the formation of crime hotspots. ourmodel is more realistic than the levy flight model, and provides an alternativeto the random walk model when the criminals can perform long jumps in betweencommitting crimes. in the next step, we introduce patrolling police officers toour new model following that in. we examine the effects of police patrol whenthe police choose to adopt different strategies, including unbiased randomwalk, biased random walk, and truncated levy flight. we evaluate theeffectiveness of the police patrol with the number of crime events in a giventime frame. with spatially non-uniform initial conditions, we find that thetruncated levy flight to be the best strategy in general.

astro-ph;0606099	on the lyman-alpha and lyman-beta lines in solar coronal streamers	we investigate the formation of the h i lyman-alpha and lyman-beta lines inan equatorial coronal streamer. particular attention is paid to frequencyredistribution for the scattering of the incident radiation. the properties ofthe spectral lines are studied. the coronal model is given by a global 2.5-dthree fluid solar wind model with alpha particles. the emergent intensities andline profiles are calculated from the solution of the statistical equilibriumand radiative transfer equations for an hydrogen atom with 11 energy levelsunder non local thermodynamic equilibrium. the formation of the lines resultsfrom radiative excitation, collisional excitation, and takes into account thecoupling with all other transitions between the hydrogen energy levels. wepresent new estimates of the radiative and collisional contributions of thelyman line intensities within the streamer. it is also shown that within thestreamer, the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the lyman-beta line is abetter indicator of the plasma temperature than that of lyman-alpha. theseresults show that care should be taken when inferring the proton temperaturefrom the lyman-alpha line profile as observed in coronal streamers, e.g. by theultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer or the solar ultraviolet measurements ofemitted radiation experiments on board the solar and heliospheric observatory.

astro-ph;0606147	effects of alpha particles on the angular momentum loss from the sun	the classic weber-davis model of the solar wind is reconsidered byincorporating alpha particles and by allowing the solar wind to flow out of theequatorial plane in an axisymmetrical configuration. in the ion momentumequations of the solar wind, the ion gyro-frequency is many orders of magnitudehigher than any other frequency. this requires that the difference betweenproton and alpha velocity vectors be aligned with the background magneticfield. with the aid of this alignment condition, the governing equations of themulti-fluid solar wind are derived from the standard transport equations. thegoverning equations are numerically solved along a prescribed meridionalmagnetic field line located at colatitude $70^\circ$ at 1au and a steady statefast solar wind solution is found. a general analysis concludes, in agreementwith the weber-davis model, that the magnetic field helps the coronal plasma toachieve an effective corotation out to the alfv\'enic radius, where thepoloidal alfv\'enic mach number $m_t$ equals unity ($m_t$ is defined byequation (\ref{eq:mach})). the model computations show that, magnetic stressespredominate the angular momentum loss of the sun. for the fast wind considered,the proton contribution to the angular momentum loss, which can be larger thanthe magnetic one, is almost completely canceled by the alpha particles thatdevelop an azimuthal speed in the direction opposite to the solar rotation. thepoynting flux associated with the azimuthal components is negligible in theenergy budget. however, the solar rotation can play some role in reducing therelative speed between alpha particles and protons for low latitude fast solarwind streams in interplanetary space.

astro-ph;0702380	angular momentum transport and proton-alpha differential streaming in  the solar wind	the effect of solar rotation on the proton-alpha differential flow speed,$v_{\alpha p}$, and consequently on the angular momentum transport in the solarwind, is explored. it is found that the force introduced by the azimuthalcomponents plays an important role in the force balance in interplanetaryspace, bringing the radial flow speeds of the species considered closer to eachother. for the fast solar wind, the model cannot account for the decrease of$v_{\alpha p}$ observed by helios between 0.3 and 1 au. however, it canreproduce the profile of $v_{\alpha p}$ measured by ulysses beyond 2 au, if theright value for $v_{\alpha p}$ is imposed at that distance. in the slow solarwind, the effect of solar rotation is more pronounced if one starts with thevalue measured by helios at 0.3 au. in this case, solar rotation introduces arelative change of 10-16% in the radial flow speed of the alpha particlesbetween 1 and 4 au. the model calculations also show that, although alphaparticles consume only a small fraction of the energy and linear momentumfluxes of protons, they cannot be neglected when considering the proton angularmomentum flux ${\cal l}_p$. in most examples, it is found that ${\cal l}_p$ isdetermined by $v_{\alpha p}$ for both the fast and the slow wind. in the slowsolar wind, it is also found that the proton and alpha angular momentum fluxes${\cal l}_p$ and ${\cal l}_\alpha$ can be several times larger in magnitudethan the flux carried by the magnetic stresses ${\cal l}_m$. while the sum ofthe angular momentum fluxes ${\cal l}_p={\cal l}_p+{\cal l}_\alpha$ of bothspecies is found to be smaller than the magnetic stress ${\cal l}_m$, for thefast and slow wind alike, this result is at variance with the heliosmeasurements.

astro-ph;0702383	propagation of non-wkb alfven waves in a multicomponent solar wind with  differential ion flow	the propagation of dissipationless, hydromagnetic, non-wkb, purely toroidalalfv\'en waves in a realistic background three-fluid solar wind with axialsymmetry and differential proton-alpha flow is investigated. the wave equationsare derived from standard multi-fluid 5-moment equations. the alfv\'enic point,where the combined poloidal alfv\'en mach number $m_t=1$, is found to be asingular point for the wave equation, which is then numerically solved forthree representative angular frequencies $\omega=10^{-3}$, $10^{-4}$ and$10^{-5}$ rad s$^{-1}$ with a fixed wave amplitude of 10 km s$^{-1}$ imposed atthe coronal base (1 $r_\odot$). between 1 $r_\odot$ and 1 au, the numericalsolutions show substantial deviation from the wkb expectations. even for therelatively high frequency $\omega=10^{-3}$ rad s$^{-1}$, a wkb-like behaviorcan be seen only in regions $r\gtrsim 10$ $r_\odot$. in the low-frequency case$\omega=10^{-5}$ rad s$^{-1}$, the computed profiles of wave-related parametersshow a spatial dependence distinct from the wkb one, the deviation beingparticularly pronounced in interplanetary space. in the inner corona $r\lesssim4$ $r_\odot$, the computed ion velocity fluctuations are considerably smallerthan the wkb expectations in all cases, as is the computed wave-inducedacceleration exerted on protons or alpha particles. with the chosen base waveamplitude, the wave acceleration has negligible effect on the ion force balancein the corona. hence processes other than the non-wkb wave acceleration areneeded to accelerate the ions out of the gravitational potential well of thesun. however, at large distances beyond the alfv\'enic point, the low-frequencywaves can play an important role in the ion dynamics, with the net effect beingto equalize the speeds of the two ion species considered.

0812.1663	angular momentum transport in a multicomponent solar wind with  differentially flowing, thermally anisotropic ions	the helios measurements of the angular momentum flux $l$ for the fast solarwind show that the individual ion contributions, $l_p$ and $l_\alpha$, tend tobe negative (i.e., in the sense of counter-rotation with the sun). however, theopposite holds for the slow wind, and the overall particle contribution $l_p =l_p + l_\alpha$ tends to exceed the magnetic one $l_m$. these aspects are atvariance with previous models. we examine whether introducing realistic iontemperature anisotropies can resolve this discrepancy. from the generalmultifluid transport equations with gyrotropic species pressure tensors, wederive the equations governing both the meridional and azimuthal dynamics ofgeneral axisymmetrical, rotating stellar winds that include two major ionspecies. the azimuthal dynamics are examined in detail, using the empiricallyconstructed meridional flow profiles for the solar wind. we find that $l$ isdetermined by requiring that the solution to the total angular momentumconservation law is unique and smooth close to the alfven point, where thecombined alfvenic mach number $m_t=1$. introducing realistic ion temperatureanisotropies may introduce a change of up to 10% in $l$ and up to 1.8 km/s inazimuthal speeds of individual ions between 0.3 and 1 au, compared with theisotropic case. the latter has strong consequences on the relative importanceof $l_p$ and $l_m$. however, introducing ion temperature anisotropies cannotresolve the discrepancy between measurements and models. for the fast-windsolutions, while in extreme cases $l_p$ becomes negative, $l_p$ never does. onthe other hand, for the slow-wind solutions, $l_p$ never exceeds $l_m$, eventhough $l_m$ may be less than the individual ion contribution, since $l_p$ and$l_\alpha$ always have opposite signs for the slow and fast wind alike.
