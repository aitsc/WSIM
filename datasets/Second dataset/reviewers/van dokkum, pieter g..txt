0901.0551	the newfirm medium-band survey: filter definitions and first results	deep near-infrared imaging surveys allow us to select and study distantgalaxies in the rest-frame optical, and have transformed our understanding ofthe early universe. as the vast majority of k- or irac-selected galaxies is toofaint for spectroscopy, the interpretation of these surveys relies almostexclusively on photometric redshifts determined from fitting templates to thebroad-band photometry. the best-achieved accuracy of these redshiftsdelta(z)/(1+z) ~ 0.06 at z&gt;1.5, which is sufficient for determining the broadcharacteristics of the galaxy population but not for measuring accuraterest-frame colors, stellar population parameters, or the local galaxy density.we have started a near-infrared imaging survey with the newfirm camera on thekitt peak 4m telescope to greatly improve the accuracy of photometric redshiftsin the range 1.5&lt;z&lt;3.5. the survey uses five medium-bandwidth filters, whichprovide crude "spectra" over the wavelength range 1-1.8 micron for all objectsin the 27.6 x 27.6 arcmin newfirm field. in this first paper, we illustrate thetechnique by showing medium band newfirm photometry of several galaxies at1.7&lt;z&lt;2.7 from the near-infrared spectroscopic sample of kriek et al. (2008).the filters unambiguously pinpoint the location of the redshifted balmer breakin these galaxies, enabling very accurate redshift measurements. the fullsurvey will provide similar data for ~8000 faint k-selected galaxies at z&gt;1.5in the cosmos and aegis fields. the filter set also enables efficient selectionof exotic objects such as high redshift quasars, galaxies dominated by emissionlines, and very cool brown dwarfs; we show that late t and candidate "y" dwarfscould be identified using only two of the filters.

0901.4337	recovering stellar population properties and redshifts from broad-band  photometry of simulated galaxies: lessons for sed modeling	we present a detailed analysis of our ability to determine stellar masses,ages, reddening and extinction values, and star formation rates ofhigh-redshift galaxies by modeling broad-band seds with stellar populationsynthesis. in order to do so, we computed synthetic optical-to-nir seds formodel galaxies taken from hydrodynamical merger simulations placed at redshifts1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3. viewed under different angles and during different evolutionaryphases, the simulations represent a wide variety of galaxy types (disks,mergers, spheroids). we show that simulated galaxies span a wide range in sedsand color, comparable to these of observed galaxies. in all star-formingphases, dust attenuation has a large effect on colors, seds, and fluxes. thebroad-band seds were then fed to a standard sed modeling procedure andresulting stellar population parameters were compared to their true values.disk galaxies generally show a decent median correspondence between the trueand estimated mass and age, but suffer from large uncertainties. during themerger itself, we find larger offsets (e.g., log m_recovered - log m_true =-0.13^{+0.10}_{-0.14}). e(b-v) values are generally recovered well, but theestimated total visual absorption av is consistently too low, increasingly sofor larger optical depths. since the largest optical depths occur during thephases of most intense star formation, it is for the highest sfrs that we findthe largest underestimates. the masses, ages, e(b-v), av, and sfr of mergerremnants (spheroids) are very well reproduced. we discuss possible biases insed modeling results caused by mismatch between the true and template starformation history, dust distribution, metallicity variations and agncontribution.

0706.2164	spitzer mid-to-far-infrared flux densities of distant galaxies	we study the infrared (ir) properties of high-redshift galaxies using deepspitzer 24, 70, and 160 micron data. our primary interest is to improve theconstraints on the total ir luminosities, l(ir), of these galaxies. we combinethe spitzer data in the southern extended chandra deep field with ak-band-selected galaxy sample and photometric redshifts from themultiwavelength survey by yale-chile. we used a stacking analysis to measurethe average 70 and 160 micron flux densities of 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 galaxies as afunction of 24 micron flux density, x-ray activity, and rest-frame near-ircolor. galaxies with 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 and s(24)=53-250 micro-jy have l(ir) derivedfrom their average 24-160 micron flux densities within factors of 2-3 of thosederived from the 24 micron flux densities only. however, l(ir) derived from theaverage 24-160 micron flux densities for galaxies with s(24) &gt; 250 micro-jy and1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 are lower than those derived using only the 24 micron fluxdensity by factors of 2-10. galaxies with s(24) &gt; 250 micro-jy have s(70)/s(24)flux ratios comparable to sources with x-ray detections or red rest-frame ircolors, suggesting that warm dust possibly heated by agn may contribute to thehigh 24 micron emission. based on the average 24-160 micron flux densities,nearly all 24 micron-selected galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 have l(ir) &lt; 6 x 10^12solar luminosities, which if attributed to star formation corresponds to &lt; 1000solar masses per year. this suggests that high redshift galaxies may havesimilar star formation efficiencies and feedback processes as local analogs.objects with l(ir) &gt; 6 x 10^12 solar luminosities are quite rare, with asurface density ~ 30 +/- 10 per sq. deg, corresponding to ~ 2 +/- 1 x 10^-6mpc^-3 over 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5.

0903.2044	the relation between compact, quiescent high redshift galaxies and  massive nearby elliptical galaxies: evidence for hierarchical, inside-out  growth	recent studies have shown that massive quiescent galaxies at high redshiftare much more compact than present-day galaxies of the same mass. here wecompare the radial stellar density profiles and the number density of a sampleof massive galaxies at z ~ 2.3 to nearby massive elliptical galaxies. weconfirm that the average stellar densities of the z ~ 2.3 galaxies within theeffective radius, rho(&lt;r_e), are two orders of magnitude higher than those oflocal elliptical galaxies of the same stellar mass. however, we also find thatthe densities measured within a constant physical radius of 1 kpc, rho(&lt;1 kpc),are higher by a factor of 2-3 only. this suggests that inside-out growthscenarios are plausible, in which the compact high redshift galaxies make upthe centers of normal nearby ellipticals. the compact galaxies are common athigh redshift, which enables us to further constrain their evolution byrequiring that the number density of their descendants does not exceedconstraints imposed by the z=0 galaxy mass function. we infer that size growthmust be efficient, with (r_{1+2}/r_1) ~ (m_{1+2}/m_1)^2. a simple model wherecompact galaxies with masses ~ 10^11 msun primarily grow through minor mergersproduces descendants with the approximate sizes, stellar densities, and numberdensity of elliptical galaxies with masses 2-3 x10^11 msun in the localuniverse. we note that this model also predicts evolution in the m_bh - sigmarelation, such that the progenitors of elliptical galaxies have lower blackhole masses at fixed velocity dispersion. the main observational uncertainty isthe conversion from light to mass; measurements of kinematics are needed tocalibrate the masses and stellar densities of the high redshift galaxies.

0905.1692	an ultra-deep near-infrared spectrum of a compact quiescent galaxy at  z=2.2	several recent studies have shown that about half of the massive galaxies atz~2 are in a quiescent phase. moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to beultra-compact with half-light radii of ~1 kpc. we have obtained a ~29 hrspectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z=2.1865 with the gemininear-infrared spectrograph. the spectrum exhibits a strong optical break andseveral absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z&gt;2quiescent galaxies. comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellarpopulation synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (sfr) of 1-3msol/yr, an age of 1.3-2.2 gyr, and a stellar mass of ~2x10^11 msol. we detectseveral faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [nii]/halpha,[sii]/halpha and [oii]/[oiii] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-lineregions. thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission impliesactive star formation. the current sfr is &lt;1% of the past average sfr. if thisgalaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z=2, it impliesthat quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates thatlow luminosity active galactic nuclei (agns) could be common in these objects.nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. however, weshow that the agn contributes &lt;8% to the rest-frame optical emission. apossible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly;although a 0.5 gyr old stellar population can make up &lt;10% of the total stellarmass, it could account for up to ~40% of the optical light. nevertheless, thisspectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellarpopulation.

0905.2411	color distributions, number and mass densities of massive galaxies at  1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3: comparing observations with merger simulations	we present a comparison between the observed color distribution, number andmass density of massive galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3 and a model by hopkins et al.that relates the quasar and galaxy population on the basis of gas-rich mergers.in order to test the hypothesis that quiescent red galaxies are formed after agas-rich merger involving quasar activity, we confront photometry of massive (m&gt; 4x10^10 msun) galaxies extracted from the fires, goods-south, and musycsurveys, together spanning an area of 496 arcmin^2, with synthetic photometryfrom hydrodynamical merger simulations. as in the hopkins et al. (2006b) model,we use the observed quasar luminosity function to estimate the merger rate. wefind that the synthetic u-v and v-j colors of galaxies that had a quasar phasein their past match the colors of observed galaxies that are best characterizedby a quiescent stellar population. at z ~ 2.6, the observed number and massdensity of quiescent red galaxies with m &gt; 4x10^10 msun is consistent with themodel in which every quiescent massive galaxy underwent a quasar phase in thepast. at z ~ 1.9, 2.8 times less quiescent galaxies are observed than predictedby the model as descendants of higher redshift quasars. the merger model alsopredicts a large number of galaxies undergoing merger-driven star formation. wefind that the predicted number and mass density accounts for 30-50% of theobserved massive star-forming galaxies. however, their colors do not matchthose of observed star-forming galaxies. in particular, the colors of dusty redgalaxies are not reproduced by the simulations. several possible origins ofthis discrepancy are discussed. the observational constraints on the validityof the model are currently limited by cosmic variance and uncertainties instellar population synthesis and radiative transfer.

0906.2012	a near-infrared spectroscopic survey of k-selected galaxies at z ~ 2.3:  comparison of stellar population synthesis codes and constraints from the  rest-frame nir	we present sed modeling of a sample of 34 k-selected galaxies at z ~ 2.3.these galaxies have nir spectroscopy that samples the rest-frame balmer/4000abreak as well as deep photometry in thirteen broadband filters. new to ouranalysis is irac data that extend the seds into the rest-frame nir. comparingparameters determined from sed fits with and without the irac data we find thatthe irac photometry significantly improves the confidence intervals of tau,a_v, stellar mass, and sfr for individual galaxies, but does not systematicallyalter the mean parameters of the sample. we use the irac data to assess howwell current stellar population synthesis codes describe the rest-frame nirseds of young galaxies where discrepancies between treatments of the tp-agbphase of stellar evolution are most pronounced. the models of bruzual &amp; charlot(2003), maraston (2005), and charlot &amp; bruzual (2008) all successfullyreproduce the seds of our galaxies with &lt; 5% differences in the quality of fit;however, the best-fit masses from each code differ systematically by as much asa factor of 1.5, and other parameters vary more, up to factors of 2-3. acomparison of best-fit stellar population parameters from different sps codes,dust laws, and metallicities shows that the choice of sps code is the largestsystematic uncertainty in most parameters, and that systematic uncertaintiesare typically larger than the formal random uncertainties. the sed fittingconfirms our previous result that galaxies with strongly suppressed starformation account for ~ 50% of the k-bright population at z ~ 2.3; however, theuncertainty in this fraction is large due to systematic differences in thessfrs derived from the three sps models.

0906.2778	a high stellar velocity dispersion for a compact massive galaxy at z=2.2	recent studies have found that the oldest and most luminous galaxies in theearly universe are surprisingly compact, having stellar masses similar topresent-day elliptical galaxies but much smaller sizes. this finding hasattracted considerable attention as it suggests that massive galaxies havegrown by a factor of ~five in size over the past ten billion years. a key testof these results is a determination of the stellar kinematics of one of thecompact galaxies: if the sizes of these objects are as extreme as has beenclaimed, their stars are expected to have much higher velocities than those inpresent-day galaxies of the same mass. here we report a measurement of thestellar velocity dispersion of a massive compact galaxy at redshift z=2.186,corresponding to a look-back time of 10.7 billion years. the velocitydispersion is very high at 510 (+165, -95) km/s, consistent with the mass andcompactness of the galaxy inferred from photometric data and indicatingsignificant recent structural and dynamical evolution of massive galaxies. theuncertainty in the dispersion was determined from simulations which include theeffects of noise and template mismatch. however, we caution that some subtlesystematic effect may influence the analysis given the low signal-to-noiseratio of our spectrum.

0908.1377	star formation in the cdfs: observations confront simulations	we investigate the star formation history of the universe using fireworks, amultiwavelength survey of the cdfs. we study the evolution of the specific starformation rate (ssfr) with redshift in different mass bins from z = 0 to z ~ 3.we find that the ssfr increases with redshift for all masses. the logarithmicincrease of the ssfr with redshift is nearly independent of mass, but thiscannot yet be verified at the lowest-mass bins at z &gt; 0.8, due toincompleteness. we convert the ssfrs to a dimensionless growth rate tofacilitate a comparison with a semi-analytic galaxy formation model that wasimplemented on the millennium simulation. the model predicts that the growthrates and ssfrs increase similarly with redshift for all masses, consistentwith the observations. however, we find that for all masses, the inferredobserved growth rates increase more rapidly with redshift than the modelpredictions. we discuss several possible causes for this discrepancy, rangingfrom field-to-field variance, conversions to sfr, and shape of the imf. we findthat none of these can solve the discrepancy completely. we conclude that themodels need to be adapted to produce the steep increase in growth rate betweenredshift z=0 and z=1.

0908.1382	the frequency of tidal features associated with nearby luminous  elliptical galaxies from a statistically complete sample	we present a deep broadband optical imaging study of a complete sample ofluminous elliptical galaxies (m_b&lt;-20) at distances 15 mpc - 50 mpc, selectedfrom the tully catalog of nearby galaxies. the images are flat to ~0.35% acrossthe 20' field and reach a v band depth of 27.7 mag arcsec^-2. we derive anobjective tidal interaction parameter for all galaxies and find that 73% ofthem show tidal disturbance signatures in their stellar bodies. this is thefirst time that such an analysis is done on a statistically complete sample andit confirms that tidal features in ellipticals are common even in the localuniverse. from the dynamical time of the sample galaxies at the innermostradius where tidal features are detected we estimate the mass assembly rate ofnearby ellipticals to be dm/m 0.2 per gyr with large uncertainty. we explorethe relation between gravitational interaction signatures and the galaxyenvironment and find that galaxies in clusters are less disturbed than groupand field galaxies. we also study how these interactions affect the broadbandcolors of ellipticals and find a moderate correlation, suggesting that themergers are not accompanied by significant star-formation. lastly, we find nocorrelation between agn activity, as measured by 6cm radio emission, and largescale tidal distortions. this implies that gravitational interactions are notthe only, and perhaps not the most important, trigger of nuclear activity. insummary, we find that elliptical galaxies in groups and low densityenvironments continue to grow at the present day through mostly "dry" mergersinvolving little star formation.

0909.0260	the hubble sequence beyond z=2 for massive galaxies: contrasting large  star-forming and compact quiescent galaxies	we present hubble space telescope nic2 morphologies of a spectroscopic sampleof massive galaxies at z~2.3, by extending our sample of 9 compact quiescentgalaxies (r_e~0.9 kpc) with 10 massive emission-line galaxies. theemission-line galaxies are classified by the nature of their ionized emission;there are six star-forming galaxies and four galaxies hosting an activegalactic nucleus (agn). the star-forming galaxies are the largest among theemission-line galaxies, with a median size of re = 2.8 kpc. the three galaxieswith the highest star formation rates (&gt; 100m \odot/yr) have irregular andclumpy morphologies. the agn host galaxies are more similar to the compactquiescent galaxies in terms of their structures (re~1.1 kpc) and spectralenergy distributions. the total sample clearly separates into two classes in acolor-mass diagram: the large star-forming galaxies that form the blue cloud,and the compact quiescent galaxies on the red sequence. however, it is unclearhow or even if the two classes are evolutionary related. three out of sixmassive star-forming galaxies have dense cores and thus may passively evolveinto compact galaxies due to fading of outer star-forming regions. for thesegalaxies a reverse scenario, in which compact galaxies grow inside-out by starformation is also plausible. we do caution though that the sample is small.nonetheless, it is evident that a hubble sequence of massive galaxies withstrongly correlated galaxy properties is already in place at z &gt; 2.

0912.0514	the growth of massive galaxies since z=2	we study the growth of massive galaxies from z=2 to the present using datafrom the newfirm medium band survey. the sample is selected at a constantnumber density of n=2x10^-4 mpc^-3, so that galaxies at different epochs can becompared in a meaningful way. we show that the stellar mass of galaxies at thisnumber density has increased by a factor of ~2 since z=2, following therelation log(m)=11.45-0.15z. in order to determine at what physical radii thismass growth occurred we construct very deep stacked rest-frame r-band images atredshifts z=0.6, 1.1, 1.6, and 2.0. these image stacks of typically 70-80galaxies enable us to characterize the stellar distribution to surfacebrightness limits of ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2. we find that massive galaxiesgradually built up their outer regions over the past 10 gyr. the mass within aradius of r=5 kpc is nearly constant with redshift whereas the mass at 5-75 kpchas increased by a factor of ~4 since z=2. parameterizing the surfacebrightness profiles we find that the effective radius and sersic n parameterevolve as r_e~(1+z)^-1.3 and n~(1+z)^-1.0 respectively. the data demonstratethat massive galaxies have grown mostly inside-out, assembling their extendedstellar halos around compact, dense cores with possibly exponential radialdensity distributions. comparing the observed mass evolution to the averagestar formation rates of the galaxies we find that the growth is likelydominated by mergers, as in-situ star formation can only account for ~20% ofthe mass build-up from z=2 to z=0. the main uncertainties in this study arepossible redshift-dependent systematic errors in the total stellar masses andthe conversion from light-weighted to mass-weighted radial profiles.

1004.1411	confirmation of the compactness of a z=1.91 quiescent galaxy with hubble  space telescope's wide field camera 3	we present very deep wide field camera 3 (wfc3) photometry of a massive,compact galaxy located in the hubble ultra deep field. this quiescent galaxyhas a spectroscopic redshift z=1.91 and has been identified as an extremelycompact galaxy by daddi et al. 2005. we use new h-f160w imaging data obtainedwith hubble space telescope/wfc3 to measure the deconvolved surface brightnessprofile to h = 28 mag arcsec**-2. we find that the surface brightness profileis well approximated by an n=3.7 sersic profile. our deconvolved profile isconstructed by a new technique which corrects the best-fit sersic profile withthe residual of the fit to the observed image. this allows for galaxy profileswhich deviate from a sersic profile. we determine the effective radius of thisgalaxy: r_e=0.42 +- 0.14 kpc in the observed h-f160w-band. we show that thisresult is robust to deviations from the sersic model used in the fit. we testthe sensitivity of our analysis to faint "wings" in the profile using simulatedgalaxy images consisting of a bright compact component and a faint extendedcomponent. we find that due to the combination of the wfc3 imaging depth andour method's sensitivity to extended faint emission we can accurately trace theintrinsic surface brightness profile, and that we can therefore confidentlyrule out the existence of a faint extended envelope around the observed galaxydown to our surface brightness limit. these results confirm that the galaxylies a factor of 10 off from the local mass-size relation.

1008.4127	on sizes, kinematics, m/l gradients, and light profiles of massive  compact galaxies at z~2	we present a detailed analysis of the structure and resolved stellarpopulations of simulated merger remnants, and compare them to observations ofcompact quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2. we find that major merging is a viablemechanism to produce systems of ~ 10^11 msun and ~ 1 kpc size, provided the gasfraction at the time of final coalescence is high (~ 40%), and provided thatthe progenitors are compact star-forming galaxies, as expected at highredshift. their integrated spectral energy distributions and velocitydispersions are in good agreement with the observations, and their position inthe (v_{maj}/sigma, ellipticity) diagram traces the upper envelope of thedistribution of lower redshift early-type galaxies. the simulated mergerremnants show time- and sightline-dependent m/l ratio gradients that resultfrom a superposition of radially dependent stellar age, stellar metallicity,and extinction. the median ratio of effective radius in rest-frame v-band lightto that in mass surface density is ~ 2 during the quiescent remnant phase. thisis typically expressed by a negative color gradient (i.e., red core), which weexpect to correlate with the integrated color of the system. finally, thesimulations differ from the observations in their surface brightness profileshape. the simulated remnants are typically best fit by high (n &gt;&gt; 4) sersicindices, whereas observed quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2 tend to be less cuspy(median n ~ 2.3). limiting early star formation in the progenitors may berequired to prevent the simulated merger remnants from having extended wings.

1009.0269	the most massive galaxies at 3.0&lt;z&lt;4.0 in the newfirm medium-band  survey: properties and improved constraints on the stellar mass function	[abridged] we use the newfirm medium-band survey (nmbs) to characterize theproperties of a mass-complete sample of 14 galaxies at 3.0&lt;z&lt;4.0 withm_star&gt;2.5x10^11 msun, and to derive more accurate measurements of thehigh-mass end of the stellar mass function (smf) of galaxies at z=3.5, withsignificantly reduced contributions from photometric redshift errors and cosmicvariance to the total error budget of the smf. the typical very massive galaxyat z=3.5 is red and faint in the observer's optical, with median r=26.1, andrest-frame u-v=1.6. about 60% of the sample have optical colors satisfyingeither the u- or the b-dropout color criteria, although ~50% of these galaxieshave r&gt;25.5. about 30% of the sample has sfrs from sed modeling consistent withzero. however, &gt;80% of the sample is detected at 24 micron, with total infraredluminosities in the range (0.5-4.0)x10^13 lsun. this implies the presence ofeither dust-enshrouded starburst activity (with sfrs of 600-4300 msun/yr)and/or highly-obscured active galactic nuclei (agn). the contribution ofgalaxies with m_star&gt;2.5x10^11 msun to the total stellar mass budget at z=3.5is ~8%. we find an evolution by a factor of 2-7 and 3-22 from z~5 and z~6,respectively, to z=3.5. the previously found disagreement at the high-mass endbetween observed and model-predicted smfs is now significant at the 3sigmalevel. however, systematic uncertainties dominate the total error budget, witherrors up to a factor of ~8 in the densities, bringing the observed smf inmarginal agreement with the predicted smf. additional systematic uncertaintieson the high-mass end could be introduced by either 1) the intensestar-formation and/or the very common agn activities as inferred from the mips24 micron detections, and/or 2) contamination by a significant population ofmassive, old, and dusty galaxies at z~2.6.

1009.1620	on the masses of galaxies in the local universe	we compare estimates of stellar mass, mstar, and dynamical mass,mdyn,for asample of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we assumedynamical homology (i.e., mdyn = dispersion**2 * reff, and we find a tight butstrongly non-linear relation: the best fit relation is mstar = mdyn**0.73, withan observed scatter of 0.15 dex. we also find that, at fixed mstar, the ratiomstar/mdyn depends strongly on galaxy structure, as parameterized by sersicindex, n. the size of the differential effect is on the order of 0.6 dex across2 &lt; n &lt; 10. the apparent n-dependence of mstar/mdyn is similar to expectationsfrom simple models, indicating that assuming homology gives the wrong dynamicalmass. we have also derived dynamical mass estimates that explicitly account fordifferences in galaxies' profiles. using this `structure-corrected' dynamicalmass estimator, m(dyn,n), the best fit relation is mstar = m(dyn,n)**(0.92 +-0.08) with an observed scatter of 0.13 dex. while the data are thus consistentwith a linear relation, they do prefer a slightly shallower slope. further, wesee only a small residual trend in mstar/m(dyn,n) with n. we find nostatistically significant systematic trends in mstar/m(dyn,n) as a function ofobserved quantities (e.g, apparent magnitude, redshift), or as a function oftracers of stellar populations. the net differential bias in mstar/m(dyn,n)across a wide range of stellar populations and star formation activities is &lt;=0.12 dex. the very good agreement between stellar mass and structure-correcteddynamical mass strongly suggests that: 1.) galaxy non-homology has a majorimpact on dynamical mass estimates, and 2. there are not strong systematicbiases in the stellar mass-to-light ratios derived from broadband optical seds.further, these results suggest that that the central dark-to-luminous massratio has a relatively weak mass dependence.

1103.0279	halpha and 4000 angstrom break measurements for ~3500 k-selected  galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0	we measure spectral features of ~3500 k-selected galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0 fromhigh quality medium-band photometry using a new technique. first, we divide thegalaxy sample in 32 subsamples based on the similarities between the fullspectral energy distributions (seds) of the galaxies. for each of these 32galaxy types we construct a composite sed by de-redshifting and scaling theobserved photometry. this approach increases the signal-to-noise ratio andsampling of galaxy seds and allows for model-independent stellar populationstudies. the composite seds are of spectroscopic quality, and facilitate -- forthe first time -- halpha measurement for a large magnitude-limited sample ofdistant galaxies. the linewidths indicate a photometric redshift uncertainty ofdz&lt;0.02x(1+z). the composite seds also show the balmer and 4000 angstrombreaks, mgii absorption at ~2800 angstrom, the dust absorption feature at 2175angstrom, and blended [oiii]+hbeta emission. we compare the total equivalentwidth of halpha, [nii], and [sii] (w_halpha+) with the strength of the 4000angstrom break (d(4000)) and the best-fit specific star formation rate, andfind that all these properties are strongly correlated. this is a reassuringresult, as currently most distant stellar population studies are based on justcontinuum emission. furthermore, the relation between w_halpha+ and dn(4000)provides interesting clues to the sfhs of galaxies, as these features aresensitive to different stellar ages. we find that the correlation betweenw_halpha+ and d(4000) at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0 is similar to z~0, and that the suppressionof star formation in galaxies at z&lt;2 is generally not abrupt, but a gradualprocess.

1104.2595	the number density and mass density of star-forming and quiescent  galaxies at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 2.2	we study the build-up of the bimodal galaxy population using the newfirmmedium-band survey, which provides excellent redshifts and well-sampledspectral energy distributions of ~27,000 galaxies with k&lt;22.8 at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 2.2.we first show that star-forming galaxies and quiescent galaxies can be robustlyseparated with a two-color criterion over this entire redshift range. we thenstudy the evolution of the number density and mass density of quiescent andstar-forming galaxies, extending the results of the combo-17, deep2, and othersurveys to z=2.2. the mass density of quiescent galaxies with m &gt; 3 10^11 solarmasses increases by a factor of ~10 from z=2 to the present day, whereas themass density in star-forming galaxies is flat or decreases over the same timeperiod. modest mass growth by a factor of 2 of individual quiescent galaxiescan explain roughly half of the strong density evolution at m&gt;10^11 solarmasses, due to the steepness of the exponential tail of the mass function. therest of the density evolution of massive, quiescent galaxies is likely due totransformation (e.g. quenching) of the massive star-forming population, aconclusion which is consistent with the density evolution we observe for thestar-forming galaxies themselves, which is flat or decreasing with cosmic time.modest mass growth does not explain the evolution of less massive quiescentgalaxies (~10^10.5 solar masses), which show a similarly steep increase intheir number densities. the less massive quiescent galaxies are thereforecontinuously formed by transforming galaxies from the star-forming population

1104.3860	the stellar velocity dispersion of a compact massive galaxy at z=1.80  using x-shooter: confirmation of the evolution in the mass-size and  mass-dispersion relations	recent photometric studies have shown that early-type galaxies at fixedstellar mass were smaller and denser at earlier times. in this paper we assessthat finding by deriving the dynamical mass of such a compact quiescent galaxyat z=1.8. we have obtained a high-quality spectrum with full uv-nir wavelengthcoverage of galaxy nmbs-c7447 using x-shooter on the vlt. we determined avelocity dispersion of 294 +- 51 km/s. given this velocity dispersion and theeffective radius of 1.64 +- 0.15 kpc (as determined from hst-wfc3 f160wobservations) we derive a dynamical mass of 1.7 +- 0.5 x 10^11 msun. comparisonof the full spectrum with stellar population synthesis models indicates thatnmbs-c774 has a relatively young stellar population (0.40 gyr) with little orno star formation and a stellar mass of ~1.5 x 10^11 msun. the dynamical andphotometric stellar mass are in good agreement. thus, our study supports theconclusion that the mass densities of quiescent galaxies were indeed higher atearlier times, and this earlier result is not caused by systematic measurementerrors. by combining available spectroscopic measurements at differentredshifts, we find that the velocity dispersion at fixed dynamical mass was afactor of ~1.8 higher at z=1.8 compared to z=0. finally, we show that theapparent discrepancies between the few available velocity dispersionmeasurements at z&gt;1.5 are consistent with the intrinsic scatter of themass-size relation.

1105.4609	the newfirm medium-band survey: photometric catalogs, redshifts and the  bimodal color distribution of galaxies out to z~3	we present deep near-infrared (nir) medium-bandwidth photometry over thewavelength range 1-1.8 microns in the all-wavelength extended groth stripinternational survey (aegis) and cosmic evolution survey (cosmos) fields. theobservations were carried out as part of the newfirm medium-band survey (nmbs),an noao survey program on the mayall 4m telescope on kitt peak using the noaoextremely wide-field infrared imager (newfirm). in this paper, we describe thefull details of the observations, data reduction and photometry for the survey.we also present a public k-selected photometric catalog, along with accuratephotometric redshifts. the redshifts are computed with 37 (20) filters in thecosmos (aegis) fields, combining the nir medium-bandwidth data with existingultraviolet (uv; galaxy evolution explorer), visible and nir(canada-france-hawaii telescope and subaru) and mid-ir (spitzer/irac) imaging.we find excellent agreement with publicly available spectroscopic redshifts,with sigma_z/(1+z)~1-2% for ~4000 galaxies at z=0-3. the nmbs catalogs contain~13,000 galaxies at z&gt;1.5 with accurate photometric redshifts and rest-framecolors. due to the increased spectral resolution obtained with the five nirmedium-band filters, the median 68% confidence intervals of the photometricredshifts of both quiescent and star-forming galaxies are a factor of ~2 timessmaller when comparing catalogs with medium-band nir photometry to nirbroadband photometry. we show evidence for a clear bimodal color distributionbetween quiescent and star-forming galaxies that persists to z~3, a higherredshift than has been probed so far.

1106.1641	morphological evolution of galaxies from ultradeep hst wfc3 imaging: the  hubble sequence at z~2	we use ultradeep hst wfc3/ir imaging of the hudf to investigate therest-frame optical morphologies of a mass-selected sample of galaxies at z~2.we find a large variety of galaxy morphologies, ranging from large, blue,disk-like galaxies to compact, red, early-type galaxies. we derive rest-frameu-g color profiles for these galaxies and show that most z~2 galaxies in oursample have negative color gradients such that their cores are red. althoughthese color gradients may partly be caused by radial variations in dustcontent, they point to the existence of older stellar populations in thecenters of z~2 galaxies. this result is consistent with an "inside-out"scenario of galaxy growth. we find that the median color gradient is fairlyconstant with redshift: [delta(u-g_{rest})/delta(log r)]_{median} = -0.46,-0.44 and -0.49 for z~2, z~1 and z=0, respectively. using structural parametersderived from surface brightness profiles we confirm that at z~2 galaxymorphology correlates well with specific star formation rate. at the same mass,star forming galaxies have larger effective radii, bluer rest-frame u-g colorsand lower sersic indices than quiescent galaxies. these correlations are verysimilar to those at lower redshift, suggesting that the relations that giverise to the hubble sequence at z=0 are already in place for massive galaxies atthis early epoch.

1107.0972	redshift evolution of the galaxy velocity dispersion function	we present a study of the evolution of the galaxy velocity dispersionfunction (vdf) from z=0 to z=1.5 using photometric data from the ukidss ultradeep survey (uds) and newfirm medium band survey (nmbs) cosmos surveys. the vdfhas been measured locally using direct kinematic measurements from the sloandigital sky survey, but direct studies of the vdf at high redshift aredifficult as they require velocity dispersion measurements of many thousands ofgalaxies. taylor et al. (2010) demonstrated that dynamical and stellar mass arelinearly related when the structure of the galaxy is accounted for. we showthat the stellar mass, size and s\'ersic index can reliably predict thevelocity dispersions of sdss galaxies. we apply this relation to galaxies athigh redshift and determine the evolution of the inferred vdf. we find that thevdf at z~0.5 is very similar to the vdf at z=0. at higher redshifts, we findthat the number density of galaxies with dispersions &lt;~200 km/s is lower, butthe number of high dispersion galaxies is constant or even higher. at fixedcumulative number density, the velocity dispersions of galaxies withlogn[mpc^{-3}]&lt;-3.5 increase with time by a factor of ~1.4 from z~1.5-0,whereas the dispersions of galaxies with lower number density are approximatelyconstant or decrease with time. the vdf appears to show less evolution than thestellar mass function, particularly at the lowest number densities. we notethat these results are still somewhat uncertain and we suggest several avenuesfor further calibrating the inferred velocity dispersions.

1108.1392	mass growth and mergers: direct observations of the luminosity function  of lrg satellite galaxies out to z=0.7 from sdss and boss images	we present a statistical study of the luminosity functions of galaxiessurrounding luminous red galaxies (lrgs) at average redshifts &lt;z&gt;=0.34 and&lt;z&gt;=0.65. the luminosity functions are derived by extracting source photometryaround more than 40,000 lrgs and subtracting foreground and backgroundcontamination using randomly selected control fields. we show that at bothstudied redshifts the average luminosity functions of the lrgs and theirsatellite galaxies are poorly fitted by a schechter function due to aluminosity gap between the centrals and their most luminous satellites. weutilize a two-component fit of a schechter function plus a log-normaldistribution to demonstrate that lrgs are typically brighter than their mostluminous satellite by roughly 1.3 magnitudes. this luminosity gap implies thatinteractions within lrg environments are typically restricted to minor mergerswith mass ratios of 1:4 or lower. the luminosity functions further imply thatroughly 35% of the mass in the environment is locked in the lrg itself,supporting the idea that mass growth through major mergers within theenvironment is unlikely. lastly, we show that the luminosity gap may be atleast partially explained by the selection of lrgs as the gap can be reproducedby sparsely sampling a schechter function. in that case lrgs may represent onlya small fraction of central galaxies in similar mass halos.

1112.0313	a large population of massive compact post-starburst galaxies at z&gt;1:  implications for the size evolution and quenching mechanism of quiescent  galaxies	we study the growth of the red sequence through the number density andstructural evolution of a sample of young and old quiescent galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.the galaxies are selected from the newfirm medium-band survey (nmbs) in thecosmic evolution survey (cosmos) field. we find a large population of massiveyoung recently quenched ("post-starburst") galaxies at z&gt;1 that are almostnon-existent at z&lt;1; their number density is 5 x 10^{-5} mpc^{-3} at z=2,whereas it is a factor of 10 less at z=0.5. the observed number densities ofyoung and old quiescent galaxies at z&gt;1 are consistent with a simple model inwhich all old quiescent galaxies were once identified as post-starburstgalaxies. we find that the overall population of quiescent galaxies havesmaller sizes and slightly more elongated shapes at higher redshift, inagreement with other recent studies. interestingly, the most recently quenchedgalaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2 are not larger, and possibly even smaller, than oldergalaxies at those redshifts. this result is inconsistent with the idea that theevolution of the average size of quiescent galaxies is largely driven bycontinuous transformations of larger, star-forming galaxies: in that case, theyoungest quiescent galaxies would also be the largest. instead, mergers orother mechanisms appear to be required to explain the size growth of quiescentgalaxies from z=2 to the present.

1201.1913	which galaxy property is the best indicator of its host dark matter halo  properties?	in this work we investigate the link between galaxy velocity dispersion, massand other properties (color, morphology) with the properties of dark matterhalos by comparing the clustering of galaxies at both fixed mass and velocitydispersion. we use the sloan digital sky survey to define a volume limitedsample of massive galaxies complete in both stellar mass (&gt;6e10 msun) andvelocity dispersion (&gt;75 km/s). using this sample we show that at fixedvelocity dispersion there is no dependence of the clustering amplitude onstellar or dynamical mass. conversely when stellar or dynamical mass are fixedthere is a clear dependence of the clustering amplitude on velocity dispersionwith higher dispersion galaxies showing a higher clustering amplitude. we alsoshow that whilst when stellar or dynamical mass are fixed there remains adependence of clustering amplitude on morphology, there is no such dependencywhen dispersion is fixed. however, we do see a dependence of the clusteringamplitude on color when both mass and dispersion are fixed. despite this, evenwhen we restrict our samples to only elliptical or red galaxies therelationship between dispersion and clustering amplitude at fixed mass remains.it seems likely that the residual correlation with color is driven by satellitegalaxies in massive halos being redder at fixed dispersion. the lack of asimilar morphology dependence implies that the mechanism turning satellites redis not changing their morphology. our central result is that velocitydispersion is more closely related to the clustering amplitude of galaxies thaneither stellar or dynamical mass. this implies that velocity dispersion is moretightly correlated with the halo properties that determine clustering, eitherhalo mass or age, and supports the notion that the star formation history of agalaxy is more closely related to its halo properties than its overall mass.

1201.4998	revealing velocity dispersion as the best indicator of a galaxy's color,  compared to stellar mass, surface mass density or morphology	using data of nearby galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey weinvestigate whether stellar mass, central velocity dispersion, surface massdensity, or the sersic n parameter is best correlated with a galaxy'srest-frame color. specifically, we determine how the mean color of galaxiesvaries with one parameter when another is fixed. when the stellar mass is fixedwe see that strong trends remain with all other parameters, whereas residualtrends are weaker when surface mass density, n, or velocity dispersion arefixed. overall velocity dispersion is the best indicator of a galaxy's typicalcolor, showing the largest residual color dependence when any of the otherthree parameters are fixed, and stellar mass is the poorest. other studies haveindicated that both the halo and black hole properties are better correlatedwith velocity dispersion than with stellar mass, surface mass density or sersicn. therefore, our results are consistent with a picture where a galaxy's starformation history and present star formation rate are determined to somesignificant degree by the current properties and assembly history of its darkmatter halo and/or the feedback from its central super massive black hole.

1201.5114	observations of dark and luminous matter: the radial distribution of  satellite galaxies around massive red galaxies	we study the projected radial distribution of satellite galaxies around morethan 28,000 luminous red galaxies (lrgs) at 0.28&lt;z&lt;0.40 and trace thegravitational potential of lrg groups in the range 15&lt;r/kpc&lt;700. we show thatat large radii the satellite number density profile is well fitted by aprojected nfw profile with r_s~270 kpc and that at small radii this modelunderestimates the number of satellite galaxies. utilizing the previouslymeasured stellar light distribution of lrgs from deep imaging stacks wedemonstrate that this small scale excess is consistent with a non-negligiblebaryonic mass contribution to the gravitational potential of massive groups andclusters. the combined nfw+scaled stellar profile provides an excellent fit tothe satellite number density profile all the way from 15 kpc to 700 kpc. darkmatter dominates the total mass profile of lrg halos at r&gt;25 kpc whereasbaryons account for more than 50% of the mass at smaller radii. we calculatethe total dark-to-baryonic mass ratio and show that it is consistent withmeasurements from weak lensing for environments dominated by massive early typegalaxies. finally, we divide the satellite galaxies in our sample into threeluminosity bins and show that the satellite light profiles of all brightnesslevels are consistent with each other outside of roughly 25 kpc. at smallerradii we find evidence for a mild mass segregation with an increasing fractionof bright satellites close to the central lrg.

1202.1822	spatially resolved halpha maps and sizes of 57 strongly star-forming  galaxies at z~1 from 3d-hst: evidence for rapid inside-out assembly of disk  galaxies	we investigate the build-up of galaxies at z~1 using maps of halpha andstellar continuum emission for a sample of 57 galaxies with rest-frame halphaequivalent widths &gt;100 angstroms in the 3d-hst grism survey. we find that thehalpha emission broadly follows the rest-frame r-band light but that it istypically somewhat more extended and clumpy. we quantify the spatialdistribution with the half-light radius. the median halpha effective radiusr_e(halpha) is 4.2+-0.1 kpc but the sizes span a large range, from compactobjects with r_e(halpha) ~ 1.0 kpc to extended disks with r_e(halpha) ~ 15 kpc.comparing halpha sizes to continuum sizes, we find&lt;r_e(halpha)/r_e(r)&gt;=1.3+-0.1 for the full sample. that is, star formation, astraced by halpha, typically occurs out to larger radii than the rest-framer-band stellar continuum; galaxies are growing their radii and building up fromthe inside out. this effect appears to be somewhat more pronounced for thelargest galaxies. using the measured halpha sizes, we derive star formationrate surface densities. we find that they range from ~0.05 msun yr^{-1}kpc^{-2} for the largest galaxies to ~5 msun yr^{-1} kpc^{-2} for the smallestgalaxies, implying a large range in physical conditions in rapidly star-formingz~1 galaxies. finally, we infer that all galaxies in the sample have very highgas mass fractions and stellar mass doubling times &lt; 500 myr. although otherexplanations are also possible, a straightforward interpretation is that we aresimultaneously witnessing the rapid formation of compact bulges and large disksat z~1.

1204.3626	the star formation rate function for redshift z~4-7 galaxies: evidence  for a uniform build-up of star-forming galaxies during the first 3 gyr of  cosmic time	we combine recent estimates of dust extinction at z~4-7 with uv luminosityfunction (lf) determinations to derive star formation rate (sfr) functions atz~4, 5, 6 and 7. sfr functions provide a more physical description of galaxybuild-up at high redshift and allow for direct comparisons to sfrs at lowerredshifts determined by a variety of techniques. our sfr functions are derivedfrom well-established z~4-7 uv lfs, uv-continuum slope trends with redshift andluminosity, and irx-beta relations. they are well-described by schechterrelations. we extend the comparison baseline for sfr functions to z~2 byconsidering recent determinations of the h{\alpha} and mid-ir luminosityfunctions. the low-end slopes of the sfr functions are flatter than for the uvlfs, \delta\alpha\sim+0.13, and show no clear evolution with cosmic time(z~0-7). in addition, we find that the characteristic value sfr* from theschechter fit to sfr function exhibits consistent, and substantial, lineargrowth as a function of redshift from ~5 m_sun/yr at z~8, 650 myr after the bigbang, to ~100 m_sun/yr at z~2, ~2.5 gyr later. recent results at z~10, close tothe onset of galaxy formation, are consistent with this trend. the uniformityof this evolution is even greater than seen in the uv lf over the redshiftrange z~2-8, providing validation for our dust corrections. these resultsprovide strong evidence that galaxies build up uniformly over the first 3 gyrof cosmic time.

1205.0547	the star-formation mass sequence out to z=2.5	we study the star formation rate (sfr) - stellar mass (m*) relation in aself-consistent manner from 0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 with a sample of galaxies selected fromthe newfirm medium-band survey. we find a significant non-linear slope of therelation, sfr \propto m*^0.6, and a constant observed scatter of 0.34 dex,independent of redshift and m*. however, if we select only blue galaxies wefind a linear relation sfr \propto m*, similar to previous results at z = 0 bypeng et al. (2010). this selection excludes red, dusty, star-forming galaxieswith higher masses, which brings down the slope. by selecting on l_ir/l_uv (aproxy for dust obscuration) and the rest-frame u-v colors, we show thatstar-forming galaxies fall in three distinct regions of the log(sfr)-log(m*)plane: 1) actively star-forming galaxies with "normal" dust obscuration andassociated colors (54% for log(m*) &gt; 10 at 1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5), 2) red star-forminggalaxies with low levels of dust obscuration and low specific sfrs (11%), and3) dusty, blue star-forming galaxies with high specific sfrs (7%). theremaining 28% comprises quiescent galaxies. galaxies on the "normal" starformation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation withstellar mass and a decreasing specific sfr, with an observed scatter of 0.25dex (0.17 dex intrinsic scatter). the dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upperenvelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapesat all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating thestellar light. the red, low-dust star-forming galaxies may be in the process ofshutting off and migrating to the quiescent population.

1207.3795	3d-hst grism spectroscopy of a gravitationally lensed, low-metallicity  starburst galaxy at z=1.847	we present hubble space telescope (hst) imaging and spectroscopy of thegravitational lens sl2sj02176-0513, a cusp arc at z=1.847. the uv continuum ofthe lensed galaxy is very blue, which is seemingly at odds with its redderoptical colors. the 3d-hst wfc3/g141 near-infrared spectrum of the lens revealsthe source of this discrepancy to be extremely strong [oiii]5007 and h-betaemission lines with rest-frame equivalent widths of 2000 +/- 100 and 520 +/- 40angstroms, respectively. the source has a stellar mass ~10^8 msun, ssfr \sim100/gyr, and detection of [oiii]4363 yields a metallicity of 12 + log(o/h) =7.5 +/- 0.2. we identify local blue compact dwarf analogs to sl2sj02176-0513,which are among the most metal-poor galaxies in the sdss. the local analogsresemble the lensed galaxy in many ways, including uv/optical sed, spatialmorphology and emission line equivalent widths and ratios. common tosl2sj02176-0513 and its local counterparts is an upturn at mid-ir wavelengthslikely arising from hot dust heated by starbursts. the emission lines ofsl2sj02176-0513 are spatially resolved owing to the combination of the lens andthe high spatial resolution of hst. the lensed galaxy is composed of two clumpswith combined size r_e \sim 300 pc, and we resolve significant differences inuv color and emission line equivalent width between them. though it hascharacteristics occasionally attributed to active galactic nuclei, we concludethat sl2sj02176-0513 is a low-metallicity star-bursting dwarf galaxy. suchgalaxies will be found in significant numbers in the full 3d-hst grism survey.

1208.0341	hst/wfc3 confirmation of the inside-out growth of massive galaxies at  0&lt;z&lt;2 and identification of their star forming progenitors at z~3	we study the structural evolution of massive galaxies by linking progenitorsand descendants at a constant cumulative number density of n_c=1.4x10^{-4}mpc^{-3} to z~3. structural parameters were measured by fitting sersic profilesto high resolution candels hst wfc3 j_{125} and h_{160} imaging in theukidss-uds at 1&lt;z&lt;3 and acs i_{814} imaging in cosmos at 0.25&lt;z&lt;1. at a givenredshift, we selected the hst band that most closely samples a commonrest-frame wavelength so as to minimize systematics from color gradients ingalaxies. at fixed n_c, galaxies grow in stellar mass by a factor of ~3 fromz~3 to z~0. the size evolution is complex: galaxies appear roughly constant insize from z~3 to z~2 and then grow rapidly to lower redshifts. the evolution inthe surface mass density profiles indicates that most of the mass at r&lt;2 kpcwas in place by z~2, and that most of the new mass growth occurred at largerradii. this inside-out mass growth is therefore responsible for the largersizes and higher sersic indices of the descendants toward low redshift. at z&lt;2,the effective radius evolves with the stellar mass as r_e m^{2.0}, consistentwith scenarios that find dissipationless minor mergers to be a key driver ofsize evolution. the progenitors at z~3 were likely star-forming disks withr_e~2 kpc, based on their low sersic index of n~1, low median axis ratio ofb/a~0.52, and typical location in the star-forming region of the u-v versus v-jdiagram. by z~1.5, many of these star-forming disks disappeared, giving rise tocompact quiescent galaxies. toward lower redshifts, these galaxies continued toassemble mass at larger radii and became the local ellipticals that dominatethe high mass end of the mass function at the present epoch.

1208.4363	the stellar mass structure of massive galaxies from z=0 to z=2.5;  surface density profiles and half-mass radii	we present stellar mass surface density profiles of a mass-selected sample of177 galaxies at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5, obtained using very deep hst optical andnear-infrared data over the goods-south field, including recent candels data.accurate stellar mass surface density profiles have been measured for the firsttime for a complete sample of high-redshift galaxies more massive than 10^10.7m_sun. the key advantage of this study compared to previous work is that thesurface brightness profiles are deconvolved for psf smoothing, allowingaccurate measurements of the structure of the galaxies. the surface brightnessprofiles account for contributions from complex galaxy structures such as ringsand faint outer disks. mass profiles are derived using radial rest-frame u-gcolor profiles and a well-established empirical relation between these colorsand the stellar mass-to-light ratio. we derive stellar half-mass radii from themass profiles, and find that these are on average ~25% smaller than rest-frameg band half-light radii. this average size difference of 25% is the same at allredshifts, and does not correlate with stellar mass, specific star formationrate, effective surface density, sersic index, or galaxy size. although onaverage the difference between half-mass size and half-light size is modest,for approximately 10% of massive galaxies this difference is more than a factortwo. these extreme galaxies are mostly extended, disk-like systems with largecentral bulges. these results are robust, but could be impacted if the centraldust extinction becomes high. alma observations can be used to explore thispossibility. these results provide added support for galaxy growth scenarioswherein massive galaxies at these epochs grow by accretion onto their outerregions.

1211.3424	stellar kinematics of z~2 galaxies and the inside-out growth of  quiescent galaxies	using stellar kinematics measurements, we investigate the growth of massive,quiescent galaxies from z~2 to today. we present x-shooter spectra from the uvto nir and dynamical mass measurements of 5 quiescent massive (&gt;10^11 msun)galaxies at z~2. this triples the sample of z&gt;1.5 galaxies with wellconstrained (dsigma &lt;100 km/s) velocity dispersion measurements. from spectralpopulation synthesis modeling we find that these galaxies have stellar agesthat range from 0.5-2 gyr, with no signs of ongoing star formation. we measurevelocity dispersions (290-450 km/s) from absorption lines and find that theyare 1.6-2.1 times higher than those of galaxies in the sdss at the same mass.sizes are measured using galfit from hst-wfc3 h160 and uds k-band images. thedynamical masses correspond well to the sed based stellar masses, withdynamical masses that are ~15% higher. we find that m_*/m_dyn may decreaseslightly with time, which could reflect the increase of the dark matterfraction within an increasing effective radius. we combine different stellarkinematic studies from the literature, and examine the structural evolutionfrom z~2 to z~0: we confirm that at fixed dynamical mass, the effective radiusincreases by a factor of ~2.8, and the velocity dispersion decreases by afactor of ~1.7. the mass density within one effective radius decreases by afactor of ~20, while within a fixed physical radius (1 kpc) it decreases onlymildly (~2). when we allow for an evolving mass limit by selecting a populationof galaxies at fixed number density, a stronger size growth with time is found(~4), velocity dispersion decreases by a factor of ~1.4, and interestingly, themass density within 1 kpc is consistent with no evolution. this findingsuggests that massive quiescent galaxies at ~2 grow inside-out, consistent withthe expectations from minor mergers.

1302.2912	galaxy environments over cosmic time: the non-evolving radial galaxy  distributions around massive galaxies since z=1.6	we present a statistical study of the environments of massive galaxies infour redshift bins between z=0.04 and z=1.6, using data from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) and the newfirm medium band survey (nmbs). we measure theprojected radial distribution of galaxies in cylinders around a constant numberdensity selected sample of massive galaxies and utilize a statisticalsubtraction of contaminating sources. our analysis shows that massive primarygalaxies typically live in group halos and are surrounded by 2 to 3 satelliteswith masses more than one-tenth of the primary galaxy mass. the cumulativestellar mass in these satellites roughly equals the mass of the primary galaxyitself. we further find that the radial number density profile of galaxiesaround massive primaries has not evolved significantly in either slope oroverall normalization in the past 9.5 gyr. a simplistic interpretation of thisresult can be taken as evidence for a lack of mergers in the studied groups andas support for a static evolution model of halos containing massive primaries.alternatively, there exists a tight balance between mergers and accretion ofnew satellites such that the overall distribution of galaxies in and around thehalo is preserved. the latter interpretation is supported by a comparison to asemi-analytic model, which shows a similar constant average satellitedistribution over the same redshift range.

1304.2391	the assembly of milky way-like galaxies since z~2.5	galaxies with the mass of the milky way dominate the stellar mass density ofthe universe but it is uncertain how and when they were assembled. here westudy progenitors of these galaxies out to z=2.5, using data from the 3d-hstand candels treasury surveys. we find that galaxies with present-day stellarmasses of log(m)~10.7 built ~90% of their stellar mass since z=2.5, with mostof the star formation occurring before z=1. in marked contrast to the assemblyhistory of massive elliptical galaxies, mass growth is not limited to largeradii: the mass in the central 2 kpc of the galaxies increased by a factor of3.2+-0.8 between z=2.5 and z=1. we therefore rule out simple models in whichbulges were fully assembled at high redshift and disks gradually formed aroundthem. instead, bulges (and black holes) likely formed in lockstep with disks,through bar instabilities, migration, or other processes. we find that afterz=1 the growth in the central regions gradually stopped and the disk continuedto build, consistent with recent studies of the gas distributions in z~1galaxies and the properties of many spiral galaxies today.

1305.1943	quiescent galaxies in the 3d-hst survey: spectroscopic confirmation of a  large number of galaxies with relatively old stellar populations at z~2	quiescent galaxies at z~2 have been identified in large numbers based onrest-frame colors, but only a small number of these galaxies have beenspectroscopically confirmed to show that their rest-frame optical spectra showeither strong balmer or metal absorption lines. here, we median stack therest-frame optical spectra for 171 photometrically-quiescent galaxies at 1.4 &lt;z &lt; 2.2 from the 3d-hst grism survey. in addition to hbeta (4861a), weunambiguously identify metal absorption lines in the stacked spectrum,including the g-band (4304a), mg i (5175a), and na i (5894a). this findingdemonstrates that galaxies with relatively old stellar populations alreadyexisted when the universe was ~3 gyr old, and that rest-frame color selectiontechniques can efficiently select them. we find an average age of 1.3^0.1_0.3gyr when fitting a simple stellar population to the entire stack. we confirmour previous result from medium-band photometry that the stellar age varieswith the colors of quiescent galaxies: the reddest 80% of galaxies aredominated by metal lines and have a relatively old mean age of 1.6^0.5_0.4 gyr,whereas the bluest (and brightest) galaxies have strong balmer lines and aspectroscopic age of 0.9^0.2_0.1 gyr. although the spectrum is dominated by anevolved stellar population, we also find [oiii] and hbeta emission.interestingly, this emission is more centrally concentrated than the continuumwith l_[oiii] = 1.7 +/- 0.3 x 10^40 erg s^-1, indicating residual central starformation or nuclear activity.

0801.1110	a near-infrared spectroscopic survey of k-selected galaxies at z~2.3:  redshifts and implications for broadband photometric studies	using the gemini near-infrared spectrograph (gnirs), we have completed anear-infrared spectroscopic survey for k-bright galaxies at z~2.3, selectedfrom the musyc survey. we derived spectroscopic redshifts from emission linesor from continuum features and shapes for all 36 observed galaxies. thecontinuum redshifts are driven by the balmer/4000 angstrom break, and have anuncertainty in dz/(1+z) of &lt;0.019. we use this unique sample to determine, forthe first time, how accurately redshifts and other properties of massivehigh-redshift galaxies can be determined from broadband photometric data alone.we find that the photometric redshifts of the galaxies in our sample have asystematic error of 0.08 and a random error of 0.13 in dz/(1+z). the systematicerror can be reduced by using optimal templates and deep photometry; the randomerror, however, will be hard to reduce below 5%. the spectra lead tosignificantly improved constraints for stellar population parameters. for mostquantities this improvement is about equally driven by the higher spectralresolution and by the much reduced redshift uncertainty. properties such as theage, a_v, current star formation rate, and the star formation history aregenerally very poorly constrained with broadband data alone. interestinglystellar masses and mass-to-light ratios are among the most stable parametersfrom broadband data. nevertheless, photometric studies may overestimate thenumber of massive galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3, and thus underestimate the evolution ofthe stellar mass density. finally,the spectroscopy supports our previousfinding that red galaxies dominate the high-mass end of the galaxy populationat z=2-3.

1306.2316	dynamical versus stellar masses in compact early-type galaxies: further  evidence for systematic variation in the stellar initial mass function	several independent lines of evidence suggest that the stellar initial massfunction (imf) in early-type galaxies becomes increasingly `bottom-heavy' withincreasing galaxy mass and/or velocity dispersion, sigma. here we considerevidence for imf variation in a sample of relatively compact early-typegalaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey. these galaxies are ofsufficiently high stellar density that a dark halo likely makes a minorcontribution to the total dynamical mass, mdyn, within one effective radius. wefit our detailed stellar population synthesis models to the stacked absorptionline spectra of these galaxies in bins of sigma and find evidence fromimf-sensitive spectral features for a bottom-heavy imf at high sigma. we alsoapply simple `mass-follows-light' dynamical models to the same data and findthat mdyn is significantly higher than what would be expected if these galaxieswere stellar dominated and had a universal milky way imf. adopting mdyn m_*therefore implies that the imf is `heavier' at high sigma. most importantly,the quantitative amount of inferred imf variation is very similar between thetwo techniques, agreeing to within 0.1 dex in mass. the agreement between twoindependent techniques, when applied to the same data, provides compellingevidence for systematic variation in the imf as a function of early-type galaxyvelocity dispersion. any alternative explanations must reproduce both theresults from dynamical and stellar population-based techniques.

1309.6638	tight correlations between massive galaxy structural properties and  dynamics: the mass fundamental plane was in place by z~2	the fundamental plane (fp) is an empirical relation between the size, surfacebrightness, and velocity dispersion of early-type galaxies. this relation hasbeen studied extensively for early-type galaxies in the local universe toconstrain galaxy formation mechanisms. the evolution of the zeropoint of thisplane has been extended to high redshifts to study the luminosity evolution ofmassive galaxies, under the assumption of structural homology. in this work, weassess this assumption by replacing surface brightness with stellar massdensity and present the evolution of the "mass fp" for massive, quiescentgalaxies since z~2. by accounting for stellar populations, we thereby isolateand trace structural and dynamical evolution. despite the observed dramaticevolution in the sizes and morphologies of massive galaxies since z~3, we findthat quiescent galaxies lie on the mass fp out to z~2. in contrast with ~1.4dex evolution in the luminosity fp, average residuals from the z~0 mass fp areless than ~0.15 dex since z~2. assuming the hyde &amp; bernardi (2009) mass fpslope, we find that this minimal offset scales as (1+z)^{-0.095+/-0.043}. thisresult lends credence to previous studies that derived luminosity evolutionfrom the fp. therefore, despite their compact sizes and suggestions thatmassive galaxies are more disk-like at z~2, the relationship between theirdynamics and structural properties are consistent with local early-typegalaxies. finally, we find no strong evidence for a tilt of the mass fprelative to the virial plane, but emphasize the need for full models includingselection biases to fully investigate this issue.

1310.4177	direct measurements of dust attenuation in z~1.5 star-forming galaxies  from 3d-hst: implications for dust geometry and star formation rates	the nature of dust in distant galaxies is not well understood, and untilrecently few direct dust measurements have been possible. we investigate dustin distant star-forming galaxies using near-infrared grism spectra of the3d-hst survey combined with archival multi-wavelength photometry. these dataallow us to make a direct comparison between dust around star-forming regions($a_{v,\mathrm{hii}}$) and the integrated dust content ($a_{v,\mathrm{star}}$).we select a sample of 163 galaxies between $1.36\le{}z\le1.5$ with h$\alpha$signal-to-noise ratio $\ge5$ and measure balmer decrements from stacked spectrato calculate $a_{v,\mathrm{hii}}$. first, we stack spectra in bins of$a_{v,\mathrm{star}}$, and find that$a_{v,\mathrm{hii}}=1.86\,a_{v,\mathrm{star}}$, with a significance of$\sigma=1.7$. our result is consistent with the two-component dust model, inwhich galaxies contain both diffuse and stellar birth cloud dust. next, westack spectra in bins of specific star formation rate ($\log\,\mathrm{ssfr}$),star formation rate ($\log\,\mathrm{sfr}$), and stellar mass ($\log{}m_*$). wefind that on average $a_{v,\mathrm{hii}}$ increases with sfr and mass, butdecreases with increasing ssfr. interestingly, the data hint that the amount ofextra attenuation decreases with increasing ssfr. this trend is expected fromthe two-component model, as the extra attenuation will increase once olderstars outside the star-forming regions become more dominant in the galaxyspectrum. finally, using balmer decrements we derive dust-corrected h$\alpha$sfrs, and find that stellar population modeling produces incorrect sfrs ifrapidly declining star formation histories are included in the exploredparameter space.

1402.0866	bulge growth and quenching since z = 2.5 in candels/3d-hst	exploiting the deep high-resolution imaging of all 5 candels fields, andaccurate redshift information provided by 3d-hst, we investigate the relationbetween structure and stellar populations for a mass-selected sample of 6764galaxies above 10^10 msun, spanning the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. for thefirst time, we fit 2-dimensional models comprising a single sersic fit andtwo-component (i.e., bulge + disk) decompositions not only to the h-band lightdistributions, but also to the stellar mass maps reconstructed from resolvedstellar population modeling. we confirm that the increased bulge prominenceamong quiescent galaxies, as reported previously based on rest-opticalobservations, remains in place when considering the distributions of stellarmass. moreover, we observe an increase of the typical sersic index andbulge-to-total ratio (with median b/t reaching 40-50%) among star-forminggalaxies above 10^11 msun. given that quenching for these most massive systemsis likely to be imminent, our findings suggest that significant bulge growthprecedes a departure from the star-forming main sequence. we demonstrate thatthe bulge mass (and ideally knowledge of the bulge and total mass) is a morereliable predictor of the star-forming versus quiescent state of a galaxy thanthe total stellar mass. the same trends are predicted by the state-of-the-artsemi-analytic model by somerville et al. in the latter, bulges and black holesgrow hand in hand through merging and/or disk instabilities, and agn-feedbackshuts off star formation. further observations will be required to pin downstar formation quenching mechanisms, but our results imply they must beinternal to the galaxies and closely associated with bulge growth.

1406.0002	spectroscopic confirmation of an ultra massive and compact galaxy at  z=3.35: a detailed look at an early progenitor of local most massive  ellipticals	we present the first spectroscopic confirmation of an ultra-massive galaxy atredshift z&gt;3 using data from keck-nirspec, vlt-xshooter, and gtc-osiris. wedetect strong [oiii] and ly$\alpha$ emission, and weak [oii], civ, and heii,placing c1-23152 at a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{spec}$=3.351. the modelingof the emission-line corrected spectral energy distribution results in abest-fit stellar mass of $m_{*}=3.1^{+0.6}_{-0.7}\times10^{11} m_{\odot}$, astar-formation rate of &lt;7 $m_{\odot} yr^{-1}$, and negligible dust extinction.the stars appear to have formed in a short intense burst ~300-500 myr prior tothe observation epoch, setting the formation redshift of this galaxy at z~4.1.from the analysis of the line ratios and widths, and the observed flux at24$\mu$m, we confirm the presence of a luminous hidden active galactic nucleus(agn), with bolometric luminosity of ~$10^{46}erg s^{-1}$. potentialcontamination to the observed sed from the agn continuum is constrained,placing a lower limit on the stellar mass of $2\times10^{11} m_{\odot}$.hst/wfc3 $h_{160}$ and acs $i_{814}$ images are modeled, resulting in aneffective radius of $r_{e}$~1 kpc in the $h_{160}$ band and a sersic indexn~4.4. this object may be a prototype of the progenitors of local most massiveelliptical galaxies in the first 2 gyr of cosmic history, having formed most ofits stars at z&gt;4 in a highly dissipative, intense, and short burst of starformation. c1-23152 is completing its transition to a post-starburst phasewhile hosting a powerful agn, potentially responsible for the quenching of thestar formation activity.

1407.1843	constraining the low-mass slope of the star formation sequence at  0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5	we constrain the slope of the star formation rate ($\log\psi$) to stellarmass ($\log\mathrm{m_{\star}}$) relation down to$\log(\mathrm{m_{\star}/m_{\odot}})=8.4$($\log(\mathrm{m_{\star}/m_{\odot}})=9.2$) at $z=0.5$ ($z=2.5$) with amass-complete sample of 39,106 star-forming galaxies selected from the 3d-hstphotometric catalogs, using deep photometry in the candels fields. for thefirst time, we find that the slope is dependent on stellar mass, such that itis steeper at low masses ($\log\mathrm{\psi}\propto\log\mathrm{m_{\star}}$)than at high masses($\log\mathrm{\psi}\propto(0.3-0.6)\log\mathrm{m_{\star}}$). these steeper lowmass slopes are found for three different star formation indicators: thecombination of the ultraviolet (uv) and infrared (ir), calibrated from astacking analysis of spitzer/mips 24$\mu$m imaging; $\beta$-corrected uv sfrs;and h$\alpha$ sfrs. the normalization of the sequence evolves differently indistinct mass regimes as well: for galaxies less massive than$\log(\mathrm{m_{\star}/m_{\odot}})&lt;10$ the specific sfr($\psi/\mathrm{m_{\star}}$) is observed to be roughly self-similar with$\psi/\mathrm{m_{\star}}\propto(1+z)^{1.9}$, whereas more massive galaxies showa stronger evolution with $\psi/\mathrm{m_{\star}}\propto(1+z)^{2.2-3.5}$ for$\log(\mathrm{m_{\star}/m_{\odot}})=10.2-11.2$. the fact that we find a steepslope of the star formation sequence for the lower mass galaxies will helpreconcile theoretical galaxy formation models with the observations. theresults of this study support the analytical conclusions of leja et al.

1408.3416	stellar mass functions of galaxies at 4&lt;z&lt;7 from an irac-selected sample  in cosmos/ultravista: limits on the abundance of very massive galaxies	we build a spitzer irac complete catalog of objects, obtained bycomplementing the $k_\mathrm{s}$-band selected ultravista catalog with objectsdetected in irac only. with the aim of identifying massive (i.e.,$\log(m_*/m_\odot)&gt;11$) galaxies at $4&lt;z&lt;7$, we consider the systematic effectson the measured photometric redshifts from the introduction of an old and dustysed template and from the introduction of a bayesian prior taking into accountthe brightness of the objects, as well as the systematic effects from differentstar formation histories (sfhs) and from nebular emission lines in the recoveryof stellar population parameters. we show that our results are most affected bythe bayesian luminosity prior, while nebular emission lines and sfhs onlyintroduce a small dispersion in the measurements. specifically, the number of$4&lt;z&lt;7$ galaxies ranges from 52 to 382 depending on the adopted configuration.using these results we investigate, for the first time, the evolution of themassive end of the stellar mass functions (smfs) at $4&lt;z&lt;7$. given the rarityof very massive galaxies in the early universe, major contributions to thetotal error budget come from cosmic variance and poisson noise. the smfobtained without the introduction of the bayesian luminosity prior does notshow any evolution from $z\sim6.5$ to $z\sim 3.5$, implying that massivegalaxies could already be present when the universe was $\sim0.9$~gyr old.however, the introduction of the bayesian luminosity prior reduces the numberof $z&gt;4$ galaxies with best fit masses $\log(m_*/m_\odot)&gt;11$ by 83%, implyinga rapid growth of very massive galaxies in the first 1.5 gyr of cosmic history.from the stellar-mass complete sample, we identify one candidate of a verymassive ($\log(m_*/m_\odot)\sim11.5$), quiescent galaxy at $z\sim5.4$, withmips $24\mu$m detection suggesting the presence of a powerful obscured agn.

1409.2492	the fundamental plane of massive quiescent galaxies out to z~2	the fundamental plane (fp) of early-type galaxies, relating the effectiveradius, velocity dispersion, and surface brightness, has long been recognizedas a unique tool for analyzing galaxy structure and evolution. with thediscovery of distant quiescent galaxies and the introduction of highsensitivity near-infrared spectrographs, it is now possible to explore the fpout to z~2. in this letter we study the evolution of the fp out to z~2 usingkinematic measurements of massive quiescent galaxies ($m_{*}&gt;10^{11}m_{\odot}$). we find preliminary evidence for the existence of an fp out toz~2. the scatter of the fp, however, increases from z~0 to z~2, even whentaking into account the larger measurement uncertainties at higher redshifts.we find a strong evolution of the zero point from z~2 to z~0:$\delta\log_{10}m/l_g\propto(-0.49\pm0.03)~z$. in order to assess whether ourspectroscopic sample is representative of the early-type galaxy population atall redshifts, we compare their rest-frame g-z colors with those from a largermass complete sample of quiescent galaxies. at z&gt;1 we find that thespectroscopic sample is bluer. we use the color offsets to estimate amass-to-light ratio (m/l) correction. the implied fp zero point evolution aftercorrection is significantly smaller: $\delta\log_{10}m/l_g\propto(-0.39\pm0.02)~z$. this is consistent with an apparent formation redshift of$z_{\rm{form}}=6.62^{+3.19}_{-1.44}$ for the underlying population, ignoringthe effects of progenitor bias. a more complete spectroscopic sample isrequired at z~2 to properly measure the m/l evolution from the fp evolution.

1411.5363	the relation between dynamical mass-to-light ratio and color for massive  quiescent galaxies out to z~2 and comparison with stellar population  synthesis models	we explore the relation between the dynamical mass-to-light ratio ($m/l$) andrest-frame color of massive quiescent galaxies out to z~2. we use a galaxysample with measured stellar velocity dispersions in combination with hubblespace telescope and ground-based multi-band photometry. our sample spans alarge range in $\log m_{dyn}/l_{g}$ (of 1.6~dex) and $\log m_{dyn}/l_{k}$ (of1.3~dex). there is a strong, approximately linear correlation between the $m/l$for different wavebands and rest-frame color. the root-mean-scatter scatter in$\log~m_{dyn}/l$ residuals implies that it is possible to estimate the $m/l$with an accuracy of ~0.25 dex from a single rest-frame optical color. stellarpopulation synthesis (sps) models with a salpeter stellar initial mass function(imf) can not simultaneously match $m_{dyn}/l_{g}$ vs. $(g-z)_{rest-frame}$ and$m_{dyn}/l_{k}$ vs. $(g-k)_{rest-frame}$. by changing the slope of the imf weare still unable to explain the m/l of the bluest and reddest galaxies. we findthat an imf with a slope between $\alpha=2.35$ and $\alpha=1.35$ provides thebest match. we also explore a broken imf with a salpeter slope at$m&lt;1m_{\odot}$ and $m&gt;4m_{\odot}$ and a slope $\alpha$ in the intermediateregion. the data favor a slope of $\alpha=1.35$ over $\alpha=2.35$.nonetheless, our results show that variations between different sps models arecomparable to the imf variations. in our analysis we assume that the variationin $m/l$ and color is driven by differences in age, and that othercontributions (e.g., metallicity evolution, dark matter) are small. theseassumptions may be an important source of uncertainty as galaxies evolve inmore complex ways.

1411.5689	on the importance of using appropriate spectral models to derive  physical properties of galaxies at 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.8	interpreting observations of distant galaxies in terms of constraints onphysical parameters - such as stellar mass, star-formation rate (sfr) and dustoptical depth - requires spectral synthesis modelling. we analyse thereliability of these physical parameters as determined under commonly adopted`classical' assumptions: star-formation histories assumed to be exponentiallydeclining functions of time, a simple dust law and no emission-linecontribution. improved modelling techniques and data quality now allow us touse a more sophisticated approach, including realistic star-formationhistories, combined with modern prescriptions for dust attenuation and nebularemission (pacifici et al. 2012). we present a bayesian analysis of the spectraand multi-wavelength photometry of 1048 galaxies from the 3d-hst survey in theredshift range 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.8 and in the stellar mass range 9&lt;log(m/mo)&lt;12. we findthat, using the classical spectral library, stellar masses are systematicallyoverestimated (~0.1 dex) and sfrs are systematically underestimated (~0.6 dex)relative to our more sophisticated approach. we also find that the simultaneousfit of photometric fluxes and emission-line equivalent widths helps break adegeneracy between sfr and optical depth of the dust, reducing theuncertainties on these parameters. finally, we show how the biases of classicalapproaches can affect the correlation between stellar mass and sfr forstar-forming galaxies (the `star-formation main sequence'). we conclude thatthe normalization, slope and scatter of this relation strongly depend on theadopted approach and demonstrate that the classical, oversimplified approachcannot recover the true distribution of stellar mass and sfr.

0804.4175	the detection of a red sequence of massive field galaxies at z~2.3 and  its evolution to z~0	the existence of massive galaxies with strongly suppressed star formation atz~2.3, identified in a previous paper, suggests that a red sequence may alreadybe in place beyond z=2. in order to test this hypothesis, we study therest-frame u-b color distribution of massive galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3. the sample isdrawn from our near-infrared spectroscopic survey for massive galaxies. thecolor distribution shows a statistically significant (&gt;3 sigma) red sequence,which hosts ~60% of the stellar mass at the high-mass end. the red-sequencegalaxies have little or no ongoing star formation, as inferred from bothemission-line diagnostics and stellar continuum shapes. their strong balmerbreaks and their location in the rest-frame u-b, b-v plane indicate that theyare in a post-starburst phase, with typical ages of ~0.5-1.0 gyr. in order tostudy the evolution of the red sequence, we compare our sample withspectroscopic massive galaxy samples at 0.02&lt;z&lt;0.045 and 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0. therest-frame u-b color reddens by ~0.25 mag from z~2.3 to the present at a givenmass. over the same redshift interval, the number and stellar mass density onthe high-mass end (&gt;10^11 msol) of the red sequence grow by factors of ~8 and~6, respectively. we explore simple models to explain the observed evolution.passive evolution models predict too strong d(u-b), and produce z~0 galaxiesthat are too red. more complicated models that include aging, galaxytransformations, and red mergers can explain both the number density and colorevolution of the massive end of the red sequence between z~2.3 and the present.

1503.08831	first results from the virial survey: the stellar content of  $uvj$-selected quiescent galaxies at $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2$ from kmos	we investigate the stellar populations of 25 massive, galaxies($\log[m_\ast/m_\odot] \geq 10.9$) at $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2$ using data obtained withthe k-band multi-object spectrograph (kmos) on the eso vlt. targets wereselected to be quiescent based on their broadband colors and redshifts usingdata from the 3d-hst grism survey. the mean redshift of our sample is $\bar{z}= 1.75$, where kmos yj-band data probe age- and metallicity-sensitiveabsorption features in the rest-frame optical, including the $g$ band, fe i,and high-order balmer lines. fitting simple stellar population models to astack of our kmos spectra, we derive a mean age of $1.03^{+0.13}_{-0.08}$ gyr.we confirm previous results suggesting a correlation between color and age forquiescent galaxies, finding mean ages of $1.22^{+0.56}_{-0.19}$ gyr and$0.85^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ gyr for the reddest and bluest galaxies in our sample.combining our kmos measurements with those obtained from previous studies at$0.2 &lt; z &lt; 2$ we find evidence for a $2-3$ gyr spread in the formation epoch ofmassive galaxies. at $z &lt; 1$ the measured stellar ages are consistent withpassive evolution, while at $1 &lt; z \lesssim2$ they appear to saturate at$\sim$1 gyr, which likely reflects changing demographics of the (mean)progenitor population. by comparing to star-formation histories inferred for"normal" star-forming galaxies, we show that the timescales required to formmassive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 1.5$ are consistent with the enhanced$\alpha$-element abundances found in massive local early-type galaxies.

1506.03085	forming compact massive galaxies	in this paper we study a key phase in the formation of massive galaxies: thetransition of star forming galaxies into massive (m_stars~10^11 msun), compact(r_e~1 kpc) quiescent galaxies, which takes place from z~3 to z~1.5. we use hstgrism redshifts and extensive photometry in all five 3d-hst/candels fields,more than doubling the area used previously for such studies, and combine thesedata with keck mosfire and nirspec spectroscopy. we first confirm that apopulation of massive, compact, star forming galaxies exists at z~2, usingk-band spectroscopy of 25 of these objects at 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.5. they have a mediannii/halpha ratio of 0.6, are highly obscured with sfr(tot)/sfr(halpha)~10, andhave a large range of observed line widths. we infer from the kinematics andspatial distribution of halpha that the galaxies have rotating disks of ionizedgas that are a factor of ~2 more extended than the stellar distribution. bycombining measurements of individual galaxies, we find that the kinematics areconsistent with a nearly keplerian fall-off from v_rot~500 km/s at 1 kpc tov_rot~250 km/s at 7 kpc, and that the total mass out to this radius isdominated by the dense stellar component. next, we study the size and massevolution of the progenitors of compact massive galaxies. even thoughindividual galaxies may have had complex histories with periods of compactionand mergers, we show that the population of progenitors likely followed asimple inside-out growth track in the size-mass plane of d(log r_e) ~ 0.3 d(logm_stars). this mode of growth gradually increases the stellar mass within afixed physical radius, and galaxies quench when they reach a stellar density orvelocity dispersion threshold. as shown in other studies, the mode of growthchanges after quenching, as dry mergers take the galaxies on a relatively steeptrack in the size-mass plane.

1507.03999	where stars form: inside-out growth and coherent star formation from hst  halpha maps of 2676 galaxies across the main sequence at z~1	we present ha maps at 1kpc spatial resolution for star-forming galaxies atz~1, made possible by the wfc3 grism on hst. employing this capability over allfive 3d-hst/candels fields provides a sample of 2676 galaxies. by creating deepstacked halpha (ha) images, we reach surface brightness limits of1x10^-18\erg\s\cm^2\arcsec^2, allowing us to map the distribution of ionizedgas out to &gt;10kpc for typical l* galaxies at this epoch. we find that thespatial extent of the ha distribution increases with stellar mass asr(ha)[kpc]=1.5(mstars/10^10msun)^0.23. furthermore, the ha emission is moreextended than the stellar continuum emission, consistent with inside-outassembly of galactic disks. this effect, however, is mass dependent withr(ha)/r(stars)=1.1(m/10^10msun)^0.054, such that at low masses r(ha)~r(stars).we map the ha distribution as a function of sfr(ir+uv) and find evidence for`coherent star formation' across the sfr-m plane: above the main sequence, hais enhanced at all radii; below the main sequence, ha is depressed at allradii. this suggests that at all masses the physical processes driving theenhancement or suppression of star formation act throughout the disks ofgalaxies. it also confirms that the scatter in the star forming main sequenceis real and caused by variations in the star formation rate at fixed mass. athigh masses (10^10.5&lt;m/msun&lt;10^11), above the main sequence, ha is particularlyenhanced in the center, plausibly building bulges and/or supermassive blackholes. below the main sequence, the star forming disks are more compact and astrong central dip in the ew(ha), and the inferred specific star formationrate, appears. importantly though, across the entirety of the sfr-m plane, theabsolute star formation rate as traced by ha is always centrally peaked, evenin galaxies below the main sequence.

1508.04771	galaxy structure as a driver of the star formation sequence slope and  scatter	it is well established that (1) star-forming galaxies follow a relationbetween their star formation rate (sfr) and stellar mass (m$_{\star}$), the"star-formation sequence", and (2) the sfrs of galaxies correlate with theirstructure, where star-forming galaxies are less concentrated than quiescentgalaxies at fixed mass. here, we consider whether the scatter and slope of thestar-formation sequence is correlated with systematic variations in the sersicindices, $n$, of galaxies across the sfr-m$_{\star}$ plane. we use amass-complete sample of 23,848 galaxies at $0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5$ selected from the 3d-hstphotometric catalogs. galaxy light profiles parameterized by $n$ are based onhubble space telescope candels near-infrared imaging. we use a single sfrindicator empirically-calibrated from stacks of spitzer/mips 24$\mu$m imaging,adding the unobscured and obscured star formation. we find that the scatter ofthe star-formation sequence is related in part to galaxy structure; the scatterdue to variations in $n$ at fixed mass for star-forming galaxies ranges from0.14$\pm$0.02 dex at $z\sim2$ to 0.30$\pm$0.04 dex at $z&lt;1$. while the slope ofthe log(sfr)-log(m$_{\star}$) relation is of order unity for disk-likegalaxies, galaxies with $n&gt;2$ (implying more dominant bulges) havesignificantly lower sfr/m$_{\star}$ than the main ridgeline of thestar-formation sequence. these results suggest that bulges in massive $z\sim2$galaxies are actively building up, where the stars in the central concentrationare relatively young. at $z&lt;1$, the presence of older bulges withinstar-forming galaxies lowers global sfr/m$_{\star}$, decreasing the slope andcontributing significantly to the scatter of the star-formation sequence.

(2014)photometric catalogs. the 2d spectra and the multi-band photometry were fitsimultaneously to determine redshifts and emission line strengths, taking themorphology of the galaxies explicitly into account. the resulting catalog has98,663 measured redshifts and line strengths down to $jh_{ir}\leq 26$ and22,548 with $jh_{ir}\leq 24$, where we comfortably detect continuum emission.of this sample 5,459 galaxies are at $z&gt;1.5$ and 9,621 are at $0.7&lt;z&lt;1.5$,where h$\alpha$ falls in the g141 wavelength coverage. based on comparisonswith ground-based spectroscopic redshifts, and on analyses of paired galaxiesand repeat observations, the typical redshift error for $jh_{ir}\leq 24$galaxies in our catalog is $\sigma_z \approx 0.003 \times (1+z)$, i.e., onenative wfc3 pixel. the $3\sigma$ limit for emission line fluxes of pointsources is $1.5\times10^{-17}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. we show variousrepresentations of the full dataset, as well as individual examples thathighlight the range of spectra that we find in the survey.

(2014)photometric redshifts. photometric redshift accuracy decreases with magnitudeand redshift, but does not vary monotonically with color or stellar mass. the1-$\sigma$ scatter lies between $0.01-0.03$(1+z) for galaxies of all masses andcolors below $z&lt;2.5$ (for $h_{f140w}{&lt;}24$), with the exception of a populationof very red ($u-v &gt; 2$), dusty star-forming galaxies for which the scatterincreases to $\sim0.1(1+z)$. although the overall photometric redshift accuracyfor quiescent galaxies is better than for star-forming galaxies, scatterdepends more strongly on magnitude and redshift than on galaxy type. we verifythese trends using the redshift distributions of close pairs and extend theanalysis to fainter objects, where photometric redshift errors further increaseto $\sim0.046(1+z)$ at $h_{f160w}=26$. we demonstrate that photometric redshiftaccuracy is strongly filter-dependent and quantify the contribution of multiplefilter combinations. we evaluate the widths of redshift probabilitydistribution functions and find that error estimates are underestimated by afactor of $\sim1.1-1.6$, but that uniformly broadening the distribution doesnot adequately account for fitting outliers. finally, we suggest possibleapplications of these data in planning for current and future surveys andsimulate photometric redshift performance in the lsst, des, and combined desand vhs surveys.

0807.1533	eazy: a fast, public photometric redshift code	we describe a new program for determining photometric redshifts, dubbed eazy.the program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic redshifts are notavailable, or only available for a biased subset of the galaxies. the codecombines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinationsof templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and itsuser interface is modeled on the popular hyperz code. a novel feature is thatthe default template set, as well as the default functional forms of thepriors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but onsemi-analytical models. furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novelrest-frame template error function. this function gives different wavelengthregions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertaintiesare realistic. we introduce a redshift quality parameter, q_z, that provides arobust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate.despite the fact that eazy is not "trained" on spectroscopic samples, the code(with default parameters) performs very well on existing public datasets. fork-selected samples in cdf-south and other deep fields we find a 1-sigma scatterin dz/(1+z) of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs forthe fires, musyc, and fireworks surveys.

astro-ph;0101468	morphological evolution and the ages of early-type galaxies in clusters	morphological and spectroscopic studies of high redshift clusters indicatethat a significant fraction of present-day early-type galaxies was transformedfrom star forming galaxies at z&lt;1. on the other hand, the slow luminosityevolution of early-type galaxies and the low scatter in their color-magnituderelation indicate a high formation redshift of their stars. in this paper weconstruct models which reconcile these apparently contradictory lines ofevidence, and we quantify the effects of morphological evolution on theobserved photometric properties of early-type galaxies in distant clusters. weshow that in the case of strong morphological evolution the apparent luminosityand color evolution of early-type galaxies are similar to that of a single agestellar population formed at z=infinity, irrespective of the true starformation history of the galaxies. furthermore, the scatter in age, and hencethe scatter in color and luminosity, is approximately constant with redshift.these results are consequences of the ``progenitor bias'': the progenitors ofthe youngest low redshift early-type galaxies drop out of the sample at highredshift. we construct models which reproduce the observed evolution of thenumber fraction of early-type galaxies in rich clusters and their color andluminosity evolution simultaneously. our modelling indicates that approx. 50%of early-type galaxies were transformed from other galaxy types at z&lt;1, andtheir progenitor galaxies may have had roughly constant star formation ratesprior to morphological transformation. after correcting the observed evolutionof the mean m/l_b ratio for the maximum progenitor bias we find that the meanluminosity weighted formation redshift of stars in early-type galaxiesz_*=2.0^{+0.3}_{-0.2} for omega_m=0.3 and omega_lambda=0.7.

astro-ph;0112547	formation and evolution of galaxies in clusters	elliptical and s0 galaxies dominate the galaxy population in nearby richclusters such as coma. studies of the evolution of the colors, m/l ratios, andline indices of early-type galaxies indicate that they have been a highlyhomogeneous, slowly evolving population over the last ~65% of the age of theuniverse. on the other hand, recent evidence suggests that many early-typegalaxies in clusters have been transformed from spiral galaxies since z~1.arguably the most spectacular evidence for such transformations is theincidence of red merger systems in several high redshift clusters. due to thismorphological evolution the sample of early-type galaxies at high redshift isonly a subsample of the sample of early-type galaxies at low redshift. this``progenitor bias'' results in an overestimate of the mean formation redshiftif simple models without morphological transformations are used. models whichincorporate morphological evolution explicitly can bring the homogeneity, slowevolution, and morphological transformations into agreement. the modeling showsthat the corrected mean formation redshift of the stars in early-type galaxiesmay be as low as z~2 in a lambda dominated universe.

0808.2642	structure and star formation in galaxies out to z=3: evidence for  surface density dependent evolution and upsizing	we present an analysis of galaxies in the cdf-south. we find a tight relationto z=3 between color and size at a given mass, with red galaxies being small,and blue galaxies being large. we show that the relation is driven by stellarsurface density or inferred velocity dispersion: galaxies with high surfacedensity are red and have low specific star formation rates, and galaxies withlow surface density are blue and have high specific star formation rates.surface density and inferred velocity dispersion are better correlated withspecific star formation rate and color than stellar mass. hence stellar mass byitself is not a good predictor of the star formation history of galaxies. ingeneral, galaxies at a given surface density have higher specific starformation rates at higher redshift. specifically, galaxies with a surfacedensity of 1-3 10^9 msun/kpc^2 are "red and dead" at low redshift,approximately 50% are forming stars at z=1, and almost all are forming stars byz=2. this provides direct additional evidence for the late evolution ofgalaxies onto the red sequence. the sizes of galaxies at a given mass evolvelike 1/(1+z)^(0.59 +- 0.10). hence galaxies undergo significant upsizing intheir history. the size evolution is fastest for the highest mass galaxies, andquiescent galaxies. the persistence of the structural relations from z=0 toz=2.5, and the upsizing of galaxies imply that a relation analogous to thehubble sequence exists out to z=2.5, and possibly beyond. the star forminggalaxies at z &gt;= 1.5 are quite different from star forming galaxies at z=0, asthey have likely very high gas fractions, and star formation time scalescomparable to the orbital time.

astro-ph;0506661	the recent and continuing assembly of field ellipticals by red mergers	we present a study of tidal debris associated with 126 nearby red galaxiesselected from the musyc and ndwfs surveys. in the full sample 67 galaxies (53%)show morphological signatures of tidal interactions, consisting of broad fansof stars, tails, and other asymmetries at very faint surface brightness levels.when restricting the sample to the 86 bulge-dominated early-type galaxies thefraction of tidally disturbed galaxies rises to 71%, which implies that forevery ``normal'' undisturbed elliptical there are two which show clear signs ofinteractions. the tidal features are red and smooth, and often extend over &gt;50kpc. of the tidally distorted galaxies about 2/3 are remnants and 1/3 areinteracting with a companion galaxy. the companions are usually bright redgalaxies as well: the median r-band luminosity ratio of the tidal pairs is0.31, and the median color difference after correcting for the slope of thecolor-magnitude relation is -0.02 in b-r. if the ongoing mergers arerepresentative for the progenitors of the remnants ~35% of bulge-dominatedgalaxies experienced a merger with mass ratio &gt;1:4 in the recent past. withfurther assumptions it is estimated that the present-day mass accretion rate ofgalaxies on the red sequence is 0.09+-0.04 per gyr. for a constant orincreasing mass accretion rate with redshift, we find that red mergers may leadto an evolution of a factor of &gt;~2 in the stellar mass density in luminous redgalaxies over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1, consistent with recent studies of theevolution of the luminosity density. we conclude that most of today's fieldelliptical galaxies were assembled at low redshift through "dry" mergers ofgas-poor, bulge-dominated systems.

astro-ph;0607649	comparing dynamical and photometric mass estimates of low- and  high-redshift galaxies: random and systematic uncertainties	we determine the importance of redshift-dependent systematic effects in thedetermination of stellar masses from broad band spectral energy distributions(seds), using high quality kinematic and photometric data of early-typegalaxies at z~1 and z~0. we find that photometric masses of z~1 galaxies can besystematically different, by up to a factor of 2, from photometric masses ofz~0 galaxies with the same dynamical mass. the magnitude of this bias dependson the choice of stellar population synthesis model and the rest-framewavelength range used in the fits. the best result, i.e., without significantbias, is obtained when rest-frame optical seds are fitted with models frombruzual&amp;charlot (2003). when the seds are extended to the rest-frame near-ir, abias is introduced: photometric masses of the z~1 galaxies increase by a factorof 2 relative to the photometric masses of the z~0 galaxies. when we use themaraston (2005) models, the photometric masses of the z~1 galaxies are lowrelative to the photometric masses of the z~0 galaxies by a factor of ~1.8.this offset occurs both for fits based on rest-frame optical seds, and fitsbased on rest-frame optical+near-ir seds. the results indicate that modeluncertainties produce uncertainties as high as a factor of 2.5 in massestimates from rest-frame near-ir photometry, independent of uncertainties dueto unknown star formation histories.

astro-ph;0609587	the star formation epoch of the most massive early-type galaxies	we present new keck spectroscopy of early-type galaxies in three galaxyclusters at z~0.5. we focus on the fundamental plane (fp) relation, and combinethe kinematics with structural parameters determined from hst images. thegalaxies obey clear fp relations, which are offset from the fp of the nearbycoma cluster due to passive evolution of the stellar populations. the z~0.5data are combined with published data for 11 additional clusters at0.18&lt;z&lt;1.28, to determine the evolution of the mean m/l(b) ratio of clustergalaxies with masses m&gt;10^11 m_sun, as implied by the fp. we finddlog(m/l(b))/dz = -0.555+-0.042, stronger evolution than was previouslyinferred from smaller samples. the observed evolution depends on theluminosity-weighted mean age of the stars in the galaxies, the initial massfunction (imf), selection effects due to progenitor bias, and other parameters.assuming a normal imf but allowing for various other sources of uncertainty wefind z* = 2.01+-0.20 for the luminosity-weighted mean star formation epoch. themain uncertainty is the slope of the imf in the range 1-2 solar masses: we findz* = 4.0 for a top-heavy imf with slope x=0. the m/l(b) ratios of the clustergalaxies are compared to those of recently published samples of fieldearly-type galaxies at 0.32&lt;z&lt;1.14. assuming that progenitor bias and the imfdo not depend on environment we find that the present-day age of stars inmassive field galaxies is 4.1 +- 2.0 % (~0.4 gyr) less than that of stars inmassive cluster galaxies, consistent with most, but not all, previous studiesof local and distant early-type galaxies. this relatively small age differenceis surprising in the context of expectations from ``standard'' hierarchicalgalaxy formation models.

astro-ph;0611577	dynamical models of elliptical galaxies in z=0.5 clusters: ii.  mass-to-light ratio evolution without fundamental plane assumptions	we study m/l evolution of early-type galaxies using dynamical modeling ofresolved internal kinematics. this makes fewer assumptions than fundamentalplane (fp) studies and provides a powerful new approach for studying galaxyevolution. we focus on the sample of 25 galaxies in clusters at z=0.5 modeledin paper i. for comparison we compile and homogenize m/l literature data for 60nearby galaxies that were modeled in comparable detail. the nearby sample obeyslog(m/l)_b = z + s log(sigma_eff/[200 km/s]), with z = 0.896 +/- 0.010, s =0.992 +/- 0.054, and sigma_eff the effective velocity dispersion. the z=0.5sample follows a similar relation but with lower zeropoint. the implied m/levolution is delta log(m/l) / delta z = -0.457 +/- 0.046(random) +/-0.078(systematic), consistent with passive evolution following high-redshiftformation. this agrees with the fp results for this sample by van dokkum &amp; vander marel. this confirms that fp evolution tracks m/l evolution, which is animportant verification of the assumptions that underly fp studies. however,while we find more fp evolution for galaxies of low sigma_eff (or low mass),the dynamical m/l evolution instead shows little trend with sigma_eff. we arguethat this difference can be plausibly attributed to a combination of twoeffects: (a) evolution in structural galaxy properties other than m/l; and (b)the neglect of rotational support in studies of fp evolution. the results leavethe question open whether the low-mass galaxies in the sample have youngerpopulation ages than the high-mass galaxies. this highlights the generalimportance in the study of population ages for complementing dynamicalmeasurements with broad-band colors or spectroscopic population diagnostics.

astro-ph;0611724	the origin of line emission in massive z~2.3 galaxies: evidence for  cosmic downsizing of agn host galaxies	using the gemini near-infrared spectrograph (gnirs), we have assembled acomplete sample of 20 k-selected galaxies at 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.7 with high qualitynear-infrared spectra. as described in a previous paper, 9 of these 20 galaxieshave strongly suppressed star formation and no detected emission lines. thepresent paper concerns the 11 galaxies with detected halpha emission, andstudies the origin of the line emission using the gnirs spectra and follow-upobservations with sinfoni on the vlt. based on their [nii]/halpha ratios, thespatial extent of the line emission and several other diagnostics, we inferthat four of the eleven emission-line galaxies host narrow line active galacticnuclei (agns). the agn host galaxies have stellar populations ranging fromevolved to star-forming. combining our sample with a uv-selected galaxy sampleat the same redshift that spans a broader range in stellar mass, we find thatblack-hole accretion is more effective at the high-mass end of the galaxydistribution (~2.9x10^11 msun) at z~2.3. furthermore, by comparing our resultswith sdss data, we show that the agn activity in massive galaxies has decreasedsignificantly between z~2.3 and z~0. agns with similar normalized accretionrates as those detected in our k-selected galaxies reside in less massivegalaxies (~4.0x10^10 msun) at low redshift. this is direct evidence fordownsizing of agn host galaxies. finally, we speculate that the typical stellarmass-scale of the actively accreting agn host galaxies, both at low and at highredshift, might be similar to the mass-scale at which star-forming galaxiesseem to transform into red, passive systems.

astro-ph;0611949	the density and spectral energy distributions of red galaxies at z~3.7	we use the deep nir imaging of the fires survey to investigate trends withredshift of the properties of galaxies selected to have strong balmer/4000abreaks at 2&lt;z&lt;4.5. analagous to the j-k&gt;1.3 (ab) color criterion designed toselect red galaxies at z&gt;2, we propose two color criteria, j-h&gt;0.9 and h-k&gt;0.9,to select red galaxies in two redshift bins at 2&lt;z&lt;3 and 3&lt;z&lt;4.5, respectively.  from the fires catalogs of the hdf-s (4.7 arcmin^2) and ms 1054-03 (26.3arcmin^2) fields, we find 18 galaxies with &lt;z_phot&gt;=2.4 that satisfy js-h&gt;0.9;h&lt;23.4 and 23 galaxies with &lt;z_phot&gt;=3.7 that satisfy h-ks&gt;0.9; ks&lt;24.6, wherethe flux limits are chosen to match the limiting rest-frame luminosities at thedifferent median redshifts of the two samples. the space densities of the js-hand h-ks samples are 1.5+-0.5x10^-4 and 1.2+-0.4x10^-4 mpc^-3, respectively.the rest-frame u-b colors of galaxies in both samples are similarly red (asexpected from the definition of the color criteria), but the rest-frame uvproperties are different: galaxies in the higher-redshift h-k selected samplehave blue nuv-optical colors and uv slopes similar to those of lyman breakgalaxies, while the j-h galaxies are generally red over the entire wavelengthrange observed. synthetic template fits indicate that the distinct rest-nuvproperties of the two samples are primarily a result of dust: we find meana_v=1 mag (j-h sample) and a_v=0.2 mag (h-k). the median stellar massdetermined from the template fits decreases by a factor of ~5 from z=2.4 to3.7, which, coupled with the fact that the space density of such galaxiesremains roughly constant, may imply that the stellar mass density in redgalaxies decreases by a similar factor over this redshift range.

astro-ph;9801190	the color-magnitude relation in cl 1358+62 at z=0.33: evidence for  significant evolution in the s0 population	we use a large mosaic of hst wfpc2 images to measure the colors andmorphologies of 194 spectroscopically confirmed members of the rich galaxycluster cl1358+62 at z=0.33. we study the color-magnitude (cm) relation as afunction of radius in the cluster. the intrinsic scatter in the restframe b-vcm relation of the elliptical galaxies is very small: ~0.022 magnitudes. the cmrelation of the ellipticals does not depend significantly on the distance fromthe cluster center. in contrast, the cm relation for the s0 galaxies doesdepend on radius: the s0s in the core follow a cm relation similar to theellipticals, but at large radii (r&gt;0.7mpc) the s0s are systematically bluer andthe scatter in the cm relation approximately doubles to ~0.043 magnitudes. theblueing of the s0s is significant at the 95% confidence level. these resultsimply that the s0 galaxies in the outer parts of the cluster have formed starsmore recently than the s0s in the inner parts. a likely explanation is thatclusters at z=0.33 continue to accrete galaxies and groups from the field andthat infall extinguishes star formation. the apparent homogeneity of theelliptical galaxy population implies that star formation in recently accretedellipticals was terminated well before accretion occurred. we have constructedmodels to explore the constraints that these observations place on the starformation history of cluster galaxies. we conclude that the population of s0sin clusters is likely to evolve as star forming galaxies are converted intopassively evolving galaxies. assuming a constant accretion rate after z=0.33,we estimate ~15% of the present day early-type galaxy population in richclusters was accreted between z=0.33 and z=0. the ellipticals (and thebrightest s0s) are probably a more stable population, at least since z=0.6.

astro-ph;9906152	the evolution of early-type galaxies in distant clusters iii.: m/l_v  ratios in the z=0.33 cluster cl1358+62	keck spectroscopy and hubble space telescope wfpc2 imaging over a 1.5x1.5 mpcfield of cl1358+62 at z=0.33 are used to study the fundamental plane ofgalaxies based on a new, large sample of 53 galaxies. first, we haveconstructed the fundamental plane for the 30 e and s0 galaxies and find that ithas the following shape: r_e = sigma**(1.31+-0.13) * &lt;i&gt;_e**(-0.86+-0.10),similar to that found locally. the 1-sigma intrinsic scatter about this planeis 14% in m/l(v), comparable to that observed in coma. we conclude that these eand s0 galaxies are structurally mature and homogeneous, like those observed innearby clusters. the m/l(v) ratios of these early-type galaxies are offset fromthe coma fundamental plane by delta log m/l(v) = -0.13+- 0.03 (q0=0.1),indicative of mild luminosity evolution. this evolution suggests a formationepoch for the stars of z &gt; 1. we have also analyzed the m/l(v) ratios ofgalaxies of type s0/a and later. these early-type spirals follow a differentplane from the e and s0 galaxies, with a scatter that is twice as large as thescatter for the e/s0s. the difference in the tilt between the plane of thespirals and the plane of the e/s0s is shown to be due to a systematiccorrelation of velocity dispersion with residual from the plane of theearly-type galaxies. these residuals also correlate with the residuals from thecolor-magnitude relation. thus for spirals in clusters, we see a systematicvariation in the luminosity-weighted mean properties of the stellar populationswith central velocity dispersion. if this is a relative age trend, thenluminosity-weighted age is positively correlated with dispersion.

astro-ph;9908257	the evolution of early-type galaxies in distant clusters ii: internal  kinematics of 55 galaxies in the z=0.33 cluster cl1358+62	we define a large sample of galaxies for use in a study of the fundamentalplane in the intermediate redshift cluster cl1358+62 at $z=0.33$. we haveanalyzed high resolution spectra for 55 members of the cluster. the data wereacquired with the low resolution imaging spectrograph on the keck i 10mtelescope. a new algorithm for measuring velocity dispersions is presented andused to measure the internal kinematics of the galaxies. this algorithm hasbeen tested against the fourier fitting method so the data presented here canbe compared with those measured previously in nearby galaxies. we have measuredcentral velocity dispersions suitable for use in a fundamental plane analysis.the data have high $s/n$ and the resulting random errors on the dispersions arevery low, typically $&lt;5%$. uncertainties due to mismatch of the stellartemplates has been minimized through several tests and the total systematicerror is of order $\about 5%$. good seeing enabled us to measure velocitydispersion profiles and rotation curves for most of the sample and although alarge fraction of the galaxies display a high level of rotation, the gradientsof the total second moment of the kinematics are all very regular and similarto those in nearby galaxies. we conclude that the data therefore can bereliably corrected for aperture size in a manner consistent with nearby galaxysamples.

astro-ph;9909110	the evolution of stellar populations in intermediate redshift clusters	the $m/l$ ratios and absorption line-strengths of distant cluster galaxiescan be used to directly study their stellar populations, determine theirredshift of formation, their scatter in ages, and any dependence of their ageson such internal properties such as velocity dispersion or mass. comparing thezero-point the fundamental plane in the $z=0.33$ cluster cl1358+62 to that incoma, we conclude that the redshift of formation for the stars in massivecluster e/s0s was $z\ga 2$. the fundamental plane in cl1358+62 has thefollowing form: $r_e \propto \sigma^{1.31\pm 0.13}&lt; i&gt;_e^{-0.86\pm 0.10}$,indicating that the last epoch of star-formation has very little dependence ongalaxy mass. the scatter in the cl1358+62 fundamental plane is also very low,equivalent to a scatter in ages of $\sim 15%$.we have also analyzed the $m/l_v$ratios of galaxies of type s0/a and later. these early-type spirals follow adifferent plane from the e and s0 galaxies, with a scatter that is twice aslarge as the scatter for the e/s0s. these residuals also correlate with theresiduals from the color-magnitude relation. preliminary analysis of theabsorption line-strengths of the cl1358+62 early-types indicate that they arewell-described by uniformly old, single-burst stellar populations withmetallicity varying as a function of velocity dispersion.

astro-ph;9911065	the evolution of early-type galaxies in distant clusters i.: surface  photometry and structural parameters for 53 galaxies in the z=0.33 cluster  cl1358+62	using hst imaging of cl1358+62 (z=0.33) structural parameters are derived for53 cluster members. we fit integrated r^{1/4}-laws to the integrated s.b.profiles, and fit two-dimensional r^{1/4}-law model galaxies to the imagesdirectly. the results from the two methods agree very well, with an rms scatterof 13% in r_e. the half-light radii range from 1 to 20 kpc, with a median of 3kpc. we compared r_e from the r^{1/4}-law fits to r_{1/2} derived using otherprofiles. in particular, we fit sersic r^{1/n}-laws and superpositions ofr^{1/4}-law bulges with exponential disks. the r_{1/2} derived from thebest-fit sersic profiles varied with respect to r_e from the r^{1/4}-law fitsby 1% in the median, but with a standard deviation of more than 40%. for thebulge-plus-disk fits, the derived r_{1/2} were offset from r_e of ther^{1/4}-law fits by 10% in the mean, also with a standard deviation of morethan 40%. by comparing the sersic r_{1/2} with those derived from thebulge-plus-disk fitting, that scatter is also large, at 30%. we conclude thatr_{1/2} is generally measured with a typical accuracy of 30-40%. the largeuncertainties in r_{1/2} do not impact the fundamental plane analysis becausethe combination r&lt;i&gt;^{0.76}, which enters the fundamental plane, is extremelystable. the rms scatter in r&lt;i&gt;^{0.76} is less than 3%, regardless of the formof the profile fit to the galaxies. we find that the median bulge fraction ofthe sample is 84% and that the few e+a galaxies in this sample have disks whichmake up about 10-35% of their total light. these results are consistent withresiduals from fitting 2d r^{1/4}-law models directly to the galaxies, in whichdisk-like structures are revealed in about half of the sample. two of the threee+a galaxies show spiral arm structure.

0811.1773	the evolution of the stellar mass function of galaxies from z=4.0 and  the first comprehensive analysis of its uncertainties: evidence for  mass-dependent evolution	[abridged] we present the evolution of the stellar mass function (smf) ofgalaxies from z=4.0 to z=1.3 measured from a sample constructed from the deepnir musyc, the fires, and the goods-cdfs surveys, all having very high-qualityoptical to mid-infrared data. this sample, unique in that it combines data fromsurveys with a large range of depths and areas in a self-consistent way,allowed us to 1) minimize the uncertainty due to cosmic variance andempirically quantify its contribution to the total error budget; 2)simultaneously probe the high-mass end and the low-mass end (down to ~0.05times the characteristic stellar mass) of the smf with good statistics; and 3)empirically derive the redshift-dependent completeness limits in stellar mass.we provide, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of random andsystematic uncertainties affecting the derived smfs. we find that the massdensity evolves by a factor of ~17(+7,-10) since z=4.0, mostly driven by achange in the normalization phi*. if only random errors are taken into account,we find evidence for mass-dependent evolution, with the low-mass end evolvingmore rapidly than the high-mass end. however, we show that this result is nolonger robust when systematic uncertainties due to the sed-modeling assumptionsare taken into account. taking our results at face value, we find that they arein conflict with semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. the models predictsmfs that are in general too steep, with too many low-mass galaxies and too fewhigh-mass galaxies. the discrepancy at the high-mass end is susceptible touncertainties in the models and the data, but the discrepancy at the low-massend may be more difficult to explain.
