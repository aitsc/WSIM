0903.1754	a third red supergiant rich cluster in the scutum-crux arm	we aim to characterise the properties of a third massive, red supergiantdominated galactic cluster. to accomplish this we utilised a combination ofnear/mid-ir photometry and spectroscopy to identify and classify the propertiesof cluster members, and statistical arguments to determine the mass of thecluster. we found a total of 16 strong candidates for cluster membership, forwhich formal classification of a subset yields spectral types from k3-m4 ia andluminosities between log(l/l_sun)~4.5-4.8 for an adopted distance of 6+/-1 kpc.for an age in the range of 16-20 myr, the implied mass is 2-4x10^4 m_sun,making it one of the most massive young clusters in the galaxy. this discoverysupports the hypothesis that a significant burst of star formation occurred atthe base of scutum-crux arm between 10-20 myr ago, yielding a stellar complexcomprising at least ~10^5m_sun of stars (noting that since the clusteridentification criteria rely on the presence of rsgs, we suspect that the truestellar yield will be significantly higher). we highlight the apparent absenceof x-ray binaries within the star formation complex and finally, given thephysical association of at least two pulsars with this region, discuss theimplications of this finding for stellar evolution and the production andproperties of neutron stars.

0907.3876	spectral classification of the mass donors in the high-mass x-ray  binaries exo 1722-363 and oao 1657-415	we report near-infrared observations of the mass donors of the eclipsinghigh-mass x-ray binary (hmxb) systems exo 1722-363 and oao 1657-415 in order toderive their accurate spectral classifications. we determined that exo 1722-363was of spectral type b0 - b1 ia, positioned at a distance 8.0 +2.5/-2.0 kpcwith a progenitor mass in the range 30 - 40 m_sun. luminosity calculationsimply that l_x ~ 10^35 - 10^37 erg s^-1 for this distance range. we concludethat exo 1722-363 shares many of the properties associated with other x-raybinary b-type supergiant donors. we found that oao 1657-415 correlates closelywith the spectra of a class of transitional objects, the ofpe/wnl, anintermediate evolutionary stage between massive o type stars leaving the mainsequence and evolving into wolf-rayets. due to the wide range range inluminosity displayed by ofpe/wnl stars, (log l/l_sun ~ 5.3 - 6.2) distancedeterminations are problematic. for oao 1657-415 we report a distance of 4.4 &lt;=d &lt;= 12 kpc, implying an x-ray luminosity of 1.5 x 10^36 &lt;= l_x &lt;= 10^37 ergs^-1. we have used our new classification of oao 1657-415 to explain thephysical processes responsible for its unique position within the corbetdiagram. ofpe/wnl stars demonstrate a high rate of mass-loss through a densestellar wind combined with a low terminal velocity. this combination of windproperties leads to a high accretion rate and transfer of angular momentum tothe neutron star in this system. we believe this in turn leads to a smallerinstantaneous equilibrium spin period with respect to normal ob supergiants.

1003.5107	a serendipitous survey for variability amongst the massive stellar  population of westerlund 1	massive stars exhibit spectroscopic and photometric variability over a widerange of timescales. however the physical mechanisms driving this behaviourremain poorly understood. westerlund 1 presents an ideal laboratory forstudying these processes in a rich, coeval population of post-main sequencestars and we present a pathfinding study aimed at characterising theirvariability utilising the large body of data that has accumulated since the1960s. spectroscopic variability attributable to both wind asphericity andphotospheric pulsations was present amongst both the hot and cool stellarpopulations. given the limitations imposed by the data, we were unable todetermine the physical origin of the wind structure inferred for the obsupergiants, although the inhomogineities in the winds of the wolf rayets arelikely driven by binary interactions and, conversely, by pulsations in at leastone of the cool hypergiants. photospheric pulsations were found for starsranging from spectral types as early as o9 i through to the mid f ia+ yellowhypergiants - with a possible dependence on the luminosity class amongst the obstars. the spectroscopically variable red supergiants (m2-5 ia) are alsopotential pulsators but require further observations to confirm thishypothesis. determination of the amplitude and periodicity of these pulsationsas a function of temperature, luminosity and evolutionary state holds open theprospect of identifying the physical mechanisms driving the instabilities thatconstrain and define stellar evolution in the upper reaches of the hr diagram,while the presence of highly luminous yellow hypergiants and red supergiantswithin wd1 place strong constraints on post-main sequence evolutionarypathways, apparently contradicting current theoretical predictions for &gt;25msunstars at solar metallicites.

1305.0459	the supergiant b[e] star lha 115-s 18 - binary and/or luminous blue  variable?	the mechanism by which supergiant (sg)b[e] stars support cool, dense dustydiscs/tori and their physical relationship with other evolved, massive starssuch as luminous blue variables is uncertain. in order to investigate bothissues we have analysed the long term behaviour of the canonical sgb[e] starlha 115-s 18. we employed the ogle ii-iv lightcurve to search for (a-)periodicvariability and supplemented these data with new and historic spectroscopy. incontrast to historical expectations for sgb[e] stars, s18 is bothphotometrically and spectroscopically highly variable. the lightcurve ischaracterised by rapid aperiodic `flaring' throughout the 16 years ofobservations. changes in the high excitation emission line component of thespectrum imply evolution in the stellar temperature - as expected for luminousblue variables - although somewhat surprisingly, spectroscopic and photometricvariability appears not to be correlated. characterised by emission in lowexcitation metallic species, the cool circumstellar torus appears largelyunaffected by this behaviour. finally, in conjunction with intense, highlyvariable heii emission, x-ray emission implies the presence of an unseen binarycompanion. s18 provides observational support for the putative physicalassociation of (a subset of) sgb[e] stars and luminous blue variables. giventhe nature of the circumstellar environment of s18 and that luminous bluevariables have been suggested as sn progenitors, it is tempting to draw aparallel to the progenitors of sn1987a and the unusual transient sn2009ip.moreover the likely binary nature of s18 strengthens the possibility that thedusty discs/tori that characterise sgb[e] stars are the result of binary-drivenmass-loss; consequently such stars may provide a window on the short livedphase of mass-transfer in massive compact binaries.

1311.3956	iras 18357-0604 - an analogue of the galactic yellow hypergiant irc  +10420?	yellow hypergiants represent a short-lived evolutionary episode experiencedby massive stars as they transit to and from a red supergiant phase. as such,their properties provide a critical test of stellar evolutionary theory. thegalactic yellow hypergiant irc +10420 is a cornerstone system for understandingthis phase, since it is the strongest post-rsg candidate known, hasdemonstrated real-time evolution across the hertzsprung-russell diagram andbeen subject to extensive mass loss. here we report on the discovery of a twinof irc +10420 - iras 18357-0604. optical and near-ir spectroscopy are used toinvestigate the physical properties of iras 18357-0604, while ir photometryprobes the nature of its circumstellar environment. pronounced spectralsimilarities between iras 18357-0604 and irc +10420 suggest comparabletemperatures and wind geometries, while photometric data reveals a similarlydusty circumstellar environment, although historical mass loss appears to havebeen heavier in irc +10420. the systemic velocity implies a distance compatiblewith the red supergiant dominated complex at the base of the scutum crux arm;the resultant luminosity determination is consistent with a physicalassociation but suggests a lower initial mass than inferred for irc +10420(&lt;20msun versus ~40msun). evolutionary predictions for the physical propertiesof supernova progenitors derived from ~18-20msun stars - or ~12-15msun starsthat have experienced enhanced mass loss as red supergiants - comparefavourably with those of iras 18357-0604, which in turn appears to be similarto the the progenitor of sn2011dh; it may therefore provide an importantinsight into the nature of the apparently h-depleted yellow hypergiantprogenitors of some type iib sne.

1311.4792	the circumstellar environment and evolutionary state of the supergiant  b[e] star wd1-9	the location of the supergiant (sg)b[e] star wd1-9 within the coevalstarburst cluster westerlund 1 allows for its placement in a detailed post-mainsequence evolutionary scheme and hence we have utilised a comprehensivemultiwavelength dataset to determine its physical properties and relation toother sgb[e] stars and the evolved stellar population of wd1. wd1-9 is found toexhibit the rich optical emission line spectrum that is characteristic ofsgb[e] stars, while dust mass, composition and disc geometry determined frommid-ir data resemble those of other well known examples such as r126. extremehistorical and ongoing mass loss is inferred from radio observations, while thex-ray properties of wd1-9 imply the presence of high temperature plasma withinthe system and are directly comparable to a number of confirmed short-periodcolliding wind binaries within wd1. the most complete explanation for theobservational properties of wd1-9 is that it is a massive interacting binarycurrently undergoing, or recently exited from, rapid roche-lobe overflow,supporting the hypothesis that binarity mediates the formation of (a subset of)sgb[e] stars. the mass loss rate of wd1-9 is consistent with such an assertion,while viable progenitor and descendent systems are present within wd1 and otherexamples of sgb[e] binaries have previously been found. moreover, the rarity ofsgb[e] stars - only two examples are identified from a census of ~68 youngmassive galactic clusters and associations containing ~600 post-main sequencestars - is explicable given the rapidity (~10^4yr) expected for this phase ofmassive binary evolution.

1312.5597	astrophysical parameters of the peculiar x-ray transient igr j11215-5952	the hard x-ray source igr j11215-5952 is a peculiar transient, displayingvery short x-ray outbursts every 165 days. we obtained high-resolution spectraof the optical counterpart, hd 306414, at different epochs, spanning a total ofthree months, before and around the 2007 february outburst with the combinedaims of deriving its astrophysical parameters and searching for orbitalmodulation. we fit model atmospheres generated with the fastwind code to thespectrum. we also cross-correlated each individual spectrum to the best-fitmodel to derive radial velocities. from its spectral features, we classify hd306414 as b0.5 ia. from the model fit, we find teff = 24 700 k and log g = 2.7,in good agreement with the morphological classification. using the interstellarlines in its spectrum, we estimate a distance to hd 306414 d &gt; 7 kpc. assumingthis distance, we derive r* = 40 rsol and mspect = 30 msol (consistent, withinerrors, with mevol = 38 msol). radial velocity changes are not dominated by theorbital motion, and we find an upper limit on the semi-amplitude for theoptical component kopt &lt; 11 +- 6 km/s. large variations in the depth and shapeof photospheric lines suggest the presence of strong pulsations, which may bethe main cause of the radial velocity changes. very significant variations,uncorrelated with those of the photospheric lines are seen in the shape andposition of the halpha emission feature around the time of the x-ray outburst,but large excursions are also observed at other times. hd 306414 is a normalb0.5 ia supergiant. its radial velocity curve is dominated by an effect that isdifferent from binary motion, and is most likely stellar pulsations. the dataavailable suggest that the x-ray outbursts are caused by the close passage ofthe neutron star in a very eccentric orbit, perhaps leading to localised massoutflow.

1401.3711	a be-type star with a black hole companion	stellar-mass black holes have all been discovered through x-ray emission,which arises from the accretion of gas from their binary companions (this gasis either stripped from low-mass stars or supplied as winds from massive ones).binary evolution models also predict the existence of black holes accretingfrom the equatorial envelope of rapidly spinning be-type stars (stars of the betype are hot blue irregular variables showing characteristic spectral emissionlines of hydrogen). of the ~80 be x-ray binaries known in the galaxy, however,only pulsating neutron stars have been found as companions. a black hole wasformally allowed as a solution for the companion to the be star mwc 656 (alsoknown as hd 215227), although that was based on a single radial velocity curveof the be star, a mistaken spectral classification and rough estimates of theinclination angle. here we report observations of an accretion disk linemirroring the orbit of the be star. this, together with an improved radialvelocity curve of the be star through fitting sharp fe ii profiles from theequatorial disk, and a refined be classification (to that of a b1.5-b2 iiistar), reveals a black hole of 3.8 to 6.9 solar masses orbiting mwc 656, thecandidate counterpart of the gamma-ray source agl j2241+4454. the black hole isx-ray quiescent and fed by a radiatively inefficient accretion flow giving aluminosity less than 1.6 x 10-7 times the eddington luminosity. this impliesthat be binaries with black-hole companions are difficult to detect byconventional x-ray surveys.

1401.4437	the gaia-eso survey: radial metallicity gradients and age-metallicity  relation of stars in the milky way disk	we study the relationship between age, metallicity, and alpha-enhancement offgk stars in the galactic disk. the results are based upon the analysis ofhigh-resolution uves spectra from the gaia-eso large stellar survey. we explorethe limitations of the observed dataset, i.e. the accuracy of stellarparameters and the selection effects that are caused by the photometric targetpreselection. we find that the colour and magnitude cuts in the survey suppressold metal-rich stars and young metal-poor stars. this suppression may be ashigh as 97% in some regions of the age-metallicity relationship. the datasetconsists of 144 stars with a wide range of ages from 0.5 gyr to 13.5 gyr,galactocentric distances from 6 kpc to 9.5 kpc, and vertical distances from theplane 0 &lt; |z| &lt; 1.5 kpc. on this basis, we find that i) the observedage-metallicity relation is nearly flat in the range of ages between 0 gyr and8 gyr; ii) at ages older than 9 gyr, we see a decrease in [fe/h] and a clearabsence of metal-rich stars; this cannot be explained by the survey selectionfunctions; iii) there is a significant scatter of [fe/h] at any age; and iv)[mg/fe] increases with age, but the dispersion of [mg/fe] at ages &gt; 9 gyr isnot as small as advocated by some other studies. in agreement with earlierwork, we find that radial abundance gradients change as a function of verticaldistance from the plane. the [mg/fe] gradient steepens and becomes negative. inaddition, we show that the inner disk is not only more alpha-rich compared tothe outer disk, but also older, as traced independently by the ages and mgabundances of stars.

1403.4865	the gaia-eso survey: processing of the flames-uves spectra	the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey that aims toderive radial velocities and fundamental parameters of about 10^5 milky waystars in the field and in clusters. observations are carried out with themulti-object optical spectrograph flames, using simultaneously the mediumresolution (r~20,000) giraffe spectrograph and the high resolution (r~47,000)uves spectrograph. in this paper, we describe the methods and the software usedfor the data reduction, the derivation of the radial velocities, and thequality control of the flames-uves spectra. data reduction has been performedusing a workflow specifically developed for this project. this workflow runsthe eso public pipeline optimizing the data reduction for the gaia-eso survey,performs automatically sky subtraction, barycentric correction andnormalisation, and calculates radial velocities and a first guess of therotational velocities. the quality control is performed using the outputparameters from the eso pipeline, by a visual inspection of the spectra and bythe analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.  using the observations of the first 18 months, specifically targets observedmultiple times at different epochs, stars observed with both giraffe and uves,and observations of radial velocity standards, we estimated the precision andthe accuracy of the radial velocities. the statistical error on the radialvelocities is sigma~0.4 km s^-1 and is mainly due to uncertainties in the zeropoint of the wavelength calibration. however, we found a systematic bias withrespect to the giraffe spectra (~0.9 km s^-1) and to the radial velocities ofthe standard stars (~0.5 kms^-1) retrieved from the literature. this bias willbe corrected in the future data releases, when a common zero point for all thesetups and instruments used for the survey will be established.

1404.4341	astrophysical parameters and orbital solution of the peculiar x-ray  transient igr j00370+6122	bd+6073 is the optical counterpart of the x-ray source igr j00370+6122, aprobable accretion-powered x-ray pulsar. the x-ray light curve of this binarysystem shows clear periodicity at 15.7 d, which has been interpreted asrepeated outbursts around the periastron of an eccentric orbit. we obtainedhigh-resolution spectra of bd+6073 at different epochs. we used the fastwindcode to generate a stellar atmosphere model to fit the observed spectrum andobtain physical magnitudes. the synthetic spectrum was used as a template forcross-correlation with the observed spectra to measure radial velocities. theradial velocity curve provided an orbital solution for the system. we have alsoanalysed the rxte/asm and swift/bat light curves to confirm the stability ofthe periodicity. bd +6073 is a bn0.7 ib low-luminosity supergiant located at anapproximate distance of 3.1 kpc, in the casob4 association. we deriveteff=24000 k and log gc=3.0, and chemical abundances consistent with amoderately high level of evolution. the spectroscopic and evolutionary massesare consistent at the 1 sigma level with a mass of 15 solar masses. therecurrence time of the x-ray flares is the orbital period of the system. the nsis in a high eccentricity (e=0.56) orbit, and the x-ray emission is stronglypeaked around orbital phase 0.2, though the observations are consistent withsome level of x-ray activity happening at all orbital phases. the x-raybehaviour of igr j00370+6122 is reminiscent of intermediate sfxts, though itspeak luminosity is rather low. the orbit is somewhat wider than those ofclassical persistent supergiant x-ray binaries, which, combined with the lowluminosity of the mass donor, explains the low x-ray luminosity. igrj00370+6122 will likely evolve towards a persistent supergiant system,highlighting the evolutionary connection between different classes ofwind-accreting x-ray sources.

1405.3109	a vlt/flames survey for massive binaries in westerlund 1. iv. wd1-5 -  binary product and a pre-supernova companion for the magnetar cxou j1647-45?	the first soft gamma-ray repeater was discovered over three decades ago, andsubsequently identified as a magnetar. however there is currently no consenuson the formation channel(s) of these objects. the presence of a magnetar in thestarburst cluster westerlund 1 implies a &gt;40msun progenitor, favouringformation in a binary that was disrupted at supernova. to test this hypothesiswe searched for the putative pre-sn companion via a radial velocity survey toidentify high-velocity runaways, with subsequent atmospheric analysis of theresultant candidate, wd1-5. wd1-5 appears overluminous for its spectroscopicmass and we find evidence of he- and n-enrichment, o-depletion, and criticallyc-enrichment, a combination of properties that is difficult to explain for asingle star. we infer a pre-sn history for wd1-5 which supposes an initialclose binary comprising two stars of comparable (~41msun+35msun) masses.efficient mass transfer from the initially more massive component leads to themass-gainer evolving more rapidly, initiating luminous blue variable/commonenvelope evolution. reverse, wind-driven mass transfer during its subsequent wcwolf-rayet phase leads to the carbon pollution of wd1-5, before a type ibcsupernova disrupts the binary system. under the assumption of a physicalassociation between wd1-5 and j1647-45, the secondary is identified as themagnetar progenitor; its common envelope evolutionary phase prevents spin-downof its core prior to sn and the seed magnetic field for the magnetar formseither in this phase or during the earlier episode of mass transfer in which itwas spun-up. our results suggest that binarity is a key ingredient in theformation of at least a subset of magnetars by preventing spin-down viacore-coupling and potentially generating a seed magnetic field.

1405.7266	vdbh 222: a starburst cluster in the inner milky way	it has been suggested that the compact open cluster vdbh 222 is a youngmassive distant object. we set out to characterise vdbh 222 using acomprehensive set of multi-wavelength observations. we obtained multi-bandoptical (ubvr) and near-infrared (jhk) photometry of the cluster field, as wellas multi-object and long-slit optical spectroscopy for a large sample of starsin the field. we applied classical photometric analysis, as well as moresophisticated methods using the chorizos code, to determine the reddening tothe cluster. we then plotted dereddened hr diagrams and determined clusterparameters via isochrone fitting. we have identified a large population ofluminous supergiants confirmed as cluster members via radial velocitymeasurements. we find nine red supergiants (plus one other candidate) and twoyellow supergiants. we also identify a large population of ob stars. ten ofthem are bright enough to be blue supergiants. the cluster lies behind 7.5 magof extinction for the preferred value of rv of 2.9. isochrone fitting allowsfor a narrow range of ages between 12 and 16 ma. the cluster radial velocity iscompatible with distances of 6 and 10 kpc. the shorter distance is inconsistentwith the age range and galactic structure. the longer distance implies an ageof 12 ma and a location not far from the position where some galactic modelsplace the far end of the galactic bar. vdbh 222 is a young massive cluster witha likely mass greater than 20000 msolar . its population of massive evolvedstars is comparable to that of large associations, such as per ob1. itslocation in the inner galaxy, presumably close to the end of the galactic bar,adds to the increasing evidence for vigorous star formation in the innerregions of the milky way.

1503.03476	a coordinated x-ray and optical campaign of the nearest massive  eclipsing binary, $\delta$ orionis aa: iv. a multiwavelength, non-lte  spectroscopic analysis	eclipsing systems of massive stars allow one to explore the properties oftheir components in great detail. we perform a multi-wavelength, non-lteanalysis of the three components of the massive multiple system $\delta$ ori a,focusing on the fundamental stellar properties, stellar winds, and x-raycharacteristics of the system. the primary's distance-independent parametersturn out to be characteristic for its spectral type (o9.5 ii), but usage of the${\rm \it hipparcos}$ parallax yields surprisingly low values for the mass,radius, and luminosity. consistent values follow only if $\delta$ ori lies atabout twice the ${\rm \it hipparcos}$ distance, in the vicinity of the$\sigma$-orionis cluster. the primary and tertiary dominate the spectrum andleave the secondary only marginally detectable. we estimate the v-bandmagnitude difference between primary and secondary to be $\delta v \approx2.\!\!^{\rm m}8$. the inferred parameters suggest the secondary is an earlyb-type dwarf ($\approx$ b1 v), while the tertiary is an early b-type subgiant($\approx$ b0 iv). we find evidence for rapid turbulent velocities ($\sim 200$km ${\rm s}^{-1}$) and wind inhomogeneities, partially optically thick, in theprimary's wind. the bulk of the x-ray emission likely emerges from theprimary's stellar wind ($\log l_{\text{x}} / l_{\text{bol}} \approx -6.85$),initiating close to the stellar surface at $r_0 \sim 1.1\,r_*$. accounting forclumping, the mass-loss rate of the primary is found to be $\log \dot{m}\approx -6.4\,[m_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}]$, which agrees with hydrodynamicpredictions, and provides a consistent picture along the x-ray, uv, optical andradio spectral domains.

1504.03146	on the formation and evolution of the first be star in a black hole  binary mwc 656	we find that the formation of mwc 656 (the first be binary containing a blackhole) involves a common envelope phase and a supernova explosion. this resultsupports the idea that a rapidly rotating be star can emerge out of a commonenvelope phase, which is very intriguing because this evolutionary stage isthought to be too fast to lead to significant accretion and spin up of the bstar.  we predict $\sim 10-100$ of b bh binaries to currently reside in the galacticdisk, among which around $1/3$ contain a be star, but there is only a smallchance to observe a system with parameters resembling mwc 656. if mwc 656 isrepresentative of intrinsic galactic be bh binary population, it may indicatethat standard evolutionary theory needs to be revised. this would pose anotherevolutionary problem in understanding bh binaries, with bh x-ray novaeformation issue being the prime example.  the future evolution of mwc 656 with a $\sim 5$ m$_{\odot}$ black hole andwith a $\sim 13$ m$_{\odot}$ main sequence companion on a $\sim 60$ day orbitmay lead to the formation of a coalescing bh-ns system. the estimated advancedligo/virgo detection rate of such systems is up to $\sim 0.2$ yr$^{-1}$. thisempirical estimate is a lower limit as it is obtained with only one particularevolutionary scenario, the mwc 656 binary. this is only a third such estimateavailable (after cyg x-1 and cyg x-3), and it lends additional support to theexistence of so far undetected bh--ns binaries.

astro-ph;0002272	detection of x-ray pulsations from the be/x-ray transient a 0535+26  during a disc loss phase of the primary	using the rossixte experiment, we detect weak x-ray emission from therecurrent be/x-ray transient a 0535+26 at a time when the optical counterpartv725 tau displayed h-alpha in absorption, indicating the absence of acircumstellar disc. the x-ray radiation is strongly modulated at the 103.5-spulse period of the neutron star, confirming that it originates from a 0535+26.the source is weaker than in previous quiescence detections by two orders ofmagnitude and should be in the centrifugal inhibition regime. we show that thex-ray luminosity cannot be due to accretion on to the magnetosphere of theneutron star. therefore this detection represents a new state of the accretingpulsar. we speculate that the x-ray emission can be due to some matter leakingthrough the magnetospheric barrier or thermal radiation from the neutron starsurface due to crustal heating. the observed luminosity is probably compatiblewith recent predictions of thermal radiation from x-ray transients inquiescence. the detection of the x-ray source in the inhibition regime impliesa reduced density in the outflow from the be companion during its disc-lessphase.

astro-ph;0108037	a natural explanation for periodic x-ray outbursts in be/x-ray binaries	when applied to be/x-ray binaries, the viscous decretion disc model for bestars naturally predicts the truncation of the circumstellar disc. the distanceat which the circumstellar disc is truncated depends mainly on the orbitalparameters and the viscosity. in systems with low eccentricity, the disc isexpected to be truncated at the 3:1 resonance radius, for which the gap betweenthe disc outer radius and the critical lobe radius of the be star is so widethat, under normal conditions, the neutron star cannot accrete enough gas atperiastron passage to show type i x-ray outbursts. these systems will displayonly type ii x-ray outbursts. on the other hand, in systems with high orbitaleccentricity, the disc truncation occurs at a much higher resonance radius,which is very close to or slightly beyond the critical lobe radius atperiastron unless the viscosity is very low. in these systems, disc truncationcannot be efficient, allowing the neutron star to capture gas from the disc atevery periastron passage and display type i outbursts regularly. in contrast tothe rather robust results for systems with low eccentricity and higheccentricity, the result for systems with moderate eccentricity depends onrather subtle details. systems in which the disc is truncated in the vicinityof the critical lobe will regularly display type i outbursts, whereas thosewith the disc significantly smaller than the critical lobe will show only typeii outbursts under normal conditions and temporary type i outbursts when thedisc is strongly disturbed.

astro-ph;0510658	xte j1739-302 as a supergiant fast x-ray transient	xte j1739-302 is a transient x-ray source with unusually short outbursts,lasting on the order of hours. here we give a summary of x-ray observations wehave made of this object in outburst with the rossi x-ray timing explorer(rxte) and at a low level of activity with the chandra x-ray observatory, aswell as observations made by other groups. visible and infrared spectroscopy ofthe mass donor of xte j1739-302 are presented in a companion paper. the x-rayspectrum is hard both at low levels and in outburst, but somewhat variable, andthere is strong variability in the absorption column from one outburst toanother. although no pulsation has been observed, the outburst data frommultiple observatories show a characteristic timescale for variability on theorder of 1500-2000 s. the chandra localization (right ascension 17h 39m 11.58s,declination -30o 20' 37.6'', j2000) shows that despite being located less than2 degrees from the galactic center and highly absorbed, xte j1739-302 isactually a foreground object with a bright optical counterpart. the combinationof a very short outburst timescale and a supergiant companion is shared withseveral other recently-discovered systems, forming a class we designate assupergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts). three persistently bright x-raybinaries with similar supergiant companions have also produced extremely short,bright outbursts: cyg x-1, vela x-1, and 1e 1145.1-6141.

astro-ph;0511408	wind accretion in the massive x-ray binary 4u 2206+54: abnormally slow  wind and a moderately eccentric orbit	massive x-ray binaries are usually classified depending on the properties ofthe donor star in classical, supergiant and be x-ray binaries. the massivex-ray binary 4u 2206+54 does not fit in any of these groups, and deserves adetailed study to understand how the transfer of matter and the accretion on tothe compact object take place. to this end we study an iue spectrum of thedonor and obtain a wind terminal velocity (v_inf) of ~350 km/s, which isabnormally slow for its spectral type. we also analyse here more than 9 yearsof available rxte/asm data. we study the long-term x-ray variability of thesource and find it to be similar to that observed in the wind-fed supergiantsystem vela x-1, reinforcing the idea that 4u 2206+54 is also a wind-fedsystem. we find a quasi-period decreasing from ~270 to ~130 d, noticed inprevious works but never studied in detail. we discuss possible scenarios andconclude that long-term quasi-periodic variations in the mass-loss rate of theprimary are probably driving such variability in the measured x-ray flux. weobtain an improved orbital period of 9.5591 d with maximum x-ray flux at mjd51856.6. our study of the orbital x-ray variability in the context of windaccretion suggests a moderate eccentricity around 0.15. moreover, the low valueof v_inf solves the long-standing problem of the relatively high x-rayluminosity for the unevolved nature of the donor, bd +53 2790, which isprobably an o9.5 v star. we note that changes in v_inf and/or the mass-lossrate of the primary alone cannot explain the diferent patterns displayed by theorbital x-ray variability. we finally emphasize that 4u 2206+54, together withls 5039, could be part of a new population of wind-fed hmxbs with main sequencedonors, the natural progenitors of supergiant x-ray binaries.

astro-ph;0611516	the be/x-ray transient 4u 0115+63/v635 cassiopeiae. iii. quasi-cyclic  variability	4u 0115+63 is one of the most active and best studied be/x-ray transients.previous studies of 4u0115+63 have led to the suggestion that it undergoesrelatively fast quasi-cyclic activity. however, due to the lack of goodcoverage of the observations, the variability time scales are uncertain. ourobjective is to investigate the long-term behaviour of 4u 0115+63 to confirmits quasi-cyclic nature and to explain its correlated optical/ir and x-rayvariability. we have performed optical/ir photometric observations and opticalspectroscopic observations of 4u 0115+63 over the last decade withunprecedented coverage. we have focused on the halpha line variability and thelong-term changes of the photometric magnitudes and colours and investigatedthese changes in correlation with the x-ray activity of the source. results theoptical and infrared emission is characterised by cyclic changes with a periodof ~ 5 years. this long-term variability is attributed to the state of thecircumstellar disc around the be star companion. each cycle involves a lowstate when the disc is very weak or absent and the associated low amplitudevariability is orbitally modulated and a high state when a perturbed discprecesses, giving rise to fast and large amplitude photometric changes. x-rayoutbursts in 4u 0115+63 come in pairs, i.e., two in every cycle. however,sometimes the second outburst is missing. our results can be explained withinthe framework of the decretion disc model. the neutron star acts as theperturbing body, truncating and distorting the disc. the first outburst wouldoccur before the disc is strongly perturbed. the second outburst leads to thedispersal of the disc and marks the end of the perturbed phase.

astro-ph;0703499	exploring the connection between the stellar wind and the non-thermal  emission in ls 5039	ls 5039 has been observed with several x-ray instruments so far. the sourcepresents x-ray variability at orbital timescales in flux and photon index. thesystem harbors an o-type main sequence star with moderate mass loss. atpresent, the link between the x-rays and the stellar wind is unclear. newxmm-newton observations have been performed around periastron and apastronpassages in september 2005, when the stellar wind activity was apparentlyhigher. april 2005 chandra observations on ls 5039 are also revisited.moreover, a compilation of halpha ew data obtained since 1992, from which thestellar mass loss evolution can be approximately inferred, is carried out.xmm-newton observations show higher and harder emission around apastron thanaround periastron. no signatures of thermal emission or a reflection iron lineindicating the presence of an accretion disk are found in the spectrum, and thehydrogen column density (nh) is compatible with being the same in bothobservations and consistent with the interstellar value. 2005 chandraobservations show a hard x-ray spectrum, and possibly high fluxes. the halphaew shows yearly variations of a ~ 10%, and does not seem to be correlated withx-ray fluxes obtained at similar phases, unlike it would be expected in thewind accretion scenario. 2005 xmm-newton and chandra observations areconsistent with 2003 rxte/pca results. the constancy of the nh seems to implythat either the x-ray emitter is located at &gt;~ 1012 cm from the compact object,or the real n_h is 3-27 times smaller than the one predicted by a sphericalsymmetric wind model. we suggest that the multiwavelength non-thermal emissionof ls 5039 is related to the radio jets and unlikely produced inside the binarysystem.

astro-ph;9802086	optical spectroscopy of v635 cassiopeiae/4u 0115+63	v635 cas is the optical counterpart of the x-ray binary system 4u 0115+63. itwas previously tentatively identified as a be star based on its optical coloursand the presence of h alpha emission. our observations indicate that it is ano9e star. this is the first direct determination of this star's opticalspectral type. the presence of a hotter companion star may in part explain thelarge temporal variation observed in this system.  extreme variability was observed in 1992 february when both the h alpha and aseries of paschen lines changed from emission to absorption. this wasinterpreted as a disk-loss event and it is the first time that it has beenobserved in this system. we use far red spectra of v635 cas to probe thecircumstellar disk, discussing the various line formation regions. the linesobserved are consistent with a late type oe star.  the flux standard hiltner 102 was also observed. although it is classified asa b0 iii star, we re-classify it as a o9.7 ii star with a slight nitrogenenhancement.

astro-ph;9804307	large-scale perturbations in the circumstellar envelopes of be/x-ray  binaries	we investigate the spectroscopic characteristics of the optical components ofbe/x-ray binary systems, using data collected during our seven-year monitoringcampaign. we find examples of major changes in the emission line profilesassociated with type ii x-ray outbursts, later developing into v/r variabilitycycles. we show that the time-scales for v/r variability in be/x-ray transientsextend from a few weeks to years and interpret all these changes as due to thepresence of global disruptions of the axisymmetric density distribution in theextended envelopes of the be stars in these systems. the association betweenx-ray outbursts and v/r variability, the occurrence of very fast changes andthe very short quasi-periods of variability displayed by be/x-ray binaries leadus to conclude that the presence of the neutron star is an important factoraffecting the dynamics of the disc-like envelopes. the interaction between thecompact companion and the disc would explain the correlation between h-alphastrength and orbital period recently found. the characteristics of the v/rcycles are, however, mainly independent of the binary parameters.

0812.2365	discovery of slow x-ray pulsations in the high-mass x-ray binary 4u  2206+54	the source 4u 2206+54 is one of the most enigmatic high-mass x-ray binaries.in spite of intensive searches, x-ray pulsations have not been detected in thetime range 0.001-1000 s. a cyclotron line at ~30 kev has been suggested byvarious authors but never detected with significance. the stellar wind of theoptical companion is abnormally slow. the orbital period, initially reported tobe 9.6 days, disappeared and a new periodicity of 19.25 days emerged. our newlong and uninterrupted rxte observations allow us to search for long (~1 hr)pulsations for the first time. we have discovered 5560-s pulsations in thelight curve of 4u 2206+54. initially detected in rxte data, these pulsationsare also present in integral and exosat observations. the average x-rayluminosity in the energy range 2-10 kev is 1.5 x 10^{35} erg s^{-1} with aratio fmax/fmin ~ 5. this ratio implies an eccentricity of ~0.4, somewhathigher than previously suggested. the source also shows a soft excess at lowenergies. if the soft excess is modelled with a blackbody component, then thesize and temperature of the emitting region agrees with its interpretation interms of a hot spot on the neutron star surface. the source displaysvariability on time scales of days, presumably due to changes in the massaccretion rate as the neutron star moves around the optical companion in amoderately eccentric orbit.
