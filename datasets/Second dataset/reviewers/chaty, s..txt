0901.3576	vlt/naco near-infrared observations of the transient radio magnetar 1e  1547.0-5408	despite about a decade of observations, very little is known about theoptical and infrared (ir) emission properties of the soft gamma-ray repeaters(sgrs) and of the anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps), the magnetar candidates, andabout the physical processes which drive their emission at these wavelengths.this is mainly due to the limited number of identifications achieved so far,five in total, and to the sparse spectral coverage obtained from multi-bandoptical/ir photometry. aim of this work is to search for a likely candidatecounterpart to the recently discovered transient radio axp 1e 1547.0-5408. weperformed the first deep near-ir (nir) observations (ks band) of 1e 1547.0-5408with the vlt on three nights (july 8th, 12th, and august 17th), after the x-raysource rebrightening and during the subsequent decay reported around june 2007.we detected four objects within, or close to, the 3sigma radio position of 1e1547.0-5408. the faintest of them (object 1) has a brightness k = 20.27 +/-0.05, which would yield an unabsorbed x-ray to nir flux ratio fx/fks ~ 800 for1e 1547.0-5408, i.e. on average lower than those derived for other magnetars.the non-detection of object 1 on the nights of july 8th and august 17th onlyallowed us to set an upper limit of delta ks ~ 0.2 on its nir variability,which prevented us to search for correlations with the radio or x-ray flux. wedetected no other object at the radio position down to a limit of ks ~ 21.7 (at5sigma), computed in our deepest vlt image (july 12th). from our observationswe can not confidently propose a nir counterpart to 1e 1547.0-5408. more nirobservations of object 1, e.g. to determine its colors and to monitorvariability, would be conclusive to determine whether or not it can beconsidered a plausible candidate.

0903.4714	detailed radio to soft gamma-ray studies of the 2005 outburst of the new  x-ray transient xte j1818-245	xte j1818-245 is an x-ray nova that experienced an outburst in 2005, firstseen by the rxte satellite. the source was observed simultaneously at variouswavelengths up to soft gamma-rays with the integral satellite, from 2005february to september. x-ray novae are extreme systems that often harbor ablack hole, and are known to emit throughout the electromagnetic spectrum whenin outburst. we analyzed radio, (n)ir, optical, x-ray and soft gamma-rayobservations and constructed simultaneous broad-band x-ray spectra. analyzingboth the light curves in various energy ranges and the hardness-intensitydiagram enabled us to study the long-term behavior of the source. spectralparameters were typical of the soft intermediate states and the high softstates of a black hole candidate. the source showed relatively small spectralvariations in x-rays with considerable flux variation in radio. spectralstudies showed that the accretion disc cooled down from 0.64 to 0.27 kev in 100days and that the total flux decreased while the relative flux of the hotmedium increased. radio emission was detected several times, and,interestingly, five days after entering the hss. modeling the spectral energydistribution from the radio to the soft gamma-rays reveals that the radioflares arise from several ejection events. xte j1818-245 is likely a black holecandidate transient source that might be closer than the galactic bulge. theresults from the data analysis trace the physical changes that took place inthe system at a maximum bolometric luminosity of (0.4-0.9)e38 erg/s (assuming adistance between 2.8-4.3 kpc) and they are discussed within the context of discand jet models.

1003.0317	suzaku observation of grs 1915+105: evolution of accretion disc  structure during limit-cycle oscillation	we present results from the suzaku observation of the microquasar grs1915+105 performed during the 2005 october multiwavelength campaign. the datainclude both stable state (class \chi) and limit-cycle oscillation (class\theta). correct interstellar absorption as well as effects of dust scatteringare fully taken into account in the spectral analysis. the energy spectra inthe 2-120 kev band in both states are all dominated by strong comptonization ofdisk photons by an optically thick (\tau ~7-10) and low temperature (t_e ~2-3kev) hybrid plasmas containing non-thermal electrons produced with 10-60% ofthe total power input. absorption lines of highly ionized fe ions detectedduring the oscillation indicate that a strong disk wind is developed. theionization stage of the wind correlates with the x-ray flux, supporting thephotoionization origin. the iron-k emission line shows a strong variabilityduring the oscillation; the reflection is strongest during the dip butdisappears during the flare. we interpret this as evidence for "self-shielding"that the comptonizing corona becomes geometrically thick in the flare phase,preventing photons from irradiating the outer disk. the low-temperature andhigh luminosity disk emission suggests that the disk structure is similar tothat in the very high state of canonical black hole binaries. the spectralvariability during the oscillation is explained by the change of the diskgeometry and of the physical parameters of comptonizing corona, particularlythe fractional power supplied to the acceleration of non-thermal particles.

1004.3032	long-term multi-wavelength studies of grs 1915+105 i. a high-energy and  mid-infrared focus with rxte, integral, and spitzer	to date, mid-infrared properties of galactic black hole binaries have barelybeen investigated in the framework of multi-wavelength campaigns. yet, studiesin this spectral domain are crucial to get complementary information on thepresence of dust and/or on the physical processes such as dust heating andthermal bremsstrahlung. here, we report a long-term multi-wavelength study ofthe microquasar grs 1915+105. on the one hand, we aimed at understanding theorigins of the mid-infrared emission, and on the other hand, at searching forcorrelation with the high-energy and/or radio activities. we observed thesource at several epochs between 2004 and 2006 with the photometer irac andspectrometer irs, both mounted on the spitzer space telescope. when available,we completed our set of data with quasi-simultaneous rxte and integralhigh-energy and/or ryle radio observations from public archives. we thenstudied the mid-infrared environment and activities of grs 1915+105 throughspectral analysis and broad band fitting of its radio to x-ray spectral energydistributions. we detected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules in all butone irs spectra of grs 1915+105 which unambiguously proves the presence of adust component, likely photoionised by the high-energy emission. we also arguethat this dust is distributed in a disc-like structure heated by the companionstar, as observed in some herbig ae/be and isolated cool giant stars. moreover,we show that some of the soft x-ray emission emanating from the inner regionsof the accretion disc is reprocessed and thermalised in the outer part. thisleads to a mid-infrared excess that is very likely correlated to the soft x-rayemission. we exclude thermal bremsstrahlung as contributing significantly inthis spectral domain.

1402.0524	coronal origin of the polarization of the high-energy emission of cygnus  x-1	cygnus x-1 is the candidate with the highest probability of containing ablack hole among the x-ray binary systems in the galaxy. it is also by far themost often studied of these objects. recently, the international gamma-rayastrophysics laboratory imager onboard then integral satellite ({\itintegral}/ibis) detected strong polarization in the high-energy radiation ofthis source, between 400 kev and 2 mev. this radiation has been attributed to ajet launched by the black hole. we consider whether the corona around the blackhole might be the site of production of the polarized emission instead of thejet. we studied self-consistently the injection of nonthermal particles in thehot, magnetized plasma around the black hole. we show that both the high-energyspectrum and polarization of cygnus x-1 in the low-hard state can originate inthe corona, without needing to invoke a jet. we estimate the degree ofpolarization in the intermediate state, where there is no jet, to provide atool to test our model. contrary to the commonly accepted view, the jet mightnot be the source of the mev polarized tail in the spectrum of cygnus x-1.

1410.8493	jet-induced star formation by a microquasar	theoretical and observational work show that jets from agn can trigger starformation. however, in the milky way the first -and so far- only clear case ofrelativistic jets inducing star formation has been found in the surroundings ofthe microquasar grs 1915+105. here we summarize the multiwavelengthobservations of two compact star formation iras sources axisymmetricallylocated and aligned with the position angle of the sub-arcsec relativistic jetsfrom the stellar black hole binary grs 1915+105 (mirabel &amp; rodriguez 1994). theobservations of these two star forming regions at centimeter (rodriguez &amp;mirabel 1998), millimeter and infrared (chaty et al. 2001) wavelengths hadsuggested -despite the large uncertainties in the distances a decade ago- thatthe jets from grs 1915+105 are triggering along the radio jet axis theformation of massive stars in a radio lobe of bow shock structure. recently,reid et al.(2014) found that the jet source and the iras sources are at thesame distance, enhancing the evidence for the physical association between thejets from grs 1915+105 and star formation in the iras sources. we conclude thatas jets from agn, jets from microquasars can trigger the formation of massivestars, but at distances of a few tens of parsecs. although star formationinduced by microquasar jets may not be statistically significant in the milkyway, jets from stellar black holes may have been important to trigger starformation during the re-ionization epoch of the universe (mirabel et al. 2011).because of the relative proximity of grs 1915+105 and the associated starforming regions, they may serve as a nearby laboratory to gain insight into thephysics of jet-trigger star formation elsewhere in the universe.

(2001). we then discuss the nature of this system, showing that thecompanion star is either a b3-a2 main sequence star, or a b3-a2 sub-giantcrossing the hertzsprung gap. the system is therefore an intermediate or highmass x-ray binary system (imxb or hmxb). the distance derived by theseoptical/nir observations implies that the jets observed by hjellming et al.(2000) would then exhibit apparent velocities of ~ 10 c. we finally discuss thepossibility of an interaction between the jets and surroundings of the source,and also of this source being a ``microblazar''.

astro-ph;0306626	the remarkable rapid x-ray, ultraviolet, optical, and ir variability in  the black hole xte j1118+480	the transient black hole binary xte j1118+480 exhibited dramatic rapidvariability at all wavelengths which were suitably observed during its 2000april-july outburst. we examine time-resolved x-ray, ultraviolet, optical, andinfrared data spanning the plateau phase of the outburst. we find that bothx-ray and infrared bands show large amplitude variability. the ultraviolet andoptical variability is more subdued, but clearly correlated with that seen inthe x-rays. the ultraviolet, at least, appears to be dominated by thecontinuum, although the lines are also variable. using the x-ray variations asa reference point, we find that the uv variability at long wavelengths occurslater than that at short wavelengths. uncertainty in hst timing prohibits adetermination of the absolute lag with respect to the x-rays, however. thetransfer function is clearly not a delta-function, exhibiting significantrepeatable structure. for the main signal we can rule out an origin inreprocessing on the companion star - the lack of variation in the lags is notconsistent with this given a relatively high orbital inclination. weakreprocessing from the disc and/or companion star may be present, but is notrequired, and another component must dominate the variability. this could bevariable synchrotron emission correlated with x-ray variability, consistentwith our earlier interpretation of the ir flux as due to synchrotron emissionrather than thermal disc emission. in fact the broad-band energy distributionof the variability from ir to x-rays is consistent with expectations ofoptically thin synchrotron emission. we also follow the evolution of thelow-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation in x-rays, uv, and optical. itsproperties at all wavelengths are similar indicating a common origin.

astro-ph;0309047	multiwavelength observations revealing the evolution of the outburst of  the black hole xte j1118+480	we report multiwavelength observations of the soft x-ray transient (sxt) xtej1118+480, which we observed with ukirt, hst, rxte, euve and many otherinstruments and facilities. adding radio (ryle telescope, vla), sub-millimeter(jcmt) and x-ray (chandra and sax) data from the literature, we assembled themost complete spectral energy distribution (sed) of this source yet published.we followed the evolution of this source for 1 year, including 6 observationsperformed during the outburst, and one observation at the end of the outburst.because of xte j1118+480's unusually high galactic latitude, it suffers fromvery low extinction, and its sed is near-complete, including euv (extremeultraviolet) observations. xte j1118+480 exhibits an unusually low low-hardstate (estimated inner radius 350rs) and a strong non-thermal contribution inthe radio to optical domain, which is likely to be due to synchrotron emission.we discuss the interstellar column density and show that it is low, between0.80 and 1.30 x 10^20 cm-2. we analyse the evolution of the sed during theoutburst, including the contributions from the companion star, the accretiondisc, the outflow, and relating irradiation and variability of the source indifferent bands to the sed. we find no significant spectral variability duringthe outburst evolution, consistent with the presence of a steady outflow.analysis of its outflow to accretion energy ratio suggests that the microquasarxte j1118+480 is analogous to radio-quiet quasars. this, combined with theinverted spectrum from radio to optical, makes xte j1118+480 very similar toother microquasar sources, e.g. grs 1915+105 and gx 339-4 in their low/hardstate. we model the high-energy emission with a hot disc model, and discussdifferent accretion models for xte j1118+480's broad band spectrum.

astro-ph;0408407	the optical/nir counterpart of the integral obscured source igr  j16318-4848 : a sgb[e] in a hmxb ?	the x-ray source igr j16318-4848 was the first source discovered by integral.the high energy spectrum exhibits such a high column density that the source isundetectable in x-rays below 2 kev. we used the ntt telescope of eso to obtainoptical and near-infrared (nir) observations. we confirm the already proposednir counterpart and for the first time extended detection into optical. wereport here photometric measurements in the r, i, j, bands, upper flux limitsin the bb and v bands, lower flux limits in the h and ks bands. we also obtainnir spectroscopy, revealing a large number of emission lines, includingforbidden iron lines and p-cygni profiles, and showing a strong similarity withci cam, another strongly absorbed source. these data point to a highluminosity, high temperature source, with an intrinsic optical-nir absorptiongreater than the interstellar absorption, but two orders of magnitude below thex-ray absorption. we propose that the source is a high mass x-ray binary (hmxb)at a distance between 0.9 and 6.2 kpc, the optical/nir counterpart correspondsto the mass donor, which is an early-type star, maybe a sgb[e] star, surroundedby a dense and absorbing circumstellar material. this would make the secondhmxb with a sgb[e] star as the mass donor after ci cam. such sources mayrepresent a different evolutionary state of x-ray binaries previouslyundetected with the lower energy space telescopes ; if it is so, a new class ofstrongly absorbed x-ray binaries is being unveiled by integral.

astro-ph;0511725	bimodal spectral variability of cygnus x-1 in an intermediate state	we report the results of an observation of cygnus x-1 with integral, that wecombine with simultaneous radio observations with the ryle telescope. bothspectral and variability properties of the source indicate that cygnus x-1 wasin an intermediate state. the integral spectrum shows a high-energy cut-off orbreak around 100 kev. the shape of this cut-off differs from pure thermalcomptonisation, suggesting the presence of a non-thermal component at higherenergies.the average broad band spectrum is well represented by hybridthermal/non-thermal comptonisation models. during the 4 day long observationthe source showed an important spectral and flux variability. a principalcomponent analysis demonstrates that most of this variability occurs through 2independent modes. the first mode consists in changes in the overall luminosityon time scale of hours with almost constant spectra that are strikinglyuncorrelated with the variable radio flux. we interpret this variability modeas variations of the dissipation rate in the corona. the second variabilitymode consists in a pivoting of the spectrum around 10 kev. it acts on a longertime-scale: initially soft, the spectrum hardens in the first part of theobservation and then softens again. this pivoting pattern is stronglycorrelated with the radio (15 ghz) emission: radio fluxes are stronger when theintegral spectrum is harder. we propose that the pivoting mode represents a'mini' state transition from a nearly high soft state to a nearly low hardstate, and back. this mini-transition would be caused by changes in the softcooling photons flux in the hot comptonising plasma associated with an increaseof the temperature of the accretion disc. the jet power then appears to beanti-correlated with the disc luminosity and unrelated to the coronal power.

0809.1076	integral sources: from obscured high mass x-ray binaries to supergiant  fast x-ray transients	a new type of high-energy binary system has been revealed by the integralsatellite. these sources are being unveiled by means of multi-wavelengthoptical, near- and mid-infrared observations. among these sources, two distinctclasses are appearing: the first one is constituted of intrinsically obscuredhigh-energy sources, of which igr j16318-4848 seems to be the most extremeexample. the second one is populated by the so-called supergiant fast x-raytransients, with igr j17544-2619 being the archetype. we first give here ageneral introduction on integral sources, before reporting on multi-wavelengthoptical to mid-infrared observations of a sample constituted of 21 integralsources. we show that in the case of the obscured sources our observationssuggest the presence of absorbing material (dust and/or cold gas) enshroudingthe whole binary system. we finally discuss the nature of these two differenttypes of sources, in the context of high energy binary systems, and give ascenario of unification of all these different types of high energy sources,based on their high energy properties.

astro-ph;9910237	iso observations of the environment of the soft gamma-ray repeater sgr  1806-20	observations at near and mid-infrared wavelengths (1-18 micron) of sgr1806-20 suggest that it is associated with a cluster of giant massive starswhich are enshrouded in a dense cloud of dust. the centre of the best skyposition of the gamma-ray source (hurley et al. 1999) lies on top of the dustcloud at only 7 arcsec (~0.5 pc at a distance of 14.5 kpc) from the starcluster, and 12 arcsec (~0.85 pc) from a luminous blue variable star (lbv)which had been proposed to be associated with the sgr (kulkarni et al. 1995).the bright cloud of interstellar gas and dust observed with iso (infrared spaceobservatory) is probably the birth site of the cluster of massive stars, thelbv star, and the progenitor of the soft gamma-ray repeater pulsar. thepresence of such a young star formation region is compatible with the currentinterpretation of soft gamma-ray repeaters as young neutron stars. the sgr1806-20 compact source is unlikely to form a bound binary system with any ofthe infrared luminous massive stars, since no flux variations in thenear-infrared were detected from the latter in an interval of 4 years.the isoobservations were made over two epochs, 11 days before and 2 hours after a softgamma-ray burst detected with the interplanetary network, and they show noenhanced mid-infrared emission associated to the high energy activity of thesgr.
