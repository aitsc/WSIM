1105.4176	the first detection of blue straggler stars in the milky way bulge	we report the first detections of blue straggler stars (bss) in the bulge ofthe milky way galaxy. proper motions from extensive space-based observationsalong a single sight-line allow us to separate a sufficiently clean andwell-characterized bulge sample that we are able to detect a small populationof bulge objects in the region of the color-magnitude diagram commonly occupiedyoung objects and blue strgglers. however, variability measurements of theseobjects clearly establish that a fraction of them are blue stragglers. out ofthe 42 objects found in this region of the color-magnitude diagram, we estimatethat at least 18 are genuine bss. we normalize the bss population by ourestimate of the number of horizontal branch stars in the bulge in order tocompare the bulge to other stellar systems. the bss fraction is clearlydiscrepant from that found in stellar clusters. the blue straggler populationof dwarf spheroidals remains a subject of debate; some authors claim ananticorrelation between the normalised blue straggler fraction and integratedlight. if this trend is real, then the bulge may extend it by three orders ofmagnitude in mass. conversely, we find that the genuinely young (~5gy oryounger) population in the bulge, must be at most 3.4% under the mostconservative scenario for the bss population.

1107.5360	mapping the x-shaped milky way bulge	we analyzed the distribution of the rc stars throughout galactic bulge using2mass data. we mapped the position of the red clump in 1 sq.deg. size fieldswithin the area |l|&lt;=8.5deg and $3.5deg&lt;=|b|&lt;=8.5deg, for a total of 170sq.deg. the red clump seen single in the central area splits into twocomponents at high galactic longitudes in both hemispheres, produced by twostructures at different distances along the same line of sight. the x-shape isclearly visible in the z-x plane for longitudes close to $l=0 deg axis. crudemeasurements of the space densities of rc stars in the bright and faint rcpopulations are consistent with the adopted rc distances, providing furthersupporting evidence that the x-structure is real, and that there is approximatefront-back symmetry in our bulge fields. we conclude that the milky way bulgehas an x-shaped structure within $|l|&lt;~2deg, seen almost edge on with respectto the line of sight. additional deep nir photometry extending into theinnermost bulge regions combined with spectroscopic data is needed in order todiscriminate among the different possibilities that can cause the observedx-shaped structure.

1202.0446	a planetary system around the nearby m dwarf gj 667c with at least one  super-earth in its habitable zone	we re-analyze 4 years of harps spectra of the nearby m1.5 dwarf gj 667cavailable through the eso public archive. the new radial velocity (rv)measurements were obtained using a new data analysis technique that derives thedoppler measurement and other instrumental effects using a least-squaresapproach. combining these new 143 measurements with 41 additional rvs from themagellan/pfs and keck/hires spectrometers, reveals 3 additional signals beyondthe previously reported 7.2-day candidate, with periods of 28 days, 75 days,and a secular trend consistent with the presence of a gas giant (period sim 10years). the 28-day signal implies a planet candidate with a minimum mass of 4.5mearth orbiting well within the canonical definition of the star's liquid waterhabitable zone, this is, the region around the star at which an earth-likeplanet could sustain liquid water on its surface. still, the ultimate watersupporting capability of this candidate depends on properties that are unknownsuch as its albedo, atmospheric composition and interior dynamics. the 75-daysignal is less certain, being significantly affected by aliasing interactionsamong a potential 91-day signal, and the likely rotation period of the star at105 days detected in two activity indices. gj 667c is the common proper motioncompanion to the gj 667ab binary, which is metal poor compared to the sun. thepresence of a super-earth in the habitable zone of a metal poor m dwarf in atriple star system, supports the evidence that such worlds should be ubiquitousin the galaxy.

1311.0760	investigating potential planetary nebula/cluster pairs	fundamental parameters characterizing the end-state of intermediate-massstars may be constrained by discovering planetary nebulae (pne) in openclusters (ocs). cluster membership may be exploited to establish the distance,luminosity, age, and physical size for pne, and the intrinsic luminosity andmass of its central star. four potential pn-oc associations were investigated,to assess the cluster membership for the pne. radial velocities were measuredfrom intermediate-resolution optical spectra, complemented with previousestimates in the literature. when the radial velocity study supported the pn/ocassociation, we analyzed if other parameters (e.g., age, distance, reddening,central star brightness) were consistent with this conclusion. our measurementsimply that the pne vbe3 and hefa1 are not members of the ocs ngc5999 andngc6067, respectively, and likely belong to the background bulge population.conversely, consistent radial velocities indicate that ngc2452/ngc2453 could beassociated, but our results are not conclusive and additional observations arewarranted. finally, we demonstrate that all the available information point tohe2-86 being a young, highly internally obscured pn member of ngc4463. newnear-infrared photometry acquired via the vista variables in the via lactea esopublic survey was used in tandem with existing ubv photometry to measure thedistance, reddening, and age of ngc4463, finding d=1.55+-0.10 kpc,e(b-v)=0.41+-0.02, and tau=65+-10 myr, respectively. the same values should beadopted for the pn if the proposed cluster membership will be confirmed.

1510.01321	interstellar extinction curve variations toward the inner milky way: a  challenge to observational cosmology	we investigate interstellar extinction curve variations toward $\sim$4deg$^{2}$ of the inner milky way in $vijk_{s}$ photometry from the ogle-iii and$vvv$ surveys, with supporting evidence from diffuse interstellar bands and$f435w,f625w$ photometry. we obtain independent measurements toward $\sim$2,000sightlines of $a_{i}$, $e(v-i)$, $e(i-j)$, and $e(j-k_{s})$, with medianprecision and accuracy of 2%. we find that the variations in the extinctionratios $a_{i}/e(v-i)$, $e(i-j)/e(v-i)$ and $e(j-k_{s})/e(v-i)$ are large(exceeding 20%), significant, and positively correlated, as expected. however,both the mean values and the trends in these extinction ratios are drasticallyshifted from the predictions of cardelli and fitzpatrick, regardless of how$r_{v}$ is varied. furthermore, we demonstrate that variations in the shape ofthe extinction curve has at least two degrees of freedom, and not one (e.g.$r_{v}$), which we conform with a principal component analysis. we derive amedian value of $&lt;a_{v}/a_{ks}&gt;=13.44$, which is $\sim$60% higher than the"standard" value. we show that the wesenheit magnitude $w_{i}=i-1.61(i-j)$ isrelatively impervious to extinction curve variations.  given that these extinction curves are linchpins of observational cosmology,and that it is generally assumed that $r_{v}$ variations correctly capturevariations in the extinction curve, we argue that systematic errors in thedistance ladder from studies of type ia supernovae and cepheids may have beenunderestimated. moreover, the reddening maps from the planck experiment areshown to systematically overestimate dust extinction by $\sim$100%, and lacksensitivity to extinction curve variations.

1511.00835	iau commission 37 "star clusters and associations" legacy report	it is widely accepted that stars do not form in isolation but result from thefragmentation of molecular clouds, which in turn leads to star clusterformation. over time, clusters dissolve or are destroyed by interactions withmolecular clouds or tidal stripping, and their members become part of thegeneral field population. star clusters are thus among the basic buildingblocks of galaxies. in turn, star cluster populations, from young associationsand open clusters to old globulars, are powerful tracers of the formation,assembly, and evolutionary history of their parent galaxies. although theirimportance had been recognised for decades, major progress in this area hasonly become possible in recent years, both for galactic and extragalacticcluster populations. star clusters are the observational foundation for stellarastrophysics and evolution, provide essential tracers of galactic structure,and are unique stellar dynamical environments. star formation, stellarstructure, stellar evolution, and stellar nucleosynthesis continue to benefitand improve tremendously from the study of these systems. additionally,fundamental quantities such as the initial mass function can be successfullyderived from modelling either the h-r diagrams or the integrated velocitystructures of, respectively, resolved and unresolved clusters and clusterpopulations. star cluster studies thus span the fields of galactic andextragalactic astrophysics, while heavily affecting our detailed understandingof the process of star formation in dense environments.this report highlightsscience results of the last decade in the major fields covered by iaucommission 37: star clusters and associations.

1511.02826	the araucaria project: a study of the classical cepheid in the eclipsing  binary system ogle lmc562.05.9009 in the large magellanic cloud	we present a detailed study of the classical cepheid in the double-lined,highly eccentric eclipsing binary system ogle-lmc562.05.9009. the cepheid is afundamental mode pulsator with a period of 2.988 days. the orbital period ofthe system is 1550 days. using spectroscopic data from three 4-8-m telescopesand photometry spanning 22 years, we were able to derive the dynamical massesand radii of both stars with exquisite accuracy. both stars in the system arevery similar in mass, radius and color, but the companion is a stable,non-pulsating star. the cepheid is slightly more massive and bigger (m_1 = 3.70+/- 0.03m_sun, r_1 = 28.6 +/- 0.2r_sun) than its companion (m_2 = 3.60 +/-0.03m_sun, r_2 = 26.6 +/- 0.2r_sun). within the observational uncertaintiesboth stars have the same effective temperature of 6030 +/- 150k. evolutionarytracks place both stars inside the classical cepheid instability strip, but itis likely that future improved temperature estimates will move the stable giantcompanion just beyond the red edge of the instability strip. within currentobservational and theoretical uncertainties, both stars fit on a 205 myrisochrone arguing for their common age. from our model, we determine a value ofthe projection factor of p = 1.37 +/- 0.07 for the cepheid in theogle-lmc562.05.9009 system. this is the second cepheid for which we couldmeasure its p-factor with high precision directly from the analysis of aneclipsing binary system, which represents an important contribution towards abetter calibration of baade-wesselink methods of distance determination forcepheids.

astro-ph;0001477	the elliptical galaxy formerly known as the local group: merging the  globular cluster systems	prompted by a new catalogue of m31 globular clusters, we have collectedtogether individual metallicity values for globular clusters in the localgroup. although we briefly describe the globular cluster systems of theindividual local group galaxies, the main thrust of our paper is to examine thecollective properties. in this way we are simulating the dissipationless mergerof the local group, into presumably an elliptical galaxy. such a merger isdominated by the milky way and m31, which appear to be fairly typical examplesof globular cluster systems of spiral galaxies.  the local group `elliptical' has about 700 +/- 125 globular clusters, with aluminosity function resembling the `universal' one. the metallicitydistribution has peaks at [fe/h] ~ -1.55 and -0.64 with a metal-poor tometal-rich ratio of 2.5:1. the specific frequency of the local group ellipticalis initially about 1 but rises to about 3, when the young stellar populationsfade and the galaxy resembles an old elliptical. the metallicity distributionand stellar population corrected specific frequency are similar to that of someknown early type galaxies. based on our results, we briefly speculate on theorigin of globular cluster systems in galaxies.

astro-ph;0107533	the star cluster system of the 3 gyr old merger remnant ngc 1316: clues  from optical and near-infrared photometry	the giant merger remnant galaxy ngc 1316 (fornax a) is an ideal probe forstudying the long-term effects of a past major merger on star cluster systems,given its spectroscopically derived merger age of ~3 gyr which we reported in arecent paper. here we present new ground-based, large-area optical and near-irimaging of star clusters in ngc 1316, complemented with deep hst/wfpc2 imaging.we find that the optical-near-ir colours and luminosities of the brightest ~10clusters in ngc 1316 are consistent with those of intermediate-age (2-3 gyr)populations. unlike `normal' giant ellipticals, the b-i colour distribution ofclusters in ngc 1316 is not clearly bimodal. however, the luminosity functions(lfs) of the blue and red parts of the cluster colour distribution aredifferent: the red cluster lf is well represented by a power law with index-1.2 +/- 0.3, extending to about 1.5 mag brighter (in b) than those of typicalgiant ellipticals. in contrast, the shape of the blue cluster lf is consistentwith that of `normal' spiral and elliptical galaxies. we conclude that the starcluster system of ngc 1316 is a combination of a population of age ~3 gyrhaving roughly solar metallicity and a population of old, metal-poor clusterswhich probably belonged to the pre-merger galaxies. after the 3 gyr old,metal-rich clusters fade to an age of 10 gyr, they will form a red `peak' in abimodal cluster colour distribution. this `red peak' will have a colourconsistent with that found in `normal, old' giant ellipticals of the samegalaxy luminosity (taking age dimming into account). these features of the starcluster system of ngc 1316 are fully consistent with scenarios for forming`normal' giant elliptical galaxies through gas-rich mergers at look-back times$\ga$ 10 gyr.

astro-ph;0205495	k-band red clump distance to the large magellanic cloud	the hipparcos i-band calibration of horizontal-branch red clump giants asstandard candles has lead to controversial results for the distance to thelarge magellanic cloud (lmc). in an attempt to properly ascertain thecorrections for interstellar extinction and clump age and metallicity, weanalyze new multi-wavelength luminosity functions of the lmc red clump. ourphotometry dataset in the k-band was obtained with the sofi infrared imager atthe european southern observatory's new technology telescope. in the v and ipassbands, we employ data from wfpc2 onboard the hubble space telescope. thelmc red clump is first identified in a k,(v-k) color-magnitude diagram. ourluminosity functions yield apparent magnitudes of k = 16.974, i = 18.206, and v= 19.233 (+- 0.009_r +- 0.02_s; random and systematic error, respectively).compared directly to the hipparcos red clump calibration (without a correctionfor age and metallicity), the lmc clump measurements imply a negativeinterstellar reddening correction. this unphysical result indicates apopulation difference between clumps. a modified calibration based ontheoretical modeling yields an average reddening correction of e(b-v) = 0.089+- 0.015_r, and a true lmc distance modulus of 18.493 +- 0.033_r +- 0.03_s. wereconcile our result with the short distance previously derived from ogle iired clump data.

astro-ph;0304195	hubble space telescope observations of globular cluster systems along  the hubble sequence of spiral galaxies	we have studied the globular cluster (gc) systems of 7 giant, edge-on spiralgalaxies using hubble space telescope imaging in v and i. the galaxy samplecovers the hubble types sa to sc, allowing us to study the variation of theproperties of gc systems along the hubble sequence. the photometry reaches ~1.5mag beyond the turn-over magnitude of the gc luminosity function for eachgalaxy. specific frequencies (s_n values) of gcs were evaluated by comparingthe numbers of gcs found in our wfpc2 pointings with those in the milky waywhich would be detected in the same metric area. the s_n values of spirals withb/t &lt;= 0.3 (i.e., spirals with a hubble type later than about sb) areconsistent with a value of s_n = 0.55 +- 0.25. we suggest that this populationof gcs represents a `universal', old halo population that is present aroundeach galaxy. most galaxies in our sample have s_n values that are consistentwith a scenario in which gc systems are made up of (i) the aforementioned halopopulation plus (ii) a population that is associated with bulges, which growslinearly with the mass of the bulge. such scenarios include the `mergerscenario' for the formation of elliptical galaxies as well as the `multi-phasecollapse' scenario, but it seems inconsistent with the `secular evolution'scenario of pfenniger &amp; norman (1990), in which bulges are formed from discstars by means of the redistribution of angular momentum through barinstabilities and/or minor perturbations. however, there is one bulge-dominatedspiral galaxy in our sample (ngc 7814) with a low s_n value that is consistentwith those of the latest-type spirals. thus, our results suggest that theformation histories of galaxy bulges of early-type spirals can be significantlydifferent from one galaxy to another.

(2) the velocity distribution in the cluster center is essentiallyisotropic, as expected. (3) using a sample of radial velocities for stars inthe core, we estimate the distance to 47 tuc: d = 4.0 +/- 0.35 kpc. and (4) weinfer a 1-sigma upper limit of m&lt;1000-1500 solar masses for any central,intermediate-mass black hole. we can neither confirm nor refute the hypothesisthat 47 tuc might lie on an extension of the m-sigma relation observed forsupermassive black holes in galaxy bulges.

0809.1682	stellar proper motions in the galactic bulge from deep hst acs/wfc  photometry	we present stellar proper motions in the galactic bulge from the sagittariuswindow eclipsing extrasolar search (sweeps) project using acs/wfc on hst.proper motions are extracted for more than 180,000 objects, with &gt;81,000measured to accuracy better than 0.3 mas/yr in both coordinates. we reportseveral results based on these measurements: 1. kinematic separation of bulgefrom disk allows a sample of &gt;15,000 bulge objects to be extracted based on&gt;6-sigma detections of proper motion, with &lt;0.2% contamination from the disk.this includes the first detection of a candidate bulge blue stragglerpopulation. 2. armed with a photometric distance modulus on a star by starbasis, and using the large number of stars with high-quality proper motionmeasurements to overcome intrinsic scatter, we dissect the kinematic propertiesof the bulge as a function of distance along the line of sight. this allows usto extract the stellar circular speed curve from proper motions alone, which wecompare with the circular speed curve obtained from radial velocities. 3. wetrace the variation of the {l,b} velocity ellipse as a function of depth. 4.finally, we use the density-weighted {l,b} proper motion ellipse produced fromthe tracer stars to assess the kinematic membership of the sixteen transitingplanet candidates discovered in the sagittarius window; the kinematicdistribution of the planet candidates is consistent with that of the disk andbulge stellar populations.

astro-ph;0610098	transiting extrasolar planetary candidates in the galactic bulge	more than 200 extrasolar planets have been discovered around relativelynearby stars, primarily through the doppler line shifts owing to the reflexmotions of their host stars, and more recently through transits of some planetsacross the face of the host stars. the detection of planets with the shortestknown periods, 1.2 to 2.5 days, has mainly resulted from transit surveys whichhave generally targeted stars more massive than 0.75 m_sun. here we report theresults from a planetary transit search performed in a rich stellar fieldtowards the galactic bulge. we discovered 16 candidates with orbital periodsbetween 0.4 and 4.2 days, five of which orbit stars of 0.44 to 0.75 m_sun. intwo cases, radial-velocity measurements support the planetary nature of thecompanions. five candidates have orbital periods below 1.0 day, constituting anew class of ultra-short-period planets (uspps), which occur only around starsof less than 0.88 m_sun. this indicates that those orbiting very close to moreluminous stars might be evaporatively destroyed, or that jovian planets aroundlower-mass stars might migrate to smaller radii.

astro-ph;0610827	the `666' collaboration on ogle transits: i. accurate radius of the  planets ogle-tr-10b and ogle-tr-56b with vlt deconvolution photometry	transiting planets are essential to study the structure and evolution ofextra-solar planets. for that purpose, it is important to measure precisely theradius of these planets. here we report new high-accuracy photometry of thetransits of ogle-tr-10 and ogle-tr-56 with vlt/fors1. one transit of eachobject was covered in bessel v and r filters, and treated with thedeconvolution-based photometry algorithm decphot, to ensure accuratemillimagnitude light curves. together with earlier spectroscopic measurements,the data imply a radius of 1.22 +0.12-0.07 r_j for ogle-tr-10b and 1.30 +- 0.05r_j for ogle-tr-56b. a re-analysis of the original ogle photometry resolves anearlier discrepancy about the radius of ogle-tr-10. the transit of ogle-tr-56is almost grazing, so that small systematics in the photometry can cause largechanges in the derived radius. our study confirms both planets as inflated hotjupiters, with large radii comparable to that of hd 209458$b$ and at least twoother recently discovered transiting gas giants.

astro-ph;0612705	proper motions of dwarf spheroidal galaxies from hubble space telescope  imaging. v: final measurement for fornax	the measured proper motion of fornax, expressed in the equatorial coordinatesystem, is $(\mu_{\alpha},\mu_{\delta})=(47.6\pm 4.6,-36.0\pm 4.1)$ mascentury$^{-1}$. this proper motion is a weighted mean of four independentmeasurements for three distinct fields. each measurement uses a quasi-stellarobject as a reference point. removing the contribution of the motion of the sunand of the local standard of rest to the measured proper motion produces agalactic rest-frame proper motion of $(\mu_{\alpha}^{\mbox{\tiny{grf}}},\mu_{\delta}^{\mbox{\tiny{grf}}}) = (24.4\pm 4.6,-14.3\pm 4.1)$ mascentury$^{-1}$. the implied space velocity with respect to the galactic centerhas a radial component of $v_{r}=-31.8 \pm 1.7$ km s$^{-1}$ and a tangentialcomponent of $v_{t}=196 \pm 29$ km s$^{-1}$. integrating the motion of fornaxin a realistic potential for the milky way produces orbital elements. theperigalacticon and apogalacticon are 118 (66, 137) kpc and 152 (144, 242) kpc,respectively, where the values in the parentheses represent the 95% confidenceintervals derived from monte carlo experiments. the eccentricity of the orbitis 0.13 (0.11, 0.38), and the orbital period is 3.2 (2.5, 4.6) gyr. the orbitis retrograde and inclined by $101^{\circ}$ ($94^{\circ}$, $107^{\circ}$) tothe galactic plane. fornax could be a member of a proposed ``stream'' ofgalaxies and globular clusters, however the membership of another proposedgalaxy in the stream, sculptor, has been previously ruled out. fornax is in thekroupa-theis-boily plane that contains eleven of the galactic satellitegalaxies, but its orbit will take it out of that plane.

astro-ph;0703664	imaging and spectroscopy of ultra steep spectrum radio sources	we present a sample of 40 ultra steep spectrum (uss, $\alpha \leq -1.3$,$s_{\nu}\propto \nu^{\alpha}$) radio sources selected from the westerbork inthe southern hemisphere (wish) catalog. the uss sources have been imaged ink--band at the cerro tololo inter-american observatory (ctio) and with the verylarge telescope at cerro paranal. we also present vlt, keck and willianherschel telescope(wht) optical spectroscopy of 14 targets selection from 4different uss samples. for 12 sources, we have been able to determine theredshifts, including 4 new radio galaxies at z &gt; 3. we find that most of ouruss sources have predominantly small (6'') radio sizes and faint magnitudes(k~18). the mean k-band counterpart magnitude is $\bar{k}$=18.6. the expectedredshift distribution estimated using the hubble k-z diagram has a mean of$\bar{z}_{exp}$$\sim$2.13, which is higher than the predicted redshift obtainedfor the sumss-nvss sample and the expected redshift obtained in the 6c$^{**}$survey. the compact uss sample analyzed here may contain a higher fraction ofgalaxies which are high redshift and/or are heavily obscured by dust. using the74, 352 and 1400 mhz flux densities of a sub-sample, we construct a radiocolour-colour diagram. we find that all but one of our uss sources have astrong tendency to flatten below 352 mhz. we also find that the highestredshift source from this paper (at z=3.84) does not show evidence for spectralflattening down to 151 mhz. this suggests that very low frequency selected usssamples will likely be more efficient to find high redshift galaxies.

astro-ph;9509109	field stars and clusters of the galactic bulge: implications for galaxy  formation	the results of a kinematic study of the galactic bulge based on spectra ofred giants in fields at projected distances of 1.4-1.8 kpc from the galacticcenter are presented. there is a marked trend of kinematics with metallicity,in the sense that the more metal-poor population has higher velocity dispersionand lower rotation velocity than the metal-rich population. the k giants moremetal--poor than [fe/h] = -1 have halo-like kinematics, with no significantrotation and sigma = 120 km/s independent of galactocentric distance. thevelocity dispersion of the giants with [fe/h] &gt; -1 decreases with increasinggalactocentric distance, and this population is rotating with v = 0.9km/s/degree. the present observations, together with the observed metallicitygradient imply bulge formation through dissipational collapse. in such apicture, low angular momentum gas lost from the formation of the halo wasdeposited in the bulge. the bulge would then be younger than the halo.observations of the galactic globular cluster system are consistent with thispicture, if we associate the metal-rich globular clusters within 3 kpc of thegalactic center with the bulge rather than with the thick disk or halo. data onthe rr lyr in baade's window are also consistent with this picture if thesestars are considered part of the inner halo rather than the bulge.

astro-ph;9611109	imaging with stis: astronomy at v = 30	in february, 1997, the second space shuttle servicing mission to the hubbleobservatory will install the space telescope imaging spectrograph (stis). thisnew instrument will greatly enhance the spectroscopic capabilities of thehubble space telescope by providing a longslit format and ccd detectortechnology. stis can also be used as an imager, providing an alternative to thewide field planetary camera 2. the filter set of stis is limited and does notcontain standard bandpasses, but we show here that this does not precludeuseful broad band photometry. in fact, the stis photometric system may bepreferable to that of wfpc2 for certain applications where a faint limitingmagnitude and fine spatial resolution are overriding considerations. the twooptical wide-band choices on stis are a clear aperture and a longpass ($\lambda&gt; 5500$\aa) filter. we define an effective shortpass filter from the differenceof these, making two-color photometry possible with stis. we presentpreliminary transformations between the stis system and cousins bvribandpasses, showing that these transformations are very well-behaved overalmost all temperatures, luminosities, and abundances for normal stars. in an8-orbit cycle, stis will be able to reach signal-to-noise of $\sim 5-10$ at v =30.0 in its clear and longpass imaging modes, a significant increase in thepower of hst to address a number of fundamental issues out of reach of currentinstrumentation capabilities on the ground or in space.

astro-ph;9804261	constraints on the merger models of elliptical galaxies from their  globular cluster systems	the discovery of proto-globular cluster candidates in many current-daymergers allows us to better understand the possible effects of a merger eventon the globular cluster system of a galaxy, and to foresee the properties ofthe end-product. by comparing these expectations to the properties of globularcluster systems of today's elliptical galaxies we can constrain merger models.the observational data indicate that i) every gaseous merger induces theformation of new star clusters, ii) the number of new clusters formed in such amerger increases with the gas content of the progenitor galaxies.low-luminosity (about m_v&gt;-21), disky ellipticals are generally thought to bethe result of a gaseous merger. as such, new globular clusters are expected toform but have not been detected to date. we investigate various reasons for thenon-detection of sub-populations in low-luminosity ellipticals, i.e. absence ofan old population, absence of a new population, destruction of one of thepopulations, and finally, an age-metallicity conspiracy that allows old and newglobular clusters to appear indistinguishable at the present epoch. all ofthese possibilities lead us to a similar conclusion, namely that low-luminosityellipticals did not form recently (z&lt;1) in a gas-rich merger, and might nothave formed in a major merger of stellar systems at all. high-luminosityellipticals do reveal globular cluster sub-populations. however, it isdifficult to account for the two populations in terms of mergers alone, and inparticular, we can rule out scenarios in which the second sub-population is theproduct of a recent, gas-poor merger.

astro-ph;9811373	towards an understanding of the globular cluster over--abundance around  the central giant elliptical ngc 1399	we investigate the kinematics of a combined sample of 74 globular clustersaround ngc 1399. their high velocity dispersion, increasing with radius,supports their association with the gravitational potential of the galaxycluster rather than with that of ngc 1399 itself. we find no evidence forrotation in the full sample, although some indication for rotation in the outerregions. the data do not allow us to detect differences between the kinematicsof the blue and red sub-populations of globular clusters.  a comparison between the globular cluster systems of ngc 1399 and those ofngc 1404 and ngc 1380 indicates that the globular clusters in all threegalaxies are likely to have formed via similar mechanisms and at similarepochs. the only property which distinguishes the ngc 1399 globular clustersystem from these others is that it is ten times more abundant. we summarizethe evidence for associating these excess globulars with the galaxy clusterrather than with ngc 1399 itself, and suggest that the over-abundance can beexplained by tidal stripping, at an early epoch, of neighboring galaxies andsubsequent accumulation of globulars in the gravitational potential of thegalaxy cluster.
