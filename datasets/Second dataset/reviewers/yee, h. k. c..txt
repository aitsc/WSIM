0903.2478	galaxy clusters in formation: determining the age of the red-sequence in  optical and x-ray clusters at z~1 with hst	using deep two-band imaging from the hubble space telescope, we measure thecolor-magnitude relations (cmr) of e/s0 galaxies in a set of 9optically-selected clusters principally from the red-sequence cluster survey(rcs) at 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 1.23. we find that the mean scatter in the cmr in theobserved frame of this set of clusters is 0.049 +/- 0.008, as compared to 0.031+/- 0.007 in a similarly imaged and identically analyzed x-ray sample atsimilar redshifts. single-burst stellar population models of the cmr scattersuggest that the e/s0 population in these rcs clusters truncated theirstar-formation at z~1.6, some 0.9 gyrs later than their x-ray e/s0 counterpartswhich were truncated at z~2.1. the notion that this is a manifestation of thediffering evolutionary states of the two populations of cluster galaxies issupported by comparison of the fraction of bulge-dominated galaxies found inthe two samples which shows that optically-selected clusters contain a smallerfraction of e/s0 galaxies at the their cores

0707.0066	first detection of galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing in rcs. a new tool for  studying the matter environment of galaxy pairs	the weak gravitational lensing effect, small coherent distortions of galaxyimages by means of a gravitational tidal field, can be used to study therelation between the matter and galaxy distribution. in this context, weaklensing has so far only been used for considering a second-order correlationfunction that relates the matter density and galaxy number density as afunction of separation. we implement two new, third-order correlation functionsthat have recently been suggested in the literature, and apply them to thered-sequence cluster survey. we demonstrate that it is possible, even withalready existing data, to make significant measurements of third-order lensingcorrelations. we develop an optimised computer code for the correlationfunctions. to test its reliability a set of tests are performed. thecorrelation functions are transformed to aperture statistics, which allow easytests for remaining systematics in the data. in order to further verify therobustness of our measurement, the signal is shown to vanish when randomisingthe source ellipticities. finally, the lensing signal is compared to crudepredictions based on the halo-model. on angular scales between roughly 1 arcminand 11 arcmin a significant third-order correlation between two lens positionsand one source ellipticity is found. we discuss this correlation function as anovel tool to study the average matter environment of pairs of galaxies.correlating two source ellipticities and one lens position yields a lesssignificant but nevertheless detectable signal on a scale of 4 arcmin. bothsignals lie roughly within the range expected by theory which supports theircosmological origin.[abridged]

0907.4800	the galaxy population of low-redshift abell clusters	we present a study of the luminosity and color properties of galaxiesselected from a sample of 57 low-redshift abell clusters. we utilize thenon-parametric dwarf-to-giant ratio (dgr) and the blue galaxy fraction (fb) toinvestigate the clustercentric radial-dependent changes in the cluster galaxypopulation. composite cluster samples are combined by scaling the countingradius by r200 to minimize radius selection bias. the separation of galaxiesinto a red and blue population was achieved by selecting galaxies relative tothe cluster color-magnitude relation. the dgr of the red and blue galaxies isfound to be independent of cluster richness (bgc), although the dgr is largerfor the blue population at all measured radii. a decrease in the dgr for thered and red+blue galaxies is detected in the cluster core region, while theblue galaxy dgr is nearly independent of radius. the fb is found not tocorrelate with bgc; however, a steady decline toward the inner-cluster regionis observed for the giant galaxies. the dwarf galaxy fb is approximatelyconstant with clustercentric radius except for the inner cluster core regionwhere fb decreases. the clustercentric radial dependence of the dgr and thegalaxy blue fraction, indicates that it is unlikely that a simple scenariobased on either pure disruption or pure fading/reddening can describe theevolution of infalling dwarf galaxies; both outcomes are produced by thecluster environment.

1107.4093	galaxy-galaxy lensing constraints on the relation between baryons and  dark matter in galaxies in the red sequence cluster survey 2	we present the results of a study of weak gravitational lensing by galaxiesusing imaging data that were obtained as part of the second red sequencecluster survey (rcs2). in order to compare to the baryonic properties of thelenses we focus here on the ~300 square degrees that overlap with the dr7 ofthe sdss. the depth and image quality of the rcs2 enables us to significantlyimprove upon earlier work for luminous galaxies at z&gt;=0.3. comparison withdynamical masses from the sdss shows a good correlation with the lensing massfor early-type galaxies. for low luminosity (stellar mass) early-type galaxieswe find a satellite fraction of ~40% which rapidly decreases to &lt;10% withincreasing luminosity (stellar mass). the satellite fraction of the late-typeshas a value in the range 0-15%. we find that early-types in the range10^10&lt;l_r&lt;10^11.5 lsun have virial masses that are about five times higher thanthose of late-type galaxies and that the mass scales as m_200 \propto l^2.34+0.09 \ -0.16. we also measure the virial mass-to-light ratio, and find forl_200&lt;10^11 lsun a value of m_200/l_200=42+-10 for early-types, which increasesfor higher luminosities to values that are consistent with those observed forgroups and clusters of galaxies. for late-type galaxies we find a lower valueof m_200/l_200=17+-9. our measurements also show that early- and late-typegalaxies have comparable halo masses for stellar masses m_*&lt;10^11 msun, whereasthe virial masses of early-type galaxies are higher for higher stellar masses.finally, we determine the efficiency with which baryons have been convertedinto stars. our results for early-type galaxies suggest a variation inefficiency with a minimum of ~10% for a stellar mass m_*,200=10^12 msun. theresults for the late-type galaxies are not well constrained, but do suggest alarger value.

1109.5125	submillimetre source counts in the fields of high-redshift galaxy  clusters	we present a submillimetre survey of seven high-z galaxy clusters(0.64&lt;z&lt;1.0) using the submillimetre common-user bolometer array (scuba) at 850and 450 um. the targets, of similar richness and redshift, are selected fromthe red-sequence cluster survey (rcs). we use this sample to investigate theapparent excess of submillimetre source counts in the direction of clusterfields compared to blank fields. the sample consists of three galaxy clustersthat exhibit multiple optical arcs due to strong gravitational lensing, and acontrol group of four clusters with no apparent strong lensing. a tentativeexcess of 2.7-sigma is seen in the number density of submillimetre luminousgalaxies (smgs) within the lensing cluster fields compared to that in thecontrol group. ancillary observations at radio, mid-infrared, optical, andx-ray wavelengths allow for the identification of counterparts to many of thesmgs. utilizing photometric redshifts, we conclude that at least three of thegalaxies within the lensing fields have redshifts consistent with the clustersand implied infrared luminosities of ~10^12 lsol. the existence of smg clustermembers may therefore be boosting source counts in the lensing cluster fields,which might be an effect of the dynamical state of those clusters. however, wefind that the removal of potential cluster members from the counts analysisdoes not entirely eliminate the difference between the cluster samples. we alsoinvestigate possible occurrences of lensing between background smgs and lower-zoptical galaxies, though further observations are required to make anyconclusive claims. although the excess counts between the two cluster sampleshave not been unambiguously accounted for, these results warrant caution forinterpreting submillimetre source counts in cluster fields and point sourcecontamination for sunyaev-zel'dovich surveys.

1206.4304	constraints on the shapes of galaxy dark matter haloes from weak  gravitational lensing	we study the shapes of galaxy dark matter haloes by measuring the anisotropyof the weak gravitational lensing signal around galaxies in the secondred-sequence cluster survey (rcs2). we determine the average shear anisotropywithin the virial radius for three lens samples: all galaxies with19&lt;m_r'&lt;21.5, and the `red' and `blue' samples, whose lensing signals aredominated by massive low-redshift early-type and late-type galaxies,respectively. to study the environmental dependence of the lensing signal, weseparate each lens sample into an isolated and clustered part and analyse themseparately. we also measure the azimuthal dependence of the distribution ofphysically associated galaxies around the lens samples. we find that thesesatellites preferentially reside near the major axis of the lenses, andconstrain the angle between the major axis of the lens and the average locationof the satellites to &lt;theta&gt;=43.7 deg +/- 0.3 deg for the `all' lenses,&lt;theta&gt;=41.7 deg +/- 0.5 deg for the `red' lenses and &lt;theta&gt;=42.0 deg +/- 1.4deg for the `blue' lenses. for the `all' sample, we find that the anisotropy ofthe galaxy-mass cross-correlation function &lt;f-f_45&gt;=0.23 +/- 0.12, providingweak support for the view that the average galaxy is embedded in, andpreferentially aligned with, a triaxial dark matter halo. assuming anelliptical navarro-frenk-white (nfw) profile, we find that the ratio of thedark matter halo ellipticity and the galaxy ellipticityf_h=e_h/e_g=1.50+1.03-1.01, which for a mean lens ellipticity of 0.25corresponds to a projected halo ellipticity of e_h=0.38+0.26-0.25 if the haloand the lens are perfectly aligned. for isolated galaxies of the `all' sample,the average shear anisotropy increases to &lt;f-f_45&gt;=0.51+0.26-0.25 andf_h=4.73+2.17-2.05, whilst for clustered galaxies the signal is consistent withzero.

1208.5143	evidence for significant growth in the stellar mass of brightest cluster  galaxies over the past 10 billion years	using new and published data, we construct a sample of 160 brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) spanning the redshift interval 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 1.63. we use thissample, which covers 70% of the history of the universe, to measure the growthin the stellar mass of bcgs after correcting for the correlation between thestellar mass of the bcg and the mass of the cluster in which it lives. we findthat the stellar mass of bcgs increase by a factor of 1.8 between z=0.9 andz=0.2. compared to earlier works, our result is closer to the predictions ofsemi-analytic models. however, bcgs at z=0.9, relative to bcgs at z=0.2, arestill a factor of 1.5 more massive than the predictions of these models. starformation rates in bcgs at z~1 are generally to low to result in significantamounts of mass. instead, it is likely that most of the mass build up occursthrough mainly dry mergers in which perhaps half of the mass is lost to theintra-cluster medium of the cluster.

1210.2130	the wigglez dark energy survey: final data release and cosmological  results	this paper presents cosmological results from the final data release of thewigglez dark energy survey. we perform full analyses of different cosmologicalmodels using the wigglez power spectra measured at z=0.22, 0.41, 0.60, and0.78, combined with other cosmological datasets. the limiting factor in thisanalysis is the theoretical modelling of the galaxy power spectrum, includingnon-linearities, galaxy bias, and redshift-space distortions. in this paper weassess several different methods for modelling the theoretical power spectrum,testing them against the gigaparsec wigglez simulations (gigglez). we fit for abase set of 6 cosmological parameters, {omega_b h^2, omega_cdm h^2, h_0, tau,a_s, n_s}, and 5 supplementary parameters {n_run, r, w, omega_k, sum m_nu}. incombination with the cosmic microwave background (cmb), our results areconsistent with the lambdacdm concordance cosmology, with a measurement of thematter density of omega_m =0.29 +/- 0.016 and amplitude of fluctuations sigma_8= 0.825 +/- 0.017. using wigglez data with cmb and other distance and matterpower spectra data, we find no evidence for any of the extension parametersbeing inconsistent with their lambdacdm model values. the power spectra dataand theoretical modelling tools are available for use as a module for cosmomc,which we here make publicly available at http://smp.uq.edu.au/wigglez-data . wealso release the data and random catalogues used to construct the baryonacoustic oscillation correlation function.

1211.0543	stellar mass versus velocity dispersion as tracer of the lensing signal  around bulge-dominated galaxies	we present the results of a weak gravitational lensing analysis to determinewhether the stellar mass or the velocity dispersion is more closely related tothe amplitude of the lensing signal around galaxies - and hence to theprojected distribution of dark matter. the lensing signal on scales smallerthan the virial radius corresponds most closely to the lensing velocitydispersion in the case of a singular isothermal profile, but is on largerscales also sensitive to the clustering of the haloes. we select over 4000 lensgalaxies at a redshift z&lt;0.2 with concentrated (or bulge-dominated) surfacebrightness profiles from the ~300 square degree overlap between thered-sequence cluster survey 2 (rcs2) and the data release 7 (dr7) of the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). we consider both the spectroscopic velocitydispersion and a model velocity dispersion (a combination of the stellar mass,the size and the sersic index of a galaxy). comparing the model andspectroscopic velocity dispersion we find that they correlate well for galaxieswith concentrated brightness profiles. we find that the stellar mass and thespectroscopic velocity dispersion trace the amplitude of the lensing signal onsmall scales equally well. the model velocity dispersion, however, doessignificantly worse. a possible explanation is that the halo properties thatdetermine the small-scale lensing signal - mainly the total mass - also dependon the structural parameters of galaxies, such as the effective radius andsersic index, but we lack data for a definitive conclusion.

1211.5605	the wigglez dark energy survey: probing the epoch of radiation  domination using large scale structure	we place the most robust constraint to date on the scale of the turnover inthe cosmological matter power spectrum using data from the wigglez dark energysurvey. we find this feature to lie at a scale of$k_0=0.0160^{+0.0041}_{-0.0035}$ [h/mpc] (68% confidence) for an effectiveredshift of 0.62 and obtain from this the first-ever turnover-derived distanceand cosmology constraints: a measure of the cosmic distance-redshift relationin units of the horizon scale at the redshift of radiation-matter equality(r_h) of d_v(z=0.62)/r_h=18.3 (+6.3/-3.3) and, assuming a prior on the numberof extra relativistic degrees of freedom $n_{eff}=3$, constraints on the matterdensity parameter $\omega_mh^2=0.136^{+0.026}_{-0.052}$ and on the redshift ofmatter-radiation equality $z_{eq}=3274^{+631}_{-1260}$. all results are inexcellent agreement with the predictions of standard lcdm models. ourconstraints on the logarithmic slope of the power spectrum on scales largerthan the turnover is bounded in the lower limit with values only as low as -1allowed, with the prediction of standard lcdm models easily accommodated by ourresults. lastly, we generate forecasts for the achievable precision of futuresurveys at constraining $k_0$, $\omega_mh^2$, $z_{eq}$ and $n_{eff}$. we findthat boss should substantially improve upon the wigglez turnover constraint,reaching a precision on $k_0$ of $\pm$9% (68% confidence), translating toprecisions on $\omega_mh^2$ and $z_{eq}$ of $\pm$10% (assuming a prior$n_{eff}=3$) and on $n_{eff}$ of (+78/-56)% (assuming a prior$\omega_mh^2=0.135$). this is sufficient precision to sharpen the constraintson $n_{eff}$ from wmap, particularly in its upper limit. for euclid, we findcorresponding attainable precisions on $(k_0, \omega_mh^2, n_eff)$ of(3,4,+17/-21)%. this represents a precision approaching our forecasts for theplanck surveyor.

1302.5178	the wigglez dark energy survey: measuring the cosmic growth rate with  the two-point galaxy correlation function	the growth history of large-scale structure in the universe is a powerfulprobe of the cosmological model, including the nature of dark energy. we studythe growth rate of cosmic structure to redshift $z = 0.9$ using more than$162{,}000$ galaxy redshifts from the wigglez dark energy survey. we divide thedata into four redshift slices with effective redshifts $z =[0.2,0.4,0.6,0.76]$ and in each of the samples measure and model the 2-pointgalaxy correlation function in parallel and transverse directions to theline-of-sight. after simultaneously fitting for the galaxy bias factor werecover values for the cosmic growth rate which are consistent with our assumed$\lambda$cdm input cosmological model, with an accuracy of around 20% in eachredshift slice. we investigate the sensitivity of our results to the details ofthe assumed model and the range of physical scales fitted, making closecomparison with a set of n-body simulations for calibration. our measurementsare consistent with an independent power-spectrum analysis of a similardataset, demonstrating that the results are not driven by systematic errors. wedetermine the pairwise velocity dispersion of the sample in a non-parametricmanner, showing that it systematically increases with decreasing redshift, andinvestigate the alcock-paczynski effects of changing the assumed fiducial modelon the results. our techniques should prove useful for current and futuregalaxy surveys mapping the growth rate of structure using the 2-dimensionalcorrelation function.

1303.4997	a kinematic approach to assessing environmental effects: star-forming  galaxies in a z~0.9 sparcs cluster using spitzer 24um observations	we present an infrared study of a z=0.872 cluster, sparcs j161314+564930,with the primary aim of distinguishing the dynamical histories ofspectroscopically confirmed star-forming members to assess the role of clusterenvironment. we utilize deep mips imaging and a mass-limited sample of 85spectroscopic members to identify 16 24um-bright sources within the cluster,and measure their 24um star formation rates (sfrs) down to ~6 msolar/year.based on their line-of-sight velocities and stellar ages, mips cluster membersappear to be an infalling population that was recently accreted from the fieldwith minimal environmental dependency on their star formation. however, weidentify a double-sequenced distribution of star-forming galaxies amongst themembers, with one branch exhibiting declining specific sfrs with mass. themembers along this sub-main sequence contain spectral features suggestive ofpassive galaxies. using caustic diagrams, we kinematically identify thesegalaxies as a virialized and/or backsplash population. moreover, we find a mixof dynamical histories at all projected radii, indicating that standarddefinitions of environment (i.e., radius and density) are contaminated withrecently accreted interlopers, which could contribute to a lack ofenvironmental trends for star-forming galaxies. a cleaner narrative of theirdynamical past begins to unfold when using a proxy for accretion historiesthrough profiles of constant (r/r_200)x(delta v/sigma_v); galaxies accreted atearlier times possess lower values of (r/r_200)x(delta v/sigma_v) with minimalcontamination from the distinct infalling population. therefore, adopting atime-averaged definition for density (as traced by accretion histories) ratherthan an instantaneous density yields a depressed specific sfr within thedynamical cluster core.

(1) we findthat the central galaxy stellar mass fraction decreases with total halo mass,and that this is in reasonable quantitative agreement with measurements fromabundance matching studies at z~1. (2) the total stellar mass fractions ofthese systems decrease with halo mass, indicating that lower mass systems aremore efficient at transforming baryons into stars. we find the total stellarmass to be a good proxy for total halo mass, with a small intrinsic scatter.when we compare these results with literature measurements, we find that thestellar mass fraction at fixed halo mass shows no significant evolution in therange 0&lt;z&lt;1.

1401.0358	the wigglez dark energy survey: improved distance measurements to z = 1  with reconstruction of the baryonic acoustic feature	we present significant improvements in cosmic distance measurements from thewigglez dark energy survey, achieved by applying the reconstruction of thebaryonic acoustic feature technique. we show using both data and simulationsthat the reconstruction technique can often be effective despite patchiness ofthe survey, significant edge effects and shot-noise. we investigate threeredshift bins in the redshift range 0.2&lt;$z$&lt;1, and in all three findimprovement after reconstruction in the detection of the baryonic acousticfeature and its usage as a standard ruler. we measure model independentdistance measures $d_{\mathrm v}(r_{\mathrm s}^\mathrm{fid}/r_{\mathrm s})$ of1716 $\pm$ 83 mpc, 2221 $\pm$ 101 mpc, 2516 $\pm$ 86 mpc (68% cl) at effectiveredshifts z = 0.44, 0.6, 0.73, respectively, where $d_{\mathrm v}$ is thevolume-average-distance, and $r_{\mathrm s}$ is the sound horizon at the end ofthe baryon drag epoch. these significantly improved 4.8, 4.5 and 3.4 percentaccuracy measurements are equivalent to those expected from surveys with up to2.5 times the volume of wigglez. these measurements are fully consistent withcosmologies allowed by the analyses of the planck collaboration and the sloandigital sky survey.we provide the $d_{\mathrm v}(r_{\mathrms}^\mathrm{fid}/r_{\mathrm s})$ posterior probability distributions and theircovariances. when combining these measurements with temperature fluctuationsmeasurements of planck, the polarization of wmap9, and the 6df galaxy surveybaryonic acoustic feature, we do not detect deviations from a flat lcdm model.assuming this model we constrain the current expansion rate to $h_0$ = 67.15$\pm$ 0.98 kms$^{-1}$mpc$^{-1}$. allowing the equation of state of dark energyto vary we obtain $w_\mathrm{de}$ = -1.080 $\pm$ 0.135. when assuming a curvedlcdm model we obtain a curvature value of $\omega_{\mathrm k}$ = -0.0043 $\pm$0.0047.

1402.7077	the phase space and stellar populations of cluster galaxies at z ~ 1:  simultaneous constraints on the location and timescale of satellite quenching	we investigate the velocity vs. position phase space of z ~ 1 clustergalaxies using a set of 424 spectroscopic redshifts in 9 clusters drawn fromthe gclass survey. dividing the galaxy population into three categories:quiescent, star-forming, and poststarburst, we find that these populations havedistinct distributions in phase space. most striking are the poststarburstgalaxies, which are commonly found at small clustercentric radii with highclustercentric velocities, and appear to trace a coherent ``ring" in phasespace. using several zoom simulations of clusters we show that the coherentdistribution of the poststarbursts can be reasonably well-reproduced using asimple quenching scenario. specifically, the phase space is best reproduced ifsatellite quenching occurs on a rapid timescale (0.1 &lt; tau_{q} &lt; 0.5 gyr) aftergalaxies make their first passage of r ~ 0.5r_{200}, a process that takes atotal time of ~ 1 gyr after first infall. we compare this quenching timescaleto the timescale implied by the stellar populations of the poststarburstgalaxies and find that the poststarburst spectra are well-fit by a rapidquenching (tau_{q} = 0.4^{+0.3}_{-0.4} gyr) of a typical star-forming galaxy.the similarity between the quenching timescales derived from these independentindicators is a strong consistency check of the quenching model. given that themodel implies satellite quenching is rapid, and occurs well within r_{200},this would suggest that ram-pressure stripping of either the hot or cold gascomponent of galaxies are the most plausible candidates for the physicalmechanism. the high cold gas consumption rates at z ~ 1 make it difficult todetermine if hot or cold gas stripping is dominant; however, measurements ofthe redshift evolution of the satellite quenching timescale and location may becapable of distinguishing between the two.

1406.2693	mergers in galaxy groups. ii. the fundamental plane of elliptical  galaxies	observations consistently show that elliptical galaxies follow a tight"fundamental plane" scaling relation between size, mean surface brightness andvelocity dispersion, with the form $r \propto \sigma^{a}\mu^{b}$. this relationnot only has very small (&lt;0.05 dex) intrinsic scatter, but also hassignificantly different coefficients from the expected virial scaling (a"tilt"). we analyze hundreds of simulations of elliptical galaxies formed frommergers of spiral galaxies in groups to determine if the fundamental plane canemerge from multiple, mostly minor and hierarchical collisionless mergers. wefind that these simulated ellipticals lie on a similar fundamental plane with$a \approx 1.7$ and $b \approx 0.3$. the scatter about this plane is not largerthan observed, while the tilt is in the correct sense, although $a$ is largerthan for typical observations. this supports the idea that collisionlessmergers can contribute significantly to the tilt of the fundamental plane. thetilt is mainly driven by a mass-dependent dark matter fraction, such that moremassive galaxies have larger dark matter fractions within $r_{e}$. we furtherdiscuss the origin of this mass-dependent dark matter fraction and itscompatibility with strong lensing observations, as well as the links betweenthe fundamental plane, dynamical masses and the virial theorem.

1406.4149	the inside-out growth of the most massive galaxies at 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.9	we study the surface brightness profiles of a sample of brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) with 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.9. the bcgs are selected from the firstred-sequence cluster survey and an x-ray cluster survey. the surface brightnessprofiles of the bcgs are measured using hst acs images, and most of them can bewell modeled by a sersic profile with index ~ 6 and half-light radius ~ 30 kpc.although the single sersic model fits the profiles well, we argue that thesystematics in the sky background measurement and the coupling between themodel parameters make the comparison of the model parameters ambiguous. directcomparison of the bcg profiles, on the other hand, has revealed an inside-outgrowth for these most massive galaxies: as the mass of a bcg increases, thecentral mass density of the galaxy increases slowly ($\rho_{1kpc} \proptom*^{0.39}$), while the slope of the outer profile grows continuously shallower($\alpha \propto m*^{-2.5}$). such a fashion of growth continues down to theless massive early-type galaxies (etgs), without apparent distinction betweenbcgs and non-bcgs. for the very massive etgs and bcgs, the slope of thekormendy relation starts to trace the slope of the surface brightness profilesand becomes insensitive to subtle profile evolution. these results aregenerally consistent with dry mergers being the major driver of the mass growthfor bcgs and massive etgs. we also find strong correlations between therichness of clusters and the properties of bcgs: the more massive the clustersare, the more massive the bcgs ($m*_{bcg} \propto m_{clusters}^{0.6}$) and theshallower their surface brightness profiles. after taking into account the biasin the cluster samples, we find the masses of the bcgs have grown by at least afactor of 1.5 from z=0.5 to z=0, in contrast to the previous findings of noevolution. such an evolution validates the expectation from the lcdm model.

1407.5151	estimating luminosities and stellar masses of galaxies photometrically  without determining redshifts	large direct-imaging surveys usually use a template-fitting technique toestimate photometric redshifts for galaxies, which are then applied to deriveimportant galaxy properties such as luminosities and stellar masses. theseestimates can be noisy and suffer from systematic biases because of thepossible mis-selection of templates and the propagation of the photometricredshift uncertainty. we introduce an algorithm, the direct empiricalphotometric method (demp), which can be used to directly estimate thesequantities using training sets, bypassing photometric redshift determination.demp also applies two techniques to minimize the effects arising from thenon-uniform distribution of training-set galaxy redshifts from a flux-limitedsample. first, for each input galaxy, fitting is performed using a subset ofthe training-set galaxies with photometry and colors closest to those of theinput galaxy. second, the training set is artificially resampled to produce aflat distribution in redshift, or other properties, e.g., luminosity. to testthe performance of demp, we use a 4-filter-band mock catalog to examine itsability to recover redshift, luminosity, stellar mass, and luminosity andstellar-mass functions. we also compare the results to those from two publiclyavailable template-fitting methods, finding that the demp algorithm outperformsboth. we find resampling the training set to have a uniform redshiftdistribution produces the best results not only in photometric redshift, butalso in estimating luminosity and stellar mass. the demp method is especiallypowerful in estimating quantities such as near-ir luminosities and stellar massusing only data from a small number of optical bands.

0804.1604	pair analysis of field galaxies from the red-sequence cluster survey	we study the evolution of the number of close companions of similarluminosities per galaxy (nc) by choosing a volume-limited subset of thephotometric redshift catalog from the red-sequence cluster survey (rcs-1). thesample contains over 157,000 objects with a moderate redshift range of 0.25 &lt; z&lt; 0.8 and absolute magnitude in rc (m_rc) &lt; -20. this is the largest sampleused for pair evolution analysis, providing data over 9 redshift bins withabout 17,500 galaxies in each. after applying incompleteness and projectioncorrections, nc shows a clear evolution with redshift. the nc value for thewhole sample grows with redshift as (1+z)^m, where m = 2.83 +/- 0.33 in goodagreement with n-body simulations in a lcdm cosmology. we also separate thesample into two different absolute magnitude bins: -25 &lt; m_rc &lt; -21 and -21 &lt;m_rc &lt; -20, and find that the brighter the absolute magnitude, the smaller them value. furthermore, we study the evolution of the pair fraction for differentprojected separation bins and different luminosities. we find that the m valuebecomes smaller for larger separation, and the pair fraction for the fainterluminosity bin has stronger evolution. we derive the major merger remnantfraction f_rem = 0.06, which implies that about 6% of galaxies with -25 &lt; m_rc&lt; -20 have undergone major mergers since z = 0.8.

1506.03817	weak-lensing-inferred scaling relations of galaxy clusters in the rcs2:  mass-richness, mass-concentration, mass-bias, and more	we study a sample of ~10^4 galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.8with masses m_200 &gt; 5x10^13 h_70^-1 m_sun, discovered in the secondred-sequence cluster survey (rcs2). the depth and excellent image quality ofthe rcs2 enable us to detect the cluster-mass cross-correlation up to z~0.7. toobtain cluster masses, concentrations and halo biases, we fit a cluster halomodel simultaneously to the lensing signal and to the projected density profileof red-sequence cluster members, as the latter provides tight constraints onthe cluster miscentring distribution. we parametrise the mass-richness relationas m_200 = a x (n_200/20)^alpha, and find a = (15.0 +- 0.8) x 10^13 h_70^-1m_sun and alpha = 0.73 +- 0.07 at low redshift (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.35). at intermediateredshift (0.35&lt;z&lt;0.55), we find a higher normalisation, which points at afractional increase of the richness towards lower redshift caused by thebuild-up of the red-sequence. the miscentring distribution is well constrained.only ~30% of our bcgs coincide with the peak of the dark matter distribution.the distribution of the remaining bcgs are modelled with a 2d-gaussian, whosewidth increases from 0.2 to 0.4 h_70^-1 mpc towards higher masses; the ratio ofwidth and r_200 is constant with mass and has an average value of 0.44 +- 0.01.the mass-concentration and mass-bias relation agree fairly well with literatureresults at low redshift, but have a higher normalisation at higher redshifts,which may be due to selection and projection effects. the concentration of thesatellite distribution decreases with mass and is correlated with theconcentration of the halo.

astro-ph;0002036	the merger rate to redshift one from kinematic pairs: caltech faint  galaxy redshift survey xi	the rate of mass accumulation due to galaxy merging depends on the mass,density, and velocity distribution of galaxies in the near neighborhood of ahost galaxy. the fractional luminosity in kinematic pairs combines all of theseeffects in a single estimator which is relatively insensitive to populationevolution. here we use a k-corrected and evolution compensated volume-limitedsample drawing about 300 redshifts from cfgrs and 3000 from cnoc2 to measurethe rate and redshift evolution of merging. we identify kinematic pairs withprojected separations less than either 50 or 100 \hkpc and rest-frame velocitydifferences of less than 1000\kms. the fractional luminosity in pairs ismodeled as f_l(delta v,r_p,m_r^{ke})(1+z)^{m_l} where [f_l,m_l] are[0.14+/-0.07,0+/-1.4] and [0.37+/-0.7,0.1+/-0.5] for r_p&lt;= 50 and 100\hkpc,respectively (omega_m=0.2, omega_lambda=0.8). the value of m_l is about 0.6larger if lambda=0. to convert these redshift space statistics to a merger ratewe use the data to derive a conversion factor to physical space pair density, amerger probability and a mean in-spiral time. the resulting mass accretion rateper galaxy (m_1,m_2&gt;= 0.2 m*) is 0.02+/-0.01(1+z)^{0.1+/-0.5} m*~gyr^{-1}.present day high-luminosity galaxies therefore have accreted approximately0.15m* of their mass over the approximately 7 gyr to redshift one.

astro-ph;0004092	a new method for galaxy cluster detection i: the algorithm	numerous methods for finding clusters at moderate to high redshifts have beenproposed in recent years, at wavelengths ranging from radio to x-rays. in thispaper we describe a new method for detecting clusters in two-bandoptical/near-ir imaging data. the method relies upon the observation that allrich clusters, at all redshifts observed so far, appear to have a red sequenceof early-type galaxies. the emerging picture is that all rich clusters containa core population of passively evolving elliptical galaxies which are coevaland formed at high redshifts. the proposed search method exploits this strongempirical fact by using the red sequence as a direct indicator of overdensity.the fundamental advantage of this approach is that with appropriate filters,cluster elliptical galaxies at a given redshift are redder than all normalgalaxies at lower redshifts. a simple color cut thus virtually eliminates allforeground contamination, even at significant redshifts. in this paper, one ofa series of two, we describe the underlying assumptions and basic techniques ofthe method in detail, and contrast the method with those used by other authors.we provide a brief demonstration of the effectiveness of the technique usingreal redshift data, and from this conclude that the method offers a powerfulyet simple way of identify galaxy clusters. we find that the method canreliably detect structures to masses as small as groups with velocitydispersions of only ~300 km/sec, with redshifts for all detected structuresestimated to an accuracy of ~10%.

astro-ph;0106506	environment and galaxy evolution at intermediate redshift in the cnoc2  survey	(abridged) the systematic variation of galaxy colors and types withclustering environment could either be the result of local conditions atformation or subsequent environmental effects as larger scale structures drawtogether galaxies whose stellar mass is largely in place. at z~0.4 theco-moving galaxy correlation length, r_0, measured in the cnoc2 sample isstrongly color dependent, rising from 2/h mpc to nearly 10/h mpc as thevolume-limited subsamples range from blue to red. the luminosity dependence ofr_0 at z~0.4 is weak below l_ast although there is an upturn at high luminositywhere its interpretation depends on separating it from the r_0-color relation.the dominant effect of the group environment on star formation is seen in theradial gradient of the mean galaxy colors which on the average become redderthan the field toward the group centers. the redder-than-field trend applies togroups with a line-of-sight velocity dispersion, sigma_1&gt;150 kms. there is anindication, somewhat statistically insecure, that the high luminosity galaxiesin groups with sigma_1&lt;125 kms become bluer toward the group center. weconclude that the higher velocity dispersion groups largely act to suppressstar formation relative to the less clustered field, leading to ``embalmed''galaxies. the tidal fields within the groups appear to be a strong candidatefor the physical source of the reduction of star formation in group galaxiesrelative to field. tides operate effectively at all velocity dispersions toremove gas rich companions and low density gas in galactic halos. given thatmuch of the field population is in groups we suggest that this suppression maybe the dominant galaxy evolution force at low redshift.

astro-ph;0206103	weak lensing study of galaxy biasing	we combine weak lensing measurements from the red-sequence cluster survey andthe virmos-descart survey, and present the first direct measurements of thebias parameter b and the galaxy-mass cross-correlation coefficient r on scalesranging from 0.2 to 9.3 h_{50}^{-1} mpc at a lens redshift z~0.35. we findstrong evidence that both b and r change with scale for our sample of lensgalaxies (19.5&lt;r_c&lt;21), which have luminosities around l_*. for the currentlyfavored cosmology (\omega_m=0.3,\omega_\lambda=0.7), we find b=0.71^+0.06_-0.04on a scale of 1-2 mpc, increasing to ~1 on larger scales. the value of r hasonly minimal dependence on the assumed cosmology. the variation of r with scaleis very similar to that of b, and reaches a minimum value of r=0.57^+0.08_-0.07(at 1 mpc). this suggests significant stochastic biasing and/or non-linearbiasing. on scales larger than ~4 mpc the value of r is consistent with a valueof 1. in addition we use rcs data alone to measure the ratio b/r on scaleranging from 0.15 to 12.5 mpc, and find that the ratio varies somewhat withscale. we obtain an average value of b/r=1.090+-0.035, in good agreement withprevious estimates. a (future) careful comparison of our results with models ofgalaxy formation can provide unique constraints, as r is linked intimately tothe details of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0211096	correlations of richness and global properties in galaxy clusters	we measure the optical richness of galaxy clusters from the cnoc1 clusterredshift survey using the galaxy-cluster center correlation amplitude b_gc. weshow that the b_gc values measured using photometric catalogs are consistentwith those derived from redshift catalogs, indicating that richness can bemeasured reliably from photometric data alone, even at moderate redshifts of\~0.6. we establish the correlations between optical richness and otherimportant attributes of a galaxy cluster, such as velocity dispersion, mass,radius, and x-ray temperature and luminosity. we find that the scalingrelations of these quantities with richness are entirely consistent with thosederived by assuming a simple mass density profile at 0.5 mpc of rho~r^{-1.8}.the excellent correlations between b_gc and velocity dispersion and x-raytemperature allow one to use richness, an easily measurable quantity usingrelatively shallow optical imaging data alone, as a predictor of thesequantities at moderate redshifts. the b_gc parameter can be used to estimatethe velocity dispersion of a cluster to a precision of approximately 15%(~+/-100 km/s), and x-ray temperature to about 20%. similar correlations, butwith larger scatter, are also obtained between richness and the characteristicradius and mass of the clusters. we compare the relative merits of b_gc, t_x,and l_x as predictors of the dynamical mass, and find that they are comparable,providing estimates at an accuracy of ~30%. we also perform similar analyses ofcorrelations between richness and velocity dispersion, t_x and l_x with asample of low-redshift abell clusters and find consistent results, but withlarger scatter, which may be the result of a less homogeneous database, orsample-dependent effects.

astro-ph;0303341	the incidence of strong-lensing clusters in the red-sequence cluster  survey	the incidence of giant arcs due to strong-lensing clusters of galaxies isknown to be discrepant with current theoretical expectations. this resultderives from a comparison of several cluster samples to predictions in theframework of the currently favored $\lambda$cdm cosmology, and one possibleexplanation for the discrepancy is that this cosmological model is not correct.in this paper we discuss the incidence of giant arcs in the red-sequencecluster survey (rcs), which again shows significant disagreement withtheoretical predictions. we briefly describe a total of eight strong lenssystems, seven of which are discussed here for the first time. based on thedetails of these systems, in particular on the ratio of single to multiple arcsystems, we argue that it may be possible to explain this discrepancy in thecurrently favored cosmology, by modifying the details of the lenses themselves.specifically, the high incidence of multiple arc systems and their overall highredshift suggests that a sub-population of the global cluster population isresponsible for much of the observed lensing. the lack of lensing clusters at$z&lt;0.64$ in the rcs indicates that a property associated with clusters at earlytimes results in the boosted lensing cross sections; likely a combination ofellipticity and elongation along the line of sight, substructure, and changesin the cluster mass profiles is responsible. cluster mass, which should evolveto globally higher values toward lower redshifts, is clearly not the mostsignificant consideration for the formation of giant arcs.

astro-ph;9512087	the average mass-to-light profile of galaxy clusters	the systematic errors in the virial mass-to-light ratio, m_v/l, of galaxyclusters as an estimator of the field m/l value are assessed. we overlay 14clusters in redshift space to create an ensemble cluster which averages oversubstructure and asymmetries. the combined sample, including background,contains about 1150 galaxies, extending to a projected radius of about twicer_200. the radius r_200, defined as where the mean interior density is 200times the critical density, is expected to contain the bulk of the virializedcluster mass. the dynamically derived m(r_200)/l(r_200) of the ensemble is0.82+/-0.14 &lt;m_v/l&gt;. the m_v/l overestimate is attributed to not taking intoaccount the surface pressure term in the virial equation. under the assumptionthat the velocity anisotropy parameter is in the range 0&lt;=\beta&lt;=2/3, thegalaxy distribution accurately traces the mass profile beyond about the central0.3r_200. there are no color or luminosity gradients in the galaxy populationbeyond 2r_200, but there is 0.11+/-0.05 mag fading in the r band luminositiesbetween the field and cluster galaxies. we correct the cluster virialmass-to-light ratio, m_v/l=289+/-50 h\msun/\lsun (calculated assuming q_0=0.1),for the biases in m_v and mean luminosity to estimate the field m/l=213+/-59h\msun/\lsun. with our self-consistently derived field luminosity density,j/\rho_c=1136+/-138 h\msun/\lsun (at z~1/3), the corrected m/l indicates\omega_0=0.19+/-0.06+/-0.04 (formal 1\sigma random error and estimatedpotential systematic errors).

astro-ph;9608016	close pairs of field galaxies in the cnoc1 redshift survey	a redshift sample of 545 field galaxies is used to examine how the galaxymerger rate changes with redshift, and how mergers affect the observedproperties of galaxies in close pairs. close pairs are defined as those withprojected separations less than 20 h^{-1} kpc. at a mean redshift of 0.33, itis found that 7.1 +/- 1.4 % of galaxies are in close physical pairs, comparedto 4.3 +/- 0.4 % locally. the merger rate is estimated to change with redshiftas (1+z)^{2.8 +/- 0.9}. these results are shown to be consistent with previousclose pair studies, and provide one of the strongest constraints to date on theredshift dependence of the merger rate.  as with earlier studies, no significant differences between the meanproperties of paired and isolated galaxies are detected. however, using thesubset of confirmed close physical pairs, those which appear to be undergoinginteractions or mergers (based on their images) are found to have galaxies withstrong emission lines and very blue rest-frame colors. in addition, these pairshave low relative velocities, increasing the likelihood that the galaxies willmerge. we interpret this as the first clear evidence of merger-induced starformation occurring in field galaxies at this redshift.

astro-ph;9805131	the cnoc2 field galaxy redshift survey	the cnoc2 field galaxy redshift survey is designed to provide measurements ofthe evolution of galaxies and their clustering over the redshift range 0 to0.7. the sample is spread over four sky patches with a total area of about 1.5square degrees. here we report preliminary results based on two of the skypatches, and the redshift range of 0.15 to 0.55. we find that galaxy evolutioncan be statistically described as nearly pure luminosity evolution of early andintermediate sed types, and nearly pure density evolution of the late sedtypes. the correlation of blue galaxies relative to red galaxies is similar onlarge scales but drops by a factor of three on scales less than about 0.3/hmpc, approximately the mean scale of virialization. there is a clear, butsmall, 60%, change in clustering with 1.4 mag of luminosity. to minimize thesepopulation effects in our measurement of clustering evolution, we choosegalaxies with m_r^{k,e}&lt;= -20 mag as a population whose members are most likelyto be conserved with redshift. remarkably, the evolution of the clustereddensity in proper co-ordinates at r &lt; 10/h mpc, proportional to r_0^gamma(1+z)^3, is best described as a ``de-clustering'', (1+z)^{0.6+/-0.4}. orequivalently, there is a weak growth of clustering in co-moving co-ordinates,x_0~ (1+z)^{-0.3 +/- 0.2}. this conclusion is supported by the pairwisepeculiar velocities which rise slightly, but not significantly, into the past.the cosmic virial theorem applied to the cnoc2 data gives q omega_m/b=0.11 +/-0.04$, where q is the three point correlation parameter and b the bias.similarly, galaxy groups have a virial mass-to-light ratio (evolutioncorrected) of m_{virial}/l_r^{k,e} = 215h lsun/msun, or omega_m=0.15 +/- 0.05.

astro-ph;9909074	population gradients in galaxy clusters at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6	we present a principal component analysis of galaxy spectra from the cnocsample of rich x-ray luminous clusters at 0.18 &lt; z &lt; 0.55. composite radialdistributions of different stellar populations show strong gradients as afunction of cluster-centric redshift. the composite population is dominated byevolved populations in the core, and gradually changes to one which is similarto coeval field galaxies at radii greater than the virial radius. we do not seeevidence in the clusters for an excess of star formation over that seen in thecoeval field. within this redshift range, significant evolution in the gradientshape is seen, with higher redshift clusters showing steeper gradients. thisresults in larger numbers of younger galaxies seen towards the inner regions ofthe clusters-- in effect, a restatement of the butcher-oemler effect.luminosity density profiles are consistent with a scenario where thisphenomenon is due to a decline over time in the infall rate of field galaxiesinto clusters. depending on how long galaxies reside in clusters before theirstar formation rates are diminished, this suggests an epoch for maximal infallinto clusters at z &gt; 0.7. we also discuss alternative scenarios for theevolution of cluster populations.

astro-ph;9910250	galaxy clustering evolution in the cnoc2 high-luminosity sample	the redshift evolution of the galaxy two-point correlation function is afundamental cosmological statistic. to identify similar galaxy populations atdifferent redshifts, we select a strict volume-limited sample culled from the6100 cataloged cnoc2 galaxies. our high-luminosity subsample selects galaxieshaving k-corrected and evolution-compensated r luminosities, m_r^{k,e}, above-20 mag (h_0=100 km/s/mpc) where m_ast^{k,e}(r)simeq -20.3 mag. this subsamplecontains about 2300 galaxies distributed between redshifts 0.1 and 0.65 spreadover a total of 1.55 square degrees of sky. a similarly defined low-redshiftsample is drawn from the las campanas redshift survey. we find that theco-moving two-point correlation function can be described as xi(r|z) =(r_00/r)^gamma (1+z)^{-(3+epsilon-gamma)} with r_{00}=5.03+/-0.08/h mpc,epsilon=-0.17+/- 0.18 and gamma=1.87+/-0.07 over the z=0.03 to 0.65 redshiftrange, for omega_m=0.2, lambda=0. the measured clustering amplitude and itsevolution are dependent on the adopted cosmology. the measured evolution ratesfor omega_m=1 and flat omega_m=0.2 background cosmologies areepsilon=0.80+/-0.22 and epsilon=-0.81+/-0.19, respectively, with r_{00} of5.30+/-0.1/h mpc and 4.85+/-0.1/h mpc, respectively. the sensitivity of thederived correlations to the evolution corrections and details of themeasurements is presented. the analytic prediction of biased clusteringevolution for only the low density, lambdacdm cosmology is readily consistentwith the observations, with biased clustering in an open cosmology somewhatmarginally excluded and a biased omega_m=1 model predicting clusteringevolution that is more than 6 standard deviations from the measured value.

astro-ph;9910494	the velocity and mass distribution of clusters of galaxies from the  cnoc1 cluster redshift survey	in the context of the cnoc1 cluster survey, redshifts were obtained forgalaxies in 16 clusters. the resulting sample is ideally suited for an analysisof the internal velocity and mass distribution of clusters. previous analysesof this dataset used the jeans equation to model the projected velocitydispersion profile. however, the results of such an analysis always yield astrong degeneracy between the mass density profile and the velocity dispersionanisotropy profile. here we analyze the full (r,v) dataset of galaxy positionsand velocities in an attempt to break this degeneracy. we build an `ensemblecluster' from the individual clusters under the assumption that they form ahomologous sequence. to interpret the data we study a one-parameter family ofspherical models with different constant velocity dispersion anisotropy. thebest-fit model is sought using a variety of statistics, including the overalllikelihood of the dataset. although the results of our analysis depend slightlyon which statistic is used to judge the models, all statistics agree that thebest-fit model is close to isotropic. this result derives primarily from thefact that the observed grand-total velocity histogram is close to gaussian,which is not expected to be the case for a strongly anisotropic model. thebest-fitting models have a mass-to-number-density ratio that is approximatelyindependent of radius over the range constrained by the data. they also have amass-density profile that is consistent with the dark matter halo profileadvocated by navarro, frenk &amp; white, in terms of both the profile shape and thecharacteristic scale length. this adds important new weight to the evidencethat clusters do indeed follow this proposed universal mass density profile.[abridged]
