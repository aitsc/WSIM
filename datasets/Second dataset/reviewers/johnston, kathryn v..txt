0902.2759	galactic dynamics and local dark matter	the concordance lambda cold dark matter (lambda-cdm) model for the formationof structure in the universe, while remarkably successful at describingobservations of structure on large scales, continues to be challenged byobservations on galactic scales. fortunately, cdm models and their variousproposed alternatives make a rich variety of testable predictions that make thelocal group and our own milky way galaxy key laboratories for exploring darkmatter (dm) in this regime. however, some of the most definitive tests of localdm require microarcsecond astrometry of faint sources, an astrometric regimethat is a unique niche of sim lite. this chapter explores the important anddistinct contributions that can be made by sim lite in the exploration ofgalaxy dynamics and dm on galaxy scales and that have cosmologicalconsequences. key areas of potential sim lite exploration include (1) measuringthe shape, orientation, density law, and lumpiness of the dark halo of themilky way and other nearby galaxies, (2) determining the orbits of galacticsatellites, which may be representatives of late infall from the hierarchicalformation of the milky way, (3) ascertaining the distribution of angularmomentum and orbital anisotropy of stars and globular clusters to the outerreaches of the galactic halo, dynamical properties that hold clues to the earlyhierarchical formation of the galaxy, (4) measuring the physical nature of dmby placing strong constraints on the phase space density in the cores of nearbydsph galaxies, and (5) reconstructing the dynamical history of the local groupthrough the determination of orbits and masses of its constituent galaxies.

0908.1111	the dominance of metal-rich streams in stellar halos: a comparison  between substructure in m31 and lambda-cdm models	extensive photometric and spectroscopic surveys of the andromeda galaxy (m31)have discovered tidal debris features throughout m31's stellar halo. we presentstellar kinematics and metallicities in fields with identified substructurefrom our on-going splash survey of m31 red giant branch stars with the deimosspectrograph on the keck ii 10-m telescope. radial velocity criteria are usedto isolate members of the kinematically-cold substructures. the substructuresare shown to be metal-rich relative to the rest of the dynamically hot stellarpopulation in the fields in which they are found. we calculate the meanmetallicity and average surface brightness of the various kinematicalcomponents in each field, and show that, on average, higher surface brightnessfeatures tend to be more metal-rich than lower surface brightness features.simulations of stellar halo formation via accretion in a cosmological contextare used to illustrate that the observed trend can be explained as a naturalconsequence of the observed dwarf galaxy mass-metallicity relation. asignificant spread in metallicity at a given surface brightness is seen in thedata; we show that this is due to time effects, namely the variation in thetime since accretion of the tidal streams' progenitor onto the host halo. weshow that in this theoretical framework a relationship between thealpha-enhancement and surface brightness of tidal streams is expected, whicharises from the varying times of accretion of the progenitor satellites ontothe host halo. thus, measurements of the alpha-enrichment, metallicity, andsurface brightness of tidal debris can be used to reconstruct the luminosityand time of accretion onto the host halo of the progenitors of tidal streams.

0908.3187	evidence for a triaxial milky way dark matter halo from the sagittarius  stellar tidal stream	observations of the lengthy tidal streams produced by the destruction of thesagittarius dwarf spheroidal (sgr dsph) are capable of providing strongconstraints on the shape of the galactic gravitational potential. however,previous work, based on modeling different stream properties in axisymmetricgalactic models has yielded conflicting results: while the angular precessionof the sgr leading arm is most consistent with a spherical or slightly oblatehalo, the radial velocities of stars in this arm are only reproduced by prolatehalo models. we demonstrate that this apparent paradox can be resolved byinstead adopting a triaxial potential. our new galactic halo model, whichsimultaneously fits all well-established phase space constraints from the sgrstream, provides the first conclusive evidence for, and tentative measurementof, triaxiality in an individual dark matter halo. the milky way halo within ~60 kpc is best characterized by a minor/major axis ratio of the isovelocitycontours c/a ~ 0.67, intermediate/major axis ratio b/a ~ 0.83, and triaxialityparameter t ~ 0.56. in this model, the minor axis of the dark halo iscoincident with the galactic x axis connecting the sun and the galactic centerto within ~ 15 degrees, while the major axis also lies in the galactic plane,approximately along the galactic y axis.

0911.0927	wandering stars: an origin of escaped populations	we demonstrate that stars beyond the virial radii of galaxies may begenerated by the gravitational impulse received by a satellite as it passesthrough the pericenter of its orbit around its parent. these stars may becomeenergetically unbound (escaped stars), or may travel to further than a fewvirial radii for longer than a few gyr, but still remain energetically bound tothe system (wandering stars). larger satellites (10-100% the mass of theparent), and satellites on more radial orbits are responsible for the majorityof this ejected population. wandering stars could be observable on mpc scalesvia classical novae, and on 100 mpc scales via snia. the existence of suchstars would imply a corresponding population of barely-bound, old, highvelocity stars orbiting the milky way, generated by the same physical mechanismduring the galaxy's formation epoch. sizes and properties of these combinedpopulations should place some constraints on the orbits and masses of theprogenitor objects from which they came, providing insight into the merginghistories of galaxies in general and the milky way in particular.

1005.4430	measuring transverse motions for nearby galaxy clusters	measuring the full three-dimensional motions of extra-galactic objects in theuniverse presents a seemingly insurmountable challenge. in this paper weinvestigate the application of a technique to measure tangential motion thathas previously only been applied nearby within the local group of galaxies, toclusters of galaxies far beyond its borders. we show that mapping the meanline-of-sight motion throughout a galaxy cluster could in principle be used todetect the "perspective rotation" induced by the projection of the cluster'stangential motion into the line-of-sight. the signal will be most prominent forclusters of the largest angular extent, most symmetric intrinsic velocitydistribution and surveyed with the largest number of pointings possible. weinvestigate the feasibility of detecting this signal using three differentapproaches: measuring line-of-sight motions of individual cluster members;taking spectra of intracluster gas; and mapping distortions of the cosmicmicrowave background radiation. we conclude that future spectroscopic surveysof 1000's of members of nearby galaxy clusters hold the most promise ofmeasuring cluster tangential motions using this technique.

1011.1925	quantifying kinematic substructure in the milky way's stellar halo	we present and analyze the positions, distances, and radial velocities forover 4000 blue horizontal-branch (bhb) stars in the milky way's halo, drawnfrom sdss dr8. we search for position-velocity substructure in these data, asignature of the hierarchical assembly of the stellar halo. using a cumulative"close pair distribution" (cpd) as a statistic in the 4-dimensional space ofsky position, distance, and velocity, we quantify the presence ofposition-velocity substructure at high statistical significance among the bhbstars: pairs of bhb stars that are close in position on the sky tend to havemore similar distances and radial velocities compared to a random sampling ofthese overall distributions. we make analogous mock-observations of 11numerical halo formation simulations, in which the stellar halo is entirelycomposed of disrupted satellite debris, and find a level of substructurecomparable to that seen in the actually observed bhb star sample. this resultquantitatively confirms the hierarchical build-up of the stellar halo through asignature in phase (position-velocity) space. in detail, the structure presentin the bhb stars is somewhat less prominent than that seen in most simulatedhalos, quite possibly because bhb stars represent an older sub-population. bhbstars located beyond 20 kpc from the galactic center exhibit strongersubstructure than at $\rm r_{gc} &lt; 20$ kpc.

1012.2884	clumpy streams from clumpy halos: detecting missing satellites with cold  stellar structures	dynamically cold stellar streams are ideal probes of the gravitational fieldof the milky way. this paper re-examines the question of how such streams mightbe used to test for the presence of "missing satellites" -the many thousands ofdark-matter subhalos with masses 10^5-10^7msolar which are seen to orbit withingalactic-scale dark-matter halos in simulations of structure formation in lcdmcosmologies. analytical estimates of the frequency and energy scales of streamencounters indicate that these missing satellites should have a negligibleeffect on hot debris structures, such as the tails from the sagittarius dwarfgalaxy. however, long cold streams, such as the structure known as gd-1 orthose from the globular cluster palomar 5 (pal 5) are expected to suffer manytens of direct impacts from missing satellites during their lifetimes.numerical experiments confirm that these impacts create gaps in the debris'orbital energy distribution, which will evolve into degree- and sub-degree-scale fluctuations in surface density over the age of the debris. maps of pal5's own stream contain surface density fluctuations on these scales. thepresence and frequency of these inhomogeneities suggests the existence of apopulation of missing satellites in numbers predicted in the standard lcdmcosmologies.

1101.3561	galaxia: a code to generate a synthetic survey of the milky way	we present here a fast code for creating a synthetic survey of the milky way.given one or more color-magnitude bounds, a survey size and geometry, the codereturns a catalog of stars in accordance with a given model of the milky way.the model can be specified by a set of density distributions or as an n-bodyrealization. we provide fast and efficient algorithms for sampling both typesof models. as compared to earlier sampling schemes which generate stars atspecified locations along a line of sight, our scheme can generate a continuousand smooth distribution of stars over any given volume. the code is quitegeneral and flexible and can accept input in the form of a star formation rate,age metallicity relation, age velocity dispersion relation and analytic densitydistribution functions. theoretical isochrones are then used to generate acatalog of stars and support is available for a wide range of photometricbands. as a concrete example we implement the besancon milky way model for thedisc. for the stellar halo we employ the simulated stellar halo n-body modelsof bullock &amp; johnston (2005). in order to sample n-body models, we present ascheme that disperses the stars spawned by an n-body particle, in such a waythat the phase space density of the spawned stars is consistent with that ofthe n-body particles. the code is ideally suited to generating synthetic datasets that mimic near future wide area surveys such as gaia, lsst and hermes. asan application we study the prospect of identifying structures in the stellarhalo with a simulated gaia survey. we plan to make the code publicly availableat http://galaxia.sourceforge.net.

0709.2076	the stellar content of galaxy halos: a comparison between lambdacdm  models and observations of m31	recent observations have revealed that high surface-brightness, metal-richdebris is present over large regions of the andromeda (m31) stellar halo. weuse a set of numerical models to determine whether extended metal-rich debrisis expected to exist in galaxy halos formed in a hierarchical lambdacdmuniverse. we identify tidal debris in the simulations according to the currentbest surface brightness detection limits in m31 and demonstrate that brightfeatures in the outer halo regions usually originate from single satellites,with very little contamination from other sources due to the low probability oftidal streams from two overlapping accretion events. in contrast, high-surfacebrightness features in the inner halo often originate from multipleprogenitors. we also compare the age and metallicity distribution of the debriswith the well-mixed stellar halos in which they reside. we find thathigh-surface brightness tidal debris is produced almost exclusively byrelatively high mass progenitors (mstar ~ 10^7- 10^9 msun) and thus is expectedto be of moderate- to high-metallicity. similarly, in our models the smoothinner halo is expected to be metal-rich as this region has been built up mainlyfrom massive satellites. our results imply that the stellar populations ofsubstructure observed around external galaxies with current techniques shouldnot resemble old and metal-poor dwarf spheroidal satellites, nor the underlyingcomponent of the stellar halo.

1202.5310	identifying contributions to the stellar halo from accreted, kicked-out,  and in situ populations	[abridged] we present a medium-resolution spectroscopic survey of late-typegiant stars at mid-galactic latitudes of (30$^{\circ}&lt;|b|&lt;60^{\circ}$),designed to probe the properties of this population to distances of $\sim$9kpc. because m giants are generally metal-rich and we have limitedcontamination from thin disk stars by the latitude selection, most of the starsin the survey are expected to be members of the thick disk($&lt;$[fe/h]$&gt;\sim$-0.6) with some contribution from the metal-rich component ofthe nearby halo.  here we report first results for 1799 stars. the distribution of radialvelocity (rv) as a function of l for these stars shows (1) the expected thickdisk population and (2) local metal-rich halo stars moving at high speedsrelative to the disk, that in some cases form distinct sequences in rv-$l$space. high-resolution echelle spectra taken for 34 of these "rv outliers"reveal the following patterns across the [ti/fe]-[fe/h] plane: seventeen of thestars have abundances reminiscent of the populations present in dwarfsatellites of the milky way; eight have abundances coincident with those of thegalactic disk and more metal-rich halo; and nine of the stars fall on the locusdefined by the majority of stars in the halo. the chemical abundance trends ofthe rv outliers suggest that this sample consists predominantly of starsaccreted from infalling dwarf galaxies. a smaller fraction of stars in the rvoutlier sample may have been formed in the inner galaxy and subsequently kickedto higher eccentricity orbits, but the sample is not large enough todistinguish conclusively between this interpretation and the alternative thatthese stars represent the tail of the velocity distribution of the thick disk.our data do not rule out the possibility that a minority of the sample couldhave formed from gas {\it in situ} on their current orbits.

1202.5311	probing the halo from the solar vicinity to the outer galaxy: connecting  stars in local velocity structures to large-scale clouds	(abridged) this paper presents the first connections made between two localfeatures in velocity-space found in a survey of m giant stars and stellarspatial inhomogeneities on global scales. comparison to cosmological,chemodynamical stellar halo models confirm that the m giant population isparticularly sensitive to rare, recent and massive accretion events. theseevents can give rise to local observed velocity sequences - a signature of asmall fraction of debris from a common progenitor, passing at high velocitythrough the survey volume, near the pericenters of their eccentric orbits. themajority of the debris is found in much larger structures, whose morphologiesare more cloud-like than stream-like and which lie at the orbital apocenters.adopting this interpretation, the full-space motions represented by theobserved velocity features are derived under the assumption that the memberswithin each sequence share a common velocity. orbit integrations are then usedto trace the past and future trajectories of these stars across the skyrevealing plausible associations with large, previously-discovered, cloud-likestructures. the connections made between nearby velocity structures and thesedistant clouds represent preliminary steps towards developing coherent maps ofsuch giant debris systems. these maps promise to provide new insights into theorigin of debris clouds, new probes of galactic history and structure, and newconstraints on the high-velocity tails of the local dark matter distributionthat are essential for interpreting direct detection experiments.

1207.2768	identifying local group field galaxies which have interacted with the  milky way	we distinguish between local group field galaxies which may have passedthrough the virial volume of the milky way, and those which have not, via astatistical compari- son against populations of dark matter haloes in the vialactea ii (vlii) simulation with known orbital histories. analysis of vliiprovides expectations for this escaped population: they contribute 13 per centof the galactic population between 300 and 1500 kpc from the milky way, andhence we anticipate that about 7 of the 54 known local group galaxies in thatdistance range are likely to be milky way escapees. these objects can be of anymass below that of the milky way, and they are expected to have positive radialvelocities with respect to the milky way. comparison of the radius-velocitydistributions of vlii populations and measurements of local group galaxiespresents a strong likelihood that tucana, cetus, ngc3109, sextansa, sextansb,antlia, ngc6822, phoenix, leot, and ngc185 have passed through the milky way.most of these dwarfs have a lower hi mass fraction than the majority of dwarfslying at similar distances to either the milky way or m31. indeed, several ofthese galaxies - especially those with lower masses - contain signatures intheir morphology, star formation history and/or gas content indicative ofevolution seen in simulations of satellite/parent galactic interactions. ourresults offer strong support for scenarios in which dwarfs of different typesform a sequence in morphology and gas content, with evolution along thesequence being driven by interaction history.

1211.1071	the effect of feedback and reionization on star formation in low-mass  dwarf galaxy haloes	we simulate the evolution of a 10^9 msun dark matter halo in a cosmologicalsetting with an adaptive-mesh refinement code as an analogue to local lowluminosity dwarf irregular and dwarf spheroidal galaxies. the primary goal ofour study is to investigate the roles of reionization and supernova feedback indetermining the star formation histories of low mass dwarf galaxies. we includea wide range of physical effects, including metal cooling, molecular hydrogenformation and cooling, photoionization and photodissociation from ametagalactic background, a simple prescription for self-shielding, starformation, and a simple model for supernova driven energetic feedback. we carryout simulations excluding each major effect in turn. we find that reionizationis primarily responsible for expelling most of the gas in our simulations, butthat supernova feedback is required to disperse the dense, cold gas in the coreof the halo. moreover, we show that the timing of reionization can produce anorder of magnitude difference in the final stellar mass of the system. for ourfull physics run with reionization at z=9, we find a stellar mass of about 10^5msun at z=0, and a mass-to-light ratio within the half-light radius ofapproximately 130 msun/lsun, consistent with observed low-luminosity dwarfs.however, the resulting median stellar metallicity is 0.06 zsun, considerablylarger than observed systems. in addition, we find star formation is truncatedbetween redshifts 4 and 7, at odds with the observed late time star formationin isolated dwarf systems but in agreement with milky way ultrafaint dwarfspheroidals. we investigate the efficacy of energetic feedback in our simplethermal-energy driven feedback scheme, and suggest that it may still sufferfrom excessive radiative losses, despite reaching stellar particle masses ofabout 100 msun, and a comoving spatial resolution of 11 pc.

0712.4312	modeling the structure and dynamics of dwarf spheroidal galaxies with  dark matter and tides	we report the results of n-body simulations of disrupting satellites aimed atexploring whether the observed features of dsphs can be accounted for withsimple, mass-follows-light (mfl) models including tidal disruption. as a testcase, we focus on the carina dwarf spheroidal (dsph), which presently has themost extensive data at large radius. we find that previous n-body, mflsimulations of dsphs did not sufficiently explore the parameter space ofsatellite mass, density and orbital shape to find adequate matches to galacticdsph systems, whereas with a systematic survey of parameter space we are ableto find tidally disrupting, mfl satellite models that rather faithfullyreproduce carina's velocity profile, velocity dispersion profile and projecteddensity distribution over its entire sampled radius. the successful mfl modelsatellites have very eccentric orbits, currently favored by cold dark matter(cdm) models, and central velocity dispersions that still yield an accuraterepresentation of the bound mass and observed central m/l~40 of carina, despiteinflation of the velocity dispersion outside the dsph core by unbound debris.our survey of parameter space also allows us to address a number of commonlyheld misperceptions of tidal disruption and its observable effects on dsphstructure and dynamics. the simulations suggest that even modest tidaldisruption can have a profound effect on the observed dynamics of dsph stars atlarge radii. satellites that are well-described by tidally disrupting mflmodels could still be fully compatible with l-cdm if for example they representa later stage in the evolution of luminous subhalos.

1306.5239	chemical abundance patterns and the early environment of dwarf galaxies	recent observations suggest that abundance pattern differences exist betweenlow metallicity stars in the milky way stellar halo and those in the dwarfsatellite galaxies. this paper takes a first look at what role the earlyenvironment for pre-galactic star formation might have played in shaping thesestellar populations. in particular, we consider whether differences incross-pollution between the progenitors of the stellar halo and the satellitescould help to explain the differences in abundance patterns. using an n-bodysimulation, we find that the progenitor halos of the main halo are primarilyclustered together at z=10 while the progenitors of the satellite galaxiesremain on the outskirts of this cluster. next, analytically modeledsupernova-driven winds show that main halo progenitors cross-pollute each othermore effectively while satellite galaxy progenitors remain more isolated. thus,inhomogeneous cross-pollution as a result of different high-z spatial locationsof each system's progenitors can help to explain observed differences inabundance patterns today. conversely, these differences are a signature of theinhomogeneity of metal enrichment at early times.

1307.2894	a mass-dependent yield origin of neutron-capture element abundance  distributions in ultra-faint dwarfs	one way to constrain the nature of the high-redshift progenitors of the milkyway is to look at the low-metallicity stellar populations of the differentgalactic components today. for example, high-resolution spectroscopy of verymetal poor (vmp) stars demonstrates remarkable agreement between thedistribution of [ti/fe] in the stellar populations of the milky way halo (mw)and ultra-faint dwarf (ufd) galaxies. in contrast, for the neutron capture (nc)abundance ratio distributions [(sr,ba)/fe], the peak of the small ufd sample (6stars) exhibits a signicant under-abundance relative to the vmp stars in thelarger mw halo sample (~ 300 stars). we present a simple scenario that cansimultaneously explain these similarities and differences by assuming: (i) thatthe mw vmp stars were predominately enriched by a prior generation of starswhich possessed a higher total mass than the prior generation of stars thatenriched the ufd vmp stars; and (ii) a much stronger mass-dependent yield (mdy)for nc-elements than for the (known) mdy for ti. simple statistical testsdemonstrate that conditions (i) and (ii) are consistent with the observedabundance distributions, albeit without strong constraints on model parameters.a comparison of the broad constraints for these nc-mdy with those derived inthe literature seems to rule out ba production from low-mass sns and affirmsmodels that primarily generate yields from high-mass sn. our scenario can beconfirmed by a relatively modest (factor of ~ 3-4) increase in the number ofhigh-resolution spectra of vmp stars in ufds.

1308.2670	spitzer, gaia, and the potential of the milky way	near-future data from esa's gaia mission will provide precise, fullphase-space information for hundreds of millions of stars out to heliocentricdistances of ~10 kpc. this "horizon" for full phase-space measurements isimposed by the gaia parallax errors degrading to worse than 10%, and could besignificantly extended by an accurate distance indicator. recent work hasdemonstrated how spitzer observations of rr lyrae stars can be used to makedistance estimates accurate to 2%, effectively extending the gaia, precise-datahorizon by a factor of ten in distance and a factor of 1000 in volume. thisletter presents one approach to exploit data of such accuracy to measure thegalactic potential using small samples of stars associated with debris fromsatellite destruction. the method is tested with synthetic observations of 100stars from the end point of a simulation of satellite destruction: the shape,orientation, and depth of the potential used in the simulation are recovered towithin a few percent. the success of this simple test with such a small samplein a single debris stream suggests that constraints from multiple streams couldbe combined to examine the galaxy's dark matter halo in even more detail --- atruly unique opportunity that is enabled by the combination of spitzer and gaiawith our intimate perspective on the galaxy.

1309.5535	discovery of a dynamical cold point in the heart of the sagittarius dsph  galaxy with observations from the apogee project	the dynamics of the core of the sagittarius (sgr) dwarf spheroidal (dsph)galaxy are explored using high-resolution (r~22,500), h-band, near-infraredspectra of over 1,000 giant stars in the central 3 deg^2 of the system, ofwhich 328 are identified as sgr members. these data, among some of the earliestobservations from the sdss-iii/apache point observatory galactic evolutionexperiment (apogee) and the largest published sample of high resolution sgrdsph spectra to date, reveal a distinct gradient in the velocity dispersion ofsgr from 11-14 km/s for radii &gt;0.8 degrees from center to a dynamical coldpoint of 8 km/s in the sgr center --- a trend differing from that found inprevious kinematical analyses of sgr over larger scales that suggest a more orless flat dispersion profile at these radii. well-fitting mass models witheither cored and cusped dark matter distributions can be found to match thekinematical results, although the cored profile succeeds with significantlymore isotropic stellar orbits than required for a cusped profile. it isunlikely that the cold point reflects an unusual mass distribution. thedispersion gradient may arise from variations in the mixture of populationswith distinct kinematics within the dsph; this explanation is suggested (e.g.,by detection of a metallicity gradient across similar radii), but notconfirmed, by the present data. despite these remaining uncertainties abouttheir interpretation, these early test data (including some from instrumentcommissioning) demonstrate apogee's usefulness for precision dynamical studies,even for fields observed at extreme airmasses.

1405.6721	inferring the gravitational potential of the milky way with a few  precisely measured stars	the dark matter halo of the milky way is expected to be triaxial and filledwith substructure. it is hoped that streams or shells of stars produced bytidal disruption of stellar systems will provide precise measures of thegravitational potential to test these predictions. we develop a method forinferring the galactic potential with tidal streams based on the idea that thestream stars were once close in phase space. our method can flexibly adapt toany form for the galactic potential: it works in phase-space rather thanaction-space and hence relies neither on our ability to derive actions nor onthe integrability of the potential. our model is probabilistic, with alikelihood function and priors on the parameters. the method can properlyaccount for finite observational uncertainties and missing data dimensions. wetest our method on synthetic datasets generated from n-body simulations ofsatellite disruption in a static, multi-component milky way including atriaxial dark matter halo with observational uncertainties chosen to mimiccurrent and near-future surveys of various stars. we find that with just fourwell-measured stream stars, we can infer properties of a triaxial potentialwith precisions of order 5-7 percent. without proper motions we obtain 15percent constraints on potential parameters and precisions around 25 percentfor recovering missing phase-space coordinates. these results are encouragingfor the eventual goal of using flexible, time-dependent potential modelscombined with larger data sets to unravel the detailed shape of the dark matterdistribution around the milky way.

1406.6063	milky way mass and potential recovery using tidal streams in a realistic  halo	we present a new method for determining the galactic gravitational potentialbased on forward modeling of tidal stellar streams. we use this method to testthe performance of smooth and static analytic potentials in representingrealistic dark matter halos, which have substructure and are continuallyevolving by accretion. our fast-forward method uses a markov chain monte carloalgorithm to compare, in 6d phase space, an "observed" stream to models createdin trial analytic potentials. we analyze a large sample of streams evolved inthe via lactea ii (vl2) simulation, which represents a realistic galactic halopotential. the recovered potential parameters are in agreement with the bestfit to the global, present-day vl2 potential. however, merely assuming ananalytic potential limits the dark matter halo mass measurement to an accuracyof 5 to 20%, depending on the choice of analytic parametrization. collectively,mass estimates using streams from our sample reach this fundamental limit, butindividually they can be highly biased. individual streams can both under- andoverestimate the mass, and the bias is progressively worse for those withsmaller perigalacticons, motivating the search for tidal streams atgalactocentric distances larger than 70 kpc. we estimate that the assumption ofa static and smooth dark matter potential in modeling of the gd-1 and pal5-likestreams introduces an error of up to 50% in the milky way mass estimates.

1410.6166	reconstructing the accretion history of the galactic stellar halo from  chemical abundance ratio distributions	observational studies of halo stars during the last two decades have placedsome limits on the quantity and nature of accreted dwarf galaxy contributionsto the milky way stellar halo by typically utilizing stellar phase-spaceinformation to identify the most recent halo accretion events. in this study wetested the prospects of using 2-d chemical abundance ratio distributions(cards) found in stars of the stellar halo to determine its formation history.first, we used simulated data from eleven "mw-like" halos to generate satellitetemplate sets of 2-d cards of accreted dwarf satellites which are comprised ofaccreted dwarfs from various mass regimes and epochs of accretion. next, werandomly drew samples of $\sim10^{3-4}$ mock observations of stellar chemicalabundance ratios ([$\alpha$/fe], [fe/h]) from those eleven halos to generatesamples of the underlying densities for our cards to be compared to ourtemplates in our analysis. finally, we used the expectation-maximizationalgorithm to derive accretion histories in relation to the satellite templateset (sts) used and the sample size. for certain sts used we typically canidentify the relative mass contributions of all accreted satellites to within afactor of 2. we also find that this method is particularly sensitive to olderaccretion events involving low-luminous dwarfs e.g. ultra-faint dwarfs -precisely those events that are too ancient to be seen by phase-space studiesof stars and too faint to be seen by high-z studies of the early universe.since our results only exploit two chemical dimensions and near-future surveyspromise to provide $\sim6-9$ dimensions, we conclude that these newhigh-resolution spectroscopic surveys of the stellar halo will allow us torecover its accretion history - and the luminosity function of infalling dwarfgalaxies - across cosmic time.

1503.08780	a re-interpretation of the triangulum-andromeda stellar clouds: a  population of halo stars kicked out of the galactic disk	the triangulum-andromeda stellar clouds (triand1 and triand2) are a pair ofconcentric ring- or shell-like over-densities at large $r$ ($\approx$ 30 kpc)and $z$ ($\approx$ -10 kpc) in the galactic halo that are thought to have beenformed from the accretion and disruption of a satellite galaxy. this papercritically re-examines this formation scenario by comparing the number ratio ofrr lyrae to m giant stars associated with the triand clouds with otherstructures in the galaxy. the current data suggest a stellar population forthese over-densities ($f_{\rm rr:mg} &lt; 0.38$ at 95% confidence) quite unlikeany of the known satellites of the milky way ($f_{\rm rr:mg} \approx 0.5$ forthe very largest and $f_{\rm rr:mg} &gt;&gt;1$ for the smaller satellites) and morelike the population of stars born in the much deeper potential well inhabitedby the galactic disk ($f_{\rm rr:mg} &lt; 0.01$). n-body simulations of amilky-way-like galaxy perturbed by the impact of a dwarf galaxy demonstratethat, in the right circumstances, concentric rings propagating outwards fromthat galactic disk can plausibly produce similar over-densities. these resultsprovide dramatic support for the recent proposal by xu et al. (2015) that,rather than stars accreted from other galaxies, the triand clouds couldrepresent stars kicked-out from our own disk. if so, these would be the firstpopulations of disk stars to be found in the galactic halo and a clearsignature of the importance of this second formation mechanism for stellarhalos more generally. moreover, their existence at the very extremities of thedisk places strong constraints on the nature of the interaction that formedthem.

1509.06369	tidal debris morphology and the orbits of satellite galaxies	how do galaxies move relative to one another? while we can examine the motionof dark matter subhalos around their hosts in simulations of structureformation, determining the orbits of satellites around their parent galaxiesfrom observations is impossible except for a small number of nearby cases. inthis work we outline a novel approach to probing the orbital distributions ofinfalling satellite galaxies using the morphology of tidal debris structures.it has long been understood that the destruction of satellites on near-radialorbits tends to lead to the formation of shells of debris, while those on lesseccentric orbits produce tidal streams. we combine an understanding of thescaling relations governing the orbital properties of debris with a simplemodel of how these orbits phase-mix over time to produce a `morphology metric'that more rigorously quantifies the conditions required for shells to beapparent in debris structures as a function of the satellite's mass and orbitand the interaction time. using this metric we demonstrate how differences inorbit distributions can alter the relative frequency of shells and streamstructures observed around galaxies. these experiments suggest that moredetailed modeling and careful comparisons with current and future surveys oflow surface brightness features around nearby galaxies should be capable ofactually constraining orbital distributions and provide new insights into ourunderstanding of structure formation.

astro-ph;0111196	how lumpy is the milky way's dark matter halo?	cdm simulations predict that there are hundreds of lumps of with massesgreater than 10e7 solar masses in the milky way halo. however, we know of onlya dozen dwarf satellites close to this mass. are these lumps simply lacking instars or is there a fundamental flaw in our most popular cosmology? by studyingthe tidal debris of known satellites we can potentially address this question.in this paper, we quantify the the effects of the dark matter lumps on tidaltails. the lumps scatter stars in the tidal tails from their original orbitsproducing a distinctive signature. we simulate debris evolution in smooth andlumpy halos potentials and use our simulations to motivate and test astatistical measure of the degree of scattering apparent in the angularposition and radial velocity measurement of debris stars - the ``scatteringindex''. we find that the scattering index can in general distinguish betweenthe levels of substructure predicted by cdm cosmologies and smooth milky waymodels, but that the sensitivity of the debris depends on the orientation ofthe parent satellite's orbit relative to the largest lumps orbits.  we apply our results to the carbon star stream associated with thesagittarius dwarf galaxy (sgr) and find that these stars appear to be morescattered than we expect for debris orbiting in a smooth halo. however, thedegree of scattering is entirely consistent with that expected due to theinfluence of the large magellanic cloud, which is on an orbit that intersectssgr's own. we conclude that the current data is unable to constrain cdm models.nevertheless, our study suggests that future data sets of debris starsassociated with other milky way satellites could provide strong constraints oncdm models.

astro-ph;0111465	tidal interaction of m32 and ngc 205 with m31: surface photometry and  numerical simulations	we investigate the interaction history of the m31 sub-group of galaxies bycomparing surface photometry of its two nearest satellites, m32 and ngc 205,with n-body simulations of satellite destruction. the recent discovery of agiant stream in m31's outer halo, apparently pointed towards m32 and ngc 205,makes such an investigation particularly relevant. the observational componentof this study is based on 1.7 x 5.0 degree b- and i- band ccd mosaic imagescentered on m31 and covering both satellites. the simulation component of thisproject is based on the analysis of single-component, spherical modelsatellites that are tidally disrupted through interactions with their parentgalaxy. generic features of the simulations include an excess in the surfacebrightness profile at large radii, a depletion zone at intermediate radii, andisophotal elongation and twists that are coincident with breaks in thebrightness profile. the satellites m32 and ngc 205 display most of thesefeatures consistently across the b and i bands, strongly suggestive of tidalinteraction and probable stripping by m31. we discuss what these observedfeatures can tell us about the satellites' orbital parameters and histories.specifically, m32 is found to be on a highly eccentric orbit and away frompericenter. investigating m32's unusual combination of high surface brightnessand low luminosity (the hallmark of compact ellipticals), we conclude onempirical grounds that m32 is not likely to be the residual core of atidally-stripped normal elliptical galaxy as has been suggested, but ratherthat its precursor was intrinsically compact.

astro-ph;0111466	interpreting the morphology of diffuse light around satellite galaxies	recent observations of surface brightness distributions of both milky way andm31 satellite galaxies have revealed many instances of sudden changes or breaksin the slope of the surface brightness profiles (at some break radius,r_break). these breaks are often accompanied by increasingly ellipticalisophotes and sometimes by isophote twisting. we investigate the hypothesis ofa tidal origin for these features by applying the same ellipse fittingtechniques that are used on observed galaxies to numerical simulations of thedestruction of satellites, represented by spherical, single-component systems.we examine how observed quantities such as r_break, ellipticity and positionangle of the fitted ellipses and amplitude of extra-break population vary withthe satellite's orbital eccentricity and phase, and our viewpoint relative tothe orbit. we also look at orbit and viewpoint dependence of the rate of changeof the latter three quantities with radius.  we find that there are trends with orbital phase and eccentricity in allobserved quantities, many of which are preserved through a wide variety ofviewing angles. in particular, a generic feature of all simulations is adepletion zone just interior to an excess zone, regions in which the surfacebrightness is lower and higher, respectively, than the initial profile. a clearinterpretation of any individual image, however, is likely to be hampered bythe dependence of the observable features on these multiple parameters. forexample, breaks can be excited by several physical processes and can occur wellwithin the bound satellite population. nevertheless, we do find we can placeloose constraints on the tidal radius, mass loss rate, orbital type and phaseof the satellite, and nature of breaks using photometric data alone.

astro-ph;0401625	cosmology and the stellar halo	if the favored hierarchical cosmological model is correct, then the milky waysystem should have accreted and subsequently tidally destroyed ~100 low-massgalaxies in the past ~12 gyr. we model this process using a hybridsemi-analytic plus n-body approach and show that the disrupted systems leadnaturally to stellar halos with masses and density profiles much like thestellar halo of our own galaxy. we present predictions for the properties ofstellar halos and show that ours is likely dominated by substructure beyond\~50kpc and more spatially smooth within that radius. the average stellar halodensity profile is expected to drop off with radius more quickly than that ofthe dark matter because the stellar halo is formed from the most tightly boundmaterial in infalling systems, while the majority of the accreted dark matteris stripped and deposited at larger radii. we argue that stars associated withthe inner halo should be quite different chemically from stars in survivingsatellites and also different from stars in the outer halo or those liberatedin recent disruption events. we discuss how deep halo surveys and chemicalprobes may be useful tools for uncovering evidence of accretion. searches ofthis kind offer a direct test of whether cosmology is indeed hierarchical onsmall scales.

(2004, astro-ph/0406146) discusses possibleorbits, implications of the coldness of the stream, and progenitor satelliteproperties. the kinematics (and perhaps [fe/h] distribution) of our halo sampleindicate that it is different from other m31 halo samples; this may be anindication of substructure in the halo. the stream seems to have a higher mean[fe/h] than the halo, -0.51 vs -0.74 dex, and a smaller [fe/h] spread. thestream's high metallicity implies that its progenitor must have been a luminousdwarf galaxy. the caii triplet strengths of the m31 giants are generallyconsistent with photometric estimates of their metallicity (derived by fittingrgb fiducials in the color-magnitude diagram). there is indirect evidence ofintermediate-age stars in the stream.

astro-ph;0605098	exploring halo substructure with giant stars xi: the tidal tails of the  carina dwarf spheroidal and the discovery of magellanic cloud stars in the  carina foreground	a new large-area washington m,t_2+ddo51 filter survey of more than 10 deg^2around the carina dsph galaxy reveals a spectroscopically confirmed power lawradial density "break" population of carina giant stars extending severaldegrees beyond the central king profile. magellan telescope mike spectroscopyestablishes the existence of carina stars to at least 4.5 times its centralking limiting radius, r_lim and primarily along carina's major axis. to keepthese stars bound to the dsph would require a global carina mass-to-light ratioof m/l &gt; 6,300 m/l_sun. the mike velocities, supplemented with ~950 additionalcarina field velocities from archived vlt+giraffe spectra with r&lt;=r_lim,demonstrate a nearly constant carina velocity dispersion to just beyond r =r_lim, and both a rising velocity dispersion and a velocity shear at stilllarger radii. together, the observational evidence suggests that the discoveredextended carina population represents tidal debris from the dsph. of 65 giantcandidates at large angular radii from the carina center for which mike spectrahave been obtained 94% are associated either with carina or a second, newlydiscovered diffuse, but strongly radial velocity-coherent (velocity dispersionof 9.8 km s^-1), foreground halo system. the fifteen stars in this second,retrograde velocity population have (1) a mean metallicity ~1 dex higher thanthat of carina, and (2) colors and magnitudes consistent with the red clump ofthe large magellanic cloud (lmc). additional spectroscopy of giant starcandidates in fields linking carina and the lmc shows a smooth velocitygradient between the lmc and the retrograde carina moving group. we concludethat we have found magellanic stars almost twice as far (22 deg) from the lmccenter than previously known.

astro-ph;0611852	probing the nature of the g1 clump stellar overdensity in the outskirts  of m31	we present deep hst/acs observations of the g1 clump, a distinct stellaroverdensity lying at ~30 kpc along the south-western major axis of m31 close tothe g1 globular cluster (ferguson et al. 2002). our well-populatedcolour-magnitude diagram reaches ~7 magnitudes below the red giant branch tipwith 90% completeness, and allows the detection of various morphologicalfeatures which can be used to derive detailed constraints on the age andmetallicity of the constituent stellar population. we find that thecolour-magnitude diagram is best described by a population with a large agerange (&gt;= 10 gyr) and a relatively high mean metallicity [m/h]= -0.4. thespread in metallicity is constrained to be &lt;=0.5 dex. the star formation ratein this region has declined over time, with the bulk of the stellar mass havingformed &gt;6 gyr ago. nonetheless, a non-negligible mass fraction (approximately10%) of the population has formed in the last 2 gyr. we discuss the nature ofthe g1 clump in light of these new stellar population constraints and arguethat the combination of stellar content and physical size make it unlikely thatthe structure is the remnant of an accreted dwarf galaxy. instead, the strongsimilarity between the stellar content of the g1 clump and that of the m31outer disk suggests the substructure is a fragment of the outer disk, perhapstorn off from the main body during a past accretion/merger event; thisinterpretation is consistent with extant kinematical data. if thisinterpretation is correct, our analysis of the stellar content provides furtherevidence that the outskirts of large disk galaxies have been in place for asignificant time.

astro-ph;9602060	fossil signatures of ancient accretion events in the halo	the role that minor mergers have played in the formation and structure of themilky way is still an open question, about which there is much debate. we usenumerical simulations to explore the evolution of debris from a tidallydisrupted satellite, with the aim of developing a method that can be used toidentify and quantify signatures of accretion in a survey of halo stars. for amilky way with a spherical halo, we find that debris from minor mergers canremain aligned along great circles throughout the lifetime of the galaxy. weexploit this result to develop the method of great circle cell counts (gc3),which we test by applying it to artificially constructed halo distributions.our results suggest that if as few as 1\% of the stars in a halo survey areaccreted from the disruption of a single subsystem smaller than the largemagellanic cloud, gc3 can recover the great circle associated with this debris.the dispersion in gc3 can also be used to detect the presence of structurecharacteristic of accretion in distributions containing a much smallerpercentage of material accreted from any single satellite.

astro-ph;9710007	a prescription for building the milky way's halo from disrupted  satellites	we develop a semi-analytic method for determining the phase-space populationof tidal debris along the orbit of a disrupting satellite galaxy and illustrateits use with a number of applications. we use this method to analyze zhao'sproposal that the microlensing events towards the large magellanic cloud (lmc)might be explained by an appropriately placed tidal streamer, and find that hisscenarios lead either to unacceptably high overdensities (10 -- 100%) in faintstar counts (apparent magnitudes 17.5 -- 20.5) away from the galactic plane orshort timescales for the debris to disperse (10^8 years). we predict that thetidal streamers from the lmc and the sagittarius dwarf galaxy currently extendover more than $2\pi$ in azimuth along their orbits. assuming that eachsatellite has lost half of its primordial mass, we find that the streamers willhave overdensities in faint star counts of 10 -- 100% and &lt; 1% respectively,and conclude that this mass loss rate is unlikely for the lmc, but possible forsagittarius. if the galaxy has accreted one hundred $10^5-10^6 m_{\odot}$objects (comparable to its current population of globular clusters) atdistances of 20 -- 100 kpc during its lifetime then 10% of the sky will now becovered by tidal streamers.

astro-ph;9805291	measuring mass loss rates from galactic satellites	we present the results of a study that uses numerical simulations tointerpret observations of tidally disturbed satellites around the milky way.when analysing the simulations from the viewpoint of an observer, we find abreak in the slope of the star count and velocity dispersion profiles in ourmodels at the location where unbound stars dominate. we conclude that`extra-tidal' stars and enhanced velocity dispersions observed in the outskirtsof galactic satellites are due to contamination by stellar debris from thetidal interaction with the milky way. however, a significant bound populationcan exist beyond the break radius and we argue that it should not be identifiedwith the tidal radius of the satellite. we also develop and test a method fordetermining the mass loss rate from a galactic satellite using its extra-tidalpopulation. we apply this method to observations of globular clusters and dwarfspheroidal satellites of the milky way, and conclude that a significantfraction of both satellite systems are likely be destroyed within the nexthubble time. finally, we demonstrate that this mass loss estimate allows us toplace some limits on the initial mass function (imf) of stars in a cluster fromthe radial dependence of its present day mass function (pdmf).

astro-ph;9807243	tidal streams as probes of the galactic potential	we explore the use of tidal streams from galactic satellites to recover thepotential of the milky way. our study is motivated both by the discovery of thefirst lengthy stellar stream in the halo (\cite{it98}) and by the prospect ofmeasuring proper motions of stars brighter than 20th magnitude in such a streamwith an accuracy of $\sim 4\mu as/$yr, as will be possible with the spaceinterferometry mission (sim). we assume that the heliocentric radial velocitiesof these stars can be determined from supporting ground-based spectroscopicsurveys, and that the mass and phase-space coordinates of the galacticsatellite with which they are associated will also be known to sim accuracy.using results from numerical simulations as trial data sets, we find that, ifwe assume the correct form for the galactic potential, we can predict thedistances to the stars as a consequence of the narrow distribution of energyexpected along the streams. we develop an algorithm to evaluate the accuracy ofany adopted potential by requiring that the satellite and stars recombinewithin a galactic lifetime when their current phase-space coordinates areintegrated backwards. when applied to a four-dimensional grid of triaxiallogarithmic potentials, with varying circular velocities, axis ratios andorientation of the major-axis in the disk plane, the algorithm can recover theparameters used for the milky way in a simulated data set to within a fewpercent using only 100 stars in a tidal stream.

0706.0004	the accretion origin of the milky way's stellar halo	we have used data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 5 toexplore the overall structure and substructure of the stellar halo of the milkyway using about 4 million color-selected main sequence turn-off stars. we fitoblate and triaxial broken power-law models to the data, and found a `best-fit'oblateness of the stellar halo 0.5&lt;c/a&lt;0.8, and halo stellar masses betweengalactocentric radii of 1 and 40kpc of (3.7+/-1.2)x10^8 m_sun. the densityprofile of the stellar halo is approximately r^{-3}; it is possible that thepower law slope is shallower inside 20kpc and steeper outside that radius. yet,we found that all smooth and symmetric models were very poor fits to thedistribution of stellar halo stars because the data exhibit a great deal ofspatial substructure. we quantified deviations from a smooth oblate/triaxialmodel using the rms of the data around the model profile on scales &gt;~100pc,after accounting for the (known) contribution of poisson uncertainties. thefractional rms deviation of the actual stellar distribution from any smooth,parameterized halo model is &gt;~40%: hence, the stellar halo is highlystructured. we compared the observations with simulations of galactic stellarhalos formed entirely from the accretion of satellites in a cosmologicalcontext by analysing the simulations in the same way as the data. while themasses, overall profiles, and degree of substructure in the simulated stellarhalos show considerable scatter, the properties and degree of substructure inthe milky way's halo match well the properties of a `typical' stellar halobuilt exclusively out of the debris from disrupted satellite galaxies. ourresults therefore point towards a picture in which an important fraction of themilky way's stellar halo has been accreted from satellite galaxies.
