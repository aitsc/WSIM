0901.0031	spectral states of xte j1701-462: link between z and atoll sources	we have analyzed 866 rxte observations of the 2006-2007 outburst of theaccreting neutron star xte j1701-462, during which the source evolves fromsuper-eddington luminosities to quiescence. the x-ray color evolution firstresembles the cyg x-2 subgroup of z sources, with frequent excursions on thehorizontal and normal branches (hb/nb). the source then decays and evolves tothe sco x-1 subgroup, with increasing focus on the flaring branch (fb) and thelower vertex of the "z". finally, the fb subsides, and the source transformsinto an atoll source, with the lower vertex evolving to the atoll soft state.spectral analyses suggest that the atoll stage is characterized by a constantinner disk radius, while the z stages exhibit a luminosity-dependent expansionof the inner disk, which we interpret as effects related to the local eddingtonlimit. contrary to the view that the mass accretion rate ($\dot{m}$) changesalong the z, we find that changes in $\dot{m}$ are instead responsible for thesecular evolution of the z and the subclasses. motion along the z branchesappears to be caused by three different mechanisms that may operate at roughlyconstant $\dot{m}$. for the sco x-1-like z stage, we find that the fb is aninstability track that proceeds off the lower vertex when the inner disk radiusshrinks from the value set by the x-ray luminosity toward the value measuredfor the atoll soft state. excursions up the nb occur when the apparent size ofthe boundary layer increases while the disk exhibits little change. the hb isassociated with comptonization of the disk emission. the z branches for the cygx-2-like stage are more complicated, and their origin is unclear. finally, ourspectral results lead us to hypothesize that the lower and upper z verticescorrespond to a standard thin disk and a slim disk, respectively.

0902.4238	x-ray timing of stellar mass black holes	x-ray timing observations of accreting stellar mass black holes have shownthat they can produce signals with such short time scales that we must beprobing very close to the innermost stable circular orbit that is predicted bythe theory of general relativity (gr). these signals are quasi-periodicoscillations (qpos), and both the high-frequency variety (hfqpos, which havefrequencies in the 40-450 hz range) as well as the 0.1-10 hz low-frequency typehave the potential to provide tests of gr in the strong field limit. animportant step on the path to gr tests is to constrain the physical black holeproperties, and the straightforward frequency measurements that are possiblewith x-ray timing may provide one of the cleanest measurements of black holespins. while current x-ray satellites have uncovered these phenomenona, thehfqpos are weak signals, and future x-ray timing missions with larger effectivearea are required for testing the candidate theoretical qpo mechanisms. anothermain goal in the study of accreting black holes is to understand the productionof relativistic jets. here, we have also made progress during the past decadeby finding clear connections between the radio emission that traces thestrength of the jet and the properties of the x-ray emission. with new radiocapabilities just coming on-line, continuing detailed x-ray studies ofaccreting black holes is crucial for continuing to make progress.

0905.4809	a very rare triple-peaked type-i x-ray burst in the low-mass x-ray  binary 4u 1636-53	we have discovered a triple-peaked x-ray burst from the low-mass x-ray binary(lmxb) 4u 1636-53 with the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte). this is thefirst triple-peaked burst reported from any lmxb using rxte, and it is only thesecond burst of this kind observed from any source. (the previous one was alsofrom 4u 1636-53, and was observed with exosat.) from fits to time-resolvedspectra, we find that this is not a radius-expansion burst, and that the sametriple-peaked pattern seen in the x-ray light curve is also present in thebolometric light curve of the burst. similar to what was previously observed indouble-peaked bursts from this source, the radius of the emitting areaincreases steadily during the burst, with short periods in between during whichthe radius remains more or less constant. the temperature first increasessteeply, and then decreases across the burst also showing three peaks. thefirst and last peak in the temperature profile occur, respectively,significantly before and significantly after the first and last peaks in thex-ray and bolometric light curves. we found no significant oscillations duringthis burst. this triple-peaked burst, as well as the one observed with exosatand the double-peak bursts in this source, all took place when 4u 1636-53occupied a relatively narrow region in the colour-colour diagram, correspondingto a relatively high (inferred) mass-accretion rate. no model presentlyavailable is able to explain the multiple-peaked bursts.

1003.3460	rapid cooling of the neutron star in the quiescent super-eddington  transient xte j1701-462	we present rossi x-ray timing explorer and swift observations made during thefinal three weeks of the 2006-2007 outburst of the super-eddington neutron star(ns) transient xte j1701-462, as well as chandra and xmm-newton observationscovering the first ~800 days of the subsequent quiescent phase. the sourcetransitioned quickly from active accretion to quiescence, with the luminositydropping by over 3 orders of magnitude in ~13 days. the spectra obtained duringquiescence exhibit both a thermal component, presumed to originate in emissionfrom the ns surface, and a non-thermal component of uncertain origin, which hasshown large and irregular variability. we interpret the observed decay of theinferred effective surface temperature of the ns in quiescence as the coolingof the ns crust after having been heated and brought out of thermal equilibriumwith the core during the outburst. the interpretation of the data iscomplicated by an apparent temporary increase in temperature ~220 days intoquiescence, possibly due to an additional spurt of accretion. we derive anexponential decay timescale of ~120 (+30/-20) days for the inferred temperature(excluding observations affected by the temporary increase). this shorttimescale indicates a highly conductive ns crust. further observations areneeded to confirm whether the crust is still slowly cooling or has alreadyreached thermal equilibrium with the core at a surface temperature of ~125 ev.the latter would imply a high equilibrium bolometric thermal luminosity of~5x10^{33} erg/s for an assumed distance of 8.8 kpc.

1005.3210	xte j1701-462 and its implications for the nature of subclasses in  low-magnetic-field neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries	we report on an analysis of rxte data of the transient neutron star low-massx-ray binary (ns-lmxb) xte j1701-462, obtained during its 2006-2007 outburst.the x-ray properties of the source changed between those of various types ofns-lmxb subclasses. at high luminosities the source switched between two typesof z source behavior and at low luminosities we observed a transition from zsource to atoll source behavior. these transitions between subclasses primarilymanifest themselves as changes in the shapes of the tracks in x-ray color-colorand hardness-intensity diagrams, but they are accompanied by changes in the khzquasi-periodic oscillations, broad-band variability, burst behavior, and/orx-ray spectra. we find that the low-energy x-ray flux is a good parameter totrack the gradual evolution of the tracks in color-color and hardness-intensitydiagrams, allowing us to resolve the evolution of the source in greater detailthan before and relate the observed properties to other ns-lmxbs. we furtherfind that during the transition from z to atoll, characteristic behavior knownas the atoll upper banana can equivalently be described as the final stage of aweakening z source flaring branch, thereby blurring the line between the twosubclasses. our findings strongly suggest that the wide variety in behaviorobserved in ns-lxmbs with different luminosities can be linked through changesin a single variable parameter, namely the mass accretion rate, without theneed for additional differences in the neutron star parameters or viewingangle. we briefly discuss the implications of our findings for the spectralchanges observed in ns lmxbs and suggest that, contrary to what is oftenassumed, the position along the color-color tracks of z sources is notdetermined by the instantaneous mass accretion rate.

1006.5168	suzaku and bepposax x-ray spectra of the persistently accreting  neutron-star binary 4u 1705-44	we present an analysis of the broad-band spectra of 4u~1705--44 obtained with{\it suzaku} in 2006--2008 and by {\it bepposax} in 2000. the source exhibitstwo distinct states: the hard state shows emission from 1 to 150 kev, while thesoft state is mostly confined to be $&lt;40$ kev. we model soft-state continuumspectra with two thermal components, one of which is a multicolor accretiondisk and the other is a single-temperature blackbody to describe the boundarylayer, with additional weak comptonization represented by either a simple powerlaw or the simpl model by steiner et al. the hard-state continuum spectra aremodeled by a single-temperature blackbody for the boundary layer plus strongcomptonization, modeled by a cutoff power law. while we are unable to draw firmconclusions about the physical properties of the disk in the hard state, theaccretion disk in the soft state appears to approximately follow $l\proptot^{3.2}$. the deviation from $l\propto t^4$, as expected from a constant innerdisk radius, might be caused by a luminosity-dependent spectral hardeningfactor and/or real changes of the inner disk radius in some part of the softstate. the boundary layer apparent emission area is roughly constant from thehard to the soft states, with a value of about 1/11 of the neutron starsurface. the magnetic field on the surface of the ns in 4u~1705--44 isestimated to be less than about $1.9\times 10^8$ g, assuming that the disk istruncated by the isco or by the neutron star surface. broad relativistic felines are detected in most spectra and are modeled with the diskline model. thestrength of the fe lines is found to correlate well with the boundary layeremission in the soft state. in the hard state, the fe lines are probably due toillumination of the accretion disk by the strong comptonization emission.

0708.3615	relativistic iron emission lines in neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries  as probes of neutron star radii	using suzaku observations of three neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries (serx-1, 4u 1820-30 and gx 349+2) we have found broad, asymmetric, relativistic fek emission lines in all three objects. these fe k lines can be well fit by amodel for lines from a relativistic accretion disk ('diskline'), allowing ameasurement of the inner radius of the accretion disk, and hence an upper limiton the neutron star radius. these upper limits correspond to 14.5 - 16.5 km fora 1.4 m(solar) neutron star. the inner disk radii we measure with fe k linesare in good agreement with the inner disk radii implied by khz qpos observed inboth 4u 1820-30 and gx 349+2, supporting the inner disk nature of khz qpos.additionally, the fe k lines observed in these neutron stars are narrower thanthose in the black holes that are thought to be close to maximally spinning, asone would expect if inferences for spin are robust.

1101.0081	the variable quiescent x-ray emission of the neutron star transient xte  j1701-462	we present the results of continued monitoring of the quiescent neutron starlow-mass x-ray binary xte j1701-462 with chandra and swift. a new chandraobservation from 2010 october extends our tracking of the neutron star surfacetemperature from ~800 days to ~1160 days since the end of an exceptionallyluminous 19 month outburst. this observation indicates that the neutron starcrust may still be slowly cooling toward thermal equilibrium with the core;another observation further into quiescence is needed to verify this. the shapeof the overall cooling curve is consistent with that of a broken power law,although an exponential decay to a constant level cannot be excluded with thepresent data. to investigate possible low-level activity, we conducted amonitoring campaign of xte j1701-462 with swift during 2010 april-october.short-term flares - presumably arising from episodic low-level accretion - wereobserved up to a luminosity of ~1e35 erg/s, ~20 times higher than the normalquiescent level. we conclude that flares of this magnitude are not likely tohave significantly affected the equilibrium temperature of the neutron star andare probably not able to have a measurable impact on the cooling curve.however, it is possible that brighter and longer periods of low-level activityhave had an appreciable effect on the equilibrium temperature.

1202.6053	a hybrid magnetically/thermally-driven wind in the black hole gro  j1655-40?	during its 2005 outburst, gro j1655-40 was observed twice with the chandrahigh energy transmission grating spectrometer; the second observation revealeda spectrum rich with ionized absorption lines from elements ranging from o toni (miller et al. 2006a, 2008; kallman et al. 2009), indicative of an outflowtoo dense and too ionized to be driven by radiation or thermal pressure. todate, this spectrum is the only definitive evidence of an ionized wind drivenoff the accretion disk by magnetic processes in a black hole x-ray binary. herewe present our detailed spectral analysis of the first chandra observation,nearly three weeks earlier, in which the only signature of the wind is the fexxvi absorption line. comparing the broadband x-ray spectra via photoionizationmodels, we argue that the differences in the chandra spectra cannot possibly beexplained by the changes in the ionizing spectrum, which implies that theproperties of the wind cannot be constant throughout the outburst. we explorephysical scenarios for the changes in the wind, which we suggest may begin as ahybrid mhd/thermal wind, but evolves over the course of weeks into two distinctoutflows with different properties. we discuss the implications of our resultsfor the links between the state of the accretion flow and the presence oftransient disk winds.

1204.3486	coherent oscillations and the evolution of the emission area in the  decaying phase of radius-expansion bursts from 4u 1636-53	we analysed all archival data of the low-mass x-ray binary 4u 1636--53 withthe rossi x-ray timing explorer (1490 observations). we found a total of 336type-i x-ray bursts from this source. in the time-resolved spectra of 69 ofthese bursts, close to the peak of the burst, the best-fitting blackbody radiusshows the sharp increase and decrease that is typical of photosphericradius-expansion (pre) bursts. we found that in 17 of these 69 pre bursts,after the touchdown point, the blackbody radius increases again quickly afterabout 1 second, and from then on the radius decreases slightly or it remainsmore or less constant. in the other 52 pre bursts, after touchdown, the radiusof the blackbody stays more or less constant for $\sim 2 - 8$ seconds, andafter that it increases slowly. interestingly, those pre bursts in which theblackbody radius remains more or less constant for $\simmore 2$ seconds showcoherent oscillations in the tail of the burst, whereas those pre bursts inwhich the blackbody radius changes rapidly after touchdown show no coherentoscillations in the tail of the burst. we found that the distribution ofdurations of the post touchdown phase between these two groups of pre bursts issignificantly different; the kolmogorov-smirnov probability that the two groupsof pre bursts come from the same parent populations is only $3.5 \times10^{-7}$. this is the first time that the presence of burst oscillations in thetail of x-ray bursts is associated with a systematic behaviour of the spectralparameters in that phase of the bursts. this result is consistent withpredictions of models that associate the oscillations in the tail of x-raybursts with the propagation of a cooling wake in the material on theneutron-star surface during the decay of the bursts.

1207.1107	the spectral evolution along the z track of the bright neutron star  x-ray binary gx 17+2	z sources are bright neutron-star x-ray binaries, accreting at around theeddington limit. we analyze the 68 rxte observations (270 ks) of sco-like zsource gx 17+2 made between 1999 october 3-12, covering a complete z track. wecreate and fit color-resolved spectra with a model consisting of a thermalmulticolor disk, a single-temperature-blackbody boundary layer and a weakcomptonized component. we find that, similar to what was observed for xtej1701-462 in its sco-like z phase, the branches of gx 17+2 can be explained bythree processes operating at a constant accretion rate mdot into the disk:increase of comptonization up the horizontal branch, transition from a standardthin disk to a slim disk up the normal branch, and temporary fast decrease ofthe inner disk radius up the flaring branch. we also model the comptonizationin an empirically self-consistent way, with its seed photons tied to thethermal disk component and corrected for to recover the pre-comptonized thermaldisk emission. this allows us to show a constant mdot along the entire z trackbased on the thermal disk component. we also measure the upper khz qpofrequency and find it to depend on the apparent inner disk radius r_in (priorto compton scattering) approximately as frequency \propto r_in^(-3/2),supporting the idenfitication of it as the keplerian frequency at r_in. thehorizontal branch oscillation is probably related to the dynamics in the innerdisk as well, as both its frequency and r_in vary significantly on thehorizontal branch but become relatively constant on the normal branch.

1308.2580	the x-ray properties of the black hole transient maxi j1659-152 in  quiescence	we present new chandra x-ray observations of the transient black hole x-raybinary maxi j1659-152 in quiescence. these observations were made more than oneyear after the end of the source's 2010-2011 outburst. we detect the source ata 0.5-10 kev flux of 2.8(8)e-15 erg/cm^2/s, which corresponds to a luminosityof ~1.2e31 (d/ 6 kpc)^2 erg/s. this level, while being the lowest at which thesource has been detected, is within factors of ~2 of the levels seen at the endof the initial decay of the outburst and soon after a major reflare of thesource. the quiescent luminosity of maxi j1659-152, which is theshortest-orbital-period black hole x-ray binary (~2.4 hr), is lower than thatof neutron-star x-ray binaries with similar periods. however, it is higher thanthe quiescent luminosities found for black hole x-ray binaries with orbitalperiods ~2-4 times longer. this could imply that a minimum quiescent luminositymay exist for black hole x-ray binaries, around orbital periods of ~5-10 hr, aspredicted by binary-evolution models for the mass transfer rate. compared tothe hard state we see a clear softening of the power-law spectrum inquiescence, from an index of 1.55(4) to an index of 2.5(4). we constrain theluminosity range in which this softening starts to fractional eddingtonluminosities of (0.18-6.2)e-5 (d/ 6 kpc)^2 (m/ 8 msun), which is consistentwith the ranges inferred for other sources.

1310.7937	the neutron star transient and millisecond pulsar in m28: from  sub-luminous accretion to rotation-powered quiescence	the x-ray transient igr j18245-2452 in the globular cluster m28 contains thefirst neutron star (ns) seen to switch between rotation-powered andaccretion-powered pulsations. we analyse its 2013 march-april 25d-long outburstas observed by swift, which had a peak bolometric luminosity of ~6% of theeddington limit (l$_{e}$), and give detailed properties of the thermonuclearburst observed on 2013 april 7. we also present a detailed analysis of new andarchival chandra data, which we use to study quiescent emission from igrj18245-2452 between 2002 and 2013. together, these observations cover almostfive orders of magnitude in x-ray luminosity (l$_x$, 0.5-10 kev). the swiftspectrum softens during the outburst decay (photon index $\gamma$ from 1.3above l$_x$/l$_{e}$=10$^{-2}$ to ~2.5 at l$_x$/l$_{e}$=10$^{-4}$), similar toother ns and black hole (bh) transients. at even lower luminosities, deepchandra observations reveal hard ($\gamma$=1-1.5), purely non-thermal andhighly variable x-ray emission in quiescence. we therefore find evidence for aspectral transition at l$_x$/l$_{e}$~10$^{-4}$, where the x-ray spectralsoftening observed during the outburst decline turns into hardening as thesource goes to quiescence. furthermore, we find a striking variability patternin the 2008 chandra light curves: rapid switches between a high-l$_x$ "active"state (l$_x\simeq$3.9x10$^{33}$ erg/s) and a low-l$_x$ "passive" state(l$_x\simeq$5.6x10$^{32}$ erg/s), with no detectable spectral change. we putour results in the context of low luminosity accretion flows around compactobjects and x-ray emission from millisecond radio pulsars. finally, we discusspossible origins for the observed mode switches in quiescence, and explore ascenario where they are caused by fast transitions between the magnetosphericaccretion and pulsar wind shock emission regimes.

1411.2973	constraints on relativistic jets in quiescent black hole x-ray binaries  from broadband spectral modeling	the nature of black hole jets at the lowest detectable luminosities remainsan open question, largely due to a dearth of observational constraints. here,we present a new, nearly-simultaneous broadband spectrum of the black holex-ray binary (bhxb) xte j1118+480 at an extremely low eddington ratio(l_x~1e-8.5 l_edd). our new spectral energy distribution (sed) includes theradio, near-infrared, optical, ultraviolet, and x-ray wavebands. xte j1118 isnow the second bhxb at such a low eddington ratio with a well-sampled sed,providing new constraints on highly sub-eddington accretion flows and jets, andopening the door for comparison studies. we apply a multi-zone jet model to thenew broadband sed, and we compare our results to previous fits to the samesource using the same model at 4-5 decades higher luminosity. we find thatafter a bhxb transitions to the so-called quiescent spectral state, the jetbase becomes more compact (by up to an order of magnitude) and slightly cooler(by at least a factor of two). our preferred model fit indicates that jetparticle acceleration is weaker after the transition into quiescence. that is,accelerated non-thermal particles no longer reach high enough lorentz factorsto contribute significant amounts of synchrotron x-ray emission. instead, thex-ray waveband is dominated by synchrotron self-compton emission from apopulation of mildly relativistic electrons with a quasi-thermal velocitydistribution associated with the jet base. the corresponding (thermal)synchrotron component emits primarily in the infrared through ultravioletwavebands. our results on xte j1118 are consistent with broadband modeling fora0620-00 and for sgr a*. the above could therefore represent a canonicalbaseline geometry for accreting black holes in quiescence. we conclude withsuggestions for future studies to further investigate the above scenario.

1501.02238	spectral softening between outburst and quiescence in the neutron star  low-mass x-ray binary sax j1750.8-2900	tracking the spectral evolution of transiently accreting neutron starsbetween outburst and quiescence probes relatively poorly understood accretionregimes. such studies are challenging because they require frequent monitoringof sources with luminosities below the thresholds of current all-sky x-raymonitors. we present the analysis of over 30 observations of the neutron starlow-mass x-ray binary sax j1750.8-2900 taken across four years with the x-raytelescope aboard swift. we find spectral softening with decreasing luminosityboth on long ($\sim$1 year) and short ($\sim$days to week) timescales. as theluminosity decreases from $4\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $ \sim1\times10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (0.5-10 kev), the power law photon index increases from from 1.4to 2.9. although not statistically required, our spectral fits allow anadditional soft component that displays a decreasing temperature as theluminosity decreases from $4 \times 10^{36} $ to $6 \times 10^{34}$ ergs$^{-1}$. spectral softening exhibited by sax j1750.8-2900 is consistent bothwith accretion emission whose spectral shape steepens with decreasingluminosity and also with being dominated by a changing soft component, possiblyassociated with accretion onto the neutron star surface, as the luminositydeclines.

1504.00022	common patterns in the evolution between the luminous neutron star  low-mass x-ray binary subclasses	the x-ray transient xte j1701-462 was the first source observed to evolvethrough all known subclasses of low-magnetic-field neutron star low-mass x-raybinaries (ns-lmxbs), as a result of large changes in its mass accretion rate.to investigate to what extent similar evolution is seen in other ns-lmxbs wehave performed a detailed study of the color-color and hardness-intensitydiagrams (cds and hids) of cyg x-2, cir x-1, and gx 13+1 -- three luminousx-ray binaries, containing weakly magnetized neutron stars, known to exhibitstrong secular changes in their cd/hid tracks. using the full set of rossix-ray timing explorer proportional counter array data collected for the sourcesover the 16 year duration of the mission, we show that cyg x-2 and cir x-1display cd/hid evolution with close similarities to xte j1701-462. although gx13+1 shows behavior that is in some ways unique, it also exhibits similaritiesto xte j1701-462, and we conclude that its overall cd/hid properties stronglyindicate that it should be classified as a z source, rather than as an atollsource. we conjecture that the secular evolution of cyg x-2, cir x-1, and gx13+1 -- illustrated by sequences of cd/hid tracks we construct -- arises fromchanges in the mass accretion rate. our results strengthen previous suggestionsthat within single sources cyg-like z source behavior takes place at higherluminosities and mass accretion rates than sco-like z behavior, and lendsupport to the notion that the mass accretion rate is the primary physicalparameter distinguishing the various ns-lmxb subclasses.

1506.05447	the megasecond chandra x-ray visionary project observation of ngc 3115  (iii): luminosity functions of lmxbs and dependence on stellar environments	we have studied the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) of low-mass x-raybinaries (lmxbs) in the nearby lenticular galaxy ngc 3115, using the megasecondchandra x-ray visionary project observation. with a total exposure time of ~1.1ms, we constructed the xlf down to a limiting luminosity of ~10^36 erg/s, muchdeeper than typically reached for other early-type galaxies. we foundsignificant flattening of the overall lmxb xlf from dn/dl \proptol^{-2.2\pm0.4} above 5.5x10^37 erg/s to dn/dl \propto l^{-1.0\pm0.1} below it,though we could not rule out a fit with a higher break at ~1.6x10^38 erg/s. wealso found evidence that the xlf of lmxbs in globular clusters (gcs) is overallflatter than that of field lmxbs. thus our results for this galaxy do notsupport the idea that all lmxbs are formed in gcs. the xlf of field lmxbs seemsto show spatial variation, with the xlf in the inner region of the galaxy beingflatter than that in the outer region, probably due to contamination of lmxbsfrom undetected and/or disrupted gcs in the inner region. the xlf in the outerregion is probably the xlf of primordial field lmxbs, exhibiting dn/dl \proptol^{-1.2\pm0.1} up to a break close to the eddington limit of neutron star lmxbs(~1.7x10^38 erg/s). the break of the gc lmxb xlf is lower, at ~1.1x10^37 erg/s.we also confirm previous findings that the metal-rich/red gcs are more likelyto host lmxbs than the metal-poor/blue gcs, which is more significant for moreluminous lmxbs, and that more massive gcs are more likely to host lmxbs.

1508.02761	on the geometric nature of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in  neutron-star low-mass x-ray binaries	we report on a detailed analysis of the so-called ~1 hz quasi-periodicoscillation (qpo) in the eclipsing and dipping neutron-star low-mass x-raybinary exo 0748-676. this type of qpo has previously been shown to have ageometric origin. our study focuses on the evolution of the qpo as the sourcemoves through the color-color diagram, in which it traces out anatoll-source-like track. the qpo frequency increases from ~0.4 hz in the hardstate to ~25 hz as the source approaches the soft state. combining powerspectra based on qpo frequency reveals additional features that stronglyresemble those seen in non-dipping/eclipsing atoll sources. we show that thelow-frequency qpos in atoll sources and the ~1 hz qpo in exo 0748-676 followsimilar relations with respect to the noise components in their power spectra.we conclude that the frequencies of both types of qpos are likely set by (thesame) precession of a misaligned inner accretion disk. for high-inclinationsystems, like exo 0748-676, this results in modulations of the neutron-staremission due to obscuration or scattering, while for lower-inclination systemsthe modulations likely arise from relativistic doppler boosting andlight-bending effects.

0806.4796	luminosity dependence of the electron temperature in the bright hard  state of the black hole candidate gx 339--4	we have analyzed 200 rossi x-ray timing explorer observations of the blackhole candidate gx 339--4, all from the bright hard state periods between 1996and 2005. purpose of our study is to investigate the radiation mechanisms inthe hard state of gx 339--4. the broadband 3--200 kev spectra were successfullymodeled by a simple analytic model, power--law with an exponential cut-offmodified with a smeared edge. the obtained energy cut-off ($e_{\rm{cut}}$) wasdistributed over 50--200 kev, and the photon index over 1.4--1.7. we found aclear anti-correlation ($e_{\rm{cut}} \propto l^{-0.70\pm0.06}$) between thex-ray luminosity ($l$) in 2--200 kev and $e_{\rm{cut}}$, when $l$ is largerthan $7 \times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (assuming a distance of 8 kpc), while$e_{\rm{cut}}$ is roughly constant at around 200 kev when $l$ is smaller than$7 \times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. this anti-correlation remained unchanged byadopting a more physical thermal comptonization model, which resulted in theanti-correlation that can be expressed as $kt_{\rm{e}} \proptol^{-0.24\pm0.06}$. these anti-correlations can be quantitatively explained by apicture in which the energy-flow rate from protons to electrons balances withthe inverse compton cooling.

astro-ph;0001163	correlated x-ray spectral and timing behavior of the black hole  candidate xte j1550-564: a new interpretation of black hole states	we present an analysis of rxte data of the x-ray transient xte j1550-564. thesource went through several states, which were divided into spectrally soft andhard states. these states showed up as distinct branches in the color-colordiagram, forming a structure with a comb-like topology; the soft state branchforming the spine and the hard state branches forming the teeth. variabilitywas strongly correlated with the position on the branches. the broad band noisebecame stronger, and changed from power law like to band limited, as thespectrum became harder. three types of qpos were found: 1-18 hz and 102-284 hzqpos on the hard branches, and 16-18 hz qpos on and near the soft branch. thefrequencies of the high and low frequency qpos on the hard branches werecorrelated with each other, and anti-correlated with spectral hardness. thechanges in qpo frequency suggest that the inner disc radius only increases by afactor of 3-4 as the source changes from a soft to a hard state. our results onxte j1550-564 strongly favor a 2-dimensional description of black holebehavior, where the regions near the spine of the comb in the color-colordiagram can be identified with the high state, and the teeth with transitionsfrom the high state, via the intermediate state (which includes the very highstate) to the low state, and back. the two physical parameters underlying thisbehavior vary to a large extent independently and could for example be the massaccretion rate through the disk and the size of a comptonizing region.

astro-ph;0002074	simultaneous measurements of x-ray luminosity and kilohertz  quasi-periodic oscillations in low-mass x-ray binaries	we measure simultaneously the properties of the energy spectra and thefrequencies of the kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) in fifteen lowmass x-ray binaries covering a wide range of x-ray luminosities. in each sourcethe qpo frequencies cover the same range of approximately 300 hz to 1300 hz,though the sources differ by two orders of magnitude in their x-rayluminosities (as measured from the unabsorbed 2-50 kev flux). so the x-rayluminosity does not uniquely determine the qpo frequency. this is difficult tounderstand since the evidence from individual sources indicates that thefrequency and luminosity are very well correlated at least over shorttimescales. perhaps beaming effects or bolometric corrections change theobserved luminosities, or perhaps part of the energy in mass accretion is usedto power outflows reducing the energy emitted in x-rays. it is also possiblethat the parameters of a qpo model are tuned in such a way that the same rangeof frequencies appears in all sources. different modes of accretion may beinvolved for example (disk and radial) or multiple parameters may conspire toyield the same frequencies.

astro-ph;0406057	chandra observations of the accretion-driven millisecond x-ray pulsars  xte j0929-314 and xte j1751-305 in quiescence	(abridge) we observed the accreting millisecond x-ray pulsars xte j0929-314and xte j1751-305 in their quiescent states using chandra. from xte j0929-314we detected 22 photons (0.3-8 kev) in 24.4 ksec, resulting in a count rate of 9x 10^{-4} c/s. the small number of photons detected did not allow for adetailed spectral analysis, but we can demonstrate that the spectrum is harderthan simple thermal emission which is what is usually presumed to arise from acooling neutron star that has been heated during the outbursts. assuming apower-law model for the spectrum, we obtain a power-law index of ~1.8 and anunabsorbed flux of 6 x 10^{-15} ergs/s/cm^2 (0.5-10 kev), resulting in aluminosity of 7 x 10^{31} (d/10 kpc)^2 ergs/s, with d in kpc. no thermalcomponent could be detected; such a component contributed at most 30% to the0.5-10 kev flux. variability in the count rate of xte j0929-314 was observed atthe 95% confidence level. we did not conclusively detect xte j1751-305 in our43 ksec observation, with 0.5-10 kev flux upper limits between 0.2 and 2.7 x10^{-14} ergs/s/cm^2 depending on assumed spectral shape, resulting inluminosity upper limits of 0.2 - 2 x 10^{32} (d/8 kpc)^2 ergs/s. we compare ourresults with those obtained for other neutron-star x-ray transients in theirquiescent state. using simple accretion disk physics in combination with ourmeasured quiescent luminosity of xte j0929-314 and the luminosity upper limitsof xte j1751-305, and the known spin frequency of the neutron stars, we couldconstrain the magnetic field of the neutron stars in xte j0929-314 and xtej1751-305 to be less than 3 x 10^9 (d/10 kpc) and 3 - 7 x 10^8 (d/8 kpc) gauss(depending on assumed spectral shape of the quiescent spectrum), respectively.

astro-ph;0501186	the distribution of khz qpo frequencies in bright lmxbs	we analyzed all published frequencies, nu_1 and nu_2, of the twin kilohertzquasi-periodic oscillations (khz qpos) in bright neutron star low-mass x-raybinaries. the two frequencies are well correlated but, contrary to recentsuggestions, the frequency-frequency correlation is significantly differentfrom a nu_2 = (3/2) nu_1 relation. to check whether, although not following thethe 3/2 relation, the qpo frequencies cluster around a region where nu_2/nu_1 ~3/2, we re-analyzed the sco x-1 data that were used to report that ratio andshow that, because the distribution of ratios of linearly correlatedmeasurements is intrinsically biased, although the significance of theclustering around nu_2/nu_1 ~ 3/2 previously reported in the case of sco x-1 isformally correct, it does not provide any useful information about a possibleunderlying resonance mechanism in this source. using the same data, we thenshow that the (unbiased) distribution of qpo frequencies is consistent with auniform distribution at a 2.4 sigma level. to investigate this further, weanalyzed a larger data set of sco x-1 and four other sources, 4u 1608-52, 4u1636-53, 4u 1728-34 and 4u 1820-30. we find that for all five sources thedistribution of the khz qpo frequencies is not uniform and has multiple peaks,which have no analogy in the distribution of points in the spectral color-colordiagrams of these sources. finally, we demonstrate that a simple random walk ofthe qpo frequencies can reproduce qualitatively the observed distributions infrequency and frequency ratio. this result weakens the support for resonancemodels of khz qpos in neutron stars.

astro-ph;0501349	multi-wavelength observations of the 2002 outburst of gx 339-4: two  patterns of x-ray-optical/near-infrared behavior	(abridged) we report on rxte and optical/near-infrared (nir) observations ofthe black hole transient gx 339-4, made over a time span of 8 months in 2002and covering the initial rise and transition from a hard to a soft spectralstate. two patterns of correlated x-ray-optical/nir behavior were found. duringthe hard state the optical/nir and x-ray fluxes correlated well, with a nir vs.x-ray flux relation similar to the relation between x-ray and radio fluxesfound in previous studies of gx 339-4 and other black hole binaries. as gx339-4 went through an intermediate state the optical/nir fluxes decreasedrapidly and once it had entered the spectrally soft state, the optical/nirspectrum was much bluer and the ratio of x-ray to nir flux was higher by afactor of more than 10 compared to the hard state. in the spectrally soft statenir-changes preceded those in the x-rays by more than 2 weeks, indicating adisk origin of the nir. we present seds, including radio data, and discusspossible sources for the optical/nir emission. we conclude that in the hardstate this emission probably originates in the optically thin part of a jet andthat in none of the x-ray states x-ray reprocessing is the dominant source ofoptical/nir emission. finally, comparing the light curves from the asm and pcainstruments, we find that the x-ray/nir delay depends critically on thesensitivity of the x-ray detector, with the delay inferred from the pca (ifpresent at all) being a factor of 3-6 times shorter than the delay inferredfrom the asm; this may be important in interpreting previously reportedx-ray-optical/nir lags.

astro-ph;0504182	iron-line and continuum flux variations in the rxte spectra of the  black-hole candidate xte j1650-500	we present the results of spectral fits made to 57 pointed observations ofthe galactic black hole candidate and x-ray transient xte j1650-500, made withthe rossi x-ray timing explorer in 2001 when the source was in a transitionfrom the hard state to the soft state. a strong and variable fe k-alphaemission line is detected in these spectra. the line flux varies in anon-linear way with the hard x-ray flux, in apparent contradiction to thepredictions of simple disc reflection models. we observe a change in theoverall trend that coincides with changes in t he continuum x-ray spectrum andthe fast x-ray variability. the fe-line flux versus hard x-ray flux variationsare consistent with the predictions of reflection models which consider highdisc-ionization states and with a model which considers gravitationallight-bending effects. indications for an anti-correlation between the fe-lineflux and the hard x-ray flux in the spectrally hardest observations and weakvariations in the fe-line energy (as observed with xmm-newton and bepposax)slightly favour the light-bending interpretation.

astro-ph;0512595	a precessing ring model for low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations	we develop a simple physical model to describe the most common type oflow-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) seen in a number of accretingblack hole systems, as well as the shape of the relativistically broadened ironemission lines that often appear simultaneously in such sources. the model isbased on an inclined ring of hot gas that orbits the black hole along geodesictrajectories. for spinning black holes, this ring will precess around the spinaxis of the black hole at the lense-thirring (``frame-dragging'') frequency.using a relativistic ray-tracing code, we calculate x-ray light curves andobserved energy spectra as a function of the radius and tilt angle of the ring,the spin magnitude, and the inclination of the black hole. the model predictshigher-amplitude qpos for systems with high inclinations, as seen in a growingnumber of black hole binary systems. we find that the rossi x-ray timingexplorer observations of low-frequency qpos in grs 1915+105 are consistent witha ring of radius r ~ 10m orbiting a black hole with spin a/m ~0.5 andinclination angle of i ~ 70 deg. finally, we describe how future x-ray missionsmay be able to use simultaneous timing and spectroscopic observations tomeasure the black hole spin and probe the inner-most regions of the accretiondisk.

astro-ph;0610803	rxte observations of the first transient z source xte j1701-462:  shedding new light on mass accretion in luminous neutron star lmxbs	(abridged) we report on ten weeks of rxte observations of the x-ray transientxte j1701-462. comparisons with other sources suggest it had all thecharacteristics of the neutron star z sources (the brightest persistent neutronstar lmxbs). these include z tracks in x-ray color diagrams and typicalvariability components detected in the power spectra. xte j1701-462 is thefirst transient z source and provides unique insights into mass accretion rate(mdot) and luminosity dependencies in neutron star lmxbs. as its overallluminosity decreased, we observed a switch between two types of z-sourcebehavior, with most of the branches of the z-track changing their shape and/ororientation. we interpret this switch as an extreme case of the longtermchanges seen in the persistent z sources and suggest that these result fromchanges in mdot. we also suggest that the cyg-like z sources (cyg x-2, gx 5-1,and gx 340+0) might be more luminous (&gt; 50%) than the sco-like z sources (scox-1, gx 17+2, and gx 349+2). adopting a possible explanation for the behaviorof khz qpos, which involves a prompt as well as a filtered response to changesin mdot, we propose that changes in mdot can explain both movement along the ztrack and changes in the shape of the z track. we discuss some consequences ofthis and consider the possibility that the branches of the z will evolve intothe branches observed in the x-ray color diagrams of the less luminous atollsources, but not in a way that was previously suggested.

0809.3005	disk dominated states of 4u 1957+11: chandra, xmm, and rxte observations  of ostensibly the most rapidly spinning galactic black hole	we present simultaneous chandra-hetg and rxte observations of a moderate flux`soft state' of the black hole candidate 4u1957+11. these spectra, having aminimally discernible hard x-ray excess, are an excellent test of modern diskatmosphere models that include the effects of black hole spin. the hetg datashow that the soft disk spectrum is only very mildly absorbed with n_h =1-2 x10^{21} cm^-2. these data additionally reveal 13.449 a neix absorptionconsistent with the warm/hot phase of the interstellar medium. the fitted diskmodel implies a highly inclined disk around a low mass black hole rapidlyrotating with normalized spin a*~1. we show, however, that pure schwarzschildblack hole models describe the data extremely well, albeit with large diskatmosphere ``color-correction'' factors. standard color-correction factors canbe attained if one additionally incorporates mild comptonization. we find thatthe chandra observations do not uniquely determine spin. similarly, xmm/rxteobservations, taken only six weeks later, are equally unconstraining. this lackof constraint is partly driven by the unknown mass and unknown distance of4u1957+11; however, it is also driven by the limited bandpass of chandra andxmm. we therefore present a series of 48 rxte observations taken over the spanof several years and at different brightness/hardness levels. these data prefera spin of a*~1, even when including a mild comptonization component; however,they also show evolution of the disk atmosphere color-correction factors. ifthe rapid spin models with standard atmosphere color-correction factors ofh_d=1.7 are to be believed, then the rxte observations predict that 4u1957+11can range from a 3 m_sun black hole at 10 kpc with a*~0.83 to a 16 m_sun blackhole at 22 kpc with a* ~ 1, with the latter being statistically preferred.

astro-ph;9903105	on the magnetospheric beat-frequency and lense-thirring interpretations  of the horizontal branch oscillation in the z sources	we study the horizontal branch oscillations (hbo) and the two simultaneouskilohertz qpos comparing their properties in five z sources with thepredictions of the magnetospheric beat-frequency and lense-thirring precessionmodels. we find that the variation of the hbo frequency with accretion ratepredicted by the magnetospheric beat-frequency model for a purely dipolarstellar magnetic field and a radiation-pressure-dominated inner accretion diskagrees well with the observed variation. this model implies that the neutronstars in the z sources are near magnetic spin equilibrium, that their magneticfield strengths are ~10^9-10^10 g, and that the critical fastness parameter forthese sources is &gt;0.8. if the frequency of the upper kilohertz qpo is anorbital frequency in the accretion disk, the magnetospheric beat-frequencymodel requires that a small fraction of the gas in the disk does not couplestrongly to the stellar magnetic field at 3-4 stellar radii but instead driftsslowly inward in nearly circular orbits until it is within a few kilometers ofthe neutron star surface. the lense-thirring precession model is consistentwith the observed magnitudes of the hbo frequencies only if the moments ofinertia of the neutron stars in the z sources are 4-5 times larger than thelargest values predicted by realistic neutron-star equations of state. thetrend of the correlation between the hbo and upper khz qpo frequencies is notconsistent with this model. we argue that the change in the slope of thecorrelation between the frequency of the horizontal branch oscillation and thefrequency of the upper kilohertz qpo, when the latter is greater than 850 hz,is directly related to the varying frequency separation of the kilohertz qpos.

(1999) in 4u 1323-62. although the exactmechanism is not clear, it is most likely related to the high inclination ofboth systems. an orbiting structure in the accretion disc that modulates theradiation from the central source seems the most promising mechanism.

astro-ph;9909515	the complex phase lag behavior of the 3-12 hz quasi-periodic  oscillations during the very high state of xte j1550-564	we present a study of the complex phase lag behavior of the low-frequency(&lt;20 hz) quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) in the x-ray transient andblack-hole candidate xte j1550-564 during its very high state. we distinguishtwo different types of low-frequency qpos, based on their coherence andharmonic content. the first type is characterized by a 6 hz qpo with a q (theqpo frequency divided by the qpo width) of &lt;3 and with a harmonic at 12 hz. thesecond type of qpo is characterized by a 6 hz qpo with a q value of &gt;6 and withharmonics at 3, 12, 18, and possibly at 9 hz. not only the q values and theharmonic content of the two types are different, but also their phase lagbehavior. for the first type of qpo, the low energy photons (&lt;5 kev) of boththe 6 hz qpo and its harmonic at 12 hz lag the hard energy photons (&gt;5 kev) byas much as 1.3 radian. the phase lags of the second type of qpo are morecomplex. the soft photons (&lt;5 kev) of the 3 and the 12 hz qpos lag the hardphotons (&gt;5 kev) by as much as 1.0 radian. however, the soft photons of the 6hz qpo precede the hard ones by as much as 0.6 radian. this means thatdifferent harmonics of this type of qpo have different signs for their phaselags. this unusual behavior is hard to explain when the lags are due tolight-travel-time differences between the photons at different energies, e.g.,in a comptonizing region surrounding the area where the qpos are formed.

astro-ph;9910159	discovery of a ~1 hz quasi-periodic oscillation in the low-mass x-ray  binary 4u 1746-37	we have discovered a ~1 hz quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) in the persistentx-ray emission and during type i x-ray bursts of the globular cluster source,dipper and low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb) 4u 1746-37. the qpo properties resemblethose of qpos found recently in the lmxb dippers 4u 1323-62, and exo 0748-676,which makes 4u 1746-37 the third source known to exhibit this type of qpos. wepresent evidence for x-ray spectral changes in this source similar to thoseobserved in lmxbs referred to as atoll sources. we detect two states, a lowintensity and spectrally hard state, and a higher intensity and spectrally softstate. this may explain the different spectral characteristics reported for 4u1746-37 earlier. the high intensity state resembles the banana branch state ofatoll sources. the qpos are only seen in the low intensity state, and areabsent when the source is in the banana branch. this strongly suggests thateither the accretion disk or an extended central source change shape betweenthe low intensity state and the banana branch. twelve bursts were detected, ofwhich 5 took place while the source was on the banana branch and 7 when thesource was in the low intensity state. the bursts occurring on the bananabranch had an e-folding time ~3 times longer than those which occurred in thelow intensity state. whereas previously detected dips showed only a decrease incount rate of ~15%, we found in one observation a dip in which the count ratedropped from ~200 counts per second to ~20 counts per second. this dip lastedonly ~250 seconds, during which clear spectral hardening occured. this is thefirst time strong evidence for spectral changes during a dip are reported forthis source.
