0901.2898	the fraction of quiescent massive galaxies in the early universe	aims: the aim of this work is to collect a complete, mass--selected sample ofgalaxies with very low specific star formation rate, for a comparison with theprediction of recent theoretical models. method: we use the 24/k flux ratio,complemented by the sed fitting to the full 0.35-8.0 mum spectral distribution,to select quiescent galaxies from z~0.4 to z~4 in the goods--music sample. ourobservational selection can be translated into thresholds on the specific starformation rate sfr/m_*, that can be used to compare with the theoreticalpredictions. results: we find that, in the framework of the well known globaldecline of the quiescent fraction with redshift, a non-negligible fraction~15-20% of massive galaxies with very low specific star formation rate existsup to z~4, including a tail of "red&amp;dead" galaxies with sfr/m_*&lt;10^{-11}/yr.recent theoretical models vary to a large extent in the prediction of thefraction of galaxies with very low specific star formation rates, and areunable to provide a global match to our data.

0903.3952	a comprehensive study of large scale structures in the goods-south field  up to z \sim 2.5	the aim of this paper is to identify and study the properties and galacticcontent of groups and clusters in the goods-south field up to z\sim2.5, and toanalyse the physical properties of galaxies as a continuous function ofenvironmental density up to high redshift. we use the deep (z850\sim26),multi-wavelength goods-music catalogue, which has a 15% of spectroscopicredshifts and accurate photometric redshifts for the remaining fraction. onthese data, we apply a (2+1)d algorithm, previously developed by our group,that provides an adaptive estimate of the 3d density field. we support ouranalysis with simulations to evaluate the purity and the completeness of thecluster catalogue produced by our algorithm. we find several high density peaksembedded in larger structures in the redshift range 0.4-2.5. from the analysisof their physical properties (mass profile, m200, \sigmav, lx, u-b vs. bdiagram), we derive that most of them are groups of galaxies, while two arepoor clusters with masses of few times 10^14 mo. for these two clusters wefind, from the chandra 2ms data, an x-ray emission significantly lower thanexpected from their optical properties, suggesting that the two clusters areeither not virialised or gas poor. we also analyse the dependance onenvironment of galaxy colours, luminosities, stellar masses, ages and starformations. we find that galaxies in high density regions are, on average, moreluminous and massive than field galaxies up to z\sim 2. the fraction of redgalaxies increases with luminosity and with density up to z\sim 1.2. at higherz this dependance on density disappears. the variation of galaxy properties asa function of redshift and density suggests that a significant change occurs atz\sim 1.5-2.

0905.0683	star formation and mass assembly in high redshift galaxies	we study the star formation and the mass assembly process of 0.3&lt;=z&lt;2.5galaxies using their ir emission from mips 24um band. we used an updatedversion of the goods-music catalog, extended by the addition of mid-ir fluxes.we compared two different estimators of the star formation rate: the totalinfrared emission derived from 24um, estimated using both synthetic andempirical ir templates, and the multiwavelength fit to the full galaxy sed. forboth estimates, we computed the sfr density and the specific sfr. the two sfrtracers are roughly consistent, given the uncertainties involved. however, theyshow a systematic trend, ir-based estimates exceeding the fit-based ones as thesfr increases. we show that: a) at z&gt;0.3, the sfr is well correlated withstellar mass, and this relationship seems to steepen with redshift (usingir-based sfrs); b) the contribution to the global sfrd by massive galaxiesincreases with redshift up to ~2.5, more rapidly than for galaxies of lowermass, but appears to flatten at higher z; c) despite this increase, the mostimportant contributors to the sfrd at any z are galaxies of about, orimmediately lower than, the characteristic stellar mass; d) at z~2, massivegalaxies are actively star-forming, with a median sfr 300 msun/yr. during thisepoch, they assemble a substantial part of their final stellar mass; e) thessfr shows a clear bimodal distribution. the analysis of the sfrd and the ssfrseems to support the downsizing scenario, according to which high mass galaxieshave formed their stars earlier and faster than their low mass counterparts. acomparison with theoretical models indicates that they follow the globalincrease in the ssfr with redshift and predict the existence of quiescentgalaxies even at z&gt;1.5, but they systematically underpredict the average ssfr.

0909.2853	evidence for a fast evolution of the uv luminosity function beyond  redshift 6 from a deep hawk-i survey of the goods-s field	we perform a deep search for galaxies in the redshift range 6.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, tomeasure the evolution of the number density of luminous galaxies in thisredshift range and derive useful constraints on the evolution of theirluminosity function. we present here the first results of an eso large program,that exploits the unique combination of area and sensitivity provided in thenear-ir by the camera hawk-i at the vlt. we have obtained two hawk-i pointingson the goods south field for a total of 32 observing hours, covering ~90arcmin2. the images reach y=26.7 mags for the two fields. we have used publicacs images in the z band to select z-dropout galaxies with the colour criteriaz-y&gt;1, y-j&lt;1.5 and y-k&lt;2. the other public data in the ubvrijhk bands are usedto reject possible low redshift interlopers. the output has been compared withextensive monte carlo simulations to quantify the observational effects of ourselection criteria as well as the effects of photometric errors. we detect 7high quality candidates in the magnitude range y=25.5-26.7. this intervalsamples the critical range for m* at z&gt;6 (m_1500 ~- 19.5 to -21.5). afteraccounting for the expected incompleteness, we rule out at a 99% confidencelevel a luminosity function constant from z=6 to z=7, even including theeffects of cosmic variance. for galaxies brighter than m_1500=-19.0 we derive aluminosity density rho_uv=1.5^{+2.0}_{-0.9} 10^25 erg/s/hz/mpc3, implying adecrease by a factor 3.5 from z=6 to z~6.8. on the basis of our findings, wemake predictions for the surface densities expected in future surveys surveys,based on ultra-vista, hst-wfc3 or jwst-nircam, evaluating the bestobservational strategy to maximise their impact.

0707.1783	a photometrically detected forming cluster of galaxies at redshift 1.6  in the goods field	we report the discovery of a localized overdensity at z~1.6 in thegoods-south field, presumably a poor cluster in the process of formation. thethree-dimensional galaxy density has been estimated on the basis of wellcalibrated photometric redshifts from the multiband photometric goods-musiccatalog using the (2+1)d technique. the density peak is embedded in the largerscale overdensity of galaxies known to exist at z=1.61 in the area. theproperties of the member galaxies are compared to those of the surroundingfield and we found that the two populations are significantly differentsupporting the reality of the structure. the reddest galaxies, once evolvedaccording to their best fit models, have colors consistent with the redsequence of lower redshift clusters. the estimated m_200 total mass of thecluster is in the range 1.3 x 10^14 - 5.7x 10^14 msun, depending on the assumedbias factor b. an upper limit for the 2-10 kev x-ray luminosity, based on the1ms chandra observations, is l_x=0.5 x 10^43 erg s^-1, suggesting that thecluster has not yet reached the virial equilibrium.

1002.2068	physical and morphological properties of z~3 lbgs: dependence on lyalpha  line emission	we investigate the physical and morphological properties of lbgs at z ~2.5 to~3.5, to determine if and how they depend on the nature and strength of thelyalpha emission. we selected u-dropout galaxies from the z-detected goodsmusic catalog, by adapting the classical lyman break criteria on the goodsfilter set. we kept only those galaxies with spectroscopic confirmation, mainlyfrom vimos and fors public observations. using the full multi-wavelength14-bands photometry, we determined the physical properties of the galaxies,through a standard spectral energy distribution fitting with the updatedcharlot &amp; bruzual (2009) templates. we also added other relevant observations,i.e. the 24mu m observations from spitzer/mips and the 2 msec chandra x-rayobservations. finally, using non parametric diagnostics (gini, concentration,asymmetry, m_20 and ellipticity), we characterized the rest-frame uv morphologyof the galaxies. we then analyzed how these physical and morphologicalproperties correlate with the presence of the lyalpha line in the opticalspectra. we find that, unlike at higher redshift, the dependence of physicalproperties on the lyalpha line is milder: galaxies without lyalpha in emissiontend to be more massive and dustier than the rest of the sample, but all otherparameters, ages, sfrs, x-ray emission as well as uv morphology do not dependstrongly on the presence of the line emission. a simple scenario where all lbgshave intrinsically high lyalpha emission, but where dust and neutral hydrogencontent (which shape the final appearance of the lyalpha) depend on the mass ofthe galaxies, is able to reproduce the majority of the observed properties atz~3. some modification might be needed to account for the observed evolution ofthese properties with cosmic epoch, which is also discussed.

1010.2754	the lack of intense lyman~alpha in ultradeep spectra of z=7 candidates  in goods-s: imprint of reionization?	we present ultradeep optical spectroscopy obtained with fors2 on vlt of sevenlyman-break galaxy (lbg) candidates at z&gt;6.5 selected in the goods-s field fromhawk-i/vlt and wfc3/hst imaging. for one galaxy we detect a low significanceemission line (s/n&lt; 7), located at 9691.5 +/- 0.5a and with flux 3.4 x10^(-18)erg/cm^2/s. if identified as lyman alpha, it places the lbg at redshiftz=6.972+/- 0.002, with a rest-frame equivalent width ew}=13a. using monte carlosimulations and conservative ew distribution functions at 2&lt;z&lt;6, we estimatethat the probability of observing no galaxies in our data with s/n&gt;10 is ~ 2%,and that of observing only one galaxy out of seven with s/n=5 is ~4%, but thesecan be as small as ~1e-3, depending on the details of the ew distribution. weconclude that either a significant fraction of the candidates is not at highredshift or that some physical mechanism quenches the lyman alpha emissionemerging from the galaxies at z&gt;6.5, abruptly reversing the trend of theincreasing fraction of strong emitters with increasing redshift observed up toz~ 6.5. we discuss the possibility that an increasingly neutral intergalacticmedium is responsible for such quenching.

1011.5500	spectroscopic confirmation of two lyman break galaxies at redshift  beyond 7	we report the spectroscopic confirmation of two lyman break galaxies atredshift &gt; 7. the galaxies were observed as part of an ultra-deep spectroscopiccampaign with fors2 at the eso/vlt for the confirmation of z~7 ``z--banddropout'' candidates selected from our vlt/hawk-i imaging survey. both galaxiesshow a prominent emission line at 9735a and 9858a respectively: the lines havefluxes of ~ 1.6-1.2 x 10^(-17) erg/s/cm2 and exhibit a sharp decline on theblue side and a tail on the red side. the asymmetry is quantitativelycomparable to the observed asymmetry in z ~ 6 ly-alpha lines, where absorptionby neutral hydrogen in the igm truncates the blue side of the emission lineprofile. we carefully evaluate the possibility that the galaxies are instead atlower redshift and we are observing either [oii], [oiii] or h-alpha emission:however from the spectroscopic and the photometric data we conclude that thereare no other plausible identifications, except for ly-alpha at redshift &gt;7,implying that these are two of the most robust redshift determination forgalaxies in the reionization epoch. based on their redshifts and broad--bandphotometry, we derive limits on the star formation rate and on the ultravioletspectral slopes of the two galaxies. we argue that these two galaxies alone areunlikely to have ionized the igm in their surroundings.

1011.6569	a critical analysis of the uv luminosity function at redshift~7 from  deep wfc3 data	the study of the luminosity function (lf) of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) atz=7 is important for ascertaining their role in the reionization of theuniverse. we perform a detailed and critical analysis of the statistical andsystematic errors in the z~7 lf determination: we have assembled a large sampleof candidate lbgs at z~7 from different surveys, spanning a large variety ofareas and depths. in particular, we have combined data from the deep (j&lt;27.4)and ultradeep (j&lt;29.2) surveys recently acquired with the new wfc3 nir cameraon hst, over the goods-ers and the hudf fields, with ground based surveys inwide and shallow areas from vlt and subaru. we have used public acs images inthe z-band to select z-dropout galaxies, and other public data both in the blue(bvi) and in the red bands to reject possible low-redshift interlopers. we havecompared our results with extensive simulations to quantify the observationaleffects of our selection criteria as well as the effects of photometricscatter, color selections or the morphology of the candidates. we have foundthat the number density of faint lbgs at z~7 is only marginally sensitive tothe color selection adopted, but it is strongly dependent from the assumptionmade on the half light distributions of the simulated galaxies, used to correctthe observed sample for incompleteness. the slope of the faint end of the lbgslf has thus a rather large uncertainty, due to the unknown distribution ofphysical sizes of the z~7 lbgs. we conclude that galaxies at z~7 are unable toreionize the universe unless there is a significant evolution in the clumpinessof the igm or in the escape fraction of ionising photons or, alternatively,there is a large population of z~7 lbgs with large physical dimensions butstill not detected by the present observations.

1102.4714	a compton-thick agn at z~5 in the 4 ms chandra deep field south	we report the discovery of a compton-thick active galactic nucleus (agn) atz=4.76 in the 4 ms chandra deep field south. this object was selected as av-band dropout in hst/acs images and previously recognized as an agn fromoptical spectroscopy. the 4 ms chandra observations show a significant(~4.2sigma) x-ray detection at the v-band dropout position. the x-ray sourcedisplays a hardness ratio of hr=0.23+-0.24, which, for a source at z~5, ishighly suggestive of compton-thick absorption. the source x-ray spectrum isseen above the background level in the energy range of ~0.9-4 kev, i.e., in therest-frame energy range of ~5-23 kev. when fixing the photon index togamma=1.8, the measured column density is n_h=1.4^{+0.9}_{-0.5} x 10^{24}cm^{-2}, which is compton-thick. to our knowledge, this is the most distantheavily obscured agn, confirmed by x-ray spectral analysis, discovered so far.the intrinsic (de-absorbed), rest-frame luminosity in the 2-10 kev band is ~2.5x 10^{44} erg s^{-1}, which places this object among type-2 quasars. thespectral energy distribution shows that massive star formation is associatedwith obscured black hole accretion. this system may have then been caughtduring a major co-eval episode of black hole and stellar mass assembly at earlytimes. the measure of the number density of heavily obscured agn at highredshifts will be crucial to reconstruct the bh/galaxy evolution history fromthe beginning.

1103.4478	an x-ray underluminous cluster of galaxies in the 4ms cdfs observations	[abridged] we use the large public spectroscopic database available in thegoods-south field to estimate the dynamical mass and the virialization statusof cluster clg 0332-2747 at z=0.734. cluster members selected from theirphotometric redshift are used with spectroscopic ones to analyse the galaxypopulation of the cluster. in the newly released chandra 4ms observations wedetect a faint extended x-ray emission associated to the cluster. finally, wecompare the optical and x-ray properties of clg 0332-2747 with the predictionsof a well tested semianalytic model. we estimate the velocity dispersion andthe virial mass considering all 44 spectroscopic members, or 20 red-sequencemembers only. we obtain sigma_v=634 +/- 105 km/s, m_200=3.07^{+1.57}_{-1.16}~10^{14} m_sun in the former case, and slightly lower values inthe latter case. the cluster appears to have reached the virial equilibrium: itshows a perfectly gaussian velocity distribution and no evidence forsubstructures. clg 0332-2747 contains a high fraction of bright red galaxies,and is dominated by a very massive (1.1 x 10^{12} m_sun) old brightest clustergalaxy (bcg), suggesting that it formed at an early epoch. we detect a faintextended x-ray source centered on the bcg, with a total x-ray luminosity of l_x~ 2 x 10^{42} erg s^-1 (0.1-2.4 kev). this l_x is lower by a factor of ~10-20than expected according to the m-l_x relation. we provide a possibleexplanation of this discrepancy as due to the effects of agn feedback on theicm: the semianalytic model reproduces the m-l_x relation measured from "x-raybright" clusters, and it predicts a high scatter at low masses due to heatingand expulsion of the cluster gas. interestingly, in the model clusters with anevolved galaxy population like clg 0332-2747 present the largest scatter inx-ray luminosity.

1104.5237	a low escape fraction of ionizing photons of l&gt;l* lyman break galaxies  at z=3.3	we present an upper limit for the relative escape fraction (f_{esc}^{rel}) ofionizing radiation at z~3.3 using a sample of 11 lyman break galaxies (lbgs)with deep imaging in the u band obtained with the large binocular camera,mounted on the prime focus of the large binocular telescope. we selected 11lbgs with secure redshift in the range 3.27&lt;z&lt;3.35, from 3 independent fields.we stacked the images of our sources in the r and u band, which correspond toan effective rest-frame wavelength of 1500\aa and 900\aa respectively,obtaining a limit in the u band image of &gt;=30.7(ab)mag at 1 sigma. we derive a1 sigma upper limit of f_{esc}^{rel}~5%, which is one of the lowest valuesfound in the literature so far at z~3.3. assuming that the upper limit for theescape fraction that we derived from our sample holds for all galaxies at thisredshift, the hydrogen ionization rate that we obtain (gamma_{-12}&lt;0.3 s^{-1})is not enough to keep the igm ionized and a substantial contribution to the uvbackground by faint agns is required. since our sample is clearly still limitedin size, larger z~3 lbg samples, at similar or even greater depths arenecessary to confirm these results on a more firm statistical basis.

1107.1376	spectroscopic confirmation of z~7 lbgs: probing the earliest galaxies  and the epoch of reionization	we present the final results from our ultra-deep spectroscopic campaign withfors2 at the eso/vlt for the confirmation of z~7 "z--band dropout" candidatesselected from our vlt/hawk-i imaging survey over three independent fields. inparticular we report on two newly discovered galaxies at redshift ~6.7 in thentt deep field: both galaxies show a ly-alpha emission line with rest-frame ewsof the order 15-20 a and luminosities of 2-4 x 10^{42} erg/s. we also presentthe results of ultra-deep observations of a sample of i-dropout galaxies, fromwhich we set a solid upper limit on the fraction of interlopers. out of the 20z-dropouts observed we confirm 5 galaxies at 6.7 &lt; z &lt; 7.1. this issystematically below the expectations drawn on the basis of lower redshiftobservations: in particular there is a significant lack of objects withintermediate ly-alpha ews (between 20 and 55 a). we conclude that the trend forthe fraction of ly-alpha emission in lbgs that is constantly increasing fromz~3 to z~6 is most probably reversed from z~6 to z~7.  explaining the observed rapid change in the lae fraction among the drop-outpopulation with reionization requires a fast evolution of the neutral fractionof hydrogen in the universe. assuming that the universe is completely ionizedat z=6 and adopting the semi-analytical models of dijkstra et al. (2011), wefind that our data require a change of the neutral hydrogen fraction of theorder delta chi_{hi} ~ 0.6 in a time delta z ~ 1, provided that the escapefraction does not increase dramatically over the same redshift interval.

1109.1757	the blue uv slopes of z~4 lyman break galaxies: implications for the  corrected star formation rate density	we plan to analyse dust extinction in lyman break galaxies (lbgs) byintroducing a new and more reliable approach to their selection and to thecharacterization of their distribution of uv slopes beta, using deep ir imagesfrom hst. we exploit deep wfc3 ir observations of the ers and hudf fields overgoods-south, combined with hst-acs optical data, to select z~4 lbgs through anew (b-v) vs. (v-h) colour diagram. the uv slope of the selected galaxies isrobustly determined by a linear fit over their observed i, z, y, j magnitudes,coherently with the original definition of beta. the same fit is used todetermine their rest-frame uv magnitudes m1600 through a simple interpolation.we estimate the effect of observational uncertainties with detailed simulationsthat we also exploit, under a parametric maximum-likelihood approach, toconstrain the probability density function of uv slopes pdf(beta) as a functionof rest-frame magnitude. we find 142 and 25 robust lbgs in the ers and hudffields respectively, limiting our sample to s/n(h)&gt;10 objects. our newlydefined criteria improve the selection of z~4 lbgs and allow us to exclude redinterlopers at lower redshift, especially z~3-3.5 objects. we find that z~4lbgs are characterized by blue uv slopes, suggesting a low dust extinction: alll&lt;l* galaxies have an average uv slope &lt;beta&gt;\simeq-2.1, while brighter objectsonly are slightly redder (&lt;beta&gt; -1.9). we find an intrinsic dispersion ~ 0.3for pdf(beta) at all magnitudes. the sfrd at z~4 corrected according to theseestimates turns out to be lower than previously found: log(sfrd)\simeq-1.09m_sun/yr/mpc^3. finally, we discuss how the uv slope of z~4 galaxies changes asa function of the dust-corrected uv magnitude (i.e. sfr) showing that mostgalaxies with a high sfr (&gt; 80 m_sun/yr) are highly extincted objects.[abridged]

1109.2888	faint high-redshift agn in the chandra deep field south: the evolution  of the agn luminosity function and black hole demography	we present detection and analysis of faint x-ray sources in the chandra deepfield south (cdfs) using the 4 msec chandra observation and adopting a newdetection algorithm, based on a targeted search at the position of known high-zgalaxies. this optimized technique results in the identification of 54 z&gt;3agns, 29 of which are new detections. applying stringent completeness criteria,we derive agn luminosity functions in the redshift bins 3-4, 4-5 and &gt;5.8 andfor 42.75&lt;log l(2-10 kev)&lt;44.5. we join this data with the luminous agnluminosity functions from optical surveys and find that the evolution of thehigh-z, wide luminosity range luminosity function can be best modeled by pureluminosity evolution with l* decreasing from 6x10^44 ergs/s at z=3 tol*=2x10^44 ergs/s at z=6. we compare the high-z luminosity function with theprediction of theoretical models using galaxy interactions as agn triggeringmechanism. we find that these models are broadly able to reproduce the high-zagn luminosity functions. a better agreement is found assuming a minimum darkmatter halo mass for black hole formation and growth. we compare our agnluminosity functions with galaxy mass functions to derive high-z agn duty cycleusing observed eddington ratio distributions to derive black hole masses. wefind that the duty cycle increases with galaxy stellar mass and redshift by afactor 10-30 from z=0.25 to z=4-5. we also report on the detection of a largefraction of highly obscured, compton thick agn at z&gt;3 (18+17-10%). theiroptical counterparts are not strongly reddened and we thus conclude that thesize of the x-ray absorber is likely smaller than the dust sublimation radius.we finally report the discovery of a highly star-forming galaxy at z=3.47. ifconfirmed, this would be one of the farthest objects in which stellar sourcesare detected in x-rays.

1111.5728	the evolving slope of the stellar mass function at 0.6 &lt;= z &lt; 4.5 from  deep wfc3 data	we used early release science (ers) observations taken with the wide fieldcamera 3 (wfc3) in the goods-s field to study the galaxy stellar mass function(gsmf) at 0.6&lt;=z&lt;4.5. deep wfc3 near-ir data (for y as faint as 27.3, j and has faint as 27.4 ab mag at 5 sigma), as well as deep ks (as faint as 25.5 at 5sigma) hawk-i band data, provide an exquisite data set with which determine inan unprecedented way the low-mass end of the gsmf, allowing an accurate probeof masses as low as m~7.6 10^9 msun at z~3. although the area used isrelatively small (~33 arcmin^2), we found generally good agreement withprevious studies on the entire mass range. our results show that the slope ofthe faint-end increases with redshift, from alpha=-1.44+/-0.03 at z~0.8 toalpha=-1.86+/-0.16 at z~3, although indications exist that it does not steepenfurther between z~3 and z~4. this result is insensitive to any uncertainty inthe m* parameter. the steepness of the gsmf faint-end solves the well-knowndisagreement between the stellar mass density (smd) and the integrated starformation history at z&gt;2. however, we confirm the that there appears to be anexcess of integrated star formation with respect to the smd at z&lt;2, by a factorof ~2-3. our comparison of the observations with theoretical predictions showsthat the models forecast a greater abundance of low mass galaxies, at least upto z~3, as well as a dearth of massive galaxies at z~4 with respect to thedata, and that the predicted smd is generally overestimated at z&lt;~2.

0710.3704	the red and blue galaxy populations in the goods field: evidence for an  excess of red dwarfs	we study the evolution of the galaxy population up to z\sim3 as a function ofits colour properties. in particular, luminosity functions and luminositydensities have been derived as a function of redshift for the blue/late andred/early populations. we use data from the goods-music catalogue which havetypical magnitude limits z&lt;26 and ks&lt;23.5 for most of the sample. about 8% ofthe galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts; the remaining have well calibratedphotometric redshifts derived from the extremely wide multi-wavelength coveragein 14 bands (from the u band to the spitzer 8 \mu m band). we have derived acatalogue of galaxies complete in rest-frame b-band, which has been divided intwo subsamples according to their rest-frame u-v colour (or derived specificstar formation rate, ssfr) properties. we confirm a bimodality in the u-vcolour and ssfr of the galaxy sample up to z\sim 3. this bimodality is used tocompute the lfs of the blue/late and red/early subsamples. the lfs of theblue/late and total samples are well represented by steep schechter functionsevolving in luminosity with increasing redshifts. the volume density of the lfsof the red/early populations decreases with increasing redshift. the shape ofthe red/early lfs shows an excess of faint red dwarfs with respect to theextrapolation of a flat schechter function and can be represented by the sum oftwo schechter functions. our model for galaxy formation in the hierarchicalclustering scenario, which also includes external feedback due to a diffuse uvbackground, shows a general broad agreement with the lfs of both populations,the larger discrepancies being present at the faint end for the red population.hints on the nature of the red dwarf population are given on the basis of theirstellar mass and spatial distributions.

1206.2950	agns as main contributors to the uv ionizing emissivity at high  redshifts: predictions from a lambda-cdm model with linked agn/galaxy  evolution	we have evaluated the contribution of the agn population to the ionizationhistory of the universe based on a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation andevolution in the cdm cosmological scenario. the model connects the growth ofblack holes and of the ensuing agn activity to galaxy interactions. in themodel we have included a self consistent physical description of the escape ofionizing uv photons; this is based on the blast-wave model for the agn feedbackwe developed in a previous paper to explain the distribution of hydrogen columndensities in agns of various redshifts and luminosities, due to absorption bythe host galaxy gas. the model predicts uv luminosity functions for agns whichare in good agreement with those derived from the observations especially atlow and intermediate redshifts (z=3). at higher redshifts (z&gt;5) the model tendsto overestimate the data at faint luminosities. critical biases both in thedata and in the model are discussed to explain such apparent discrepancies. thepredicted hydrogen photoionization rate as a function of redshift is found tobe consistent with that derived from the observations. all that suggests toreconsider the role of the agns as the main driver of the ionization history ofthe universe.

1208.0506	the size-luminosity relation at z=7 in candels and its implication on  reionization	the exploration of the relation between galaxy sizes and other physicalparameters has provided important clues for understanding galaxy formation. weuse the candels deep+wide surveys in the goods-south, uds and egs fields,complemented by data from the hudf09 program, to address the relation betweensize and luminosity at z\sim7. we select 153 z-band drop-out galaxies in sixdifferent fields characterized by a wide combination of depth and arealcoverage, ideally suited to sample without biases the observed size-magnitudeplane. detailed simulations allow us to derive the completeness as a functionof size and magnitude and to quantify measurements errors/biases. we find thatthe half light radius distribution function of z\sim7 galaxies fainter thanj=26.6 is peaked at &lt;0.1 arcsec (or equivalently 0.5 kpc proper), while atbrighter magnitudes high-z galaxies are typically larger than ~0.15 arcsec. wealso find a well defined size-luminosity relation, rh\siml^1/2. we compute theluminosity function in the hudf and p12hudf fields, finding large spatialvariation on the number density of faint galaxies. adopting the sizedistribution and the size-luminosity relation found for faint galaxies at z=7,we derive a mean slope of -1.7\pm0.1 for the luminosity function of lbgs atthis redshift. using this lf, we find that the amount of ionizing photonscannot keep the universe re-ionized if the igm is clumpy (c_hii&gt;3) and thelyman continuum escape fraction of high-z lbgs is relatively low (f_esc&lt;0.3).with future candels data, we can put severe limits to the role of galaxies inthe reionization of the universe.

1302.2861	the evolution of the agn content in groups up to z~1	determining the agn content in structures of different mass/velocitydispersion and comparing them to higher mass/lower redshift analogs isimportant to understand how the agn formation process is related toenvironmental properties. we use our well-tested cluster finding algorithm toidentify structures in the goods north and south fields, exploiting theavailable spectroscopic redshifts and accurate photometric redshifts. weidentify 9 structures in goods-south (presented in a previous paper) and 8 newstructures in goods-north. we only consider structures where at least 2/3 ofthe members brighter than m_r=-20 have a spectroscopic redshift. for thosegroup members that coincide with x-ray sources in the 4 and 2 msec chandrasource catalogs respectively, we determine if the x-ray emission originatesfrom agn activity or it is related to the galaxies' star-formation activity. wefind that the fraction of agn with log l_h &gt; 42 erg/s in galaxies with m_r &lt;-20 is on average 6.3+-1.3%, much higher than in lower redshift groups ofsimilar mass and more than double the fraction found in massive clusters at asimilarly high redshift. we then explore the spatial distribution of agn in thestructures and find that they preferentially populate the outer regions. thecolors of agn host galaxies in structures tend to be confined to the greenvalley, thus avoiding the blue cloud and, partially, also the red-sequence,contrary to what happens in the field. we finally compare our results to thepredictions of two sets of semi analytic models to investigate the evolution ofagn and evaluate potential triggering and fueling mechanisms. the outcome ofthis comparison attests the importance of galaxy encounters, not necessarilyleading to mergers, as an efficient agn triggering mechanism.

1304.4622	serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096: implications  for the early formation and late evolution of cd galaxies	we have made a serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096 in acandidate rich cluster in the hudf area of goods-south. this brightest clustergalaxy is the most distant cd galaxy confirmed to date. ultra-deep hst/wfc3images reveal an extended envelope starting from ~10 kpc and reaching ~70 kpcin radius along the semi-major axis. the spectral energy distributions indicatethat both its inner component and outer envelope are composed of an old,passively-evolving stellar population. the cd galaxy lies on the same mass-sizerelation as the bulk of quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts. the cd galaxyhas a higher stellar mass surface density but a similar velocity dispersion tothose of more-massive, nearby cds. if the cd galaxy is one of the progenitorsof today's more massive cds, its size and stellar mass have had to increase onaverage by factors of $3.4\pm1.1$ and $3.3\pm1.3$ over the past ~8 gyrs,respectively. such increases in size and stellar mass without being accompaniedby significant increases in velocity dispersion are consistent withevolutionary scenarios driven by both major and minor dry mergers. if such cdenvelopes originate from dry mergers, our discovery of even one example provesthat some bcgs entered the dry merger phase at epochs earlier than z=1. ourdata match theoretical models which predict that the continuance of dry mergersat z&lt;1 can result in structures similar to those of massive cd galaxies seentoday. moreover, our discovery is a surprise given that the extreme depth ofthe hudf is essential to reveal such an extended cd envelope at z&gt;1 and, yet,the hudf covers only a minuscule region of sky. adding that cds are rare, ourserendipitous discovery hints that such cds may be more common than expected.[abridged]

1311.1921	diffuse optical intracluster light as a measure of stellar tidal  stripping: the cluster cl0024+17 at $z\sim $0.4 observed at lbt	we have evaluated the diffuse intracluster light (icl) in the central core ofthe galaxy cluster cl0024+17 at $z\sim 0.4$ observed with the prime focuscamera (lbc) at lbt. the measure required an accurate removal of the galaxieslight within $\sim 200$ kpc from the center. the residual background intensityhas then been integrated in circular apertures to derive the average iclintensity profile. the latter shows an approximate exponential decline asexpected from theoretical cold dark matter models. the radial profile of theicl over the galaxies intensity ratio (icl fraction) is increasing withdecreasing radius but near the cluster center it starts to bend and thendecreases where the overlap of the halos of the brightest cluster galaxiesbecomes dominant. theoretical expectations in a simplified cdm scenario showthat the icl fraction profile can be estimated from the stripped over galaxystellar mass ratio in the cluster. it is possible to show that the latterquantity is almost independent of the properties of the individual hostgalaxies but mainly depends on the average cluster properties. the predictedicl fraction profile is thus very sensitive to the assumed cdm profile, totalmass and concentration parameter of the cluster. adopting values very similarto those derived from the most recent lensing analysis in cl0024+17 we find agood agreement with the observed icl fraction profile. the galaxy counts in thecluster core have then been compared with that derived from composite clustersamples in larger volumes, up to the clusters virial radius. the galaxy countsin the cl0024+17 core appear flatter and the amount of bending respect to theaverage cluster galaxy counts imply a loss of total emissivity in broadagreement with the measured icl fraction.

1312.6299	characterizing faint galaxies in the reionization epoch: lbt confirms  two l&lt;0.2l* sources at z=6.4 behind the clash/frontier fields cluster  macs0717.5+3745	we report the lbt/mods1 spectroscopic confirmation of two images of faintlyman alpha emitters at $z=6.4$ behind the frontier fields galaxy clustermacsj0717.5+3745. a wide range of lens models suggests that the two images arehighly magnified, with a strong lower limit of mu&gt;5. these are the faintest z&gt;6candidates spectroscopically confirmed to date. these may be also multipleimages of the same z=6.4 source as supported by their similar intrinsicproperties, but the lens models are inconclusive regarding this interpretation.to be cautious, we derive the physical properties of each image individually.thanks to the high magnification, the observed near-infrared (restframeultraviolet) part of the spectral energy distributions and ly-alpha lines arewell detected with s/n(m_1500)&gt;~10 and s/n(ly-alpha)~10-15. adopting mu&gt;5, theabsolute magnitudes, m_1500, and ly-alpha fluxes, are fainter than -18.7 and2.8x10^(-18)erg/s/cm2, respectively. we find a very steep ultraviolet spectralslope beta=-3.0+/-0.5 (f_lambda=lambda^(beta)), implying that these are veryyoung, dust-free and low metallicity objects, made of standard stellarpopulations or even extremely metal poor stars (age&lt;~30myr, e(b-v)=0 andmetallicity 0.0-0.2 z/zsolar). the objects are compact (&lt; 1 kpc^(2)), and witha stellar mass m* &lt; 10^(8) m_solar. the very steep beta, the presence of thely-alpha line and the intrinsic fwhm (&lt;300 km/s) of these newborn objects donot exclude a possible leakage of ionizing radiation. we discuss thepossibility that such faint galaxies may resemble those responsible for cosmicreionization.

1403.0743	constraints on the star-formation rate of z~3 lbgs with measured  metallicity in the candels goods-south field	we analyse 14 lbgs at z~2.8-3.8 constituting the only sample where both aspectroscopic measurement of their metallicity and deep ir observations(candels+hugs survey) are available. fixing the metallicity of populationsynthesis models to the observed values, we determine best-fit physicalparameters under different assumptions about the star-formation history andalso consider the effect of nebular emission. for comparison we determine theuv slope of the objects, and use it to estimate their sfr_uv99 by correctingthe uv luminosity following meurer et al. (1999). a comparison between sfrobtained through sed-fitting (sfr_fit) and the sfr_uv99 shows that the latterare underestimated by a factor 2-10, regardless of the assumed sfh. other sfrindicators (radio, far-ir, x-ray, recombination lines) coherently indicate sfrsa factor of 2-4 larger than sfr_uv99 and in closer agreement with sfr_fit. thisdiscrepancy is due to the solar metallicity implied by the usual beta-a1600conversion factor. we propose a refined relation, appropriate for sub-solarmetallicity lbgs: a1600 = 5.32+1.99beta. this relation reconciles thedust-corrected uv with the sed-fitting and the other sfr indicators. we showthat the fact that z~3 galaxies have sub-solar metallicity implies an upwardrevision by a factor of ~1.5-2 of the global sfrd, depending on the assumptionsabout the age of the stellar populations. we find very young best-fit ages(10-500 myrs) for all our objects. from a careful examination of theuncertainties in the fit and the amplitude of the balmer break we conclude thatthere is little evidence of the presence of old stellar population in at leasthalf of the lbgs in our sample, suggesting that these objects are probablycaught during a huge star-formation burst, rather than being the result of asmooth evolution.

1403.3691	discovery of a rich proto-cluster at z=2.9 and associated diffuse cold  gas in the vimos ultra-deep survey (vuds)	[abridged] we characterise a massive proto-cluster at z=2.895 that we foundin the cosmos field using the spectroscopic sample of the vimos ultra-deepsurvey (vuds). this is one of the rare structures at z~3 not identified aroundagns or radio galaxies, so it is an ideal laboratory to study galaxy formationin dense environments. the structure comprises 12 galaxies with securespectroscopic redshift in an area of 7'x8', in a z bin of dz=0.016. themeasured galaxy number overdensity is delta_g=12+/-2. this overdensity hastotal mass of m~8.1x10^(14)m_sun in a volume of 13x15x17 mpc^3. simulationsindicate that such an overdensity at z~2.9 is a proto-cluster that willcollapse in a cluster of total mass m~2.5x10^(15)m_sun at z=0. we compare theproperties of the galaxies within the overdensity with a control sample at thesame z but outside the overdensity. we did not find any statisticallysignificant difference between the properties (stellar mass, sfr, ssfr, nuv-r,r-k) of the galaxies inside and outside the overdensity. the stacked spectrumof galaxies in the overdensity background shows a significant absorptionfeature at the wavelength of lya redshifted at z=2.895 (lambda=4736 a), with arest frame ew = 4+/- 1.4 a. stacking only background galaxies withoutintervening sources at z~2.9 along their line of sight, we find that thisabsorption feature has a rest frame ew of 10.8+/-3.7 a, with a detection s/n of~4. these ew values imply a high column density (n(hi)~3-20x10^(19)cm^(-2)),consistent with a scenario where such absorption is due to intervening cold gasstreams, falling into the halo potential wells of the proto-cluster galaxies.however, we cannot exclude the hypothesis that this absorption is due to thediffuse gas within the overdensity.

1409.7083	a mass threshold in the number density of passive galaxies at z$\sim$2	the process that quenched star formation in galaxies at intermediate and highredshift is still the subject of considerable debate. one way to investigatethis puzzling issue is to study the number density of quiescent galaxies atz~2, and its dependence on mass. here we present the results of a new studybased on very deep ks-band imaging (with the hawk-i instrument on the vlt) oftwo hst candels fields (the ukidss ultra-deep survey (uds) field andgoods-south). the new hawk-i data (taken as part of the hugs vlt large program)reach detection limits of ks&gt;26 (ab mag). we select a sample ofpassively-evolving galaxies in the redshift range 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5. thanks to thedepth and large area coverage of our imaging, we have been able to extend theselection of quiescent galaxies a magnitude fainter than previous analyses.through extensive simulations we demonstrate, for the first time, that theobserved turn-over in the number of quiescent galaxies at k&gt;22 is real. thishas enabled us to establish unambiguously that the number counts of quiescentgalaxies at z~2 flatten and slightly decline at magnitudes fainter thanks~22(ab mag.). we show that this trend corresponds to a stellar mass threshold$m_*10^{10.8}\,{\rm m_{\odot}}$ below which the mechanism that halts the starformation in high-redshift galaxies seems to be inefficient. finally we comparethe observed pbzk number counts with those of quiescent galaxies extracted fromfour different semi-analytic models. we find that none of the models provides astatistically acceptable description of the number density of quiescentgalaxies at these redshifts. we conclude that the mass function of quiescentgalaxies as a function of redshift continues to present a key and demandingchallenge for proposed models of galaxy formation and evolution.

1411.5688	the evolution of clustering length, large-scale bias and host halo mass  at 2&lt;z&lt;5 in the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds)	we investigate the evolution of galaxy clustering for galaxies in theredshift range 2.0&lt;$z$&lt;5.0 using the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds). we presentthe projected (real-space) two-point correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ measuredby using 3022 galaxies with robust spectroscopic redshifts in two independentfields (cosmos and vvds-02h) covering in total 0.8 deg$^2$. we quantify how thescale dependent clustering amplitude $r_0$ changes with redshift making use ofmock samples to evaluate and correct the survey selection function. using apower-law model $\xi(r) = (r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$ we find that the correlationfunction for the general population is best fit by a model with a clusteringlength $r_0$=3.95$^{+0.48}_{-0.54}$ h$^{-1}$mpc and slope$\gamma$=1.8$^{+0.02}_{-0.06}$ at $z$~2.5, $r_0$=4.35$\pm$0.60 h$^{-1}$mpc and$\gamma$=1.6$^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ at $z$~3.5. we use these clustering parametersto derive the large-scale linear galaxy bias $b_l^{pl}$, between galaxies anddark matter. we find $b_l^{pl}$ = 2.68$\pm$0.22 at redshift $z$~3 (assuming$\sigma_8$ = 0.8), significantly higher than found at intermediate and lowredshifts. we fit an hod model to the data and we obtain that the average halomass at redshift $z$~3 is $m_h$=10$^{11.75\pm0.23}$ h$^{-1}$m$_{\odot}$. fromthis fit we confirm that the large-scale linear galaxy bias is relatively highat $b_l^{hod}$ = 2.82$\pm$0.27. comparing these measurements with similarmeasurements at lower redshifts we infer that the star-forming population ofgalaxies at $z$~3 should evolve into the massive and bright ($m_r$&lt;-21.5)galaxy population which typically occupy haloes of mass $\langle m_h\rangle$ =10$^{13.9}$ h$^{-1}$ $m_{\odot}$ at redshift $z$=0.

1412.0532	the galaxy stellar mass function at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 in the candels/uds,  goods-south, and hudf fields	the galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) at high-z provides key information onstar-formation history and mass assembly in the young universe. we aimed to usethe unique combination of deep optical/nir/mir imaging provided by hst, spitzerand the vlt in the candels-uds, goods-south, and hudf fields to determine thegsmf over the redshift range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5. we utilised the hst wfc3/ir nir imagingfrom candels and hudf09, reaching h~27-28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin2,in combination with associated deep hst acs optical data, deep spitzer iracimaging from the seds programme, and deep y and k-band vlt hawk-i images fromthe hugs programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometricredshifts. these have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopicredshifts in the range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, resulting in an overall precision ofsigma_z/(1+z)~0.037. we have determined the low-mass end of the high-z gsmfwith unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as m*~10^9 msun atz=4 and ~6x10^9 msun at z=7. we find that the gsmf at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 depends onlyslightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely thephoto-z, the sfhs, the nebular contribution or the presence of agn on theparent sample. the low-mass end of the gsmf is steeper than has been found atlower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probedhere. our results are very different from previous gsmf estimates based onconverting uv galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight m/lrelations. integrating our evolving gsmf over mass, we find that the growth ofstellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the sfrdensity over cosmic time at z&gt;4. these results confirm the unique synergy ofthe candels+hudf, hugs, and seds surveys for the discovery and study ofmoderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.

1412.5180	stellar masses from the candels survey: the goods-south and uds fields	we present the public release of the stellar mass catalogs for the goods-sand uds fields obtained using some of the deepest near-ir images available,achieved as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacysurvey (candels) project. we combine the effort from ten different teams, whocomputed the stellar masses using the same photometry and the same redshifts.each team adopted their preferred fitting code, assumptions, priors, andparameter grid. the combination of results using the same underlying stellarisochrones reduces the systematics associated with the fitting code and otherchoices. thanks to the availability of different estimates, we can test theeffect of some specific parameters and assumptions on the stellar massestimate. the choice of the stellar isochrone library turns out to have thelargest effect on the galaxy stellar mass estimates, resulting in the largestdistributions around the median value (with a semi interquartile range largerthan 0.1 dex). on the other hand, for most galaxies, the stellar mass estimatesare relatively insensitive to the different parameterizations of the starformation history. the inclusion of nebular emission in the model spectra doesnot have a significant impact for the majority of galaxies (less than a factorof 2 for ~80% of the sample). nevertheless, the stellar mass for the subsampleof young galaxies (age &lt; 100 myr), especially in particular redshift ranges(e.g., 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.4, 3.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.6, and 5.5 &lt; z &lt; 6.5), can be seriouslyoverestimated (by up to a factor of 10 for &lt; 20 myr sources) if nebularcontribution is ignored.

1412.5584	the stellar mass - halo mass relation from galaxy clustering in vuds: a  high star formation efficiency at z~3	the relation between the galaxy stellar mass m_star and the dark matter halomass m_h gives important information on the efficiency in forming stars andassembling stellar mass in galaxies. we present the stellar mass to halo massratio (smhr) measurements at redshifts 2&lt;z&lt;5, obtained from the vimos ultradeep survey. we use halo occupation distribution (hod) modelling of clusteringmeasurements on ~3000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to derive the darkmatter halo mass m_h, and sed fitting over a large set of multi-wavelength datato derive the stellar mass m_star and compute the smhr=m_star/m_h. we find thatthe smhr ranges from 1% to 2.5% for galaxies with m_star=1.3x10^9 m_sun tom_star=7.4x10^9 m_sun in dm halos with m_h=1.3x10^{11} m_sun} to m_h=3x10^{11}m_sun. we derive the integrated star formation efficiency (isfe) of thesegalaxies and find that the star formation efficiency is a moderate 6-9% forlower mass galaxies while it is relatively high at 16% for galaxies with themedian stellar mass of the sample ~7x10^9 m_sun. the lower isfe at lower massesmay indicate that some efficient means of suppressing star formation is at work(like sne feedback), while the high isfe for the average galaxy at z~3 isindicating that these galaxies are efficiently building-up their stellar massat a key epoch in the mass assembly process. we further infer that the averagemass galaxy at z~3 will start experiencing star formation quenching within afew hundred millions years.

1502.00640	alma constraints on the faint millimetre source number counts and their  contribution to the cosmic infrared background	we have analysed 18 alma continuum maps in bands 6 and 7, with rms down to7.8$\mu$jy, to derive differential number counts down to 60$\mu$jy and100$\mu$jy at $\lambda=$1.3 mm and $\lambda=$1.1 mm, respectively. the areacovered by the combined fields is $\rm 9.5\times10^{-4}deg^2$ at 1.1mm and $\rm6.6\times10^{-4}deg^{2}$ at 1.3mm. we improved the source extraction method byrequiring that the dimension of the detected sources be consistent with thebeam size. this method enabled us to remove spurious detections that haveplagued the purity of the catalogues in previous studies. we detected 50 faintsources with s/n$&gt;$3.5 down to 60$\mu$jy, hence improving the statistics by afactor of four relative to previous studies. the inferred differential numbercounts are $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s)=1\times10^5~deg^2$ at a 1.1 mm flux $s_{\lambda= 1.1~mm} = 130~\mu$jy, and $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s)=1.1\times10^5~deg^2$ at a 1.3mm flux $\rm s_{\lambda = 1.3~mm} = 60~\mu$jy. at the faintest flux limits,i.e. 30$\mu$jy and 40$\mu$jy, we obtain upper limits on the differential numbercounts of $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s) &lt; 7\times10^5~deg^2$ and $\rmdn/d(log_{10}s)&lt;3\times10^5~deg^2$, respectively. our results provide a newlower limit to cib intensity of 17.2${\rm jy\ deg^{-2}}$ at 1.1mm and of12.9${\rm jy\ deg^{-2}}$ at 1.3mm. moreover, the flattening of the integratednumber counts at faint fluxes strongly suggests that we are probably close tothe cib intensity. our data imply that galaxies with sfr$&lt;40~m_{\odot}/yr$certainly contribute less than 50% to the cib while more than 50% of the cibmust be produced by galaxies with $\rm sfr&gt;40~m_{\odot}/yr$. the differentialnumber counts are in nice agreement with recent semi-analytical models ofgalaxy formation even as low as our faint fluxes. consequently, this supportsthe galaxy evolutionary scenarios and assumptions made in these models.

1502.04708	peering through the holes: the far uv color of star-forming galaxies at  z~3-4 and the escaping fraction of ionizing radiation	we aim to investigate the effect of the escaping ionizing radiation on thecolor selection of high redshift galaxies and identify candidate lymancontinuum (lyc) emitters. the intergalactic medium prescription of inoue etal.(2014) and galaxy synthesis models of bruzual&amp;charlot (2003) have been usedto properly treat the ultraviolet stellar emission, the stochasticity of theintergalactic transmission and mean free path in the ionizing regime. colortracks are computed by turning on/off the escape fraction of ionizingradiation. at variance with recent studies, a careful treatment of igmtransmission leads to no significant effects on the high-redshift broad-bandcolor selection. the decreasing mean free path of ionizing photons withincreasing redshift further diminishes the contribution of the lyc tobroad-band colors. we also demonstrate that prominent lyc sources can beselected under suitable conditions by calculating the probability of a nullescaping ionizing radiation. the method is applied to a sample of galaxiesextracted from the goods-s field. a known lyc source at z=3.795 is successfullyrecovered as a lyc emitter candidate and another convincing candidate atz=3.212 is reported. a detailed analysis of the two sources (including theirvariability and morphology) suggests a possible mixture of stellar andnon-stellar (agn) contribution in the ultraviolet. conclusions: classicalbroad-band color selection of 2.5&lt;z&lt;4.5 galaxies does not prevent the inclusionof lyc emitters in the selected samples. large fesc in relatively brightgalaxies (l&gt;0.1l*) could be favored by the presence of a faint agn not easilydetected at any wavelength. a hybrid stellar and non-stellar (agn) ionizingemission could coexist in these systems and explain the tensions found amongthe uv excess and the stellar population synthesis models reported inliterature.

1512.00167	identification of z~&gt;2 herschel 500 micron sources using  color-deconfusion	we present a new method to search for candidate z~&gt;2 herschel 500{\mu}msources in the goods-north field, using a s500{\mu}m/s24{\mu}m "colordeconfusion" technique. potential high-z sources are selected againstlow-redshift ones from their large 500{\mu}m to 24{\mu}m flux density ratios.by effectively reducing the contribution from low-redshift populations to theobserved 500{\mu}m emission, we are able to identify counterparts to high-z500{\mu}m sources whose 24{\mu}m fluxes are relatively faint. the recovery ofknown z~4 starbursts confirms the efficiency of this approach in selectinghigh-z herschel sources. the resulting sample consists of 34 dusty star-forminggalaxies at z~&gt;2. the inferred infrared luminosities are in the range1.5x10^12-1.8x10^13 lsun, corresponding to dust-obscured star formation rates(sfrs) of ~260-3100 msun/yr for a salpeter imf. comparison with previous scuba850{\mu}m-selected galaxy samples shows that our method is more efficient atselecting high-z dusty galaxies with a median redshift of z=3.07+/-0.83 and 10of the sources at z~&gt;4. we find that at a fixed luminosity, the dusttemperature is ~5k cooler than that expected from the td-lir relation at z&lt;1,though different temperature selection effects should be taken into account.the radio-detected subsample (excluding three strong agn) follows thefar-infrared/radio correlation at lower redshifts, and no evolution withredshift is observed out to z~5, suggesting that the far-infrared emission isstar formation dominated. the contribution of the high-z herschel 500{\mu}msources to the cosmic sfr density is comparable to that of smg populations atz~2.5 and at least 40% of the extinction-corrected uv samples at z~4(abridged).

1512.02656	infrared color selection of massive galaxies at z &gt; 3	we introduce a new color-selection technique to identify high-redshift,massive galaxies that are systematically missed by lyman-break selection. thenew selection is based on the h_{160} and irac 4.5um bands, specifically h -[4.5] &gt; 2.25 mag. these galaxies, dubbed "hieros", include two majorpopulations that can be separated with an additional j - h color. thepopulations are massive and dusty star-forming galaxies at z &gt; 3 (jh-blue) andextremely dusty galaxies at z &lt; 3 (jh-red). the 350 arcmin^2 of the goods-n andgoods-s fields with the deepest hst/wfc3 and irac data contain 285 hieros downto [4.5] &lt; 24 mag. we focus here primarily on jh-blue (z &gt; 3) hieros, whichhave a median photometric redshift z ~4.4 and stellar massm_{*}~10^{10.6} msun,and are much fainter in the rest-frame uv than similarly massive lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs). their star formation rates (sfrs) reaches ~240 msun yr^{-1}leading to a specific sfr, ssfr ~4.2 gyr^{-1}, suggesting that the ssfrs formassive galaxies continue to grow at z &gt; 2 but at a lower growth rate than fromz=0 to z=2. with a median half-light radius of 2 kpc, including ~20% as compactas quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts, jh-blue hieros represent perfectstar-forming progenitors of the most massive (m_{*} &gt; 10^{11.2} msun) compactquiescent galaxies at z ~ 3 and have the right number density. hieros make up~60% of all galaxies with m_{*} &gt; 10^{10.5} msun identified at z &gt; 3 from theirphotometric redshifts. this is five times more than lbgs with nearly no overlapbetween the two populations. while hieros make up 15-25% of the total sfrdensity at z ~ 4-5, they completely dominate the sfr density taking place inm_{*} &gt;10^{10.5} msun galaxies, and are therefore crucial to understanding thevery early phase of massive galaxy formation.

0811.1861	the physical properties of lyalpha emitting galaxies: not just primeval  galaxies?	we have analyzed a sample of lbgs from z =3.5 to z=6 selected from thegoods-s field as b,v and i-dropouts, and with spectroscopic observationsshowing that they have the lyalpha line in emission. our main aim is toinvestigate their physical properties and their dependence on the emission linecharacteristics, to shed light on the relation between galaxies with lyalphaemission and the general lbg population.the objects were selected from theircontinuum colors and then spectroscopically confirmed by the goodscollaboration and other campaigns. from the spectra we derived the line fluxand ew. we then used u-band to mid-ir photometry from goods-music to derive thephysical properties of the galaxies, such as total stellar mass, age and so on,through standard sed fitting techniques.although most galaxies are fit by youngstellar populations, a small but non negligible fraction has seds that requireconsiderably older stellar component, up to 1 gyr. there is no apparentrelation between age and ew: some of the oldest galaxies have large ew, andshould be also selected in narrow band surveys. therefore not all lyalphaemitters are primeval galaxies in the very early stages of formation,as iscommonly assumed. we also find a large range of stellar populations, withmasses from 5x10^8 msol to 5x10^10 msol and sfr from few to 60 msol/yr.although there is no correlation between mass and ew, we find a significantlack of massive galaxies with high ew, which could be explained if the mostmassive galaxies were more dusty and/or contained more neutral gas than lessmassive objects. finally we find that more than half of the galaxies containsmall but non negligible amounts of dust: the mean e(b-v) and the ew are wellcorrelated, although with a large scatter, as already found at lower redshift
