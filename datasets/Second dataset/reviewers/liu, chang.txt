0903.3968	reconnection electric field and hardness of x-ray emission of solar  flares	magnetic reconnection is believed to be the prime mechanism to trigger solarflares and accelerate electrons up to energies of mev. in the classicaltwo-dimensional reconnection model, the separation motion of chromosphericribbons manifests the successive reconnection that takes place higher up in thecorona. meanwhile, downward traveling energetic electrons bombard the densechromosphere and create hard x-ray (hxr) emissions, which provide a valuablediagnostic of electron acceleration. analyses of ribbon dynamics and hxrspectrum have been carried out separately. in this letter, we report a study ofthe comparison of reconnection electric field measured from ribbon motion andhardness (spectral index) of x-ray emission derived from x-ray spectrum. oursurvey of the maximum average reconnection electric field and the minimumoverall spectral index for 13 two-ribbon flares show that they are stronglyanti-correlated. the former is also strongly correlated with flare magnitudemeasured using the peak flux of soft x-ray emissions. these provide strongsupport for electron acceleration models based on the electric field generatedat reconnecting current sheet during flares.

0908.0487	successive solar flares and coronal mass ejections on 2005 september 13  from noaa ar 10808	we present a multiwavelength study of the 2005 september 13 eruption fromnoaa 10808 that produced total four flares and two fast coronal mass ejections(cmes) within 1.5 hours. our primary attention is paid to the fact that theseeruptions occurred in close succession in time, and that all of them werelocated along an s-shaped magnetic polarity inversion line (pil) of the activeregion. in our analysis, (1) the disturbance created by the first flarepropagated southward along the pil to cause a major filament eruption that ledto the first cme and the associated second flare underneath. (2) the first cmepartially removed the overlying magnetic fields over the northern delta spot toallow the third flare and the second cme. (3) the ribbon separation during thefourth flare would indicate reclosing of the overlying field lines opened bythe second cme. it is thus concluded that this series of flares and cmes areinterrelated to each other via magnetic reconnections between the expandingmagnetic structure and the nearby magnetic fields. these results complementprevious works made on this event with the suggested causal relationship amongthe successive eruptions.

0910.1799	critical change in the fermi surface of iron arsenic superconductors at  the onset of superconductivity	the phase diagram of a correlated material is the result of a complexinterplay between several degrees of freedom, providing a map of the material'sbehavior. one can understand (and ultimately control) the material's groundstate by associating features and regions of the phase diagram, with specificphysical events or underlying quantum mechanical properties. the phase diagramof the newly discovered iron arsenic high temperature superconductors isparticularly rich and interesting. in the ae(fe1-xtx)2as2 class (ae being ca,sr, ba, t being transition metals), the simultaneous structural/magnetic phasetransition that occurs at elevated temperature in the undoped material, splitsand is suppressed by carrier doping, the suppression being complete aroundoptimal doping. a dome of superconductivity exists with apparent equal ease inthe orthorhombic / antiferromagnetic (afm) state as well as in the tetragonalstate with no long range magnetic order. the question then is what determinesthe critical doping at which superconductivity emerges, if the afm order isfully suppressed only at higher doping values. here we report evidence fromangle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (arpes) that critical changes in thefermi surface (fs) occur at the doping level that marks the onset ofsuperconductivity. the presence of the afm order leads to a reconstruction ofthe electronic structure, most significantly the appearance of the small holepockets at the fermi level. these hole pockets vanish, i. e. undergo a lifshitztransition, at the onset of superconductivity. superconductivity and magnetismare competing states in the iron arsenic superconductors. in the presence ofthe hole pockets superconductivity is fully suppressed, while in their absencethe two states can coexist.

0707.2240	the eruption from a sigmoidal solar active region on 2005 may 13	this paper presents a multiwavelength study of the m8.0 flare and itsassociated fast halo cme that originated from a bipolar active region noaa10759 on 2005 may 13. the source active region has a conspicuous sigmoidstructure at trace 171 a channel as well as in the sxi soft x-ray images, andwe mainly concern ourselves with the detailed process of the sigmoid eruptionas evidenced by the multiwavelength data ranging from halpha, wl, euv/uv,radio, and hard x-rays (hxrs). the most important finding is that the flarebrightening starts in the core of the active region earlier than that of therising motion of the flux rope. this timing clearly addresses one of the mainissues in the magnetic eruption onset of sigmoid, namely, whether the eruptionis initiated by an internal tether-cutting to allow the flux rope to riseupward or a flux rope rises due to a loss of equilibrium to later induce tethercutting below it. our high time cadence sxi and halpha data shows that thefirst scenario is relevant to this eruption. as other major findings, we havethe rhessi hxr images showing a change of the hxr source from a confinedfootpoint structure to an elongated ribbon-like structure after the flaremaximum, which we relate to the sigmoid-to-arcade evolution. radio dynamicspectrum shows a type ii precursor that occurred at the time of expansion ofthe sigmoid and a drifting pulsating structure in the flare rising phase inhxr. finally type ii and iii bursts are seen at the time of maximum hxremission, simultaneous with the maximum reconnection rate derived from theflare ribbon motion in uv. we interpret these various observed properties withthe runaway tether-cutting model proposed by moore et al. in 2001.

1005.4137	observational evidence of back-reaction on the solar surface associated  with coronal magnetic restructuring in solar eruptions	most models of solar eruptions assume that coronal field lines are anchoredin the dense photosphere and thus the photospheric magnetic fields would nothave rapid, irreversible changes associated with eruptions resulted from thecoronal magnetic reconnection. motivated by the recent work of hudson, fisher &amp;welsch (2008) on quantitatively evaluating the back reaction due to energyrelease from the coronal fields, in this letter we synthesize our previousstudies and present analysis of new events about flare-related changes ofphotospheric magnetic fields. for the 11 x-class flares where vectormagnetograms are available, we always find an increase of transverse field atthe polarity inversion line (pil) although only 4 events had measurements with1 minute temporal resolution. we also discuss 18 events with 1 minute cadenceline-of-sight magnetogram observation, which all show prominent changes ofmagnetic flux contained in the flaring delta spot region. except in one case,the observed limb-ward flux increases while disk-ward flux decreases rapidlyand irreversibly after flares. this observational evidence provides support,either directly or indirectly, for the theory and prediction of hudson, fisher&amp; welsch that the photospheric magnetic fields must respond to coronal fieldrestructuring and turn to a more horizontal state near the pil after eruptions.

1008.4863	gradual inflation of active-region coronal arcades building up to  coronal mass ejections	the pre-cme structure is of great importance to understanding the origin ofcmes, which, however, has been largely unknown for cmes originating from activeregions. in this paper, selected for studying are 16 active-region coronalarcades whose gradual inflation lead up to cmes. 12 of them clearly build uponpost-eruptive arcades resulting from a preceding eruption. the observedinflation sustains for 8.7 +/- 4.1 h, with the arcade rising from 1.15 +/- 0.06rsun to 1.36 +/- 0.07 rsun within the eit field of view (fov). the rising speedis less than 5 km s-1 for most of the time. only at the end of thisquasi-static stage, it increases to tens of kilometers per second over tens ofminutes. the arcade then erupts out of the eit fov as a cme with similarmorphology. this pre-cme structure is apparently unaffected by the flaresoccurring during its quasi-static inflation phase, but is closely coupled withthe flare occurring during its acceleration phase. for four events that wereobserved on the disk, it is found that the gradual inflation of the arcade isaccompanied by significant helicity injection from photosphere. in particular,a swirling structure, which is reminiscent of a magnetic flux rope, wasobserved in one of the arcades over 4 h prior to the subsequent cme, and thegrowth of the arcade is associated with the injection of helicity of oppositesense into the active region via flux emergence. we propose a four-phaseevolution paradigm for the observed cmes, i.e., a quasi-static inflation phasewhich corresponds to the buildup of magnetic free energy in the corona,followed by the frequently observed three-phase paradigm, including an initialphase, an acceleration phase and a gradual phase.

1008.5381	motions of hard x-ray sources during an asymmetric eruption	filament eruptions and hard x-ray (hxr) source motions are commonly observedin solar flares, which provides critical information on the coronal magneticreconnection. this letter reports an event on 2005 january 15, in which wefound an asymmetric filament eruption and a subsequent coronal mass ejectiontogether with complicated motions of hxr sources during the goes-class x2.6flare. the hxr sources initially converge to the magnetic polarity inversionline (pil), and then move in directions either parallel or perpendicular to thepil depending on the local field configuration. we distinguish the evolution ofthe hxr source motion in four phases and associate each of them with distinctregions of coronal magnetic fields as reconstructed using a non-linearforce-free field extrapolation. it is found that the magnetic reconnectionproceeds along the pil toward the regions where the overlying field decreaseswith height more rapidly. it is also found that not only the perpendicular butthe parallel motion of the hxr sources correlates well with the hxr lightcurve.these results are discussed in favor of the torus instability as an importantfactor in the eruptive process.

1011.1181	sigmoid-to-flux-rope transition leading to a loop-like coronal mass  ejection	sigmoids are one of the most important precursor structures for solareruptions. in this letter, we study a sigmoid eruption on 2010 august 1 witheuv data obtained by the atmospheric imaging assembly (aia) on board the solardynamic observatory (sdo). in aia 94 \aa\ (fe xviii; 6 mk), topologicalreconfiguration due to tether-cutting reconnection is unambiguously observedfor the first time, i.e., two opposite j-shaped loops reconnect to form acontinuous s-shaped loop, whose central portion is dipped and aligned along themagnetic polarity inversion line (pil), and a compact loop crossing the pil. acausal relationship between photospheric flows and coronal tether-cuttingreconnections is evidenced by the detection of persistent converging flowstoward the pil using line-of-sight magnetograms obtained by the helioseismicand magnetic imager (hmi) on board sdo. the s-shaped loop remains inquasi-equilibrium in the lower corona for about 50 minutes, with the centraldipped portion rising slowly at ~10 km s-1. the speed then increases to ~60 kms-1 about 10 minutes prior to the onset of a goes-class c3.2 flare, as thes-shaped loop speeds up its transformation into an arch-shaped loop, whicheventually leads to a loop-like coronal mass ejection (cme). the aiaobservations combined with h? filtergrams as well as hard x-ray (hxr) imagingand spectroscopy are consistent with most flare loops being formed byreconnection of the stretched legs of less-sheared j-shaped loops thatenvelopes the rising flux rope, in agreement with the standard tether-cuttingscenario.

1103.0027	first flare-related rapid change of photospheric magnetic field observed  by solar dynamics observatory	photospheric magnetic field not only plays important roles in building upfree energy and triggering solar eruptions, but also has been observed tochange rapidly and permanently responding to the coronal magnetic fieldrestructuring due to coronal transients. the helioseismic and magnetic imagerinstrument (hmi) on board the newly launched solar dynamics observatory (sdo)produces seeing-free full-disk vector magnetograms at consistently highresolution and high cadence, which finally makes possible an unambiguous andcomprehensive study of this important back-reaction process. in this study, wepresent a near disk-center, goes-class x2.2 flare occurred at noaa ar 11158 on2011 february 15 using the magnetic field measurements made by hmi. we obtainedthe first solid evidence of an enhancement in the transverse magnetic field atthe flaring magnetic polarity inversion line (pil) by a magnitude of 70%. thisrapid and irreversible field evolution is unequivocally associated with theflare occurrence, with the enhancement area located in between the twochromospheric flare ribbons. similar findings have been made for another twomajor flare events observed by sdo. these results strongly corroborate ourprevious suggestion that the photospheric magnetic field near the pil mustbecome more horizontal after eruptions.  in-depth studies will follow to further link the photospheric magnetic fieldchanges with the dynamics of coronal mass ejections, when full stokes inversionis carried out to generate accurate magnetic field vectors.

0709.3340	flow field evolution of a decaying sunspot	we study the evolution of the flows and horizontal proper motions in andaround a decaying follower sunspot based on time sequences of two-dimensionalspectroscopic observations in the visible and white light imaging data obtainedover six days from june~7 to~12, 2005. during this time period the sunspotdecayed gradually to a pore. the spectroscopic observations were obtained withthe fabry-p\'{e}rot based visible-light imaging magnetograph (vim) inconjunction with the high-order adaptive optics (ao) system operated at the 65cm vacuum reflector of the big bear solar observatory (bbso). we apply localcorrelation tracking (lct) to the speckle reconstructed time sequences ofwhite-light images around 600 nm to infer horizontal proper motions while thedoppler shifts of the scanned \fei line at 630.15 nm are used to calculateline-of-sight (los) velocities with sub-arcsecond resolution. we find that thedividing line between radial inward and outward proper motions in the inner andouter penumbra, respectively, survives the decay phase. in particular the moatflow is still detectable after the penumbra disappeared. based on ourobservations three major processes removed flux from the sunspot: (a)fragmentation of the umbra, (b) flux cancelation of moving magnetic features(mmfs; of the same polarity as the sunspot) that encounter the leading oppositepolarity network and plages areas, and (c) flux transport by mmfs (of the samepolarity as the sunspot) to the surrounding network and plage regions that havethe same polarity as the sunspot.

1104.3902	rapid enhancement of sheared evershed flow along the neutral line  associated with an x6.5 flare observed by hinode	we present g-band and ca ii h observations of noaa ar 10930 obtained byhinode/sot on 2006 december 6 covering an x6.5 flare. local correlationtracking (lct) technique was applied to the foreshortening-corrected g-bandimage series to acquire horizontal proper motions in this complexbeta-gamma-delta active region. with the continuous high quality, spatial andtemporal resolution g-band data, we not only confirm the rapid decay of outerpenumbrae and darkening of the central structure near the flaring neutral line,but also unambiguously detect for the first time the enhancement of the shearedevershed flow (average horizontal flow speed increased from 330+-3.1 to403+-4.6 m/s) along the neutral line right after the eruptive white-lightflare. post-flare ca ii h images indicate that the originally fanning out fieldlines at the two sides of the neutral line get connected. since penumbralstructure and evershed flow are closely related to photospheric magneticinclination or horizontal field strength, we interpret the rapid changes ofsunspot structure and surface flow as the result of flare-induced magneticrestructuring down to the photosphere. the magnetic fields turn from fanningout to inward connection causing outer penumbrae decay, meanwhile those nearthe flaring neutral line become more horizontal leading to stronger evershedflow there. the inferred enhancement of horizontal magnetic field near theneutral line is consistent with recent magnetic observations and theoreticalpredictions of flare-invoked photospheric magnetic field change.

1105.3244	a standard-to-blowout jet	the commonly observed jets provide critical information on the small-scaleenergy release in the solar atmosphere. we report a near disk-center jet on2010 july 20, observed by the solar dynamics observatory. in this event, thestandard interchange magnetic reconnection between an emerging flux spanning 9x 10^3 km and ambient open fields is followed by a blowout-like eruption. inthe "standard" stage, as the emerging negative element approached the nearbypositive network fields, a jet with a dome-like base in euv grew for 30 minutesbefore the jet spire began to migrate laterally with enhanced flux emergence.in the "blowout" stage, the above converging fields collided and the subsequentcancellation produced a uv microflare lasting seven minutes, in which the domeof the jet seemed to be blown out as (1) the spire swung faster and exhibitedan unwinding motion before vanishing, (2) a rising loop and a blob eruptedleaving behind cusped structures, with the blob spiraling outward inacceleration after the flare maximum, and (3) ejecting material with acurtain-like structure at chromospheric to transition-region temperatures alsounderwent a transverse motion. it is thus suggested that the flare reconnectionrapidly removes the outer fields of the emerging flux to allow its twisted corefield to erupt, a scenario favoring the jet-scale magnetic breakout model asrecently advocated by moore et al. in 2010.

1112.3598	rapid changes of photospheric magnetic field after tether-cutting  reconnection and magnetic implosion	the rapid, irreversible change of the photospheric magnetic field has beenrecognized as an important element of the solar flare process. this letterreports such a rapid change of magnetic fields during the 2011 february 13 m6.6flare in noaa ar 11158 that we found from the vector magnetograms of thehelioseismic and magnetic imager with 12-min cadence. high-resolutionmagnetograms of hinode that are available at ~-5.5, -1.5, 1.5, and 4 hrsrelative to the flare maximum are used to reconstruct three-dimensional coronalmagnetic field under the nonlinear force-free field (nlfff) assumption. uv andhard x-ray images are also used to illuminate the magnetic field evolution andenergy release. the rapid change is mainly detected by hmi in a compact regionlying in the center of the magnetic sigmoid, where the mean horizontal fieldstrength exhibited a significant increase by 28%. the region lies between theinitial strong uv and hard x-ray sources in the chromosphere, which arecospatial with the central feet of the sigmoid according to the nlfff model.the nlfff model further shows that strong coronal currents are concentratedimmediately above the region, and that more intriguingly, the coronal currentsystem underwent an apparent downward collapse after the sigmoid eruption.these results are discussed in favor of both the tether-cutting reconnectionproducing the flare and the ensuing implosion of the coronal field resultingfrom the energy release.

1203.2267	rapid transition of uncombed penumbrae to faculae during large flares	in the past two decades, the complex nature of sunspots has been disclosedwith high-resolution observations. one of the most important findings is the"uncombed" penumbral structure, where a more horizontal magnetic componentcarrying most of evershed flows is embedded in a more vertical magneticbackground (solanki &amp; montavon 1993). the penumbral bright grains are locationsof hot upflows and dark fibrils are locations of horizontal flows that areguided by nearly horizontal magnetic field. on the other hand, it was foundthat flares may change the topology of sunspots in $\delta$ configuration: thestructure at the flaring polarity inversion line becomes darkened whilesections of peripheral penumbrae may disappear quickly and permanentlyassociated with flares (liu et al. 2005). the high spatial and temporalresolution observations obtained with hinode/ sot provide an excellentopportunity to study the evolution of penumbral fine structure associated withmajor flares. taking advantage of two near-limb events, we found that insections of peripheral penumbrae swept by flare ribbons, the dark fibrilscompletely disappear, while the bright grains evolve into faculae that aresignatures of vertical magnetic flux tubes. the corresponding magnetic fluxesmeasured in the decaying penumbrae show stepwise changes temporally correlatedwith the flares. these observations suggest that the horizontal magnetic fieldcomponent of the penumbra could be straightened upward (i.e., turning fromhorizontal to vertical) due to magnetic field restructuring associated withflares, which results in the transition of penumbrae to faculae.

1208.0640	contracting and erupting components of sigmoidal active regions	it is recently noted that solar eruptions can be associated with thecontraction of coronal loops that are not involved in magnetic reconnectionprocesses. in this paper, we investigate five coronal eruptions originatingfrom four sigmoidal active regions, using high-cadence, high-resolutionnarrowband euv images obtained by the solar dynamic observatory (sdo}). themagnitudes of the flares associated with the eruptions range from thegoes-class b to x. owing to the high-sensitivity and broad temperature coverageof the atmospheric imaging assembly (aia) onboard sdo, we are able to identifyboth the contracting and erupting components of the eruptions: the former isobserved in cold aia channels as the contracting coronal loops overlying theelbows of the sigmoid, and the latter is preferentially observed in warm/hotaia channels as an expanding bubble originating from the center of the sigmoid.the initiation of eruption always precedes the contraction, and in theenergetically mild events (b and c flares), it also precedes the increase ingoes soft x-ray fluxes. in the more energetic events, the eruption issimultaneous with the impulsive phase of the nonthermal hard x-ray emission.these observations confirm the loop contraction as an integrated process ineruptions with partially opened arcades. the consequence of contraction is anew equilibrium with reduced magnetic energy, as the contracting loops neverregain their original positions. the contracting process is a directconsequence of flare energy release, as evidenced by the strong correlation ofthe maximal contracting speed, and strong anti-correlation of the time delay ofcontraction relative to expansion, with the peak soft x-ray flux. this is alsoimplied by the relationship between contraction and expansion, i.e., theirtiming and speed.

1210.4437	on the relationship between coronal magnetic decay index and cme speed	numerical simulations suggest that kink and torus instabilities are twopotential contributors to the initiation and prorogation of eruptive events. amagnetic parameter named decay index (i.e., the coronal magnetic gradient ofthe overlying fields above the eruptive flux ropes) could play an importantrole in controlling kinematics of eruptions. previous studies have identified athreshold range of the decay index that distinguishes between eruptive andconfined configurations. here we advance the study by investigating if there isa clear correlation between the decay index and cme speed. 38 cmes associatedwith filament eruptions and/or two-ribbon flares are selected using the halphadata from the global halpha network. the filaments and flare ribbons observedin halpha associated with the cmes help to locate the magnetic polarityinversion line, along which the decay index is calculated based on thepotential field extrapolation using mdi magnetograms as boundary conditions.the speeds of cmes are obtained from the lasco c2 cme catalog available online.we find that the mean decay index increases with cme speed for those cmes witha speed below 1000 km/s, and stays flat around 2.2 for the cmes with higherspeeds. in addition, we present a case study of a partial filament eruption, inwhich the decay indexes show different values above the erupted/non-eruptedpart.

1304.4171	high-cadence and high-resolution halpha imaging spectroscopy of a  circular flare's remote ribbon with ibis	we present an unprecedented high-resolution \ha\ imaging spectroscopicobservation of a c4.1 flare taken with ibis on 2011 october 22. the flareconsists of a main circular ribbon that occurred in a parasitic magneticconfiguration and a remote ribbon that was observed by the ibis. such acircular-ribbon flare with a remote brightening is predicted in 3d fan-spinereconnection but so far has been rarely observed. during the flare impulsivephase, we define "core" and "halo" structures in the observed ribbon. examiningthe \ha\ emission spectra averaged in the flare core and halo areas, we findthat only those from the flare cores show typical nonthermal electron beamheating characteristics. these characteristics include: broad and centrallyreversed emission spectra, excess emission in the red wing with regard to theblue wing (i.e., red asymmetry), and redshifted bisectors of the emissionspectra. we also observe rather quick timescales for the heating (30 s) andcooling (14--33 s) in the flare core locations. therefore, we suggest that theflare cores revealed by ibis track the sites of electron beam precipitationwith exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. the flare cores showtwo-stage motion (a parallel motion along the ribbon followed by an expansionmotion perpendicular to the ribbon) during the two impulsive phases of theflare. some cores jump quickly (30 \kms) between discrete magnetic elementsimplying reconnection involving different flux tubes. we observe a very hightemporal correlation ($\gtrsim0.9$) between the integrated \ha\ and hxremission during the flare impulsive phase. a short time delay (4.6 s) is alsofound in the \ha\ emission spikes relative to hxr bursts. the ionizationtimescale of the cool chromosphere and the extra time taken for the electronsto travel to the remote ribbon site may contribute to this delay.

1306.4634	surface electronic structure of a topological kondo insulator candidate  smb6: insights from high-resolution arpes	the kondo insulator smb6 has long been known to exhibit low temperature (t &lt;10k) transport anomaly and has recently attracted attention as a newtopological insulator candidate. by combining low-temperature and highenergy-momentum resolution of the laser-based arpes technique, for the firsttime, we probe the surface electronic structure of the anomalous conductivityregime. we observe that the bulk bands exhibit a kondo gap of 14 mev andidentify in-gap low-lying states within a 4 mev window of the fermi level onthe (001)-surface of this material. the low-lying states are found to formelectron-like fermi surface pockets that enclose the x and the gamma points ofthe surface brillouin zone. these states disappear as temperature is raisedabove 15k in correspondence with the complete disappearance of the 2dconductivity channels in smb6. while the topological nature of the in-gapmetallic states cannot be ascertained without spin (spin-texture) measurementsour bulk and surface measurements carried out in thetransport-anomaly-temperature regime (t &lt; 10k) are consistent with thefirst-principle predicted fermi surface behavior of a topological kondoinsulator phase in this material.

1306.6068	he i d3 observation of the 1984 may 22 m6.3 solar flare	he i d3 line has a unique response to the flare impact on the low solaratmosphere and can be a powerful diagnostic tool for energy transportprocesses. using images obtained from the recently digitized films of big bearsolar observatory, we report d3 observation of the m6.3 flare on 1984 may 22,which occurred in an active region with a circular magnetic polarity inversionline (pil). the impulsive phase of the flare starts with a main elongatedsource that darkens in d3, inside of which bright emission kernels appear atthe time of the initial small peak in hard x-rays (hxrs). these flare coressubsequently evolve into a sharp emission strand lying within the dark halosimultaneously with the main peak in hxrs, reversing the overall sourcecontrast from -5% to 5%. the radiated energy in d3 during the main peak isestimated to be about 10^30 ergs, which is comparable to that carried bynonthermal electrons above 20 kev. afterwards the flare proceeds along thecircular pil in the counterclockwise direction to form a dark circular ribbonin d3, which apparently mirrors the bright ribbons in halpha and he i 10830 a.all these ribbons last for over one hour in the late gradual phase. we suggestthat the present event resembles the so-called black-light flare that isproposed based on continuum images, and that d3 darkening and brighteningfeatures herein may be due to, respectively, the thermal conduction heating andthe direct precipitation of high-energy electrons.

1308.2639	study of rapid formation of a delta sunspot associated with the 2012  july 2 c7.4 flare using high-resolution observations of new solar telescope	rapid, irreversible changes of magnetic topology and sunspot structureassociated with flares have been systematically observed in recent years. themost striking features include the increase of horizontal field at the polarityinversion line (pil) and the co-spatial penumbral darkening. a likelyexplanation of the above phenomenon is the back reaction to the coronalrestructuring after eruptions: a coronal mass ejection carries the upwardmomentum while the downward momentum compresses the field lines near the pil.previous studies could only use low resolution (above 1") magnetograms andwhite-light images. therefore, the changes are mostly observed for x-classflares. taking advantage of the 0.1" spatial resolution and 15s temporalcadence of the new solar telescope at big bear solar observatory, we report indetail the rapid formation of sunspot penumbra at the pil associated with thec7.4 flare on 2012 july 2. it is unambiguously shown that the solar granulationpattern evolves to alternating dark and bright fibril structure, the typicalpattern of penumbra. interestingly, the appearance of such a penumbra creates anew delta sunspot. the penumbral formation is also accompanied by theenhancement of horizontal field observed using vector magnetograms from thehelioseismic and magnetic imager. we explain our observations as due to theeruption of a flux rope following magnetic cancellation at the pil.subsequently the re-closed arcade fields are pushed down towards the surface toform the new penumbra. nlfff extrapolation clearly shows both the flux ropeclose to the surface and the overlying fields.

1310.5098	evidence for solar tether-cutting magnetic reconnection from coronal  field extrapolations	magnetic reconnection is one of the primary mechanisms for triggering solareruptive events, but direct observation of its rapid process has been ofchallenge. in this letter we present, using a nonlinear force-free field(nlfff) extrapolation technique, a visualization of field line connectivitychanges resulting from tether-cutting reconnection over about 30 minutes duringthe 2011 february 13 m6.6 flare in noaa ar 11158. evidence for thetether-cutting reconnection was first collected through multiwavelengthobservations and then by the analysis of the field lines traced from positionsof four conspicuous flare 1700 a footpoints observed at the event onset. rightbefore the flare, the four footpoints are located very close to the regions oflocal maxima of magnetic twist index. especially, the field lines from theinner two footpoints form two strongly twisted flux bundles (up to ~1.2 turns),which shear past each other and reach out close to the outer two footpoints,respectively. immediately after the flare, the twist index of regions aroundthe footpoints greatly diminish and the above field lines become low lying andless twisted (~0.6 turns), overarched by loops linking the later formed twoflare ribbons. about 10% of the flux (~3x10^19 mx) from the inner footpointshas undergone a footpoint exchange. this portion of flux originates from theedge regions of the inner footpoints that are brightened first. these rapidchanges of magnetic field connectivity inferred from the nlfff extrapolationare consistent with the tether-cutting magnetic reconnection model.

1509.01792	the role of erupting sigmoid in triggering a flare with parallel and  large-scale quasi-circular ribbons	in this paper, we present observations and analysis of an interesting sigmoidformation, eruption and the associated flare that occurred on 2014 april 18using multi-wavelength data sets. we discuss the possible role of the sigmoideruption in triggering the flare, which consists of two different set ofribbons: parallel ribbons as well as a large-scale quasi-circular ribbon.several observational evidence and nonlinear force-free field extrapolationresults show the existence of a large-scale fan-spine type magneticconfiguration with a sigmoid lying under a section of the fan dome. the eventcan be explained with the following two phases. during the pre-flare phase, weobserved the formation and appearance of sigmoid via tether-cuttingreconnection between the two sets of sheared fields under the fan dome. thesecond, main flare phase, features the eruption of the sigmoid, the subsequentflare with parallel ribbons, and a quasi-circular ribbon. we propose thefollowing multi-stage successive reconnections scenario for the main flare.first, tether-cutting reconnection is responsible for the formation and theeruption of the sigmoid structure. second, the reconnection occurred in thewake of the erupting sigmoid produces the parallel flare ribbons on the bothsides of the circular polarity inversion line. third, the null-typereconnection higher in the corona, possibly triggered by the erupting sigmoid,leads to the formation of a large quasi-circular ribbon. for the first time wesuggest a mechanism for this type of flare consisting of a double set ofribbons triggered by an erupting sigmoid in a large scale fan-spine typemagnetic configuration.

1509.08414	a circular-ribbon solar flare following an asymmetric filament eruption	the dynamic properties of flare ribbons and the often associated filamenteruptions can provide crucial information on the flaring coronal magneticfield. this letter analyzes the goes-class x1.0 flare on 2014 march 29(sol2014-03-29t17:48), in which we found an asymmetric eruption of a sigmoidalfilament and an ensuing circular flare ribbon. initially both euv images and apreflare nonlinear force-free field model show that the filament is embedded inmagnetic fields with a fan-spine-like structure. in the first phase, which isdefined by a weak but still increasing x-ray emission, the western portion ofthe sigmoidal filament arches upward and then remains quasi-static for aboutfive minutes. the western fan-like and the outer spine-like fields display anascending motion, and several associated ribbons begin to brighten. also foundis a bright euv flow that streams down along the eastern fan-like field. in thesecond phase that includes the main peak of hard x-ray (hxr) emission, thefilament erupts, leaving behind two major hxr sources formed around its centraldip portion and a circular ribbon brightened sequentially. the expandingwestern fan-like field interacts intensively with the outer spine-like field,as clearly seen in running difference euv images. we discuss these observationsin favor of a scenario where the asymmetric eruption of the sigmoidal filamentis initiated due to an mhd instability and further facilitated by reconnectionat a quasi-null in corona; the latter is in turn enhanced by the filamenteruption and subsequently produces the circular flare ribbon.

1510.03491	blow-up for the 1d nonlinear schr\"odinger equation with point  nonlinearity i: basic theory	we consider the 1d nonlinear schr\"odinger equation (nls) with focusing pointnonlinearity, $$ (\delta\text{nls}) \qquad i\partial_t\psi + \partial_x^2\psi +\delta|\psi|^{p-1}\psi = 0, $$ where $\delta=\delta(x)$ is the delta functionsupported at the origin. we show that $\delta$nls shares many properties incommon with those previously established for the focusing autonomoustranslationally-invariant nls $$ (\text{nls}) \qquad i\partial_t \psi + \delta\psi + |\psi|^{p-1}\psi=0 \,. $$ the critical sobolev space $\dot h^{\sigma_c}$for $\delta$nls is $\sigma_c=\frac12-\frac{1}{p-1}$, whereas for nls it is$\sigma_c=\frac{d}{2}-\frac{2}{p-1}$. in particular, the $l^2$ critical casefor $\delta$nls is $p=3$. we prove several results pertaining to blow-up for$\delta$nls that correspond to key classical results for nls. specifically, we(1) obtain a sharp gagliardo-nirenberg inequality analogous to weinstein(1983), (2) apply the sharp gagliardo-nirenberg inequality and a local virialidentity to obtain a sharp global existence/blow-up threshold analogous toweinstein (1983), glassey (1977) in the case $\sigma_c=0$ and duyckaerts,holmer, &amp; roudenko (2008), guevara (2014), and fang, xie, &amp; cazenave (2011) for$0&lt;\sigma_c&lt;1$, (3) prove a sharp mass concentration result in the $l^2$critical case analogous to tsutsumi (1990), merle &amp; tsutsumi (1990) and (4)show that minimal mass blow-up solutions in the $l^2$ critical case arepseudoconformal transformations of the ground state, analogous to merle (1993).

1512.01085	fast average-case pattern matching on weighted sequences	a weighted string over an alphabet of size $\sigma$ is a string in which aset of letters may occur at each position with respective occurrenceprobabilities. weighted strings, also known as position weight matrices oruncertain sequences, naturally arise in many contexts. in this article, westudy the problem of weighted string matching with a special focus onaverage-case analysis. given a weighted pattern string $x$ of length $m$, atext string $y$ of length $n&gt;m$, and a cumulative weight threshold $1/z$,defined as the minimal probability of occurrence of factors in a weightedstring, we present an algorithm requiring average-case search time $o(n)$ forpattern matching for weight ratio $\frac{z}{m} &lt; \min\{\frac{1}{\logz},\frac{\log \sigma}{\log z (\log m + \log \log \sigma)}\}$. for a patternstring $x$ of length $m$, a weighted text string $y$ of length $n&gt;m$, and acumulative weight threshold $1/z$, we present an algorithm requiringaverage-case search time $o(\sigma n)$ for the same weight ratio. theimportance of these results lies on the fact that these algorithms work inaverage-case sublinear search time in the size of the text, and in linearpreprocessing time and space in the size of the pattern, for these ratios.

1512.02338	structure, stability, and evolution of magnetic flux ropes from the  perspective of magnetic twist	we investigate the evolution of noaa active region 11817 during 2013 august10--12, when it developed a complex field configuration and produced fourconfined, followed by two eruptive, flares. these c-and-above flares are allassociated with a magnetic flux rope (mfr) located along the major polarityinversion line, where shearing and converging photospheric flows are present.aided by the nonlinear force-free field modeling, we identify the mfr throughmapping magnetic connectivities and computing the twist number $\mathcal{t}_w$for each individual field line. the mfr is moderately twisted ($|\mathcal{t}_w|&lt; 2$) and has a well-defined boundary of high squashing factor $q$. we foundthat the field line with the extremum $|\mathcal{t}_w|$ is a reliable proxy ofthe rope axis, and that the mfr's peak $|\mathcal{t}_w|$ temporarily increaseswithin half an hour before each flare while it decreases after the flare peakfor both confined and eruptive flares. this pre-flare increase in$|\mathcal{t}_w|$ has little effect on the active region's free magnetic energyor any other parameters derived for the whole region, due to its moderateamount and the mfr's relatively small volume, while its decrease after flaresis clearly associated with the stepwise decrease in free magnetic energy due tothe flare. we suggest that $\mathcal{t}_w$ may serve as a useful parameter inforewarning the onset of eruption, and therefore, the consequent space weathereffects. the helical kink instability is identified as the prime candidateonset mechanism for the considered flares.

0810.3731	decomposition of almost poisson structure of non-self-adjoint dynamical  systems	non-self-adjoint dynamical systems, e.g., nonholonomic systems, can admit analmost poisson structure, which is formulated by a kind of poisson bracketsatisfying the usual properties except for the jacobi identity. a generaltheory of the almost poisson structure is investigated based on a decompositionof the bracket into a sum of a poisson one and an almost poisson one. thecorresponding relation between poisson structure and symplectic structure isproved, making use of jacobiizer and symplecticizer. based on analysis ofpseudo-symplectic structure of constraint submanifold of chaplygin nonholonomicsystems, an almost poisson bracket for the systems is constructed anddecomposed into a sum of a canonical poisson one and an almost poisson one.similarly, an almost poisson structure, which can be decomposed into a sum ofcanonical one and an almost lie-poisson one, is also constructed on an affinespace with torsion whose autoparallels are utilized to described the freemotion of some non-self-adjoint systems. the decomposition of the almostpoisson bracket directly leads to a decomposition of a dynamical vector fieldinto a sum of usual hamiltionian vector field and an almost hamiltonian one,which is useful to simplifying the integration of vector fields.
