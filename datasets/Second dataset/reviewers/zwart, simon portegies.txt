0902.4463	sapporo: a way to turn your graphics cards into a grape-6	we present sapporo, a library for performing high-precision gravitationaln-body simulations on nvidia graphical processing units (gpus). our librarymimics the grape-6 library, and n-body codes currently running on grape-6 canswitch to sapporo by a simple relinking of the library. the precision of ourlibrary is comparable to that of grape-6, even though internally the gpuhardware is limited to single precision arithmetics. this limitation iseffectively overcome by emulating double precision for calculating the distancebetween particles. the performance loss of this operation is small (&lt; 20%)compared to the advantage of being able to run at high precision. we tested thelibrary using several grape-6-enabled n-body codes, in particular with starlaband phigrape. we measured peak performance of 800 gflop/s for running with 10^6particles on a pc with four commercial g92 architecture gpus (two geforce9800gx2). as a production test, we simulated a 32k plummer model with equalmass stars well beyond core collapse. the simulation took 41 days, during whichthe mean performance was 113 gflop/s. the gpu did not show any problems fromrunning in a production environment for such an extended period of time.

0904.0997	on the onset of runaway stellar collisions in dense star clusters - ii.  hydrodynamics of three-body interactions	the onset of runaway stellar collisions in young star clusters is more likelyto initiate with an encounter between a binary and a third star than betweentwo single stars. using the initial conditions of such three-star encountersfrom direct $n$-body simulations, we model the resulting interaction by meansof smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph). we find that, in the majority of thecases considered, all three stars merge together, and in such three starmergers, the hydrodynamic simulations reveal that: (1) mass lost as ejecta canbe a considerable fraction of the total mass in the system (up to $\sim25$%);(2) due to asymmetric mass loss, the collision product can sometimes receive akick velocity that exceeds 10 km/s, large enough to allow the collision productto escape the core of the cluster; and (3) the energy of the ejected matter canbe large enough (up to $\sim 3\times 10^{50}$ erg) to remove or disturb theinter cluster gas appreciably.

0904.3934	effects of primordial mass segregation on the dynamical evolution of  star clusters	in this paper we use n-body simulations to study the effects of primordialmass segregation on the early and long-term evolution of star clusters. oursimulations show that in segregated clusters early mass loss due to stellarevolution triggers a stronger expansion than for unsegregated clusters. tidallylimited, strongly segregated clusters may dissolve rapidly as a consequence ofthis early expansion, while segregated clusters initially underfilling theirroche lobe can survive the early expansion and have a lifetime similar to thatof unsegregated clusters. long-lived initially segregated clusters tend to havelooser structure and reach core collapse later in their evolution thaninitially unsegregated clusters. we have also compared the effects of dynamicalevolution on the global stellar mass function (mf) of low-mass main sequencestars. in all cases the mf flattens as the cluster loses stars. the amount ofmf flattening induced by a given amount of mass loss in a rapidly dissolvinginitially segregated cluster is less than for an unsegregated cluster. theevolution of the mf of a long-lived segregated cluster, on the other hand, isvery similar to that of an initially unsegregated cluster.

0707.0438	high performance direct gravitational n-body simulations on graphics  processing units -- ii: an implementation in cuda	we present the results of gravitational direct $n$-body simulations using thegraphics processing unit (gpu) on a commercial nvidia geforce 8800gtx designedfor gaming computers. the force evaluation of the $n$-body problem isimplemented in ``compute unified device architecture'' (cuda) using the gpu tospeed-up the calculations. we tested the implementation on three different$n$-body codes: two direct $n$-body integration codes, using the 4th orderpredictor-corrector hermite integrator with block time-steps, and onebarnes-hut treecode, which uses a 2nd order leapfrog integration scheme. theintegration of the equations of motions for all codes is performed on the hostcpu.  we find that for $n &gt; 512$ particles the gpu outperforms the grape-6af, ifsome softening in the force calculation is accepted. without softening and forvery small integration time steps the grape still outperforms the gpu. weconclude that modern gpus offer an attractive alternative to grape-6af specialpurpose hardware. using the same time-step criterion, the total energy of the$n$-body system was conserved better than to one in $10^6$ on the gpu, onlyabout an order of magnitude worse than obtained with grape-6af. for $n \apgt10^5$ the 8800gtx outperforms the host cpu by a factor of about 100 and runs atabout the same speed as the grape-6af.

1001.0773	simulating the universe on an intercontinental grid of supercomputers	understanding the universe is hampered by the elusiveness of its most commonconstituent, cold dark matter. almost impossible to observe, dark matter can bestudied effectively by means of simulation and there is probably no otherresearch field where simulation has led to so much progress in the last decade.cosmological n-body simulations are an essential tool for evolving densityperturbations in the nonlinear regime. simulating the formation of large-scalestructures in the universe, however, is still a challenge due to the enormousdynamic range in spatial and temporal coordinates, and due to the enormouscomputer resources required. the dynamic range is generally dealt with by thehybridization of numerical techniques. we deal with the computationalrequirements by connecting two supercomputers via an optical network and makethem operate as a single machine. this is challenging, if only for the factthat the supercomputers of our choice are separated by half the planet, as oneis located in amsterdam and the other is in tokyo. the co-scheduling of the twocomputers and the 'gridification' of the code enables us to achieve a 90%efficiency for this distributed intercontinental supercomputer.

1002.1961	young massive star clusters	young massive clusters are dense aggregates of young stars that form thefundamental building blocks of galaxies. several examples exist in the milkyway galaxy and the local group, but they are particularly abundant in starburstand interacting galaxies. the few young massive clusters that are close enoughto resolve are of prime interest for studying the stellar mass function and theecological interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics. thedistant unresolved clusters may be effectively used to study the star-clustermass function, and they provide excellent constraints on the formationmechanisms of young cluster populations. young massive clusters are expected tobe the nurseries for many unusual objects, including a wide range of exoticstars and binaries. so far only a few such objects have been found in youngmassive clusters, although their older cousins, the globular clusters, areunusually rich in stellar exotica. in this review we focus on star clustersyounger than $\sim100$ myr, more than a few current crossing times old, andmore massive than $\sim10^4$ \msun, irrespective of cluster size orenvironment. we describe the global properties of the currently known youngmassive star clusters in the local group and beyond, and discuss the state ofthe art in observations and dynamical modeling of these systems. in order tomake this review readable by observers, theorists, and computationalastrophysicists, we also review the cross-disciplinary terminology.

1005.4593	on the temporal evolution of the stellar mass function in galactic  clusters	we show that we can obtain a good fit to the present day stellar massfunctions (mfs) of a large sample of young and old galactic clusters in therange 0.1 - 10 msolar with a tapered power law distribution function with anexponential truncation of the form dn/dm \propto m^alpha [1 -exp-(m/m_c)^beta]. the average value of the power-law index alpha is -2, thatof beta is 2.5, whereas the characteristic mass m_c is in the range 0.1 - 0.8msolar and does not seem to vary in any systematic way with the present clusterparameters such as metal abundance, total cluster mass or centralconcentration. however, m_c shows a remarkable correlation with the dynamicalage of the cluster, namely m_c/msolar ~ 0.15 + 0.5 tau_dyn^0.75, where tau_dynis the dynamical age taken as the ratio of cluster age and dissolution time.the small scatter seen around this correlation is consistent with theuncertainties on the estimated value of tau_dyn. we attribute the observedtrend to the onset of mass segregation via two-body relaxation in a tidalenvironment, causing the preferential loss of low-mass stars from the clusterand hence a drift of the characteristic mass m_c towards higher values. ifdynamical evolution is indeed at the origin of the observed trend, it wouldseem plausible that high-concentration globular clusters, now with median m_c ~0.33 msolar, were born with a stellar mf very similar to that measured today inthe youngest galactic clusters and with a value of m_c ~ 0.15 msolar. thishypothesis is consistent with the absence of a turn-over in the mf of thegalactic bulge down to the observational limit at ~0.2 msolar and, if correct,it would carry the implication that the characteristic mass is not set by thethermal jeans mass of the cloud.

1103.2375	the formation of the eccentric-orbit millisecond pulsar j1903+0327 and  the origin of single millisecond pulsars	the millisecond pulsar j1903+0327 is accompanied by an ordinary g-dwarf starin an unusually wide ($p_{\rm orb} \simeq 95.2$\,days) and eccentric ($e \simeq0.44$) orbit. the standard model for producing msps fails to explain theorbital characteristics of this extraordinary binary, and alternative binarymodels are unable to explain the observables. we present a triple-star modelfor producing msps in relatively wide eccentric binaries with a normal(main-sequence) stellar companion. we start from a stable triple systemconsisting of a low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb) with an orbital period of at least1 day, accompanied by a g-dwarf in a wide and possibly eccentric orbit.variations in the initial conditions naturally provide a satisfactoryexplanation for the unexplained triple component in the eclipsing soft x-raytransient 4u~2129+47 or the cataclysmic variable ec 19314-5915. the bestexplanation for j1903, however, results from the expansion of the orbit of thelmxb, driven by the mass transfer from the evolving donor star to its neutronstar companion, which causes the triple eventually to becomes dynamicallyunstable. using numerical computations we show that, depending on the precisesystem configuration at the moment the triple becomes dynamically unstable, theejection of each of the three components is possible. if the donor star of thelmxb is ejected, a system resembling j1903, will result. if the neutron star isejected, a single msp results. this model therefore also provides astraightforward mechanism for forming single msp in the galactic disk. weconclude that the galaxy contains some 30--300 binaries with characteristicssimilar to j1903, and about an order of magnitude fewer single millisecondpulsars produced with the proposed triple scenario.

1204.5522	multi-physics simulations using a hierarchical interchangeable software  interface	we introduce a general-purpose framework for interconnecting scientificsimulation programs using a homogeneous, unified interface. our framework isintrinsically parallel, and conveniently separates all component numericalmodules in memory. this strict separation allows automatic unit conversion,distributed execution of modules on different cores within a cluster or grid,and orderly recovery from errors. the framework can be efficiently implementedand incurs an acceptable overhead. in practice, we measure the time spent inthe framework to be less than 1% of the wall-clock time. due to the unifiedstructure of the interface, incorporating multiple modules addressing the samephysics in different ways is relatively straightforward. different modules maybe advanced serially or in parallel. despite initial concerns, we haveencountered relatively few problems with this strict separation betweenmodules, and the results of our simulations are consistent with earlier resultsusing more traditional monolithic approaches. this framework provides aplatform to combine existing simulation codes or develop new physical solvercodes within a rich "ecosystem" of interchangeable modules.

1210.5540	planet-mediated precision-reconstruction of the evolution of the  cataclysmic variable hu aquarius	cataclysmic variables (cvs) are binaries in which a compact white dwarfaccretes material from a low-mass companion star. the discovery of two planetsin orbit around the cv hu aquarii opens unusual opportunities for understandingthe formation and evolution of this system. in particular the orbitalparameters of the planets constrains the past and enables us to reconstruct theevolution of the system through the common-envelope phase. during this dramaticevent the entire hydrogen envelope of the primary star is ejected, passing thetwo planets on the way. the observed eccentricities and orbital separations ofthe planets in hu aqr enable us to limit the common-envelope parameter $\alpha\lambda = 0.45\pm 0.17$ or $\gamma = 1.77\pm0.02$ and measure the rate at whichthe common envelope is ejected, which turns out to be copious. the mass in thecommon envelope is ejected from the binary system at a rate of ${\dot m} =1.9\pm 0.3\,\msun/yr$. the reconstruction of the initial conditions for hu aqrindicates that the primary star had a mass of $m_{\rm zams} =1.6\pm0.2$\,\msun\, and a $m_{\rm zams} = 0.47\pm 0.04$\,\msun\, companion in a$a=25$--160\,\rsun\, (best value $a=97$\,\rsun) binary. the two planets wereborn with an orbital separation of $a_a=541\pm44$\,\rsun\, and$a_b=750\pm72$\,\rsun\, respectively. after the common envelope, the primarystar turns into a $0.52\pm0.01$\,\msun\, helium white dwarf, which subsequentlyaccreted $\sim 0.30$\,\msun\, from its roche-lobe filling companion star,grinding it down to its current observed mass of $0.18\,\msun$.

1301.6784	the effect of many minor mergers on the size growth of compact quiescent  galaxies	massive galaxies with a half-mass radius &lt;~ 1kpc are observed in the earlyuniverse (z~&gt;2), but not in the local universe. in the local universesimilar-mass (within a factor of two) galaxies tend to be a factor of 4 to 5larger. dry minor mergers are known to drive the evolution of the size of agalaxy without much increasing the mass, but it is unclear if the growth insize is sufficient to explain the observations. we test the hypothesis thatgalaxies grow through dry minor mergers by simulating merging galaxies withmass ratios of q=1:1 (equal mass) to q=1:160. in our n-body simulations thetotal mass of the parent galaxy doubles. we confirm that major mergers do notcause a sufficient growth in size. the observation can be explained withmergers with a mass ratio of q=1:5--1:10. smaller mass ratios cause a moredramatic growth in size, up to a factor of ~17 for mergers with a mass ratio of1:80. for relatively massive minor mergers q ~&gt; 1:20 the mass of the incomingchild galaxies tend to settle in the halo of the parent galaxy. this is causedby the tidal stripping of the child galaxies by the time they enter the centralportion of the parent. when the accretion of minor galaxies becomes morecontinuous, when q &lt;~ 1:40, the foreign mass tends to concentrate more in thecentral region of the parent galaxy. we speculate that this is caused bydynamic interactions between the child galaxies inside the merger remnant andthe longer merging times when the difference in mass is larger. theseinteractions cause dynamical heating which results in accretion of mass insidethe galaxy core and a reduction of the parent's circular velocity and density.

1303.6961	are super-luminous supernovae and long grbs produced exclusively in  young dense star clusters?	super luminous supernovae (slsn) occur almost exclusively in small galaxies(smc/lmc-like or smaller), and the few slsn observed in larger star-forminggalaxies always occur close to the nuclei of their hosts. another type ofpeculiar and highly energetic supernovae are the broad-line type ic sne (snic-bl) that are associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs). alsothese have a strong preference for occurring in small (smc/lmc-like or smaller)star-forming galaxies, and in these galaxies lgrbs always occur in thebrightest spots. studies of nearby star-forming galaxies that are similar tothe hosts of lgrbs show that these brightest spots are giant hii regionsproduced by massive dense young star clusters with many hundreds of o- andwolf-rayet-type stars. such dense young clusters are also found in abundancewithin a few hundred parsecs from the nucleus of larger galaxies like our own.we argue that the slsn and the sn ic-bl/lgrbs are exclusive products of twotypes of dynamical interactions in dense young star clusters. in our model thehigh angular momentum of the collapsing stellar cores required for the"engines" of a sn ic-bl results from the post-main sequence mergers ofdynamically produced cluster binaries with almost equal-mass components. themerger produces a critically rotating single helium star with sufficent angularmomentum to produce a lgrb; the observed "metal aversio" of lgrbs is a naturalconsequence of the model. we argue that, on the other hand, slsn could be theproducts of runaway multiple collisions in dense clusters, and we present (andquantize) plausible scenarios of how the different types of slsns can beproduced.

1307.2445	structure and evolution of high-mass stellar mergers	in young dense clusters repeated collisions between massive stars may lead tothe formation of a very massive star (above 100 msun). in the past the study ofthe long-term evolution of merger remnants has mostly focussed on collisionsbetween low-mass stars (up to about 2 msun) in the context of blue-stragglerformation. the evolution of collision products of more massive stars has notbeen as thoroughly investigated. in this paper we study the long-term evolutionof a number of stellar mergers formed by the head-on collision of a primarystar with a mass of 5-40 msun with a lower mass star at three points in itsevolution in order to better understand their evolution.  we use smooth particle hydrodynamics (sph) calculations to model thecollision between the stars. the outcome of this calculation is reduced to onedimension and imported into a stellar evolution code. we follow the subsequentevolution of the collision product through the main sequence at least until theonset of helium burning.  we find that little hydrogen is mixed into the core of the collisionproducts, in agreement with previous studies of collisions between low-massstars. for collisions involving evolved stars we find that during the mergerthe surface nitrogen abundance can be strongly enhanced. the evolution of mostof the collision products proceeds analogously to that of normal stars with thesame mass, but with a larger radius and luminosity. however, the evolution ofcollision products that form with a hydrogen depleted core is markedlydifferent from that of normal stars with the same mass. they undergo along-lived period of hydrogen shell burning close to the main-sequence band inthe hertzsprung-russell diagram and spend the initial part of core heliumburning as compact blue supergiants.

1309.1475	the evolution of triples with a roche-lobe filling outer star	the evolution of triples has not attracted much attention in the literature,although their evolution can be dramatically different from binaries and singlestars. triples are quite common, and we find that for about 1% of the triplesin the tokovinin catalogue of multiple stellar systems in the solarneighbourhood, the tertiary star will overflow its roche lobe at some time inits evolution, before any of the inner stars leave the main sequence. for twoof these systems, xi tauri and hd97131 we simulate in detail this phase of masstransfer, during which stellar evolution, gravitational dynamics andhydrodynamics all play an important role. we have used the astrophysicalmulti-purpose software environment (amuse) to solve these physical processes ina self-consistent way. the resulting evolution, mass transfer and the effectson the inner as well as on the outer orbit are profound, although it is nottrivial to predict the eventual consequence of the phase of mass transfer andthe appearance of the resulting system.

1309.7352	evolution of star clusters in a cosmological tidal field	we present a method to couple n-body star cluster simulations to acosmological tidal field, using the astrophysical multipurpose softwareenvironment. we apply this method to star clusters embedded in the cosmogriddark matter-only lambdacdm simulation. our star clusters are born at z = 10(corresponding to an age of the universe of about 500 myr) by selecting a darkmatter particle and initializing a star cluster with 32,000 stars on itslocation. we then follow the dynamical evolution of the star cluster within thecosmological environment.  we compare the evolution of star clusters in two milky-way size haloes with adifferent accretion history. the mass loss of the star clusters is continuousirrespective of the tidal history of the host halo, but major merger eventstend to increase the rate of mass loss. from the selected two dark matterhaloes, the halo that experienced the larger number of mergers tends to drive asmaller mass loss rate from the embedded star clusters, even though the finalmasses of both haloes are similar. we identify two families of star clusters:native clusters, which become part of the main halo before its final majormerger event, and the immigrant clusters, which are accreted upon or after thisevent; native clusters tend to evaporate more quickly than immigrant clusters.accounting for the evolution of the dark matter halo causes immigrant starclusters to retain more mass than when the z=0 tidal field is taken as a staticpotential. the reason for this is the weaker tidal field experienced byimmigrant star clusters before merging with the larger dark matter halo.

1402.6713	on the minimal accuracy required for simulating self-gravitating systems  by means of direct n-body methods	the conservation of energy, linear momentum and angular momentum areimportant drivers for our physical understanding of the evolution of theuniverse. these quantities are also conserved in newton's laws of motion undergravity \citep{newton:1687}. numerical integration of the associated equationsof motion is extremely challenging, in particular due to the steady growth ofnumerical errors (by round-off and discrete time-stepping,\cite{1981pazh....7..752b,1993apj...415..715g,1993apj...402l..85h,1994lnp...430..131m})and the exponential divergence \citep{1964apj...140..250m,2009mnras.392.1051u}between two nearby solution. as a result, numerical solutions to the generaln-body problem are intrinsically questionable\citep{2003gmbp.book.....h,1994jam....61..226l}. using brute force integrationsto arbitrary numerical precision we demonstrate empirically that ensembles ofdifferent realizations of resonant 3-body interactions produce statisticallyindistinguishable results. although individual solutions using commonintegration methods are notoriously unreliable, we conjecture that an ensembleof approximate 3-body solutions accurately represents an ensemble of truesolutions, so long as the energy during integration is conserved to better than1/10. we therefore provide an independent confirmation that previous work onself-gravitating systems can actually be trusted, irrespective of the intrinsicchaotic nature of the n-body problem.

1409.4765	on the effects of subvirial initial conditions and the birth temperature  of r136	we investigate the effect of different initial virial temperatures, q, on thedynamics of star clusters. we find that the virial temperature has a strongeffect on many aspects of the resulting system, including among others: thefraction of bodies escaping from the system, the depth of the collapse of thesystem, and the strength of the mass segregation. these differences deem thepractice of using "cold" initial conditions no longer a simple choice ofconvenience. the choice of initial virial temperature must be carefullyconsidered as its impact on the remainder of the simulation can be profound. wediscuss the pitfalls and aim to describe the general behavior of the collapseand the resultant system as a function of the virial temperature so that a wellreasoned choice of initial virial temperature can be made. we make a correctionto the previous theoretical estimate for the minimum radius, $r_{min}$, of thecluster at the deepest moment of collapse to include a q dependency,$r_{min}\approx q + n^{(-1/3)}$, where $n$ is the number of particles.  we use our numerical results to infer more about the initial conditions ofthe young cluster r136. based on our analysis, we find that r136 was likelyformed with a rather cool, but not cold, initial virial temperature ($q\approx0.13$). using the same analysis method, we examined 15 other young clusters andfound the most common initial virial temperature to be between 0.18 and 0.25.

1411.6671	on the reliability of n-body simulations	the general consensus in the n-body community is that statistical results ofan ensemble of collisional n-body simulations are accurate, even thoughindividual simulations are not. a way to test this hypothesis is to make adirect comparison of an ensemble of solutions obtained by conventional methodswith an ensemble of true solutions. in order to make this possible, we wrote ann-body code called brutus, that uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic. incombination with the bulirsch--stoer method, brutus is able to obtain convergedsolutions, which are true up to a specified number of digits. we performsimulations of democratic 3-body systems, where after a sequence of resonancesand ejections, a final configuration is reached consisting of a permanentbinary and an escaping star. we do this with conventional double-precisionmethods, and with brutus; both have the same set of initial conditions andinitial realisations. the ensemble of solutions from the conventionalsimulations is compared directly to that of the converged simulations, both asan ensemble and on an individual basis to determine the distribution of theerrors. we find that on average at least half of the conventional simulationsdiverge from the converged solution, such that the two solutions aremicroscopically incomparable. for the solutions which have not divergedsignificantly, we observe that if the integrator has a bias in energy andangular momentum, this propagates to a bias in the statistical properties ofthe binaries. in the case when the conventional solution has diverged onto anentirely different trajectory in phase-space, we find that the errors arecentred around zero and symmetric; the error due to divergence is unbiased, aslong as the time-step parameter, eta &lt;= 2^(-5) and when simulations whichviolate energy conservation by more than 10% are excluded.

1501.02819	the fate of supernova remnants near quiescent supermassive black holes	there is mounting observational evidence that most galactic nuclei host bothsupermassive black holes (smbhs) and young populations of stars. with anabundance of massive stars, core-collapse supernovae are expected in smbhspheres of influence. we develop a novel numerical method, based on thekompaneets approximation, to trace supernova remnant (snr) evolution in thesehostile environments, where radial gas gradients and smbh tides are present. wetrace the adiabatic evolution of the snr shock until 50% of the remnant iseither in the radiative phase or is slowed down below the smbh keplerianvelocity and is sheared apart. in this way, we obtain shapes and lifetimes ofsnrs as a function of the explosion distance from the smbh, the gas densityprofile and the smbh mass. as an application, we focus here exclusively onquiescent smbhs, because their light may not hamper detections of snrs andbecause we can take advantage of the unsurpassed detailed observations of ourgalactic centre. assuming that properties such as gas and stellar content scaleappropriately with the smbh mass, we study snr evolution around other quiescentsmbhs. we find that, for smbh masses over ~10^7 msun, tidal disruption of snrscan occur at less than 10^4 yr, leading to a shortened x-ray emitting adiabaticphase, and to no radiative phase. on the other hand, only modest disruption isexpected in our galactic centre for snrs in their x-ray stage. this is inaccordance with estimates of the lifetime of the sgr a east snr, which leads usto expect one supernova per 10^4 yr in the sphere of influence of sgr a*.

1501.07441	intermediate-mass black holes in globular clusters: observations and  simulations	the study of intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs) is a young and promisingfield of research. formed by runaway collisions of massive stars in young anddense stellar clusters, intermediate-mass black holes could still be present inthe centers of globular clusters, today. our group investigated the presence ofintermediate-mass black holes for a sample of 10 galactic globular clusters. wemeasured the inner kinematic profiles with integral-field spectroscopy anddetermined masses or upper limits of central black holes in each cluster. incombination with literature data we further studied the positions of ourresults on known black-hole scaling relations (such as m_bh - sigma) and founda similar but flatter correlation for imbhs. applying cluster evolution codes,the change in the slope could be explained with the stellar mass loss occurringin clusters in a tidal field over its life time. furthermore, we presentresults from several numerical simulations on the topic of imbhs and integralfield units (ifus). we ran n-body simulations of globular clusters containingimbhs in a tidal field and studied their effects on mass-loss rates and remnantfractions and showed that an imbh in the center prevents core collapse andejects massive objects more rapidly. these simulations were further used tosimulate ifu data cubes. for the specific case of ngc 6388 we simulated twodifferent ifu techniques and found that velocity dispersion measurements fromindividual velocities are strongly biased towards lower values due to blends ofneighbouring stars and background light. in addition, we use the astrophysicalmultipurpose software environment (amuse) to combine gravitational physics,stellar evolution and hydrodynamics to simulate the accretion of stellar windsonto a black hole.

1504.05702	a debris disk under the influence of a wide planetary mass companion:  the system of hd106906	the 13 myr old star hd106906 is orbited by a debris disk of at least 0.067m_moon with an inner and outer radius of 20 au and 120 au, respectively, and bya planet at a distance of 650 au. we use this curious combination of a closelow-mass disk and a wide planet to motivate our simulations of this system. westudy the parameter space of the initial conditions to quantify the mass lossfrom the debris disk and its lifetime under the influence of the planet. wefind that when the planet orbits closer to the star than about 50 au and withlow inclination relative to the disk (less than about 10 degrees), more diskmaterial is perturbed outside than inside the region constrained byobservations on timescales shorter than 1 myr. considering the age of thesystem, such a short lifetime of the disk is incompatible with the timescalefor planet--planet scattering which is one of the scenarios suggested toexplain the wide separation of the planet. for some configurations when theplanet's orbit is inclined with respect to the disk, the latter will start towobble. we argue that this wobbling is caused by a mechanism similar to thekozai--lidov oscillations. we also observe various resonant structures (such asrings and spiral arms) induced in the disk by the planet.

1504.06354	the fragility of planetary systems	we specify the range to which perturbations penetrate a planetesimal system.such perturbations can originate from massive planets or from encounters withother stars. the latter can have an origin in the star cluster in which theplanetary system was born, or from random encounters once the planetary systemhas escaped its parental cluster. the probability of a random encounter, eitherin a star cluster or in the galactic field depends on the local stellardensity, the velocity dispersion and the time spend in that environment. byadopting order of magnitude estimates we argue that the majority of planetarysystems born in open clusters will have a {\em parking zone}, in whichplanetesimals are affected by encounters in their parental star cluster butremain unperturbed after the star has left the cluster. objects found in thisrange of semi-major axis and eccentricity preserve the memory of the encounterthat last affected their orbits, and they can therefore be used to reconstructthis encounter. planetary systems born in a denser environment, such as in aglobular cluster are unlikely to have a parking zone. we further argue thatsome planetary systems may have a {\em frozen zone}, in which orbits are notaffected either by the more inner massive planets or by external influences.objects discovered in this zone will have preserved information about theirformation in their orbital parameters.

1506.03105	how sedna and family were captured in a close encounter with a solar  sibling	the discovery of 2012vp113 initiated the debate on the origin of the sednafamily of planetesimals in orbit around the sun. sednitos roam the outerregions of the solar system between the egeworth--kuiper belt and the oortcloud, in extraordinary wide (a&gt;150au) orbits with a large perihelion distanceof q&gt;30au compared to the earth's (a=1au and eccentricity e=(1-q/a) ~ 0.0167 orq=1au). this population is composed of a dozen objects, which we consider afamily because they have similar perihelion distance and inclination withrespect to the ecliptic i=10--30deg. they also have similar argument ofperihelion omega=340+/-55deg. there is no ready explanation for their origin.here we show that these orbital parameters are typical for a capturedpopulation from the planetesimal disk of another star.assuming the orbitalelements of sednitos have not changed since they acquired their orbits, wereconstruct the encounter that led to their capture. we conclude that theymight have been captured in a near miss with a 1.8msun star that impacted thesun at ~340au at an inclination with respect to the ecliptic of 17--34deg witha relative velocity at infinity of ~4.3km/s. we predict that thesednitos-region is populated by 930 planetesimals and the inner oort cloudacquired ~440 planetesimals through the same encounter.

1507.01138	from thread to transcontinental computer: disturbing lessons in  distributed supercomputing	we describe the political and technical complications encountered during theastronomical cosmogrid project. cosmogrid is a numerical study on the formationof large scale structure in the universe. the simulations are challenging dueto the enormous dynamic range in spatial and temporal coordinates, as well asthe enormous computer resources required. in cosmogrid we dealt with thecomputational requirements by connecting up to four supercomputers via anoptical network and make them operate as a single machine. this waschallenging, if only for the fact that the supercomputers of our choice areseparated by half the planet, as three of them are located scattered acrosseurope and fourth one is in tokyo. the co-scheduling of multiple computers andthe 'gridification' of the code enabled us to achieve an efficiency of up to$93\%$ for this distributed intercontinental supercomputer. in this work, wefind that high-performance computing on a grid can be done much moreeffectively if the sites involved are willing to be flexible about their userpolicies, and that having facilities to provide such flexibility could be keyto strengthening the position of the hpc community in an increasinglycloud-dominated computing landscape. given that smaller computer clusters ownedby research groups or university departments usually have flexible userpolicies, we argue that it could be easier to instead realize distributedsupercomputing by combining tens, hundreds or even thousands of theseresources.

1511.06889	was the nineteenth century giant eruption of eta carinae a merger event  in a triple system?	we discuss the events that led to the giant eruption of eta carinae, and findthat the mid-nineteenth century (in 1838-1843) giant mass-loss outburst has thecharacteristics of being produced by the merger event of a massive closebinary, triggered by the gravitational interaction with a massive thirdcompanion star, which is the current binary companion in the eta carinaesystem. we come to this conclusion by a combination of theoretical argumentssupported by computer simulations using the astrophysical multipurpose softwareenvironment. according to this model the $\sim 90$\,\msun\, present primarystar of the highly eccentric eta carinae binary system is the product of thismerger, and its $\sim 30$\,\msun\, companion originally was the third star inthe system. in our model the homunculus nebula was produced by an extremelyenhanced stellar wind, energized by tidal energy dissipation prior to themerger, which enormously boosted the radiation-driven wind mass-loss. thecurrent orbital plane is then aligned with the equatorial plane of thehomunculus, and the symmetric lobes are roughly aligned with the argument ofperiastron of the current eta carina binary. the merger itself then occurred in1838, which resulted in a massive asymmetric outflow in the equatorial plane ofthe homunculus. the 1843 outburst can in our model be attributed to thesubsequent encounter when the companion star (once the outer most star in thetriple system) plunges through the bloated envelope of the merger product, oncewhen it passed periastron again. we predict that the system has an excess spacevelocity of order 50\,km/s in the equatorial plane of the homunculus. ourtriple model gives a viable explanation for the high runaway velocitiestypically observed in lbvs \citep{2015mnras.447..598s}.

1511.08900	stellar disk destruction by dynamical interactions in the orion  trapezium star cluster	we compare the observed size distribution of circum stellar disks in theorion trapezium cluster with the results of $n$-body simulations in which weincorporated an heuristic prescription for the evolution of these disks. in oursimulations, the sizes of stellar disks are affected by close encounters withother stars (with disks). we find that the observed distribution of disk sizesin the orion trapezium cluster is excellently reproduced by truncation due todynamical encounters alone. the observed distribution appears to be a sensitivemeasure of the past dynamical history of the cluster, and therewith on theconditions of the cluster at birth. the best comparison between the observeddisk size distribution and the simulated distribution is realized with acluster of $n = 2500\pm500$ stars with a half-mass radius of about 0.5\,pc invirial equilibrium (with a virial ratio of $q = 0.5$, or somewhat colder $q\simeq 0.3$), and with a density structure according to a fractal dimension of$f \simeq 1.6$. simulations with these parameters reproduce the observeddistribution of circum stellar disks in about 0.2--0.5\,myr.

1512.00090	the formation and dynamical evolution of young star clusters	recent observations have revealed a variety of young star clusters, includingembedded systems, young massive clusters, and associations. we study theformation and dynamical evolution of these clusters using a combination ofsimulations and theoretical models. our simulations start with a turbulentmolecular cloud that collapses under its own gravity. the stars are assumed toform in the densest regions in the collapsing cloud after an initial free-falltimes of the molecular cloud. the dynamical evolution of these stellardistributions are continued by means of direct $n$-body simulations. themolecular clouds typical for the milky way galaxy tend to form embeddedclusters which evolve to resemble open clusters. the associations wereinitially considerably more clumpy, but lost their irregularity in about adynamical time scale due to the relaxation process. the densest molecularclouds, which are absent in the milky way but are typical in starburstgalaxies, form massive young star clusters. they indeed are rare in the milkyway. our models indicate a distinct evolutionary path from molecular clouds toopen clusters and associations or to massive star clusters. the mass-radiusrelation for both types of evolutionary tracks excellently matches theobservations. according to our calculations the time evolution of the half-massradius for open clusters and associations follows $r_{\rm h}/{\rmpc}=2.7(t_{\rm age}/{\rm pc})^{2/3}$, whereas for massive star clusters $r_{\rmh}/{\rm pc}=0.34(t_{\rm age}/{\rm myr})^{2/3}$. both trends are consistent withthe observed age-mass-radius relation for clusters in the milky way.

1512.02682	the influence of dense gas rings on the dynamics of a stellar disk in  the galactic center	the galactic center hosts several hundred early-type stars, about 20% ofwhich lie in the so-called clockwise disk, while the remaining 80% do notbelong to any disks. the circumnuclear ring (cnr), a ring of molecular gas thatorbits the supermassive black hole (smbh) with a radius of 1.5 pc, has beenclaimed to induce precession and kozai-lidov oscillations onto the orbits ofstars in the innermost parsec. we investigate the perturbations exerted by agas ring on a nearly-keplerian stellar disk orbiting a smbh by means ofcombined direct n-body and smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. wesimulate the formation of gas rings through the infall and disruption of amolecular gas cloud, adopting different inclinations between the infalling gascloud and the stellar disk. we find that a cnr-like ring is not efficient inaffecting the stellar disk on a timescale of 3 myr. in contrast, a gas ring inthe innermost 0.5 pc induces precession of the longitude of the ascending nodeomega, significantly affecting the stellar disk inclination. furthermore, thecombined effect of two-body relaxation and omega-precession drives the stellardisk dismembering, displacing the stars from the disk. the impact of precessionon the star orbits is stronger when the stellar disk and the inner gas ring arenearly coplanar. we speculate that the warm gas in the inner cavity might haveplayed a major role in the evolution of the clockwise disk.

1512.03304	stellar winds near massive black holes: the case of the s-stars	the galactic center provides a unique laboratory to study the interaction ofa supermassive black hole (smbh) with its gaseous and stellar environment.simulations to determine the accretion of stellar winds from the surroundingo-stars onto the black hole have been performed earlier, but in those thepresence of the s-star system was ignored. the s-stars are a group of youngmassive b-stars in relatively close orbits around the black hole. here wesimulate those stars in order to study their contribution to the accretionrate, without taking the more distant and massive o-stars into account. we usethe astrophysical multi-purpose software environment (amuse) to combinegravitational physics, stellar evolution and hydrodynamics in a singlesimulation of the s-stars orbiting the supermassive black hole, and use thisframework to determine the amount of gas that is accreted onto the black hole.we find that the accretion rate is sensitive to the wind properties of thes-stars (rate of mass-loss and terminal velocity). our simulations areconsistent with the observed accretion rate of the black hole only if the starsexhibit high wind massloss rates that are comparable with those of evolved 7-10myr old stars with masses of m=19-25 m_sun. this is in contrast withobservations that have shown that these stars are rather young, main-sequenceb-stars. we therefore conclude that the s-stars cannot account for theaccretion rate alone.

astro-ph;0006143	precessing jets interacting with interstellar material as the origin for  the light curves of gamma-ray bursts	we present an internal shock model with external characteristics forexplaining the complicated light curves of gamma-ray bursts. shocks producegamma-rays in the interaction between a precessing beam of relativisticparticles and the interstellar medium. each time the particle beam passes thesame line of sight with the observer the inter stellar medium is pushedoutward. subsequent interactions between the medium and the beam are delayed bythe extra distance to be traveled for the particles before the shock can form.this results in a natural retardation and leads to an intrinsic asymmetry inthe produced light curves for gamma-ray bursts. in addition we account for thecooling of the electron-proton plasma in the shocked region, which gives riseto an exponential decay in the gamma-ray flux. the combination of these effectsand the precessing jet of ultra relativistic particles produces light curveswhich can be directly compared with observed gamma-ray burst light curves. weillustrate the model by fitting a number of observed gamma-ray bursts which arehard to explain with only a precessing jet. with a genetic algorithm we areable to fit several observed gamma-ray bursts with remarkable accuracy. we findthat for different bursts the observed fluence, assuming isotropic emission,easily varies over four orders of magnitude from the energy generatedintrinsically.

astro-ph;0106252	missing link found? --- the ``runaway'' path to supermassive black holes	observations of stellar kinematics, gas dynamics and masers around galacticnuclei have now firmly established that many galaxies host central supermassiveblack holes (smbhs) with masses in the range $10^6 \sim 10^9$m$_{\odot}$.however, how these smbhs formed is not well understood. one reason for thissituation is the lack of observations of intermediate-mass bhs (imbhs), whichcould bridge the gap between stellar-mass bhs and smbhs. recently, this missinglink (i.e., an imbh) has been found in observations made by the asca and thechandra of the central region of the starburst galaxy m82 \citep{mt99, pg99,mt01, ka01}. subsequent observations by subaru have revealed that this imbhapparently coincides with a young compact star cluster. based on thesefindings, we suggest a new formation scenario for smbhs. in this scenario,imbhs first form in young compact star clusters through runaway merging ofmassive stars. while these imbhs are forming, the host star clusters sinktoward the galactic nucleus through dynamical friction, and upon evaporationdeposit their imbhs near the galactic center. the imbhs then form binaries andeventually merge via gravitational radiation, forming an smbh.

astro-ph;0401451	n-body simulations of stars escaping from the orion nebula	we study the dynamical interaction in which the two single runaway stars aeaurigae and mu columbae and the binary iota orionis acquired their unusuallyhigh space velocity. the two single runaways move in almost opposite directionswith a velocity greater than 100 km/s away from the trapezium cluster. the stariota ori is an eccentric (e=0.8) binary moving with a velocity of about 10 km/sat almost right angles with respect to the two single stars. the kinematicproperties of the system suggest that a strong dynamical encounter occurred inthe trapezium cluster about 2.5 myr ago. curiously enough, the two binarycomponents have similar spectral type but very different masses, indicatingthat their ages must be quite different. this observation leads to thehypothesis that an exchange interaction occurred in which an older star wasswapped into the original iota orionis binary. we test this hypothesis by acombination of numerical and theoretical techniques, using n-body simulationsto constrain the dynamical encounter, binary evolution calculations toconstrain the high orbital eccentricity of iota orionis and stellar evolutioncalculations to constrain the age discrepancy of the two binary components. wefind that an encounter between two low eccentricity (0.4&lt;e&lt;0.6) binaries withcomparable binding energy, leading to an exchange and the ionization of thewider binary, provides a reasonable solution to this problem.

astro-ph;0402622	the formation of massive black holes through collision runaway in dense  young star clusters	a luminous x-ray source is associated with a cluster (mgg-11) of young stars\~200pc from the center of the starburst galaxy m82. the properties of thex-ray source are best explained by a black hole with a mass of at least350msun, which is intermediate between stellar-mass and supermassive blackholes. a nearby but somewhat more massive star cluster (mgg-9) shows noevidence of such an intermediate mass black hole, raising the issue of justwhat physical characteristics of the clusters can account for this difference.here we report numerical simulations of the evolution and the motions of starswithin the clusters, where stars are allowed to mergers with each other. wefind that for mgg-11 dynamical friction leads to the massive stars sinkingrapidly to the center of the cluster to participate in a runaway collision,thereby producing a star of 800-3000msun, which ultimately collapses to anblack hole of intermediate mass. no such runaway occurs in the cluster mgg-9because the larger cluster radius leads to a mass-segregation timescale afactor of five longer than for mgg-11.

astro-ph;0406128	an inverse problem approach to cluster dynamics	we propose a new non-parametric algorithm that can be implemented to studyand characterize stellar clusters. the scheme attempts to simultaneouslyrecover the stellar distribution function and the cluster potential by usingprojected radii and velocity information about the cluster members. the pair ofthese functions that is most consistent with the input data is detected by themetropolis algorithm. in this work, the cluster characteristics recovered bychassis are calibrated against the n-body realizations of two clusters, namelyhyades and arches. the cluster mass and line-of-sight projected velocitydispersion profiles are correctly reproduced by the algorithm when the clusterobeys the assumption used in the code, namely isotropy in phase space. theresults recovered by the code are shown to be insensitive to the choice of theinitial parameters. the results are also not influenced by increasing thenumber of input data points as long as this number exceeds a minimum valuewhich is moderately low for an input data set that obeys the assumptions ofisotropy and sphericity.

astro-ph;0408402	intermediate mass black holes in accreting binaries: formation,  evolution and observational appearance	we study the origin of the ultraluminous x-ray source m82-x1 in the nearbystarburst galaxy m82. this x-ray source is of particular interest as it iscurrently the best candidate intermediate mass black hole; it is associatedwith a 54mhz quasi periodic oscillations with a relatively low (~1kev)black-body temperature.  we perform detailed binary evolution calculations of 2--15msun stars whichtransfer mass to a 100--2000msun black hole and present an empirical model forthe x-ray characteristics expected for such binaries. based on the binaryevolution calculations and the assumption in our simulations we conclude thatthe most likely candidate for the bright x-ray source m82-x1 is a 10-15msunstar near the end of its main-sequence or slightly evolved, which transfersmass to a ~1000msun black hole. we expect the system to be in the high/softstate. in that case the binary will not be visible as a source of gravitationalwave radiation, but other transient x-ray binaries with lower mass donors waybe rather bright sources of gravitational wave radiation.

astro-ph;0410531	the gravitational wave signature of young and dense star clusters	young star clusters are often born with such high stellar densities thatstellar collisions play an important role in their further evolution. in suchenvironments the same star may participate in several tens to hundreds ofcollisions ultimately leading to the collapse of the star to a black hole ofintermediate mass. at later time the black hole may acquire a companion star bytidal capture or by dynamical --3-body-- capture. when this companion starevolves it will fill its roche-lobe and transfer mass to its accompanying blackhole. this then leads to a bright phase of x-ray emission but the binary mayalso be visible as a source of gravitational wave radiation in the lisa band.if the star captured by the intermediate mass black hole is relatively low mass($\aplt 2$ \msun) the binary will be visible as a bright source ingravitational waves and x-rays for the entire lifetime of the binary. themajority of compact binaries which formed from the population of primordialbinaries in young and dense star clusters do not lead to detectablegravitational wave sources.

astro-ph;0411188	simulating young star clusters with primordial binaries	we simulate a cluster of 144179 stars including 13107 primordial hardbinaries (10% of the total number of single stars and binary centers of mass),using direct integration of the equations of motion of all stars and binariesand incorporating the effects of stellar and binary evolution. the initialconditions are representative of young dense star clusters in the local groupand other nearby galaxies like the antennae and m82.  we find that the early phase of core collapse, driven by mass segregation, isnot appreciably delayed by the presence of a large number of hard binaries. bythe end of the simulation, at an age of 115myr, the cluster radius has expandedby about a factor of two. this may be explained as adiabatic expansion drivenby the loss (via stellar evolution) of about 40% of the initial total mass.binary dynamics apparently has little effect on the early cluster expansion.  during the evolution, the total binary fraction drops at a roughly constantrate of about 0.01% per myr. the fraction of very hard binaries, howeverincreases at about 0.025% per myr. by the end of the simulation the clustercontains 37 binaries containing at least one black hole; roughly half (17) ofthese contain two black holes.

astro-ph;0505558	an analytical description of the disruption of star clusters in tidal  fields with an application to galactic open clusters	we present a simple analytical description of the disruption of star clustersin a tidal field, which agrees excellently with detailed n-body simulations.the analytic expression can be used to predict the mass and age histograms ofsurviving clusters for any cluster initial mass function and any clusterformation history. the method is applied to open clusters in the solarneighbourhood, based on the new cluster sample of kharchenko et al. from acomparison between the observed and predicted age distributions in the agerange between 10 myr to 3 gyr we find the following results: (1) the disruptiontime of a 10^4 m_sun cluster in the solar neighbourhood is about 1.3+/-0.5 gyr.this is a factor 5 shorter than derived from n-body simulations of clusters inthe tidal field of the galaxy. (2) the present starformation rate in boundclusters within 600 pc from the sun is 5.9+/-0.8 * 10^2 m_sun / myr, whichcorresponds to a surface star formation rate in bound clusters of 5.2+/-0.710^(-10) m_sun/yr/pc^2. (3) the age distribution of open clusters shows a bumpbetween 0.26 and 0.6 gyr when the cluster formation rate was 2.5 times higherthan before and after. (4) the present star formation rate in bound clusters ishalf as small as that derived from the study of embedded clusters. thedifference suggests that half of the clusters in the solar neighbourhood becomeunbound within 10 myr. (5) the most massive clusters within 600 pc had aninitial mass of 3*10^4 m_sun. this is in agreement with the statisticallyexpected value based on a cluster initial mass function with a slope of -2,even if the physical upper mass limit is as high as 10^6 m_sun.

astro-ph;0511397	the ecology of star clusters and intermediate mass black holes in the  galactic bulge	we simulate the inner 100pc of the milky-way galaxy to study the formationand evolution of the population of star clusters and intermediate mass blackholes. for this study we perform extensive direct n-body simulations of thestar clusters which reside in the bulge, and of the inner few tenth of parsecsof the super massive black hole in the galactic center. in our n-bodysimulations the dynamical friction of the star cluster in the tidal field ofthe bulge are taken into account via (semi)analytic soluations. the n-bodycalculations are used to calibrate a (semi)analytic model of the formation andevolution of the bulge. we find that about 10% of the clusters born within100pc of the galactic center undergo core collapse during their inwardmigration and form intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs) via runaway stellarmerging. after the clusters dissolve, these imbhs continue their inward drift,carrying a few of the most massive stars with them. we predict that regionwithin about 10 parsec of the smbh is populated by about 50imbhs of some1000msun. several of these are expected to be accompanied still by some of themost massive stars from the star cluster. we also find that within a fewmilliparsec of the smbh there is a steady population of several imbhs. thispopulation drives the merger rate between imbhs and the smbh at a rate of aboutone per 10myr, sufficient to build the accumulate majority of mass of the smbh.mergers of imbhs with smbhs throughout the universe are detectable by lisa, ata rate of about two per week.

astro-ph;0512654	short gamma-ray bursts from binary neutron star mergers in globular  clusters	the first locations of short gamma-ray bursts (grbs) in elliptical galaxiessuggest they are produced by the mergers of double neutron star (dns) binariesin old stellar populations. globular clusters, where the extreme densities ofvery old stars in cluster cores create and exchange compact binariesefficiently, are a natural environment to produce merging nss. they also allowsome short grbs to be offset from their host galaxies, as opposed to dnssystems formed from massive binary stars which appear to remain in galacticdisks. starting with a simple scaling from the first dns observed in a galacticglobular, which will produce a short grb in ~300my, we present numericalsimulations which show that ~10-30% of short grbs may be produced in globularclusters vs. the much more numerous dns mergers and short grbs predicted forgalactic disks. reconciling the rates suggests the disk short grbs are morebeamed, perhaps by both the increased merger angular momentum from the dnsspin-orbit alignment (random for the dns systems in globulars) and a largermagnetic field on the secondary ns.

astro-ph;0603440	the redshift distribution of short gamma-ray bursts from dynamically  formed neutron star binaries	short-hard gamma-ray bursts (shbs) may arise from gravitational wave (gw)driven mergers of double neutron star (dns) systems. dnss may be "primordial"or can form dynamically by binary exchange interactions in globular clustersduring core-collapse. for primordial binaries, the time delay between formationand merger is expected to be short, tau~0.1 gyr, implying that the redshiftdistribution of merger events should follow that of star-formation. we pointout here that for dynamically formed dnss, the time delay betweenstar-formation and merger is dominated by the cluster core-collapse time,rather than by the gw inspiral time, yielding delays comparable to the hubbletime. we derive the redshift distribution of merger events of dynamicallyformed dnss, and find it to differ significantly from that typically expectedfor primordial binaries. the observed redshift distribution of shbs favorsdynamical formation, although a primordial origin cannot be ruled out due topossible detection biases. future red-shift observations of shbs may allow todetermine whether they are dominated by primordial or dynamically formed dnss.

astro-ph;0606492	diffuse, non-thermal x-ray emission from the galactic star cluster  westerlund 1	we present the diffuse x-ray emission identified in chandra observations ofthe young, massive galactic star cluster westerlund 1. after removingpoint-like x-ray sources down to a completeness limit of 2e31 erg/s, weidentify 3e34 erg/s (2--8 kev) of diffuse emission. the spatial distribution ofthe emission can be described as a slightly-elliptical lorentzian core with ahalf-width half-maximum along the major axis of 25+/-1", similar to thedistribution of point sources in the cluster, plus a 5' halo of extendedemission. the spectrum of the diffuse emission is dominated by a hard continuumcomponent that can be described as a kt&gt;3 kev thermal plasma that has a lowiron abundance (&lt;0.3 solar), or as non-thermal emission that could be stellarlight that is inverse-compton scattered by mev electrons. only 5% of the fluxis produced by a kt=0.7 kev plasma. the low luminosity of the thermal emissionand the lack of a 6.7 kev iron line suggests that &lt;40,000 unresolved stars withmasses between 0.3 and 2 msun are present in the cluster. moreover, the flux inthe diffuse emission is a factor of two lower than would be expected from asupersonically-expanding cluster wind, and there is no evidence for thermalremnants produced by supernovae. less than 1e-5 of the mechanical luminosity ofthe cluster is dissipated as 2--8 kev x-rays, leaving a large amount of energythat either is radiated at other wavelengths, is dissipated beyond the boundsof our image, or escapes into the intergalactic medium.

astro-ph;0607455	ejection of hyper-velocity stars from the galactic centre by  intermediate-mass black holes	we have performed n-body simulations of the formation of hyper-velocity stars(hvs) in the centre of the milky way due to inspiralling intermediate-massblack holes (imbhs). we considered imbhs of different masses, all starting fromcircular orbits at an initial distance of 0.1 pc.  we find that the imbhs sink to the centre of the galaxy due to dynamicalfriction, where they deplete the central cusp of stars. some of these starsbecome hvs and are ejected with velocities sufficiently high to escape thegalaxy. since the hvs carry with them information about their origin, inparticular in the moment of ejection, the velocity distribution and thedirection in which they escape the galaxy, detecting a population of hvs willprovide insight in the ejection processes and could therefore provide indirectevidence for the existence of imbhs.  our simulations show that hvs are generated in short bursts which last only afew myrs until the imbh is swallowed by the supermassive black hole (smbh). hvsare ejected almost isotropically, which makes imbh induced ejections hard todistinguish from ejections due to encounters of stellar binaries with a smbh.after the hvs have reached the galactic halo, their escape velocities correlatewith the distance from the galactic centre in the sense that the fastest hvscan be found furthest away from the centre. the velocity distribution of hvsgenerated by inspiralling imbhs is also nearly independent of the mass of theimbh and can be quite distinct from one generated by binary encounters.  finally, our simulations show that the presence of an imbh in the galacticcentre changes the stellar density distribution inside r&lt;0.02 pc into a coreprofile, which takes at least 100 myrs to replenish.

astro-ph;0609061	the evolution of binary star clusters and the nature of ngc2136/ngc2137	we study the evolution of bound pairs of star clusters by means of directn-body simulations. our simulations include mass loss by stellar evolution. theinitial conditions are selected to mimic the observed binary star cluster ngc2136 and ngc 2137 in the large magellanic cloud. based on the rather old ages($\sim 100$ myr), masses, sizes of the two clusters and their projectedseparation, we conclude that the cluster pair must have been born with aninitial separation of 15--20 pc. clusters with a smaller initial separationtend to merge in $\aplt 60$ myr due to loss of angular momentum from escapingstars. clusters with a larger initial separation tend to become even morewidely separated due to mass loss from the evolving stellar populations. theearly orbital evolution of a binary cluster is governed by mass loss from theevolving stellar population and by loss of angular momentum from escapingstars. mass loss by stellar winds and supernovae explosions in the first $\sim30$ myr causes the binary to expand and the orbit to become eccentric. theinitially less massive cluster expands more quickly than the binary separationincreases, and is therefore bound to initiate mass transfer to the more massivecluster. this process is quite contrary to stellar binaries in which the moremassive star tends to initiate mass transfer. since mass transfer proceeds on athermal timescale from the less massive to the more massive cluster, thissemi-detached phase is quite stable, even in an eccentric orbit until theorbital separation reaches the gyration radius of the two clusters, at whichpoint both clusters merge to one.

astro-ph;9812006	star cluster ecology iii: runaway collisions in young compact star  clusters	the evolution of young compact star clusters is studied using n-bodysimulations in which both stellar evolution and physical collisions betweenstars are taken into account. the initial conditions are chosen to representr136, a compact star cluster in the 30 doradus region of the large magellaniccloud. the present runs do not include the effects of primordial binaries. wefind that physical collisions between stars in these models are frequent, andthat the evolution of the most massive stars and the dynamical evolution of thecluster are closely coupled. in all cases, a single star grows steadily in massthrough mergers with other stars, forming a very massive (&gt;100 msun) star inless than 3-4 myr. the growth rate of this runaway merger is much larger thanestimates based on simple cross-section arguments, mainly because the star istypically found in the core and tends to form binaries with other massive starsthere. the runaway is ``rejuvenated'' by each new collision, and its lifetimeis extended considerably as a consequence. observationally, such a star willappear in the hertzsprung-russell diagram as a blue straggler. when the runawayforms a black hole, the binary in which it is found is usually dissociated.

astro-ph;9902181	the origin of single radio pulsars	by comparing relative rates of supernovae versus formation rates of singleradio pulsars, recycled pulsars, binary pulsars and x-ray binaries we putstrong limits on the progenitors of radio pulsars and on the requirement of anasymmetry in the supernova. the assumption that radio pulsars are only formedin type ib and type ic supernovae from interacting binaries (iben &amp; tutukov1996) breaks down on the implication that in that case either the formationrate of binary pulsars (double neutron stars) should be of the order of 20%, ofthe single pulsar birthrate or, alternatively, almost all single pulsars (85%to 98%) should originate from thorne-zytkow stars. in the latter case thepulsar velocity distribution is inconsistent with observations. also, in thatcase the difference between the supernova rate and the pulsar formation ratewould be about one order of magnitude, i.e.: much larger than observed.  allowing type ii supernovae from single stars and non-interacting binaries toform radio pulsars solves this conundrum, but then a kick is required in orderto explain the high velocities of single radio pulsars. a kick is also requiredto understand the small birthrate, relative to the supernova rate, of binarypulsars consisting of two neutron stars.

astro-ph;9909115	monte-carlo simulations of globular cluster evolution - i. method and  test calculations	we present a new parallel supercomputer implementation of the monte-carlomethod for simulating the dynamical evolution of globular star clusters. ourmethod is based on a modified version of henon's monte-carlo algorithm forsolving the fokker-planck equation. our code allows us to follow the evolutionof a cluster containing up to 5x10^5 stars to core collapse in &lt; 40 hours ofcomputing time. in this paper we present the results of test calculations forclusters with equal-mass stars, starting from both plummer and king modelinitial conditions. we consider isolated as well as tidally truncated clusters.our results are compared to those obtained from approximate, self-similaranalytic solutions, from direct numerical integrations of the fokker-planckequation, and from direct n-body integrations performed on a grape-4special-purpose computer with n=16384. in all cases we find excellent agreementwith other methods, establishing our new code as a robust tool for thenumerical study of globular cluster dynamics using a realistic number of stars.

cs;0702135	high performance direct gravitational n-body simulations on graphics  processing units	we present the results of gravitational direct $n$-body simulations using thecommercial graphics processing units (gpu) nvidia quadro fx1400 and geforce8800gtx, and compare the results with grape-6af special purpose hardware. theforce evaluation of the $n$-body problem was implemented in cg using the gpudirectly to speed-up the calculations. the integration of the equations ofmotions were, running on the host computer, implemented in c using the 4thorder predictor-corrector hermite integrator with block time steps. we findthat for a large number of particles ($n \apgt 10^4$) modern graphicsprocessing units offer an attractive low cost alternative to grape specialpurpose hardware. a modern gpu continues to give a relatively flat scaling withthe number of particles, comparable to that of the grape. using the same timestep criterion the total energy of the $n$-body system was conserved betterthan to one in $10^6$ on the gpu, which is only about an order of magnitudeworse than obtained with grape. for $n\apgt 10^6$ the geforce 8800gtx was about20 times faster than the host computer. though still about an order ofmagnitude slower than grape, modern gpu's outperform grape in their low cost,long mean time between failure and the much larger onboard memory; thegrape-6af holds at most 256k particles whereas the geforce 8800gtf can hold 9million particles in memory.
