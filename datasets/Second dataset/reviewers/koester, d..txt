0903.1499	accretion and diffusion in white dwarfs. new diffusion timescales and  applications to gd362 and g29-38	a number of cool white dwarfs with metal traces, of spectral types daz, dbz,and dz have been found to exhibit infrared excess radiation due tocircumstellar dust. the origin of this dust is possibly a tidally disruptedasteroid that formed a debris disk now supplying the matter accreting onto thewhite dwarf. to reach any clear conclusions from the observed composition ofthe white dwarf atmosphere to that of the circumstellar matter, we need adetailed understanding of the accretion and diffusion process, in particularthe diffusion timescales. we aim to provide data for a wide range of whitedwarf parameters and all possible observed chemical elements. starting fromatmosphere models, we calculate the structure of the outer envelopes, obtainingthe depth of the convection zone and the physical parameters at the lowerboundary. these parameters are used to calculate the diffusion velocities usingcalculations of diffusion coefficients available in the literature. with asimple example, we demonstrate that the observed element abundances are notidentical to the accreted abundances. reliable conclusions are possible only ifwe know or can assume that the star has reached a steady state betweenaccretion and diffusion. in this case, most element abundances differ only byfactors in the range 2-4 between atmospheric values and the circumstellarmatter. knowing the diffusion timescales, we can also accurately relate theaccreted abundances to the observed ones. if accretion has stopped, or if therates vary by large amounts, we cannot determine the composition of theaccreted matter with any certainty.

0706.2936	high-resolution spectra observed for spy. ii. db and dba stars	we present a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the stars withhelium-dominated spectra in the eso supernova ia progenitor survey (spy).atmospheric parameters, masses, and abundances of trace hydrogen are determinedand discussed in the context of spectral evolution of white dwarfs. our finalsample contains 71 objects, of which 6 are new detections and 14 arereclassified from db to dba because of the presence of h lines. 55% of the dbsample show hydrogen and are thus dba, a significantly higher fraction thanfound before. the large incidence of dba, and the derived total hydrogen massesare compatible with the scenario that dbs ``reappear'' around 30000 k from thedb gap by mixing and diluting a thin hydrogen layer of the order of e-15 msun.this hydrogen mass is then during the evolution continuously increased byinterstellar accretion. there are indications that the accretion rate increasessmoothly with age or decreasing temperature, a trend which continuous evenbelow the current low temperature limit (dufour 2006). a remaining mystery isthe low accretion rate of h compared to that of ca observed in the dbza, but astellar wind extending down to the lowest temperatures with decreasing strengthmight be part of the solution.

1004.3579	evidence for temperature change and oblique pulsation from light curve  fits of the pulsating white dwarf gd 358	convective driving, the mechanism originally proposed by brickhill (1991,1983) for pulsating white dwarf stars, has gained general acceptance as thegeneric linear instability mechanism in dav and dbv white dwarfs. this physicalmechanism naturally leads to a nonlinear formulation, reproducing the observedlight curves of many pulsating white dwarfs. this numerical model can alsoprovide information on the average depth of a star's convection zone and theinclination angle of its pulsation axis. in this paper, we give two sets ofresults of nonlinear light curve fits to data on the dbv gd 358. our first fitis based on data gathered in 2006 by the whole earth telescope (wet); this dataset was multiperiodic, containing at least 12 individual modes. our second fitutilizes data obtained in 1996, when gd 358 underwent a dramatic change inexcited frequencies accompanied by a rapid increase in fractional amplitude;during this event it was essentially monoperiodic. we argue that gd 358'sconvection zone was much thinner in 1996 than in 2006, and we interpret this asa result of a short-lived increase in its surface temperature. in addition, wefind strong evidence of oblique pulsation using two sets of evenly splittriplets in the 2006 data. this marks the first time that oblique pulsation hasbeen identified in a variable white dwarf star.

1112.5163	a trio of metal-rich dust and gas disks found orbiting candidate white  dwarfs with k-band excess	this paper reports follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations,including warm spitzer irac photometry of seven white dwarfs from the sdss withapparent excess flux in ukidss k-band observations. six of the science targetswere selected from 16,785 da star candidates identified eitherspectroscopically or photometrically within sdss dr7, spatiallycross-correlated with hk detections in ukidss dr8. thus the selection criteriaare completely independent of stellar mass, effective temperature above 8000 k,and the presence (or absence) of atmospheric metals. the infrared fluxes of onetarget are compatible with a spatially-unresolved late m or early l-typecompanion, while three stars exhibit excess emissions consistent with warmcircumstellar dust. these latter targets have spectral energy distributionssimilar to known dusty white dwarfs with high fractional infrared luminosities(thus the k-band excesses). optical spectroscopy reveals the stars withdisk-like excesses are polluted with heavy elements, denoting the ongoingaccretion of circumstellar material. one of the disks exhibits a gaseouscomponent - the fourth reported to date - and orbits a relatively cool star,indicating the gas is produced via collisions as opposed to sublimation,supporting the picture of a recent event. the resulting statistics yield alower limit of 0.8% for the fraction dust disks at da-type white dwarfs withcooling ages less than 1 gyr. two overall results are noteworthy: all starswhose excess infrared emission is consistent with dust are metal-rich; and nostars warmer than 25,000 k are found to have this type of excess, despitesufficient sensitivity.

1202.3784	constraints on the lifetimes of disks resulting from tidally destroyed  rocky planetary bodies	spitzer irac observations of 15 metal-polluted white dwarfs reveal infraredexcesses in the spectral energy distributions of he 0110-5630, gd 61, and he1349-2305. all three of these stars have helium-dominated atmospheres, andtheir infrared emissions are consistent with warm dust produced by the tidaldestruction of (minor) planetary bodies. this study brings the number ofmetal-polluted, helium and hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs surveyed with iracto 53 and 38 respectively. it also nearly doubles the number of metal-pollutedhelium-rich white dwarfs found to have closely orbiting dust by spitzer. fromthe increased statistics for both atmospheric types with circumstellar dust, wederive a typical disk lifetime of log[t_{disk} (yr)] = 5.6+-1.1 (ranging from3*10^4 - 5*10^6 yr). this assumes a relatively constant rate of accretion overthe timescale where dust persists, which is uncertain. we find that thefraction of highly metal-polluted helium-rich white dwarfs that have aninfrared excess detected by spitzer is only 23 per cent, compared to 48 percent for metal-polluted hydrogen-rich white dwarfs, and we conclude from thisdifference that the typical lifetime of dusty disks is somewhat shorter thanthe diffusion time scales of helium-rich white dwarf. we also find evidence forhigher time-averaged accretion rates onto helium-rich stars compared to theinstantaneous accretion rates onto hydrogen-rich stars; this is an indicationthat our picture of evolved star-planetary system interactions is incomplete.we discuss some speculative scenarios that can explain the observations.

1202.5553	mass ratio from doppler beaming and r{\o}mer delay versus ellipsoidal  modulation in the kepler data of koi-74	we present a light curve analysis and radial velocity study of koi-74, aneclipsing a star + white dwarf binary with a 5.2 day orbit. aside from newspectroscopy covering the orbit of the system, we used 212 days of publiclyavailable kepler observations and present the first complete light curvefitting to these data, modelling the eclipses and transits, ellipsoidalmodulation, reflection, and doppler beaming. markov chain monte carlosimulations are used to determine the system parameters and uncertaintyestimates. our results are in agreement with earlier studies, except that wefind an inclination of 87.0 \pm 0.4\degree, which is significantly lower thanthe previously published value. we find that the mass ratio derived from theradial velocity amplitude (q=0.104 \pm 0.004) disagrees with that derived fromthe ellipsoidal modulation (q=0.052 \pm 0.004} assuming corotation). this wasfound before, but with our smaller inclination, the discrepancy is even largerthan previously reported. accounting for the rapid rotation of the a-star isfound to increase the discrepancy even further by lowering the mass ratio toq=0.047 \pm 0.004. these results indicate that one has to be extremely carefulin using the amplitude of an ellipsoidal modulation signal in a close binary todetermine the mass ratio, when a proof of corotation is not firmly established.the radial velocities that can be inferred from the detected doppler beaming inthe light curve are found to be in agreement with our spectroscopic radialvelocity determination. we also report the first measurement of r{\o}mer delayin a light curve of a compact binary. this delay amounts to -56 \pm 17 s and isconsistent with the mass ratio derived from the radial velocity amplitude. thefirm establishment of this mass ratio at q=0.104 \pm 0.004 leaves little doubtthat the companion of koi-74 is a low mass white dwarf.

1203.1208	post-common envelope binaries from sdss - xvi. long orbital period  systems and the energy budget of ce evolution	virtually all close compact binary stars are formed through common-envelope(ce) evolution. it is generally accepted that during this crucial evolutionaryphase a fraction of the orbital energy is used to expel the envelope. however,it is unclear whether additional sources of energy, such as the recombinationenergy of the envelope, play an important role. here we report the discovery ofthe second and third longest orbital period post-common envelope binaries(pcebs) containing white dwarf (wd) primaries, i.e. sdssj121130.94-024954.4(porb = 7.818 +- 0.002 days) and sdssj222108.45+002927.7 (porb = 9.588 +- 0.002days), reconstruct their evolutionary history, and discuss the implications forthe energy budget of ce evolution. we find that, despite their long orbitalperiods, the evolution of both systems can still be understood withoutincorporating recombination energy, although at least small contributions ofthis additional energy seem to be likely. if recombination energy significantlycontributes to the ejection of the envelope, more pcebs with relatively longorbital periods (porb &gt;~ 1-3 day) harboring massive wds (mwd &gt;~ 0.8 msun)should exist.

1503.05618	da white dwarfs from the lss-gac survey dr1: the preliminary luminosity  and mass functions and formation rate	modern large-scale surveys have allowed the identification of large numbersof white dwarfs. however, these surveys are subject to complicated targetselection algorithms, which make it almost impossible to quantify to whatextent the observational biases affect the observed populations. the lamost(large sky area multi-object fiber spectroscopic telescope) spectroscopicsurvey of the galactic anti-center (lss-gac) follows a well-defined set ofcriteria for selecting targets for observations. this advantage over previoussurveys has been fully exploited here to identify a small yetwell-characterised magnitude-limited sample of hydrogen-rich (da) white dwarfs.we derive preliminary lss-gac da white dwarf luminosity and mass functions. thespace density and average formation rate of da white dwarfs we derive are0.83+/-0.16 x 10^{-3} pc^{-3} and 5.42 +/- 0.08 x 10^{-13} pc^{-3} yr^{-1},respectively. additionally, using an existing monte carlo population synthesiscode we simulate the population of single da white dwarfs in the galacticanti-center, under various assumptions. the synthetic populations are passedthrough the lss-gac selection criteria, taking into account all possibleobservational biases. this allows us to perform a meaningful comparison of theobserved and simulated distributions. we find that the lss-gac set of criteriais highly efficient in selecting white dwarfs for spectroscopic observations(80-85 per cent) and that, overall, our simulations reproduce well the observedluminosity function. however, they fail at reproducing an excess of massivewhite dwarfs present in the observed mass function. a plausible explanation forthis is that a sizable fraction of massive white dwarfs in the galaxy are theproduct of white dwarf-white dwarf mergers.

1507.04663	total eclipse of the heart: the am cvn gaia14aae / assasn-14cn	we report the discovery and characterisation of a deeply eclipsing amcvn-system, gaia14aae (= assasn-14cn). gaia14aae was identified independentlyby the all-sky automated survey for supernovae (asas-sn; shappee et al. 2014)and by the gaia science alerts project, during two separate outbursts. a thirdoutburst is seen in archival pan-starrs-1 (ps1; schlafly et al. 2012; tonry etal. 2012; magnier et al. 2013) and asas-sn data. spectroscopy reveals a hot,hydrogen-deficient spectrum with clear double-peaked emission lines, consistentwith an accreting double degenerate classification. we use follow-up photometryto constrain the orbital parameters of the system. we find an orbital period of49.71 min, which places gaia14aae at the long period extremum of theoutbursting am cvn period distribution. gaia14aae is dominated by the lightfrom its accreting white dwarf. assuming an orbital inclination of 90 degreesfor the binary system, the contact phases of the white dwarf lead to lowerlimits of 0.78 m solar and 0.015 m solar on the masses of the accretor anddonor respectively and a lower limit on the mass ratio of 0.019. gaia14aae isonly the third eclipsing am cvn star known, and the first in which the wd istotally eclipsed. using a helium wd model, we estimate the accretor's effectivetemperature to be 12900+-200 k. the three out-burst events occurred within 4months of each other, while no other outburst activity is seen in the previous8 years of catalina real-time transient survey (crts; drake et al. 2009),pan-starrs-1 and asas-sn data. this suggests that these events might berebrightenings of the first outburst rather than individual events.

astro-ph;0303563	high resolution spectroscopy of the pulsating white dwarf g29-38	we present the analysis of time-resolved, high resolution spectra of the coolwhite dwarf pulsator, g29-38. from measuring the doppler shifts of the h-alphacore, we detect velocity changes as large as 16.5 km/s and conclude that theyare due to the horizontal motions associated with the g-mode pulsations on thestar. we detect seven pulsation modes from the velocity time-series andidentify the same modes in the flux variations. we discuss the properties ofthese modes and use the advantage of having both velocity and flux measurementsof the pulsations to test the convective driving theory proposed for dav stars.our data show limited agreement with the expected relationships between theamplitude and phases of the velocity and flux modes. unexpectedly, the velocitycurve shows evidence for harmonic distortion, in the form of a peak in thefourier transform whose frequency is the exact sum of the two largestfrequencies. combination frequencies are a characteristic feature of thefourier transforms of light curves of g29-38, but before now have not beendetected in the velocities, nor does published theory predict that they shouldexist. we compare our velocity combination frequency to combination frequenciesfound in the analysis of light curves of g29-38, and discuss what might accountfor the existence of velocity combinations with the properties we observe.  we also use our high-resolution spectra to determine if either rotation orpulsation can explain the truncated shape observed for the dav star's linecore. we are able to eliminate both mechanisms: the average spectrum does notfit the rotationally broadened model and the time-series of spectra providesproof that the pulsations do not significantly truncate the line.

astro-ph;0403245	spectral types and masses of white dwarfs in globular clusters	white dwarfs in globular clusters offer additional possibilities to determinedistances and ages of globular clusters, provided their spectral types andmasses are known. we therefore started a project to obtain spectra of whitedwarfs in the globular clusters ngc 6397 and ngc 6752. all observed whitedwarfs show hydrogen-rich spectra and are therefore classified as da. analysingthe multi-colour photometry of the white dwarfs in ngc 6752 yields an averagegravity of log g = 7.84 and 0.53 msolar as the most probable average mass forglobular cluster white dwarfs. using this average gravity we try to determineindependent temperatures by fitting the white dwarf spectra. while the stellarparameters determined from spectroscopy and photometry usually agree within themutual error bars, the low resolution and s/n of the spectra prevent us fromsetting constraints stronger than the ones derived from the photometry alone.for the same reasons the white dwarf spectra obtained for ngc 6397unfortunately do not provide an independent distance estimate of sufficientaccuracy to distinguish between the long and short distance scale for globularclusters.

astro-ph;9604104	discovery of four white dwarfs with strong magnetic fields by the  hamburg/eso survey	four magnetic white dwarfs have been found in the course of the hamburg/esosurvey for bright qsos. the objects have been selected as qso candidate on thebasis of its blue continuum and the apparent absence of strong hydrogen orhelium lines. one star, he1211-1707, shows a rather fast spectral variability:both the strength and the position of the shallow absorption features change ona time scale of 20 minutes. we interpret this variability as being due to amagnetic field on the surface of a rotating white dwarf, having a relativelyuniform magnetic field on one hemisphere and a much larger spread of fieldstrengths visible during other phases of the rotational period. all attempts todetermine the magnetic field structure in detail with the help of syntheticspectra have failed so far because the star must have a rather complicatedfield geometry. however, both the optical and the uv spectra indicate that asignificant part of the surface is dominated by a magnetic field strength ofabout 80 mg. the spectrum of he 0127-3110 is also rotationally modulated. thisstar (approximate range of magnetic fields: 85-345 mg) as well as he 2201-2250(a spectroscopic twin of he 0127-3110) and he 0000-3430 (43-118 mg) could bereasonably well reproduced with the help of theoretical spectra calculatedassuming magnetic dipoles which are offset by 0.1 and 0.2 stellar radii alongthe magnetic axis. this result is in agreement with the assumption that apstars, also showing significant deviations from a centered dipole, are theprogenitors of magnetic white dwarfs.

(1993 &amp; 1995) value. this sightline appears consequentlyas a good candidate for a low d/h_ism.

0812.2510	post common envelope binaries from sdss. v: four eclipsing white dwarf  main sequence binaries	we identify sdss011009.09+132616.1, sdss030308.35+005444.1,sdss143547.87+373338.5 and sdss154846.00+405728.8 as four eclipsing white dwarfplus main sequence (wdms) binaries from the sloan digital sky survey, andreport on follow-up observations of these systems. orbital periods andephemerides have been established from multi-season photometry. sdss1435+3733,with porb=3h has the shortest orbital period of all known eclipsing wdmsbinaries. time-resolved spectroscopic observations have been obtained and theradial velocities of the secondary stars in all four systems were measured. aspectral decomposition/fitting technique was then employed to determine thewhite dwarf effective temperatures and surface gravities, as well as thespectral types of the companion stars. we used a light curve modeling code tofurther constrain the masses and radii of the components in all systems. allthree da white dwarfs have masses of mwd~0.4-0.6msun, in line with theexpectations from close binary evolution. the dc white dwarf in sdss0303+0054has a mass of mwd&gt;0.85msun, making it unusually massive for a post-commonenvelope system. our new additions raise the number of known eclipsing wdmsbinaries to fourteen, and we find that the average white dwarf mass in thissample is &lt;mwd&gt;=0.57+/-0.16msun, only slightly lower than the average mass ofsingle white dwarfs. the majority of all eclipsing wdms binaries containlow-mass (&lt;0.6msun) secondary stars, and will eventually provide valuableobservational input for the calibration of the mass-radius relations oflow-mass main sequence stars and of white dwarfs.
