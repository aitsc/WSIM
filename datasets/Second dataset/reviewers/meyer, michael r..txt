0903.3141	the young active star sao 51891 (v383 lac)	our aim is investigating surface inhomogeneities of the young late-type starsao51891, from photosphere to upper chromosphere, analyzing contemporaneoushigh-resolution spectra and broad-band photometry. the foces@caha spectralrange is used to determine spectral classification and derive vsini and vrad.the li abundance is measured to estimate the age. the bvrijhks bands are usedto construct the sed. the variations of our bv fluxes and teff are used toinfer the presence of photospheric spots and observe their behavior over time.the chromospheric activity is studied applying the spectral subtractiontechnique to halpha, caii h&amp;k, heps, and caii irt lines. we find sao51891 to bea young k0-1v star with li abundance close to the pleiades upper envelope,confirming its youth (~100 myr), also inferred from its kinematical membershipto the local association. we detect no ir excess from sed analysis, androtational modulation of luminosity, teff, caii, and heps total fluxes. a spotmodel with two active regions, ~240 k cooler than the surrounding photosphere,fits our light/teff curves, and reproduces the small-amplitude vrad variations.the anti-correlation of light curves and chromospheric diagnostics indicatesplages spatially associated with spots. the large amplitude observed in theheps-flux curve suggests that this line is very sensitive to the plagepresence. finally, sao51891 is a young active star, lacking significant amountsof circumstellar dust or any evidence for low mass companions. the spots turnout to be larger and warmer than those in less active ms stars. the vradvariation produced by spots has an amplitude comparable with those induced byjupiter-mass planets orbiting close to the star. sao51891 is a good example ofstar where the detection of planets may be hampered by the high activity level.

0903.3801	anachronistic grain growth and global structure of the protoplanetary  disk associated with the mature classical t tauri star, pds 66	we present atca interferometric observations of the old (13 myr), nearby(86pc) classical t tauri star, pds 66. unresolved 3 and 12 mm continuumemission is detected towards pds 66, and upper limits are derived for the 3 and6 cm flux densities. the mm-wave data show a spectral slope flatter than thatexpected for ism-sized dust particles, which is evidence of grain growth. wealso present hst/nicmos 1.1 micron psf-subtracted coronagraphic imaging of pds66. the hst observations reveal a bilaterally symmetric circumstellar region ofdust scattering about 0.32% of the central starlight, declining radially insurface brightness. the light-scattering disk of material is inclined 32degrees from face-on, and extends to a radius of 170 au. these data arecombined with published optical and longer wavelength observations to makequalitative comparisons between the median taurus and pds 66 spectral energydistributions (seds). by comparing the near-infrared emission to a simplemodel, we determine that the location of the inner disk radius is consistentwith the dust sublimation radius (1400 k at 0.1 au). we place constraints onthe total disk mass using a flat-disk model and find that it is probably toolow to form gas giant planets according to current models. despite the factthat pds 66 is much older than a typical classical t tauri star (&lt; 5 myr), itsphysical properties are not much different.

0907.2931	on the emergent spectra of hot protoplanet collision afterglows	we explore the appearance of terrestrial planets in formation by studying theemergent spectra of hot molten protoplanets during their collisional formation.while such collisions are rare, the surfaces of these bodies may remain hot attemperatures of 1000-3000 k for up to millions of years during the epoch oftheir formation. these object are luminous enough in the thermal infrared to beobservable with current and next generation optical/ir telescopes, providedthat the atmosphere of the forming planet permits astronomers to observebrightness temperatures approaching that of the molten surface. detectabilityof a collisional afterglow depends on properties of the planet's atmosphere --primarily on the mass of the atmosphere. a planet with a thin atmosphere ismore readily detected, because there is little atmosphere to obscure the hotsurface. paradoxically, a more massive atmosphere prevents one from easilyseeing the hot surface, but also keeps the planet hot for a longer time. interms of planetary mass, more massive planets are also easier to detect thansmaller ones because of their larger emitting surface areas. we presentpreliminary calculations assuming a range of protoplanet masses (1-10$m_\earth$), surface pressures (1-1000 bar), and atmospheric compositions, formolten planets with surface temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1800 k, in orderto explore the diversity of emergent spectra that are detectable. while current8- to 10-m class ground-based telescopes may detect hot protoplanets at wideorbital separations beyond 30 au (if they exist), we will likely have to waitfor next-generation extremely large telescopes or improved diffractionsuppression techniques to find terrestrial planets in formation within severalau of their host stars.

0909.4124	debris disks in the upper scorpius ob association	we present mips 24um and 70um photometry for 205 members of the upperscorpius ob association. these data are combined with published mips photometryfor 15 additional association members to assess the frequency of circumstellardisks around 5 myr old stars with spectral types between b0 and m5. twelvestars have a detectable 70um excess, each of which also has a detectable 24umexcess. a total of 54 stars are identified with a 24um excess more than 32%above the stellar photosphere. the mips observations reveal 19 excess sources-- 8 a/f/g stars and 11 k/m stars -- that were not previously identified withan 8um or 16um excess. the lack of short-wavelength emission and the weak 24umexcess suggests that these sources are debris systems or the remnants ofoptically thick primordial disks with inner holes. despite the wide range ofluminosities of the stars hosting apparent debris systems, the excesscharacteristics are consistent with all stars having dust at similar orbitalradii after factoring in variations in the radiation blowout particle size withspectral type. the results for upper sco are compared to similar photometricsurveys from the literature to re-evaluate the evolution of debris emission.after considering the completeness limits of published surveys and the effectsof stellar evolution on the debris luminosity, we find that the magnitude ofthe 24um excess around f-type stars increases between ages of 5 and 17 myr asfound by previous studies, but at &lt; 2.6 sigma confidence. for b7-a9 and g0-k5stars, any variations in the observed 24um excess emission over this age rangeare significant at less than 2 sigma confidence.

0911.5028	discovery of a faint companion to alcor using mmt/ao 5 $\mu$m imaging	we report the detection of a faint stellar companion to the famous nearby a5vstar alcor (80 uma). the companion has m-band ($\lambda$ = 4.8 $\mu$m)magnitude 8.8 and projected separation 1".11 (28 au) from alcor. the companionis most likely a low-mass ($\sim$0.3 \msun) active star which is responsiblefor alcor's x-ray emission detected by rosat (l$_{\rm x}$ $\simeq$ 10$^{28.3}$erg/s). alcor is a nuclear member of the ursa major star cluster (uma; d$\simeq$ 25 pc, age $\simeq$ 0.5 gyr), and has been occasionally mentioned as apossible distant (709") companion of the stellar quadruple mizar ($\zeta$ uma).comparing the revised hipparcos proper motion for alcor with the mean motionfor other uma nuclear members shows that alcor has a peculiar velocity of 1.1km/s, which is comparable to the predicted velocity amplitude induced by thenewly-discovered companion ($\sim$1 km/s). using a precise dynamical parallaxfor mizar and the revised hipparcos parallax for alcor, we find that mizar andalcor are physically separated by 0.36 $\pm$ 0.19 pc (74 $\pm$ 39 kau; minimum18 kau), and their velocity vectors are marginally consistent ($\chi^2$probability 6%). given their close proximity and concordant motions we suggestthat the mizar quadruple and the alcor binary be together considered the 2ndclosest stellar sextuplet. the addition of mizar-alcor to the census of stellarmultiples with six or more components effectively doubles the local density ofsuch systems within the local volume (d $&lt;$ 40 pc).

1001.1964	star formation history of a young super-star cluster in ngc 4038/39:  direct detection of low mass pre-main sequence stars	we present an analysis of the near-infrared spectrum of a young massive starcluster in the overlap region of the interacting galaxies ngc 4038/39 usingpopulation synthesis models. our goal is to model the cluster population aswell as provide rough constraints on its initial mass function (imf). thecluster shows signs of youth such as thermal radio emission and strong hydrogenemission lines in the near-infrared. late-type absorption lines are alsopresent which are indicative of late-type stars in the cluster. the strengthand ratio of these absorption lines cannot be reproduced through eitherlate-type pre-main sequence (pms) stars or red supergiants alone. thus weinterpret the spectrum as a superposition of two star clusters of differentages, which is feasible since the 1" spectrum encompasses a physical region of~90 pc and radii of super-star clusters are generally measured to be a fewparsecs. one cluster is young (&lt;= 3 myr) and is responsible for part of thelate-type absorption features, which are due to pms stars in the cluster, andthe hydrogen emission lines. the second cluster is older (6 myr - 18 myr) andis needed to reproduce the overall depth of the late-type absorption featuresin the spectrum. both are required to accurately reproduce the near-infraredspectrum of the object. thus we have directly detected pms objects in anunresolved super-star cluster for the first time using a combination ofpopulation synthesis models and pre-main sequence tracks. this analysis servesas a testbed of our technique to constrain the low-mass imf in young super-starclusters as well as an exploration of the star formation history of young uchii regions.

1001.2965	a universal stellar initial mass function? a critical look at variations	few topics in astronomy initiate such vigorous discussion as whether or notthe initial mass function (imf) of stars is universal, or instead sensitive tothe initial conditions of star formation. the distinction is of criticalimportance: the imf influences most of the observable properties of stellarpopulations and galaxies, and detecting variations in the imf could providedeep insights into the process by which stars form. in this review, we take acritical look at the case for imf variations, with a view towards whether otherexplanations are sufficient given the evidence. studies of the field, localyoung clusters and associations, and old globular clusters suggest that thevast majority were drawn from a "universal" imf: a power-law of salpeter index($\gamma=1.35$) above a few solar masses, and a log normal or shallowerpower-law ($\gamma \sim 0-0.25$) between a few tenths and a few solar masses(ignoring the effects of unresolved binaries). the shape and universality ofthe imf at the stellar-substellar boundary is still under investigation anduncertainties remain large, but most observations are consistent with a imfthat declines ($\gamma &lt; -0.5$) well below the hydrogen burning limit.observations of resolved stellar populations and the integrated properties ofmost galaxies are also consistent with a "universal imf", suggesting no grossvariations in the imf over much of cosmic time. there are indications of"non-standard" imfs in specific local and extragalactic environments, whichclearly warrant further study. nonetheless, there is no clear evidence that theimf varies strongly and systematically as a function of initial conditionsafter the first few generations of stars.

1011.2496	dissecting the moth: discovery of an off-centered ring in the hd 61005  debris disk with high-resolution imaging	the debris disk known as "the moth" is named after its unusually asymmetricsurface brightness distribution. it is located around the ~90 myr old g8v starhd 61005 at 34.5 pc and has previously been imaged by the hst at 1.1 and 0.6microns. polarimetric observations suggested that the circumstellar materialconsists of two distinct components, a nearly edge-on disk or ring, and aswept-back feature, the result of interaction with the interstellar medium. weresolve both components at unprecedented resolution with vlt/naco h-bandimaging. using optimized angular differential imaging techniques to remove thelight of the star, we reveal the disk component as a distinct narrow ring atinclination i=84.3 \pm 1.0{\deg}. we determine a semi-major axis of a=61.25 \pm0.85 au and an eccentricity of e=0.045 \pm 0.015, assuming that periastron islocated along the apparent disk major axis. therefore, the ring center isoffset from the star by at least 2.75 \pm 0.85 au. the offset, together with arelatively steep inner rim, could indicate a planetary companion that perturbsthe remnant planetesimal belt. from our imaging data we set upper mass limitsfor companions that exclude any object above the deuterium-burning limit forseparations down to 0.3". the ring shows a strong brightness asymmetry alongboth the major and minor axis. a brighter front side could indicateforward-scattering grains, while the brightness difference between the ne andsw components can be only partly explained by the ring center offset,suggesting additional density enhancements on one side of the ring. theswept-back component appears as two streamers originating near the ne and swedges of the debris ring.

[oi] isundetected toward hr 8799 and hd 377 with 3 sigma upper limits of 6.8 x 10^-18w m^-2 and 9.9 x 10^-18 w m^-2 respectively. we find an [oi] detection for rxj1852.3-3700 at 12.3 +- 1.8 x 10^-18 w m^-2. we use thermo-chemical disk modelsto model the gas emission, using constraints on the [oi] 63 micron, andancillary data to derive gas mass upper limits and constrain gas-to-dustratios. for hd 377 and hr 8799, we find 3 sigma upper limits on the gas mass of0.1-20 mearth. for rx j1852.3-3700, we find two distinct disk scenarios thatcould explain the detection of [oi] 63 micron and co(2-1) upper limits reportedfrom the literature: (i) a large disk with gas co-located with the dust (16-500au), resulting in a large tenuous disk with ~16 mearth of gas, or (ii) anoptically thick gas disk, truncated at ~70 au, with a gas mass of 150 mearth.we discuss the implications of these results for the formation and evolution ofplanets in these three systems.

1208.0335	characterizing the dynamical state of star clusters from snapshots of  their spatial distributions	we determine the distribution of stellar surface densities, \sigma, frommodels of static and dynamically evolving star clusters with differentmorphologies, including both radially smooth and substructured clusters. wefind that the \sigma distribution is degenerate, in the sense that manydifferent cluster morphologies (smooth or substructured) produce similarcumulative distributions. however, when used in tandem with a measure ofstructure, such as the q-parameter, the current spatial and dynamical state ofa star cluster can be inferred. the effect of cluster dynamics on the \sigmadistribution and the q-parameter is investigated using n-body simulations andwe find that, depending on the assumed initial conditions, the \sigmadistribution can rapidly evolve from high to low densities in less than 5myr.this suggests that the \sigma distribution can only be used to assess thecurrent density of a star forming region, and provides little information onits initial density. however, if the \sigma distribution is used together withthe q-parameter, then information on the amount of substructure can be used asa proxy to infer the amount of dynamical evolution that has taken place.substructure is erased quickly through dynamics, which can disrupt binary starsystems and planets, as well as facilitate dynamical mass segregation.therefore, dynamical processing in young star forming regions could still besignificant, even without currently observed high densities.

1209.2623	characterizing a cluster's dynamic state using a single epoch of radial  velocities	radial velocity measurements can be used to constrain the dynamical state ofa stellar cluster. however, for clusters with velocity dispersions smaller thana few km/s the observed radial velocity distribution tends to be dominated bythe orbital motions of binaries rather than the stellar motions through thepotential well of the cluster. our goal is to characterize the intrinsicvelocity distribution of a cluster from a single epoch of radial velocity data,even for a cluster with a velocity dispersion of a fraction of a km/s, using amaximum likelihood procedure. assuming a period, mass ratio, and eccentricitydistribution for the binaries in the observed cluster this procedure fits adynamical model describing the velocity distribution for the single stars andcenter of masses of the binaries, simultaneously with the radial velocitiescaused by binary orbital motions, using all the information available in theobserved velocity distribution. we find that the fits to the intrinsic velocitydistribution depend only weakly on the binary properties assumed, so theuncertainty in the fitted parameters tends to be dominated by statisticaluncertainties. based on monte carlo simulations we provide an estimate of howthese statistical uncertainties vary with the velocity dispersion, binaryfraction, and the number of observed stars, which can be used to estimate thesample size needed to reach a specific accuracy. finally we test the method onthe well-studied open cluster ngc 188, showing that it can reproduce a velocitydispersion of only 0.5 km/s using a single epoch of the multi-epoch radialvelocity data. if the binary period, mass ratio, and eccentricity distributionof the observed stars are roughly known, this procedure can be used to correctfor the effect of binary orbital motions on an observed velocity distribution.[abridged]

1209.3635	on the origin of elemental abundances in the terrestrial planets	the abundances of elements in the earth and the terrestrial planets providethe initial conditions for life and clues as to the history and formation ofthe solar system. we follow the pioneering work of bond et al. (2010) andcombine circumstellar disk models, chemical equilibrium calculations anddynamical simulations of planet formation to study the bulk composition ofrocky planets. we use condensation sequence calculations to estimate theinitial abundance of solids in the circumstellar disk with propertiesdetermined from time dependent theoretical models. we combine this withdynamical simulations of planetesimal growth that trace the solids during theplanet formation process. we calculate the elemental abundances in theresulting planets and explore how these vary with the choice of disk model andthe initial conditions within the solar nebula.  although certain characteristics of the terrestrial planets in the solarsystem could be reproduced, none of our models could reproduce the abundanceproperties of all the planets. we found that the choice of the initialplanetesimal disk mass and of the disk model has a significant effect oncomposition gradients. disk models that give higher pressure and temperatureresult in larger variations in the bulk chemical compositions of the resultingplanets due to inhomogeneities in the element abundance profiles and due to thedifferent source regions of the planets in the dynamical simulations. weobserved a trend that massive planets and planets with relatively smallsemi-major axes are more sensitive to these variations than smaller planets atlarger radial distance. only these large variations in the simulated chemicalabundances can potentially explain the diverse bulk composition of the solarsystem planets, whereas mercury's bulk composition can not be reproduced in ourapproach.

1310.3270	supernova enrichment and dynamical histories of solar-type stars in  clusters	we use n-body simulations of star cluster evolution to explore the hypothesisthat short-lived radioactive isotopes found in meteorites, such as 26-al, weredelivered to the sun's protoplanetary disc from a supernova at the epoch ofsolar system formation. we cover a range of star cluster formation parameterspace and model both clusters with primordial substructure, and those withsmooth profiles. we also adopt different initial virial ratios - from cool,collapsing clusters to warm, expanding associations. in each cluster we placethe same stellar population; the clusters each have 2100 stars, and contain onemassive 25m_sun star which is expected to explode as a supernova at about6.6myr. we determine the number of solar (g)-type stars that are within 0.1 -0.3pc of the 25m_sun star at the time of the supernova, which is the distancerequired to enrich the protoplanetary disc with the 26-al abundances found inmeteorites. we then determine how many of these g-dwarfs are unperturbed`singletons'; stars which are never in close binaries, nor suffer sub-100auencounters, and which also do not suffer strong dynamical perturbations.  the evolution of a suite of twenty initially identical clusters is highlystochastic, with the supernova enriching over 10 g-dwarfs in some clusters, andnone at all in others. typically only ~25 per cent of clusters containenriched, unperturbed singletons, and usually only 1 - 2 per cluster (from atotal of 96 g-dwarfs in each cluster). the initial conditions for starformation do not strongly affect the results, although a higher fraction ofsupervirial (expanding) clusters would contain enriched g-dwarfs if thesupernova occurred earlier than 6.6myr. if we sum together simulations withidentical initial conditions, then ~1 per cent of all g-dwarfs in oursimulations are enriched, unperturbed singletons.

1310.8299	a uv-to-mir monitoring of dr tau: exploring how water vapor in the  planet formation region of the disk is affected by stellar accretion  variability	young stars are known to show variability due to non-steady mass accretionrate from their circumstellar disks. accretion flares can produce strongenergetic irradiation and heating that may affect the disk in the planetformation region, close to the central star. during an extreme accretionoutburst in the young star ex lupi, the prototype of exor variables, remarkablechanges in molecular gas emission from $\sim1$ au in the disk have recentlybeen observed (banzatti et al. 2012). here, we focus on water vapor and explorehow it is affected by variable accretion luminosity in t tauri stars. wemonitored a young highly variable solar-mass star, dr tau, using simultaneouslytwo high/medium-resolution eso-vlt spectrographs: visir at 12.4 $\mu$m toobserve water lines from the disk, and x-shooter covering from 0.3 to 2.5$\mu$m to constrain the stellar accretion. three epochs spanning timescalesfrom several days to several weeks were obtained. accretion luminosity wasestimated to change within a factor $\sim2$, and no change in water emissionwas detected at a significant level. in comparison to ex lupi and exoroutbursts, dr tau suggests that the less long-lived and weaker variabilityphenomena typical of t tauri stars may leave water at planet-forming radii inthe disk mostly unaffected. we propose that these systems may provide evidencefor two processes that act over different timescales: uv photochemistry in thedisk atmosphere (faster) and heating of the disk deeper layers (slower).

1311.3639	dynamical evolution of star forming regions	we model the dynamical evolution of star forming regions with a wide range ofinitial properties. we follow the evolution of the regions' substructure usingthe q-parameter, we search for dynamical mass segregation using the lambda_msrtechnique, and we also quantify the evolution of local density around stars asa function of mass using the sigma_ldr method.  the amount of dynamical mass segregation measured by lambda_msr is generallyonly significant for subvirial and virialised, substructured regions - whichusually evolve to form bound clusters. the sigma_ldr method shows that massivestars attain higher local densities than the median value in all regions, eventhose that are supervirial and evolve to form (unbound) associations.  we also introduce the q-sigma_ldr plot, which describes the evolution ofspatial structure as a function of mass-weighted local density in a starforming region. initially dense (&gt;1000 stars pc^{-2}), bound regions alwayshave q &gt;1, sigma_ldr &gt; 2 after 5myr, whereas dense unbound regions always haveq &lt; 1, sigma_ldr &gt; 2 after 5myr. less dense regions (&lt;100 stars pc^{-2}) do notusually exhibit sigma_ldr &gt; 2 values, and if relatively high local densityaround massive stars arises purely from dynamics, then the q-sigma_ldr plot canbe used to estimate the initial density of a star forming region.

1406.0844	binaries in the field: fossils of the star formation process?	recent observations of binary stars in the galactic field show that thebinary fraction and the mean orbital separation both decrease as a function ofdecreasing primary mass. we present $n$-body simulations of the effects ofdynamical evolution in star-forming regions on primordial binary stars todetermine whether these observed trends can be explained by the dynamicalprocessing of a common binary population. we find that dynamical processing ofa binary population with an initial binary fraction of unity and an initialexcess of intermediate/wide separation (100 - 10$^4$ au) binaries does notreproduce the observed properties in the field, even in initially dense ($\sim10^3$m$_\odot$ pc$^{-3}$) star-forming regions.  if instead we adopt a field-like population as the initial conditions, mostbrown dwarf and m-dwarf binaries are dynamically hard and their overallfractions and separation distributions are unaffected by dynamical evolution.g-dwarf and a-star binaries in the field are dynamically intermediate in oursimulated dense regions and dynamical processing does destroy some systems withseparations $&gt;$100 au. however, the formation of wide binaries through thedissolution of supervirial regions is a strong function of primary mass, andthe wide g-dwarf and a-star binaries that are destroyed by dynamical evolutionin subvirial regions are replenished by the formation of binaries insupervirial regions. we therefore suggest that the binary population in thefield is $indicative$ of the primordial binary population in star-formingregions, at least for systems with primary masses in the range 0.02 -3.0m$_\odot$.

1502.06597	on the gap-opening criterion of migrating planets in protoplanetary  disks	we perform two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to quantitativelyexplore the torque balance criterion for gap-opening (as formulated by crida etal. 2006) in a variety of disks when considering a migrating planet. we findthat even when the criterion is satisfied, there are instances when planetsstill do not open gaps. we stress that gap-opening is not only dependent onwhether a planet has the ability to open a gap, but whether it can do soquickly enough. this can be expressed as an additional condition on thegap-opening timescale versus the crossing time, i.e. the time it takes theplanet to cross the region which it is carving out. while this point has beenbriefly made in the previous literature, our results quantify it for a range ofprotoplanetary disk properties and planetary masses, demonstrating how crucialit is for gap-opening. this additional condition has important implications forthe survival of planets formed by core accretion in low mass disks as well asgiant planets or brown dwarfs formed by gravitational instability in massivedisks. it is particularly important for planets with intermediate massessusceptible to type iii-like migration. for some observed transition disks ordisks with gaps, we expect that estimates on the potential planet masses basedon the torque balance gap-opening criterion alone may not be sufficient. withconsideration of this additional timescale criterion theoretical studies mayfind a reduced planet survivability or that planets may migrate further inwardsbefore opening a gap.

1511.04147	in-sync iv - the young stellar population in the orion a molecular cloud	we present the results of the sdss apogee infrared spectroscopy of youngnebulous clusters program (in-sync) survey of the orion a molecular cloud. thissurvey obtained high resolution near infrared (nir) spectroscopy of about 2700young pre-main sequence stars throughout the region, acquired across fivedistinct fields spanning 6deg field of view (fov). with these spectra, we havemeasured accurate stellar parameters (t_eff, log g, v sin i) and extinctions,and placed the sources in the hertzsprung-russel diagram (hrd). we have alsoextracted radial velocities for the kinematic characterization of thepopulation. we compare our measurements with literature results for asub-sample of targets in order to assess the performances and accuracy of thesurvey. source extinction shows evidence for dust grains that are larger thanthose in the diffuse interstellar medium (ism): we estimate an average r_v=5.5in the region. importantly, we find a clear correlation between hrd inferredages and spectroscopic surface-gravity inferred ages. this clearly indicates areal spread of stellar radii at fixed temperature, and together with additionalcorrelations with extinction and with disk presence, strongly suggests a realspread of ages large than a few myr. focussing on the young population aroundngc1980 iota ori, which has previously been suggested to be a separate,foreground, older cluster, we confirm its older (5myr) age and low a_v, butconsidering that its radial velocity distribution is indistinguishable from theorion a's population, we suggest that ngc1980 is part of orion a's starformation activity. based on their stellar parameters and kinematic properties,we identify 383 new candidate members of orion a, most of which are disklesssources in areas of the region poorly studied by previous works.

1512.04552	detection of sharp symmetric features in the circumbinary disk around ak  sco	the search for planets orbiting two stars (spots) survey aims to study theformation and distribution of planets in binary systems by detecting andcharacterizing circumbinary planets and their formation environments throughdirect imaging. with the sphere extreme adaptive optics instrument, a goodcontrast can be achieved even at small (&lt;300 mas) separations from brightstars, which enables studies of planets and disks in a separation range thatwas previously inaccessible. here, we report the discovery of resolvedscattered light emission from the circumbinary disk around the well-studiedyoung double star ak sco, at projected separations in the ~13--40 au range. thesharp morphology of the imaged feature is surprising, given the smoothappearance of the disk in its spectral energy distribution. we show that theobserved morphology can be represented either as a highly eccentric ring aroundak sco, or as two separate spiral arms in the disk, wound in oppositedirections. the relative merits of these interpretations are discussed, as wellas whether these features may have been caused by one or several circumbinaryplanets interacting with the disk.
