0909.0948	the chemical composition of the sun	the solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in ourunderstanding of the formation, structure and evolution of both the sun and oursolar system. furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against whichthe elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. in thisreview we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photosphericcomposition. in particular, we present a re-determination of the abundances ofnearly all available elements, using a realistic new 3-dimensional (3d),time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. we have carefullyconsidered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accountedfor departures from lte whenever possible. the end result is a comprehensiveand homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. particularlynoteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of carbon, nitrogen,oxygen and neon compared with the widely-used values of a decade ago. the newsolar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internalconsistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement withvalues obtained in the solar neighborhood and from the most pristinemeteorites. there is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of thesolar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to finda satisfactory resolution.

0909.2307	oxygen lines in solar granulation. i. testing 3d models against new  observations with high spatial and spectral resolution	aims: we seek to provide additional tests of the line formation oftheoretical 3d solar photosphere models. in particular, we set out to test thespatially-resolved line formation at several viewing angles, from the solardisk-centre to the limb and focusing on atomic oxygen lines. the purpose ofthese tests is to provide additional information on whether the 3d model issuitable to derive the solar oxygen abundance. we also aim to empiricallyconstrain the nlte recipes for neutral hydrogen collisions, using thespatially-resolved observations of the oi 777 nm lines. methods: using theswedish 1-m solar telescope we obtained high-spatial-resolution observations offive atomic oxygen lines (along with lines for other species) for fivepositions on the solar disk. these observations have a high spatial andspectral resolution, and a continuum intensity contrast up to 9% at 615 nm. thetheoretical line profiles were computed using the 3d model, with a full 3d nltetreatment for oxygen and lte for the other lines. results: at disk-centre wefind an excellent agreement between predicted and observed line shifts,strengths, fwhm and asymmetries. at other viewing angles the agreement is alsogood, but the smaller continuum intensity contrast makes a quantitativecomparison harder. we use the disk-centre observations we constrain s_h, thescaling factor for the efficiency of collisions with neutral hydrogen. we findthat s_h=1 provides the best match to the observations. conclusions: overallthere is a very good agreement between predicted and observed line propertiesover the solar granulation. this further reinforces the view that the 3d modelis realistic and a reliable tool to derive the solar oxygen abundance.

0909.2310	oxygen lines in solar granulation. ii. centre-to-limb variation, nlte  line formation, blends and the solar oxygen abundance	context: there is a lively debate about the solar oxygen abundance and therole of 3d models in its recent downward revision. the models have been testedusing high resolution solar atlases. further testing can be done usingcentre-to-limb variations. aims: using high quality observations of oxygenlines across the solar surface we seek to test if the 3d and 1d modelsreproduce their observed centre-to-limb variation (clv). in particular we seekto assess whether the 3d model is appropriate to derive the solar oxygenabundance. methods: we use our recent observations of oi 777 nm, oi 615.81 nm,[oi] 630.03 nm and nine lines of other elements for five viewing angles0.2&lt;mu&lt;1 of the quiet solar disk. we compare them with the predicted lineprofiles from the 3d and 1d models computed using the most up-to-date lineformation codes, line data and allowing for departures of lte. the clv of theoi 777 nm lines is also used to obtain an empirical correction for the poorlyknown efficiency of the inelastic collisions with h. results: the 3d modelgenerally reproduces the clv observations of the lines very well, particularlythe oxygen lines. from the oi 777 nm lines we find that the classical drawinrecipe slightly overestimates h collisions. the limb observations of the oi615.82 nm line allow us to identify a previously unknown contribution ofmolecules for this line, prevalent at the solar limb. a detailed treatment ofthe [oi] 630.03 nm line shows that the 3d modeling provides an excellentagreement with the observations. the derived oxygen abundances with the 3dmodel are 8.68 (oi 777 nm), 8.66 ([oi] 630.03 nm) and 8.62 (oi 615.82 nm).conclusions: these additional tests have reinforced the trustworthiness of the3d model and line formation for abundance analyses.

0909.2668	new solar composition: the problem with solar models revisited	we construct updated solar models with different sets of solar abundances,including the most recent determinations by asplund et al. (2009). the latterwork predicts a larger ($\sim 10%$) solar metallicity compared to previousmeasurements by the same authors but significantly lower ($\sim 25%$) than therecommended value from a decade ago by grevesse &amp; sauval (1998). we compare theresults of our models with determinations of the solar structure inferredthrough helioseismology measurements. the model that uses the most recent solarabundance determinations predicts the base of the solar convective envelope tobe located at $r_{\rm cz}= 0.724{\rm r_\odot}$ and a surface helium massfraction of $y_{\rm surf}=0.231$. these results are in conflict withhelioseismology data ($r_{\rm cz}= 0.713\pm0.001{\rm r_\odot}$ and $y_{\rmsurf}=0.2485\pm0.0035$) at 5$-\sigma$ and 11$-\sigma$ levels respectively.using the new solar abundances, we calculate the magnitude by which radiativeopacities should be modified in order to restore agreement withhelioseismology. we find that a maximum change of $\sim 15%$ at the base of theconvective zone is required with a smooth decrease towards the core, where thechange needed is $\sim 5%$. the required change at the base of the convectiveenvelope is about half the value estimated previously. we also present thesolar neutrino fluxes predicted by the new models. the most important changesbrought about by the new solar abundances are the increase by $\sim 10%$ in thepredicted $^{13}$n and $^{15}$o fluxes that arise mostly due to the increase inthe c and n abundances in the newly determined solar composition.

1002.1993	the light elements in the light of 3d and non-lte effects	in this review we discuss possible systematic errors inherent in classical 1dlte abundance analyses of late-type stars for the light elements (here: h, he,li, be and b). the advent of realistic 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres andthe availability of non-lte line formation codes place the stellar analyses ona much firmer footing and indeed drastically modify the astrophysicalinterpretations in many cases, especially at low metallicities. for theteff-sensitive hydrogen lines both stellar granulation and non-lte are likelyimportant but the combination of the two has not yet been fully explored. afortuitous near-cancellation of significant but opposite 3d and non-lte effectsleaves the derived 7li abundances largely unaffected but new atomic collisionaldata should be taken into account. we also discuss the impact on 3d non-lteline formation on the estimated lithium isotopic abundances in halo stars inlight of recent claims that convective line asymmetries can mimic the presenceof 6li. while be only have relatively minor non-lte abundance corrections, b issensitive even if the latest calculations imply smaller non-lte effects thanpreviously thought.

1005.2944	observational evidence for a broken li spite plateau and mass-dependent  li depletion	we present nlte li abundances for 88 stars in the metallicity range -3.5 &lt;[fe/h] &lt; -1.0. the effective temperatures are based on the infrared flux methodwith improved e(b-v) values obtained mostly from interstellar nai d lines. theli abundances were derived through marcs models and high-quality uves+vlt,hires+keck and fies+not spectra, and complemented with reliable equivalentwidths from the literature. the less-depleted stars with [fe/h] &lt; -2.5 and[fe/h] &gt; -2.5 fall into two well-defined plateaus of a_{li} = 2.18 (sigma =0.04) and a_{li} = 2.27 (sigma = 0.05), respectively. we show that the twoplateaus are flat, unlike previous claims for a steep monotonic decrease in liabundances with decreasing metallicities. at all metallicities we uncover afine-structure in the li abundances of spite plateau stars, which we trace toli depletion that depends on both metallicity and mass. models including atomicdiffusion and turbulent mixing seem to reproduce the observed li depletionassuming a primordial li abundance a_{li} = 2.64, which agrees well withcurrent predictions (a_{li} = 2.72) from standard big bang nucleosynthesis.adopting the kurucz overshooting model atmospheres increases the li abundanceby +0.08 dex to a_{li} = 2.72, which perfectly agrees with bbn+wmap.

1008.0575	lithium depletion in solar-like stars: no planet connection	we have determined precise stellar parameters and lithium abundances in asample of 117 stars with basic properties very similar to the sun. this sampleselection reduces biasing effects and systematic errors in the analysis. weestimate the ages of our sample stars mainly from isochrone fitting but alsofrom measurements of rotation period and x-ray luminosity and test theconnection between lithium abundance, age, and stellar parameters. we findstrong evidence for increasing lithium depletion with age. our sample includes14 stars that are known to host planets and it does not support recent claimsthat planet-host stars have experienced more lithium depletion than starswithout planets. we find the solar lithium abundance normal for a star of itsage, mass, and metallicity. furthermore, we analyze published data for 82 starsthat were reported to support an enhanced lithium depletion in planet hosts. weshow that those stars in fact follow an age trend very similar to that foundwith our sample and that the presence of giant planets is not related to lowlithium abundances. finally, we discuss the systematic biases that led to theincorrect conclusion of an enhanced lithium depletion in planet-host stars.

1012.0842	on the alleged duality of the galactic halo	we examine the kinematics of the galactic halo based on sdss/segue data bycarollo et al. (2007, 2010). we find that their claims of a counter-rotatinghalo are the result of substantial biases in distance estimates (of order 50%):the claimed retrograde component, which makes up only a tiny fraction of theentire sample, prone to contaminations, is identified as the tail of distanceoverestimates. the strong overestimates also result in a lift in the verticalvelocity component, which explains the large altitudes those objects wereclaimed to reach. errors are worst for the lowest metallicity stars, whichexplains the metal-poor nature of the artificial component. we also argue thatmeasurement errors were not properly accounted for and that the use of gaussianfitting on intrinsically non-gaussian galactic components invokes theidentification of components that are distorted or even artificial. ourevaluation of the data leads to a revision of the estimated velocity ellipsoidsand does not yield any reliable evidence for a counterrotating halo component.if a distinct counterrotating halo component exists it must be far weaker thanclaimed by carollo et al. finally we note that their revised analysis presentedin beers et al. (2011) does not alleviate our main concerns.

1103.4651	new constraints on the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood and  galactic disc(s). improved astrophysical parameters for the geneva-copenhagen  survey	we present a re-analysis of the geneva-copenhagen survey, which benefits fromthe infrared flux method to improve the accuracy of the derived stellareffective temperatures and uses the latter to build a consistent and improvedmetallicity scale. metallicities are calibrated on high-resolution spectroscopyand checked against four open clusters and a moving group, showing excellentconsistency. the new temperature and metallicity scales provide a better matchto theoretical isochrones, which are used for a bayesian analysis of stellarages. with respect to previous analyses, our stars are on average 100 k hotterand 0.1 dex more metal rich, which shift the peak of the metallicitydistribution function around the solar value. from stromgren photometry we areable to derive for the first time a proxy for alpha elements, which enables usto perform a tentative dissection of the chemical thin and thick disc. we findevidence for the latter being composed of an old, mildly but systematicallyalpha-enhanced population that extends to super solar metallicities, inagreement with spectroscopic studies. our revision offers the largest existingkinematically unbiased sample of the solar neighbourhood that contains fullinformation on kinematics, metallicities, and ages and thus provides betterconstraints on the physical processes relevant in the build-up of the milky waydisc, enabling a better understanding of the sun in a galactic context.

1108.4527	is the solar spectrum latitude dependent? an investigation with  sst/trippel	context: in studies of the solar spectrum relative to spectra of solar twinstars, it has been found that the chemical composition of the sun seems todepart systematically from those of the twins. one possible explanation is thatthe effect is due to the special aspect angle of the sun when observed fromearth, as compared with the aspect angles of the twins. thus, a latitudedependence of the solar spectrum, even with the heliocentric angle constant,could lead to effects of the type observed.  aim: we explore a possible variation in the strength of certain spectrallines, used in the comparisons between the composition of the sun and thetwins, at loci on the solar disk with different latitudes but at constantheliocentric angle.  methods: we use the trippel spectrograph at the swedish 1-m solar telescopeon la palma to record spectra in five spectral regions in order to comparedifferent locations on the solar disk at a heliocentric angle of 45 deg.equivalent widths and other parameters are measured for fifteen different linesrepresenting nine atomic species.  results: the relative variations in equivalent widths at the equator and atsolar latitude 45 deg are found to be less than 1.5 % for all spectral linesstudied. translated to elemental abundances as they would be measured from aterrestrial and a hypothetical pole-on observer, the difference is estimated tobe within 0.005 dex in all cases.  conclusion: it is very unlikely that latitude effects could cause thereported abundance difference between the sun and the solar twins. the accuracyobtainable in measurements of small differences in spectral line strengthsbetween different solar disk positions is very high.

1111.0204	the detection and treatment of distance errors in kinematic analyses of  stars	we present a new method for detecting and correcting systematic errors in thedistances to stars when both proper motions and line-of-sight velocities areavailable. the method, which is applicable for samples of 200 or more starsthat have a significant extension on the sky, exploits correlations between themeasured u, v and w velocity components that are introduced by distance errors.we deliver a formalism to describe and interpret the specific imprints ofdistance errors including spurious velocity correlations and shifts of meanmotion in a sample. we take into account correlations introduced by measurementerrors, galactic rotation and changes in the orientation of the velocityellipsoid with position in the galaxy. tests on pseudodata show that the methodis more robust and sensitive than traditional approaches to this problem. weinvestigate approaches to characterising the probability distribution ofdistance errors, in addition to the mean distance error, which is the maintheme of the paper. stars with the most overestimated distances bias ourestimate of the overall distance scale, leading to the corrected distancesbeing slightly too small. we give a formula that can be used to correct forthis effect. we apply the method to samples of stars from the segue survey,exploring optimal gravity cuts, sample contamination, and correcting the useddistance relations.

1207.2455	nlte line formation of fe for late-type stars. i. standard stars with 1d  and &lt;3d&gt; model atmospheres	we investigate departures from lte in the line formation of fe for a numberof well-studied late-type stars in different evolutionary stages. a new modelof fe atom was constructed from the most up-to-date theoretical andexperimental atomic data available so far. non-local thermodynamic equilibrium(nlte) line formation calculations for fe were performed using 1d hydrostaticmarcs and mafags-os model atmospheres, as well as the spatial and temporalaverage stratifications from full 3d hydrodynamical simulations of stellarconvection computed using the stagger code. it is shown that the fe i/fe iiionization balance can be well established with the 1d and mean 3d models undernlte including calibrated inelastic collisions with h i calculated from thedrawin's (1969) formulae. strong low-excitation fe i lines are very sensitiveto the atmospheric structure; classical 1d models fail to provide consistentexcitation balance, particularly so for cool metal-poor stars. a betteragreement between fe i lines spanning a range of excitation potentials isobtained with the mean 3d models. mean nlte metallicities determined for thestandard stars using the 1d and mean 3d models are fully consistent. also, thenlte spectroscopic effective temperatures and gravities from ionization balanceagree with that determined by other methods, e.g., infrared flux method andparallaxes, if one of the stellar parameters is constrained independently.

1304.4932	how realistic are solar model atmospheres?	recently, new solar model atmospheres have been developed to replaceclassical 1d lte hydrostatic models and used to for example derive the solarchemical composition. we aim to test various models against key observationalconstraints. in particular, a 3d model used to derive the solar abundances, a3d mhd model (with an imposed 10 mt vertical magnetic field), 1d models fromthe phoenix project, the 1d marcs model, and the 1d semi-empirical model ofholweger &amp; m\"uller. we confront the models with observational diagnostics ofthe temperature profile: continuum centre-to-limb variations (clv), absolutecontinuum fluxes, and the wings of hydrogen lines. we also test the 3d modelsfor the intensity distribution of the granulation and spectral line shapes. thepredictions from the 3d model are in excellent agreement with the continuum clvobservations, performing even better than the holweger &amp; m\"uller model(constructed largely to fulfil such observations). the predictions of the 1dtheoretical models are worse, given their steeper temperature gradients. forthe continuum fluxes, predictions for most models agree well with theobservations. no model fits all hydrogen lines perfectly, but again the 3dmodel comes ahead. the 3d model also reproduces the observed continuumintensity fluctuations and spectral line shapes very well. the excellentagreement of the 3d model with the observables reinforces the view that itstemperature structure is realistic. it outperforms the mhd simulation in alldiagnostics, implying that recent claims for revised abundances based on mhdmodelling are premature. several weaknesses in the 1d models are exposed. thedifferences between the phoenix lte and nlte models are small. we conclude thatthe 3d hydrodynamical model is superior to any of the tested 1d models, whichgives further confidence in the solar abundance analyses based on it.

1305.6564	the lithium isotopic ratio in very metal-poor stars	un-evolved, very metal-poor stars are the most important tracers of thecosmic abundance of lithium in the early universe. combining the standard bigbang nucleosynthesis model with galactic production through cosmic rayspallation, these stars at [fe/h]&lt;-2 are expected to show an undetectably small6li/7li isotopic signature. evidence to the contrary may necessitate anadditional pre-galactic production source or a revision of the standard modelof big bang nucleosynthesis. we revisit the isotopic analysis of four halostars, two with claimed 6li-detections in the literature, to investigate theinfluence of improved model atmospheres and line formation treatment. for thefirst time, a combined 3d, nlte (non-local thermodynamic equilibrium) modellingtechnique for li, na, and ca lines is utilised to constrain the intrinsicline-broadening and to determine the li isotopic ratio. we discuss theinfluence of 3d nlte effects on line profile shapes and assess the realism ofour modelling using the ca excitation and ionisation balance. by accounting fornlte line formation in realistic 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres, we canmodel the li resonance line and other neutral lines with a consistency that issuperior to lte, with no need for additional line asymmetry caused by thepresence of 6li. contrary to the results from 1d and 3d lte modelling, no starin our sample has a significant 2-sigma detection of the lighter isotope innlte. over a large parameter space, nlte modelling systematically reduces thebest-fit li isotopic ratios by up to five percentage points. as a bi-product,we also present the first ever 3d nlte ca and na abundances of halo stars,which reveal significant departures from lte. the observational support for asignificant and non-standard 6li production source in the early universe issubstantially weakened by our findings.

1307.4486	high precision differential abundance measurements in globular clusters:  chemical inhomogeneities in ngc 6752	we report on a strictly differential line-by-line analysis of high qualityuves spectra of bright giants in the metal-poor globular cluster ngc 6752. weachieved high precision differential chemical abundance measurements for fe,na, si, ca, ti, cr, ni, zn, y, zr, ba, la, ce, pr, nd, sm, eu and dy withuncertainties as low as ~0.01 dex (~2%). we obtained the following mainresults. (1) the observed abundance dispersions are a factor of ~2 larger thanthe average measurement uncertainty. (2) there are positive correlations, ofhigh statistical significance, between all elements and na. (3) for any pair ofelements, there are positive correlations of high statistical significance,although the amplitudes of the abundance variations are small. removingabundance trends with effective temperature and/or using a different pair ofreference stars does not alter these results. these abundance variations andcorrelations may reflect a combination of (a) he abundance variations and (b)inhomogeneous chemical evolution in the pre- or proto-cluster environment.regarding the former, the current constraints on delta y from photometry likelypreclude he as being the sole explanation. regarding the latter, thenucleosynthetic source(s) must have synthesised na, alpha, fe-peak andneutron-capture elements and in constant amounts for species heavier than si;no individual object can achieve such nucleosynthesis. we speculate that other,if not all, globular clusters may exhibit comparable abundance variations andcorrelations to ngc 6752 if subjected to a similarly precise analysis.

1403.0937	does segue/sdss indicate a dual galactic halo?	we re-examine recent claims of observational evidence for a dual galactichalo in segue/sdss data, and trace them back to improper error treatment andneglect of selection effects. in particular, the detection of a verticalabundance gradient in the halo can be explained as a metallicity bias indistance. a similar bias, and the impact of disk contamination, affect thesample of blue horizontal branch stars. these examples highlight why non-volumecomplete samples require forward-modelling from theoretical models or extensivebias-corrections. we also show how observational uncertainties produce thespecific non-gaussianity in the observed azimuthal velocity distribution ofhalo stars, which can be erroneously identified as two gaussian components. asingle kinematic component yields an excellent fit to the observed data, whenwe model the measurement process including distance uncertainties. furthermore,we show that sample differences in proper motion space are the directconsequence of kinematic cuts, and are enhanced when distance estimates areless accurate. thus, their presence is neither a proof for a separatepopulation, nor a measure of reliability for the applied distances. we concludethat currently there is no evidence from segue/sdss that would favour a dualgalactic halo over a single halo full of substructure.

1405.0236	improvements to stellar structure models, based on a grid of 3d  convection simulations. i. $t(\tau)$-relations	relations between temperature, t, and optical depth, tau, are often used fordescribing the photospheric transition from optically thick to optically thinin stellar structure models. we show that this is well justified, but also thatcurrently used t(tau) relations are often inconsistent with theirimplementation. as an outer boundary condition on the system of stellarstructure equations, t(tau) relations have an undue effect on the overallstructure of stars. in this age of precision asteroseismology, we need tore-assess both the method for computing and for implementing t(tau) relations,and the assumptions they rest on. we develop a formulation for proper andconsistent evaluation of t(tau) relations from arbitrary 1d or 3d stellaratmospheres, and for their implementation in stellar structure and evolutionmodels. we extract radiative t(tau) relations, as described by our newformulation, from 3d simulations of convection in deep stellar atmospheres oflate-type stars from dwarfs to giants. these simulations employ realisticopacities and equation of state, and account for line-blanketing. forcomparison, we also extract t(tau) relations from 1d marcs model atmospheresusing the same formulation. t(tau)-relations from our grid of 3d convectionsimulations display a larger range of behaviours with surface gravity, comparedwith those of conventional theoretical 1d hydrostatic atmosphere models. basedon this, we recommend no longer to use scaled solar t(tau) relations. fileswith t(tau) relations for our grid of simulations are made available to thecommunity, together with routines for interpolating in this irregular grid. wealso provide matching tables of atmospheric opacity, for consistentimplementation in stellar structure models.

1405.0279	the elemental composition of the sun i. the intermediate mass elements  na to ca	the composition of the sun is an essential piece of reference data forastronomy, cosmology, astroparticle, space and geo-physics. this article,dealing with the intermediate-mass elements na to ca, is the first in a seriesdescribing the comprehensive re-determination of the solar composition. in thisseries we severely scrutinise all ingredients of the analysis across allelements, to obtain the most accurate, homogeneous and reliable resultspossible. we employ a highly realistic 3d hydrodynamic solar photosphericmodel, which has successfully passed an arsenal of observational diagnostics.to quantify systematic errors, we repeat the analysis with three 1d hydrostaticmodel atmospheres (marcs, miss and holweger &amp; m\"{u}ller 1974) and ahorizontally and temporally-averaged version of the 3d model($\langle$3d$\rangle$). we account for departures from lte wherever possible.we have scoured the literature for the best transition probabilities, partitionfunctions, hyperfine and other data, and stringently checked all observedprofiles for blends. our final 3d+nlte abundances are:$\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{na}}=6.21\pm0.04$,$\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{mg}}=7.59\pm0.04$,$\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{al}}=6.43\pm0.04$,$\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{si}}=7.51\pm0.03$,$\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{p}}=5.41\pm0.03$, $\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{s}}=7.13\pm0.03$, $\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{k}}=5.04\pm0.05$ and$\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{ca}}=6.32\pm0.03$. the uncertainties include bothstatistical and systematic errors. our results are systematically smaller thanmost previous ones with the 1d semi-empirical holweger &amp; m\"uller model. the$\langle$3d$\rangle$ model returns abundances very similar to the full 3dcalculations. this analysis provides a complete description and a slight updateof the na to ca results presented in asplund, grevesse, sauval &amp; scott(arxiv:0909.0948), with full details of all lines and input data.

1406.2385	hip 114328: a new refractory-poor and li-poor solar twin	[context]. the standard solar model fails to predict the very low lithiumabundance in the sun, which is much lower than the proto-solar nebula. this liproblem has been debated for decades, and it has been ascribed either to planetformation or to secular stellar depletion. in order to test the evolution ofli, it is important to find solar twins in a range of ages. also, the study ofstars similar to the sun is relevant in relation to the signature ofterrestrial planet formation around the sun. [methods]. we acquiredhigh-resolution (r=110,000), high s/n (~300) eso/vlt uves spectra of severalsolar twin candidates and the sun (as reflected from the asteroid juno). amongthe solar twin candidates we identify hip 114328 as a solar twin and perform adifferential line-by-line abundance analysis of this star relative to the sun.[results]. hip 114328 has stellar parameters teff = 5785+/-10 k, log g =4.38+/-0.03, [fe/h] = -0.022+/-0.009, and a microturbulent velocity 0.05+/-0.03km/s higher than solar. the differential analysis shows that this star ischemically very similar to the sun. the refractory elements seem even slightlymore depleted than in the sun, meaning that hip 114328 may be as likely to formterrestrial planets as the sun. hip 114328 is about 2 gyr older than the sun,and is thus the second oldest solar twin analyzed at high precision. it has ali abundance of a(li)nlte &lt;= 0.46, which is about 4 times lower than in the sun(a(li)nlte = 1.07 dex), but close to the oldest solar twin known, hip 102152.[conclusions]. based on the lower abundances of refractory elements whencompared to other solar twins, hip 114328 seems an excellent candidate to hostrocky planets. the low li abundance of this star is consistent with its old ageand fits very well the emerging li-age relation among solar twins of differentages.

1408.0290	ngc 6522: a typical globular cluster in the galactic bulge without  signatures of rapidly rotating population iii stars	we present an abundance analysis of eight potential member stars of the oldgalactic bulge globular cluster ngc6522. the same stars have previously beenstudied by chiappini et al. (2011), who found very high abundances of the slowneutron capture elements compared with other clusters and field stars ofsimilar metallicity, which they interpreted as reflecting nucleosynthesis inrapidly rotating, massive population iii stars. in contrast to their analysis,we do not find any unusual enhancements of the neutron capture elements sr, y,ba and eu and conclude that previous claims result mainly from not properlyaccounting for blending lines. instead we find ngc6522 to be an unremarkableglobular cluster with comparable abundance trends to other galactic globularclusters at the same metallicity ([fe/h] = -1.15 +/- 0.16). the stars are alsochemically similar to halo and bulge field stars at the same metallicity,spanning a small range in [y/ba] and with normal {\alpha}-element abundances.we thus find no observational evidence for any chemical signatures of rapidlyrotating population iii stars in ngc 6522.

[results]. we find that hip 10725 is severely depleted in beryllium([be/h] &lt;= -1.2 dex) for its stellar parameters and age. the abundancesrelative to solar of the elements with z &lt;= 30 show a correlation withcondensation temperature and the neutron capture elements produced by thes-process are greatly enhanced, while the r-process elements seem normal. wefound its projected rotational velocity (v sin i = 3.3+/-0.1 km/s) to besignificantly larger than solar, and incompatible with its isochrone-derivedage. radial velocity monitoring shows that the star has a binary companion.[conclusions]. based on the high s-process element enhancements and lowberyllium abundance, we suggest that hip 10725 has been polluted bymass-transfer from an agb star, probably with initial mass of about 2 m_sun.the radial velocity variations suggest the presence of an unseen binarycompanion, probably the remnant of a former agb star. isochrones predict asolar-age star, but this is in disagreement with the high projected rotationalvelocity and high chromospheric activity. we conclude that hip 10725 is a fieldblue straggler, rejuvenated by the mass transfer process of its former agbcompanion.

astro-ph;0105262	chemical abundances from inversions of stellar spectra: analysis of  solar-type stars with homogeneous and static model atmospheres	spectra of late-type stars are usually analyzed with static model atmospheresin local thermodynamic equilibrium (lte) and a homogeneous plane-parallel orspherically symmetric geometry. the energy balance requires particularattention, as two elements which are particularly difficult to model play animportant role: line blanketing and convection. inversion techniques are ableto bypass the difficulties of a detailed description of the energy balance.assuming that the atmosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium and lte, it ispossible to constrain its structure from spectroscopic observations. among themost serious approximations still implicit in the method is a static andhomogeneous geometry. in this paper, we take advantage of a realisticthree-dimensional radiative hydrodynamical simulation of the solar surface tocheck the systematic errors incurred by an inversion assuming a plane-parallelhorizontally-homogeneous atmosphere. the thermal structure recovered resemblesthe spatial and time average of the three-dimensional atmosphere. furthermore,the abundances retrieved are typically within 10% (0.04 dex) of the abundancesused to construct the simulation. the application to a fairly complete datasetfrom the solar spectrum provides further confidence in previous analyses of thesolar composition. there is only a narrow range of one-dimensional thermalstructures able to fit the absorption lines in the spectrum of the sun. withour carefully selected dataset, random errors are about a factor of two smallerthan systematic errors. a small number of strong metal lines can provide veryreliable results. we foresee no major difficulty in applying the technique toother similar stars, and obtaining similar accuracies, using spectra with aresolving power about 50,000 and a signal-to-noise ratio as low as 30.

astro-ph;0310472	the evolution of the c/o ratio in metal-poor halo stars	we report new measurements of carbon and oxygen abundances in 34 f and gdwarf and subgiant stars belonging to the halo population and spanning a rangeof metallicity from [fe/h] = -0.7 to -3.2 . the survey is based on observationsof four permitted lines of c i near 9100 a, and the o i 7774 a triplet, allrecorded at high signal-to-noise ratios with the uves echelle spectrograph onthe eso vlt. the line equivalent widths were analysed with the 1d, lte, marcsmodel atmosphere code to deduce c and o abundances; corrections due to non-lteand 3d effects are discussed. when combined with similar published data fordisk stars, our results confirm the metallicity dependence of the c/o ratioknown from previous stellar and interstellar studies: c/o drops by a factor of3-4 as o/h decreases from solar to 1/10 solar. analysed within the context ofstandard models for the chemical evolution of the solar vicinity, this dropresults from the metallicity dependence of the c yields from massive stars withmass loss, augmented by the delayed release of c from stars of low andintermediate mass. the former is, however, always the dominant factor. oursurvey has also uncovered tentative evidence to suggest that, as the oxygenabundance decreases below [o/h] = -1, [c/o] may not remain constant at [c/o] =-0.5, as previously thought, but increase again, possibly approachingnear-solar values at the lowest metallicities ([o/h] approximately equal to-3). with the current dataset this is no more than a 3 sigma effect and it maybe due to metallicity-dependent non-lte corrections to the [c/o] ratio whichhave not been taken into account. however, its potential importance as a windowon the nucleosynthesis by population iii stars is a strong incentive for futurework, both observational and theoretical, to verify its reality.

astro-ph;0410475	the impact of non-lte effects and granulation inhomogeneities on the  derived iron and oxygen abundances in metal-poor halo stars	this paper presents the results of a detailed theoretical investigation ofthe impact of non-lte effects and of granulation inhomogeneities on the derivediron and oxygen abundances in the metal-poor halo subgiant hd140283. ouranalysis is based on both the `classical' one-dimensional (1d) stellaratmosphere models and on the new generation of three-dimensional (3d)hydrodynamical models. we find that the non-lte effects on the iron abundancederived from fe {\sc i} lines are very important, amounting to ${\sim}0.9$ dexand to ${\sim}0.6$ dex in the 3d and 1d cases, respectively. on the other hand,we find that non-lte and 3d effects have to be taken into account for areliable determination of the iron abundance from weak fe {\sc ii} lines,because the significant overexcitation of their upper levels in the granularregions tend to produce emission features. as a result such fe {\sc ii} linesare weaker than in lte and the abundance correction amounts to ${\sim}0.4$ dexfor the 3d case. we derive also the oxygen-to-iron abundance ratio in themetal-poor star hd140283 by using the o {\sc i} triplet at 7772--5 \aa and theforbidden [o {\sc i}] line at 6300 \aa. interestingly, when both non-lte and 3deffects are taken into account there still remains significant discrepancies inthe iron abundances derived from fe {\sc i} and fe {\sc ii} lines, as well asin the oxygen abundances inferred from the o {\sc i} and [o {\sc i}] lines. weconclude that the metalicity of this type of metal-poor stars could besignificantly larger than previously thought, which may have far-reachingimplications in stellar astrophysics.

astro-ph;0503497	detection of near-ir co absorption bands in r coronae borealis stars	r coronae borealis (rcb) stars are hydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich pulsatingpost-agb stars that experience massive irregular declines in brightness causedby circumstellar dust formation. the mechanism of dust formation around rcbstars is not well understood. it has been proposed that co molecules play animportant role in cooling the circumstellar gas so that dust may form. wereport on a survey for co in a sample of rcb stars. we obtained h- and k-bandspectra including the first and second overtone co bands for eight rcb stars,the rcb-like star, dy per and the final-helium-flash star, fg sge. the firstand second overtone co bands were detected in the cooler (t(eff)&lt;6000 k) rcbstars, z umi, es aql, sv sge and dy per. the bands are not present in thewarmer (t(eff)&gt;6000 k) rcb stars, r crb, ry sgr, su tau, xx cam. in addition,first overtone bands are seen in fg sge, a final-helium-flash star that is inan rcb-like phase at present. effective temperatures of the eight rcb starsrange from 4000 to 7250 k. the observed photospheric co absorption bands werecompared to line-blanketed model spectra of rcb stars. as predicted by themodels, the co bands are strongest in the coolest rcb stars and not present inthe warmest. no correlation was found between the presence or strength of theco bands and dust formation activity in the stars.

astro-ph;0505118	chemical abundances in 43 metal-poor stars	we have derived abundances of o, na, mg, al, si, ca, sc, ti, v, cr, fe, niand ba for 43 metal-poor field stars in the solar neighbourhood with ironabundances [fe/h] ranging from -0.4 to -3.0. total abundance errors areestimated to about 0.1-0.2 dex for most elements, while relative abundances aremost probably more accurate. we have made an extensive comparison with othersimilar studies and traced the reasons for the, in most cases, relatively smalldifferences.  among the results we note the following: we find [o/fe] from the o i ir-triplet lines to possibly increase beyond [fe/h]=-1.0, though considerably lessthan obtained by others from abundances based on oh lines. we find correlationsamong the deviations for individual stars from the trends of individual alphaelements relative to fe. this may support the idea that the formation of thehalo stars occurred in smaller systems with different star formation rates. weverify the finding by gratton et al. (2003b) that stars that do not participatein the rotation of the galactic disk show a lower mean and larger spread in[alpha/fe] than stars participating in the general rotation. the latter starsalso seem to show some correlation between [alpha/fe] and rotation speed. wefinally advocate that a spectroscopic study of a larger sample of halo starswith well-defined selection criteria is very important, in addition to the veryconsiderable efforts that various groups have already made.

astro-ph;0507375	effects of line-blocking on the non-lte fe i spectral line formation	the effects of background line opacity (line-blocking) in statisticalequilibrium calculations for fe in late-type stellar atmospheres have beeninvestigated using an extensive and up-to-date model atom with radiative dataprimarily from the iron project. the background metal line opacities have beencomputed using data from the marcs stellar model atmospheres.  while accounting for this line opacity is important at solar metallicity, thedifferences between calculations including and excluding line-blocking at lowmetallicity are insignificant for the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium(non-lte) abundance corrections for fe i lines. the line-blocking has no impacton the non-lte effects of fe ii lines. the dominant uncertainty in fe non-ltecalculations for metal-poor stars is still the treatment of the inelastic h icollisions, which have here been included using scaling factors to theclassical drawin formalism, and whether or not thermalisation of the high fe ilevels to fe ii ground state should be enforced. without such thermalisation,the fe i non-lte abundance corrections are substantial in metal-poor stars:about 0.3 dex with efficient (i.e. drawin-like) h i collisions and about 0.5dex without. without both thermalisation and h i collisions, even fe ii linesshow significant non-lte effects in such stars.

astro-ph;0510636	lithium isotopic abundances in metal-poor halo stars	very high-quality spectra of 24 metal-poor halo dwarfs and subgiants havebeen acquired with eso's vlt/uves for the purpose of determining li isotopicabundances. the derived 1d, non-lte 7li abundances from the lii 670.8nm linereveal a pronounced dependence on metallicity but with negligible scatteraround this trend. very good agreement is found between the abundances from thelii 670.8nm line and the lii 610.4nm line. the estimated primordial 7liabundance is $7li/h = 1.1-1.5 x 10^-10, which is a factor of three to fourlower than predicted from standard big bang nucleosynthesis with the baryondensity inferred from the cosmic microwave background. interestingly, 6li isdetected in nine of our 24 stars at the &gt;2sigma significance level. ourobservations suggest the existence of a 6li plateau at the level of log 6li =0.8; however, taking into account predictions for 6li destruction during thepre-main sequence evolution tilts the plateau such that the 6li abundancesapparently increase with metallicity. our most noteworthy result is thedetection of 6li in the very metal-poor star lp815-43. such a high 6liabundance during these early galactic epochs is very difficult to achieve bygalactic cosmic ray spallation and alpha-fusion reactions. it is concluded thatboth li isotopes have a pre-galactic origin. possible 6li production channelsinclude proto-galactic shocks and late-decaying or annihilating supersymmetricparticles during the era of big bang nucleosynthesis. the presence of 6lilimits the possible degree of stellar 7li depletion and thus sharpens thediscrepancy with standard big bang nucleosynthesis.

astro-ph;0512543	the oxygen abundance of he 1327-2326	from a newly obtained vlt/uves spectrum we have determined the oxygenabundance of he 1327-2326, the most iron-poor star known to date. uv-oh linesyield a 1d lte abundance of [o/fe]_oh = 3.7 (subgiant case) and [o/fe]_oh = 3.4(dwarf case). using a correction of -1.0 dex to account for 3d effects on ohline formation, the abundances are lowered to [o/fe] = 2.8 and [o/fe] = 2.5,respectively, which we adopt. without 3d corrections, the uv-oh based abundancewould be in disagreement with the upper limits derived from the oi tripletlines: [o/fe]_trip &lt; 2.8 (subgiant) and [o/fe]_trip &lt; 3.0 (dwarf). we alsocorrect the previously determined carbon and nitrogen abundances for 3deffects. knowledge of the o abundance of he 1327-2326 has implications for theinterpretation of its abundance pattern. a large o abundance is in accordancewith he 1327-2326 being an early population ii star which formed from materialchemically enriched by a first generation supernova. our derived abundances,however, do not exclude other possibilities such as a population iii scenario.

astro-ph;0605116	line formation in solar granulation vii. co lines and the solar c and o  isotopic abundances	co spectral line formation in the sun has long been a source of consternationfor solar physicists, as have the elemental abundances it seems to imply. wemodelled solar co line formation using a realistic, ab initio, time-dependent3d radiative-hydrodynamic model atmosphere. results were compared withobservations from the space-based atmos experiment. we employed weak 12c16o,13c16o and 12c18o lines from the fundamental and first overtone bands todetermine the solar carbon abundance, as well as the 12c/13c and 16o/18oisotopic ratios. a weighted carbon abundance of log epsilonc = 8.39 +-0.05 wasfound. we note with satisfaction that the derived abundance is identical to ourrecent 3d determination based on ci, [c i], c2 and ch lines. identicalcalculations were carried out using 1d models, but only the 3d model was ableto produce abundance agreement between different co lines and the other atomicand molecular diagnostics. solar 12c/13c and 16o/18o ratios were measured as86.8+3.9-3.7 (delta13c = 30+46-44) and 479+29-28 (delta18o = 41+67-59),respectively. these values may require current theories of solar systemformation to be revised. excellent agreement was seen between observed andpredicted weak co line shapes, without invoking micro- or macroturbulence.agreement breaks down for the strongest co lines however, which are formed invery high atmospheric layers. the simplest explanation is that temperatures areoverestimated in the highest layers of the 3d simulation. thus, our analysissupports the presence of a comosphere above the traditional photospherictemperature minimum, with an average temperature of less than 4000k. theshortcoming of the model atmosphere is not surprising, given that it was neverintended to properly describe such high layers.

astro-ph;0703453	very large excesses of 18o in hydrogen-deficient carbon and r coronae  borealis stars: evidence for white dwarf mergers	we have found that at least seven hydrogen-deficient carbon (hdc) and rcoronae borealis (rcb) stars, have 16o/18o ratios close to and in some casesless than unity, values that are orders of magnitude lower than measured inother stars (the solar value is 500). greatly enhanced 18o is evident in everyhdc and rcb we have measured that is cool enough to have detectable co bands.the three hdc stars measured have 16o/18o &lt; 1, lower values than any of the rcbstars. these discoveries are important clues in determining the evolutionarypathways of hdc and rcb stars, for which two models have been proposed: thedouble degenerate (white dwarf (wd) merger), and the final helium-shell flash(ff). no overproduction of 18o is expected in the ff scenario. we havequantitatively explored the idea that hdc and rcb stars originate in themergers of co- and he-wds. the merger process is estimated to take only a fewdays, with accretion rates of 150 msun/ yr producing temperatures at the baseof the accreted envelope of 1.2 - 1.9 x 10^8 k. analysis of a simplifiedone-zone calculation shows that nucleosynthesis in the dynamically accretingmaterial may provide a suitable environment for a significant production of18o, leading to very low values of 16o/18o, similar to those observed. we alsofind qualitative agreement with observed values of 12c/13c and with the cnoelemental ratios. h-admixture during the accretion process from the smallh-rich c/o wd envelope may play an important role in producing the observedabundances. overall our analysis shows that wd mergers may very well be theprogenitors of o18-rich rcb and hdc stars, and that more detailed simulationsand modeling are justified.

astro-ph;0703652	3d hydrodynamical simulations of surface convection in red giant stars.  impact on spectral line formation and abundance analysis	we investigate the impact of 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres of red giantstars at different metallicities on the formation of spectral lines of a numberof ions and molecules. we carry out realistic 3d simulations of surfaceconvection in red giant stars with varying stellar parameters. we use thesimulations as time-dependent hydrodynamical model stellar atmospheres tocompute atomic (li, o, na, mg, ca, fe) and molecular (ch, nh, oh) spectrallines under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (lte). we comparethe line strengths computed in 3d with the results of analogous line formationcalculations for 1d, hydrostatic, plane-parallel marcs model atmospheres inorder to estimate the impact of 3d models on the derivation of elementalabundances. the temperature and density inhomogeneities and correlatedvelocities in 3d models, as well as the differences between the 1d and mean 3dstructures significantly affect the predicted line strengths. under theassumption of lte, the low atmospheric temperatures of very metal-poor 3d modelatmospheres cause the lines from neutral species and molecules to appearstronger than in 1d. therefore, elemental abundances derived from these linesusing 3d models are significantly lower than according to 1d analyses.differences between 3d and 1d abundances of c, n, and o derived from ch, nh,and oh weak low-excitation lines are found to be in the range -0.5 dex to -1.0dex for the the red giant stars at [fe/h]=-3 considered here. at thismetallicity, large negative corrections (about -0.8 dex) are also found forweak low-excitation fe i lines. we caution, however, that departures from ltemight be significant for these and other elements and comparable to the effectsdue to stellar granulation.

0811.0815	on the solar nickel and oxygen abundances	determinations of the solar oxygen content relying on the neutral forbiddentransition at 630 nm depend upon the nickel abundance, due to a ni i blend.here we rederive the solar nickel abundance, using the same ab initio 3dhydrodynamic model of the solar photosphere employed in the recent revision ofthe abundances of c, n, o and other elements. using 17 weak, unblended lines ofni i together with the most accurate atomic and observational data available wefind log epsilon_ni = 6.17 +/- 0.02 (statistical) +/- 0.05 (systematic), adownwards shift of 0.06 to 0.08 dex relative to previous 1d-based abundances.we investigate the implications of the new nickel abundance for studies of thesolar oxygen abundance based on the [o i] 630 nm line in the quiet sun.furthermore, we demonstrate that the oxygen abundance implied by the recentsunspot spectropolarimetric study of centeno &amp; socas-navarro needs to berevised downwards from log epsilon_o = 8.86 +/- 0.07 to 8.71 +/- 0.10. thisrevision is based on the new nickel abundance, application of the bestavailable gf-value for the 630 nm forbidden oxygen line, and a more transparenttreatment of co formation. determinations of the solar oxygen content relyingon forbidden lines now appear to converge around log epsilon_o = 8.7.
