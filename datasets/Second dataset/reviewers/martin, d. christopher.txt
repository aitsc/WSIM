0903.3015	the star formation law at low surface density	we investigate the nature of the star formation law at low gas surfacedensities using a sample of 19 low surface brightness (lsb) galaxies withexisting hi maps in the literature, uv imaging from the galaxy evolutionexplorer satellite, and optical images from the sloan digital sky survey. allof the lsb galaxies have (nuv-r) colors similar to those for higher surfacebrightness star-forming galaxies of similar luminosity indicating that theiraverage star formation histories are not very different. based upon four lsbgalaxies with both uv and fir data, we find fir/uv ratios significantly lessthan one, implying low amounts of internal uv extinction in lsb galaxies. weuse the uv images and hi maps to measure the star formation rate and hydrogengas surface densities within the same region for all of the galaxies. the lsbgalaxy star formation rate surface densities lie below the extrapolation of thepower law fit to the star formation rate surface density as a function of thetotal gas density for higher surface brightness galaxies. although there ismore scatter, the lsb galaxies also lie below a second version of the starformation law in which the star formation rate surface density is correlatedwith the gas density divided by the orbital time in the disk. the downturn seenin both star formation laws is consistent with theoretical models that predictlower star formation efficiencies in lsb galaxies due to the decliningmolecular fraction with decreasing density.

0706.3424	keck/deimos spectroscopy of a galex uv selecte sample from the medium  imaging survey	we report results from a pilot program to obtain spectroscopy for objectsdetected in the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) medium imaging survey (mis).our study examines the properties of galaxies detected by galex fainter thanthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) spectroscopic survey. this is the firststudy to extend the techinques of salim et al. 2005 to estimate stellar masses,star formation rates (sfr) and the b (star formation history) parameter forstar-forming galaxies out to z~0.7. we obtain redshifts for 50 galex missources reaching nuv=23.9 (ab mag), having counterparts in the sdss datarelease 4 (dr4). of our sample, 43 are starforming galaxies with z&lt;0.7, 3 haveemission line ratios indicative of agn with z&lt;0.7, and 4 objects with z~1 areqsos, 3 of which are not previously cataloged. we compare our sample to a muchlarger sample of ~50,000 matched galex/sdss galaxies with sdss spectroscopy;while our survey is shallow, the optical counterparts to our sources reach ~3magnitudes fainter in sdss r magnitude than the sdss spectroscopic sample. weuse emission line diagnostics for the galaxies to determine that the samplecontains mostly star-forming galaxies. the galaxies in the sample populate theblue sequence in the nuv-r vs m_r color-magnitude diagram. our sample has sfrs,luminosities, and velocity dispersions that are similar to the samples of faintcompact blue galaxies studied previously in the same redshift range by koo et.al 1995, guzman et. al 1996 &amp; phillips et. al 1997. however, our sample is ~2mag fainter in surface brightness than the compact blue galaxies. we find thatthe star-formation histories for a majority of the galaxies are consistent witha recent starburst within the last 100 myr.

0706.3938	the uv-optical galaxy color-magnitude diagram i: basic properties	we have analyzed the bivariate distribution of galaxies as a function ofultraviolet-optical colors and absolute magnitudes in the local universe. thesample consists of galaxies with redshifts and optical photometry from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) main galaxy sample matched with detections inthe near-ultraviolet (nuv) and far-ultraviolet (fuv) bands in the mediumimaging survey being carried out by the galaxy evolution explorer (galex)satellite. in the (nuv-r)_{0.1} vs. m_{r,0.1} galaxy color-magnitude diagram,the galaxies separate into two well-defined blue and red sequences. the(nuv-r)_{0.1} color distribution at each m_{r,0.1} is not well fit by the sumof two gaussians due to an excess of galaxies in between the two sequences. thepeaks of both sequences become redder with increasing luminosity with adistinct blue peak visible up to m_{r,0.1}\sim-23. the r_{0.1}-band luminosityfunctions vary systematically with color, with the faint end slope andcharacteristic luminosity gradually increasing with color. after correcting forattenuation due to dust, we find that approximately one quarter of the colorvariation along the blue sequence is due to dust with the remainder due to starformation history and metallicity. finally, we present the distribution ofgalaxies as a function of specific star formation rate and stellar mass. thespecific star formation rates imply that galaxies along the blue sequenceprogress from low mass galaxies with star formation rates that increasesomewhat with time to more massive galaxies with a more or less constant starformation rate. above a stellar mass of ~10^10.5 m_{sun}, galaxies with lowratios of current to past averaged star formation rate begin to dominate.

0707.1878	the young and the dustless: interpreting radio observations of  ultraviolet luminous galaxies	ultraviolet luminous galaxies (uvlgs) have been identified as intenselystar-forming, nearby galaxies. a subset of these, the supercompact uvlgs, arebelieved to be local analogs of high redshift lyman break galaxies. here weinvestigate the radio continuum properties of this important population for thefirst time. we have observed 42 supercompact uvlgs with the vla, all of whichhave extensive coverage in the uv/optical by galex and sdss. our analysisincludes comparison samples of multiwavelength data from the spitzer first looksurvey and from the sdss-galex matched catalogs. in addition we have spitzermips data for 24 of our galaxies and find that they fall on the radio-fircorrelation of normal star-forming galaxies. we find that our galaxies havelower radio-to-uv ratios and lower balmer decrements than other local galaxieswith similar (high) star formation rates. optical spectra show they have lowerdn(4000) and hdeltaa indices, higher hbeta emission-line equivalents widths,and higher [oiii]5007/hbeta emission-line ratios than normal star forminggalaxies. comparing these results to galaxy spectral evolution models weconclude that supercompact uvlgs are distinguished from normal star forminggalaxies firstly by their high specific star formation rates. moreover,compared to other types of galaxies with similar star formation rates, theyhave significantly less dust attenuation. in both regards they are similar tolyman break galaxies. this suggests that the process that causes star formationin the supercompact uvlgs differs from other local star forming galaxies, butmay be similar to lyman break galaxies.

0911.0690	the local hosts of type ia supernovae	we use multi-wavelength, matched aperture, integrated photometry from galex,sdss and the rc3 to estimate the physical properties of 166 nearby galaxieshosting 168 well-observed type ia supernovae (sne ia). our data corroboratewell-known features that have been seen in other sn ia samples. specifically,hosts with active star formation produce brighter and slower sne ia on average,and hosts with luminosity-weighted ages older than 1 gyr produce on averagemore faint, fast and fewer bright, slow sne ia than younger hosts. new resultsinclude that in our sample, the faintest and fastest sne ia occur only ingalaxies exceeding a stellar mass threshhold of ~10^10 m_sun, indicating thattheir progenitors must arise in populations that are older and/or more metalrich than the general sn ia population. a low host extinction sub-sample hintsat a residual trend in peak luminosity with host age, after correcting forlight-curve shape, giving the appearance that older hosts produceless-extincted sne ia on average. this has implications for cosmologicalfitting of sne ia and suggests that host age could be useful as a parameter inthe fitting. converting host mass to metallicity and computing 56ni mass fromthe supernova light curves, we find that our local sample is consistent with amodel that predicts a shallow trend between stellar metallicity and the 56nimass that powers the explosion, but we cannot rule out the absence of a trend.we measure a correlation between 56ni mass and host age in the local universethat is shallower and not as significant as that seen at higher redshifts. thedetails of the age -- 56ni mass correlations at low and higher redshift imply aluminosity-weighted age threshhold of ~3 gyr for sn ia hosts, above which theyare less likely to produce sne ia with 56ni masses above ~0.5 m_sun.

1004.3382	the uv-optical color dependence of galaxy clustering in the local  universe	we measure the uv-optical color dependence of galaxy clustering in the localuniverse. using the clean separation of the red and blue sequences madepossible by the nuv - r color-magnitude diagram, we segregate the galaxies intored, blue and intermediate "green" classes. we explore the clustering as afunction of this segregation by removing the dependence on luminosity and byexcluding edge-on galaxies as a means of a non-model dependent veto of highlyextincted galaxies. we find that \xi (r_p, \pi) for both red and green galaxiesshows strong redshift space distortion on small scales -- the "finger-of-god"effect, with green galaxies having a lower amplitude than is seen for the redsequence, and the blue sequence showing almost no distortion. on large scales,\xi (r_p, \pi) for all three samples show the effect of large-scale streamingfrom coherent infall. on scales 1 mpc/h &lt; r_p &lt; 10 mpc/h, the projectedauto-correlation function w_p(r_p) for red and green galaxies fits a power-lawwith slope \gamma ~ 1.93 and amplitude r_0 ~ 7.5 and 5.3, compared with \gamma~ 1.75 and r_0 ~ 3.9 mpc/h for blue sequence galaxies. compared to theclustering of a fiducial l* galaxy, the red, green, and blue have a relativebias of 1.5, 1.1, and 0.9 respectively. the w_p(r_p) for blue galaxies displayan increase in convexity at ~ 1 mpc/h, with an excess of large scaleclustering. our results suggest that the majority of blue galaxies are likelycentral galaxies in less massive halos, while red and green galaxies havelarger satellite fractions, and preferentially reside in virialized structures.if blue sequence galaxies migrate to the red sequence via processes likemergers or quenching that take them through the green valley, such atransformation may be accompanied by a change in environment in addition to anychange in luminosity and color.

1011.6098	dust attenuation in uv-selected starbursts at high redshift and their  local counterparts: implications for the cosmic star formation rate density	we present a new analysis of the dust obscuration in starburst galaxies atlow and high redshift. this study is motivated by our unique sample of the mostextreme uv-selected starburst galaxies in the nearby universe (z&lt;0.3), found tobe good analogs of high-redshift lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in most of theirphysical properties. we find that the dust properties of the lyman breakanalogs (lbas) are consistent with the relation derived previously by meurer etal. (m99) that is commonly used to dust-correct star formation ratemeasurements at a very wide range of redshifts. we directly compare our resultswith high redshift samples (lbgs, bzk, and sub-mm galaxies at z=2-3) having irdata either from spitzer or herschel. the attenuation in typical lbgs at z=2-3and lbas is very similar. because lbas are much better analogs to lbgs comparedto previous local star-forming samples, including m99, the practice ofdust-correcting the sfrs of high redshift galaxies based on the localcalibration is now placed on a much more solid ground. we illustrate theimportance of this result by showing how the locally calibrated relationbetween uv measurements and extinction is used to estimate the integrated,dust-corrected star formation rate density at z=2-6.

1101.6051	the recent star formation in ngc 6822: an ultraviolet study	we characterize the star formation in the low-metallicity galaxy ngc 6822over the past few hundred million years, using galex far-uv (fuv, 1344-1786 a)and near-uv (nuv, 1771-2831 a) imaging, and ground-based ha imaging. from galexfuv image, we define 77 star-forming (sf) regions with area &gt;860 pc^2, andsurface brightness &lt;=26.8 mag(ab)arcsec^-2, within 0.2deg (1.7kpc) of thecenter of the galaxy. we estimate the extinction by interstellar dust in eachsf region from resolved photometry of the hot stars it contains: e(b-v) rangesfrom the minimum foreground value of 0.22mag up to 0.66+-0.21mag. theintegrated fuv and nuv photometry, compared with stellar population models,yields ages of the sf complexes up to a few hundred myr, and masses from 2x10^2msun to 1.5x10^6 msun. the derived ages and masses strongly depend on theassumed type of interstellar selective extinction, which we find to vary acrossthe galaxy. the total mass of the fuv-defined sf regions translates into anaverage star formation rate (sfr) of 1.4x10^-2 msun/yr over the past 100 myr,and sfr=1.0x10^-2 msun/yr in the most recent 10 myr. the latter is in agreementwith the value that we derive from the ha luminosity, sfr=0.008 msun/yr. thesfr in the most recent epoch becomes higher if we add the sfr=0.02 msun/yrinferred from far-ir measurements, which trace star formation still embedded indust (age &lt;= a few myr).

0709.3304	hst morphologies of local lyman break galaxy analogs i: evidence for  starbursts triggered by merging	heckman et al. (2005) used the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) uv imagingsurvey to show that there exists a rare population of nearby compactuv-luminous galaxies (uvlgs) that closely resembles high redshift lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs). we present hst images in the uv, optical, and ha, andresimulate them at the depth and resolution of the goods/udf fields to showthat the morphologies of uvlgs are also similar to those of lbgs. our sample of8 lbg analogs thus provides detailed insight into the connection between starformation and lbg morphology. faint tidal features or companions can be seen inall of the rest-frame optical images, suggesting that the starbursts are theresult of a merger or interaction. the uv/optical light is dominated byunresolved (~100-300 pc) super starburst regions (ssbs). a detailed comparisonwith the galaxies haro 11 and vv 114 at z=0.02 indicates that the ssbsthemselves consist of diffuse stars and (super) star clusters. the structuralfeatures revealed by the new hst images occur on very small physical scales andare thus not detectable in images of high redshift lbgs, except in a few caseswhere they are magnified by gravitational lensing. we propose, therefore, thatlbgs are mergers of gas-rich, relatively low-mass (~10^10 msun) systems, andthat the mergers trigger the formation of ssbs. if galaxies at high redshiftsare dominated by ssbs, then the faint end slope of the luminosity function ispredicted to have slope alpha~2. our results are the most direct confirmationto date of models that predict that the main mode of star formation in theearly universe was highly collisional.

0704.3611	uv star formation rates in the local universe	we measure star formation rates of ~50,000 optically-selected galaxies in thelocal universe (z~0.1), spanning a range from gas-rich dwarfs to massiveellipticals. we obtain dust-corrected sfrs by fitting the galex (uv) and sdss(optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that includedust attenuation. for star-forming galaxies, our uv-based sfrs compareremarkably well with those derived from sdss h alpha. deviations from perfectagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dustattenuation estimates. in contrast to h alpha, uv provides reliable sfrs forgalaxies with weak or no h alpha emission, and where h alpha is contaminatedwith an emission from an agn. we use full-sed sfrs to calibrate a simpleprescription that uses galex uv magnitudes to produce good sfrs for normalstar-forming galaxies. the specific sfr is considered as a function of stellarmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no agn, (2) those hosting an agn, andfor (3) galaxies without h alpha emission. we find that the three have distinctstar formation histories, with agn lying intermediate between the star-formingand the quiescent galaxies. normal star forming galaxies (without an agn) lieon a relatively narrow linear sequence. remarkably, galaxies hosting a strongagn appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. weak agn,while also massive, have lower sfr, sometimes extending to the realm ofquiescent galaxies. we propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxiesthat smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence)galaxies via strong and weak agn. we confirm that some galaxies with no h alphaemission show signs of sf in the uv. we derive a uv-based cosmic sfr density atz=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).

1209.4084	quenching star formation at intermediate redshifts: downsizing of the  mass flux density in the green valley	the bimodality in galaxy properties has been observed at low and highredshift, with a clear distinction between star-forming galaxies in the bluecloud and passively evolving objects in the red sequence; the absence ofgalaxies with intermediate properties indicates that the quenching of starformation and subsequent transition between populations must happen rapidly. inthis paper, we present a study of over 100 transiting galaxies in the so-called"green valley" at intermediate redshifts (z ~ 0.8). by using very deepspectroscopy with the deimos instrument at the keck telescope we are able toinfer the star formation histories of these objects and measure the stellarmass flux density transiting from the blue cloud to the red sequence when theuniverse was half its current age. our results indicate that the processhappened more rapidly and for more massive galaxies in the past, suggesting atop-down scenario in which the massive end of the red sequence is formingfirst. this represent another aspect of downsizing, with the mass flux densitymoving towards smaller galaxies in recent times.

1210.2130	the wigglez dark energy survey: final data release and cosmological  results	this paper presents cosmological results from the final data release of thewigglez dark energy survey. we perform full analyses of different cosmologicalmodels using the wigglez power spectra measured at z=0.22, 0.41, 0.60, and0.78, combined with other cosmological datasets. the limiting factor in thisanalysis is the theoretical modelling of the galaxy power spectrum, includingnon-linearities, galaxy bias, and redshift-space distortions. in this paper weassess several different methods for modelling the theoretical power spectrum,testing them against the gigaparsec wigglez simulations (gigglez). we fit for abase set of 6 cosmological parameters, {omega_b h^2, omega_cdm h^2, h_0, tau,a_s, n_s}, and 5 supplementary parameters {n_run, r, w, omega_k, sum m_nu}. incombination with the cosmic microwave background (cmb), our results areconsistent with the lambdacdm concordance cosmology, with a measurement of thematter density of omega_m =0.29 +/- 0.016 and amplitude of fluctuations sigma_8= 0.825 +/- 0.017. using wigglez data with cmb and other distance and matterpower spectra data, we find no evidence for any of the extension parametersbeing inconsistent with their lambdacdm model values. the power spectra dataand theoretical modelling tools are available for use as a module for cosmomc,which we here make publicly available at http://smp.uq.edu.au/wigglez-data . wealso release the data and random catalogues used to construct the baryonacoustic oscillation correlation function.

0712.3051	ultraviolet, optical, and infrared constraints on models of stellar  populations and dust attenuation	the color of galaxies is a fundamental property, easily measured, thatconstrains models of galaxies and their evolution. dust attenuation and starformation history (sfh) are the dominant factors affecting the color ofgalaxies. here we explore the empirical relation between sfh, attenuation, andcolor for a wide range of galaxies, including early types. these galaxies havebeen observed by galex, sdss, and spitzer, allowing the construction ofmeasures of dust attenuation from the ratio of infrared (ir) to ultraviolet(uv) flux and measures of sfh from the strength of the 4000a break. theempirical relation between these three quantities is compared to models thatseparately predict the effects of dust and sfh on color. this comparisondemonstrates the quantitative consistency of these simple models with the dataand hints at the power of multiwavelength data for constraining these models.the uv color is a strong constraint; we find that a milky way extinction curveis disfavored, and that the uv emission of galaxies with large 4000a breakstrengths is likely to arise from evolved populations. we perform fits to therelation between sfh, attenuation, and color. this relation links theproduction of starlight and its absorption by dust to the subsequent reemissionof the absorbed light in the ir. galaxy models that self-consistently treatdust absorption and emission as well as stellar populations will need toreproduce these fitted relations in the low-redshift universe.

1302.5178	the wigglez dark energy survey: measuring the cosmic growth rate with  the two-point galaxy correlation function	the growth history of large-scale structure in the universe is a powerfulprobe of the cosmological model, including the nature of dark energy. we studythe growth rate of cosmic structure to redshift $z = 0.9$ using more than$162{,}000$ galaxy redshifts from the wigglez dark energy survey. we divide thedata into four redshift slices with effective redshifts $z =[0.2,0.4,0.6,0.76]$ and in each of the samples measure and model the 2-pointgalaxy correlation function in parallel and transverse directions to theline-of-sight. after simultaneously fitting for the galaxy bias factor werecover values for the cosmic growth rate which are consistent with our assumed$\lambda$cdm input cosmological model, with an accuracy of around 20% in eachredshift slice. we investigate the sensitivity of our results to the details ofthe assumed model and the range of physical scales fitted, making closecomparison with a set of n-body simulations for calibration. our measurementsare consistent with an independent power-spectrum analysis of a similardataset, demonstrating that the results are not driven by systematic errors. wedetermine the pairwise velocity dispersion of the sample in a non-parametricmanner, showing that it systematically increases with decreasing redshift, andinvestigate the alcock-paczynski effects of changing the assumed fiducial modelon the results. our techniques should prove useful for current and futuregalaxy surveys mapping the growth rate of structure using the 2-dimensionalcorrelation function.

0712.3555	a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxies in the local  universe	we have initiated a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxiesin the local universe. herein, we compare galex uv and visible--nir images of189 nearby (d$&lt;$40 mpc) s0--sm galaxies included in the galex atlas of nearbygalaxies and present the first catalogue of xuv-disk galaxies. we find thatxuv-disk galaxies are surprisingly common but have varied relative (uv/optical)extent and morphology. type~1 objects ($\ga$20% incidence) have structured,uv-bright/optically-faint emission features in the outer disk, beyond thetraditional star formation threshold. type~2 xuv-disk galaxies ($\sim$10%incidence) exhibit an exceptionally large,uv-bright/optically-low-surface-brightness (lsb) zone having blue $uv-k_s$outside the effective extent of the inner, older stellar population, but notreaching extreme galactocentric distance. if the activity occuring in xuv-disksis episodic, a higher fraction of present-day spirals could be influenced bysuch outer disk star formation. type~1 disks are associated with spirals of alltypes, whereas type~2 xuv-disks are predominantly found in late-type spirals.type~2 xuv-disks are forming stars quickly enough to double their [presentlylow] stellar mass in the next gyr (assuming a constant sf rate). xuv-diskgalaxies of both types are systematically more gas-rich than the general galaxypopulation. minor external perturbation may stimulate xuv-disk incidence, atleast for type~1 objects. xuv-disks are the most actively evolving galaxiesgrowing via inside-out disk formation in the current epoch, and may constitutea segment of the galaxy population experiencing significant, continued gasaccretion from the intergalactic medium or neighboring objects.

0712.3573	ultraviolet through infrared spectral energy distributions from 1000  sdss galaxies: dust attenuation	the meaningful comparison of models of galaxy evolution to observations iscritically dependent on the accurate treatment of dust attenuation. toinvestigate dust absorption and emission in galaxies we have assembled a sampleof ~1000 galaxies with ultraviolet (uv) through infrared (ir) photometry fromgalex, sdss, and spitzer and optical spectroscopy from sdss. the ratio of ir touv emission (irx) is used to constrain the dust attenuation in galaxies. we usethe 4000a break as a robust and useful, although coarse, indicator of starformation history (sfh). we examine the relationship between irx and the uvspectral slope (a common attenuation indicator at high-redshift) and findlittle dependence of the scatter on 4000a break strength. we construct averageuv through far-ir spectral energy distributions (seds) for different ranges ofirx, 4000a break strength, and stellar mass (m_*) to show the variation of theentire sed with these parameters. when binned simultaneously by irx, 4000abreak strength, and m_* these seds allow us to determine a low resolutionaverage attenuation curve for different ranges of m_*. the attenuation curvesthus derived are consistent with a lambda^{-0.7} attenuation law, and we findno significant variations with m_*. finally, we show the relationship betweenirx and the global stellar mass surface density and gas-phase-metallicity.among star forming galaxies we find a strong correlation between irx andstellar mass surface density, even at constant metallicity, a result that isclosely linked to the well-known correlation between irx and star-formationrate.

astro-ph;0604058	uv and fir selected star-forming galaxies at z=0: differences and  overlaps	we study two samples of local galaxies, one is uv (galex) selected and theother fir (iras) selected, to address the question whether uv and fir surveyssee the two sides ('bright' and 'dark') of the star formation of the samepopulation of galaxies or two different populations of star forming galaxies.no significant difference between the l$_{tot}$ ($=l_{60}+l_{fuv}$) luminosityfunctions of the uv and fir samples is found. also, after the correction forthe `malmquist bias' (bias for flux limited samples), the fir-to-uv ratio v.s.l$_{tot}$ relations of the two samples are consistent with each other. in therange of $9 \la \log(l_{tot}/l_\sun) \la 12$, both can be approximated by asimple linear relation of $\log (l_{60}/l_{fuv})=\log(l_{tot}/l_\sun)-9.66$.these are consistent with the hypothesis that the two samples represent thesame population of star forming galaxies, and their well documented differencesin l$_{tot}$ and in fir-to-uv ratio are due only to the selection effect. acomparison between the uv luminosity functions shows marginal evidence for apopulation of faint uv galaxies missing in the fir selected sample. thecontribution from these 'fir-quiet' galaxies to the overall uv population isinsignificant, given that the k-band luminosity functions (i.e. the stellarmass functions) of the two samples do not show any significant difference.

astro-ph;0605328	the detection of m-dwarf uv flare events in the galex data archives	we present the preliminary results from implementing a new software tool thatenables inspection of time-tagged photon data for the astronomical sourcescontained within individual galex ultraviolet images of the sky. we haveinspected the photon data contained within 1802 galex images to reveal rapid,short-term (&lt;500 sec) uv source variability in the form of stellar flares. themean associated change in nuv magnitude due to this flaring activity is2.7+/-0.3 mag. a list of 49 new uv variable-star candidates is presented,together with their associated sloan digital sky survey (sdss) photometricmagnitudes. from these data we can associate the main source of these uv flareevents with magnetic activity on m-dwarf stars. photometric parallaxes havebeen determined for 32 of these sources, placing them at distances ranging fromapproximately 25 to 1000pc. the average uv flare energy for these flare eventsis 2.5e30 ergs, which is of a similar energy to that of u-band, x-ray and euvflares observed on many local m-dwarf stars. we have found that stars ofclasses m0 to m5 flare with energies spanning a far larger range and with anenergy approximately 5 times greater than those of later (m6 to m8) spectraltype.

astro-ph;0608594	galex uv color relations for nearby early-type galaxies	we use galex/optical photometry to construct color-color relationships forearly-type galaxies sorted by morphological type. we have matched objects inthe galex gr1 public release and the first ir1.1 internal release, with the rc3early-type galaxies having a morphological type -5.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5 with mean error int&lt;1.5, and mean error on (b-v)t&lt;0.05. after visual inspection of each match, weare left with 130 galaxies with a reliable galex pipeline photometry in thefar-uv and near-uv bands. this sample is divided into ellipticals (-5.5&lt;t&lt;-3.5)and lenticulars (-3.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5). after correction for the galactic extinction,the color-color diagrams fuv-nuv vs. (b-v)_{tc} are plotted for the twosubsamples. we find a tight anti-correlation between the fuv-nuv and (b-v)_{tc}colors for ellipticals, the uv color getting bluer when the (b-v)_{tc} getredder. this relationship very likely is an extension of the color-metallicityrelationship into the galex nuv band. we suspect that the main source of thecorrelation is metal line blanketing in the nuv band. the fuv-nuv vs b-vcorrelation has larger scatter for lenticular galaxies; we speculate thisreflects the presence of low level star formation. if the latter objects (i.e.those that are blue both in fuv-nuv and b-v) are interpreted as harboringrecent star formation activity, this would be the case for a few percent (~4%)of ellipticals and ~15% of lenticulars; this would make about 10% of early-typegalaxies with residual star formation in our full sample of 130 early-typegalaxies. we also plot fuv-nuv vs. the mg_2 index and central velocitydispersion. we find a tight anti-correlation between fuv-nuv and the mg_2index(...).

astro-ph;0609071	radial variation of attenuation and star formation in the largest  late-type disks observed with galex	for a sample of 43 nearby, late-type galaxies, we have investigated theradial variation of both the current star formation rate and the dust-induceduv light attenuation. to do this we have cross-correlated iras images and galexobservations for each of these galaxies, and compiled observations of the gas(co and hi) and metal-abundance gradients found in the literature. we find thatattenuation correlates with metallicity. we then use the uv profiles, correctedfor attenuation, to study several variants of the schmidt law and conclude thatour results are compatible with a simple law similar to the one of kennicuttbut extending smoothly to lower surface densities, but with considerablescatter. we do not detect an abrupt break in the uv light at the thresholdradius derived from h-alpha data (at which the h-alpha profile shows a breakand beyond which only a few hii regions are usually found). we interpret theh-alpha sudden break not as a change in the star formation regime (as oftensuggested) but as the vanishingly small number of ionizing stars correspondingto low levels of star formation.

astro-ph;0609415	the diverse properties of the most ultraviolet luminous galaxies  discovered by the galaxy evolution explorer	we report on the properties of a sample of ultraviolet luminous galaxies(uvlgs) selected by matching the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) surveys withthe sloan digital sky survey third data release. out of 25362 galaxies between0.0&lt;z&lt;0.3 detected by galex, there are 215 galaxies with l&gt;2x10^10 l_solar at1530 angstroms (observed wavelength). the properties of this population arewell correlated with ultraviolet surface brightness. we find that the galaxieswith low uv surface brightness are primarily large spiral systems with amixture of old and young stellar populations, while the high surface brightnessgalaxies consist primarily of compact starburst systems. in terms of thebehavior of surface brightness with luminosity, size with luminosity, themass-metallicity relation, and other parameters, the compact uvlgs clearlydepart from the trends established by the full sample of galaxies. the subsetof compact uvlgs with the highest surface brightness (``supercompact uvlgs'')have characteristics that are remarkably similar to lyman break galaxies athigher redshift. they are much more luminous than typical localultraviolet-bright starburst galaxies and blue compact dwarf galaxies. theyhave metallicities that are systematically lower than normal galaxies of thesame stellar mass, indicating that they are less chemically evolved. in allthese respects, they are the best local analogs for lyman break galaxies.

astro-ph;0609436	ongoing formation of bulges and black holes in the local universe: new  insights from galex	we analyze a volume-limited sample of massive bulge-dominated galaxies withdata from both the sloan digital sky survey and the galaxy evolution explorer(galex) satellite. the galaxies have central velocity dispersions greater than100 km/s and stellar surface mass densities that lie above the value wheregalaxies transition from actively star forming to passive systems. the sampleis limited to redshifts 0.03&lt;z&lt;0.07. at these distances, the sdss spectrasample the light from the bulge-dominated central regions of the galaxies. thegalex nuv data provide high sensitivity to low rates of global star formationin these systems. our sample of bulge-dominated galaxies exhibits a much largerdispersion in nuv-r colour than in optical g-r colour. nearly all of thegalaxies with bluer nuv-r colours are agn. both galex images and sdss colourprofiles demonstrate that the excess uv light is associated with an extendeddisk. we find that galaxies with red outer regions almost never have a youngbulge or a strong agn. galaxies with blue outer regions have bulges and blackholes that span a wide range in age and accretion rate. galaxies with youngbulges and strongly accreting black holes almost always have blue outer disks.our suggested scenario is one in which the source of gas that builds the bulgeand black hole is a low mass reservoir of cold gas in the disk.the presence ofthis gas is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for bulge and black holegrowth. some mechanism must transport this gas inwards in a time variable way.as the gas in the disk is converted into stars, the galaxies will turn red, butfurther gas infall can bring them back into the blue nuv-r sequence.(abridged)

astro-ph;0612203	galex ultraviolet photometry of globular clusters in m31: three year  results and a catalog	we present ultraviolet (uv) photometry of m31 globular clusters (gcs) foundin 23 galaxy evolution explorer (galex) images covering the entirety of m31. wedetect 485 and 273 gcs (and gc candidates) in the near-ultraviolet (nuv; 2267a) and far-ultraviolet (fuv; 1516 a), respectively. comparing m31 data withthose of galactic gcs in the uv with the aid of population models, we find thatthe age ranges of old gcs in m31 and the galactic halo are similar. threemetal-rich ([fe/h]&gt;-1) gcs in m31 produce significant fuv flux making theirfuv-v colors unusually blue for their metallicities. these are thought to beanalogs of the two peculiar galactic gcs ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 with extendedblue hb stars. based on the models incorporating helium enriched subpopulationsin addition to the majority of the population that have a normal heliumabundance, we suggest that even small fraction of super-helium-richsubpopulations in gcs can reproduce the observed uv bright metal-rich gcs.young clusters in m31 show distinct uv and optical properties from gcs in milkyway. population models indicate that their typical age is less than ~ 2 gyrs. alarge fraction of young gcs have the kinematics of the thin, rapidly rotatingdisk component. however, a subset of the old gcs also shares the thin-diskkinematics of the younger clusters. the existence of young gcs on the outskirtsof m31 disk suggests the occurrence of a significant recent star formation inthe thin-disk of m31. old thin-disk gcs may set constraints on the epoch ofearly formation of the m31 thin-disk. we detect 12 (10) intermediate-age gccandidates in nuv (fuv). we suggest that some of spectroscopically identifiedintermediate-age gcs may not be truly intermediate in age, but rather older gcsthat possess developed hb.

astro-ph;0703281	the ultraviolet-optical color-magnitude diagram iii: constraints on  evolution from the blue to red sequence	we introduce a new quantity, the mass flux density of galaxies evolving fromthe blue sequence to the red sequence. we propose a simple technique forconstraining this mass flux using the volume corrected number density in theextinction-corrected uv-optical color magnitude distribution, the stellar ageindexes h-delta-a and d_n(4000), and a simple prescription for spectralevolution using a quenched star formation history. we exploit the excellentseparation of red and blue sequences in the nuv-r band color-magnitude diagram.the final value we measure, 0.033 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3, is strictly speaking anupper limit due to the possible contributions of bursting, composite, andextincted galaxies. however, it compares favorably with estimates of theaverage mass flux that we make based on the red luminosity function evolutionderived from the deepii and combo-17 surveys (bell et al 2004; faber et al.2005), 0.034 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3. we find that the blue sequence mass hasremained roughly constant since z=1 (mass flux 0.01 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3) but theaverage on-going star formation of 0.037$ m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3 over 0&lt;z&lt;1 isbalanced by mass flux off the blue sequence. we explore the nature of thegalaxies in the transition zone with particular attention to the frequency andimpact of agns. the agn fraction peaks in the transition zone. we findcircumstantial, albeit weak evidence that the quench rates are higher in higherluminosity agns.

astro-ph;0703503	the look-back time evolution of far-ultraviolet flux from the brightest  cluster elliptical galaxies at z &lt; 0.2	we present the galex uv photometry of the elliptical galaxies in abellclusters at moderate redshifts (z &lt; 0.2) for the study of the look-back timeevolution of the uv upturn phenomenon. the brightest elliptical galaxies (m_r &lt;-22) in 12 remote clusters are compared with the nearby giant ellipticalgalaxies of comparable optical luminosity in the fornax and virgo clusters. thesample galaxies presented here appear to be quiescent without signs of massivestar formation or strong nuclear activity, and show smooth, extended profilesin their uv images indicating that the far-uv (fuv) light is mostly produced byhot stars in the underlying old stellar population. compared to theircounterparts in nearby clusters, the fuv flux of cluster giant ellipticalgalaxies at moderate redshifts fades rapidly with ~ 2 gyrs of look-back time,and the observed pace in fuv - v color evolution agrees reasonably well withthe prediction from the population synthesis models where the dominant fuvsource is hot horizontal-branch stars and their progeny. a similar amount ofcolor spread (~ 1 mag) in fuv - v exists among the brightest cluster ellipticalgalaxies at z ~ 0.1, as observed among the nearby giant elliptical galaxies ofcomparable optical luminosity.

0706.0755	the calibration and data products of the galaxy evolution explorer	we describe the calibration status and data products pertaining to the gr2and gr3 data releases of the galaxy evolution explorer (galex). these releaseshave identical pipeline calibrations that are significantly improved over thegr1 data release. galex continues to survey the sky in the far ultraviolet(fuv, ~154 nm) and near ultraviolet (nuv, ~232 nm) bands, providingsimultaneous imaging with a pair of photon counting, microchannel plate, delayline readout detectors. these 1.25 degree field-of-view detectors arewell-suited to ultraviolet observations because of their excellent redrejection and negligible background. a dithered mode of observing and photonlist output pose complex requirements on the data processing pipeline,entangling detector calibrations and aspect reconstruction algorithms. recentimprovements have achieved photometric repeatability of 0.05 and 0.03 mab inthe fuv and nuv, respectively. we have detected a long term drift of order 1%fuv and 6% nuv over the mission. astrometric precision is of order 0.5" rms inboth bands. in this paper we provide the galex user with a broad overview ofthe calibration issues likely to be confronted in the current release.improvements are likely as the galex mission continues into an extended phasewith a healthy instrument, no consumables, and increased opportunities forguest investigations.

0706.1076	clustering properties of restframe uv selected galaxies ii: migration of  star formation sites with cosmic time from galex and cfhtls	we analyze the clustering properties of ultraviolet selected galaxies byusing galex-sdss data at z&lt;0.6 and cfhtls deep u' imaging at z=1. thesedatasets provide a unique basis at z&lt; 1 which can be directly compared withhigh redshift samples built with similar selection criteria. we discuss thedependence of the correlation function parameters (r0, delta) on theultraviolet luminosity as well as the linear bias evolution. we find that thebias parameter shows a gradual decline from high (b &gt; 2) to low redshift (b ~0.79^{+0.1}_{-0.08}). when accounting for the fraction of the star formationactivity enclosed in the different samples, our results suggest that the bulkof star formation migrated from high mass dark matter halos at z&gt;2 (10^12 &lt;m_min &lt; 10^13 m_sun, located in high density regions), to less massive halos atlow redshift (m_min &lt; 10^12 m_sun, located in low density regions). this resultextends the ``downsizing'' picture (shift of the star formation activity fromhigh stellar mass systems at high z to low stellar mass at low z) to the darkmatter distribution.
