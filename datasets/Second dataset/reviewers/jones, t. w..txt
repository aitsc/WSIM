0901.1673	three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of buoyant bubbles in  galaxy clusters	we report results of 3d mhd simulations of the dynamics of buoyant bubbles inmagnetized galaxy cluster media. the simulations are three dimensionalextensions of two dimensional calculations reported by jones &amp; de young (2005).initially spherical bubbles and briefly inflated spherical bubbles all withradii a few times smaller than the intracluster medium (icm) scale height werefollowed as they rose through several icm scale heights. such bubbles quicklyevolve into a toroidal form that, in the absence of magnetic influences, isstable against fragmentation in our simulations. this ring formation resultsfrom (commonly used) initial conditions that cause icm material below thebubbles to drive upwards through the bubble, creating a vortex ring; that is,hydrostatic bubbles develop into "smoke rings", if they are initially not verymuch smaller or very much larger than the icm scale height. even modest icmmagnetic fields with beta = p_gas/p_mag ~ 10^3 can influence the dynamics ofthe bubbles, provided the fields are not tangled on scales comparable to orsmaller than the size of the bubbles. quasi-uniform, horizontal fields withinitial beta ~ 10^2 bifurcated our bubbles before they rose more than about ascale height of the icm, and substantially weaker fields produced cleardistortions. on the other hand, tangled magnetic fields with similar, modeststrengths are generally less easily amplified by the bubble motions and arethus less influential in bubble evolution. inclusion of a comparably strong,tangled magnetic field inside the initial bubbles had little effect on ourbubble evolution, since those fields were quickly diminished through expansionof the bubble and reconnection of the initial field.

0901.1702	self-similar evolution of cosmic-ray modified shocks: the cosmic-ray  spectrum	we use kinetic simulations of diffusive shock acceleration (dsa) to study thetime-dependent evolution of plane, quasi-parallel, cosmic-ray (cr) modifiedshocks. thermal leakage injection of low energy crs and finite alfv\'en wavepropagation and dissipation are included. bohm diffusion as well as thediffusion with the power-law momentum dependence are modeled. as long as theacceleration time scale to relativistic energies is much shorter than thedynamical evolution time scale of the shocks, the precursor and subshocktransition approach the time-asymptotic state, which depends on the shock sonicand alfv\'enic mach numbers and the cr injection efficiency. for the diffusionmodels we employ, the shock precursor structure evolves in an approximatelyself-similar fashion, depending only on the similarity variable, x/(u_s t).during this self-similar stage, the cr distribution at the subshock maintains acharacteristic form as it evolves: the sum of two power-laws with the slopesdetermined by the subshock and total compression ratios with an exponentialcutoff at the highest accelerated momentum, p_{max}(t). based on the results ofthe dsa simulations spanning a range of mach numbers, we suggest functionalforms for the shock structure parameters, from which the aforementioned form ofcr spectrum can be constructed. these analytic forms may represent approximatesolutions to the dsa problem for astrophysical shocks during the self-similarevolutionary stage as well as during the steady-state stage if p_{max} isfixed.

1001.1747	three-dimensional simulations of bi-directed magnetohydrodynamic jets  interacting with cluster environments	we report on a series of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations ofactive galactic nucleus (agn) jet propagation in realistic models of magnetizedgalaxy clusters. we are primarily interested in the details of energy transferbetween jets and the intracluster medium (icm) to help clarify what role suchflows could have in the reheating of cluster cores. our simulated jets featurea range of intermittency behaviors, including intermittent jets thatperiodically switch on and off and one model jet that shuts down completely,naturally creating a relic plume. the icm into which these jets propagateincorporates tangled magnetic field geometries and density substructuredesigned to mimic some likely features of real galaxy clusters. we find thatour jets are characteristically at least 60% efficient at transferring thermalenergy to the icm. irreversible heat energy is not uniformly distributed,however, instead residing preferentially in regions very near the jet/cocoonboundaries. while intermittency affects the details of how, when, and wherethis energy is deposited, all of our models generically fail to heat thecluster cores uniformly. both the detailed density structure and nominally weakmagnetic fields in the icm play interesting roles in perturbing the flows,particularly when the jets are non-steady. still, this perturbation is neversufficient to isotropize the jet energy deposition, suggesting that some otheringredient is required for agn jets to successfully reheat cluster cores.

1102.1481	synthetic observations of simulated agn jets: x-ray cavities	observations of x-ray cavities formed by powerful jets from agn in galaxycluster cores are widely used to estimate the energy output of the agn. usingmethods commonly applied to observations of clusters, we conduct syntheticx-ray observations of 3d mhd simulated jet-icm interactions to test thereliability of measuring x-ray cavity power. these measurements are derivedfrom empirical estimates of the enthalpy content of the cavities and theirimplicit ages. we explore how such physical factors as jet intermittency andobservational conditions such as orientation of the jets with respect to theline of sight impact the reliability of observational measurements of cavityenthalpy and age. an estimate of the errors in these quantities can be made bydirectly comparing "observationally" derived values with "actual" values fromthe simulations. in our tests, cavity enthalpy derived from observations wastypically within a factor of two of the simulation values. cavity age and,therefore, cavity power are sensitive to the accuracy of the estimatedinclination angle of the jets. cavity age and power estimates within a factorof two of the actual values are possible given an accurate inclination angle.

1205.1895	diffusive shock acceleration simulations of radio relics	recent radio observations have identified a class of structures, so-calledradio relics, in clusters of galaxies. the radio emission from these sources isinterpreted as synchrotron radiation from gev electrons gyrating inmicrog-level magnetic fields. radio relics, located mostly in the outskirts ofclusters, seem to associate with shock waves, especially those developed duringmergers. in fact, they seem to be good structures to identify and probe suchshocks in intracluster media (icms), provided we understand the electronacceleration and re-acceleration at those shocks. in this paper, we describetime-dependent simulations for diffusive shock acceleration at weak shocks thatare expected to be found in icms. freshly injected as well as pre-existingpopulations of cosmic-ray (cr) electrons are considered, and energy losses viasynchrotron and inverse compton are included. we then compare the synchrotronflux and spectral distributions estimated from the simulations with those intwo well-observed radio relics in ciza j2242.8+5301 and zwcl0008.8+5215.considering that the cr electron injection is rather inefficient at weak shockswith mach number m &lt;~ a few, the existence of radio relics could indicate thepre-existing population of low-energy cr electrons in icms. the implication ofour results on the merger shock scenario of radio relics is discussed.

1308.6652	nonthermal radiation from supernova remnants: effects of magnetic field  amplification and particle escape	we explore nonlinear effects of wave-particle interactions on the diffusiveshock acceleration (dsa) process in type ia-like, snr blast waves, byimplementing phenomenological models for magnetic field amplification,alfv'enic drift, and particle escape in time-dependent numerical simulations ofnonlinear dsa. for typical snr parameters the cr protons can be accelerated topev energies only if the region of amplified field ahead of the shock isextensive enough to contain the diffusion lengths of the particles of interest.even with the help of alfv'enic drift, it remains somewhat challenging toconstruct a nonlinear dsa model for snrs in which order of 10 % of thesupernova explosion energy is converted to the cr energy and the magnetic fieldis amplified by a factor of 10 or so in the shock precursor, while, at the sametime, the energy spectrum of pev protons is steeper than e^{-2}. to explore theinfluence of these physical effects on observed snr emissions, we also computeresulting radio-to-gamma-ray spectra. nonthermal emission spectra, especiallyin x-ray and gamma-ray bands,depend on the time dependent evolution of crinjection process, magnetic field amplification, and particle escape, as wellas the shock dynamic evolution. this result comes from the fact that the highenergy end of the cr spectrum is composed of the particles that are injected inthe very early stages of blast wave evolution. thus it is crucial to understandbetter the plasma wave-particle interactions associated with collisionlessshocks in detail modeling of nonthermal radiation from snrs.

1401.7519	cosmic rays in galaxy clusters and their non-thermal emission	radio observations prove the existence of relativistic particles and magneticfield associated with the intra-cluster-medium (icm) through the presence ofextended synchrotron emission in the form of radio halos and peripheral relics.this observational evidence has fundamental implications on the physics of theicm. non-thermal components in galaxy clusters are indeed unique probes of veryenergetic processes operating within clusters that drain gravitational andelectromagnetic energy into cosmic rays and magnetic fields. these componentsstrongly affect the (micro-)physical properties of the icm, including viscosityand electrical conductivities, and have also potential consequences on theevolution of clusters themselves. the nature and properties of cosmic rays ingalaxy clusters, including the origin of the observed radio emission oncluster-scales, have triggered an active theoretical debate in the last decade.only recently we can start addressing some of the most important questions inthis field, thanks to recent observational advances, both in the radio and athigh energies. the properties of cosmic rays and of cluster non-thermalemissions depend on the dynamical state of the icm, the efficiency of particleacceleration mechanisms in the icm and on the dynamics of these cosmic rays. inthis review we discuss in some detail the acceleration and transport of cosmicrays in galaxy clusters and the most relevant observational milestones thathave provided important steps on our understanding of this physics. finally,looking forward to the possibilities from new generations of observationaltools, we focus on what appear to be the most important prospects for the nearfuture from radio and high-energy observations.

1405.0557	injection of $\kappa$-like suprathermal particles into diffusive shock  acceleration	we consider a phenomenological model for the thermal leakage injection in thediffusive shock acceleration (dsa) process, in which suprathermal protons andelectrons near the shock transition zone are assumed to have the so-called$\kappa$-distributions produced by interactions of background thermal particleswith pre-existing and/or self-excited plasma/mhd waves or turbulence. the$\kappa$-distribution has a power-law tail, instead of an exponential cutoff,well above the thermal peak momentum. so there are a larger number of potentialseed particles with momentum, above that required for participation in the dsaprocess. as a result, the injection fraction for the $\kappa$-distributiondepends on the shock mach number much less severely compared to that for themaxwellian distribution. thus, the existence of $\kappa$-like suprathermaltails at shocks would ease the problem of extremely low injection fractions,especially for electrons and especially at weak shocks such as those found inthe intracluster medium. we suggest that the injection fraction for protonsranges $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ for a $\kappa$-distribution with $10 &lt; \kappa_p &lt; 30$at quasi-parallel shocks, while the injection fraction for electrons becomes$10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ for a $\kappa$-distribution with $\kappa_e &lt; 2$ atquasi-perpendicular shocks. for such $\kappa$ values the ratio of cosmic rayelectrons to protons naturally becomes $k_{e/p}\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$, which isrequired to explain the observed ratio for galactic cosmic rays.

1507.08737	vorticity, shocks and magnetic fields in subsonic, icm-like turbulence	we analyze high resolution simulations of compressible, mhd turbulence withproperties resembling conditions in galaxy clusters. the flow is driven toturbulence mach number $\mathcal{m}_t \sim 1/2$ in an isothermal medium with aninitially very weak, uniform seed magnetic field ($\beta = p_g/p_b = 10^6$).since cluster turbulence is likely to result from a mix of sheared (solenoidal)and compressive forcing processes, we examine the distinct turbulenceproperties for both cases. in one set of simulations velocity forcing isentirely solenoidal ($\nabla\cdot \delta {\vec u} = 0$), while in the other itis entirely compressive ($\nabla\times \delta {\vec u} = 0$). both casesdevelop a mixture of solenoidal and compressive turbulent motions, since eachgenerates the other. the development of compressive turbulent motions leads toshocks, even when the turbulence is solenoidally forced and subsonic. shocks,in turn, produce and amplify vorticity, which is especially important incompressively forced turbulence. to clarify those processes we include a pairof appendices that look in detail at vorticity evolution in association withshocks. from our simulation analyses we find that magnetic fields amplified tonear saturation levels in predominantly solenoidal turbulence can actuallyenhance vorticity on small scales by concentrating and stabilizing shear. theproperties, evolution rates and relative contributions of the kinetic andmagnetic turbulent elements depend strongly on the character of the forcing.specifically, shocks are stronger, but vorticity evolution and magnetic fieldamplification are slower and weaker when the turbulence is compressivelyforced. we identify a simple relation to estimate characteristic shockstrengths in terms of the turbulence mach number and the character of theforcing. our results will be helpful in understanding flow motions in galaxyclusters.

0705.3274	self-similar evolution of cosmic-ray-modified quasi-parallel plane  shocks	using an improved version of the previously introduced crash (cosmic rayacceleration shock) code, we have calculated the time evolution of cosmic-ray(cr) modified quasi-parallel plane shocks for bohm-like diffusion, includingself-consistent models of alfven wave drift and dissipation, along with thermalleakage injection of crs. the new simulations follow evolution of the crdistribution to much higher energies than our previous study, providing abetter examination of evolutionary and asymptotic behaviors. the postshock crpressure becomes constant after quick initial adjustment, since the evolutionof the cr partial pressure expressed in terms of a momentum similarity variableis self-similar. the shock precursor, which scales as the diffusion length ofthe highest energy crs, subsequently broadens approximately linearly with time,independent of diffusion model, so long as crs continue to be accelerated toever-higher energies. this means the nonlinear shock structure can be describedapproximately in terms of the similarity variable, x/(u_s t), where u_s is theshock speed once the postshock pressure reaches an approximate time asymptoticstate. as before, the shock mach number is the key parameter determining theevolution and the cr acceleration efficiency, although finite alfven wave driftand wave energy dissipation in the shock precursor reduce the effectivevelocity change experienced by crs, so reduce acceleration efficiencynoticeably, thus, providing a second important parameter at low and moderatemach numbers.

astro-ph;0005444	properties of cosmic shock waves in large scale structure formation	we have examined the properties of shock waves in simulations of large scalestructure formation for two cosmological scenarios (a scdm and a lcdm withomega =1). large-scale shocks result from accretion onto sheets, filaments andgalaxy clusters (gcs) on a scale of circa 5 mpc/h in both cases. energeticmotions, both residual of past accretion history and due to current asymmetricinflow along filaments, generate additional, common shocks on a scale of about1 mpc/h, which penetrate deep inside gcs. also collisions between substructuresinside gcs form merger shocks. consequently, the topology of the shocks is verycomplex and highly connected. during cosmic evolution the comoving shocksurface density decreases, reflecting the ongoing structure merger process inboth scenarios. accretion shocks have very high mach numbers (10-10^3), whenphoto-heating of the pre-shock gas is not included. the typical shock speed isof order v_{sh}(z) =h(z)lambda_{nl}(z), with lambda_{nl}(z) the wavelengthscale of the nonlinear perturbation at the given epoch. however, the machnumber for shocks occuring within clusters is usually smaller (3-10), due tothe fact that the intracluster gas is already hot. statistical fits of shockspeed around gcs as a function of gcs temperature give power-law's in accordwith 1-d predictions. however, a very different result is obtained for fits ofthe shock radius, reflecting the very complex shock structures forming in 3-dsimulations. the in-flowing kinetic energy across such shocks, giving the poweravailable for cosmic-ray acceleration, is comparable to the cluster x-rayluminosity emitted from a central region of radius 0.5 mpc/h. considering theirlarge size and long lifetimes, those shocks are potentially interesting sitesfor cosmic-ray acceleration, if modest magnetic fields exist within them.

astro-ph;0008084	the magnetohydrodynamic kelvin-helmholtz instability: a  three-dimensional study of nonlinear evolution	we investigate through high resolution 3d simulations the nonlinear evolutionof compressible magnetohydrodynamic flows subject to the kelvin-helmholtzinstability. we confirm in 3d flows the conclusion from our 2d work that evenapparently weak magnetic fields embedded in kelvin-helmholtz unstable plasmaflows can be fundamentally important to nonlinear evolution of the instability.in fact, that statement is strengthened in 3d by this work, because it showshow field line bundles can be stretched and twisted in 3d as the quasi-2d cat'seye vortex forms out of the hydrodynamical motions. in our simulations twistingof the field may increase the maximum field strength by more than a factor oftwo over the 2d effect. if, by these developments, the alfv\'en mach number offlows around the cat's eye drops to unity or less, our simulations suggestmagnetic stresses will eventually destroy the cat's eye and cause the plasmaflow to self-organize into a relatively smooth and apparently stable flow thatretains memory of the original shear. for our flow configurations the regime in3d for such reorganization is $4\lesssim m_{ax} \lesssim 50$, expressed interms of the alfv\'en mach number of the original velocity transition and theinitial alfv\'en speed projected to the flow plan. for weaker fields theinstability remains essentially hydrodynamic in early stages, and the cat's eyeis destroyed by the hydrodynamic secondary instabilities of a 3d nature. then,the flows evolve into chaotic structures that approach decaying isotropicturbulence. in this stage, there is considerable enhancement to the magneticenergy due to stretching, twisting, and turbulent amplification, which isretained long afterwards. the magnetic energy eventually catches up to thekinetic energy, and the nature of flows become magnetohydrodynamic.

astro-ph;0011058	time dependent cosmic-ray shock acceleration with self-consistent  injection	one of the key questions to understanding the efficiency of diffusive shockacceleration of the cosmic rays (crs) is the injection process from thermalparticles. a self-consistent injection model based on the interactions of thesuprathermal particles with self-generated magneto-hydrodynamic waves has beendeveloped recently by malkov (1998, phys. rev. e 58, 4911). by adopting thisanalytic solution, a numerical treatment of the plasma-physical injection modelat a strong quasi-parallel shock has been devised and incorporated into thecombined gas dynamics and the cr diffusion-convection code. in order toinvestigate self-consistently the injection and acceleration efficiencies, wehave applied this code to the cr modified shocks of both high and low machnumbers (m=30 and m=2.24) with a bohm type diffusion model. we find theinjection process is self-regulated in such a way that the injection ratereaches and stays at a nearly stable value after quick initial adjustment. forboth shocks about 0.1% of the incoming thermal particles are injected into thecrs. for the weak shock, the shock has reached a steady state within ourintegration time and about 10% of the total available shock energy istransfered into the cr energy density. the strong shock has achieved a higheracceleration efficiency of about 20% by the end of our simulation, but has notyet reached a steady-state.

astro-ph;0012080	3d mhd simulations of radio galaxies including nonthermal electron  transport	we report on an effort to study the connections between dynamics in simulatedradio galaxy plasma flows and the properties of nonthermal electron populationscarried in those flows. to do this we have introduced a new numerical schemefor electron transport that allows a much more detailed look at this problemthan has been possible before. especially when the dynamics is fully threedimensional the flows are generally chaotic in the cocoon, and the jet itselfcan flail about violently. the bending jet can pinch itself off and redirectitself to enhance its penetration of the ambient medium. these behaviors ofteneliminate the presence of a strong jet termination shock, which is assumedpresent in all modern cartoon models of the rg phenomenon. instead a much morecomplex ``shock web'' forms near the end of the jet that leads to a far lesspredictable pattern of particle acceleration. similarly, the magnetic fields inthese flows are highly filamented, as well as spatially and temporallyintermittent. this leads to a very localized and complex pattern of synchrotronaging for relativistic electron populations, which makes it difficult to useproperties of the electron spectrum to infer the local rate of aging.

astro-ph;0104161	chandra detection of the forward and reverse shocks in cassiopeia-a	we report the localization of the forward and reversed shock fronts in theyoung supernova remnant cas-a using x-ray data obtained with the chandraobservatory. high resolution x-ray maps resolve a previously unseen x-rayfeature encompassing the extremity of the remnant. this feature consists ofthin, tangential wisps of emission bordering the outer edge of the thermalx-ray and radio remnant, forming a circular rim, approx. 2.7 in radius. radioimages show a sharp rise in brightness at this x-ray rim, along with a largejump in the synchrotron polarization angle. these characteristics suggest thatthese wisps are the previously unresolved signature of the forward, or outer,shock. similarly, we identify the sharp rise in emissivity of the bright shellfor both the radio and x-ray line emission associated with the reverse shock.the derived ratio of the averaged forward and reverse shock radii of approx.3:2 constrains the remnant to have swept up roughly the same amount of mass aswas ejected; this suggests that cas-a is just entering the sedov phase.comparison of the x-ray spectra from the two shock regions shows that theequivalent widths of prominent emission lines are significantly lower exteriorto the bright shell, as expected if they are respectively identified with theshocked circumstellar material and shocked ejecta. furthermore, the spectrum ofthe outer rim itself is dominated by power-law emission, likely the counterpartof the non-thermal component previously seen at energies above 10 kev.

astro-ph;0104259	three-dimensional simulations of the parker instability in a  uniformly-rotating disk	we investigate the effects of rotation on the evolution of the parkerinstability in an exponentially-stratified and uniformly-rotating magnetizedgas disk by carrying out three-dimensional numerical simulations with anisothermal magnetohydrodynamic code. the instability has been initialized byrandom velocity perturbations. in the linear stage, the evolution is not muchdifferent from that without rotation and the mixed (undular + interchange) moderegulates the system. the interchange mode induces alternating dense andrarefied regions with small radial wavelengths, while the undular mode bendsthe magnetic field lines in the plane of azimuthal and vertical directions. inthe nonlinear stage, flow motion overall becomes chaotic as in the case withoutrotation. however, as the gas in higher positions slides down along field linesforming supersonic flows, the coriolis force becomes important. as oppositelydirected flows fall into valleys along both sides of magnetic field lines, theyexperience the coriolis force toward opposite directions, which twists magneticfield lines there. hence, we suggest that the coriolis force plays a role inrandomizing magnetic field. the three-dimensional density structure formed bythe instability is still sheet-like with the short dimension along the radialdirection, as in the case without rotation. however, the long dimension is nowslightly tilted with respect to the mean field direction. the shape of highdensity regions is a bit rounder. the maximum enhancement factor of thevertical column density relative to its initial value is about 1.5, which issmaller than that in the case without rotation. we conclude that uniformrotation doesn't change our point of view that the parker instability alone isnot a viable mechanism for the formation of giant molecular clouds.

astro-ph;0105465	cosmic ray protons accelerated at cosmological shocks and their impact  on groups and clusters of galaxies	we investigate the production of cosmic ray (cr) protons at cosmologicalshocks by performing, for the first time, numerical simulations of large scalestructure formation that include directly the acceleration, transport andenergy losses of the high energy particles. crs are injected at shocksaccording to the thermal leakage model and, thereafter, accelerated to apower-law distribution as indicated by the test particle limit of the diffusiveshock acceleration theory. the evolution of the cr protons accounts for lossesdue to adiabatic expansion/compression, coulomb collisions and inelastic p-pscattering. our results suggest that cr protons produced at shocks formed inassociation with the process of large scale structure formation could amount toa substantial fraction of the total pressure in the intra-cluster medium. theirpresence should be easily revealed by glast through detection of gamma-ray fluxfrom the decay of neutral pions produced in inelastic p-p collisions of such crprotons with nuclei of the intra-cluster gas. this measurement will allow adirect determination of the cr pressure contribution in the intra-clustermedium. we also find that the spatial distribution of cr is typically moreirregular than that of the thermal gas because it is more influenced by theunderlying distribution of shocks. this feature is reflected in the appearanceof our gamma-ray synthetic images. finally, the average cr pressuredistribution appears statistically slightly more extended than the thermalpressure.

astro-ph;0112046	on the possible reason for non-detection of tev-protons in snrs	the theory of shock acceleration predicts the maximum particle energy to belimited only by the acceleration time and the size (geometry) of the shock.this led to optimistic estimates for the galactic cosmic ray energy achievablein the snr shocks. the estimates imply that the accelerated particles, whilemaking no strong impact on the shock structure (test particle approach) arenevertheless scattered by strong self-generated alfven waves (turbulent boost)needed to accelerate them quickly. we demonstrate that these two assumptionsare in conflict when applied to snrs of the age required for cosmic rayacceleration to the ``knee'' energy.  we study the combined effect of acceleration nonlinearity (shock modificationby accelerated particles) and wave generation on the acceleration process. weshow that the refraction of self-generated waves resulting from thedeceleration of the plasma flow by the pressure of energetic particles causesenhanced losses of these particles. this effect slows down the acceleration andchanges the shape of particle spectrum near the cut-off. the implications forobservations of tev emission from snr remnants are also discussed.

astro-ph;0207410	numerical studies of cosmic ray injection and acceleration	a numerical scheme that incorporates a thermal leakage injection model into acombined gas dynamics and cosmic ray (cr, hereafter) diffusion-convection codehas been developed. the particle injection is followed numerically by filteringthe diffusive flux of suprathermal particles across the shock to the upstreamregion according to a velocity-dependent transparency function that controlsthe fraction of leaking particles. we have studied cr injection andacceleration efficiencies during the evolution of cr modified planar shocks fora wide range of initial shock mach numbers, $m_0$, assuming a bohm-likediffusion coefficient. the injection process is very efficient when thesubshock is strong, leading to fast and significant modification of the shockstructure. as the cr pressure increases, the subshock weakens and the injectionrate decreases accordingly, so that the subshock does not disappear. althoughsome fraction of the particles injected early in the evolution continue to beaccelerated to ever higher energies, the postshock cr pressure reaches anapproximate time-asymptotic value due to a balance between freshinjection/acceleration and advection/diffusion of the cr particles away fromthe shock. we conclude that the injection rates in strong parallel shocks aresufficient to lead to rapid nonlinear modifications to the shock structures andthat self-consistent injection and time-dependent simulations are crucial tounderstanding the non-linear evolution of cr modified shocks.

astro-ph;0211360	acceleration of cosmic rays at large scale cosmic shocks in the universe	cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of large scale structure in theuniverse have shown that accretion shocks and merger shocks form due to flowmotions associated with the gravitational collapse of nonlinear structures.estimated speed and curvature radius of these shocks could be as large as a few1000 km/s and several mpc, respectively. according to the diffusive shockacceleration theory, populations of cosmic-ray particles can be injected andaccelerated to very high energy by astrophysical shocks in tenuous plasmas. inorder to explore the cosmic ray acceleration at the cosmic shocks, we haveperformed nonlinear numerical simulations of cosmic ray (cr) modified shockswith the newly developed crash (cosmic ray amr shock) numerical code. weadopted the bohm diffusion model for crs, based on the hypothesis that strongalfv\'en waves are self-generated by streaming crs. the shock formationsimulation includes a plasma-physics-based ``injection'' model that transfers asmall proportion of the thermal proton flux through the shock into low energycrs for acceleration there. we found that, for strong accretion shocks, crs canabsorb most of shock kinetic energy and the accretion shock speed is reduced upto 20 %, compared to pure gas dynamic shocks. for merger shocks with small machnumbers, however, the energy transfer to crs is only about 10-20 % with anassociated cr particle fraction of $10^{-3}$. nonlinear feedback due to the crpressure is insignificant in the latter shocks. although detailed resultsdepend on models for the particle diffusion and injection, these calculationsshow that cosmic shocks in large scale structure could provide accelerationsites of extragalactic cosmic rays of the highest energy.

astro-ph;0301625	the effect of cosmic ray diffusion on the parker instability	the parker instability, which has been considered as a process governing thestructure of the interstellar medium, is induced by the buoyancy of magneticfield and cosmic rays. in previous studies, while the magnetic field has beenfully incorporated in the context of isothermal magnetohydrodynamics, cosmicrays have been normally treated with the simplifying assumption of infinitediffusion along magnetic field lines but no diffusion across them. the cosmicray diffusion is, however, finite. in this work, we take into account fully thediffusion process of cosmic rays in a linear stability analysis of the parkerinstability. cosmic rays are described with the diffusion-convection equation.with realistic values of cosmic ray diffusion coefficients expected in theinterstellar medium, we show that the result of previous studies with thesimplifying assumption on cosmic ray diffusion applies well. finiteness ofparallel diffusion decreases the growth rate of the parker instability, whilethe relatively smaller perpendicular diffusion has no significant effect. wediscuss the implication of our result on the role of the parker instability inthe interstellar medium.

astro-ph;0305164	cosmological shock waves and their role in the large scale structure of  the universe	we study the properties of cosmological shock waves identified inhigh-resolution, n-body/hydrodynamic simulations of a $\lambda$cdm universe andtheir role on thermalization of gas and acceleration of nonthermal, cosmic ray(cr) particles. external shocks form around sheets, filaments and knots of massdistribution when the gas in void regions accretes onto them. within thosenonlinear structures, internal shocks are produced by infall of previouslyshocked gas to filaments and knots, and during subclump mergers, as well as bychaotic flow motions. due to the low temperature of the accreting gas, the machnumber of external shocks is high, extending up to $m\sim 100$ or higher. incontrast, internal shocks have mostly low mach numbers. for all shocks of$m\ge1.5$ the mean distance between shock surfaces over the entire computedvolume is $\sim4 h^{-1}$ mpc at present, or $\sim 1 h^{-1}$ mpc for internalshocks within nonlinear structures. identified external shocks are moreextensive, with their surface area $\sim2$ times larger than that of identifiedinternal shocks at present. however, especially because of higher preshockdensities, but also due to higher shock speeds, internal shocks dissipate moreenergy. hence, the internal shocks are mainly responsible for gasthermalization as well as cr acceleration. in fact, internal shocks with $2 \lam \la 4$ contribute $\sim 1/2$ of the total dissipation. using a nonlineardiffusive shock acceleration model for cr protons, we estimate the ratio of crenergy to gas thermal energy dissipated at cosmological shock waves to be$\sim1/2$ through the history of the universe. our result supports scenarios inwhich the intracluster medium contains energetically significant populations ofcrs.

astro-ph;9706208	hydrodynamics of cloud collisions in 2d: the fate of clouds in a  multi-phase medium	we have studied head-on collisions between equal-mass, mildly supersonic(mach number 1.5) hi clouds, in a standard two-phase ism (t_cl = 74 k, n_cl =22 cm^-3, \chi = 100). we explore the role of various factors, including theradiative cooling parameter \eta = t_rad/t_coll (t_coll=r_c/v_c), evolutionarymodifications on the cloud structure (by colliding clouds ``evolved'' throughindependent motion within the intercloud medium (wim)), and the symmetry of theproblem (by colliding initially identical clouds, evolved to different agesbefore impact). the presence of bow shocks and ram pressure from material inthe cloud wake, developed during such evolution through the wim, significantlyalters these interactions with respect to the standard case of non-evolvedclouds.  in general, in our adiabatic collisions the clouds are disrupted and converttheir gas into a few low density contrast clumps. by contrast, for symmetricradiative cases we find that the two clouds coalesce, with almost all theinitial kinetic energy radiated away. on the other hand, for both adiabatic andradiative collisions, asymmetric collisions have a much greater tendency todisrupt the two clouds. fragmentation of the clouds may occur, andinstabilities are in general enhanced. in addition, radiative cooling is lessefficient in our asymmetric interactions, so that those parts of the cloudsthat initially seem to merge are more likely to re-expand and fade into thewim. since the majority of real cloud collisions should be asymmetric for onereason or another, we conclude that most gasdynamical diffuse cloud collisionswill be disruptive, at least in the absence of significant self-gravity or of asignificant magnetic field.

astro-ph;9710227	$10^{51}$ ergs: the evolution of shell supernova remnants	this paper reports on a workshop hosted by the university of minnesota, march23-26, 1997. it addressed fundamental dynamical issues associated with theevolution of shell supernova remnants and the relationships between supernovaremnants and their environments. the workshop considered, in addition toclassical shell snrs, dynamical issues involving x-ray filled compositeremnants and pulsar driven shells, such as that in the crab nebula.approximately 75 participants with wide ranging interests attended theworkshop. an even larger community helped through extensive on-line debatesprior to the meeting. each of the several sessions, organized mostly aroundchronological labels, also addressed some underlying, general physical themes:how are snr dynamics and structures modified by the character of the csm andthe ism and vice versa? how are magnetic fields generated in snrs and how domagnetic fields influence snrs? where and how are cosmic-rays (electrons andions) produced in snrs and how does their presence influence or reveal snrdynamics? how does snr blast energy partition into various components over timeand what controls conversion between components? in lieu of a proceedingsvolume, we present here a synopsis of the workshop in the form of briefsummaries of the workshop sessions. the sharpest impressions from the workshopwere the crucial and under-appreciated roles that environments have on snrappearance and dynamics and the critical need for broad-based studies tounderstand these beautiful, but enigmatic objects. \\

astro-ph;9711250	effects of cooling on the propagation of magnetized jets	we present multi-dimensional simulations of magnetized radiative jetsappropriate to young stellar objects. magnetized jets subject to collisionallyexcited radiative losses have not, as yet, received extensive scrutiny. thepurpose of this letter is to articulate the propagation dynamics of radiativemhd jets in the context of the extensive jet literature. most importantly, welook for morphological and kinematic diagnostics that may distinguishhydrodynamic protostellar jets from their magnetically dominated cousins. oursimulations are axisymmetric (2.5-d). a toroidal b_phi field geometry is used.our models have high sonic mach numbers (ms approx 10), but lower fast modemach number (mf approx 5). this is approximately the case for jets formed viadisk-wind or x-wind models - currently the consensus choice for launching andcollimating yso jets. time-dependent radiative losses are included via acoronal cooling curve. our results demonstrate that the morphology andpropagation characteristics of strongly magnetized radiative jets can differsignificantly from jets with weak fields. in particular the formation ofnose-cones via post-shock hoop stresses leads to narrow bow shocks and enhancedbow shock speeds. in addition, the hoop stresses produce strong shocks in thejet beam which constrasts with the relatively unperturbed beam in radiativehydrodynamic jets. our simulations show that pinch modes produced by magnetictension can strongly effect magnetized protostellar jets.

astro-ph;9807228	a divergence-free upwind code for multidimensional magnetohydrodynamic  flows	a description is given for preserving ${\bmsy\nabla}\cdot{\vec b}=0$ in amagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) code that employs the upwind, total variationdiminishing (tvd) scheme and the strang-type operator splitting formulti-dimensionality. the method is based on the staggered mesh technique toconstrain the transport of magnetic field: the magnetic field components aredefined at grid interfaces with their advective fluxes on grid edges, whileother quantities are defined at grid centers. the magnetic field at gridcenters for the upwind step is calculated by interpolating the values from gridinterfaces. the advective fluxes on grid edges for the magnetic field evolutionare calculated from the upwind fluxes at grid interfaces. then, the magneticfield can be maintained with ${\bmsy\nabla}\cdot{\vec b}=0$ exactly, if this isso initially, while the upwind scheme is used for the update of fluidquantities. the correctness of the code is demonstrated through tests comparingnumerical solutions either with analytic solutions or with numerical solutionsfrom the code using an explicit divergence-cleaning method. also the robustnessis shown through tests involving realistic astrophysical problems.

astro-ph;9808174	magnetohydrodynamics of cloud collisions in a multi-phase interstellar  medium	we extend previous studies of the physics of interstellar cloud collisions bybeginning investigation of the role of magnetic fields through 2dmagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) numerical simulations. we study head-on collisionsbetween equal mass, mildly supersonic diffuse clouds. we include a moderatemagnetic field and two limiting field geometries, with the field lines parallel(aligned) and perpendicular (transverse) to the colliding cloud motion. weexplore both adiabatic and radiative cases, as well as symmetric and asymmetricones. we also compute collisions between clouds evolved through prior motion inthe intercloud medium and compare with unevolved cases.  we find that: in the (i) aligned case, adiabatic collisions, like their hdcounterparts, are very disruptive, independent of the cloud symmetry. however,when radiative processes are taken into account, partial coalescence takesplace even in the asymmetric case, unlike the hd calculations. in the (ii)transverse case, collisions between initially adjacent unevolved clouds arealmost unaffected by magnetic fields. however, the interaction with themagnetized intercloud gas during the pre-collision evolution produces a regionof very high magnetic energy in front of the cloud. in collisions betweenevolved clouds with transverse field geometry, this region acts like a``bumper'', preventing direct contact between the clouds, and eventuallyreverses their motion. the ``elasticity'', defined as the ratio of the final tothe initial kinetic energy of each cloud, is about 0.5-0.6 in the cases weconsidered. this behavior is found both in adiabatic and radiative cases.

astro-ph;9808244	three-dimensional evolution of the parker instability under a uniform  gravity	using an isothermal mhd code, we have performed three-dimensional,high-resolution simulations of the parker instability. the initial equilibriumsystem is composed of exponentially-decreasing isothermal gas and magneticfield (along the azimuthal direction) under a uniform gravity. the evolution ofthe instability can be divided into three phases: linear, nonlinear, andrelaxed. during the linear phase, the perturbations grow exponentially with apreferred scale along the azimuthal direction but with smallest possible scalealong the radial direction, as predicted from linear analyses. during thenonlinear phase, the growth of the instability is saturated and flow motionbecomes chaotic. magnetic reconnection occurs, which allows gas to cross fieldlines. this, in turn, results in the redistribution of gas and magnetic field.the system approaches a new equilibrium in the relaxed phase, which isdifferent from the one seen in two-dimensional works. the structures formedduring the evolution are sheet-like or filamentary, whose shortest dimension isradial. their maximum density enhancement factor relative to the initial valueis less than 2. since the radial dimension is too small and the densityenhancement is too low, it is difficult to regard the parker instability aloneas a viable mechanism for the formation of giant molecular clouds.

astro-ph;9809081	simulating electron transport and synchrotron emission in radio  galaxies: shock acceleration and synchrotron aging in axis-symmetric flows	we introduce a simple and economical but effective method for includingrelativistic electron transport in multi-dimensional simulations of radiogalaxies. the method is designed to follow explicitly diffusive acceleration atshocks, and, in smooth flows 2nd order fermi acceleration plus adiabatic andsynchrotron cooling. we are able to follow both the spatial and energydistributions of the electrons, so that direct synchrotron emission propertiescan be modeled in time-dependent flows for the first time.  here we present first results in the form of some axis-symmetric mhdsimulations of mach 20 light jet flows. these show clearly the importance ofnonsteady terminal shocks that develop in such flows even when the jet inflowis steady. as a result of this and other consequences of the fundamentallydriven character of jets, we find complex patterns of emissivities andsynchrotron spectra, including steep spectral gradients in hot spots, islandsof distinct spectra electrons within the lobes and spectral gradients comingfrom the dynamical histories of a given flow element rather than fromsynchrotron aging of the embedded electrons. in addition, spectral aging in thelobes tends to proceed more slowly than one would estimate from regions of highemissivity.

astro-ph;9809082	radio emission from a young supernova remnant interacting with an  interstellar cloud: mhd simulation with relativistic electrons	we present two-dimensional mhd simulations of the evolution of a young typeia supernova remnant during its interaction with an interstellar cloud ofcomparable size at impact. we include for the first time in such simulationsexplicit relativistic electron transport, including spectral information usinga simple but effective scheme that follows their acceleration at shocks andsubsequent transport. from this information we also model radio synchrotronemission, including spectra. the principal conclusions from these experimentsare: 1) independent of the cloud interaction, the snr reverse shock can be anefficient site for particle acceleration in a young snr. 2) at these earlytimes the synchrotron spectral index due to electrons accelerated at theprimary shocks should be close to 0.5 unless those shocks are modified bycosmic-ray pressures. however, interaction with the cloud generates regions ofdistinctly steeper spectra, which may complicate interpretation in terms ofglobal dynamical models for snr evolution. 3) the internal motions within thesnr become highly turbulent following the cloud interaction. 4) an initiallyuniform interstellar magnetic field is preferentially amplified along themagnetic equator of the snr, primarily due to biased amplification byinstabilities. independent of the external field configuration, there is a netradial direction to this field inside the snr. 5) filamentary radio structurescorrelate well with magnetic filaments, while diffuse emission follows theelectron distribution. 6) interaction with the cloud enhances both the electronpopulation and the radio emission.

astro-ph;9901048	on the exchange of kinetic and magnetic energy between clouds and the  interstellar medium	we investigate, through 2d mhd numerical simulations, the interaction of auniform magnetic field oblique to a moving interstellar cloud. in particular weexplore the transformation of cloud kinetic energy into magnetic energy as aresult of field line stretching. some previous simulations have emphasized thepossible dynamical importance of a ``magnetic shield'' formed around cloudswhen the magnetic field is perpendicular to the cloud motion (jones et al.1996, miniati et al. 1998). it was not clear, however, how dependent thosefindings were to the assumed field configuration and cloud properties. toexpand our understanding of this effect, we examine several new cases by varingthe magnetic field orientation angle with respect to the cloud motion (\theta),the cloud-background density contrast, and the cloud mach number.  we show that in 2d and with \theta large enough, the magnetic field tensioncan become dominant in the dynamics of the motion of high density contrast, lowmach number clouds. in such cases a significant fraction of cloud kineticenergy can be transformed into magnetic energy with the magnetic pressure atthe cloud nose exceeding the ram pressure of the impinging flow. we derive acharacteristic timescale for this process of energy ``conversion''. we findalso that unless the cloud motion is highly aligned to the magnetic field,reconnection through tearing mode instabilities in the cloud wake limit theformation of a strong flux rope feature following the cloud. finally we attemptto interpret some observational properties of the magnetic field in view of ourresults.

astro-ph;9908315	simulations of nonthermal electron transport in multidimensional flows:  application to radio galaxies	we have developed an economical, effective numerical scheme for cosmic-raytransport suitable for treatment of electrons up to a few hundreds of gev inmultidimensional simulations of radio galaxies. the method follows the electronpopulation in sufficient detail to allow computation of synthetic radio andx-ray observations of the simulated sources, including spectral properties (seethe companion paper by tregillis et al. 1999). the cosmic-ray particlesimulations can follow the effects of shock acceleration, second-order fermiacceleration as well as radiative and adiabatic energy losses. we have appliedthis scheme to 2-d and 3-d mhd simulations of jet-driven flows and have begunto explore links between dynamics and the properties of high energy electronpopulations in radio lobes. the key initial discovery is the great importanceto the high energy particle population of the very unsteady and inhomogeneousflows, especially near the end of the jet. because of this, in particular, oursimulations show that a large fraction of the particle population flowing fromthe jet into the cocoon never passes through strong shocks. the shock strengthsencountered are not simply predicted by 1-d models, and are quite varied.consequently, the emergent electron spectra are highly heterogeneous. rates ofsynchrotron aging in "hot-spots" seem similarly to be very uneven, enhancingcomplexity in the spectral properties of electrons as they emerge into thelobes and making more difficult the task of comparing dynamical and radiativeages.

astro-ph;9908316	simulations of nonthermal electron transport in multidimensional flows:  synthetic observations of radio galaxies	we have applied an effective numerical scheme for cosmic-ray transport to 3dmhd simulations of jet flow in radio galaxies (see the companion paper by joneset al. 1999). the marriage of relativistic particle and 3d magnetic fieldinformation allows us to construct a rich set of ``synthetic observations'' ofour simulated objects. the information is sufficient to calculate the ``true''synchrotron emissivity at a given frequency using explicit information aboutthe relativistic electrons. this enables us to produce synchrotronsurface-brightness maps, including polarization. inverse-compton x-raysurface-brightness maps may also be produced. first results intended to explorethe connection between jet dynamics and electron transport in radio lobes arediscussed. we infer lobe magnetic field values by comparison of syntheticallyobserved x-ray and synchrotron fluxes, and find these ``inverse-compton''fields to be quite consistent with the actual rms field averaged over the lobe.the simplest minimum energy calculation from the synthetic observations alsoseems to agree with the actual simulated source properties.

astro-ph;9909033	the mhd kelvin-helmholtz instability iii: the role of sheared magnetic  field in planar flows	we have carried out simulations of the nonlinear evolution of themagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) kelvin-helmholtz (kh) instability for compressiblefluids in $2\frac{1}{2}$-dimensions, extending our previous work by frank et al(1996) and jones \etal (1997). in the present work we have simulated flows inthe x-y plane in which a ``sheared'' magnetic field of uniform strength``smoothly'' rotates across a thin velocity shear layer from the z direction tothe x direction, aligned with the flow field. we focus on dynamical evolutionof fluid features, kinetic energy dissipation, and mixing of the fluid betweenthe two layers, considering their dependence on magnetic field strength forthis geometry. the introduction of magnetic shear can allow a cat's eye-likevortex to form, even when the field is stronger than the nominal linearinstability limit given above. for strong fields that vortex is asymmetric withrespect to the preliminary shear layer, however, so the subsequent dissipationis enhanced over the uniform field cases of comparable field strength. in fact,so long as the magnetic field achieves some level of dynamical importanceduring an eddy turnover time, the asymmetries introduced through the magneticshear will increase flow complexity, and, with that, dissipation and mixing.the degree of the fluid mixing between the two layers is strongly influenced bythe magnetic field strength. mixing of the fluid is most effective when thevortex is disrupted by magnetic tension during transient reconnection, throughlocal chaotic behavior that follows.
