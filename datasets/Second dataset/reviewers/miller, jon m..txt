0905.4206	spectrum synthesis modeling of the x-ray spectrum of gro j1655-40 taken  during the 2005 outburst	the spectrum from the black hole x-ray transient gro j1655-40. obtained usingthe $chandra$ high energy transmission grating (hetg) in 2005 is notable as alaboratory for the study of warm absorbers, and for the presence of many linesfrom odd-$z$ elements between na and co (and ti and cr) not previously observedin x-rays. we present synthetic spectral models which can be used to constrainthese element abundances and other parameters describing the outflow from thewarm absorber in this object. we present results of fitting to the spectrumusing various tools and techniques, including automated line fitting,phenomenological models, and photoionization modeling. we show that thebehavior of the curves of growth of lines from h-like and li-like ions indicatethat the lines are either saturated or affected by filling-in from scattered ora partially covered continuum source. we confirm the conclusion of previouswork by \cite{mill06} and \cite{mill08} which shows that the ionizationconditions are not consistent with wind driving due to thermal expansion. thespectrum provides the opportunity to measure abundances for several elementsnot typically observable in the x-ray band. these show a pattern of enhancementfor iron peak elements, and solar or sub-solar values for elements lighter thancalcium. models show that this is consistent with enrichment by a core-collapsesupernova. we discuss the implications these values for the evolutionaryhistory of this system.

0906.3285	the fundamental plane of accretion onto black holes with dynamical  masses	black hole accretion and jet production are areas of intensive study inastrophysics. recent work has found a relation between radio luminosity, x-rayluminosity, and black hole mass. with the assumption that radio and x-rayluminosity are suitable proxies for jet power and accretion power,respectively, a broad fundamental connection between accretion and jetproduction is implied. in an effort to refine these links and enhance theirpower, we have explored the above relations exclusively among black holes withdirect, dynamical mass-measurements. this approach not only eliminatessystematic errors incurred through the use of secondary mass measurements, butalso effectively restricts the range of distances considered to avolume-limited sample. further, we have exclusively used archival data from thechandra x-ray observatory to best isolate nuclear sources. we find log(l_r) =(4.80 +/- 0.24) + (0.78 +/- 0.27) log(m_bh) + (0.67 +/- 0.12) log(l_x), inbroad agreement with prior efforts. owing to the nature of our sample, theplane can be turned into an effective mass predictor. when the full sample isconsidered, masses are predicted less accurately than with the well-knownm-sigma relation. if obscured agn are excluded, the plane is potentially abetter predictor than other scaling measures.

1007.2823	quiescent x-ray emission from cen x-4: a variable thermal component	the nearby neutron star low-mass x-ray binary, cen x-4, has been in aquiescent state since its last outburst in 1979. typically, quiescent emissionfrom these objects consists of thermal emission (presumably from the neutronstar surface) with an additional hard power-law tail of unknown nature.variability has been observed during quiescence in cen x-4 on both timescalesas short as hundreds of seconds and as long as years. however, the nature ofthis variability is still unknown. early observations seemed to show it was alldue to a variable hard x-ray tail. here, we present new and archivalobservations that contradict this. the most recent suzaku observation of cenx-4 finds it in a historically low state, a factor of 4.4 fainter than thebrightest quiescent observation. as the spectrum during the brightestobservation was comprised of approximately 60% from the thermal component and40% from the power-law component, such a large change cannot be explained byjust power-law variability. spectral fits with a variable thermal component fitthe data well, while spectral fits allowing both the column density and thepower-law to vary do not, leading to the conclusion that the thermal componentmust be variable. interestingly, we also find that the thermal fraction remainsconsistent between all epochs, implying that the thermal and power-law fluxesvary by approximately the same amount. if the emitting area remains unchangedbetween observations, then the effective surface temperature must change.alternatively, if the temperature remains constant, then the emitting area mustchange. the nature of this thermal variability is unclear, but may be explainedby variable low-level accretion.

1008.4727	continued cooling of the crust in the neutron star low-mass x-ray binary  ks 1731-260	some neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries have very long outbursts (lastingseveral years) which can generate a significant amount of heat in the neutronstar crust. after the system has returned to quiescence, the crust thenthermally relaxes. this provides a rare opportunity to study the thermalproperties of neutron star crusts, putting constraints on the thermalconductivity and hence the structure and composition of the crust. ks 1731-260is one of only four systems where this crustal cooling has been observed. here,we present a new chandra observation of this source approximately 8 years afterthe end of the last outburst, and 4 years since the last observation. we findthat the source has continued to cool, with the cooling curve displaying asimple power-law decay. this suggests that the crust has not fully thermallyrelaxed yet, and may continue to cool further. a simple power law decay is incontrast to theoretical cooling models of the crust, which predict that thecrust should now have cooled to the same temperature as the neutron star core.

1205.4222	regulation of black hole winds and jets across the mass scale	we present a study of the mechanical power generated by both winds and jetsacross the black hole mass scale. we begin with the study of ionized x-raywinds and present a uniform analysis using chandra grating spectra. the highquality grating spectra facilitate the characterization of the outflowvelocity, ionization and column density of the absorbing gas. we find that thekinetic power of the winds scales with increasing bolometric luminosity aslog(l_wind) \propto (1.58 \pm 0.07) log(l_bol). this means that smbh may bemore efficient than stellar-mass black holes in launching winds. in addition,the simplicity of the scaling may suggest common driving mechanisms across themass scale. for comparison, we next examine jet production, estimating jetpower based on the energy required to inflate local bubbles. the jet relationis log(l_jet)\propto (1.18\pm0.24) log(l_bol). the energetics of the bubbleassociated with cygnus x-1 are particularly difficult to determine, and thebubble could be a background snr. if we exclude cygnus x-1, then the jetsfollow a consistent relation to the winds within errors but with a highernormalization, log(l_jet) \propto (1.34 \pm 0.50) log(l_bol). the formalconsistency in the wind and jet scaling relations suggests that a commonlaunching mechanism may drive both flows; magnetic processes are viablepossibilities. we also examine winds with especially high velocities, v &gt;0.01c. these ultra-fast outflows tend to resemble the jets more than the winds,indicating we may be observing a regime in which winds become jets. this studyallows for the total power from black hole accretion, both mechanical andradiative, to be characterized in a simple manner and suggests a possibleconnection between winds and jets. finally, we find at low eddington fractions,the jet power is dominant, and at high eddington fractions the wind power isdominant.

1207.0296	observable consequences of merger-driven gaps and holes in black hole  accretion disks	we calculate the observable signature of a black hole accretion disk with agap or hole created by a secondary black hole embedded in the disk. we findthat for an interesting range of parameters of black hole masses (~10^6 to 10^9solar masses), orbital separation (~1 au to ~0.1 pc), and gap width (10 to 190disk scale heights), the missing thermal emission from a gap manifests itselfin an observable decrement in the spectral energy distribution. we presentobservational diagnostics in terms of power-law forms that can be fit toline-free regions in agn spectra or in fluxes from sequences of broad filters.most interestingly, the change in slope in the broken power-law is almostentirely dependent on the width of gap in the accretion disk, which in turn isuniquely determined by mass ratio of the black holes, such that it scalesroughly as q^(5/12). thus one can use spectral observations of the continuum ofbright active galactic nuclei to infer not only the presence of a closelyseparated black hole binary but also the mass ratio. when the black hole mergeropens an entire hole (or cavity) in the inner disk, the broad band sed of theagn or quasar may serve as a diagnostic. such sources should be especiallyluminous in optical bands but intrinsically faint in x-rays (i.e., not merelyobscured). we briefly note that viable candidates may have already beenidentified, though extant detailed modeling of those with high quality datahave not yet revealed an inner cavity.

1307.5249	a distinctive disk-jet coupling in the lowest-mass seyfert, ngc 4395	simultaneous observations of x-rays and radio luminosities have been wellstudied in accreting stellar-mass black holes. these observations are performedin order to understand how mass accretion rates and jetted outflows are linkedin these individual systems. such contemporaneous studies in supermassive blackholes (smbh) are harder to perform, as viscous times scale linearly with mass.however, as ngc 4395 is the lowest known mass seyfert galaxy, we have used itto examine the simultaneous x-ray (swift) and radio (vla) correlation in a smbhin a reasonably timed observing campaign. we find that the intrinsic x-rayvariability is stronger than the radio variability, and that the fluxes areonly weakly or tentatively coupled, similar to prior results obtained in ngc4051. if the corona and the base of the jet are one and the same, this maysuggest that the corona in radio-quiet agn filters disk variations, onlytransferring the strongest and/or most sustained variations into the jet.further, when both ngc 4395 and ngc 4051 are placed on the stellar-mass l_x-l_rplane, they appear to reside on the steeper l_x-l_r track. this suggests thatsmbhs also follow two distinct tracks just as stellar-mass black holes do, andsupports the idea that the same physical disk-jet mechanisms are at play acrossthe mass scale.

1309.1092	the size of the x-ray emitting region in swift j2127.4+5654 via a broad  line region cloud x-ray eclipse	we present results obtained from the time-resolved x-ray spectral analysis ofthe narrow-line-seyfert 1 galaxy swift j2127.4+5654 during a ~130 ks xmm-newtonobservation. we reveal large spectral variations, especially during the first~90 ks of the xmm-newton exposure. the spectral variability can be attributedto a partial eclipse of the x-ray source by an intervening low-ionization/coldabsorbing structure (cloud) with column density n_h = 2.0^{+0.2}_{-0.3}e22cm^-2 which gradually covers and then uncovers the x-ray emitting region withcovering fraction ranging from zero to ~43 per cent. our analysis enables us toconstrain the size, number density, and location of the absorbing cloud withgood accuracy. we infer a cloud size (diameter) of $d_c &lt; 1.5e13 cm,corresponding to a density of n_c &gt; 1.5e9 cm^-3 at a distance of r_c &gt; 4.3e16cm from the central black hole. all of the inferred quantities concur toidentify the absorbing structure with one single cloud associated with thebroad line region of swift j2127.4+5654. we are also able to constrain thex-ray emitting region size (diameter) to be d_s &lt; 2.3e13 cm which, assuming theblack hole mass estimated from single-epoch optical spectroscopy (1.5e7 m_sun),translates into d_s &lt; 10.5 gravitational radii (r_g) with larger sizes (in r_g)being associated with smaller black hole masses, and viceversa. we also confirmthe presence of a relativistically distorted reflection component off the inneraccretion disc giving rise to a broad relativistic fe k emission line and smallsoft excess (small because of the high galactic column density), supporting themeasurement of an intermediate black hole spin in swift j2127.4+5654 that wasobtained from a previous suzaku observation.

1310.0745	the ultraluminous x-ray sources ngc 1313 x-1 and x-2: a broadband study  with nustar and xmm-newton	we present the results of nustar and xmm-newton observations of the twoultraluminous x-ray sources (ulx) ngc 1313 x-1 and x-2. the combined spectralbandpass of the two satellites enables us to produce the first spectrum of x-1between 0.3 and 30 kev, while x-2 is not significantly detected by nustar above10 kev. the nustar data demonstrate that x-1 has a clear cutoff above 10 kev,whose presence was only marginally detectable with previous x-ray observations.this cutoff rules out the interpretation of x-1 as a black hole in a standardlow/hard state, and it is deeper than predicted for the downturn of a broadenediron line in a reflection-dominated regime. the cutoff differs from theprediction of a single-temperature comptonization model. further, a colddisk-like black body component at ~0.3 kev is required by the data, confirmingprevious measurements by xmm-newton only. we observe a spectral transition inx-2, from a state with high luminosity and strong variability to alower-luminosity state with no detectable variability, and we link thisbehavior to a transition from a super-eddington to a sub-eddington regime.

1310.3830	the reflection component from cygnus x-1 in the soft state measured by  nustar and suzaku	the black hole binary cygnus x-1 was observed in late-2012 with the nuclearspectroscopic telescope array (nustar) and suzaku, providing spectral coverageover the ~1-300 kev range. the source was in the soft state with amulti-temperature blackbody, power-law, and reflection components along withabsorption from highly ionized material in the system. the high throughput ofnustar allows for a very high quality measurement of the complex iron lineregion as well as the rest of the reflection component. the iron line isclearly broadened and is well-described by a relativistic blurring model,providing an opportunity to constrain the black hole spin. although the spinconstraint depends somewhat on which continuum model is used, we obtain a*&gt;0.83for all models that provide a good description of the spectrum. however, noneof our spectral fits give a disk inclination that is consistent with the mostrecently reported binary values for cyg x-1. this may indicate that there is a&gt;13 degree misalignment between the orbital plane and the inner accretion disk(i.e., a warped accretion disk) or that there is missing physics in thespectral models.

1311.5514	nustar discovery of a luminosity dependent cyclotron line energy in vela  x-1	we present nustar observations of vela x-1, a persistent, yet highlyvariable, neutron star high-mass x-ray binary (hmxb). two observations weretaken at similar orbital phases but separated by nearly a year. they show verydifferent 3-79 kev flux levels as well as strong variability during eachobservation, covering almost one order of magnitude in flux. these observationsallow, for the first time ever, investigations on kilo-second time-scales ofhow the centroid energies of cyclotron resonant scattering features (crsfs)depend on flux for a persistent hmxb. we find that the line energy of theharmonic crsf is correlated with flux, as expected in the sub-criticalaccretion regime. we argue that vela x-1 has a very narrow accretion columnwith a radius of around 0.4 km that sustains a coulomb interaction dominatedshock at the observed luminosities of lx ~ 3x10^36 erg/s. besides the prominentharmonic line at 55 kev the fundamental line around 25 kev is clearly detected.we find that the strengths of the two crsfs are anti-correlated, which weexplain by photon spawning. this anti-correlation is a possible explanation forthe debate about the existence of the fundamental line. the ratio of the lineenergies is variable with time and deviates significantly from 2.0, also apossible consequence of photon spawning, which changes the shape of the line.during the second observation, vela x-1 showed a short off-state in which thepower-law softened and a cut-off was no longer measurable. it is likely thatthe source switched to a different accretion regime at these low mass accretionrates, explaining the drastic change in spectral shape.

1401.1794	the spin of the black hole gs 1124-683: observation of a retrograde  accretion disk?	we re-examine archival ginga data for the black hole binary system gs1124-683, obtained when the system was undergoing its 1991 outburst. ouranalysis estimates the dimensionless spin parameter a=cj/gm^2 by fitting thex-ray continuum spectra obtained while the system was in the "thermal dominant"state. for likely values of mass and distance, we find the spin to be a=-0.25(-0.64, +0.05) (90% confidence), implying that the disk is retrograde (i.e.rotating antiparallel to the spin axis of the black hole). we note that thismeasurement would be better constrained if the distance to the binary and themass of the black hole were more accurately determined. this result isunaffected by the model used to fit the hard component of the spectrum. inorder to be able to recover a prograde spin, the mass of the black hole wouldneed to be at least 15.25 msun, or the distance would need to be less than 4.5kpc, both of which disagree with previous determinations of the black hole massand distance. if we allow f_col to be free, we obtain no useful spinconstraint. we discuss our results in the context of recent spin measurementsand implications for jet production.

1401.4637	the broadband xmm-newton and nustar x-ray spectra of two ultraluminous  x-ray sources in the galaxy ic 342	we present results for two ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs), ic 342 x-1 andic 342 x-2, using two epochs of xmm-newton and nustar observations separated by$\sim$7 days. we observe little spectral or flux variability above 1 kevbetween epochs, with unabsorbed 0.3--30 kev luminosities being$1.04^{+0.08}_{-0.06} \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for ic 342 x-1 and$7.40\pm0.20 \times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for ic 342 x-2, so that both wereobserved in a similar, luminous state. both sources have a high absorbingcolumn in excess of the galactic value. neither source has a spectrumconsistent with a black hole binary in low/hard state, and both ulxs exhibitstrong curvature in their broadband x-ray spectra. this curvature rules outmodels that invoke a simple reflection-dominated spectrum with a broadened ironline and no cutoff in the illuminating power-law continuum. x-ray spectrum ofic 342 x-1 can be characterized by a soft disk-like black body component at lowenergies and a cool, optically thick comptonization continuum at high energies,but unique physical interpretation of the spectral components remainschallenging. the broadband spectrum of ic 342 x-2 can be fit by either a hot(3.8 kev) accretion disk, or a comptonized continuum with no indication of aseed photon population. although the seed photon component may be masked bysoft excess emission unlikely to be associated with the binary system, combinedwith the high absorption column, it is more plausible that the broadband x-rayemission arises from a simple thin blackbody disk component. secureidentification of the origin of the spectral components in these sources willlikely require broadband spectral variability studies.

1403.4973	reflection from the strong gravity regime in a z=0.658 gravitationally  lensed-quasar	the co-evolution of a supermassive black hole with its host galaxy throughcosmic time is encoded in its spin. at $z&gt;2$, supermassive black holes arethought to grow mostly by merger-driven accretion leading to high spin.however, it is unknown whether below $z\sim1$ these black holes continue togrow via coherent accretion or in a chaotic manner, though clear differencesare predicted in their spin evolution. an established method to measure thespin of black holes is via the study of relativistic reflection features fromthe inner accretion disk. owing to their greater distances, there has hithertobeen no significant detection of relativistic reflection features in amoderate-redshift quasar. here, we use archival data together with a new, deepobservation of a gravitationally-lensed quasar at $z=0.658$ to rigorouslydetect and study reflection in this moderate-redshift quasar. the level ofrelativistic distortion present in this reflection spectrum enables us toconstrain the emission to originate within $\lesssim3$ gravitational radii fromthe black hole, implying a spin parameter $a=0.87^{+0.08}_{-0.15} $ at the$3\sigma$ level of confidence and $a&gt;0.66$ at the $5\sigma$ level. the highspin found here is indicative of growth via coherent accretion for this blackhole, and suggests that black hole growth between $0.5\lesssim z \lesssim 1$occurs principally by coherent rather than chaotic accretion episodes.

1403.6751	a hard x-ray power-law spectral cutoff in centaurus x-4	the low-mass x-ray binary cen x-4 is the brightest and closest (&lt;1.2 kpc)quiescent neutron star transient. previous 0.5-10 kev x-ray observations of cenx-4 in quiescence identified two spectral components: soft thermal emissionfrom the neutron star atmosphere and a hard power-law tail of unknown origin.we report here on a simultaneous observation of cen x-4 with nustar (3-79 kev)and xmm-newton (0.3-10 kev) in 2013 january, providing the first sensitive hardx-ray spectrum of a quiescent neutron star transient. the 0.3-79 kev luminositywas 1.1 x 10^(33) erg/s (for d=1kpc), with around 60 percent in the thermalcomponent. we clearly detect a cutoff of the hard spectral tail above 10 kev,the first time such a feature has been detected in this source class. we showthat thermal comptonization and synchrotron shock origins for the hard x-rayemission are ruled out on physical grounds. however, the hard x-ray spectrum iswell fit by a thermal bremsstrahlung model with an 18 kev electron temperature,which can be understood as arising either in a hot layer above the neutron staratmosphere or in a radiatively-inefficient accretion flow (riaf). the power-lawcutoff energy may be set by the degree of compton cooling of the bremsstrahlungelectrons by thermal seed photons from the neutron star surface. lower thermalluminosities should lead to higher (possibly undetectable) cutoff energies. wecompare cen~x-4's behavior with psr j1023+0038, igr j18245-2452, and xssj12270-4859, which have shown transitions between lmxb and radio pulsar modesat a similar x-ray luminosity.

1408.1934	a rapidly spinning black hole powers the einstein cross	observations over the past 20 years have revealed a strong relationshipbetween the properties of the supermassive black hole (smbh) lying at thecenter of a galaxy and the host galaxy itself. the magnitude of the spin of theblack hole will play a key role in determining the nature of this relationship.to date, direct estimates of black hole spin have been restricted to the localuniverse. herein, we present the results of an analysis of $\sim$ 0.5 ms ofarchival chandra observations of the gravitationally lensed quasar q 2237+305(aka the "einstein-cross"), lying at a redshift of z = 1.695. the boost in fluxprovided by the gravitational lens allows constraints to be placed on the spinof a black hole at such high redshift for the first time. utilizing state ofthe art relativistic disk reflection models, the black hole is found to have aspin of $a_* = 0.74^{+0.06}_{-0.03}$ at the 90% confidence level. placing alower limit on the spin, we find $a_* \geq 0.65$ (4$\sigma$). the high value ofthe spin for the $\rm \sim 10^9~m_{\odot}$ black hole in q 2237+305 lendsfurther support to the coherent accretion scenario for black hole growth. thisis the most distant black hole for which the spin has been directly constrainedto date.

1408.4145	the masses and spins of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes	stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars represent extremes in gravity,density, and magnetic fields. they therefore serve as key objects in the studyof multiple frontiers of physics. in addition, their origin (mainly incore-collapse supernovae) and evolution (via accretion or, for neutron stars,magnetic spindown and reconfiguration) touch upon multiple open issues inastrophysics.  in this review, we discuss current mass and spin measurements and theirreliability for neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, as well as theoverall importance of spins and masses for compact object astrophysics. currentmasses are obtained primarily through electromagnetic observations of binaries,although future microlensing observations promise to enhance our understandingsubstantially. the spins of neutron stars are straightforward to measure forpulsars, but the birth spins of neutron stars are more difficult to determine.in contrast, even the current spins of stellar-mass black holes are challengingto measure. as we discuss, major inroads have been made in black hole spinestimates via analysis of iron lines and continuum emission, with reasonableagreement when both types of estimate are possible for individual objects, andfuture x-ray polarization measurements may provide additional independentinformation. we conclude by exploring the exciting prospects for mass and spinmeasurements from future gravitational wave detections, which are expected torevolutionize our understanding of strong gravity and compact objects.

1409.3248	no time for dead time: timing analysis of bright black hole binaries  with nustar	timing of high-count rate sources with the nustar small explorer missionrequires specialized analysis techniques. nustar was primarily designed forspectroscopic observations of sources with relatively low count-rates ratherthan for timing analysis of bright objects. the instrumental dead time perevent is relatively long (~2.5 msec), and varies by a few percentevent-to-event. the most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noiselevel in the power density spectrum (pds) that cannot be modeled easily withthe standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time. in thispaper, we show that it is possible to exploit the presence of two completelyindependent focal planes and use the cross power density spectrum to obtain agood proxy of the white noise-subtracted pds. thereafter, one can use a montecarlo approach to estimate the remaining effects of dead time, namely afrequency-dependent modulation of the variance and a frequency-independent dropof the sensitivity to variability. in this way, most of the standard timinganalysis can be performed, albeit with a sacrifice in signal to noise relativeto what would be achieved using more standard techniques. we apply thistechnique to nustar observations of the black hole binaries gx 339-4, cyg x-1and grs 1915+105.

1510.06348	flows of x-ray gas reveal the disruption of a star by a massive black  hole	tidal forces close to massive black holes can violently disrupt stars thatmake a close approach. these extreme events are discovered via bright x-ray andoptical/uv flares in galactic centers. prior studies based on modeling decayingflux trends have been able to estimate broad properties, such as the massaccretion rate. here we report the detection of flows of highly ionized x-raygas in high-resolution x-ray spectra of a nearby tidal disruption event.variability within the absorption-dominated spectra indicates that the gas isrelatively close to the black hole. narrow line widths indicate that the gasdoes not stretch over a large range of radii, giving a low volume fillingfactor. modest outflow speeds of a few hundred kilometers per second areobserved, significantly below the escape speed from the radius set byvariability. the gas flow is consistent with a rotating wind from the inner,super-eddington region of a nascent accretion disk, or with a filament ofdisrupted stellar gas near to the apocenter of an elliptical orbit. flows ofthis sort are predicted by fundamental analytical theory and more recentnumerical simulations.

astro-ph;0104421	a detailed study of the 5 hz quasi-periodic oscillations in the bright  x-ray transient and black-hole candidate grs 1739-278	we present a detailed study of the 5 hz quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo)recently discovered in the bright x-ray transient and black-hole candidate grs1739-278 (borozdin &amp; trudolyubov 2000) during a rossi x-ray timing explorerobservation taken on 1996 march 31. in total 6.6 ksec of on-source data wereobtained, divided in two data sets of 3.4 and 3.2 ksec which were separated by2.6 ksec. the 5 hz qpo was only present during the second data set. the qpoincreased in strength from below 2% rms amplitude for photon energies below 4kev to ~5% rms amplitude for energies above 10 kev. the soft qpo photons (below5 kev) lagged the hard ones (above 10 kev) by almost 1.5 radian. besides theqpo fundamental, its first overtone was detected. the strength of the overtoneincreased with photon energy (from &lt;2% rms below 5 kev to ~8% rms above 10kev). although the limited statistics did not allow for an accuratedetermination of the lags of the first overtone, indications are that also forthis qpo the soft photons lagged the hard ones. when the 5 hz qpo was notdetected (i.e., during the first part of the observation), a broad noisecomponent was found for photon energies below 10 kev but it became almost atrue qpo (with a q value of ~1.9) above that energy, with a frequency of ~3 hz.its hard photons preceded the soft ones in a way reminiscent of the 5 hz qpo,strongly suggesting that both features are physically related. we discuss ourfinding in the frame work of low-frequency qpos and their properties in bhcs.

astro-ph;0105182	the new x-ray transient sax j1711.6-3808: decoupling between its 3-20  kev luminosity and its state transitions	we present a study of the correlated spectral and timing behavior of the newx-ray transient sax j1711.6-3808 during its 2001 outburst using data obtainedwith the rxte. we also investigate the correlations between those sourceproperties and the 3-20 kev x-ray luminosity. the behavior of the source duringthe observations can be divided into two distinct state types. during the hardstate, the energy spectra are relatively hard and can be described by only apower-law component, and the characteristic frequencies (i.e., the frequency ofthe 1-7 hz qpos observed for the first time in this source) in the powerspectra are low. however, during the ``soft'' state, the spectra areconsiderably softer (in addition to the power-law component, a soft componentis necessary to fit the spectra) and the frequencies are the highest observed.remarkably, this distinction into two separate states cannot be extrapolated toalso include the 3-20 kev x-ray luminosity. except for one observation, thisluminosity steadily decreased but the hard state was observed both at thehighest and lowest observed luminosities. in contrast, the soft state occurredonly at intermediate luminosities. this clearly demonstrates that the statebehavior of sax j1711.6-3808 is decoupled from its x-ray luminosity and that ifthe x-ray luminosity traces the accretion rate in sax j1711.6-3808, then thestate transitions are not good accretion rate indicators, or vice versa. thedata of sax j1711.6-3808 does not allow us to conclusively determine its exactnature. the source resembles both neutron star and black hole systems when theyhave low luminosities. we discuss our results with respect to the correlatedtiming and spectral behavior observed in other lmxbs and the implications ofour results on the modeling of the outburst light curves of x-ray transients.

astro-ph;0107380	a chandra observation of the long-duration x-ray transient ks 1731-260  in quiescence: too cold a neutron star?	after more than a decade of actively accreting at about a tenth of theeddington critical mass accretion rate, the neutron-star x-ray transient ks1731-260 returned to quiescence in early 2001. we present a chandra/acis-sobservation taken several months after this transition. we detected the sourceat an unabsorbed flux of ~2 x 10^{-13} erg/cm^2/s (0.5-10 kev). for a distanceof 7 kpc, this results in a 0.5-10 kev luminosity of ~1 x 10^{33} erg/s and abolometric luminosity approximately twice that. this quiescent luminosity isvery similar to that of the other quiescent neutron star systems. however, ifthis luminosity is due to the cooling of the neutron star, this low luminositymay indicate that the source spends at least several hundreds of years inquiescence in between outbursts for the neutron star to cool. if true, then itmight be the first such x-ray transient to be identified and a class ofhundreds of similar systems may be present in the galaxy. alternatively,enhanced neutrino cooling could occur in the core of the neutron star whichwould cool the star more rapidly. however, in that case the neutron star in ks1731-260 would be more massive than those in the prototypical neutron startransients (e.g., aql x-1 or 4u 1608-52).

astro-ph;0210399	x-ray jet emission from the black hole x-ray binary xte j1550-564 with  chandra in 2000	we have discovered an x-ray jet due to material ejected from the black holex-ray transient xte j1550-564. the discovery was first reported by corbel etal. (science, 298, 196 and astro-ph/0210224), and here, we present an analysisof the three chandra observations made between 2000 june and 2000 september.for these observations, a source is present that moves in an eastward directionaway from the point source associated with the compact object. the separationbetween the new source and the compact object changes from 21.3 arcseconds injune to 23.4 arcseconds in september, implying a proper motion of 21.2 +/- 7.2mas/day, a projected separation of 0.31-0.85 pc and an apparent jet velocitybetween 0.34 +/- 0.12 and 0.93 +/- 0.32 times the speed of light for a sourcedistance range of d = 2.8-7.6 kpc. these observations represent the first timethat an x-ray jet proper motion measurement has been obtained for any accretionpowered galactic or extra-galactic source. while this work deals with the jetto the east of the compact object, the western jet has also been detected inthe x-ray and radio bands. the most likely scenario is that the eastern jet isthe approaching jet and that the jet material was ejected from the black holein 1998. along with a 1998 vlbi proper motion measurement, the chandra propermotion indicates that the eastern jet decelerated between 1998 and 2000. wepresent results on the morphology and energy spectrum of the jet. we cannotdefinitively determine the x-ray emission mechanism, but a synchrotron originis viable and may provide the simplest explanation for the observations.

astro-ph;0309741	chandra detections of two quiescent black hole x-ray transients	using the chandra x-ray observatory, we have detected the black holetransients v4641 sgr and xte j1859+226 in their low luminosity, quiescentstates. the 0.3-8 kev luminosities are (4.0^(+3.3)_(-2.4))e31 (d/7 kpc)^2 erg/sand (4.2^(+4.8)_(-2.2))e31 (d/11 kpc)^2 erg/s for v4641 sgr and xte j1859+226,respectively. with the addition of these 2 systems, 14 out of the 15 transientswith confirmed black holes (via compact object mass measurements) now havemeasured quiescent luminosities or sensitive upper limits. the only exceptionis grs 1915+105, which has not been in quiescence since its discovery in 1992.the luminosities for v4641 sgr and xte j1859+226 are consistent with the medianluminosity of 2e31 erg/s for the systems with previous detections. our analysissuggests that the quiescent x-ray spectrum of v4641 sgr is harder than for theother systems in this group, but, due to the low statistical quality of thespectrum, it is not clear if v4641 sgr is intrinsically hard or if the columndensity is higher than the interstellar value. focusing on v4641 sgr, wecompare our results to theoretical models for x-ray emission from black holesin quiescence. also, we obtain precise x-ray positions for v4641 sgr and xtej1859+226 via cross-correlation of the x-ray sources detected near our targetswith ir sources in the 2 micron all-sky survey catalog.

astro-ph;0310144	the hard quiescent spectrum of the neutron-star x-ray transient exo  1745-248 in the globular cluster terzan 5	we present a chandra observation of the globular cluster terzan 5 duringtimes when the neutron-star x-ray transient exo 1745-248 located in thiscluster was in its quiescent state. we detected the quiescent system with a(0.5-10 kev) luminosity of ~2 x 10^{33} ergs/s. this is similar to severalother neutron-star transients observed in their quiescent states. however, thequiescent x-ray spectrum of exo 1745--48 was dominated by a hard power-lawcomponent instead of the soft component that usually dominates the quiescentemission of other neutron-star x-ray transients. this soft component could notconclusively be detected in exo 1745-248 and we conclude that it contributed atmost 10% of the quiescent flux in the energy range 0.5-10 kev. exo 1745-248 isonly the second neutron-star transient whose quiescent spectrum is dominated bythe hard component (sax j1808.4-3658 is the other one). we discuss possibleexplanations for this unusual behavior of exo 1745-248, its relationship toother quiescent neutron-star systems, and the impact of our results onunderstanding quiescent x-ray binaries. we also discuss the implications of ourresults on the way the low-luminosity x-ray sources in globular clusters areclassified.

astro-ph;0310612	monitoring chandra observations of the quasi-persistent neutron-star  x-ray transient mxb 1659-29 in quiescence: the cooling curve of the heated  neutron-star crust	we have observed the quasi-persistent neutron-star x-ray transient andeclipsing binary mxb 1659-29 in quiescence on three occasions with chandra. thepurpose of our observations was to monitor the quiescent behavior of the sourceafter its last prolonged (~2.5 years) outburst which ended in september 2001.the x-ray spectra of the source are consistent with thermal radiation from theneutron-star surface. we found that the bolometric flux of the source decreasedby a factor of 7-9 over the time-span of 1.5 years between our first and lastchandra observations. the effective temperature also decreased, by a factor of1.6-1.7. the decrease in time of the bolometric flux and effective temperaturecan be described using exponential decay functions, with e-folding times of 0.7and ~3 years, respectively. our results are consistent with the hypothesis thatwe observed a cooling neutron-star crust which was heated considerably duringthe prolonged accretion event and which is still out of thermal equilibriumwith the neutron-star core. we could only determine upper-limits for anyluminosity contribution due to the thermal state of the neutron-star core. therapid cooling of the neutron-star crust implies that it has a large thermalconductivity. our results also suggest that enhanced cooling processes arepresent in the neutron-star core.

astro-ph;0406057	chandra observations of the accretion-driven millisecond x-ray pulsars  xte j0929-314 and xte j1751-305 in quiescence	(abridge) we observed the accreting millisecond x-ray pulsars xte j0929-314and xte j1751-305 in their quiescent states using chandra. from xte j0929-314we detected 22 photons (0.3-8 kev) in 24.4 ksec, resulting in a count rate of 9x 10^{-4} c/s. the small number of photons detected did not allow for adetailed spectral analysis, but we can demonstrate that the spectrum is harderthan simple thermal emission which is what is usually presumed to arise from acooling neutron star that has been heated during the outbursts. assuming apower-law model for the spectrum, we obtain a power-law index of ~1.8 and anunabsorbed flux of 6 x 10^{-15} ergs/s/cm^2 (0.5-10 kev), resulting in aluminosity of 7 x 10^{31} (d/10 kpc)^2 ergs/s, with d in kpc. no thermalcomponent could be detected; such a component contributed at most 30% to the0.5-10 kev flux. variability in the count rate of xte j0929-314 was observed atthe 95% confidence level. we did not conclusively detect xte j1751-305 in our43 ksec observation, with 0.5-10 kev flux upper limits between 0.2 and 2.7 x10^{-14} ergs/s/cm^2 depending on assumed spectral shape, resulting inluminosity upper limits of 0.2 - 2 x 10^{32} (d/8 kpc)^2 ergs/s. we compare ourresults with those obtained for other neutron-star x-ray transients in theirquiescent state. using simple accretion disk physics in combination with ourmeasured quiescent luminosity of xte j0929-314 and the luminosity upper limitsof xte j1751-305, and the known spin frequency of the neutron stars, we couldconstrain the magnetic field of the neutron stars in xte j0929-314 and xtej1751-305 to be less than 3 x 10^9 (d/10 kpc) and 3 - 7 x 10^8 (d/8 kpc) gauss(depending on assumed spectral shape of the quiescent spectrum), respectively.

astro-ph;0407448	x-ray variability during the quiescent state of the neutron-star x-ray  transient in the globular cluster ngc 6440	the globular cluster ngc 6440 is known to harbor a bright neutron-star x-raytransient. we observed the globular cluster with chandra on two occasions whenthe bright transient was in its quiescent state in july 2000 and june 2003(both observations were made nearly 2 years after the end of their precedingoutbursts). the quiescent spectrum during the first observation is wellrepresented by a two component model (a neutron-star atmosphere model plus apower-law component which dominates at energies above 2 kev). during the secondobservation (which was roughly of equal duration to the first observation) wefound that the power-law component could no longer be detected. our spectralfits indicate that the effective temperature of the neutron-star surface wasconsistent between the two observations. we conclude that the effect of thechange in power-law component caused the 0.5-10 kev flux to be a factor of ~2lower during the second observation compared to the first observation. wediscuss plausible explanations for the variations, including variable residualaccretion onto the neutron star magnetosphere or some variation in theinteraction of the pulsar wind with the matter still outflowing from thecompanion star.

astro-ph;0512595	a precessing ring model for low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations	we develop a simple physical model to describe the most common type oflow-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) seen in a number of accretingblack hole systems, as well as the shape of the relativistically broadened ironemission lines that often appear simultaneously in such sources. the model isbased on an inclined ring of hot gas that orbits the black hole along geodesictrajectories. for spinning black holes, this ring will precess around the spinaxis of the black hole at the lense-thirring (``frame-dragging'') frequency.using a relativistic ray-tracing code, we calculate x-ray light curves andobserved energy spectra as a function of the radius and tilt angle of the ring,the spin magnitude, and the inclination of the black hole. the model predictshigher-amplitude qpos for systems with high inclinations, as seen in a growingnumber of black hole binary systems. we find that the rossi x-ray timingexplorer observations of low-frequency qpos in grs 1915+105 are consistent witha ring of radius r ~ 10m orbiting a black hole with spin a/m ~0.5 andinclination angle of i ~ 70 deg. finally, we describe how future x-ray missionsmay be able to use simultaneous timing and spectroscopic observations tomeasure the black hole spin and probe the inner-most regions of the accretiondisk.
