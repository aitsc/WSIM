0706.1595	correlations between x-ray spectral and timing characteristics in cyg  x-2	correlations between the quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) and the spectralpower-law index have been reported for a number of black hole candidate sourcesand for four neutron star (ns) sources, 4u 0614+09, 4u 1608-52, 4u 1728-34 andsco x-1. an examination of qpo frequencies and index relationship in cyg x-2 isreported herein. the rxte spectrum of cyg x-2 can be adequately represented bya simple two-component model of compton up-scattering with a soft photonelectron temperature of about 0.7 kev and an iron k-line. inferred spectralpower-law index shows correlation with the low qpo frequencies. we find thatthe thomson optical depth of the compton cloud (cc) tau, in framework ofspherical geometry, is in the range of ~4-6, which is consistent with theneutron star's surface being obscured. the ns high frequency pulsations arepresumably suppressed as a result of photon scattering off cc electrons becauseof such high values of tau. we also point out a number of similarities in termstiming (presence of low and high frequency qpos) and spectral (high cc opticaldepth and low cc plasma temperature) appearances between cyg x-2 and sco x-1.

0902.2852	determination of black hole masses in galactic black hole binaries using  scaling of spectral and variability characteristics	we present a study of correlations between x-ray spectral and timingproperties observed from a number of galactic black hole (bh) binaries duringhard-soft state spectral evolution. we analyze 17 transition episodes from 8 bhsources observed with rxte. our scaling technique for bh mass determinationuses a correlation between spectral index and quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo)frequency. in addition, we use a correlation between index and thenormalization of the disk "seed" component to cross-check the bh massdetermination and estimate the distance to the source. while the index-qpocorrelations for two given sources contain information on the ratio of the bhmasses in those sources, the index-normalization correlations depend on theratio of the bh masses and the distance square ratio. in fact, theindex-normalization correlation also discloses the index-mass accretion ratesaturation effect given that the normalization of disk "seed" photon supply isproportional to the disk mass accretion rate. we present arguments that thisobservationally established index saturation effect is a signature of the bulkmotion (converging) flow onto black hole which was early predicted by thedynamical comptonization theory. we use gro j1655-40 as a primary referencesource for which the bh mass, distance and inclination angle are evaluated bydynamical measurements with unprecedented precision among other galactic bhsources. we apply our scaling technique to determine bh masses and distancesforcygnus x-1, gx 339-4, 4u 1543-47, xte j1550-564, xte j1650-500, h 1743-322and xte j1859-226. good agreement of our results for sources with known valuesof bh masses and distance provides an independent verification for our scalingtechnique.

0904.4682	discovery of red-skewed k_alpha iron line in cyg x-2 with suzaku	we report on the suzaku observation of neutron star low-mass x-ray binarycygnus x-2 which reveals a presence of the iron k_alpha emission line. the lineprofile shows a significant red wing. this discovery increases the number ofneutron star sources where red-skewed iron lines were observed and stronglysuggests that this phenomenon is common not only in black holes but also inother types of accreting compact objects. we examine the line profile in termsof models which attribute its production to the relativistic effects due toreflection of x-ray radiation from a cold accretion disk and also as a resultof the line formation in the extended wind/outflow configuration. both modelsare able to adequately represent the observed line profile. we consider theresults of line modeling in the context of subsecond variability. while we wereunable to conclusively disqualify one of the models, we find that the windparadigm has several advantages over the relativistic disk reflection model.

0906.1490	on the non-relativistic origin of red-skewed iron lines in cv, neutron  star and black hole sources	we perform the analysis of the iron k_alpha lines detected in three sourcesrepresenting of three types of accreting compact sources: cataclysmic variable(cv) gk per, neutron star (ns) serpens x-1 and black hole (bh) gx 339-4. wefind, using data from epic-pn camera on-board xmm-newton observatory,that theiron k_alpha emission line in gk per has a noticeable red-skewed profile. wecompare the gk per asymmetric line with the red-skewed lines observed byxmm-newton in serpens x-1 and gx 339-4. the observation of the k_alpha emissionwith red-skewed features in cv gk per cannot be related to the redshift effectsof general relativity (gr). therefore, if the mechanism of the k_alpha-lineformation is the same in cvs, nss and bhs then it is evident that the greffects would be ruled out as a cause of red skewness of k_alpha line. the linereprocessing in an outflowing wind has been recently suggested an alternativemodel for a broad red-shifted iron line formation. in the framework of theoutflow scenario the red-skewed iron line is formed in the strong extended winddue to its illumination by the radiation emanating from the innermost part ofthe accreting material. in this paper we demonstrate that the asymmetric shapesof the lines detected from these cv, ns and bh sources are well described withthe wind (outflow) model. while this fact is hard to reconcile with therelativistic models, it is consistent with the outflowing gas washing out highfrequency modulations of the radiation presumably originated in the innermostpart of the source.

1005.5362	new evidence for a black hole in the compact binary cygnus x-3	the bright and highly variable x-ray and radio source known as cygnus x-3 wasamong the first x-ray sources discovered, yet it remains in many ways anenigma. its known to consist of a massive, wolf-rayet primary in an extremelytight orbit with a compact object. yet one of the most basic of parameters -the mass of the compact object - is not known. nor is it even clear whether itsis a neutron star or a black hole. in this paper we present our analysis of thebroad-band high-energy continua covering a substantial range in luminosity andspectral morphology. we apply these results to a recently identified scalingrelationship which has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of thecompact object mass in a number of accretion powered binaries. this analysisleads us to conclude that the compact object in cygnus x-3 has a mass greaterthan $4.2m_\odot$ thus clearly indicative of a black hole and as such resolvinga long-standing issue. the full range of uncertainty in our analysis and fromusing a range of recently published distance estimates constrains the compactobject mass to lie between $4.2m_\odot$ and $14.4m_\odot$. our favoredestimate, based on a 9.0 kpc distance estimate is $\sim 10 m_\odot$ with theerror margin of 3.2 solar masses. this result may thus pose challenges toshared-envelope evolutionary models of compact binaries, as well asestablishing cygnus x-3 as the first confirmed accretion-powered galacticgamma-ray source.

1008.4319	on the nature of the compact object in ss~433. observational evidence of  x-ray photon index saturation	we present an analysis of the x-ray spectral properties observed from blackhole candidate (bhc) binary ss~433. we have analyzed rxte data from thissource, coordinated with green bank interferometer/ratan-600. we show thatss~433 undergoes a x-ray spectral transition from the low hard state (lhs) tothe intermediate state (is). we show that the x-ray broad-band energy spectraduring all spectral states are well fit by a sum of so called ``bulk motioncomptonization (bmc) component'' and by two (broad and narrow) gaussians forthe continuum and line emissions respectively. in addition to these spectralmodel components we also find a strong feature that we identify as a"blackbody-like (bb)" component which color temperature is in the range of 4-5kev in 24 is spectra during the radio outburst decay in ss~433. ourobservational results on the "high temperature bb" bump leads us to suggest thepresence of gravitationally redshifted annihilation line emission in thissource. i\ we have also established the photon index saturation at about 2.3 inindex vs mass accretion correlation. this index-mass accretion correlationallows us to evaluate the low limit of black hole (bh) mass of compact objectin ss~433, m_{bh}&gt; 2 solar masses, using the scaling method using bhc gx 339-4as a reference source. our estimate of the bh mass in ss 433 is consistent withrecent bh mass measurement using the radial-velocity measurements of the binarysystem by hillwig &amp; gies who find that m_{x}=(4.3+/-0.8 solar masses. this isthe smallest bh mass found up to now among all bh sources. moreover, the indexsaturation effect versus mass accretion rate revealed in ss~433, like in anumber of other bh candidates, is the strong observational evidence for thepresence of a bh in ss~433.

1009.4377	implication of the observable spectral cutoff energy evolution in xte  j1550-564	the physical mechanisms responsible for production of the non-thermalemission in accreting black holes (bh) should be imprinted in the observationalapperances of the power law tails in the x-ray spectra from these objects.different spectral states exhibited by galactic bh binaries allow examinationof the photon upscattering under different accretion regimes. we revisit thedata collected by rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) from the bh x-ray binaryxte j1550-564 during two periods of x-ray activity in 1998 and 2000 focusing onthe behavior of the high energy cutoff of the power law part of the spectrum.for the 1998 outburst the transition from the low-hard state to theintermediate state was accompanied by a gradual decrease in the cutoff energywhich then showed an abrupt reversal to a clear increasing trend as the sourceevolved to the very high and high-soft states. the 2000 outburst showed onlythe decreasing part of this pattern. notably, the photon indexes correspondingto the cutoff increase for the 1998 event are much higher than the index valuesreached during the 2000 rise transition. we attribute this difference in thecutoff energy behavior to the different partial contributions of the thermaland non-thermal (bulk motion) comptonization in photon upscattering. namely,during the 1998 event the higher accretion rate presumably provided morecooling to the comptonizing media and thus reducing the effectiveness of thethermal upscattering process. under these conditions the bulk motion takes aleading role in boosting the input soft photons. monte carlo simulations of thecomptonization in a bulk motion region near an accreting black hole by laurent&amp; titarchuk 2010 strongly support this scenario.

1011.3427	spectral index as a function of mass accretion rate in black hole  sources. monte-carlo simulations and an analytical description	in this paper, we present theoretical arguments that the observationallyestablished index saturation effect vs mass accretion rate is a signature ofthe bulk (converging) flow onto the black hole. we demonstrate that the indexsaturation value depends on the plasma temperature of converging flow. weself-consistently calculate the compton cloud (cc) plasma temperature as afunction of mass accretion rate using the energy balance between energydissipation and compton cooling. we explain the observable phenomenon, index-mdot correlations using a monte-carlo simulation of radiative processes in theinnermost part (cc) of a bh source and we account for the comptonizationprocesses in the presence of thermal and bulk motions, as basic types of plasmamotion. we show that, when mdot increases, bh sources evolve to high and verysoft states (hss and vss, respectively), in which the strong blackbody-like andsteep power-law components are formed in the resulting x-ray spectrum. thesimultaneous detections of these two components strongly depends on sensitivityof high energy instruments, given that the relative contribution of the hardpower-law tail in the resulting vss spectrum can be very low, which is why, todate {\it rxte} observations of the vss x-ray spectrum has been characterizedby the presence of the strong bb-like component only. we also predict specificpatterns for high-energy efold (cutoff) energy (e_{fold}) evolution with mdotfor thermal and dynamical (bulk) comptonization cases. for the former case,e_{fold} monotonically decreases with mdot, in the latter case, thee_{fold}-decrease is followed by its increase at high values of mdot. theobservational evolution of e_{fold} vs mdot can be one more test for thepresence of a converging flow effect in the formation of the resulting spectrain the close vicinity of bhs.

1204.3297	an upscattering spectral formation model for the prompt emission of  gamma-ray bursts	we propose a model for the spectral formation of gamma ray burst (grb) promptemission, where the phenomenological band's function is usually applied todescribe the grb prompt emission. we suggest that the grb prompt emission ismainly a result of two upscattering processes. the first process is thecomptonization of relatively cold soft photons of the star off electrons of ahot shell of plasma of temperature t_e of the order of 10^{9} k (or kt_e~100kev) that moves sub-relativistically with the bulk velocity v_b substantiallyless than the speed of light c. in this phase, the comptonization parameter yis high and the interaction between a blackbody-like soft seed photonpopulation and hot electrons leads to formation of a saturated comptonizationspectrum modified by the sub-relativistic bulk outflow. the second process isan upscattering of the previously comptonized spectrum by the plasma outflowonce it becomes relativistic. this process gives rise to the high-energypower-law component above the peak in the ef(e)-diagram where f(e) is theenergy flux. the latter process can be described by a convolution of thecomptonized spectrum with a broken-power-law green function. possible physicalscenarios for this second upscattering process are discussed. in the frameworkof our model, we give an interpretation of the amati relation between theintrinsic spectral peak photon energy and radiated energy or luminosity, and wepropose a possible explanation of the grb temporal variability.

(2012). by consideringthe few spectra for which the simple band function does not provide a fullyacceptable fit to the data (frontera et al. 2012), only in one case we find astatistically significant better fit by adding a blackbody to this function. weconfirm the results found fitting the batse spectra alone with a blackbody plusa power law. instead when the batse grb spectra are joined to those obtainedwith wfcs (2--28 kev), this model becomes unacceptable in most of timeintervals in which we subdivide the grb light curves. we find instead that thecomptonization model is always acceptable, even in the few cases in which theband function is inconsistent with the data. we discuss the implications ofthese results.

astro-ph;0005375	delta-invariant for quasi-periodic oscillations and physical parameters  of 4u 0614+09 binary	the recently formulated two oscillator (to) model interprets the lowest ofthe kilohertz frequencies of the twin peak quasi-periodic oscillations in x-ray binaries as the keplerian frequency nu_k. the high twin frequency nu_h inthis model holds the upper hybrid frequency relation to the rotationalfrequency of the neutron star's magnetosphere omega: nu_h^2=nu_k^2+4(omega/2pi)^2. the vector omega is assumed to have an angle delta with thenormal to the disk. the first oscillator in the to model allows one tointerpret the horizontal branch observed below 100 hz as the lower mode of thekeplerian oscillator under the influence of the coriolis force, with frequencynu_l being dependent on nu_h, nu_k and delta. for some stars such as 4u0614+09, sco x-1 and 4u 1702-42, nu_h, nu_k and nu_l have been observedsimultaneously providing the opportunity to check the central prediction of theto model: the constancy of delta for a particular source. given theconsiderable variation of each of these three frequencies, the existence of anobservational invariant with a clear physical interpretation as a globalparameter of the neutron star magnetosphere is an important test of the tomodel. using the results of recent observations of 4u 0614+09 we verify theexistence of this invariant and determine the angle delta=15^o.6+/- 0.^o5 forthis star. the second oscillator in the model deals with a radial (presumablysound) oscillation and diffuse process in the viscous layer surrounding theneutron star. our analysis of the viscous oscillation frequency nu_v and thebreak frequency nu_b of the diffusion shows that the spin value of the innerboundary of the transition layer for 4u 0614+09 is at least two times more thanvalues for 4u 1728-34 and sco x-1.

astro-ph;0110277	timing and spectral properties of x-ray emission from the converging  flows onto black hole: monte-carlo simulations	we demonstrate that a x-ray spectrum of a converging inflow (ci) onto a blackhole is the sum of a thermal (disk) component and the convolution of somefraction of this component with the comptonization spread (green's) function.the latter component is seen as an extended power law at energies much higherthan the characteristic energy of the soft photons. we show that the highenergy photon production (source function) in the ci atmosphere is distributedwith the characteristic maximum at about the photon bending radius, 1.5r_s,independently of the seed (soft) photon distribution. we show that highfrequency oscillations of the soft photon source in this region lead to theoscillations of the high energy part of the spectrum but not of the thermalcomponent. the high frequency oscillations of the inner region are notsignificant in the thermal component of the spectrum. we further demonstratethat doppler and recoil effects (which are responsible for the formation of theci spectrum) are related to the hard (positive) and soft (negative) time lagsbetween the soft and hard photon energy channels respectively.

(2) there is a strong correlationbetween an inferred m_{ns} and the hbo frequency in the rpm frameworks.

astro-ph;0205107	power-law tails from dynamical comptonization in converging flows	the effects of bulk motion comptonization on the spectral formation in aconverging flow onto a black hole are investigated. the problem is tackled bymeans of both a fully relativistic, angle-dependent transfer code and asemi-analytical, diffusion-approximation method. we find that a power-lawhigh-energy tail is a ubiquitous feature in converging flows and that the twoapproaches produce consistent results at large enough accretion rates, whenphoton diffusion holds. our semi-analytical approach is based on an expansionin eigenfunctions of the diffusion equation. contrary to previousinvestigations based on the same method we find that, although the power-lawtail at really large energies is always dominated by the flatter spectral mode,the slope of the hard x-ray portion of the spectrum is dictated by the secondmode and it approaches gamma=3 at large accretion rate, irrespective of themodel parameters. the photon index in the tail is found to be largelyindependent on the spatial distribution of soft seed photons when the accretionrate is either quite low (&lt; 5 in eddington units) or sufficiently high (&gt; 10).on the other hand, the spatial distribution of source photons controls thephoton index at intermediate accretion rates, when gamma switches from thefirst to the second mode. our analysis confirms that a hard tail with photonindex gamma &lt;3 is produced by the up-scattering of primary photons ontoinfalling electrons if the central object is a black hole.

astro-ph;0207552	why is it difficult to detect a millisecond pulsar in neutron star x-ray  binaries?	we explain why it is possible to detect directly x-ray emission from near thesurface of the neutron star (ns) in sax j1808.4-3658 but not in most otherlow-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), with the exception that emission from thesurface can be seen during bursts events. we show that the x-ray emission fromsax j1808.4-3658 mostly originates in the comptonization process in arelatively optical thin hot region (with an optical depth $\tau_0$ around 4 andtemperature is around 20 kev). such a transparent region does not prevent usfrom detecting coherent x-ray pulsation due to hot spots on the ns surface.when the characteristic scattering time in the region is of order of inverserotational frequency omega or higher then the amplitude of the harmonicoscillation decays exponentially with (tau_0 x omega). we give a precise modelfor the loss of modulation, such suppression of the qpo amplitude due toscattering can explain the disappearance of khz qpos with increasing qpofrequency. we also formulate general conditions under which the millisecondx-ray pulsation can be detected in lmxbs.  we demonstrate that the observed soft phase lag of the pulsed emission is aresult of the downscattering of the hard x-ray photons in the relatively coldmaterial near the ns surface. in the framework of this downscattering model wepropose a method to determine the atmosphere density in that region fromsoft-lag measurements.

astro-ph;0208212	on the low and high frequency correlation in quasi-periodic oscillations  among white dwarfs, neutron star and black hole binaries	we interpret the correlation over five orders of magnitude between highfrequency and low frequency in a quasi-periodic oscillations (qpo) found bypsaltis, belloni &amp; van der klis (1999) for black hole (bh), neutron star (ns)systems and then extended by mauche (2002) to white dwarf (wd) binaries. weargue that the observed correlation is a natural consequence of the kepleriandisk flow adjustment to the innermost sub-keplerian boundary conditions nearthe central object. in the framework of the transition layer model the highfrequency is related to the keplerian frequency at the outer (adjustment)radius and the low frequency is related to the magnetoacoustic oscillation (ma)frequency. using a relation between the ma frequency the magnetic and gaspressure and the density and the hydrostatic equilibrium condition in the diskwe infer a linear correlation the keplerian frequency and the ma frequency. weestimate the magnetic field strength near the tl outer radius for bhs nss andwds. the fact that the observed high-low frequency correlation over five ordersof magnitude is valid for bhs, nss, and down to wds strongly rules outrelativistic models for qpo phenomena. we come to the conclusion that the qposobservations indicate the adjustment of the geometrically thin disk tosub-keplerian motion near the central object. this effect is a common featurefor a wide class of systems, starting from white dwarf binaries up to blackhole binaries.

astro-ph;0208423	effects of resonance in quasiperiodic oscillators of neutron star  binaries	using a large quantity of rossi x-ray timing explorer data presented in theliterature i offer a detailed investigation into the accuracy of quasiperiodicoscillations (qpo) frequency determination. the qpo phenomenon seen in x-raybinaries is possibly a result of the resonance of the intrinsic (eigen)oscillations and harmonic driving forces of the system. i show that theresonances, in the presence of the damping of oscillations, occur at thefrequencies which are systematically and randomly shifted with respect to theeigenfrequencies of the system. the shift value strongly depends on the dampingrate which is measured by the halfwidth of the qpo feature. taking into accountthis effect i analyze the qpo data for four z-sources: sco x-1, gx 340+0, gx5-1, gx 17+2 and two atoll sources: 4u 1728-34, 4u 0614+09. the transitionlayer model (tlm) predicts the existence of the invariant quantity: delta, aninclination angle of the magnetospheric axis with respect to the normal to thedisk. i calculate delta and the error bars of delta using the resonance shiftand i find that the inferred delta-values are consistent with constants forthese four z-sources, where horizontal branch oscillation and kilohertzfrequencies have been detected and correctly identified. it is shown that theinferred delta are in the range between 5.5 and 6.5 degrees. i conclude thatthe tlm seems to be compatible with data.

astro-ph;0611156	effects of downscattering on the continuum and line spectra in powerful  wind environment. monte carlo simulations, analytical results and data  analysis	in paper by titarchuk &amp; shrader the general formulation and results forphoton reprocessing (downscattering) that included recoil and comptonizationeffects due to divergence of the flow were presented. here we show the montecarlo (mc) simulated continuum and line spectra. we also provide an analyticaldescription of the simulated continuum spectra using the diffusionapproximation. we have simulated the propagation of monochromatic and continuumphotons in a bulk outflow from a compact object. electron scattering of thephotons within the expanding flow leads to a decrease of their energy which isof first order in v/c (where v is the outflow velocity). the downscatteringeffect of first order in v/c in the diverging flow is explained bysemi-analytical calculations and confirmed by mc simulations. we conclude thatredshifted lines and downscattering bumps are intrinsic properties of thepowerful outflows for which thomson optical depth is greater than one. wefitted our model line profiles to the observations using four free parameters,\beta=v/c, optical depth of the wind \tau, the wind temperature kt_e and theoriginal line photon energy e_0. we show how the primary spectrum emitted closeto the black hole is modified by reprocessing in the warm wind. in theframework of the our wind model the fluorescent iron line k_alpha is formed inthe partly ionized wind as a result of illumination by central source continuumphotons. the demonstrated application of our outflow model to the xmmobservations of mcg 6-30-15, and to the asca observations of gro j1655-40,points out a potential powerful spectral diagnostic for probes of theoutflow-central object connection in galactic and extragalactic bh sources.

astro-ph;0612675	power spectra of black holes and neutron stars as a probe of  hydrodynamical structure of the source. diffusion theory and its application  to cyg x-1 and cyg x-2 x-ray observations	we present a model of fourier power density spectrum (pds) formation inaccretion powered x-ray binary systems derived from the first principles of thediffusion theory. timing properties of x-ray emission are considered to be aresult of diffusive propagation of the driving perturbations in a boundedmedium. we prove that the integrated power p_x of the resulting pds is only asmall fraction of the integrated power p_dr of the driving oscillations, whichis distributed over the disk. the resulting pds continuum is a sum of twocomponents, a low frequency (lf) component which presumably originates in anextended accretion disk and a high frequency (hf) component which originates inthe innermost part of the source (compton cloud or corona). the lf pdscomponent has a power-law shape with index of 1.0-1.5 at higher frequencies(``red'' noise) and a flat spectrum below a characteristic (break) frequency(``white'' noise). this white-red noise (wrn) continuum spectrum holdsinformation about the physical parameters of the bounded extended medium,diffusion time scale and the dependence law of viscosity vs radius. we applyour model of the pds to a sample of rxte and exosat timing data from cyg x-1and cyg x-2 which describes adequately the spectral transitions in thesesources.

astro-ph;0702453	energy dependent ~100 \mu s time lags as observational evidence of  comptonization effects in the neutron star plasma environment	we present a comptonization model for the observed properties of theenergy-dependent soft/hard time lags and pulsed fraction (amplitude) associatedwith the pulsed emission of a neutron star (ns). we account for the soft lagsby downscattering of hard x-ray photons in the relatively cold plasma of thedisk or ns surface. a fraction of the soft x-ray photons coming from the diskor ns surface upscatter off hot electrons in the accretion column. this effectleads to hard lags as a result of thermal comptonization of the soft photons.this model reproduces the observed soft and hard lags due to the down- andupscattered radiation as a function of the electron number densities of thereflector, n_{e}^{ref}, and the accretion column, n_{e}^{hot}. in the case ofthe accretion-powered millisecond pulsars igr j00291+5934, xte j1751-305, andsax j1808.4-3658, the observed time lags agree well with the model. soft lagsare observed only if n_e^{ref} &lt;&lt; n_e^{hot}. scattering of the pulsed emissionin the ns environment may account for the observed time lags as a non-monotonicfunction of energy. the time lag measurements can be used as a probe of theinnermost parts of the ns and accretion disk. we determine the upper and lowerlimits of the density variation in this region using the observed time lags.the observed energy-dependent pulsed amplitude allows us to infer a variationof the thomson optical depth of the compton cloud in which the accretion columnis embedded.

astro-ph;0703431	correlations between x-ray spectral characteristics and quasi-periodic  oscillations in sco x-1	correlations between 1-10 hz quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) and spectralpower law index have been reported for black hole (bh) candidate sources andone neutron star source, 4u 1728-34. an examination of qpo frequency and indexrelationships in sco x-1 is reported herein. we discovered that sco x-1,representing z-source groups, can be adequately modeled by a simpletwo-component model of compton up-scattering with a soft photon electrontemperature of about 0.4 kev, plus an iron k-line. the results show a strongcorrelation between spectral power law index and khz qpos. because sco x-1radiates near the eddington limit, one can infer that the geometricalconfiguration of the compton cloud (cc) is quasi-spherical because of highradiation pressure in the cc. thus, we conclude that the high thomson opticaldepth of the compton cloud, in the range of ~5-6 from the best-fit modelparameters, is consistent with the neutron star's surface being obscured bymaterial. moreover, a spin frequency of sco x-1 is likely suppressed due tophoton scattering off cc electrons. additionally, we demonstrate how the powerspectrum evolves when sco x-1 transitions from the horizontal branch to thenormal branch.

astro-ph;0703441	determination of black hole mass in cyg x-1 by scaling of spectral  index-qpo frequency correlation	it is well established that timing and spectral properties of galactic blackhole (bh) x-ray binaries (xrb) are strongly correlated. in particular, it hasbeen shown that low frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) frequency -photon index correlation curves have a specific pattern. in a number of sourcesthe shape of the index-low frequency qpo correlations are self-similar with aposition offset in the qpo frequency-gamma plane. titarchuk &amp; fiorito presentedstrong theoretical and observational arguments that the qpo frequency values inthis qpo frequency-gamma correlation should be inversely proportional tom_{bh}. a simple translation of the correlation for a given source along thefrequency axis leads to the observed correlation for another source. as aresult of this translation one can obtain a scaling factor which is simply a bhmass ratio for these particular sources. this property of the correlationsoffers a fundamentally new method for bh mass determination in xrbs. here weuse the observed qpo-index correlations observed in three bh sources: groj1655-40, grs 1915+105 and cyg x-1. the bh mass of (6.3 +/- 0.5) m_sun in groj1655-40 is obtained using optical observations. rxte observations during therecent 2005 outburst yielded sufficient data to establish the correlationpattern during both rise and decay of the event. we use gro j1655-40 as astandard reference source to measure the bh mass in cyg x-1. we also revisitthe grs 1915+105 data as a further test of our scaling method. we infer thevalue of bh mass of (15.6 +/- 1.5) m_sun in this source which is consistentwith the previous bh mass estimate in grs 1915 of (13.3 +/- 4) m_sun. we obtainthe bh mass in cyg x-1 in the range (8.7 +/- 0.8) m_sun.

astro-ph;9708255	the extended power law as intrinsic signature for a black hole	we analyze the exact general relativistic exact integro-differential equationof radiative transfer describing the interaction of low energy photons with amaxwellian distribution of hot electrons in gravitational field of aschwarzschild black hole. we prove that due to comptonization an initialarbitrary spectrum of low energy photons unavoidably results in spectracharacterized by an extended power-law feature. we examine the spectral indexby using both analytical and numerical methods for a variety of physicalparameters as such the plasma temperature and the mass accretion rate. thepresence of the event horizon as well as the behaviour of the null geodesics inits vicinity largely determine the dependence of the spectral index on the flowparameters. we come to the conclusion that the bulk motion of a converging flowis more efficient in upscattering photons than thermal comptonization providedthat the electron temperature in the flow is of order of a few kev or less. inthis case, the spectrum observed at infinity consists of a soft componentproduced by those input photons that escape after a few scatterings without anysignificant energy change and of hard component (described by a power law)produced by the photons that underwent significant upscattering. the luminosityof the power-law component is relatively small compared to that of the softcomponent. for accretion into black hole the spectral energy index of thepower-law is always higher than one for plasma temperature of order of a fewkev. this result suggests that the bulk motion comptonization might beresponsible for the power-law spectra seen in the black-hole x-ray sources.

astro-ph;9907360	kilohertz qpos in neutron star binaries modeled as keplerian  oscillations in a rotating frame of reference	since the discovery of khz quasi-periodic oscillations (qpo) in neutron starbinaries, the difference between peak frequencies of two modes in the upperpart of the spectrum, i.e. delta (omega)=omega_h-omega_k has been studiedextensively. the idea that the difference delta(omega) is constant and (as abeat frequency) is related to the rotational frequency of the neutron star hasbeen tested previously. the observed decrease of delta(omega) when omega_h andomega_k increase has weakened the beat frequency interpretation. we put forwarda different paradigm: a keplerian oscillator under the influence of thecoriolis force. for such an oscillator, omega_h and the assumed keplerianfrequency omega_k hold an upper hybrid frequency relation:omega^2_h-omega^2_k=4*omega^2, where omega is the rotational frequency of thestar's magnetosphere near the equatorial plane. for three sources (sco x-1, 4u1608-52 and 4u 1702-429), we demonstrate that the solid body rotationomega=omega_0=const. is a good first order approximation. within the secondorder approximation, the slow variation of omega as a function of omega_kreveals the structure of the magnetospheric differential rotation. for sco x-1,the qpo have frequencies approximately 45 and 90 hz which we interpret as the1st and 2nd harmonics of the lower branch of the keplerian oscillations for therotator with vector omega not aligned with the normal of the disk: omega_l/2pi=(omega/pi)(omega_k/omega_h)sin(delta) where delta is the angle betweenvector omega and the vector normal to the disk.

astro-ph;9907362	interpretation of 35 hz qpo in the atoll source 4u 1702-42 as a low  branch of the keplerian oscillations under the influence of the coriolis  force	the recent model of quasi-periodic oscillations in neutron star binaries(osherovich and titarchuk 1999, titarchuk and osherovich 1999) has suggestedthe existence of two branches of qpos due to the influence of coriolis force onthe linear keplerian oscillator: one branch with frequencies from 400 to 1200hz and another branch with frequencies an order of magnitude lower. thefrequencies of the high branch nu_h hold a hybrid frequency relation with thekeplerian frequency nu_k: nu_h^2=nu_k^2+ [omega/pi]^2, where omega is therotational frequency of the star's magnetosphere. the frequency of the lowbranch is nu_l=(omega/pi)(nu_k/nu_h) sin(delta), where delta is a small anglebetween vector omega and the vector normal to the plane of keplerianoscillations. the observations of the source 4u 1702-42 (markwardt et al 1999)have shown that the centroid of the 35 hz qpo tracks the frequency of thekilohertz oscillations. we interpret the 35 hz oscillations as nu_l and finddelta=3.9^o +/- 0.2^o. our results make 4u 1702-42 the second source (after scox-1) for which the theoretically derived lower branch is identified (within ourmodel) and delta is calculated. the inferred angle delta stays approximatelythe same over the significant range of nu_k (650 - 900 hz), as expected fromthe model. based on our model we present a classification of qpo frequencies inthe source 4u 1702-42 observed above and below nu_l.

astro-ph;9909277	timing spectroscopy of quasi-periodic oscillations in the low-mass x-ray  neutron star binaries	precise simultaneous measurements of the frequencies of the two kilohertzquasi-periodic oscillations (referred in the literature as upper and lower khzqpos) cast doubts on the validity of the simple beat-frequency interpretationand some of the modifications introduced to explain the results of the varyingfrequency difference. a new model explains the variation of the frequencydifference suggesting that the upper khz qpo,namely nu_h is an upper hybridfrequency of the keplerian oscillator under the influence of the coriolis forceand the lower khz qpo is the keplerian frequency nu_k. such an oscillator hastwo branches characterized by high frequency nu_h (around 1 khz) and by lowfrequency nu_l (around 50 hz). the frequency nu_l depends strongly on theangle, delta between the normal to the neutron star disk and omega - theangular velocity of the magnetosphere surrounding the neutron star. in thelower part of the qpo spectrum (around 10 hz), this model identifies thefrequency of radial viscous oscillations nu_v (previously called "extra noisecomponent") and the break frequency nu_b, which is associated with thediffusive process in the transition region (the innermost part of the disk).according to this model, all frequencies (namely nu_h, nu_l, nu_b and nu_v)have specific dependences on nu_k. this paper focuses on the verification ofthe predicted relations. for the source 4u 1728-34, the best theoretical fit isobtained for delta=8.3+/-1.0^o, which is slightly larger than delta=5.5+/-0.5^o previously found for sco x-1. in addition, we show that the theoreticallyderived power law relation, nu_b proportional to nu_v^{1.61} is consistent withthe recent observations of other atoll and z-sources.
