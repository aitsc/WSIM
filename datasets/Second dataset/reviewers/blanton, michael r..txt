0903.3971	astronomical software wants to be free: a manifesto	astronomical software is now a fact of daily life for all hands-on members ofour community. purpose-built software for data reduction and modeling tasksbecomes ever more critical as we handle larger amounts of data and simulations.however, the writing of astronomical software is unglamorous, the rewards arenot always clear, and there are structural disincentives to releasing softwarepublicly and to embedding it in the scientific literature, which can lead tosignificant duplication of effort and an incomplete scientific record. weidentify some of these structural disincentives and suggest a variety ofapproaches to address them, with the goals of raising the quality ofastronomical software, improving the lot of scientist-authors, and providingbenefits to the entire community, analogous to the benefits provided by openaccess to large survey and simulation datasets. our aim is to open aconversation on how to move forward. we advocate that: (1) the astronomicalcommunity consider software as an integral and fundable part of facilityconstruction and science programs; (2) that software release be considered asintegral to the open and reproducible scientific process as are publication anddata release; (3) that we adopt technologies and repositories for releasing andcollaboration on software that have worked for open-source software; (4) thatwe seek structural incentives to make the release of software and relatedpublications easier for scientist-authors; (5) that we consider new ways offunding the development of grass-roots software; (6) and that we rethink ourvalues to acknowledge that astronomical software development is not just atechnical endeavor, but a fundamental part of our scientific practice.

0908.2598	the baryonic acoustic feature and large-scale clustering in the sdss lrg  sample	we examine the correlation function \xi of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) luminous red galaxy sample (lrg) at large scales (60&lt;s&lt;400 mpc/h) usingthe final data release (dr7; 105,831 lrgs between 0.16&lt;z&lt;0.47). using mockcatalogs, we demonstrate that the observed baryonic acoustic peak and largerscale signal are consistent with lcdm at the 1.5\sigma level. the signal at155&lt;s&lt;200 mpc/h tends to be high relative to theoretical expectations; thisslight deviation can be attributed to a bright subsample of the lrgs. fittingdata to a non-linear, redshift-space, template based-model, we constrain thepeak position at s_p=103.6+3.6-2.4 mpc/h when fitting the range 60&lt;s&lt;150 mpc/h(1\sigma uncertainties measured from the mocks. this redshift-space distances_p is related to the comoving sound horizon scale r_s after taking intoaccount matter clustering non-linearities, redshift distortions and galaxyclustering bias. mock catalogs show that the probability that a dr7-sizedsample would not have an identifiable peak is at least 10%. as a consistencycheck of a fiducial cosmology, we use the observed s_p to obtain the distanced_v=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3) relative to the acoustic scale. we findr_s/d_v(z=0.278)=0.1394+-0.0049. this result is in excellent agreement withpercival et. al (2009), who examine roughly the same data set, but using thepower spectrum. comparison with other determinations in the literature are alsoin very good agreement. we have tested our results against a battery ofpossible systematic effects, finding all effects are smaller than our estimatedsample variance.

0912.0201	lsst science book, version 2.0	a survey that can cover the sky in optical bands over wide fields to faintmagnitudes with a fast cadence will enable many of the exciting scienceopportunities of the next decade. the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst)will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with fieldof view of 9.6 deg^2, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over20,000 deg^2 south of +15 deg. each pointing will be imaged 2000 times withfifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to atotal point-source depth of r~27.5. the lsst science book describes the basicparameters of the lsst hardware, software, and observing plans. the bookdiscusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe abroad range of science that lsst will revolutionize: mapping the inner andouter solar system, stellar populations in the milky way and nearby galaxies,the structure of the milky way disk and halo and other objects in the localvolume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and theproperties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. it thenturns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae toz~1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies andbaryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined toconstrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.

0912.1610	the galex arecibo sdss survey. i. gas fraction scaling relations of  massive galaxies and first data release	we introduce the galex arecibo sdss survey (gass), an on-going large programthat is gathering high quality hi-line spectra using the arecibo radiotelescope for an unbiased sample of ~1000 galaxies with stellar masses greaterthan 10^10 msun and redshifts 0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05, selected from the sdssspectroscopic and galex imaging surveys. the galaxies are observed untildetected or until a low gas mass fraction limit (1.5-5%) is reached. this paperpresents the first data release, consisting of ~20% of the final gass sample.we use this data set to explore the main scaling relations of hi gas fractionwith galaxy structure and nuv-r colour. a large fraction (~60%) of the galaxiesin our sample are detected in hi. we find that the atomic gas fractiondecreases strongly with stellar mass, stellar surface mass density and nuv-rcolour, but is only weakly correlated with galaxy bulge-to-disk ratio (asmeasured by the concentration index of the r-band light). we also find that thefraction of galaxies with significant (more than a few percent) hi decreasessharply above a characteristic stellar surface mass density of 10^8.5 msunkpc^-2. the fraction of gas-rich galaxies decreases much more smoothly withstellar mass. one of the key goals of gass is to identify and quantify theincidence of galaxies that are transitioning between the blue, star-formingcloud and the red sequence of passively-evolving galaxies. likely transitioncandidates can be identified as outliers from the mean scaling relationsbetween gas fraction and other galaxy properties.

0707.3813	testing cold dark matter with the low mass tully-fisher relation	the galaxy circular velocity function at small masses is related to thematter power spectrum on small scales. although this function is well-studiedfor local group dwarfs, theoretical predictions and observational measurementsare difficult for satellite galaxies, because of ram pressure and tidalstripping. by contrast, isolated dwarf galaxies are less affected by theseprocesses, and almost always have enough 21cm emission to trace their dynamicsrobustly. here, we test cold dark matter cosmology using isolated low massdwarf galaxies from the sdss with measured 21cm widths. we find consistencybetween the predicted and observed number density of isolated galaxies down tocircular velocities of 50 km/s. our technique yields a direct test ofsmall-scale cosmology independent of the lyman-alpha forest power spectrum, butour sample is currently statistically less powerful: warm dark matter particlesheavier than 0.5 kev cannot be ruled out. our major systematic uncertainty isthe surface brightness limit of the sdss. blind hi surveys, such as the alfalfasurvey on arecibo, will uncover a larger number of isolated low mass galaxiesand increase the power of our constraints. with our sample, we also find thatthe tully-fisher relation for dwarf galaxies is a strong function ofenvironment, and that the baryonic fraction is only a weak function of mass.these results suggest that for dwarf galaxies, gas loss is dominated byexternal, not internal, processes.

1003.2202	dust attenuation in disk-dominated galaxies: evidence for the 2175a dust  feature	the attenuation of starlight by interstellar dust is investigated in a sampleof low redshift, disk-dominated star-forming galaxies using photometry fromgalex and sdss. by considering broadband colors as a function of galaxyinclination we are able to confidently separate trends arising from increasingdust opacity from possible differences in stellar populations, since stellarpopulations do not correlate with inclination. all commonly employed dustattenuation curves (such as the calzetti curve for starbursts, or a power-lawcurve) provide poor fits to the ultraviolet colors for moderately and highlyinclined galaxies. this conclusion rests on the fact that the average fuv-nuvcolor varies little from face-on to edge-on galaxies, while other colors suchas nuv-u and u-r vary strongly with inclination. after considering a number ofmodel variations, we are led to speculate that the presence of the strong dustextinction feature at 2175a seen in the milky way (mw) extinction curve isresponsible for the observed trends. independent of our interpretation, theseresults imply that the modeling of dust attenuation in the ultraviolet issignificantly more complicated than traditionally assumed. these results alsoimply a very weak dependence of the fuv-nuv color on total fuv attenuation, andwe conclude from this that it is extremely difficult to use only the observeduv spectral slope to infer the total uv dust attenuation, as is commonly done.we propose several simple tests that might finally identify the grainpopulation responsible for the 2175a feature.

1004.1167	the sloan digital sky survey quasar catalog v. seventh data release	we present the fifth edition of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) quasarcatalog, which is based upon the sdss seventh data release. the catalog, whichcontains 105,783 spectroscopically confirmed quasars, represents the conclusionof the sdss-i and sdss-ii quasar survey. the catalog consists of the sdssobjects that have luminosities larger than m_i = -22.0 (in a cosmology with h_0= 70 km/s/mpc omega_m = 0.3, and omega_lambda = 0.7) have at least one emissionline with fwhm larger than 1000 km/s or have interesting/complex absorptionfeatures, are fainter than i &gt; 15.0 and have highly reliable redshifts. thecatalog covers an area of 9380 deg^2. the quasar redshifts range from 0.065 to5.46, with a median value of 1.49; the catalog includes 1248 quasars atredshifts greater than four, of which 56 are at redshifts greater than five.the catalog contains 9210 quasars with i &lt; 18; slightly over half of theentries have i&lt; 19. for each object the catalog presents positions accurate tobetter than 0.1" rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz) ccd-based photometrywith typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the morphology andselection method. the catalog also contains radio, near-infrared, and x-rayemission properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-areasurveys. the calibrated digital spectra cover the wavelength region 3800-9200ang. at a spectral resolution r = 2000 the spectra can be retrieved from thesdss public database using the information provided in the catalog. over 96% ofthe objects in the catalog were discovered by the sdss. we also include asupplemental list of an additional 207 quasars with sdss spectra whose archivephotometric information is incomplete.

1004.2244	regarding the line-of-sight baryonic acoustic feature in the sloan  digital sky survey and baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey luminous red  galaxy samples	we analyze the line-of-sight baryonic acoustic feature in the two-pointcorrelation function {\xi} of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) luminous redgalaxy (lrg) sample (0.16 &lt; z &lt; 0.47). by defining a narrow line-of-sightregion, rp &lt; 5.5 mpc/h, where rp is the transverse separation component, wemeasure a strong excess of clustering at ~ 110 mpc/h, as previously reported inthe literature. we also test these results in an alternative coordinate system,by defining the line-of-sight as {\theta} &lt; 3{\deg}, where {\theta} is theopening angle. this clustering excess appears much stronger than the feature inthe better-measured monopole. a fiducial {\lambda}cdm non-linear model inredshift-space predicts a much weaker signature. we use realistic mock catalogsto model the expected signal and noise. we find that the line-of-sightmeasurements can be explained well by our mocks as well as by a featureless{\xi} = 0. we conclude that there is no convincing evidence that the strongclustering measurement is the line-of-sight baryonic acoustic feature. we alsoevaluate how detectable such a signal would be in the upcoming baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey lrg volume (boss). mock lrg catalogs (z &lt; 0.6)suggest that: (i) the narrow line- of-sight cylinder and cone defined aboveprobably will not reveal a detectable acoustic feature in boss; (ii) aclustering measurement as high as that in the current sample can be ruled out(or confirmed) at a high confidence level using a boss-sized data set; and(iii) an analysis with wider angular cuts, which provide better signal-to-noiseratios, can nevertheless be used to compare line-of-sight and transversedistances, and thereby constrain the expansion rate h(z) and diameter distanceda(z).

1005.2413	galaxy clustering in the completed sdss redshift survey: the dependence  on color and luminosity	we measure the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering in thesdss dr7 main galaxy sample, focusing on the projected correlation functionw_p(r_p) of volume-limited samples. we interpret our measurements using halooccupation distribution (hod) modeling assuming a lambda-cdm cosmology. theamplitude of w_p(r_p) grows slowly with luminosity for l &lt; l_* and increasessharply at higher luminosities, with bias factor b(&gt;l)=1.06+0.23(l/l_*)^{1.12}.at fixed luminosity, redder galaxies have a stronger and steeper w_p(r_p), atrend that runs steadily from the bluest galaxies to the reddest galaxies. theindividual luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations arestrikingly different. blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of w_p(r_p)with luminosity, at all scales. the large-scale clustering of red galaxiesshows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at l &gt; 4l_*, but thelowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 l_*) show very strong clustering onscales r_p &lt; 2 mpc/h. most of the observed trends can be naturally understoodwithin the lcdm+hod framework. the growth of w_p(r_p) with luminosity reflectsan overall shift in the halo mass scale, in particular an increase in theminimum host halo mass mmin. the mass at which a halo has, on average, onesatellite galaxy brighter than l is m_1 ~ 17 mmin(l) over most of theluminosity range. the growth and steepening of w_p(r_p) for redder galaxiesreflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in highmass halos instead of central systems in low mass halos, a trend that isespecially marked at low luminosities. our extensive measurements, provided intabular form, will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxyformation, a firm grounding of semi-empirical models of the galaxy population,and new cosmological tests.

1006.5055	stellar populations of elliptical galaxies in the local universe	we study the stellar populations of 1,923 elliptical galaxies at z&lt;0.05selected from the sloan digital sky survey as a function of velocitydispersion, sigma, and environment. we construct average, high signal-to-noisespectra and find the following: (1) lower-sigma galaxies have a bluer opticalcontinuum and stronger (but still weak) emission lines; (2) at fixed sigma,field ellipticals have a slightly bluer stellar continuum, especially atwavelengths \lesssim 4000 \aa, and have stronger (but still weak) emissionlines compared to their group counterparts, although this environmentaldependence is strongest for low-sigma ellipticals. based on lick indicesmeasured from both the individual and average spectra, we find that: (1) at agiven sigma, elliptical galaxies in groups have systematically weaker balmerabsorption than their field counterparts, although this environmentaldependence is most pronounced at low sigma; (2) there is no clear environmentaldependence of &lt;fe&gt;, while the alpha-element absorption indices such as mgb areonly slightly stronger in galaxies belonging to rich groups. an analysis basedon simple stellar populations (ssps) reveals that more massive ellipticalgalaxies are older, more metal-rich and more strongly alpha-enhanced. we alsofind that: (1) the ssp-equivalent ages of galaxies in rich groups are, onaverage, ~1 gyr older than in the field, although once again this effect isstrongest at low sigma; (2) galaxies in rich groups have slightly lower [fe/h]and are marginally more strongly alpha-enhanced; and (3) there is nosignificant environmental dependence of total metallicity, [z/h]. our resultsare generally consistent with stronger low-level recent star formation in fieldellipticals at low sigma, similar to recent results based on ultraviolet andinfrared observations.

1006.5447	the galex arecibo sdss survey ii: the star formation efficiency of  massive galaxies	we use measurements of the hi content, stellar mass and star formation ratesin ~190 massive galaxies with stellar masses greater than 10^10 msun, obtainedfrom the galex arecibo sdss survey (gass) described in paper i (catinella etal. 2010) to explore the global scaling relations associated with thebin-averaged ratio of the star formation rate over the hi mass, which we callthe hi-based star formation efficiency (sfe). unlike the mean specific starformation rate, which decreases with stellar mass and stellar mass surfacedensity, the star formation efficiency remains relatively constant across thesample with a value close to sfe = 10^-9.5 yr^-1 (or an equivalent gasconsumption timescale of ~3 gyr). specifically, we find little variation in sfewith stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, nuv-r color and concentration.we interpret these results as an indication that external processes or feedbackmechanisms that control the gas supply are important for regulating starformation in massive galaxies. an investigation into the detailed distributionof sfes reveals that approximately 5% of the sample shows high efficiencieswith sfe &gt; 10^-9 yr^-1, and we suggest that this is very likely due to adeficiency of cold gas rather than an excess star formation rate. conversely,we also find a similar fraction of galaxies that appear to be gas-rich fortheir given specific star-formation rate, although these galaxies show both ahigher than average gas fraction and lower than average specific star formationrate. both of these populations are plausible candidates for "transition"galaxies, showing potential for a change (either decrease or increase) in theirspecific star formation rate in the near future. we also find that 36+/-5% ofthe total hi mass density and 47+/-5% of the total sfr density is found ingalaxies with stellar mass greater than 10^10 msun.

0708.3240	the growth of luminous red galaxies by merging	we study the role of major and minor mergers in the mass growth of luminousred galaxies. we present small-scale ($0.01&lt;r&lt;8\,\hmpc$) projectedcross-correlation functions of $23043$ luminous early-type galaxies from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) luminous red galaxy (lrg) sample($0.16&lt;z&lt;0.30$, $\mmi\approx -22.75\,\mag$) with all their companions in thesdss imaging sample, split into color and luminosity subsamples with$\mmi&lt;-18\,\mag$. we de-project the two-dimensional functions to obtainthree-dimensional real-space lrg--galaxy cross-correlation functions for eachcompanion subsample. we find that the cross-correlation functions are notpurely power-law and that there is a clear ``one-halo'' to ``two-halo''transition near $1\,\hmpc$. we convert these results into close pair statisticsand estimate the lrg accretion rate from each companion galaxy subsample usingtimescales from dynamical friction arguments for each subsample of thecompanions. we find that the accretion onto lrgs is dominated by dry mergers ofgalaxies more luminous than $\lstar$. we integrate the luminosity accretionrate from mergers over all companion galaxy subsamples and find that lrgs aregrowing by $[1.7\pm 0.1]$ percent per $\gyr$, on average, from merger activityat redshift $z\sim 0.25$. this rate is almost certainly an over-estimatebecause we have assumed that all close pairs are merging as quickly asdynamical friction allows; nonetheless it is on the low side of the panoply ofmeasurements in the literature, and lower than any rate predicted from theory.

1012.1324	primus: enhanced specific star formation rates in close galaxy pairs	tidal interactions between galaxies can trigger star formation, whichcontributes to the global star formation rate density of the universe and couldbe a factor in the transformation of blue, star-forming galaxies to red,quiescent galaxies over cosmic time. we investigate tidally-triggered starformation in isolated close galaxy pairs drawn from the prism multi-objectsurvey (primus), a low-dispersion prism redshift survey that has measured~120,000 robust galaxy redshifts over 9.1 deg^2 out to z ~ 1. we select asample of galaxies in isolated galaxy pairs at redshifts 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.75, withno other objects within a projected separation of 300 h^-1 kpc and dz/(1+z) =0.01, and compare them to a control sample of isolated galaxies to test forsystematic differences in their rest-frame fuv-r and nuv-r colors as a proxyfor relative specific sfr. we find that galaxies in r_p &lt; 50 h^-1 kpc pairshave bluer dust-corrected uv-r colors on average than the control galaxies by-0.134 +/- 0.045 magnitudes in fuv-r and -0.075 +/- 0.038 magnitudes in nuv-r,corresponding to a ~15-20% increase in ssfr. this indicates an enhancement inssfr due to tidal interactions. we also find that this relative enhancement isgreater for a subset of r_p &lt; 30 h^-1 kpc pair galaxies, for which the averagecolors offsets are -0.193 +/- 0.065 magnitudes in fuv-r and -0.159 +/- 0.048magnitudes in nuv-r, corresponding to a ~25-30% increase in ssfr. we test forevolution in the enhancement of tidally-triggered star formation with redshiftacross our sample redshift range and find marginal evidence for a decrease inssfr enhancement from 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.5 to 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.75. this indicates that achange in enhanced star formation triggered by tidal interactions in lowdensity environments is not a contributor to the decline in the global starformation rate density across this redshift range.

1105.0606	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: quasar target  selection for data release nine	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), a five-yearspectroscopic survey of 10,000 deg^2, achieved first light in late 2009. one ofthe key goals of boss is to measure the signature of baryon acousticoscillations in the distribution of ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of asample of ~150,000 z&gt;2.2 quasars. along with measuring the angular diameterdistance at z\approx2.5, boss will provide the first direct measurement of theexpansion rate of the universe at z &gt; 2. one of the biggest challenges inachieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. during the first yearof the boss survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and testedto meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in thisredshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. to achieve these surface densities,the magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g &lt;= 22.0 or r&lt;=21.85.while detection of the bao signature in the ly-alpha absorption in quasarspectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysicalstudies do. we therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targetsdeg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%. this "core"subsample will be fixed for years two through five of the survey. in this paperwe describe the evolution and implementation of the boss quasar targetselection algorithms during the first two years of boss operations. we analyzethe spectra obtained during the first year. 11,263 new z&gt;2.2 quasars werespectroscopically confirmed by boss. our current algorithms select an averageof 15 z &gt; 2.2 quasars deg^-2 from 40 targets deg^-2 using single-epoch sdssimaging. multi-epoch optical data and data at other wavelengths can furtherimprove the efficiency and completeness of boss quasar target selection.[abridged]

1105.1960	improved background subtraction for the sloan digital sky survey images	we describe a procedure for background subtracting sloan digital sky survey(sdss) imaging that improves the resulting detection and photometry of largegalaxies on the sky. within each sdss drift scan run, we mask out detectedsources and then fit a smooth function to the variation of the sky background.this procedure has been applied to all sdss-iii data release 8 images, and theresults are available as part of that data set. we have tested the effect ofour background subtraction on the photometry of large galaxies by insertingfake galaxies into the raw pixels, reanalyzing the data, and measuring themafter background subtraction. our technique results in no size-dependent biasin galaxy fluxes up to half-light radii of 100 arcsec; in contrast, forgalaxies of that size the standard sdss photometric catalog underestimatesfluxes by about 1.5 mag. our results represent a substantial improvement overthe standard sdss catalog results and should form the basis of any analysis ofnearby galaxies using the sdss imaging data.

1105.2037	improving measurements of h(z) and da(z) by analyzing clustering  anisotropies	the baryonic acoustic feature in galaxy clustering is a promising tool forconstraining the nature of the cosmic acceleration, through measurements ofexpansion rates h and angular diameter distances d_a. angle-averagedmeasurements of clustering yield constraints on the quantity d_a^2/h. however,to break the degeneracy between these two parameters one must measure theanisotropic correlation function as a function of both line-of-sight (radial)and transverse separations. here we investigate how to most effectively do so,using analytic techniques and mock catalogues. in particular, we examinemultipole expansions of the correlation function as well as "clustering wedges"xi(delta mu, s), where mu = s_||/s and s_|| is the radial component ofseparation s. both techniques allow strong constraints on h and d_a, asexpected. the radial wedges strongly depend on h and the transverse wedges aresensitive to d_a. analyses around the region of the acoustic peak constrain h~20% better when using the wedge statistics than when using themonopole-quadrupole combination. however, we show that the hexadecapole allowssubstantially stronger constraints than the monopole and quadrupole alone. ourfindings here demonstrate that wedge statistics provide a practical alternativetechnique to multipoles, that should be useful to test systematics and willprovide comparable or better constraints. finally, we predict the constraintsfrom galaxy clustering that will be possible with a completed version of theongoing baryonic oscillation spectroscopic survey.

1107.4368	primus: the dependence of agn accretion on host stellar mass and color	we present evidence that the incidence of active galactic nuclei (agns) andthe distribution of their accretion rates do not depend on the stellar massesof their host galaxies, contrary to previous studies. we use hard (2-10 kev)x-ray data from three extragalactic fields (xmm-lss, cosmos and elais-s1) withredshifts from the prism multi-object survey to identify 242 agns with l_{2-10kev}=10^{42-44} erg /s within a parent sample of ~25,000 galaxies at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.0over ~3.4 deg^2 and to i~23. we find that although the fraction of galaxieshosting an agn at fixed x-ray luminosity rises strongly with stellar mass, thedistribution of x-ray luminosities is independent of mass. furthermore, we showthat the probability that a galaxy will host an agn can be defined by auniversal eddington ratio distribution that is independent of the host galaxystellar mass and has a power-law shape with slope -0.65. these resultsdemonstrate that agns are prevalent at all stellar masses in the range 9.5&lt;logm_*/m_sun&lt;12 and that the same physical processes regulate agn activity in allgalaxies in this stellar mass range. while a higher agn fraction may beobserved in massive galaxies, this is a selection effect related to theunderlying eddington ratio distribution. we also find that the agn fractiondrops rapidly between z~1 and the present day and is moderately enhanced(factor~2) in galaxies with blue or green optical colors. consequently, whileagn activity and star formation appear to be globally correlated, we do notfind evidence that the presence of an agn is related to the quenching of starformation or the color transformation of galaxies.

1108.3348	optical properties of host galaxies of extragalactic nuclear water  masers	we study the optical properties of the host galaxies of nuclear 22 ghz(lambda=1.35 cm) water masers. to do so, we cross-match the galaxy samplesurveyed for water maser emission (123 detections and 3806 non-detections) withthe sdss low-redshift galaxy sample (z&lt;0.05). out of 1636 galaxies with sdssphotometry, we identify 48 detections; out of the 1063 galaxies that also havesdss spectroscopy, we identify 33 detections. we find that maser detection rateis higher at higher optical luminosity (m_b), larger velocity dispersion($\sigma$), and higher [oiii]5007 luminosity, with [oiii]5007 being thedominant factor. these detection rates are essentially the result of thecorrelations of isotropic maser luminosity with all three of these variables.these correlations are natural if maser strength increases with central blackhole mass and the level of agn activity. we also find that the detection rateis higher in galaxies with higher extinction. based on these results, wepropose that maser surveys seeking to efficiently find masers should rank agntargets by extinction-corrected [oiii]5007 flux when available. thisprioritization would improve maser detection efficiency, from an overall ~ 3%without pre-selection to ~ 16% for the strongest intrinsic [oiii]5007 emitters,by a factor of ~ 5.

1109.1280	the nature of liner-like emission in red galaxies	passive red galaxies frequently contain warm ionized gas and have spectrasimilar to low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (liners). here weinvestigate the nature of the ionizing sources powering this emission, bycomparing nuclear spectroscopy from the palomar survey with larger aperturedata from the sloan digital sky survey. we find the line emission in themajority of passive red galaxies is spatially extended; the halpha surfacebrightness profile depends on radius (r) as r^(-1.28). we detect strong lineratio gradients with radius in [n ii]/ha, [s ii]/ha, and [o iii]/[s ii],requiring the ionization parameter to increase outwards. combined with arealistic gas density profile, this outward increasing ionization parameterconvincingly rules out agn as the dominant ionizing source, and strongly favorsdistributed ionizing sources. sources that follow the stellar density profilecan additionally reproduce the observed luminosity-dependence of the line ratiogradient. post-agb stars provide a natural ionization source candidate, thoughthey have an ionization parameter deficit. velocity width differences amongdifferent emission lines disfavor shocks as the dominant ionization mechanism,and suggest that the interstellar medium in these galaxies contains multiplecomponents. we conclude that the line emission in most liner-like galaxiesfound in large aperture (&gt;100pc) spectroscopy is not primarily powered by agnactivity and thus does not trace the agn bolometric luminosity. however, theycan be used to trace warm gas in these red galaxies.

1208.0022	the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey of sdss-iii	the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) is designed to measure thescale of baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) in the clustering of matter over alarger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveysof large scale structure. boss uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint asi=19.9 over 10,000 square degrees to measure bao to redshifts z&lt;0.7.observations of neutral hydrogen in the lyman alpha forest in more than 150,000quasar spectra (g&lt;22) will constrain bao over the redshift range 2.15&lt;z&lt;3.5.early results from boss include the first detection of the large-scalethree-dimensional clustering of the lyman alpha forest and a strong detectionfrom the data release 9 data set of the bao in the clustering of massivegalaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. we project that boss will yieldmeasurements of the angular diameter distance d_a to an accuracy of 1.0% atredshifts z=0.3 and z=0.57 and measurements of h(z) to 1.8% and 1.7% at thesame redshifts. forecasts for lyman alpha forest constraints predict ameasurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerated_a(z) and h^{-1}(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9% at z~2.5 when the surveyis complete. here, we provide an overview of the selection of spectroscopictargets, planning of observations, and analysis of data and data quality ofboss.

1301.1688	primus: constraints on star formation quenching and galaxy merging, and  the evolution of the stellar mass function from z=0-1	we measure the evolution of the stellar mass function (smf) from z=0-1 usingmulti-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic redshifts from the prismmulti-object survey (primus) and the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). fromprimus we construct an i&lt;23 flux-limited sample of ~40,000 galaxies atz=0.2-1.0 over five fields totaling ~5.5 deg^2, and from the sdss we select~170,000 galaxies at z=0.01-0.2 that we analyze consistently with respect toprimus to minimize systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements. we findthat the smf of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z=1, although wedo find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a ~30% increase inthe number density of ~10^10 msun galaxies since z~0.6, and a &lt;10% change inthe number density of all &gt;10^11 msun galaxies since z~1. dividing the sampleinto star-forming and quiescent using an evolving cut in specificstar-formation rate, we find that the number density of ~10^10 msunstar-forming galaxies stays relatively constant since z~0.6, whereas thespace-density of &gt;10^11 msun star-forming galaxies decreases by ~50% betweenz~1 and z~0. meanwhile, the number density of ~10^10 msun quiescent galaxiesincreases steeply towards low redshift, by a factor of ~2-3 since z~0.6, whilethe number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant sincez~1. these results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies arequenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of thestellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around ~10^10.8msun. in addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominantchannel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z&lt;1, even among massive(&gt;10^11 msun) quiescent galaxies.

1301.1689	primus: an observationally motivated model to connect the evolution of  the agn and galaxy populations out to z~1	we present an observationally motivated model to connect the agn and galaxypopulations at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.0 and predict the agn x-ray luminosity function (xlf).we start with measurements of the stellar mass function of galaxies (from theprism multi-object survey) and populate galaxies with agns using models for theprobability of a galaxy hosting an agn as a function of specific accretionrate. our model is based on measurements indicating that the specific accretionrate distribution is a universal function across a wide range of host stellarmass with slope gamma_1 = -0.65 and an overall normalization that evolves withredshift. we test several simple assumptions to extend this model to highspecific accretion rates (beyond the measurements) and compare the predictionsfor the xlf with the observed data. we find good agreement with a model thatallows for a break in the specific accretion rate distribution at a pointcorresponding to the eddington limit, a steep power-law tail to super-eddingtonratios with slope gamma_2 = -2.1 +0.3 -0.5, and a scatter of 0.38 dex in thescaling between black hole and host stellar mass. our results show that samplesof low luminosity agns are dominated by moderately massive galaxies (m* ~10^{10-11} m_sun) growing with a wide range of accretion rates due to the shapeof the galaxy stellar mass function rather than a preference for agn activityat a particular stellar mass. luminous agns may be a severely skewed populationwith elevated black hole masses relative to their host galaxies and in rarephases of rapid accretion.

0801.3286	the intrinsic properties of sdss galaxies	the observed properties of galaxies vary with inclination; for mostapplications we would rather have properties that are independent ofinclination, intrinsic properties. one way to determine inclination correctionsis to consider a large sample of galaxies, study how the observed properties ofthese galaxies depend on inclination and then remove this dependence to recoverthe intrinsic properties. we perform such an analysis for galaxies selectedfrom the sloan digital sky survey which have been matched to galaxies from thetwo-micron all sky survey. we determine inclination corrections for thesegalaxies as a function of galaxy luminosity and sersic index. in the g-bandthese corrections reach as as high as 1.2 mag and have a median value of 0.3mag for all galaxies in our sample. we find that the corrections show littledependence on galaxy luminosity, except in the $u$ band, but are stronglydependent on galaxy sersic index.  we find that the ratio of red-to-blue galaxies changes from 1:1 to 1:2 whengoing from observed to intrinsic colors for galaxies in the range -22.75 &lt; m_k&lt; -17.75. we also discuss how survey completeness and photometric redshiftsshould be determined when taking into account that observed and intrinsicproperties differ. finally, we examine whether previous determinations ofstellar mass give an intrinsic quantity or one that depends on galaxyinclination.

1310.1093	primus: galaxy clustering as a function of luminosity and color at  0.2&lt;z&lt;1	we present measurements of the luminosity and color-dependence of galaxyclustering at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.0 in the prism multi-object survey (primus). we quantifythe clustering with the redshift-space and projected two-point correlationfunctions, xi(rp,pi) and wp(rp), using volume-limited samples constructed froma parent sample of over 130,000 galaxies with robust redshifts in sevenindependent fields covering 9 sq. deg. of sky. we quantify how thescale-dependent clustering amplitude increases with increasing luminosity andredder color, with relatively small errors over large volumes. we find that redgalaxies have stronger small-scale (0.1&lt;rp&lt;1 mpc/h) clustering and steepercorrelation functions compared to blue galaxies, as well as a strong colordependent clustering within the red sequence alone. we interpret our measuredclustering trends in terms of galaxy bias and obtain values betweenb_gal=0.9-2.5, quantifying how galaxies are biased tracers of dark matterdepending on their luminosity and color. we also interpret the color dependencewith mock catalogs, and find that the clustering of blue galaxies is nearlyconstant with color, while redder galaxies have stronger clustering in theone-halo term due to a higher satellite galaxy fraction. in addition, wemeasure the evolution of the clustering strength and bias, and we do not detectstatistically significant departures from passive evolution. we argue that theluminosity- and color-environment (or halo mass) relations of galaxies have notsignificantly evolved since z=1. finally, using jackknife subsampling methods,we find that sampling fluctuations are important and that the cosmos field isgenerally an outlier, due to having more overdense structures than otherfields; we find that 'cosmic variance' can be a significant source ofuncertainty for high-redshift clustering measurements.

1312.1249	unusual broad-line mgii emitters among luminous galaxies in boss	many classes of active galactic nuclei (agn) have been observed and recordedsince the discovery of seyfert galaxies. in this paper, we examine the sampleof luminous galaxies in the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss). wefind a potentially new observational class of agn, one with strong and broadmgii $2799$\aa\ line emission, but very weak emission in other normalindicators of agn activity, such as the broad line h$\alpha$, h$\beta$, and thenear-ultraviolet agn continuum, leading to an extreme ratio of broadh$\alpha$/mgii flux relative to normal quasars. meanwhile, these objects'narrow-line flux ratios reveal agn narrow-line regions with levels of activityconsistent with the mgii fluxes and in agreement with that of normal quasars.these agn may represent an extreme case of the baldwin effect, with very lowcontinuum and high equivalent width relative to typical quasars, but theirratio of broad mgii to broad balmer emission remains very unusual. they mayalso be representative of a class of agn where the central engine is observedindirectly with scattered light. these galaxies represent a small fraction ofthe total population of luminous galaxies ($\simeq 0.1$\%), but are more likely(about 3.5 times) to have agn-like nuclear line emission properties than otherluminous galaxiess. because mgii is usually inaccessible for the population ofnearby galaxies, there may exist a related population of broad-line mgiiemitters in the local universe which are currently classified as narrow-lineemitters (seyfert 2s) or liners.

1502.01348	primus: the effect of physical scale on the luminosity-dependence of  galaxy clustering via cross-correlations	we report small-scale clustering measurements from the primus spectroscopicredshift survey as a function of color and luminosity. we measure thereal-space cross-correlations between 62,106 primary galaxies with primusredshifts and a tracer population of 545,000 photometric galaxies overredshifts from z=0.2 to z=1. we separately fit a power-law model in redshiftand luminosity to each of three independent color-selected samples of galaxies.we report clustering amplitudes at fiducial values of z=0.5 and l=1.5 l*. theclustering of the red galaxies is ~3 times as strong as that of the bluegalaxies and ~1.5 as strong as that of the green galaxies. we also find thatthe luminosity dependence of the clustering is strongly dependent on physicalscale, with greater luminosity dependence being found between r=0.0625 mpc/hand r=0.25 mpc/h, compared to the r=0.5 mpc/h to r=2 mpc/h range. moreover,over a range of two orders of magnitude in luminosity, a single power-law fitto the luminosity dependence is not sufficient to explain the increase inclustering at both the bright and faint ends at the smaller scales. we arguethat luminosity-dependent clustering at small scales is a necessary componentof galaxy-halo occupation models for blue, star-forming galaxies as well as forred, quenched galaxies.

1503.00731	dark matter halo models of stellar mass-dependent galaxy clustering in  primus+deep2 at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.2	we utilize $\lambda$cdm halo occupation models of galaxy clustering toinvestigate the evolving stellar mass dependent clustering of galaxies in theprism multi-object survey (primus) and deep2 redshift survey over the pasteight billion years of cosmic time, between $0.2&lt;z&lt;1.2$. these clusteringmeasurements provide new constraints on the connections between dark matterhalo properties and galaxy properties in the context of the evolvinglarge-scale structure of the universe. using both an analytic model and a setof mock galaxy catalogs, we find a strong correlation between central galaxystellar mass and dark matter halo mass over the range$m_\mathrm{halo}\sim10^{11}$-$10^{13}~h^{-1}m_\odot$, approximately consistentwith previous observations and theoretical predictions. however, thestellar-to-halo mass relation (shmr) and the mass scale where star formationefficiency reaches a maximum appear to evolve more strongly than predicted byother models, including models based primarily on abundance-matchingconstraints. we find that the fraction of satellite galaxies in haloes of agiven mass decreases significantly from $z\sim0.5$ to $z\sim0.9$, partly due tothe fact that haloes at fixed mass are rarer at higher redshift and have lowerabundances. we also find that the $m_1/m_\mathrm{min}$ ratio, a model parameterthat quantifies the critical mass above which haloes host at least onesatellite, decreases from $\approx20$ at $z\sim0$ to $\approx13$ at $z\sim0.9$.considering the evolution of the subhalo mass function vis-\`{a}-vis satelliteabundances, this trend has implications for relations between satellitegalaxies and halo substructures and for intracluster mass, which we argue hasgrown due to stripped and disrupted satellites between $z\sim0.9$ and$z\sim0.5$.

1506.05013	stellar metallicity gradients in sdss galaxies	we infer stellar metallicity and abundance ratio gradients for a sample ofred galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) main galaxy sample. becausethis sample does not have multiple spectra at various radii in a single galaxy,we measure these gradients statistically. we separate galaxies into stellarmass bins, stack their spectra in redshift bins, and calculate the measuredabsorption line indices in projected annuli by differencing spectra inneighboring redshift bins. after determining the line indices, we use stellarpopulation modeling from the ez\_ages software to calculate ages,metallicities, and abundance ratios within each annulus. our data covers thecentral regions of these galaxies, out to slightly higher than $1 r_{e}$. wefind detectable gradients in metallicity and relatively shallow gradients inabundance ratios, similar to results found for direct measurements ofindividual galaxies. the gradients are only weakly dependent on stellar mass,and this dependence is well-correlated with the change of $r_e$ with mass.based on this data, we report mean equivalent widths, metallicities, andabundance ratios as a function of mass and velocity dispersion for sdssearly-type galaxies, for fixed apertures of 2.5 kpc and of 0.5 $r_e$.

1511.01496	sdss-iv/manga: spectrophotometric calibration technique	mapping nearby galaxies at apache point observatory (manga), one of threecore programs in the sloan digital sky survey-iv (sdss-iv), is anintegral-field spectroscopic (ifs) survey of roughly 10,000 nearby galaxies. itemploys dithered observations using 17 hexagonal bundles of 2 arcsec fibers toobtain resolved spectroscopy over a wide wavelength range of 3,600-10,300a. tomap the internal variations within each galaxy, we need to perform accurate{\it spectral surface photometry}, which is to calibrate the specific intensityat every spatial location sampled by each individual aperture element of theintegral field unit. the calibration must correct only for the flux loss due toatmospheric throughput and the instrument response, but not for losses due tothe finite geometry of the fiber aperture. this requires the use of standardstar measurements to strictly separate these two flux loss factors (throughputversus geometry), a difficult challenge with standard single-fiber spectroscopytechniques due to various practical limitations. therefore, we developed atechnique for spectral surface photometry using multiple small fiber-bundlestargeting standard stars simultaneously with galaxy observations. we discussthe principles of our approach and how they compare to previous efforts, and wedemonstrate the precision and accuracy achieved. manga's relative calibrationbetween the wavelengths of h$\alpha$ and h$\beta$ has a root-mean-square (rms)of 1.7%, while that between [nii] $\lambda$6583a and [oii] $\lambda$3727a hasan rms of 4.7%. using extinction-corrected star formation rates and gas-phasemetallicities as an illustration, this level of precision guarantees that fluxcalibration errors will be sub-dominant when estimating these quantities. theabsolute calibration is better than 5% for more than 89% of manga's wavelengthrange.

astro-ph;0106476	galaxy clustering in early sdss redshift data	we present the first measurements of clustering in the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) galaxy redshift survey. our sample consists of 29,300 galaxieswith redshifts 5,700 km/s &lt; cz &lt; 39,000 km/s, distributed in several long butnarrow (2.5-5 degree) segments, covering 690 square degrees. for the full,flux-limited sample, the redshift-space correlation length is approximately 8mpc/h. the two-dimensional correlation function \xi(r_p,\pi) shows clearsignatures of both the small-scale, ``fingers-of-god'' distortion caused byvelocity dispersions in collapsed objects and the large-scale compressioncaused by coherent flows, though the latter cannot be measured with highprecision in the present sample. the inferred real-space correlation functionis well described by a power law, \xi(r)=(r/6.1+/-0.2 mpc/h)^{-1.75+/-0.03},for 0.1 mpc/h &lt; r &lt; 16 mpc/h. the galaxy pairwise velocity dispersion is\sigma_{12} ~ 600+/-100 km/s for projected separations 0.15 mpc/h &lt; r_p &lt; 5mpc/h. when we divide the sample by color, the red galaxies exhibit a strongerand steeper real-space correlation function and a higher pairwise velocitydispersion than do the blue galaxies. the relative behavior of subsamplesdefined by high/low profile concentration or high/low surface brightness isqualitatively similar to that of the red/blue subsamples. our most strikingresult is a clear measurement of scale-independent luminosity bias at r &lt; 10mpc/h: subsamples with absolute magnitude ranges centered on m_*-1.5, m_*, andm_*+1.5 have real-space correlation functions that are parallel power laws ofslope ~ -1.8 with correlation lengths of approximately 7.4 mpc/h, 6.3 mpc/h,and 4.7 mpc/h, respectively.

astro-ph;0205243	estimating fixed frame galaxy magnitudes in the sdss	broad-band measurements of flux for galaxies at different redshifts measuredifferent regions of the rest-frame galaxy spectrum. certain astronomicalquestions, such as the evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies,require transforming these magnitudes into redshift-independent quantities. toprepare to address these astronomical questions, investigated in detail insubsequent papers, we fit spectral energy distributions (seds) to broad bandphotometric observations, in the context of the optical observations of thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). linear combinations of four spectral templatescan reproduce the five sdss magnitudes of all galaxies to the precision of thephotometry. expressed in the appropriate coordinate system, the locus of thecoefficients multiplying the templates is planar, and in fact nearly linear.the resulting reconstructed seds can be used to recover fixed frame magnitudesover a range of redshifts. this process yields consistent results, in the sensethat within each sample the intrinsic colors of similar type galaxies arenearly constant with redshift. we compare our results to simpler interpolationmethods and galaxy spectrophotometry from the sdss. the software that generatesthese results is publicly available and easily adapted to handle a wide rangeof galaxy observations.

astro-ph;0210215	the galaxy luminosity function and luminosity density at redshift z=0.1	using a catalog of 147,986 galaxy redshifts and fluxes from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) we measure the galaxy luminosity density at z=0.1 in fiveoptical bandpasses corresponding to the sdss bandpasses shifted to match theirrestframe shape at z=0.1. we denote the bands {0.1}{u}, {0.1}{g}, {0.1}{r},{0.1}{i}, {0.1}{z}, with \lambda_{eff} = [3216, 4240, 5595, 6792, 8111]angstroms respectively. we use a maximum likelihood method which allows for ageneral form for the shape of the luminosity function, simple luminosity andnumber evolution, incorporates flux uncertainties, and accounts for the fluxlimits of the survey. we find luminosity densities at z=0.1 in absolute abmagnitudes in a mpc^3 of [-14.10 \pm 0.15, -15.18 \pm 0.03, -15.90 \pm 0.03,-16.24 \pm 0.03, -16.56 \pm 0.02] in [{0.1}{u}, {0.1}{g}, {0.1}{r}, {0.1}{i},{0.1}{z}], respectively, using \omega_0 =0.3, \omega_\lambda=0.7, and h=1, andusing petrosian magnitudes. similar results are obtained using sersic modelmagnitudes, suggesting that flux from outside the petrosian apertures is not amajor correction. in the {0.1}{r} band, the best fit schechter function to ourresults has \phi_\ast = (1.49 \pm 0.04) \times 10^{-2} h^3 mpc^{-3}, m_\ast -5\log_{10} h = -20.44 \pm 0.01, and \alpha = -1.05\pm 0.01. in solarluminosities, the luminosity density in {0.1}{r} is (1.84 \pm 0.04) h 10^8l_{{0.1}{r},\odot} mpc^{-3}. our results are consistent with other estimates ofthe luminosity density, from the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey andthe millenium galaxy catalog. they represent a substantial change (\sim 0.5mag) from earlier sdss luminosity density results based on commissioning data,almost entirely because of the inclusion of evolution in the luminosityfunction model.

astro-ph;0301005	the sloan digital sky survey: the cosmic spectrum and star-formation  history	we present a determination of the `cosmic optical spectrum' of the universe,i.e. the ensemble emission from galaxies, as determined from the red-selectedsloan digital sky survey main galaxy sample and compare with previous resultsof the blue-selected 2df galaxy redshift survey. broadly we find good agreementin both the spectrum and the derived star-formation histories. if we use apower-law star-formation history model where star-formation rate $\propto(1+z)^\beta$ out to z=1, then we find that $\beta$ of 2 to 3 is still the mostlikely model and there is no evidence for current surveys missing large amountsof star formation at high redshift. in particular `fossil cosmology' of thelocal universe gives measures of star-formation history which are consistentwith direct observations at high redshift. using the photometry of sdss we areable to derive the cosmic spectrum in absolute units (i.e.$ w \aa$^{-1}$mpc$^{-3}$) at 2--5\aa resolution and find good agreement with publishedbroad-band luminosity densities. for a salpeter imf the best fit stellarmass/light ratio is 3.7--7.5 $\msun/\lsun$ in the r-band (corresponding to$\omstars h = 0.0025$--0.0055) and from both the stellar emission history andthe h$\alpha$ luminosity density independently we find a cosmologicalstar-formation rate of 0.03--0.04 h $\msun$ yr$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-3}$ today.

astro-ph;0301280	on departures from a power law in the galaxy correlation function	we measure the projected correlation function w_p(r_p) from the sloan digitalsky survey for a flux-limited sample of 118,000 galaxies and for a volumelimited subset of 22,000 galaxies with absolute magnitude m_r&lt;-21. bothcorrelation functions show subtle but systematic departures from the best-fitpower law, in particular a change in slope at r_p~1-2 mpc/h. these departuresare stronger for the volume-limited sample, which is restricted to relativelyluminous galaxies. we show that the inflection point in w_p(r_p) can benaturally explained by contemporary models of galaxy clustering, according towhich it marks the transition from a large scale regime dominated by galaxypairs in separate dark matter halos to a small scale regime dominated by galaxypairs in the same dark matter halo. for example, given the dark halo populationpredicted by an inflationary cold dark matter scenario, the projectedcorrelation function of the volume-limited sample can be well reproduced by amodel in which the mean number of m_r&lt;-21 galaxies in a halo of mass m&gt;m_1=4.74x 10^{13}\msun/h is &lt;n&gt;_m=(m/m_1)^{0.89}, with 75% of the galaxies residing inless massive, single-galaxy halos. this physically motivated model has the samenumber of free parameters as a power law, and it fits the w_p(r_p) data better,with a \chi^2/d.o.f.=0.93 compared to 6.12 (for 10 degrees of freedom,incorporating the covariance of the correlation function errors). departuresfrom a power-law correlation function encode information about the relationbetween galaxies and dark matter halos. higher precision measurements of thesedepartures for multiple classes of galaxies will constrain galaxy bias andprovide new tests of the theory of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0406633	interpreting the relationship between galaxy luminosity, color and  environment	we study the relationship between galaxy luminosity, color, and environmentin a cosmological simulation of galaxy formation. we compare the predictedrelationship with that found for sdss galaxies and find that the modelsuccessfully predicts most of the qualitative features seen in the data, butalso shows some interesting differences. specifically, the simulation predictsthat the local density around bright red galaxies is a strong increasingfunction of luminosity, but does not depend much on color at fixed luminosity.moreover, we show that this is due to central galaxies in dark matter haloswhose baryonic masses correlate strongly with halo mass. the simulation alsopredicts that the local density around blue galaxies is a strong increasingfunction of color, but does not depend much on luminosity at fixed color. weshow that this is due to satellite galaxies in halos whose stellar agescorrelate with halo mass. finally, the simulation fails to predict theluminosity dependence of environment observed around low luminosity redgalaxies. however, we show that this is most likely due to the simulation'slimited resolution. a study of a higher resolution, smaller volume simulationsuggests that this dependence is caused by the fact that all low luminosity redgalaxies are satellites in massive halos, whereas intermediate luminosity redgalaxies are a mixture of satellites in massive halos and central galaxies inless massive halos.

astro-ph;0408003	cosmology and the halo occupation distribution from small-scale galaxy  clustering in the sloan digital sky survey	we use the projected correlation function w_p(r_p) of a volume-limitedsubsample of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) main galaxy redshift catalogueto measure the halo occupation distribution (hod) of the galaxies of thesample. simultaneously, we allow the cosmology to vary within cosmologicalconstraints imposed by cosmic microwave background experiments in a lambda-cdmmodel. we find that combining w_p(r_p) for this sample alone with theobservations by wmap, acbar, cbi and vsa can provide one of the most precisetechniques available to measure cosmological parameters. for a minimal flatsix-parameter lambda-cdm model with an hod with three free parameters, we findomega_m=0.278^{+0.027}_{-0.027}, sigma_8=0.812^{+0.028}_{-0.027}, andh_0=69.8^{+2.6}_{-2.6}km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}; these errors are significantlysmaller than from cmb alone and similar to those obtained by combining cmb withthe large-scale galaxy power spectrum assuming scale-independent bias. thecorresponding hod parameters describing the minimum halo mass and thenormalization and cut-off of the satellite mean occupation arem_min=(3.03^{+0.36}_{-0.36})x 10^{12} h^{-1} m_sun, m_1 =(4.58^{+0.60}_{-0.60})x 10^{13} h^{-1} m_sun, and kappa=4.44^{+0.51}_{-0.69}.when more parameters are added to the hod model, the error bars on the hodparameters increase because of degeneracies, but the error bars on thecosmological parameters do not increase greatly. similar modeling for othergalaxy samples could reduce the statistical errors on these results, while morethorough investigations of the cosmology dependence of nonlinear halo bias andhalo mass functions are needed to eliminate remaining systematic uncertainties,which may be comparable to statistical uncertainties.

astro-ph;0411037	the scale-dependence of relative galaxy bias: encouragement for the halo  model description	we investigate the relationship between the colors, luminosities, andenvironments of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey spectroscopic sample,using environmental measurements on scales ranging from 0.2 to 6 mpc/h. wefind: (1) that the relationship between color and environment persists even tothe lowest luminosities we probe (absolute magnitude in the r band of about -14for h=1); (2) at luminosities and colors for which the galaxy correlationfunction has a large amplitude, it also has a steep slope; and (3) in regionsof a given overdensity on small scales (1 mpc/h), the overdensity on largescales (6 mpc/h) does not appear to relate to the recent star formation historyof the galaxies. of these results, the last has the most immediate applicationto galaxy formation theory. in particular, it lends support to the notion thata galaxy's properties are related only to the mass of its host dark matterhalo, and not to the larger scale environment.

astro-ph;0501042	active galactic nuclei in the sloan digital sky survey: ii.  emission-line luminosity function	the emission line luminosity function of active galactic nuclei (agn) ismeasured from about 3000 agn included in the main galaxy sample of the sloandigital sky survey within a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.15$. the $\ha$ and[oiii]$\lambda 5007$ luminosity functions for seyferts cover luminosity rangeof $10^{5-9}$$l_\odot$ in h$\alpha$ and the shapes are well fit by broken powerlaws, without a turnover at fainter nuclear luminosities. assuming a universalconversion from emission line strength to continuum luminosity, the inferred bband magnitude luminosity function is comparable both to the agn luminosityfunction of previous studies and to the low redshift quasar luminosity functionderived from the 2df redshift survey. the inferred agn number density isapproximately 1/5 of all galaxies and about $6\times 10^{-3}$ of the totallight of galaxies in the $r$-band comes from the nuclear activity. the numbersof seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s are comparable at low luminosity, while at highluminosity, seyfert 1s outnumber seyfert 2s by a factor of 2-4. in making theluminosity function measurements, we assumed that the nuclear luminosity isindependent of the host galaxy luminosity, an assumption we test {\it aposteriori}, and show to be consistent with the data. given the relationshipbetween black hole mass and host galaxy bulge luminosity, the lack ofcorrelation between nuclear and host luminosity suggests that the main variablethat determines the agn luminosity is the eddington ratio, not the black holemass. this appears to be different from luminous quasars, which are most likelyto be shining near the eddington limit.

astro-ph;0501201	systematic errors in weak lensing: application to sdss galaxy-galaxy  weak lensing	weak lensing is emerging as a powerful observational tool to constraincosmological models, but is at present limited by an incomplete understandingof many sources of systematic error. many of these errors are multiplicativeand depend on the population of background galaxies. we show how the commonlycited geometric test, which is rather insensitive to cosmology, can be used asa ratio test of systematics in the lensing signal at the 1 per cent level. weapply this test to the galaxy-galaxy lensing analysis of the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss), which at present is the sample with the highest weak lensingsignal to noise and has the additional advantage of spectroscopic redshifts forlenses. this allows one to perform meaningful geometric tests of systematicsfor different subsamples of galaxies at different mean redshifts, such asbrighter galaxies, fainter galaxies and high-redshift luminous red galaxies,both with and without photometric redshift estimates. we use overlappingobjects between sdss and the deep2 and 2slaq spectroscopic surveys to establishaccurate calibration of photometric redshifts and to determine the redshiftdistributions for sdss. we use these redshift results to compute the projectedsurface density contrast deltasigma around 259 609 spectroscopic galaxies inthe sdss; by measuring deltasigma with different source samples we establishconsistency of the results at the 10 per cent level (1-sigma). we also use theratio test to constrain shear calibration biases and other systematics in thesdss survey data to determine the overall galaxy-galaxy weak lensing signalcalibration uncertainty. we find no evidence of any inconsistency among manysubsamples of the data.

astro-ph;0505057	modeling complete distributions with incomplete observations: the  velocity ellipsoid from hipparcos data	[abridged] a "missing data" algorithm is developed to model (ie, reconstruct)the three-dimensional velocity distribution function of a sample of stars usingdata (velocity measurements) every one of which has one dimension unmeasured(the radial direction). it also accounts for covariant measurementuncertainties on the tangential velocity components. the algorithm is appliedto tangential velocities measured in a kinematically unbiased sample of 11,865stars taken from the hipparcos catalog. the local stellar velocity distributionfunction of each of a set of 20 color-selected subsamples is modeled as amixture of two three-dimensional gaussian ellipsoids of arbitrary relativeresponsibility. in the fitting, one gaussian (the "halo") is fixed at the knownmean velocity and velocity variance tensor of the galaxy halo, and the other(the "disk") is allowed to take arbitrary mean and arbitrary variance tensor.the mean and variance tensor (commonly the "velocity ellipsoid") of the diskvelocity distribution are both found to be strong functions of stellar color,with long-lived populations showing larger velocity dispersion, slower meanrotation velocity, and smaller vertex deviation than short-lived populations.the local standard of rest (lsr) is inferred in the usual way and the sun'smotion relative to the lsr is found to be(u,v,w)_{\odot}=(10.1,4.0,6.7)+/-(0.5,0.8,0.2) km/s. artificial data sets aremade and analyzed, with the same error properties as the hipparcos data, todemonstrate that the analysis is unbiased. the results are shown to beinsensitive to the assumption that the velocity distributions are gaussian.

astro-ph;0512004	what galaxies know about their nearest cluster	we investigate the extent to which galaxies' star-formation histories andmorphologies are determined by their clustocentric distance and their nearestcluster's richness. we look at three tracers of star-formation history (i-bandabsolute magnitude m_i, [g-r] color, and halpha emission line equivalent width)and two indicators of galaxy morphology (surface brightness and radialconcentration) for 52,569 galaxies in the redshift range of 0.015&lt;z&lt;0.068. wefind that our morphology indicators relate to the clustocentric distance onlyindirectly through their relationships with stellar population andstarformation rate. galaxies that are near the cluster center tend to be moreluminous, redder and have lower halpha ew (ie, lower star-formation rates) thanthose that lie near or outside the virial radius of the cluster. the detailedrelationships between these galaxy properties and clustocentric distance dependon cluster richness. for richer clusters, we find that (i) the transition incolor and halpha ew from cluster center to field values is more abrupt andoccurs closer to the cluster virial radius, and (ii) the color and halpha ewdistributions are overall narrower than in less rich clusters. we also findthat the radial gradient seen in the luminosity distribution is strongestaround the smaller clusters and decreases as cluster richness increases. wefind there is a `characteristic distance' at around one virial radius (theinfall region) where the change with radius of galaxy property distributions ismost dramatic, but we find no evidence for infall-triggered star bursts. theseresults suggest that galaxies `know' the distance to, and the size of, theirnearest cluster and they express this information in their star-formationhistories.

astro-ph;0512127	galaxies in sdss and deep2: a quiet life on the blue sequence?	in the six billion years between redshifts z=1 and z=0.1, galaxies change dueto the aging of their stellar populations, the formation of new stars, andmergers with other galaxies. here i explore the relative importance of thesevarious effects, finding that while mergers are likely to be important for thered galaxy sequence they are unlikely to affect more than 10% of the bluegalaxy sequence. i compare the galaxy population at redshift z=0.1 from thesloan digital sky survey to that at z=1 from the deep extragalacticevolutionary probe 2. galaxies are bluer at z=1: the blue sequence by about 0.3mag and the red sequence by about 0.1 mag, in redshift z=0.1 (u-g) color. ievaluate the change in color and in the luminosity functions of the twosequences using some simplistic stellar population synthesis models. thesemodels indicate that the luminous end of the red sequence fades less thanpassive evolution allows by about 0.2 mag. due to a lack of luminous blueprogenitors, ``dry'' mergers betweeen red galaxies then must create theluminous red population at z=0.1, if stellar population models are correct. theblue sequence colors and luminosity function are consistent with a reduction inthe star-formation rate since redshift z=1 by a factor of about three, with nochange in the number density to within 10%. these results restrict the numberof blue galaxies that can fall onto the red sequence by any process, and inparticular suggest that if mergers are catastrophic events they must be rarefor blue galaxies.

astro-ph;0512376	constraining the projected radial distribution of galactic satellites  with the sloan digital sky survey	we use the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) spectroscopic sample to constrainthe projected radial distribution of satellites around isolated ~ l* galaxies.we employ mock galaxy catalogs derived from high-resolution cosmologicalsimulations to investigate the effects of interloper contamination and showthat interlopers significantly bias the estimated slope of the projected radialdistribution of satellites. we also show that the distribution of interlopersaround galaxies is expected to be non-uniform in velocity space becausegalaxies are clustered and reside in crowded environments. successful methodsof interloper contamination correction should therefore take into accountenvironments of the host galaxies. two such new methods are presented and themost reliable of them is used to correct for interloper contamination inanalyses of the sdss galaxy sample. the best fit power-law slope of theinterloper-corrected surface density distribution of satellites, sigma(r) ~r^alpha, in the volume-limited sdss sample is alpha ~ -1.7 +/- 0.1, independentof the galaxy and satellite luminosities. comparison with lambda-cdmsimulations shows that the radial distribution of the sdss satellites is moreconcentrated than that of subhalos around galaxy-sized halos, especially at r &lt;100 kpc/h. the predicted dark matter radial distribution is somewhat moreconcentrated than the profile of the sdss satellites, but the difference is notstatistically significant for our sample.

astro-ph;0606599	what triggers galaxy transformations? the environments of post-starburst  galaxies	(abridged) there are good observational reasons to believe that theprogenitors of red galaxies have undergone starbursts, followed by apost-starburst phase. we investigate the environments of post-starburstgalaxies by measuring \textsl{(1)} number densities in $8 h^{-1} \mathrm{mpc}$radius comoving spheres, \textsl{(2)} transverse distances to nearestvirgo-like galaxy clusters, and \textsl{(3)} transverse distances to nearestluminous-galaxy neighbors. we compare the post-starburst galaxies to currentlystar-forming galaxies identified solely by a-star excess or $\halpha$ emission.we find that post-starburst galaxies are in the same kinds of environments asstar-forming galaxies; this is our ``null hypothesis''. more importantly, wefind that at each value of the a-star excess, the star-forming andpost-starburst galaxies lie in very similar distributions of environment. theonly deviations from our null hypothesis are barely significant: a slightdeficit of post-starburst galaxies (relative to the star-forming population) invery low-density regions, a small excess inside the virial radii of clusters,and a slight excess with nearby neighbors. none of these effects is strongenough to make the post-starburst galaxies a high-density phenomenon, or toargue that the starburst events are primarily triggered by external tidalimpulses (e.g., from close passages of massive galaxies). the small excessinside cluster virial radii suggests that some post-starbursts are triggered byinteractions with the intracluster medium, but this represents a very smallfraction of all post-starburst galaxies.

astro-ph;0608353	what aspects of galaxy environment matter?	we determine what aspects of the density field surrounding galaxies mostaffect their properties. for sloan digital sky survey galaxies, we measure thegroup environment, meaning the host group luminosity and the distance from thegroup center (hereafter, ``groupocentric distance''). for comparison, wemeasure the surrounding density field on scales ranging from 100 kpc/h to 10mpc/h. we use the relationship between color and group environment to test thenull hypothesis that only the group environment matters, searching for aresidual dependence of properties on the surrounding density. generally, redgalaxies are slightly more clustered on small scales (about 100--300 kpc/h)than the null hypothesis predicts, possibly indicating that substructure withingroups has some importance. at large scales (&gt; 1 mpc/h), the actual projectedcorrelation functions of galaxies are biased at less than the 5% level withrespect to the null hypothesis predictions. we exclude strongly the conversenull hypothesis, that only the surrounding density (on any scale) matters.these results generally encourage the use of the halo model description ofgalaxy bias, which models the galaxy distribution as a function of host halomass alone. we compare these results to proposed galaxy formation scenarioswithin the cold dark matter cosmological model.

astro-ph;0610524	the clustering of galaxy groups: dependence on mass and other properties	we investigate the clustering of galaxy groups and clusters in the sdss usingthe berlind et al. (2006) group sample, which is designed to identify galaxysystems that each occupy a single dark matter halo. we estimate group massesfrom their abundances, and measure their relative large-scale bias as afunction of mass. our measurements are in agreement with the theoretical halobias function, given a standard lcdm cosmological model, and they tend to favora low value of the power spectrum amplitude sigma_8. we search for a residualdependence of clustering on other group properties at fixed mass, and find thestrongest signal for central galaxy color in high mass groups. massive groupswith less red central galaxies are more biased on large scales than similarmass groups with redder central galaxies. we show that this effect is unlikelyto be caused by errors in our mass estimates, and is most likely observationalevidence of recent theoretical findings that halo bias depends on a ``secondparameter'' other than mass, such as age or concentration. to compare with thedata, we study the bias of massive halos in n-body simulations and quantify thestrength of the relation between halo bias and concentration at fixed mass. inaddition to confirming a non-trivial prediction of the lcdm cosmological model,these results have important implications for the role that environment playsin shaping galaxy properties.

astro-ph;0611610	environmental dependence of properties of galaxies in the sloan digital  sky survey	we investigate the dependence of physical properties of galaxies brighterthan m_r=-18.0 in the sdss on environment, as measured by local density usingan adaptive smoothing kernel. we find that variations of galaxy properties withenvironment are almost entirely due to the dependence of morphology andluminosity on environment. because galaxy properties depend not only onluminosity but also on morphology, it is clear that galaxy properties cannot bedetermined solely by dark halo mass. when morphology and luminosity are fixed,other physical properties, such as color, color-gradient, concentration, size,velocity dispersion, and star formation rate, are nearly independent of localdensity. the only feature is the sharp decrease of late type fraction above thecritical luminosity of about m_r=-21.3 in the morphology versus luminosityrelation. weak residual dependences on environment include that of the color oflate-types (bluer at lower density) and of the l-sigma relation of early-types(larger dispersion at higher density for bright galaxies). the early-typefraction is a monotonically increasing function of local density andluminosity. the morphology-density- luminosity relation should be a keyconstraint on galaxy formation models. we demonstrate that the dependence onenvironment of the morphology of galaxie originates from variations in densityon effective gaussian smoothing scales much smaller than 12 h^{-1}mpc. we findthat galaxy morphology varies both with density measured on an effectivegaussian smoothing scale of 4.7 h^{-1} mpc and on distance to the nearestbright galaxy (particularly, for about 0.2 h^{-1}mpc). we propose a mechanismthat the morphology of galaxies in galaxy systems is transformed by the tidalforce.

0811.3035	the [o ii] lambda 3727 luminosity function at z ~ 1	we measure the evolution of the [oii]lambda 3727 luminosity function at0.75&lt;z&lt;1.45 using high-resolution spectroscopy of ~14,000 galaxies observed bythe deep2 galaxy redshift survey. we find that brighter than l_{oii}=10^{42}erg s^(-1) the luminosity function is well-represented by a power law dn/dl ~l^{\alpha} with slope \alpha ~ -3. the number density of [oii] emittinggalaxies above this luminosity declines by a factor of &gt;~2.5 between z ~ 1.35and z ~ 0.84. in the limit of no number-density evolution, the characteristic[oii] luminosity, l^*_[oii], defined as the luminosity where the space densityequals 10^{-3.5} dex^{-1} mpc^{-3}, declines by a factor of ~1.8 over the sameredshift interval. assuming that l_[oii] is proportional to the star-formationrate (sfr), and negligible change in the typical dust attenuation in galaxiesat fixed [oii] luminosity, the measured decline in l^*_[oii] implies a ~25% pergyr decrease in the amount of star formation in galaxies during this epoch.adopting a faint-end power-law slope of -1.3\pm0.2, we derive the comoving sfrdensity in four redshift bins centered around z~1 by integrating the observed[oii] luminosity function using a local, empirical calibration between l_[oii]and sfr, which statistically accounts for variations in dust attenuation andmetallicity among galaxies. we find that our estimate of the sfr density at z~1is consistent with previous measurements based on a variety of independent sfrindicators.
