0901.2241	from outburst to quiescence: the decay of the transient anomalous x-ray  pulsar xte j1810-197	xte j1810-197 is the first transient anomalous x-ray pulsar ever discovered.its highly variable x-ray flux allowed us to study the timing and spectralemission properties of a magnetar candidate over a flux range of about twoorders of magnitude. we analyzed nine xmm-newton observations of xte j1810-197collected over a four years baseline (september 2003 - september 2007). epic pnand mos data were reduced and used for detailed timing and spectral analysis.pulse phase spectroscopic studies were also carried out for observations withsufficiently high signal to noise. we find that: (i) a three blackbodies modelreproduces the spectral properties of the source over the entire outburststatistically better than the two blackbodies model previously used in theliterature, (ii) the coldest blackbody is consistent with the thermal emissionfrom the whole surface, and has temperature and radius similar to thoseinferred from rosat observations before the outburst onset, (iii) there is aspectral feature around 1.1 kev during six consecutive observations (sincemarch 2005); if due to proton resonant cyclotron scattering, it would imply amagnetic field of around 2e14 g. this is in a very good agreement with thevalue from the spin period measurements.

0901.3576	vlt/naco near-infrared observations of the transient radio magnetar 1e  1547.0-5408	despite about a decade of observations, very little is known about theoptical and infrared (ir) emission properties of the soft gamma-ray repeaters(sgrs) and of the anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps), the magnetar candidates, andabout the physical processes which drive their emission at these wavelengths.this is mainly due to the limited number of identifications achieved so far,five in total, and to the sparse spectral coverage obtained from multi-bandoptical/ir photometry. aim of this work is to search for a likely candidatecounterpart to the recently discovered transient radio axp 1e 1547.0-5408. weperformed the first deep near-ir (nir) observations (ks band) of 1e 1547.0-5408with the vlt on three nights (july 8th, 12th, and august 17th), after the x-raysource rebrightening and during the subsequent decay reported around june 2007.we detected four objects within, or close to, the 3sigma radio position of 1e1547.0-5408. the faintest of them (object 1) has a brightness k = 20.27 +/-0.05, which would yield an unabsorbed x-ray to nir flux ratio fx/fks ~ 800 for1e 1547.0-5408, i.e. on average lower than those derived for other magnetars.the non-detection of object 1 on the nights of july 8th and august 17th onlyallowed us to set an upper limit of delta ks ~ 0.2 on its nir variability,which prevented us to search for correlations with the radio or x-ray flux. wedetected no other object at the radio position down to a limit of ks ~ 21.7 (at5sigma), computed in our deepest vlt image (july 12th). from our observationswe can not confidently propose a nir counterpart to 1e 1547.0-5408. more nirobservations of object 1, e.g. to determine its colors and to monitorvariability, would be conclusive to determine whether or not it can beconsidered a plausible candidate.

0706.2573	vlt/naco observations of the high-magnetic field radio pulsar psr  j1119-6127	recent radio observations have unveiled the existence of a number of radiopulsars with spin-down derived magnetic fields in the magnetar range. however,their observational properties appears to be more similar to classical radiopulsars than to magnetars. to shed light on this puzzle we first have todetermine whether the spin-down derived magnetic field values for these radiopulsars are indeed representative of the actual neutron star magnetic field orif they are polluted, e.g. by the effects of a torque from a fallback disk. toinvestigate this possibility, we have performed deep ir observations of one ofthese high magnetic field radio pulsars (psr j1119-6127) with the eso vlt tosearch for ir emission which can be associated with a disk. no ir emission isdetected from the pulsar position down to j=24, h=23, ks=22. by comparing ourflux upper limits with the predictions of fallback disk models, we have foundthat we can only exclude the presence of a disk with accretion rate dot m&gt;3x10^16 g/s. this lower limit cannot rule out the presence of a substantialdisk torque on the pulsar, which would then lead to overestimate the value ofthe magnetic field inferred from p and dot p.

0906.1394	discovery of extended x-ray emission around the highly magnetic rrat  j1819-1458	we report on the discovery of extended x-ray emission around the highmagnetic field rotating radio transient j1819-1458. using a 30ks chandra acis-sobservation, we found significant evidence for extended x-ray emission with apeculiar shape: a compact region out to 5.5", and more diffuse emissionextending out to ~13" from the source. the most plausible interpretation is anebula somehow powered by the pulsar, although the small number of countsprevents a conclusive answer on the nature of this emission. rrat j1819-1458'sspin-down energy loss rate (edot~3x10^{32} erg/s) is much lower than that ofother pulsars with observed spin-down powered pulsar wind nebulae (pwne), andimplies a rather high x-ray efficiency of eta_{x} = l_(pwn; 0.5-8kev)/edot~0.2at converting spin-down power into the pwn x-ray emission. this suggests theneed of an additional source of energy rather than the spin-down power alone,such as the high magnetic energy of this source. furthermore, this chandraobservation allowed us to refine the positional accuracy of rrat j1819-1458 toa radius of ~0.3", and confirms the presence of x-ray pulsations and the ~1kevabsorption line, previously observed in the x-ray emission of this source.

0907.2873	spin-down rate and inferred dipole magnetic field of the soft gamma-ray  repeater sgr 1627-41	using chandra data taken on 2008 june, we detected pulsations at 2.59439(4) sin the soft gamma-ray repeater sgr 1627-41. this is the second measurement ofthe source spin period and allows us to derive for the first time a long-termspin-down rate of (1.9 +/- 0.4)e-11 s/s. from this value we infer for sgr1627-41 a characteristic age of 2.2 kyr, a spin-down luminosity of 4e+34 erg/s(one of the highest among sources of the same class), and a surface dipolemagnetic field strength of 2e+14 g. these properties confirm the magnetarnature of sgr 1627-41; however, they should be considered with caution sincethey were derived on the basis of a period derivative measurement made usingtwo epochs only and magnetar spin-down rates are generally highly variable. thepulse profile, double-peaked and with a pulsed fraction of (13 +/- 2)% in the2-10 kev range, closely resembles that observed by xmm-newton in 2008september. having for the first time a timing model for this sgr, we alsosearched for a pulsed signal in archival radio data collected with the parkesradio telescope nine months after the previous x-ray outburst. no evidence forradio pulsations was found, down to a luminosity level 10-20 times fainter (fora 10% duty cycle and a distance of 11 kpc) than the peak luminosity shown bythe known radio magnetars.

0911.3064	the dust-scattering x-ray rings of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e  1547.0-5408	on 2009 january 22 numerous strong bursts were detected from the anomalousx-ray pulsar 1e 1547.0-5408. swift/xrt and xmm-newton/epic observations carriedout in the following two weeks led to the discovery of three x-ray ringscentered on this source. the ring radii increased with time following theexpansion law expected for a short impulse of x-rays scattered by three dustclouds. assuming different models for the dust composition and grain sizedistribution, we fit the intensity decay of each ring as a function of time atdifferent energies, obtaining tight constrains on the distance of the x-raysource. although the distance strongly depends on the adopted dust model, wefind that some models are incompatible with our x-ray data, restricting to 4-8kpc the range of possible distances for 1e 1547.0-5408. the best-fitting dustmodel provides a source distance of 3.91 +/- 0.07 kpc, which is compatible withthe proposed association with the supernova remnant g 327.24-0.13, and impliesdistances of 2.2 kpc, 2.6 kpc and 3.4 kpc for the dust clouds, in goodagreement with the dust distribution inferred by co line observations towards1e 1547.0-5408. however, dust distances in agreement with co data are alsoobtained for a set of similarly well-fitting models that imply a sourcedistance of about 5 kpc. a distance of about 4-5 kpc is also favored by thefact that these dust models are already known to provide good fits to thedust-scattering halos of bright x-ray binaries.

1107.5488	is sgr 0418+5729 indeed a waning magnetar ?	sgr 0418+5729 is a transient soft gamma-ray repeater which underwent a majoroutburst in june 2009, during which the emission of short bursts was observed.its properties appeared quite typical of other sources of the same class untillong-term x-ray monitoring failed to detect any period derivative. the presentupper limit on $\dot p$ implies that the surface dipole field is $b_p\lesssim7.5\times 10^{12}\ {\rm g}$ (rea et al 2010), well below those measured inother soft gamma-ray repeaters (sgrs) and in the anomalous x-ray pulsars(axps), a group of similar sources. both sgrs and axps are currently believedto be powered by ultra-magnetized neutron stars (magnetars, $b_p\approx10^{14}$--$10^{15}\ {\rm g}$). sgr 0418+5729 hardly seems to fit in such apicture. we show that the magneto-rotational properties of sgr 0418+5729 can bereproduced if this is an aged magnetar, $\approx 1\ {\rm myr}$ old, whichexperienced substantial field decay. the large initial toroidal component ofthe internal field required to match the observed properties of sgr 0418+5729ensures that crustal fractures, and hence bursting activity, can still occur atpresent time. the thermal spectrum observed during the outburst decay iscompatible with the predictions of a resonant compton scattering model (as inother sgrs/axps) if the field is low and the magnetospheric twist moderate.

1301.0245	deep optical observations of the gamma-ray pulsar psr j0007+7303 in the  cta 1 supernova remnant	the fermi large area telescope (lat) discovered the time signature of aradio-silent pulsar coincident with rx j0007.0+7302, a plerion-like x-raysource at the centre of the cta 1 supernova remnant. the inferred timingparameters of the gamma-ray pulsar psr j0007+7303 (p=315.8 ms; dot{p}\sim3.610^{-13} s s^{-1}) point to a vela-like neutron star, with an age comparable tothat of cta 1. the psr j0007+7303 low distance (\sim 1.4 kpc), interstellarabsorption (a_v\sim 1.6), and relatively high energy loss rate (dot{e} \sim4.510^{35} erg s^{-1}), make it a suitable candidate for an optical follow-up.here, we present deep optical observations of psr j0007+7303. the pulsar is notdetected in the gran telescopio canarias (gtc) images down to a limit of r'\sim27.6 (3 sigma), the deepest ever obtained for this pulsar, while williamherschel telescope (wht) images yield a limit of v \sim 26.9. our r'-band limitcorresponds to an optical emission efficiency \eta_{opt}= l_{opt}/dot{e} &lt; 9.410^{-8}. this limit is more constraining than those derived for other vela-likepulsars, but is still above the measured optical efficiency of the vela pulsar.we compared the optical upper limits with the extrapolation of the xmm-newtonx-ray spectrum and found that the optical emission is compatible with theextrapolation of the x-ray power-law component, at variance with what isobserved, e.g. in the vela pulsar.

1303.5579	the outburst decay of the low magnetic field magnetar sgr 0418+5729	we report on the long term x-ray monitoring of the outburst decay of the lowmagnetic field magnetar sgr 0418+5729, using all the available x-ray dataobtained with rxte, swift, chandra, and xmm-newton observations, from thediscovery of the source in june 2009, up to august 2012. the timing analysisallowed us to obtain the first measurement of the period derivative of sgr0418+5729: \dot{p}=4(1)x10^{-15} s/s, significant at ~3.5 sigma confidencelevel. this leads to a surface dipolar magnetic field of b_dip ~6x 10^{12} g.this measurement confirms sgr 0418+5729 as the lowest magnetic field magnetar.following the flux and spectral evolution from the beginning of the outburst upto ~1200 days, we observe a gradual cooling of the tiny hot spot responsiblefor the x-ray emission, from a temperature of ~0.9 to 0.3 kev. simultaneously,the x-ray flux decreased by about 3 orders of magnitude: from about1.4x10^{-11} to 1.2x10^{-14} erg/s/cm^2 . deep radio, millimeter, optical andgamma-ray observations did not detect the source counterpart, implyingstringent limits on its multi-band emission, as well as constraints on thepresence of a fossil disk. by modeling the magneto-thermal secular evolution ofsgr 0418+5729, we infer a realistic age of ~550 kyr, and a dipolar magneticfield at birth of ~10^{14} g. the outburst characteristics suggest the presenceof a thin twisted bundle with a small heated spot at its base. the bundleuntwisted in the first few months following the outburst, while the hot spotdecreases in temperature and size. we estimate the outburst rate of lowmagnetic field magnetars to be about one per year per galaxy, and we brieflydiscuss the consequences of such result in several other astrophysicalcontexts.

1305.3884	swings between rotation and accretion power in a millisecond binary  pulsar	it is thought that neutron stars in low-mass binary systems can accretematter and angular momentum from the companion star and be spun-up tomillisecond rotational periods. during the accretion stage, the system iscalled a low-mass x-ray binary, and bright x-ray emission is observed. when therate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, thesebinaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by theneutron star's rotating magnetic field. this evolutionary model is supported bythe detection of millisecond x-ray pulsations from several accreting neutronstars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsar. it has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar maytemporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. here wereport observations of accretion-powered, millisecond x-ray pulsations from aneutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. within a fewdays after a month-long x-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. thisnot only shows the evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsars, but also that some systems can swing between the twostates on very short timescales.

1403.6775	spin frequency distributions of binary millisecond pulsars	rotation-powered millisecond radio pulsars have been spun up to their presentspin period by a $10^8$ - $10^9$ yr long x-ray-bright phase of accretion ofmatter and angular momentum in a low-to-intermediate mass binary system.recently, the discovery of transitional pulsars that alternate cyclicallybetween accretion and rotation-powered states on time scales of a few years orshorter, has demonstrated this evolutionary scenario. here, we present athorough statistical analysis of the spin distributions of the various classesof millisecond pulsars to assess the evolution of their spin period between thedifferent stages. accreting sources that showed oscillations exclusively duringthermonuclear type i x-ray bursts (nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars) arefound to be significantly faster than rotation-powered sources, while accretingsources that possess a magnetosphere and show coherent pulsations (accretingmillisecond pulsars) are not. on the other hand, if accreting millisecondpulsars and eclipsing rotation-powered millisecond pulsars form a common classof transitional pulsars, these are shown to have a spin distributionintermediate between the faster nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars and theslower non-eclipsing rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. we interpret thesefindings in terms of a spin-down due to the decreasing mass-accretion rateduring the latest stages of the accretion phase, and in terms of the differentorbital evolutionary channels mapped by the various classes of pulsars. wesummarize possible instrumental selection effects, showing that even if anunbiased sample of pulsars is still lacking, their influence on the results ofthe presented analysis is reduced by recent improvements in instrumentation andsearching techniques.

1409.1027	comparing supernova remnants around strongly magnetized and canonical  pulsars	the origin of the strong magnetic fields measured in magnetars is one of themain uncertainties in the neutron star field. on the other hand, the recentdiscovery of a large number of such strongly magnetized neutron stars, iscalling for more investigation on their formation. the first proposed model forthe formation of such strong magnetic fields in magnetars was throughalpha-dynamo effects on the rapidly rotating core of a massive star. otherscenarios involve highly magnetic massive progenitors that conserve theirstrong magnetic moment into the core after the explosion, or a common envelopephase of a massive binary system. in this work, we do a complete re-analysis ofthe archival x-ray emission of the supernova remnants (snr) surroundingmagnetars, and compare our results with all other bright x-ray emitting snrs,which are associated with compact central objects (ccos; which are proposed tohave magnetar-like b-fields buried in the crust by strong accretion soon aftertheir formation), high-b pulsars and normal pulsars. we find that emissionlines in snrs hosting highly magnetic neutron stars do not differ significantlyin elements or ionization state from those observed in other snrs, neitheraveraging on the whole remnants, nor studying different parts of their totalspatial extent. furthermore, we find no significant evidence that the totalx-ray luminosities of snrs hosting magnetars, are on average larger than thatof typical young x-ray snrs. although biased by a small number of objects, wefound that for a similar age, there is the same percentage of magnetars showinga detectable snr than for the normal pulsar population.

1409.3224	on the fe k absorption - accretion state connection in the galactic  center neutron star x-ray binary ax j1745.6-2901	ax j1745.6-2901 is a high-inclination (eclipsing) neutron star low mass x-raybinary (lmxb) located less than ~1.5 arcmin from sgr a*. ongoing monitoringcampaigns have targeted sgr a* frequently and these observations also cover axj1745.6-2901. we present here an x-ray analysis of ax j1745.6-2901 using alarge dataset of 38 xmm-newton observations, including eleven which caught axj1745.6-2901 in outburst. fe k absorption is clearly seen when ax j1745.6-2901is in the soft state, but disappears during the hard state. the variability ofthese absorption features does not appear to be due to changes in the ionizingcontinuum. the small kalpha/kbeta ratio of the equivalent widths of the fe xxvand fe xxvi lines suggests that the column densities and turbulent velocitiesof the absorbing ionised plasma are in excess of n_h ~ 10^23 cm^-2 and v_turb&gt;~ 500 km s^-1. these findings strongly support a connection between the wind(fe k absorber) and the accretion state of the binary. these results revealstrong similarities between ax j1745.6-2901 and the eclipsing neutron starlmxb, exo 0748-676, as well as with high-inclination black hole binaries, wherewinds (traced by the same fe k absorption features) are observed only duringthe accretion-disc-dominated soft states, and disappear during the hard statescharacterised by jet emission.

1503.01307	the x-ray outburst of the galactic centre magnetar sgr j1745-2900 during  the first 1.5 year	in 2013 april a new magnetar, sgr 1745-2900, was discovered as it entered anoutburst, at only 2.4 arcsec angular distance from the supermassive black holeat the centre of the milky way, sagittarius a*. sgr 1745-2900 has a surfacedipolar magnetic field of ~ 2x10^{14} g, and it is the neutron star closest toa black hole ever observed. the new source was detected both in the radio andx-ray bands, with a peak x-ray luminosity l_x ~ 5x10^{35} erg s^{-1}. here wereport on the long-term chandra (25 observations) and xmm-newton (8observations) x-ray monitoring campaign of sgr 1745-2900, from the onset of theoutburst in april 2013 until september 2014. this unprecedented dataset allowsus to refine the timing properties of the source, as well as to study theoutburst spectral evolution as a function of time and rotational phase. ourtiming analysis confirms the increase in the spin period derivative by a factorof ~2 around june 2013, and reveals that a further increase occurred between2013 oct 30 and 2014 feb 21. we find that the period derivative changed from6.6x10^{-12} s s^{-1} to 3.3x10^{-11} s s^{-1} in 1.5 yr. on the other hand,this magnetar shows a slow flux decay compared to other magnetars and a ratherinefficient surface cooling. in particular, starquake-induced crustal coolingmodels alone have difficulty in explaining the high luminosity of the sourcefor the first ~200 days of its outburst, and additional heating of the starsurface from currents flowing in a twisted magnetic bundle is probably playingan important role in the outburst evolution.

1507.05452	population synthesis of isolated neutron stars with magneto-rotational  evolution ii: from radio-pulsars to magnetars	population synthesis studies constitute a powerful method to reconstruct thebirth distribution of periods and magnetic fields of the pulsar population.when this method is applied to populations in different wavelengths, it canbreak the degeneracy in the inferred properties of initial distributions thatarises from single-band studies. in this context, we extend previous works toinclude $x$-ray thermal emitting pulsars within the same evolutionary model asradio-pulsars. we find that the cumulative distribution of the number of x-raypulsars can be well reproduced by several models that, simultaneously,reproduce the characteristics of the radio-pulsar distribution. however, evenconsidering the most favourable magneto-thermal evolution models with fastfield decay, log-normal distributions of the initial magnetic fieldover-predict the number of visible sources with periods longer than 12 s. wethen show that the problem can be solved with different distributions ofmagnetic field, such as a truncated log-normal distribution, or a binormaldistribution with two distinct populations. we use the observational lack ofisolated nss with spin periods p&gt;12 s to establish an upper limit to thefraction of magnetars born with b &gt; 10^{15} g (less than 1\%). as futuredetections keep increasing the magnetar and high-b pulsar statistics, ourapproach can be used to establish a severe constraint on the maximum magneticfield at birth of nss.

1512.07151	simulated magnetic field expulsion in neutron star cores	the study of long-term evolution of neutron star (ns) magnetic fields is keyto understanding the rich diversity of ns observations, and to unifying theirnature despite the different emission mechanisms and observed properties. suchstudies in principle permit a deeper understanding of the most importantparameters driving their apparent variety, e.g. radio pulsars, magnetars, x-raydim isolated neutron stars, gamma-ray pulsars. we describe, for the first time,the results from self-consistent magneto-thermal simulations considering notonly the effects of the hall-driven field dissipation in the crust, but addinga complete set of proposed driving forces in a superconducting core. weemphasize how each of these core-field processes drive magnetic evolution andaffect observables, and show that when all forces are considered together invectorial form, the net expulsion of core magnetic flux is negligible, and willhave no observable effect in the crust (consequently in the observed surfaceemission) on megayear time-scales. our new simulations suggest that strongmagnetic fields in ns cores (and the signatures on the ns surface) will persistlong after the crustal magnetic field has evolved and decayed, due to the weakcombined effects of dissipation and expulsion in the stellar core.

astro-ph;0607614	search for radio pulsations in four anomalous x-ray pulsars and  discovery of two new pulsars	we report on observations of four southern anomalous x-ray pulsars, (1rxsj170849.0-400910, 1e 1048.1-5937, 1e 1841-045 and ax j1845-0258), obtained at1.4 ghz using the parkes radio telescope. radio pulsations from these sourceshave been searched (i) by directly folding the time series at a number of trialperiods centered on the value of the spin rate obtained from the x-rayobservations; (ii) by performing a blind search; (iii) using a code sensitiveto single dedispersed pulses, in the aim to detect signals similar to those ofthe recently discovered rotating radio transients. no evidence for radiopulsations with an upper limit of ~0.1 mjy for any of the four targets has beenfound. the blind search led to the serendipitous discovery of two new pulsars,rotating with a spin period of about 0.7 s and of 92 ms respectively, and tothe further detection of 18 known pulsars, two of which were also detected inthe single-pulse search.

astro-ph;0610594	intensity-hardness correlation and deep infrared observation of the  anomalous x-ray pulsar 1rxs j170849-400910	we report here on x-ray and ir observations of the anomalous x-ray pulsar1rxs j170849-400910. first, we report on new xmm-newton, swift-xrt and chandraobservations of this axp, which confirm the intensity-hardness correlationobserved in the long term x-ray monitoring of this source by rea et al. (2005).these new x-ray observations show that the axp flux is rising again, and thespectrum hardening. if the increase in the source intensity is indeed connectedwith the glitches and a possible bursting activity, we expect this source toenter in a bursting active phase around 2006-2007. second, we report on deep irobservations of 1rxs j170849-400910, taken with the vlt-naco adaptive optics,showing that there are many weak sources consistent with the axp position.neither star a or b, previously proposed by different authors, might yet beconclusively recognised as the ir counterpart of 1rxs j170849-400910. third,using monte carlo simulations, we re-address the calculation of thesignificance of the absorption line found in a phase-resolved spectrum of thissource by rea et al. (2003), and interpreted as a resonant scattering cyclotronfeature.

astro-ph;0610802	on the nature of the intermittent pulsar psr b1931+24	psr b1931+24 is the first intermittent radio pulsar discovered to date,characterized by a 0.8 s pulsation which turns on and off quasi-periodicallyevery ~35 days, with a duty cycle of ~10%. we present here x-ray and opticalobservations of psr b1931+24 performed with the chandra x-ray observatory andisaac newton telescope, respectively. simultaneous monitoring from the jodrellbank observatory showed that this intermittent pulsar was in the radio-on phaseduring our observations. we do not find any x-ray or optical counterpart to psrb1931+24 translating into an upper limit of ~2x10^{31} erg/s on the x-rayluminosity, and of g' &gt; 22.6 on the optical magnitude. if the pulsar isisolated, these limits cannot constrain the dim x-ray and optical emissionexpected for a pulsar of that age (~1.6 myr). we discuss the possibility thatthe quasi-periodic intermittent behavior of psr b1931+24 is due to the presenceof a low mass companion star or gaseous planet, tight with the pulsar in aneccentric orbit. in order to constrain the parameters of this putative binarysystem we re-analysed the pulsar radio timing residuals and we found that (ifindeed hosted in a binary system), psr b1931+24 should have a very low masscompanion and an orbit of low inclination.

astro-ph;0611175	the first multi-wavelength campaign of axp 4u 0142+61 from radio to hard  x-rays	for the first time a quasi-simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign has beenperformed on an anomalous x-ray pulsar from the radio to the hard x-ray band.4u 0142+61 was an integral target for 1 ms in july 2005. during theseobservations it was also observed in the x-ray band with swift and rxte, in theoptical and nir with gemini north and in the radio with the wsrt. in this paperwe present the source-energy distribution. the spectral results obtained in theindividual wave bands do not connect smoothly; apparently components ofdifferent origin contribute to the total spectrum. remarkable is that theintegral hard x-ray spectrum (power-law index 0.79 +/- 0.10) is now measured upto an energy of ~230 kev with no indication of a spectral break. extrapolationof the integral power-law spectrum to lower energies passes orders of magnitudeunderneath the nir and optical fluxes, as well as the low ~30 microjy (2 sigma)upper limit in the radio band.

0812.0014	xmm-newton discovery of 2.6 s pulsations in the soft gamma-ray repeater  sgr 1627-41	after nearly a decade of quiescence, the soft gamma-ray repeater sgr 1627-41reactivated on 2008 may 28 with a bursting episode followed by a slowlydecaying enhancement of its persistent emission. to search for the stillunknown spin period of this sgr taking advantage of its high flux state, weperformed on 2008 september 27-28 a 120 ks long x-ray observation with thexmm-newton satellite. pulsations with p = 2.594578(6) s were detected at ahigher than 6-sigma confidence level, with a double-peaked pulse profile. thepulsed fraction in the 2-12 kev range is 19% +/- 3% and 24% +/- 3% for thefundamental and the second harmonic, respectively. the observed 2-10 kev fluxis 3.4e-13 erg/cm^2/s, still a factor of ~ 5 above the quiescentpre-burst-activation level, and the spectrum is well fitted by an absorbedpower law plus blackbody model (photon index gamma = 0.6, blackbody temperaturekt = 0.5 kev, and absorption nh = 1.2e+23 cm^-2). we also detected a shell ofdiffuse soft x-ray emission which is likely associated with the young supernovaremnant g337.0-0.1.
