0903.1369	atlasgal - the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy at 870  microns	(abridged) studying continuum emission from interstellar dust is essential tolocating and characterizing the highest density regions in the interstellarmedium. in particular, the early stages of massive star formation remain poorlyunderstood. our goal is to produce a large-scale, systematic database ofmassive pre- and proto-stellar clumps in the galaxy, to understand how andunder what conditions star formation takes place. a well characterized sampleof star-forming sites will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass functionof high-mass, star-forming clumps. this systematic survey at submm wavelengthsalso represents a preparatory work for herschel and alma. the apex telescope isideally located to observe the inner milky way. the large apex bolometer camera(laboca) is a 295-element bolometer array observing at 870 microns, with a beamsize of 19". taking advantage of its large field of view (11.4') and excellentsensitivity, we started an unbiased survey of the galactic plane, with a noiselevel of 50-70 mjy/beam: the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy(atlasgal). as a first step, we covered 95 sq. deg. these data reveal 6000compact sources brighter than 0.25 jy, as well as extended structures, many ofthem filamentary. about two thirds of the compact sources have no brightinfrared counterpart, and some of them are likely to correspond to theprecursors of (high-mass) proto-stars or proto-clusters. other compact sourcesharbor hot cores, compact hii regions or young embedded clusters. assuming atypical distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller than 1 pc withmasses from a few 10 to a few 100 m_sun. in this introductory paper, we showpreliminary results from these ongoing observations, and discuss theperspectives of the survey.

0706.3583	outflow and dense gas emission from massive infrared dark clouds	infrared dark clouds are expected to harbor sources in different, very youngevolutionary stages. to better characterize these differences, we observed asample of 43 massive infrared dark clouds, originally selected as candidatehigh-mass starless cores, with the iram 30m telescope covering spectral linetracers of low-density gas, high-density gas, molecular outflows/jets andtemperature effects. the sio(2-1) observations reveal detections toward 18sources. assuming that sio is exclusively produced by sputtering from dustgrains, this implies that at least in 40% of this sample star formation ison-going. a broad range of sio line-widths is observed (between 2.2 and65km/s), and we discuss potential origins for this velocity spread. while thelow-density tracers 12co(2-1) and 13co(1-0) are detected in several velocitycomponents, the high-density tracer h13co+(1--0) generally shows only a singlevelocity component and is hence well suited for kinematic distance estimates ofirdcs. furthermore, the h13co+ line-width is on average 1.5 times larger thanthat of previously observed nh3(1,1). this is indicative of more motion at thedenser core centers, either due to turbulence or beginning star formationactivity. in addition, we detect ch3cn toward only six sources whereas ch3oh isobserved toward approximately 40% of the sample. estimates of the ch3cn andch3oh abundances are low with average values of 1.2x10^{-10} and 4.3x10^{-10},respectively. these results are consistent with chemical models at the earliestevolutionary stages of high-mass star formation. furthermore, the ch3ohabundances compare well to recently reported values for low-mass starlesscores.

0906.5493	accretion disks around massive stars: hydrodynamic structure, stability  and dust sublimation	we investigate the structure of accretion disks around massive protostarapplying steady state models of thin disks. the thin disk equations are solvedwith proper opacities for dust and gas taking into account the huge temperaturevariation along the disk. we explore a wide parameter range concerning stellarmass, accretion rate, and viscosity parameter \alpha . the most essentialfinding is a very high temperature of the inner disk. for e.g. a 10 m_sunprotostar and an accretion rate of 10^-4 m_sun/yr, the disk midplanetemperature may reach almost 10^5 k. the disk luminosity in this case is about10^4 l_sun and, thus, potentially higher than that of a massive protostar. wemotivate our disk model with similarly hot disks around compact stars. wecalculate a dust sublimation radius by turbulent disk self-heating of more than10au, a radius, which is 3 times larger than caused by stellar irradiation. wediscuss implications of this result on the flashlight effect and theconsequences for the radiation pressure of the central star. in difference todisks around low mass protostars our models suggest rather high values for thedisk turbulence parameter \alpha close to unity. however, disk stability tofragmentation due to thermal effects and gravitational instability wouldrequire a lower \alpha value. for \alpha = 0.1 we find stable disks out to80au. essentially, our model allows to compare the outer disk to some of theobserved massive protostellar disk sources, and from that, extrapolate on thedisk structure close to the star which is yet impossible to observe.

0907.2232	rotational structure and outflow in the infrared dark cloud 18223-3	we examine an infrared dark cloud (irdc) at high spatial resolution as ameans to study rotation, outflow, and infall at the onset of massive starformation. submillimeter array observations combined with iram 30 meter data in12co(2--1) reveal the outflow orientation in the irdc 18223-3 region, and pdbi3 mm observations confirm this orientation in other molecular species. theimplication of the outflow's presence is that an accretion disk is feeding it,so using high density tracers such as c18o, n2h+, and ch3oh, we looked forindications of a velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow direction.surprisingly, this gradient turns out to be most apparent in ch3oh. the largesize (28,000 au) of the flattened rotating object detected indicates that thisvelocity gradient cannot be due solely to a disk, but rather from inwardspiraling gas within which a keplerian disk likely exists. from the outflowparameters, we derive properties of the source such as an outflow dynamical ageof ~37,000 years, outflow mass of ~13 m_sun, and outflow energy of ~1.7 x 10^46erg. while the outflow mass and energy are clearly consistent with a high-massstar forming region, the outflow dynamical age indicates a slightly moreevolved evolutionary stage than previous spectral energy distribution (sed)modeling indicates. the calculated outflow properties reveal that this is trulya massive star in the making. we also present a model of the observed methanolvelocity gradient. the rotational signatures can be modeled via rotationallyinfalling gas. these data present evidence for one of the youngest knownoutflow/infall/disk systems in massive star formation. a tentative evolutionarypicture for massive disks is discussed.

0909.0691	hot high-mass accretion disk candidates	to better understand the physical properties of accretion disks in high-massstar formation, we present a study of a 12 high-mass accretion disk candidatesobserved at high spatial resolution with the australia telescope compact array(atca) in the nh3 (4,4) and (5,5) lines. almost all sources were detected innh3, directly associated with ch3oh class ii maser emission. from the remainingeleven sources, six show clear signatures of rotation and/or infall motions.these signatures vary from velocity gradients perpendicular to the outflows, toinfall signatures in absorption against ultracompact hii regions, to morespherical infall signatures in emission. although our spatial resolution is~1000au, we do not find clear keplerian signatures in any of the sources.furthermore, we also do not find flattened structures. in contrast to this, inseveral of the sources with rotational signatures, the spatial structure isapproximately spherical with sizes exceeding 10^4 au, showing considerableclumpy sub-structure at even smaller scales. this implies that on averagetypical keplerian accretion disks -- if they exist as expected -- should beconfined to regions usually smaller than 1000au. it is likely that these disksare fed by the larger-scale rotating envelope structure we observe here.furthermore, we do detect 1.25cm continuum emission in most fields of view.

0909.5256	digging into ngc 6334i(n): multiwavelength imaging of a massive  protostellar cluster	we present a high-resolution, multi-wavelength study of the massiveprotostellar cluster ngc 6334i(n) that combines new spectral line data from thesubmillimeter array (sma) and vla with a reanalysis of archival vla continuumdata, 2mass and spitzer images. as shown previously, the brightest 1.3 mmsource sma1 contains substructure at subarcsecond resolution, and we report thefirst detection of sma1b at 3.6 cm along with a new spatial component at 7 mm(sma1d). we find sma1 (aggregate of sources a, b, c, and d) and sma4 to becomprised of free-free and dust components, while sma6 shows only dustemission. our 1.5" resolution 1.3 mm molecular line images reveal substantialhot-core line emission toward sma1 and to a lesser degree sma2. we find ch3ohrotation temperatures of 165\pm 9 k and 145\pm 12 k for sma1 and sma2,respectively. we estimate a diameter of 1400 au for the sma1 hot core emission,encompassing both sma1b and sma1d, and speculate that these sources comprise a&gt;800 au separation binary that may explain the previously-suggested precessionof the outflow emanating from the sma1 region. the lsr velocities of sma1,sma2, and sma4 all differ by 1-2 km/s. outflow activity from sma1, sma2, sma4,and sma6 is observed in several molecules including sio(5--4) and irac 4.5micron emission; 24 micron emission from sma4 is also detected. eleven watermaser groups are detected, eight of which coincide with sma1, sma2, sma4, andsma6. we also detect a total of 83 class i ch3oh 44ghz maser spots which likelyresult from the combined activity of many outflows. our observations paint theportrait of multiple young hot cores in a protocluster prior to the stage whereits members become visible in the near-infrared.

0911.5648	probing the evolution of molecular cloud structure: from quiescence to  birth	aims: we derive the probability density functions (pdfs) of column densityfor a complete sample of prominent molecular cloud complexes closer than 200pc. methods: we derive near-infrared dust extinction maps for 23 molecularcloud complexes, using the "nicest" colour excess mapping technique and datafrom the 2mass archive. the extinction maps are then used to examine the columndensity pdfs in the clouds. results: the column density pdfs of most molecularclouds are well-fitted by log-normal functions at low column densities (0.5 mag&lt; a_v &lt; 3-5 mag). however, at higher column densities prominent, power-law-likewings are common. in particular, we identify a trend among the pdfs: activestar-forming clouds always have prominent non-log-normal wings. in contrast,clouds without active star formation resemble log-normals over the wholeobserved column density range, or show only low excess of higher columndensities. this trend is also reflected in the cumulative pdfs, showing thatthe fraction of high column density material is significantly larger instar-forming clouds. these observations are in agreement with an evolutionarytrend where turbulent motions are the main cloud-shaping mechanism forquiescent clouds, but the density enhancements induced by them quickly becomedominated by gravity (and other mechanisms) which is strongly reflected by theshape of the column density pdfs. the dominant role of the turbulence isrestricted to the very early stages of molecular cloud evolution, comparable tothe onset of active star formation in the clouds.

0707.2904	the 10^5lsun high-mass protostellar object iras23151+5912	while most sources above 10^5lsun have already formed an ultracompact hiiregion (uchii), this is not necessarily the case for sources of lowerluminosity. characterizing sources in the transition phase, i.e., very luminousobjects without any detectable free-free emission, is important for a generalunderstanding of massive star formation. therefore, we observed the luminoushigh-mass protostellar object iras23151+5912 with the submillimeter array at875mum in the submm continuum and spectral line emission at sub-arcsecondresolution. the 875mum submm continuum emission has been resolved into at leasttwo condensations. the previously believed driving source of one of theoutflows, the infrared source irs1, is ~0.9'' offset from the main submm peak.over the entire 4ghz bandwidth we detect an intermediate dense spectral lineforest with 27 lines from 8 different species, isotopologues orvibrationally-torsionally excited states. temperature estimates based on thech3oh line series result in values of t(peak1)~150+-50k and t(peak2)~80~30k forthe two submm peak positions, respectively. the sio(8-7) red- and blue-shiftedline maps indicate the presence of two molecular outflows. in contrast, thevibrationally-torsionally excited ch3oh line exhibits a velocity gradientapproximately perpendicular to one of the outflows. with a size ofapproximately 5000au and no keplerian rotation signature, this structure doesnot resemble a genuine accretion disk but rather a larger-scale rotating toroidthat may harbor a more common accretion disk at its so far unresolved center.

1002.2571	sequential star formation in rcw 34: a spectroscopic census of the  stellar content of high-mass star-forming regions	we present vlt/sinfoni integral field spectroscopy of rcw 34 along withspitzer/irac photometry of the surroundings. rcw 34 consists of three differentregions. a large bubble has been detected on the irac images in which a clusterof intermediate- and low-mass class ii objects is found. at the northern edgeof this bubble, an hii region is located, ionized by 3 ob stars. intermediatemass stars (2 - 3 msun) are detected of g- and k- spectral type. these starsare still in the pre-main sequence (pms) phase. north of the hii region, aphoton-dominated region is present, marking the edge of a dense molecular cloudtraced by h2 emission. several class 0/i objects are associated with thiscloud, indicating that star formation is still taking place. the distance torcw 34 is revised to 2.5 +- 0.2 kpc and an age estimate of 2 - 1 myrs isderived from the properties of the pms stars inside the hii region. the mostlikely scenario for the formation of the three regions is that star formationpropagates from south to north. first the bubble is formed, produced byintermediate- and low-mass stars only, after that, the hii region is formedfrom a dense core at the edge of the molecular cloud, resulting in theexpansion as a champagne flow. more recently, star formation occurred in therest of the molecular cloud. two different formation scenarios are possible:(a) the bubble with the cluster of low- and intermediate mass stars triggeredthe formation of the o star at the edge of the molecular cloud which in turninduces the current star-formation in the molecular cloud. (b) an externaltriggering is responsible for the star-formation propagating from south tonorth. [abridged]

1012.0961	chemistry in infrared dark clouds	massive stars play an important role in shaping the structure of galaxies.infrared dark clouds (irdcs), with their low temperatures and high densities,have been identified as the potential birthplaces of massive stars. in order tounderstand the formation processes of massive stars the physical and chemicalconditions in infrared dark clouds have to be characterized. the goal of thispaper is to investigate the chemical composition of a sample of southerninfrared dark clouds. one important aspect of the observations is to check, ifthe molecular abuncances in irdcs are similar to the low-mass pre-stellarcores, or whether they show signatures of more evolved evolutionary stages. weperformed observations toward 15 irdcs in the frequency range between 86 and 93ghz using the 22-m mopra radio telescope. we detect hnc, hco$^+$ and hncemission in all clouds and n$_2$h$^+$ in all irdcs except one. in some cloudswe detect sio emission. complicated shapes of the hco$^+$ emission line profileare found in all irdcs. both signatures indicates the presence of infall andoutflow motions and beginning of star formation activity, at least in someparts of the irdcs. where possible, we calculate molecular abundances and makea comparison with previously obtained values for low-mass pre-stellar cores andhigh-mass protostellar objects (hmpos). we show a tendency for irdcs to havemolecular abundances similar to low-mass pre-stellar cores rather than to hmposabundances on the scale of our single-dish observations.

1104.0678	probing the evolution of molecular cloud structure ii: from chaos to  confinement	we present an analysis of the large-scale molecular cloud structure and ofthe stability of clumpy structures in nearby molecular clouds. in our recentwork, we identified a structural transition in molecular clouds by studying theprobability distributions of gas column densities in them. in this paper, wefurther examine the nature of this transition. the transition takes place atthe visual extinction of a_v^tail = 2-4 mag, or equivalently, at \sigma^tail =40-80 ms pc^{-2}. the clumps identified above this limit have wide ranges ofmasses and sizes, but a remarkably constant mean volume density of n = 10^3cm^{-3}. this is 5-10 times larger than the density of the medium surroundingthe clumps. by examining the stability of the clumps, we show that they aregravitationally unbound entities, and that the external pressure from theparental molecular cloud is a significant source of confining pressure forthem. then, the structural transition at a_v^tail may be linked to a transitionbetween this population and the surrounding medium. the star formation rates inthe clouds correlate strongly with the total mass in the clumps, i.e, with themass above a_v^tail, dropping abruptly below that threshold. these resultsimply that the formation of pressure confined clumps introduces a prerequisitefor star formation. furthermore, they give a physically motivated explanationfor the recently reported relation between the star formation rates and theamount of dense material in molecular clouds. likewise, they give rise to anatural threshold for star formation at a_v^tail.

1109.6017	mass reservoirs surrounding massive infrared dark clouds: a view by  near-infrared dust extinction	context: infrared dark clouds (irdcs) harbor progenitors of high-mass stars.little is known of the parental molecular clouds of the irdcs. aims: wedemonstrate the feasibility of the near-infrared (nir) dust extinction mappingin tracing the parental molecular clouds of irdcs at the distances of d = 2.5 -8 kpc. methods: we derive nir extinction maps for 10 prominent irdc complexesusing a color-excess mapping technique and nir data from the ukidss/galacticplane survey. we compare the resulting maps to the 13co emission line data, tothe 8 \mu m dust opacity data, and to the millimeter dust emission data. wederive distances for the clouds by comparing the observed nir source densitiesto the besancon stellar distribution model and compare them to the kinematicdistance estimates. results: the nir extinction maps provide a view to the irdccomplexes over the dynamical range of av = 2 - 40 mag, in spatial resolution of30". the nir extinction data correlate well with the 13co data and probe asimilar gas component, but also extend to higher column densities. the nir datareveal a wealth of extended structures surrounding the dense gas traced by the8 \mu m shadowing features and sub-mm dust emission, showing that the cloudscontain typically &gt; 10 times more mass than traced by those tracers. the irdccomplexes of our sample contain relatively high amount of high-column densitymaterial, and their cumulative column density distributions resemble activenearby star-forming clouds like orion rather than less active clouds likecalifornia. conclusions: nir dust extinction data provide a new powerful toolto probe the mass distribution of the parental molecular clouds of irdcs up tothe distances of d = 8 kpc. this encourages for deeper nir observations ofirdcs, because the sensitivity and resolution of the data can be directlyenhanced with dedicated observations.

(aims)from a sample of 45 high mass star forming regions in three phases ofevolution, we investigate the presence of established infall and outflowtracers to determine whether there are any trends attributable to the age ofthe source. (methods) we obtained jcmt observations of hco+/h13co+ j=4-3 totrace large scale infall, and sio j=8-7 to trace recent outflow activity. wecompare the infall and outflow detections to the evolutionary stage of the hostsource (high mass protostellar objects, hypercompact hii regions andultracompact hii regions). we also note that the integrated intensity of siovaries with the full width at half maximum of the h13co+. (results) we find asurprising lack of sio detections in the middle stage (hypercompact hiiregions), which may be due to an observational bias. when sio is detected, wefind that the integrated intensity of the line increases with evolutionarystage. we also note that all of the sources with infall signatures ontoultracompact hii regions have corresponding outflow signatures as well.

1112.3543	the onset of high-mass star formation in the direct vicinity of the  galactic mini-starburst w43	context: the earliest stages of high-mass star formation are still poorlycharacterized. it is also unknown whether the initial conditions vary withenvironment. aims: we want to investigate the youngest massive gas clumps inthe environment of extremely active star formation. methods: we selected theirdc18454 complex associated with the w43 galactic mini-starburst, and observedit in the continuum emission between 70mu and 1.2mm, and in spectral lineemission of n2h+ and 13co with single-dish instruments and an interferometer.results: the multi-wavelength continuum study allows us to identify clumps thatare infrared dark even at 70mu and hence the best candidates to be genuinehigh-mass starless gas clumps. the spectral energy distributions revealelevated temperatures and luminosities compared to more quiescent environments.furthermore, we identify a temperature gradient from the w43 mini-starbursttoward the starless clumps. we discuss whether the radiation impact of thenearby mini-starburst changes the fragmentation properties of the gas clumpsand by that maybe favors more high-mass star formation in such an environment.the spectral line data reveal two different velocity components of the gas at100 and 50km/s. while chance projection is a possibility to explain thesecomponents, the projected associations of the emission sources as well as theprominent location at the galactic bar -- spiral arm interface also allow thepossibility that these two components may be spatially associated and eveninteracting. conclusions: high-mass starless gas clumps can exist in the closeenvironment of very active star formation without being destroyed. the impactof the active star formation sites may even allow for more high-mass stars toform in these 2nd generation gas clumps.

0710.4238	multi-line (sub)millimetre observations of the high-mass proto cluster  iras 05358+3543	since most high- and intermediate-mass protostars are at great distance andform in clusters, high linear resolution observations are needed to investigatetheir physical properties. to study the gas in the innermost region around theprotostars in the proto-cluster iras 05358+3543, we observed the source inseveral transitions of methanol and other molecular species with the plateau debure interferometer and the submillimeter array, reaching a linear resolutionof 1100 au. we determine the kinetic temperature of the gas around theprotostars through an lvg and lte analysis of their molecular emission; thecolumn densities of ch3oh, ch3cn and so2 are also derived. constrains on thedensity of the gas are estimated for two of the protostellar cores. we findthat the dust condensations are in various evolutionary stages. the powerhouseof the cluster, mm1a, harbours a hot core with t~220 (75&lt;t&lt;330) k. adouble-peaked profile is detected in several transitions toward mm1a, and wefound a velocity gradient along a linear structure which could be perpendicularto one of the outflows from the vicinity of mm1a. since the size of thedouble-peaked emission is less than 1100 au, we suggest that mm1a might host amassive circumstellar disk. the other sources are in earlier stages of starformation. the least active source, mm3, could be a starless massive core,since it is cold (t&lt;20 k), with a large reservoir of accreting material (m ~ 19m_\odot), but no molecular emission peaks on it.

1203.5786	multiple episodes of star formation in the cn15/16/17 molecular complex	we have started a campaign to identify massive star clusters inside brightmolecular bubbles towards the galactic center. the cn15/16/17 molecular complexis the first example of our study. the region is characterized by the presenceof two young clusters, db10 and db11, visible in the nir, an ultra-compact hiiregion identified in the radio, several young stellar objects visible in themir, a bright diffuse nebulosity at 8\mu m coming from pahs and sub-mmcontinuum emission revealing the presence of cold dust. given its position onthe sky (l=0.58, b=-0.85) and its kinematic distance of ~7.5 kpc, the regionwas thought to be a very massive site of star formation in proximity of thecmz. the cluster db11 was estimated to be as massive as 10^4 m_sun. however theregion's properties were known only through photometry and its kinematicdistance was very uncertain given its location at the tangential point. weaimed at better characterizing the region and assess whether it could be a siteof massive star formation located close to the galactic center. we haveobtained ntt/sofi jhks photometry and long slit k band spectroscopy of thebrightest members. we have additionally collected data in the radio, sub-mm andmid infrared, resulting in a quite different picture of the region. we haveconfirmed the presence of massive early b type stars and have derived aspectro-photometric distance of ~1.2 kpc, much smaller than the kinematicdistance. adopting this distance we obtain clusters masses of m(db10) ~ 170m_sun and m(db11) ~ 275 m_sun. this is consistent with the absence of any ostar, confirmed by the excitation/ionization status of the nebula. no heidiffuse emission is detected in our spectroscopic observations at 2.113\mu m,which would be expected if the region was hosting more massive stars. radiocontinuum measurements are also consistent with the region hosting at mostearly b stars.

1301.1498	the earliest phases of star formation - a herschel key project. the  thermal structure of low-mass molecular cloud cores	the temperature and density structure of molecular cloud cores are the mostimportant physical quantities that determine the course of the protostellarcollapse and the properties of the stars they form. nevertheless, densityprofiles often rely either on the simplifying assumption of isothermality or onobservationally poorly constrained model temperature profiles. with the aim ofbetter constraining the initial physical conditions in molecular cloud cores atthe onset of protostellar collapse, we initiated the guaranteed time keyproject (gtkp) "the earliest phases of star formation" (epos) with the herschelsatellite. this paper gives an overview of the low-mass sources in the eposproject, including all observations, the analysis method, and the initialresults of the survey. we study the thermal dust emission of 12 previouslywell-characterized, isolated, nearby globules using fir and submm continuummaps at up to eight wavelengths between 100 micron and 1.2 mm. our samplecontains both globules with starless cores and embedded protostars at differentearly evolutionary stages. the dust emission maps are used to extract spatiallyresolved seds, which are then fit independently with modified blackbody curvesto obtain line-of-sight-averaged dust temperature and column density maps. wefind that the thermal structure of all globules is dominated by externalheating from the interstellar radiation field and moderate shielding by thinextended halos. all globules have warm outer envelopes (14-20 k) and colderdense interiors (8-12 k). the protostars embedded in some of the globules raisethe local temperature of the dense cores only within radii out to about 5000au, but do not significantly affect the overall thermal balance of theglobules.

1309.1018	fragmentation, infall, and outflow around the showcase massive protostar  ngc7538 irs1 at 500 au resolution	aims: revealing the fragmentation, infall, and outflow processes in theimmediate environment around massive young stellar objects is crucial forunderstanding the formation of the most massive stars. methods: with this goalin mind we present the so far highest spatial-resolution thermal submm line andcontinuum observations toward the young high-mass protostar ngc7538 irs1. usingthe plateau de bure interferometer in its most extended configuration at 843mumwavelength, we achieved a spatial resolution of 0.2"x0.17", corresponding to~500au at a distance of 2.7\,kpc. results: for the first time, we have observedthe fragmentation of the dense inner core of this region with at least threesubsources within the inner 3000 au. the outflow exhibits blue- and red-shiftedemission on both sides of the central source indicating that the currentorientation has to be close to the line-of-sight, which differs from otherrecent models. we observe rotational signatures in northeast-southwestdirection; however, even on scales of 500 au, we do not identify any keplerianrotation signatures. this implies that during the early evolutionary stages anystable keplerian inner disk has to be very small (&lt;=500 au). the high-energyline hcn(4-3)v2=1 (e_u/k=1050k) is detected over an extent of approximately3000 au. in addition to this, the detection of red-shifted absorption from thisline toward the central dust continuum peak position allows us to estimateinfall rates of ~1.8x10^(-3)msun/yr on the smallest spatial scales. althoughall that gas will not necessarily be accreted onto the central protostar,nevertheless, such inner core infall rates are among the best proxies of theactual accretion rates one can derive during the early embedded star formationphase. these data are consistent with collapse simulations and the observedhigh multiplicity of massive stars.

1310.7621	deep near-infrared imaging of w3 main: constraints on stellar cluster  formation	embedded clusters like w3 main are complex and dynamically evolving systemsthat represent an important phase of the star formation process. we aim at thecharacterization of the entire stellar content of w3 main in a statisticalsense to identify possible differences in evolutionary phase of the stellarpopulations and find clues about the formation mechanism of this massiveembedded cluster. methods. deep jhks imaging is used to derive the diskfraction, ks-band luminosity functions and mass functions for severalsubregions in w3 main. a two dimensional completeness analysis using artificialstar experiments is applied as a crucial ingredient to assess realisticcompleteness limits for our photometry. we find an overall disk fraction of 7.7$\pm$ 2.3%, radially varying from 9.4 $\pm$ 3.0 % in the central 1 pc to 5.6$\pm$ 2.2 % in the outer parts of w3 main. the mass functions derived for threesubregions are consistent with a kroupa and chabrier mass function. the massfunction of irsn3 is complete down to 0.14 msun and shows a break at m $\sim$0.5 msun. we interpret the higher disk fraction in the center as evidence for ayounger age of the cluster center. we find that the evolutionary sequenceobserved in the low-mass stellar population is consistent with the observed agespread among the massive stars. an analysis of the mass function variationsdoes not show evidence for mass segregation. w3 main is currently stillactively forming stars, showing that the ionizing feedback of ob stars isconfined to small areas ($\sim$ 0.5 pc). the fuv feedback might be influencinglarge regions of the cluster as suggested by the low overall disk fraction.

1312.0937	the atlasgal survey: a catalog of dust condensations in the galactic  plane	the formation processes and the evolutionary stages of high-mass stars arepoorly understood compared to low-mass stars. large-scale surveys are needed toprovide an unbiased census of high column density sites which can potentiallyhost precursors to high-mass stars. here we use the atlasgal survey covering420 sq. degree of the galactic plane at 870 $\mu$m; and use the mre-glc methodto identify the population of embedded sources throughout the inner galaxy. weidentify in total 10861 compact sub-millimeter sources with fluxes above 5sigma. completeness tests show that our catalogue is 97% complete above 5 sigmaand &gt;99% complete above 7$\sigma$. we correlate this sample with mid-infraredpoint source catalogues (msx at 21.3 $\mu$m and wise at 22 $\mu$m) anddetermine a lower limit of ~33% that are associated with embedded protostellarobjects. we note that the proportion of clumps associated with mid-infraredsources increases with increasing flux density, achieving a rather constantfraction of ~75% of all clumps with fluxes over 5 jy/beam being associated withstar-formation. examining the source counts as a function of galactic longitudewe are able to identify the most prominent star forming regions in the galaxy.from the fraction of the likely massive quiescent clumps (~25%) we estimate aformation time-scale of ~7.5+/-2.5 $\times$ 10$^4$yr for the deeply embeddedphase before the emergence of luminous ysos. such a short duration for theformation of high-mass stars in massive clumps clearly proves that the earliestphases have to be dynamic with supersonic motions.

1401.6382	chemical evolution in the early phases of massive star formation. i	understanding the chemical evolution of young (high-mass) star-formingregions is a central topic in star formation research. chemistry is employed asa unique tool 1) to investigate the underlying physical processes and 2) tocharacterize the evolution of the chemical composition. we observed a sample of59 high-mass star-forming regions at different evolutionary stages varying fromthe early starless phase of infrared dark clouds to high-mass protostellarobjects to hot molecular cores and, finally, ultra-compact hii regions at 1mmand 3mm with the iram 30m telescope. we determined their large-scale chemicalabundances and found that the chemical composition evolves along with theevolutionary stages. on average, the molecular abundances increase with time.we modeled the chemical evolution, using a 1d physical model where density andtemperature vary from stage to stage coupled with an advanced gas-grainchemical model and derived the best-fit chi^2 values of all relevantparameters. a satisfying overall agreement between observed and modeled columndensities for most of the molecules was obtained. with the best-fit model wealso derived a chemical age for each stage, which gives the timescales for thetransformation between two consecutive stages. the best-fit chemical ages are~10,000 years for the irdc stage, ~60,000 years for the hmpo stage, ~40,000years for the hmc stage, and ~10,000 years for the uchii stage. the totalchemical timescale for the entire evolutionary sequence of the high-mass starformation process is on the order of 10^5 years, which is consistent withtheoretical estimates. furthermore, based on the approach of a multiple-linesurvey of unresolved data, we were able to constrain an intuitive andreasonable physical and chemical model. the results of this study can be usedas chemical templates for the different evolutionary stages in high-mass starformation.

1404.4404	the formation of the w43 complex: constraining its atomic-to-molecular  transition and searching for colliding clouds	numerical simulations have explored the possibility to form molecular cloudsthrough either a quasi-static, self-gravitating mechanism or the collision ofgas streams or lower-density clouds. they also quantitatively predict thedistribution of matter at the transition from atomic to molecular gases. we aimto observationally test these models by studying the environment of w43, amolecular cloud complex near the tip of the galactic long bar. usinggalaxy-wide hi and 12co surveys we searched for gas flowing toward the w43molecular cloud complex. we also estimated the hi and h2 mass surface densitiesto constrain the transition from atomic to molecular gas around and within w43.we found 3 cloud ensembles within the position-velocity diagrams of 12co and higases. they are separated by 20km/s along the line of sight and extend into the13co velocity structure of w43. since their velocity gradients are consistentwith free-fall, they could be nearby clouds attracted by, and streaming toward,the w43 10^7msun potential well. we show that the hi surface density,sigma_hi=45-85msun/pc2, does not reach any threshold level but increases whenentering the 130pc-wide molecular complex previously defined. this suggeststhat an equilibrium between h2 formation and photodissociation has not yet beenreached. the h2-to-hi ratio measured over the w43 region and its surroundings,r_h2~3.5, is high, indicating that most of the gas is already in molecular formin w43 and in structures several hundreds of parsecs downstream along thescutum-centaurus arm. the w43 molecular cloud complex may have formed, and infact may still be accreting mass from the agglomeration of clouds. already inthe molecular-dominated regime, most of these clouds are streaming from thescutum-centaurus arm. this is in clear disagreement with quasi-static andsteady-state models of molecular cloud formation.

1503.06594	chemical evolution in the early phases of massive star formation ii:  deuteration	the chemical evolution in high-mass star-forming regions is still poorlyconstrained. studying the evolution of deuterated molecules allows todifferentiate between subsequent stages of high-mass star formation regions dueto the strong temperature dependence of deuterium isotopic fractionation. weobserved a sample of 59 sources including 19 infrared dark clouds, 20 high-massprotostellar objects, 11 hot molecular cores and 9 ultra-compact hii regions inthe (3-2) transitions of the four deuterated molecules, dcn, dnc, dco+ and n2d+as well as their non-deuterated counterpart. the overall detection fraction ofdcn, dnc and dco+ is high and exceeds 50% for most of the stages. n2d+ was onlydetected in a few infrared dark clouds and high-mass protostellar objects. itcan be related to problems in the bandpass at the frequency of the transitionand to low abundances in the more evolved, warmer stages. we find median d/hratios of ~0.02 for dcn, ~0.005 for dnc, ~0.0025 for dco+ and ~0.02 for n2d+.while the d/h ratios of dnc, dco+ and n2d+ decrease with time, dcn/hcn peaks atthe hot molecular core stage. we only found weak correlations of the d/h ratiosfor n2d+ with the luminosity of the central source and the fwhm of the line,and no correlation with the h2 column density. in combination with a previouslyobserved set of 14 other molecules (paper i) we fitted the calculated columndensities with an elaborate 1d physico-chemical model with time-dependentd-chemistry including ortho- and para-h2 states. good overall fits to theobserved data have been obtained the model. it is one of the first times thatobservations and modeling have been combined to derive chemically basedbest-fit models for the evolution of high-mass star formation includingdeuteration.

1510.07063	filament fragmentation in high-mass star formation	aims: we resolve the length-scales for filament formation and fragmentation(res. &lt;=0.1pc), in particular the jeans length and cylinder fragmentationscale.  methods: we observed the prototypical high-mass star-forming filamentirdc18223 with the plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi) in the 3.2mm continuumand n2h+(1-0) line emission in a ten field mosaic at a spatial resolution of~4'' (~14000au).  results: the dust continuum emission resolves the filament into a chain of atleast 12 relatively regularly spaced cores. the mean separation between coresis ~0.40(+-0.18)pc. while this is approximately consistent with thefragmentation of an infinite, isothermal, gravitationally bound gas cylinder, ahigh mass-to-length ratio of m/l~1000m_sun/pc requires additional turbulentand/or magnetic support against radial collapse of the filament. the n2h+(1-0)data reveal a velocity gradient perpendicular to the main filament. althoughrotation of the filament cannot be excluded, the data are also consistent withthe main filament being comprised of several velocity-coherent sub-filaments.furthermore, this velocity gradient perpendicular to the filament resemblesrecent results toward serpens south that are interpreted as signatures offilament formation within magnetized and turbulent sheet-like structures.lower-density gas tracers ([ci] and c18o) reveal a similar red/blueshiftedvelocity structure on scales around 60'' east and west of the irdc18223filament. this may tentatively be interpreted as a signature of the large-scalecloud and the smaller-scale filament being kinematically coupled. we do notidentify a velocity gradient along the axis of the filament. this may either bedue to no significant gas flows along the filamentary axis, but it may partlyalso be caused by a low inclination angle of the filament with respect to theplane of the sky that could minimize such signature.

1511.05138	atlasgal-selected massive clumps in the inner galaxy, ii:  characterisation of different evolutionary stages and their sio emission	the processes leading to the birth of high-mass stars are poorly understood.we characterise here a sample of 430 massive clumps from the atlasgal survey,which are representative of different evolutionary stages. to establish acensus of molecular tracers of their evolution we performed an unbiasedspectral line survey covering the 3-mm atmospheric window between 84-117 ghzwith the iram 30m. a smaller sample of 128 clumps has been observed in the sio(5-4) transition with the apex telescope to complement the sio (2-1) line andprobe the excitation conditions of the emitting gas, which is the main focus ofthe current study. we report a high detection rate of &gt;75% of the sio (2-1)line and a &gt;90% detection rate from the dedicated follow-ups in the (5-4)transition. the sio (2-1) line with broad line profiles and high detectionrates, is a powerful probe of star formation activity, while the ubiquitousdetection of sio in all evolutionary stages suggests a continuous starformation process in massive clumps. we find a large fraction of infrared-quietclumps to exhibit sio emission, the majority of them only showing alow-velocity component (fwhm~5-6 km/s) centred at the rest velocity of theclump. in the current picture, where this is attributed to low-velocity shocksfrom cloud-cloud collisions, this can be used to pinpoint the youngest, thus,likely prestellar massive structures. based on the line ratio of the (5-4) tothe (2-1) line, our study reveals a trend of changing excitation conditionsthat lead to brighter emission in the (5-4) line towards more evolved sources.our analysis delivers a more robust estimate of sio column density andabundance than previous studies and questions the decrease of jet activity inmassive clumps as a function of age.

1511.07145	the atlasgal survey: distribution of cold dust in the galactic plane.  combination with planck data	sensitive ground-based submillimeter surveys, such as atlasgal, provide aglobal view on the distribution of cold dense gas in the galactic plane. herewe use the 353 ghz maps from the planck/hfi instrument to complement theground-based apex/laboca observations with information on larger angularscales. the resulting maps reveal the distribution of cold dust in the innergalaxy with a larger spatial dynamic range. we find examples of elongatedstructures extending over angular scales of 0.5 degree. corresponding to &gt;30 pcstructures in projection at a distance of 3 kpc, these dust lanes are veryextended and show large aspect ratios. furthermore, we assess the fraction ofdense gas ($f_{\rm dg}$), and estimate 2-5% (above a$_{\rm{v}}&gt;$7 mag) onaverage in the galactic plane. pdfs of the column density reveal the typicallyobserved log-normal distribution for low- and exhibit an excess at high columndensities. as a reference for extragalactic studies, we show the line-of-sightintegrated n-pdf of the inner galaxy, and derive a contribution of this excessto the total column density of $\sim2.2$%, above $n_{\rm h_2} =2.92\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. taking the total flux density, we provide anindependent estimate of the mass of molecular gas in the inner galaxy of$\sim1\times10^9\,m_{\odot}$, which is consistent with previous estimates usingco emission. from the mass and $f_{\rm dg}$ we estimate a galactic sfr of $\dotm = 1.3\,m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. while the distribution of diffuse gas ishomogenous in the inner galaxy, the cmz stands out with a higher dense gasfraction. the low star formation efficiency of the milky way is well explainedby the low $f_{\rm dg}$ in the galactic ism, while the high $f_{\rm dg}$towards the cmz, despite its low star formation activity, suggests that, inthat particular region of our galaxy, high-density gas is not the bottleneckfor star formation.

astro-ph;0110370	high-mass proto-stellar candidates - ii : density structure from dust  continuum and cs emission	we present a detailed 1.2 mm continuum and cs spectral line study of a largesample of 69 massive star forming regions in very early stages of evolution,most of them prior to building up an ultracompact hii region. the continuumdata show a zoo of different morphologies and give detailed information on thespatial distributions, the masses, column densities and average densities ofthe whole sample. fitting the radial intensity profiles shows that threeparameters are needed to describe the spatial distribution of the sources:constant emission from the center out to a few arcsec radius followed by afirst power law intensity distribution which steepens further outside into asecond power law distribution. the mean inner power law intensity index mi(i~r^(-mi)) is 1.2 corresponding to density indices p (n~r^(-p)) of 1.6. intotal the density distribution of our massive star formations sites seem to benot too different from their low-mass counterparts, but we show that settingtight constrains on the density indices is very difficult and subject to manypossible errors. the local densities we derive from cs calculations are higher(up to one order of magnitude) than the mean densities we find via themm-continuum. such inhomogeneous density distribution reflects most likely theubiquitous phenomenon of clumping and fragmentation in molecular clouds.linewidth-mass relations show a departure from virial equilibrium in the stagesof strongly collapsing cores.

astro-ph;0404458	search for calibrators for the submillimeter array: i. high-mass star  forming regions	we present initial results of an ongoing search for interferometriccalibrators at submillimeter (sub-mm) wavelengths with the submillimeter array(sma). powerful radio galaxies are commonly used as calibrators at centimeterand millimeter wavelengths, but many are not strong enough to serve ascalibrators at sub-mm wavelengths because of their rapidly declining fluxdensities toward shorter wavelengths. the inability to find a calibrator closeto the target source may limit or even prevent us from imaging many interestingsources at sub-mm wavelengths. here, we investigate whether high-massprotostellar objects and ultracompact hii regions can serve as usefulcalibrators for the sma. the dust emission associated with these objects makesthem among the brightest sub-mm sources in the sky. our observations at 0.85 mm(345 ghz) with an angular resolution of ~3" reveal that although a largefraction of the dust emission originates from an extended ``halo'' component, acompact unresolved component often remains that when sufficiently strong mayserve as a useful calibrator. these observations also provide a first glimpseat the small-scale distribution of dust around ultracompact hii regions andhigh-mass protostellar objects at sub-mm wavelengths. we discuss the origin ofthe core-halo structure seen in many sources, and conclude with suggestions forfuture searches for calibrators with the sma.

astro-ph;0701185	the protostar in the massive infrared dark cloud irdc18223-3	at the onset of high-mass star formation, accreting protostars are deeplyembedded in massive cores made of gas and dust. their spectral energydistribution is still dominated by the cold dust and rises steeply from near-tofar-infrared wavelengths. the young massive star-forming region irdc18223-3 isa prototypical infrared-dark-cloud with a compact mm continuum core that showsno protostellar emission below 8mum. however, based on outflow tracers, earlystar formation activity was previously inferred for this region. here, wepresent recent spitzer observations from the mipsgal survey that identify thecentral protostellar object for the first time at 24 and 70mum. combining themid- to far-infrared data with previous mm continuum observations and the upperlimits below 8mum, one can infer physical properties of the central source. atleast two components with constant gas mass m and dust temperature t arenecessary: one cold component (~15k and ~576m_sun) that contains most of themass and luminosity, and one warmer component (&gt;=51k and &gt;=0.01m_sun) toexplain the 24mum data. the integrated luminosity of ~177l_sun can be used toconstrain additional parameters of the embedded protostar from the turbulentcore accretion model for massive star formation. the data of irdc18223-3 areconsistent with a massive gas core harboring a low-mass protostellar seed ofstill less than half a solar mass with high accretion rates of the order10^-4m_sun/yr. in the framework of this model, the embedded protostar isdestined to become a massive star at the end of its formation processes.

astro-ph;0702190	hot ammonia in ngc6334i &amp; i(n)	aims: the massive twin cores ngc6334i and i(n) are in different evolutionarystages and hence ideal targets to study evolutionary variations within the samelarger-scale environment. here, we study the warm, compact gas components.methods: we imaged the two regions with the australia telescope compact array(atca) at high angular resolution in the nh3(3,3) to (6,6) inversion lines.results: compact emission is detected toward both regions in all observedinversion lines with energy levels up to 407k above ground. this isparticularly surprising for ngc6334i(n) since it lacks bright infrared emissionand is considered a massive cold core at an early evolutionary stage. highoptical depth and multiply-peaked line profiles complicate rotation temperatureestimates, and we can only conclude that gas components with temperatures &gt;100kare present in both regions. toward ngc6334i, we confirm previous reports ofnh3(3,3) maser emission toward the outflow bow-shocks. furthermore, we reportthe first detection of an nh3(6,6) maser toward the central region of ngc6334i.this maser is centered on the second millimeter (mm) peak and elongated alongthe outflow axis, indicating that this mm continuum core harbors the drivingsource of the molecular outflow. toward the main mm peak in ngc6334i(n), wedetect a double-horn line profile in the nh3(6,6) transition. the current datado not allow us to differentiate whether this double-horn profile is producedby multiple gas components along the line of sight, or whether it may trace apotential underlying massive accretion disk. the data to figures 3 to 7 arealso available in electronic form at the cds via anonymous ftp tocdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or viahttp://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?j/a+a/.

astro-ph;0702560	interferometric multi-wavelength (sub)millimeter continuum study of the  young high-mass protocluster iras05358+3543	the young massive star-forming region iras05358+3543 was observed athigh-spatial resolution in the continuum emission at 3.1 and 1.2mm with theplateau de bure interferometer, and at 875 and 438mum with the submillimeterarray. we resolve at least four continuum sub-sources that are likely ofprotostellar nature. two of them are potentially part of a proto-binary systemwith a projected separation of 1700au. additional (sub)mm continuum peaks arenot necessarily harboring protostars but maybe caused by the multiple molecularoutflows. the spectral energy distributions (seds) of the sub-sources showseveral features. the main power house mm1, which is associated with ch3ohmaser emission, a hypercompact hii region and a mid-infrared source, exhibits atypical sed with a free-free emission component at cm and long mm wavelengthsand a cold dust component in the (sub)mm part of the spectrum (spectral indexbetween 1.2mm and 438mum alpha~3.6). the free-free emission corresponds to alyman continuum flux of an embedded 13msun b1 star. the coldest source of theregion, mm3, has alpha~3.7 between 1.2mm and 875mum, but has lower thanexpected fluxes in the shorter wavelength 438mum band. this turnover of theplanck-function sets an upper limit on the dust temperature of mm3 ofapproximately 20k. the uv-data analysis of the density structure of individualsub-cores reveals distributions with power-law indices between 1.5 and 2. thisresembles the density distributions of the larger-scale cluster-forming clumpas well as those from typical low-mass cores.

0810.5637	chemical diversity in high-mass star formation	massive star formation exhibits an extremely rich chemistry. however, notmuch evolutionary details are known yet, especially at high spatial resolution.therefore, we synthesize previously published submillimeter arrayhigh-spatial-resolution spectral line observations toward four regions ofhigh-mass star formation that are in various evolutionary stages with a rangeof luminosities. estimating column densities and comparing the spatiallyresolved molecular emission allows us to characterize the chemical evolution inmore detail. furthermore, we model the chemical evolution of massive warmmolecular cores to be directly compared with the data. the four regions revealmany different characteristics. while some of them, e.g., the detection rate ofch3oh, can be explained by variations of the average gas temperatures, otherfeatures are attributed to chemical effects. for example, c34s is observedmainly at the core-edges and not toward their centers because oftemperature-selective desorption and successive gas-phase chemistry reactions.most nitrogen-bearing molecules are only found toward the hot molecular coresand not the earlier evolutionary stages, indicating that the formation andexcitation of such complex nitrogen-bearing molecules needs significant heatingand time to be fully developed. furthermore, we discuss the observationaldifficulties to study massive accretion disks in the young deeply embeddedphase of massive star formation. the general potential and limitations of suchkind of dataset are discussed, and future directions are outlined. the analysisand modeling of this source sample reveals many interesting features toward achemical evolutionary sequence. however, it is only an early step, and manyobservational and theoretical challenges in that field lie ahead.
