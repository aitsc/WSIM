0902.2599	exploring dark energy with next-generation photometric redshift surveys	the coming decade will be an exciting period for dark energy research, duringwhich astronomers will address the question of what drives the acceleratedcosmic expansion as first revealed by type ia supernova (sn) distances, andconfirmed by later observations.  the mystery of dark energy poses a challenge of such magnitude that, asstated by the dark energy task force (detf), "nothing short of a revolution inour understanding of fundamental physics will be required to achieve a fullunderstanding of the cosmic acceleration." the lack of multiple complementaryprecision observations is a major obstacle in developing lines of attack fordark energy theory. this lack is precisely what next-generation surveys willaddress via the powerful techniques of weak lensing (wl) and baryon acousticoscillations (bao) -- galaxy correlations more generally -- in addition to sne,cluster counts, and other probes of geometry and growth of structure. becauseof their unprecedented statistical power, these surveys demand an accurateunderstanding of the observables and tight control of systematics.  this white paper highlights the opportunities, approaches, prospects, andchallenges relevant to dark energy studies with wide-deep multiwavelengthphotometric redshift surveys. quantitative predictions are presented for a20000 sq. deg. ground-based 6-band (ugrizy) survey with 5-sigma depth ofr~27.5, i.e., a stage 4 survey as defined by the detf.

0908.0945	results of the great08 challenge: an image analysis competition for  cosmological lensing	we present the results of the great08 challenge, a blind analysis challengeto infer weak gravitational lensing shear distortions from images. the primarygoal was to stimulate new ideas by presenting the problem to researchersoutside the shear measurement community. six great08 team methods werepresented at the launch of the challenge and five additional groups submittedresults during the 6 month competition. participants analyzed 30 millionsimulated galaxies with a range in signal to noise ratio, point-spread functionellipticity, galaxy size, and galaxy type. the large quantity of simulationsallowed shear measurement methods to be assessed at a level of accuracysuitable for currently planned future cosmic shear observations for the firsttime. different methods perform well in different parts of simulation parameterspace and come close to the target level of accuracy in several of these. anumber of fresh ideas have emerged as a result of the challenge including are-examination of the process of combining information from different galaxies,which reduces the dependence on realistic galaxy modelling. the imagesimulations will become increasingly sophisticated in future great challenges,meanwhile the great08 simulations remain as a benchmark for additionaldevelopments in shear measurement algorithms.

0911.2260	testing adiabatic contraction with sdss elliptical galaxies	we study the profiles of 75 086 elliptical galaxies from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) at both large (50-500 kpc/h) and small (~3 kpc/h) scales.weak lensing observations in the outskirts of the halo are combined withmeasurements of the stellar velocity dispersion in the interior regions of thegalaxy for stacked galaxy samples. the weak lensing measurements are wellcharacterized by a navarro, frenk and white (nfw) profile. the dynamical massmeasurements exceed the extrapolated nfw profile even after the estimatedstellar masses are subtracted, providing evidence for the modification of thedark matter profile by the baryons. this excess mass is quantitativelyconsistent with the predictions of the adiabatic contraction (ac) hypothesis.our finding suggests that the effects of ac during galaxy formation are stableto subsequent bombardment from major and minor mergers. we explore severaltheoretical and observational systematics and conclude that they cannot accountfor the inferred mass excess. the most significant source of systematic erroris in the imf, which would have to increase the stellar mass estimates by afactor of two relative to masses from the kroupa imf to fully explain the massexcess without ac. such an increase would create tension with results fromsauron (cappellari et al. 2006). we demonstrate a connection between the levelof contraction of the dark matter halo profile and scatter in thesize-luminosity relation, which is a projection of the fundamental plane.whether or not ac is the mechanism supplying the excess mass, models of galaxyformation and evolution must reconcile the observed halo masses from weaklensing with the comparatively large dynamical masses at the half light radiiof the galaxies.

0911.4972	precision cluster mass determination from weak lensing	weak gravitational lensing has been used extensively in the past decade toconstrain the masses of galaxy clusters, and is the most promisingobservational technique for providing the mass calibration necessary forprecision cosmology with clusters. there are several challenges in estimatingcluster masses, particularly (a) the sensitivity to astrophysical effects andobservational systematics that modify the signal relative to the theoreticalexpectations, and (b) biases that can arise due to assumptions in the massestimation method, such as the assumed radial profile of the cluster. all ofthese challenges are more problematic in the inner regions of the cluster,suggesting that their influence would ideally be suppressed for the purpose ofmass estimation. however, at any given radius the differential surface densitymeasured by lensing is sensitive to all mass within that radius, and thecorrupted signal from the inner parts is spread out to all scales. we develop anew statistic that is ideal for estimation of cluster masses because itcompletely eliminates mass contributions below a chosen scale (which we suggestshould be about 20 per cent of the virial radius), and thus reduces sensitivityto systematic and astrophysical effects. we use simulated and analyticalprofiles to quantify systematic biases on the estimated masses for severalstandard methods of mass estimation, finding that these can lead to significantmass biases that range from ten to over fifty per cent. the mass uncertaintieswhen using our new statistic are reduced by up to a factor of ten relative tothe standard methods, while only moderately increasing the statistical errors.this new method of mass estimation will enable a higher level of precision infuture science work with weak lensing mass estimates for galaxy clusters.

0911.4973	an algorithm for the direct reconstruction of the dark matter  correlation function from weak lensing and galaxy clustering	the clustering of matter on cosmological scales is an essential probe forstudying the physical origin and composition of our universe. to date, most ofthe direct studies have focused on shear-shear weak lensing correlations, butit is also possible to extract the dark matter clustering by combininggalaxy-clustering and galaxy-galaxy-lensing measurements. in this study wedevelop a method that can constrain the dark matter correlation function fromgalaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy-lensing measurements, by focusing on thecorrelation coefficient between the galaxy and matter overdensity fields. togenerate a mock galaxy catalogue for testing purposes, we use the halooccupation distribution approach applied to a large ensemble of n-bodysimulations to model pre-existing sdss luminous red galaxy sample observations.using this mock catalogue, we show that a direct comparison between the excesssurface mass density measured by lensing and its corresponding galaxyclustering quantity is not optimal. we develop a new statistic that suppressesthe small-scale contributions to these observations and show that this newstatistic leads to a cross-correlation coefficient that is within a few percentof unity down to 5 mpc/h. furthermore, the residual incoherence between thegalaxy and matter fields can be explained using a theoretical model forscale-dependent bias, giving us a final estimator that is unbiased to within1%. we also perform a comprehensive study of other physical effects that canaffect the analysis, such as redshift space distortions and differences inradial windows between galaxy clustering and weak lensing observations. weapply the method to a range of cosmological models and show the viability ofour new statistic to distinguish between cosmological models.

0911.5347	the wigglez dark energy survey: direct constraints on blue galaxy  intrinsic alignments at intermediate redshifts	correlations between the intrinsic shapes of galaxy pairs, and between theintrinsic shapes of galaxies and the large-scale density field, may be inducedby tidal fields. these correlations, which have been detected at low redshifts(z&lt;0.35) for bright red galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), andfor which upper limits exist for blue galaxies at z~0.1, provide a window intogalaxy formation and evolution, and are also an important contaminant forcurrent and future weak lensing surveys. measurements of these alignments atintermediate redshifts (z~0.6) that are more relevant for cosmic shearobservations are very important for understanding the origin and redshiftevolution of these alignments, and for minimising their impact on weak lensingmeasurements. we present the first such intermediate-redshift measurement forblue galaxies, using galaxy shape measurements from sdss and spectroscopicredshifts from the wigglez dark energy survey. our null detection allows us toplace upper limits on the contamination of weak lensing measurements by bluegalaxy intrinsic alignments that, for the first time, do not requiresignificant model-dependent extrapolation from the z~0.1 sdss observations.also, combining the sdss and wigglez constraints gives us a long redshiftbaseline with which to constrain intrinsic alignment models and contaminationof the cosmic shear power spectrum. assuming that the alignments can beexplained by linear alignment with the smoothed local density field, we findthat a measurement of \sigma_8 in a blue-galaxy dominated, cfhtls-like surveywould be contaminated by at most +/-0.02 (95% confidence level, sdss andwigglez) or +/-0.03 (wigglez alone) due to intrinsic alignments.

1003.2185	confirmation of general relativity on large scales from weak lensing and  galaxy velocities	although general relativity underlies modern cosmology, its applicability oncosmological length scales has yet to be stringently tested. such a test hasrecently been proposed, using a quantity, eg, that combines measures oflarge-scale gravitational lensing, galaxy clustering and structure growth rate.the combination is insensitive to 'galaxy bias' (the difference between theclustering of visible galaxies and invisible dark matter) and is thus robust tothe uncertainty in this parameter. modified theories of gravity generallypredict values of eg different from the general relativistic predictionbecause, in these theories, the 'gravitational slip' (the difference betweenthe two potentials that describe perturbations in the gravitational metric) isnon-zero, which leads to changes in the growth of structure and the strength ofthe gravitational lensing effect3. here we report that eg = 0.39 +/- 0.06 onlength scales of tens of megaparsecs, in agreement with the generalrelativistic prediction of eg $\approx$ 0.4. the measured value excludes amodel within the tensor-vector-scalar gravity theory, which modifies bothnewtonian and einstein gravity. however, the relatively large uncertainty stillpermits models within f(r) theory, which is an extension of general relativity.a fivefold decrease in uncertainty is needed to rule out these models.

1107.4629	precision simulation of ground-based lensing data using observations  from space	current and upcoming wide-field, ground-based, broad-band imaging surveyspromise to address a wide range of outstanding problems in galaxy formation andcosmology. several such uses of ground-based data, especially weakgravitational lensing, require highly precise measurements of galaxy imagestatistics with careful correction for the effects of the point-spread function(psf). in this paper, we introduce the shera (shear reconvolution analysis)software to simulate ground-based imaging data with realistic galaxymorphologies and observing conditions, starting from space-based data (fromcosmos, the cosmological evolution survey) and accounting for the effects ofthe space-based psf. this code simulates ground-based data, optionally with aweak lensing shear applied, in a model-independent way using a general fourierspace formalism. the utility of this pipeline is that it allows for a precise,realistic assessment of systematic errors due to the method of data processing,for example in extracting weak lensing galaxy shape measurements or galaxyradial profiles, given user-supplied observational conditions and real galaxymorphologies. moreover, the simulations allow for the empirical test of errorestimates and determination of parameter degeneracies, via generation of manynoise maps. the public release of this software, along with a large sample ofcleaned cosmos galaxy images (corrected for charge transfer inefficiency),should enable upcoming ground-based imaging surveys to achieve their potentialin the areas of precision weak lensing analysis, galaxy profile measurement,and other applications involving detailed image analysis.

1109.5192	photometric redshift probability distributions for galaxies in the sdss  dr8	we present redshift probability distributions for galaxies in the sdss dr8imaging data. we used the nearest-neighbor weighting algorithm presented inlima et al. 2008 and cunha et al. 2009 to derive the ensemble redshiftdistribution n(z), and individual redshift probability distributions p(z) forgalaxies with r &lt; 21.8. as part of this technique, we calculated weights for aset of training galaxies with known redshifts such that their densitydistribution in five dimensional color-magnitude space was proportional to thatof the photometry-only sample, producing a nearly fair sample in that space. wethen estimated the ensemble n(z) of the photometric sample by constructing aweighted histogram of the training set redshifts. we derived p(z) s forindividual objects using the same technique, but limiting to training setobjects from the local color-magnitude space around each photometric object.using the p(z) for each galaxy, rather than an ensemble n(z), can reduce thestatistical error in measurements that depend on the redshifts of individualgalaxies. the spectroscopic training sample is substantially larger than thatused for the dr7 release, and the newly added primus catalog is now the mostimportant training set used in this analysis by a wide margin. we expect theprimary source of error in the n(z) reconstruction is sample variance: thetraining sets are drawn from relatively small volumes of space. usingsimulations we estimated the uncertainty in n(z) at a given redshift is 10-15%.the uncertainty on calculations incorporating n(z) or p(z) depends on how theyare used; we discuss the case of weak lensing measurements. the p(z) catalog ispublicly available from the sdss website.

1204.2264	separating intrinsic alignment and galaxy-galaxy lensing	the coherent physical alignment of galaxies is an important systematic forgravitational lensing studies as well as a probe of the physical mechanismsinvolved in galaxy formation and evolution. we develop a formalism for treatingthis intrinsic alignment (ia) in the context of galaxy-galaxy lensing andpresent an improved method for measuring ia contamination, which can arise whensources physically associated with the lens are placed behind the lens due tophotometric redshift scatter. we apply the technique to recent sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) measurements of luminous red galaxy lenses and typical (l*)source galaxies with photometric redshifts selected from the sdss imaging data.compared to previous measurements, this method has the advantage of being fullyself-consistent in its treatment of the ia and lensing signals, solving for thetwo simultaneously. we find an ia signal consistent with zero, placing tightconstraints on both the magnitude of the ia effect and its potentialcontamination to the lensing signal. while these constraints depend on sourceselection and redshift quality, the method can be applied to any measurementthat uses photometric redshifts. we obtain a model-independent upper-limit ofroughly 10% ia contamination for projected separations of approximately 0.1-100mpc/h. with more stringent photo-z cuts and reasonable assumptions about thephysics of intrinsic alignments, this upper limit is reduced to 1-2%. theselimits are well below the statistical error of the current lensingmeasurements. our results suggest that ia will not present intractablechallenges to the next generation of galaxy-galaxy lensing experiments, and themethods presented here should continue to aid in our understanding of alignmentprocesses and in the removal of ia from the lensing signal.

1207.1120	cosmological parameter constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy  clustering with the sdss dr7	recent studies have shown that the cross-correlation coefficient betweengalaxies and dark matter is very close to unity on scales outside a few virialradii of galaxy halos, independent of the details of how galaxies populate darkmatter halos. this finding makes it possible to determine the dark matterclustering from measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxyclustering. we present new cosmological parameter constraints based onlarge-scale measurements of spectroscopic galaxy samples from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7). we generalise the approach of baldaufet al. (2010) to remove small scale information (below 2 and 4 mpc/h forlensing and clustering measurements, respectively), where the cross-correlationcoefficient differs from unity. we derive constraints for three galaxy samplescovering 7131 sq. deg., containing 69150, 62150, and 35088 galaxies with meanredshifts of 0.11, 0.28, and 0.40. we clearly detect scale-dependent galaxybias for the more luminous galaxy samples, at a level consistent withtheoretical expectations. when we vary both \sigma_8 and \omega_m (andmarginalise over non-linear galaxy bias) in a flat lcdm model, thebest-constrained quantity is \sigma_8 (\omega_m/0.25)^{0.57}=0.80 +/- 0.05(1-sigma, stat. + sys.), where statistical and systematic errors havecomparable contributions, and we fixed n_s=0.96 and h=0.7. these strongconstraints on the matter clustering suggest that this method is competitivewith cosmic shear in current data, while having very complementary and in someways less serious systematics. we therefore expect that this method will play aprominent role in future weak lensing surveys. when we combine these data withwmap7 cmb data, constraints on \sigma_8, \omega_m, h_0, w_{de} and \sum m_{\nu}become 30--80 per cent tighter than with cmb data alone, since our data breakseveral parameter degeneracies.

1209.4643	subaru weak-lensing measurement of a z = 0.81 cluster discovered by the  atacama cosmology telescope survey	we present a subaru weak lensing measurement of act-cl j0022.2-0036, one ofthe most luminous, high-redshift (z=0.81) sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) clustersdiscovered in the 268 deg^2 equatorial region survey of the atacama cosmologytelescope. for the weak lensing analysis using i'-band images, we use amodel-fitting (gauss-laguerre shapelet) method to measure shapes of galaxyimages, where we fit galaxy images in different exposures simultaneously toobtain best-fit ellipticities taking into account the different psfs in eachexposure. we also take into account the astrometric distortion effect on galaxyimages by performing the model fitting in the world coordinate system. toselect background galaxies behind the cluster at z=0.81, we use photometricredshift (photo-z) estimates for every galaxy derived from the co-added imagesof multi-passband br'i'z'y, with psf matching/homogenization. after a photo-zcut for background galaxy selection, we detect the tangential weak lensingdistortion signal with a total signal-to-noise ratio of about 3.7. by fitting anavarro-frenk-white model to the measured shear profile, we find the clustermass to be m_200\bar{\rho}_m = [7.5^+3.2_-2.8(stat.)^+1.3_-0.6(sys.)] x 10^14m_\odot/h. the weak lensing-derived mass is consistent with previous massestimates based on the sz observation, with assumptions of hydrostaticequilibrium and virial theorem, as well as with scaling relations between szsignal and mass derived from weak lensing, x-ray, and velocity dispersion,within the measurement errors. we also show that the existence of act-clj0022.2-0036 at z=0.81 is consistent with the cluster abundance prediction ofthe \lambda-dominated cold dark matter structure formation model. we thusdemonstrate the capability of subaru-type ground-based images for studying weaklensing of high-redshift clusters.

(2012) to use complimentaryobservations to directly constrain this effect on the data. we use catalogs ofluminous red galaxies (lrgs) and photometric galaxies from the sdss dr7 tomeasure the redshift-space power spectrum of lrgs, the cross-correlation oflrgs with the shapes of background photometric galaxies (galaxy-galaxy weaklensing), and the projected cross-correlation of lrgs with photometric galaxieshaving similar photometric redshifts to the lrg spectroscopic redshift. all ofthese measurements use a reconstructed halo field. while we use the position ofeach lrg for single lrg systems, we compare the measurements using differenthalo-center proxies for multiple-lrg systems (4.5 per cent of all the halos):the brightest lrg position (blrg), the faintest lrg position (flrg) and theirarithmetical mean position (mean), respectively, in each system. we findsignificant differences in the measured correlations of different centers,showing consistent off-centering effects in the three observables. by comparingthe measurements with a halo model that treats the satellite photometricgalaxies as being distributed according to a generalized nfw profile, we findthat about 40 (70) per cent of blrgs (flrgs) are off-centered satellitegalaxies in the multiple-lrg systems. the satellite lrgs have typicaloff-centering radius of about 400 kpc/h, and velocity dispersion of about 500km/s in host halos with a mean mass of 1.6x10^14 ms/h. we show that, if lrgs inthe single lrg systems have similar offsets, the residual fog contamination inthe lrg power spectrum can be significant at k&gt;0.1 h/mpc, which may cause abias in cosmological parameters such as the neutrino mass.

1304.0455	a highly elongated prominent lens at z=0.87: first strong lensing  analysis of el gordo	we present the first strong-lensing (sl) analysis of the galaxy clusteract-cl j0102-4915 (\emph{el gordo}), in recent \emph{hst}/acs images, revealinga prominent strong lens at a redshift of $z=0.87$. this finding adds to thealready-established unique properties of \emph{el gordo}: it is the mostmassive, hot, x-ray luminous, and bright sunyaev-zeldovich effect cluster at$z\gtrsim0.6$, and the only `bullet'-like merging cluster known at theseredshifts. the lens consists of two merging massive clumps, where for a sourceredshift of $z_{s}\sim2$ each clump exhibits only a small, separate criticalarea, with a total area of $0.69\pm0.11\sq\arcmin$ over the two clumps. for ahigher source redshift, $z_{s}\sim4$, the critical curves of the two clumpsmerge together into one bigger and very elongated lens (axis ratio$\simeq5.5$), enclosing an effective area of $1.44\pm0.22\sq\arcmin$. thecritical curves continue expanding with increasing redshift so that forhigh-redshift sources ($z_{s}\gtrsim9$) they enclose an area of$\sim1.91\pm0.30\sq\arcmin$ (effective $\theta_{e}\simeq46.8\pm3.7\arcsec$) anda mass of $6.09\pm1.04\times10^{14}m_{\odot}$. according to our model, the areaof high magnification ($\mu&gt;10$) for such high redshift sources is$\simeq1.2\sq\arcmin$, and the area with $\mu&gt;5$ is $\simeq2.3\sq\arcmin$,making \emph{el gordo} a compelling target for studying the high-redshiftuniverse. we obtain a strong lower limit on the total mass of \emph{el gordo},$\gtrsim1.7\times10^{15}m_{\odot}$ from the sl regime alone, suggesting a totalmass of, roughly, $m_{200}\sim2.3\times10^{15}m_{\odot}$. our results should berevisited when additional spectroscopic and \emph{hst} imaging data areavailable.

1406.4908	background sky obscuration by cluster galaxies as a source of systematic  error for weak lensing	lensing magnification and stacked shear measurements of galaxy clusters relyon measuring the density of background galaxies behind the clusters. the mostcommon ways of measuring this quantity ignore the fact that some fraction ofthe sky is obscured by the cluster galaxies themselves, reducing the area inwhich background galaxies can be observed. we discuss the size of this effectin the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the canada-france-hawaii telescopelensing survey (cfhtlens), finding a minimum 1 per cent effect at$0.1h^{-1}$mpc from the centers of clusters in sdss; the effect is an order ofmagnitude higher in cfhtlens. the resulting biases on cluster mass andconcentration measurements are of the same order as the size of the obscurationeffect, which is below the statistical errors for cluster lensing in sdss butlikely exceeds them for cfhtlens. we also forecast the impact of thissystematic error on cluster mass and magnification measurements in severalupcoming surveys, and find that it typically exceeds the statistical errors. weconclude that future surveys must account for this effect in stacked lensingand magnification measurements in order to avoid being dominated by systematicerror.

1407.4813	intrinsic alignments of group and cluster galaxies in photometric  surveys	intrinsic alignments of galaxies have been shown to contaminate weakgravitational lensing observables on linear scales, $r&gt;$ 10 $h^{-1}$mpc, butstudies of alignments in the non-linear regime have thus far been inconclusive.we present an estimator for extracting the intrinsic alignment signal ofgalaxies around stacked clusters of galaxies from multiband imaging data. ourestimator removes the contamination caused by galaxies that are gravitationallylensed by the clusters and scattered in redshift space due to photometricredshift uncertainties. it uses posterior probability distributions for theredshifts of the galaxies in the sample and it is easily extended to obtain theweak gravitational lensing signal while removing the intrinsic alignmentcontamination. we apply this algorithm to groups and clusters of galaxiesidentified in the sloan digital sky survey `stripe 82' coadded imaging dataover $\sim 150$ deg$^2$. we find that the intrinsic alignment signal aroundstacked clusters in the redshift range $0.1&lt;z&lt;0.4$ is consistent with zero. interms of the tidal alignment model of catelan et al.

1409.7297	intrinsic alignments of galaxies in the massiveblack-ii simulation:  analysis of two-point statistics	the intrinsic alignment of galaxies with the large-scale density field is animportant astrophysical contaminant in upcoming weak lensing surveys. wepresent detailed measurements of the galaxy intrinsic alignments and associatedellipticity-direction (ed) and projected shape ($w_{g+}$) correlation functionsfor galaxies in the cosmological hydrodynamic massiveblack-ii (mb-ii)simulation. we carefully assess the effects on galaxy shapes, misalignment ofthe stellar component with the dark matter shape and two-point statistics ofiterative weighted (by mass and luminosity) definitions of the (reduced andunreduced) inertia tensor. we find that iterative procedures must be adoptedfor a reliable measurement of the reduced tensor but that luminosity versusmass weighting has only negligible effects. both ed and $w_{g+}$ correlationsincrease in amplitude with subhalo mass (in the range of $10^{10} - 6.0\times10^{14}h^{-1}m_{\odot}$), with a weak redshift dependence (from $z=1$ to$z=0.06$) at fixed mass. at $z \sim 0.3$, we predict a $w_{g+}$ that is inreasonable agreement with sdss lrg measurements and that decreases in amplitudeby a factor of $\sim 5$--18 for galaxies in the lsst survey. we also comparedthe intrinsic alignments of centrals and satellites, with clear detection ofsatellite radial alignments within their host halos. finally, we show that$w_{g+}$ (using subhalos as tracers of density) and $w_{\delta+}$ (using darkmatter density) predictions from the simulations agree with that of non-linearalignment models (nla) at scales where the 2-halo term dominates in thecorrelations (and tabulate associated nla fitting parameters). the 1-halo terminduces a scale dependent bias at small scales which is not modeled in the nlamodel.

1411.1755	intrinsic alignments of sdss-iii boss lowz sample galaxies	intrinsic alignments (ia) of galaxies, i.e. correlations of galaxy shapeswith each other or with the density field, are a major astrophysical source ofcontamination for weak lensing surveys. we present the results of iameasurements of galaxies on 0.1- 200 mpc/h scales using the sdss-iii boss lowzsample, in the redshift range 0.16&lt;z&lt;0.36. we extend the existing iameasurements for spectroscopic lrgs to lower luminosities, and show that theluminosity dependence of large-scale ia can be well-described by a power law.within the limited redshift and color range of our sample, we observe nosignificant redshift or color dependence of ia. we measure the halo mass oflowz galaxies using galaxy-galaxy lensing, and show that the mass dependence oflarge-scale ia is also well described by a power law. we detect variation inthe scale dependence of ia with mass and luminosity, which underscores the needto use flexible templates in order to remove the ia signal. we also study theenvironment dependence of ia by splitting the sample into field and groupgalaxies, which are further split into satellite and central galaxies. we showthat group central galaxies are aligned with their halos at small scales andalso are aligned with the tidal fields out to large scales. we also detect theradial alignments of satellite galaxies within groups, which results in a nulldetection of large-scale intrinsic alignments for satellites. these results canbe used to construct better intrinsic alignment models for removal of thiscontaminant to the weak lensing signal.

1412.1094	the impact of cosmic variance on simulating weak lensing surveys	upcoming weak lensing surveys will survey large cosmological volumes tomeasure the growth of cosmological structure with time and thereby constraindark energy. one major systematic uncertainty in this process is thecalibration of the weak lensing shape distortions, or shears. most upcomingsurveys plan to test several aspects of their shear estimation algorithms usingsophisticated image simulations that include realistic galaxy populations basedon high-resolution data from the hubble space telescope (hst). however,existing datasets from the (hst) cover very small cosmological volumes, socosmic variance could cause the galaxy populations in them to be atypical. anarrow redshift slice from such surveys could be dominated by a single largeoverdensity or underdensity. in that case, the morphology-density relationcould alter the local galaxy populations and yield an incorrect calibration ofshear estimates as a function of redshift. we directly test this scenario usingthe cosmos survey, the largest-area (hst) survey to date, and show how thestatistical distributions of galaxy shapes and morphological parameters (e.g.,s\'{e}rsic $n$) are influenced by redshift-dependent cosmic variance. thetypical variation in rms ellipticity due to environmental effects is 5 per cent(absolute, not relative) for redshift bins of width $\delta z=0.05$, whichcould result in uncertain shear calibration at the 1 per cent level. weconclude that the cosmic variance effects are large enough to exceed thesystematic error budget of future surveys, but can be mitigated with carefulchoice of training dataset and sufficiently large redshift binning.

1502.01024	weak lensing calibration of mass bias in the reflex+bcs x-ray galaxy  cluster catalogue	the use of large, x-ray selected galaxy cluster catalogues for cosmologicalanalyses requires a thorough understanding of the x-ray mass estimates.%,including the possibility of biases due to the assumption of hydrostaticequilibrium. weak gravitational lensing is an ideal method to shed light onsuch issues, due to its insensitivity to the cluster dynamical state. weperform a weak lensing calibration of 166 galaxy clusters from the reflex andbcs cluster catalogue and compare our results to the x-ray masses based onscaled luminosities from that catalogue. to interpret the weak lensing signalin terms of cluster masses, we compare the lensing signal to simple theoreticalnavarro-frenk-white models and to simulated cluster lensing profiles, includingcomplications such as cluster substructure, projected large-scale structure,and eddington bias. we find evidence of underestimation in the x-ray masses, asexpected, with $\langle m_{\mathrm{x}}/m_{\mathrm{wl}}\rangle =0.78_{-0.08}^{+0.1}$ for our best-fit model. the biases in cosmologicalparameters in a typical cluster abundance measurement that ignores this massbias will typically exceed the statistical errors.

1504.02662	detection of spatial correlations of fundamental plane residuals, and  cosmological implications	the fundamental plane (fp) is a widely used tool to investigate theproperties of early-type galaxies, and the tight relation between itsparameters has spawned several cosmological applications, including its use asa distance indicator for peculiar velocity surveys and as a means to suppressintrinsic noise in cosmic size magnification measurements. systematic trendswith the large-scale structure across the fp could cause serious biases forthese cosmological probes, but may also yield new insights into the early-typepopulation. here we report the first detection of spatial correlations amongoffsets in galaxy size from an fp that explicitly accounts for redshift trends,using a sample of about $95,000$ elliptical galaxies from the sloan digital skysurvey. we show that these offsets correlate with the density field out to atleast $10h^{-1}$mpc at $4\sigma$ significance in a way that cannot be explainedby systematic errors in galaxy size estimates. we propose a physicalexplanation for the correlations by dividing the sample into central,satellite, and field galaxies, identifying trends for each galaxy typeseparately. central (satellite) galaxies lie on average above (below) the fp,which we argue could be due to a higher (lower) than average mass-to-lightratio. we fit a simple model to the correlations of fp residuals and use it topredict the impact on peculiar velocity power spectra, finding a contaminationlarger than $10\,\%$ for $k&gt;0.04\,h/$mpc. moreover, cosmic magnificationmeasurements based on an fp could be severely contaminated over a wide range ofscales by the intrinsic fp correlations.

1505.02781	mapping stellar content to dark matter halos using galaxy clustering and  galaxy-galaxy lensing in the sdss dr7	the mapping between the distributions of the observed galaxy stellar mass andthe underlying dark matter halos provides the crucial link from theories oflarge-scale structure formation to interpreting the complex phenomena of galaxyformation and evolution. we develop a novel statistical method, based on thehalo occupation distribution model (hod), to solve for this mapping by jointlyfitting the galaxy clustering and the galaxy-galaxy lensing measured from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). the method, called the ihod model, extractsmaximum information from the survey by including ~80% more galaxies than thetraditional hod methods, and takes into account the incompleteness of thestellar mass samples in a statistically consistent manner. the derivedstellar-to-halo mass relation not only explains the clustering and lensing ofsdss galaxies over almost four decades in stellar mass, but also successfullypredicts the stellar mass functions observed in sdss. due to its capability ofmodelling significantly more galaxies, the ihod is able to break the degeneracybetween the logarithmic scatter in the stellar mass at fixed halo mass and theslope of the stellar-to-halo mass relation at high mass end, without the needto assume a strong prior on the scatter and/or use the stellar mass function asan input. we detect a decline of the scatter with halo mass, from 0.22 dex atbelow 10^{12} msun to 0.18 dex at 10^{14} msun. the model also enablesstringent constraints on the satellite stellar mass functions at fixed halomass, predicting a departure from the schechter functional form in high masshalos. the ihod model can be easily applied to existing and futurespectroscopic datasets, greatly improving the statistical constraint on thestellar-to-halo mass relation compared to the traditional hod methods withinthe same survey.

1505.03124	galaxy shapes and alignments in the massiveblack-ii hydrodynamic and  dark matter-only simulations	we compare the shapes and intrinsic alignments of galaxies in themassiveblack-ii cosmological hydrodynamic simulation (mbii) to those in a darkmatter-only (dmo) simulation performed with the same volume(100$h^{-1}$mpc)$^{3}$, cosmological parameters, and initial conditions.understanding the impact of baryonic physics on galaxy shapes and alignmentsand their relation to the dark matter distribution should prove useful to mapthe intrinsic alignments of galaxies from hydrodynamic to dark matter-onlysimulations. we find that dark matter subhalos are typically rounder in mbii,and the shapes of stellar matter in low mass galaxies are more misaligned withthe shapes of the dark matter of the corresponding subhalos in the dmosimulation. at $z=0.06$, the fractional difference in the mean misalignmentangle between mbii and dmo simulations varies from $\sim 28 \% - 12 \%$ in themass range $10^{10.8} - 6.0 \times 10^{14} h^{-1}m_{\odot}$. we study the darkmatter halo shapes and alignments as a function of radius, and find that whilegalaxies in mbii are more aligned with the inner parts of their dark mattersubhalos, there is no radial trend in their alignments with the correspondingsubhalo in the dmo simulation. this result highlights the importance ofbaryonic physics in determining the alignment of the galaxy with respect to theinner parts of the halo. finally, we compare the ellipticity-direction (ed)correlation for galaxies to that for dark matter halos, finding that it issuppressed on all scales by stellar-dark matter misalignment. in the projectedshape-density correlation ($w_{\delta+}$), which includes ellipticityweighting, this effect is partially canceled by the higher mean ellipticitiesof the stellar component, but differences of order $30-40\%$ remain on scales$&gt; 1$ mpc over a range of subhalo masses, with scale-dependent effects below$1$ mpc.

0805.2552	halo mass - concentration relation from weak lensing	we perform a statistical weak lensing analysis of dark matter profiles aroundtracers of halo mass from galactic- to cluster-size halos. in this analysis weuse 170,640 isolated ~l* galaxies split into ellipticals and spirals, 38,236groups traced by isolated spectroscopic luminous red galaxies (lrgs) and 13,823maxbcg clusters from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) covering a wide rangeof richness. together these three samples allow a determination of the densityprofiles of dark matter halos over three orders of magnitude in mass, from10^{12} m_{sun} to 10^{15} m_{sun}. the resulting lensing signal is consistentwith an nfw or einasto profile on scales outside the central region. we findthat the nfw concentration parameter c_{200b} decreases with halo mass, fromaround 10 for galactic halos to 4 for cluster halos. assuming its dependence onhalo mass in the form of c_{200b} = c_0 [m/(10^{14}m_{sun}/h)]^{\beta}, we findc_0=4.6 +/- 0.7 (at z=0.22) and \beta=0.13 +/- 0.07, with very similar resultsfor the einasto profile. the slope (\beta) is in agreement with theoreticalpredictions, while the amplitude is about two standard deviations below thepredictions for this mass and redshift, but we note that the published valuesin the literature differ at a level of 10-20% and that for a proper comparisonour analysis should be repeated in simulations. we discuss the implications ofour results for the baryonic effects on the shear power spectrum: since theseare expected to increase the halo concentration, the fact that we see noevidence of high concentrations on scales above 20% of the virial radiussuggests that baryonic effects are limited to small scales, and are not asignificant source of uncertainty for the current weak lensing measurements ofthe dark matter power spectrum.

1509.05784	a weak gravitational lensing recalibration of the scaling relations  linking the gas properties of dark halos to their mass	we use weak gravitational lensing to measure mean mass profiles aroundlocally brightest galaxies (lbgs). these are selected from the sdss/dr7spectroscopic and photometric catalogues to be brighter than any neighbourprojected within 1.0 mpc and differing in redshift by $&lt;1000$ km/s. most ($&gt;83\%$) are expected to be the central galaxies of their dark matter halos.previous stacking analyses have used this lbg sample to measure meansunyaev-zeldovich flux and mean x-ray luminosity as a function of lbg stellarmass. in both cases, a simulation of the formation of the galaxy population wasused to estimate effective halo mass for lbgs of given stellar mass, allowingthe derivation of scaling relations between the gas properties of halos andtheir mass. by comparing results from a variety of simulations to our lensingdata, we show that this procedure has significant model dependence reflecting:(i) the failure of any given simulation to reproduce observed galaxy abundancesexactly; (ii) a dependence on the cosmology underlying the simulation; and(iii) a dependence on the details of how galaxies populate halos. we use ourlensing results to recalibrate the scaling relations, eliminating most of thismodel dependence and explicitly accounting both for residual modellinguncertainties and for observational uncertainties in the lensing results. theresulting scaling relations link the mean gas properties of dark halos to theirmass over an unprecedentedly wide range, $10^{12.5}&lt;m_{500}/\mathrm{m_\odot}&lt;10^{14.5}$, and should fairly and robustly represent the fullhalo population.

1509.06376	detecting effects of filaments on galaxy properties in the sloan digital  sky survey iii	we study the effects of filaments on galaxy properties in the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) data release 12 using filaments from the `cosmic webreconstruction' catalogue (chen et al. 2015a), a publicly available filamentcatalogue for sdss. since filaments are tracers of medium-to-high densityregions, we expect that galaxy properties associated with the environment aredependent on the distance to the nearest filament. our analysis demonstrates ared galaxy or a high-mass galaxy tend to reside closer to filaments than a blueor low-mass galaxy. after adjusting the effect from stellar mass, on average,late-forming galaxies or large galaxies have a shorter distance to filamentsthan early-forming galaxies or small galaxies. for the main galaxy sample, allsignals are very significant ($&gt; 5\sigma$). for the lowz and cmass samples,most of the signals are significant (with $&gt; 3\sigma$). the filament effects weobserve persist until z = 0.7 (the edge of the cmass sample). comparing ourresults to those using the galaxy distances from redmapper galaxy clusters as areference, we find a similar result between filaments and clusters. ourfindings illustrate the strong correlation of galaxy properties with proximityto density ridges, strongly supporting the claim that density ridges are goodtracers of filaments.

1509.06758	mapping stellar content to dark matter halos. ii. halo mass is the main  driver of galaxy quenching	we develop a simple yet comprehensive method to distinguish the underlyingdrivers of galaxy quenching, using the clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing ofred and blue galaxies in sdss. building on the ihod framework developed by zu &amp;mandelbaum (2015a), we consider two quenching scenarios: 1) a "halo" quenchingmodel in which halo mass is the sole driver for turning off star formation inboth centrals and satellites; and 2) a "hybrid" quenching model in which thequenched fraction of galaxies depends on their stellar mass while the satellitequenching has an extra dependence on halo mass. the two best-fit modelsdescribe the red galaxy clustering and lensing equally well, but halo quenchingprovides significantly better fits to the blue galaxies above $10^{11}m_\odot/h^2$. the halo quenching model also correctly predicts the average halomass of the red and blue centrals, showing excellent agreement with the directweak lensing measurements of locally brightest galaxies. models in whichquenching is not tied to halo mass, including an age-matching model in whichgalaxy colour depends on halo age at fixed $m_*$, fail to reproduce theobserved halo mass for massive blue centrals. we find similar critical halomasses responsible for the quenching of centrals and satellites(~$1.5\times10^{12} m\odot/h^2$), hinting at a uniform quenching mechanism forboth, e.g., the virial shock-heating of infalling gas. the success of the ihodhalo quenching model provides strong evidence that the physical mechanism thatquenches star formation in galaxies is tied principally to the masses of theirdark matter halos rather than the properties of their stellar components.

astro-ph;0509026	detection of large scale intrinsic ellipticity-density correlation from  the sloan digital sky survey and implications for weak lensing surveys	the power spectrum of weak lensing shear caused by large-scale structure isan emerging tool for precision cosmology, in particular for measuring theeffects of dark energy on the growth of structure at low redshift. onepotential source of systematic error is intrinsic alignments of ellipticitiesof neighbouring galaxies (ii correlation) that could mimic the correlations dueto lensing. a related possibility pointed out by hirata and seljak (2004) iscorrelation between the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and the densityfield responsible for gravitational lensing shear (gi correlation). we presentconstraints on both the ii and gi correlations using 265 908 spectroscopicgalaxies from the sdss, and using galaxies as tracers of the mass in the caseof the gi analysis. the availability of redshifts in the sdss allows us toselect galaxies at small radial separations, which both reduces noise in theintrinsic alignment measurement and suppresses galaxy- galaxy lensing (whichotherwise swamps the gi correlation). while we find no detection of the iicorrelation, our results are nonetheless statistically consistent with recentdetections found using the supercosmos survey. in contrast, we have a cleardetection of gi correlation in galaxies brighter than l* that persists to thelargest scales probed (60 mpc/h) and with a sign predicted by theoreticalmodels. this correlation could cause the existing lensing surveys at z~1 tounderestimate the linear amplitude of fluctuations by as much as 20% dependingon the source sample used, while for surveys at z~0.5 the underestimation mayreach 30%.

astro-ph;0511164	galaxy halo masses and satellite fractions from galaxy-galaxy lensing in  the sdss: stellar mass, luminosity, morphology, and environment dependencies	the relationship between galaxies and dark matter can be characterized by thehalo mass of the central galaxy and the fraction of galaxies that aresatellites. here we present observational constraints from the sdss on thesequantities as a function of r-band luminosity and stellar mass usinggalaxy-galaxy weak lensing, with a total of 351,507 lenses. we use stellarmasses derived from spectroscopy and virial halo masses derived from weakgravitational lensing to determine the efficiency with which baryons in thehalo of the central galaxy have been converted into stars. we find that an l*galaxy with a stellar mass of 6x10^{10} m_{sun} is hosted by a halo with massof 1.4x10^{12} m_{sun}/h, independent of morphology, yielding baryon conversionefficiencies of 17_{-5}^{+10} (early types) and 16_{-6}^{+15} (late types) percent at the 95 per cent cl (statistical, not including systematic uncertaintydue to assumption of a universal initial mass function, or imf). we find thatfor a given stellar mass, the halo mass is independent of morphology belowm_{stellar}=10^{11} m_{sun}, in contrast to typically a factor of twodifference in halo mass between ellipticals and spirals at a fixed luminosity.this suggests that stellar mass is a good proxy for halo mass in this range andshould be used preferentially whenever a halo mass selected sample is needed.for higher stellar masses, the conversion efficiency is a declining function ofstellar mass, and the differences in halo mass between early and late typesbecome larger, reflecting the fact that most group and cluster halos withmasses above 10^{13} m_{sun} host ellipticals at the center, while even thebrightest central spirals are hosted by halos of mass below 10^{13} m_{sun}.(abridged)

astro-ph;0605476	density profiles of galaxy groups and clusters from sdss galaxy-galaxy  weak lensing	we present results of a measurement of the shape of the density profile ofgalaxy groups and clusters traced by 43 335 luminous red galaxies (lrgs) withspectroscopic redshifts from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). the galaxiesare selected such that they are the brightest within a cylindrical aperture,split into two luminosity samples, and modeled as the sum of stellar and darkmatter components. we present a detailed investigation of many possiblesystematic effects that could contaminate our signal and develop methods toremove them, including a detected intrinsic alignment for galaxies within 100kpc/h of lrgs which we remove using photometric redshift information. theresulting lensing signal is consistent with nfw profile dark matter halos; thesis profile is ruled out at the 96 (conservatively) and 99.96 per centconfidence level (cl) for the fainter and brighter lens samples (respectively)when we fit using lensing data between 40 kpc/h and 2 mpc/h with totalsignal-to-noise of 19 and 25 for the two lens samples. the lensing signalamplitude suggests that the faint and bright sample galaxies typically residein haloes of mass (2.9+/-0.4)x10^{13} m_{sun}/h and (6.7+/-0.8)x10^{13}m_{sun}/h respectively, in good agreement with predictions based on halospatial density with normalization lower than the 'concordance' sigma_8=0.9.when fitting for the concentration parameter in the nfw profile, we find c =5.0+/-0.6 (stat) +/-1 (sys), and c = 5.6+/-0.6 (stat) +/-1 (sys) for the faintand bright samples, consistent with lambda-cdm simulations. we also split thebright sample further to determine masses and concentrations for cluster-masshalos, finding mass (1.3+/-0.2)x10^{14} m_{sun}/h for the sample of lrgsbrighter than -22.6 in r.

astro-ph;0608643	the shear testing programme 2: factors affecting high precision weak  lensing analyses	the shear testing programme (step) is a collaborative project to improve theaccuracy and reliability of weak lensing measurement, in preparation for thenext generation of wide-field surveys. we review sixteen current and emergingshear measurement methods in a common language, and assess their performance byrunning them (blindly) on simulated images that contain a known shear signal.we determine the common features of algorithms that most successfully recoverthe input parameters. we achieve previously unattained discriminatory precisionin our analysis, via a combination of more extensive simulations, and pairs ofgalaxy images that have been rotated with respect to each other, thus removingnoise from their intrinsic ellipticities. the robustness of our simulationapproach is also confirmed by testing the relative calibration of methods onreal data.  weak lensing measurement has improved since the first step paper. severalmethods now consistently achieve better than 2% precision, and are still beingdeveloped. however, the simulations can now distinguish all methods fromperfect performance. our main concern continues to be the potential for amultiplicative shear calibration bias: not least because this can not beinternally calibrated with real data. we determine which galaxy populations areresponsible and, by adjusting the simulated observing conditions, we alsoinvestigate the effects of instrumental and atmospheric parameters. we haveisolated several previously unrecognised aspects of galaxy shape measurement,in which focussed development could provide further progress towards thesub-percent level of precision desired for future surveys.

astro-ph;0701671	intrinsic galaxy alignments from the 2slaq and sdss surveys: luminosity  and redshift scalings and implications for weak lensing surveys	correlations between intrinsic shear and the density field on large scales, apotentially important contaminant for cosmic shear surveys, have been robustlydetected at low redshifts with bright galaxies in sdss data. here we present amore detailed characterization of this effect, which can causeanti-correlations between gravitational lensing shear and intrinsic ellipticity(gi correlations). this measurement uses 36278 luminous red galaxies (lrgs)from the sdss spectroscopic sample with 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.35, split by redshift andluminosity; 7758 lrgs from the 2slaq survey at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8; and a variety ofother sdss samples from previous, related work. we find &gt;3sigma detections ofthe effect for all galaxy subsamples within the sdss lrg sample; for the 2slaqsample, we find a 2sigma detection for a bright subsample, and no detection fora fainter subsample. fitting formulae are provided for the scaling of the gicorrelations with luminosity, transverse separation, and redshift. we estimatecontamination in the measurement of sigma_8 for future cosmic shear surveys onthe basis of the fitted dependence of gi correlations on galaxy properties. wefind contamination to the power spectrum ranging from -1.5 (optimistic) to -33per cent (pessimistic) for a toy cosmic shear survey using all galaxies to adepth of r=24 using scales l~500. this corresponds to a bias in sigma_8 ofdelta sigma_8=-0.004 (optimistic), -0.02 (central), or -0.10 (pessimistic). weprovide a prescription for inclusion of this error in cosmological parameterestimation codes. the principal uncertainty is in the treatment of the l&lt;=l*blue galaxies. characterization of the tidal alignments of these galaxies,especially at redshifts relevant for cosmic shear, should be a high priorityfor the cosmic shear community.

astro-ph;0703114	a robust lower limit on the amplitude of matter fluctuations in the  universe from cluster abundance and weak lensing	cluster abundance measurements are among the most sensitive probes of theamplitude of matter fluctuations in the universe, which in turn can helpconstrain other cosmological parameters, like the dark energy equation of stateor neutrino mass. however, difficulties in calibrating the relation between thecluster observable and halo mass, and the lack of completeness information,make this technique particularly susceptible to systematic errors. here weargue that a cluster abundance analysis using statistical weak lensing on thestacked clusters leads to a robust lower limit on the amplitude offluctuations. the method compares the average weak lensing signal measuredaround the whole cluster sample to a theoretical prediction, assuming that theclusters occupy the centers of all of the most massive halos above some minimummass threshold. if the amplitude of fluctuations is below a certain limitingvalue, there are too few massive clusters in this model and the theoreticalprediction falls below the observations. since any effects that modify themodel assumptions can only decrease the theoretical prediction, the limitingamplitude becomes a robust lower limit. here, we apply it to a volume limitedsample of 16,000 group/cluster candidates identified from isolated luminous redgalaxies (lrgs) in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we find $\sigma_8(\omega_m/0.25)^{0.5}&gt;0.62$ at the 95% c.l. after taking into accountobservational errors in the lensing analysis. while this is a relatively weakconstraint, both the scatter in the lrg luminosity-halo mass relation and thelensing errors are large; the constraints could improve considerably in thefuture with more sophisticated cluster identification algorithms and smallererrors in the lensing analysis.
