0904.1290	the m_bh-sigma diagram, and the offset nature of barred active galaxies	from a sample of 50 predominantly inactive galaxies with direct supermassiveblack hole mass measurements, it has recently been established that barredgalaxies tend to reside rightward of the m_bh-sigma relation defined bynon-barred galaxies. either black holes in barred galaxies tend to be anaemicor the central velocity dispersions in these galaxies have a tendency to beelevated by the presence of the bar. the latter option is in accord withstudies connecting larger velocity dispersions in galaxies with old bars, whilethe former scenario is at odds with the observation that barred galaxies do notdeviate from the m_bh-luminosity relation. using a sample of 88 galaxies withactive galactic nuclei, whose supermassive black hole masses have beenestimated from their associated emission lines, we reveal for the first timethat they also display this same general behavior in the m_bh-sigma diagramdepending on the presence of a bar or not. a new symmetrical andnon-symmetrical "barless" m_bh-sigma relation is derived using 82 non-barredgalaxies. the barred galaxies are shown to reside on or up to ~1 dex below thisrelation. this may explain why narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies appear offsetfrom the "barless" m_bh-sigma relation, and has far reaching implications giventhat over half of the disk galaxy population are barred.

0907.5250	quantifying the coexistence of massive black holes and dense nuclear  star clusters	in large spheroidal stellar systems, such as elliptical galaxies, oneinvariably finds a 10^6-10^9 m_sun supermassive black hole at their centre. incontrast, within dwarf elliptical galaxies one predominantly observes a10^5-10^7 m_sun nuclear star cluster. to date, few galaxies have been foundwith both type of nuclei coexisting and even less have had the massesdetermined for both central components. here we identify one dozen galaxieshousing nuclear star clusters and supermassive black holes whose masses havebeen measured. this doubles the known number of such hermaphrodite nuclei -which are expected to be fruitful sources of gravitational radiation. over thehost spheroid (stellar) mass range from 10^8 to 10^11 m_sun, we find that agalaxy's nucleus-to-spheroid (baryon) mass ratio is not a constant value butdecreases from a few percent to ~0.3 percent such that log[(m_bh+m_nc)/m_sph] =-(0.39+/-0.07)log[m_sph/10^10 m_sun] -(2.18+/-0.07). once dry merging hascommenced by m_sph ~ 10^11 m_sun and the nuclear star clusters havedisappeared, this ratio is expected to become a constant value.  as a byproduct of our investigation, we have found that the projected fluxfrom resolved nuclear star clusters can be well approximated with sersicfunctions having a range of indices from ~0.5 to ~3, the latter indexdescribing the milky way's nuclear star cluster.

0908.2102	the millennium galaxy catalogue: the $m_{bh}$--$l_{spheroid}$ derived  supermassive black hole mass function	supermassive black hole mass estimates are derived for 1743 galaxies from themillennium galaxy catalogue using the recently revised empirical relationbetween supermassive black hole mass and the luminosity of the host spheroid.the mgc spheroid luminosities are based on $r^{1/n}$-bulge plusexponential-disc decompositions. the majority of black hole masses residebetween $10^6 m_{\odot}$ and an upper limit of $2\times10^9 m_{\odot}$. usingpreviously determined space density weights, we derive the smbh mass functionwhich we fit with a schechter-like function. integrating the black hole massfunction over $10^6&lt; m_{bh}/ m_{\odot} &lt; 10^{10}$ gives a supermassive blackhole mass density of ($3.8 \pm 0.6) \times 10^5 h^{3}_{70} m_{\odot}$mpc$^{-3}$ for early-type galaxies and ($0.96 \pm 0.2) \times10^5 h^{3}_{70}m_{\odot}$ mpc$^{-3}$ for late-type galaxies. the errors are estimated frommonte carlo simulations which include the uncertainties in the $m_{bh}$--$l$relation, the luminosity of the host spheroid and the intrinsic scatter of the$m_{bh}$--$l$ relation. assuming supermassive black holes form via baryonicaccretion we find that ($0.008\pm0.002) h_{70}^{3}$ per cent of the universe'sbaryons are currently locked up in supermassive black holes. this result isconsistent with our previous estimate based on the $m_{bh}$--$n$ (s{\'e}rsicindex) relation.

0910.1356	discovery of an optical counterpart to the hyperluminous x-ray source in  eso 243-49	the existence of black holes of masses ~ 10^2-10^5 msun has importantimplications for the formation and evolution of star clusters and supermassiveblack holes. one of the strongest candidates to date is the hyperluminous x-raysource hlx1, possibly located in the s0-a galaxy eso243-49, but the lack of anidentifiable optical counterpart had hampered its interpretation. using themagellan telescope, we have discovered an unresolved optical source with r =(23.80 +/- 0.25) mag and v = (24.5 +/- 0.3) mag within hlx1's positional errorcircle. this implies an average x-ray/optical flux ratio ~ 500. taking the samedistance as eso243-49, we obtain an intrinsic brightness m_r = (-11.0 +/- 0.3)mag, comparable to that of a massive globular cluster. alternatively, theoptical source is consistent with a main-sequence m star in the galactic halo(for example an m4.4 star at ~ 2.5 kpc). we also examined the properties ofeso243-49 by combining swift/uvot observations with stellar populationmodelling. we found that the overall emission is dominated by a ~5 gyr oldstellar population, but the uv emission at ~2000 ang is mostly due to ongoingstar-formation at a rate of ~ 0.03 msun/yr. the uv emission is more intense (atleast a 9-sigma enhancement above the mean) north east of the nucleus, in thesame quadrant as hlx1. with the combined optical and x-ray measurements, we putconstraints on the nature of hlx1. we rule out a foreground star and abackground agn. two alternative scenarios are still viable. hlx1 could be anaccreting intermediate-mass black hole in a star cluster, which may itself bethe stripped nucleus of a dwarf galaxy that passed through eso243-49, an eventwhich might have caused the current episode of star formation. or, it could bea neutron star in the galactic halo, accreting from an m4-m5 donor star.

1004.3627	on the transition from nuclear-cluster to black-hole dominated galaxy  cores	giant elliptical galaxies, believed to be built from the merger of lessergalaxies, are known to house a massive black hole at their center rather than acompact star cluster. if low- and intermediate-mass galaxies do indeed partakein the hierarchical merger scenario, then one needs to explain why their densenuclear star clusters are not preserved in merger events. a valuable clue maythe recent revelation that nuclear star clusters and massive black holesfrequently co-exist in intermediate mass bulges and elliptical galaxies. in aneffort to understand the physical mechanism responsible for the disappearanceof nuclear star clusters, we have numerically investigated the evolution ofmerging star clusters with seed black holes. using black holes that are 1-5% oftheir host nuclear cluster mass, we reveal how their binary coalescence duringa merger dynamically heats the newly wed star cluster, expanding it,significantly lowering its central stellar density, and thus making itsusceptible to tidal destruction during galaxy merging. moreover, thismechanism provides a pathway to explain the observed reduction in thenucleus-to-galaxy stellar mass ratio as one proceeds from dwarf to giantelliptical galaxies.

0704.0316	the millennium galaxy catalogue: the local supermassive black hole mass  function in early- and late-type galaxies	we provide a new estimate of the local supermassive black hole mass functionusing (i) the empirical relation between supermassive black hole mass and thesersic index of the host spheroidal stellar system and (ii) the measured(spheroid) sersic indices drawn from 10k galaxies in the millennium galaxycatalogue. the observational simplicity of our approach, and the directmeasurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the sersic index, forboth elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes itstraightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-typegalaxies alike. we have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass functionwith a schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxysample. considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than m_b = -18 mag, andintegrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 m_sun, we find that the localmass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} m_sun mpc^{-3}, and in late-typegalaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} m_sun mpc^{-3}. theuncertainties are derived from monte carlo simulations which includeuncertainties in the m_bh-n relation, the catalogue of sersic indices, thegalaxy weights and malmquist bias. the combined, cosmological, supermassiveblack hole mass density is thus omega_{bh, total} = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6} h_70.that is, using a new and independent method, we conclude that (0.007+/-0.003)h^3_{70} per cent of the universe's baryons are presently locked up insupermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies.

1202.4056	extending the m_(bh)-sigma diagram with dense nuclear star clusters	abridged: four new nuclear star cluster masses, m_nc, plus seven upperlimits, are provided for galaxies with previously determined black hole masses,m_bh. together with a sample of 64 galaxies with direct m_bh measurements, 13of which additionally now have m_nc measurements rather than only upper limits,plus an additional 29 dwarf galaxies with available m_nc measurements andvelocity dispersions sigma, an (m_bh + m_nc)-sigma diagram is constructed.given that major dry galaxy merger events preserve the m_bh/l ratio, and giventhat l ~ sigma^5 for luminous galaxies, it is first noted that the observationm_bh ~ sigma^5 is consistent with expectations. for the fainter ellipticalgalaxies it is known that l ~ sigma^2, and assuming a constant m_nc/l ratio(ferrarese et al.), the expectation that m_nc ~ sigma^2 is in broad agreementwith our new observational result that m_nc ~ sigma^{1.57\pm0.24}. thisexponent is however in contrast to the value of ~4 which has been reportedpreviously and interpreted in terms of a regulating feedback mechanism fromstellar winds.

1205.2702	a cosmological view of extreme mass-ratio inspirals in nuclear star  clusters	there is increasing evidence that many galaxies host both a nuclear starcluster (nc) and a super-massive black hole (smbh). their coexistence isparticularly prevalent in spheroids with stellar mass 10^8-10^10 solar masses.we study the possibility that a stellar-mass black hole (bh) hosted by a ncinspirals and merges with the central smbh. due to the high stellar density inncs, extreme mass-ratio inspirals (emris) of bhs onto smbhs in ncs may beimportant sources of gravitational waves (gws). we consider sensitivity curvesfor three different space-based gw laser interferometric mission concepts: thelaser interferometer space antenna (lisa), the new gravitational waveobservatory (ngo) and the deci-hertz interferometer gravitational waveobservatory (decigo). we predict that, under the most optimistic assumptions,lisa and decigo will detect up to thousands of emris in ncs per year, while ngowill observe up to tens of emris per year. we explore how a number of factorsmay affect the predicted rates. in particular, if we assume that the mass ofthe smbh scales with the square of the host spheroid mass in galaxies with ncs,rather than a linear scaling, then the event rates are more than a factor of 10lower for both lisa and ngo, while they are almost unaffected in the case ofdecigo.

1205.5338	updated mass scaling relations for nuclear star clusters and a  comparison to supermassive black holes	we investigate whether nuclear star clusters and supermassive black holesfollow a common set of mass scaling relations with their host galaxy'sproperties, and hence can be considered to form a single class of centralmassive object. we have compiled a large sample of galaxies with measurednuclear star cluster masses and host galaxy properties from the literature andfit log-linear scaling relations. we find that nuclear star cluster mass,m_{nc}, correlates most tightly with the host galaxy's velocity dispersion: logm_{nc} = (2.11 \pm 0.31) log (\sigma/54) + (6.63 \pm 0.09), but has a slopedramatically shallower than the relation defined by supermassive black holes.we find that the nuclear star cluster mass relations involving host galaxy (andspheroid) luminosity and stellar and dynamical mass, intercept with but are ingeneral shallower than the corresponding black hole scaling relations. inparticular m_{nc} \propto {m}_{gal,dyn}^{0.55 \pm 0.15}; the nuclear clustermass is not a constant fraction of its host galaxy or spheroid mass. weconclude that nuclear stellar clusters and supermassive black holes do not forma single family of central massive objects.

1209.0259	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 0.013 &lt; z &lt; 0.1 cosmic spectral  energy distribution from 0.1 micron to 1mm	we use the gama i dataset combined with galex, sdss and ukidss imaging toconstruct the low-redshift (z&lt;0.1) galaxy luminosity functions in fuv, nuv,ugriz, and yjhk bands from within a single well constrained volume of 3.4 x10^5 (mpc/h)^{3}. the derived luminosity distributions are normalised to thesdss dr7 main survey to reduce the estimated cosmic variance to the 5 per centlevel. the data are used to construct the cosmic spectral energy distribution(csed) from 0.1 to 2.1 \mum free from any wavelength dependent cosmic variancefor both the elliptical and non-elliptical populations. the two populationsexhibit dramatically different cseds as expected for a predominantly old andyoung population respectively. using the driver et al. (2008) prescription forthe azimuthally averaged photon escape fraction, the non-ellipticals arecorrected for the impact of dust attenuation and the combined csed constructed.the final results show that the universe is currently generating (1.8 +/- 0.3)x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} of which (1.2 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} isdirectly released into the inter-galactic medium and (0.6 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} hw mpc^{-3} is reprocessed and reradiated by dust in the far-ir. using the gamadata and our dust model we predict the mid and far-ir emission which agreesremarkably well with available data. we therefore provide a robust descriptionof the pre- and post dust attenuated energy output of the nearby universe from0.1micron to 0.6mm. the largest uncertainty in this measurement lies in the midand far-ir bands stemming from the dust attenuation correction and itscurrently poorly constrained dependence on environment, stellar mass, andmorphology.

1211.3199	the (black hole mass)-(host spheroid luminosity) relation at high and  low masses, the quadratic growth of black holes, and intermediate-mass black  hole candidates	from a sample of 72 galaxies with reliable supermassive black hole massesm_(bh), we derive the m_(bh)-(host spheroid luminosity, l) relation for (i) thesubsample of 24 core-sersic galaxies with partially depleted cores, and (ii)the remaining subsample of 48 sersic galaxies. using (k_s)-band 2mass data, wefind the near-linear relation m_(bh) ~ l_(k_s)^(1.10+/-0.20) for thecore-sersic spheroids thought to be built in additive dry merger events, whilem_(bh) ~ l_(k_s)^(2.73+/-0.55) for the sersic spheroids built from gas-richprocesses. after converting literature b-band disk galaxy magnitudes intoinclination- and dust-corrected bulge magnitudes, via a useful new equationpresented herein, we obtain a similar result. unlike with the m_(bh)-sigmadiagram, which is also updated here using the same galaxy sample, it remainsunknown whether barred and non-barred sersic galaxies are offset from eachother in the m_(bh)-l diagram.  while black hole feedback has typically been invoked to explain what waspreviously thought to be a nearly constant m_bh/m_sph mass ratio of ~0.2%, weadvocate that the near-linear m_bh-l and m_bh-m_sph relations observed at highmasses may have instead largely arisen from the additive dry merging ofgalaxies. we argue that feedback results in a dramatically different scalingrelation, such that black hole mass scales roughly quadratically with thespheroid mass in sersic galaxies. we therefore introduce a revised cold-gas'quasar' mode feeding equation for semi-analytical models to reflect what wedub the "quadratic growth" of black holes in sersic galaxies built amidstgas-rich processes. finally, we use our new sersic m_bh-l equations to predictthe masses of candidate `intermediate mass' black holes in almost 50 lowluminosity spheroids containing agn, finding many masses between that ofstellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes.

1303.1273	central stellar mass deficits in the bulges of local lenticular  galaxies, and the connection with compact z ~ 1.5 galaxies	we have used the full radial extent of images from the hubble spacetelescope's advanced camera for surveys and wide field planetary camera 2 toextract surface brightness profiles from a sample of six, local lenticulargalaxy candidates. we have modelled these profiles using a core-sersic bulgeplus an exponential disk model. our lenticular disk galaxies with bulgemagnitudes m_v &lt; ~ -21.30 mag have central stellar deficits, suggesting thatthese bulges may have formed from `dry' merger events involving supermassiveblack holes while their surrounding disk was subsequently built up, perhaps viacold gas accretion scenarios. the central stellar mass deficits m_def areroughly 0.5 to 2 m_bh (black hole mass), rather than ~ 10 to 20 m_bh as claimedfrom some past studies, which is in accord with core-sersic model mass deficitmeasurements in elliptical galaxies. furthermore, these bulges have sersicindices n ~ 3, half light radii r_e &lt; 2 kpc and masses &gt; 10^11 m_sun, andtherefore appear to be descendants of the compact galaxies reported at z ~ 1.5to 2. past studies which have searched for these local counterparts by usingsingle-component galaxy models to provide the z ~ 0 size comparisons haveover-looked these dense, compact and massive bulges in today's early-type diskgalaxies. this evolutionary scenario not only accounts for what are todaygenerally old bulges---which must be present in z ~ 1.5 images---residing inwhat are generally young disks, but it eliminates the uncomfortable suggestionof a factor of 3 to 5 growth in size for the compact, z ~ 1.5 galaxies that areknown to possess infant disks.

1303.5490	the supermassive black hole mass - spheroid stellar mass relation for  s\'ersic and core-s\'ersic galaxies	we have examined the relationship between supermassive black hole mass(m$_{bh}$) and the stellar mass of the host spheroid (m$_{sph,*}$) for a sampleof 75 nearby galaxies. to derive the spheroid stellar masses we used improved2mass k$_s$-band photometry from the archangel photometry pipeline. dividingour sample into core-s\'ersic and s\'ersic galaxies, we find that they aredescribed by very different m$_{bh}$-m$_{sph,*}$ relations. for core-s\'ersicgalaxies - which are typically massive and luminous, with m$_{bh} \gtrsim2x10^8 m_\odot$ - we find m$_{bh} \propto m_{sph,*}^{(0.97 \pm 0.14)}$,consistent with other literature relations. however, for the s\'ersic galaxies- with typically lower masses, m$_{sph,*} \lesssim 3x10^10 m_\odot$ - we findm$_bh \propto m_{sph,*}^{(2.22 \pm 0.58)}$, a dramatically steeper slope thatdiffers by more than 2 standard deviations. this relation confirms that, fors\'ersic galaxies, m$_{bh}$ is not a constant fraction of m$_{sph,*}$. s\'ersicgalaxies can grow via the accretion of gas which fuels both star formation andthe central black hole, as well as through merging. their black hole growssignificantly more rapidly than their host spheroid, prior to growth by drymerging events that produce core-s\'ersic galaxies, where the black hole andspheroid grow in lock step. we have additionally compared our s\'ersicm$_{bh}$-m$_{sph,*}$ relation with the corresponding relation for nuclear starclusters, confirming that the two classes of central massive object followsignificantly different scaling relations.

1304.6723	the sluggs survey: probing the supermassive black hole connection with  bulges and haloes using red and blue globular cluster systems	understanding whether the bulge or the halo provides the primary link to thegrowth of supermassive black holes has strong implications for galaxy evolutionand supermassive black hole formation itself. in this paper, we approach thisissue by investigating extragalactic globular cluster (gc) systems, which canbe used to probe the physics of both the bulge and the halo of the host galaxy.we study the relation between the supermassive black hole masses m_bh and theglobular cluster system velocity dispersions sigma_gc using an updated andimproved sample of 21 galaxies. we exploit the dichotomy of globular clustersystem colours, to test if the blue and red globular clusters correlatedifferently with black hole mass. this may be expected if they trace thepotentially different formation history of the halo and of the bulge of thehost galaxy respectively. we find that m_bh correlates with the total gc systemvelocity dispersion, although not as strongly as claimed by recent work ofsadoun &amp; colin. we also examine the m_bh - sigma_gc relation forbarred/bar-less and core/non-core galaxies, finding no significant difference,and for the first time we quantify the impact of radial gradients in the gcsystem velocity dispersion profile on the m_bh - sigma_gc relation. weadditionally predict m_bh in 13 galaxies, including dwarf elliptical galaxiesand the cd galaxy ngc 3311. we conclude that our current results cannotdiscriminate between the bulge/halo scenario. although there is a hint that thered gc velocity dispersion might correlate better with m_bh than the blue gcvelocity dispersion, the number statistics are still too low to be certain.

1306.2679	the supermassive black hole mass - s\'ersic index relations for bulges  and elliptical galaxies	scaling relations between supermassive black hole mass, m_bh, and host galaxyproperties are a powerful instrument for studying their coevolution. a completepicture involving all of the black hole scaling relations, in which eachrelation is consistent with the others, is necessary to fully understand theblack hole-galaxy connection. the relation between m_bh and the central lightconcentration of the surrounding bulge, quantified by the s\'ersic index n, maybe one of the simplest and strongest such relations, requiring onlyuncalibrated galaxy images. we have conducted a census of literature s\'ersicindex measurements for a sample of 54 local galaxies with directly measuredm_bh values. we find a clear m_bh - n relation, despite an appreciable level ofscatter due to the heterogeneity of the data. given the current m_bh - l_sphand the l_sph - n relations, we have additionally derived the expected m_bh - nrelations, which are marginally consistent at the 2 sigma level with theobserved relations. elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies areeach expected to follow two distinct bent m_bh - n relations due to thes\'ersic/core-s\'ersic divide. for the same central light concentration, wepredict that m_bh in the s\'ersic bulges of disc galaxies are an ordermagnitude higher than in s\'ersic elliptical galaxies if they follow the samem_bh - l_sph relation.

0801.1548	fundamental planes, and the "barless" m-sigma relation, for supermassive  black holes	the residuals about the standard m-sigma relation correlate with theeffective radius, absolute magnitude, and sersic index of the host bulge -although, it is noted here that the elliptical galaxies do not partake in suchcorrelations. moreover, it is revealed that barred galaxies (with theirrelatively small, faint, and low stellar concentration bulges) can deviate fromthe m-sigma relation by delta(log m) = -0.5 to -1.0 dex (in the sense thattheir sigma values are too large) and generate much of the aforementionedcorrelations. removal of the seven barred galaxies from the tremaine et al. setof 31 galaxies results in a ``barless m-sigma'' relation with an intrinsicscatter of 0.17 dex (cf. 0.27 dex for the 31 galaxies) and a total scatter of0.25 dex (cf. 0.34 dex for the 31 galaxies). the introduction of thirdparameters does not reduce the scatter of the barless m-sigma relation.furthermore, removal of the barred galaxies, or all the disk galaxies, from anexpanded and updated set of 40 galaxies with reliable black hole massmeasurements gives a consistent result, such that log(m_bh/m_sun) =(8.25+/-0.05) + (3.68+/-0.25)log [sigma/200].  the "barless" sigma-l relation for galaxies with black hole mass measurementsis found to be consistent with that from the sdss sample of early-typegalaxies. in addition, the barless m-sigma relation, the m-l relation, and them-n relation are all shown to yield smbh masses less than 2-4 x 10^9 m_sun.

1409.4766	the hst/acs coma cluster survey. x. nuclear star clusters in low-mass  early-type galaxies: scaling relations	we present scaling relations between structural properties of nuclear starclusters and their host galaxies for a sample of early-type dwarf galaxiesobserved as part of the hubble space telescope (hst) advanced camera forsurveys (acs) coma cluster survey. we have analysed the light profiles of 200early-type dwarf galaxies in the magnitude range $16.0 &lt; m_{f814w} &lt; 22.6 $mag, corresponding to $-19.0 &lt; m_{f814w} &lt; -12.4 $ mag.  nuclear star clusters are detected in 80% of the galaxies, thus doubling thesample of hst-observed early-type dwarf galaxies with nuclear star clusters.\changed{we confirm that the} nuclear star cluster detection fraction decreasesstrongly toward faint magnitudes. the luminosities of nuclear star clusters donot scale linearly with host galaxy luminosity. a linear fit yields l$_{nuc}\sim $l$_{gal}^{0.57\pm0.05}$. the nuclear star cluster-host galaxy luminosityscaling relation for low-mass early-type dwarf galaxies is consistent withformation by globular cluster accretion. we find that at similar luminosities,galaxies with higher s\'ersic indices have slightly more luminous nuclear starclusters. rounder galaxies have on average more luminous clusters.  some of the nuclear star clusters are resolved, despite the distance of coma.we argue that the relation between nuclear star cluster mass and size isconsistent with both formation by globular cluster accretion and in situformation.  our data are consistent with gc inspiraling being the dominant mechanism atlow masses, although the observed trend with s\'ersic index suggests that insitu star formation is an important second order effect.

1410.7405	overmassive black holes in the $m_{\rm bh} - \sigma$ diagram do not  belong to over (dry) merged galaxies	semi-analytical models in a $\lambda$cdm cosmology have predicted thepresence of outlying, "overmassive" black holes at the high-mass end of the(black hole mass -- galaxy velocity dispersion) $m_{\rm bh} - \sigma$ diagram(which we update here with a sample of 89 galaxies). they are a consequence ofhaving experienced more dry mergers -- thought not to increase a galaxy'svelocity dispersion -- than the "main-sequence" population. wet mergers andgas-rich processes, on the other hand, preserve the main correlation. due tothe scouring action of binary supermassive black holes, the extent of these drymergers (since the last significant wet merger) can be traced by the ratiobetween the central stellar mass deficit and the black hole mass ($m_{\rmdef,*} / m_{\rm bh}$). however, in a sample of 23 galaxies with partiallydepleted cores, including central cluster galaxies, we show that the"overmassive" black holes are actually hosted by galaxies that appear to haveundergone the lowest degree of such merging. in addition, the rotationalkinematics of 37 galaxies in the $m_{\rm bh} - \sigma$ diagram reveals thatfast and slow rotators are not significantly offset from each other, alsocontrary to what is expected if these two populations were the product of wetand dry mergers respectively. the observations are thus not in accordance withmodel predictions and further investigation is required.

1411.6355	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): mass-size relations of z$&lt;$0.1 galaxies  subdivided by s\'ersic index, colour and morphology	we use data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey in the redshiftrange 0.01$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.1 (8399 galaxies in $g$ to $k_s$ bands) to derive thestellar mass $-$ half-light radius relations for various divisions of 'early'and 'late'-type samples. we find the choice of division between early and late(i.e., colour, shape, morphology) is not particularly critical, however, theadopted mass limits and sample selections (i.e., the careful rejection ofoutliers and use of robust fitting methods) are important. in particular wenote that for samples extending to low stellar mass limits($&lt;10^{10}\mathcal{m_{\odot}}$) the s\'ersic index bimodality, evident for highmass systems, becomes less distinct and no-longer acts as a reliable separatorof early- and late-type systems. the final set of stellar mass $-$ half-lightradius relations are reported for a variety of galaxy population subsets in 10bands ($ugrizzyjhk_s$) and are intended to provide a comprehensive low-zbenchmark for the many ongoing high-z studies. exploring the variation of thestellar mass $-$ half-light radius relations with wavelength we confirm earlierfindings that galaxies appear more compact at longer wavelengths albeit at asmaller level than previously noted: at $10^{10}\mathcal{m_{\odot}}$ bothspiral systems and ellipticals show a decrease in size of 13% from $g$ to $k_s$(which is near linear in log wavelength). finally we note that the sizes usedin this work are derived from 2d s\'ersic light profile fitting (usinggalfit3), i.e., elliptical semi-major half light radii, improving on earlierlow-z benchmarks based on circular apertures.

1412.3091	the (black hole)-bulge mass scaling relation at low masses	several recent papers have reported on the occurrence of active galacticnuclei (agn) containing under-massive black holes relative to a linear scalingrelation between black hole mass (m_bh) and host spheroid stellar mass(m_sph,*). dramatic revisions to the m_bh-m_sph,* and m_bh-l_sph relations,based on samples containing predominantly inactive galaxies, have howeverrecently identified a new steeper relation at m_bh &lt; (2-10)x10^8 m_sun, roughlycorresponding to m_sph,* &lt; (0.3-1)x10^{11} m_sun. we show that this steeper,quadratic-like m_bh-m_sph,* relation defined by the sersic galaxies, i.e.galaxies without partially depleted cores, roughly tracks the apparent offsetof the agn having 10^5 &lt; m_bh/m_sun &lt; 0.5x10^8. that is, these agn are notrandomly offset with low black hole masses, but also follow a steeper(non-linear) relation. as noted by busch et al., confirmation or rejection of apossible agn offset from the steeper m_bh-m_sph,* relation defined by thesersic galaxies will benefit from improved stellar mass-to-light ratios for thespheroids hosting these agn. several implications for formation theories arenoted. furthermore, reasons for possible under- and over-massive black holes,the potential existence of intermediate mass black holes (&lt;10^5 m_sun), and thenew steep (black hole)--(nuclear star cluster) relation, m_bh ~(m_nc)^{2.7+/-0.7}, are also discussed.

1502.07024	hiding in plain sight: an abundance of compact massive spheroids in the  local universe	it has been widely remarked that compact, massive, elliptical-like galaxiesare abundant at high redshifts but exceedingly rare in the universe today,implying significant evolution such that their sizes at z ~ 2+/-0.6 haveincreased by factors of 3 to 6 to become today's massive elliptical galaxies.these claims have been based on studies which measured the half-light radii ofgalaxies as though they are all single component systems. here we identify 21spheroidal stellar systems within 90 mpc that have half-light, major-axis radiir_e &lt; ~2 kpc, stellar masses 0.7x10^{11} &lt; m_*/m_sun &lt; 1.4x10^{11}, and sersicindices typically around a value of n=2 to 3. this abundance of compact,massive spheroids in our own backyard - with a number density of 6.9x10^{-6} /mpc^3 (or 3.5x10^{-5} / mpc^3 per unit dex in stellar mass) - and with the samephysical properties as the high-redshift galaxies, had been over-looked becausethey are encased in stellar disks which usually result in `galaxy' sizesnotably larger than 2 kpc. moreover, this number density is a lower limitbecause it has not come from a volume-limited sample. the actual density may becloser to 10^{-4} / mpc^3, although further work is required to confirm this.we therefore conclude that not all massive `spheroids' have undergone dramaticstructural and size evolution since z ~ 2+/-0.6. given that the bulges of localearly-type disk galaxies are known to consist of predominantly old stars whichexisted at z ~ 2, it seems likely that some of the observed high redshiftspheroids did not increase in size by building (3d) triaxial envelopes ascommonly advocated, and that the growth of (2d) disks has also been importantover the past 9-11 billion years.

1506.05466	h-atlas/gama: quantifying the morphological evolution of the galaxy  population using cosmic calorimetry	using results from the herschel astrophysical terrahertz large-area surveyand the galaxy and mass assembly project, we show that, for galaxy masses aboveapproximately 1.0e8 solar masses, 51% of the stellar mass-density in the localuniverse is in early-type galaxies (etgs: sersic n &gt; 2.5) while 89% of the rateof production of stellar mass-density is occurring in late-type galaxies (ltgs:sersic n &lt; 2.5). from this zero-redshift benchmark, we have used a calorimetrictechnique to quantify the importance of the morphological transformation ofgalaxies over the history of the universe. the extragalactic backgroundradiation contains all the energy generated by nuclear fusion in stars sincethe big bang. by resolving this background radiation into individual galaxiesusing the deepest far-infrared survey with the herschel space observatory and adeep near-infrared/optical survey with the hubble space telescope (hst), andusing measurements of the sersic index of these galaxies derived from the hstimages, we estimate that approximately 83% of the stellar mass-density formedover the history of the universe occurred in ltgs. the difference between thisand the fraction of the stellar mass-density that is in ltgs today impliesthere must have been a major transformation of ltgs into etgs after theformation of most of the stars.

1507.00735	dark matter halo properties of gama galaxy groups from 100 square  degrees of kids weak lensing data	the kilo-degree survey (kids) is an optical wide-field survey designed to mapthe matter distribution in the universe using weak gravitational lensing. inthis paper, we use these data to measure the density profiles and masses of asample of $\sim \mathrm{1400}$ spectroscopically identified galaxy groups andclusters from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. we detect a highlysignificant signal (signal-to-noise-ratio $\sim$ 120), allowing us to study theproperties of dark matter haloes over one and a half order of magnitude inmass, from $m \sim 10^{13}-10^{14.5} h^{-1}\mathrm{m_{\odot}}$. we interpretthe results for various subsamples of groups using a halo model framework whichaccounts for the mis-centring of the brightest cluster galaxy (used as thetracer of the group centre) with respect to the centre of the group's darkmatter halo. we find that the density profiles of the haloes are well describedby an nfw profile with concentrations that agree with predictions fromnumerical simulations. in addition, we constrain scaling relations between themass and a number of observable group properties. we find that the mass scaleswith the total r-band luminosity as a power-law with slope $1.16 \pm 0.13$(1-sigma) and with the group velocity dispersion as a power-law with slope$1.89 \pm 0.27$ (1-sigma). finally, we demonstrate the potential of weaklensing studies of groups to discriminate between models of baryonic feedbackat group scales by comparing our results with the predictions from thecosmo-overwhelmingly large simulations (cosmo-owls) project, ruling out modelswithout agn feedback.

0805.3565	inclination- and dust-corrected galaxy parameters: bulge-to-disc ratios  and size-luminosity relations	while galactic bulges may contain no significant dust of their own, the dustwithin galaxy discs can strongly attenuate the light from their embeddedbulges. furthermore, such dust inhibits the ability ofobservationally-determined inclination corrections to recover intrinsic (i.e.dust free) galaxy parameters. using the sophisticated 3d radiative transfermodel of popescu et al. and tuffs et al., together with driver et al.'s recentdetermination of the average face-on opacity in nearby disc galaxies, weprovide simple equations to correct (observed) disc central surfacebrightnesses and scalelengths for the effects of both inclination and dust inthe b, v, i, j and k passband. we then collate and homogenise variousliterature data sets and determine the typical intrinsic scalelengths, centralsurface brightnesses and magnitudes of galaxy discs as a function ofmorphological type. all galaxies have been carefully modelled in theirrespective papers with a sersic bulge plus an exponential disc. using the bulgemagnitude corrections from driver et al., we additionally derive the average,dust-corrected, bulge-to-disc flux ratio as a function of galaxy type. withvalues typically less than 1/3, this places somewhat uncomfortable constraintson some current semi-analytic simulations. typical bulge sizes, profile shapes,surface brightnesses and deprojected densities are provided. finally, given thetwo-component nature of disc galaxies, we present luminosity-size and (surfacebrightness)-size diagrams for discs and bulges. we also show that thedistribution of elliptical galaxies in the luminosity-size diagram is notlinear but strongly curved.

1511.05654	explaining the reportedly over-massive black holes in early-type  galaxies with intermediate-scale discs	the classification "early-type" galaxy includes both elliptically- andlenticular-shaped galaxies. theoretically, the spheroid-to-disc flux ratio ofan early-type galaxy can assume any positive value, but in practice studiesoften consider only spheroid/disc decompositions in which the disc neatlydominates over the spheroid at large galaxy radii, creating an inner "bulge" asobserved in most spiral galaxies. here we show that decompositions in which thedisc remains embedded within the spheroid, labelled by some as "unphysical",correctly reproduce both the photometric and kinematic properties of early-typegalaxies with intermediate-scale discs. intermediate-scale discs have oftenbeen confused with large-scale discs and incorrectly modelled as such; whenthis happens, the spheroid luminosity is considerably underestimated. this hasrecently led to some surprising conclusions, such as the claim that a number ofgalaxies with intermediate-scale discs (mrk 1216, ngc 1277, ngc 1271, and ngc1332) host a central black hole whose mass is abnormally large compared toexpectations from the (underestimated) spheroid luminosity. we show that whenthese galaxies are correctly modelled, they no longer appear as extremeoutliers in the (black hole mass)-(spheroid mass) diagram. this not onlynullifies the need for invoking different evolutionary scenarios for thesegalaxies but it strengthens the significance of the observed (black holemass)-(spheroid mass) correlation and confirms its importance as a fundamentalingredient for theoretical and semi-analytic models used to describe thecoevolution of spheroids and their central supermassive black holes.

astro-ph;0011256	an investigation into the prominence of spiral galaxy bulges	from a diameter-limited sample of 86 `face-on' spiral galaxies, thebulge-to-disk size and luminosity ratios, and other quantitative measurementsfor the prominence of the bulge are derived. the bulge and disk parameters havebeen estimated using a seeing convolved sersic r^(1/n) bulge and a seeingconvolved exponential disk. in general, early-type spiral galaxy bulges havesersic values of n&gt;1, and late-type spiral galaxy bulges have values of n&lt;1. inthe b-band, only 8 galaxies have a bulge shape parameter n consistent with theexponential value of 1, and only 5 galaxies do in the k-band. application ofthe r^(1/n) bulge models results in a larger mean r_e/h ratio for theearly-type spiral galaxies than the late-type spiral galaxies. although, thisresult is shown not to be statistically significant. the mean b/d luminosityratio is, however, significantly larger (&gt; 3-sigma) for the early-type spiralsthan the late-type spirals. this apparent contradiction with the r_e/h valuescan be explained with an iceberg-like scenario, in which the bulges inlate-type spiral galaxies are relatively submerged in their disk. this can beachieved by varying the relative bulge/disk stellar density while maintainingthe same effective bulge-to-disk size ratio.  the absolute bulge magnitude - log(n) diagram is used as a diagnostic toolfor comparative studies with dwarf elliptical and ordinary elliptical galaxies.at least in the b-band, these objects occupy distinctly different regions ofthis parameter space. while the dwarf ellipticals appear to be the faintextension to the brighter elliptical galaxies, the bulges of spiral galaxiesare not.

astro-ph;0102393	on the estimation of galaxy structural parameters: the sersic model	this paper addresses some questions which have arisen from the use of thes\'ersic r^{1/n} law in modelling the luminosity profiles of early typegalaxies. the first issue deals with the trend between the half-light radiusand the structural parameter n. we show that the correlation between these twoparameters is not only real, but is a natural consequence from the previousrelations found to exist between the model-independent parameters: totalluminosity, effective radius and effective surface brightness. we also define anew galaxy concentration index which is largely independent of the imageexposure depth, and monotonically related with n. the second question concernsthe curious coincidence between the form of the fundamental plane and thecoupling between &lt;i&gt;_e and r_e when modelling a light profile. we explain,through a mathematical analysis of the s\'ersic law, why the quantityr_e&lt;i&gt;_e^{0.7} appears almost constant for an individual galaxy, regardless ofthe value of n (over a large range) adopted in the fit to the light profile.consequently, fundamental planes of the form r_e&lt;i&gt;_e^{0.7} propto sigma_0^x(for any x, and where sigma_0 is the central galaxy velocity dispersion) areinsensitive to galaxy structure. finally, we address the problematic issue ofthe use of model-dependent galaxy light profile parameters versusmodel-independent quantities for the half-light radii, mean surface brightnessand total galaxy magnitude. the former implicitly assume that the light profilemodel can be extrapolated to infinity, while the latter quantities, in general,are derived from a signal-to-noise truncated profile. we quantify(mathematically) how these parameters change as one reduces the outer radius ofan r^{1/n} profile, and reveal how these can vary substantially when n&gt;4.

astro-ph;0110159	galaxy light concentration. i. index stability and the connection with  galaxy structure, dynamics, and supermassive black holes	we explore the stability of different galaxy light concentration indices as afunction of the outermost observed galaxy radius. with a series of analyticallight-profile models, we show mathematically how varying the radial extent towhich one measures a galaxy's light can strongly affect the derived galaxyconcentration. the "mean concentration index", often used for parameterizinghigh-redshift galaxies, is shown to be horribly unstable, even when modelingone-component systems such as elliptical, dwarf elliptical and pure exponentialdisk galaxies. the c_31 concentration index performs considerably better but isalso heavily dependent on the radial extent, and hence exposure depth, of anygiven galaxy. we show that the recently defined central concentration index isremarkably stable against changes to the outer radius, providing a meaningfuland reliable estimate of galaxy concentration. the index n from the r^(1/n)models is shown to be monotonically related with the central concentration oflight, giving the index n a second and perhaps more tangible meaning. with asample of elliptical and dwarf elliptical galaxies, we present correlationsbetween the central light concentration and the global parameters: luminosity(pearson's r = -0.82), effective radius (r = 0.67), central surface brightness(r = -0.88), and velocity dispersion (r = 0.80). the more massive ellipticalgalaxies are shown to be more centrally concentrated. we speculate that thephysical mechanism behind the recently observed correlation between the centralvelocity dispersion (mass) of a galaxy and the mass of its central supermassiveblack hole may be connected with the central galaxy concentration. that is, wehypothesize that it may not simply be the amount of mass in a galaxy but ratherhow that mass is distributed that controls the mass of the central black hole.

astro-ph;0201485	triaxial stellar systems following the r^{1/n} luminosity law: an  analytical mass-density expression, gravitational torques and the bulge/disc  interplay	we have investigated the structural and dynamical properties of triaxialstellar systems whose surface brightness profiles follow the r^{1/n} luminositylaw - extending the analysis of ciotti (1991) who explored the properties ofspherical r^{1/n} systems. a new `analytical' expression that accuratelyreproduces the spatial (i.e. deprojected) luminosity density profiles (error &lt;0.1%) is presented for detailed modelling of the sersic family of luminosityprofiles. we evaluate both the symmetric and the non--axisymmetric componentsof the gravitational potential and force, and compute the torques as a functionof position. for a given triaxiality, stellar systems with smaller values of nhave a greater non-axisymmetric gravitational field component. we also explorethe strength of the non-axisymmetric forces produced by bulges with differing nand triaxiality on systems having a range of bulge-to-disc ratios. theincreasing disc-to-bulge ratio with increasing galaxy type (decreasing n) isfound to heavily reduce the amplitude of the non-axisymmetric terms, andtherefore reduce the possibility that triaxial bulges in late-type systems maybe the mechanism or perturbation for nonsymmetric structures in the disc. usingseeing-convolved r^{1/n}-bulge plus exponential-disc fits to the k-band datafrom a sample of 80 nearby disc galaxies, we probe the relations between galaxytype, sersic index n and the bulge-to-disc luminosity ratio. these relationsare shown to be primarily a consequence of the relation between n and the totalbulge luminosity. in the k-band, the trend of decreasing bulge-to-discluminosity ratio along the spiral hubble sequence is predominantly, althoughnot entirely, a consequence of the change in the total bulge luminosity; thetrend between the total disc luminosity and hubble type is much weaker.

astro-ph;0202307	evidence for an outer disk in the prototype `compact elliptical' galaxy  m32	m32 is the prototype for the relatively rare class of galaxies referred to as`compact ellipticals'. it has been suggested that m32 may be a tidallydisturbed r^(1/4) elliptical galaxy, or the remnant bulge of a disk-strippedearly-type spiral galaxy. this paper reveals that the surface brightnessprofile, the velocity dispersion measurements, and the estimated supermassiveblack hole mass in m32 are inconsistent with the galaxy having, and probablyever having had, an r^(1/4) light profile. instead, the radial surfacebrightness distribution of m32 resembles an almost perfect (bulge + exponentialdisk) profile, which is accompanied by a marked increase in the ellipticityprofile and an associated change in the position angle profile where the `disk'starts to dominate. compelling evidence that this bulge/disk interpretation isaccurate comes from the best-fitting r^(1/n) bulge model which has a sersicindex n=1.5, in agreement with the recently discovered relation between abulge's sersic index and the mass of its supermassive black hole. an index n&gt;4would also be inconsistent with the stellar velocity dispersion of m32. thebulge-to-disk size ratio r_e /h equals 0.20, and the logarithm of thebulge-to-disk luminosity ratio log(b/d) equals 0.22, typical of lenticulargalaxies. the effective radius of the bulge is 27" (~100 pc), while thescale-length of the disk is less well determined: due to possible tidal-stripping of the outer profile beyond 220-250", the scale-length may be aslarge as 1.3 kpc. m32 is a relatively face-on, nucleated, dwarf galaxy with alow surface brightness disk and a high surface brightness bulge. this findingbrings into question the existence of the compact elliptical class of galaxies.

astro-ph;0203291	mass-to-light ratios from the fundamental plane of spiral galaxy disks	the best-fitting 2-dimensional plane within the 3-dimensional space of spiralgalaxy disk observables (rotational velocity v_{rot}, central disk surfacebrightness \mu_0 = -2.5log i_0, and disk scale-length h) has been constructed.applying a three-dimensional bisector method of regression analysis to a sampleof ~100 spiral galaxy disks that span more than four mag arcsec^{-2} in centraldisk surface brightness yields v_{rot} ~ i_0^{0.50+/-0.05}h^{0.77+/-0.07}(b-band) and v_{rot} ~ i_0^{0.43+/-0.04}h^{0.69+/-0.07} (r-band). contrary topopular belief, these results suggest that in the b-band, the dynamicalmass-to- light ratio (within 4 disk scale-lengths) is largely independent ofsurface brightness, varying as i_0^{0.00+/-0.10}h^{0.54+/-0.14}. consistentresults were obtained when the expanse of the analysis was truncated byexcluding the low surface brightness galaxies. previous claims that m/l_bvaries with i_0^{-1/2} are shown to be misleading and/or due to galaxyselection effects. not all low-surface-brightness disk galaxies are dark matterdominated. the situation is however different in the near-infrared where l_{k'}\~ v^4 and m/l_{k'} is shown to vary as i_0^{-1/2}. theoretical studies ofspiral galaxy disks should not assume a constant m/l ratio within any givenpassband. the b-band dynamical mass-to-light ratio (within 4 diskscale-lengths) has no obvious correlation with (b-r) disk colour, while in thek'-band it varies as -1.25+/-0.28(b-r). combining the present observationaldata with recent galaxy model predictions implies that the logarithm of thestellar-to-dynamical mass ratio is not a constant value, but increases as disksbecome redder, varying as 1 .70+/-0.28(b-r).

astro-ph;0203509	the photometric plane of elliptical galaxies	the sersic r^(1/n) index n of an elliptical galaxy (or bulge) has recentlybeen shown to correlate strongly (r=0.8) with a galaxy's central velocitydispersion. this index could therefore prove extremely useful andcost-effective (in terms of both telescope time and data reduction) for manyfields of extragalactic research. it is a purely photometric quantity whichapparently not only traces the mass of a bulge but has additionally been shownto reflect the degree of bulge concentration. this paper explores the affect ofreplacing the central velocity dispersion term in the fundamental plane withthe sersic index n. using a sample of early-type galaxies from the virgo andfornax clusters, various (b-band) `photometric planes' were constructed andfound to have a scatter of 0.14-0.17 dex in log(r_e), or a distance error of38-48% per galaxy (the higher values arising from the inclusion of the s0galaxies). the corresponding fundamental plane yielded a 33-37% error indistance for the same galaxy (sub-)samples (i.e. ~15-30% less scatter). thegains in using a hyperplane (i.e. adding the sersic index to the fundamentalplane as a fourth parameter) were small, giving a 27-33% error in distance,depending on the galaxy sample used. the photometric plane has been used hereto estimate the virgo-fornax distance modulus; giving a value of\delta\mu=0.62(+/-0.30) mag (cf. 0.51(+/-0.21), hst key project on theextragalactic distance scale). the prospects for using the photometric plane athigher redshift appears promising. using published data on the intermediateredshift cluster cl 1358+62 (z=0.33) gave a photometric plane distance error of35-41% per galaxy.

astro-ph;0303391	hst photometry of dwarf elliptical galaxies in coma, and an explanation  for the alleged structural dichotomy between dwarf and bright elliptical  galaxies	we have analyzed archival hst f606w images of 18 dwarf elliptical (de) galaxycandidates in the coma cluster. we model the full radial extent of theirlight-profiles by simultaneously fitting a psf-convolved sersic r^(1/n) modeland, when necessary, either a central point-source or a central psf-convolvedgaussian. the luminosities of the central component l_nuc scale with the hostgalaxy luminosity l_gal such that l_nuc = 10^(4.76 +/- 0.10)*(l_gal/10^7)^(0.87+/- 0.26). the underlying host galaxies display systematic departures from anexponential model that are correlated with the model-independent host galaxyluminosity and are not due to biasing from the nuclear component. the pearsoncorrelation coefficient between log(n) and central galaxy surface brightnessmu_0 (excluding the flux from extraneous central components) is -0.83 at asignificance level of 99.99%. the pearson correlation coefficient between thelogarithm of the sersic index `n' and the host galaxy magnitude is -0.77 at asignificance of 99.9%. we explain the observed relationship between de galaxyluminosity and inner logarithmic profile slope (gamma-prime) as a by-product ofthe correlation between luminosity and sersic index n. including, from theliterature, an additional 232 de and e galaxies spanning 10 mag in absolutemagnitude (m), the de galaxies are shown to display a continuous sequence withthe brighter e galaxies such that mu_0 brightens linearly with m until coreformation causes the most luminous (m_b &lt; -20.5 mag) e galaxies to deviate fromthis relation. the different behavior of de and e galaxies in the m-mu_e (andm-&lt;mu&gt;_e) diagram, and the &lt;mu&gt;_e-log(r_e) diagram have nothing to do with coreformation, and are in fact expected from the continuous and linear relationbetween m and mu_0 and m and log(n).

astro-ph;0306023	a new empirical model for the structural analysis of early-type galaxies  and a critical review of the nuker model	the nuker law was designed to match the inner few (~3-10) arcseconds ofpredominantly nearby (&lt; 30 mpc) early-type galaxy light-profiles; it was neverintended to describe an entire profile. the sersic model, on the other hand,was developed to fit the entire profile; however, due to the presence ofpartially depleted galaxy cores, the sersic model cannot always describe thevery inner region. we have therefore developed a new empirical model consistingof an inner power-law, a transition region, and an outer sersic model toconnect the inner and outer structure of elliptical galaxies. moreover, thestability of the nuker model parameters are investigated. surprisingly, noneare found to be stable quantities; all are shown to vary systematically with aprofile's fitted radial extent, and often by more than 100%. consideringelliptical galaxies spanning a range of 7.5 magnitudes, the central stellardensity of the underlying host galaxy is observed to increase with galaxyluminosity until the onset of core formation, detected only in the brightestelliptical galaxies. we suggest that the so-called ``power-law'' galaxies mayactually be described by the sersic model over their entire radial range.

astro-ph;0310791	when is a bulge not a bulge? inner disks masquerading as bulges in ngc  2787 and ngc 3945	we present a detailed morphological, photometric, and kinematic analysis oftwo barred s0 galaxies with large, luminous inner disks inside their bars. weshow that these structures, in addition to being geometrically disk-like, haveexponential profiles (scale lengths $\sim$ 300--500 pc) distinct from thecentral, non-exponential bulges. we also find them to be kinematicallydisk-like. the inner disk in ngc 2787 has a luminosity roughly twice that ofthe bulge; but in ngc 3945, the inner disk is almost ten times more luminousthan the bulge, which itself is extremely small (half-light radius $\approx$100 pc, in a galaxy with an outer ring of radius $\approx$ 14 kpc) and only$\sim$ 5% of the total luminosity -- a bulge/total ratio much more typical ofan sc galaxy. we estimate that at least 20% of (barred) s0 galaxies may havesimilar structures, which means that their bulge/disk ratios may besignificantly overestimated. these inner disks dominate the central light oftheir galaxies; they are at least an order of magnitude larger than typical``nuclear disks'' found in ellipticals and early-type spirals. consequently,they must affect the dynamics of the bars in which they reside.

astro-ph;0403659	evidence for a new elliptical-galaxy paradigm: sersic and core galaxies	we fit the surface-brightness profiles of 21 elliptical galaxies using boththe sersic function and a new empirical model which combines an inner power lawwith an outer sersic function. the profiles are combinations of deconvolved hstprofiles from the literature and ellipse fits to the full wfpc2 mosaic images,and thus span a radial range from ~ 0.02 arcsec to ~ twice the half-lightradius. we are able to accurately fit the entire profiles using either thesersic function or our new model. in doing so, we demonstrate that most, if notall, so-called ``power-law'' galaxies are better described as ``sersicgalaxies'' -- they are well modeled by the three-parameter sersic profile intothe limits of hst resolution -- and that ``core'' galaxies are best understoodas consisting of an outer sersic profile with an inner power-law cusp, which isa downward deviation from the inward extrapolation of the sersic profile. thisdefinition of cores resolves ambiguities that result when the popular ``nukerlaw'' is fitted to the profiles of ellipticals and bulges, particularly atlower luminosities. we also find that using the nuker law to model core-galaxynuclear profiles systematically overestimates the core radii by factors of1.5--4.5 and underestimates the inner power-law slope by ~ 20--40% or more.

astro-ph;0503177	core depletion from coalescing supermassive black holes	new measurements of the stellar-mass deficits at the centers of luminouselliptical galaxies are presented. these were derived considering the followingobservational facts. firstly, ``core'' galaxies, which are thought to have hadtheir inner region depleted from the coalesence of supermassive black holes,show an abrupt downward deviation of their inner light-profile relative totheir outer sersic profile. second, ``power-law'' galaxies, having undisturbedprofiles and no partially depleted core, have inner light-profiles that displayno departure from the inward extrapolation of their outer sersic profile. thecentral stellar deficits have therefore been derived from the difference influx between the hst-observed galaxy light-profiles and the inwardextrapolation of each galaxy's outer sersic profile. this approach gives fluxdeficits ~0.1% of the total galaxy light, and mass deficits that are ~2 timeseach galaxy's central supermassive black hole mass. these results are inagreement with the theoretical expectations of mass ejection from binary blackhole mergers and also with popular lcdm models of hierarchical galaxyformation. it is also explained why this result is some 10 times smaller thancurrent observational estimates of the central mass deficit, and thereforeimplies a merger history for giant elliptical galaxies that is one order ofmagnitude less violent than previously suggested.

astro-ph;0504287	total galaxy magnitudes and effective radii from petrosian magnitudes  and radii	petrosian magnitudes were designed to help with the difficult task ofdetermining a galaxy's total light. although these magnitudes (taken here asthe flux within 2r_p, with the inverted petrosian index 1/eta(r_p)=0.2) canrepresent most of an object's flux, they do of course miss the light outside ofthe petrosian aperture (2r_p). the size of this flux deficit variesmonotonically with the shape of a galaxy's light-profile, i.e., itsconcentration. in the case of a de vaucouleurs r^{1/4} profile, the deficit is0.20 mag; for an r^{1/8} profile this figure rises to 0.50 mag. here we providea simple method for recovering total (sersic) magnitudes from petrosianmagnitudes using only the galaxy concentration (r_90/r_50 or r_80/r_20) withinthe petrosian aperture. the corrections hold to the extent that sersic's modelprovides a good description of a galaxy's luminosity profile. we show how theconcentration can also be used to convert petrosian radii into effectivehalf-light radii, enabling a robust measure of the mean effective surfacebrightness. our technique is applied to the sdss dr2 petrosian parameters,yielding good agreement with the total magnitudes, effective radii, and meaneffective surface brightnesses obtained from the nyu--vagc sersic r^{1/n} fitsby blanton et al. (2005). although the corrective procedure described here isspecifically applicable to the sdss dr2 and dr3, it is generally applicable toall imaging data where any petrosian index and concentration can beconstructed.

astro-ph;0608614	empirical models for dark matter halos. iii. the kormendy relation and  the log(rho_e)-log(r_e) relation	we have recently shown that the 3-parameter density-profile model fromprugniel &amp; simien provides a better fit to simulated, galaxy- andcluster-sized, dark matter halos than an nfw-like model with arbitrary innerprofile slope gamma (paper i). by construction, the parameters of theprugniel-simien model equate to those of the sersic r^{1/n} function fitted tothe projected distribution. using the prugniel-simien model, we are thereforeable to show that the location of simulated (10^{12} m_sun) galaxy-sized darkmatter halos in the &lt;mu&gt;_e-log(r_e) diagram coincides with that of brightestcluster galaxies, i.e., the dark matter halos appear consistent with thekormendy relation defined by luminous elliptical galaxies. these objects arealso seen to define the new, and equally strong, relation log(rho_e) = 0.5 -2.5log(r_e), in which rho_e is the internal density at r=r_e. simulated(10^{14.5} m_sun) cluster-sized dark matter halos and the gas component of realgalaxy clusters follow the relation log(rho_e) = 2.5[1 - log(r_e)]. given theshapes of the various density profiles, we are able to conclude that whiledwarf elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters can have dark matter halos witheffective radii of comparable size to the effective radii of their baryoniccomponent, luminous elliptical galaxies can not. for increasingly largeelliptical galaxies, with increasingly large profile shapes `n', to be darkmatter dominated at large radii requires dark matter halos with increasinglylarge effective radii compared to the effective radii of their stellarcomponent.

astro-ph;0610752	the millennium galaxy catalogue: galaxy bimodality	galaxy bimodality is caused by the bulge-disc nature of galaxies as opposedto two distinct galaxy classes. this is evident in the colour-structure planewhich clearly shows that elliptical galaxies (bulge-only) lie in the redcompact peak and late-type spiral galaxies (disc-dominated) lie in the bluediffuse peak. early-type spirals (bulge plus disc systems) sprawl across bothpeaks. however after bulge-disc decomposition the bulges of early-type spiralslie exclusively in the red compact peak and their discs in the blue diffusepeak (exceptions exist but are rare, e.g., dust reddened edge-on discs and bluepseudo-bulges). movement between these two peaks is not trivial because whilstswitching off star-formation can transform colours from blue to red, modifyingthe orbits of ~1 billion stars from a planar diffuse structure to a triaxialcompact structure is problematic (essentially requiring an equal mass merger).we propose that the most plausible explanation for the dual structure ofgalaxies is that galaxy formation proceeds in two stages. first an initialcollapse phase (forming a centrally concentrated core and black hole), followedby splashback, infall and accretion (forming a planar rotating disc). dwarfsystems could perhaps follow the same scenario but the lack of low luminositybulge-disc systems would imply that the two components must rapidly blend toform a single flattened spheroidal system.

astro-ph;0612229	intracluster light and the extended stellar envelopes of cd galaxies: an  analytical description	we have analysed deep r-band images, down to a limiting surface brightness of26.5 r-mag arcsec$^{-2}$ (equivalent to ~28 b-mag arcsec$^{-2}$), of 5 cdgalaxies to determine the shape of the surface brightness profiles of theirextended stellar envelopes. both de vaucouleurs r^{1/4} model and sersic'sr^{1/n} model, on their own, provide a poor description of the surfacebrightness profiles of cd galaxies. this is due to the presence of outerstellar envelopes, thought to have accumulated over the merger history of thecentral cluster galaxy and also from the tidal stripping of galaxies at largercluster radii. we therefore simultaneously fit two sersic functions to measurethe shape of the inner and outer components of the cd galaxies. we show that,for 3 out of our 5 galaxies, the surface brightness profiles are best fit by aninner sersic model, with indices n~1-6, and an outer exponential component. forthese systems, the galaxy-to-envelope size ratio is 0.1 - 0.4 and thecontribution of the stellar envelope to the total r-band light (i.e. galaxy +envelope) is around 60 to 80 per cent (based on extrapolation to a 300 kpcradius). the exceptions are ngc 6173, for which our surface brightness profilemodelling is consistent with just a single component (i.e. no envelope) and ngc4874 which appears to have an envelope with a de vaucouleurs, rather thanexponential, profile.

astro-ph;0701728	the millennium galaxy catalogue: the luminosity functions of bulges and  discs and their implied stellar mass densities	we derive the luminosity functions of elliptical galaxies, galaxy bulges,galaxy pseudo-bulges and galaxy discs from our structural catalogue of 10,095galaxies. in addition we compute their associated luminosity and stellar massdensities. we show that spheroidal systems (elliptical galaxies and the bulgesof disc galaxies) exhibit a strong color bimodality indicating two distincttypes of spheroid which are separated by a core color of (u-r) ~ 2 mag. weargue that the similarity of the red elliptical and the red bulge luminosityfunctions supports our previous arguments that they share a common origin andsurprisingly find that the same follows for the blue ellipticals and bluebulges, the latter of which we refer to as pseudo-bulges. in terms of thestellar mass budget we find that $58\pm6$ per cent is currently in the form ofdiscs, 39+/-6 per cent in the form of red spheroids (13+/-4 per centellipticals, 26+/-4 per cent bulges) and the remainder is in the form of bluespheroidal systems (~1.5 per cent blue ellipticals and ~1.5 per centpseudo-bulges). in terms of galaxy formation we argue that our data on galaxycomponents strongly supports the notion of a two-stage formation process(spheroid first, disc later) but with the additional complexity of secularevolution occurring in quiescent discs giving rise to two distinct bulge types:genuine 'classical' bulges and pseudo-bulges. we therefore advocate that thereare three significant structures underpinning galaxy evolution: classicalspheroids (old); pseudo-bulges (young) and discs (intermediate). the luminousnearby galaxy population is a mixture of these three structural types.[abridged].

astro-ph;9801143	some effects of galaxy structure and dynamics on the fundamental plane.  ii. a virgo-fornax distance modulus	the influence of broken structural homology, and the implied broken dynamicalhomology, is examined for the fundamental plane (fp). a bisector method oflinear regression was applied, in 3-dimensions, to derive the best fp and abootstrapping procedure has been used to estimate the associated uncertainties.for 25 e and s0 virgo galaxies, the `standard' fp, constructed using r^{1/4}model parameters for the effective radii (r_{e,4}) and the mean surfacebrightness within this radius (sigma_{e,4}) and using central velocitydispersion measurements (sigma_0), gave a relation described byr_{e,4}~sigma_{0}^{1.10+/-0.14}sigma_{e,4}^{-0.55+/-0.09}. using sersic r^{1/n}light profile model parameters and the computed velocity dispersion within anaperture of infinite radius (sigma_{tot,n}) gave an `improved' fp described bythe relation r_{e,n}~sigma_{tot,n}^{1.37+/-0.16}sigma_{e,n}^{-0.76+/-0.05}.upon removal of the known s0 galaxies from the sample, the above planes wereobserved to change to r_{e,4}~sigma_{0}^{1.19+/-0.21}sigma_{e,4}^{-0.60+/-0.11}and r_{e,n}~sigma_{tot,n}^{1.72+/-0.24}sigma_{e,n}^{-0.74+/-0.09}. theperpendicular rms residuals about these planes are 0.084 and 0.050 dex,respectively. a similar analysis of the fornax cluster produced a fp given bythe relation r_{e,n}~sigma_{tot,n}^{2.03+/-0.78}sigma_{e,n}^{-1.07+/-0.30}, intantalizing agreement with the plane expected from the virial theorem, but withdiscouragingly large errors due to the small sample size of only 7. similarlyto virgo, the perpendicular rms residuals about this plane is 0.050 dex. avirgo-fornax distance modulus was computed using working-hotelling confidencebands. the `standard' fp parameters gave a value of 0.45+/-0.16 mag, where asthe `improved' fp parameters gave a value of 0.25+/-0.12 mag.

astro-ph;9908131	the influence of bulge profile shapes on claims for a scale-free hubble  sequence for spirals	we investigate recent claims that the hubble sequence of spiral galaxies isscale-free. fundamental to this investigation is the fact that within thephotometric data of 86 spiral galaxies from de jong &amp; van der kruit - fromwhich these claims were made - a trend exists between morphological type andbulge profile shape. while late-type spiral bulges are described by anexponential luminosity profile, the early-type spiral bulges are betterdescribed by an r^{1/2} or r^{1/4} law. taking the scale-lengths from thebest-fitting surface brightness profile models (i.e. either using exponential,r^{1/2}, or r^{1/4} law profile parameters), we show that in all six passbandsused (bvrihk) the early-type spirals have a larger r_e/h ratio than late-typespiral galaxies. in contrast to this, fitting an exponential profile to thebulges of all spirals results in the mean r_e/h ratio for the early-type spiralgalaxies actually being smaller than the mean r_e/h ratio for the late-typespiral galaxies (at the 3-sigma significance level using k-band data).

0810.5194	on the unification of dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies	the near orthogonal distributions of dwarf elliptical (de) and giantelliptical (e) galaxies in the mu_e-mag and mu_e-log(r_e) diagrams have beeninterpreted as evidence for two distinct galaxy formation processes. however,continuous, linear relationships across the alleged de/e boundary at m_b = -18mag - such as those between central surface brightness (mu_0) and (i) galaxymagnitude and (ii) light-profile shape (n) - suggest a similar, governingformation mechanism. here we explain how these latter two linear trendsnecessitate a different behavior for de and e galaxies, exactly as observed, indiagrams involving mu_e (and also &lt;mu&gt;_e). a natural consequence is that thedistribution of des and es in fundamental plane type analyses that use theassociated intensity i_e, or &lt;i&gt;_e, are expected to appear different. togetherwith other linear trends across the alleged de/e boundary, such as thosebetween luminosity and color, metallicity, and velocity dispersion, it appearsthat the des form a continuous extension to the e galaxies. the presence ofpartially depleted cores in luminous (m_b &lt; -20.5 mag) es does however signifythe action of a different physical process at the centers (&lt; ~300 pc) of thesegalaxies.
