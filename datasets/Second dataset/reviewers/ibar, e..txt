0907.1093	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields -- i. maps,  catalogues, and source counts	we present the first results from the largest deep extragalacticmillimetre-wavelength survey undertaken to date. these results are derived frommaps covering over 0.7 deg^2, made at 1.1mm, using the aztec continuum cameramounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope. the maps were made in the twofields originally targeted at 0.85mm with scuba in the shades project, namelythe lockman hole east (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mjy rms) and the subaru xmmdeep field (1.0-1.7 mjy rms). the wealth of existing and forthcoming deepmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm sourcepopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequentpapers. here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114high-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statisticalanalysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm sourcenumber counts. through careful comparison, we find that both the cosmos andgoods north fields, also imaged with aztec, contain an excess of mm sourcesover the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. in particular, ournew aztec/shades results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dustenshrouded starbursts (s_{1.1} &gt; 3 mjy) are 25-50% less common than would havebeen inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential rolesof cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. we compare number countpredictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population tothese smg surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoingrefinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, andfind that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetregalaxies found in this survey.

1002.3618	the agn fraction of submm-selected galaxies and contributions to the  submm/mm-wave extragalactic background light	we present a comparison of the scuba half degree extragalactic survey(shades) at 450, 850 and 1100 microns with deep guaranteed time 15 micronsakari fu-hyu survey data and spitzer guaranteed time data at 3.6-24 microns inthe lockman hole east. the akari data was analysed using bespoke software basedin part on the drizzling and minimum-variance matched filtering developed forshades, and was cross calibrated against infrared space observatory (iso)fluxes. our stacking analyses find akari 15um galaxies with &gt;~200 microjycontribute &gt;10% of the 450 micron background, but only &lt;4% of the 1100 micronbackground, suggesting that different populations contribute at mm-wavelengths.we confirm our earlier result that the ultra-deep 450 micron scuba-2 cosmologysurvey will be dominated by populations already detected by akari and spitzermid-infrared surveys. the superb mid-infrared wavelength coverage afforded bycombining spitzer and akari photometry is an excellent diagnostic of agncontributions, and we find that (23-52)% of submm-selected galaxies have agnbolometric fractions f_agn&gt;0.3.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2396	hermes: the submillimeter spectral energy distributions of  herschel/spire-detected galaxies	we present colours of sources detected with the herschel/spire instrument indeep extragalactic surveys of the lockman hole, spitzer-fls, and goods-n fieldsin three photometric bands at 250, 350 and 500 micrometers. we compare thesewith expectations from the literature and discuss associated uncertainties andbiases in the spire data. we identify a 500 micrometer flux limited selectionof sources from the hermes point source catalogue that appears free fromneighbouring/blended sources in all three spire bands. we compare the colourswith redshift tracks of various contemporary models. based on these spectraltemplates we show that regions corresponding to specific population types andredshifts can be identified better in colour-flux space. the redshift tracks aswell as the colour-flux plots imply a majority of detected objects withredshifts at 1&lt;z&lt;3.5, somewhat depending on the group of model seds used. wealso find that a population of s_250/s_350&lt;0.8 at fluxes above 50 mjy asobserved by spire is not well represented by contemporary models and couldconsist of a mix of cold and lensed galaxies.

1005.2409	the herschel-atlas: extragalactic number counts from 250 to 500 microns	aims. the herschel-atlas survey (h-atlas) will be the largest area survey tobe undertaken by the herschel space observatory. it will cover 550 sq. deg. ofextragalactic sky at wavelengths of 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500 microns whencompleted, reaching flux limits (5 sigma) from 32 to 145mjy. we here presentgalaxy number counts obtained for spire observations of the first ~14 sq. deg.observed at 250, 350 and 500 microns. methods. number counts are a fundamentaltool in constraining models of galaxy evolution. we use source catalogsextracted from the h-atlas maps as the basis for such an analysis. correctionfactors for completeness and flux boosting are derived by applying ourextraction method to model catalogs and then applied to the raw observationalcounts. results. we find a steep rise in the number counts at flux levels of100-200mjy in all three spire bands, consistent with results from blast. thecounts are compared to a range of galaxy evolution models. none of the currentmodels is an ideal fit to the data but all ascribe the steep rise to apopulation of luminous, rapidly evolving dusty galaxies at moderate to highredshift.

1005.2410	herschel atlas: the cosmic star formation history of quasar host  galaxies	we present a derivation of the star formation rate per comoving volume ofquasar host galaxies, derived from stacking analyses of far-infrared to mm-wavephotometry of quasars with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;6 and absolute i-band magnitudes-22&gt;i_ab&gt;-32. we use the science demonstration observations of the first ~16deg^2 from the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) inwhich there are 240 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and afurther 171 from the 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq) survey. we supplement thisdata with a compilation of data from iras, iso, spitzer, scuba and mambo.h-atlas alone statistically detects the quasars in its survey area at &gt;5sigmaat 250, 350 and 500um. from the compilation as a whole we find strikingevidence of downsizing in quasar host galaxy formation: low-luminosity quasarswith absolute magnitudes in the range -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 have a comoving starformation rate (derived from 100um rest-frame luminosities) peaking betweenredshifts of 1 and 2, while high-luminosity quasars with i_ab&lt;-26 have amaximum contribution to the star formation density at z~3. the volume-averagedstar formation rate of -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 quasars evolves as (1+z)^{2.3 +/- 0.7} atz&lt;2, but the evolution at higher luminosities is much faster reaching (1+z)^{10+/- 1} at -26&gt;i_ab&gt;-28. we tentatively interpret this as a combination of adeclining major merger rate with time and gas consumption reducing fuel forboth black hole accretion and star formation.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.3018	a search for debris disks in the herschel atlas	aims: we aim to demonstrate that the herschel atlas (h-atlas) is suitable fora blind and unbiased survey for debris disks by identifying candidate debrisdisks associated with main sequence stars in the initial science demonstrationfield of the survey. we show that h-atlas reveals a population offar-infrared/sub-mm sources that are associated with stars or star-like objectson the sdss main-sequence locus. we validate our approach by comparing theproperties of the most likely candidate disks to those of the known population.methods: we use a photometric selection technique to identify main sequencestars in the sdss dr7 catalogue and a bayesian likelihood ratio method toidentify h-atlas catalogue sources associated with these main sequence stars.following this photometric selection we apply distance cuts to identify themost likely candidate debris disks and rule out the presence of contaminatinggalaxies using ukidss las k-band images. results: we identify 78 h-atlassources associated with sdss point sources on the main-sequence locus, of whichtwo are the most likely debris disk candidates: h-atlas j090315.8 and h-atlasj090240.2. we show that they are plausible candidates by comparing theirproperties to the known population of debris disks. our initial resultsindicate that bright debris disks are rare, with only 2 candidates identifiedin a search sample of 851 stars. we also show that h-atlas can derive usefulupper limits for debris disks associated with hipparcos stars in the field andoutline the future prospects for our debris disk search programme.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1009.1058	evolution of dust temperature of galaxies through cosmic time as seen by  herschel	we study the dust properties of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2.8observed by the herschel space observatory in the field of the greatobservatories origins deep survey-north as part of pep and hermes keyprogrammes. infrared (ir) luminosity (l_ir) and dust temperature (t_dust) ofgalaxies are derived from the spectral energy distribution (sed) fit of thefar-infrared (fir) flux densities obtained with pacs and spire instrumentsonboard herschel. as a reference sample, we also obtain ir luminosities anddust temperatures of local galaxies at z&lt;0.1 using akari and iras data in thefield of the sloan digital sky survey. we compare the l_ir-t_dust relationbetween the two samples and find that: the median t_dust of herschel-selectedgalaxies at z&gt;0.5 with l_ir&gt;5x10^{10} l_\odot, appears to be 2-5 k colder thanthat of akari-selected local galaxies with similar luminosities; and thedispersion in t_dust for high-z galaxies increases with l_ir due to theexistence of cold galaxies that are not seen among local galaxies. we show thatthis large dispersion of the l_ir-t_dust relation can bridge the gap betweenlocal star-forming galaxies and high-z submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we alsofind that three smgs with very low t_dust (&lt;20 k) covered in this study haveclose neighbouring sources with similar 24-\mum brightness, which could lead toan overestimation of fir/(sub)millimeter fluxes of the smgs.

1010.5787	herschel-atlas: first data release of the science demonstration phase  source catalogues	the herschel-atlas is a survey of 550 square degrees with the herschel spaceobservatory in five far--infrared and submillimetre bands. the first data forthe survey, observations of a field 4x4 sq. degrees in size, were taken duringthe science demonstration phase, and reach a 5 sigma noise level of 33 mjy/beamat 250 microns. this paper describes the source extraction methods used tocreate the corresponding science demonstration phase catalogue, which contains6876 sources, selected at 250 microns, within ~14 sq. degrees. spire sourcesare extracted using a new method specifically developed for herschel data; pacscounterparts of these sources are identified using circular apertures placed atthe spire positions. aperture flux densities are measured for sourcesidentified as extended after matching to optical wavelengths. the reliabilityof this catalogue is also discussed, using full simulated maps at the threespire bands. these show that a significant number of sources at 350 and 500microns have undergone flux density enhancements of up to a factor of ~2, duemainly to source confusion. correction factors are determined for theseeffects. the sdp dataset and corresponding catalogue will be available fromhttp://www.h-atlas.org/.

1011.3048	which halos host herschel-atlas galaxies in the local universe?	we measure the projected cross-correlation between low redshift (z &lt; 0.5)far-ir selected galaxies in the sdp field of the herschel-atlas (h-atlas)survey and optically selected galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)redshift survey. in order to obtain robust correlation functions, we restrictthe analysis to a subset of 969 out of 6900 h-atlas galaxies, which havereliable optical counterparts with r&lt;19.4 mag and well-determined spectroscopicredshifts. the overlap region between the two surveys is 12.6 sq. deg; thematched sample has a median redshift of z ~ 0.2. the cross-correlation of gamaand h-atlas galaxies within this region can be fitted by a power law, withcorrelation length r_0 ~ 4.63 +/- 0.51 mpc. comparing with the correspondingauto-correlation function of gama galaxies within the sdp field yields arelative bias (averaged over 2-8 mpc) of h-atlas and gama galaxies of b_h/b_g ~0.6. combined with clustering measurements from previous optical studies, thisindicates that most of the low redshift h-atlas sources are hosted by haloswith masses comparable to that of the milky way. the correlation functionappears to depend on the 250 um luminosity, l_250, with bright (medianluminosity \nu l_250 ~ 1.6 x 10^10 l_sun) objects being somewhat more stronglyclustered than faint (\nu l_250 ~ 4.0 x 10^9 l_sun) objects. this implies thatgalaxies with higher dust-obscured star formation rates are hosted by moremassive halos.

1012.0305	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south - radio and  mid-infrared counterparts to submillimetre galaxies	we present radio and infrared (3.6-24um) counterparts to submillimetregalaxies (smgs) detected in the extended chandra deep field south with thelaboca 870-um bolometer camera on the 12-m atacama pathfinder experiment. usingthe very large array at 1.4ghz and spitzer we have identified securecounterparts to 79 of the 126 smgs (snr&gt;3.7, s_870&gt;4.4mjy) in the field, 62 viatheir radio and/or 24-um emission, the remainder using a colour-flux cut onirac 3.6- and 5.8-um sources chosen to maximise the number of secure,coincident radio and 24-um counterparts. in constructing our radio catalogue,we have corrected for the effects of `flux boosting', then used the correctedflux densities to estimate the redshifts of the smgs based on the radio/submmspectral indices. the effect of the boosting correction is to increase themedian redshift by 0.2 resulting in a value of z=2.2 (+0.7-0.8) (1-sigmaerrors) for the secure radio counterparts, in agreement with other studies,both spectroscopic and photometric.

1012.5186	herschel-atlas: rapid evolution of dust in galaxies in the last 5  billion years	we present the first direct and unbiased measurement of the evolution of thedust mass function of galaxies over the past 5 billion years of cosmic historyusing data from the science demonstration phase of the herschel-atlas. thesample consists of galaxies selected at 250{\mu}m which have reliablecounterparts from sdss at z &lt; 0.5, and contains 1867 sources. dust masses arecalculated using both a single temperature grey-body model for the spectralenergy distribution and also using a model with multiple temperaturecomponents. the dust temperature for either model shows no trend with redshift.splitting the sample into bins of redshift reveals a strong evolution in thedust properties of the most massive galaxies. at z = 0.4 - 0.5, massivegalaxies had dust masses about five times larger than in the local universe. atthe same time, the dust-to-stellar mass ratio was about 3-4 times larger, andthe optical depth derived from fitting the uv-sub-mm data with an energybalance model was also higher. this increase in the dust content of massivegalaxies at high redshift is difficult to explain using standard dust evolutionmodels and requires a rapid gas consumption timescale together with either amore top-heavy imf, efficient mantle growth, less dust destruction orcombinations of all three. this evolution in dust mass is likely to beassociated with a change in overall ism mass, and points to an enhanced supplyof fuel for star formation at earlier cosmic epochs.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1101.4796	hermes: detection of cosmic magnification of sub-mm galaxies using  angular cross-correlation	cosmic magnification is due to the weak gravitational lensing of sources inthe distant universe by foreground large-scale structure leading to coherentchanges in the observed number density of the background sources. depending onthe slope of the background source number counts, cosmic magnification causes acorrelation between the background and foreground galaxies, which is unexpectedin the absence of lensing if the two populations are spatially disjoint.previous attempts using submillimetre (sub-mm) sources have been hampered bysmall number statistics. the large number of sources detected in the {\itherschel} multi-tiered extra-galactic survey (hermes) lockman-swire fieldenables us to carry out the first robust study of the cross-correlation betweensub-mm sources and sources at lower redshifts. using ancillary data we compiletwo low-redshift samples from sdss and swire with &lt;z&gt; ~ 0.2 and 0.4,respectively, and cross-correlate with two sub-mm samples based on flux densityand colour criteria, selecting galaxies preferentially at z ~ 2. we detectcross-correlation on angular scales between ~1 and 50 arcmin and find clearevidence that this is primarily due to cosmic magnification. a small, butnon-negligible signal from intrinsic clustering is likely to be present due tothe tails of the redshift distribution of the sub-mm sources overlapping withthose of the foreground samples.

1103.3080	gama/h-atlas: the ultraviolet spectral slope and obscuration in galaxies	we use multiwavelength data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) andherschel atlas (h-atlas) surveys to compare the relationship between variousdust obscuration measures in galaxies. we explore the connections between theultraviolet (uv) spectral slope, $\beta$, the balmer decrement, and the farinfrared (ir) to $150\,$nm far ultraviolet (fuv) luminosity ratio. we exploretrends with galaxy mass, star formation rate (sfr) and redshift in order toidentify possible systematics in these various measures. we reiterate thefinding of other authors that there is a large scatter between the balmerdecrement and the $\beta$ parameter, and that $\beta$ may be poorly constrainedwhen derived from only two broad passbands in the uv. we also emphasise thatfuv derived sfrs, corrected for dust obscuration using $\beta$, will beoverestimated unless a modified relation between $\beta$ and the attenuationfactor is used. even in the optimum case, the resulting sfrs have a significantscatter, well over an order of magnitude. while there is a stronger correlationbetween the ir to fuv luminosity ratio and $\beta$ parameter than with thebalmer decrement, neither of these correlations are particularly tight, anddust corrections based on $\beta$ for high redshift galaxy sfrs must be treatedwith caution. we conclude with a description of the extent to which thedifferent obscuration measures are consistent with each other as well as theeffects of including other galactic properties on these correlations.

1103.3905	herschel-atlas: the link between accretion luminosity and star formation  in quasar host galaxies	we use the science demonstration field data of the herschel-atlas to studyhow star formation, traced by the far-infrared herschel data, is related toboth the accretion luminosity and redshift of quasars selected from the sloandigital sky survey and the 2slaq survey. by developing a maximum likelihoodestimator to investigate the presence of correlations between the far-infraredand optical luminosities we find evidence that the star-formation in quasarhosts is correlated with both redshift and quasar accretion luminosity.assuming a relationship of the form l_ir \propto l_qso^{\theta} (1 +z)^{\zeta}, we find {\theta} = 0.22 +/- 0.08 and {\zeta} = 1.6 +/- 0.4,although there is substantial additional uncertainty in {\zeta} of order +/- 1,due to uncertainties in the host galaxy dust temperature. we find evidence fora large intrinsic dispersion in the redshift dependence, but no evidence forintrinsic dispersion in the correlation between l_qso and l_ir, suggesting thatthe latter may be due to a direct physical connection between star formationand black hole accretion. this is consistent with the idea that both the quasaractivity and star formation are dependent on the same reservoir of cold gas, sothat they are both affected by the influx of cold gas during mergers or heatingof gas via feedback processes.

1104.1758	the potential influence of far-infrared emission lines on the selection  of high-redshift galaxies	we investigate whether strong molecular and atomic emission lines atfar-infrared wavelengths can influence the identification and derivedproperties of galaxies selected from broad-band, far-infrared or submillimetreobservations. several of these lines, e.g. [cii]158um, have been found to bevery bright in some high-redshift galaxies, with fluxes of &gt;0.1-1% of the totalfar-infrared luminosity, and may be even brighter in certain populations athigh redshifts. at redshifts where these lines fall in instrument pass-bandsthey can significantly increase the broad-band flux measurements. we estimatethat the contributions from line emission could boost the apparent broad-bandflux by &gt;20-40% in the herschel and scuba-2 bands. combined with the steepsource counts in the submillimetre and far-infrared bands, line contaminationhas potentially significant consequences for the properties of sources detectedin flux-limited continuum surveys, biasing the derived redshift distributionsand bolometric luminosities. indeed, it is possible that some z&gt;4 sources foundin 850-um surveys are being identified in part due to line contamination fromstrong [cii] emission. these biases may be even stronger for less-luminous andlower-metallicity populations at high redshifts which are observable with almaand which may have even stronger line-to-continuum ratios.

1104.4113	discovery of a multiply-lensed submillimeter galaxy in early hermes  herschel/spire data	we report the discovery of a bright ($f(250\mum) &gt; 400$ mjy), multiply-lensedsubmillimeter galaxy \obj\ in {\it  herschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the hermes project.interferometric 880\mum\ submillimeter array observations resolve at least fourimages with a large separation of $\sim 9\arcsec$. a high-resolution adaptiveoptics $k_p$ image with keck/nirc2 clearly shows strong lensing arcs. follow-upspectroscopy gives a redshift of $z=2.9575$, and the lensing model gives atotal magnification of $\mu \sim 11 \pm 1$. the large image separation allowsus to study the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (sed) of thelensed source unobscured by the central lensing mass. thefar-ir/millimeter-wave sed is well described by a modified blackbody fit withan unusually warm dust temperature, $88 \pm 3$ k. we derive a lensing-correctedtotal ir luminosity of $(1.43 \pm 0.09) \times 10^{13}\, \mathrm{l}_{\odot}$,implying a star formation rate of $\sim 2500\, \mathrm{m}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. however, models primarily developed from brighter galaxiesselected at longer wavelengths are a poor fit to the full optical-to-millimetersed. a number of other strongly lensed systems have already been discovered inearly {\it herschel} data, and many more are expected as additional data arecollected.

1104.4115	redshift determination and co line excitation modeling for the  multiply-lensed galaxy hlsw-01	we report on the redshift measurement and co line excitation of hermesj105751.1+573027 (hlsw-01), a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy discoveredin herschel/spire observations as part of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). hlsw-01 is an ultra-luminous galaxy with anintrinsic far-infrared luminosity of 1.4x10^(13) solar luminosities, and islensed by a massive group of galaxies into at least four images with a totalmagnification of 10.9+/-0.7. with the 100 ghz instantaneous bandwidth of thez-spec instrument on the caltech submillimeter observatory, we robustlyidentify a redshift of z=2.958+/-0.007 for this source, using the simultaneousdetection of four co emission lines (j = 7-6, j = 8-7, j = 9-8, and j = 10-9).combining the measured line fluxes for these high-j transitions with the j =1-0, j = 3-2 and j = 5-4 line fluxes measured with the green bank telescope,the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy, and the plateau debure interferometer, respectively, we model the physical properties of themolecular gas in this galaxy. we find that the full co spectral line energydistribution is well described by warm, moderate-density gas with tkin = 86-235k and n(h2) = (1.1-3.5)x10^3 cm^(-3). however, it is possible that thehighest-j transitions are tracing a small fraction of very dense gas inmolecular cloud cores, and two-component models that include a warm/densemolecular gas phase with tkin ~ 200 k, n(h2) ~ 10^5 cm^(-3) are also consistentwith these data. higher signal-to-noise measurements of the j(upper) &gt; 7transitions with high spectral resolution, combined with high spatialresolution co maps, are needed to improve our understanding of the gasexcitation, morphology, and dynamics of this interesting high-redshift galaxy.

1104.4119	modeling of the hermes j105751.1+573027 submillimeter source lensed by a  dark matter dominated foreground group of galaxies	we present the results of a gravitational lensing analysis of the bright$\zs=2.957$ sub-millimeter galaxy (smg), hermes j105751.1+573027 found in {\itherschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes) project. the high resolution imaging available inoptical and near-ir channels, along with co emission obtained with the plateaude bure interferometer, allow us to precisely estimate the intrinsic sourceextension and hence estimate the total lensing magnification to be $\mu=10.9\pm0.7$. we measure the half-light radius $r_{\rm eff}$ of the source in therest-frame near-uv and $v$ bands that characterize the unobscured light comingfrom stars and find $r_{\rm eff,*}= [2.0 \pm 0.1]$ kpc, in good agreement withrecent studies on the submillimeter galaxy population. this lens model is alsoused to estimate the size of the gas distribution ($r_{\rm eff,gas}=[1.1\pm0.5]$) kpc by mapping back in the source plane the co (j=5-4) transitionline emission. the lens modeling yields a relatively large einstein radius$r_{\rm ein}= 4\farcs10 \pm 0\farcs02$, corresponding to a deflector velocitydispersion of [$483\pm 16] \,\kms$. this shows that hermes j105751.1+573027 islensed by a {\it galaxy group-size} dark matter halo at redshift $\zl\sim 0.6$.the projected dark matter contribution largely dominates the mass budget withinthe einstein radius with $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm ein})\sim 80%$. this fractionreduces to $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm eff,g1}\simeq 4.5\kpc)\sim 47%$ within theeffective radius of the main deflecting galaxy of stellar mass $m_{\rm*,g1}=[8.5\pm 1.6] \times 10^{11}\msun$. at this smaller scale the dark matterfraction is consistent with results already found for massive lensingellipticals at $z\sim0.2$ from the slacs survey.

1105.3199	herschel-atlas: detection of a far-infrared population around galaxy  clusters	we report the detection of a significant excess in the surface density offar-infrared sources from the herschel-astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) within ~1 mpc of the centres of 66 optically-selected clustersof galaxies in the sdss with &lt;z&gt;~0.25. from the analysis of the multiwavelengthproperties of their counterparts we conclude that the far-infrared emission isassociated with dust-obscured star formation and/or active galactic nucleiwithin galaxies in the clusters themselves. the excess reaches a maximum at aradius of ~0.8 mpc, where we find 1.0\pm0.3 s_250um&gt;34 mjy sources on averageper cluster above what would be expected for random field locations. if thefar-infrared emission is dominated by star formation (as opposed to agn) thenthis corresponds to an average star formation rate of ~7 m_sun/yr per clusterin sources with l_ir&gt;5d10 l_sun. although lensed sources make a negligiblecontribution to the excess signal, a fraction of the sources around theclusters could be gravitationally lensed, and we have identified a sample ofpotential cases of cluster-lensed herschel sources that could be targeted infollow-up studies.

1105.3924	physical conditions of the interstellar medium of high-redshift,  strongly lensed submillimetre galaxies from the herschel-atlas	we present herschel-spire fourier transform spectrometer (fts) and radiofollow-up observations of two herschel-atlas (h-atlas) detected strongly lenseddistant galaxies. in one of the targeted galaxies h-atlas j090311.6+003906(sdp.81) we detect [oiii] 88\mum and [cii] 158\mum lines at a signal-to-noiseratio of ~5. we do not have any positive line identification in the otherfainter target h-atlas j091305.0-005343 (sdp.130). currently sdp.81 is thefaintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the fts, withcontinuum flux just below 200 mjy in the 200-600 \mum wavelength range. thederived redshift of sdp.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 +/-0.012, inagreement with ground-based co measurements. this is the first detection byherschel of the [oiii] 88\mum line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05.comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociationregion (pdr) models with different physical conditions, we derive the pdr clouddensity n ~ 2000 cm^{-3} and the far-uv ionizing radiation field g_0 ~ 200 (inunits of the habing field -- the local galactic interstellar radiation field of1.6x10^{-6} w/m^2). using the co derived molecular mass and the pdr propertieswe estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. thesecharacteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. the radioobservations indicate that sdp.81 deviates significantly from the localfir/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission iscoming from an agn. the constraints on the source size from millimiter-waveobservations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible agncontribution to less than 33%. these indications, together with the high[oiii]/fir ratio and the upper limit of [oi] 63\mum/[cii] 158\mum suggest thatsome fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an agn.

1107.1373	herschel/hermes: the x-ray - infrared correlation for star-forming  galaxies at z~1	for the first time, we investigate the x-ray/infrared (ir) correlation forstar-forming galaxies at z~1, using spire submm data from the recently-launchedherschel space observatory and deep x-ray data from the 2ms chandra deep fieldnorth (cdfn) survey. we examine the x-ray/ir correlation in the soft x-ray (sx,0.5-2 kev) and hard x-ray (hx, 2-10 kev) bands by comparing our z~1spire-detected star-forming galaxies (sfgs) to equivalently ir-luminous (l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) samples in the local/low redshift universe. our results suggestthat the x-ray/ir properties of the spire sfgs are on average similar to thoseof their local counterparts, as we find no evidence for evolution in thel_sx/l_ir and l_hx/l_ir ratios with redshift. we note however, that at allredshifts, both l_sx/l_ir and l_hx/l_ir are strongly dependent on irluminosity, with luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs andulirgs,l_ir &gt;10^11 l_sun) having up to an order of magnitude lower values thannormal infrared galaxies (l_ir &lt;10^11 l_sun). we derive a l_sx-l_ir relationand confirm the applicability of an existing l_hx-l_ir relation for both localand distant lirgs and ulirgs, consistent with a scenario where x-ray luminosityis correlated with the star-formation rate (sfr).

1107.4979	observation of h2o in a strongly lensed herschel-atlas source at z=2.3	the herschel survey, h-atlas, with its large areal coverage, has recentlydiscovered a number of bright, strongly lensed high-z submillimeter galaxies.the strong magnification makes it possible to study molecular species otherthan co, which are otherwise difficult to observe in high-z galaxies. among thelensed galaxies already identified by h-atlas, the source j090302.9-014127b(sdp.17b) at z = 2.305 is remarkable due to its excitation conditions and atentative detection of the h2o 202-111 emission line (lupu et al. 2010). wereport observations of this line in sdp.17b using the iram interferometerequipped with its new 277- 371ghz receivers. the h2o line is detected at aredshift of z = 2.3049+/-0.0006, with a flux of 7.8+/-0.5 jy km s-1 and a fwhmof 250+/-60 km s-1. the new flux is 2.4 times weaker than the previoustentative detection, although both remain marginally consistent within1.6-sigma. the intrinsic line luminosity and ratio of h2o(202-111)/co8-7 seemcomparable with those of the nearby starburst/enshrouded-agn mrk 231,suggesting that sdp.17b could also host a luminous agn. the detection of astrong h2o 202-111 line in sdp.17b implies an efficient excitation mechanism ofthe water levels that must occur in very dense and warm interstellar gas.

1108.3911	herschel-atlas galaxy counts and high redshift luminosity functions: the  formation of massive early type galaxies	exploiting the herschel-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp) survey data,we have determined the luminosity functions (lfs) at rest-frame wavelengths of100 and 250 micron and at several redshifts z&gt;1, for bright sub-mm galaxieswith star formation rates (sfr) &gt;100 m_sun/yr. we find that the evolution ofthe comoving lf is strong up to z~2.5, and slows down at higher redshifts. fromthe lfs and the information on halo masses inferred from clustering analysis,we derived an average relation between sfr and halo mass (and its scatter). wealso infer that the timescale of the main episode of dust-enshrouded starformation in massive halos (m_h&gt;3*10^12 m_sun) amounts to ~7*10^8 yr. given thesfrs, which are in the range 10^2-10^3 m_sun/yr, this timescale implies finalstellar masses of order of 10^11-10^12 m_sun. the corresponding stellar massfunction matches the observed mass function of passively evolving galaxies atz&gt;1. the comparison of the statistics for sub-mm and uv selected galaxiessuggests that the dust-free, uv bright phase, is &gt;10^2 times shorter than thesub-mm bright phase, implying that the dust must form soon after the onset ofstar formation. using a single reference spectral energy distribution (sed; theone of the z~2.3 galaxy smm j2135-0102), our simple physical model is able toreproduce not only the lfs at different redshifts &gt; 1 but also the counts atwavelengths ranging from 250 micron to ~1 mm. owing to the steepness of thecounts and their relatively broad frequency range, this result suggests thatthe dispersion of sub-mm seds of z&gt;1 galaxies around the reference one israther small.

1108.4037	ultra steep spectrum radio sources in the lockman hole: servs  identifications and redshift distribution at the faintest radio fluxes	ultra steep spectrum (uss) radio sources have been successfully used toselect powerful radio sources at high redshifts (z&gt;~2). typically restricted tolarge-sky surveys and relatively bright radio flux densities, it has graduallybecome possible to extend the uss search to sub-mjy levels, thanks to therecent appearance of sensitive low-frequency radio facilities. here a firstdetailed analysis of the nature of the faintest uss sources is presented. byusing giant metrewave radio telescope and very large array radio observationsof the lockman hole at 610 mhz and 1.4 ghz, a sample of 58 uss sources, with610 mhz integrated fluxes above 100 microjy, is assembled. deep infrared dataat 3.6 and 4.5 micron from the spitzer extragalactic representative volumesurvey (servs) is used to reliably identify counterparts for 48 (83%) of thesesources, showing an average total magnitude of [3.6](ab)=19.8 mag.spectroscopic redshifts for 14 uss sources, together with photometric redshiftestimates, improved by the use of the deep servs data, for a further 19objects, show redshifts ranging from z=0.1 to z=2.8, peaking at z~0.6 andtailing off at high redshifts. the remaining 25 uss sources, with no redshiftestimate, include the faintest [3.6] magnitudes, with 10 sources undetected at3.6 and 4.5 micron (typically [3.6]&gt;22-23 mag, from local measurements), whichsuggests the likely existence of higher redshifts among the sub-mjy usspopulation. the comparison with the square kilometre array design studiessimulated skies models indicate that fanaroff-riley type i radio sources andradio-quiet active galactic nuclei may constitute the bulk of the faintest usspopulation, and raises the possibility that the high efficiency of the usstechnique for the selection of high redshift sources remains even at thesub-mjy level.

1109.2887	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: spire-mm photometric  redshifts	we investigate the potential of submm-mm and submm-mm-radio photometricredshifts using a sample of mm-selected sources as seen at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m by the spire instrument on herschel. from a sample of 63 previouslyidentified mm-sources with reliable radio identifications in the goods-n andlockman hole north fields 46 (73 per cent) are found to have detections in atleast one spire band. we explore the observed submm/mm colour evolution withredshift, finding that the colours of mm-sources are adequately described by amodified blackbody with constant optical depth {\tau} = ({\nu}/{\nu}0)^{\beta}where {\beta} = +1.8 and {\nu}0 = c/100 {\mu}m. we find a tight correlationbetween dust temperature and ir luminosity. using a single model of the dusttemperature and ir luminosity relation we derive photometric redshift estimatesfor the 46 spire detected mm-sources. testing against the 22 sources with knownspectroscopic, or good quality optical/near-ir photometric, redshifts we findsubmm/mm photometric redshifts offer a redshift accuracy of |z|/(1+z) = 0.16 (&lt;|z| &gt;= 0.51). including constraints from the radio-far ir correlation theaccuracy is improved to |z|/(1 + z) = 0.15 (&lt; |z| &gt;= 0.45). we estimate theredshift distribution of mm-selected sources finding a significant excess at z&gt; 3 when compared to ~ 850 {\mu}m selected samples.

1109.6274	h-atlas/gama: dusty early-type galaxies and passive spirals	we present the dust properties and star-formation histories of localsubmillimetre-selected galaxies in herschel-atlas, classified by opticalmorphology. the early-type galaxies (etgs) that are detected contain as muchdust as typical spirals, and form a unique sample that has been blindlyselected at submillimetre wavelengths.  comparing h-atlas galaxies to a control sample of optically selectedgalaxies, we find 5.5% of luminous etgs are detected in h-atlas. the h-atlasetgs contain a significant mass of cold dust: the mean dust mass is 5.5x10^7msun, with individual galaxies ranging from 9x10^5-4x10^8 msun. this iscomparable to that of spirals in our sample, and is an order of magnitude moredust than that found for the control etgs, which have a median dust massinferred from stacking of (0.8-4.0)x10^6 msun. the etgs detected in h-atlashave bluer nuv-r colours, higher specific star-formation rates and youngerstellar populations than etgs which are optically selected, and may betransitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence. we also find thath-atlas and control etgs inhabit similar low-density environments. we concludethat the dust in h-atlas and control etgs cannot be solely from stellarsources, and a large contribution from dust formed in the ism or externalsources is required. alternatively, dust destruction may not be as efficient aspredicted.  we also explore the properties of the most passive spiral galaxies in oursample with ssfr&lt;10^-11/yr. we find these passive spirals have lowerdust-to-stellar mass ratios, higher stellar masses and older stellar populationages than normal spirals. the passive spirals inhabit low density environmentssimilar to those of the normal spiral galaxies in our sample. this shows thatthe processes which turn spirals passive do not occur solely in theintermediate density environments of group and cluster outskirts.

1112.3653	spitzer irac identification of herschel-atlas spire sources	we use spitzer-irac data to identify near-infrared counterparts tosubmillimeter galaxies detected with herschel-spire at 250um in the herschelastrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas). using a likelihood ratioanalysis we identify 146 reliable irac counterparts to 123 spire sources out ofthe 159. we find that, compared to the field population, the spire counterpartsoccupy a distinct region of 3.6 and 4.5um color-magnitude space, and we usethis property to identify a further 23 counterparts to 13 spire sources. theirac identification rate of 86% is significantly higher than those that havebeen demonstrated with wide-field ground-based optical and near-ir imaging ofherschel fields. we estimate a false identification rate of 3.6%, correspondingto 4 to 5 sources. among the 73 counterparts that are undetected in sdss, 57have both 3.6 and 4.5um coverage. of these 43 have [3.6] - [4.5]&gt; 0 indicatingthat they are likely to be at z &gt; 1.4. thus, ~ 40% of identified spire galaxiesare likely to be high redshift (z &gt; 1.4) sources. we discuss the statisticalproperties of the irac-identified spire galaxy sample including far-irluminosities, dust temperatures, star-formation rates, and stellar masses. themajority of our detected galaxies have 10^10 to 10^11 l_sun total irluminosities and are not intense starbursting galaxies as those found at z ~ 2,but they have a factor of 2 to 3 above average specific star-formation ratescompared to near-ir selected galaxy samples.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1202.0402	herschel-atlas: towards a sample of ~1000 strongly-lensed galaxies	while the selection of strongly lensed galaxies with 500{\mu}m flux densitys_500&gt;100 mjy has proven to be rather straightforward (negrello et al. 2010),for many applications it is important to analyze samples larger than the onesobtained when confining ourselves to such a bright limit. moreover, only byprobing to fainter flux densities is possible to exploit strong lensing toinvestigate the bulk of the high-z star-forming galaxy population. we describehalos (the herschel-atlas lensed objects selection), a method for efficientlyselecting fainter candidate strongly lensed galaxies, reaching a surfacedensity of ~1.5-2 deg^-2, i.e. a factor of about 4 to 6 higher than that at the100 mjy flux limit. halos will allow the selection of up to ~1000 candidatestrongly lensed galaxies (with amplifications \mu&gt;2) over the full h-atlassurvey area. applying halos to the h-atlas science demonstration phase field(~14.4 deg^2) we find 31 candidate strongly lensed galaxies, whose candidatelenses are identified in the viking near-infrared catalog. using the availableinformation on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a~72% purity of the sample. the redshift distribution of the candidate lensedsources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensedgalaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to substantially higherredshifts than found in the other surveys. the counts of candidate stronglylensed galaxies are also in good agreement with model predictions (lapi et al.2011). even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infraredviking photometry, we show that h-atlas data alone allow the selection of asimilarly deep sample of candidate strongly lensed galaxies with an efficiencyclose to 50%; a slightly lower surface density (~1.45 deg^-2) can be reachedwith a ~70% efficiency.

1202.0761	a herschel view of the far-infrared properties of submillimetre galaxies	we study a sample of 61 submillimetre galaxies (smgs) selected fromground-based surveys, with known spectroscopic redshifts and observed withherschel as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key programmes. we use the broadfar-infrared wavelength coverage (100-600um) provided by the combination ofpacs and spire observations. using a power-law temperature distribution modelto derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dustemissivity spectral index for smgs of beta=2.0+/-0.2. our results unveil thediversity of the smg population. some smgs exhibit extreme infraredluminosities of ~10^13 lsun and relatively warm dust components, while othersare fainter (~10^12 lsun) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. theextreme infrared luminosities of some smgs (lir&gt;10^12.7 lsun, 26/61 systems)imply sfrs of &gt;500msun yr^-1. such high sfrs are difficult to reconcile with asecular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-drivenstage in the evolution of these galaxies. another observational argument infavour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than thatof smgs of lower luminosities (~40k as opposed to ~25k), consistent withobservations of local ulirgs triggered by major mergers and with results fromhydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfercalculations. luminous smgs are also offset from normal star-forming galaxiesin the stellar mass-sfr plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburstevents with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. onthe other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity smgs havecold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of starformation, and thus might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation.[abridged]

1203.2562	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: hermes	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey, hermes, is a legacy programdesigned to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. fields range insize from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using herschel-spire (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),and herschel-pacs (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of270 deg^2 with spire alone. these bands cover the peak of the redshiftedthermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capturethe re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation thathas been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a completemulti-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.  the survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of thebest studied fields in the sky. additionally, hermes is closely coordinatedwith the pacs evolutionary probe survey. making maximum use of the fullspectrum of ancillary data, from radio to x-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; andunderstand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and otherprocesses. scientific questions hermes will be used to answer include: thetotal infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populationsof galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statisticaltechniques.  this paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines theprimary scientific goals of the hermes team, and reviews some of the earlyresults.

1203.5828	connecting stellar mass and star-formation rate to dark matter halo mass  out to z ~ 2	we have constructed an extended halo model (ehm) which relates the totalstellar mass and star-formation rate (sfr) to halo mass (m_h). an empiricalrelation between the distribution functions of total stellar mass of galaxiesand host halo mass, tuned to match the spatial density of galaxies over 0&lt;z&lt;2and the clustering properties at z~0, is extended to include two differentscenarios describing the variation of sfr on m_h. we also present newmeasurements of the redshift evolution of the average sfr for star-forminggalaxies of different stellar mass up to z=2, using data from the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) for infrared-bright galaxies.  combining the ehm with the halo accretion histories from numericalsimulations, we trace the stellar mass growth and star-formation history inhalos spanning a range of masses. we find that: (1) the intensity of thestar-forming activity in halos in the probed mass range has steadily decreasedfrom z~2 to 0; (2) at a given epoch, halos in the mass range between a fewtimes 10^{11} m_sun and a few times 10^{12} m_sun are the most efficient athosting star formation; (3) the peak of sfr density shifts to lower mass halosover time; (4) galaxies that are forming stars most actively at z~2 evolve intoquiescent galaxies in today's group environments, strongly supporting previousclaims that the most powerful starbursts at z~2 are progenitors of today'selliptical galaxies.

1205.1929	mining the herschel-atlas: submillimeter-selected blazars in equatorial  fields	the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) provides anunprecedented opportunity to search for blazars at sub-mm wavelengths. wecross-matched the first radio source catalogue with the 11655 sources brighterthan 35 mjy at 500{\mu}m in the \sim 135 square degrees of the sky covered bythe h-atlas equatorial fields at 9 h and 15 h, plus half of the field at 12 h.we found that 379 of the h-atlas sources have a first counterpart within 10arcsec, including 8 catalogued blazars (plus one known blazar that was found atthe edge of one the h-atlas maps). to search for additional blazar candidateswe have devised new diagnostic diagrams and found that known blazars occupy aregion of the log(s500{\mu}m/s350{\mu}m) vs. log(s500{\mu}m/s1.4ghz) planeseparated from that of the other sub-mm sources with radio counterparts. usingthis diagnostic we have selected 12 further candidates that turn out to bescattered in the (r-z) vs. (u-r) plane or in the wise colour-colour diagramproposed by massaro et al. (2012), where known blazars are concentrated in welldefined strips. this suggests that the majority of them either are not blazarsor have spectral energy distributions contaminated by their host galaxies. asignificant fraction of true blazars are found to be hosted by star-forminggalaxies. this finding, supported by an analysis of blazars detected in planck545 and 857 ghz bands, is at odds with the notion that blazar hosts are passiveellipticals and indicates that the sub-mm selection is providing a novelprospect on blazar properties. based on an inspection of the availablephotometric data, including the wise all-sky survey, the unpublished vikingsurvey and new radio observations, we tentatively estimate that there are 11blazars with synchrotron flux density s500{\mu}m &gt; 35mjy over the consideredarea. this result already allows us to constrain blazar evolution models.

1205.2370	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields - ii.  identifications, redshifts, and evidence for large-scale structure	the aztec 1.1 mm survey of the scuba half degree extragalactic survey(shades) fields is the largest (0.7 deg2) blank-field millimetre-wavelengthsurvey undertaken to date at a resolution of ~18" and a depth of ~1 mjy. wehave used the deep optical-to-radio multi-wavelength data in the shades lockmanhole east and sxdf/uds fields to obtain galaxy identifications for ~64% (~80%with tentative identifications) of the 148 aztec-shades 1.1 mm sources,exploiting deep radio and 24 um data complemented by methods based on 8 umflux-density and red optical-infrared (i-k) colour. this unusually highidentification rate can be attributed to the relatively brightmillimetre-wavelength flux-density threshold, combined with the relatively deepsupporting multi-frequency data. we have further exploited theoptical-mid-infrared-radio data to derive a ~60% (~75% with tentativeidentifications) complete redshift distribution for the aztec-shades sources,yielding a median redshift of z~2.2, with a high-redshift tail extending to atleast z~4. despite the larger area probed by the aztec survey relative to theoriginal scuba shades imaging, the redshift distribution of the aztec sourcesis consistent with that displayed by the scuba sources, and reinforcestentative evidence that the redshift distribution of mm/sub-mm sources in thelockman hole field is significantly different from that found in the sxdf/udsfield. comparison with simulated surveys of similar scale extracted fromsemi-analytic models based on the millennium simulation indicates that this isas expected if the mm/sub-mm sources are massive (m&gt;10^11 mo) star-forminggalaxies tracing large-scale structures over scales of 10-20 mpc. this confirmsthe importance of surveys covering several square degrees (as now underway withscuba2) to obtain representative samples of bright (sub)mm-selected galaxies.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

1206.5821	rapid coeval black hole and host galaxy growth in mrc 1138-262: the  hungry spider	we present a detailed study of the infrared spectral energy distribution ofthe high-redshift radio galaxy mrc 1138-26 at z = 2.156, also known as thespiderweb galaxy. by combining photometry from spitzer, herschel and laboca wefit the rest-frame 5-300 um emission using a two component, starburst andactive galactic nucleus (agn), model. the total infrared (8 - 1000 um)luminosity of this galaxy is (1.97+/-0.28)x10^13 lsun with (1.17+/-0.27) and(0.79+/-0.09)x10^13 lsun due to the agn and starburst components respectively.the high derived agn accretion rate of \sim20% eddington, and the measured starformation rate (sfr) of 1390pm150 msun/yr, suggest that this massive system isin a special phase of rapid central black hole and host galaxy growth, likelycaused by a gas rich merger in a dense environment. the accretion rate issufficient to power both the jets and the previously observed large outflow.the high sfr and strong outflow suggest this galaxy could potentially exhaustits fuel for stellar growth in a few tens of myr, although the likely merger ofthe radio galaxy with nearby satellites suggest bursts of star formation mayrecur again on time scales of several hundreds of myr. the age of the radiolobes implies the jet started after the current burst of star formation, andtherefore we are possibly witnessing the transition from a merger-inducedstarburst phase to a radio-loud agn phase. we also note tentative evidence for[cii]158um emission. this paper marks the first results from the herschelgalaxy evolution project (project herge), a systematic study of theevolutionary state of 71 high redshift, 1 &lt; z &lt; 5.2, radio galaxies.

1209.0670	herschel-atlas: the far-infrared properties and star-formation rates of  broad absorption line quasi-stellar objects	we have used data from the herschel-atlas at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m todetermine the far-infrared (fir) properties of 50 broad absorption line quasars(bal qsos). our sample contains 49 high-ionization bal qsos (hibals) and 1low-ionization bal qso (lobal) which are compared against a sample of 329non-bal qsos. these samples are matched over the redshift range 1.5 \leq z &lt;2.3 and in absolute i-band magnitude over the range -28 \leq m_{i} \leq -24. ofthese, 3 bal qsos (hibals) and 27 non-bal qsos are detected at the &gt; 5 sigmalevel. we calculate star-formation rates (sfr) for our individually detectedhibal qsos and the non-detected lobal qso as well as average sfrs for the baland non-bal qso samples based on stacking the herschel data. we find nodifference between the hibal and non-bal qso samples in the fir, even whenseparated based on differing bal qso classifications. using mrk 231 as atemplate, the weighted mean sfr is estimated to be \approx240\pm21 m_{\odot}yr^{-1} for the full sample, although this figure should be treated as an upperlimit if agn-heated dust makes a contribution to the fir emission. despitetentative claims in the literature, we do not find a dependence of {\sc c\,iv}equivalent width on fir emission, suggesting that the strength of any outflowin these objects is not linked to their fir output. these results stronglysuggest that bal qsos (more specifically hibals) can be accommodated within asimple agn unified scheme in which our line-of-sight to the nucleus intersectsoutflowing material. models in which hibals are caught towards the end of aperiod of enhanced spheroid and black-hole growth, during which a windterminates the star-formation activity, are not supported by the observed firproperties.

1211.4336	hermes: unveiling obscured star formation - the far infrared luminosity  function of ultraviolet-selected galaxies at z~1.5	we study the far-infrared (ir) and sub-millimeter properties of a sample ofultraviolet (uv) selected galaxies at z\sim1.5. using stacking at 250, 350 and500 um from herschel space observatory spire imaging of the cosmos fieldobtained within the hermes key program, we derive the mean ir luminosity as afunction of both uv luminosity and slope of the uv continuum beta. the ir to uvluminosity ratio is roughly constant over most of the uv luminosity range weexplore. we also find that the ir to uv luminosity ratio is correlated withbeta. we observe a correlation that underestimates the correlation derived fromlow-redshift starburst galaxies, but is in good agreement with the correlationderived from local normal star-forming galaxies. using these results wereconstruct the ir luminosity function of our uv-selected sample. thisluminosity function recovers the ir luminosity functions measured from irselected samples at the faintest luminosities (lir ~ 10^{11} l_sun), but mightunderestimate them at the bright-end (lir &gt; 5.10^{11} l_sun). for galaxies with10^{11}&lt;lir/l_sun&lt;10^{13}, the ir luminosity function of a uv selectionrecovers (given the differences in ir-based estimates) 52-65 to 89-112 per centof the star-formation rate density derived from an ir selection. the cosmicstar-formation rate density derived from this ir luminosity function is 61-76to 100-133 per cent of the density derived from ir selections at the sameepoch. assuming the latest herschel results and conservative stackingmeasurements, we use a toy model to fully reproduce the far ir luminosityfunction from our uv selection at z\sim 1.5. this suggests that a sample around4 magnitudes deeper (i.e. reaching u \sim 30 mag) and a large dispersion of their to uv luminosity ratio are required.

1302.4436	herschel-atlas: a binary hylirg pinpointing a cluster of starbursting  proto-ellipticals	panchromatic observations of the best candidate hylirg from the widestherschel extragalactic imaging survey have led to the discovery of at leastfour intrinsically luminous z=2.41 galaxies across a ~100-kpc region - acluster of starbursting proto-ellipticals. via sub-arcsecond interferometricimaging we have measured accurate gas and star-formation surface densities. thetwo brightest galaxies span ~3 kpc fwhm in submm/radio continuum and co j=4-3,and double that in co j=1-0. the broad co line is due partly to the multitudeof constituent galaxies and partly to large rotational velocities in twocounter-rotating gas disks -- a scenario predicted to lead to the most intensestarbursts, which will therefore come in pairs. the disks have m(dyn) ofseveral x 10^11 msun, and gas fractions of ~40%. velocity dispersions aremodest so the disks are unstable, potentially on scales commensurate with theirradii: these galaxies are undergoing extreme bursts of star formation, notconfined to their nuclei, at close to the eddington limit. their specificstar-formation rates place them ~&gt;5x above the main sequence, which supposedlycomprises large gas disks like these. their high star-formation efficienciesare difficult to reconcile with a simple volumetric star-formation law. n-bodyand dark matter simulations suggest this system is the progenitor of ab(inary)-type ~10^14.6-msun cluster.

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

1308.5681	h-atlas: estimating redshifts of herschel sources from sub-mm fluxes	upon its completion the herschel atlas (h-atlas) will be the largestsubmillimetre survey to date, detecting close to half-a-million sources. itwill only be possible to measure spectroscopic redshifts for a small fractionof these sources. however, if the rest-frame spectral energy distribution (sed)of a typical h-atlas source is known, this sed and the observed herschel fluxescan be used to estimate the redshifts of the h-atlas sources withoutspectroscopic redshifts. in this paper, we use a subset of 40 h-atlas sourceswith previously measured redshifts in the range 0.5&lt;z&lt;4.2 to derive a suitableaverage template for high redshift h-atlas sources. we find that a templatewith two dust components t_c = 23.9 k, t_h = 46.9 k and ratio of mass of colddust to mass of warm dust of 30.1) provides a good fit to the rest-frame fluxesof the sources in our calibration sample. we use a jackknife technique toestimate the accuracy of the redshifts estimated with this template, finding aroot mean square of delta z/(1+z) = 0.26. for sources for which there is priorinformation that they lie at z &gt; 1 we estimate that the rms of delta z/(1+z) =0.12. we have used this template to estimate the redshift distribution for thesources detected in the h-atlas equatorial fields, finding a bimodaldistribution with a mean redshift of 1.2, 1.9 and 2.5 for 250, 350 and 500 umselected sources respectively. \end{abstract}

1309.0836	gravitational lens models based on submillimeter array imaging of  herschel-selected strongly lensed sub-millimeter galaxies at z&gt;1.5	strong gravitational lenses are now being routinely discovered in wide-fieldsurveys at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. we present submillimeter array (sma)high-spatial resolution imaging and gemini-south and multiple mirror telescopeoptical spectroscopy of strong lens candidates discovered in the two widestextragalactic surveys conducted by the herschel space observatory: theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes). from a sample of 30 herschelsources with s_500&gt;100 mjy, 21 are strongly lensed (multiply imaged), 4 aremoderately lensed (singly imaged), and the remainder require additional data todetermine their lensing status. we apply a visibility-plane lens modelingtechnique to the sma data to recover information about the masses of the lensesas well as the intrinsic (i.e., unlensed) sizes (r_half) and far-infraredluminosities (l_fir) of the lensed submillimeter galaxies (smgs). the sample oflenses comprises primarily isolated massive galaxies, but includes some groupsand clusters as well. several of the lenses are located at z_lens&gt;0.7, aredshift regime that is inaccessible to lens searches based on sloan digitalsky survey spectroscopy. the lensed smgs are amplified by factors that aresignificantly below statistical model predictions given the 500um fluxdensities of our sample. we speculate that this may reflect a deficiency in ourunderstanding of the intrinsic sizes and luminosities of the brightest smgs.the lensed smgs span nearly one decade in l_fir (median l_fir=7.9x10^12 l_sun)and two decades in fir luminosity surface density (median sigma_fir=6.0x10^11l_sun kpc^-2). the strong lenses in this sample and others identified via(sub-)mm surveys will provide a wealth of information regarding theastrophysics of galaxy formation and evolution over a wide range in redshift.

1309.4102	isothermal dust models of herschel-atlas galaxies	we use galaxies from the herschel-atlas survey, and a suite of ancillarysimulations based on an isothermal dust model, to study our ability todetermine the effective dust temperature, luminosity and emissivity index of250um selected galaxies in the local universe (z &lt; 0.5). as well as simplefar-infrared sed fitting of individual galaxies based on chi^2 minimisation, weattempt to derive the best global isothermal properties of 13,826 galaxies withreliable optical counterparts and spectroscopic redshifts. using oursimulations, we highlight the fact that applying traditional sed fittingtechniques to noisy observational data in the herschel space observatory bandsintroduces artificial anti-correlation between derived values of dusttemperature and emissivity index. this is true even for galaxies with the mostrobust detections in our sample, making the results hard to interpret. we applya method to determine the best-fit global values of isothermal effectivetemperature and emissivity index for z &lt; 0.5 galaxies in h-atlas, deriving t =22.3 +/- 0.1k and beta = 1.98 +/- 0.02 (or t = 23.5 +/- 0.1k and beta = 1.82+/- 0.02 if we attempt to correct for bias by assuming that t and beta areindependent and normally distributed). we use our technique to test for anevolving emissivity index, finding only weak evidence. the median dustluminosity of our sample is log(ldust/lsolar) = 10.72 +/- 0.05 which (unlike t)shows little dependence on the choice of beta used in our analysis, includingwhether it is variable or fixed. we use a further suite of simulations toemphasise the importance of the h-atlas pacs data for deriving dusttemperatures at these redshifts, even though they are less sensitive than thespire data. the majority of galaxies detected by h-atlas are normalstar-forming galaxies, though a substantial minority (~31%) fall in theluminous infrared galaxy category.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1310.7583	hermes: candidate high-redshift galaxies discovered with herschel/spire	we present a method for selecting $z&gt;4$ dusty, star forming galaxies (dsfgs)using herschel/spire 250/350/500 $\mu m$ flux densities to search for redsources. we apply this method to 21 deg$^2$ of data from the hermes survey toproduce a catalog of 38 high-$z$ candidates. follow-up of the first 5 of thesesources confirms that this method is efficient at selecting high-$z$ dsfgs,with 4/5 at $z=4.3$ to $6.3$ (and the remaining source at $z=3.4$), and thatthey are some of the most luminous dusty sources known. comparison withprevious dsfg samples, mostly selected at longer wavelengths (e.g., 850 $\mum$) and in single-band surveys, shows that our method is much more efficient atselecting high-$z$ dsfgs, in the sense that a much larger fraction are at$z&gt;3$. correcting for the selection completeness and purity, we find that thenumber of bright ($s_{500\,\mu m} \ge 30$ mjy), red herschel sources is $3.3\pm 0.8$ deg$^{-2}$. this is much higher than the number predicted by currentmodels, suggesting that the dsfg population extends to higher redshifts thanpreviously believed. if the shape of the luminosity function for high-$z$ dsfgsis similar to that at $z\sim2$, rest-frame uv based studies may be missing asignificant component of the star formation density at $z=4$ to $6$, even aftercorrection for extinction.

1311.5898	herschel-atlas: deep hst/wfc3 imaging of strongly lensed submillimeter  galaxies	we report on deep near-infrared observations obtained with the wide fieldcamera 3 (wfc3) onboard the hubble space telescope (hst) of the first fiveconfirmed gravitational lensing events discovered by the herschel astrophysicalterahertz large area survey (h-atlas). we succeed in disentangling thebackground galaxy from the lens to gain separate photometry of the twocomponents. the hst data allow us to significantly improve on previousconstraints of the mass in stars of the lensed galaxy and to perform accuratelens modelling of these systems, as described in the accompanying paper by dyeet al. we fit the spectral energy distributions of the background sources fromnear-ir to millimetre wavelengths and use the magnification factors estimatedby dye et al. to derive the intrinsic properties of the lensed galaxies. wefind these galaxies to have star-formation rates of approximately 400 to 2000m_sol/yr, with approximately (6-25)x10^10 m_sol of their baryonic mass alreadyturned into stars. at these rates of star formation, all remaining moleculargas will be exhausted in less than 100 myr, reaching a final mass in stars of afew 10^11 m_sol. these galaxies are thus proto-ellipticals caught during theirmajor episode of star formation, and observed at the peak epoch z=1.5-3 of thecosmic star formation history of the universe.

1312.4963	constraining the lyman alpha escape fraction with far-infrared  observations of lyman alpha emitters	we study the far-infrared properties of 498 lyman alpha emitters (laes) atz=2.8, 3.1 and 4.5 in the extended chandra deep field-south, using 250, 350 and500 micron data from the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes)and 870 micron data from the laboca ecdfs submillimeter survey (less). none ofthe 126, 280 or 92 laes at z=2.8, 3.1 and 4.5, respectively, are individuallydetected in the far-infrared data. we use stacking to probe the averageemission to deeper flux limits, reaching $1\sigma$ depths of ~0.1 to 0.4 mjy.the laes are also undetected at $\ge3\sigma$ in the stacks, although a$2.5\sigma$ signal is observed at 870 micron for the z=2.8 sources. we considera wide range of far-infrared spectral energy distributions (seds), including am82 and an sd galaxy template, to determine upper limits on the far-infraredluminosities and far-infrared-derived star-formation rates of the laes. thesestar-formation rates are then combined with those inferred from the ly$\alpha$and uv emission to determine lower limits on the laes ly$\alpha$ escapefraction ($f_{\rm esc}($ly$\alpha$)). for the sd sed template, the inferredlaes $f_{\rm esc}($ly$\alpha$) are $\gtrsim30%$ ($1\sigma$) at z=2.8, 3.1 and4.5, which are all significantly higher than the global $f_{\rmesc}($ly$\alpha$) at these redshifts. thus, if the laes $f_{\rmesc}($ly$\alpha$) follows the global evolution then they have warmerfar-infrared seds than the sd galaxy template. the average and m82 seds producelower limits on the lae $f_{\rm esc}($ly$\alpha$) of ~10 to 20% ($1\sigma$),all of which are slightly higher than the global evolution of $f_{\rmesc}($ly$\alpha$) but consistent with it at the 2 to 3$\sigma$ level.

1403.2994	herschel-atlas: properties of dusty massive galaxies at low and high  redshifts	we present a comparison of the physical properties of a rest-frame $250\mu$mselected sample of massive, dusty galaxies from $0&lt;z&lt;5.3$. our sample comprises29 high-redshift submillimetre galaxies (smgs) from the literature, and 843dusty galaxies at $z&lt;0.5$ from the herschel-atlas, selected to have a similarstellar mass to the smgs. the $z&gt;1$ smgs have an average sfr of$390^{+80}_{-70}\,$m$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ which is 120 times that of thelow-redshift sample matched in stellar mass to the smgs (sfr$=3.3\pm{0.2}$m$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$). the smgs harbour a substantial mass of dust($1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\times{10}^9\,$m$_\odot$), compared to$(1.6\pm0.1)\times{10}^8\,$m$_\odot$ for low-redshift dusty galaxies. at lowredshifts the dust luminosity is dominated by the diffuse ism, whereas a largefraction of the dust luminosity in smgs originates from star-forming regions.at the same dust mass smgs are offset towards a higher sfr compared to thelow-redshift h-atlas galaxies. this is not only due to the higher gas fractionin smgs but also because they are undergoing a more efficient mode of starformation, which is consistent with their bursty star-formation histories. theoffset in sfr between smgs and low-redshift galaxies is similar to that foundin co studies, suggesting that dust mass is as good a tracer of molecular gasas co.

1404.5676	herschel-atlas: far-infrared properties of radio-loud and radio-quiet  quasars	we have constructed a sample of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars from thefaint im- ages radio sky at twenty-one centimetres (first) and the sloandigital sky survey data release 7 (sdss dr7), over the h-atlas phase 1 area(9h, 12h and 14.5h). using a stacking analysis we find a significantcorrelation between the far-infrared luminosity and 1.4-ghz luminosity forradio-loud quasars. partial correlation analysis confirms the intrinsiccorrelation after removing the redshift contribution while for radio-quietquasars no partial correlation is found. using a single-temperature grey-bodymodel we find a general trend of lower dust temperatures in the case ofradio-loud quasars comparing to radio-quiet quasars. also, radio-loud quasarsare found to have almost constant mean values of dust mass along redshift andoptical luminosity bins. in addition, we find that radio-loud quasars at loweroptical luminosities tend to have on average higher fir and 250-micronluminosity with respect to radio-quiet quasars with the same opticalluminosites. even if we use a two-temperature grey-body model to describe thefir data, the fir luminosity excess remains at lower optical luminosities.these results suggest that powerful radio jets are associated with starformation especially at lower accretion rates.

1407.4511	linking the x-ray and infrared properties of star-forming galaxies at  z&lt;1.5	we present the most complete study to date of the x-ray emission fromstar-formation in high redshift (median z=0.7; z&lt;1.5), ir-luminous(l_ir=10^10-10^13 l_sun) galaxies detected by herschel's pacs and spireinstruments. for our purpose we take advantage of the deepest x-ray data todate, the chandra deep fields (north and south). sources which host agn areremoved from our analysis by means of multiple agn indicators. we find an agnfraction of 18+/-2 per cent amongst our sample and note that agn entirelydominate at values of log[l_x/l_ir]&gt;-3 in both hard and soft x-ray bands. fromthe sources which are star-formation dominated, only a small fraction areindividually x-ray detected and for the bulk of the sample we calculate averagex-ray luminosities through stacking. we find an average soft x-ray to infraredratio of log[l_sx/l_ir]=-4.3 and an average hard x-ray to infrared ratio oflog[l_hx/l_ir]=-3.8. we report that the x-ray/ir correlation is approximatelylinear through the entire range of l_ir and z probed and, although broadlyconsistent with the local (z&lt;0.1) one, it does display some discrepancies. wesuggest that these discrepancies are unlikely to be physical, i.e. due to anintrinsic change in the x-ray properties of star-forming galaxies with cosmictime, as there is no significant evidence for evolution of the l_x/l_ir ratiowith redshift. instead they are possibly due to selection effects and remainingagn contamination. we also examine whether dust obscuration in the galaxy playsa role in attenuating x-rays from star-formation, by investigating changes inthe l_x/l_ir ratio as a function of the average dust temperature. we concludethat x-rays do not suffer any measurable attenuation in the host galaxy.

1409.8331	spectroscopy of superluminous supernova host galaxies. a preference of  hydrogen-poor events for extreme emission line galaxies	superluminous supernovae (slsne) are very bright explosions that were onlydiscovered recently and that show a preference for occurring in faint dwarfgalaxies. understanding why stellar evolution yields different types of stellarexplosions in these environments is fundamental in order to both uncover theelusive progenitors of slsne and to study star formation in dwarf galaxies. inthis paper, we present the first results of our project to study superluminoussupernova host galaxies, focusing on the sample for which we have obtainedspectroscopy. we show that slsne-i and slsne-r (hydrogen-poor) often (~50% inour sample) occur in a class of galaxies that is known as extreme emission linegalaxies (eelgs). the probability of this happening by chance is negligible andwe therefore conclude that the extreme environmental conditions and the slsnphenomenon are related. in contrast, slsne-ii (hydrogen-rich) occur in moremassive, more metal-rich galaxies with softer radiation fields. therefore, ifslsne-ii constitute a uniform class, their progenitor systems are likelydifferent from those of h-poor slsne. gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are, on average,not found in as extreme environments as h-poor slsne. we propose that h-poorslsne result from the very first stars exploding in a starburst, even earlierthan grbs. this might indicate a bottom-light initial mass function in thesesystems. slsne present a novel method of selecting candidate eelgs independentof their luminosity.

1410.7412	the far-infrared/radio correlation and radio spectral index of galaxies  in the sfr-m* plane up to z 2	[abridged] we study the evolution of the radio spectral index andfar-infrared/radio correlation (frc) across the star-formation rate-stellarmasse (i.e. sfr-m*) plane up to z 2. we start from a m*-selected sample ofgalaxies with reliable sfr and redshift estimates. we then grid the sfr-m*plane in several redshift ranges and measure the infrared luminosity, radioluminosity, radio spectral index, and ultimately the frc index (i.e. qfir) ofeach sfr-m*-z bin. the infrared luminosities of our sfr-m*-z bins are estimatedusing their stacked far-infrared flux densities inferred from observationsobtained with herschel. their radio luminosities and radio spectral indices(i.e. alpha, where snu nu^-alpha) are estimated using their stacked 1.4ghz and610mhz flux densities from the vla and gmrt, respectively. our far-infrared andradio observations include the most widely studied blank extragalactic fields-goods-n/s, ecdfs, and cosmos- covering a sky area of 2deg^2. using thismethodology, we constrain the radio spectral index and frc index ofstar-forming galaxies with m*&gt;10^10msun and 0&lt;z&lt;2.3. we find thatalpha^1.4ghz_610mhz does not evolve significantly with redshift or with thedistance of a galaxy with respect to the main sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane(i.e. delta_log(ssfr)_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). instead,star-forming galaxies have a radio spectral index consistent with a canonicalvalue of 0.8, which suggests that their radio spectra are dominated bynon-thermal optically thin synchrotron emission. we find that qfir displays amoderate but statistically significant redshift evolution asqfir(z)=(2.35+/-0.08)*(1+z)^(-0.12+/-0.04), consistent with some previousliterature. finally, we find no significant correlation between qfir anddelta_log(ssfr)_ms, though a weak positive trend, as observed in one of ourredshift bins, cannot be firmly ruled out using our dataset.

1503.01128	a multi-wavelength exploration of the [cii]/ir ratio in h-atlas/gama  galaxies out to z=0.2	we explore the behaviour of [cii]-157.74um forbidden fine-structure lineobserved in a sample of 28 galaxies selected from ~50deg^2 of the h-atlassurvey. the sample is restricted to galaxies with flux densities higher thans_160um&gt;150mjy and optical spectra from the gama survey at 0.02&lt;z&lt;0.2. far-irspectra centred on this redshifted line were taken with the pacs instrumenton-board the herschel space observatory. the galaxies span 10&lt;log(l_ir/lo)&lt;12(where l_ir=l_ir[8-1000um]) and 7.3&lt;log(l_[cii]/lo)&lt;9.3, covering a variety ofoptical galaxy morphologies. the sample exhibits the so-called [cii] deficit athigh ir luminosities, i.e. l_[cii]/l_ir (hereafter [cii]/ir) decreases at highl_ir. we find significant differences between those galaxies presenting[cii]/ir&gt;2.5x10^-3 with respect to those showing lower ratios. in particular,those with high ratios tend to have: (1) l_ir&lt;10^11lo; (2) cold dusttemperatures, t_d&lt;30k; (3) disk-like morphologies in r-band images; (4) a wisecolour 0.5&lt;s_12um/s_22um&lt;1.0; (5) low surface brightness sigma_ir~10^8-9 lokpc^-2, (6) and specific star-formation rates of ssfr~0.05-3 gyr^-1. we suggestthat the strength of the far-uv radiation fields (&lt;g_o&gt;) is main parameterresponsible for controlling the [cii]/ir ratio. it is possible that relativelyhigh &lt;g_o&gt; creates a positively charged dust grain distribution, impeding anefficient photo-electric extraction of electrons from these grains to thencollisionally excite carbon atoms. within the brighter ir population,11&lt;log(l_ir/lo)&lt;12, the low [cii]/ir ratio is unlikely to be modified by [cii]self absorption or controlled by the presence of a moderately luminous agn(identified via the bpt diagram).

1507.07044	hermes: disentangling active galactic nuclei and star formation in the  radio source population	we separate the extragalactic radio source population above ~50 ujy intoactive galactic nuclei (agn) and star-forming sources. the primary method ofour approach is to fit the infrared spectral energy distributions (seds),constructed using spitzer/irac and mips and herschel/spire photometry, of 380radio sources in the extended chandra deep field-south. from the fitted seds,we determine the relative agn and star-forming contributions to their infraredemission. with the inclusion of other agn diagnostics such as x-ray luminosity,spitzer/irac colours, radio spectral index and the ratio of star-forming totalinfrared flux to k-corrected 1.4 ghz flux density, qir, we determine whetherthe radio emission in these sources is powered by star formation or by an agn.the majority of these radio sources (60 per cent) show the signature of an agnat some wavelength. of the sources with agn signatures, 58 per cent are hybridsystems for which the radio emission is being powered by star formation. thisimplies that radio sources which have likely been selected on their starformation have a high agn fraction. below a 1.4 ghz flux density of 1 mjy,along with finding a strong contribution to the source counts from purestar-forming sources, we find that hybrid sources constitute 20-65 per cent ofthe sources. this result suggests that hybrid sources have a significantcontribution, along with sources that do not host a detectable agn, to theobserved flattening of the source counts at ~1mjy for the extragalactic radiosource population.

1511.06167	the hermes sub-millimetre local and low-redshift luminosity functions	we used wide area surveys over 39 deg$^2$ by the hermes collaboration,performed with the herschel observatory spire multi-wavelength camera, toestimate the low-redshift, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.5$, monochromatic luminosity functions(lfs) of galaxies at 250, 350 and 500$\,\mu$m. spire flux densities were alsocombined with spitzer photometry and multi-wavelength archival data to performa complete sed fitting analysis of spire detected sources to calculate precisek-corrections, as well as the bolometric infrared (8-1000$\,\mu$m) luminosityfunctions and their low-$z$ evolution from a combination of statisticalestimators. integration of the latter prompted us to also compute the localluminosity density (lld) and the comoving star formation rate density (sfrd)for our sources, and to compare them with theoretical predictions of galaxyformation models. the luminosity functions show significant and rapidluminosity evolution already at low redshifts, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.2$, with l$_{ir}^*\propto (1+z)^{6.0\pm0.4}$ and $\phi_{ir}^* \propto (1+z)^{-2.1\pm0.4}$,l$_{250}^* \propto (1+z)^{5.3\pm0.2}$ and $\phi_{250}^* \propto(1+z)^{-0.6\pm0.4}$ estimated using the ir bolometric and the 250$\,\mu$m lfsrespectively. converting our ir ld estimate into an sfrd assuming a standardsalpeter imf and including the unobscured contribution based on the uvdust-uncorrected emission from local galaxies, we estimate a sfrd scaling ofsfrd$_0+0.08 z$, where sfrd$_0\simeq (1.9\pm 0.03)\times 10^{-2}[\mathrm{m}_\odot\,\mathrm{mpc}^{-3}]$ is our total sfrd estimate at$z\sim0.02$.

1512.04120	dust properties of lyman break galaxies at $z\sim3$	we explore from a statistical point of view the far-infrared (far-ir) andsub-millimeter (sub-mm) properties of a large sample of lbgs (22,000) at z~3 inthe cosmos field. the large number of galaxies allows us to split it in severalbins as a function of uv luminosity, uv slope, and stellar mass to bettersample their variety. we perform stacking analysis in pacs (100 and 160 um),spire (250, 350 and 500 um) and aztec (1.1 mm) images. our stacking procedurecorrects the biases induced by galaxy clustering and incompleteness of ourinput catalogue in dense regions. we obtain the full ir spectral energydistributions (sed) of subsamples of lbgs and derive the mean ir luminosity asa function of uv luminosity, uv slope, and stellar mass. the average irx isroughly constant over the uv luminosity range, with a mean of 7.9 (1.8 mag).however, it is correlated with uv slope, and stellar mass. we investigate usinga statistically-controlled stacking analysis as a function of (stellar mass, uvslope) the dispersion of the irx-uvslope and irx-m* plane. our results enableus to study the average relation between star-formation rate (sfr) and stellarmass, and we show that our lbg sample lies on the main sequence of starformation at z~3.

0808.3139	the star-formation history of k-selected galaxies	we have studied the ujy radio properties of k-selected galaxies detected inthe ultra-deep survey portion of ukidss using 610- and 1,400-mhz images fromthe vla and gmrt. these deep radio mosaics, combined with the largest anddeepest k image currently available, allow high-s/n detections of manyk-selected sub-populations, including sbzk and pbzk star-forming and passivegalaxies. we find a strong correlation between the radio and k fluxes and alinear relationship between sfr and k luminosity. we find no evidence, fromeither radio spectral indices or a comparison with submm-derived sfrs, that thefull sample is strongly contaminated by agn. the sbzk and pbzk galaxies havesimilar levels of radio flux, sfr and specific sfr (ssfr) at z &lt; 1.4,suggesting there is strong contamination of the pbzk sample by star-forminggalaxies. at z &gt; 1.4, pbzk galaxies become difficult to detect in the radiostack, though the implied sfrs are still much higher than expected forpassively evolving galaxies. their radio emission may come from low-luminosityagn. eros straddle the passive and star-forming regions of the bzk diagram andalso straddle the two groups in terms of their radio properties. k-bright erosamples are dominated by passive galaxies and faint ero samples contain morestar-forming galaxies. the star-formation history (sfh) from stacking all ksources in the uds agrees well with that derived for other wavebands and otherradio surveys, at least out to z ~ 2. the radio-derived sfh then appears tofall more steeply than that measured at other wavelengths. the ssfr fork-selected sources rises strongly with redshift at all stellar masses, andshows a weak dependence on stellar mass. high- and low-mass galaxies show asimilar decline in ssfr since z ~ 2 (abridged).

astro-ph;0702544	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) - iii.  identification of radio and mid-infrared counterparts to submillimetre  galaxies	determining an accurate position for a submm galaxy (smg) is the crucial stepthat enables us to move from the basic properties of an smg sample - sourcecounts and 2-d clustering - to an assessment of their detailed,multi-wavelength properties, their contribution to the history of cosmic starformation and their links with present-day galaxy populations. in this paper,we identify robust radio and/or ir counterparts, and hence accurate positions,for over two thirds of the scuba half-degree extragalactic survey (shades)source catalogue, presenting optical, 24-um and radio images of each smg.observed trends in identification rate have given no strong rationale forpruning the sample. uncertainties in submm position are found to be consistentwith theoretical expectations, with no evidence for significant additionalsources of error. employing the submm/radio redshift indicator, via aparameterisation appropriate for radio-identified smgs with spectroscopicredshifts, yields a median redshift of 2.8 for the radio-identified subset ofshades, somewhat higher than the median spectroscopic redshift. we present adiagnostic colour-colour plot, exploiting spitzer photometry, in which weidentify regions commensurate with smgs at very high redshift. finally, we findthat significantly more smgs have multiple robust counterparts than would beexpected by chance, indicative of physical associations. these multiple systemsare most common amongst the brightest smgs and are typically separated by 2-6",or 15-50/(sin i) kpc at z ~ 2, consistent with early bursts seen in mergersimulations.
