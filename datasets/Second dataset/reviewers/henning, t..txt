0903.1369	atlasgal - the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy at 870  microns	(abridged) studying continuum emission from interstellar dust is essential tolocating and characterizing the highest density regions in the interstellarmedium. in particular, the early stages of massive star formation remain poorlyunderstood. our goal is to produce a large-scale, systematic database ofmassive pre- and proto-stellar clumps in the galaxy, to understand how andunder what conditions star formation takes place. a well characterized sampleof star-forming sites will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass functionof high-mass, star-forming clumps. this systematic survey at submm wavelengthsalso represents a preparatory work for herschel and alma. the apex telescope isideally located to observe the inner milky way. the large apex bolometer camera(laboca) is a 295-element bolometer array observing at 870 microns, with a beamsize of 19". taking advantage of its large field of view (11.4') and excellentsensitivity, we started an unbiased survey of the galactic plane, with a noiselevel of 50-70 mjy/beam: the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy(atlasgal). as a first step, we covered 95 sq. deg. these data reveal 6000compact sources brighter than 0.25 jy, as well as extended structures, many ofthem filamentary. about two thirds of the compact sources have no brightinfrared counterpart, and some of them are likely to correspond to theprecursors of (high-mass) proto-stars or proto-clusters. other compact sourcesharbor hot cores, compact hii regions or young embedded clusters. assuming atypical distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller than 1 pc withmasses from a few 10 to a few 100 m_sun. in this introductory paper, we showpreliminary results from these ongoing observations, and discuss theperspectives of the survey.

0909.0802	candidate free-floating super-jupiters in the young sigma orionis open  cluster	free-floating substellar candidates with estimated theoretical masses of aslow as ~5 jupiter masses have been found in the ~3 myr old sigma orionis opencluster. as the overlap with the planetary mass domain increases, the questionof how these objects form becomes important. the determination of their numberdensity and whether a mass cut-off limit exists is crucial to understandingtheir formation. we propose to search for objects of yet lower masses in thecluster and determine the shape of the mass function at low mass. using new-and (re-analysed) published izjhks[3.6]-[8.0]-band data of an area of 840arcmin2, we performed a search for lt-type cluster member candidates in themagnitude range j=19.5-21.5 mag, based on their expected magnitudes andcolours. besides recovering the t type object s ori 70 and two other knownobjects, we find three new cluster member candidates, s ori 72-74, with j=21mag and within 12 arcmin of the cluster centre. they have theoretical masses of4 (-2,+3) m_jup and are among the least massive free-floating objects detectedby direct imaging outside the solar system. the photometry in archival spitzer[3.6]-[5.8]-band images infers that s ori 72 is an l/t transition candidate ands ori 73 a t-type candidate, following the expected cluster sequence in themid-infrared. finally, the l-type candidate s ori 74 with lower qualityphotometry is located at 11.8 arcsec (~4250 au) of a stellar member of sigmaorionis and could be a companion. after contaminant correction in the areacomplete to j=21.1 mag, we estimate that there remain between zero and twocluster members in the mass interval 6-4 m_jup. our result suggests a possibleturnover in the substellar mass spectrum below ~6 jupiter masses, which couldbe investigated further by wider and deeper photometric surveys.

0910.4529	brown dwarfs and very low mass stars in the praesepe open cluster: a  dynamically unevolved mass function?	[abridged] in this paper, we present the results of a photometric survey toidentify low mass and brown dwarf members of the old open cluster praesepe (ageof 590[+150][-120]myr and distance of 190[+6.0][-5.8]pc) and use this to inferits mass function which we compare with that of other clusters. we haveperformed an optical (ic-band) and near-infrared (j and ks-band) photometricsurvey of praesepe with a spatial coverage of 3.1deg^2. with 5sigma detectionlimits of ic=23.4 and j=20.0, our survey is sensitive to objects with massesfrom about 0.6 to 0.05msol. the mass function of praesepe rises from 0.6msoldown to 0.1msol and then turns-over at ~0.1msol. the rise observed is inagreement with the mass function derived by previous studies, including asurvey based on proper motion and photometry. comparing our mass function withthat for another open cluster with a similar age, the hyades (age ~ 600myr), wesee a significant difference. possible reasons are that dynamical evaporationhas not influenced the hyades and praesepe in the same way, or that theclusters did not have the same initial mass function, or that dynamicalinteractions have modified the evolution of one or both clusters. although adifference in the binary fractions of the clusters could cause the observed(i.e. system) mass functions to differ, measurements in the literature give noevidence for a significant difference in the binary fractions of the twoclusters. of our cluster candidates, six have masses predicted to be equal toor below the stellar/substellar boundary at 0.072msol.

1102.0503	a planetary companion around a metal-poor star with extragalactic origin	we report the detection of a planetary companion around hip 13044, ametal-poor star on the red horizontal branch. the detection is based on radialvelocity observations with feros, a high-resolution spectrograph at the 2.2-mmpg/eso telescope, located at eso la silla observatory in chile. the periodicradial velocity variation of p = 16.2 days can be distinguished from theperiods of the stellar activity indicators. we computed a minimum planetarymass of 1.25 mjup and an orbital semi-major axis of 0.116 au for the planet.this discovery is unique in three aspects: first, it is the first planetdetection around a star with a metallicity much lower than few percent of thesolar value; second, the planet host star resides in a stellar evolutionarystage that is still unexplored in the exoplanet surveys; third, the star hip13044 belongs to one of the most significant stellar halo streams in the solarneighborhood, implying an extragalactic origin of the planetary system hip13044 in a disrupted former satellite of the milky way.

1104.0678	probing the evolution of molecular cloud structure ii: from chaos to  confinement	we present an analysis of the large-scale molecular cloud structure and ofthe stability of clumpy structures in nearby molecular clouds. in our recentwork, we identified a structural transition in molecular clouds by studying theprobability distributions of gas column densities in them. in this paper, wefurther examine the nature of this transition. the transition takes place atthe visual extinction of a_v^tail = 2-4 mag, or equivalently, at \sigma^tail =40-80 ms pc^{-2}. the clumps identified above this limit have wide ranges ofmasses and sizes, but a remarkably constant mean volume density of n = 10^3cm^{-3}. this is 5-10 times larger than the density of the medium surroundingthe clumps. by examining the stability of the clumps, we show that they aregravitationally unbound entities, and that the external pressure from theparental molecular cloud is a significant source of confining pressure forthem. then, the structural transition at a_v^tail may be linked to a transitionbetween this population and the surrounding medium. the star formation rates inthe clouds correlate strongly with the total mass in the clumps, i.e, with themass above a_v^tail, dropping abruptly below that threshold. these resultsimply that the formation of pressure confined clumps introduces a prerequisitefor star formation. furthermore, they give a physically motivated explanationfor the recently reported relation between the star formation rates and theamount of dense material in molecular clouds. likewise, they give rise to anatural threshold for star formation at a_v^tail.

1201.1036	extrasolar planet population synthesis iv. correlations with disk  metallicity, mass and lifetime	context. this is the fourth paper in a series showing the results of planetpopulation synthesis calculations.  aims. our goal in this paper is to systematically study the effects ofimportant disk properties, namely disk metallicity, mass and lifetime onfundamental planetary properties.  methods. for a large number of protoplanetary disks we calculate a populationof planets with our core accretion formation model including planet migrationand disk evolution.  results. we find a large number of correlations: regarding the planetaryinitial mass function, metallicity, disk mass and disk lifetime have differentroles: for high [fe/h], giant planets are more frequent. for high disk masses,giant planets are more massive. for long disk lifetimes, giant planets are bothmore frequent and massive. at low metallicities, very massive giant planetscannot form, but otherwise giant planet mass and metallicity are uncorrelated.in contrast, planet masses and disk gas masses are correlated. the sweet spotfor giant planet formation is at 5 au. in- and outside this distance, higherplanetesimals surface densities are necessary. low metallicities can becompensated by high disk masses, and vice versa, but not ad infinitum. at lowmetallicities, giant planets only form outside the ice line, while at highmetallicities, giant planet formation occurs throughout the disk. the extent ofmigration increases with disk mass and lifetime and usually decreases withmetallicity. no clear correlation of metallicity and the semimajor axis ofgiant planets exists because in low [fe/h] disks, planets start further out,but migrate more, whereas for high [fe/h] they start further in, but migrateless. close-in low mass planets have a lower mean metallicity than hotjupiters.  conclusions. the properties of protoplanetary disks are decisive for theproperties of planets, and leave many imprints.

1205.3159	high-contrast nir polarization imaging of mwc480	one of the key predictions of modeling from the ir excess of herbig ae starsis that for protoplanetary disks, where significant grain growth and settlinghas occurred, the dust disk has flattened to the point that it can be partiallyor largely shadowed by the innermost material at or near the dust sublimationradius. when the self-shadowing has already started, the outer disk is expectedto be detected in scattered light only in the exceptional cases that the scaleheight of the dust disk at the sublimation radius is smaller than usual.high-contrast imaging combined with the ir spectral energy distribution allowus to measure the degree of flattening of the disk, as well as to determine theproperties of the outer disk. we present polarimetric differential imaging in$h$ band obtained with subaru/hiciao of one such system, mwc 480. the hiciaodata were obtained at a historic minimum of the nir excess. the disk isdetected in scattered light from 0\farcs2-1\farcs0 (27.4-137au). together withthe marginal detection of the disk from 1998 february 24 by hst/nicmos, ourdata constrain the opening half angle for the disk to lie between1.3$\leq\theta\leq 2.2^\circ$. when compared with similar measures in co forthe gas disk from the literature, the dust disk subtends only $\sim$30% of thegas disk scale height (h/r$\sim$0.03). such a dust disk is a factor of 5-7flatter than transitional disks, which have structural signatures that giantplanets have formed.

1206.3303	characterization of exoplanets from their formation ii: the planetary  mass-radius relationship	the research of exoplanets has entered an era in which we characterizeextrasolar planets. this has become possible with measurements of radii andluminosities. meanwhile, radial velocity surveys discover also very low-massplanets. uniting all this observational data into one coherent picture tobetter understand planet formation is an important, but difficult undertaking.our approach is to develop a model which can make testable predictions for allthese observational methods. we continue to describe how we have extended ourformation model into a self-consistently coupled formation and evolution model.we show how we calculate the internal structure of the solid core andradiogenic heating. we also improve the protoplanetary disk model. finally, weconduct population synthesis calculations. we present how the planetarymass-radius relationship of planets with primordial h/he envelopes forms andevolves in time. the basic shape of the m-r relation can be understood from thecore accretion model. low-mass planets cannot bind massive envelopes, whilesuper-critical cores necessarily trigger runway gas accretion, leading to"forbidden" zones in the m-r plane. for a given mass, there is a considerablediversity of radii. we compare the synthetic m-r relation with the observedone, finding good agreement for a&gt;0.1 au. the synthetic radius distribution ischaracterized by a strong increase towards small r, and a second, lower localmaximum at ~1 jovian radius. the increase towards small radii reflects theincrease of the mass function towards low m. the second local maximum is due tothe fact that radii are nearly independent of mass for giant planets. acomparison of the synthetic radius distribution with kepler data showsagreement for r&gt;2 earth radii, but divergence for smaller radii. we predictthat in the next few years, kepler should find the second, local maximum at ~1jovian radius.

1206.6103	characterization of exoplanets from their formation i: models of  combined planet formation and evolution	a first characterization of many exoplanets has recently been achieved by theobservational determination of their radius. for some planets, a measurement ofthe luminosity has also been possible, with many more directly imaged planetsexpected in the future. the statistical characterization of exoplanets throughtheir mass-radius and mass-luminosity diagram is thus becoming possible. thisis for planet formation and evolution theory of similar importance as themass-distance diagram. our aim in this and a companion paper is to extend ourformation model into a coupled formation and evolution model. we want tocalculate in a self-consistent way all basic characteristics (m,a,r,l) of aplanet and use the model for population synthesis calculations. here we showhow we solve the structure equations describing the gaseous envelope not onlyduring the early formation phase, but also during gas runaway accretion, andduring the evolutionary phase at constant mass on gyr timescales. we then studythe in situ formation and evolution of jupiter, the mass-radius relationship ofgiants, the influence of the core mass on the radius and the luminosity both inthe "hot start" and the "cold start" scenario. we put special emphasis on thecomparison with other models. we find that our results agree very well withthose of more complex models, despite a number of simplifications. the upgradedmodel yields the most important characteristics of a planet from its beginningas a seed embryo to a gyr old planet. this is the case for all planets in asynthetic planetary population. therefore, we can now use self-consistently thestatistical constraints coming from all major observational techniques. this isimportant in a time where different techniques yield constraints on verydiverse sub-populations of planets, and where its is challenging to put allthese constraints together in one coherent picture.

1211.0741	atlasgal - compact source catalogue: 330 &lt; l &lt; 21 degrees	context. the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy (atlasgal) is thefirst systematic survey of the inner galactic plane in the sub-millimetre. theobservations were carried out with the large apex bolometer camera (laboca), anarray of 295 bolometers observing at 870 microns (345 ghz). aims. here wepresent a first version of the compact source catalogue extracted from thissurvey. this catalogue provides an unbiased database of dusty clumps in theinner galaxy. methods. the construction of this catalogue was made using thesource extraction routine sextractor. we have cross-associated the obtainedsources with the iras and msx catalogues, in order to constrain their nature.results. we have detected 6639 compact sources in the range from 330 &lt; l &lt; 21degrees and |b| &lt; 1.5 degrees. the catalogue has a 99% completeness for sourceswith a peak flux above 6 sigma, which corresponds to a flux density of ~0.4jy/beam. the parameters extracted for sources with peak fluxes below the 6sigma completeness threshold should be used with caution. tests on simulateddata find the uncertainty in the flux measurement to be ~12%, however, in morecomplex regions the flux values can be overestimated by a factor of 2 due tothe additional background emission. using a search radius of 30" we found that40% of atlasgal compact sources are associated with an iras or msx pointsource, but, ~50% are found to be associated with msx 21 microns fluxes abovethe local background level, which is probably a lower limit to the actualnumber of sources associated with star formation. conclusions. althoughinfrared emission is found towards the majority of the clumps detected, thiscatalogue is still likely to include a significant number of clumps that aredevoid of star formation activity and therefore excellent candidates forobjects in the coldest, earliest stages of (high-mass) star formation.

1211.4969	chemistry in disks viii: the cs molecule as an analytic tracer of  turbulence in disks	turbulence is thought to be a key driver of the evolution of protoplanetarydisks, regulating the mass accretion process, the transport of angularmomentum, and the growth of dust particles.  we intend to determine the magnitude of the turbulent motions in the outerparts (&gt; 100 au) of the disk surrounding dm tau. turbulent motions can beconstrained by measuring the nonthermal broadening of line emission from heavymolecules. we used the iram plateau de bure interferometer to study emissionfrom the cs molecule in the disk of dm tau. high spatial (1.4 x 1 ") andspectral resolution (0.126 km/s) cs j=3-2 images provide constraints on themolecule distribution and velocity structure of the disk. a low sensitivity csj=5-4 image was used in conjunction to evaluate the excitation conditions. weanalyzed the data in terms of two parametric disk models, and compared theresults with detailed time-dependent chemical simulations.  the cs data confirm the relatively low temperature suggested by observationsof other simple molecules. the intrinsic linewidth derived from the cs j=3-2data is much larger than expected from pure thermal broadening. the magnitudeof the derived nonthermal component depends only weakly on assumptions aboutthe location of the cs molecules with respect to the disk plane. our resultsindicate turbulence with a mach number around 0.4 - 0.5 in the molecular layer.geometrical constraints suggest that this layer is located near one scaleheight, in reasonable agreement with chemical model predictions.

1305.6383	high-fidelity view of the structure and fragmentation of the high-mass,  filamentary irdc g11.11-0.12	star formation in molecular clouds is intimately linked to their internalmass distribution. we present an unprecedentedly detailed analysis of thecolumn density structure of a high-mass, filamentary molecular cloud, namelyirdc g11.11-0.12 (g11). we use two novel column density mapping techniques:high-resolution (fwhm=2", or ~0.035 pc) dust extinction mapping in near- andmid-infrared, and dust emission mapping with the herschel satellite. these twocompletely independent techniques yield a strikingly good agreement,highlighting their complementarity and robustness. we first analyze the densegas mass fraction and linear mass density of g11. we show that g11 has a topheavy mass distribution and has a linear mass density (m_l ~ 600 msun pc^{-1})that greatly exceeds the critical value of a self-gravitating, non-turbulentcylinder. these properties make g11 analogous to the orion a cloud, despite itslow star-forming activity. this suggests that the amount of dense gas inmolecular clouds is more closely connected to environmental parameters orglobal processes than to the star-forming efficiency of the cloud. we thenexamine hierarchical fragmentation in g11 over a wide range of size-scales anddensities. we show that at scales 0.5 pc &gt; l &gt; 8 pc, the fragmentation of g11is in agreement with that of a self-gravitating cylinder. at scales smallerthan l &lt; 0.5 pc, the results agree better with spherical jeans' fragmentation.one possible explanation for the change in fragmentation characteristics is thesize-scale-dependent collapse time-scale that results from the finite size ofreal molecular clouds: at scales l &lt; 0.5 pc, fragmentation becomes sufficientlyrapid to be unaffected by global instabilities.

1306.0547	low-velocity shocks traced by extended sio emission along the w43  ridges: witnessing the formation of young massive clusters	the formation of high-mass stars is tightly linked to that of their parentalclouds. we here focus on the high-density parts of w43, a molecular cloudundergoing an efficient event of formation. the cloud structure is studied witha column density image derived from herschel continuum maps obtained at 70,160, 250, 350, and 500 micron. we identify two high-column density filamentaryclouds, quoted as the w43-mm1 and w43-mm2 ridges, which both account for1.5x10^4 msun gas mass above 10^23 cm-2 and within areas of 5 and 14pc^2,respectively. we used the n_2h^+ 1--0 line to confirm that the w43-mm1 andw43-mm2 ridges are structures coherent in velocity and gravitationally bound,despite their large velocity dispersion and ~5 kms line widths. the mostintriguing result of the w43 large program is the bright wide-spread sio 2--1emission: 1--11 k kms$ stretching an area of ~28 pc^2. concentrated toward thew43-mm1 and w43-mm2 ridges and their immediate surroundings, it leads to atotal luminosity of l_sio 2-1 ~4 10^4 k kms kpc^2pc^2. we measured a steeprelation between the luminosity and velocity extent of the sio~2--1 lines andpropose to use it to distinguish the low-velocity shocks observed here from themore classical high-velocity ones associated with outflows of high-mass youngstellar objects. we used state-of-the-art shock models to demonstrate thatlow-velocity (&lt;10 kms^-1) shocks with a small amount (10%) of si atomsinitially in gas phase or in grain mantles can explain the observed sio columndensity in w43. the spatial and velocity overlaps between the ridgeshigh-density gas (n_h2&gt;10^4-10^5 cm^-3) and the shocked sio gas suggests thatridges could be forming via colliding flows driven by gravity and accompaniedby low-velocity shocks. this mechanism may be the initial conditions for theformation of young massive clusters in these ridges.

1402.5778	millimetre spectral indices of transition disks and their relation to  the cavity radius	transition disks are protoplanetary disks with inner depleted dust cavitiesand excellent candidates to investigate the dust evolution under the existenceof a pressure bump. a pressure bump at the outer edge of the cavity allows dustgrains from the outer regions to stop their rapid inward migration towards thestar and efficiently grow to millimetre sizes. dynamical interactions withplanet(s) have been one of the most exciting theories to explain the clearingof the inner disk. we look for evidence of the presence of millimetre dustparticles in transition disks by measuring their spectral index with new andavailable photometric data. we investigate the influence of the size of thedust depleted cavity on the disk integrated millimetre spectral index. wepresent the 3mm photometric observations carried out with pdbi of fourtransition disks: lkha330, uxtaua, lrll31, and lrll67. we use available valuesof their fluxes at 345ghz to calculate their spectral index, as well as thespectral index for a sample of twenty transition disks. we compare theobservations with two kind of models. in the first set of models, we considercoagulation and fragmentation of dust in a disk in which a cavity is formed bya massive planet located at different positions. the second set of modelsassumes disks with truncated inner parts at different radius and with power-lawdust size distributions, where the maximum size of grains is calculatedconsidering turbulence as the source of destructive collisions. we show thatthe integrated spectral index is higher for transition disks than for regularprotoplanetary disks. for transition disks, the probability that the measuredspectral index is positively correlated with the cavity radius is 95%. highangular resolution imaging of transition disks is needed to distinguish betweenthe dust trapping scenario and the truncated disk case.

1402.5969	impacts of planet migration models on planetary populations. effects of  saturation, cooling and stellar irradiation	context: several recent studies have found that planet migration in adiabaticdiscs differs significantly from migration in isothermal discs. depending onthe thermodynamic conditions, i.e., the effectiveness of radiative cooling, andthe radial surface density profile, planets migrate inward or outward. clearly,this will influence the semimajor axis - mass distribution of planets aspredicted by population synthesis simulations. aims: our goal is to study theglobal effects of radiative cooling, viscous torque desaturation and gapopening as well as stellar irradiation on the tidal migration of a syntheticplanet population. methods: we combine results from several analytical studiesand 3d hydrodynamic simulations in a new semi-analytical migration model forthe application in our planet population synthesis calculations. results: wefind a good agreement of our model with torques obtained in a 3d radiativehydrodynamic simulations. we find three convergence zones in a typical disc,towards which planets migrate from the in- and outside, affecting strongly themigration behavior of low-mass planets. interestingly, this leads to slow typeii like migration behavior for low-mass planets captured in those zones evenwithout an ad hoc migration rate reduction factor or a yet to be definedhalting mechanism. this means that the new prescription of migration includingnon-isothermal effects makes the preciously widely used artificial migrationrate reduction factor obsolete. conclusions: outward migration in parts of adisc makes some planets survive long enough to become massive. the convergencezones lead to a potentially observable accumulations of low-mass planets atcertain semimajor axes. our results indicate that further studies of the masswhere the corotation torque saturates will be needed since its value has amajor impact on the properties of planet populations.

1402.6597	on the structure of the transition disk around tw hya	for over a decade, the structure of the inner cavity in the transition diskof tw hydrae has been a subject of debate. modeling the disk with data obtainedat different wavelengths has led to a variety of proposed disk structures.rather than being inconsistent, the individual models might point to thedifferent faces of physical processes going on in disks, such as dust growthand planet formation. our aim is to investigate the structure of the transitiondisk again and to find to what extent we can reconcile apparent modeldifferences. a large set of high-angular-resolution data was collected fromnear-infrared to centimeter wavelengths. we investigated the existing diskmodels and established a new self-consistent radiative-transfer model. agenetic fitting algorithm was used to automatize the parameter fitting. simpledisk models with a vertical inner rim and a radially homogeneous dustcomposition from small to large grains cannot reproduce the combined data set.two modifications are applied to this simple disk model: (1) the inner rim issmoothed by exponentially decreasing the surface density in the inner ~3 au,and (2) the largest grains (&gt;100 um) are concentrated towards the inner diskregion. both properties can be linked to fundamental processes that determinethe evolution of protoplanetary disks: the shaping by a possible companion andthe different regimes of dust-grain growth, respectively. the fullinterferometric data set from near-infrared to centimeter wavelengths requiresa revision of existing models for the tw hya disk. we present a new model thatincorporates the characteristic structures of previous models but deviates intwo key aspects: it does not have a sharp edge at 4 au, and the surface densityof large grains differs from that of smaller grains. this is the firstsuccessful radiative-transfer-based model for a full set of interferometricdata.

1403.5272	grain opacity and the bulk composition of extrasolar planets. i. results  from scaling the ism opacity	the opacity due to grains in the envelope of a protoplanet regulates theaccretion rate of gas during formation, thus the final bulk composition ofplanets with primordial h/he is a function of it. observationally, forexoplanets with known mass and radius it is possible to estimate the bulkcomposition via internal structure models. we first determine the reductionfactor of the ism grain opacity f_opa that leads to gas accretion ratesconsistent with grain evolution models. we then compare the bulk composition ofsynthetic low-mass and giant planets at different f_opa with observations. forf_opa=1 (full ism opacity) the synthetic low-mass planets have too small radii,i.e., too low envelope masses compared to observations. at f_opa=0.003, thevalue calibrated with the grain evolution models, synthetic and actual planetsoccupy similar mass-radius loci. the mean enrichment of giant planets relativeto the host star as a function of planet mass m can be approximated asz_p/z_star = beta*(m/m_jup)^alpha. we find alpha=-0.7 independent of f_opa insynthetic populations in agreement with the observational result (-0.71+-0.10).the absolute enrichment level decreases from beta=8.5 at f_opa=1 to 3.5 atf_opa=0. at f_opa=0.003 one finds beta=7.2 which is similar to theobservational result (6.3+-1.0). we thus find observational hints that theopacity in protoplanetary atmospheres is much smaller than in the ism even ifthe specific value of the grain opacity cannot be constrained here. the resultfor the enrichment of giant planets helps to distinguish core accretion andgravitational instability. in the simplest picture of core accretion wherefirst a critical core forms and afterwards only gas is added, alpha=-1. if acore accretes all planetesimals inside the feeding zone, alpha=-2/3. theobservational result lies between these values, pointing to core accretion asthe formation mechanism.

1407.0470	improving the astrometric performance of vlti-prima	in the summer of 2011, the first on-sky astrometric commissioning ofprima-astrometry delivered a performance of 3 m'' for a 10 '' separation onbright objects, orders of magnitude away from its exoplanet requirement of 50{\mu}'' ~ 20 {\mu}'' on objects as faint as 11 mag ~ 13 mag in k band. thiscontribution focuses on upgrades and characterizations carried out since then.  the astrometric metrology was extended from the coud\'e focus of theauxillary telescopes to their secondary mirror, in order to reduce the baselineinstabilities and improve the astrometric performance. while carrying out thisextension, it was realized that the polarization retardance of the starseparator derotator had a major impact on both the astrometric metrology andthe fringe sensors. a local compensation of this retardance and the operationon a symmetric baseline allowed a new astrometric commissioning. in october2013, an improved astrometric performance of 160 {\mu}'' was demonstrated,still short of the requirements. instabilities in the astrometric baselinestill appear to be the dominating factor.  in preparation to a review held in january 2014, a plan was developed tofurther improve the astrometric and faint target performance of primaastrometry. on the astrometric aspect, it involved the extension of theinternal longitudinal metrology to primary space, the design and implementationof an external baseline metrology, and the development of an astrometricinternal fringes mode. on the faint target aspect, investigations of theperformance of the fringe sensor units and the development of an ao system(naomi) were in the plan. following this review, eso decided to take a proposalto the april 2014 stc that prima be cancelled, and that eso resources beconcentrated on ensuring that gravity and matisse are a success. this proposalwas recommended by the stc in may 2014, and endorsed by eso.

0805.1873	darwin - a mission to detect, and search for life on, extrasolar planets	the discovery of extra-solar planets is one of the greatest achievements ofmodern astronomy. the detection of planets with a wide range of massesdemonstrates that extra-solar planets of low mass exist. in this paper wedescribe a mission, called darwin, whose primary goal is the search for, andcharacterization of, terrestrial extrasolar planets and the search for life.accomplishing the mission objectives will require collaborative science acrossdisciplines including astrophysics, planetary sciences, chemistry andmicrobiology. darwin is designed to detect and perform spectroscopic analysisof rocky planets similar to the earth at mid-infrared wavelengths (6 - 20micron), where an advantageous contrast ratio between star and planet occurs.the baseline mission lasts 5 years and consists of approximately 200 individualtarget stars. among these, 25 to 50 planetary systems can be studiedspectroscopically, searching for gases such as co2, h2o, ch4 and o3. many ofthe key technologies required for the construction of darwin have already beendemonstrated and the remainder are estimated to be mature in the near future.darwin is a mission that will ignite intense interest in both the researchcommunity and the wider public.

1507.00538	relationship between the column density distribution and evolutionary  class of molecular clouds as viewed by atlasgal	we present the first study of the relationship between the column densitydistribution of molecular clouds within nearby galactic spiral arms and theirevolutionary status as measured from their stellar content. we analyze a sampleof 195 molecular clouds located at distances below 5.5 kpc, identified from theatlasgal 870 micron data. we define three evolutionary classes within thissample: starless clumps, star-forming clouds with associated young stellarobjects, and clouds associated with hii regions. we find that the n(h2)probability density functions (n-pdfs) of these three classes of objects areclearly different: the n-pdfs of starless clumps are narrowest and close tolog-normal in shape, while star-forming clouds and hii regions exhibit apower-law shape over a wide range of column densities and log-normal-likecomponents only at low column densities. we use the n-pdfs to estimate theevolutionary time-scales of the three classes of objects based on a simpleanalytic model from literature. finally, we show that the integral of then-pdfs, the dense gas mass fraction, depends on the total mass of the regionsas measured by atlasgal: more massive clouds contain greater relative amountsof dense gas across all evolutionary classes.

astro-ph;0611336	a direct and differential imaging search for sub-stellar companions to  epsilon indi a	we have carried out a direct and differential imaging search for sub-stellarcompanions to eps indi a using the adaptive optics system naco at the eso vlt.the observations were carried out in september 2004 with naco/sdi as well aswith naco's s27 camera in the h and ks filters. the sdi data cover an area of\~2.8" around eps indi a. no detection was achieved in the inner neighbourhooddown to 53 mj (5 sigma confidence level) at a separation &gt; 0.4" (1.45 au) anddown to 21 mj for separations &gt; 1.3" (4.7 au). to cover a wider field of view,observations with the s27 camera and a coronagraphic mask were obtained. wedetected a faint source at a separation of (7.3 +/- 0.1)" and a position angleof (302.9 +/- 0.8) degree. the photometry for the candidate companion yieldsm(h)=(16.45 +/- 0.04)mag and m(ks) = (15.41 +/- 0.06)mag, respectively. thosemagnitudes and the resulting color (h-ks) = (1.04 +/- 0.07)mag fit best to aspectral type of l5 - l9.5 if it is bound. observations done with hst/nicmos bym. endl have shown the source to be a background object.

0810.0099	binarity at the l/t brown dwarf transition	current atmospheric models cannot reproduce some of the characteristics ofthe transition between the l dwarfs with cloudy atmospheres and the t dwarfswith dust-depleted photospheres. it has been proposed that a majority of thel/t transition brown dwarfs could actually be a combinaison of a cloudy l dwarfand a clear t dwarf. indeed binarity seems to occur more frequently among l/ttransition brown dwarfs.  we aim to refine the statistical significance of the seemingly higherfrequency of binaries. co-eval binaries would also be interesting test-beds forevolutionary models. we obtained high-resolution imaging for six mid-l tolate-t dwarfs, with photometric distances between 8 and 33pc, using theadaptive optics systems naco at the vlt, and the lick system, both with thelaser guide star.  we resolve none of our targets. combining our data with published results, weobtain a frequency of resolved l/t transition brown dwarfs of (31+21-15)%,compared to (21+10-7)% and (14+14-7)% for mid-l and t dwarfs (90% of confidencelevel). these fractions do not significantly support, nor contradict, thehypothesis of a larger binary fraction in the l/t transition. none of ourtargets has companions with effective temperatures as low as 360-1000k atseparations larger than 0.5".
