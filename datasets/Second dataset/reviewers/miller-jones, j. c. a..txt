0909.2790	probing the behaviour of the x-ray binary cygnus x-3 with  very-long-baseline radio interferometry	in order to test the recently proposed classification of the radio/x-raystates of the x-ray binary cyg x-3, we present an analysis of the radio dataavailable for the system at much higher spatial resolutions than used fordefining the states. the radio data set consists of archival vlba data at 5 or15 ghz and new e-evn data at 5 ghz. we also present 5 ghz merlin observationsof an outburst of cyg x-3. in the x-ray regime we use quasi-simultaneous withradio, monitoring and pointed rxte observations. we find that when the radioemission from both jet and core is globally considered, the behaviour of cygx-3 at milliarcsecond scales is consistent with that described at arcsecondscales. however, when the radio emission is disentangled in a core componentand a jet component the situation changes. it becomes clear that in activestates the radio emission from the jet is dominating that from the core. thisshows that in these states the overall radio flux cannot be used as a directtracer of the accretion state.

0912.1139	the complete spectrum of the neutron star x-ray binary 4u0614+091	we observed the neutron star (ns) ultra-compact x-ray binary 4u0614+091quasi-simultaneously in the radio band (vla), mid-ir/ir (spitzer/mips andirac), near-ir/optical (smarts), optical-uv (swift/uvot), soft and hard x-rays(swift/xrt and rxte). the source was steadily in its `hard state'. we detectedthe source in the whole range, for the first time in the radio band at 4.86 and8.46 ghz and in the mid-ir at 24 um, up to 100 kev. the optically thicksynchrotron spectrum of the jet is consistent with being flat from the radio tothe mid-ir band. the flat jet spectrum breaks in the range (1-4)x10^(13) hz toan optically-thin power-law synchrotron spectrum with spectral index ~-0.5.these observations allow us to estimate a lower limit on the jet radiativepower of ~3x10^(32) erg/s and a total jet power lj~10^(34) u_(0.05)^(-1)ec^(0.53) erg/s (where ec is the high-energy cutoff of the synchrotron spectrumin ev and u_(0.05) is the radiative efficiency in units of 0.05). thecontemporaneous detection of the optically thin part of the compact jet and thex-ray tail above 30 kev allows us to assess the contribution of the jet to thehard x-ray tail by synchrotron self-compton (ssc) processes. we conclude that,for realistic jet size, boosting, viewing angle and energy partition, the sscemission alone, from the post-shock, accelerated, non-thermal population in thejet, is not a viable mechanism to explain the observed hard x-ray tail of theneutron star 4u0614+091.

1004.1066	investigating the disc-jet coupling in accreting compact objects using  the black hole candidate swift j1753.5-0127	in studies of accreting black holes in binary systems, empirical relationshave been proposed to quantify the coupling between accretion processes andejection mechanisms. these processes are probed respectively by means of x-rayand radio/optical-infrared observations. the relations predict, given certainaccretion conditions, the expected energy output in the form of a jet. weinvestigated this coupling by studying the black hole candidate swiftj1753.5-0127, via multiwavelength coordinated observations over a period of ~4years. we present the results of our campaign showing that, all along theoutburst, the source features a jet that is fainter than expected from theempirical correlation between the radio and the x-ray luminosities in hardspectral state. because the jet is so weak in this system the near-infraredemission is, unusually for this state and luminosity, dominated by thermalemission from the accretion disc. we briefly discuss the importance and theimplications of a precise determination of both the slope and the normalisationof the correlations, listing some possible parameters that broadband jet modelsshould take into account to explain the population of sources characterized bya dim jet. we also investigate whether our data can give any hint about thenature of the compact object in the system, since its mass has not beendynamically measured.

1005.3066	evolution of the radio - x-ray coupling throughout an entire outburst of  aquila x-1	the 2009 november outburst of the neutron star x-ray binary aquila x-1 wasobserved with unprecedented radio coverage and simultaneous pointed x-rayobservations, tracing the radio emission around the full x-ray hysteresis loopof the outburst for the first time. we use these data to discuss the disc-jetcoupling, finding the radio emission to be consistent with being triggered atstate transitions, both from the hard to the soft spectral state and viceversa. our data appear to confirm previous suggestions of radio quenching inthe soft state above a threshold x-ray luminosity of about 10% of the eddingtonluminosity. we also present the first detections of aql x-1 with very longbaseline interferometry (vlbi), showing that any extended emission isrelatively diffuse, and consistent with steady jets rather than arising fromdiscrete, compact knots. in all cases where multi-frequency data wereavailable, the source radio spectrum is consistent with being flat or slightlyinverted, suggesting that the internal shock mechanism that is believed toproduce optically thin transient radio ejecta in black hole x-ray binaries isnot active in aql x-1.

0708.2296	linking jet emission, x-ray states and hard x-ray tails in the neutron  star x-ray binary gx 17+2	we present the results from simultaneous radio (very large array) and x-ray(rossi-x-ray timing explorer) observations of the z-type neutron star x-raybinary gx~17+2. the aim is to assess the coupling between x-ray and radioproperties throughout its three rapidly variable x-ray states and during thetime-resolved transitions. these observations allow us, for the first time, toinvestigate quantitatively the possible relations between the radio emissionand the presence of the hard x-ray tails and the x-ray state of the source. theobservations show: 1) a coupling between the radio jet emission and the x-raystate of the source, i.e. the position in the x-ray hardness-intensity diagram(hid); 2) a coupling between the presence of a hard x-ray tail and the positionin the hid, qualitatively similar to that found for the radio emission; 3) anindication for a quantitative positive correlation between the radio fluxdensity and the x-ray flux in the hard-tail power law component; 4) evidencefor the formation of a radio jet associated with the flaring branch-to-normalbranch x-ray state transition; 5) that the radio flux density of thenewly-formed jet stabilizes when also the normal-branch oscillation (nbo) inthe x-ray power spectrum stabilizes its characteristic frequency, suggesting apossible relation between x-ray variability associated to the nbo and the jetformation. we discuss our results in the context of jet models.

1012.3648	radio observations of candidate magnetic o stars	context: some o stars are suspected to have to have (weak) magnetic fieldsbecause of the observed cyclical variability in their uv wind-lines. however,direct detections of these magnetic fields using optical spectropolarimetryhave proven to be very difficult. aims: non-thermal radio emission in theseobjects would most likely be due to synchrotron radiation. as a magnetic fieldis required for the production of synchrotron radiation, this would be strongevidence for the presence of a magnetic field. such non-thermal emission hasalready been observed from the strongly magnetic ap/bp stars. methods: we haveperformed 6 &amp; 21 cm observations using the wsrt and use these, in combinationwith archival vla data at 3.6 cm and results from the literature, to study theradio emission of 5 selected candidate magnetic o stars. results: out of ourfive targets, we have detected three: $\xi$ per, which shows a non-thermalradio spectrum, and $\alpha$ cam and $\lambda$ cep, which show no evidence of anon-thermal spectrum. in general we find that the observed free-free (thermal)flux of the stellar wind is lower than expected. this is in agreement withrecent findings that the mass-loss rates from o stars as derived from theh$\alpha$ line are overestimated because of clumping in the inner part of thestellar wind.

1101.5159	radiatively efficient accreting black holes in the hard state: the case  study of h1743-322	in recent years, much effort has been devoted to unraveling the connectionbetween the accretion flow and the jets in accreting compact objects. in thepresent work, we report new constraints on these issues, through the long termstudy of the radio and x-ray behaviour of the black hole candidate h1743-322.this source is known to be one of the `outliers' of the universal radio/x-raycorrelation, i.e. a group of accreting stellar-mass black holes displayingfainter radio emission for a given x-ray luminosity than expected from thecorrelation. our study shows that the radio and x-ray emission of h1743-322 arestrongly correlated at high luminosity in the hard spectral state. however,this correlation is unusually steep for a black hole x-ray binary: b ~ 1.4(with l_{radio} \propto l_{x}^{b}). below a critical luminosity, thecorrelation becomes shallower until it rejoins the standard correlation with b~ 0.6. based on these results, we first show that the steep correlation can beexplained if the inner accretion flow is radiatively efficient during the hardstate, in contrast to what is usually assumed for black hole x-ray binaries inthis spectral state. the transition between the steep and the standardcorrelation would therefore reflect a change from a radiatively efficient to aradiatively inefficient accretion flow. finally, we investigate the possibilitythat the discrepancy between `outliers' and `standard' black holes arises fromthe outflow properties rather than from the accretion flow.

1103.0511	an automated archival vla transients survey	in this paper we present the results of a survey for radio transients usingdata obtained from the very large array archive. we have reduced, using apipeline procedure, 5037 observations of the most common pointings - i.e. thecalibrator fields. these fields typically contain a relatively bright pointsource and are used to calibrate `target' observations: they are thereforerarely imaged themselves. the observations used span a time range ~ 1984 - 2008and consist of eight different pointings, three different frequencies (8.4, 4.8and 1.4 ghz) and have a total observing time of 435 hours. we have searched fortransient and variable radio sources within these observations using componentsfrom the prototype lofar transient detection system. in this paper we presentthe methodology for reducing large volumes of very large array data; and wealso present a brief overview of the prototype lofar transient detectionalgorithms. no radio transients were detected in this survey, therefore weplace an upper limit on the snapshot rate of ghz frequency transients &gt; 8.0 mjyto rho less than or equal to 0.032 deg^-2 that have typical timescales 4.3 to45.3 days. we compare and contrast our upper limit with the snapshot rates -derived from either detections or non-detections of transient and variableradio sources - reported in the literature. when compared with the current logn - log s distribution formed from previous surveys, we show that our upperlimit is consistent with the observed population. current and future radiotransient surveys will hopefully further constrain these statistics, andpotentially discover dominant transient source populations. in this paper wealso briefly explore the current transient commissioning observations withlofar, and the impact they will make on the field.

1104.1115	the influence of spin on jet power in neutron star x-ray binaries	we investigate the role of the compact object in the production of jets fromneutron star x-ray binaries. the goal is to quantify the effect of the neutronstar spin, if any, in powering the jet. we compile all the available measuresor estimates of the neutron star spin frequency in jet-detected neutron starx-ray binaries. we use as an estimate of the ranking jet power for each source,the normalisation of the power law which fits the x-ray/radio andx-ray/infrared luminosity correlations l_(radio/ir) proportional tol_(x)^(gamma) (using infrared data for which there is evidence for jetemission). we find a possible relation between spin frequency and jet power(spearman rank 97%), when fitting the x-ray/radio luminosity correlation usinga power law with slope 1.4; gamma=1.4 is observed in 4u 1728-34 and ispredicted for a radiatively efficient disc and a total jet power proportionalto the mass accretion rate. if we use a slope of 0.6, as observed in aql x-1,no significant relation is found. an indication for a similar positivecorrelation is also found for accreting millisecond x-ray pulsars (spearmanrank 92%), if we fit the x-ray/infrared luminosity correlation using a powerlaw with slope 1.4. while our use of the normalisation of the luminositycorrelations as a measure of the ranking jet power is subject to largeuncertainties, no better proxy for the jet power is available. however, we urgecaution in over-interpreting the spin-jet power correlations, particularlygiven the strong dependence of our result on the (highly uncertain) assumedpower law index of the luminosity correlations. we discuss the results in theframework of current models for jet formation in black holes and young stellarobjects and speculate on possible different jet production mechanisms forneutron stars depending on the accretion mode.

1106.0723	testing the jet quenching paradigm with an ultradeep observation of a  steadily soft state black hole	we present ultradeep radio observations with the expanded very large array of4u 1957+11, a galactic black hole candidate x-ray binary known to exist in apersistent soft x-ray state. we derive a stringent upper limit of 11.4 micro-jybeam^-1 (3 sigma) at 5-7 ghz, which provides the most rigorous upper limit todate on the presence of jets in a soft state black hole x-ray binary. x-ray, uvand optical fluxes obtained within a few weeks of the radio data can beexplained by thermal emission from the disk. at this x-ray luminosity, a hardstate black hole x-ray binary that follows the established empiricalradio--x-ray correlation would be at least 330-810 times brighter at radiofrequencies, depending on the distance to 4u 1957+11. this jet quenching of &gt;2.5 orders of magnitude is greater than some models predict, and implies thejets are prevented from being launched altogether in the soft state. 4u 1957+11is also more than one order of magnitude fainter than the faintest of the'radio-quiet' population of hard state black holes. in addition, we show thaton average, soft state stellar-mass bhs probably have fainter jets than mostactive galactic nuclei in a state equivalent to the soft state. these resultshave implications for the conditions required for powerful, relativistic jetsto form, and provide a new empirical constraint for time- and accretionmode-dependent jet models, furthering our understanding of jet production andaccretion onto bhs.

1110.4374	a weak compact jet in a soft state of cygnus x-1	we present evidence for the presence of a weak compact jet during a softx-ray state of cygnus x-1. very-high-resolution radio observations were takenwith the vlba, evn and merlin during a hard-to-soft spectral state change,showing the hard state jet to be suppressed by a factor of about 3-5 in radioflux and unresolved to direct imaging observations (i.e. &lt; 1 mas at 4 cm). hightime-resolution x-ray observations with the rxte-pca were also taken during theradio monitoring period, showing the source to make the transition from thehard state to a softer state (via an intermediate state), although the sourcemay never have reached the canonical soft state. using astrometric vlbianalysis and removing proper motion, parallax and orbital motion signatures,the residual positions show a scatter of ~0.2 mas (at 4 cm) and ~3 mas (at 13cm) along the position angle of the known jet axis; these residuals suggestthere is a weak unresolved outflow, with varying size or opacity, duringintermediate and soft x-ray states. furthermore, no evidence was found forextended knots or shocks forming within the jet during the state transition,suggesting the change in outflow rate may not be sufficiently high to producesuperluminal knots.

1206.5729	the absence of radio emission from the globular cluster g1	the detections of both x-ray and radio emission from the cluster g1 in m31have provided strong support for existing dynamical evidence for anintermediate mass black hole (imbh) of mass 1.8 +/- 0.5 x 10^4 solar masses atthe cluster center. however, given the relatively low significance andastrometric accuracy of the radio detection, and the non-simultaneity of thex-ray and radio measurements, this identification required furtherconfirmation. here we present deep, high angular resolution, strictlysimultaneous x-ray and radio observations of g1. while the x-ray emission (l_x= 1.74^{+0.53}_{-0.44} x 10^{36} (d/750 kpc)^2 erg/s in the 0.5-10 kev band)remained fully consistent with previous observations, we detected no radioemission from the cluster center down to a 3-sigma upper limit of 4.7microjy/beam. our favored explanation for the previous radio detection isflaring activity from a black hole low mass x-ray binary (lmxb). we performed anew regression of the fundamental plane of black hole activity, valid fordetermining black hole mass from radio and x-ray observations of sub-eddingtonblack holes, finding log m_{bh} = (1.638 +/- 0.070)log l_r - (1.136 +/-0.077)log l_x - (6.863 +/- 0.790), with an empirically-determined uncertaintyof 0.44 dex. this constrains the mass of the x-ray source in g1, if a blackhole, to be &lt;9700 solar masses at 95% confidence, suggesting that it is apersistent lmxb. this annuls what was previously the most convincing evidencefrom radiation for an imbh in the local group, though the evidence for an imbhin g1 from velocity dispersion measurements remains unaffected by theseresults.

1211.1655	jet spectral breaks in black hole x-ray binaries	in x-ray binaries, compact jets are known to commonly radiate at radio toinfrared frequencies, whereas at optical to gamma-ray energies, thecontribution of the jet is debated. the total luminosity, and hence power ofthe jet is critically dependent on the position of the break in its spectrum,between optically thick (self-absorbed) and optically thin synchrotronemission. this break, or turnover, has been reported in just one black holex-ray binary (bhxb) thus far, gx 339-4, and inferred via spectral fitting intwo others, a0620-00 and cyg x-1. here, we collect a wealth of multiwavelengthdata from the outbursts of bhxbs during hard x-ray states, in order to searchfor jet breaks as yet unidentified in their spectral energy distributions. inparticular, we report the direct detection of the jet break in the spectrum ofv404 cyg during its 1989 outburst, at nu_b = (1.8 +- 0.3) x 10^14 hz (1.7 +-0.2 microns). we increase the number of bhxbs with measured jet breaks fromthree to eight. jet breaks are found at frequencies spanning more than twoorders of magnitude, from nu_b = (4.5 +- 0.8) x 10^12 hz for xte j1118+480during its 2005 outburst, to nu_b &gt; 4.7 x 10^14 hz for v4641 sgr in outburst. apositive correlation between jet break frequency and luminosity is expectedtheoretically; nu_b \propto l_nu,jet^~0.5 if other parameters are constant.with constraints on the jet break in a total of 12 bhxbs including twoquiescent systems, we find a large range of jet break frequencies at similarluminosities and no obvious global relation (but such a relation cannot beruled out for individual sources). we speculate that different magnetic fieldstrengths and/or different radii of the acceleration zone in the inner regionsof the jet are likely to be responsible for the observed scatter betweensources.

1304.3510	an evolving compact jet in the black hole x-ray binary maxi j1836-194	we report striking changes in the broadband spectrum of the compact jet ofthe black hole transient maxi j1836-194 over state transitions during itsdiscovery outburst in 2011. a fading of the optical-infrared (ir) flux occurredas the source entered the hard-intermediate state, followed by a brightening asit returned to the hard state. the optical-ir spectrum was consistent with apower law from optically thin synchrotron emission, except when the x-rayspectrum was softest. by fitting the radio to optical spectra with a brokenpower law, we constrain the frequency and flux of the optically thick/thinbreak in the jet synchrotron spectrum. the break gradually shifted to higherfrequencies as the source hardened at x-ray energies, from ~ 10^11 to ~ 4 x10^13 hz. the radiative jet luminosity integrated over the spectrum appeared tobe greatest when the source entered the hard state during the outburst decay(although this is dependent on the high energy cooling break, which is not seendirectly), even though the radio flux was fading at the time. the physicalprocess responsible for suppressing and reactivating the jet (neither of whichare instantaneous but occur on timescales of weeks) is uncertain, but couldarise from the varying inner accretion disk radius regulating the fraction ofaccreting matter that is channeled into the jet. this provides an unprecedentedinsight into the connection between inflow and outflow, and has implicationsfor the conditions required for jets to be produced, and hence their launchingprocess.

1503.08634	radio monitoring of the hard state jets in the 2011 outburst of maxi  j1836-194	maxi j1836-194 is a galactic black hole candidate x-ray binary that wasdiscovered in 2011 when it went into outburst. in this paper, we present thefull radio monitoring of this system during its `failed' outburst, in which thesource did not complete a full set of state changes, only transitioning as faras the hard intermediate state. observations with the karl g. jansky very largearray (vla) and australia telescope compact array (atca) show that the jetproperties changed significantly during the outburst. the vla observationsdetected linearly polarised emission at a level of ~1% early in the outburst,increasing to ~3% as the outburst peaked. high-resolution images with the verylong baseline array (vlba) show a ~15 mas jet along the position angle $-21 \pm2^\circ$, in agreement with the electric vector position angle found from ourpolarisation results ($-21 \pm 4^\circ$), implying that the magnetic field isperpendicular to the jet. astrometric observations suggest that the systemrequired an asymmetric natal kick to explain its observed space velocity.comparing quasi-simultaneous x-ray monitoring with the 5 ghz vla observationsfrom the 2011 outburst shows an unusually steep hard-state radio/x-raycorrelation of $l_{\rm r} \propto l_{\rm x}^{1.8\pm0.2}$, where $l_{\rm r}$ and$l_{\rm x}$ denote the radio and x-ray luminosities, respectively. with atcaand swift monitoring of the source during a period of re-brightening in 2012,we show that the system lay on the same steep correlation. due to the lowinclination of this system, we then investigate the possibility that theobserved correlation may have been steepened by variable doppler boosting.

1503.08874	vlt spectroscopy of the black hole candidate swift j1357.2-0933 in  quiescence	we present time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the counterpart to thehigh-inclination black hole low-mass x-ray binary swift j1357.2-0933 inquiescence. absorption features from the mass donor star were not detected.instead the spectra display prominent broad double-peaked halpha emission andweaker hei emission lines. from the halpha peak-to-peak separation we constrainthe radial velocity semi-amplitude of the donor star to &gt; 789 km/s. furtheranalysis through radial velocity and equivalent width measurements indicatesthat the halpha line is free of variability due to s-wave components or disceclipses. from our data and previous observations during outburst, we concludethat long-term radial velocity changes ascribed to a precessing disc were oflow amplitude or not present. this implies that the centroid position of theline should closely represent the systemic radial velocity. using the derivedsystemic velocity of -150 km/s and the best available limits on the sourcedistance, we infer that the black hole is moving towards the plane in itscurrent galactic orbit unless the proper motion is substantial. finally, thedepth of the central absorption in the double peaked profiles adds support forswift j1357.2-0933 as a high-inclination system. on the other hand, we arguethat the low hydrogen column density inferred from x-ray fitting suggests thatthe system is not seen edge-on.

1506.01141	radio polarimetry as a probe of unresolved jets: the 2013 outburst of  xte j1908+094	xte j1908+094 is an x-ray transient black hole candidate in the galacticplane that was observed in outburst in 2002 and 2013. here we presentmulti-frequency radio and x-ray data, including radio polarimetry, spanning theentire period of the 2013 outburst. we find that the x-ray behaviour of xtej1908+094 traces the standard black hole hardness-intensity path, evolving froma hard state, through a soft state, before returning to a hard state andquiescence. its radio behaviour is typical of a compact jet that becomesquenched before discrete ejecta are launched during the late stages of x-raysoftening. the radio and x-ray fluxes, as well as the light curve morphologies,are consistent with those observed during the 2002 outburst of this source. thepolarisation angle during the rise of the outburst infers a jet orientation inagreement with resolved observations but also displays a gradual drift, whichwe associate with observed changes in the structure of the discrete ejecta. wealso observe an unexpected 90deg rotation of the polarisation angle associatedwith a second component.

1506.02988	the evolution of a jet ejection of the ultraluminous x-ray source  holmberg ii x-1	we present quasi-simultaneous, multi-epoch radio and x-ray measurements ofholmberg ii x-1 using the european vlbi network (evn), the karl g. jansky verylarge array (vla), and the chandra and swift x-ray telescopes. the x-ray datashow apparently hard spectra with steady x-ray luminosities 4 months apart fromeach other. in the high-resolution evn radio observations, we have detected anextended milli-arcsecond scale source with unboosted radio emission. the sourceemits non-thermal, likely optically thin synchrotron emission and itsmorphology is consistent with a jet ejection. the 9-ghz vla data show anarcsecond-scale triple structure of holmberg ii x-1 similar to that seen atlower frequencies. however, we find that the central ejection has faded by atleast a factor of 7.3 over 1.5 years. we estimate the dynamical age of theejection to be higher than 2.1 years. we show that such a rapid cooling can beexplained with simple adiabatic expansion losses. these properties of holmbergii x-1 imply that ulx radio bubbles may be inflated by ejecta instead ofself-absorbed compact jets.

1507.06659	correlated optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray flaring activity seen with  integral during the 2015 outburst of v404 cygni	after 25 years of quiescence, the microquasar v404 cyg entered a new periodof activity in june 2015. this x-ray source is known to undergo extremelybright and variable outbursts seen at all wavelengths. it is therefore anobject of prime interest to understand the accretion-ejection connections.these can, however, only be probed through simultaneous observations at severalwavelengths. we made use of the integral instruments to obtain long, almostuninterrupted observations from 2015 june 20$^{\mathrm{th}}$, 15:50 utc to june25$^{\mathrm{th}}$, 4:05 utc, from the optical v-band, up to the soft$\gamma$-rays. v404 cyg was extremely variable in all bands, with the detectionof 18 flares with fluxes exceeding 6 crab (20--40 kev) within 3 days. the flarerecurrence can be as short as $\sim$ 20~min from peak to peak. amodel-independent analysis shows that the $&gt;$6 crab flares have a hardspectrum. a simple 10--400 kev spectral analysis of the off-flare and flareperiods shows that the variation in intensity is likely to be due to variationsof a cut-off power law component only. the optical flares seem to be at leastof two different types: one occurring in simultaneity with the x-ray flares,the other showing a delay greater than 10 min. the former could be associatedwith x-ray reprocessing by either an accretion disk or the companion star. wesuggest that the latter are associated with plasma ejections that have alsobeen seen in radio.

1507.07613	a stacked search for intermediate-mass black holes in 337 extragalactic  star clusters	forbes et al. recently used the hubble space telescope to localize hundredsof candidate star clusters in ngc 1023, an early-type galaxy at a distance of11.1 mpc. old stars dominate the light of 92% of the clusters andintermediate-age stars dominate the light of the remaining 8%. theory predictsthat clusters with such ages can host intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs)with masses m_bh \lesssim 10^5 m_sun. to investigate this prediction, we used264 s of 5.5 ghz data from the karl g. jansky very large array (vla) to searchfor the radiative signatures of imbh accretion from 337 candidate clusters inan image spanning 492 arcsec (26 kpc) with a resolution of 0.40 arcsec (22 pc).none of the individual clusters are detected, nor are weighted-mean imagestacks of the 311 old clusters, the 26 intermediate-age clusters, and the 20clusters with stellar masses m_star \gtrsim 7.5 x 10^5 m_sun. the clusters thuslack radio analogs of hlx-1, a strong imbh candidate in a cluster in theearly-type galaxy eso 243-49. this suggests that hlx-1 is accreting gas relatedto its cluster's light-dominating young stars. alternatively, the hlx-1phenomenon could be so rare that no radio analog is expected in ngc 1023. also,using a formalism heretofore applied to star clusters in the milky way, theradio-luminosity upper limit for the massive-cluster stack corresponds to amean 3$\sigma$ imbh mass of m_bh(massive) &lt; 2.3 x 10^5 m_sun, suggesting meanblack-hole mass fractions of m_bh(massive)/m_star &lt; 0.05-0.29.

1509.01257	the lofar multifrequency snapshot sky survey (msss) i. survey  description and first results	we present the multifrequency snapshot sky survey (msss), the firstnorthern-sky lofar imaging survey. in this introductory paper, we firstdescribe in detail the motivation and design of the survey. compared toprevious radio surveys, msss is exceptional due to its intrinsic multifrequencynature providing information about the spectral properties of the detectedsources over more than two octaves (from 30 to 160 mhz). the broadbandfrequency coverage, together with the fast survey speed generated by lofar'smultibeaming capabilities, make msss the first survey of the sort anticipatedto be carried out with the forthcoming square kilometre array (ska). two of thesixteen frequency bands included in the survey were chosen to exactly overlapthe frequency coverage of large-area very large array (vla) and giant metrewaveradio telescope (gmrt) surveys at 74 mhz and 151 mhz respectively. the surveyperformance is illustrated within the "msss verification field" (mvf), a regionof 100 square degrees centered at j2000 (ra,dec)=(15h,69deg). the msss resultsfrom the mvf are compared with previous radio survey catalogs. we assess theflux and astrometric uncertainties in the catalog, as well as the completenessand reliability considering our source finding strategy. we determine the 90%completeness levels within the mvf to be 100 mjy at 135 mhz with 108"resolution, and 550 mjy at 50 mhz with 166" resolution. images and catalogs forthe full survey, expected to contain 150,000-200,000 sources, will be releasedto a public web server. we outline the plans for the ongoing production of thefinal survey products, and the ultimate public release of images and sourcecatalogs.

1509.02579	deep radio imaging of 47 tuc identifies the peculiar x-ray source x9 as  a new black hole candidate	we report the detection of steady radio emission from the known x-ray sourcex9 in the globular cluster 47 tuc. with a double-peaked c iv emission line inits ultraviolet spectrum providing a clear signature of accretion, this sourcehad been previously classified as a cataclysmic variable. in deep atca imagingfrom 2010 and 2013, we identified a steady radio source at both 5.5 and 9.0ghz, with a radio spectral index (defined as $s_{\nu}\propto\nu^{\alpha}$) of$\alpha=-0.4\pm0.4$. our measured flux density of $42\pm4$ microjy/beam at 5.5ghz implies a radio luminosity ($\nu l_{\nu}$) of 5.8e27 erg/s, significantlyhigher than any previous radio detection of an accreting white dwarf.transitional millisecond pulsars, which have the highest radio-to-x-ray fluxratios among accreting neutron stars (still a factor of a few below accretingblack holes at the same x-ray luminosity), show distinctly different patternsof x-ray and radio variability than x9. when combined with archival x-raymeasurements, our radio detection places 47 tuc x9 very close to theradio/x-ray correlation for accreting black holes, and we explore thepossibility that this source is instead a quiescent stellar-mass black holex-ray binary. the nature of the donor star is uncertain; although theluminosity of the optical counterpart is consistent with a low-mass mainsequence donor star, the mass transfer rate required to produce the highquiescent x-ray luminosity of 1e33 erg/s suggests the system may instead beultracompact, with an orbital period of order 25 minutes. this is the fourthquiescent black hole candidate discovered to date in a galactic globularcluster, and the only one with a confirmed accretion signature from itsoptical/ultraviolet spectrum.

1509.06396	wide-band, low-frequency pulse profiles of 100 radio pulsars with lofar	lofar offers the unique capability of observing pulsars across the 10-240 mhzfrequency range with a fractional bandwidth of roughly 50%. this spectral rangeis well-suited for studying the frequency evolution of pulse profile morphologycaused by both intrinsic and extrinsic effects: such as changing emissionaltitude in the pulsar magnetosphere or scatter broadening by the interstellarmedium, respectively. the magnitude of most of these effects increases rapidlytowards low frequencies. lofar can thus address a number of open questionsabout the nature of radio pulsar emission and its propagation through theinterstellar medium. we present the average pulse profiles of 100 pulsarsobserved in the two lofar frequency bands: high band (120-167 mhz, 100profiles) and low band (15-62 mhz, 26 profiles). we compare them withwesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) and lovell telescope observationsat higher frequencies (350 and1400 mhz) in order to study the profileevolution. the profiles are aligned in absolute phase by folding with a new setof timing solutions from the lovell telescope, which we present along withprecise dispersion measures obtained with lofar. we find that the profileevolution with decreasing radio frequency does not follow a specific trend but,depending on the geometry of the pulsar, new components can enter into, or behidden from, view. nonetheless, in general our observations confirm thewidening of pulsar profiles at low frequencies, as expected fromradius-to-frequency mapping or birefringence theories. we offer this catalog oflow-frequency pulsar profiles in a user friendly way via the epn database ofpulsar profiles (http://www.epta.eu.org/epndb/).

1510.08122	a connection between plasma conditions near black hole event horizons  and outflow properties	accreting black holes are responsible for producing the fastest, mostpowerful outflows of matter in the universe. the formation process of powerfuljets close to black holes is poorly understood, and the conditions leading tojet formation are currently hotly debated. in this paper, we report anunambiguous empirical correlation between the properties of the plasma close tothe black hole and the particle acceleration properties within jets launchedfrom the central regions of accreting stellar-mass and supermassive blackholes. in these sources the emission of the plasma near the black hole ischaracterized by a power law at x-ray energies during times when the jets areproduced. we find that the photon index of this power law, which givesinformation on the underlying particle distribution, correlates with thecharacteristic break frequency in the jet spectrum, which is dependent onmagnetohydrodynamical processes in the outflow. the observed range in breakfrequencies varies by five orders of magnitude, in sources that span nineorders of magnitude in black hole mass, revealing a similarity of jetproperties over a large range of black hole masses powering these jets. thiscorrelation demonstrates that the internal properties of the jet rely mostcritically on the conditions of the plasma close to the black hole, rather thanother parameters such as the black hole mass or spin, and will provide abenchmark that should be reproduced by the jet formation models.

astro-ph;0601482	opening angles, lorentz factors and confinement of x-ray binary jets	we present a collation of the available data on the opening angles of jets inx-ray binaries, which in most cases are small (less than 10 degrees). under theassumption of no confinement, we calculate the lorentz factors required toproduce such small opening angles via the transverse relativistic dopplereffect. the derived lorentz factors, which are in most cases lower limits, arefound to be large, with a mean greater than 10, comparable to those estimatedfor agn and much higher than the commonly-assumed values for x-ray binaries of2 to 5. jet power constraints do not in most cases rule out such high lorentzfactors. the upper limits on the opening angles show no evidence for smallerlorentz factors in the steady jets of cygnus x-1 and grs 1915+105. in thosesources in which deceleration has been observed (notably xte j1550-564 andcygnus x-3), some confinement of the jets must be occurring, and we brieflydiscuss possible confinement mechanisms. it is however possible that all thejets could be confined, in which case the requirement for high bulk lorentzfactors can be relaxed.

astro-ph;0602307	a transient relativistic radio jet from cygnus x-1	we report the first observation of a transient relativistic jet from thecanonical black hole candidate, cygnus x-1, obtained with the multi-elementradio-linked interferometer network (merlin). the jet was observed in only oneof six epochs of merlin imaging of the source during a phase of repeated x-rayspectral transitions in 2004 jan--feb, and this epoch corresponded to thesoftest 1.5-12 kev x-ray spectrum. with only a single epoch revealing the jet,we cannot formally constrain its velocity. nevertheless, several lines ofreasoning suggest that the jet was probably launched 0.5-4.0 days before thisbrightening, corresponding to projected velocities of 0.2c &lt; v_app &lt; 1.6c, andan intrinsic velocity of &gt; 0.3c. we also report the occurrence of a major radioflare from cyg x-1, reaching a flux density of ~120 mjy at 15 ghz, and yet notassociated with any resolvable radio emission, despite a concerted effort withmerlin. we discuss the resolved jet in terms of the recently proposed 'unifiedmodel' for the disc-jet coupling in black hole x-ray binaries, and tentativelyidentify the 'jet line' for cyg x-1. the source is consistent with the model inthe sense that a steady jet appears to persist initially when the x-rayspectrum starts softening, and that once the spectral softening is complete thecore radio emission is suppressed and transient ejecta / shock observed.however, there are some anomalies, and cyg x-1 clearly does not behave like anormal black hole transient in progressing to the canonical soft / thermalstate once the ejection event has happened.

0812.3327	the formation of the black hole in the x-ray binary system v404 cyg	using new and archival radio data, we have measured the proper motion of theblack hole x-ray binary v404 cyg to be 9.2+/-0.3 mas/yr. combined with thesystemic radial velocity from the literature, we derive the fullthree-dimensional heliocentric space velocity of the system, which we use tocalculate a peculiar velocity in the range 47-102 km/s, with a best fittingvalue of 64 km/s. we consider possible explanations for the observed peculiarvelocity, and find that the black hole cannot have formed via direct collapse.a natal supernova is required, in which either significant mass (approximately11 solar masses) was lost, giving rise to a symmetric blaauw kick of up to 65km/s, or, more probably, asymmetries in the supernova led to an additional kickout of the orbital plane of the binary system. in the case of a purelysymmetric kick, the black hole must have been formed with a mass ofapproximately 9 solar masses, since when it has accreted 0.5-1.5 solar massesfrom its companion.
