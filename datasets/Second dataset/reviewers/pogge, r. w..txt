0904.0251	a revised broad-line region radius and black hole mass for the  narrow-line seyfert 1 ngc 4051	we present the first results from a high sampling rate, multi-monthreverberation mapping campaign undertaken primarily at mdm observatory withsupporting observations from telescopes around the world. the primary goal ofthis campaign was to obtain either new or improved hbeta reverberation lagmeasurements for several relatively low luminosity agns. we feature results forngc 4051 here because, until now, this object has been a significant outlierfrom agn scaling relationships, e.g., it was previously a ~2-3sigma outlier onthe relationship between the broad-line region (blr) radius and the opticalcontinuum luminosity - the r_blr-l relationship. our new measurements of thelag time between variations in the continuum and hbeta emission line made fromspectroscopic monitoring of ngc 4051 lead to a measured blr radius of r_blr =1.87 (+0.54 -0.50) light days and black hole mass of m_bh = 1.73 (+0.55 -0.52)x 10^6 m_sun. this radius is consistent with that expected from the r_blr-lrelationship, based on the present luminosity of ngc 4051 and the most currentcalibration of the relation by bentz et al. (2009a). we also present apreliminary look at velocity-resolved hbeta light curves and time delaymeasurements, although we are unable to reconstruct an unambiguousvelocity-resolved reverberation signal.

0907.3471	mass measurement of a single unseen star and planetary detection  efficiency for ogle 2007-blg-050	we analyze ogle-2007-blg-050, a high magnification microlensing event (a ~432) whose peak occurred on 2 may, 2007, with pronounced finite-source andparallax effects. we compute planet detection efficiencies for this event inorder to determine its sensitivity to the presence of planets around the lensstar. both finite-source and parallax effects permit a measurement of theangular einstein radius \theta_e = 0.48 +/- 0.01 mas and the parallax \pi_e =0.12 +/- 0.03, leading to an estimate of the lens mass m = 0.50 +/- 0.14 m_sunand its distance to the observer d_l = 5.5 +/- 0.4 kpc. this is only the seconddetermination of a reasonably precise (&lt;30%) mass estimate for an isolatedunseen object, using any method. this allows us to calculate the planetarydetection efficiency in physical units (r_\perp, m_p), where r_\perp is theprojected planet-star separation and m_p is the planet mass. when computingplanet detection efficiency, we did not find any planetary signature and ourdetection efficiency results reveal significant sensitivity to neptune-massplanets, and to a lesser extent earth-mass planets in some configurations.indeed, jupiter and neptune-mass planets are excluded with a high confidencefor a large projected separation range between the planet and the lens star,respectively [0.6 - 10] and [1.4 - 4] au, and earth-mass planets are excludedwith a 10% confidence in the lensing zone, i.e. [1.8 - 3.1] au.

0911.5581	interpretation of strong short-term central perturbations in the light  curves of moderate-magnification microlensing events	to improve the planet detection efficiency, current planetary microlensingexperiments are focused on high-magnification events searching for planetarysignals near the peak of lensing light curves. however, it is known thatcentral perturbations can also be produced by binary companions and thus it isimportant to distinguish planetary signals from those induced by binarycompanions. in this paper, we analyze the light curves of microlensing eventsogle-2007-blg-137/moa-2007-blg-091, ogle-2007-blg-355/moa-2007-blg-278, andmoa-2007-blg-199/ogle-2007-blg-419, for all of which exhibit short-termperturbations near the peaks of the light curves. from detailed modeling of thelight curves, we find that the perturbations of the events are caused by binarycompanions rather than planets. from close examination of the light curvescombined with the underlying physical geometry of the lens system obtained frommodeling, we find that the short time-scale caustic-crossing feature occurringat a low or a moderate base magnification with an additional secondaryperturbation is a typical feature of binary-lens events and thus can be usedfor the discrimination between the binary and planetary interpretations.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

1006.1396	determining the physical lens parameters of the binary gravitational  microlensing event moa-2009-blg-016	we report the result of the analysis of the light curve of the microlensingevent moa-2009-blg-016. the light curve is characterized by a short-durationanomaly near the peak and an overall asymmetry. we find that the peak anomalyis due to a binary companion to the primary lens and the asymmetry of the lightcurve is explained by the parallax effect caused by the acceleration of theobserver over the course of the event due to the orbital motion of the eartharound the sun. in addition, we detect evidence for the effect of the finitesize of the source near the peak of the event, which allows us to measure theangular einstein radius of the lens system. the einstein radius combined withthe microlens parallax allows us to determine the total mass of the lens andthe distance to the lens. we identify three distinct classes of degeneratesolutions for the binary lens parameters, where two are manifestations of thepreviously identified degeneracies of close/wide binaries and positive/negativeimpact parameters, while the third class is caused by the symmetric cycloidshape of the caustic. we find that, for the best-fit solution, the estimatedmass of the lower-mass component of the binary is (0.04 +- 0.01) m_sun,implying a brown-dwarf companion. however, there exists a solution that isworse only by \delta\chi^2 ~ 3 for which the mass of the secondary is above thehydrogen-burning limit. unfortunately, resolving these two degenerate solutionswill be difficult as the relative lens-source proper motions for both aresimilar and small (~ 1 mas/yr) and thus the lens will remain blended with thesource for the next several decades.

1204.2869	characterizing low-mass binaries from observation of long time-scale  caustic-crossing gravitational microlensing events	despite astrophysical importance of binary star systems, detections arelimited to those located in small ranges of separations, distances, and massesand thus it is necessary to use a variety of observational techniques for acomplete view of stellar multiplicity across a broad range of physicalparameters. in this paper, we report the detections and measurements of 2binaries discovered from observations of microlensing events moa-2011-blg-090and ogle-2011-blg-0417. determinations of the binary masses are possible bysimultaneously measuring the einstein radius and the lens parallax. themeasured masses of the binary components are 0.43 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.39$m_{\odot}$ for moa-2011-blg-090 and 0.57 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.17 $m_{\odot}$ forogle-2011-blg-0417 and thus both lens components of moa-2011-blg-090 and onecomponent of ogle-2011-blg-0417 are m dwarfs, demonstrating the usefulness ofmicrolensing in detecting binaries composed of low-mass components. frommodeling of the light curves considering full keplerian motion of the lens, wealso measure the orbital parameters of the binaries. the blended light ofogle-2011-blg-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself, making it possibleto check the microlensing orbital solution by follow-up radial-velocityobservation. for both events, the caustic-crossing parts of the light curves,which are critical for determining the physical lens parameters, were resolvedby high-cadence survey observations and thus it is expected that the number ofmicrolensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase in thefuture.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1205.6323	moa-2010-blg-477lb: constraining the mass of a microlensing planet from  microlensing parallax, orbital motion and detection of blended light	microlensing detections of cool planets are important for the construction ofan unbiased sample to estimate the frequency of planets beyond the snow line,which is where giant planets are thought to form according to the coreaccretion theory of planet formation. in this paper, we report the discovery ofa giant planet detected from the analysis of the light curve of ahigh-magnification microlensing event moa-2010-blg-477. the measuredplanet-star mass ratio is $q=(2.181\pm0.004)\times 10^{-3}$ and the projectedseparation is $s=1.1228\pm0.0006$ in units of the einstein radius. the angulareinstein radius is unusually large $\theta_{\rm e}=1.38\pm 0.11$ mas. combiningthis measurement with constraints on the "microlens parallax" and the lensflux, we can only limit the host mass to the range $0.13&lt;m/m_\odot&lt;1.0$. inthis particular case, the strong degeneracy between microlensing parallax andplanet orbital motion prevents us from measuring more accurate host and planetmasses. however, we find that adding bayesian priors from two effects (galacticmodel and keplerian orbit) each independently favors the upper end of this massrange, yielding star and planet masses of $m_*=0.67^{+0.33}_{-0.13}\ m_\odot$and $m_p=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}\ m_{\rm jup}$ at a distance of $d=2.3\pm0.6$ kpc,and with a semi-major axis of $a=2^{+3}_{-1}$ au. finally, we show that thelens mass can be determined from future high-resolution near-ir adaptive opticsobservations independently from two effects, photometric and astrometric.

1207.5755	the unusual temporal and spectral evolution of sn2011ht. ii. peculiar  type iin or impostor?	sn2011ht has been described both as a true supernova and as an impostor. inthis paper, we conclude that it does not match some basic expectations for acore-collapse event. we discuss sn2011ht's spectral evolution from a hot densewind to a cool dense wind, followed by the post-plateau appearance of a fasterlow density wind during a rapid decline in luminosity. we identify a slow densewind expanding at only 500--600 km/s, present throughout the eruption. a fasterwind speed v ~ 900 km/s may be identified with a second phase of the outburst.there is no direct or significant evidence for any flow speed above 1000 km/s;the broad asymmetric wings of balmer emission lines in the hot wind phase weredue to thomson scattering, not bulk motion. we estimate a mass loss rate oforder 0.04 msun/yr during the hot dense wind phase of the event. there is noevidence that the kinetic energy substantially exceeded the luminous energy,roughly 2 x 10^49 ergs; so the total energy was far less than a true sn. wesuggest that sn2011ht was a giant eruption driven by super-eddington radiationpressure, perhaps beginning about 6 months before the discovery. a stronglynon-spherical sn might also account for the data, at the cost of more freeparameters.

1210.3027	no stripped hydrogen in the nebular spectra of nearby type ia supernova  2011fe	a generic prediction of the single-degenerate model for type ia supernovae(sne ia) is that a significant amount of material will be stripped from thedonor star (~0.5 msun for a giant donor and ~0.15 msun for a main sequencedonor) by the supernova ejecta. this material, excited by gamma-rays fromradioactive decay, would then produce relatively narrow (1000 km s-1) emissionfeatures observable once the supernova enters the nebular phase. such emissionhas never been detected, which already provides strong constraints on type iaprogenitor models. in this letter we report the deepest limit yet on thepresence of h-alpha emission originating from the stripped hydrogen in thenebular spectrum of a type ia supernova obtained using a high signal-to-noisespectrum of the nearby normal sn ia 2011fe 274 days after b-band maximum lightwith the large binocular telescope's multi-object double spectrograph. we put aconservative upper limit on the h-alpha flux of 3.14 x 10^-17 erg s-1 cm-2,which corresponds to a luminosity of 1.57 x 10^35 erg s-1. by scaling modelsfrom the literature, our flux limit translates into an upper limit of 0.001msun of stripped material. this is an order of magnitude stronger than previouslimits. sn 2011fe was a typical type ia supernova, special only in itsproximity, and we argue that lack of hydrogen emission in its nebular spectrumadds yet another strong constraint on the single degenerate class of models forsne ia.

1210.4265	the second multiple-planet system discovered by microlensing:  ogle-2012-blg-0026lb, c, a pair of jovian planets beyond the snow line	we report the discovery of a planetary system from observation of thehigh-magnification microlensing event ogle-2012-blg-0026. the lensing lightcurve exhibits a complex central perturbation with multiple features. we findthat the perturbation was produced by two planets located near the einsteinring of the planet host star. we identify 4 possible solutions resulting fromthe well-known close/wide degeneracy. by measuring both the lens parallax andthe einstein radius, we estimate the physical parameters of the planetarysystem. according to the best-fit model, the two planet masses are ~0.11m_jupiter and 0.68 m_jupiter and they are orbiting a g-type main sequence starwith a mass ~0.82 m_sun. the projected separations of the individual planetsare beyond the snow line in all four solutions, being ~3.8 au and 4.6 au in thebest-fit solution. the deprojected separations are both individually larger andpossibly reversed in order. this is the second multi-planet system with bothplanets beyond the snow line discovered by microlensing. this is the only sucha system (other than the solar system) with measured planet masses withoutsin(i) degeneracy. the planetary system is located at a distance 4.1 kpc fromthe earth toward the galactic center. it is very likely that extra light fromstars other than the lensed star comes from the lens itself. if this iscorrect, it will be possible to obtain detailed information about theplanet-host star from follow-up observation.

0804.1354	ogle-2005-blg-071lb, the most massive m-dwarf planetary companion?	we combine all available information to constrain the nature ofogle-2005-blg-071lb, the second planet discovered by microlensing and the firstin a high-magnification event. these include photometric and astrometricmeasurements from hubble space telescope, as well as constraints from higherorder effects extracted from the ground-based light curve, such as microlensparallax, planetary orbital motion and finite-source effects. our primaryanalysis leads to the conclusion that the host of jovian planetogle-2005-blg-071lb is an m dwarf in the foreground disk with mass m= 0.46 +/-0.04 msun, distance d_l = 3.3 +/- 0.4 kpc, and thick-disk kinematics v_lsr ~103 km/s. from the best-fit model, the planet has mass m_p = 3.8 +/- 0.4 m_jup,lies at a projected separation r_perp = 3.6 +/- 0.2 au from its host and so hasan equilibrium temperature of t ~ 55 k, i.e., similar to neptune. a degeneratemodel less favored by \delta\chi^2 = 2.1 (or 2.2, depending on the sign of theimpact parameter) gives similar planetary mass m_p = 3.4 +/- 0.4 m_jup with asmaller projected separation, r_\perp = 2.1 +/- 0.1 au, and higher equilibriumtemperature t ~ 71 k. these results from the primary analysis suggest thatogle-2005-blg-071lb is likely to be the most massive planet yet discovered thatis hosted by an m dwarf. however, the formation of such high-mass planetarycompanions in the outer regions of m-dwarf planetary systems is predicted to beunlikely within the core-accretion scenario. there are a number of caveats tothis primary analysis, which assumes (based on real but limited evidence) thatthe unlensed light coincident with the source is actually due to the lens, thatis, the planetary host. however, these caveats could mostly be resolved by asingle astrometric measurement a few years after the event.

1501.05951	space telescope and optical reverberation mapping project. ii. swift and  hst reverberation mapping of the accretion disk of ngc 5548	recent intensive swift monitoring of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 yielded282 usable epochs over 125 days across six uv/optical bands and the x-rays.this is the densest extended agn uv/optical continuum sampling ever obtained,with a mean sampling rate &lt;0.5 day. approximately daily hst uv sampling wasalso obtained. the uv/optical light curves show strong correlations (r_max =0.57 - 0.90) and the clearest measurement to date of interband lags. these lagsare well-fit by a \tau propto \lambda^4/3 wavelength dependence, with anormalization that indicates an unexpectedly large disk radius of 0.35 +/- 0.05lt-day at 1367 a, assuming a simple face-on model. the u-band shows amarginally larger lag than expected from the fit and surrounding bands, whichcould be due to balmer continuum emission from the broad-line region assuggested by korista and goad. the uv/x-ray correlation is weaker (r_max &lt;0.45) and less consistent over time. this indicates that while swift isbeginning to measure uv/optical lags in general agreement with accretion disktheory (although the derived size is larger than predicted), the relationshipwith x-ray variability is less well understood. combining this accretion disksize estimate with those from quasar microlensing studies suggests that agndisk sizes scale approximately linearly with central black hole mass over awide range of masses.

astro-ph;0004243	planet observations of microlensing event ogle-1999-bul-23: limb  darkening measurement of the source star	we present planet observations of ogle-1999-bul-23, a binary-lensmicrolensing event towards the galactic bulge. planet observations in the i andv bands cover the event from just before the first caustic crossing until theend of the event. in particular, a densely-sampled second caustic crossingenables us to derive the linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source star;c_v = 0.786^{+0.080}_{-0.078} and c_i = 0.632^{+0.047}_{-0.037}. combinedanalysis of the light curve and the color-magnitude diagram suggests that thesource star is a g/k subgiant in the galactic bulge (t_eff = 4800 k). theresulting linear limb-darkening coefficient of the source is consistent withtheoretical predictions, although it is likely that non-linearity of thestellar surface brightness profile complicates the interpretation, especiallyfor the i band. the global light curve fit to the data indicates that the eventis due to a binary lens of a mass ratio q = 0.39 and a projected separation d =2.42. the lens/source relative proper motion is (22.8 +_ 1.5) km/s/kpc, typicalof bulge/bulge or bulge/disk events.

astro-ph;0005433	x-ray and optical variability in ngc 4051 and the nature of narrow-line  seyfert 1 galaxies	we report on the results of a three-year program of coordinated x-ray andoptical monitoring of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4051. the rapidcontinuum variations observed in the x-ray spectra are not detected in theoptical, although the time-averaged x-ray and optical continuum fluxes arewell-correlated. variations in the flux of the broad hbeta line are found tolag behind the optical continuum variations by 6 days (with an uncertainty of2-3 days), and combining this with the line width yields a virial mass estimateof about 1.1 million solar masses, at the very low end of the distribution ofagn masses measured by line reverberation. strong variability of he ii 4686 isalso detected, and the response time measured is similar to that of hbeta, butwith a much larger uncertainty. the he ii 4686 line is almost five timesbroader than hbeta, and it is strongly blueward asymmetric, as are thehigh-ionization uv lines recorded in archival spectra of ngc 4051. the data areconsistent with the balmer lines arising in a low to moderate inclinationdisk-like configuration, and the high-ionization lines arising in an outflowingwind, of which we observe preferentially the near side. previous observationsof the narrow-line region morphology of this source suggest that the system isinclined by about 50 degrees, and if this is applicable to the broadhbeta-emitting region, a central mass of about 1.4 million solar masses can beinferred. during the third year of monitoring, both the x-ray continuum and thehe ii 4686 line went into extremely low states, although the optical continuumand the hbeta broad line were both still present and variable. we suggest thatthe inner part of the accretion disk may have gone into an advection-dominatedstate, yielding little radiation from the hotter inner disk.

astro-ph;0404394	ogle-2003-blg-238: microlensing mass estimate of an isolated star	microlensing is the only known direct method to measure the masses of starsthat lack visible companions. in terms of microlensing observables, the mass isgiven by m=(c^2/4g)\tilde r_e \theta_e and so requires the measurement of boththe angular einstein radius, \theta_e, and the projected einstein radius,\tilde r_e. simultaneous measurement of these two parameters is extremely rare.here we analyze ogle-2003-blg-238, a spectacularly bright (i_min=10.3),high-magnification (a_max = 170) microlensing event. pronounced finite sourceeffects permit a measurement of \theta_e = 650 uas. although the timescale ofthe event is only t_e = 38 days, one can still obtain weak constraints on themicrolens parallax: 4.4 au &lt; \tilde r_e &lt; 18 au at the 1 \sigma level. togetherthese two parameter measurements yield a range for the lens mass of 0.36 m_sun&lt; m &lt; 1.48 m_sun. as was the case for macho-lmc-5, the only other single star(apart from the sun) whose mass has been determined from its gravitationaleffects, this estimate is rather crude. it does, however, demonstrate theviability of the technique. we also discuss future prospects for single-lensmass measurements.

(2004b), which combines light-curve analysis with priorsfrom a galactic model of the source and lens populations, to take account offinite-source effects. this is the first event so analyzed for whichfinite-source effects are important, and hence we develop two new techniquesfor evaluating these effects. somewhat surprisingly, we find thatogle-2004-blg-343 is no more sensitive to planets than two previously analyzedevents with a_{max}~100, despite the fact that it was observed at ~12 timeshigher magnification. however, we show that had the event been observed overits peak, it would have been sensitive to almost all neptune-mass planets overa factor of 5 of projected separation and even would have had some sensitivityto earth-mass planets. this shows that some microlensing events being detectedin current experiments are sensitive to very low-mass planets. we also givesuggestions on how extremely high-magnification events can be more promptlymonitored in the future.

astro-ph;0507578	the disappearing act of kh 15d: photometric results from 1995 to 2004	we present results from the most recent (2002-2004) observing campaigns ofthe eclipsing system kh 15d, in addition to re-reduced data obtained at vanvleck observatory (vvo) between 1995 and 2000. phasing nine years ofphotometric data shows substantial evolution in the width and depth of theeclipses. the most recent data indicate that the eclipses are now approximately24 days in length, or half the orbital period. these results are interpretedand discussed in the context of the recent models for this system put forwardby winn et al. and chiang &amp; murray-clay. a periodogram of the entire data setyields a highly significant peak at 48.37 +/- 0.01 days, which is in accordwith the spectroscopic period of 48.38 +/- 0.01 days determined by johnson etal. another significant peak, at 9.6 days, was found in the periodogram of theout-of-eclipse data at two different epochs. we interpret this as the rotationperiod of the visible star and argue that it may be tidally locked inpseudosynchronism with its orbital motion. if so, application of hut's theoryimplies that the eccentricity of the orbit is e = 0.65 +/- 0.01. analysis ofthe uves/vlt spectra obtained by hamilton et al. shows that the v sin(i) of thevisible star in this system is 6.9 +/- 0.3 km/sec. using this value of v sin(i)and the measured rotation period of the star, we calculate the lower limit onthe radius to be r = (1.3 +/- 0.1), r_sun, which concurs with the valueobtained by hamilton et al. from its luminosity and effective temperature. herewe assume that i = 90 degrees since it is likely that the spin and orbitalangular momenta vectors are nearly aligned.

astro-ph;0603276	microlens ogle-2005-blg-169 implies cool neptune-like planets are common	we detect a neptune mass-ratio (q~8e-5) planetary companion to the lens starin the extremely high-magnification (a~800) microlensing eventogle-2005-blg-169. if the parent is a main-sequence star, it has mass m~0.5m_sun implying a planet mass of ~13 m_earth and projected separation of ~2.7au. when intensely monitored over their peak, high-magnification events similarto ogle-2005-blg-169 have nearly complete sensitivity to neptune mass-ratioplanets with projected separations of 0.6 to 1.6 einstein radii, correspondingto 1.6--4.3 au in the present case. only two other such events were monitoredwell enough to detect neptunes, and so this detection by itself suggests thatneptune mass-ratio planets are common. moreover, another neptune was recentlydiscovered at a similar distance from its parent star in a low-magnificationevent, which are more common but are individually much less sensitive toplanets. combining the two detections yields 90% upper and lower frequencylimits f=0.37^{+0.30}_{-0.21} over just 0.4 decades of planet-star separation.in particular, f&gt;16% at 90% confidence. the parent star hosts no jupiter-masscompanions with projected separations within a factor 5 of that of the detectedplanet. the lens-source relative proper motion is \mu~7--10 mas/yr, implyingthat if the lens is sufficiently bright, i&lt;23.8, it will be detectable by hstby 3 years after peak. this would permit a more precise estimate of the lensmass and distance, and so the mass and projected separation of the planet.analogs of ogle-2005-blg-169lb orbiting nearby stars would be difficult todetect by other methods of planet detection, including radial velocities,transits, or astrometry.

astro-ph;0702240	first space-based microlens parallax measurement: spitzer observations  of ogle-2005-smc-001	we combine spitzer and ground-based observations to measure the microlensparallax of ogle-2005-smc-001, the first such space-based determination sinces. refsdal proposed the idea in 1966. the parallax measurement yields aprojected velocity \tilde v ~ 230 km/s, the typical value expected for halolenses, but an order of magnitude smaller than would be expected for lenseslying in the small magellanic cloud (smc) itself. the lens is a weak (i.e.,non-caustic-crossing) binary, which complicates the analysis considerably butultimately contributes additional constraints. using a test proposed by assefet al. (2006), which makes use only of kinematic information about differentpopulations but does not make any assumptions about their respective massfunctions, we find that the likelihood ratio is l_halo/l_smc = 20. hence, halolenses are strongly favored but smc lenses are not definitively ruled out.similar spitzer observations of additional lenses toward the magellanic cloudswould clarify the nature of the lens population. the space interferometrymission could make even more constraining measurements.

astro-ph;9704156	the extinction law in an occulting galaxy	we measure the extinction law in a galaxy's spiral arm and interarm regionsusing a visual and infrared (bvrjhk) imaging study of the interacting galaxiesngc 2207 and ic 2163. this is an overlapping spiral galaxy pair in which ngc2207 partially occults ic 2163. this geometry enables us to directly measurethe extinction of light from the background galaxy as it passes through thedisk of the foreground galaxy. we measure the extinction as a function ofwavelength, and find that there is less extinction in the optical bands thanexpected from a normal galactic extinction law. this deviation is significantlylarger in the interarm region than in the spiral arm. the extinction curve inthe spiral arm resembles a milky way $r_v=5.0$ dust model and the interarmextinction curve is flatter (``greyer'') still. we examine the effect ofscattering of background galaxy light into the line of sight and find that itis negligible. we also examine the effect of an unresolved patchy dustdistribution using a simple two-component dust model as well as the clumpy dustmodel of witt &amp; gordon (1996). both models clearly demonstrate that anunresolved patchy dust distribution can flatten the extinction curvesignificantly. when fit to the data, both models suggest that the observeddifference between the arm and interarm extinction curves is caused by theinterarm region of ngc 2207 having a higher degree of dust patchiness (densityratio between high-density and low-density phases) than the spiral arm region.we note that an unresolved patchy dust distribution will cause us tounderestimate the average column depth of gas in a galaxy if based solely onthe visual extinction. it is much better to use the infrared extinction forthis purpose.

0809.2997	microlensing event moa-2007-blg-400: exhuming the buried signature of a  cool, jovian-mass planet	we report the detection of the cool, jovian-mass planet moa-2007-blg-400lb.the planet was detected in a high-magnification microlensing event (with peakmagnification a_max = 628) in which the primary lens transited the source,resulting in a dramatic smoothing of the peak of the event. the angular extentof the region of perturbation due to the planet is significantly smaller thanthe angular size of the source, and as a result the planetary signature is alsosmoothed out by the finite source size. thus the deviation from a single-lensfit is broad and relatively weak (~ few percent). nevertheless, we demonstratethat the planetary nature of the deviation can be unambiguously ascertainedfrom the gross features of the residuals, and detailed analysis yields a fairlyprecise planet/star mass ratio of q = 0.0026+/-0.0004, in accord with the largesignificance (\delta\chi^2=1070) of the detection. the planet/star projectedseparation is subject to a strong close/wide degeneracy, leading to twoindistinguishable solutions that differ in separation by a factor of ~8.5.upper limits on flux from the lens constrain its mass to be m &lt; 0.75 m_sun(assuming it is a main-sequence star). a bayesian analysis that includes allavailable observational constraints indicates a primary in the galactic bulgewith a mass of ~0.2-0.5 m_sun and thus a planet mass of ~ 0.5-1.3 m_jupiter.the separation and equilibrium temperature are ~0.6-1.1au (~5.3-9.7au) and~103k (~34k) for the close (wide) solution. if the primary is a main-sequencestar, follow-up observations would enable the detection of its light and so ameasurement of its mass and distance.

astro-ph;9807086	the relative lens-source proper motion in macho 98-smc-1	we present photometric and spectroscopic data for the second microlensingevent seen toward the small magellanic cloud (smc), macho-98-smc-1. the lens isa binary. we resolve the caustic crossing and find that the source took 2 deltat = 8.5 hours to transit the caustic. we measure the source temperaturet_eff=8000 k both spectroscopically and from the color (v-i)_0~0.22. we findtwo acceptable binary-lens models. in the first, the source crosses the causticat phi=43.2 deg and the unmagnified source magnitude is i_s=22.15. the angleimplies that the lens crosses the source radius in time t_* = delta t sin phi =2.92 hours. the magnitude (together with the temperature) implies that theangular radius of the source is theta_* = 0.089 micro-arsec. hence, the propermotion is mu=theta_*/t_*=1.26 km/s/kpc.  for the second solution, the corresponding parameters are phi=30.6 deg,i_s=21.81, t_*=2.15 hours, theta_* = 0.104 micro-asrsec, mu=2.00 km/s/kpc. bothproper-motion estimates are slower than 99.5% of the proper motions expectedfor halo lenses. both are consistent with an ordinary binary lens moving at ~75-120 km/s within the smc itself. we conclude that the lens is most likely inthe smc proper.

astro-ph;9903008	a complete set of solutions for caustic-crossing binary microlensing  events	we present a method to analyze binary-lens microlensing light curves with onewell-sampled fold caustic crossing. in general, the surface of chi^2 showsextremely complicated behavior over the 9-parameter space that characterizesbinary lenses. this makes it difficult to systematically search the space andverify that a given local minimum is a global minimum. we show that for eventswith well-monitored caustics, the caustic-crossing region can be isolated fromthe rest of the light curve and easily fit to a 5-parameter function. four ofthese caustic-crossing parameters can then be used to constrain the search inthe larger 9-parameter space. this allows a systematic search for all solutionsand thus identification of all local minima. we illustrate this technique usingthe planet data for macho 98-smc-1, an excellent and publicly availablecaustic-crossing data set. we show that a very broad range of parametercombinations are compatible with the planet data set, demonstrating thatobservations of binary-lens lightcurves with sampling of only one causticcrossing do not yield unique solutions. the corollary to this is that the timeof the second caustic crossing cannot be reliably predicted on the basis ofearly data including the first caustic crossing alone. we investigate therequirements for determination of a unique solution and find that occasionalobservations of the first caustic crossing may be sufficient to derive acomplete solution.

astro-ph;9909325	limits on stellar and planetary companions in microlensing event  ogle-1998-bul-14	we present the planet photometric data set for \ob14, a high magnification($a_{\rm max}\sim 16$) event alerted by the ogle collaboration toward thegalactic bulge in 1998. the planet data set consists a total of 461 i-band and139 $v-$band points, the majority of which was taken over a three month period.the median sampling interval during this period is about 1 hour, and the$1\sigma$ scatter over the peak of the event is 1.5%. the excellent dataquality and high maximum magnification of this event make it a prime candidateto search for the short duration, low amplitude perturbations that aresignatures of a planetary companion orbiting the primary lens. the observedlight curve for \ob14 is consistent with a single lens (no companion) withinphotometric uncertainties. we calculate the detection efficiency of the lightcurve to lensing companions as a function of the mass ratio and angularseparation of the two components. we find that companions of mass ratio $\ge0.01$ are ruled out at the 95% confidence level for projected separationsbetween $0.4-2.4 \re$, where $\re$ is the einstein ring radius of the primarylens. assuming that the primary is a g-dwarf with $\re\sim3 {\rm au}$ ourdetection efficiency for this event is $\sim 60%$ for a companion with the massand separation of jupiter and $\sim5%$ for a companion with the mass andseparation of saturn. our efficiencies for planets like those around upsilonand and 14 her are &gt; 75%.

astro-ph;9910375	the narrow-line regions of liners as resolved with the hubble space  telescope	liners exist in the nuclei of a large fraction of luminous galaxies, buttheir connection with the agn phenomenon has remained elusive. we presenthubble space telescope narrowband [o iii]5007 and h-alpha+[n ii] emission-lineimages of the central regions of 14 galaxies with liner nuclei. the compact, ~1arcsec-scale, unresolved emission that dominates the line flux in ground-basedobservations is mostly resolved by hst. the bulk of this emission comes fromregions with sizes of tens to hundreds of parsecs that are resolved into knots,filaments, and diffuse gas whose morphology differs from galaxy to galaxy. mostof the galaxies do not show clear linear structures or ionization conesanalogous to those often seen in seyfert galaxies. an exception is ngc 1052,the prototypical liner, in which we find a 3 arcsec-long (~ 250 pc) biconicalstructure that is oriented on the sky along the galaxy's radio jet axis. sevenof the galaxies have been shown in previously published hst images to have abright compact ultraviolet nuclear source, while the other seven do not have acentral uv source. our images find evidence of dust in the nuclear regions ofall 14 galaxies, with clear indications of nuclear obscuration in most of the"uv-dark" cases. the data suggest that the line-emitting gas in most liners isphotoionized by a central source (which may be stellar, nonstellar, or acombination thereof) but that this source is often hidden from direct view. wefind no obvious morphological differences between liners with detected weakbroad h-alpha wings in their spectra and those with only narrow lines.likewise, there is no clear morphological distinction between objects whose uvspectra are dominated by hot stars (e.g., ngc 4569) and those that are agn-like(e.g., ngc 4579).

astro-ph;9910465	the planet microlensing follow-up network: results and prospects for the  detection of extra-solar planets	among various techniques to search for extra-solar planets, microlensing hassome unique characteristics. contrary to all other methods which favour nearbyobjects, microlensing is sensitive to planets around stars at distances ofseveral kpc. these stars act as gravitational lenses leading to a brighteningof observed luminous source stars. the lens stars that are tested for thepresence of planets are not generally seen themselves. the largest sensitivityis obtained for planets at orbital separations of 1-10 au offering the view onan extremely interesting range with regard to our own solar system and inparticular to the position of jupiter. the microlensing signal of ajupiter-mass planet lasts typically a few days. this means that a planetreveals its existence by producing a short signal at its quasi-instantaneousposition, so that planets can be detected without the need to observe asignificant fraction of the orbital period. relying on the microlensing alertsissued by several survey groups that observe ~10^7 stars in the galactic bulge,planet (probing lensing anomalies network) performs precise and frequentmeasurements on ongoing microlensing events in order to detect deviations froma light curve produced by a single point-like object. these measurements allowconstraints to be put on the abundance of planets. from 42 well-sampled eventsbetween 1995 and 1999, we infer that less than 1/3 of m-dwarfs in the galacticbulge have jupiter-mass companions at separations between 1 and 4 au from theirparent star, and that less than 45% have 3-jupiter-mass companions between 1and 7 au.
