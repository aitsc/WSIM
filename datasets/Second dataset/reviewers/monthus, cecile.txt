0901.2797	random wetting transition on the cayley tree : a disordered first-order  transition with two correlation length exponents	we consider the random wetting transition on the cayley tree, i.e. theproblem of a directed polymer on the cayley tree in the presence of randomenergies along the left-most bonds. in the pure case, there exists afirst-order transition between a localized phase and a delocalized phase, witha correlation length exponent $\nu_{pure}=1$. in the disordered case, we findthat the transition remains first-order, but that there exists two diverginglength scales in the critical region : the typical correlation length divergeswith the exponent $\nu_{typ}=1$, whereas the averaged correlation lengthdiverges with the bigger exponent $\nu_{av}=2$ and governs the finite-sizescaling properties. we describe the relations with previously studied modelsthat are governed by the same "infinite disorder fixed point". for the presentmodel, where the order parameter is the contact density $\theta_l=l_a/l$(defined as the ratio of the number $l_a$ of contacts over the total length$l$), the notion of "infinite disorder fixed point" means that the thermalfluctuations of $\theta_l$ within a given sample, become negligeable at largescale with respect to sample-to-sample fluctuations. we characterize thestatistics over the samples of the free-energy and of the contact density. inparticular, exactly at criticality, we obtain that the contact density is notself-averaging but remains distributed over the samples in the thermodynamiclimit, with the distribution ${\cal p}_{t_c}(\theta) = 1/(\pi \sqrt{\theta(1-\theta)})$.

0903.1988	statistics of the two-point transmission at anderson localization  transitions	at anderson critical points, the statistics of the two-point transmission$t_l$ for disordered samples of linear size $l$ is expected to be multifractalwith the following properties [janssen {\it et al} prb 59, 15836 (1999)] : (i)the probability to have $t_l \sim 1/l^{\kappa}$ behaves as $l^{\phi(\kappa)}$,where the multifractal spectrum $\phi(\kappa)$ terminates at $\kappa=0$ as aconsequence of the physical bound $t_l \leq 1$; (ii) the exponents $x(q)$ thatgovern the moments $\overline{t_l^q} \sim 1/l^{x(q)}$ become frozen above somethreshold: $x(q \geq q_{sat}) = - \phi(\kappa=0)$, i.e. all moments of order $q\geq q_{sat}$ are governed by the measure of the rare samples having a finitetransmission ($\kappa=0$). in the present paper, we test numerically thesepredictions for the ensemble of $l \times l$ power-law random banded matrices,where the random hopping $h_{i,j}$ decays as a power-law $(b/| i-j |)^a$. thismodel is known to present an anderson transition at $a=1$ between localized($a&gt;1$) and extended ($a&lt;1$) states, with critical properties that dependcontinuously on the parameter $b$. our numerical results for the multifractalspectra $\phi_b(\kappa)$ for various $b$ are in agreement with the relation$\phi(\kappa \geq 0) = 2 [ f(\alpha= d+ \frac{\kappa}{2}) -d ]$ in terms of thesingularity spectrum $f(\alpha)$ of individual critical eigenfunctions, inparticular the typical exponents are related via the relation $\kappa_{typ}(b)=2 (\alpha_{typ}(b)-d)$. we also discuss the statistics of the two-pointtransmission in the delocalized phase and in the localized phase.

0904.4547	anderson transitions : multifractal or non-multifractal statistics of  the transmission as a function of the scattering geometry	the scaling theory of anderson localization is based on a global conductance$g_l$ that remains a random variable of order o(1) at criticality. onerealization of such a conductance is the landauer transmission for manytransverse channels. on the other hand, the statistics of the one-channellandauer transmission between two local probes is described by a multifractalspectrum that can be related to the singularity spectrum of individualeigenstates. to better understand the relations between these two types ofresults, we consider various scattering geometries that interpolate betweenthese two cases and analyse the statistics of the corresponding transmissions.we present detailed numerical results for the power-law random banded matrices(prbm model). our conclusions are : (i) in the presence of one isolatedincoming wire and many outgoing wires, the transmission has the samemultifractal statistics as the local density of states of the site where theincoming wire arrives; (ii) in the presence of backward scattering channelswith respect to the case (i), the statistics of the transmission is notmultifractal anymore, but becomes monofractal. finally, we also describe howthese scattering geometries influence the statistics of the transmission offcriticality.

0905.4127	statistics of renormalized on-site energies and renormalized hoppings  for anderson localization models in dimensions d=2 and d=3	for anderson localization models, there exists an exact real-spacerenormalization procedure at fixed energy which preserves the green functionsof the remaining sites [h. aoki, j. phys. c13, 3369 (1980)]. using thisprocedure for the anderson tight-binding model in dimensions $d=2,3$, we studynumerically the statistical properties of the renormalized on-site energies$\epsilon$ and of the renormalized hoppings $v$ as a function of the linearsize $l$. we find that the renormalized on-site energies $\epsilon$ remainfinite in the localized phase in $d=2,3$ and at criticality ($d=3$), with afinite density at $\epsilon=0$ and a power-law decay $1/\epsilon^2$ at large $|\epsilon |$. for the renormalized hoppings in the localized phase, we find:${\rm ln} v_l \simeq -\frac{l}{\xi_{loc}}+l^{\omega}u$, where $\xi_{loc}$ isthe localization length and $u$ a random variable of order one. the exponent$\omega$ is the droplet exponent characterizing the strong disorder phase ofthe directed polymer in a random medium of dimension $1+(d-1)$, with$\omega(d=2)=1/3$ and $\omega(d=3) \simeq 0.24$. at criticality $(d=3)$, thestatistics of renormalized hoppings $v$ is multifractal, in directcorrespondence with the multifractality of individual eigenstates and oftwo-point transmissions. in particular, we measure $\rho_{typ}\simeq 1$ for theexponent governing the typical decay $\overline{{\rm ln} v_l} \simeq-\rho_{typ} {\rm ln}l$, in agreement with previous numerical measures of$\alpha_{typ} =d+\rho_{typ} \simeq 4$ for the singularity spectrum $f(\alpha)$of individual eigenfunctions. we also present numerical results concerningcritical surface properties.

0909.0584	symmetry relation for multifractal spectra at random critical points	random critical points are generically characterized by multifractalproperties. in the field of anderson localization, mirlin, fyodorov,mildenberger and evers [phys. rev. lett 97, 046803 (2006)] have proposed thatthe singularity spectrum $f(\alpha)$ of eigenfunctions satisfies the exactsymmetry $f(2d-\alpha)=f(\alpha)+d-\alpha$ at any anderson transition. in thepresent paper, we analyse the physical origin of this symmetry in relation withthe gallavotti-cohen fluctuation relations of large deviation functions thatare well-known in the field of non-equilibrium dynamics: the multifractalspectrum of the disordered model corresponds to the large deviation function ofthe rescaling exponent $\gamma=(\alpha-d)$ along a renormalization trajectoryin the effective time $t=\ln l$. we conclude that the symmetry discovered onthe specific example of anderson transitions should actually be satisfied atmany other random critical points after an appropriate translation. formany-body random phase transitions, where the critical properties are usuallyanalyzed in terms of the multifractal spectrum $h(a)$ and of the momentsexponents x(n) of two-point correlation function [a. ludwig, nucl. phys. b330,639 (1990)], the symmetry becomes $h(2x(1) -a)= h(a) + a-x(1)$, or equivalently$\delta(n)=\delta(1-n)$ for the anomalous parts $\delta(n) \equiv x(n)-nx(1)$.we present numerical tests in favor of this symmetry for the 2d random$q-$state potts model with various $q$.

0910.4833	eigenvalue method to compute the largest relaxation time of disordered  systems	we consider the dynamics of finite-size disordered systems as defined by amaster equation satisfying detailed balance. the master equation can be mappedonto a schr\"odinger equation in configuration space, where the quantumhamiltonian $h$ has the generic form of an anderson localization tight-bindingmodel. the largest relaxation time $t_{eq}$ governing the convergence towardsboltzmann equilibrium is determined by the lowest non-vanishing eigenvalue$e_1=1/t_{eq}$ of $h$ (the lowest eigenvalue being $e_0=0$). so the relaxationtime $t_{eq}$ can be computed {\it without simulating the dynamics} by anyeigenvalue method able to compute the first excited energy $e_1$. here we usethe 'conjugate gradient' method to determine $e_1$ in each disordered sampleand present numerical results on the statistics of the relaxation time $t_{eq}$over the disordered samples of a given size for two models : (i) for the randomwalk in a self-affine potential of hurst exponent $h$ on a two-dimensionalsquare of size $l \times l$, we find the activated scaling $\ln t_{eq}(l) \siml^{\psi}$ with $\psi=h$ as expected; (ii) for the dynamics of thesherrington-kirkpatrick spin-glass model of $n$ spins, we find the growth $\lnt_{eq}(n) \sim n^{\psi}$ with $\psi=1/3$ in agreement with most previousmonte-carlo measures. in addition, we find that the rescaled distribution of$(\ln t_{eq})$ decays as $e^{- u^{\eta}}$ for large $u$ with a tail exponent oforder $\eta \simeq 1.36$. we give a rare-event interpretation of this value,that points towards a sample-to-sample fluctuation exponent of order$\psi_{width} \simeq 0.26$ for the barrier.

(ii) for thedynamics of the ferromagnetic sherrington-kirkpatrick model of $n$ spins, weconsider the first passage time $t_f$ to zero-magnetization when starting froma fully magnetized configuration. besides the expected linear growth of theaveraged barrier $\bar{\ln t_{f}} \sim n$, we find that the rescaleddistribution of the barrier $(\ln t_{f})$ decays as $e^{- u^{\eta}}$ for large$u$ with a tail exponent of order $\eta \simeq 1.72$. this value can be simplyinterpreted in terms of rare events if the sample-to-sample fluctuationexponent for the barrier is $\psi_{width}=1/3$.

0912.2875	matching between typical fluctuations and large deviations in disordered  systems : application to the statistics of the ground state energy in the sk  spin-glass model	for the statistics of global observables in disordered systems, we discussthe matching between typical fluctuations and large deviations. we focus on thestatistics of the ground state energy $e_0$ in two types of disordered models :(i) for the directed polymer of length $n$ in a two-dimensional medium, wheremany exact results exist (ii) for the sherrington-kirkpatrick spin-glass modelof $n$ spins, where various possibilities have been proposed. here we stressthat, besides the behavior of the disorder-average $e_0^{av}(n)$ and of thestandard deviation $ \delta e_0(n) \sim n^{\omega_f}$ that defines thefluctuation exponent $\omega_f$, it is very instructive to study the fullprobability distribution $\pi(u)$ of the rescaled variable $u=\frac{e_0(n)-e_0^{av}(n)}{\delta e_0(n)}$ : (a) numerically, the convergencetowards $\pi(u)$ is usually very rapid, so that data on rather small sizes butwith high statistics allow to measure the two tails exponents $\eta_{\pm}$defined as $\ln \pi(u \to \pm \infty) \sim - | u |^{\eta_{\pm}}$. in thegeneric case $1&lt; \eta_{\pm} &lt; +\infty$, this leads to explicit non-trivialterms in the asymptotic behaviors of the moments $\bar{z_n^n}$ of the partitionfunction when the combination $[| n | n^{\omega_f}]$ becomes large (b) simplerare events arguments can usually be found to obtain explicit relations between$\eta_{\pm}$ and $\omega_f$. these rare events usually correspond to'anomalous' large deviation properties of the generalized form $r(w_{\pm} =\frac{e_0(n)-e_0^{av}(n)}{n^{\kappa_{\pm}}}) \sim e^{- n^{\rho_{\pm}} {\calr}_{\pm}(w_{\pm})}$ (the 'usual' large deviations formalism corresponds to$\kappa_{\pm}=1=\rho_{\pm}$).

1004.1537	random cascade models of multifractality : real-space renormalization  and travelling-waves	random multifractals occur in particular at critical points of disorderedsystems. for anderson localization transitions, mirlin and evers [prb 62,7920(2000)] have proposed the following scenario (a) the inverse participationratios (i.p.r.) $y_q(l)$ display the following fluctuations between thedisordered samples of linear size $l$ : with respect to the typical value$y^{typ}_q(l) = e^{\bar{\ln y_q(l)}} \sim l^{- \tau_{typ}(q)} $ that involvethe typical multifractal spectrum $\tau_{typ}(q)$, the rescaled variable$y=y_q(l)/y^{typ}_q(l) $ is distributed with a scale-invariant distributionpresenting the power-law tail $1/y^{1+\beta_q}$, so that the disorder-averagedi.p.r. $\bar{y_q(l)} \sim l^{- \tau_{av}(q)} $ have multifractal exponents$\tau_{av}(q) $ that differ from the typical ones $\tau_{typ}(q)$ whenever$\beta_q&lt;1$; (b) the tail exponents $\beta_q$ and the multifractal exponentsare related by the relation $\beta_q \tau_{typ}(q)=\tau_{av}(q \beta_q)$. herewe show that this scenario can be understood by considering the real-spacerenormalization equations satisfied by the i.p.r. for the simplestmultifractals described by random cascades, these renormalization equations areformally similar to the recursion relations for disordered models defined oncayley trees and they admit travelling-wave solutions for the variable $(\lny_q)$ in the effective time $t_{eff}=\ln l$ : the exponent $\tau_{typ}(q)$represents the velocity, whereas the tail exponent $\beta_q$ represents theusual exponential decay of the travelling-wave tail. in addition, we obtainthat the relation (b) above can be obtained as a self-consistency conditionfrom the self-similarity of the multifractal spectrum at all scales. ourconclusion is thus that the mirlin-evers scenario should apply to other typesof random critical points, and even to random multifractals occurring in otherfields.

1111.3468	random transverse field ising model in dimension $d=2,3$ : infinite  disorder scaling via a non-linear transfer approach	the 'cavity-mean-field' approximation developed for the random transversefield ising model on the cayley tree [l. ioffe and m. m\'ezard, prl 105, 037001(2010)] has been found to reproduce the known exact result for the surfacemagnetization in $d=1$ [o. dimitrova and m. m\'ezard, j. stat. mech. (2011)p01020]. in the present paper, we propose to extend these ideas in finitedimensions $d&gt;1$ via a non-linear transfer approach for the surfacemagnetization. in the disordered phase, the linearization of the transferequations correspond to the transfer matrix for a directed polymer in a randommedium of transverse dimension $d=d-1$, in agreement with the leading orderperturbative scaling analysis [c. monthus and t. garel, arxiv:1110.3145]. wepresent numerical results of the non-linear transfer approach in dimensions$d=2$ and $d=3$. in both cases, we find that the critical point is governed byinfinite disorder scaling. in particular exactly at criticality, the one-pointsurface magnetization scales as $\ln m_l^{surf} \simeq - l^{\omega_c} v$, where$\omega_c(d)$ coincides with the droplet exponent $\omega_{dp}(d=d-1)$ of thecorresponding directed polymer model, with $\omega_c(d=2)=1/3$ and$\omega_c(d=3) \simeq 0.24$. the distribution $p(v)$ of the positive randomvariable $v$ of order o(1) presents a power-law singularity near the origin$p(v) \propto v^a$ with $a(d=2,3)&gt;0$ so that all moments of the surfacemagnetization are governed by the same power-law decay $\bar{(m_l^{surf})^k}\propto l^{- x_s}$ with $x_s=\omega_c (1+a)$ independently of the order $k$.

0711.2878	critical behavior of interfaces in disordered potts ferromagnets :  statistics of free-energy, energy and interfacial adsorption	a convenient way to study phase transitions of finite spins systems of linearsize $l$ is to fix boundary conditions that impose the presence of asystem-size interface. in this paper, we study the statistical properties ofsuch an interface in a disordered potts ferromagnet in dimension $d=2$ withinmigdal-kadanoff real space renormalization. we first focus on the interfacefree-energy and energy to measure the singularities of the average and randomcontributions, as well as the corresponding histograms, both in thelow-temperature phase and at criticality. we then consider the criticalbehavior of the interfacial adsorption of non-boundary states. our mainconclusion is that all singularities involve the correlation length$\xi_{av}(t) \sim (t_c-t)^{-\nu}$ appearing in the average free-energy $\bar{f}\sim (l/\xi_{av}(t))^{d_s}$ of the interface of dimension $d_s=d-1$, except forthe free-energy width $\delta f \sim (l/\xi_{var}(t))^{\theta}$ that involvesthe droplet exponent $\theta$ and another correlation length $\xi_{var}(t)$which diverges more rapidly than $\xi_{av}(t)$. we compare with the spin-glasstransition in $d=3$, where $\xi_{var}(t)$ is the 'true' correlation length, andwhere the interface energy presents unconventional scaling with a chaoscritical exponent $\zeta_c&gt;1/\nu$ [nifle and hilhorst, phys. rev. lett. 68,2992 (1992)]. the common feature is that in both cases, the characteristiclength scale $l_{ch}(t)$ associated with the chaotic nature of thelow-temperature phase, diverges more slowly than the correlation length.

0803.4125	driven interfaces in random media at finite temperature : is there an  anomalous zero-velocity phase at small external force ?	the motion of driven interfaces in random media at finite temperature $t$ andsmall external force $f$ is usually described by a linear displacement $h_g(t)\sim v(f,t) t$ at large times, where the velocity vanishes according to thecreep formula as $v(f,t) \sim e^{-k(t)/f^{\mu}}$ for $f \to 0$. in this paper,we question this picture on the specific example of the directed polymer in atwo dimensional random medium. we have recently shown (c. monthus and t. garel,arxiv:0802.2502) that its dynamics for f=0 can be analyzed in terms of a strongdisorder renormalization procedure, where the distribution of renormalizedbarriers flows towards some "infinite disorder fixed point". in the presentpaper, we obtain that for small $f$, this "infinite disorder fixed point"becomes a "strong disorder fixed point" with an exponential distribution ofrenormalized barriers. the corresponding distribution of trapping times thenonly decays as a power-law $p(\tau) \sim 1/\tau^{1+\alpha}$, where the exponent$\alpha(f,t)$ vanishes as $\alpha(f,t) \propto f^{\mu}$ as $f \to 0$. ourconclusion is that in the small force region $\alpha(f,t)&lt;1$, the divergence ofthe averaged trapping time $\bar{\tau}=+\infty$ induces strongnon-self-averaging effects that invalidate the usual creep formula obtained byreplacing all trapping times by the typical value. we find instead that themotion is only sub-linearly in time $h_g(t) \sim t^{\alpha(f,t)}$, i.e. theasymptotic velocity vanishes v=0. this analysis is confirmed by numericalsimulations of a directed polymer with a metric constraint driven in a trapslandscape. we moreover obtain that the roughness exponent, which is governed bythe equilibrium value $\zeta_{eq}=2/3$ up to some large scale, becomes equal to$\zeta=1$ at the largest scales.

0806.3335	equilibrium of disordered systems : constructing the appropriate valleys  in each sample via strong disorder renormalization in configuration space	to describe the equilibrium properties of disordered systems and the possibleemergence of various 'phases' at low temperature, we adopt here the 'brokenergodicity' point of view advocated in particular by palmer [adv. phys. 31, 669(1982)] : the aim is then to construct the valleys of configurations thatbecome separated by diverging barriers and to study their relative weights, aswell as their internal properties. to characterize the slow non-equilibriumdynamics of disordered systems, we have recently introduced in [c. monthus andt. garel, j. phys. a 41, 255002 (2008) and arxiv:0804.1847] a strong disorderrenormalization procedure in configuration space, based on the iterativeelimination of the smallest barrier remaining in the system. in the presentpaper, we show how this renormalization procedure allows to construct thelongest-lived valleys in each disordered sample, and to obtain theirfree-energies, energies and entropies. this explicit rg formulation is verygeneral since it can be defined for any master equation, and it gives newinsights into the main ingredients of the droplet scaling picture. as anapplication, we have followed numerically the rg flow for the case of adirected polymer in a two-dimensional random medium to obtain histograms of thefree-energy, entropy and energy differences between the two longest-livedvalleys in each sample.

cond-mat;0202295	localization of thermal packets and metastable states in sinai model	we consider the sinai model describing a particle diffusing in a 1d randomforce field. as shown by golosov, this model exhibits a strong localizationphenomenon for the thermal packet: the disorder average of the thermaldistribution of the relative distance y=x-m(t), with respect to the(disorder-dependent) most probable position m(t), converges in the limit ofinfinite time towards a distribution p(y). in this paper, we revisit thisquestion of the localization of the thermal packet. we first generalize theresult of golosov by computing explicitly the joint asymptotic distribution ofrelative position y=x(t)-m(t) and relative energy u=u(x(t))-u(m(t)) for thethermal packet. next, we compute in the infinite-time limit the localizationparameters y_k, representing the disorder-averaged probabilities that kparticles of the thermal packet are at the same place, and the correlationfunction c(l) representing the disorder-averaged probability that two particlesof the thermal packet are at a distance l from each other. we moreover provethat our results for y_k and c(l) exactly coincide with the thermodynamic limitof the analog quantities computed for independent particles at equilibrium in afinite sample of length l. finally, we discuss the properties of thefinite-time metastable states that are responsible for the localizationphenomenon and compare with the general theory of metastable states in glassysystems, in particular as a test of the edwards conjecture.

cond-mat;0303270	anomalous diffusion, localization, aging and sub-aging effects in trap  models at very low temperature	we study in details the dynamics of the one dimensional symmetric trap model,via a real-space renormalization procedure which becomes exact in the limit ofzero temperature. in this limit, the diffusion front in each sample consists intwo delta peaks, which are completely out of equilibrium with each other. thestatistics of the positions and weights of these delta peaks over the samplesallows to obtain explicit results for all observables in the limit $t \to 0$.we first compute disorder averages of one-time observables, such as thediffusion front, the thermal width, the localization parameters, thetwo-particle correlation function, and the generating function of thermalcumulants of the position. we then study aging and sub-aging effects : ourapproach reproduces very simply the two different aging exponents and yieldsexplicit forms for scaling functions of the various two-time correlations. wealso extend the rsrg method to include systematic corrections to the previouszero temperature procedure via a series expansion in $t$. we then consider thegeneralized trap model with parameter $\alpha \in [0,1]$ and obtain that thelarge scale effective model at low temperature does not depend on $\alpha$ inany dimension, so that the only observables sensitive to $\alpha$ are thosethat measure the `local persistence', such as the probability to remain exactlyin the same trap during a time interval. finally, we extend our approach at ascaling level for the trap model in $d=2$ and obtain the two relevant timescales for aging properties.

cond-mat;0312282	directed polymers and interfaces in random media : free-energy  optimization via confinement in a wandering tube	we analyze, via imry-ma scaling arguments, the strong disorder phases thatexist in low dimensions at all temperatures for directed polymers andinterfaces in random media. for the uncorrelated gaussian disorder, we obtainthat the optimal strategy for the polymer in dimension $1+d$ with $0&lt;d&lt;2$involves at the same time (i) a confinement in a favorable tube of radius $r_s\sim l^{\nu_s}$ with $\nu_s=1/(4-d)&lt;1/2$ (ii) a superdiffusive behavior $r \siml^{\nu}$ with $\nu=(3-d)/(4-d)&gt;1/2$ for the wandering of the best favorabletube available. the corresponding free-energy then scales as $f \siml^{\omega}$ with $\omega=2 \nu-1$ and the left tail of the probabilitydistribution involves a stretched exponential of exponent $\eta= (4-d)/2$.these results generalize the well known exact exponents $\nu=2/3$, $\omega=1/3$and $\eta=3/2$ in $d=1$, where the subleading transverse length $r_s \siml^{1/3}$ is known as the typical distance between two replicas in the betheansatz wave function. we then extend our approach to correlated disorder intransverse directions with exponent $\alpha$ and/or to manifolds in dimension$d+d=d_{t}$ with $0&lt;d&lt;2$. the strategy of being both confined andsuperdiffusive is still optimal for decaying correlations ($\alpha&lt;0$), whereasit is not for growing correlations ($\alpha&gt;0$). in particular, for aninterface of dimension $(d_t-1)$ in a space of total dimension $5/3&lt;d_t&lt;3$ withrandom-bond disorder, our approach yields the confinement exponent $\nu_s =(d_t-1)(3-d_t)/(5d_t-7)$. finally, we study the exponents in the presence of analgebraic tail $1/v^{1+\mu}$ in the disorder distribution, and obtain variousregimes in the $(\mu,d)$ plane.

cond-mat;0407289	low-temperature properties of some disordered systems from the  statistical properties of nearly degenerate two-level excitations	the thermal fluctuations that exist at very low temperature in disorderedsystems are often attributed to the existence of some two-level excitations. inthis paper, we revisit this question via the explicit studies of the following1d models (i) a particle in 1d random potentials (ii) the random field isingchain with continuous disorder distribution. in both cases, we define preciselythe `two-level' excitations and their statistical properties, and we show thattheir contributions to various observables are in full agreement at lowtemperature with the the rigorous results obtained independently. thestatistical properties of these two-level excitations moreover yield simpleidentities at order $t$ in temperature for some generating functions of thermalcumulants. for the random-field ising chain, in the regime where the imry-malength is large, we obtain that the specific heat is dominated by smallnon-universal excitations, that depend on the details of the disorderdistribution, whereas the magnetic susceptibility and the edwards-andersonorder parameter are dominated by universal large excitations, whose statisticalproperties only depend on the variance of the initial disorder via the imry-malength.

cond-mat;0509479	distribution of pseudo-critical temperatures and lack of self-averaging  in disordered poland-scheraga models with different loop exponents	according to recent progresses in the finite size scaling theory ofdisordered systems, thermodynamic observables are not self-averaging atcritical points when the disorder is relevant in the harris criterion sense.this lack of self-averageness at criticality is directly related to thedistribution of pseudo-critical temperatures $t_c(i,l)$ over the ensemble ofsamples $(i)$ of size $l$. in this paper, we apply this analysis to disorderedpoland-scheraga models with different loop exponents $c$,corresponding tomarginal and relevant disorder. in all cases, we numerically obtain a gaussianhistogram of pseudo-critical temperatures $t_c(i,l)$ with mean $t_c^{av}(l)$and width $\delta t_c(l)$. for the marginal case $c=1.5$ corresponding totwo-dimensional wetting, both the width $\delta t_c(l)$ and the shift$[t_c(\infty)-t_c^{av}(l)]$ decay as $l^{-1/2}$, so the exponent is unchanged($\nu_{random}=2=\nu_{pure}$) but disorder is relevant and leads to nonself-averaging at criticality. for relevant disorder $c=1.75$, the width$\delta t_c(l)$ and the shift $[t_c(\infty)-t_c^{av}(l)]$ decay with the samenew exponent $l^{-1/\nu_{random}}$ (where $\nu_{random} \sim 2.7 &gt; 2 &gt;\nu_{pure}$) and there is again no self-averaging at criticality. finally forthe value $c=2.15$, of interest in the context of dna denaturation, thetransition is first-order in the pure case. in the presence of disorder, thewidth $\delta t_c(l) \sim l^{-1/2}$ dominates over the shift$[t_c(\infty)-t_c^{av}(l)] \sim l^{-1}$, i.e. there are two correlation lengthexponents $\nu=2$ and $\tilde \nu=1$ that govern respectively theaveraged/typical loop distribution.

cond-mat;0603041	freezing transition of the directed polymer in a $1+d$ random medium :  location of the critical temperature and unusual critical properties	in dimension $d \geq 3$, the directed polymer in a random medium undergoes aphase transition between a free phase and a disorder dominated phase. for thelatter, fisher and huse have proposed a droplet theory based on the scaling ofthe free energy fluctuations $\delta f(l) \sim l^{\theta}$. on the other hand,in related growth models belonging to the kpz universality class, forrest andtang have found that the height-height correlation function is logarithmic atthe transition. for the directed polymer model at criticality, this translatesinto logarithmic free energy fluctuations $\delta f_{t_c}(l) \sim (\lnl)^{\sigma}$ with $\sigma=1/2$. in this paper, we propose a droplet scalinganalysis exactly at criticality based on this logarithmic scaling. our mainconclusion is that the typical correlation length $\xi(t)$ of the lowtemperature phase, diverges as $ \ln \xi(t) \sim (- \ln (t_c-t))^{1/\sigma}\sim (- \ln (t_c-t))^{2} $. furthermore, the logarithmic dependence of $\deltaf_{t_c}(l)$ leads to the conclusion that the critical temperature $t_c$actually coincides with the explicit upper bound $t_2$ derived by derrida andcoworkers, where $t_2$ corresponds to the temperature below which the ratio$\bar{z_l^2}/(\bar{z_l})^2$ diverges exponentially in $l$. finally, since thefisher-huse droplet theory was initially introduced for the spin-glass phase,we briefly mention the similarities and differences with the directed polymermodel. if one speculates that the free energy of droplet excitations forspin-glasses is also logarithmic at $t_c$, one obtains a logarithmic decay forthe mean square correlation function at criticality $\bar{c^2(r)} \sim 1/(\ln r)^{\sigma}$.

cond-mat;0611611	freezing transition of the random bond rna model: statistical properties  of the pairing weights	to characterize the pairing-specificity of rna secondary structures as afunction of temperature, we analyse the statistics of the pairing weights asfollows : for each base $(i)$ of the sequence of length n, we consider the$(n-1)$ pairing weights $w_i(j)$ with the other bases $(j \neq i)$ of thesequence. we numerically compute the probability distributions $p_1(w)$ of themaximal weight, the probability distribution $\pi(y_2)$ of the parameter$y_2(i)= \sum_j w_i^2(j)$, as well as the average values of the moments$y_k(i)= \sum_j w_i^k(j)$. we find that there are two important temperatures$t_c&lt;t_{gap}$. for $t&gt;t_{gap}$, the distribution $p_1(w)$ vanishes at somevalue $w_0(t)&lt;1$, and accordingly the moments $\bar{y_k(i)}$ decayexponentially in $k$. for $t&lt;t_{gap}$, the distributions $p_1(w)$ and$\pi(y_2)$ present the characteristic derrida-flyvbjerg singularities at$w,y_2=1/n$ for $n=1,2..$. in particular, there exists a temperature-dependentexponent $\mu(t)$ that governs these singularities and the decay of the moments$ \bar{y_k(i)} \sim 1/k^{\mu(t)}$. the exponent $\mu(t)$ grows from$\mu(t=0)=0$ up to $\mu(t_{gap}) \sim 2$. the study of spatial propertiesindicates that the critical temperature $t_c$ where the roughness exponentchanges from the low temperature value $\zeta \sim 0.67$ to the hightemperature value $\zeta \sim 0.5$ corresponds to the exponent $\mu(t_c)=1$.for $t&lt;t_c$, there exists frozen pairs of all sizes, whereas for $t_c&lt; t&lt;t_{gap}$, there exists frozen pairs, but only up to some characteristic lengthdiverging as $\xi(t) \sim 1/(t_c-t)^{\nu}$ with $\nu \simeq 2$. thesimilarities and differences with the weight statistics in l\'evy sums and inderrida's random energy model are discussed.

cond-mat;0701699	directed polymer in a random medium of dimension 1+3 : multifractal  properties at the localization/delocalization transition	we consider the model of the directed polymer in a random medium of dimension1+3, and investigate its multifractal properties at thelocalization/delocalization transition. in close analogy with models of thequantum anderson localization transition, where the multifractality of criticalwavefunctions is well established, we analyse the statistics of the positionweights $w_l(\vec r)$ of the end-point of the polymer of length $l$ via themoments $y_q(l) = \sum_{\vec r} [w_l(\vec r)]^q$. we measure the generalizedexponents $\tau(q)$ and $\tilde \tau(q)$ governing the decay of the typicalvalues $y^{typ}_q(l) = e^{\bar{\ln y_q(l)}} \sim l^{- \tau(q)} $ anddisorder-averaged values $\bar{y_q(l)} \sim l^{- \tilde \tau(q)} $respectively. to understand the difference between these exponents, $ \tau(q)\neq \tilde \tau(q)$ above some threshold $q&gt;q_c \sim 2$, we compute theprobability distributions of $y=y_q(l)/y^{typ}_q(l) $ over the samples : wefind that these distributions becomes scale invariant with a power-law tail$1/y^{1+x_q}$. these results thus correspond to the ever-mirlin scenario [phys.rev. lett. 84, 3690 (2000)] for the statistics of inverse participation ratiosat the anderson localization transitions. finally, the finite-size scalinganalysis in the critical region yields the correlation length exponent $\nu\sim 2$.

cond-mat;0702131	directed polymer in a random medium of dimension 1+1 and 1+3: weights  statistics in the low-temperature phase	we consider the low-temperature $t&lt;t_c$ disorder-dominated phase of thedirected polymer in a random potentiel in dimension 1+1 (where $t_c=\infty$)and 1+3 (where $t_c&lt;\infty$). to characterize the localization properties ofthe polymer of length $l$, we analyse the statistics of the weights $w_l(\vecr)$ of the last monomer as follows. we numerically compute the probabilitydistributions $p_1(w)$ of the maximal weight $w_l^{max}= max_{\vec r} [w_l(\vecr)]$, the probability distribution $\pi(y_2)$ of the parameter $y_2(l)=\sum_{\vec r} w_l^2(\vec r) $ as well as the average values of the higher ordermoments $y_k(l)= \sum_{\vec r} w_l^k(\vec r)$. we find that there exists atemperature $t_{gap}&lt;t_c$ such that (i) for $t&lt;t_{gap}$, the distributions$p_1(w)$ and $\pi(y_2)$ present the characteristic derrida-flyvbjergsingularities at $w=1/n$ and $y_2=1/n$ for $n=1,2..$. in particular, thereexists a temperature-dependent exponent $\mu(t)$ that governs the mainsingularities $p_1(w) \sim (1-w)^{\mu(t)-1}$ and $\pi(y_2) \sim(1-y_2)^{\mu(t)-1}$ as well as the power-law decay of the moments $\bar{y_k(i)} \sim 1/k^{\mu(t)}$. the exponent $\mu(t)$ grows from the value$\mu(t=0)=0$ up to $\mu(t_{gap}) \sim 2$. (ii) for $t_{gap}&lt;t&lt;t_c$, thedistribution $p_1(w)$ vanishes at some value $w_0(t)&lt;1$, and accordingly themoments $\bar{y_k(i)}$ decay exponentially as $(w_0(t))^k$ in $k$. thehistograms of spatial correlations also display derrida-flyvbjerg singularitiesfor $t&lt;t_{gap}$. both below and above $t_{gap}$, the study of typical andaveraged correlations is in full agreement with the droplet scaling theory.

cond-mat;0703017	on the critical weight statistics of the random energy model and of the  directed polymer on the cayley tree	we consider the critical point of two mean-field disordered models : (i) therandom energy model (rem), introduced by derrida as a mean-field spin-glassmodel of $n$ spins (ii) the directed polymer of length $n$ on a cayley tree(dpct) with random bond energies. both models are known to exhibit a freezingtransition between a high temperature phase where the entropy is extensive anda low-temperature phase of finite entropy. in this paper, we study the weightstatistics at criticality via the entropy $s=-\sum w_i \ln w_i$ and thegeneralized moments $y_k=\sum w_i^k$, where the $w_i$ are the boltzmann weightsof the $2^n$ configurations. in the rem, we find that the critical weightstatistics is governed by the finite-size exponent $\nu=2$ : the entropy scalesas $\bar{s}_n(t_c) \sim n^{1/2}$, the typical values $e^{\bar{\ln y_k}}$ decayas $n^{-k/2}$, and the disorder-averaged values $\bar{y_k}$ are governed byrare events and decay as $n^{-1/2}$ for any $k&gt;1$. for the dpct, we find thatthe entropy scales similarly as $\bar{s}_n(t_c) \sim n^{1/2}$, whereas anotherexponent $\nu'=1$ governs the $y_k$ statistics : the typical values$e^{\bar{\ln y_k}}$ decay as $n^{-k}$, the disorder-averaged values $\bar{y_k}$decay as $n^{-1}$ for any $k&gt;1$. as a consequence, the asymptotic probabilitydistribution $\bar{\pi}_{n=\infty}(q)$ of the overlap $q$, beside the deltafunction $\delta(q)$ which bears the whole normalization, contains an isolatedpoint at $q=1$, as a memory of the delta peak $(1-t/t_c) \delta(q-1)$ of thelow-temperature phase $t&lt;t_c$. the associated value $\bar{\pi}_{n=\infty}(q=1)$is finite for the dpct, and diverges as $\bar{\pi}_{n=\infty}(q=1) \simn^{1/2}$ for the rem.

cond-mat;9901306	reaction diffusion models in one dimension with disorder	we study a large class of 1d reaction diffusion models with quenched disorderusing a real space renormalization group method (rsrg) which yields exactresults at large time. particles (e.g. of several species) undergo diffusionwith random local bias (sinai model) and react upon meeting. we obtain thelarge time decay of the density of each specie, their associated universalamplitudes, and the spatial distribution of particles. we also derive thespectrum of exponents which characterize the convergence towards the asymptoticstates. for reactions with several asymptotic states, we analyze the dynamicalphase diagram and obtain the critical exponents at the transitions. we alsostudy persistence properties for single particles and for patterns. we computethe decay exponents for the probability of no crossing of a given point by,respectively, the single particle trajectories ($\theta$) or the thermallyaveraged packets ($\bar{\theta}$). the generalized persistence exponentsassociated to n crossings are also obtained. specifying to the process $a+a \to\emptyset$ or a with probabilities $(r,1-r)$, we compute exactly the exponents$\delta(r)$ and $\psi(r)$ characterizing the survival up to time t of a domainwithout any merging or with mergings respectively, and $\delta_a(r)$ and$\psi_a(r)$ characterizing the survival up to time t of a particle a withoutany coalescence or with coalescences respectively. $\bar{\theta}, \psi, \delta$obey hypergeometric equations and are numerically surprisingly close to puresystem exponents (though associated to a completely different diffusionlength). additional disorder in the reaction rates, as well as some openquestions, are also discussed.

0811.1422	anderson transition on the cayley tree as a traveling wave critical  point for various probability distributions	for anderson localization on the cayley tree, we study the statistics ofvarious observables as a function of the disorder strength $w$ and the number$n$ of generations. we first consider the landauer transmission $t_n$. in thelocalized phase, its logarithm follows the traveling wave form $\ln t_n \simeq\bar{\ln t_n} + \ln t^*$ where (i) the disorder-averaged value moves linearly$\bar{\ln (t_n)} \simeq - \frac{n}{\xi_{loc}}$ and the localization lengthdiverges as $\xi_{loc} \sim (w-w_c)^{-\nu_{loc}}$ with $\nu_{loc}=1$ (ii) thevariable $t^*$ is a fixed random variable with a power-law tail $p^*(t^*) \sim1/(t^*)^{1+\beta(w)}$ for large $t^*$ with $0&lt;\beta(w) \leq 1/2$, so that allinteger moments of $t_n$ are governed by rare events. in the delocalized phase,the transmission $t_n$ remains a finite random variable as $n \to \infty$, andwe measure near criticality the essential singularity $\bar{\ln (t)} \sim - |w_c-w |^{-\kappa_t}$ with $\kappa_t \sim 0.25$. we then consider thestatistical properties of normalized eigenstates, in particular the entropy andthe inverse participation ratios (i.p.r.). in the localized phase, the typicalentropy diverges as $(w-w_c)^{- \nu_s}$ with $\nu_s \sim 1.5$, whereas it growslinearly in $n$ in the delocalized phase. finally for the i.p.r., we explainhow closely related variables propagate as traveling waves in the delocalizedphase. in conclusion, both the localized phase and the delocalized phase arecharacterized by the traveling wave propagation of some probabilitydistributions, and the anderson localization/delocalization transition thencorresponds to a traveling/non-traveling critical point. moreover, our resultspoint towards the existence of several exponents $\nu$ at criticality.
