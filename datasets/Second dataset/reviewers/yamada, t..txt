physics;0410229	ion acceleration during internal magnetic reconnection events in tst-2	characteristics of ion acceleration in the internal magnetic reconnectionevents (ire) have been studied by means of a neutral particle energy analyzer(npa) in tokyo spherical tokamak (tst-2). the major and minor radii are 0.38 mand 0.25m, respectively. the magnetic field strength is 0.3t and the maximumplasma current is up to 140 ka. the electron and ion temperatures are 0.4-0.5kev and 0.1 kev, respectively and the electron density is ~1x1019 m-3. the npacan be scanned toroidally from q = 74&amp;deg; (cw) to q = 114&amp;deg; (ccw), where q= 90&amp;deg; corresponds to the perpendicular sightline. the direction of theplasma current is cw. the npa signals are digitized at every 50 ms. the npa iscalibrated in the energy range of 0.1 kev &lt; e &lt; 8.4 kev. when the ire occurs,it is observed that the plasma current increases by ~ 20% and the loop voltagedrops from 0.6 v to-5 v for ~ 0.1 ms. the enhanced charge exchange flux isobserved by more than one order of magnitude at ~ 1 kev for this reconnectionphase. the ion temperature increases by 80 ev at ires. the angle q dependenceof increment of ti shows that dti (q = 74&amp;deg;) is higher than that for q =114&amp;deg;. this observation suggests that an ion is accelerated initially in thedirection of magnetic field lines. the time evolution of the ion distributionfunction is simulated with a fokker-planck code taking into account theelectric field effects.

0904.0452	the chandra deep protocluster survey: ly-alpha blobs are powered by  heating, not cooling	we present the results of a 400ks chandra survey of 29 extended ly-alphaemitting nebulae (ly-alpha blobs, labs) in the z=3.09 proto-cluster in thessa22 field. we detect luminous x-ray counterparts in five labs, implying alarge fraction of active galactic nuclei (agn) in labs, f_agn = 17% down tol_2-32kev ~ 10^44 erg/s. all of the agn appear to be heavily obscured, withspectral indices implying obscuring column densities of n_h &gt; 10^23 cm^-2. theagn fraction should be considered a lower limit, since several more labs notdetected with chandra show agn signatures in their mid-infrared emission. weshow that the uv luminosities of the agn are easily capable of powering theextended ly-alpha emission via photo-ionization alone. when combined with theuv flux from a starburst component, and energy deposited by mechanicalfeedback, we demonstrate that 'heating' by a central source, rather thangravitational cooling is the most likely power source of labs. we argue thatall labs could be powered in this manner, but that the luminous host galaxiesare often just below the sensitivity limits of current instrumentation, or areheavily obscured. no individual labs show evidence for extended x-ray emission,and a stack equivalent to a &gt;9ms exposure of an average lab also yields nostatistical detection of a diffuse x-ray component. the resulting diffusex-ray/ly-alpha luminosity limit implies there is no hot (t&gt;10^7 k) gascomponent in these halos, and also rules out inverse compton scattering ofcosmic microwave background photons, or local far-infrared photons, as a viablepower source for labs.

0905.3320	moircs deep survey iii: active galactic nuclei in massive galaxies at  z=2-4	we investigate the x-ray properties of the k-band-selected galaxies atredshift 2 &lt; z &lt; 4 by using our deep near-infrared images obtained in themoircs deep survey project and the published chandra x-ray source catalog. 61x-ray sources with the 2-10 kev luminosity l_x = 10^{42}-10^{44} erg/s areidentified with the k-selected galaxies and we found that they are exclusively(90%) associated with the massive objects with stellar mass larger than10^{10.5} msun. our results are consistent with the idea that the m_bh/m_strratio of the galaxies at z=2-4 is similar to the present-day value. on theother hand, the agn detection rate among the very massive galaxies with thestellar mass larger than 10^{11} msun is high, 33% (26/78). they are activeobjects in the sense that the black-hole mass accretion rate is ~ 1-50% of theeddington limit if they indeed have similar m_bh/m_str ratio with thoseobserved in the local universe. the active duration in the agn duty cycle ofthe high-redshift massive galaxies seems large.

0907.0133	moircs deep survey iv: evolution of galaxy stellar mass function back to  z ~ 3	we use very deep near-infrared (nir) imaging data obtained in moircs deepsurvey (mods) to investigate the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass functionback to z~3. the mods data reach j=24.2, h=23.1, k=23.1 (5sigma, vegamagnitude) over 103 arcmin^2 (wide) and j=25.1, h=23.7, k=24.1 over 28 arcmin^2(deep) in the goods-north region. the wide and very deep nir data allow us tomeasure the number density of galaxies down to low stellar mass (10^9-10^10msun) even at high redshift with high statistical accuracy. the normalizationof the mass function decreases with redshift and the integrated stellar massdensity becomes ~ 8-18% of the local value at z~2 and ~ 4-9% at z~3, which areconsistent with results of previous studies in general fields. furthermore, wefound that the low-mass slope becomes steeper with redshift from alpha ~- 1.3at z~1 to alpha ~- 1.6 at z~3, and that the evolution of the number density oflow-mass (10^9-10^10 msun) galaxies is weaker than that of m* (~10^11 msun)galaxies. this indicates that the contribution of low-mass galaxies to thetotal stellar mass density has been significant at high redshift. thesteepening of the low-mass slope with redshift is opposite trend expected fromthe stellar mass dependence of the specific star formation rate reported inprevious studies. the present result suggests that the hierarchical mergingprocess overwhelmed the effect of the stellar mass growth by star formation andwas very important for the stellar mass assembly of these galaxies at 1&lt;~z&lt;~3.

0912.2934	concepts of alpha-particle condensation	certain aspects of the recently proposed antisymmetrised alpha particleproduct state wave function, or thsr alpha cluster wave function, for thedescription of the ground state in 8be, the hoyle state in 12c, and analogousstates in heavier nuclei, are elaborated in detail. for instance, the influenceof antisymmetrisation in the hoyle state on the bosonic character of the alphaparticles is studied carefully. it is shown to be weak, so that bosonic aspectsare predominant. the de broglie wave length of alpha particles in the hoylestate is shown to be much larger than the inter-alpha distance. it is pointedout that the bosonic features of low density alpha gas states have measurableconsequences, one of which, that is enhanced multi-alpha decay properties,likely already have been detected. consistent with experiment, the width of theproposed analogue to the hoyle state in 16o at the excitation energy ofe_x=15.1 mev is estimated to be very small (34 kev), lending credit to theexistence of heavier hoyle-like states. the intrinsic single boson densitymatrix of a self-bound bose system can, under physically desirable boundaryconditions, be defined unambiguously. one eigenvalue then separates out, beingclose to the number of alpha's in the system. differences between brink andthsr alpha cluster wave functions are worked out. no cluster model of the brinktype can describe the hoyle state with a single configuration. on the contrary,many superpositions of the brink type are necessary, implying delocalisationtowards an alpha product state. it is shown that single alpha particle orbitsin condensates of different nuclei are almost the same. it is thus argued thatalpha particle antisymmetrised product states of the thsr type are a verypromising novel and useful concept in nuclear physics.

1001.1943	a search for galaxies in and around an hi overdense region at z=5	we present the discovery of a large-scale structure of emission-line galaxiesat redshift z=4.86 behind a massive cluster of galaxies, a1689. previousspectroscopic observations of a galaxy, a1689-7.1 at z=4.87, near thisstructure, revealed a possible overdense region of inter-galactic medium (igm)around the galaxy, which extends at least ~80 comoving mpc along the line ofsight. in order to investigate whether this z~5 igm overdense region contains agalaxy overdensity, we undertook narrow- and broad-band imaging observationsaround a1689-7.1 with subaru/suprime-cam. we detected 51 candidate ly-alphaemitters at redshift z=4.86+-0.03 in the 32 x 24 arcmin^2 field of view. aftercorrection for lensing by the foreground cluster, we found a large-scale (~20 x60 comoving mpc) overdense region of galaxies around a1689-7.1 in the sourceplane at z=4.86. the densest peak in this region has an overdensity of delta~4,suggesting that this structure is probably a good candidate for a protocluster.a1689-7.1 is located at the edge of this region, where the local galaxy densityis ~1.6 times the mean density and is close to the density contrast in the igmalong the line of sight to a1689-7.1 estimated from the optical depth. theoverdensities of galaxies we have found may suggest that at least some parts ofthe igm overdense region have already started to form galaxies and moreoverthey relate to the formation of a protocluster. although we lack information onthe three dimensional distributions of both igm and galaxy overdense regions,the similarity of the scales of both regions may suggest that the two are partsof a single large-scale structure, which would be an large edge-on sheet alongthe line of sight with a size of ~20 x 60 x 80 comoving mpc.

1001.3690	unveiling the nature of submillimeter galaxy sxdf850.6	we present an 880 micron submillimeter array (sma) detection of thesubmillimeter galaxy sxdf850.6. sxdf850.6 is a bright source (s(850 micron) = 8mjy) detected in the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades), and hasmultiple possible radio counterparts in its deep radio image obtained at thevla. our new sma detection finds that the submm emission coincides with thebrightest radio emission that is found ~8" north of the coordinates determinedfrom scuba. despite the lack of detectable counterparts in deep uv/opticalimages, we find a source at the sma position in near-infrared and longerwavelength images. we perform sed model fits to uv-optical-ir photometry (u, b,v, r, i', z', j, h, k, 3.6 micron, 4.5 micron, 5.8 micron, and 8.0 micron) andto submm-radio photometry (850 micron, 880 micron, 1100 micron, and 21 cm)independently, and we find both are well described by starburst templates at aredshift of z ~= 2.2 (+/- 0.3). the best-fit parameters from the uv-optical-irsed fit are a redshift of z = 1.87 (+0.15/-0.07), a stellar mass of m_star =2.5 +2.2/-0.3 x 10^11 m_sun, an extinction of a_v = 3.0 (+0.3/-1.0) mag, and anage of 720 (+1880/-210) myr. the submm-radio sed fit provides a consistentredshift of z ~ 1.8-2.5, an ir luminosity of l_ir = (7-26) x 10^12 l_sun, and astar formation rate of 1300-4500 m_sun/yr. these results suggest that sxdf850.6is a mature system already having a massive amount of old stellar populationconstructed before its submm bright phase and is experiencing a dustystarburst, possibly induced by major mergers.

1003.3717	"dark" grb 080325 in a dusty massive galaxy at z ~ 2	we present optical and near infrared observations of grb 080325 classified asa "dark grb". near-infrared observations with subaru/moircs provided a cleardetection of afterglow in ks band, although no optical counterpart wasreported. the flux ratio of rest-wavelength optical to x-ray bands of theafterglow indicates that the dust extinction along the line of sight to theafterglow is av = 2.7 - 10 mag. this large extinction is probably the majorreason for optical faintness of grb 080325. the j - ks color of the hostgalaxy, (j - ks = 1.3 in ab magnitude), is significantly redder than those fortypical grb hosts previously identified. in addition to j and ks bands, opticalimages in b, rc, i', and z' bands with subaru/suprime-cam were obtained atabout one year after the burst, and a photometric redshift of the host isestimated to be z_{photo} = 1.9. the host luminosity is comparable to l^{*} atz \sim 2 in contrast to the sub-l^{*} property of typical grb hosts at lowerredshifts. the best-fit stellar population synthesis model for the host showsthat a large dust extinction (av = 0.8 mag) attributes to the red nature of thehost and that the host galaxy is massive (m_{*} = 7.0 \times 10^{10} msun)which is one of the most massive grb hosts previously identified. by assumingthat the mass-metallicity relation for star-forming galaxies at z \sim 2 isapplicable for the grb host, this large stellar mass suggests the highmetallicity environment around grb 080325, consistent with inferred largeextinction.

1103.3940	nuclear alpha-particle condensates	the $\alpha$-particle condensate in nuclei is a novel state described by aproduct state of $\alpha$'s, all with their c.o.m. in the lowest 0s orbit. wedemonstrate that a typical $\alpha$-particle condensate is the hoyle state($e_{x}=7.65$ mev, $0^+_2$ state in $^{12}$c), which plays a crucial role forthe synthesis of $^{12}$c in the universe. the influence of antisymmentrizationin the hoyle state on the bosonic character of the $\alpha$ particle isdiscussed in detail. it is shown to be weak. the bosonic aspects in the hoylestate, therefore, are predominant. it is conjectured that $\alpha$-particlecondensate states also exist in heavier $n\alpha$ nuclei, like $^{16}$o,$^{20}$ne, etc. for instance the $0^+_6$ state of $^{16}$o at $e_{x}=15.1$ mevis identified from a theoretical analysis as being a strong candidate of a$4\alpha$ condensate. the calculated small width (34 kev) of $0^+_6$,consistent with data, lends credit to the existence of heavier hoyle-analoguestates. in non-self-conjugated nuclei such as $^{11}$b and $^{13}$c, we discusscandidates for the product states of clusters, composed of $\alpha$'s,triton's, and neutrons etc. the relationship of $\alpha$-particle condensationin finite nuclei to quartetting in symmetric nuclear matter is investigatedwith the help of an in-medium modified four-nucleon equation. a nonlinear orderparameter equation for quartet condensation is derived and solved for $\alpha$particle condensation in infinite nuclear matter. the strong qualitativedifference with the pairing case is pointed out.

1110.2488	images of the extended outer regions of the debris ring around hr 4796 a	we present high-contrast images of hr 4796 a taken with subaru/hiciao inh-band, resolving the debris disk in scattered light. the application ofspecialized angular differential imaging methods (adi) allows us to trace theinner edge of the disk with high precision, and reveals a pair of "streamers"extending radially outwards from the ansae. using a simple disk model with apower-law surface brightness profile, we demonstrate that the observedstreamers can be understood as part of the smoothly tapered outer boundary ofthe debris disk, which is most visible at the ansae. our observations areconsistent with the expected result of a narrow planetesimal ring being groundup in a collisional cascade, yielding dust with a wide range of grain sizes.radiation forces leave large grains in the ring and push smaller grains ontoelliptical, or even hyperbolic trajectories. we measure and characterize thedisk's surface brightness profile, and confirm the previously suspected offsetof the disk's center from the star's position along the ring's major axis.furthermore, we present first evidence for an offset along the minor axis. suchoffsets are commonly viewed as signposts for the presence of unseen planetswithin a disk's cavity. our images also offer new constraints on the presenceof companions down to the planetary mass regime (~9 jupiter masses at 0.5", ~3jupiter masses at 1").

1110.6509	isoscalar monopole excitations in $^{16}$o: $\alpha$-cluster states at  low energy and mean-field-type states at higher energy	isoscalar monopole strength function in $^{16}$o up to $e_{x}\simeq40$ mev isdiscussed. we found that the fine structures at the low energy region up to$e_{x} \simeq 16$ mev in the experimental monopole strength function obtainedby the $^{16}$o$(\alpha,\alpha^{\prime})$ reaction can be rather satisfactorilyreproduced within the framework of the $4\alpha$ cluster model, while the grossthree bump structures observed at the higher energy region ($16 \lesssim e_{x}\lesssim 40$ mev) look likely to be approximately reconciled by the mean-fieldcalculations such as rpa and qrpa. in this paper, it is emphasized that twodifferent types of monopole excitations exist in $^{16}$o; one is the monopoleexcitation to cluster states which is dominant in the lower energy part ($e_{x}\lesssim 16$ mev), and the other is the monopole excitation of the mean-fieldtype such as one-particle one-hole ($1p1h$) which {is attributed} mainly to thehigher energy part ($16 \lesssim e_{x} \lesssim 40$ mev). it is found that thischaracter of the monopole excitations originates from the fact that the groundstate of $^{16}$o with the dominant doubly closed shell structure has a dualityof the mean-field-type {as well as} $\alpha$-clustering {character}. this dualnature of the ground state seems to be a common feature in light nuclei.

1202.6139	discovery of small-scale spiral structures in the disk of sao 206462 (hd  135344b): implications for the physical state of the disk from spiral density  wave theory	we present high-resolution, h-band, imaging observations, collected withsubaru/hiciao, of the scattered light from the transitional disk around sao206462 (hd 135344b). although previous sub-mm imagery suggested the existenceof the dust-depleted cavity at r~46au, our observations reveal the presence ofscattered light components as close as 0.2" (~28au) from the star. moreover, wehave discovered two small-scale spiral structures lying within 0.5" (~70au). wepresent models for the spiral structures using the spiral density wave theory,and derive a disk aspect ratio of h~0.1, which is consistent with previoussub-mm observations. this model can potentially give estimates of thetemperature and rotation profiles of the disk based on dynamical processes,independently from sub-mm observations. it also predicts the evolution of thespiral structures, which can be observable on timescales of 10-20 years,providing conclusive tests of the model. while we cannot uniquely identify theorigin of these spirals, planets embedded in the disk may be capable ofexciting the observed morphology. assuming that this is the case, we can makepredictions on the locations and, possibly, the masses of the unseen planets.such planets may be detected by future multi-wavelengths observations.

1203.1612	the missing cavities in the seeds polarized scattered light images of  transitional protoplanetary disks: a generic disk model	transitional circumstellar disks around young stellar objects have adistinctive infrared deficit around 10 microns in their spectral energydistributions (sed), recently measured by the spitzer infrared spectrograph(irs), suggesting dust depletion in the inner regions. these disks have beenconfirmed to have giant central cavities by imaging of the submillimeter(sub-mm) continuum emission using the submillimeter array (sma). however, thepolarized near-infrared scattered light images for most objects in a systematicirs/sma cross sample, obtained by hiciao on the subaru telescope, show noevidence for the cavity, in clear contrast with sma and spitzer observations.radiative transfer modeling indicates that many of these scattered light imagesare consistent with a smooth spatial distribution for micron-sized grains, withlittle discontinuity in the surface density of the micron-sized grains at thecavity edge. here we present a generic disk model that can simultaneouslyaccount for the general features in irs, sma, and subaru observations.particularly, the scattered light images for this model are computed, whichagree with the general trend seen in subaru data. decoupling between thespatial distributions of the micron-sized dust and mm-sized dust inside thecavity is suggested by the model, which, if confirmed, necessitates amechanism, such as dust filtration, for differentiating the small and big dustin the cavity clearing process. our model also suggests an inwardly increasinggas-to-dust-ratio in the inner disk, and different spatial distributions forthe small dust inside and outside the cavity, echoing the predictions in graincoagulation and growth models.

1203.3633	profiles of lyman\alpha\ emission lines	we present the results of the observations of the ly\alpha\ line profiles of91 emission-line galaxies at z=3.1 with the spectral resolution of\lambda/\delta\lambda (fwhm) = 1700, or 180 km/s. a significant fraction, ~50%of the observed objects show the characteristic double peaks in their ly\alphaprofile. the red peak is much stronger than the blue one for most of the cases.the red peaks themselves also show weak but significant asymmetry and theirwidths are correlated with the velocity separation of the red and the bluepeaks, which implies that the peaks are not isolated multiple components withdifferent velocities but the parts of the single line which is modified by theabsorption and/or scattering by the associated neutral hydrogen gas. thecharacteristic profile can be naturally explained by the scattering in theexpanding shell of neutral hydrogen surrounding the ly\alpha\ emitting regionwhile the attenuation by the inter-galactic medium should also be considered.our results suggest that the star-formation in these ly\alpha\ emitters aredominated by the young burst-like events which produce the intrinsic ly\alpha\emission as well as the gas outflow.

1204.4934	diffuse lyman alpha haloes around lyman alpha emitters at z=3: do dark  matter distributions determine the lyman alpha spatial extents?	using stacks of ly-a images of 2128 ly-a emitters (laes) and 24 protoclusteruv-selected galaxies (lbgs) at z=3.1, we examine the surface brightnessprofiles of ly-a haloes around high-z galaxies as a function of environment anduv luminosity. we find that the slopes of the ly-a radial profiles becomeflatter as the mpc-scale lae surface densities increase, but they are almostindependent of the central uv luminosities. the characteristic exponentialscale lengths of the ly-a haloes appear to be proportional to the square of thelae surface densities (r(lya) \propto sigma(lae)^2). including the diffuse,extended ly-a haloes, the rest-frame ly-a equivalent width of the laes in thedensest regions approaches ew_0(lya) ~ 200 a, the maximum value expected foryoung (&lt; 10^7 yr) galaxies. this suggests that ly-a photons formed via shockcompression by gas outflows or cooling radiation by gravitational gas inflowsmay partly contribute to illuminate the ly-a haloes; however, most of theirly-a luminosity can be explained by photo-ionisation by ionising photons orscattering of ly-a photons produced in hii regions in and around the centralgalaxies. regardless of the source of ly-a photons, if the ly-a haloes tracethe overall gaseous structure following the dark matter distributions, it isnot surprising that the ly-a spatial extents depend more strongly on thesurrounding mpc-scale environment than on the activities of the centralgalaxies.

1205.3159	high-contrast nir polarization imaging of mwc480	one of the key predictions of modeling from the ir excess of herbig ae starsis that for protoplanetary disks, where significant grain growth and settlinghas occurred, the dust disk has flattened to the point that it can be partiallyor largely shadowed by the innermost material at or near the dust sublimationradius. when the self-shadowing has already started, the outer disk is expectedto be detected in scattered light only in the exceptional cases that the scaleheight of the dust disk at the sublimation radius is smaller than usual.high-contrast imaging combined with the ir spectral energy distribution allowus to measure the degree of flattening of the disk, as well as to determine theproperties of the outer disk. we present polarimetric differential imaging in$h$ band obtained with subaru/hiciao of one such system, mwc 480. the hiciaodata were obtained at a historic minimum of the nir excess. the disk isdetected in scattered light from 0\farcs2-1\farcs0 (27.4-137au). together withthe marginal detection of the disk from 1998 february 24 by hst/nicmos, ourdata constrain the opening half angle for the disk to lie between1.3$\leq\theta\leq 2.2^\circ$. when compared with similar measures in co forthe gas disk from the literature, the dust disk subtends only $\sim$30% of thegas disk scale height (h/r$\sim$0.03). such a dust disk is a factor of 5-7flatter than transitional disks, which have structural signatures that giantplanets have formed.

(2012), whosemembers only show evidence of the cavity in the millimeter-sized dust but notthe sub-micron-sized dust in resolved images. the two classes of(pre-)transitional disks may form through different mechanisms, or they mayjust be at different evolution stages in the disk clearing process.

1307.2886	direct imaging of a cold jovian exoplanet in orbit around the sun-like  star gj 504	several exoplanets have recently been imaged at wide separations of &gt;10 aufrom their parent stars. these span a limited range of ages (&lt;50 myr) andatmospheric properties, with temperatures of 800--1800 k and very red colors (j- h &gt; 0.5 mag), implying thick cloud covers. furthermore, substantial modeluncertainties exist at these young ages due to the unknown initial conditionsat formation, which can lead to an order of magnitude of uncertainty in themodeled planet mass. here, we report the direct imaging discovery of a jovianexoplanet around the sun-like star gj 504, detected as part of the seedssurvey. the system is older than all other known directly-imaged planets; as aresult, its estimated mass remains in the planetary regime independent ofuncertainties related to choices of initial conditions in the exoplanetmodeling. using the most common exoplanet cooling model, and given the systemage of 160 [+350, -60] myr, gj 504 b has an estimated mass of 4 [+4.5, -1.0]jupiter masses, among the lowest of directly imaged planets. its projectedseparation of 43.5 au exceeds the typical outer boundary of ~30 au predictedfor the core accretion mechanism. gj 504 b is also significantly cooler (510[+30, -20] k) and has a bluer color (j-h = -0.23 mag) than previously imagedexoplanets, suggesting a largely cloud-free atmosphere accessible tospectroscopic characterization. thus, it has the potential of providing novelinsights into the origins of giant planets, as well as their atmosphericproperties.

0801.3131	density-induced suppression of the alpha-particle condensate in nuclear  matter and the structure of alpha cluster states in nuclei	at low densities, with decreasing temperatures, in symmetric nuclear matteralpha-particles are formed, which eventually give raise to a quantum condensatewith four-nucleon alpha-like correlations (quartetting). starting with a modelof alpha-matter, where undistorted alpha particles interact via an effectiveinteraction such as the ali-bodmer potential, the suppression of the condensatefraction at zero temperature with increasing density is considered. using ajastrow-feenberg approach, it is found that the condensate fraction vanishesnear saturation density. additionally, the modification of the internal stateof the alpha particle due to medium effects will further reduce the condensate.  in finite systems, an enhancement of the s state wave function of the c.o.m.orbital of alpha particle motion is considered as the correspondence to thecondensate. wave functions have been constructed for self-conjugate 4n nucleiwhich describe the condensate state, but are fully antisymmetrized on thenucleonic level. these condensate-like cluster wave functions have beensuccessfully applied to describe properties of low-density states near the nalpha threshold. comparison with ocm calculations in 12c and 16o shows strongenhancement of the occupation of the s-state c.o.m. orbital of thealpha-particles. this enhancement is decreasing if the baryon densityincreases, similar to the density-induced suppression of the condensatefraction in alpha matter. the ground states of 12c and 16o show no enhancementat all, thus a quartetting condensate cannot be formed at saturation densities.

1310.4183	direct imaging detection of methane in the atmosphere of gj 504 b	most exoplanets detected by direct imaging so far have been characterized byrelatively hot (&gt; ~1000 k) and cloudy atmospheres. a surprising feature in someof their atmospheres has been a distinct lack of methane, possibly implyingnon-equilibrium chemistry. recently, we reported the discovery of a planetarycompanion to the sun-like star gj 504 using subaru/hiciao within the seedssurvey. the planet is substantially colder (&lt;600 k) than previously imagedplanets, and has indications of fewer clouds, which implies that it representsa new class of planetary atmospheres with expected similarities to late t-typebrown dwarfs in the same temperature range. if so, one might also expect thepresence of significant methane absorption, which is characteristic of suchobjects. here, we report the detection of deep methane absorption in theatmosphere of gj 504 b, using the spectral differential imaging mode of hiciaoto distinguish the absorption feature around 1.6 um. we also report updated jhkphotometry based on new ks-band data and a re-analysis of the existing data.the results support the notion that gj 504 b has atmospheric propertiesdistinct from other imaged exoplanets, and will become a useful referenceobject for future planets in the same temperature range.

1401.1713	theory for quartet condensation in fermi systems with applications to  nuclei and nuclear matter	the theory of quartet condensation is further developed. the onset ofquartetting in homgeneous fermionic matter is studied with the help of anin-medium modified four fermion equation. it is found that at very low densityquartetting wins over pairing. at zero temperature, in analogy to pairing, aset of equations for the quartet order parameter is given. contrary to pairing,quartetting only exists for strong coupling and breaks down for weak coupling.reasons for this finding are detailed. in an application to nuclear matter, thecritical temperature for alpha particle condensation can reach values up toaround 8 mev. the disappearance of alpha particles with increasing density,i.e. the mott transition, is investigated. in finite nuclei the hoyle state,that is the second 0+ state of 12c is identified as an 'alpha-particlecondensate' state. it is conjectured that such states also exist in heaviern-alpha nuclei, like 16o, 20ne, etc. the sixth 0+ state in 16o is proposed asan analogue to the hoyle state. the gross-pitaevski equation is employed tomake an estimate of the maximum number of alpha particles a condensate statecan contain. possible quartet condensation in other systems is discussedbriefly.

1405.6067	container structure of alpha alpha lambda clusters in $_\lambda^9$be	new concept of clustering is discussed in $\lambda$ hypernuclei using anew-type microscopic cluster model wave function, which has a structure thatconstituent clusters are confined in a container, whose size is a variationalparameter and which we refer to as hyper-tohsaki-horiuchi-schuck-r\"opke(hyper-thsr) wave function. by using the hyper-thsr wave function, $2\alpha +\lambda$ cluster structure in ${^{9}_\lambda{\rm be}}$ is investigated. we showthat full microscopic solutions in the $2\alpha + \lambda$ cluster system,which are given as $2\alpha + \lambda$ brink-gcm wave functions, are almostperfectly reproduced by the single configurations of the hyper-thsr wavefunction. the squared overlaps between the both wave functions are calculatedto be $99.5$%, $99.4$%, and $97.7$% for $j^\pi=0^+$, $2^+$, and $4^+$ states,respectively. we also simulate the structural change by adding the $\lambda$particle, by varying the $\lambda n$ interaction artificially. as the increaseof the $\lambda n$ interaction, the $\lambda$ particle gets to move more deeplyinside the core and invokes strongly the spatial core shrinkage, andaccordingly distinct localized $2\alpha$ clusters appear in the nucleonicintrinsic density, though in ${^{8}{\rm be}}$ rather gaslike $2\alpha$-clusterstructure is shown. the origin of the localization is associated with thestrong effect of pauli principle. we conclude that the container picture of the$2\alpha$ and $\lambda$ clusters is essential in understanding the clusterstructure in ${^{9}_\lambda{\rm be}}$, in which the very compact spatiallocalization of clusters is shown in the density distribution.

(1999). ourspectroscopic survey of 44 objects in the field shows an excess of 6 redgalaxies securely identified at z \sim 1, with a mean redshift of z =1.005 +/-0.002. we estimate a velocity dispersion of \sigma = 771 (+430/-160) km s(-1)based on these 6 galaxies and a v-band mass-to-light ratio of 215 (+308/-77)h_50 m/l_sol. our observations thus confirm the existence of a massivestructure acting as the lens, which explains the unusual configuration of thetriple quasar. hence, there is no more need to invoke the existence of a ``darkcluster'' to understand this lens system.

astro-ph;0104473	jhk spectra of the z=2.39 radio galaxy 53w002	we present low-resolution, near-ir jhk spectra of the weak z=2.39 radiogalaxy 53w002, obtained with the oh-airglow suppressor spectrograph (ohs) andcooled infrared spectrograph and camera for ohs (cisco) on the subarutelescope. they cover rest-frame wavelengths of 3400-7200 a, and the emissionlines of [o ii]3727, hb, [o iii]4959, 5007, ha, [n ii]6548, 6583 and [sii]6716, 6731 were detected. using the ha/hb line ratio, we find an extinctionof e(b-v)=0.14. the emission-line ratios are reproduced by a cloud of electrondensity n_e=1x10^{3-4}(/cm3) with solar metallicity, ionized by an alpha=-0.7power-law continuum with ionizing parameter u=1x10^-3. in addition to theseemission lines, we make the first spectroscopic confirmation of the balmerdiscontinuity in a high-z radio galaxy. together with rest-frame uv photometryfrom the literature, we show that at least 1/3 of the present stellar mass wasformed in the current starburst. the stellar mass was estimated to be(1-1.4)x10^11 m_sol by one-component model fitting, which is smaller than thatof typical z~1 b2/6c radio galaxies. we suggest that 53w002 is currentlyassembling a large part of its stellar mass through merger events with thesurrounding sub-galactic clumps, some of which can be identified with the lyaemitters detected in narrow-band imaging. after a few such events over the nextfew gyr, 53w002 will evolve into a massive elliptical galaxy.

astro-ph;0205480	discovery of the host galaxy of hdf850.1, the brightest sub-mm source in  the hubble deep field	despite extensive observational efforts, the brightest sub--mm source in thehubble deep field, hdf850.1, has failed to yield a convincing optical/infraredidentification almost 4 years after its discovery. this failure is all the morenotable given the availability of supporting multi-frequency data ofunparalleled depth, and sub-arcsec positional accuracy for the sub-mm/mmsource. consequently, hdf850.1 has become a test case of the possibility thatthe most violently star-forming objects in the universe are too red and/ordistant to be seen in the deepest optical images. here we report the discoveryof the host galaxy of hdf850.1. this object has been revealed by carefulanalysis of a new, deep k-prime image of the hdf obtained with the subaru 8.2-mtelescope. its reality is confirmed by a similar analysis of the hst nicmosf160w image of the same region. this object is extremely faint (k=23.5), clumpy(on sub-arcsec scales) and very red (i-k &gt; 5.2; h-k = 1.4 +- 0.35). thelikelihood that it is the correct identification is strongly reinforced by areanalysis of the combined merlin+vla 1.4-ghz map of the field which yields anew radio detection of hdf850.1 only 0.1 arcsec from the new near-ircounterpart, and with sufficient positional accuracy to exclude all previouslyconsidered alternative optical candidates. we have calculated new confidencelimits on the estimated redshift of hdf850.1 and find z = 4.1 +- 0.5. we alsocalculate that the flux density of hdf850.1 has been boosted by a factor of ~3through lensing by the intervening elliptical 3-586.0, consistent withpredictions that a small but significant fraction of blank-field sub-mm sourcesare lensed by foreground galaxies. we discuss the wider implications of theseresults for the sub-mm population and cosmic star-formation history.

astro-ph;0212534	cosmic star formation history associated with qso activity: an approach  using the black hole to bulge mass correlation	the tight correlation between the masses of central black holes and theirhost spheroids in nearby galaxies and active galactic nuclei suggests thatblack hole growth is closely related to their spheroid formation. based on ourprevious work regarding such a joint evolutionary scheme and the consequentialblack hole to bulge mass correlation, we use the x-ray luminosity function ofagn and the cosmological evolution rate which are from rosat x-ray surveys toestimate the cosmic star formation history associated with the black holegrowth. by the basic assumption that the major black hole growth occurs duringthe luminous agn phase, the luminosity function of agns as a function ofredshift traces not only the accretion history of the black holes but also thecosmic star formation history of the spheroids.  although the space density of the especially luminous qsos is very low, weshow that the total amount of star formation associated with the massive blackhole growth is almost the same as that of lyman break galaxies detected by thecurrent optical deep surveys. we thus argue that the optical deep surveys maymiss about half of the net star formation in our universe, this is probably dueto in part significant dust extinction as well as the small field of view ofprevious optical surveys which cannot sample such rare events with relativelyshort time scale. however, the far infrared emission from the dust heated bystar fomation on-going during the black hole growth could sufficiently accountfor the observed scuba number counts, and would be the probable dominatingenergy source of the suba population.

astro-ph;0302466	subaru deep survey. iv. discovery of a large-scale structure at redshift  \simeq 5	we report the discovery of a large-scale structure of lyman alpha emitters(laes) at z=4.86 based on wide-field imaging with the prime-focus camera(suprime-cam) on the subaru telescope. we observed a 25' x 45' area of thesubaru deep field in a narrow band (nb, lambdac=7126 a and fwhm=73 a) togetherwith r and i'. we isolate from these data 43 lae candidates down to nb=25.5 magusing color criteria. follow-up spectroscopy of five candidates suggests thecontamination by low-z objects to be ~ 20%. we find that the lae candidates areclustered in an elongated region on the sky of 20 mpc in width and 50 mpc inlength at z=4.86, which is comparable in size to present-day large-scalestructures (we adopt h0=70 km/s/mpc, omega0=0.3, lambda0=0.7). this elongatedregion includes a circular region of 12 mpc radius of higher surfaceoverdensity (delta=2), which may be the progenitor of a cluster of galaxies.assuming this circular region to be a sphere with a spatial overdensity of 2,we compare our observation with predictions by cold dark matter models. we findthat an omega0=0.3 flat model with sigma8=0.9 predicts the number of suchspheres consistent with the observed number (one sphere in our survey volume)if the bias parameter of laes is b \simeq 6. this value suggests that thetypical mass of dark haloes hosting laes at z \simeq 5 is of the order of 10^12msolar. such a large mass poses an interesting question about the nature oflaes.

(hypernovae being a tentativelydefined class of sne with very broad absorption features: these featuressuggest a large velocity of the ejected material and possibly a large explosionkinetic energy.) comparison with spectra of other hypernovae shows that thespectrum of sn 2003dh obtained on 2003 may 8 and 9, i.e., 34-35 rest-frame daysafter the grb (for z=0.1685), are similar to those of sn 1997ef obtained ~34-42days after the fiducial time of explosion of that sn. the match with sn 1998bwspectra is not as good (at rest 7300-8000 a, but again spectra obtained ~33-43days after grb 980425 are preferred. this indicates that the sn may haveintermediate properties between sne 1997ef and 1998bw. based on the analogywith the other hypernovae, the time of explosion of sn 2003dh is thenconstrained to be between -8 and +2 days of the grb. the si and o p-cygni linesof sn 2003dh seem comparable to those of sn 1997ef, which suggests that theejected mass in sn 2003dh may match that in sn 1997ef. polarization wasmarginally detected at optical wavelengths. this is consistent withmeasurements of the late afterglow, implying that it mostly originated in theinterstellar medium of the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0403270	large cosmic variance in the clustering properties of lyman alpha  emitters at z~5	we reported in a previous paper the discovery of large-scale structure oflyman alpha emitters (laes) at z=4.86+-0.03 with a projected size of 20 mpc x50 mpc in narrow-band data of a 25' x 45' area of the subaru deep field(omega_0=0.3, lambda_0=0.7, h0=70 km/s/mpc). however, the surveyed area, whichcorresponds to 55 mpc x 100 mpc, was not large enough that we can conclude thatwe are seeing a typical distribution of z~5 laes. in this letter, we report theresults of follow-up imaging of the same sky area using a new narrow-bandfilter (nb704, lambda_c=7046 a and fwhm=100 a) to detect laes at z=4.79, i.e.,laes lying closer to us by 39 mpc on average than the z=4.86 objects. we detect51 laes at z=4.79+-0.04 down to nb704=25.7, and find that their skydistribution is quite different from the z=4.86 laes'. the clustering of z=4.79laes is very weak on any scales and there is no large-scale high- contraststructure. the shape and the amplitude of the angular correlation function arethus largely different between the two samples. these results demonstrate alarge cosmic variance in the clustering properties of laes on scales of ~ 50mpc.

astro-ph;0405221	a subaru search for ly-alpha blobs in and around the proto-cluster  region at redshift z=3.1	we report the properties of the 35 robust candidates of ly-alpha blobs(labs), which are larger than 16 arcsec^2 in isophotal area and brighter than0.7 x 10^-16 ergs s^-1 cm^-2, searched in and around the proto-cluster regionat redshift z=3.1 discovered by steidel et al. in the ssa22 field, based onwide-field (31'x23') and deep narrow-band (nb497; 4977/77) and broad-band (b,v,and r) images taken with the prime-focus camera on the subaru telescope. thetwo previously known giant labs are the most luminous and the largest ones inour survey volume of 1.3 x 10^5 mpc^3. we revealed the internal structures ofthe two giant labs and discovered some bubble-like features, which suggest thatintensive starburst and galactic superwind phenomena occurred in these objectsin the past. the rest 33 labs have isophotal area of about 16-78 arcsec^2 andflux of 0.7-7 x 10^-16 ergs s^-1 cm^-2. these 35 labs show a continuousdistribution of isophotal area and emission line flux. the distributions ofaverage surface brightness and morphology are widespread from relativelycompact high surface brightness objects to very diffuse low surface brightnessones. the physical origins of these labs may be (i) photo-ionization by massivestars, or active galactic nuclei, or (ii) cooling radiation fromgravitationally heated gas, or (iii) shock heating by starburst driven galacticsuperwind. one third of them are apparently not associated with ultra-violetcontinuum sources that are bright enough to produce ly-alpha emission, assuminga salpeter initial mass function. the 90% of these labs are located inside thehigh surface density region of the 283 relatively compact and strong ly-alphaemitters selected in our previous study. this suggests that these labs may bethe phenomena related to dense environment at high redshift.

astro-ph;9511072	distribution of blue galaxies in a merging cluster of galaxies abell 168	the fraction of star-forming galaxies in rich clusters of galaxies increasesrapidly with the redshift. this is interpreted as the result of a rapidevolution of cluster galaxies, though its mechanism is not yet clear. onehypothesis is that if galaxies run into the dense intracluster medium (icm)regions, starbursts can be induced due to compression of molecular clouds inthe galaxies by a raised "external" icm pressure. in a merging cluster, therewould be dense icm regions and some galaxies may experience a rapid increase ofexternal pressure. thus, if the mechanism works, starbursts would occur in suchgalaxies. such a situation is considered to be realized in coma cluster, andgalaxies showing a recent starburst have a characteristic spatial distribution;they populate an elongated region between two sub-clusters. we examined theabove hypothesis by measuring the spatial distribution of blue galaxies,regarded as star-forming galaxies in abell~168 to check whether a case likecoma is realized in this recently merging cluster. however, we could not findan enhanced blue-galaxy distribution between two sub-clusters. we discuss thecauses of our result, including possibilities of surviving the hypothesis.
