0707.1303	variations in 24 micron morphologies among galaxies in the spitzer  infrared nearby galaxies survey: new insights into the hubble sequence	to study the distribution of star formation and dust emission within nearbygalaxies, we measured five morphological parameters in the 3.6 and 24 micronwave bands for 65 galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings) and 8 galaxies that were serendipitously observed by sings. themorphological parameters demonstrate strong variations along the hubblesequence, including statistically significant differences between s0/a-sab andsc-sd galaxies. early-type galaxies are generally found to be compact,centralized, symmetric sources in the 24 micron band, while late-type galaxiesare generally found to be extended, asymmetric sources. these results suggestthat the processes that increase the real or apparent sizes of galaxies' bulgesalso lead to more centralized 24 micron dust emission. several phenomena, suchas strong nuclear star formation, seyfert activity, or outer ring structures,may cause galaxies to deviate from the general morphological trends observed at24 microns. we also note that the 24 micron morphologies of sdm-im galaxies arequite varied, with some objects appearing very compact and symmetric whileothers appear diffuse and asymmetric. these variations reflect the widevariation in star formation in irregular galaxies as observed at otherwavelengths. the variations in the 24 micron morphological parameters acrossthe hubble sequence mirror many of the morphological trends seen in othertracers of the ism and in stellar emission. however, the 24 micronmorphological parameters for the galaxies in this sample do not match themorphological parameters measured in the stellar wave bands. this implies thatthe distribution of dust emission is related to but not equivalent to thedistribution of stellar emission.

0911.3369	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey iii: comparisons of cold dust,  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, molecular gas, and atomic gas in ngc 2403	we used 3.6, 8.0, 70, 160 micron spitzer space telescope data, james clerkmaxwell telescope harp-b co j=(3-2) data, national radio astronomy observatory12 meter telescope co j=(1-0) data, and very large array hi data to investigatethe relations among pahs, cold (~20 k) dust, molecular gas, and atomic gaswithin ngc 2403, an sabcd galaxy at a distance of 3.13 mpc. the dust surfacedensity is mainly a function of the total (atomic and molecular) gas surfacedensity and galactocentric radius. the gas-to-dust ratio monotonicallyincreases with radius, varying from ~100 in the nucleus to ~400 at 5.5 kpc. theslope of the gas-to-dust ratio is close to that of the oxygen abundance,suggesting that metallicity strongly affects the gas-to-dust ratio within thisgalaxy. the exponential scale length of the radial profile for the co j=(3-2)emission is statistically identical to the scale length for the stellarcontinuum-subtracted 8 micron (pah 8 micron) emission. however, co j=(3-2) andpah 8 micron surface brightnesses appear uncorrelated when examining sub-kpcsized regions.

1001.0980	diffuse far-infrared and ultraviolet emission in the ngc4435/4438  system: tidal stream or galactic cirrus?	we report the discovery of diffuse far-infrared and far-ultraviolet emissionprojected near the interacting pair ngc4435/4438, in the virgo cluster. thisfeature spatially coincides with a well known low surface-brightness opticalplume, usually interpreted as tidal debris. if extragalactic, this stream wouldrepresent not only one of the clearest examples of intracluster dust, but alsoa rare case of intracluster molecular hydrogen and large-scale intraclusterstar formation. however, the ultraviolet, far-infrared, hi and co emission aswell as the dynamics of this feature are extremely unusual for tidal streamsbut are typical of galactic cirrus clouds. in support to the cirrus scenario,we show that a strong spatial correlation between far-infrared andfar-ultraviolet cirrus emission is observed across the center of the virgocluster, over a scale of several degrees. this study demonstrates how dramaticgalactic cirrus contamination can be, even at optical and ultravioletwavelengths and at high galactic latitudes. if ignored, the presence of diffuselight scattered by galactic dust clouds could significantly bias ourinterpretation of low surface-brightness features and diffuse light observedaround galaxies and in clusters of galaxies.

1003.1751	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey ii: warm molecular gas and star  formation in three field spiral galaxies	we present the results of large-area co j=3-2 emission mapping of threenearby field galaxies, ngc 628, ngc 3521, and ngc 3627, completed at the jamesclerk maxwell telescope as part of the nearby galaxies legacy survey. thesegalaxies all have moderate to strong co j=3-2 detections over large areas ofthe fields observed by the survey, showing resolved structure and dynamics intheir warm/dense molecular gas disks. all three galaxies were part of thespitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey sample, and as such have excellentpublished multi-wavelength ancillary data. these data sets allow us to examinethe star formation properties, gas content, and dynamics of these galaxies onsub-kiloparsec scales. we find that the global gas depletion times fordense/warm molecular gas in these galaxies is consistent with other results fornearby spiral galaxies, indicating this may be independent of galaxy propertiessuch as structures, gas compositions, and environments. similar to the resultsfrom the things hi survey, we do not see a correlation of the star formationefficiency with the gas surface density consistent with the schmidt-kennicuttlaw. finally, we find that the star formation efficiency of the dense moleculargas traced by co j=3-2 is potentially flat or slightly declining as a functionof molecular gas density, the co j=3-2/j=1-0 ratio (in contrast to thecorrelation found in a previous study into the starburst galaxy m83), and thefraction of total gas in molecular form.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1005.5073	in-flight calibration of the herschel-spire instrument	spire, the spectral and photometric imaging receiver, is the herschel spaceobservatory's submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m, and an imaging fouriertransform spectrometer (fts) covering 194-671 {\mu}m (447-1550 ghz). in thispaper we describe the initial approach taken to the absolute calibration of thespire instrument using a combination of the emission from the herscheltelescope itself and the modelled continuum emission from solar system objectsand other astronomical targets. we present the photometric, spectroscopic andspatial accuracy that is obtainable in data processed through the "standard"pipelines. the overall photometric accuracy at this stage of the mission isestimated as 15% for the photometer and between 15 and 50% for thespectrometer. however, there remain issues with the photometric accuracy of thespectra of low flux sources in the longest wavelength part of the spirespectrometer band. the spectrometer wavelength accuracy is determined to bebetter than 1/10th of the line fwhm. the astrometric accuracy in spire maps isfound to be 2 arcsec when the latest calibration data are used. the photometriccalibration of the spire instrument is currently determined by a combination ofuncertainties in the model spectra of the astronomical standards and the dataprocessing methods employed for map and spectrum calibration. improvements inprocessing techniques and a better understanding of the instrument performancewill lead to the final calibration accuracy of spire being determined only byuncertainties in the models of astronomical standards.

1008.4058	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey v: the co(j=3-2) distribution and  molecular outflow in ngc~4631	we have made the first map of co(j=3-2) emission covering the disk of theedge-on galaxy, ngc~4631, which is known for its spectacular gaseous halo. thestrongest emission, which we model with a gaussian ring,occurs within a radiusof 5 kpc. weaker disk emission is detected out to radii of 12 kpc, the mostextensive molecular component yet seen in this galaxy. from comparisons withinfrared data, we find that co(j=3-2) emission more closely follows the hotdust component, rather than the cold dust,consistent with it being a goodtracer of star formation. the first maps of $r_{3-2/1-0}$, h$_2$ mass surfacedensity and sfe have been made for the inner 2.4 kpc radius region. only 20\%of the sf occurs in this region and excitation conditions are typical of galaxydisks, rather than of central starbursts. the sfe suggests long gas consumptiontimescales ($&gt;$ $10^9$ yr).  the velocity field is dominated by a steeply rising rotation curve in theregion of the central molecular ring followed by a flatter curve in the disk. avery steep gradient in the rotation curve is observed at the nucleus, providingthe first evidence for a central concentration of mass:m$_{dyn}\,=\,5\,\times\,10^7$ m$_\odot$ within a radius of 282 pc. the velocityfield shows anomalous features indicating the presence of molecular outflows;one of them is associated with a previously observed co(j=1-0) expanding shell.consistent with these outflows is the presence of a thick ($z$ up to $1.4$ kpc)co(j=3-2) disk. we suggest that the interaction between ngc~4631 and itscompanion(s) has agitated the disk and also initiated star formation which waslikely higher in the past than it is now. these may be necessary conditions forseeing prominent halos.

1009.3279	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey iv. velocity dispersions in the  molecular interstellar medium in spiral galaxies	an analysis of large-area co j=3-2 maps from the james clerk maxwelltelescope for 12 nearby spiral galaxies reveals low velocity dispersions in themolecular component of the interstellar medium. the three lowest luminositygalaxies show a relatively flat velocity dispersion as a function of radiuswhile the remaining nine galaxies show a central peak with a radial fall-offwithin 0.2-0.4 r(25). correcting for the average contribution due to theinternal velocitydispersions of a population of giant molecular clouds, theaverage cloud-cloud velocity dispersion across the galactic disks is 6.1 +/-1.0 km/s (standard deviation 2.9 km/s), in reasonable agreement with previousmeasurements for the galaxy andm33. the cloud-cloud velocity dispersion derivedfrom the co data is on average two times smaller than the hi velocitydispersion measured in the same galaxies. the low cloud-cloudvelocitydispersion implies that the molecular gas is the critical component determiningthe stability of the galactic disk against gravitational collapse, especiallyin those regions of the disk which are h2 dominated. the cloud-cloud velocitydispersion shows a significant positivecorrelation with both the far-infraredluminosity, which traces the star formation activity, and the k-band absolutemagnitude, which traces the total stellar mass. for three galaxies in the virgocluster, smoothing the data to a resolution of 4.5 kpc (to match the typicalresolution of high redshift co observations) increases the measured velocitydispersion by roughly a factor of two, comparable to the dispersion measuredrecently in a normal galaxy at z=1. this comparison suggests that the mass andstar formation rate surface densities may be similar in galaxies from z=0-1 andthat the high star formation rates seen at z=1 may be partly due to thepresence of physically larger molecular gas disks.

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

1112.1408	the herschel reference survey: dust in early-type galaxies and across  the hubble sequence	we present herschel observations of 62 early-type galaxies (etgs), including39 galaxies morphologically classified as s0+s0a and 23 galaxies classified asellipticals using spire at 250, 350 and 500 microns (and pacs 100 and 160microns for 19 sources) as part of the volume-limited herschel referencesurvey. we detect dust emission in 24% of the ellipticals and 62% of the s0s.the mean temperature of the dust is 23.9+/-0.8 k, warmer than that found forlate-type galaxies in the virgo cluster. including the non-detections, the meandust mass is log(mdust) = 5.9+/-0.1 and 5.2+/-0.1 msun for the s0s andelliptical galaxies respectively. the mean dust-to-stellar mass islog(mdust/mstar) = -4.4+/-0.1 (s0s) and -5.8+/-0.1 (ellipticals). virtually allthe galaxies lie close to the red sequence yet the large number of detectionsof cool dust, the gas-to-dust ratios and the ratios of far-infrared to radioemission all suggest that many etgs contain a cool interstellar medium similarto that in late-type galaxies. the mean dust-to-stellar mass ratio for s0s isapproximatly a factor of ten less than for early-type spirals and the sizes ofthe dust sources in the s0s are also much smaller. we show that the differencecannot be explained by either the different bulge-to-disk ratios orenvironmental effects such as ram-pressure stripping. the wide range in thedust-to-stellar mass ratio for etgs and the lack of a correlation between dustmass and optical luminosity suggest that much of the dust in the etgs detectedby herschel has been acquired as the result of gravitational interactions;these interactions are unlikely to have had a major effect on the stellarmasses of the etgs. the herschel observations tentatively suggest that in themost massive etgs, the mass of the interstellar medium is unconnected to theevolution of the stellar populations.

1112.3348	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga). i: global  far-infrared and sub-mm morphology	we have obtained herschel images at five wavelengths from 100 to 500 micronof a ~5.5x2.5 degree area centred on the local galaxy m31 (andromeda), ournearest neighbour spiral galaxy, as part of the herschel guaranteed timeproject "helga". the main goals of helga are to study the characteristics ofthe extended dust emission, focusing on larger scales than studied in previousobservations of andromeda at an increased spatial resolution, and the obscuredstar formation. in this paper we present data reduction and herschel maps, andprovide a description of the far-infrared morphology, comparing it withfeatures seen at other wavelengths. we use high--resolution maps of the atomichydrogen, fully covering our fields, to identify dust emission features thatcan be associated to m31 with confidence, distinguishing them from emissioncoming from the foreground galactic cirrus. thanks to the very large extensionof our maps we detect, for the first time at far-infrared wavelengths, threearc-like structures extending out to ~21, ~26 and ~31 kpc respectively, in thesouth-western part of m31. the presence of these features, hosting ~2.2e6 msolof dust, is safely confirmed by their detection in hi maps. overall, weestimate a total dust mass of ~5.8e7 msol, about 78% of which is contained inthe two main ring-like structures at 10 and 15 kpc, at an average temperatureof 16.5 k. we find that the gas-to-dust ratio declines exponentially as afunction of the galacto-centric distance, in agreement with the knownmetallicity gradient, with values ranging from 66 in the nucleus to ~275 in theoutermost region.

1201.2305	fir colours of nearby late-type galaxies in the herschel reference  survey	we study the far infrared (60-500 $\mu$m) colours of late-type galaxies inthe $herschel$ reference survey, a k-band selected, volume limited sample ofnearby galaxies. the far infrared colours are correlated with each other, withtighter correlations for the indices that are closer in wavelength. we alsocompare the different colour indices to various tracers of the physicalproperties of the target galaxies, such as the surface brightness of theionising and non-ionising stellar radiation, the dust attenuation and themetallicity. the emission properties of the cold dust dominating the farinfrared spectral domain are regulated by the properties of the interstellarradiation field. consistent with that observed in nearby, resolved galaxies,our analysis shows that the ionising and the non-ionising stellar radiation,including that emitted by the most evolved, cold stars, both contribute to theheating of the cold dust component. this work also shows that metallicity isanother key parameter characterising the cold dust emission of normal,late-type galaxies. a single modified black body with a grain emissivity index$\beta$=1.5 better fits the observed spire flux density ratios $s250/s350$ vs.$s350/s500$ than $\beta$=2, although values of $\beta$ $\simeq$ 2 are possiblein metal rich, high surface brightness galaxies. values of $\beta$ $\lesssim$1.5 better represent metal poor, low surface brightness objects. thisobservational evidence provides strong constraints for dust emission models ofnormal, late type galaxies.

1201.2405	the irx-beta relation on sub-galactic scales in star-forming galaxies of  the herschel reference survey	uv and optical surveys are essential to gain insight into the processesdriving galaxy formation and evolution. the rest-frame uv emission is key tomeasure the cosmic sfr. however, uv light is strongly reddened by dust. instarburst galaxies, the uv colour and the attenuation are linked, allowing tocorrect for dust extinction. unfortunately, evidence has been accumulating thatthe relation between uv colour and attenuation is different for normalstar-forming galaxies when compared to starburst galaxies. it is still notunderstood why star-forming galaxies deviate from the uv colour-attenuationrelation of starburst galaxies. previous work and models hint that the role ofthe shape of the attenuation curve and the age of stellar populations have animportant role. in this paper we aim at understanding the fundamental reasonsto explain this deviation. we have used the cigale sed fitting code to modelthe far uv to the far ir emission of a set of 7 reasonably face-on spiralgalaxies from the hrs. we have explored the influence of a wide range ofphysical parameters to quantify their influence and impact on the accuratedetermination of the attenuation from the uv colour, and why normal galaxies donot follow the same relation as starburst galaxies. we have found that thedeviation can be best explained by intrinsic uv colour differences betweendifferent regions in galaxies. variations in the shape of the attenuation curvecan also play a secondary role. standard age estimators of the stellarpopulations prove to be poor predictors of the intrinsic uv colour. theseresults are also retrieved on a sample of 58 galaxies when considering theirintegrated fluxes. when correcting the emission of normal star-forming galaxiesfor the attenuation, it is crucial to take into account possible variations inthe intrinsic uv colour as well as variations of the shape of the attenuationcurve.

1201.2762	the dust scaling relations of the herschel reference survey	we combine new herschel/spire sub-millimeter observations with existingmultiwavelength data to investigate the dust scaling relations of the herschelreference survey, a magnitude-, volume-limited sample of ~300 nearby galaxiesin different environments. we show that the dust-to-stellar mass ratioanti-correlates with stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and nuv-rcolour across the whole range of parameters covered by our sample. moreover,the dust-to-stellar mass ratio decreases significantly when moving from late-to early-type galaxies. these scaling relations are similar to those observedfor the hi gas-fraction, supporting the idea that the cold dust is tightlycoupled to the cold atomic gas component in the interstellar medium. we alsofind a weak increase of the dust-to-hi mass ratio with stellar mass and colourbut no trend is seen with stellar mass surface density. by comparing galaxiesin different environments we show that, although these scaling relations arefollowed by both cluster and field galaxies, hi-deficient systems have, atfixed stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and morphological typesystematically lower dust-to-stellar mass and higher dust-to-hi mass ratiosthan hi-normal/field galaxies. this provides clear evidence that dust isremoved from the star-forming disk of cluster galaxies but the effect of theenvironment is less strong than what is observed in the case of the hi disk.such effects naturally arise if the dust disk is less extended than the hi andfollows more closely the distribution of the molecular gas phase, i.e., if thedust-to-atomic gas ratio monotonically decreases with distance from thegalactic center.

1204.0785	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga) ii: dust and  gas in andromeda	we present an analysis of the dust and gas in andromeda, using herschelimages sampling the entire far-infrared peak. we fit a modified-blackbody modelto ~4000 quasi-independent pixels with spatial resolution of ~140pc and findthat a variable dust-emissivity index (beta) is required to fit the data. wefind no significant long-wavelength excess above this model suggesting there isno cold dust component. we show that the gas-to-dust ratio varies radially,increasing from ~20 in the center to ~70 in the star-forming ring at 10kpc,consistent with the metallicity gradient. in the 10kpc ring the average beta is~1.9, in good agreement with values determined for the milky way (mw). however,in contrast to the mw, we find significant radial variations in beta, whichincreases from 1.9 at 10kpc to ~2.5 at a radius of 3.1kpc and then decreases to1.7 in the center. the dust temperature is fairly constant in the 10kpc ring(ranging from 17-20k), but increases strongly in the bulge to ~30k. within3.1kpc we find the dust temperature is highly correlated with the 3.6 micronflux, suggesting the general stellar population in the bulge is the dominantsource of dust heating there. at larger radii, there is a weak correlationbetween the star formation rate and dust temperature. we find no evidence for'dark gas' in m31 in contrast to recent results for the mw. finally, weobtained an estimate of the co x-factor by minimising the dispersion in thegas-to-dust ratio, obtaining a value of (1.9+/-0.4)x10^20 cm^-2 [k kms^-1]^-1.

1206.1629	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey viii. co data and the  l(co3-2)-l(fir) correlation in the sings sample	the james clerk maxwell telescope nearby galaxies legacy survey (ngls)comprises an hi-selected sample of 155 galaxies spanning all morphologicaltypes with distances less than 25 mpc. we describe the scientific goals of thesurvey, the sample selection, and the observing strategy. we also present anatlas and analysis of the co j=3-2 maps for the 47 galaxies in the ngls whichare also part of the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey. we find a widerange of molecular gas mass fractions in the galaxies in this sample andexplore the correlation of the far-infrared luminosity, which traces starformation, with the co luminosity, which traces the molecular gas mass. bycomparing the ngls data with merging galaxies at low and high redshift whichhave also been observed in the co j=3-2 line, we show that the correlation offar-infrared and co luminosity shows a significant trend with luminosity. thistrend is consistent with a molecular gas depletion time which is more than anorder of magnitude faster in the merger galaxies than in nearby normalgalaxies. we also find a strong correlation of the l(fir)/l(co3-2) ratio withthe atomic to molecular gas mass ratio. this correlation suggests that some ofthe far-infrared emission originates from dust associated with atomic gas andthat its contribution is particularly important in galaxies where most of thegas is in the atomic phase.

1209.4651	the herschel virgo cluster survey xii: fir properties of  optically-selected virgo cluster galaxies	the herschel virgo cluster survey (hevics) is the deepest, confusion-limitedsurvey of the virgo cluster at far-infrared (fir) wavelengths. the entiresurvey at full depth covers $\sim$55 sq. deg. in 5 bands (100-500 \micron),encompassing the areas around the central dominant elliptical galaxies (m87,m86 &amp; m49) and extends as far as the nw cloud, the w cloud and the southernextension. the survey extends beyond this region with lower sensitivity so thatthe total area covered is 84 sq. deg. in this paper we describe the data, thedata acquisition techniques and present the detection rates of the opticallyselected virgo cluster catalogue (vcc). we detect 254 (34%) of 750 vcc galaxiesfound within the survey boundary in at least one band and 171 galaxies aredetected in all five bands. for the remainder of the galaxies we have measuredstrict upper limits for their fir emission. the population of detected galaxiescontains early- as well as late-types although the latter dominate thedetection statistics. we have modelled 168 galaxies, showing no evidence of astrong synchrotron component in their fir spectra, using a single-temperaturemodified blackbody spectrum with a fixed emissivity index ($\beta = 2$). astudy of the $\chi^2$ distribution indicates that this model is not appropriatein all cases, and this is supported by the fir colours which indicate a spreadin $\beta$=1--2. statistical comparison of the dust mass and temperaturedistributions from 140 galaxies with $\chi^2_{dof=3} &lt; 7.8$ (95% confidencelevel) shows that late-types have typically colder, more massive dustreservoirs; the early-type dust masses have a mean of ${\rm log}(&lt;m&gt; /m_{\sun}) = 6.3 \pm 0.3 $, while for late-types ${\rm log}(&lt;m&gt; / m_{\sun}) =7.1\pm 0.1$...

1306.1217	flux calibration of the herschel-spire photometer	we describe the procedure used to flux calibrate the three-band submillimetrephotometer in the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire) instrumenton the herschel space observatory. this includes the equations describing thecalibration scheme, a justification for using neptune as the primarycalibration source, a description of the observations and data processingprocedures used to derive flux calibration parameters (for converting fromvoltage to flux density) for every bolometer in each array, an analysis of theerror budget in the flux calibration for the individual bolometers, and testsof the flux calibration on observations of primary and secondary calibrators.the procedure for deriving the flux calibration parameters is divided into twoparts. in the first part, we use observations of astronomical sources inconjunction with the operation of the photometer internal calibration source toderive the unscaled derivatives of the flux calibration curves. to scale thecalibration curves in jy/beam/v, we then use observations of neptune in whichthe beam of each bolometer is mapped using neptune observed in a very fine scanpattern. the total instrumental uncertainties in the flux calibration for theindividual bolometers is ~0.5% for most bolometers, although a few bolometershave uncertainties of ~1-5% because of issues with the neptune observations.based on application of the flux calibration parameters to neptune observationsperformed using typical scan map observing modes, we determined thatmeasurements from each array as a whole have instrumental uncertainties of1.5%. this is considerably less than the absolute calibration uncertaintyassociated with the model of neptune, which is estimated at 4%.

1308.4406	herschel-atlas: correlations between dust and gas in local  submm-selected galaxies	we present an analysis of co molecular gas tracers in a sample of500{\mu}m-selected herschel-atlas galaxies at z&lt;0.05 (cz&lt;14990km/s). using22-500{\mu}m photometry from wise, iras and herschel, with hi data from theliterature, we investigate correlations between warm and cold dust, and tracersof the gas in different phases. the correlation between global co(3-2) linefluxes and fir-submillimetre fluxes weakens with increasing ir wavelength({\lambda}&gt;60{\mu}m), as a result of colder dust being less strongly associatedwith dense gas. conversely, co(2-1) and hi line fluxes both appear to be bettercorrelated with longer wavelengths, suggesting that cold dust is more stronglyassociated with diffuse atomic and molecular gas phases, consistent with itbeing at least partially heated by radiation from old stellar populations. theincreased scatter at long wavelengths implies that submillimetre fluxes are apoorer tracer of sfr. fluxes at 22 and 60{\mu}m are also better correlated withdiffuse gas tracers than dense co(3-2), probably due to very-small-grainemission in the diffuse interstellar medium, which is not correlated with sfr.the fir/co luminosity ratio and the dust mass/co luminosity ratio both decreasewith increasing luminosity, as a result of either correlations between mass andmetallicity (changing co/h2) or between co luminosity and excitation [changingco(3-2)/co(1-0)].

1309.1371	revealing the cold dust in low-metallicity environments: i - photometry  analysis of the dwarf galaxy survey with herschel	we present new photometric data from our herschel key programme, the dwarfgalaxy survey (dgs), dedicated to the observation of the gas and dust in 48low-metallicity environments. they were observed with pacs and spire onboardherschel at 70,100,160,250,350, and 500 microns. we focus on a systematiccomparison of the derived fir properties (fir luminosity, dust mass, dusttemperature and emissivity index) with more metal-rich galaxies and investigatethe detection of a potential submm excess. the data reduction method is adaptedfor each galaxy to derive the most reliable photometry from the final maps.pacs flux densities are compared with the mips 70 and 160 microns bands. we usecolour-colour diagrams and modified blackbody fitting procedures to determinethe dust properties of the dgs galaxies. we also include galaxies from theherschel kingfish sample, containing more metal-rich environments, totalling109 galaxies. the location of the dgs galaxies on herschel colour-colourdiagrams highlights the differences in global environments of low-metallicitygalaxies. the dust in dgs galaxies is generally warmer than in kingfishgalaxies (t_dgs~32 k, t_kingfish~23 k). the emissivity index, beta, is ~1.7 inthe dgs, but metallicity does not make a strong effect on beta. thedust-to-stellar mass ratio is lower in low-metallicity galaxies:m_dust/m_star~0.02% for the dgs vs 0.1% for kingfish. per unit dust mass, dwarfgalaxies emit ~6 times more in the fir than higher metallicity galaxies. out ofthe 22 dgs galaxies detected at 500 micron, 41% present an excess in the submmnot explained by our dust sed model. the excess mainly appears in lowermetallicity galaxies (12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.3), and the strongest excesses aredetected in the most metal-poor galaxies. we stress the need for observationslongwards of the herschel wavelengths to detect any submm excess appearingbeyond 500 micron.

1311.1774	the herschel virgo cluster survey xvi: a cluster inventory	herschel fir observations are used to construct virgo cluster galaxyluminosity functions and to show that the cluster lacks the very bright and thenumerous faint sources detected in field galaxy surveys. the far-infrared sedsare fitted to obtain dust masses and temperatures and the dust mass function.the cluster is over dense in dust by about a factor of 100 compared to thefield. the same emissivity (beta) temperature relation applies for differentgalaxies as that found for different regions of m31. we use optical and hi datato show that virgo is over dense in stars and atomic gas by about a factor of100 and 20 respectively. metallicity values are used to measure the mass ofmetals in the gas phase. the mean metallicity is about 0.7 solar and 50% of themetals are in the dust. for the cluster as a whole the mass density of stars ingalaxies is 8 times that of the gas and the gas mass density is 130 times thatof the metals. we use our data to consider the chemical evolution of theindividual galaxies, inferring that the measured variations in effective yieldare due to galaxies having different ages, being affected to varying degrees bygas loss. four galaxy scaling relations are considered: mass-metallicity,mass-velocity, mass-star formation rate and mass-radius - we suggest thatinitial galaxy mass is the prime driver of a galaxy's ultimate destiny.finally, we use x-ray observations and galaxy dynamics to assess the dark andbaryonic matter content compared to the cosmological model.

1312.3442	gas-to-dust mass ratios in local galaxies over a 2 dex metallicity range	this paper analyses the behaviour of the gas-to-dust mass ratio (g/d) oflocal universe galaxies over a large metallicity range. we combine threesamples: the dwarf galaxy survey, the kingfish survey and a subsample fromgalametz et al. (2011) totalling 126 galaxies, covering a 2 dex metallicityrange, with 30% of the sample with 12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.0. the dust masses arehomogeneously determined with a semi-empirical dust model, including submmconstraints. the atomic and molecular gas masses are compiled from theliterature. two xco are used to estimate molecular gas masses: the galacticxco, and a xco depending on the metallicity (as z^{-2}). correlations withmorphological types, stellar masses, star formation rates and specific starformation rates are discussed. the trend between g/d and metallicity isempirically modelled using power-laws (slope of -1 and free) and a brokenpower-law. we compare the evolution of the g/d with predictions from chemicalevolution models. we find that out of the five tested galactic parameters,metallicity is the galactic property driving the observed g/d. the g/d versusmetallicity relation cannot be represented by a power-law with a slope of -1over the whole metallicity range. the observed trend is steeper formetallicities lower than ~ 8.0. a large scatter is observed in the g/d for agiven metallicity, with a dispersion of 0.37 dex in metallicity bins of ~0.1dex. the broken power-law reproduces best the observed g/d and providesestimates of the g/d that are accurate to a factor of 1.6. the good agreementof the g/d and its scatter with the three tested chemical evolution modelsshows that the scatter is intrinsic to galactic properties, reflecting thedifferent star formation histories, dust destruction efficiencies, dust grainsize distributions and chemical compositions across the sample.

1402.3597	dust spectral energy distributions of nearby galaxies: an insight from  the herschel reference survey	we gather infrared (ir) photometric data from 8 to 500 microns (spitzer,wise, iras and herschel) for all of the hrs galaxies. draine &amp; li (2007) modelsare fit to the data from which the stellar contribution has been carefullyremoved. we find that our photometric coverage is sufficient to constrain allof the models parameters and that a strong constraint on the 20-60 micronsrange is mandatory to estimate the relative contribution of thephoto-dissociation regions to the ir sed. the sed models tend to systematicallyunder-estimate the observed 500 microns flux densities, especially for low masssystems. we provide the output parameters for all of the galaxies: the minimumintensity of the interstellar radiation field (isrf), the fraction of pah, therelative contribution of pdr and evolved stellar population to the dustheating, the $m_{dust}$ and the $l_{ir}$. for a subsample of gas-rich galaxies,we analyze the relations between these parameters and the integrated propertiesof galaxies, such as $m_*$, sfr, metallicity, h$\alpha$ and h-band surfacebrightness, and the fuv attenuation. a good correlation between the fraction ofpah and the metallicity is found implying a weakening of the pah emission ingalaxies with low metallicities. the intensity of the irsf and the h-band andh$\alpha$ surface brightnesses are correlated, suggesting that the diffuse dustcomponent is heated by both the young stars in star forming regions and thediffuse evolved population. we use these results to provide a new set of irtemplates calibrated with herschel observations on nearby galaxies and a meansed template to provide the z=0 reference for cosmological studies. for thesame purpose, we put our sample on the sfr-$m_*$ diagram. the templates arecompared to the most popular ir sed libraries, enlightening a large discrepancybetween all of them in the 20-100 microns range.

1402.4524	pacs photometry of the herschel reference survey -  far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours as tracers of dust properties in nearby  galaxies	we present herschel/pacs 100 and 160 micron integrated photometry for the 323galaxies in the herschel reference survey (hrs), a k-band-, volume-limitedsample of galaxies in the local universe. once combined with the herschel/spireobservations already available, these data make the hrs the largestrepresentative sample of nearby galaxies with homogeneous coverage across the100-500 micron wavelength range. in this paper, we take advantage of thisunique dataset to investigate the properties and shape of thefar-infrared/sub-millimeter spectral energy distribution in nearby galaxies. weshow that, in the stellar mass range covered by the hrs (8&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;12),the far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours are inconsistent with a single modifiedblack-body having the same dust emissivity index beta for all galaxies. inparticular, either beta decreases, or multiple temperature components areneeded, when moving from metal-rich/gas-poor to metal-poor/gas-rich galaxies.we thus investigate how the dust temperature and mass obtained from a singlemodified black-body depend on the assumptions made on beta. we show that, whilethe correlations between dust temperature, galaxy structure and star formationrate are strongly model dependent, the dust mass scaling relations are muchmore reliable, and variations of beta only change the strength of the observedtrends.

1402.5967	a resolved analysis of cold dust and gas in the nearby edge-on spiral  ngc 891	we investigate the connection between dust and gas in the nearby edge-onspiral galaxy ngc 891. high resolution herschel pacs and spire 70, 100, 160,250, 350, and 500 $\mu$m images are combined with jcmt scuba 850 $\mu$mobservations to trace the far-infrared/submillimetre spectral energydistribution (sed). maps of the hi 21 cm line and co(j=3-2) emission trace theatomic and molecular hydrogen gas, respectively. we fit one-component modifiedblackbody models to the integrated sed, finding a global dust mass of8.5$\times$10$^{7}$ m$_{\odot}$ and an average temperature of 23$\pm$2 k. wealso fit the pixel-by-pixel seds to produce maps of the dust mass andtemperature. the dust mass distribution correlates with the total stellarpopulation as traced by the 3.6 $\mu$m emission. the derived dust temperature,which ranges from approximately 17 to 24 k, is found to correlate with the 24$\mu$m emission. allowing the dust emissivity index to vary, we find an averagevalue of $\beta$ = 1.9$\pm$0.3. we confirm an inverse relation between the dustemissivity spectral index and dust temperature, but do not observe anyvariation of this relationship with vertical height from the mid-plane of thedisk. a comparison of the dust properties with the gaseous components of theism reveals strong spatial correlations between the surface mass densities ofdust and the molecular hydrogen and total gas surface densities. observedasymmetries in the dust temperature, and the h$_{2}$-to-dust and totalgas-to-dust ratios hint that an enhancement in the star formation rate may bethe result of larger quantities of molecular gas available to fuel starformation in the ne compared to the sw. whilst the asymmetry likely arises fromdust obscuration due to the geometry of the line-of-sight projection of thespiral arms, we cannot exclude an enhancement in the star formation rate in thene side of the disk.

1403.1107	calibration of the herschel spire fourier transform spectrometer	the herschel spire instrument consists of an imaging photometric camera andan imaging fourier transform spectrometer (fts), both operating over afrequency range of 450-1550 ghz. in this paper, we briefly review the ftsdesign, operation, and data reduction, and describe in detail the approachtaken to relative calibration (removal of instrument signatures) and absolutecalibration against standard astronomical sources. the calibration schemeassumes a spatially extended source and uses the herschel telescope as primarycalibrator. conversion from extended to point-source calibration is carried outusing observations of the planet uranus. the model of the telescope emission isshown to be accurate to within 6% and repeatable to better than 0.06% and, bycomparison with models of mars and neptune, the uranus model is shown to beaccurate to within 3%. multiple observations of a number of point-like sourcesshow that the repeatability of the calibration is better than 1%, if theeffects of the satellite absolute pointing error (ape) are corrected. thesatellite ape leads to a decrement in the derived flux, which can be up to ~10%(1 sigma) at the high-frequency end of the spire range in the first part of themission, and ~4% after herschel operational day 1011. the lower frequency rangeof the spire band is unaffected by this pointing error due to the larger beamsize. overall, for well-pointed, point-like sources, the absolute fluxcalibration is better than 6%, and for extended sources where mapping isrequired it is better than 7%.

1407.5452	planck intermediate results. xxv. the andromeda galaxy as seen by planck	the andromeda galaxy (m31) is one of a few galaxies that has sufficientangular size on the sky to be resolved by the planck satellite. planck hasdetected m31 in all of its frequency bands, and has mapped out the dustemission with the high frequency instrument, clearly resolving multiple spiralarms and sub-features. we examine the morphology of this long-wavelength dustemission as seen by planck, including a study of its outermost spiral arms, andinvestigate the dust heating mechanism across m31. we find that dust dominatingthe longer wavelength emission ($\gtrsim 0.3\,$mm) is heated by the diffusestellar population (as traced by 3.6$\,\mu$m emission), with the dustdominating the shorter wavelength emission heated by a mix of the old stellarpopulation and star-forming regions (as traced by 24$\,\mu$m emission). we alsofit spectral energy distributions (seds) for individual 5' pixels and quantifythe dust properties across the galaxy, taking into account these differentheating mechanisms, finding that there is a linear decrease in temperature withgalactocentric distance for dust heated by the old stellar population, as wouldbe expected, with temperatures ranging from around 22$\,$k in the nucleus to14$\,$k outside of the 10$\,$kpc ring. finally, we measure the integratedspectrum of the whole galaxy, which we find to be well-fitted with a globaldust temperature of ($18.2\pm1.0$)$\,$k with a spectral index of $1.62\pm0.11$(assuming a single modified blackbody), and a significant amount of free-freeemission at intermediate frequencies of 20-60$\,$ghz, which corresponds to astar formation rate of around $0.12$m$_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. we find a$2.3\,\sigma$ detection of the presence of spinning dust emission, with a30$\,$ghz amplitude of $0.7\pm0.3\,$jy, which is in line with expectations fromour galaxy.

1409.1815	the identification of dust heating mechanisms in nearby galaxies using  herschel 160/250 and 250/350 micron surface brightness ratios	we examined variations in the 160/250 and 250/350 micron surface brightnessratios within 24 nearby (&lt;30 mpc) face-on spiral galaxies observed with theherschel space observatory to identify the heating mechanisms for dust emittingat these wavelengths. the analysis consisted of both qualitative andquantitative comparisons of the 160/250 and 250/350 micron ratios to h alphaand 24 micron surface brightnesses, which trace the light from star formingregions, and 3.6 micron emission, which traces the light from the older stellarpopulations of the galaxies. we find broad variations in the heating mechanismsfor the dust. in one subset of galaxies, we found evidence that emission at&lt;=160 microns (and in rare cases potentially at &lt;=350 microns) originates fromdust heated by star forming regions. in another subset, we found that theemission at &gt;=250 microns (and sometimes at &gt;=160 microns) originates from dustheated by the older stellar population. in the rest of the sample, either theresults are indeterminate or both of these stellar populations may contributeequally to the global dust heating. the observed variations in dust heatingmechanisms does not necessarily match what has been predicted by dust emissionand radiative transfer models, which could lead to overestimated dusttemperatures, underestimated dust masses, false detections of variability indust emissivity, and inaccurate star formation rate measurements.

1410.3874	quantifying the heating sources for mid-infrared dust emissions in  galaxies: the case of m 81	with the newly available spire images at 250 and 500 micron from herschelspace observatory, we study quantitative correlations over a sub-kpc scaleamong three distinct emission components in the interstellar medium of thenearby spiral galaxy m 81 (ngc 3031): (a) $i_{8}$ or $i_{24}$, the surfacebrightness of the mid-infrared emission observed in the spitzer irac 8 or mips24 micron band, with $i_8$ and $i_{24}$ being dominated by the emissions frompolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and very small grains (vsgs) of dust,respectively; (b) $i_{500}$, that of the cold dust continuum emission in theherschel spire 500 micron band, dominated by the emission from large dustgrains heated by evolved stars, and (c) $i_{{\rm h}\alpha}$, a nominal surfacebrightness of the h$\alpha$ line emission, from gas ionized by newly formedmassive stars. the results from our correlation study, free from any assumptionon or modeling of dust emissivity law or dust temperatures, present solidevidence for significant heating of pahs and vsgs by evolved stars. in the caseof m 81, about 67% (48%) of the 8 micron (24 micron) emission derives itsheating from evolved stars, with the remainder attributed to radiation heatingassociated with ionizing stars.

1410.6156	insights into gas heating and cooling in the disc of ngc 891 from  herschel far-infrared spectroscopy	we present herschel pacs and spire spectroscopy of the most importantfar-infrared cooling lines in the nearby edge-on spiral galaxy, ngc 891: [cii]158 $\mu$m, [nii] 122, 205 $\mu$m, [oi] 63, 145 $\mu$m, and [oiii] 88 $\mu$m.we find that the photoelectric heating efficiency of the gas, traced via the([cii]+[oii]63)/$f_{\mathrm{tir}}$ ratio, varies from a mean of3.5$\times$10$^{-3}$ in the centre up to 8$\times$10$^{-3}$ at increasingradial and vertical distances in the disc. a decrease in([cii]+[oii]63)/$f_{\mathrm{tir}}$ but constant([cii]+[oi]63)/$f_{\mathrm{pah}}$ with increasing fir colour suggests thatpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) may become important for gas heating inthe central regions. we compare the observed flux of the fir cooling lines andtotal ir emission with the predicted flux from a pdr model to determine the gasdensity, surface temperature and the strength of the incident far-ultraviolet(fuv) radiation field, $g_{0}$. resolving details on physical scales of ~0.6kpc, a pixel-by-pixel analysis reveals that the majority of the pdrs in ngc891's disc have hydrogen densities of 1 &lt; log ($n$/cm$^{-3}$) &lt; 3.5experiencing an incident fuv radiation field with strengths of 1.7 &lt; log $g_0$&lt; 3. although these values we derive for most of the disc are consistent withthe gas properties found in pdrs in the spiral arms and inter-arm regions ofm51, observed radial trends in $n$ and $g_0$ are shown to be sensitive tovarying optical thickness in the lines, demonstrating the importance ofaccurately accounting for optical depth effects when interpreting observationsof high inclination systems. with an empirical relationship between the mips 24$\mu$m and [nii] 205 $\mu$m emission, we estimate an enhancement of the fuvradiation field strength in the far north-eastern side of the disc.

1411.3960	the herschel virgo cluster survey. xviii. star-forming dwarf galaxies in  a cluster environment	to assess the effects of the cluster environment on the different componentsof the interstellar medium, we analyse the fir-submm properties of a sample ofstar-forming dwarf (sfd) galaxies detected by the herschel virgo cluster survey(hevics). we determine dust masses and dust temperatures by fitting a modifiedblack body (mbb) function to the spectral energy distributions (seds). stellarand gas masses, star formation rates (sfrs), and metallicities are obtainedfrom the analysis of a set of ancillary data. dust is detected in 49 out of 140optically identified dwarfs covered by the hevics field; considering onlydwarfs brighter than $m_b$ = 18 mag, this gives a detection rate of 43%. afterevaluating different emissivity indices, we find that the fir-submm seds arebest-fit by $\beta$=1.5, with a median dust temperature $t_d$ = 22.4 k.assuming $\beta$=1.5, 67% of the 23 galaxies detected in all five herschelbands show emission at 500 $\mu$m in excess of the mbb model. the excess isinversely correlated with sfr and stellar masses. to study the variations inthe global properties of our sample due to environmental effects, we comparethe virgo sfds to other herschel surveys, such as kingfish, the dwarf galaxysurvey (dgs), and the hevics bright galaxy catalogue (bgc). we explore therelations between stellar mass and hi fraction, specific sfr, dust fraction,gas-to-dust ratio over a wide range of stellar masses. highly hi-deficientvirgo dwarf galaxies are mostly characterised by quenched star formationactivity and lower dust fractions giving hints for dust stripping in clusterdwarfs. however, we find that the fraction of dust removed has to be less thanthat of the hi component. since the virgo sfds are likely to be crossing thecluster for the first time, a longer timescale might be necessary to strip themore centrally concentrated dust distribution.

1412.7344	the relationship between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission and  far-infrared dust emission from ngc 2403 and m83	we examine the relation between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah)emission at 8 microns and far-infrared emission from hot dust grains at 24microns and from large dust grains at 160 and 250 microns in the nearby spiralgalaxies ngc 2403 and m83 using data from the spitzer space telescope andherschel space observatory. we find that the pah emission in ngc 2403 is bettercorrelated with emission at 250 microns from dust heated by the diffuseinterstellar radiation field (isrf) and that the 8/250 micron surfacebrightness ratio is well-correlated with the stellar surface brightness asmeasured at 3.6 microns. this implies that the pahs in ngc 2403 are intermixedwith cold large dust grains in the diffuse interstellar medium (ism) and thatthe pahs are excited by the diffuse isrf. in m83, the pah emission appears morestrongly correlated with 160 micron emission originating from large dust grainsheated by star forming regions. however, the pah emission in m83 is low wherethe 24 micron emission peaks within star forming regions, and enhancements inthe 8/160 micron surface brightness ratios appear offset relative to the dustand the star forming regions within the spiral arms. this suggests that thepahs observed in the 8 micron band are not excited locally within star formingregions but either by light escaping non-axisymmetrically from star formingregions or locally by young, non-photoionising stars that have migrateddownstream from the spiral density waves. the results from just these twogalaxies show that pahs may be excited by different stellar populations indifferent spiral galaxies.

1505.03150	ngc4370: a case study for testing our ability to infer dust distribution  and mass in nearby galaxies	a fraction of the early-type galaxy population hosts a prominent dust lane.methods to quantify the dust content of these systems based on optical imagingdata usually yield dust masses which are an order of magnitude lower than dustmasses derived from the observed fir emission. high-quality optical data fromthe next generation virgo cluster survey (ngvs) and fir/submm observations fromthe herschel virgo cluster survey (hevics) allow us to revisit previous methodsto determine the dust content in galaxies and explore new ones. we aim toderive the dust mass in ngc 4370 from both optical and fir data, andinvestigate the need to invoke a putative diffuse dust component. we createcolor and attenuation maps, which are converted to approximate dust mass mapsbased on simple dust geometries. dust masses are also derived from sed fits tofir/submm observations. finally, inverse radiative transfer fitting isperformed to investigate more complex dust geometries. the empirical methodsapplied to the optical data yield lower limits of 3.4e5 solar masses, an orderof magnitude below the total dust masses derived from sed fitting. in contrast,radiative transfer models yield dust masses which are slightly lower, but fullyconsistent with the fir-derived mass. dust is more likely to be distributed ina ring around the centre of ngc 4370 as opposed to an exponential disc or asimple foreground screen. moreover, using inverse radiative transfer fitting,we are able to constrain most of the parameters describing these geometries.the resulting dust masses are high enough to account for the dust observed atfir/submm wavelengths, so that no diffuse dust component needs to be invoked.we furthermore caution for the interpretation of dust masses and optical depthsbased on optical data alone, using overly simplistic star-dust geometries andthe neglect of scattering effects.

1507.05432	linking dust emission to fundamental properties in galaxies: the  low-metallicity picture	in this work, we aim at providing a consistent analysis of the dustproperties from metal-poor to metal-rich environments by linking them tofundamental galactic parameters. we consider two samples of galaxies: the dwarfgalaxy survey (dgs) and kingfish, totalling 109 galaxies, spanning almost 2 dexin metallicity. we collect infrared (ir) to submillimetre (submm) data for bothsamples and present the complete data set for the dgs sample. we model theobserved spectral energy distributions (sed) with a physically-motivated dustmodel to access the dust properties. using a different sed model (modifiedblackbody), dust composition (amorphous carbon), or wavelength coverage atsubmm wavelengths results in differences in the dust mass estimate of a factortwo to three, showing that this parameter is subject to non-negligiblesystematic modelling uncertainties. for eight galaxies in our sample, we find arather small excess at 500 microns (&lt; 1.5 sigma). we find that the dust sed oflow-metallicity galaxies is broader and peaks at shorter wavelengths comparedto more metal-rich systems, a sign of a clumpier medium in dwarf galaxies. thepah mass fraction and the dust temperature distribution are found to be drivenmostly by the specific star-formation rate, ssfr, with secondary effects frommetallicity. the correlations between metallicity and dust mass or total-irluminosity are direct consequences of the stellar mass-metallicity relation.the dust-to-stellar mass ratios of metal-rich sources follow the well-studiedtrend of decreasing ratio for decreasing ssfr. the relation is more complex forhighly star-forming low-metallicity galaxies and depends on the chemicalevolutionary stage of the source (i.e., gas-to-dust mass ratio). dust growthprocesses in the ism play a key role in the dust mass build-up with respect tothe stellar content at high ssfr and low metallicity.

astro-ph;0604267	the opaque nascent starburst in ngc 1377: spitzer sings observations	we analyze extensive data on ngc1377 from the spitzer infrared nearbygalaxies survey (sings). within the category of nascent starbursts, that wepreviously selected by their infrared to radio continuum ratios in large excessof the average and their hot dust, ngc1377 has the largest infrared excess yetmeasured. optical imaging reveals a morphological distortion suggestive of arecent accretion event. infrared spectroscopy reveals a compact and opaquesource dominated by a hot, self-absorbed continuum (tau ~ 20 in the 10 micronsilicate band). we provide physical evidence against non-stellar activity beingthe heating source. hii regions are detected through the single [neii] line,probing &lt;1% of the ionizing radiation. not only is the optical depth very high,but &gt;85% of ionizing photons are suppressed by dust. the only other detectedemission features are molecular hydrogen lines, arguably excited mainly byshocks, besides photodissociation regions, and weak aromatic bands. the newobservations support our interpretation in terms of an extremely youngstarburst (&lt;1 myr). more generally, galaxies deficient in radio synchrotron arelikely observed within a few myr of the onset of a starburst and after a longquiescence, prior to the replenishment of the ism with cosmic rays. the similarinfrared-radio properties of ngc1377 and some infrared-luminous galaxiessuggest that ngc1377 constitutes an archetype to better understand starburstevolution. although rare locally because observed in a brief evolutionarystage, nascent starbursts may represent a non-negligible fraction ofmerger-induced starbursts dominating deep infrared counts. since they differdramatically from usual starburst templates, they bear important consequencesfor the interpretation of deep surveys.

astro-ph;0610913	the mid-infrared spectrum of star-forming galaxies: global properties of  pah emission	we present a sample of low-resolution 5-38um spitzer irs spectra of the innerfew square kiloparsecs of 59 nearby galaxies spanning a large range of starformation properties. a robust method for decomposing mid-infrared galaxyspectra is described, and used to explore the behavior of pah emission and theprevalence of silicate dust extinction. evidence for silicate extinction isfound in ~1/8 of the sample, at strengths which indicate most normal galaxiesundergo a_v &lt; ~3 magnitudes averaged over their centers. the contribution ofpah emission to the total infrared power is found to peak near 10% and extendup to ~20%, and is suppressed at metallicities z &lt; ~z_sun/4, as well as inlow-luminosity agn environments. strong inter-band pah feature strengthvariations (2-5x) are observed, with the presence of a weak agn and, to alesser degree, increasing metallicity shifting power to the longer wavelengthbands. a peculiar pah emission spectrum with markedly diminished 5-8um featuresarises among the sample solely in systems with relatively hard radiation fieldsharboring low-luminosity agn. the agn may modify the emitting graindistribution and provide the direct excitation source of the unusual pahemission, which cautions against using absolute pah strength to estimate starformation rates in systems harboring active nuclei. alternatively, the low starformation intensity often associated with weak agn may affect the spectrum. theeffect of variations in the mid-infrared spectrum on broadband infrared surveysis modeled, and points to more than a factor of two uncertainty in resultswhich assume a fixed pah emission spectrum, for redshifts z=0-2.5.
