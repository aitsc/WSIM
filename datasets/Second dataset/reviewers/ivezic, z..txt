0909.0013	the milky way tomography with sdss: iii. stellar kinematics	we study milky way kinematics using a sample of 18.8 million main-sequencestars with r&lt;20 and proper-motion measurements derived from sdss and possastrometry, including ~170,000 stars with radial-velocity measurements from thesdss spectroscopic survey. distances to stars are determined using aphotometric parallax relation, covering a distance range from ~100 pc to 10 kpcover a quarter of the sky at high galactic latitudes (|b|&gt;20 degrees). we findthat in the region defined by 1 kpc &lt;z&lt; 5 kpc and 3 kpc &lt;r&lt; 13 kpc, therotational velocity for disk stars smoothly decreases, and all three componentsof the velocity dispersion increase, with distance from the galactic plane. incontrast, the velocity ellipsoid for halo stars is aligned with a sphericalcoordinate system and appears to be spatially invariant within the probedvolume. the velocity distribution of nearby ($z&lt;1$ kpc) k/m stars is complex,and cannot be described by a standard schwarzschild ellipsoid. for stars in adistance-limited subsample of stars (&lt;100 pc), we detect a multimodal velocitydistribution consistent with that seen by hipparcos. this strongnon-gaussianity significantly affects the measurements of the velocityellipsoid tilt and vertex deviation when using the schwarzschild approximation.we develop and test a simple descriptive model for the overall kinematicbehavior that captures these features over most of the probed volume, and canbe used to search for substructure in kinematic and metallicity space. we usethis model to predict further improvements in kinematic mapping of the galaxyexpected from gaia and lsst.

0708.2661	improved photometry of sdss crowded field images: structure and dark  matter content in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy leo i	we explore how well crowded field point-source photometry can be accomplishedwith sdss data: we present a photometric pipeline based on dophot, and tunedfor analyzing crowded-field images from the sdss. using monte carlo simulationswe show that the completeness of source extraction is above 80% to i &lt; 21 (ab)and a stellar surface density of about 200 sq.amin. hence, a specialized datapipeline can efficiently be used for e.g. nearby resolved galaxies in sdssimages, where the standard sdss photometric package photo, when applied innormal survey mode, gives poor results. we apply our pipeline to an area ofabout 3.55sq.deg. around the dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dsph) leo i, andconstruct a high s/n star-count map of leo i via an optimized filter incolor-magnitude space (g,r,i). although the radial surface-density profile ofthe dwarf deviates from the best fit empirical king model towards outer radii,we find no evidence for tidal debris out to a stellar surface-density of4*10^(-3) of the central value. we determine the total luminosity of leo i, andmodel its mass using the spherical and isotropic jeans equation. assuming that'mass follows light' we constrain a lower limit of the total mass of the dsphto be (1.7+/-0.2)*10^7 msol. contrary, if the mass in leo i is dominated by aconstant density dark-matter (dm) halo, then the mass within the central 12' is(2+/-0.6)*10^8 msol. this leads to a mass-to-light ratio of &gt;&gt;6 (ic_sol), andpossibly &gt;75 if the dm halo dominates the mass and extends further out than12'. in summary, our results show that leo i is a symmetric, relaxed and boundsystem; this supports the idea that leo i is a dark-matter dominated system.

1009.2081	quasar selection based on photometric variability	we develop a method for separating quasars from other variable point sourcesusing sdss stripe 82 light curve data for ~10,000 variable objects. tostatistically describe quasar variability, we use a damped random walk modelparametrized by a damping time scale, tau, and an asymptotic amplitude(structure function), sf_inf. with the aid of an sdss spectroscopicallyconfirmed quasar sample, we demonstrate that variability selection in typicalextragalactic fields with low stellar density can deliver complete samples withreasonable purity (or efficiency, e). compared to a selection method basedsolely on the slope of the structure function, the inclusion of the tauinformation boosts e from 60% to 75% while maintaining a highly complete sample(98%) even in the absence of color information. for a completeness of c=90%, eis boosted from 80% to 85%. conversely, c improves from 90% to 97% whilemaintaining e=80% when imposing a lower limit on tau. with the aid of colorselection, the purity can be further boosted to 96%, with c= 93%. hence,selection methods based on variability will play an important role in theselection of quasars with data provided by upcoming large sky surveys, such aspan-starrs and the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst). for a typical(simulated) lsst cadence over 10 years and a photometric accuracy of 0.03 mag(achieved at i~22), c is expected to be 88% for a simple sample selectioncriterion of tau&gt;100 days. in summary, given an adequate survey cadence,photometric variability provides an even better method than color selection forseparating quasars from stars.

1309.5384	spectroscopic needs for imaging dark energy experiments: photometric  redshift training and calibration	large sets of objects with spectroscopic redshift measurements will be neededfor imaging dark energy experiments to achieve their full potential, servingtwo goals:_training_, i.e., the use of objects with known redshift to developand optimize photometric redshift algorithms; and_calibration_, i.e., thecharacterization of moments of redshift (or photo-z error) distributions.better training makes cosmological constraints from a given experimentstronger, while highly-accurate calibration is needed for photo-z systematicsnot to dominate errors. in this white paper, we investigate the required scopeof spectroscopic datasets which can serve both these purposes for ongoing andnext-generation dark energy experiments, as well as the time required to obtainsuch data with instruments available in the next decade. large time allocationson kilo-object spectrographs will be necessary, ideally augmented by infraredspectroscopy from space. alternatively, precision calibrations could beobtained by measuring cross-correlation statistics using samples of brightobjects from a large baryon acoustic oscillation experiment such as desi. wealso summarize the additional work on photometric redshift methods needed toprepare for ongoing and future dark energy experiments.

1402.2776	the chaotic solar cycle ii. analysis of cosmogenic 10be data	context. the variations of solar activity over long time intervals using asolar activity reconstruction based on the cosmogenic radionuclide 10bemeasured in polar ice cores are studied. methods. by applying methods ofnonlinear dynamics, the solar activity cycle is studied using solar activityproxies that have been reaching into the past for over 9300 years. thecomplexity of the system is expressed by several parameters of nonlineardynamics, such as embedding dimension or false nearest neighbors, and themethod of delay coordinates is applied to the time series. we also fit a dampedrandom walk model, which accurately describes the variability of quasars, tothe solar 10be data and investigate the corresponding power spectraldistribution. the periods in the data series were searched by the fourier andwavelet analyses. the solar activity on the long-term scale is found to be onthe edge of chaotic behavior. this can explain the observed intermittent periodof longer lasting solar activity minima. filtering the data by eliminatingvariations below a certain period (the periods of 380 yr and 57 yr were used)yields a far more regular behavior of solar activity. a comparison between theresults for the 10be data with the 14c data shows many similarities. bothcosmogenic isotopes are strongly correlated mutually and with solar activity.finally, we find that a series of damped random walk models provides a good fitto the 10be data with a fixed characteristic time scale of 1000 years, which isroughly consistent with the quasi-periods found by the fourier and waveletanalyses.

0803.0997	a new method to separate star forming from agn galaxies at intermediate  redshift: the submillijansky radio population in the vla-cosmos survey	we explore the properties of the submillijansky radio population at 20 cm byapplying a newly developed optical color-based method to separate star forming(sf) from agn galaxies at intermediate redshifts (z&lt;1.3). although opticalrest-frame colors are used, our separation method is shown to be efficient, andnot biased against dusty starburst galaxies. this classification method hasbeen calibrated and tested on a local radio selected optical sample. givenaccurate multi-band photometry and redshifts, it carries the potential to begenerally applicable to any galaxy sample where sf and agn galaxies are the twodominant populations.  in order to quantify the properties of the submillijansky radio population,we have analyzed ~2,400 radio sources, detected at 20 cm in the vla-cosmossurvey. 90% of these have submillijansky flux densities. we classify theobjects into 1) star candidates, 2) quasi stellar objects, 3) agn, 4) sf, and5) high redshift (z&gt;1.3) galaxies. we find, for the composition of thesubmillijansky radio population, that sf galaxies are not the dominantpopulation at submillijansky flux levels, as previously often assumed, but thatthey make up an approximately constant fraction of 30-40% in the flux densityrange of ~50 microjy to 0.7 mjy. in summary, based on the entire vla-cosmosradio population at 20 cm, we find that the radio population at these fluxdensities is a mixture of roughly 30-40% of sf and 50-60% of agn galaxies, witha minor contribution (~10%) of qsos.

astro-ph;0102217	100-year mass loss modulations on the asymptotic giant branch	we analyze the differences in infrared circumstellar dust emission betweenoxygen rich mira and non-mira stars, and find that they are statisticallysignificant. in particular, we find that these stars segregate in the k-[12]vs. [12]-[25] color-color diagram, and have distinct properties of the iras lrsspectra, including the peak position of the silicate emission feature. we showthat the infrared emission from the majority of non-mira stars cannot beexplained within the context of standard steady-state outflow models. themodels can be altered to fit the data for non-mira stars by postulatingnon-standard optical properties for silicate grains, or by assuming that thedust temperature at the inner envelope radius is significantly lower (300-400k) than typical silicate grain condensation temperatures (800-1000 k). we arguethat the latter is more probable and provide detailed model fits to the iraslrs spectra for 342 stars. these fits imply that 2/3 of non-mira stars and 1/3of mira stars do not have hot dust ($&gt;$ 500 k) in their envelopes. the absenceof hot dust can be interpreted as a recent (order of 100 yr) decrease in themass-loss rate. the distribution of best-fit model parameters agrees with thisinterpretation and strongly suggests that the mass loss resumes on similar timescales. such a possibility appears to be supported by a number of spatiallyresolved observations (e.g. recent hst images of the multiple shells in the eggnebula) and is consistent with new dynamical models for mass loss on theasymptotic giant branch.

astro-ph;0202407	the galactic distribution of asymptotic giant branch stars	we study the galactic distribution of ~10,000 asymptotic giant branch (agb)stars selected by iras colors and variability index. the distance to each staris estimated by assuming a narrow luminosity function and a model-derivedbolometric correction. the characteristic agb star luminosity, l_agb, isdetermined from the condition that the highest number density must coincidewith the galactic bulge. assuming a bulge distance of 8 kpc, we determine l_agb\~ 3,500 lo, in close agreement with values obtained for nearby agb stars usingthe hipparcos data. we find that there are no statistically significantdifferences in the galactic distribution of agb stars with different irascolors, implying a universal density distribution. the direct determination ofthis distribution shows that it is separable in the radial, r, and vertical, z,directions. perpendicular to the galactic plane, the number density of agbstars is well described by an exponential function with a vertical scale heightof 300 pc. in the radial direction the number density of agb stars is constantup to r ~ 5 kpc, and then it decreases exponentially with a scale length of\~1.6 kpc. this fall-off extends to at least 12 kpc, where the sample becomestoo small. the overall normalization implies that there are about 200,000 agbstars in the galaxy. we estimate the [25]-[12] color distribution of agb starsfor an unbiased volume-limited sample. by using a model-dependenttransformation between the color and mass-loss rate, mdot, we constrain thetime dependence of mdot. the results suggest that for 10^-6 mo/yr &lt; mdot &lt;10^-5 mo/yr the mass-loss rate increases exponentially with time. we find onlymarginal evidence that the mass-loss rate increases with stellar mass.

astro-ph;0202408	optical and radio properties of extragalactic sources observed by the  first and sdss surveys	we discuss the optical and radio properties of 30,000 first sourcespositionally associated with an sdss source in 1230 deg$^2$ of sky. themajority (83%) of the first sources identified with an sdss source brighterthan r=21 are optically resolved. we estimate an upper limit of 5% for thefraction of quasars with broad-band optical colors indistinguishable from thoseof stars. the distribution of quasars in the radio flux -- optical flux planesupports the existence of the "quasar radio-dichotomy"; 8% of all quasars withi&lt;18.5 are radio-loud and this fraction seems independent of redshift andoptical luminosity. the radio-loud quasars have a redder median color by 0.08mag, and a 3 times larger fraction of objects with red colors. first galaxiesrepresent 5% of all sdss galaxies with r&lt;17.5, and 1% for r&lt;20, and aredominated by red galaxies. magnitude and redshift limited samples show thatradio galaxies have a different optical luminosity distribution than non-radiogalaxies selected by the same criteria; when galaxies are further separated bytheir colors, this result remains valid for both blue and red galaxies. thedistributions of radio-to-optical flux ratio are similar for blue and redgalaxies in redshift-limited samples; this similarity implies that thedifference in their luminosity functions, and resulting selection effects, arethe dominant cause for the preponderance of red radio galaxies in flux-limitedsamples. we confirm that the agn-to-starburst galaxy number ratio increaseswith radio flux, and find that radio emission from agns is more concentratedthan radio emission from starburst galaxies (abridged).

astro-ph;0202468	comparison of asteroids observed in the sdss with a catalog of known  asteroids	we positionally correlate asteroids from existing catalogs with a sample of$\about$18,000 asteroids detected by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss,ivezi\'{c} {\em et al.} 2001). we find 2641 unique matches, which represent thelargest sample of asteroids with both accurate multi-color photometry and knownorbital parameters. the matched objects are predominantly bright, anddemonstrate that the sdss photometric pipeline recovers \about90% of the knownasteroids in the observed region. for the recovered asteroids we find a largeoffset (\about 0.4 mag) between johnson v magnitudes derived from sdssphotometry and the predicted catalog-based visual magnitudes. this offsetvaries with the asteroid color from 0.34 mag for blue asteroids to 0.44 mag forred asteroids, and is probably caused by the use of unfiltered ccd observationsin the majority of recent asteroid surveys. this systematic photometric errorleads to an overestimate of the number of asteroids brighter than a givenabsolute magnitude limit by a factor of \about 1.7. the distribution of thematched asteroids in orbital parameter space indicates strong colorsegregation. we confirm that some families are dominated by a single asteroidtype (e.g. the koronis family by red asteroids and the themis family by blueasteroids), while others appear to be a mixture of blue and red objects (e.g.the nysa/polana family). asteroids with the bluest \iz colors, which can beassociated with the vesta family, show particularly striking localization inorbital parameter space.

astro-ph;0306621	star formation rate indicators in the sloan digital sky survey	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) first data release provides a database of106000 unique galaxies in the main galaxy sample with measured spectra. asample of star-forming (sf) galaxies are identified from among the 3079 ofthese having 1.4 ghz luminosities from first, by using optical spectraldiagnostics. using 1.4 ghz luminosities as a reference star formation rate(sfr) estimator insensitive to obscuration effects, the sfrs derived from themeasured sdss halpha, [oii] and u-band luminosities, as well as far-infraredluminosities from iras, are compared. it is established that straightforwardcorrections for obscuration and aperture effects reliably bring the sdssemission line and photometric sfr estimates into agreement with those at 1.4ghz, although considerable scatter (~60%) remains in the relations. it thusappears feasible to perform detailed investigations of star formation for largeand varied samples of sf galaxies through the available spectroscopic andphotometric measurements from the sdss. we provide herein exact prescriptionsfor determining the sfr for sdss galaxies. the expected strong correlationbetween [oii] and halpha line fluxes for sf galaxies is seen, but with a medianline flux ratio f_[oii]/f_halpha=0.23, about a factor of two smaller than thatfound in the sample of kennicutt (1992). this correlation, used in deriving the[oii] sfrs, is consistent with the luminosity-dependent relation found byjansen et al.

astro-ph;0307082	stellar and dynamical masses of ellipticals in the sloan digital sky  survey	we study the variation of the dark matter mass fraction of ellipticalgalaxies as a function of their luminosity, stellar mass, and size using asample of 29,469 elliptical galaxies culled from the sloan digital sky survey.we model ellipticals as a stellar hernquist profile embedded in anadiabatically compressed dark matter halo. this model allows us to estimate adynamical mass ($m_{dynm}$) at the half-light radius from the velocitydispersion of the spectra, and to compare these to the stellar mass estimates($m_{*}$) from kauffmann et al (2003). we find that $m_{*}/l$ is independent ofluminosity, while $m_{dynm}/l$ increases with luminosity, implying that thedark matter fraction increases with luminosity. we also observe that at a fixedluminosity or stellar mass, the dark matter fraction increases with increasinggalaxy size or, equivalently, increases with decreasing surface brightness:high surface brightness galaxies show almost no evidence for dark matter, whilein low surface brightness galaxies, the dark matter exceeds the stellar mass atthe half light radius. we relate this to the fundamental plane of ellipticalgalaxies, suggesting that the tilt of this plane from simple virial predictionsis due to the dark matter in galaxies. we find that a simple model wheregalaxies are embedded in dark matter halos and have a star formation efficiencyindependent of their surface brightness explains these trends. we estimate thevirial mass of ellipticals as being approximately 7-30 times their stellarmass, with the lower limit suggesting almost all of the gas within the virialradius is converted into stars.

astro-ph;0309112	color variability of asteroids in sdss moving object catalog	we report a detection of statistically significant color variations for asample of 7,531 multiply observed asteroids that are listed in the sloandigital sky survey moving object catalog. using 5-band photometric observationsaccurate to ~0.02 mag, we detect color variations in the range 0.06-0.11 mag(rms). these variations appear uncorrelated with asteroids physicalcharacteristics such as diameter (in the probed 1-10 km range), taxonomicclass, and family membership. despite such a lack of correlation, which impliesa random nature for the cause of color variability, a suite of tests suggestthat the detected variations are not instrumental effects. in particular, theobserved color variations are incompatible with photometric errors, and, forobjects observed at least four times, the color change in the first pair ofobservations is correlated with the color change in the second pair. thesefacts strongly suggest that the observed effect is real, and also indicate thatfor some asteroids color variations are larger than for others. the detectedcolor variations can be explained as due to inhomogeneous albedo distributionover an asteroid surface. although relatively small, these variations suggestthat fairly large patches with different color than their surroundings exist ona significant fraction of asteroids. this conclusion is in agreement withspatially resolved color images of several large asteroids obtained by nearspacecraft and hst.

astro-ph;0310336	the ensemble photometric variability of ~25000 quasars in the sloan  digital sky survey	using a sample of over 25000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars from thesloan digital sky survey, we show how quasar variability in the rest frameoptical/uv regime depends upon rest frame time lag, luminosity, restwavelength, redshift, the presence of radio and x-ray emission, and thepresence of broad absorption line systems. the time dependence of variability(the structure function) is well-fit by a single power law on timescales fromdays to years. there is an anti-correlation of variability amplitude with restwavelength, and quasars are systematically bluer when brighter at allredshifts. there is a strong anti-correlation of variability with quasarluminosity. there is also a significant positive correlation of variabilityamplitude with redshift, indicating evolution of the quasar population or thevariability mechanism. we parameterize all of these relationships. quasars withrass x-ray detections are significantly more variable (at optical/uvwavelengths) than those without, and radio loud quasars are marginally morevariable than their radio weak counterparts. we find no significant differencein the variability of quasars with and without broad absorption line troughs.models involving multiple discrete events or gravitational microlensing areunlikely by themselves to account for the data. so-called accretion diskinstability models are promising, but more quantitative predictions are needed.

astro-ph;0312427	a gravitationally lensed quasar with quadruple images separated by 14.62  arcseconds	gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for the study of the distribution ofdark matter in the universe. the cold-dark-matter model of the formation oflarge-scale structures predicts the existence of quasars gravitationally lensedby concentrations of dark matter so massive that the quasar images would besplit by over 7 arcsec. numerous searches for large-separation lensed quasarshave, however, been unsuccessful. all of the roughly 70 lensed quasars known,including the first lensed quasar discovered, have smaller separations that canbe explained in terms of galaxy-scale concentrations of baryonic matter.although gravitationally lensed galaxies with large separations are known,quasars are more useful cosmological probes because of the simplicity of theresulting lens systems. here we report the discovery of a lensed quasar, sdssj1004+4112, which has a maximum separation between the components of 14.62arcsec. such a large separation means that the lensing object must be dominatedby dark matter. our results are fully consistent with theoretical expectationsbased on the cold-dark-matter model.

astro-ph;0512338	chandra multiwavelength project: normal galaxies at intermediate  redshift	(abridged) we have investigated 136 chandra extragalactic sources withoutbroad optical emission lines, including 93 galaxies with narrow emission lines(nelg) and 43 with only absorption lines (alg). based on fx/fo, lx, x-rayspectral hardness and optical emission line diagnostics, we have conservativelyclassified 36 normal galaxies (20 spirals and 16 ellipticals) and 71 agns. wefound no statistically significant evolution in lx/lb, within the limited zrange. we have built log(n)-log(s), after correcting for completeness based ona series of simulations. the best-fit slope is -1.5 for both s and b energybands, which is considerably steeper than that of the agn-dominated cosmicbackground sources, but slightly flatter than the previous estimate, indicatingnormal galaxies will not exceed the agn population until fx ~ 2 x 10-18 erg s-1cm-2 (a factor of ~5 lower than the previous estimate). a group of nelgs appearto be heavily obscured in x-rays, i.e., a typical type 2 agn. after correctingfor intrinsic absorption, their x-ray luminosities could be lx &gt; 10^44 erg s-1,making them type 2 quasar candidates. while most x-ray luminous algs (xbong -x-ray bright, optically normal galaxy candidates) do not appear to besignificantly absorbed, we found two heavily obscured objects, which could beas luminous as an unobscured broad-line quasar. among 43 algs, we found two e+agalaxy candidates with strong balmer absorption lines, but no [oii] line. thex-ray spectra of both galaxies are soft and one of them has a nearby closecompanion galaxy, supporting the merger/interaction scenario rather than thedusty starburst hypothesis.

astro-ph;0605302	the clustering of luminous red galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey  imaging data	we present the 3d real space clustering power spectrum of a sample of\~600,000 luminous red galaxies (lrgs) measured by the sloan digital sky survey(sdss), using photometric redshifts. this sample of galaxies ranges fromredshift z=0.2 to 0.6 over 3,528 deg^2 of the sky, probing a volume of 1.5(gpc/h)^3, making it the largest volume ever used for galaxy clusteringmeasurements. we measure the angular clustering power spectrum in eightredshift slices and combine these into a high precision 3d real space powerspectrum from k=0.005 (h/mpc) to k=1 (h/mpc). we detect power on gigaparsecscales, beyond the turnover in the matter power spectrum, on scalessignificantly larger than those accessible to current spectroscopic redshiftsurveys. we also find evidence for baryonic oscillations, both in the powerspectrum, as well as in fits to the baryon density, at a 2.5 sigma confidencelevel. the statistical power of these data to constrain cosmology is ~1.7 timesbetter than previous clustering analyses. varying the matter density and baryonfraction, we find \omega_m = 0.30 \pm 0.03, and \omega_b/\omega_m = 0.18 \pm0.04, the detection of baryonic oscillations also allows us to measure thecomoving distance to z=0.5; we find a best fit distance of 1.73 \pm 0.12 gpc,corresponding to a 6.5% error on the distance. these results demonstrate theability to make precise clustering measurements with photometric surveys(abridged).

astro-ph;0606344	panchromatic properties of 99,000 galaxies detected by sdss, and (some  by) rosat, galex, 2mass, iras, gb6, first, nvss and wenss surveys	we discuss the panchromatic properties of 99,088 galaxies selected from thesdss data release 1 spectroscopic sample (a flux-limited sample for 1360deg^2). these galaxies are positionally matched to sources detected by rosat,galex, 2mass, iras, gb6, first, nvss and wenss. we find strong correlationsbetween the detection fraction at other wavelengths and optical properties suchas flux, colors, and emission-line strengths. using galex, sdss, and 2massdata, we construct the uv-ir broad-band spectral energy distributions forvarious types of galaxies, and find that they form a nearly one-parameterfamily. for example, based on sdss u- and r-band data, supplemented withredshift, the k-band 2mass magnitudes can be "predicted" with an rms scatter ofonly 0.2 mag. when a dust content estimate determined from sdss data bykauffmann et al. (2003) is also utilized, this scatter decreases to 0.1 mag. wedemonstrate that this dust content is indeed higher for galaxies detected byiras and that it can be used to "predict" measured iras 60 micron flux densitywithin a factor of two using only sdss data. we also show that the position ofa galaxy in the emission-line-based baldwin-phillips-terlevich diagram iscorrelated with the optical light concentration index and u-r color determinedfrom the sdss broad-band imaging data, and discuss changes in the morphology ofthis diagram induced by requiring detections at other wavelengths. we study their-radio correlation and find evidence that its slope may be different for agnand star-forming galaxies and related to the h_alpha/h_beta line strengthratio.

astro-ph;0606355	the rest-frame optical colors of 99,000 sdss galaxies	we synthesize the rest-frame stroemgren colors using sdss spectra for 99,088galaxies selected from data release 1. this narrow-band ~200 aa photometricsystem (uz, vz, bz, yz), first designed for the determination of effectivetemperature, metallicity and gravity of stars, measures the continuum spectralslope of galaxies in the rest-frame 3200-5800 aa wavelength range. galaxiesform a remarkably narrow locus (~0.03 mag) in the resulting color-colordiagram. the bruzual &amp; charlot population synthesis models suggest that theposition of a galaxy along this locus is controlled by a degenerate combinationof metallicity and age of the dominant stellar population. galaxy distributionalong the locus is bimodal, with the local minimum corresponding to an ~1 gyrold single stellar population. the position perpendicular to the locus isindependent of metallicity and age, and reflects the galaxy's dust content, asimplied by both the models and the statistics of iras detections. a comparisonof this locus with the galaxy locus in the h_delta-d_n(4000) diagram, utilizedby kauffmann et al. (2003) to estimate stellar masses, reveals a tightcorrelation, although the two analyzed spectral ranges barely overlap. overall,the galaxy spectral energy distribution in the entire uv to near-ir range canbe described as a single-parameter family with an accuracy of 0.1 mag, orbetter. this nearly one-dimensional distribution of galaxies in themulti-dimensional space of measured parameters strongly supports the conclusionof yip et al. (2004), based on a principal component analysis, that sdss galaxyspectra can be described by a small number of eigenspectra. apparently, thecontributions of stellar populations that dominate the optical emission fromgalaxies are combined in a simple and well-defined way.

astro-ph;0608575	the sloan digital sky survey monitor telescope pipeline	the photometric calibration of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) is amulti-step process which involves data from three different telescopes: the1.0-m telescope at the us naval observatory (usno), flagstaff station, arizona(which was used to establish the sdss standard star network); the sdss 0.5-mphotometric telescope (pt) at the apache point observatory (apo), new mexico(which calculates nightly extinctions and calibrates secondary patch transferfields); and the sdss 2.5-m telescope at apo (which obtains the imaging datafor the sdss proper).  in this paper, we describe the monitor telescope pipeline, mtpipe, thesoftware pipeline used in processing the data from the single-ccd telescopesused in the photometric calibration of the sdss (i.e., the usno 1.0-m and thept). we also describe transformation equations that convert photometry on theusno-1.0m u'g'r'i'z' system to photometry the sdss 2.5m ugriz system and theresults of various validation tests of the mtpipe software. further, we discussthe semi-automated pt factory, which runs mtpipe in the day-to-day standardsdss operations at fermilab. finally, we discuss the use of mtpipe in currentsdss-related projects, including the southern u'g'r'i'z' standard star project,the u'g'r'i'z' open star clusters project, and the sdss extension (sdss-ii).

astro-ph;0701506	lsst: comprehensive neo detection, characterization, and orbits	(abridged) the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst) is currently by far themost ambitious proposed ground-based optical survey. solar system mapping isone of the four key scientific design drivers, with emphasis on efficientnear-earth object (neo) and potentially hazardous asteroid (pha) detection,orbit determination, and characterization. in a continuous observing campaignof pairs of 15 second exposures of its 3,200 megapixel camera, lsst will coverthe entire available sky every three nights in two photometric bands to a depthof v=25 per visit (two exposures), with exquisitely accurate astrometry andphotometry. over the proposed survey lifetime of 10 years, each sky locationwould be visited about 1000 times. the baseline design satisfies strongconstraints on the cadence of observations mandated by phas such as closelyspaced pairs of observations to link different detections and short exposuresto avoid trailing losses. equally important, due to frequent repeat visits lsstwill effectively provide its own follow-up to derive orbits for detected movingobjects. detailed modeling of lsst operations, incorporating real historicalweather and seeing data from lsst site at cerro pachon, shows that lsst usingits baseline design cadence could find 90% of the phas with diameters largerthan 250 m, and 75% of those greater than 140 m within ten years. however, byoptimizing sky coverage, the ongoing simulations suggest that the lsst system,with its first light in 2013, can reach the congressional mandate of cataloging90% of phas larger than 140m by 2020.

astro-ph;0701507	the impact of lsst on asymptotic giant branch star research	(abridged) the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst) is currently by far themost ambitious proposed ground-based optical survey. the main science themesthat drive the lsst system design are dark energy and matter, the solar systeminventory, transient optical sky and the milky way mapping. the lsst system,with its 8.4m telescope and 3,200 megapixel camera, will be sited at cerropachon in northern chile, with the first light scheduled for 2013. in acontinuous observing campaign, lsst will cover the entire available sky everythree nights in two photometric bands to a depth of v=25 per visit (two 15second exposures), with exquisitely accurate astrometry and photometry. overthe proposed survey lifetime of 10 years, each sky location would be observedabout 1000 times, with the total exposure time of 8 hours distributed over sixbroad photometric bandpasses (ugrizy). this campaign will open a movie-likewindow on objects that change brightness, or move, on timescales ranging from10 seconds to 10 years. the survey will have a data rate of about 30 tb/night,and will collect over 60 pb of data over its lifetime, resulting in anincredibly rich and extensive public archive that will be a treasure trove forbreakthroughs in many areas of astronomy. i describe how this archive willimpact the agb star research and speculate how the system could be furtheroptimized by utilizing narrow-band tio and cn filters.

astro-ph;0701508	a comparison of sdss standard star catalog for stripe 82 with stetson's  photometric standards	we compare stetson's photometric standards with measurements listed in astandard star catalog constructed using repeated sdss imaging observations. thesdss catalog includes over 700,000 candidate standard stars from the equatorialstripe 82 (|dec|&lt;1.266 deg) in the ra range 20h 34' to 4h 00', and with the $r$band magnitudes in the range 14--21. the distributions of measurements forindividual sources demonstrate that the sdss photometric pipeline correctlyestimates random photometric errors, which are below 0.01 mag for starsbrighter than (19.5, 20.5, 20.5, 20, 18.5) in ugriz, respectively (about twiceas good as for individual sdss runs). we derive mean photometrictransformations between the sdss gri and the bvri system using 1165 stetsonstars found in the equatorial stripe 82, and then study the spatial variationof the difference in zeropoints between the two catalogs. using third orderpolynomials to describe the color terms, we find that photometric measurementsfor main-sequence stars can be transformed between the two systems withsystematic errors smaller than a few millimagnitudes. the spatial variation ofphotometric zeropoints in the two catalogs typically does not exceed 0.01magnitude. consequently, the sdss standard star catalog for stripe 82 can beused to calibrate new data in both the sdss ugriz and the bvri systems with asimilar accuracy.

astro-ph;0701509	sdss spectroscopic survey of stars	in addition to optical photometry of unprecedented quality, the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) is also producing a massive spectroscopic database. wediscuss determination of stellar parameters, such as effective temperature,gravity and metallicity from sdss spectra, describe correlations betweenkinematics and metallicity, and study their variation as a function of theposition in the galaxy. we show that stellar parameter estimates by beers etal. show a good correlation with the position of a star in the g-r vs. u-gcolor-color diagram, thereby demonstrating their robustness as well as apotential for photometric parameter estimation methods. using beers et al.parameters, we find that the metallicity distribution of the milky way stars ata few kpc from the galactic plane is bimodal with a local minimum at [z/zo]~-1.3. the median metallicity for the low-metallicity [z/zo]&lt;-1.3 subsample isnearly independent of galactic cylindrical coordinates r and z, while itdecreases with z for the high-metallicity [z/zo]&gt; -1.3 sample. we also findthat the low-metallicity sample has ~2.5 times larger velocity dispersion andthat it does not rotate (at the ~10 km/s level), while the rotational velocityof the high-metallicity sample decreases smoothly with the height above thegalactic plane.

astro-ph;0703026	the properties of jovian trojan asteroids listed in sdss moving object  catalog 3	we analyze 1187 observations of about 860 unique candidate jovian trojanasteroids listed in the 3rd release of sloan digital sky survey (sdss) movingobject catalog. the sample is complete at the faint end to r=21.2 mag (apparentbrightness) and h=13.8 (absolute brightness, approximately corresponding to 10km diameter). a subset of 297 detections of previously known trojans were usedto design and optimize a selection method based on observed angular velocitythat resulted in the remaining objects. using a sample of objects with knownorbits, we estimate that the candidate sample contamination is about 3%. thewell-controlled selection effects, the sample size, depth and accuratefive-band uv-ir photometry enabled several new findings and the placement ofolder results on a firmer statistical footing. we find that there aresignificantly more asteroids in the leading swarm (l4) than in the trailingswarm (l5): n(l4)/n(l5)=1.6$\pm$0.1, independently of limiting object's size.the overall counts normalization suggests that there are about as many jovianstrojans as there are main-belt asteroids down to the same size limit, inagreement with earlier estimates. we find that trojan asteroids have aremarkably narrow color distribution (root-mean-scatter of only $\sim$0.05 mag)that is significantly different from the color distribution of the main-beltasteroids. the color of trojan asteroids is correlated with their orbitalinclination, in a similar way for both swarms, but appears uncorrelated withthe object's size. we extrapolate the results presented here and estimate thatlarge synoptic survey telescope will determine orbits, accurate colors andmeasure light curves in six photometric bandpasses for about 100,000 joviantrojan asteroids.

astro-ph;9705203	infrared search for young stars in hi high-velocity clouds	we have searched the iras point source catalog and hires maps for youngstellar objects (ysos) in the direction of five \hi high-velocity clouds(hvcs). in agreement with optical searches in the halo, no evidence was foundfor extensive star-forming activity inside the high-latitude hvcs.specifically, we have found no signs of star formation or ysos in the directionof the a iv cloud or in the very-high-velocity clouds hvc~110-7-465 andhvc~114-10-440. we have identified only one young star in the direction of them~i.1 cloud, which shows almost perfect alignment with a knot of \hi emission.because of the small number of early-type stars observed in the halo, theprobability for such a positional coincidence is low; thus, this young starappears to be physically associated with the m~i.1 cloud. we have alsoidentified a good yso candidate in the \hi shell-like structure observed in thecore region of the low-latitude cloud complex h (hvc~131+1-200). this regioncould be a supernova remnant with several other yso candidates formed along theshock front produced by the explosion. in agreement with recent theoreticalestimates, these results point to a low but significant star-formation rate inintermediate and high galactic latitude hvcs. for m~i.1 in particular, weestimate that the efficiency of the star-formation process is $m(yso)/m(\hi)\ga10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ by mass. such efficiency is sufficient to account for (a) theexistence of the few young blue stars whose ages imply that they were born inthe galactic halo, and (b) the nonprimordial metallicities inferred for somehvcs if their metal content proves to be low.

astro-ph;9907234	the light curve and evolutionary status of the carbon star v hya	v hya, an evolved carbon star with a complex circumstellar envelope, has twovariability periods, 530d and 6000d (17 years). we analyze recent light curvedata and show that both variations have benn present for at least 100 years andhave been regular over this time. the 530d period and its 1.5 - 2 magnitudeamplitude show that v hya is a mira variable. we suggest that the star is in abinary system (as also suspected from the structure of the circumstellarenvelope) and that the 17-year variation is due to extinction by circumstellardust orbiting with the companion. the properties of the envelope found frommolecular line observations: the fast molecular wind, the relatively small sizeof the dense circumstellar envelope, and the high mass loss rate, all suggestthat v hya has entered its `superwind' phase. however, its spectral type,period, colors, and lack of ionizing radiation show that the star is still onthe agb. these properties add to the evidence that the complex structures ofmany planetary planetary nebulae, including fast stellar winds, originateduring the final phases of mass loss on the agb.

astro-ph;9912496	atomic carbon in the envelopes of carbon-rich post-agb stars	atomic carbon has been detected in the envelopes of three carbon-rich evolvedstars: hd 44179 (=afgl 915, the `red rectangle'); hd 56126; and, tentatively,the carbon star v hya. this brings to seven the number of evolved starenvelopes in which ci has been detected. upper limits were found for severalother stars, including r crb. ci was not detected in several oxygen rich postasymptotic giant branch (agb) stars (oh231.8+4.2, for example), although it isdetected in their carbon-rich analogues. two trends are evident in the data.first, circumstellar envelopes with detectable ci are overwhelmingly carbonrich, suggesting that much of the ci is produced by the dissociation ofmolecules other than co. second, the more evolved the envelope away from theagb, the higher is the ci/co ratio. the oxygen-rich supergiant star alpha oriremains the only oxygen rich star with a wind containing detectable ci. thesedata suggest an evolutionary sequence for the ci/co ratio in cool circumstellarenvelopes. this ratio is small (a few %) while the star is on the agb, and theci is located in the outer envelope and produced by photodissociation. theratio increases to about 0.5 as the star evolves away from the agb because ofthe dissociation of co and other carbon-bearing molecules by shocks caused bythe fast winds which appear at the end of evolution on the agb. finally, theratio becomes &gt;&gt; 1 as the central star becomes hot enough to photodissociateco.

0810.5155	parametrization and classification of 20 billion lsst objects: lessons  from sdss	the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst) will be a large, wide-fieldground-based system designed to obtain, starting in 2015, multiple images ofthe sky that is visible from cerro pachon in northern chile. about 90% of theobserving time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which willobserve a 20,000 deg$^2$ region about 1000 times during the anticipated 10years of operations (distributed over six bands, $ugrizy$). each 30-second longvisit will deliver 5$\sigma$ depth for point sources of $r\sim24.5$ on average.the co-added map will be about 3 magnitudes deeper, and will include 10 billiongalaxies and a similar number of stars. we discuss various measurements thatwill be automatically performed for these 20 billion sources, and how they canbe used for classification and determination of source physical and otherproperties. we provide a few classification examples based on sdss data, suchas color classification of stars, color-spatial proximity search for wide-anglebinary stars, orbital-color classification of asteroid families, and therecognition of main galaxy components based on the distribution of stars in theposition-metallicity-kinematics space. guided by these examples, we anticipatethat two grand classification challenges for lsst will be 1) rapid and robustclassification of sources detected in difference images, and 2) {\itsimultaneous} treatment of diverse astrometric and photometric time seriesmeasurements for an unprecedentedly large number of objects.

0810.5158	sdss observations of the milky way vs. n-body models: a comparison of  stellar distributions in the position-velocity-metallicity space	the data obtained by the recent modern sky surveys enable detailed studies ofthe stellar distribution in the multi-dimensional space spanned by spatialcoordinates, velocity and metallicity, from the solar neighborhood all the wayout to the outer milky way halo. while these results represent excitingobservational breakthroughs, their interpretation is not simple. for example,traditional decomposition of the thin and thick disks predicts a strongcorrelation in metallicity and kinematics at $\sim$1 kpc from the galacticplane; however, recent sdss--based work has demonstrated an absence of thiscorrelation for disk stars. instead, the variation of the metallicity androtational velocity distributions can be modeled using non--gaussian functionsthat retain their shapes and only shift as the distance from the mid--planeincreases. to fully contextualize these recent observational results, adetailed comparison with sophisticated numerical models is necessary. modernsimulations have sufficient resolution and physical detail to study theformation of stellar disks and spheroids over a large baseline of masses andcosmic ages. we discuss preliminary comparisons of various observed maps andn--body model predictions and find them encouraging. in particular, the n--bodydisk models of ro\v{s}kar et al. \cite{roskar 2008} reproduce a change of diskscale height reminiscent of thin/thick disk decomposition, as well asmetallicity and rotational velocity gradients, while not inducing a correlationof the latter two quantities, in qualitative agreement with sdss observations.

0810.5159	time variability of quasars: the structure function variance	significant progress in the description of quasar variability has beenrecently made by employing sdss and poss data. common to most studies is afundamental assumption that photometric observations at two epochs for a largenumber of quasars will reveal the same statistical properties as well-sampledlight curves for individual objects. we critically test this assumption usinglight curves for a sample of $\sim$2,600 spectroscopically confirmed quasarsobserved about 50 times on average over 8 years by the sdss stripe 82 survey.we find that the dependence of the mean structure function computed forindividual quasars on luminosity, rest-frame wavelength and time isqualitatively and quantitatively similar to the behavior of the structurefunction derived from two-epoch observations of a much larger sample. we alsoreproduce the result that the variability properties of radio and x-rayselected subsamples are different. however, the scatter of the variabilitystructure function for fixed values of luminosity, rest-frame wavelength andtime is similar to the scatter induced by the variance of these quantities inthe analyzed sample. hence, our results suggest that, although the statisticalproperties of quasar variability inferred using two-epoch data capture someunderlying physics, there is significant additional information that can beextracted from well-sampled light curves for individual objects.
