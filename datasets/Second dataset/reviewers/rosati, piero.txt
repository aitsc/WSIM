0903.3853	multi-wavelength observations of a rich galaxy cluster at z ~ 1: the  hst/acs colour-magnitude diagram	xmmu j1229+0151 is a rich galaxy cluster with redshift z=0.975, that wasserendipitously detected in x-rays within the scope of the xmm-newton distantcluster project. hst/acs observations in the i775 and z850 passbands, as wellas vlt/fors2 spectroscopy were further obtained, in addition to follow-upnear-infrared (nir) imaging in j- and ks-bands with ntt/sofi. we investigatethe photometric, structural and spectral properties of the early-type galaxiesin the high-redshift cluster xmmu j1229+0151. source detection and aperturephotometry are performed in the optical and nir imaging. galaxy morphology isinspected visually and by means of sersic profile fitting to the 21spectroscopically confirmed cluster members in the acs field of view. thei775-z850 colour-magnitude relation (cmr) is derived with a method based ongalaxy magnitudes obtained by fitting the surface brightness of the galaxieswith sersic models. the i775-z850 cmr of the spectroscopic members shows a verytight red-sequence with a zero point of 0.86+-0.04 mag and intrinsic scatterequal to 0.039 mag. the cmr obtained with the galaxy models has similarparameters. stellar masses and formation ages of the cluster galaxies arederived by fitting the observed spectral energy distributions (sed) with modelsbased on bruzual &amp; charlot 2003. we obtain a star formation weighted age of 4.3gyr for a median mass of 7.4e10 msun. instead of an unambiguous brightestcluster galaxy (bcg), we find three bright galaxies with a similar z850magnitude, which are, in addition, the most massive cluster members, with ~2e11 msun. our results strengthen the current evidence for a lack ofsignificant evolution of the scatter and slope of the red-sequence out to z~1.

1006.3517	designing a space-based galaxy redshift survey to probe dark energy	a space-based galaxy redshift survey would have enormous power inconstraining dark energy and testing general relativity, provided that itsparameters are suitably optimized. we study viable space-based galaxy redshiftsurveys, exploring the dependence of the dark energy task force (detf)figure-of-merit (fom) on redshift accuracy, redshift range, survey area, targetselection, and forecast method. fitting formulae are provided for convenience.we also consider the dependence on the information used: the full galaxy powerspectrum p(k, p(k) marginalized over its shape, or just the baryon acousticoscillations (bao). we find that the inclusion of growth rate information(extracted using redshift space distortion and galaxy clustering amplitudemeasurements) leads to a factor of ~ 3 improvement in the fom, assuming generalrelativity is not modified. this inclusion partially compensates for the lossof information when only the bao are used to give geometrical constraints,rather than using the full p(k) as a standard ruler. we find that a space-basedgalaxy redshift survey covering ~20,000 deg^2 over 0.5&lt; z &lt; 2 with\sigma_z/(1+z)&lt;= 0.001 exploits a redshift range that is only easily accessiblefrom space, extends to sufficiently low redshifts to allow both a vast 3-d mapof the universe using a single tracer population, and overlaps withground-based surveys to enable robust modeling of systematic effects. we arguethat these parameters are close to their optimal values given currentinstrumental and practical constraints.

1008.0754	the evolution of cool-core clusters	cool-core clusters are characterized by strong surface brightness peaks inthe x-ray emission from the intra cluster medium (icm). this phenomenon isassociated with complex physics in the icm and has been a subject of intensedebate and investigation in recent years. in order to quantify the evolution inthe cool-core cluster population, we robustly measure the cool-core strength ina local, representative cluster sample, and in the largest sample ofhigh-redshift clusters available to date. we use high-resolution chandra dataof three representative cluster samples spanning different redshift ranges: (i)the local sample from the 400 sd survey with median z = 0.08, (ii) the highredshift sample from the 400 sd survey with median z=0.59, and (iii) 15clusters drawn from the rdcs and the warps, with median z = 0.83. our analysisis based on the measurement of the surface brightness concentration, c_sb,which allows us to characterize the cool-core strength in low signal-to-noisedata. we also obtain gas density profiles to derive cluster central coolingtimes and entropy. in addition to the x-ray analysis, we search for radiocounterparts associated with the cluster cores. we find a statisticallysignificant difference in the c_sb distributions of the two high-z samples,pointing towards a lack of concentrated clusters in the 400 sd high-z sample.taking this into account, we confirm a negative evolution in the fraction ofcool-core clusters with redshift, in particular for very strong cool-cores.this result is validated by the central entropy and central cooling time, whichshow strong anti-correlations with c_sb. however, the amount of evolution issignificantly smaller than previously claimed, leaving room for a largepopulation of well formed cool-cores at z~1.

1012.1151	are there cool-core clusters at high-redshift? chandra results and  prospects with wfxt	in this contribution we trace the evolution of cool-core clusters out toz~1.3 using high-resolution chandra data of three representative clustersamples spanning different redshift ranges. our analysis is based on themeasurement of the surface brightness (sb) concentration, c_sb, which stronglyanti-correlates with the central cooling time and allows us to characterize thecool-core strength in low s/n data. we confirm a negative evolution in thefraction of cool-core clusters with redshift, in particular for very strongcool-cores. still, we find evidence for a large population of well formedcool-cores at z ~ 1. this analysis is potentially very effective inconstraining the nature and the evolution of the cool-cores, once large samplesof high-z clusters will be available. in this respect, we explore the potentialof the proposed mission wide field x-ray telescope (wfxt) to address thisscience case. we conclude that wfxt provides the best trade-off of angularresolution, sensitivity and covered solid angle in order to discover and fullycharacterize the cool-core cluster population up to z=1.5.

1102.2089	measuring redshift through x-ray spectroscopy of galaxy clusters:  results from chandra data and future prospects	the ubiquitous presence of the fe line complex in the x-ray spectra of galaxyclusters offers the possibility of measuring their redshift without resortingto spectroscopic follow-up observations. in this paper we assess the accuracywith which the redshift of galaxy clusters can be recovered from an x-rayspectral analysis of chandra archival data. this study indicates a strategy tobuild large surveys of clusters whose identification and redshift measurementare both based on x-ray data alone. we apply a blind search for k--shell andl--shell fe line complex in x-ray cluster spectra using chandra archivalobservations of galaxy clusters. the fe line in the icm spectra can be detectedby simply analyzing the c-statistics variation $\delta c_{stat}$ as a functionof the redshift parameter. we repeat the measurement under differentconditions, and compare the x-ray derived redshift $z_x$ with the one obtainedby means of optical spectroscopy $z_o$. we explore how a number of priors onmetallicity and luminosity can be effectively used to reduce catastrophicerrors. the $\delta c_{stat}$ provides the most efficient means for discardingwrong redshift measures and to estimate the actual error on $z_x$. we identifya simple and efficient procedure for optimally measuring the redshifts from thex-ray spectral analysis of clusters of galaxies. when this procedure is appliedto mock catalogs extracted from high sensitivity, wide-area cluster surveys,such as those proposed with wide field x-ray telescope (wfxt) mission, it ispossible to obtain a complete samples of x-ray clusters with reliable redshiftmeasurements, thus avoiding time-consuming optical spectroscopic observations.this methodology will make it possible to trace cosmic growth by studying theevolution of the cluster mass function directly using x-ray data.

1105.5877	discovery of a massive x-ray luminous galaxy cluster at z=1.579	we report on the discovery of a very distant galaxy cluster serendipitouslydetected in the archive of the xmm-newton mission, within the scope of thexmm-newton distant cluster project (xdcp). xmmuj0044.0-2033 was detected at ahigh significance level (5sigma) as a compact, but significantly extendedsource in the x-ray data, with a soft-band flux f(r&lt;40")=(1.5+-0.3)x10^(-14)erg/s/cm2. optical/nir follow-up observations confirmed the presence of anoverdensity of red galaxies matching the x-ray emission. the cluster wasspectroscopically confirmed to be at z=1.579 using ground-based vlt/fors2spectroscopy. the analysis of the i-h colour-magnitude diagram shows a sequenceof red galaxies with a colour range [3.7 &lt; i-h &lt; 4.6] within 1' from thecluster x-ray emission peak. however, the three spectroscopic members (all withcomplex morphology) have significantly bluer colours relative to the observedred-sequence. in addition, two of the three cluster members have [oii]emission, indicative of on-going star formation. using the spectroscopicredshift we estimated the x-ray bolometric luminosity, lbol = 5.8x10^44 erg/s,implying a massive galaxy cluster. this places xmmu j0044.0-2033 at theforefront of massive distant clusters, closing the gap between lower redshiftsystems and recently discovered proto- and low-mass clusters at z &gt;1.6.

1106.3328	cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash): an overview	the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) is a 524-orbitmulti-cycle treasury program to use the gravitational lensing properties of 25galaxy clusters to accurately constrain their mass distributions. the survey,described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree ofconcentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of cdm. theclash cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples ofspace-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimizedlensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores.specifically, twenty clash clusters are solely x-ray selected. the x-rayselected clusters are massive (kt &gt; 5 kev; 5 - 30 x 10^14 m_solar) and, in mostcases, dynamically relaxed. five additional clusters are included for theirlensing strength (einstein radii &gt; 35 arcsec at z_source = 2) to furtherquantify the lensing bias on concentration, to yield high resolution darkmatter maps, and to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnifiedhigh-redshift (z &gt; 7) galaxies. the high magnification, in some cases, providesangular resolutions unobtainable with any current uvoir facility and can yieldz &gt; 7 candidates bright enough for spectroscopic follow-up. a total of 16broadband filters, spanning the near-uv to near-ir, are employed for each20-orbit campaign on each cluster. these data are used to measure precise(sigma_phz &lt; 0.02(1+z)) photometric redshifts for dozens of newly discoveredmultiply-lensed images per cluster. observations of each cluster are spreadover 8 epochs to enable a search, primarily in the parallel fields, for type iasupernovae at z &gt; 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the darkenergy equation of state and the evolution of such supernovae in an epoch whenthe universe is matter dominated.

1204.2305	a highly magnified candidate for a young galaxy seen when the universe  was 500 myrs old	the early universe at redshift z\sim6-11 marks the reionization of theintergalactic medium, following the formation of the first generation of stars.however, those young galaxies at a cosmic age of \lesssim 500 million years(myr, at z \gtrsim 10) remain largely unexplored as they are at or beyond thesensitivity limits of current large telescopes. gravitational lensing by galaxyclusters enables the detection of high-redshift galaxies that are fainter thanwhat otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. we report thediscovery of an object found in the multi-band observations of the clustermacs1149+22 that has a high probability of being a gravitationally magnifiedobject from the early universe. the object is firmly detected (12 sigma) in thetwo reddest bands of hst/wfc3, and not detected below 1.2 {\mu}m, matching thecharacteristics of z\sim9 objects. we derive a robust photometric redshift of z= 9.6 \pm 0.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of 490 \pm 15myr (i.e., 3.6% ofthe age of the universe). the large number of bands used to derive the redshiftestimate make it one of the most accurate estimates ever obtained for such adistant object. the significant magnification by cluster lensing (a factor of\sim15) allows us to analyze the object's ultra-violet and optical luminosityin its rest-frame, thus enabling us to constrain on its stellar mass,star-formation rate and age. if the galaxy is indeed at such a large redshift,then its age is less than 200 myr (at the 95% confidence level), implying aformation redshift of zf \lesssim 14. the object is the first z&gt;9 candidatethat is bright enough for detailed spectroscopic studies with jwst,demonstrating the unique potential of galaxy cluster fields for finding highlymagnified, intrinsically faint galaxies at the highest redshifts.

1209.1561	gmass ultradeep spectroscopy of galaxies at z~2 - vii. sample selection  and spectroscopy	the populations of both quiescent and actively star-forming galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2are still under-represented in our spectroscopic census of galaxies throughoutthe history of the universe. in the light of galaxy formation models, however,the evolution of galaxies at these redshifts is of pivotal importance andmerits further investigation. we therefore designed a spectroscopic observingcampaign of a sample of both massive, quiescent and star-forming galaxies atz&gt;1.4, called galaxy mass assembly ultra-deep spectroscopic survey (gmass). todetermine redshifts and physical properties, such as metallicity, dust content,dynamical masses, and star formation history, we performed ultra-deepspectroscopy with the red-sensitive optical spectrograph fors2 at the vlt. oursample consists of objects, within the cdfs/goods area, detected at 4.5 micron,to be sensitive to stellar mass rather than star formation intensity. thespectroscopic targets were selected with a photometric redshift constraint(z&gt;1.4) and magnitude constraints (b(ab)&lt;26, i(ab)&lt;26.5), which should ensurethat these are faint, distant, and fairly massive galaxies. we present thesample selection, survey design, observations, data reduction, andspectroscopic redshifts. up to 30 hours of spectroscopy of 174 spectroscopictargets and 70 additional objects enabled us to determine 210 redshifts, ofwhich 145 are at z&gt;1.4. from the redshifts and photometry, we deduce that thebzk selection criteria are efficient (82%) and suffer low contamination (11%).several papers based on the gmass survey show its value for studies of galaxyformation and evolution. we publicly release the redshifts and reduced spectra.in combination with existing and on-going additional observations incdfs/goods, this data set provides a legacy for future studies of distantgalaxies.

1211.3663	clash: three strongly lensed images of a candidate z ~ 11 galaxy	we present a candidate for the most distant galaxy known to date with aphotometric redshift z = 10.7 +0.6 / -0.4 (95% confidence limits; with z &lt; 9.5galaxies of known types ruled out at 7.2-sigma). this j-dropout lyman breakgalaxy, named macs0647-jd, was discovered as part of the cluster lensing andsupernova survey with hubble (clash). we observe three magnified images of thisgalaxy due to strong gravitational lensing by the galaxy clustermacsj0647.7+7015 at z = 0.591. the images are magnified by factors of ~8, 7,and 2, with the brighter two observed at ~26th magnitude ab (~0.15 ujy) in thewfc3/ir f160w filter (~1.4 - 1.7 um) where they are detected at &gt;~ 12-sigma.all three images are also confidently detected at &gt;~ 6-sigma in f140w (~1.2 -1.6 um), dropping out of detection from 15 lower wavelength hst filters (~0.2 -1.4 um), and lacking bright detections in spitzer/irac 3.6um and 4.5um imaging(~3.2 - 5.0 um). we rule out a broad range of possible lower redshiftinterlopers, including some previously published as high redshift candidates.our high redshift conclusion is more conservative than if we had neglected abayesian photometric redshift prior. given clash observations of 17 high massclusters to date, our discoveries of macs0647-jd at z ~ 10.8 and macs1149-jd1at z ~ 9.6 are consistent with a lensed luminosity function extrapolated fromlower redshifts. this would suggest that low luminosity galaxies could havereionized the universe. however given the significant uncertainties based ononly two galaxies, we cannot yet rule out the sharp drop off in number countsat z &gt;~ 10 suggested by field searches.

1306.5240	galaxy halo truncation and giant arc surface brightness reconstruction  in the cluster macsj1206.2-0847	in this work we analyze the mass distribution of macsj1206.2-0847, especiallyfocusing on the halo properties of its cluster members. the cluster appearsrelaxed in its x-ray emission, but has significant amounts of intraclusterlight which is not centrally concentrated, suggesting that galaxy-scaleinteractions are still ongoing despite the overall relaxed state. the clusterlenses 12 background galaxies into multiple images and one galaxy at $z=1.033$into a giant arc and its counterimage. the multiple image positions and thesurface brightness distribution (sfb) of the arc which is bent around severalcluster members are sensitive to the cluster galaxy halo properties. we modelthe cluster mass distribution with a nfw profile and the galaxy halos with twoparameters for the mass normalization and extent of a reference halo assumingscalings with their observed nir--light. we match the multiple image positionsat an r.m.s. level of $0.85\arcsec$ and can reconstruct the sfb distribution ofthe arc in several filters to a remarkable accuracy based on this clustermodel. the length scale where the enclosed galaxy halo mass is best constrainedis about 5 effective radii -- a scale in between those accessible to dynamicaland field strong lensing mass estimates on one hand and galaxy--galaxy weaklensing results on the other hand. the velocity dispersion and halo size of agalaxy with $m_{\rm 160w,ab}=19.2$ or $m_{\rm b,vega}=-20.7$ are $\sigma=150\rm kms^{-1}$ and $r\approx 26\pm 6 \rm kpc$, indicating that the halos of thecluster galaxies are tidally stripped. we also reconstruct the unlensed source(which is smaller by a factor of $\sim5.8$ in area), demonstrating the increaseof morphological information due to lensing and conclude that this galaxy haslikely star--forming spiral arms with a red (older) central component.

1308.1675	the contribution of halos with different mass ratios to the overall  growth of cluster-sized halos	we provide a new observational test for a key prediction of the \lambda cdmcosmological model: the contributions of mergers with differenthalo-to-main-cluster mass ratios to cluster-sized halo growth. we perform thistest by dynamically analyzing seven galaxy clusters, spanning the redshiftrange $0.13 &lt; z_c &lt; 0.45$ and caustic mass range $0.4-1.5$ $10^{15}h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$, with an average of 293 spectroscopically-confirmedbound galaxies to each cluster. the large radial coverage (a few virial radii),which covers the whole infall region, with a high number of spectroscopicallyidentified galaxies enables this new study. for each cluster, we identify boundgalaxies. out of these galaxies, we identify infalling and accreted halos andestimate their masses and their dynamical states. using the estimated masses,we derive the contribution of different mass ratios to cluster-sized halogrowth. for mass ratios between ~0.2 and ~0.7, we find a ~1 $\sigma$ agreementwith \lambda cdm expectations based on the millennium simulations i and ii. atlow mass ratios, $\lesssim 0.2$, our derived contribution is underestimatedsince the detection efficiency decreases at low masses, $\sim 2 \times 10^{14}$$h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$. at large mass ratios, $\gtrsim 0.7$, we do notdetect halos probably because our sample, which was chosen to be quite x-rayrelaxed, is biased against large mass ratios. therefore, at large mass ratios,the derived contribution is also underestimated.

1311.4879	kinematic analysis of a sample of x-ray luminous distant galaxy  clusters. the $l_x$ - $\sigma_v$ relation in the $z&gt;0.6$ universe	observations and cosmological simulations show galaxy clusters as a family ofnearly self-similar objects with properties that can be described by scalingrelations as a function of e.g. mass and time. here we study the scalingrelations between the galaxy velocity dispersion and x-ray quantities likex-ray bolometric luminosity and temperature in galaxy clusters at highredshifts (0.64 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 1.46). we also compare our results with thesimilar study of the local hiflugcs sample. for the analysis, we use a set of15 distant galaxy clusters extracted from the literature plus a sample of 10newly discovered clusters selected in x-rays by the \xmm distant clusterproject (xdcp) with more than 10 confirmed spectroscopic members per cluster.we also study the evolution of this scaling relation by comparing the highredshift results with the data from the local hiflugcs sample. we alsoinvestigated the $l_x - t_x$ and the $\sigma_v - t_x$ relations for the 15clusters in the literature sample. we report the results of the x-ray andkinematic analysis of 10 newly detected high redshift clusters and providetheir spectroscopic and kinematic details. for the entire, distant sample wefind a slope fully consistent with the one typical of local clusters, albeitwith a large associated uncertainty. the study on the evolution of theamplitude reveals a positive offset if the self-similar evolution is neglected,hence possibly indicating the need for including evolutionary effects. however,the $l_x - t_x$ relation is found to be in good agreement with the localrelation without any significant redshift evolution. finally, the $\sigma_v -t_x$ relation appears to slightly deviate from the theoretical expectation thatgalaxies and gas particles have a similar specific kinetic energy. however, theassociated uncertainty is currently too large for making any conclusivestatement in this regard.

0802.1445	searching for cool core clusters at high redshift	we investigate the detection of cool cores (ccs) in the distant galaxycluster population, with the purpose of measuring the cc fraction out toredshift 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.4. using a sample of nearby clusters spanning a wide rangeof morphologies, we define criteria to characterize cool cores, which areapplicable to the high redshift sample. we analyzed azimuthally averagedsurface brightness (sb) profiles using the known scaling relations and fittedsingle/double beta models to the data. additionally, we measured a surfacebrightness concentration, c_sb, as the ratio of the peak over the ambient sb.to verify that this is an unbiased parameter as a function of redshift, wedeveloped a model independent "cloning" technique to simulate the nearbyclusters as they would appear at the same redshifts and luminosities as thosein the distant sample. a more physical parameterization of cc presence isobtained by computing the cooling time at a radius of 20 kpc from the clustercenter. the distribution of the sb concentration and the stacked radialprofiles of the low-z sample, combined with published information on the ccproperties of these clusters, show 3 degrees of sb cuspiness: non-cc, moderateand strong cc. the same analysis applied to the high-z clusters reveals tworegimes: non-cc and moderate cc. the cooling time distribution corroboratesthis result by showing a strong negative correlation with c_sb. our analysisindicates a significant fraction of distant clusters harboring a moderate ccout to z=1.4, similar to those found in the local sample. the absence of strongcooling which we report is likely linked with a higher merger rate expected atredshift z &gt; 0.7, and should also be related with the shorter age of distantclusters, implying less time to develop a cool core.

1401.5800	clash-vlt: constraints on the dark matter equation of state from  accurate measurements of galaxy cluster mass profiles	a pressureless scenario for the dark matter (dm) fluid is a widely adoptedhypothesis, despite the absence of a direct observational evidence. accordingto general relativity, the total mass-energy content of a system shapes thegravitational potential well, but different test particles perceive thispotential in different ways depending on their properties. cluster galaxyvelocities, being $\ll$c, depend solely on the gravitational potential, whereasphoton trajectories reflect the contributions from the gravitational potentialplus a relativistic-pressure term that depends on the cluster mass. we exploitthis phenomenon to constrain the equation of state (eos) parameter of thefluid, primarily dm, contained in galaxy clusters. we use the complementaryinformation provided by the kinematic and lensing mass profiles of the galaxycluster macs 1206.2-0847 at $z=0.44$, as obtained in an extensive imaging andspectroscopic campaign within the clash survey. the unprecedented high qualityof our data-set and the properties of this cluster are well suited to determinethe eos parameter of the cluster fluid. since baryons contribute at most $15\%$to the total mass in clusters and their pressure is negligible, the eosparameter we derive describes the behavior of the dm fluid. we obtain the moststringent constraint on the dm eos parameter to date,$w=(p_r+2\,p_t)/(3\,c^2\rho)=0.00\pm0.15\mathrm{(stat)}\pm0.08\mathrm{(syst)}$,averaged over the radial range $0.5\,\mathrm{mpc}\leq$$r$$\leq$$r_{200}$, where$p_r$ and $p_t$ are the radial and tangential pressure, and $\rho$ is thedensity. we plan to further improve our constraint by applying the sameprocedure to all clusters from the ongoing clash-vlt program.

1411.1414	hubble space telescope combined strong and weak lensing analysis of the  clash sample: mass and magnification models and systematic uncertainties	we present results from a comprehensive lensing analysis in hst data, of thecomplete clash cluster sample. we identify new multiple-images previouslyundiscovered allowing improved or first constraints on the cluster inner massdistributions and profiles. we combine these strong-lensing constraints withweak-lensing shape measurements within the hst fov to jointly constrain themass distributions. the analysis is performed in two different commonparameterizations (one adopts light-traces-mass for both galaxies and darkmatter while the other adopts an analytical, elliptical nfw form for the darkmatter), to provide a better assessment of the underlying systematics - whichis most important for deep, cluster-lensing surveys, especially when studyingmagnified high-redshift objects. we find that the typical (median), relativesystematic differences throughout the central fov are $\sim40\%$ in the(dimensionless) mass density, $\kappa$, and $\sim20\%$ in the magnification,$\mu$. we show maps of these differences for each cluster, as well as the massdistributions, critical curves, and 2d integrated mass profiles. for theeinstein radii ($z_{s}=2$) we find that all typically agree within $10\%$between the two models, and einstein masses agree, typically, within$\sim15\%$. at larger radii, the total projected, 2d integrated mass profilesof the two models, within $r\sim2\arcmin$, differ by $\sim30\%$. stacking thesurface-density profiles of the sample from the two methods together, we obtainan average slope of $d\log (\sigma)/d\log(r)\sim-0.64\pm0.1$, in the radialrange [5,350] kpc. lastly, we also characterize the behavior of the averagemagnification, surface density, and shear differences between the two models,as a function of both the radius from the center, and the best-fit values ofthese quantities.

1412.7909	clash: extreme emission line galaxies and their implication on selection  of high-redshift galaxies	we utilize the clash (cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble)observations of 25 clusters to search for extreme emission-line galaxies(eelgs). the selections are carried out in two central bands: f105w (y105) andf125w (j125), as the flux of the central bands could be enhanced by thepresence of [o iii] 4959, 5007 at redshift of about 0.93-1.14 and 1.57-1.79,respectively. the multi-band observations help to constrain the equivalentwidths of emission lines. thanks to cluster lensing, we are able to identify 52candidates down to an intrinsic limiting magnitude of 28.5 and to a rest-frame[o iii] 4959,5007 equivalent width of about 3737 angstrom. our samples includea number of eelgs at lower luminosities that are missed in other surveys, andthe extremely high equivalent width can be only found in such faint galaxies.these eelgs can mimic the dropout feature similar to that of high redshiftgalaxies and contaminate the color-color selection of high redshift galaxieswhen the s/n ratio is limited or the band coverage is incomplete. we predictthat the fraction of eelgs in the future high redshift galaxy selections cannotbe neglected.

1507.06508	the projected gravitational potential of the galaxy cluster macs~j1206  derived from galaxy kinematics	we reconstruct the radial profile of the projected gravitational potential ofthe galaxy cluster macs-j1206 from 592 spectroscopic measurements of velocitiesof cluster members. for doing so, we use a method we have developed recentlybased on the richardson-lucy deprojection algorithm and an inversion of thespherically-symmetric jeans equation. we find that, within the uncertainties,our reconstruction agrees very well with a potential reconstruction from weakand strong gravitational lensing as well as with a potential obtained fromx-ray measurements. in addition, our reconstruction is in good agreement withseveral common analytic profiles of the lensing potential. varying theanisotropy parameter in the jeans equation, we find that isotropy parameterswhich are either small, $\beta\lesssim0.2$, or decrease with radius yieldpotential profiles which strongly disagree with that obtained fromgravitational lensing. we achieve the best agreement between our potentialprofile and the profile from gravitational lensing if the anisotropy parameterrises quite steeply to $\beta\approx0. 6$ within $\approx0.5\,\mathrm{mpc}$ andstays constant further out.

astro-ph;0112530	distant cluster hunting i: a comparison between the optical and x-ray  luminosity functions from an optical/x-ray survey	we present a comparison of x-ray and optical luminosities and luminosityfunctions of cluster candidates from a joint optical/x-ray survey, the rosatoptical x-ray survey. completely independent x-ray and optical catalogs of 23rosat fields (4.8 deg2) were created by a matched-filter optical algorithm andby a wavelet technique in the x-ray. we directly compare the results of theoptical and x-ray selection techniques. the matched-filter technique detected74% (26 out of 35) of the most reliable cluster candidates in thex-ray-selected sample; the remainder could be either constellations of x-raypoint sources or z&gt;1 clusters. the matched-filter technique identifiedapproximately 3 times the number of candidates (152 candidates) found in thex-ray survey of nearly the same sky (57 candidates). while the estimatedoptical and x-ray luminosities of clusters of galaxies are correlated, theintrinsic scatter in this relationship is very large. we can reproduce thenumber and distribution of optical clusters with a model defined by the x-rayluminosity function and by an lx lambda cl relation if h0=75 km s-1 mpc-1 andif the lx lambda cl relation is steeper than the expected lx lambda 2cl. onstatistical grounds, a bimodal distribution of x-ray luminous and x-ray faintclusters is unnecessary to explain our observations. follow-up work is requiredto confirm whether the clusters without bright x-ray counterparts are simplyx-ray faint for their optical luminosity because of their low mass or youth orare a distinct population of clusters that do not, for some reason, have denseintracluster media. we suspect that these optical clusters are low-masssystems, with correspondingly low x-ray temperatures and luminosities, or thatthey are not yet completely virialized systems.

astro-ph;0209035	the evolution of x-ray clusters of galaxies	considerable progress has been made over the last decade in the study of theevolutionary trends of the population of galaxy clusters in the universe. inthis review we focus on observations in the x-ray band. x-ray surveys with therosat satellite, supplemented by follow-up studies with asca and beppo-sax,have allowed an assessment of the evolution of the space density of clustersout to z~1, and the evolution of the physical properties of the intra-clustermedium out to z~0.5. with the advent of chandra and newton-xmm, and theirunprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution, these studies have beenextended beyond redshift unity and have revealed the complexity of thethermodynamical structure of clusters. the properties of the intra-cluster gasare significantly affected by non-gravitational processes including starformation and active galactic nucleus (agn) activity. convincing evidence hasemerged for modest evolution of both the bulk of the x-ray cluster populationand their thermodynamical properties since redshift unity. such anobservational scenario is consistent with hierarchical models of structureformation in a flat low density universe with omega_m=0.3 and sigma_8=0.7-0.8for the normalization of the power spectrum. basic methodologies forconstruction of x-ray-selected cluster samples are reviewed and implications ofcluster evolution for cosmological models are discussed.

astro-ph;0402140	the x-ray derived cosmological star formation history and the galaxy  x-ray luminosity functions in the chandra deep fields north and south	the cosmological star formation rate in the combined chandra deep fieldsnorth and south is derived from our x-ray luminosity function for galaxies inthese deep fields. mild evolution is seen up to redshift order unity with sfr ~(1 + z)^{2.7}. this is the first directly observed normal star-forming galaxyx-ray luminosity function (xlf) at cosmologically interesting redshifts (z&gt;0).this provides the most direct measure yet of the x-ray derived cosmicstar-formation history of the universe. we make use of bayesian statisticalmethods to classify the galaxies and the two types of agn, finding the mostuseful discriminators to be the x-ray luminosity, x-ray hardness ratio, andx-ray to optical flux ratio. there is some residual agn contamination in thesample at the bright end of the luminosity function. incompleteness slightlyflattens the xlf at the faint end of the luminosity function. the xlf has alognormal distribution and agrees well with the radio and infrared luminosityfunctions. however, the xlf does not agree with the schechter luminosityfunction for the h-alpha lf indicating that additional and different physicalprocesses may be involved in the establishment of the lognormal form of thexlf. the agreement of our star formation history points with the other starformation determinations in different wavebands (ir, radio, h-alpha) gives aninteresting constraint on the imf, and x-rays may be measuring directly thebinary star formation history of the universe. x-ray studies will continue tobe useful for probing the star formation history of the universe by avoidingproblems of obscuration. star formation may therefore be measured in moredetail by deep surveys with future x-ray missions.

astro-ph;9909273	predicting the clustering of x-ray selected galaxy clusters in  flux-limited surveys	(abridged) we present a model to predict the clustering properties of x-rayclusters in flux-limited surveys. our technique correctly accounts for pastlight-cone effects on the observed clustering and follows the non-linearevolution in redshift of the underlying dm correlation function and clusterbias factor. the conversion of the limiting flux of a survey into thecorresponding minimum mass of the hosting dm haloes is obtained by usingtheoretical and empirical relations between mass, temperature and x-rayluminosity of clusters. finally, our model is calibrated to reproduce theobserved cluster counts adopting a temperature-luminosity relation moderatelyevolving with redshift. we apply our technique to three existing catalogues:bcs, xbacs and reflex samples. moreover, we consider an example of possiblefuture space missions with fainter limiting flux. in general, we find that theamplitude of the spatial correlation function is a decreasing function of thelimiting flux and that the eds models always give smaller correlationamplitudes than open or flat models with low matter density parameter. in thecase of xbacs, the comparison with previous estimates of the observationalspatial correlation shows that only the predictions of models with omega_0m=0.3are in good agreement with the data, while the eds models have too low acorrelation strength. finally, we use our technique to discuss the beststrategy for future surveys. our results show that the choice of a wide areacatalogue, even with a brighter limiting flux, is preferable to a deeper, butwith smaller area, survey.

0810.1917	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in galaxy clusters at z ~1  from the acs intermediate redshift cluster survey	we apply detailed observations of the color-magnitude relation (cmr) with theacs/hst to study galaxy evolution in eight clusters at z~1. the early-type redsequence is well defined and elliptical and lenticular galaxies lie on similarcmrs. we analyze cmr parameters as a function of redshift, galaxy propertiesand cluster mass. for bright galaxies (m_b &lt; -21mag), the cmr scatter of theelliptical population in cluster cores is smaller than that of the s0population, although the two become similar at faint magnitudes. while thebright s0 population consistently shows larger scatter than the ellipticals,the scatter of the latter increases in the peripheral cluster regions. if weinterpret these results as due to age differences, bright elliptical galaxiesin cluster cores are on average older than s0 galaxies and peripheralelliptical galaxies (by about 0.5gyr). cmr zero point, slope, and scatter inthe (u-b)_z=0 rest-frame show no significant evolution out to redshift z~1.3nor significant dependence on cluster mass. two of our clusters display cmrzero points that are redder (by ~2sigma) than the average (u-b)_z=0 of oursample. we also analyze the fraction of morphological early-type and late-typegalaxies on the red sequence. we find that, while in the majority of theclusters most (80% to 90%) of the cmr population is composed of early-typegalaxies, in the highest redshift, low mass cluster of our sample, the cmrlate-type/early-type fractions are similar (~50%), with most of the late-typepopulation composed of galaxies classified as s0/a. this trend is notcorrelated with the cluster's x-ray luminosity, nor with its velocitydispersion, and could be a real evolution with redshift.
