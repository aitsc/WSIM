0704.1113	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: wind properties and evolution of  hot massive stars in the lmc	[abridged] we have studied the optical spectra of 28 o- and early b-typestars in the large magellanic cloud, 22 of which are associated with the youngstar-forming region n11. stellar parameters are determined using an automatedfitting method, combining the stellar atmosphere code fastwind with thegenetic-algorithm optimisation routine pikaia. results for stars in the lh9 andlh10 associations of n11 are consistent with a sequential star formationscenario, in which activity in lh9 triggered the formation of lh10. our samplecontains four stars of spectral type o2, of which the hottest is found to be~49-54 kk (cf. ~45-46 kk for o3 stars). the masses of helium-enriched dwarfsand giants are systematically lower than those implied by non-rotatingevolutionary tracks. we interpret this as evidence for efficientrotationally-enhanced mixing, leading to the surfacing of primary helium and toan increase of the stellar luminosity. this result is consistent with findingsfor smc stars by mokiem et al. for bright giants and supergiants no suchmass-discrepancy is found, implying that these stars follow tracks of modestly(or non-)rotating objects. stellar mass-loss properties were found to beintermediate to those found in massive stars in the galaxy and the smc, andcomparisons with theoretical predictions at lmc metallicity yielded goodagreement over the luminosity range of our targets, i.e. 5.0 &lt; log l/l(sun) &lt;6.1.

0903.1754	a third red supergiant rich cluster in the scutum-crux arm	we aim to characterise the properties of a third massive, red supergiantdominated galactic cluster. to accomplish this we utilised a combination ofnear/mid-ir photometry and spectroscopy to identify and classify the propertiesof cluster members, and statistical arguments to determine the mass of thecluster. we found a total of 16 strong candidates for cluster membership, forwhich formal classification of a subset yields spectral types from k3-m4 ia andluminosities between log(l/l_sun)~4.5-4.8 for an adopted distance of 6+/-1 kpc.for an age in the range of 16-20 myr, the implied mass is 2-4x10^4 m_sun,making it one of the most massive young clusters in the galaxy. this discoverysupports the hypothesis that a significant burst of star formation occurred atthe base of scutum-crux arm between 10-20 myr ago, yielding a stellar complexcomprising at least ~10^5m_sun of stars (noting that since the clusteridentification criteria rely on the presence of rsgs, we suspect that the truestellar yield will be significantly higher). we highlight the apparent absenceof x-ray binaries within the star formation complex and finally, given thephysical association of at least two pulsars with this region, discuss theimplications of this finding for stellar evolution and the production andproperties of neutron stars.

0903.2288	on the massive star content of the nearby dwarf irregular wolf-rayet  galaxy ic 4662	aims: we investigate the massive stellar content of the nearby dwarfirregular wolf-rayet galaxy ic 4662, and consider its global star formingproperties in the context of other metal-poor galaxies, the smc, ic 10 and ngc1569. methods: very large telescope/fors2 imaging and spectroscopy plusarchival hubble space telescope/acs imaging datasets permit us to spatiallyidentify the location, number and probable subtypes of wolf-rayet stars withinthis galaxy. we also investigate suggestions that a significant fraction of theionizing photons of the two giant hii regions a1 and a2 lie deeply embeddedwithin these regions. results: wolf-rayet stars are associated with a number ofsources within ic 4662-a1 and a2, plus a third compact hii region to the northwest of a1 (a1-nw).several sources appear to be isolated, single (or binary)luminous nitrogen sequence wr stars, while extended sources are clusters whosemasses exceed the orion nebula cluster by, at most, a factor of two. ic 4662lacks optically visible young massive, compact clusters that are common inother nearby dwarf irregular galaxies. a comparison between radio andhalpha-derived ionizing fluxes of a1 and a2 suggests that 30-50% of their totallyman continuum fluxes lie deeply embedded within these regions. conclusions:the star formation surface density of ic 4662 is insufficient for this galaxyto qualify as a starburst galaxy, based upon its photometric radius, r_25. ifinstead, we were to adopt the v-band scale length r_d from hunter &amp; elmegreen,ic 4662 would comfortably qualify as a starburst galaxy, since its starformation intensity would exceed 0.1 m_sun/yr/kpc^2.

0909.4160	bolometric luminosity variations in the luminous blue variable afgl2298	we characterise the variability in the physical properties of the luminousblue variable afgl2298 between 1989-2008. in conjunction with published datafrom 1989-2001, we have undertaken a long term (2001-2008) near-irspectroscopic and photometric observational campaign for this star and utilisea non-lte model atmosphere code to interpret these data. we find afgl2298 tohave been highly variable during the two decades covered by the observationaldatasets. photometric variations of &gt;1.6 mag have been observed in the jhkwavebands; however, these are not accompanied by correlated changes in near-ircolour. non-lte model atmosphere analysis of 4 epochs of k band spectroscopyobtained between 2001-7 suggests that the photometric changes were driven byexpansion and contraction of the stellar photosphere accompanied bycomparatively small changes in the stellar temperature. unclumped mass lossrates throughout this period were modest and directly comparable to those ofother highly luminous lbvs. however, the bolometric luminosity of afgl2298appears to have varied by at least a factor of ~2 between 1989-2008, with itbeing one of the most luminous stars in the galaxy during maximum. comparisonto other lbvs that have undergone non bolometric luminosity conserving`eruptions' shows such events to be heterogeneous, with afgl2298 the leastextreme example. these results - and the diverse nature of both the quiescentlbvs and associated ejecta - may offer support to the suggestion that more thanone physical mechanism is responsible for such behaviour.

0708.2042	the empirical metallicity dependence of the mass-loss rate of o- and  early b-type stars	[abridged] we present a comprehensive study of the metallicity dependence ofthe mass-loss rates in stationary stellar winds of hot massive stars. assuminga power-law dependence of mass loss on metallicity, mdot \propto z^{m}, andadopting a theoretical relation between the terminal velocity and metallicity,v_inf \propto z^{0.13} (leitherer et al.), we find m = 0.83 +/- 0.16 fornon-clumped outflows from an analysis of the wind momentum luminosity relation(wlr) for stars more luminous than 10^{5.2} lsun. within the errors, thisresult agrees with the prediction of m = 0.69 +/- 0.10 from vink et al. for thehigh luminosity stars we find the mass loss rates to be greater than thepredictions, implying wind clumping factors in their line-forming regions of~4. for lower luminosity stars, the winds are so weak that their strengthscannot be reliably derived from optical lines, and one must rely on analysis ofuv lines. in the low-luminosity domain the galactic wlr is found to be muchsteeper than expected from theory, leading to a discrepancy between uvmass-loss rates and the predictions by a factor 100 at luminosities of l ~10^{4.75} lsun, the origin of which is unknown. we emphasize that even if thecurrent mass-loss rates of hot luminous stars are overestimated as a result ofwind clumping, the degree of clumping would likely to be independent ofmetallicity, so the scalings derived in this study are expected to remaincorrect.

1203.3303	ic 4663: the first unambiguous [wn] wolf-rayet central star of a  planetary nebula	we report on the serendipitous discovery of the first central star of aplanetary nebula (pn) that mimics the helium- and nitrogen-rich wn sequence ofmassive wolf-rayet (wr) stars. the central star of ic 4663 (pn g346.2-08.2) isdominated by broad he ii and n v emission lines which correspond to a [wn3]spectral type. unlike previous [wn] candidates, the surrounding nebula isunambiguously a pn. at an assumed distance of 3.5 kpc, corresponding to astellar luminosity of 4000 lsun, the v=16.9 mag central star remains 4-6 magfainter than the average luminosity of massive wn3 stars even out to animprobable d=8 kpc. the nebula is typical of pne with an elliptical morphology,a newly discovered asymptotic giant branch (agb) halo, a relatively lowexpansion velocity (v_exp=30 km/s) and a highly ionised spectrum with anapproximately solar chemical abundance pattern. the [wn3] star is hot enough toshow ne vii emission (t_*=140+/-20 kk) and exhibits a fast wind (v_infty=1900km/s), which at d=3.5 kpc would yield a clumped mass loss rate of mdot = 1.8 x10^-8 msun/yr with a small stellar radius (r_*=0.11 rsun). its atmosphereconsists of helium (95%), hydrogen (&lt;2%), nitrogen (0.8%), neon (0.2%) andoxygen (0.05%) by mass. such an unusual helium-dominated composition cannot beproduced by any extant scenario used to explain the h-deficiency of post-agbstars. the o(he) central stars share a similar composition and the discovery ofic 4663 provides the first evidence for a second he-rich/h-deficient post-agbevolutionary sequence [wn]-&gt;o(he). this suggests there is an alternativemechanism responsible for producing the majority of h-deficient post-agb starsthat may possibly be expanded to include other he-rich/h-deficient stars suchas r coronae borealis stars and am canum venaticorum stars. the origin of theunusual composition of [wn] and o(he) central stars remains unexplained.

1208.0825	the vlt-flames tarantula survey. vii. a low velocity dispersion for the  young massive cluster r136	detailed studies of resolved young massive star clusters are necessary todetermine their dynamical state and evaluate the importance of gas expulsionand early cluster evolution. in an effort to gain insight into the dynamicalstate of the young massive cluster r136 and obtain the first measurement of itsvelocity dispersion, we analyse multi-epoch spectroscopic data of the innerregions of 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) obtained as part ofthe vlt-flames tarantula survey. following a quantitative assessment of thevariability, we use the radial velocities of non-variable sources to place anupper limit of 6 km/s on the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of stars withina projected distance of 5 pc from the centre of the cluster. after accountingfor the contributions of undetected binaries and measurement errors throughmonte carlo simulations, we conclude that the true velocity dispersion islikely between 4 and 5 km/s given a range of standard assumptions about thebinary distribution. this result is consistent with what is expected if thecluster is in virial equilibrium, suggesting that gas expulsion has not alteredits dynamics. we find that the velocity dispersion would be ~25 km/s ifbinaries were not identified and rejected, confirming the importance of themulti-epoch strategy and the risk of interpreting velocity dispersionmeasurements of unresolved extragalactic young massive clusters.

1209.4638	the vlt-flames tarantula survey viii. multiplicity properties of the  o-type star population	aims. we analyze the multiplicity properties of the massive o-type starpopulation. with 360 o-type stars, this is the largest homogeneous sample ofmassive stars analyzed to date.  methods. we use multi-epoch spectroscopy and variability analysis to identifyspectroscopic binaries. we also use a monte-carlo method to correct forobservational biases.  results. we observe a spectroscopic binary fraction of 0.35\pm0.03, whichcorresponds to the fraction of objects displaying statistically significantradial velocity variations with an amplitude of at least 20km/s. we compute theintrinsic binary fraction to be 0.51\pm0.04. we adopt power-laws to describethe intrinsic period and mass-ratio distributions: f_p ~ (log p)^\pi\ (with0.15 &lt; log p &lt; 3.5) and f_q ~ q^\kappa\ with 0.1 &lt; q=m_2/m_1 &lt; 1.0. thepower-law indexes that best reproduce the observed quantities are \pi = -0.45+/- 0.30 and \kappa = -1.0\pm0.4. the obtained period distribution thus favoursshorter period systems compared to an oepik law. the mass ratio distribution isslightly skewed towards low mass ratio systems but remains incompatible with arandom sampling of a classical mass function. the binary fraction seems mostlyuniform across the field of view and independent of the spectral types andluminosity classes. the binary fraction in the outer region of the field ofview (r &gt; 7.8', i.e. approx117 pc) and among the o9.7 i/ii objects are howeversignificantly lower than expected from statistical fluctuations.  conclusions. using simple evolutionary considerations, we estimate that over50% of the current o star population in 30 dor will exchange mass with itscompanion within a binary system. this shows that binary interaction is greatlyaffecting the evolution and fate of massive stars, and must be taken intoaccount to correctly interpret unresolved populations of massive stars.

1308.3412	the vlt-flames tarantula survey - xi. a census of the hot luminous stars  and their feedback in 30 doradus	we compile the first comprehensive census of hot luminous stars in the 30doradus (30 dor) star forming region of the lmc. the census extends to a radiusof 10arcmin (150pc) from the central cluster, r136. stars were selectedphotometrically and combined with the latest spectral types. 1145 candidate hotluminous stars were identified of which &gt;700 were considered genuine early typestars that contribute to feedback. we assess the spectroscopic completeness tobe 85% in outer regions (&gt;5pc) but fall to 35% in the vicinity of r136, givinga total of 500 hot luminous stars with spectroscopy. stellar calibrations andmodels were used to obtain their physical parameters before integrated valueswere compared to global observations and the population synthesis code,starburst99. the 31 w-r and of/wn stars made large contributions to the totalionising and wind luminosities of ~40% and ~50%, respectively. stars withminit&gt;100msun also showed high contributions to the global feedback, ~25% inboth cases. such massive stars are not accounted for by the current starburst99code, which underestimated the ionising and wind luminosities of r136 byfactors of ~2 and ~9, respectively. the census inferred a sfr of0.073+/-0.04msun/yr for 30 dor, typically higher than results from popular sfrcalibrations. however, it remained consistent with a far-uv luminosity tracerand a combined halpha and mid-infrared tracer, but only after correcting forhalpha extinction. the global ionising output exceeded measurements from theassociated gas and dust, suggesting ~6(+55/-6)% of ionising photons escape theregion. when studying very luminous star forming regions, it is thereforeessential to include the most massive stars to ensure a reliable energy budget.if 30 dor is typical of other large star forming regions, estimates of the sfrwill be underpredicted if this escape fraction is not accounted for.(abridged)

1407.1837	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xvii. physical and wind properties of  massive stars at the top of the main sequence	the evolution and fate of very massive stars (vms) is tightly connected totheir mass-loss properties. their initial and final masses differ significantlyas a result of mass loss. vms have strong stellar winds and extremely highionising fluxes, which are thought to be critical sources of both mechanicaland radiative feedback in giant hii regions. however, how vms mass-lossproperties change during stellar evolution is poorly understood. in theframework of the vlt-flames tarantula survey (vfts), we explore the mass-losstransition region from optically thin o to denser wnh star winds, therebytesting theoretical predictions. to this purpose we select 62 o, of, of/wn, andwnh stars, an unprecedented sample of stars with the highest masses andluminosities known. we perform a spectral analysis of optical vfts as well asnear-infrared vlt/sinfoni data using the non-lte radiative transfer code cmfgento obtain stellar and wind parameters. for the first time, we observationallyresolve the transition between optically thin o and optically thick wnh starwinds. our results suggest the existence of a kink between both mass-lossregimes, in agreement with recent mc simulations. for the optically thickregime, we confirm the steep dependence on the eddington factor from previoustheoretical and observational studies. the transition occurs on the ms near aluminosity of 10^6.1lsun, or a mass of 80...90msun. above this limit, we findthat - even when accounting for moderate wind clumping (with f = 0.1) - windmass-loss rates are enhanced with respect to standard prescriptions currentlyadopted in stellar evolution calculations. we also show that this results insubstantial helium surface enrichment. based on our spectroscopic analyses, weare able to provide the most accurate ionising fluxes for vms known to date,confirming the pivotal role of vms in ionising and shaping their environments.

0803.4262	the blue supergiant sher 25 and its intriguing hourglass nebula	the blue supergiant sher 25 is surrounded by an asymmetric, hourglass-shapedcircumstellar nebula. its structure and dynamics have been studied previouslythrough high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, and it appears dynamicallysimilar to the ring structure around sn 1987a. here we present long-slitspectroscopy of the circumstellar nebula around sher 25, and of the backgroundnebula of the host cluster ngc 3603. we perform a detailed nebular abundanceanalysis to measure the gas-phase abundances of oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, neonand argon. the oxygen abundance in the circumstellar nebula (12 + log[o/h] =8.61 +/- 0.13 dex) is similar to that in the background nebula (8.56 +/- 0.07),suggesting the composition of the host cluster is around solar. however, weconfirm that the circumstellar nebula is very rich in nitrogen, with anabundance of 8.91 +/- 0.15, compared to the background value of 7.47 +/- 0.18.a new analysis of the stellar spectrum with the fastwind model atmosphere codesuggests that the photospheric nitrogen and oxygen abundances in sher 25 areconsistent with the nebular results. while the nitrogen abundances are high,when compared to stellar evolutionary models they do not unambiguously confirmthat the star has undergone convective dredge-up during a previous redsupergiant phase. we suggest that the more likely scenario is that the nebulawas ejected from the star while it was in the blue supergiant phase. the star'sinitial mass was around 50 m_sun, which is rather too high for it to have had aconvective envelope stage as a red supergiant. rotating stellar models thatlead to mixing of core-processed material to the stellar surface during coreh-burning can quantitatively match the stellar results with the nebulaabundances.

1412.2705	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xix. b-type supergiants - atmospheric  parameters and nitrogen abundances to investigate the role of binarity and  the width of the main sequence	tlusty non-lte model atmosphere calculations have been used to determineatmospheric parameters and nitrogen (n) abundances for 34 single and 18 binaryb-type supergiants (bsgs). the effects of flux contribution from an unseensecondary were considered for the binary sample. we present the firstsystematic study of the incidence of binarity for a sample of bsgs across thetheoretical terminal age main sequence (tams). to account for the distributionof effective temperatures of the bsgs it may be necessary to extend the tams tolower temperatures. this is consistent with the derived distribution of massdiscrepancies, projected rotational velocities (vsini) and n abundances,provided that stars cooler than this temperature are post rsg objects. for thebsgs in the tarantula and previous flames surveys, most have small vsini. about10% have larger vsini (&gt;100 km/s) but surprisingly these show little or no nenhancement. all the cooler bsgs have low vsini of &lt;70km/s and high n abundanceestimates, implying that either bi-stability braking or evolution on a blueloop may be important. a lack of cool binaries, possibly reflects the smallsample size. single star evolutionary models, which include rotation, canaccount for the n enhancement in both the single and binary samples. thedetailed distribution of n abundances in the single and binary samples may bedifferent, possibly reflecting differences in their evolutionary history. thefirst comparative study of single and binary bsgs has revealed that the mainsequence may be significantly wider than previously assumed, extending toteff=20000k. some marginal differences in single and binary atmosphericparameters and abundances have been identified, possibly implying non-standardevolution for some of the sample. this sample as a whole has implications forseveral aspects of our understanding of the evolution of bsgs. full abstract inpaper

1501.03794	the evolution of rotating very massive stars with lmc composition	we present a dense model grid with tailored input chemical compositionappropriate for the large magellanic cloud. we use a one-dimensionalhydrodynamic stellar evolution code, which accounts for rotation, transport ofangular momentum by magnetic fields, and stellar wind mass loss to compute ourdetailed models. we calculate stellar evolution models with initial masses of70-500 msun and with initial surface rotational velocities of 0-550 km/s,covering the core-hydrogen burning phase of evolution. we find our rapidrotators to be strongly influenced by rotationally induced mixing of helium,with quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution occurring for the fastest rotatingmodels. above 160 msun, homogeneous evolution is also established through massloss, producing pure helium stars at core hydrogen exhaustion independent ofthe initial rotation rate. surface nitrogen enrichment is also found for slowerrotators, even for stars that lose only a small fraction of their initial mass.for models above 150 mzams, and for models in the whole considered mass rangelater on, we find a considerable envelope inflation due to the proximity ofthese models to their eddington limit. this leads to a maximum zero-age mainsequence surface temperature of 56000 k, at 180 msun, and to an evolution ofstars in the mass range 50-100 msun to the regime of luminous blue variables inthe hr diagram with high internal eddington factors. inflation also leads todecreasing surface temperatures during the chemically homogeneous evolution ofstars above 180 msun. the cool surface temperatures due to the envelopeinflation in our models lead to an enhanced mass loss, which prevents stars atlmc metallicity from evolving into pair-instability supernovae. thecorresponding spin-down will also prevent very massive lmc stars to producelong-duration gamma-ray bursts, which might, however, originate from lowermasses.

astro-ph;0004081	the gamma velorum binary system. ii. wr stellar parameters and the  photon loss mechanism	in this paper we derive stellar parameters for the wolf-rayet star in thegamma velorum binary system (wr11), from a detailed non-lte model of itsoptical and infrared spectra. compared to the study of schaerer et al., theparameters of the wc8 star are revised to a hotter effective temperature(teff~57kk),a higher luminosity (log(l/lsun = 5.00), and a lower mass loss rate(log(mdot / msun/yr) = -5.0 - using a 10% clumping filling factor). thesechanges lead to a significant decrease in wind efficiency number, from 144 to7, so that the driving mechanism of the wind of this wr star may be simplyradiation pressure on lines. the derived spectroscopic luminosity is found tobe 40% lower than that derived by de marco &amp; schmutz through themass-luminosity relationship for wr stars (log(l/lsun = 5.2). the paperfurthermore presents a comparison of the independently-developed modellingprograms, cmfgen and isa-wind . overall, there seems to be very reasonableagreement between the derived parameters for wr11, except for the carboncontent, which is 2 times higher for cmfgen (c/he=0.15 vs. 0.06, by number).thecomparison also confirms a disparity in the predicted flux at lambda&lt;$400a,found by crowther et al., which will have effects on several nebular linestrengths.  the paper also presents the first independent check of the photon lossmechanism proposed by schmutz. we conclude that, not only is it important toinclude very many lines to realistically model line blanketing, but inparticular those ones that critically interact with strong resonance lines(e.g. heii lambda303.78). the inclusion of these latter lines may significantlyalter the wind ionization structure.

astro-ph;0206257	revised stellar temperatures for magellanic cloud o supergiants from  fuse and vlt-uves spectroscopy	we have undertaken quantitative analysis of four lmc and smc o4--9.7 extremesupergiants using far-ultraviolet fuse, ultraviolet iue/hstand optical vlt uvesspectroscopy. extended, non-lte model atmospheres that allow for the consistenttreatment of line blanketing are used to analyse wind &amp; photospheric spectralfeatures simultaneously. using halpha to constrain dm/dt, hei-ii photosphericlines reveal t_eff's which are systematically (5-7.5kk) &amp; substantially(15-20%) lower than previously derived from unblanketed, plane-parallel,non-lte photospheric studies. we have confidence in these revisions, sincederived t_eff's generally yield consistent fits across the entire 912-7000angobserved spectral range. in particular, we are able to resolve previousuv-optical t_eff discrepancies. `of' classification criteria are directlylinked to (strong) nitrogen enrichment (via niii 4097) &amp; (weak) carbondepletion (via ciii 4647-51), providing evidence for mixing of unprocessed andcno processed material at their stellar surfaces. oxygen abundances are moredifficult to constrain, except via oii lines in the o9.7 supergiant for whichit is also found to be somewhat depleted. the effect of wind clumping is alsoinvestigated, for which pv 1118-28 potentially provides a useful diagnostic ino-star winds. revised stellar properties affect existing calibrations of (i)lyman continuum photons - a factor of two lower for the o4 supergiant; and (ii)kinetic energy released into the ism by o supergiants. our results also haveimportance for the calibration of the wind momentum-luminosity relationship forob stars.

astro-ph;0504342	on the massive stellar population of the super star cluster westerlund 1	we present new spectroscopic and photometric observations of the younggalactic open cluster westerlund 1 (wd 1) that reveal a unique population ofmassive evolved stars. we identify ~200 cluster members and presentspectroscopic classifications for ~25% of these. we find that all stars soclassified are unambiguously post-main sequence objects, consistent with anapparent lack of an identifiable main sequence in our photometric data to v~20.we are able to identify rich populations of wolf rayet stars, ob supergiantsand short lived transitional objects. of these, the latter group consists ofboth hot (luminous blue variable and extreme b supergiants) and cool (yellowhypergiant and red supergiant) objects - we find that half the known galacticpopulation of yhgs resides within wd1. we obtain a mean v-m_v ~25 mag from thecluster yellow hypergiants, implying a main sequence turnoff at or below m_v=-5 (o7 v or later). based solely on the masses inferred for the 53spectroscopically classified stars, we determine an absolute minimum mass of\~1.5 x 10^3 msun for wd 1. however, considering the complete photometricallyand spectroscopically selected cluster population and adopting a kroupa imf weinfer a likely mass for wd 1 of ~10^5 msun, noting that inevitable sourceconfusion and incompleteness are likely to render this an underestimate. assuch, wd 1 is the most massive compact young cluster yet identified in thelocal group, with a mass exceeding that of galactic centre clusters such as thearches and quintuplet. indeed, the luminosity, inferred mass and compact natureof wd 1 are comparable with those of super star clusters - previouslyidentified only in external galaxies - and is consistent with expectations fora globular cluster progenitor.

astro-ph;0509408	a neutron star with a massive progenitor in westerlund 1	we report the discovery of an x-ray pulsar in the young, massive galacticstar cluster westerlund 1. we detected a coherent signal from the brightestx-ray source in the cluster, cxo j164710.2-455216, during two chandraobservations on 2005 may 22 and june 18. the period of the pulsar is 10.6107(1)s. we place an upper limit to the period derivative of pdot&lt;2e-10 s/s, whichimplies that the spin-down luminosity is edot&lt;3e33 erg/s. the x-ray luminosityof the pulsar is l_x = 3(+10,-2)e33 (d/5 kpc)^2 erg/s, and the spectrum can bedescribed by a kt = 0.61+/-0.02 kev blackbody with a radius of r_bb =0.27+/-0.03 (d/5 kpc}) km. deep infrared observations reveal no counterpartwith k&lt;18.5, which rules out binary companions with m&gt;1 msun. taken together,the properties of the pulsar indicate that it is a magnetar. the rarity of slowx-ray pulsars and the position of cxo j164710.2-455216 only 1.6' from the coreof westerlund 1 indicates that it is a member of the cluster with &gt;99.97%confidence. westerlund 1 contains 07v stars with initial masses m_i=35 msun and&gt;50 post-main-sequence stars that indicate the cluster is 4+/-1 myr old.therefore, the progenitor to this pulsar had an initial mass m_i&gt;40 msun. thisis the most secure result among a handful of observational limits to the massesof the progenitors to neutron stars.

astro-ph;0602188	on the reliability of civ 1549 as an abundance indicator for high  redshift star-forming galaxies	we reconsider the use of the equivalent width of civ 1549, ew(civ), as anindicator of the oxygen abundance in star-forming galaxies, as proposed byheckman et al. for nearby starbursts. we refine the local calibration ofew(civ) vs. log (o/h) by using a restricted wavelength window which minimisesblending with interstellar absorption lines. when applied to the stellarcomponent only of the complex civ 1549 features in two high redshift galaxieswith good quality spectra, ms1512-cb58 (z = 2.7268) and q1307-bm1163 (z =1.4105), the local calibration gives values of the oxygen abundance which arein good agreement with other metallicity determinations based on nebularemission and interstellar absorption lines. our main conclusion is that forthis method to give reliable results at high redshifts, it should only be usedon data of sufficiently high spectral resolution (r &gt; 1000) for stellar andinterstellar civ components to be clearly separated. oxygen abundances will besystematically overestimated if the local calibration is applied to spectra ofhigh-z galaxies obtained with the low resolving powers (r ~ 200-300) of manycurrent wide field surveys. it will also be necessary to understand better thecauses of the scatter in the local relation, before we can be confident ofinferences from it at high z.

astro-ph;0606403	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: mass loss and rotation of  early-type stars in the smc	we have studied the optical spectra of a sample of 31 o- and early b-typestars in the small magellanic cloud, 21 of which are associated with the youngmassive cluster ngc 346. stellar parameters are determined using an automatedfitting method. comparison with predictions of stellar evolution that accountfor stellar rotation does not result in a unique age, though most stars arebest represented by an age of 1-3 myr. the present day v_sini distribution ofthe 21 dwarf stars in our sample is consistent with an underlying rotationalvelocity (v_r) distribution that can be characterised by a mean velocity ofabout 160-190 km/s and an effective half width of 100-150 km/s. the v_rdistribution must include a small percentage of slowly rotating stars. ifpredictions of the time evolution of the equatorial velocity for massive starswithin the environment of the smc are correct, the young age of the clusterimplies that this underlying distribution is representative for the initialrotational velocity distribution. the location in the hertzsprung-russelldiagram of the stars showing helium enrichment is in qualitative agreement withevolutionary tracks accounting for rotation, but not for those ignoring v_r.the mass loss rates of the smc objects having luminosities of log l/l_sun &gt; 5.4are in excellent agreement with predictions. however, for lower luminositystars the winds are too weak to determine m_dot accurately from the opticalspectrum. two of three spectroscopically classified vz stars from our sampleare located close to the theoretical zero age main sequence, as expected.

astro-ph;0606717	properties of galactic b supergiants	physical and wind properties of galactic b supergiants are presented basedupon non-lte line blanketed model atmospheres, including sher 25 toward the ngc3603 cluster. we compare halpha derived wind densities with recent results forsmc b supergiants and generally confirm theoretical expectations for strongerwinds amongst galactic supergiants. mid b supergiant winds are substantiallyweaker than predictions from current radiatively driven wind theory, a problemwhich is exacerbated if winds are already clumped in the halpha line formingregion. we find that the so-called `bistability jump' at b1 (teff ~ 21kk) fromlamers et al. is rather a more gradual downward trend. cno elementalabundances, including sher 25, reveal partially processed material at theirsurfaces. in general, these are in good agreement with evolutionary predictionsfor blue supergiants evolving redward accounting for rotational mixing. a fewcases, including hd 152236 (zeta^1 sco), exhibit strongly processed materialwhich is more typical of luminous blue variables. our derived photospheric[n/o] ratio for sher~25 agrees with that for its ejecta nebula, although ahigher degree of cno processing would be expected if the nebula originatedduring a red supergiant phase, as is suspected for the ring nebula ejected bythe b supergiant progenitor of sn 1987a, sk-69 202. sher 25 has an inferred ageof ~5myr in contrast with ~2myr for hd 97950, the ionizing cluster of ngc 3603.sher 25 may be a foreground object or close binary evolution could beresponsible for its unusual location in the h-r diagram.

astro-ph;0608076	wolf-rayet populations at high metallicity	observed properties of wolf-rayet stars at high metallicity are reviewed.wolf-rayet stars are more common at higher metallicity, as a result of strongermass-loss during earlier evolutionary phases with late wc subtypes signaturesof solar metallicity or higher. similar numbers of early (wc4-7) and late(wc8-9) stars are observed in the solar neighbourhood, whilst late subtypesdominate at higher metallicities, such as westerlund 1 in the inner milky wayand in m83. the observed trend to later wc subtype within metal-richenvironments is intimately linked to a metallicity dependence of wr stars, inthe sense that strong winds preferentially favour late subtypes. this hasrelevance to (a) the upper mass limit in metal-rich galaxies such as ngc 3049,due to softer ionizing fluxes from wr stars at high metallicity; (b)evolutionary models including a wr metallicity dependence provide a bettermatch to the observed n(wc)/n(wn) ratio. the latter conclusion partially restsupon the assumption of constant line luminosities for wr stars, yetobservations and theoretical atmospheric models reveal higher line fluxes athigh metallicity.

astro-ph;9908200	wolf-rayet nebulae as tracers of stellar ionizing fluxes: i. m1-67	we use wr124 (wn8h) and its associated nebula m1-67, to test theoreticalnon-lte models for wolf-rayet (wr) stars. lyman continuum ionizing fluxdistributions derived from a stellar analysis of wr124, are compared withnebular properties via photo-ionization modelling. our study demonstrates thesignificant role that line blanketing plays in affecting the lyman ionizingenergy distribution of wr stars, of particular relevance to the study of hiiregions containing young stellar populations.  we confirm previous results that non-line blanketed wr energy distributionsfail to explain the observed nebular properties of m1-67, such that thepredicted ionizing spectrum is too hard. a line blanketed analysis of wr124 iscarried out using the method of hillier &amp; miller (1998), with stellarproperties in accord with previous results, except that the inclusion ofclumping in the stellar wind reduces its wind performance factor to onlyapprox2. the ionizing spectrum of the line blanketed model is much softer thanfor a comparable temperature unblanketed case, such that negligible flux isemitted with energy above the hei 504 edge. photo-ionization modelling,incorporating the observed radial density distribution for m1-67 revealsexcellent agreement with the observed nebular electron temperature, ionizationbalance and line strengths. an alternative stellar model of wr124 iscalculated, following the technique of de koter et al. (1997), augmented toinclude line blanketing following schmutz et al. (1991). good consistency isreached regarding the stellar properties of wr124, but agreement with thenebular properties of m1-67 is somewhat poorer than for the hillier &amp; millercode.
