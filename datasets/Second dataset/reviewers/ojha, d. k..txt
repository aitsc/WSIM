0903.2122	triggered star formation and evolution of t-tauri stars in and around  bright-rimmed clouds	the aim of this paper is to quantitatively testify the "{\it small-scalesequential star formation}" hypothesis in and around bright-rimmed clouds(brcs). as a continuation of the recent attempt by ogura et al. (2007, paperi), we have carried out $bvi_{c}$ photometry of four more brc aggregates alongwith deeper re-observations of 2 previously observed brcs. again quantitativeage gradients are found in almost all the brcs studied in the present work.archival spitzer/irac data also support this result. the global distribution ofnir excess stars in each hii region studied here clearly shows evidence that aseries of radiation driven implosion (rdi) processes proceeded in the past fromnear the central o star(s) towards the peripheries of the hii region. we foundthat in general weak-line t-tauri stars (wttss) are somewhat older thanclassical t-tauri stars (cttss). also the fraction of cttss among the t-tauristars (ttss) associated with the brcs is found to decrease with age. thesefacts are in accordance with the recent conclusion by bertout et al. (2007)that cttss evolve into wttss. it seems that in general the ew of h$\alpha$emission in ttss associated with the brcs decreases with age. the mass function(mf) of the aggregates associated with the brcs of the morphological type "a"seems to follow that found in young open clusters, whereas "b/c" type brcs showsignificantly steeper mf.

0707.0269	star formation in young star cluster ngc 1893	we present a comprehensive multi-wavelength study of the star-forming regionngc 1893 to explore the effects of massive stars on low-mass star formation.using near-infrared colours, slitless spectroscopy and narrow-band $h\alpha$photometry in the cluster region we have identified candidate young stellarobjects (ysos) distributed in a pattern from the cluster to one of the nearbynebulae sim 129. the $v, (v-i)$ colour-magnitude diagram of the ysos indicatesthat majority of these objects have ages between 1 to 5 myr. the spread in theages of the ysos may indicate a non-coeval star formation in the cluster. theslope of the klf for the cluster is estimated to be $0.34\pm0.07$, which agreeswell with the average value ($\sim 0.4$) reported for young clusters. for theentire observed mass range $0.6 &lt; m/m_\odot \le 17.7$ the value of the slope ofthe initial mass function, $`\gamma$', comes out to be $-1.27\pm0.08$, which isin agreement with the salpeter value of -1.35 in the solar neighborhood.however, the value of $`\gamma$' for pms phase stars (mass range $0.6 &lt;m/m_\odot \le 2.0$) is found to be $-0.88\pm0.09$ which is shallower than thevalue ($-1.71\pm0.20$) obtained for ms stars having mass range $2.5 &lt; m/m_\odot\le 17.7$ indicating a break in the slope of the mass function at $\sim 2m_\odot$. estimated $`\gamma$' values indicate an effect of mass segregationfor main-sequence stars, in the sense that massive stars are preferentiallylocated towards the cluster center. the estimated dynamical evolution time isfound to be greater than the age of the cluster, therefore the observed masssegregation in the cluster may be the imprint of the star formation process.there is evidence for triggered star formation in the region, which seems togovern initial morphology of the cluster.

1003.4426	a multiwavelength study of star formation in the vicinity of galactic  hii region sh2-100	we present multiwavelength investigation of morphology, physical-environment,stellar contents and star formation activity in the vicinity of star-formingregion sh 2-100. it is found that the sh 2-100 region contains seven hiiregions of ultracompact and compact nature. the present estimation of distancefor three hii regions, along with the kinematic distance for others, suggeststhat all of them belong to the same molecular cloud complex. using nirphotometry, we identified the most probable ionizing sources of six hiiregions. their approximate photometric spectral type estimates suggest thatthey are massive early-b to mid-o zams stars and agree well with radiocontinuum observations at 1280 mhz. the morphology of the complex shows anon-uniform distribution of warm and hot dust, well mixed with the ionized gas,which correlates well with the variation of average visual extinction (~ 4.2 -97 mag) across the region. we estimated the physical parameters of ionized gaswith the help of radio continuum observations. we detected an optically visiblecompact nebula located to the south of the 850 micron emission associated withone of the hii regions and the diagnostic of the optical emission line ratiosgives electron density and electron temperature of ~ 0.67 x 10^3 cm^-3 and ~10^4 k, respectively. the physical parameters suggest that all the hii regionsare in different stages of evolution, which correlate well with the probableages in the range ~ 0.01 - 2 myr of the ionizing sources. the positions of irexcess stars, ultracompact and compact hii regions at the periphery of an hishell, possibly created by a wr star, indicate that star formation in sh 2-100region might have been induced by an expanding hi shell.

1005.2353	the sequence of low and high mass star formation in the young stellar  cluster iras 19343+2026	bvrijhk photometry, spitzer-glimpse photometry and hk band spectroscopy wereused to study the stellar content of iras 19343+2026, a (proto)star/clustercandidate, located close to the galactic plane. the data suggest that iras19343+2026 is a rich cluster associated with a massive protostar of 7.6 msolwith an age of ~ 10^5 yr. three point sources in the vicinity of thefar-infrared (fir) peak are also found to be early b type stars. the remaining(predominantly low mass) members of the cluster are best represented by a 1 - 3myr pre-main-sequence (pms) population. hk band spectra of two bright and fivefaint point sources in the cluster confirm that the results obtained from thephotometry are good representations of their young stellar object (yso) nature.thus, iras 19343+2026 is a young cluster with at least four early b-type starsclassified as young (10^4 - 10^5 yr), that are surrounded by a somewhat older(1 - 3 myr) population of low mass ysos. together, these results argue for ascenario in which low mass stars form prior to massive stars in a clusterforming environment. we compute the initial mass function (imf) for thiscluster using the k-band luminosity function; the slope of the imf is shallowerthan predicted by the salpeter's mass function. the cluster mass, mtot, isestimated to be in the range ~ 307 msol (from the data completeness limit) -585 msol (extrapolated down to the brown dwarf limit, assuming a certain imf).

1009.5578	multi-wavelength polarimetric study towards the open cluster ngc 1893	we present multi-wavelength linear polarimetric observations for 44 stars ofthe ngc 1893 young open cluster region along with v-band polarimetricobservations of stars of other four open clusters located between l ~160 to~175 degree. we found evidence for the presence of two dust layers located at adistance of ~170 pc and ~360 pc. the dust layers produce a polarization pv~2.2%. it is evident from the clusters studied in the present work that, in thegalactic longitude range l ~160 to 175 degree and within the galactic plane(|b| &lt; 2 degree), the polarization angles remain almost constant, with a mean~163 degree and a dispersion of 6 degree. the small dispersion in polarizationangle could be due to the presence of uniform dust layer beyond 1 kpc. presentobservations reveal that in case of ngc 1893, the foreground two dust layers,in addition to the intracluster medium, seems to be responsible for thepolarization effects. it is also found that towards the direction of ngc 1893,the dust layer that exists between 2-3 kpc has a negligible contributiontowards the total observed polarization. the weighted mean for percentage ofpolarization (pmax) and the wavelength at maximum polarization ({\lambda}max)are found to be 2.59 \pm 0.02% and 0.55 \pm 0.01 \mum respectively. theestimated mean value of {\lambda}max indicates that the average size of thedust grains within the cluster is similar to that in the general interstellarmedium. the spatial variation of the polarization is found to decrease towardsthe outer region of the cluster. in the present work, we support the notion, asalready has been shown in previous studies, that polarimetry, in combinationwith (u-b)/(b-v) colour-colour diagram, is a useful tool for identifyingnon-members in a cluster.

1010.2011	a multi-wavelength census of stellar contents in the young cluster ngc  1624	we present a comprehensive multi-wavelength analysis of the young cluster ngc1624 associated with the h ii region sh2-212 using optical ubvri photometry,optical spectroscopy and gmrt radio continuum mapping along with thenear-infrared (nir) jhk archival data. reddening e(b-v) and distance to thecluster are estimated to be 0.76 - 1.00 mag and 6.0 +/- 0.8 kpc, respectively.present analysis yields a spectral class of o6.5v for the main ionizing sourceof the region. the distribution of ysos in (j-h)/ (h-k) nir colour-colourdiagram shows that a majority of them have a_v $\le$ 4 mag. based on the nirexcess characteristics, we identified 120 probable candidate ysos in thisregion which yield a disk frequency of ~ 20%. these ysos are found to have anage spread of ~ 5 myr with a median age of ~ 2-3 myr and a mass range of ~ 0.1- 3.0 $m_\odot$. a significant number of ysos are located close to the clustercentre and we detect an enhanced density of reddened ysos located/projectedclose to the molecular clumps at the periphery of ngc 1624. this indicates thatthe ysos located within the cluster core are relatively older in comparison tothose located/projected near the clumps. from the radio continuum flux,spectral class of the ionizing source of the ultra-compact h ii region at theperiphery of sh2-212 is estimated to be ~ b0.5v. from optical data, slope ofthe mass function (mf) $\gamma$, in the mass range $1.2 \le m/m_{\odot}&lt;27$ canbe represented by a single power law with a slope -1.18 +/- 0.10, whereas thenir data in the mass range $0.65 \le m/m_{\odot}&lt;27$ yields $\gamma$ = -1.31+/- 0.15. the slope of the k-band luminosity function (klf) for the cluster isfound to be 0.30 +/- 0.06 which is in agreement with the values obtained forother young clusters.

0708.4137	a multiwavelength study of galactic hii region sh2-294	we present the observational results of galactic hii region s294, usingoptical photometry, narrow-band imaging and radio continuum mapping at 1280mhz, together with archival data from 2mass, msx and iras surveys. the stellarsurface density profile indicates that the radius of the cluster associatedwith the s294 region is ~ 2.3 arcmin. we found an anomalous reddening law forthe dust inside the cluster region and the ratio of total-to-selectiveextinction is found to be 3.8+-0.1. we estimate the minimum reddening e (b-v) =1.35 mag and distance of 4.8+-0.2 kpc to the region from optical cc and cmdiagrams. we identified the ionizing source of the hii region, and spectraltype estimates are consistent with a star of spectral type ~ b0 v. the 2massjhks images reveal a partially embedded cluster associated with the ionizingsource along with a small cluster towards the eastern border of s294. theionization front seen along the direction of small cluster in radio continuumand halpha images, might be due to the interaction of ionizing sources with thenearby molecular cloud. we found an arc shaped diffuse molecular hydrogenemission at 2.12 micron and a half ring of msx dust emission which surroundsthe ionized gas in the direction of the ionization front. self consistentradiative transfer model of mid- to far-infrared continuum emission detectednear small cluster is in good agreement with the observed spectral energydistribution of a b1.5 zams star. the morphological correlation between theionised and molecular gas, along with probable time scale involved between theionising star, evolution of hii region and small cluster, indicates that thestar-formation activity observed at the border is probably triggered by theexpansion of hii region.

1212.6706	optical photometric and polarimetric investigation of ngc 1931	we present optical photometric and polarimetric observations of stars towardsngc 1931 with the aim to derive the cluster parameters such as distance,reddening, age and luminosity/mass function as well as to understand the dustproperties and star formation in the region. the distance to the cluster isfound to be 2.3$\pm$0.3 kpc and the reddening e(b-v) in the region is found tobe variable. the stellar density contours reveal two clustering in the region.the observations suggest differing reddening law within the cluster region.polarization efficiency of the dust grains towards the direction of the clusteris found to be less than that for the general diffuse interstellar medium(ism). the slope of the mass function (-0.98$\pm$0.22) in the southern regionin the mass range 0.8 \textless $m/m_{\sun}$ $\textless$ 9.8 is found to beshallower in comparison to that in the northern region (-1.26$\pm$0.23), whichis comparable to the salpeter value (-1.35). the k-band luminosity function(klf) of the region is found to be comparable to the average value of slope(~0.4) for young clusters obtained by lada &amp; lada (2003), however, the slope ofthe klf is steeper in the northern region as compared to the southern region.the region is probably ionized by two b2 main-sequence type stars. the mean ageof the young stellar objects (ysos) is found to be 2$\pm$1 myr which suggeststhat the identified ysos could be younger than the ionizing sources of theregion. the morphology of the region, the distribution of the ysos as well asages of the ysos and ionizing sources indicate a triggered star formation inthe region.

1304.5327	young stellar population and ongoing star formation in the hii complex  sh2-252	in this paper an extensive survey of the star forming complex sh2-252 hasbeen undertaken with an aim to explore its hidden young stellar population aswell as to understand the structure and star formation history. this complex iscomposed of five embedded clusters associated with the sub-regions a, c, e, ngc2175s and teu 136. using 2mass-nir and spitzer-irac, mips photometry weidentified 577 young stellar objects (ysos), of which, 163 are class i, 400 areclass ii and 14 are transition disk ysos. spatial distribution of the candidateysos shows that they are mostly clustered around the sub-regions in the westernhalf of the complex, suggesting enhanced star formation activity towards itswest. using the spectral energy distribution and optical colour-magnitudediagram based age analyses, we derived probable evolutionary status of thesub-regions of sh2-252. our analysis shows that the region a is the youngest (~0.5 myr), the regions b, c and e are of similar evolutionary stage (~ 1-2 myr)and the clusters ngc 2175s and teu 136 are slightly evolved (~ 2-3 myr).morphology of the region in the 1.1 mm map shows a semi-circular shapedmolecular shell composed of several clumps and ysos bordering the westernionization front of sh2-252. our analyses suggest that next generation starformation is currently under way along this border and that possiblyfragmentation of the matter collected during the expansion of the hii region asone of the major processes responsible for such stars. we observed the densestconcentration of ysos (mostly class i, ~ 0.5 myr) at the western outskirts ofthe complex, within a molecular clump associated with water and methanol masersand we suggest that it is indeed a site of cluster formation at a very earlyevolutionary stage, sandwiched between the two relatively evolved chii regionsa and b.

astro-ph;0203198	spatial distribution of emission in unidentified infrared bands from  midcourse space experiment survey	recently the midcourse space experiment (msx) has surveyed the galactic planein mainly four infrared bands between 6 and 25 micron. two of these bands coverseveral unidentified infrared emission bands (uibs). with the aim of extractingthe spatial distribution of the uib emission on a large scale, a scheme hasbeen developed to model the msx data with emission in the uibs alongwith theunderlying thermal continuum from the interstellar dust. in order to test thisscheme, a sample of five galactic compact h ii regions (sh-61, sh-138, sh-152,sh-156, sh-186; zavagno &amp; ducci 2001) for which imaging study in someindividual uibs is available from isocam measurements, has been studied. theresults of this comparative study on small angular scale are as follows : (i)the morphological details extracted from our scheme agree very well with thosefrom the superior isocam measurements; (ii) the integrated strength of uibsextracted from the msx database correlates extremely well with the sum of thestrengths of individual uibs measured from isocam. this tight correlation isvery encouraging and promises the potential of msx database for study of largescale spatial distribution of uib emission (and the carriers of uibs) in theentire galactic plane.

(2002) based on recent theoreticalmodeling of dust formation of agb stars to determine mass-loss rates. however,the uncertainties in the mass-loss rates are rather large. the mass-loss ratesof the supergiants are comparable with those in the solar neighbourhood whilethe long-period variables cover a mass-loss range from $\rm -5 &lt; log\dot{\it{m}} &lt; -7$. the red giant candidateslie at the lower end of themass-loss rate range between $\rm -6.5 &lt; log \dot{{\it{m}}} &lt; -9$. we used theequivalent width of the co bandhead at 2.3 $\rm \mu m$, the nai doublet and thecai triplet to estimate metallicities using the relation by ram\'{\i}rez et al.(\cite{ramirez2000}). the metallicity distribution of the isogal objects showsa mean [fe/h] $\sim$ -0.25 dex with a dispersion of $\rm \pm 0.40 dex$ which isin agreement with the values of ram\'{i}rez et al.

(1996), from which analysis by megeath etal. indicates that the w3 main region has an age in the range of 0.3--1 myr.based on the comparison between models of pre-main sequence stars with theobserved color-magnitude diagram we find that the stellar population in w3 mainis primarily composed of low mass pre-main sequence stars. we also report thedetection of isolated young stars with large infrared excesses which are mostprobably in their earliest evolutionary phases.

astro-ph;9407075	a multicolor survey of absolute proper motions : galactic structure and  kinematics in the direction of galactic center at intermediate latitude	we have derived a new photographic photometry and proper motions for 20000stars with completeness to v = 18 in the direction of galactic center at theintermediate latitude (l = 3 deg,b = 47 deg; alpha(1950)=15h 18m, delta(1950) =+02deg 16') for a 15.5 sq deg field. the combination of four glass copies ofthe palomar observatory sky survey (i.e. poss 1402 e&amp;o and poss 1429 e&amp;o) hasbeen used as a first epoch for proper motion determination. the random error ofthe proper motions is approximately 0.''3/cen to v=17. the photometric accuracyranges between 0.07 to 0.10 in the v, b and u bands. we stress the importanceof the magnitude and color effects in astrometric surveys of field stars. usingcolor-magnitude diagrams of a few cluster member stars, a new distance of6.9+-0.5 kpc is derived for m5 and 20.3+-0.8 kpc for pal 5 globular clusters.this is in good agreement with other determinations. we have analyzed thecomponents of u+w and v galactic space motions resulting from the accurateproper motions survey. no dependence with z distance is found in the asymmetricdrift of the thick disk population. new estimates of the parameters of thevelocity ellipsoid have been derived for the thin disk, thick disk and halopopulations of the galaxy.

astro-ph;9407077	ubv ccd standards near 5c1 radio sources at intermediate galactic  latitude-i	we have been doing a photometric and astrometric sample survey programme onschmidt plates in a few selected directions in the galaxy with an aim to studygalactic stellar populations. in order to calibrate schmidt platesphotometrically, it is necessary to have a number of photometric standardswhich cover the entire range of magnitudes to be studied on the plates. asschmidt plates cover a wide area of the sky, the standards should also bespread over the surface of the plate so as to minimise geometrical effectspresent on the plate. this paper is first in a series of papers aimed at toprovide photometric standards in the selected galactic directions to bestudied. in this paper we present photometric magnitudes obtained through ccdobservation in the galactic direction (l=170deg, b=45deg) centered atalpha(2000) = 9h 41m 20s and delta(2000) = +49deg 54' 20'' and covering an areaof 14 sq degs. b and v magnitudes have been obtained for a total of 214 starsout of which for 73 stars u magnitudes also have been obtained. the magnituderange covered is 11&lt;v&lt;21 and 0.18&lt;b-v&lt;1.85.

astro-ph;9910016	new surveys of ubv photometry and absolute proper motions at  intermediate latitude	a photometric and proper motion survey has been obtained in 2 directions atintermediate latitude: ($l=167.5^\circ$, $b=47.4^\circ$;$\alpha_{2000}=9^h41^m26^s$,$\delta_{2000}=+49^\circ53'27''$) and($l=278^\circ$, $b=47^\circ$; $\alpha_{2000}=11^h42^m56^s$,$\delta_{2000}=-12^\circ31'42''$). the survey covers 7.13 and 20.84 squaredegrees, respectively. the limiting magnitude is about 18.5 in v for bothdirections. we have derived the density laws for stars (m$_{v}$ $\ge$ 3.5) as afunction of distance from the galactic plane. the density laws for stars followa sum of two exponentials with scale heights of 240 pc (thin disk) and 790 pc(thick disk), respectively. the local density of thick disk is found to be6.1$\pm$3 % relative to the thin disk. the kinematical distribution of starshas been probed to distances up to 3.5 kpc above the galactic plane. newestimates of the parameters of velocity ellipsoid have been derived for thethick disk of the galaxy. a comparison of our data sets with the besan\c conmodel star count predictions has been performed, giving a good agreement in themagnitude range v = 13 to 18.

0811.1837	young brown dwarfs in the core of the w3 main star-forming region	we present the results of deep and high-resolution (fwhm ~ 0".35) jhk nirobservations with the subaru telescope, to search for very low mass youngstellar objects (ysos) in the w3 main star-forming region. the nir surveycovers an area of ~ 2.6 arcmin^2 with 10-sigma limiting magnitude exceeding 20mag in the jhk bands. the survey is sensitive enough to provide unprecedenteddetails in w3 irs 5 region and reveals a census of the stellar population downto objects below the hydrogen-burning limit. we construct jhk color-color (cc)and j-h/j and h-k/k color-magnitude (cm) diagrams to identify very lowluminosity ysos and to estimate their masses. based on these cc and cmdiagrams, we identified a rich population of embedded yso candidates withinfrared excesses (class i and class ii), associated with the w3 main region. alarge number of red sources (h-k &gt; 2) have also been detected around w3 main.we argue that these red stars are most probably pre-main-sequence (pms) starswith intrinsic color excesses. based on the comparison between theoreticalevolutionary models of very low-mass pms objects with the observed cm diagram,we find there exists a substantial substellar population in the observedregion. the mass function (mf) does not show the presence of cutoff and sharpturnover around the substellar limit, at least at the hydrogen-burning limit.furthermore, the mf slope indicates that the number ratio of young brown dwarfsand hydrogen-burning stars in the w3 main is probably higher than those intrapezium and ic 348. the presence of mass segregation, in the sense thatrelatively massive ysos lie near the cluster center, is seen. the estimateddynamical evolution time indicates that the observed mass segregation in the w3main may be the imprint of the star formation process.
