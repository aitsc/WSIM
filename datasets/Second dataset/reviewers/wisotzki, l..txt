0704.0187	the transverse proximity effect in spectral hardness on the line of  sight towards he 2347-4342	we report the discovery of 14 quasars in the vicinity of he2347-4342, one ofthe two quasars whose intergalactic heii forest has been resolved with fuse. byanalysing the hi and the heii opacity variations separately, no transverseproximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of he2347-4342:qsoj23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), qsoj23500-4319 (z=2.302,$\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and qsoj23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$arcmin). this is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probablycreated by large-scale structure. by comparing the hi absorption and thecorresponding heii absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape ofthe extragalactic uv radiation field along this line of sight. we find that theuv spectral shape near he2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the threeforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from uv backgroundmodels dominated by quasars. in addition, we find three highly ionised metalline systems near the quasars. however, they do not yield further constraintson the shape of the ionising field. we conclude that the foreground quasarsshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening ofthe uv radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for qsoj23495-4338.thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also inoverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the hi forest.furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiativetransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observedspectral shape variations. from the transverse proximity effect ofqsoj23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 myr.

0706.2759	molecular gas in nearby low-luminosity qso host galaxies	this paper addresses the global molecular gas properties of a representativesample of galaxies hosting low-luminosity quasistellar objects. an abundantsupply of gas is necessary to fuel both the active galactic nucleus and anycircum-nuclear starburst activity of qsos.  we selected a sample of nearby low-luminosity qso host galaxies that is freeof infrared excess biases. all objects are drawn from the hamburg-eso surveyfor bright uv-excess qsos, have dec&gt;-30 degrees and redshifts that do notexceed z=0.06. the iram 30m telescope was used to measure the co(1-0) andco(2-1) transition in parallel.  27 out of 39 galaxies in the sample have been detected. the molecular gasmasses of the detected sources range from 0.4e9 m_sun to 9.7e9 m_sun. we canconfirm that the majority of galaxies hosting low-luminosity qsos are rich inmolecular gas. the properties of galaxies hosting brighter type i agn andcircumnuclear starformation regions differ from the properties of galaxies withfainter central regions. the overall supply of molecular gas and the spread ofthe line width distribution is larger. when comparing the far-infrared with theco luminosities, the distribution can be separated into two differentpower-laws: one describing the lower activity seyfert i population and thesecond describing the luminous qso population. the separation in thel_fir/l'_co behavior may be explainable with differing degrees of compactnessof the emission regions. we provide a simple model to describe the twopower-laws. the sample studied in this paper is located in a transition regionbetween the two populations.

0904.3066	barred galaxies in the abell 901/2 supercluster with stages	we present a study of bar and host disk evolution in a dense clusterenvironment, based on a sample of ~800 bright (mv &lt;= -18) galaxies in the abell901/2 supercluster at z~0.165. we use hst acs f606w imaging from the stagessurvey, and data from spitzer, xmm-newton, and combo-17. we identify andcharacterize bars through ellipse-fitting, and other morphological featuresthrough visual classification. (1) we explore three commonly used methods forselecting disk galaxies. we find 625, 485, and 353 disk galaxies, respectively,via visual classification, a single component s'ersic cut (n &lt;= 2.5), and ablue-cloud cut. in cluster environments, the latter two methods miss 31% and51%, respectively, of visually-identified disks. (2) for moderately inclineddisks, the three methods of disk selection yield a similar global optical barfraction (f_bar-opt) of 34% +10%/-3%, 31% +10%/-3%, and 30% +10%/-3%,respectively. (3) f_bar-opt rises in brighter galaxies and those which appearto have no significant bulge component. within a given absolute magnitude bin,f_bar-opt is higher in visually-selected disk galaxies that have no bulge asopposed to those with bulges. for a given morphological class, f_bar-opt risesat higher luminosities. (4) for bright early-types, as well as faint late-typesystems with no evident bulge, the optical bar fraction in the abell 901/2clusters is comparable within a factor of 1.1 to 1.4 to that of field galaxiesat lower redshifts (5) between the core and the virial radius of the cluster atintermediate environmental densities, the optical bar fraction does not appearto depend strongly on the local environment density and varies at most by afactor of ~1.3. we discuss the implications of our results for the evolution ofbars and disks in dense environments.

0910.5718	interacting galaxies in the a901/902 supercluster with stages	we present a study of galaxy mergers and the influence of environment in theabell 901/902 supercluster at z~0.165. we use hst acs f606w data from thestages survey, combo-17, spitzer 24um, and xmm-newton x-ray data. our analysisutilizes both a visual classification system, and quantitative cas parametersto identify systems which show evidence of a recent or ongoing merger of massratio &gt;1/10. our results are: (1) after visual classification and minimizingthe contamination from false projection pairs, we find that the merger fractionf_merge is 0.023+/-0.007. the estimated fractions of likely major mergers,likely minor mergers, and ambiguous cases are 0.01+/-0.004, 0.006+/-0.003, and0.007+/-0.003, respectively. (2) the mergers lie outside the cluster core ofradius r &lt; 0.25 mpc: the lack of mergers in the core is likely due to the largegalaxy velocity dispersion in the core. mergers populate the region (0.25 mpc &lt;r &lt;= 2 mpc) between the core and outskirt. in this region, the estimatedfrequency of mergers is similar to those seen at typical group overdensities.this suggests ongoing growth of the clusters via accretion of group and fieldgalaxies. (3) we compare our observed merger fraction with those reported inother clusters and groups out to z~0.4. existing data points on the mergerfraction for l&lt;= l* galaxies in clusters allow for a range of evolutionaryscenarios. (4) the fraction of mergers, which lie on the blue cloud is80%+/-18% versus 34%+/-7% for non-interacting galaxies, implying thatinteracting galaxies are preferentially blue. (5) the average sfr, based on uvor uv+ir data, is enhanced by a factor of ~1.5 to 2 in mergers compared tonon-interacting galaxies. however, mergers in the clusters contribute only asmall fraction (between 10% and 15%) of the total sfr density.(abridged)

0911.0704	relating basic properties of bright early-type dwarf galaxies to their  location in abell 901/902	we present a study of the population of bright early-type dwarf galaxies inthe multiple-cluster system abell 901/902. we use data from the stages surveyand combo-17 to investigate the relation between the color and structuralproperties of the dwarfs and their location in the cluster. the definition ofthe dwarf sample is based on the central surface brightness and includesgalaxies in the luminosity range -16 &gt;= m_b &gt;~-19 mag. using a fit to the colormagnitude relation of the dwarfs, our sample is divided into a red and bluesubsample. we find a color-density relation in the projected radialdistribution of the dwarf sample: at the same luminosity dwarfs with reddercolors are located closer to the cluster centers than their bluer counterparts.furthermore, the redder dwarfs are on average more compact and rounder than thebluer dwarfs. these findings are consistent with theoretical expectationsassuming that bright early-type dwarfs are the remnants of transformedlate-type disk galaxies involving processes such as ram pressure stripping andgalaxy harassment. this indicates that a considerable fraction of dwarfelliptical galaxies in clusters are the results of transformation processesrelated to interactions with their host cluster.

1002.1067	barred disks in dense environments	we investigate the properties of bright (mv &lt;= -18) barred and unbarred disksin the abell 901/902 cluster system at z~0.165 with the stages hst acs survey.to identify and characterize bars, we use ellipse-fitting. we use visualclassification, a sersic cut, and a color cut to select disk galaxies, and findthat the latter two methods miss 31% and 51%, respectively of disk galaxiesidentified through visual classification. this underscores the importance ofcarefully selecting the disk sample in cluster environments. however, we findthat the global optical bar fraction in the clusters is ~30% regardless of themethod of disk selection. we study the relationship of the optical bar fractionto host galaxy properties, and find that the optical bar fraction dependsstrongly on the luminosity of the galaxy and whether it hosts a prominent bulgeor is bulgeless. within a given absolute magnitude bin, the optical barfraction increases for galaxies with no significant bulge component. withineach morphological type bin, the optical bar fraction increases for brightergalaxies. we find no strong trend (variations larger than a factor of 1.3) forthe optical bar fraction with local density within the cluster between the coreand virial radius (r ~ 0.25 to 1.2 mpc). we discuss the implications of ourresults for the evolution of bars and disks in dense environments.

1005.2959	mapping the ionised gas around the luminous qso he 1029-1401: evidence  for minor merger events?	we present vimos integral field spectroscopy of the brightest radio-quiet qsoon the southern sky he 1029-1401 at a redshift of z=0.086. standarddecomposition techniques for broad-band imaging are extended to integral fielddata in order to deblend the qso and host emission. we perform a tentativeanalysis of the stellar continuum finding a young stellar population (&lt;100myr)or a featureless continuum embedded in an old stellar population (10gyr)typical for a massive elliptical galaxy. the stellar velocity dispersion ofsigma_*=320\pm90 km/s and the estimated black hole masslog(m_bh/m_sun)=8.7\pm0.3 are consistent with the local m_bh-sigma_* relationwithin the errors. for the first time we map the two-dimensional ionised gasdistribution and the gas velocity field around he 1029-1401. while the stellarhost morphology is purely elliptical we find a highly structured distributionof ionised gas out to 16 kpc from the qso. the gas is highly ionised solely bythe qso radiation and has a significantly lower metallicity than would beexpected for the stellar mass of the host, indicating an external origin of thegas most likely due to minor mergers. we find a rotating gas disc around theqso and a dispersion-dominated non-rotating gas component within the central 3kpc. at larger distances the velocity field is heavily disturbed, which couldbe interpreted as another signature of past minor merger events. alternatively,the arc-like structure seen in the ionised gas might also be indicative of alarge-scale expanding bubble, centred on and possibly driven by the activenucleus.

1006.4385	vlt lbg redshift survey ii: interactions between galaxies and the igm at  z ~3	we have measured redshifts for 243 z ~3 quasars in nine vlt vimos lbgredshift survey areas, each of which is centred on a known bright quasar. usingspectra of these quasars, we measure the cross-correlation between neutralhydrogen gas causing the lya forest and 1020 lyman-break galaxies at z ~3. wefind an increase in neutral hydrogen absorption within 5 h^-1 mpc of a galaxyin agreement with the results of adelberger et al. (2003, 2005). the lya-lbgcross-correlation can be described by a power-law on scales larger than 3 h^-1mpc. when galaxy velocity dispersions are taken into account our results atsmaller scales (&lt;2 h^-1 mpc) are also in good agreement with the results ofadelberger et al. (2005). there is little immediate indication of a region witha transmission spike above the mean igm value which might indicate the presenceof star-formation feedback. to measure the galaxy velocity dispersions, whichinclude both intrinsic lbg velocity dispersion and redshift errors, we haveused the lbg-lbg redshift space distortion measurements of bielby et al.(2010). we find that the redshift-space transmission spike implied in theresults of adelberger et al. (2003) is too narrow to be physical in thepresence of the likely lbg velocity dispersion and is likely to be astatistical fluke. nevertheless, neither our nor previous data can rule out thepresence of a narrow, real-space transmission spike, given the evidence of theincreased lya absorption surrounding lbgs which can mask the spike's presencewhen convolved with a realistic lbg velocity dispersion. finally, we identify176 civ systems in the quasar spectra and find an lbg-civ correlation strengthon scales of 10 h^-1 mpc consistent with the relation measured at ~mpc scales.

1109.3309	the low-metallicity qso he 2158-0107: a massive galaxy growing by the  accretion of nearly pristine gas from its environment?	[abridged] the metallicities of agn are usually well above solar in theirnlr, often reaching up to several times solar in their broad-line regions.low-metallicity agn are rare objects which have so far always been associatedwith low-mass galaxies hosting low-mass bhs (m_bh&lt;10^6msun). in this paper wepresent ifs data of the low-redshift qso he 2158-0107 for which we find strongevidence for sub-solar nlr metallicities associated with a massive bh(m_bh~3x10^8msun). the qso is surrounded by a large extended emission-lineregion reaching out to 30kpc from the qso in a tail-like geometry. we presentoptical and near-ir images and investigate the properties of the host galaxy.the sed of the host is rather blue, indicative of a significant young agestellar population formed within the last 1gyr. a 3sigma upper limit ofl_bulge&lt;4.5x10^10lsun for the h band luminosity and a corresponding stellarmass upper limit of m_bulge&lt;3.4x10^10msun show that the host is offset from thelocal bh-bulge relations. this is independently supported by the kinematics ofthe gas. although the stellar mass of the host galaxy is lower than expected,it cannot explain the exceptionally low metallicity of the gas. we suggest thatthe extended emission-line region and the galaxy growth are caused by theinfall of nearly pristine gas from the environment of the qso host. minormergers of dwarf galaxies or the theoretically predicted smooth accretion ofcold gas are both potential drivers behind that process. since the metallicityof the gas in the nlr is much lower than expected, we suspect that the externalgas has already reached the galaxy centre and may even contribute to thecurrent feeding of the bh. he 2158-0107 appears to represent a particular phaseof substantial bh and galaxy growth that can be observationally linked with theaccretion of external material from its environment.

1301.1679	the evolution of galaxies resolved in space and time: an inside-out  growth view from the califa survey	the growth of galaxies is one of the key problems in understanding thestructure and evolution of the universe and its constituents. galaxies can growtheir stellar mass by accretion of halo or intergalactic gas clouds, or bymerging with smaller or similar mass galaxies. the gas available translatesinto a rate of star formation, which controls the generation of metals in theuniverse. the spatially resolved history of their stellar mass assembly has notbeen obtained so far for any given galaxy beyond the local group. here wedemonstrate how massive galaxies grow their stellar mass inside-out. we reportthe results from the analysis of the first 105 galaxies of the largest to datethree-dimensional spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the local universe(califa). we apply the fossil record method of stellar population spectralsynthesis to recover the spatially and time resolved star formation history ofeach galaxy. we show, for the first time, that the signal of downsizing isspatially preserved, with both inner and outer regions growing faster for moremassive galaxies. further, we show that the relative growth rate of thespheroidal component, nucleus and inner galaxy, that happened 5-7 gyr ago,shows a maximum at a critical stellar mass ~10^10 msun. we also find thatgalaxies less massive than ~10^10 msun show a transition to outside-in growth,thus connecting with results from resolved studies of the growth of low massgalaxies.

0712.3289	is agn feedback necessary to form red elliptical galaxies?	we have used gadget2 to simulate the formation of an elliptical galaxy in acosmological dark matter halo with mass 3x10^12m_sun/h. using a stellarpopulation synthesis model has allowed us to compute magnitudes, colours andsurface brightness profiles. we have included a model to follow the growth of acentral black hole and we have compared the results of simulations with andwithout feedback from agns. we have studied the interplay between cold gasaccretion and merging in the development of galactic morphologies, the linkbetween colour and morphology evolution, the effect of agn feedback on thephotometry of early type galaxies, the redshift evolution in the properties ofquasar hosts, and the impact of agn winds on the chemical enrichment of theintergalactic medium (igm). we have found that the early phases of galaxyformation are driven by the accretion of cold filamentary flows, which form adisc at the centre of the dark matter halo. when the dark matter halo issufficiently massive to support the propagation of a stable shock, coldaccretion is shut down, and the star formation rate begins to decline. mergerstransform the disc into an elliptical galaxy, but also bring gas into thegalaxy. without a mechanism that removes gas from the merger remnants, thegalaxy ends up with blue colours, atypical for its elliptical morphology. agnfeedback can solve this problem even with a fairly low heating efficiency. wehave also demonstrated that agn winds are potentially important for the metalenrichment of the igm a high redshift.(abridged)

1304.1644	aperture corrections for disk galaxy properties derived from the califa  survey. balmer emission lines in spiral galaxies	this work investigates the effect of the aperture size on derived galaxyproperties for which we have spatially-resolved optical spectra. we focus onsome indicators of star formation activity and dust attenuation for spiralgalaxies that have been widely used in previous work on galaxy evolution. wehave used 104 spiral galaxies from the califa survey for which 2d spectroscopywith complete spatial coverage is available. from the 3d cubes we have derivedgrowth curves of the most conspicuous balmer emission lines (halpha, hbeta) forcircular apertures of different radii centered at the galaxy's nucleus afterremoving the underlying stellar continuum. we find that the halpha flux(f(halpha)) growth curve follows a well defined sequence with aperture radiusshowing low dispersion around the median value. from this analysis, we deriveaperture corrections for galaxies in different magnitude and redshiftintervals. once stellar absorption is properly accounted for, thef(halpha)/f(hbeta) ratio growth curve shows a smooth decline, pointing towardsthe absence of differential dust attenuation as a function of radius. aperturecorrections as a function of the radius are provided in the interval[0.3,2.5]r_50. finally, the halpha equivalent width (ew(halpha)) growth curveincreases with the size of the aperture and shows a very large dispersion forsmall apertures. this large dispersion prevents the use of reliable aperturecorrections for this quantity. in addition, this result suggests thatseparating star-forming and quiescent galaxies based on observed ew(halpha)through small apertures is likely to result in low ew(halpha) star-forminggalaxies begin classified as quiescent.

1306.2338	nebular emission and the lyman continuum photon escape fraction in  califa early-type galaxies	we use deep integral field spectroscopy data from the califa survey to studythe warm interstellar medium (wim) of 32 nearby early-type galaxies (etgs). wepropose a tentative subdivision of our sample etgs into two groups, accordingto their ha equivalent width (ew) and lyman continuum (lyc) photon escapefraction (plf). type i etgs show nearly constant ews and a plf~0, suggestingthat photoionization by post-agb stars is the main driver of their faintextranuclear nebular emission. type ii etgs are characterized by very low,outwardly increasing ews, and a plf as large as ~0.9 in their centers. suchproperties point to a low, and inwardly decreasing wim density and/or volumefilling factor. we argue that, because of extensive lyc photon leakage,emission-line luminosities and ews are reduced in type ii etg nuclei by atleast one order of magnitude. consequently, the line weakness of these etgs isby itself no compelling evidence for their containing merely "weak"(sub-eddington accreting) active galactic nuclei (agn). in fact, lyc photonescape, which has heretofore not been considered, may constitute a key elementin understanding why many etgs with prominent signatures of agn activity inradio continuum and/or x-ray wavelengths show only faint emission lines andweak signatures of agn activity in their optical spectra. the lyc photonescape, in conjunction with dilution of nuclear ews by line-of-sightintegration through a triaxial stellar host, can systematically impededetection of agn in gas-poor galaxy spheroids through optical emission-linespectroscopy. we further find that type i and ii etgs differ little (~0.4 dex)in their mean bpt line ratios, which in both cases are characteristic ofliners. this potentially hints at a degeneracy of the projected,luminosity-weighted bpt ratios for the specific 3d properties of the wim inetgs.

1308.4271	the nature of liner galaxies: ubiquitous hot old stars and rare  accreting black holes	galaxies, which often contain ionised gas, sometimes also exhibit a so-calledlow-ionisation nuclear emission line region (liner). for 30 years this wasattributed to a central mass-accreting supermassive black hole (agn) of lowluminosity, making liner galaxies the largest agn-sub-population, dominating innumbers over higher luminosity seyfert galaxies and quasars. this, however,poses a serious problem. while the inferred energy balance is plausible, manyliners clearly do not contain any other independent signatures of an agn. usingintegral field spectroscopic data from the califa survey, we aim at comparingthe observed radial surface brightness profiles with what is expected fromillumination by an agn. essential for this analysis is a proper extraction ofemission-lines, especially weak lines such as the balmer hb line which issuperposed on an absorption trough. to accomplish this, we use the gandalf codewhich simultaneously fits the underlying stellar continuum and emission lines.we show for 48 galaxies with liner-like emission, that the radial emission-linesurface brightness profiles are inconsistent with ionisation by a centralpoint-source and hence cannot be due to an agn alone. the most probableexplanation for the excess liner-like emission is ionisation by evolved starsduring the short but very hot and energetic phase known as post-agb. this leadsus to an entirely new interpretation. post-agb stars are ubiquitous and theirionising effect should be potentially observable in every galaxy with gaspresent and stars older than ~1 gyr, unless a stronger radiation field fromyoung hot stars or an agn outshines them. this means that galaxies withliner-like emission are in fact not a class defined by a property, but ratherby the absence of a property. it also explains why liner emission is observedmostly in massive galaxies with old stars and little star formation.

1310.5517	the star formation history of califa galaxies: radial structures	we study the radial structure of the stellar mass surface density ($\mu$) andstellar population age as a function of the total stellar mass and morphologyfor a sample of 107 galaxies from the califa survey. we use the fossil recordto recover the star formation history (sfh) in spheroidal and disk dominatedgalaxies with masses from 10$^9$ to 10$^{12}$ m$_\odot$. we derive the halfmass radius, and we find that galaxies are on average 15% more compact in massthan in light. hmr/hlr decreases with increasing mass for disk galaxies, but isalmost constant in spheroidal galaxies. we find that the galaxy-averagedstellar population age, stellar extinction, and $\mu$ are well represented bytheir values at 1 hlr. negative radial gradients of the stellar population agessupport an inside-out formation. the larger inner age gradients occur in themost massive disk galaxies that have the most prominent bulges; shallower agegradients are obtained in spheroids of similar mass. disk and spheroidalgalaxies show negative $\mu$ gradients that steepen with stellar mass. inspheroidal galaxies $\mu$ saturates at a critical value that is independent ofthe galaxy mass. thus, all the massive spheroidal galaxies have similar local$\mu$ at the same radius (in hlr units). the sfh of the regions beyond 1 hlrare well correlated with their local $\mu$, and follow the same relation as thegalaxy-averaged age and $\mu$; suggesting that local stellar mass surfacedensity preserves the sfh of disks. the sfh of bulges are, however, morefundamentally related to the total stellar mass, since the radial structure ofthe stellar age changes with galaxy mass even though all the spheroid dominatedgalaxies have similar radial structure in $\mu$. thus, galaxy mass is a morefundamental property in spheroidal systems while the local stellar mass surfacedensity is more important in disks.

1311.3941	the effects of spatial resolution on integral field spectrograph surveys  at different redshifts. the califa perspective	over the past decade, 3d optical spectroscopy has become the preferred toolfor understanding the properties of galaxies and is now increasingly used tocarry out galaxy surveys. low redshift surveys include sauron, diskmass,atlas3d, pings and venga. at redshifts above 0.7, surveys such as massiv, sins,glace, and images have targeted the most luminous galaxies to study mainlytheir kinematic properties. the on-going califa survey ($z\sim0.02$) is thefirst of a series of upcoming integral field spectroscopy (ifs) surveys withlarge samples representative of the entire population of galaxies. othersinclude sami and manga at lower redshift and the upcoming kmos surveys athigher redshift. given the importance of spatial scales in ifs surveys, thestudy of the effects of spatial resolution on the recovered parameters becomesimportant. we explore the capability of the califa survey and a hypotheticalhigher redshift survey to reproduce the properties of a sample of objectsobserved with better spatial resolution at lower redshift. using a sample ofpings galaxies, we simulate observations at different redshifts. we then studythe behaviour of different parameters as the spatial resolution degrades withincreasing redshift.

1311.7052	a characteristic oxygen abundance gradient in galaxy disks unveiled with  califa	we present the largest and most homogeneous catalog of hii regions andassociations compiled so far. the catalog comprises more than 7000 ionizedregions, extracted from 306 galaxies observed by the califa survey. we describethe procedures used to detect, select, and analyse the spectroscopic propertiesof these ionized regions. in the current study we focus on the characterizationof the radial gradient of the oxygen abundance in the ionized gas, based on thestudy of the deprojected distribution of hii regions. we found that allgalaxies without clear evidence of an interaction present a common gradient inthe oxygen abundance, with a characteristic slope of alpha = -0.1 dex/rebetween 0.3 and 2 disk effective radii, and a scatter compatible with randomfluctuations around this value, when the gradient is normalized to the diskeffective radius. the slope is independent of morphology, incidence of bars,absolute magnitude or mass. only those galaxies with evidence of interactionsand/or clear merging systems present a significant shallower gradient,consistent with previous results. the majority of the 94 galaxies with h iiregions detected beyond 2 disk effective radii present a flattening in theoxygen abundance. the flattening is statistically significant. we cannotprovide with a conclusive answer regarding the origin of this flattening.however, our results indicate that its origin is most probably related to thesecular evolution of galaxies. finally, we find a drop/truncation of the oxygenabundance in the inner regions for 26 of the galaxies. all of them arenon-interacting, mostly unbarred, sb/sbc galaxies. this feature is associatedwith a central star-forming ring, which suggests that both features areproduced by radial gas flows induced by resonance processes.

(2) for m&gt;=1e9 msunsystems, the average star formation rate (sfr) of strongly disturbed systems isonly modestly enhanced with respect to normal galaxies, in agreement withrecent simulations. in fact, over z~0.24 to 0.80, strongly disturbed systemsonly account for a small fraction (&lt;~30%) of the total sfr density. thissuggests that the behaviour of the cosmic sfr density over the last sevenbillion years is predominantly shaped by normal galaxies.

1406.4131	integral field spectroscopy of nearby qsos: i. enlr size-luminosity  relation, ongoing star formation &amp; resolved gas-phase metallicities	[abridged] we present optical integral field spectroscopy for a flux-limitedsample of 19 qsos at z&lt;0.2 and spatially resolve their ionized gas propertiesat a physical resolution of 2-5kpc. the extended narrow line regions (enlrs),photoionized by the radiation of agn, have sizes of up to several kpc andcorrelate more strongly with the qso continuum luminosity than with theintegrated [oiii] luminosity. we find a relation of the formlog(r)~(0.46+-0.04)log(l_5100), reinforcing the picture of an approximatelyconstant ionization parameter for the ionized clouds across the enlr. besidesthe enlr, we also find gas ionized by young massive stars in more than 50 percent of the galaxies on kpc scales. in more than half of the sample, thespecific star formation rates based on the extinction-corrected ha luminosityare consistent with those of inactive disc-dominated galaxies, even for somebulge-dominated qso hosts. enhanced sfrs of up to 70msun/yr are rare and alwaysassociated with signatures of major mergers. comparison with the sfr based onthe 60+100micron fir luminosity suggests that the fir luminosity issystematically contaminated by agn emission and ha appears to be a more robustand sensitive tracer for the star formation rate. evidence for efficient agnfeedback is scarce in our sample, but some of our qso hosts lack signatures ofongoing star formation leading to a reduced specific sfr with respect to themain sequence of galaxies. based on 12 qsos where we can make measurements, wefind that on average bulge-dominated qso host galaxies tend to fall below themass-metallicity relation compared to their disc-dominated counterparts. whilenot yet statistically significant for our small sample, this may provide auseful diagnostic for future large surveys if this metal dilution can be shownto be linked to recent or ongoing galaxy interactions.

1407.0002	stellar population gradients in galaxy discs from the califa survey	while studies of gas-phase metallicity gradients in disc galaxies are common,very little has been done in the acquisition of stellar abundance gradients inthe same regions. we present here a comparative study of the stellarmetallicity and age distributions in a sample of 62 nearly face-on, spiralgalaxies with and without bars, using data from the califa survey. we measurethe slopes of the gradients and study their relation with other properties ofthe galaxies. we find that the mean stellar age and metallicity gradients inthe disc are shallow and negative. furthermore, when normalized to theeffective radius of the disc, the slope of the stellar population gradientsdoes not correlate with the mass or with the morphological type of thegalaxies. contrary to this, the values of both age and metallicity at $\sim$2.5scale-lengths correlate with the central velocity dispersion in a similarmanner to the central values of the bulges, although bulges show, on average,older ages and higher metallicities than the discs. one of the goals of thepresent paper is to test the theoretical prediction that non-linear couplingbetween the bar and the spiral arms is an efficient mechanism for producingradial migrations across significant distances within discs. the process ofradial migration should flatten the stellar metallicity gradient with time and,therefore, we would expect flatter stellar metallicity gradients in barredgalaxies. however, we do not find any difference in the metallicity or agegradients in galaxies with without bars. we discuss possible scenarios that canlead to this absence of difference.

1407.1315	insights on the stellar mass-metallicity relation from the califa survey	we use spatially and temporally resolved maps of stellar populationproperties of 300 galaxies from the califa integral field survey to investigatehow the stellar metallicity (z*) relates to the total stellar mass (m*) and thelocal mass surface density ($\mu$*) in both spheroidal and disk dominatedgalaxies. the galaxies are shown to follow a clear stellar mass-metallicityrelation (mzr) over the whole 10$^9$ to 10$^{12}$ m$_{\odot}$ range. thisrelation is steeper than the one derived from nebular abundances, which issimilar to the flatter stellar mzr derived when we consider only young stars.we also find a strong relation between the local values of $\mu$* and z* (the$\mu$zr), betraying the influence of local factors in determining z*. thisshows that both local ($\mu$*-driven) and global (m*-driven) processes areimportant in determining the metallicity in galaxies. we find that the overallbalance between local and global effects varies with the location within agalaxy. in disks, $\mu$* regulates z*, producing a strong $\mu$zr whoseamplitude is modulated by m*. in spheroids it is m* who dominates the physicsof star formation and chemical enrichment, with $\mu$* playing a minor,secondary role. these findings agree with our previous analysis of the starformation histories of califa galaxies, which showed that mean stellar ages aremainly governed by surface density in galaxy disks and by total mass inspheroids.

1407.2939	califa: a diameter-selected sample for an integral field spectroscopy  galaxy survey	we describe and discuss the selection procedure and statistical properties ofthe galaxy sample used by the calar alto legacy integral field area survey(califa), a public legacy survey of 600 galaxies using integral fieldspectroscopy. the califa "mother sample" was selected from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) dr7 photometric catalogue to include all galaxies with anr-band isophotal major axis between 45" and 79.2" and with a redshift 0.005 &lt; z&lt; 0.03. the mother sample contains 939 objects, 600 of which will be observedin the course of the califa survey. the selection of targets for observationsis based solely on visibility and thus keeps the statistical properties of themother sample. by comparison with a large set of sdss galaxies, we find thatthe califa sample is representative of galaxies over a luminosity range of -19&gt; mr &gt; -23.1 and over a stellar mass range between 10^9.7 and 10^11.4msun. inparticular, within these ranges, the diameter selection does not lead to anysignificant bias against - or in favour of - intrinsically large or smallgalaxies. only below luminosities of mr = -19 (or stellar masses &lt; 10^9.7msun)is there a prevalence of galaxies with larger isophotal sizes, especially ofnearly edge-on late-type galaxies, but such galaxies form &lt; 10% of the fullsample. we estimate volume-corrected distribution functions in luminosities andsizes and show that these are statistically fully compatible with estimatesfrom the full sdss when accounting for large-scale structure. we also present anumber of value-added quantities determined for the galaxies in the califasample. we explore different ways of characterizing the environments of califagalaxies, finding that the sample covers environmental conditions from thefield to genuine clusters. we finally consider the expected incidence of activegalactic nuclei among califa galaxies.

1501.05498	bar pattern speeds in califa galaxies: i. fast bars across the hubble  sequence	the bar pattern speed ($\omega_{\rm b}$) is defined as the rotationalfrequency of the bar, and it determines the bar dynamics. several methods havebeen proposed for measuring $\omega_{\rm b}$. the non-parametric methodproposed by tremaine \&amp; weinberg (1984; tw) and based on stellar kinematics isthe most accurate. this method has been applied so far to 17 galaxies, most ofthem sb0 and sba types. we have applied the tw method to a new sample of 15strong and bright barred galaxies, spanning a wide range of morphological typesfrom sb0 to sbbc. combining our analysis with previous studies, we investigate32 barred galaxies with their pattern speed measured by the tw method. theresulting total sample of barred galaxies allows us to study the dependence of$\omega_{\rm b}$ on galaxy properties, such as the hubble type. we measured$\omega_{\rm b}$ using the tw method on the stellar velocity maps provided bythe integral-field spectroscopy data from the califa survey. integral-fielddata solve the problems that long-slit data present when applying the twmethod, resulting in the determination of more accurate $\omega_{\rm b}$. inaddition, we have also derived the ratio $\cal{r}$ of the corotation radius tothe bar length of the galaxies. according to this parameter, bars can beclassified as fast ($\cal{r}$ $&lt; 1.4$) and slow ($\cal{r}$&gt;1.4). for all thegalaxies, $\cal{r}$ is compatible within the errors with fast bars. we cannotrule out (at 95$\%$ level) the fast bar solution for any galaxy. we have notobserved any significant trend between $\cal{r}$ and the galaxy morphologicaltype. our results indicate that independent of the hubble type, bars have beenformed and then evolve as fast rotators. this observational result willconstrain the scenarios of formation and evolution of bars proposed bynumerical simulations.

0806.2532	a slitless spectroscopic survey for quasars near quasars	we present the results of the quasars near quasars (qnq) survey, a ccd-basedslitless spectroscopic survey for faint v&lt;22 quasars at 1.7&lt;z&lt;3.6 on 1826.2'x33.5' fields centred on bright quasars at 2.76&lt;z&lt;4.69. in total 169quasar candidates with emission lines were selected from the extractedflux-calibrated spectra on the basis of well-defined automatic selectioncriteria followed by visual inspection and verification. with follow-upspectroscopy of 81 candidates that were likely to reside at z&gt;1.7 we were ableto confirm 80 new quasars at 0.580&lt;z&lt;3.586 on 16 of our fields. 64 of the newlydiscovered quasars are located at z&gt;1.7. the overall high success rate impliesthat most of the remaining 88 candidates are quasars as well, although themajority of them likely resides at z&lt;1.7 on the basis of the observed lineshapes and strengths. due to the insufficient depth of the input sourcecatalogues needed for extraction of the slitless spectra our survey is not welldefined in terms of limiting magnitude for faint 2.5&lt;z&lt;3.6 quasars whose lymanalpha emission is detectable well beyond v=22, albeit at a continuum s/n&lt;1.while not useful for characterising the evolving space density of quasars, oursample provides many new closely spaced quasar sightlines around intenselystudied quasars for further investigations on the three-dimensionaldistribution of the intergalactic medium.

astro-ph;0011453	the stellar content of the hamburg/eso survey. i. automated selection of  da white dwarfs	we describe automatic procedures for the selection of da white dwarfs in thehamburg/eso objective-prism survey (hes). for this purpose, and the selectionof other stellar objects (e.g., metal-poor stars and carbon stars), a flexible,robust algorithm for detection of stellar absorption and emission lines in thedigital spectra of the hes was developed. broad band (u-b, b-v) and narrow band(str\"omgren c_1) colours can be derived directly from hes spectra, withprecisions of sigma(u-b)=0.092mag; sigma(b-v)=0.095mag; sigma(c_1)=0.15mag.  we describe simulation techniques that allow to convert model or slit spectrato hes spectra. these simulated objective-prism spectra are used to determinequantitative selection criteria, and for the study of selection functions. wepresent an atlas of simulated hes spectra of da and db white dwarfs.  our current selection algorithm is tuned to yield maximum efficiency of thecandidate sample (minimum contamination with non-das). da candidates areselected in the b-v versus u-b and c_1 versus w_\lambda(hbeta+hgamma+hdelta)parameter spaces. the contamination of the resulting sample with hot subdwarfsis expected to be as low as ~8%, while there is essentially no contaminationwith main sequence or horizontal branch stars. we estimate that with thepresent set of criteria, ~80% of das present in the hes database are recovered.a yet higher degree of internal completeness could be reached at the expense ofhigher contamination. however, the external completeness is limited byadditional losses caused by proper motion effects and the epoch differencesbetween direct and spectral plates used in the hes.

astro-ph;0208514	on-axis spatially resolved spectroscopy of low redshift quasar host  galaxies: he 1503+0228 at z=0.135	we present the first result of a comprehensive spectroscopic study of quasarhost galaxies. on-axis, spatially resolved spectra of low redshift quasars havebeen obtained with fors1, mounted on the 8.2m eso very large telescope, antu.the spectra are spatially deconvolved using a spectroscopic version of the``mcs deconvolution algorithm''. the algorithm decomposes two dimensionalspectra into the individual spectra of the central point-like nucleus and ofits host galaxy. applied to he1503+0228, at z=0.135 (m_b=-23.0), it provides uswith the spectrum of the host galaxy between 3600a, and 8500a, (rest-frame), ata mean resolving power of 700. the data allow us to measure several of theimportant lick indices. the stellar populations and gas ionization state of thehost galaxy of he1503+0228, are very similar to the ones measured for normalnon-agn galaxies. dynamical information is also available for the gas andstellar components of the galaxy. using deconvolution and a deprojectionalgorithm, velocity curves are derived for emission lines, from the center upto 4arcsec, away from the nucleus of the galaxy. fitting a simplethree-components mass model (point mass, spherical halo of dark matter, disk)to the position-velocity diagram, we infer a mass of m(r&lt;1kpc) = (2.0 +- 0.3)10^{10} solar mass within the central kiloparsec of the galaxy, and a massintegrated over 10 kpc of m(r&lt;10kpc) = (1.9 +- 0.3) 10^{11} solar mass, with anadditional 10% error due to the uncertainty on the inclination of the galaxy.this, in combination with the analysis of the stellar populations indicatesthat the host galaxy of he1503+0228, is a normal spiral galaxy.

astro-ph;0304072	the evolution of faint agn between z~1 and z~5 from the combo-17 survey	we present a determination of the optical/uv agn luminosity function and itsevolution, based on a large sample of faint (r&lt;24) qsos identified in thecombo-17 survey. using multi-band photometry in 17 filters within 350nm &lt;lambda_obs &lt; 930nm, we could simultaneously determine photometric redshiftswith an accuracy of sigma_z&lt;0.03 and obtain spectral energy distributions. theredshift range covered by the sample is 1.2&lt;z&lt;4.8, which implies that even atz~3, the sample reaches below luminosities corresponding to m_b = -23,conventionally employed to distinguish between seyfert galaxies and quasars. weclearly detect a broad plateau-like maximum of quasar activity around z~2 andmap out the smooth turnover between z~1 and z~4. the shape of the lf ischaracterised by some mild curvature, but no sharp `break' is present withinthe range of luminosities covered. using only the combo-17 data, the evolvinglf can be adequately described by either a pure density evolution (pde) or apure luminosity evolution (ple) model. however, the absence of a strong l*-likefeature in the shape of the lf inhibits a robust distinction between thesemodes. we present a robust estimate for the integrated uv luminosity generationby agn as a function of redshift. we find that the lf continues to rise even atthe lowest luminosities probed by our survey, but that the slope issufficiently shallow that the contribution of low-luminosity agn to the uvluminosity density is negligible. although our sample reaches much fainter fluxlevels than previous data sets, our results on space densities and lf slopesare completely consistent with extrapolations from recent major surveys such assdss and 2qz.

astro-ph;0307147	integral-field spectroscopy of the quadruple qso he 0435-1223: evidence  for microlensing	we present the first spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of therecently discovered quadruple qso and gravitational lens he0435-1223. using thepotsdam multi-aperture spectrophotometer (pmas), we show that all four qsocomponents have very similar but not identical spectra. in particular, thespectral slopes of components a, b, and d are indistinguishable, implying thatextinction due to dust plays no major role in the lensing galaxy. while alsothe emission line profiles are identical within the error bars, as expectedfrom lensing, the equivalent widths show significant differences betweencomponents. most likely, microlensing is responsible for this phenomenon. thisis also consistent with the fact that component d, which shows the highestrelative continuum level, has brightened by 0.07 mag since dec 2001. we findthat the emission line flux ratios between the components are in betteragreement with simple lens models than broad band or continuum measurements,but that the discrepancies between model and data are still unacceptably large.finally, we present a detection of the lensing galaxy, although this is closeto the limits of the data. comparing with a model galaxy spectrum, we obtain aredshift estimate of z_lens=0.44+-0.02.

astro-ph;0311123	quasar host galaxy star formation activity from multicolour data	we investigate multicolour imaging data of a complete sample of 19 lowredshift (z&lt;0.2) quasar host galaxies. the sample was imaged in four optical(bvri) and three near-infrared bands (jhk_s). galaxy types, structuralparameters and robust host galaxy luminosities are extracted for all bands bymeans of two-dimensional deblending of galaxy and nucleus. for the discdominated fraction of host galaxies (sa and later) the optical andoptical-to-nir colours agree well with the average colours of inactive galaxiesof same type. the bulge dominated galaxies (e/s0) on the other hand appear asignificant 0.35 mag bluer in (v-k) than their inactive counterparts, being asblue as the discs in the sample. this trend is confirmed by fitting populationsynthesis models to the extracted broad band seds: the stellar population ageof the bulge dominated hosts lies around a few gyr, much younger than expectedfor old evolved ellipticals. comparison to other studies suggests a strongtrend for stellar age in elliptical host galaxies with luminosity.intermediately luminous elliptical hosts have comparably young populations,either intrinsically or from an enhanced star formation rate potentially due tointeraction, the most luminous and massive ellipticals on the contrary show oldpopulations. the correspondence between the nuclear activity and the bluecolours suggests a connection between galaxy interaction, induced starformation and the triggering of nuclear activity. however, the existence ofvery symmetric and undisturbed disks and elliptical host galaxies emphasisedthat other mechanisms like minor merging or gas accretion must exist.

astro-ph;0404527	the influence of redshift information on galaxy-galaxy lensing  measurements	we investigate how galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements depend on the knowledgeof redshifts for lens and source galaxies. galaxy-galaxy lensing allows one tostudy dark matter halos of galaxies statistically using weak gravitationallensing. redshift information is required to reliably distinguish foregroundlens galaxies from background source galaxies and to convert the measured shearinto constraints on the lens model. without spectroscopy or multi-colourinformation, redshifts can be drawn from independently estimated probabilitydistributions. the combo-17 survey provides redshifts for both lens and sourcegalaxies. it thus offers the unique possibility to do this investigation withobservational data. we find that it is of great importance to know theredshifts of individual lens galaxies in order to constrain the properties oftheir dark matter halos. whether the redshifts are derived from $ubvri$ or thelarger number of filters available in combo-17 is not very important. incontrast, knowledge of individual source redshifts improves the measurementsonly very little over the use of statistical source redshift distributions aslong as the source redshift distribution is known accurately.

astro-ph;0408382	bar evolution over the last eight billion years: a constant fraction of  strong bars in gems	one third of present-day spirals host optically visible strong bars thatdrive their dynamical evolution. however, the fundamental question of how barsevolve over cosmological times has yet to be addressed, and even the frequencyof bars at intermediate redshifts remains controversial. we investigate thefrequency of bars out to z~1.0 drawing on a sample of 1590 galaxies from thegems survey, which provides morphologies from hst acs two-color images, andhighly accurate redshifts from the combo-17 survey. we identify spiral galaxiesusing the sersic index, concentration parameter, and rest-frame color. wecharacterize bars and disks by fitting ellipses to f606w and f850lp images,taking advantage of the two bands to minimize bandpass shifting. we excludehighly inclined (i&gt;60 deg) galaxies to ensure reliable morphologicalclassifications, and apply completeness cuts of m_v &lt;= -19.3 and -20.6. morethan 40% of the bars that we detect have semi major axes a&lt;0.5" and would beeasily missed in earlier surveys without the small psf of acs. the bars that wecan reliably detect are fairly strong (with ellipticities e&gt;=0.4) and have a inthe range ~1.2-13 kpc. we find that the optical fraction of such strong barsremains at ~(30% +- 6%) from the present-day out to look-back times of 2-6 gyr(z~0.2-0.7) and 6-8 gyr (z~0.7-1.0); it certainly shows no sign of a drasticdecline at z&gt;0.7. our findings of a large and similar bar fraction at thesethree epochs favor scenarios in which cold gravitationally unstable disks arealready in place by z~1, and where on average bars have a long lifetime (wellabove 2 gyr). the distributions of structural bar properties in the two slicesare, however, not statistically identical and therefore allow for thepossibility that the bar strengths and sizes may evolve over time.

astro-ph;0409372	abundances and kinematics of a candidate sub-damped lyman-alpha galaxy  toward phl 1226	the spectrum of the quasar phl 1226 is known to have a strong mg ii andsub-damped lyman-alpha (sub-dla) absorption line system withn(hi)=(5+/-2)*10^19 cm^-2 at z=0.1602. using integral field spectra from thepotsdam multi aperture spectrophotometer (pmas) we investigate a galaxy at animpact parameter of 6".4 which is most probably responsible for the absorptionlines. a fainter galaxy at a similar redshift and a slightly larger distancefrom the qso is known to exist, but we assume that the absorption is caused bythe more nearby galaxy. from optical balmer lines we estimate an intrinsicreddening consistent with 0, and a moderate star formation rate of 0.5 m_sunyr^-1, is inferred from the halpha luminosity. using nebular emission lineratios we find a solar oxygen abundance 12+log(o/h)=8.7+/-0.1 and a solarnitrogen to oxygen abundance ratio log(n/o)=-1.0+/-0.2. this abundance islarger than those of all known sub-dla systems derived from analyses of metalabsorption lines in quasar spectra. on the other hand, the properties arecompatible with the most metal rich galaxies responsible for strong mg iiabsorption systems. these two categories can be reconciled if we assume anabundance gradient similar to local galaxies. under that assumption we predictabundances 12+log(o/h)=7.1 and log(n/o)=-1.9 for the sub-dla cloud, which issimilar to high redshift dla and sub-dla systems. we find evidence for arotational velocity of ~200 km s^-1 over a length of ~7 kpc. from the geometryand kinematics of the galaxy we estimate that the absorbing cloud does notbelong to a rotating disk, but could originate in a rotating halo.

astro-ph;0412615	weak lensing measurements of dark matter halos of galaxies from combo-17	we present a measurement of mass estimates for dark matter halos aroundgalaxies from the combo-17 survey using weak gravitational lensing. combo-17 isparticularly useful for this kind of investigation because it coversobservations in 17 optical filters from which accurate photometric redshiftsand spectral classification for objects with $r&lt;24$ are derived. this allows usto select lens and source galaxies from their redshifts and to thus avoid anyuncertainties from estimates of the source redshift distribution. we studygalaxy lenses at redshifts $z_\mathrm{d}=0.2-0.7$ by fitting the normalizationof either singular isothermal spheres (sis) or navarro-frenk-white (nfw)profiles to the whole lens sample; we then consider halos around blue and redsubsamples separately. we also constrain the scaling of halo mass with light.for the nfw model, we find virial masses$m_\mathrm{vir}^*=3.9^{+3.3}_{-2.4}\times 10^{11}h^{-1}m_{\sun}$ (1-$\sigma$)for blue and $m_\mathrm{vir}^*=7.1^{+7.1}_{-3.8}\times 10^{11}h^{-1}m_{\sun}$for red galaxies of $l_\star=10^{10}h^{-2}l_{\sun}$, respectively. the derivedmass-to-light scaling relations suggest that the mass-to-light ratio mightdecrease with increasing luminosity for blue galaxies but increase withincreasing luminosity for red galaxies. however, these differences between blueand red galaxies are only marginally significant and both subsamples areconsistent with having the same mass-to-light ratio at all luminosities.finally, we compare our results to those obtained from the red-sequence clustersurvey (rcs) and the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). taking differences in theactual modelling into account, we find very good agreement with these surveys.

astro-ph;0503026	metal abundances in a damped lyman-alpha system along two lines of sight  at z=0.93	we study metal abundances in the z=0.9313 damped lya system observed in thetwo lines-of-sight, a and b, toward the gravitationally-lensed double qsohe0512-3329. spatially resolved stis spectra constrain the neutral-gas columndensity to be logn(hi)=20.5 in both aand b. uves spectra (spectral resolutionfwhm=9.8 km/s) show, in contrast, significant line-of-sight differences in thecolumn densities of mnii and feii; these are not due to observationalsystematics. we find that [mn/h]=-1.44 and [fe/h]=-1.52 in damped lya system a,while [mn/h]=-0.98 and [fe/h]&gt;-1.32, and possibly as high as [fe/h] approx. -1in damped lya system b. a careful assessment of possible systematic errorsleads us to conclude that these transverse differences are significant at a 5sigma level or greater. although nucleosynthesis effects may also be at play,we favor differential dust-depletion as the main mechanism producing theobserved abundance gradient. the transverse separation is 5 kpc at the redshiftof the absorber, which is also likely to be the lensing galaxy. the derivedabundances therefore probe two opposite sides of a single galaxy hosting bothdamped lya systems. this is the first time firm abundance constraints have beenobtained for a single damped system probed by two lines-of-sight. thesignificance of this finding for the cosmic evolution of metals is discussed.

astro-ph;0503284	high-redshift quasar host galaxies with adaptive optics	we present k band adaptive optics observations of three high-redshift (z ~2.2) high-luminosity quasars, all of which were studied for the first time. wealso bserved several point spread function (psf) calibrators,non-simultaneously because of the small field of view. the significant temporalpsf variations on timescales of minutes inhibited a straightforward scaled psfremoval from the quasar images. characterising the degree of psf concentrationby the radii encircling 20% and 80% of the total flux, respectively, we foundthat even under very different observing conditions the r_20 vs. r_80 relationvaried coherently between individual short exposure images, delineating awell-defined relation for point sources. placing the quasar images on thisrelation, we see indications that all three objects were resolved. we designeda procedure to estimate the significance of this result, and to estimate hostgalaxy parameters, by reproducing the statistical distribution of theindividual short exposure images. we find in all three cases evidence for aluminous host galaxy, with a mean absolute magnitude of m_r = -27.0 and scalelengths around ~ 4-12 kpc. together with a rough estimate of the central blackhole masses obtained from c_iv line widths, the location of the objects on thebulge luminosity vs. black hole mass relation is not significantly dfferentfrom the low-redshift regime, assuming only passive evolution of the hostgalaxy. corresponding eddington luminosities are l_nuc/l_edd ~ 0.1-0.6.

astro-ph;0504657	evidence for a magnitude-dependent bias in the hamburg/eso survey for  damped lyman-alpha systems	we present preliminary results from the hamburg/eso survey for dampedly-alpha (hereafter, dla) systems. this survey is characterized by (i) the goodknowledge of the biases affecting the parent qso survey, (ii) the brightnessand (iii) the relatively wide magnitude distribution of the background qsos.therefore, it is well-suited to study possible magnitude-dependent biases indla surveys, such as the one expected from dust obscuration. we havesystematically searched for damped lyman-alpha line candidates in 5 aresolution spectra of the 188 qsos that constitute our statistical sample.these candidates have later been reobserved with uves at the eso--very largetelescope (vlt) for confirmation and accurate n(hi) measurements. in theredshift range covered by the survey, 19 dla systems have been discovered. overthe whole survey, we find that the number density, n(z), and cosmologicaldensity of gas, omega_gas, have comparable values to the ones obtained bycorals (ellison et al. 2001). however, the number densities of dla systems n(z)in two sub-samples of equal absorption distance path defined by the magnitudeof the background qsos differ by a factor of about 5. we estimate that theprobability that n(z) is equal in the two sub-samples is &lt; 0.003. a similar,only slightly less significant difference is found for omega_gas.

astro-ph;0510818	stellar populations in a complete sample of local radio galaxies	we investigate the nature of the continuum emission and stellar populationsin the inner 1-3 kiloparsecs of a complete sample of twenty-four southern radiogalaxies, and compare the results with a control sample of eighteen non-activeearly-type galaxies. twelve of the radio galaxies are classified asfanaroff-riley type i (fri), eight as frii and four as intermediate orundefined type (frx). optical long-slit spectra are used to perform spectralsynthesis as a function of distance from the nucleus at an average sampling of0.5-1.0kpc and quantify the relative contributions of a blue featurelesscontinuum and stellar population components of different ages. our main findingis a systematic difference between the stellar populations of the radio andcontrol sample galaxies: the former have a larger contribution from anintermediate age (1gyr) component, suggesting a connection between the presentradio activity and a starburst which occurred about 1gyr ago. in addition, wefind a correlation between the contribution of the 1gyr component and the radiopower, suggesting that more massive starbursts have led to more powerful radioemission. a similar relation is found between the radio power and the mean ageof the stellar population, in the sense that stronger nuclear activity is foundin younger galaxies.

astro-ph;0601374	quasars near the line of sight towards q 0302-003 and the transverse  proximity effect	we report the discovery of the faint (v=21.7) quasar qso03027-0010 at z=2.808in the vicinity of q0302-003, one of the few quasars observed with stis tostudy intergalactic heii absorption. together with another newly discovered qsoat z=2.29, there are now 6 qsos known near the line of sight towards q0302-003,of which 4 are located within the redshift region 2.76&lt;=z&lt;=3.28 covered by thestis spectrum. we correlated the opacity variations in the hi and heii lymanforest spectra with the locations of known quasars. there is no significantproximity effect in the hi lyman alpha forest for any of the qsos, except forthe well-known line of sight effect for q0302-003 itself. by comparing theabsorption properties in hi and heii, we estimated the fluctuating hardness ofthe extragalactic uv radiation field along this line of sight. we find thatclose to each foreground quasar, the ionizing background is considerably harderthan on average. in particular, our newly discovered qso03027-0010 shows such ahardness increase despite being associated with an overdensity in the hi lymanforest. we argue that the spectral hardness is a sensitive physical measure toreveal the influence of qsos onto the uv background even over scales of severalmpc, and that it breaks the density degeneracy hampering the traditionaltransverse proximity effect analysis. we infer from our sample that there is noneed for significantly anisotropic uv radiation from the qsos. from thetransverse proximity effect detected in the sample we obtain minimum quasarlifetimes in the range ~10-30 myr.

astro-ph;0603591	a jet-cloud interaction in the 3c 196 environment	powerful radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars at high redshifts arefrequently associated with extended emission-line regions (eelrs). here weinvestigate the [o ii] eelr around the quasar 3c 196 at z=0.871 using integralfield spectroscopy. we also detect extended [ne ii] emission at a distance ofabout 30 kpc from the core. the emission is aligned with the radio hot spotsand shows a redshifted and a blueshifted component with a velocity differenceof ~800 km s^-1. the alignment effect and large velocities support thehypothesis that the eelr is caused by a jet-cloud interaction, which isfurthermore indicated by the presence of a pronounced bend in the radioemission at the location of the radio hot spots. we also report observations oftwo other systems which do not show as clear indications of interactions. wefind a weaker alignment of an [o ii] eelr from the z=0.927 quasar 3c 336, whileno eelr is found around the core-dominated quasar oi 363 at z=0.63.

astro-ph;0603835	extended lyman alpha emission around bright quasars	quasars trace the most massive structures at high redshifts and theirpresence may influence the evolution of the massive host galaxies. we study theextended lyman alpha emission line regions (eelrs) around seven bright, mostlyradio-quiet quasars (qsos) at 2.7&lt;z&lt;4.5, and compare luminosities with eelrsaround radio-loud qsos reported in the literature. using integral fieldspectroscopy, we analyse the morphology and kinematics of the quiescent lyaeelrs around the qsos. we find evidence for the presence of eelrs around fourradio-quiet and one radio-loud qso. all eelrs appear asymmetric and theoptically brightest qsos also have the brightest lya nebulae. for the twobrightest nebulae we find velocities between ~600 km s^-1 at the qso positionto ~200 km s^-1 at a distance of 3-4 arcsec from the qso and surface fluxdensities up to 2-3*10^{-16} erg cm^-2 s^-1 arcsec^-2. the five eelrs havetotal lya luminosities which correspond to ~0.5% of the luminosities from theqsos broad lya emission lines. this fraction is an order of magnitude smallerthan found for eelrs around radio-loud, steep spectrum qsos reported in theliterature. while the nebulae luminosities are correlated with the qso lyaluminosities, we find that nebulae luminosities are not correlated with thecentral qso ionising fluxes. the presence of gas in the eelrs can beinterpreted based on two competing scenarios: either from quasar feedbackmechanisms, or from infalling matter. apart from these two effects, the lyaflux around radio-loud objects can be enhanced due to interactions with theradio jets. the relatively fainter nebulae around radio-quiet qsos compared tolobe-dominated radio-loud qsos can be ascribed to this effect, or tosignificant differences in the environments between the two classes.

astro-ph;0604378	strange magnification pattern in the large separation lens sdss  j1004+4112 from optical to x-rays	we present simultaneous xmm-newton uv and x-ray observations of the quadruplylensed quasar sdss j1004+4112 (rbs 825). simultaneously with the xmm-newtonobservations we also performed integral field spectroscopy on the two closestlens images a and b using the calar alto pmas spectrograph. in x-rays thewidely spaced components c and d are clearly resolved, while the closer pair ofimages a and b is marginally resolved in the xmm-epic images. the integratedx-ray flux of the system has decreased by a factor of 6 since it was observedin the rosat all sky survey in 1990, while the x-ray spectrum became muchharder with the power law index evolving from gamma=-2.3 to -1.86. bydeblending the x-ray images of the lensed qso we find that the x-ray fluxratios between the lens images a and b are significantly different from thesimultaneously obtained uv ratios and previously measured optical flux ratios.our optical spectrum of lens image a shows an enhancement in the blue emissionline wings, which has been observed in previous epochs as a transient feature.we propose a scenario where intrinsic uv and x-ray variability gives rise toline variations which are selectively magnified in image a by microlensing. theextended emission of the lensing cluster of galaxies is clearly detected in theepic images, we measure a 0.5-2.0 kev luminosity of 1.4 e44 erg/s. based on thecluster x-ray properties, we estimate a mass of 2-6 e14 solar masses.

astro-ph;0605288	on-axis spectroscopy of the host galaxies of 20 optically luminous  quasars at z~0.3	we present the analysis of a sample of 20 bright low-redshift quasars(m_b&lt;-23 and z &lt; 0.35) observed spectroscopically with the vlt. the fors1spectra, obtained in multi object spectroscopy (mos) mode, allow to observesimultaneously the quasars and several reference stars used to spatiallydeconvolve the data. applying the mcs deconvolution method, we are able toseparate the individual spectra of the quasar and of the underlying hostgalaxy. contrary to some previous claims, we find that luminous quasars are notexclusively hosted by massive ellipticals. most quasar host galaxies harbourlarge amounts of gas, irrespective of their morphological type. moreover, thestellar content of half of the hosts is a young sc-like population, associatedwith a rather low metallicity interstellar medium. a significant fraction ofthe galaxies contain gas ionized at large distances by the quasar radiation.this large distance ionization is always associated with signs of gravitationalinteractions (as detected from images or disturbed rotation curves). thespectra of the quasars themselves provide evidence that gravitationalinteractions bring dust and gas in the immediate surrounding of the supermassive black hole, allowing to feed it. the quasar activity might thus betriggered (1) in young gas-rich spiral galaxies by local events and (2) in moreevolved galaxies by gravitational interactions or collisions. the lattermechanism gives rises to the most powerful quasars. finally, we derive massmodels for the isolated spiral host galaxies and we show that the most reliableestimators of the systemic redshift in the quasar spectrum are the tips of theha and hb lines.

astro-ph;9604104	discovery of four white dwarfs with strong magnetic fields by the  hamburg/eso survey	four magnetic white dwarfs have been found in the course of the hamburg/esosurvey for bright qsos. the objects have been selected as qso candidate on thebasis of its blue continuum and the apparent absence of strong hydrogen orhelium lines. one star, he1211-1707, shows a rather fast spectral variability:both the strength and the position of the shallow absorption features change ona time scale of 20 minutes. we interpret this variability as being due to amagnetic field on the surface of a rotating white dwarf, having a relativelyuniform magnetic field on one hemisphere and a much larger spread of fieldstrengths visible during other phases of the rotational period. all attempts todetermine the magnetic field structure in detail with the help of syntheticspectra have failed so far because the star must have a rather complicatedfield geometry. however, both the optical and the uv spectra indicate that asignificant part of the surface is dominated by a magnetic field strength ofabout 80 mg. the spectrum of he 0127-3110 is also rotationally modulated. thisstar (approximate range of magnetic fields: 85-345 mg) as well as he 2201-2250(a spectroscopic twin of he 0127-3110) and he 0000-3430 (43-118 mg) could bereasonably well reproduced with the help of theoretical spectra calculatedassuming magnetic dipoles which are offset by 0.1 and 0.2 stellar radii alongthe magnetic axis. this result is in agreement with the assumption that apstars, also showing significant deviations from a centered dipole, are theprogenitors of magnetic white dwarfs.

0810.2172	eddington ratios of faint agn at intermediate redshift: evidence for a  population of half-starved black holes	we use one of the deepest spectroscopic samples of broad line active galacticnuclei (agn) currently available, extracted from the vimos vlt deep survey(vvds), to compute mgii and civ virial masses estimate of 120 super-massiveblack holes in the redshift range 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.9 and 2.6&lt;z&lt;4.3. we find that themass-luminosity relation shows considerably enhanced dispersion towards low agnluminosities (log l_bol ~ 45). at these luminosities, there is a substantialfraction of black holes accreting far below their eddington limit (l_bol/l_edd&lt; 0.1), in marked contrast to what is generally found for agn of higherluminosities. we speculate that these may be agn on the decaying branch oftheir light-curves, well past their peak activity. this would agree with recenttheoretical predictions of agn evolution.  in the electronic appendix of this paper we publish an update of the vvdstype-1 agn sample, including the first and most of the second epochobservations. this sample contains 298 objects of which 168 are new.
