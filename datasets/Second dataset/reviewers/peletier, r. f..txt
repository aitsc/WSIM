0706.2275	a dust component 2 kpc above the plane in ngc 891	the halo of ngc 891 has been the subject of studies for more than a decade.one of its most striking features is the large asymmetry in h$\alpha$ emission.in this letter, we will take a quantitative look at this asymmetry at differentwavelengths for the first time. we suggest that ngc 891 is intrinsically almostsymmetric and the large asymmetry in h$\alpha$ emission is mostly due to dustattenuation. we will quantify the additional optical depth needed to cause theobserved asymmetry in this model. by comparing large strips on the north eastside of the galaxy with strips covering the same area in the south west we canquantify and analyze the asymmetry in the different wavelengths. from the 24$\mu$m emission we find that the intrinsic asymmetry in star formation in ngc891 is small i.e., $\sim 30%$. the additional asymmetry in h$\alpha$ is modeledas additional symmetric dust attenuation which extends up to $\sim$ 40\arcsec(1.9 kpc) above the plane of the galaxy with a mid-plane value of $\tau$=0.8and a scale height of 0.5 kpc

0909.5385	evidence for intermediate-age stellar populations in early-type galaxies  from k-band spectroscopy	the study of stellar populations in early-type galaxies in differentenvironments is a powerful tool for constraining their star formationhistories. this study has been traditionally restricted to the optical range,where dwarfs around the turn-off and stars at the base of the rgb dominate theintegrated light at all ages. the near-infrared spectral range is especiallyinteresting since in the presence of an intermediate-age population, agb starsare the main contributors. in this letter, we measure the near-infrared indicesnai and d$_{\rm co}$ for a sample of 12 early-type galaxies in low densityenvironments and compare them with the fornax galaxy sample presented by silvaet al. (2008). the analysis of these indices in combination with lick/idsindices in the optical range reveals i) the nai index is a metallicityindicator as good as c4668 in the optical range, and ii) d$_{\rm co}$ is atracer of intermediate-age stellar populations. we find that low-mass galaxiesin low density environments show higher nai and d$_{\rm co}$ than those locatedin fornax cluster, which points towards a late stage of star formation for thegalaxies in less dense environments, in agreement with results from otherstudies using independent methods.

0912.0274	the sauron project - xv. modes of star formation in early-type galaxies  and the evolution of the red sequence	we combine sauron integral field data of a representative sample of localearly-type, red sequence galaxies with spitzer/irac imaging in order toinvestigate the presence of trace star formation in these systems. with thespitzer data, we identify galaxies hosting low-level star formation, as tracedby pah emission, with measured star formation rates that compare well to thoseestimated from other tracers. this star formation proceeds according toestablished scaling relations with molecular gas content, in surface densityregimes characteristic of disk galaxies and circumnuclear starbursts. we findthat star formation in early-type galaxies happens exclusively in fast-rotatingsystems and occurs in two distinct modes. in the first, star formation is adiffuse process, corresponding to widespread young stellar populations and highmolecular gas content. the equal presence of co- and counter-rotatingcomponents in these systems strongly implies an external origin for thestar-forming gas, and we argue that these star formation events may be thefinal stages of (mostly minor) mergers that build up the bulges of red sequencelenticulars. in the second mode of star formation, the process is concentratedinto well-defined disk or ring morphologies, outside of which the host galaxiesexhibit uniformly evolved stellar populations. this implies that these starformation events represent rejuvenations within previously quiescent stellarsystems. evidence for earlier star formation events similar to these in allfast rotating early-type galaxies suggests that this mode of star formation maybe common to all such galaxies, with a duty cycle of roughly 1/10, and likelycontributes to the embedded, co-rotating inner stellar disks ubiquitous in thispopulation.

1506.07183	single stellar populations in the near-infrared ii. synthesis models	we present unresolved single stellar population synthesis models in thenear-infrared (nir) range. the extension to the nir is important for the studyof early-type galaxies, since these galaxies are predominantly old andtherefore emit most of their light in this wavelength range. the models arebased on a library of empirical stellar spectra, the nasa infrared telescopefacility (irtf) spectral library. integrating these spectra along theoreticalisochrones, while assuming an initial mass function (imf), we have producedmodel spectra of single age-metallicity stellar populations at a resolutionr~2000. these models can be used to fit observed spectral of globular clustersand galaxies, to derive their age distribution, chemical abundances and imf.the models have been tested by comparing them to observed colours of ellipticalgalaxies and clusters in the magellanic clouds. predicted absorption lineindices have been compared to published indices of other elliptical galaxies.the comparisons show that our models are well suited for studying stellarpopulations in unresolved galaxies. they are particularly useful for studyingthe old and intermediate-age stellar populations in galaxies, relatively freefrom contamination of young stars and extinction by dust. these models will beindispensable for the study of the upcoming data from jwst and extremely largetelescopes, such as the e-elt.

1510.06066	the far-infrared emission of the radio-loud quasar 3c318	3c318, a radio-loud quasar at z=1.574, is a subgalactic-sized radio source,and a good test-bed for the interplay between black hole and galaxy growth inthe high-z universe. based on its iras, iso, and scuba detections, it has longbeen considered as one of the most intrinsically luminous (l$_{\mathrm{ir}}$ &gt;10$^{13}$ l$_{\odot}$) infrared sources in the universe. recent far-infrareddata from the herschel space observatory reveal that most of the fluxassociated with 3c318 measured with earlier instruments in fact comes from abright nearby source. optical imaging and spectroscopy show that thisinfrared-bright source is a strongly star-forming pair of interacting galaxiesat z=0.35. adding existing spitzer and sdss photometry, we perform a spectralenergy distribution analysis of the pair, and find that it has a combinedinfrared luminosity of l$_{\mathrm{ir}}$ = 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{12}$ l$_{\odot}$,comparable to other intermediate-redshift ultra-luminous infrared galaxiesstudied with herschel. isolating the emission from 3c318's host, we robustlyconstrain the level of star formation to a value a factor of three lower thanthat published earlier, which is more in line with the star formation activityfound in other herschel-detected 3cr objects at similar redshift.

0806.4622	internal kinematics of spiral galaxies in distant clusters iii. velocity  fields from fors2/mxu spectroscopy	(abridged) we study the impact of cluster environment on the evolution ofspiral galaxies by examining their structure and kinematics. rather thantwo-dimensional rotation curves, we observe complete velocity fields by placingthree adjacent and parallel fors2 mxu slits on each object, yielding severalemission and absorption lines. the gas velocity fields are reconstructed anddecomposed into circular rotation and irregular motions using kinemetry. toquantify irregularities in the gas kinematics, we define three parameters:sigma_{pa} (standard deviation of the kinematic position angle), delta phi (theaverage misalignment between kinematic and photometric position angles) andk_{3,5} (squared sum of the higher order fourier terms). using local,undistorted galaxies from sings, these can be used to establish the regularityof the gas velocity fields. here we present the analysis of 22 distant galaxiesin the ms0451.6-0305 field with 11 members at z=0.54. in this sample we findboth field (4 out of 8) and cluster (3 out of 4) galaxies with velocity fieldsthat are both irregular and asymmetric. we show that these fractions areunderestimates of the actual number of galaxies with irregular velocity fields.the values of the (ir)regularity parameters for cluster galaxies are not verydifferent from those of the field galaxies, implying that there are isolatedfield galaxies that are as distorted as the cluster members. none of thedeviations in our small sample correlate with photometric/structural propertieslike luminosity or disk scale length in a significant way.  our 3d-spectroscopic method successfully maps the velocity field of distantgalaxies, enabling the importance and efficiency of cluster specificinteractions to be assessed quantitatively.

astro-ph;0301070	a sauron view of galaxies	we have measured the two-dimensional kinematics and line-strengthdistributions of 72 representative nearby early-type galaxies, out toapproximately one effective radius, with our panoramic integral-fieldspectrograph sauron. the resulting maps reveal a rich variety in kinematicalstructures and linestrength distributions, indicating that early-type galaxiesare more complex systems than often assumed. we are building detailed dynamicalmodels for these galaxies, to derive their intrinsic shape and dynamicalstructure, and to determine the mass of the supermassive central black hole.here we focus on two examples, the compact elliptical m32 and the e3 galaxyngc4365. these objects represent two extreme cases: m32 has very regularkinematics which can be represented accurately by an axisymmetric model inwhich all stars rotate around the short axis, while ngc4365 is a triaxialgalaxy with a prominent kinematically decoupled core, with an inner core thatrotates about an axis that is nearly perpendicular to the rotation axis of themain body of the galaxy. our dynamical models for these objects demonstratethat two-dimensional observations are essential for deriving the intrinsicorbital structure and dark matter content of galaxies.

astro-ph;0303297	empirical calibration of the near-ir caii triplet - iv. the stellar  population synthesis models	we present a new stellar population synthesis model, which predicts seds forsingle-age single-metallicity stellar populations, ssps, at resolution 1.5a(fwhm) in the spectral region of the near-ir caii triplet feature. the mainingredient of the model is a new extensive empirical stellar spectral librarypresented in cenarro et al., which is composed of more than 600 stars. two mainproducts of interest for stellar population analysis are presented. the firstis a library of seds for ssps covering a large range of ages, metallicities anddifferent imf types. they are well suited to model galaxy data, since the sspspectra, with flux-calibrated response curves, can be smoothed to match theresolution of galaxy data, taking into account the internal velocity dispersionof the galaxy, allowing the user to analyze the observed spectrum in its ownsystem. we also produce integrated absorption line indices for the same ssps inthe form of equivalent widths. we find the following behaviour for the caiifeature in old-aged ssps: i) the caii triplet feature does not change much withtime for all metallicities for ages larger than ~3 gyr, ii) this index shows astrong dependence with metallicity for values below [m/h] ~-0.5 and iii) forlarger metallicities this feature does not show a significant dependence eitheron age or on the metallicity, being more sensitive to changes in the slope ofpower-like imf shapes. the ssp spectra have been calibrated with measurementsfor globular clusters. fitting the models to two early-type galaxies ofdifferent luminosities, we find that the caii measurements cannot be fittedunless a very dwarf-dominated imf is imposed, or if the ca abundance is evenlower than the fe abundance.

astro-ph;0404379	galactic bulges from hst nicmos observations: central galaxian objects,  and nuclear profile slopes	we have measured the central structural properties for a sample of s0-sbcgalaxies down to scales of ~10 pc using hst nicmos images. we find that thephotometric masses of the central star clusters, which occur in 58% of oursample, are related to their host bulge masses such that masspt =10^{7.75\pm0.15}(massbul/10^{10}masssun)^{0.76\pm 0.13}. put together withrecent data on bulges hosting supermassive black holes, we infer a non-lineardependency of the `central massive object' mass on the host bulge mass suchthat masscmo = 10^{7.51\pm 0.06} (massbul/10^{10}masssun)^{0.84 \pm 0.06}. weargue that the linear relation presented by ferrarese et al. is biased at thelow-mass end by the inclusion of the disc light from lenticular galaxies intheir sample. matching our nicmos data with wider-field, ground-based k-bandimages enabled us to sample from the nucleus to the disk-dominated region ofeach galaxy, and thus to perform a proper bulge-disk decomposition. we foundthat the majority of our galaxies (~90%) possess central light excesses whichcan be modeled with an inner exponential and/or an unresolved point source inthe case of the nuclear star clusters. all the extended nuclear components,with sizes of a few hundred pc, have disky isophotes, which suggest that theymay be inner disks, rings, or bars; their colors are redder than those of theunderlying bulge, arguing against a recent origin for their stellarpopulations. surface brightness profiles rise inward to the resolution limit ofthe data, with a continuous distribution of logarithmic slopes from the lowvalues typical of dwarf ellipticals (0.1 \leq gamma \leq 0.3) to the highvalues (gamma ~ 1) typical of intermediate luminosity ellipticals; the nuclearslope bi-modality reported by others is not present in our sample.

astro-ph;0404381	galactic bulges from hst nicmos observations: global scaling relations	we investigate bulge and disk scaling relations using a volume-correctedsample of early- to intermediate-type disk galaxies in which, importantly, thebiasing flux from additional nuclear components has been modeled and removed.structural parameters are obtained from a seeing-convolved,bulge+disk+nuclear-component decomposition applied to near-infrared surfacebrightness profiles spanning ~10 pc to the outer disk. bulge and diskparameters, and bulge-to-disk ratios, are analyzed as a function of bulgeluminosity, disk luminosity, galaxy central velocity dispersion, and galaxyhubble type. mathematical expressions are given for the stronger relations,which can be used to test and constrain galaxy formation models. photometricparameters of both bulges and disks are observed to correlate with bulgeluminosity and with central velocity dispersion. in contrast, for the unbarred,early to intermediate types covered by the sample, hubble type does notcorrelate with bulge and disk components, nor their various ratios. in thissense, the early-to-intermediate spiral hubble sequence is scale-free. however,galaxies themselves are not scale-free, the critical scale being the luminosityof the bulge. bulge luminosity is shown to affect the disk parameters, suchthat central surface brightness becomes fainter, and scale-length bigger, withbulge luminosity. the lack of significant correlations between bulgepararmeters (size, luminosity or density) on disk luminosity, remains achallenge for secular evolution models of bulge growth.

astro-ph;0611211	on the origin and fate of ionised-gas in early-type galaxies: the sauron  perspective	by detecting ionised-gas emission in 75% of the cases, the sauronintegral-field spectroscopic survey has further demonstrated that early-typegalaxies often display nebular emission. furthermore, the sauron data haveshown that such emission comes with an intriguing variety of morphologies,kinematic behaviours and line ratios.  perhaps most puzzling was the finding that round and slowly rotating objectsgenerally display uncorrelated stellar and gaseous angular momenta, consistentwith an external origin for the gas, whereas flatter and fast rotating galaxieshost preferentially co-rotating gas and stars, suggesting internal productionof gas. alternatively, a bias against the internal production of ionised gasand against the acquisition of retrograde material may be present in these twokinds of objects, respectively.  in light of the different content of hot gas in these systems, with slowlyrotating objects being the only systems capable of hosting massive x-ray halos,we suggest that a varying importance of evaporation of warm gas in the hotinterstellar medium can contribute to explain the difference in the relativebehaviour of gas and stars in these two kinds of objects. namely, whereas inx-ray bright and slowly rotating galaxies stellar-loss material would quicklyevaporate in the hot medium, in x-ray faint and fast rotating objects suchmaterial would be allowed to lose angular momentum and settle in a disk, whichcould also obstruct the subsequent acquisition of retrograde gas. evidence fora connection between warm and hot gas phases, presumably driven by heatconduction, is presented for four slowly rotating galaxies with chandraobservations.

astro-ph;0611618	medium-resolution isaac newton telescope library of empirical spectra -  ii. the stellar atmospheric parameters	we present a homogeneous set of stellar atmospheric parameters teff, log g,[fe/h] for miles, a new spectral stellar library covering the range 3525 - 7500angstrom at 2.3 angstrom (fwhm) spectral resolution. the library consists of985 stars spanning a large range in atmospheric parameters, from supermetal-rich, cool stars to hot, metal-poor stars. the spectral resolution,spectral type coverage and number of stars represent a substantial improvementover previous libraries used in population synthesis models. the atmosphericparameters that we present here are the result of a previous, extensivecompilation from the literature. in order to construct a homogeneous dataset ofatmospheric parameters we have taken the sample of stars of soubiran, katz &amp;cayrel, which has very well determined fundamental parameters, as the standardreference system for our field stars, and have calibrated and bootstrapped thedata from other papers against it. the atmospheric parameters for our clusterstars have also been revised and updated according to recent metallicityscales, colour-temperature relations and improved set of isochrones.

astro-ph;0703363	kinematics of diffuse ionized gas in the disk halo interface of ngc 891  from fabry-p\'erot observations	the properties of the gas in halos of galaxies constrain global models of theinterstellar medium. kinematical information is of particular interest since itis a clue to the origin of the gas. here we report observations of thekinematics of the thick layer of the diffuse ionized gas in ngc 891 in order todetermine the rotation curve of the halo gas. we have obtained a fabry-p\'erotdata cube in halpha to measure the kinematics of the halo gas with angularresolution much higher than obtained from hi 21 cm observations. the data cubewas obtained with the taurus ii spectrograph at the wht on la palma. thevelocity information of the diffuse ionized gas extracted from the data cube iscompared to model distributions to constrain the distribution of the gas and inparticular the halo rotation curve. the best fit model has a centralattenuation tau_h-alpha=6, a dust scale length of 8.1 kpc, an ionized gas scalelength of 5.0 kpc. above the plane the rotation curve lags with a verticalgradient of -18.8 km/s/kpc. we find that the scale length of the h-alpha mustbe between 2.5 and 6.5 kpc. furthermore we find evidence that the rotationcurve above the plane rises less steeply than in the plane. this is all inagreement with the velocities measured in the hi.

astro-ph;0703533	the sauron project -- x. the orbital anisotropy of elliptical and  lenticular galaxies: revisiting the (v/sigma,epsilon) diagram with  integral-field stellar kinematics	we analyse the orbital distribution of e and s0 galaxies using sauronintegral-field stellar kinematics. we construct the anisotropy(v/sigma,epsilon) diagram, for the 48 e/s0 galaxies from the sauron survey. fora subsample of 24 galaxies consistent with axisymmetry, we use three-integralaxisymmetric schwarzschild dynamical models to recover the detailed orbitaldistribution and we find good agreement with the anisotropy derived from the(v/sigma,epsilon) diagram. in the companion paper ix we show that theearly-type galaxies can be subdivided into two classes of systems with orwithout a significant amount of specific stellar angular momentum. here we showthat the two classes have different distributions on the (v/sigma,epsilon)diagram. the slow rotators are more common among the most massive systems andare generally classified as e from photometry alone. those in our sample tendto be fairly round (epsilon&lt;0.3), but can have significant kinematicalmisalignments, indicating that as a class they are moderately triaxial, andspan a range of anisotropies (delta&lt;0.3). the fast rotators are generallyfainter and are classified either e or s0. they can appear quite flattened(epsilon&lt;0.7), do not show significant kinematical misalignments (unless barredor interacting), indicating they are nearly axisymmetric, and span an evenlarger range of anisotropies (delta&lt;0.5). these results are confirmed when weextend our analysis to 18 additional e/s0 galaxies observed with sauron. allthese results support the idea that fast rotators are nearly oblate and containdisk-like components. the role of gas must have been important for theirformation. the slow rotators are weakly triaxial. current collisionless mergermodels seem unable to explain their detailed observed properties.

astro-ph;0703588	hst/acs observations of shell galaxies: inner shells, shell colours and  dust	aim:learn more about the origin of shells and dust in early type galaxies.method: v-i colours of shells and underlying galaxies are derived, using hstadvanced camera for surveys (acs) data. a galaxy model is made locally inwedges and subtracted to determine shell profiles and colours. we appliedvoronoi binning to our data to get smoothed colour maps of the galaxies.comparison with n-body simulations from the literature gives more insight tothe origin of the shell features. shell positions and dust characteristics areinferred from model galaxy subtracted images. result: the acs images revealshells well within the effective radius in some galaxies (at 1.7 kpc in thecase of ngc 5982). in some cases, strong nuclear dust patches prevent detectionof inner shells. most shells have colours which are similar to the underlyinggalaxy. some inner shells are redder than the galaxy. all six shell galaxiesshow out of dynamical equilibrium dust features, like lanes or patches, intheir central regions. our detection rate for dust in the shell ellipticals isgreater than that found from hst archive data for a sample of normal early-typegalaxies, at the 95% confidence level. conclusions: the merger model describesbetter the shell distributions and morphologies than the interaction model. redshell colours are most likely due to the presence of dust and/or older stellarpopulations. the high prevalence and out of dynamical equilibrium morphologiesof the central dust features point towards external influences beingresponsible for visible dust features in early type shell galaxies. innershells are able to manifest themselves in relatively old shell systems.

astro-ph;0703768	on the 3 dimensional structure of edge-on disk galaxies	a simple algorithm is employed to deproject the two dimensional images of apilot sample of 12 high-quality images of edge-on disk galaxies and to studytheir intrinsic 3 dimensional stellar distribution. we examine the radialprofiles of the stars as a function of height above the plane and report ageneral trend within our sample of an increasing radial scalelength with heightoutside of the dustlane. this could be explained by the widespread presence ofa thick disk component in these galaxies. in addition, the 3 dimensional viewallows the study of the vertical distribution of the outer disk, beyond thebreak region, where we detect a significant increase in scalelength withvertical distance from the major axis for the truncated disks. this could beregarded as a weakening of the "truncation" with increasing distance from theplane. furthermore, we conclude that the recently revised classification of theradial surface brightness profiles found for face-on galaxies is indeedindependent of geometry. in particular, we find at least one example of each ofthe three main profile classes as defined in complete samples of intermediateto face-on galaxies: not-truncated, truncated and antitruncated. the positionand surface brightness that mark the break location in the radial lightdistribution are found to be consistent with those of face-on galaxies.

astro-ph;9312051	synthetic metal line indices for elliptical galaxies from super metal  rich alpha-enhanced stellar models	there are strong indications from recent papers (e.g. worthey et al. 1992)that the abundance ratio of mg/fe, and consequently also o/fe in giantelliptical galaxies is not solar. the line strengths of two fe lines at 5270and 5335 a are weaker than one expects from the strength of the mg b line if[mg/fe] = 0. we have synthesized absorption line indices to derive the mg andfe abundances of these galaxies. for these models we have calculated newevolutionary tracks of high metallicity stars with a range of mg/fe abundances.this is the first time that such tracks have been generated. integrating alongisochrones to synthesize metal line strengths we find that for a typical brightgiant elliptical [mg/fe] has to be between +0.3 and +0.7. we show that thisresult is independent of other parameters such as age, total metal content andmixing length parameter. the total metal content is super-solar, but the ironmetallicity of elliptical galaxies not necessarily has to be larger than solar.for the formation of elliptical galaxies our result on the mg and fe abundanceshas the implication that most of the enrichment of the gas has to come from sneii, which have more massive progenitors and as such produce relatively more oand mg than fe. it means that most of the stars have to be formed within aperiod of $3 \times 10^8$ years, so that there can only be one major collapsephase of the galaxy.

astro-ph;9502031	the striking near-infrared morphology of the inner region in m100	new optical and nir k-band images of the inner 3 kpc region of the nearbyvirgo spiral m100 (ngc 4321) display remarkable morphological changes withwavelength. while in the optical the light is dominated by a circumnuclear zoneof enhanced star formation, the features in the 2.2\mum image correspond to anewly discovered kpc-size stellar bar, and a pair of leading arms situatedinside an ovally-shaped region. only 5% of the k flux is emitted inantisymmetric structures. this indicates that the morphology seen in the nir isdominated by a global density wave. making a first-order correction for thepresence of localized dust extinction in k using the i-k image, we find thatthe observed leading arm morphology is slightly hidden by dust. possiblemechanisms responsible for the optical and nir morphology are discussed, andtests are proposed to discriminate between them. conclusions are supported withan evolutionary stellar population model reproducing the optical and nir colorsin a number of star forming zones. we argue that this morphology is compatiblewith the presence of a pair of inner lindblad resonances in the region, andshow this explicitly in an accompanying paper by detailed numerical modeling.the observed phenomena may provide insight into physical processes leading tocentral activity in galaxies.

astro-ph;9602088	ages of galaxy bulges and disks from optical and near-infrared colors	we compare optical and near-infrared colors of disks and bulges in adiameter-limited sample of inclined, bright, nearby, early-type spirals. colorprofiles along wedge apertures at 15 degree from the major axis and on theminor axis on the side of the galaxy opposite to the dust lane are used toassign nominal colors for the inner disks (at 2 scale length) and for thebulges (~ 0.5 r_eff), respectively. we estimate that the effects of dustreddening and the cross-talk between the colors of the two components isnegligible. we find that color differences (bulge -- disk) are very small:delta(u-r)=0.126 +/- 0.165, delta(r-k)=0.078 +/- 0.165. disks tend to be bluerby an amount three times smaller than that reported by bothun &amp; gregg (1990)for s0's. color variations from galaxy to galaxy are much larger than colordifferences between disk and bulge in each galaxy. probably, the underlying oldpopulation of disks and bulges is much more similar than the populationparadigm would lead us to believe. implied age differences, assuming identicalmetallicities, are less than 30%.

astro-ph;9602098	scale lengths in disk surface brightness as probes of dust extinction in  3 spiral galaxies: m 51, ngc 3631 and m 100	we have measured the radial brightness distributions in the disks of threenearby face-on spirals: m 51, ngc 3631, and ngc 4321 (m 100) in the photometricbands b through i, with the addition of the k band for m 51 only. themeasurements were made by averaging azimuthally, in three modes, thetwo-dimensional surface brightness over the disks in photometric images of theobjects in each band: (a) over each disk as a whole, (b) over the spiral armsalone, and (c) over the interarm zones alone. from these profiles scale-lengthswere derived for comparison with schematic exponential disk modelsincorporating interstellar dust. these models include both absorption andscattering in their treatment of radiative transfer. the model fits show thatthe arms exhibit greater optical depth in dust than the interarm zones. theaverage fraction of emitted stellar light in v which is extinguished by dustwithin 3 scale-lengths of the center of each galaxy does not rise above 20% inany of them. we show that this conclusion is also valid for models with similaroverall quantities of dust, but where this is concentrated in lanes. these canalso account for the observed scale-lengths, and their variations.

astro-ph;9602142	a counter-rotating bulge in the sb galaxy ngc 7331	we have found that the bulge of the large, nearby sb galaxy ngc 7331 rotatesretrograde to its disk. analysis of spectra in the region of the near-ir ca iitriplet along the major axis shows that, in the radial range between 5'' and~20'', the line of sight velocity distribution of the absorption lines has twodistinct peaks, and can be decomposed into a fast-rotating component withv/sigma &gt; 3, and a slower rotating, retrograde component with v/sigma between 1-- 1.5. the radial surface brightness profile of the counter-rotating componentfollows that of the bulge, obtained from a 2-dimensional bulge-diskdecomposition of a near-infrared k-band image, while the fast rotatingcomponent follows the disk. at the radius where the disk starts to dominate theisophotes change from being considerably boxy to very disky.  although a number of spiral galaxies have been found that contain cold,couter-rotating disks, this is the first galaxy known to have a boxy, probablytriaxial, fairly warm, counter-rotating component, which is dominating in thecentral regions. if it is a bar seen end-on, this bar has to be thicker thanthe disk. we find that ngc 7331, even though it is a fairly early-type spiral,does not have a conventional, co-rotating bulge. the fact that the innercomponent is retrograde makes us believe that it was formed from infallingmaterial, in either stellar or gaseous form (e.g. balcells &amp; quinn 1990).another possibility however is that the structure has been there since theformation of the galaxy. in this case it will be a challenge to explain thelarge change in orientation of the angular momentum when going outwardradially.

astro-ph;9605112	a new chemo-evolutionary population synthesis model for early-type  galaxies. i: theoretical basis	we have developed a new stellar population synthesis model designed to studyearly-type galaxies. it provides optical and near-infrared colors, and lineindices for 25 absorption lines. it can synthesize single age, singlemetallicity stellar populations or follow the galaxy through its evolution froman initial gas cloud to the present time. the model incorporates the newisochrones of the padova group and the latest stellar spectral libraries. themodel has been extensively compared with previous ones in the literature toestablish its accuracy as well as the accuracy of this kind of models ingeneral.  using the evolutionary version of the model we find that we cannot fit themost metal-rich elliptical galaxies if we keep the imf constant and do notallow infall of gas. we do however reproduce the results of arimoto \&amp; yoshii(1986) for the evolution of the gas, and produce colors, and, for the firsttime with this type of models, absorption line-strengths. it is in factpossible to fit the data for the elliptical galaxies by varying the imf withtime. our numerical model is in good broad agreement with the analytical'simple model'. in the present paper we describe the model, and compare a fewkey observables with new data for three early-type {\em standard} galaxies.however the data, as well as our fits, will be discussed in much more detail ina second paper (vazdekis {\it et al.} 1996), where some conclusions will bedrawn about elliptical galaxies on the basis of this model.

astro-ph;9707074	the z-structure of disk galaxies towards the galaxy planes	we present a detailed study of a statistically complete sample of highlyinclined disk galaxies in the near-infrared k' band. since the k'-band light isrelatively insensitive to contamination by galactic dust, we have been able tofollow the vertical light distributions all the way down to the galaxy planes.the mean levels for the sharpness of the k'-band luminosity peaks indicate thatthe vertical luminosity distributions are more peaked than expected for theintermediate sech(z) distribution, but rounder than exponential. sinceprojection of not completely edge-on galaxies onto the plane of the sky causesvertical luminosity profiles to become rounder, we have performed simulationsthat show that it is possible that all our galaxies can have intrinsicallyexponential vertical surface brightness distributions. we find that the profileshape is independent of galaxy type, and varies little with position along themajor axis. the fact that we observe this in all our sample galaxies indicatesthat the formation process of the galaxy disks perpendicular to the galaxyplanes is a process intrinsic to the disks themselves.
