0902.3025	structure and substructure of galactic spheroids	the full spatio-chemo-dynamical structure of galaxies of all types andenvironments at low redshift provides a critical accompaniment to observationsof galaxy formation at high redshift. the next decade brings the observationalopportunity to strongly constrain nearby galaxies' histories of star formationand assembly, especially in the spheroids that comprise the large majority ofthe stellar mass in the universe but have until now been difficult to study. inorder to constrain the pathways to building up the spheroidal "red-sequence",various standard techniques in photometry and spectroscopy, particularly withresolved tracer populations like globular clusters and planetary nebulae, canbe scaled up to comprehensive surveys as improved wide-field instrumentation isincreasingly available. at the same time, progress in adaptive optics on gianttelescopes could for the first time permit deep, resolved photometric andspectroscopic analysis of large samples of individual stars in these systems,thereby revolutionizing galaxy studies. strong theoretical support is needed inorder to understand the new observational constraints via detailed modeling andself-consistent simulations of star and galaxy formation throughout cosmictime.

0905.1958	the edge of the m87 halo and the kinematics of the diffuse light in the  virgo cluster core	we present high resolution flames/vlt spectroscopy of intracluster planetarynebula (icpn) candidates, targeting three new fields in the virgo cluster corewith surface brightness down to mu_b = 28.5. based on the projected phase spaceinformation we separate the old and 12 newly-confirmed pns into galaxy andintracluster components. the m87 pns are confined to the extended stellarenvelope of m87, within a projected radius of ~ 160 kpc, while the icpns arescattered across the whole surveyed region between m87 and m86. the velocitydispersions determined from the m87 pns at projected radii of 60 kpc and 144kpc show that the galaxy's velocity dispersion profile decreases in the outerhalo, down to 78 +/- 25 km/s. a jeans model for the m87 halo stars in thegravitational potential traced by the x-ray emission fits the observed velocitydispersion profile only if the stellar orbits are strongly radially anisotropic(beta ~= 0.4 at r ~= 10 kpc increasing to 0.8 at the outer edge), and ifadditionally the stellar halo is truncated at ~= 150 kpc average ellipticalradius. from the spatial and velocity distribution of the icpns we infer thatm87 and m86 are falling towards each other and that we may be observing themjust before the first close pass. the inferred luminosity-specific pn numbersfor the m87 halo and the icl are in the range of values observed for old (&gt; 10gyr) stellar populations (abridged).

0908.0531	planetary nebulae in face-on spiral galaxies. ii. planetary nebula  spectroscopy	as the second step in our investigation of the mass-to-light ratio of spiraldisks, we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of planetary nebulae(pne) in five nearby, low-inclination galaxies: ic 342, m74 (ngc 628), m83 (ngc5236), m94 (ngc 4736), and m101 (ngc 5457). using 50 setups of the wiyn/hydraand blanco/hydra spectrographs, and 25 observations with the hobby-eberlytelescope's medium resolution spectrograph, we determine the radial velocitiesof 99, 102, 162, 127, and 48 pne, respectively, to a precision better than 15km/s. although the main purpose of this data set is to facilitate dynamicalmass measurements throughout the inner and outer disks of large spiralgalaxies, our spectroscopy has other uses as well. here, we co-add thesespectra to show that to first order, the [o iii] and balmer line ratios ofplanetary nebulae vary little over the top ~1.5 mag of the planetary nebulaluminosity function. the only obvious spectral change occurs with [n ii], whichincreases in strength as one proceeds down the luminosity function. we alsoshow that typical [o iii]-bright planetaries have e(b-v) ~ 0.2 of circumstellarextinction, and that this value is virtually independent of [o iii] luminosity.we discuss the implications this has for understanding the population of pnprogenitors.

0909.4281	astrometry with the hubble space telescope: trigonometric parallaxes of  planetary nebula nuclei: ngc 6853, ngc 7293, abell 31, and deht 5	we present absolute parallaxes and relative proper motions for the centralstars of the planetary nebulae ngc 6853 (the dumbbell), ngc 7293 (the helix),abell 31, and deht 5. this paper details our reduction and analysis using deht5 as an example. we obtain these planetary nebula nuclei (pnni) parallaxes withastrometric data from fine guidance sensors fgs 1r and fgs 3, white-lightinterferometers on the hubble space telescope (hst). proper motions, spectralclassifications and vjhkt_2m and ddo51 photometry of the stars comprising theastrometric reference frames provide spectrophotometric estimates of referencestar absolute parallaxes. introducing these into our model as observations witherror, we determine absolute parallaxes for each pnn. weighted averaging withprevious independent parallax measurements yields an average parallaxprecision, \sigma_{\pi}/\pi = 5 %. derived distances are: d_{ngc6853}=405^{+28}_{-25}pc, d_{ngc 7293}=216^{+14}_{-12} pc, d_{abell 31} =621^{+91}_{-70} pc, and d_{deht 5} = 345^{+19}_{-17} pc. these pnni distancesare all smaller than previously derived from spectroscopic analyses of thecentral stars. derived absolute magnitudes and previously measured effectivetemperatures permit estimates of pnni radii, through both the stefan-boltzmannrelation and eddington fluxes. comparing absolute magnitudes with post-agbmodels provides mass estimates. masses cluster around 0.57 m(sun), close to thepeak of the white dwarf mass distribution. adding a few more pnni withwell-determined distances and masses, we compare all the pnni with cooler whitedwarfs of similar mass, and confirm, as expected, that pnni have larger radiithan white dwarfs that have reached their final cooling tracks.

0909.4356	the planetary nebula luminosity function: pieces of the puzzle	extragalactic surveys in the emission line of [o iii] 5007 have provided uswith the absolute line strengths of large, homogeneous sets of planetarynebulae. these data have been used to address a host of problems, from themeasurement of the extragalactic distance scale, to the study of stellarpopulations. i review our current understanding of the [o iii] planetary nebulaluminosity function (pnlf), and discuss some of the physical processes thateffect its structure. i also describe the features of the h-alpha pnlf, afunction that, upon first glance, looks similar to the [o iii] pnlf, but whichincludes a very different set of objects. finally, i discuss recentmeasurements of alpha, the number of pne found in a stellar population,normalized to that population's bolometric luminosity. i show that, contrary toexpectations, the values of alpha found in actively star-forming spirals isessentially the same as those measured in late-type elliptical and lenticularsystems. i discuss how this result sheds light on the physics of the planetarynebula phenomenon.

0910.0266	planetary nebulae in face-on spiral galaxies. iii. planetary nebula  kinematics and disk mass	much of our understanding of dark matter halos comes from the assumption thatthe mass-to-light ratio (m/l) of spiral disks is constant. the best way to testthis hypothesis is to measure the disk surface mass density directly via thekinematics of old disk stars. to this end, we have used planetary nebulae (pne)as test particles and have measured the vertical velocity dispersion (sigma_z)throughout the disks of five nearby, low-inclination spiral galaxies: ic 342,m74 (ngc 628), m83 (ngc 5236), m94 (ngc 4736), and m101 (ngc 5457). by using hito map galactic rotation and the epicyclic approximation to extract sigma_zfrom the line-of-sight dispersion, we find that, with the lone exception ofm101, our disks do have a constant m/l out to ~3 optical scale lengths.however, once outside this radius, sigma_z stops declining and becomes flatwith radius. possible explanations for this behavior include an increase in thedisk mass-to-light ratio, an increase in the importance of the thick disk, andheating of the thin disk by halo substructure. we also find that the disks ofearly type spirals have higher values of m/l and are closer to maximal than thedisks of later-type spirals, and that the unseen inner halos of these systemsare better fit by pseudo-isothermal laws than by nfw models.

1002.2432	evidence for spatially compact lyman alpha emission in z=3.1  lyman-alpha-emitting galaxies	we present the results of a high-spatial-resolution study of the lineemission in a sample of z=3.1 lyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (laes) in theextended chandra deep field-south. of the eight objects with coverage in ourhst/wfpc2 narrow-band imaging, two have clear detections and an additional twoare barely detected (~2-sigma). the clear detections are within ~0.5 kpc of thecentroid of the corresponding rest-uv continuum source, suggesting that theline-emitting gas and young stars in laes are spatially coincident. thebrightest object exhibits extended emission with a half-light radius of ~1.5kpc, but a stack of the remaining lae surface brightness profiles is consistentwith the wfpc2 point spread function. this suggests that the lyman alphaemission in these objects originates from a compact (&lt;~2 kpc) region and cannotbe significantly more extended than the far-uv continuum emission (&lt;~1 kpc).comparing our wfpc2 photometry to previous ground-based measurements of theirmonochromatic fluxes, we find at 95% (99.7%) confidence that we cannot bemissing more than 22% (32%) of the lyman alpha emission.

1007.4842	the absolute magnitudes of type ia supernovae in the ultraviolet	we examine the absolute magnitudes and light-curve shapes of 14nearby(redshift z = 0.004--0.027) type ia supernovae (sne~ia) observed in theultraviolet (uv) with the swift ultraviolet/optical telescope. colors andabsolute magnitudes are calculated using both a standard milky way (mw)extinction law and one for the large magellanic cloud that has been modified bycircumstellar scattering. we find very different behavior in the near-uvfilters (uvw1_rc covering ~2600-3300 a after removing optical light, and u~3000--4000 a) compared to a mid-uv filter (uvm2 ~2000-2400 a). the uvw1_rc-bcolors show a scatter of ~0.3 mag while uvm2-b scatters by nearly 0.9 mag.similarly, while the scatter in colors between neighboring filters is small inthe optical and somewhat larger in the near-uv, the large scatter in theuvm2-uvw1 colors implies significantly larger spectral variability below 2600a. we find that in the near-uv the absolute magnitudes at peak brightness ofnormal sne ia in our sample are correlated with the optical decay rate with ascatter of 0.4 mag, comparable to that found for the optical in our sample.however, in the mid-uv the scatter is larger, ~1 mag, possibly indicatingdifferences in metallicity. we find no strong correlation between either the uvlight-curve shapes or the uv colors and the uv absolute magnitudes. with largersamples, the uv luminosity might be useful as an additional constraint to helpdetermine distance, extinction, and metallicity in order to improve the utilityof sne ia as standardized candles.

1011.0426	hetdex pilot survey for emission-line galaxies - i. survey design,  performance, and catalog	we present a catalog of emission-line galaxies selected solely by theiremission-line fluxes using a wide-field integral field spectrograph. this workis partially motivated as a pilot survey for the upcoming hobby-eberlytelescope dark energy experiment (hetdex). we describe the observations,reductions, detections, redshift classifications, line fluxes, and counterpartinformation for 397 emission-line galaxies detected over 169 sq.arcmin with a3500-5800 ang. bandpass under 5 ang. full-width-half-maximum (fwhm) spectralresolution. the survey's best sensitivity for unresolved objects underphotometric conditions is between 4-20 e-17 erg/s/sq.cm depending on thewavelength, and ly-alpha luminosities between 3-6 e42 erg/s are detectable.this survey method complements narrowband and color-selection techniques in thesearch for high redshift galaxies with its different selection properties andlarge volume probed. the four survey fields within the cosmos, goods-n, munics,and xmm-lss areas are rich with existing, complementary data. we find 104galaxies via their high redshift ly-alpha emission at 1.9&lt;z&lt;3.8, and themajority of the remainder objects are low redshift [oii]3727 emitters atz&lt;0.56. the classification between low and high redshift objects depends onrest frame equivalent width, as well as other indicators, where available.based on matches to x-ray catalogs, the active galactic nuclei (agn) fractionamongst the ly-alpha emitters (laes) is 6%. we also analyze the survey'scompleteness and contamination properties through simulations. we find fivehigh-z, highly-significant, resolved objects with full-width-half-maximum sizes&gt;44 sq.arcsec which appear to be extended ly-alpha nebulae. we also find threehigh-z objects with rest frame ly-alpha equivalent widths above the levelbelieved to be achievable with normal star formation, ew(rest)&gt;240 ang.

1011.0431	the hetdex pilot survey iii: the low metallicities of high-redshift  lyman alpha galaxies	we present keck/nirspec spectroscopic observations of three lyman alphaemitting galaxies (laes) at z ~ 2.3 discovered with the hetdex pilot survey. wedetect halpha, [oiii], and hbeta emission from two galaxies at z = 2.29 and2.49, designated hps194 and hps256, respectively, representing the firstdetection of multiple rest-frame optical emission lines in galaxies athigh-redshift selected on the basis of their lyman alpha emission. theredshifts of the lyman alpha emission from these galaxies are offset redward ofthe systemic redshifts by delta_v = 162 +/- 37 (photometric) +/- 42(systematic) km/s for hps194, and delta_v = 36 +/- 35 +/- 18 km/s for hps256.an interpretation for hps194 is that a large-scale outflow may be occurring inits interstellar medium. the emission line ratios imply that neither lae hostsan active galactic nucleus. using the upper limits on the [nii] emission weplace meaningful constraints on the gas-phase metallicities in these two laesof z &lt; 0.17 and &lt; 0.28 zsol (1 sigma). measuring the stellar masses of theseobjects via spectral energy distribution (sed) fitting (~ 10^10 and 6 x 10^8msol, respectively), we study the nature of laes in a mass-metallicity plane.at least one of these two laes appears to be more metal poor thancontinuum-selected star-forming galaxies at the same redshift and stellar mass,implying that objects exhibiting lyman alpha emission may be systematicallyless chemically enriched than the general galaxy population. we use the seds ofthese two galaxies to show that neglecting the emission lines when fittingstellar population models to the observed photometry can result inoverestimates of the population age by orders of magnitude, and the stellarmass by a factor of ~ 2. this effect is particularly important at z &gt; 7, wheresimilarly strong emission lines may masquerade in the photometry as a 4000 abreak (abridged).

1101.3017	ly-alpha emitting galaxies at z = 2.1: stellar masses, dust and star  formation histories from spectral energy distribution fitting	we study the physical properties of 216 z ~ 2.1 laes discovered in anultra-deep narrow-band musyc image of the ecdf-s. we fit their stacked spectralenergy distribution (sed) using charlot &amp; bruzual templates. we consider starformation histories parametrized by the e-folding time parameter tau, allowingfor exponentially decreasing (tau&gt;0), exponentially increasing (tau&lt;0), andconstant star formation rates. these laes are characterized by best fitparameters and 68% confidence intervals of log(m_*/m_sun)=8.6[8.4-9.1],e(b-v)=0.22[0.00-0.31], tau=-0.02[(-4)-18] gyr, and age_ sf=0.018[0.009-3] gyr.thus, we obtain robust measurements of low stellar mass and dust content, butwe cannot place meaningful constraints on the age or star formation history ofthe laes. we also calculate the instantaneous sfr to be 35[0.003-170] m_sun/yr,with its average over the last 100 myr before observation giving&lt;sfr&gt;_100=4[2-30] m_sun/yr. when we compare the results for the same starformation history, laes at z~2.1 are dustier and show higher instantaneous sfrsthan z~3.1 laes, while the observed stellar masses of the two samples seemconsistent. laes appear to occupy the low-mass end of the distribution of starforming galaxies at z~2. we perform sed fitting on several sub-samples selectedbased on photometric properties and find that lae sub-samples at z~2.1 exhibitheterogeneous properties. the irac-bright, uv-bright and red laes have thelargest stellar mass and dust reddening. the uv-faint, irac-faint, and highequivalent width lae sub-samples appear less massive (&lt;10^9 m_sun) and lessdusty, with e(b-v) consistent with zero.

1106.2811	x-ray constraints on the lyman-alpha escape fraction	we have coadded x-ray flux of all known lyman alpha emitters (laes) in the 4msec chandra deep field south (cdf-s) region, to place sensitive upper limitson the average unobscured star-formation rate (sfr_x) in these galaxies. a verysmall fraction of lyman-alpha galaxies in the field are individually detectedin the x-rays, implying a low fraction of agn activity. after excluding the fewx-ray detected laes, we stack the undetected laes located in the 4 ms cdf-sdata and 250 ks extended cdf-s (ecdfs) data, and compute a 1-\sigma upper limiton sfr_x &lt; 14, 28, 28, 140, 440, 880 m$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ for laes located at z= 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 4.5, 5.7 and 6.5, respectively. the upper limit of sfr_x inlaes can be then be compared to sfr$_{ly\alpha}$ derived from lyman-alpha lineand thus can constrain on the lyman-alpha escape fraction($f^{esc}_{ly\alpha}$). we derive a lower limit on f(lyman-alpha escape) &gt; 14%(84 % confidence level, 1-\sigma lower limit) for laes at redshift z ~ 2.1 andz ~ 3.1-3.2. at z &gt; 4, the current lae samples are not of sufficient size toconstrain sfr_x well. by averaging all the laes at z&gt; 2, the x-raynon-detection constrains f(lyman-alpha escape) &gt; 17% (84 % confidence level,1-\sigma lower limit), and rejects f(lyman-alpha escape) &lt; 5.7% at the 99.87%confidence level from 2.1 &lt; z &lt; 6.5.

1203.5551	the planetary nebula luminosity function at the dawn of gaia	the [o iii] 5007 planetary nebula luminosity function (pnlf) is an excellentextragalactic standard candle. in theory, the pnlf method should not work atall, since the luminosities of the brightest planetary nebulae (pne) should behighly sensitive to the age of their host stellar population. yet the methodappears robust, as it consistently produces &lt; 10% distances to galaxies of allhubble types, from the earliest ellipticals to the latest-type spirals andirregulars. it is therefore uniquely suited for cross-checking the results ofother techniques and finding small offsets between the population i andpopulation ii distance ladders. we review the calibration of the method andshow that the zero points provided by cepheids and the tip of the red giantbranch are in excellent agreement. we then compare the results of the pnlf withthose from surface brightness fluctuation measurements, and show that, althoughboth techniques agree in a relative sense, the latter method yields distancesthat are ~15% larger than those from the pnlf. we trace this discrepancy backto the calibration galaxies and argue that, due to a small systematic errorassociated with internal reddening, the true distance scale likely fallsbetween the extremes of the two methods. we also demonstrate how pnlfmeasurements in the early-type galaxies that have hosted type ia supernovae canhelp calibrate the sn ia maximum magnitude-rate of decline relation. finally,we discuss how the results from space missions such as kepler and gaia can helpour understanding of the pnlf phenomenon and improve our knowledge of thephysics of local planetary nebulae.

1209.5842	escape of lyman-alpha and continuum photons from star-forming galaxies	a large number of high-redshift galaxies have been discovered via theirnarrow-band lya line or broad-band continuum colors in recent years. the natureof the escaping process of photons from these early galaxies is crucial tounderstanding galaxy evolution and the cosmic reionization. here, weinvestigate the escape of lya, non-ionizing uv-continuum (l = 1300 - 1600angstrom in rest frame), and ionizing photons (l &lt; 912 angstrom) from galaxiesby combining a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation with three-dimensionalmulti-wavelength radiative transfer calculations. the galaxies are simulated ina box of 5^3 h^-3 mpc^3 with high resolutions using the aquila initialcondition which reproduces a milky way-like galaxy at redshift z=0. we findthat the escape fraction (fesc) of these different photons shows a complexdependence on redshift and galaxy properties: fesc(lya) and fesc(uv) appear toevolve with redshift, and they show similar, weak correlations with galaxyproperties such as mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust content, whilefesc(ion) remains roughly constant at ~ 0.2 from z ~ 0 - 10, and it does notshow clear dependence on galaxy properties. fesc(lya) correlates more stronglywith fesc(uv) than with fesc(ion). in addition, we find a relation between theemergent lya luminosity and the ionizing photon emissivity of lyman alphaemitters (laes). by combining this relation with the observed luminosityfunctions of laes at different redshift, we estimate the contribution from laesto the reionization of intergalactic medium (igm). our result suggests thationizing photons from laes alone are not sufficient to ionize igm at z &gt; 6, butthey can maintain the ionization of igm at z ~ 0 - 5.

1306.4157	galaxy redshift surveys with sparse sampling	survey observations of the three-dimensional locations of galaxies are apowerful approach to measure the distribution of matter in the universe, whichcan be used to learn about the nature of dark energy, physics of inflation,neutrino masses, etc. a competitive survey, however, requires a large volume(e.g., vsurvey is roughly 10 gpc3) to be covered, and thus tends to beexpensive. a "sparse sampling" method offers a more affordable solution to thisproblem: within a survey footprint covering a given survey volume, vsurvey, weobserve only a fraction of the volume. the distribution of observed regionsshould be chosen such that their separation is smaller than the length scalecorresponding to the wavenumber of interest. then one can recover the powerspectrum of galaxies with precision expected for a survey covering a volume ofvsurvey (rather than the volume of the sum of observed regions) with the numberdensity of galaxies given by the total number of observed galaxies divided byvsurvey (rather than the number density of galaxies within an observed region).we find that regularly-spaced sampling yields an unbiased power spectrum withno window function effect, and deviations from regularly-spaced sampling, whichare unavoidable in realistic surveys, introduce calculable window functioneffects and increase the uncertainties of the recovered power spectrum. whilewe discuss the sparse sampling method within the context of the forthcominghobby-eberly telescope dark energy experiment, the method is general and can beapplied to other galaxy surveys.

1308.1957	the spectrally resolved lyman-alpha emission of three lyman-alpha  selected field galaxies at z~2.4 from the hetdex pilot survey	we present new results on the spectrally resolved lyman-alpha (lya) emissionof three lya emitting field galaxies at z~2.4 with high lya equivalent width(&gt;100 angstroms) and lya luminosity (~10^43 erg/s). at 120 km/s (fwhm) spectralresolution, the prominent double-peaked lya profile straddles the systemicvelocity, where the velocity zero-point is determined from spectroscopy of thegalaxies' rest-frame optical nebular emission lines. the average velocityoffset from systemic of the stronger redshifted emission component for oursample is 176 km/s while the average total separation between the redshiftedand main blueshifted emission components is 380 km/s. these measurements are afactor of ~2 smaller than for uv continuum-selected galaxies that show lya inemission with lower lya equivalent width. we compare our lya spectra to thepredicted line profiles of a spherical "expanding shell" lya radiative transfergrid that models large-scale galaxy outflows. specifically blueward of thesystemic velocity where two galaxies show a weak, highly blueshifted (by ~1000km/s) tertiary emission peak, the model line profiles are a relatively poorrepresentation of the observed spectra. since the neutral gas column densityhas a dominant influence over the shape of the lya line profile, we cautionagainst equating the observed lya velocity offset with a physical outflowvelocity, especially at lower spectral resolution where the unresolved lyavelocity offset is a convoluted function of several degenerate parameters.referring to rest-frame ultraviolet and optical hubble space telescope imaging,we find that galaxy-galaxy interactions may play an important role in inducinga starburst that results in copious lya emission, as well as perturbing the gasdistribution and velocity field which have strong influence over the lyaemission line profile.

1309.6341	to stack or not to stack: spectral energy distribution properties of  lya-emitting galaxies at z=2.1	we use the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey(candels) goods-s multi-wavelength catalog to identify counterparts for 20 lyaemitting (lae) galaxies at z=2.1. we build several types of stacked spectralenergy distributions (seds) of these objects. we combine photometry to formaverage and median flux-stacked seds, and postage stamp images to form averageand median image-stacked seds. we also introduce scaled flux stacks thateliminate the influence of variation in overall brightness. we use the sedfitting code speedymc to constrain the physical properties of individualobjects and stacks. our laes at z = 2.1 have stellar masses ranging from 2x10^7msun - 8x10^9 msun (median = 3x10^8 msun), ages ranging from 4 myr to 500 myr(median =100 myr), and e(b-v) between 0.02 and 0.24 (median = 0.12). we do notobserve strong correlations between lya equivalent width (ew) and stellar mass,age, or e(b-v). the lya radiative transfer (q) factors of our sample arepredominantly close to one and do not correlate strongly with ew or e(b-v),implying that lya radiative transfer prevents lya photons from resonantlyscattering in dusty regions. the sed parameters of the flux stacks match theaverage and median values of the individual objects, with the flux-scaledmedian sed performing best with reduced uncertainties. median image-stackedseds provide a poor representation of the median individual object, and none ofthe stacking methods captures the large dispersion of lae properties.

1501.02801	the biases of optical line-ratio selection for active galactic nuclei,  and the intrinsic relationship between black hole accretion and galaxy star  formation	we use 317,000 emission-line galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey toinvestigate line-ratio selection of active galactic nuclei (agns). inparticular, we demonstrate that "star formation dilution" by hii regions causesa significant bias against agn selection in low-mass, blue, star-forming,disk-dominated galaxies. this bias is responsible for the observed preferenceof agns among high-mass, green, moderately star-forming, bulge-dominated hosts.we account for the bias and simulate the intrinsic population of emission-lineagns using a physically-motivated eddington ratio distribution, intrinsic agnnarrow line region line ratios, a luminosity-dependent lbol/l[oiii] bolometriccorrection, and the observed mbh-sigma relation. these simulations indicatethat, in massive (log(m*/msun) &gt; 10) galaxies, agn accretion is correlated withspecific star formation rate but is otherwise uniform with stellar mass. thereis some hint of lower black hole occupation in low-mass (log(m*/msun) &lt; 10)hosts, although our modeling is limited by uncertainties in measuring andinterpreting the velocity dispersions of low-mass galaxies. the presence ofstar formation dilution means that agns contribute little to the observedstrong optical emission lines (e.g., [oiii] and ha) in low-mass andstar-forming hosts. however the agn population recovered by our modelingindicates that feedback by typical (low- to moderate-accretion) low-redshiftagns has nearly uniform efficiency at all stellar masses, star formation rates,and morphologies. taken together, our characterization of the observationalbias and resultant agn occupation function suggest that agns are unlikely to bethe dominant source of star formation quenching in galaxies, but instead arefueled by the same gas which drives star formation activity.

(2014). weconstruct mock lae catalogs to predict the cosmic evolution of this structure.we find that such an overdensity should have already broken away from thehubble flow, and part of the structure will collapse to form a galaxy clusterwith 10^14.5 +- 0.4 m_sun by z = 0. the structure contains a higher medianstellar mass of broad-band selected galaxies, a boost of extended lya nebulae,and a marginal excess of active galactic nuclei relative to the field,supporting a scenario of accelerated galaxy evolution in cluster progenitors.based on the correlation between galaxy overdensity and the z = 0 descendanthalo mass calibrated in the simulation, we predict that several hundred 1.9 &lt; z&lt; 3.5 proto-clusters with z = 0 mass of &gt; 10^14.5 m_sun will be discovered inthe 8.5 gpc^3 of space surveyed by the hobby eberly telescope dark energyexperiment.

0805.2952	very broad [o iii]4959,5007 emission from the ngc 4472 globular cluster  rz2109 and implications for the mass of its black hole x-ray source	we present keck lris spectroscopy of the black hole-hosting globular clusterrz2109 in the virgo elliptical galaxy ngc 4472. we find that this object hasextraordinarily broad [oiii]5007 and [oiii]4959 emission lines, with velocitywidths of approximately 2,000 k/ms. this result has significant implicationsfor the nature of this accreting black-hole system and the mass of the globularcluster black hole. we show that the broad [oiii]5007 emission must arise frommaterial driven at high velocity from the black hole system. this is becausethe volume available near the black hole is too small by many orders ofmagnitude to have enough [oiii] emitting atoms to account for the observedl([oiii]5007) at high velocities, even if this volume is filled with oxygen atthe critical density for [oiii]5007. the balmer emission is also weak,indicating the observed [oiii] is not due to shocks. we therefore conclude thatthe [oiii]4959,5007 is produced by photoionization of material driven acrossthe cluster. the only known way to drive significant material at high velocityis for a system accreting mass near or above its eddington limit, whichindicates a stellar mass black hole. since it is dynamically implausible toform an accreting stellar mass black hole system in a globular cluster with anintermediate mass black hole (imbh), it appears this massive globular clusterdoes not have an imbh. we discuss further tests of this conclusion, and itsimplications for the m_bh - m_stellar and m_bh - sigma relations.

astro-ph;0110456	a measurement of the contamination in [oiii] lambda 5007 surveys of  intracluster stars and the surface density of z=3.13 ly-alpha galaxies	we present two pieces of evidence supporting the hypothesis that the bright[oiii] lambda 5007 sources found in virgo's intracluster space are intraclusterplanetary nebulae, rather than [oii] lambda 3727 galaxies at z ~ 0.35 orly-alpha sources at z ~ 3.13. first, we confirm the nature of five``overluminous'' [oiii] sources that are postulated to lie in front of m87: byexamining the composite spectrum of these objects, we show that the weaker[oiii] line at lambda 4959 is definitely present at a strength ~ 1/3 that of[oiii] lambda 5007. the ratio demonstrates that, at most, only one of the fiveobjects is a background galaxy. we then estimate the surface density ofbackground emission-line objects by conducting a wide-field (0.13 deg^2) searchat lambda 5019 for faint emission line sources in a ``blank field'' locatedwell away from any galaxy or cluster. we show that the density of blank fieldemission-line sources is significantly lower than the density of sourcesdetected between the galaxies of virgo, but in good agreement with the densityof ly-alpha galaxies found by hu, cowie, &amp; mcmahon(1998). the implication isthat background galaxies only account for ~20% of the planetary nebulacandidates in virgo's intracluster fields.

astro-ph;0201219	intracluster red giant stars in the virgo cluster	we have used the wfpc2 camera of the hubble space telescope to obtain deepf814w images of a blank field in the virgo cluster located 41 arcmin northwestof m87. we perform star counts in that field, and in another virgo fieldobserved by ferguson, tanvir &amp; von hippel (1998), and show that, when comparedto the hubble deep field north and south, the virgo cluster contains an excessof objects with magnitudes i &gt; 27. we attribute this excess to a population ofintracluster red-giant branch (ic-rgb) stars. by modeling the luminosityfunction of these stars, we show that the tip of the virgo rgb is at i = 27.31+0.27/-0.17 and that the cluster contains a small, but significant, excess ofstars that are up to ~1 mag brighter than this tip. if this luminous componentis due entirely to stars on the asymptotic giant branch (agb), it implies anage for the population of &gt; 2 gyr; if foreground rgb stars contribute to theluminous tail, then the derived age for the stars is older still. theluminosity function also suggests that most of the intracluster stars aremoderately metal-rich (-0.8 &lt; [fe/h] &lt;-0.2), a result consistent with thatexpected from stars that have been tidally stripped from intermediateluminosity galaxies. additionally, a comparison with the planetary nebulae inour field also supports this view, although the existence of a more metal-poorpopulation (from stripped dwarfs) cannot be ruled out. our derived averagesurface brightness, mu_i = 27.9 +0.3/-0.5 mag/arcsec^2 for virgo's diffusecomponent suggests that intracluster stars contribute 10% to 20% of thecluster's total i-band luminosity.

astro-ph;0301279	distances from planetary nebulae	the [o iii] 5007 planetary nebula luminosity function (pnlf) occupies animportant place on the extragalactic distance ladder. since it is the onlymethod that is applicable to all the large galaxies of the local supercluster,it is uniquely useful for cross-checking results and linking the population iand population ii distance scales. we review the physics underlying the method,demonstrate its precision, and illustrate its value by comparing its distancesto distances obtained from cepheids and the surface brightness fluctuation(sbf) method. we use the cepheid and pnlf distances to 13 galaxies to show thatthe metallicity dependence of the pnlf cutoff is in excellent agreement withthat predicted from theory, and that no additional systematic corrections areneeded for either method. however, when we compare the cepheid-calibrated pnlfdistance scale with the cepheid-calibrated sbf distance scale, we find asignificant offset: although the relative distances of both methods are inexcellent agreement, the pnlf method produces results that are systematicallyshorter by about 15%. we trace this discrepancy back to the calibrationgalaxies and show how a small amount of internal reddening can lead to a verylarge systematic error. finally, we demonstrate how the pnlf and cepheiddistances to ngc 4258 argue for a short distance to the large magellanic cloud,and a hubble constant that is about 8% larger than that derived by the hst keyproject.

astro-ph;0406462	the planetary nebula system of m33	we report the results of a photometric and spectroscopic survey for planetarynebulae (pne) in the local group spiral galaxy m33. we use our sample of 152pne to derive an [o iii] planetary nebula luminosity function (pnlf) distanceof (m-m)_0 = 24.86^+0.07-0.11 (0.94^+0.03-0.05 mpc). although this value is ~15% larger than the galaxy's cepheid distance, the discrepancy likely arisesfrom differing assumptions about the system's internal extinction. ourphotometry (which extends &gt;3 mag down the pnlf), also reveals that thefaint-end of m33's pn luminosity function is non-monotonic, with an inflectionpoint ~2 mag below the pnlf cutoff. we argue that this feature is due to thegalaxy's large population of high core-mass planetaries, and that its amplitudemay eventually be useful as a diagnostic for studies of stellar populations.  fiber-coupled spectroscopy of 140 of the pn candidates confirms that m33's pnpopulation rotates along with the old disk, with a small asymmetric drift of \~10km/s. remarkably, the population's line-of-sight velocity dispersion varieslittle over ~4 optical disk scale lengths, with sigma_{rad}~20km/s. we showthat this is due to a combination of factors, including a decline in the radialcomponent of the velocity ellipsoid at small galactocentric radii, and agradient in the ratio of the vertical to radial velocity dispersion. we use ourdata to show that the mass scale length of m33's disk is ~2.3 times larger thanthat of the system's ir luminosity and that the disk's v-band mass-to-lightratio changes from m/l_v ~0.3 in the galaxy's inner regions to m/l_v ~2.0 at ~9kpc. models in which the dark matter is distributed in the plane of the galaxyare excluded by our data.

astro-ph;0509810	planetary nebula studies of face-on spiral galaxies: is the disk  mass-to-light ratio constant?	when astronomers study the dark matter halos of spiral galaxies, theynormally assume that the disk mass-to-light ratio is *constant*. we describe amethod of analyzing the kinematics of planetary nebulae (pne) in nearby face-onspiral galaxies to test this assumption. since the restoring force for stellarmotions perpendicular to the galactic disk is proportional to the disk masssurface density, measurements of the vertical velocity dispersion can be usedto produce an independent measure of the total amount of matter in the disk.our steps are: (1) to identify a population of pne by imaging the host spiralin several filters, and (2) to isolate the vertical velocity dispersion fromspectroscopic observations of the pne. our first results for the pne of m33indicate that the mass-to-light ratio of the galaxy's disk actually *increases*by more than a factor of 5 over the inner 6 disk scale lengths. we have begunsimilar studies of the pne in five more face-on galaxies: m83, m101, m94, ngc6946, and m74. these data will also produce additional science such as galaxydistances and constraints on the disk transparency.

astro-ph;9803062	intracluster planetary nebulae in the virgo cluster i. initial results	we report the initial results of a survey for intracluster planetary nebulaein the virgo cluster. in two 16' x 16' fields, we identify 69 and 16intracluster planetary nebula candidates, respectively. in a third 16' x 16'field near the central elliptical galaxy m87, we detect 75 planetary nebulacandidates, of which a substantial fraction are intracluster in nature. byexamining the number of the planetaries detected in each field and the shape ofthe planetary nebula luminosity function, we show that 1) the intraclusterstarlight of virgo is distributed non-uniformly, and varies between subclumps aand b, 2) the virgo cluster core extends ~3 mpc in front of m87, and thus iselongated along the line-of-sight, and 3) a minimum of 22% of virgo's stellarluminosity resides between the galaxies in our fields, and that the true numbermay be considerably larger. we also use our planetary nebula data to argue thatthe intracluster stars in virgo are likely derived from a population that is ofmoderate age and metallicity.

astro-ph;9812165	chemical abundances of planetary nebulae in the bulge and disk of m31	we derive abundances and central star parameters for 15 planetary nebulae(pne) in m31: 12 in the bulge and 3 in a disk field 14 kpc from the nucleus. nosingle abundance value characterizes the bulge stars: although the medianabundances of the sample are similar to those seen for pne in the lmc, thedistribution of abundances is several times broader, spanning over 1 decade.none of the pne in our sample approach the super metal-rich ([fe/h] ~ +0.25)expectations for the bulge of m31, although a few pne in the sample ofstasinska, richer, &amp; mc~call (1998) come close. this [o/h] vs [fe/h]discrepancy is likely due to a combination of factors, including an inabilityof metal-rich stars to produce bright pne, a luminosity selection effect, andan abundance gradient in the bulge of m31. we show that pne that are near thebright limit of the [oiii] 5007 planetary nebula luminosity function (pnlf)span nearly a decade in oxygen abundance, and thus, support the use of the pnlffor deriving distances to galaxies (jacoby 1996) with differing metallicities.we also identify a correlation between central star mass and pn dust formationthat partially alleviates any dependence of the pnlf maximum magnitude onpopulation age. additionally, we identify a spatially compact group of 5 pnehaving unusually high o/h; this subgroup may arise from a recent merger, butvelocity information is needed to assess the true nature of the objects.

astro-ph;9904043	a hubble space telescope survey for resolved companions of  planetary-nebula nuclei	we report results of an hst "snapshot" survey aimed at finding resolvedbinary companions of the central stars of galactic planetary nebulae (pne).using wf/pc and wfpc2, we searched the fields of 113 pne for stars whose closeproximity to the central star suggests a physical association. we find 10binary nuclei that are very likely to be physically associated, and another sixthat are possible binary associations. by correcting for interstellarextinction and placing the central stars' companions on the main sequence, wederive distances to the objects, and thereby significantly increase the numberof pne with reliable distances.  comparison of our derived distances with those obtained from variousstatistical methods shows that all of the latter have systematicallyoverestimated the distances, by factors ranging up to a factor of two or more.we show that this error is most likely due to the fact that the properties ofour pne with binary nuclei are systematically different from those of pne usedheretofore to calibrate statistical methods. specifically, our pne tend to havelower surface brightnesses at the same physical radius than the traditionalcalibration objects. this difference may arise from a selection effect: the pnein our survey are typically nearby, old nebulae, whereas most of the objectsthat calibrate statistical techniques are low-latitude,high-surface-brightness, and more distant nebulae. as a result, the statisticalmethods that seem to work well with samples of distant pne, e.g., those in thegalactic bulge or external galaxies, may not be applicable to the more diversepopulation of local pne.
