0706.1791	x-ray luminosity functions of normal galaxies in the goods	we present soft (0.5-2 kev) x-ray luminosity functions (xlfs) in the greatobservatories origins deep survey (goods) fields, derived for galaxies atz~0.25 and 0.75. sed fitting was used to estimate photometric redshifts andseparate galaxy types, resulting in a sample of 40 early-type galaxies and 46late-type galaxies. we estimate k-corrections for both the x-ray/optical andx-ray/nir flux ratios, which facilitates the separation of agn from thenormal/starburst galaxies. we fit the xlfs with a power-law model using bothtraditional and markov-chain monte carlo (mcmc) procedures. the xlfs differbetween z&lt;0.5 and z&gt;0.5, at &gt;99% significance levels for early-type, late-typeand all (early and late-type) galaxies.we also fit schechter and log-normalmodels to the xlfs, fitting the low and high redshift xlfs for a given samplesimultaneously assuming only pure luminosity evolution. in the case oflog-normal fits, the results of mcmc fitting of the local fir luminosityfunction were used as priors for the faint and bright-end slopes (similar to``fixing'' these parameters at the fir values except here the fir uncertaintyis included). the best-fit values of the change in log l* with redshift weredlogl* = 0.23 +/- 0.16 dex (for early-type galaxies) and 0.34 +/- 0.12 dex (forlate-type galaxies), corresponding to (1+z)^1.6 and (1+z)^2.3. these resultswere insensitive to whether the schechter or log-normal function was adopted.

0901.4627	photometric properties of ly alpha emitters at z=4.86 in the cosmos 2  square degree field	we present results of a survey for ly alpha emitters at z=4.86 based onoptical narrowband (lambda_c=7126 angstrom, delta lambda=73 angstrom) andbroadband (b, v, r', i', and z') observations of the cosmic evolution survey(cosmos) field using suprime-cam on the subaru telescope. we find 79 laecandidates at z=4.86 over a contiguous survey area of 1.83 deg^2, down to thely alpha line flux of 1.47 x 10^-17 ergs s^-1 cm^-2. we obtain the ly alphaluminosity function with a best-fit schechter parameters of logl^*=42.9^+0.5_-0.3 ergs s^-1 and phi^* = 1.2^+8.0_-1.1 x 10^-4 mpc^-3 foralpha=-1.5 (fixed). the two-point correlation function for our lae sample isxi(r) = (r/4.4^+5.7_-2.9 mpc)^-1.90+/-0.22. in order to investigate thefield-to-field variations of the properties of ly alpha emitters, we divide thesurvey area into nine tiles of 0.5^circ x 0.5^circ each. we find that thenumber density varies with a factor of ~ 2 from field to field with highstatistical significance. however, we find no significant field-to-fieldvariance when we divide the field into four tiles with 0.7^circ x 0.7^circeach. we conclude that at least 0.5 deg^2 survey area is required to deriveaveraged properties of laes at z~5, and our survey field is wide enough toovercome the cosmic variance.

0903.0102	galaxy stellar mass assembly between 0.2&lt;z&lt;2 from the s-cosmos survey	we follow the galaxy stellar mass assembly by morphological and spectral typein the cosmos 2-deg^2 field. we derive the stellar mass functions and stellarmass densities from z=2 to z=0.2 using 196,000 galaxies selected at f(3.6micron) &gt; 1 microjy with accurate photometric redshifts(sigma_((zp-zs)/(1+zs))=0.008 at i&lt;22.5). using a spectral classification, wefind that z~1 is an epoch of transition in the stellar mass assembly ofquiescent galaxies. their stellar mass density increases by 1.1 dex betweenz=1.5-2 and z=0.8-1 (delta t ~2.5 gyr), but only by 0.3 dex between z=0.8-1 andz~0.1 (delta t ~ 6 gyr). then, we add the morphological information and findthat 80-90% of the massive quiescent galaxies (log(m)~11) have an ellipticalmorphology at z&lt;0.8. therefore, a dominant mechanism links the shutdown of starformation and the acquisition of an elliptical morphology in massive galaxies.still, a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies present a spi/irrmorphology at low mass (40-60% at log(m)~9.5), but this fraction is smallerthan predicted by semi-analytical models using a ``halo quenching'' recipe. wealso analyze the evolution of star-forming galaxies and split them into``intermediate activity'' and ``high activity'' galaxies. we find that the mostmassive ``high activity'' galaxies end their high star formation rate phasefirst. finally, the space density of massive star-forming galaxies becomeslower than the space density of massive elliptical galaxies at z&lt;1. as aconsequence, the rate of ``wet mergers'' involved in the formation of the mostmassive ellipticals must decline very rapidly at z&lt;1, which could explain theobserved slow down in the assembly of these quiescent and massive sources.

(2006) to extend itto the brighter end (m_{1400}&gt;-22.2). we show that: (i) different assumptionsregarding the sed distribution of the lbg population, dust properties andintergalactic absorption result in a 25% variation in the number density oflbgs at z~5; (ii) under consistent assumptions for dust properties andintergalactic absorption, the hudf is about 30% under-dense in z~5 lbgsrelative to the nicp12 field, a variation which is well explained by cosmicvariance; (iii) the faint-end slope of the lf is independent of the specificassumptions for the input physical parameters, and has a value of alpha ~ -1.6,similar to the faint-end slope of the lf that has been measured for lbgs at z~3and z~6.

0905.0508	velocity dispersion measurements of dwarf galaxies in the coma cluster -  implications for the structure of the fundamental plane	we present intermediate-resolution spectroscopic data for a set of dwarf andgiant galaxies in the coma cluster, with -20.6 &lt; m_r &lt; -15.7. the photometricand kinematic properties of the brighter galaxies can be cast in terms ofparameters which present little scatter with respect to a set of scalingrelations known as the fundamental plane. to determine the form of thesefundamental scaling relations at lower luminosities, we have measured velocitydispersions for a sample comprising 69 galaxies on the border of the dwarf andgiant regime. combining these data with our photometric survey, we find a tightcorrelation of luminosity and velocity dispersion, l \propto \sigma^{2.0},substantially flatter than the faber-jackson relation characterising giantelliptical galaxies. in addition, the variation of mass-to-light ratio withvelocity dispersion is quite weak in our dwarf sample: m/l \propto\sigma^{0.2}. our overall results are consistent with theoretical modelsinvoking large-scale mass removal and subsequent structural readjustment, e.g.,as a result of galactic winds.

0906.1873	hst/acs morphology of lyman alpha emitters at redshift 5.7 in the cosmos  field	we present detailed morphological properties of lyman alpha emitters (laes)at z~ 5.7 in the cosmos field, based on {\it hubble space telescope} advancedcamera for surveys (acs) data. the acs imaging in the f814w filter covered 85laes of the 119 laes identified in the full two square degree field, and 47laes of them are detected in the acs images. nearly half of them are spatiallyextended with a size larger than 0.15 arcsec (~0.88 kpc at z=5.7) up to 0.4arcsec (~2.5 kpc at z=5.7). the others are nearly unresolved compact objects.two laes show double-component structures, indicating interaction or merging ofbuilding components to form more massive galaxies. by stacking the acs imagesof all the detected sources, we obtain a sersic parameter of n~0.7 with ahalf-light radius of 0.13 arcsec (0.76 kpc), suggesting that the majority ofacs detected laes have not spheroidal-like but disk-like or irregular lightprofiles. comparing acs f814w magnitudes (i_814) with subaru/suprime-cammagnitudes in the nb816, i', and z' bands, we find that the acs imaging in thef814w band mainly probes uv continuum rather than lyman alpha line emission. uvcontinuum sizes tend to be larger for laes with larger ly\alpha emissionregions as traced by the nb816 imaging. the non-detection of 38 laes in the acsimages is likely due to the fact that their surface brightness is even too lowboth in the uv continuum and lyalpha emission. estimating i_814 for the laeswith acs non-detection from the z' and nb816 magnitudes, we find that 16 ofthese are probably laes with a size larger than 0.15 arcsec in uv continuum.all these results suggest that our lae sample contains systematically largerlaes in uv continuum size than those previously studied at z~6.

0910.0444	spectroscopy of luminous z&gt;7 galaxy candidates and sources of  contamination in z&gt;7 galaxy searches	we present three bright z+ dropout candidates selected from deepnear-infrared (nir) imaging of the cosmos 2 square degree field. all threeobjects match the 0.8-8um colors of other published z&gt;7 candidates but arethree magnitudes brighter, facilitating further study. deep spectroscopy of twoof the candidates covering 0.64-1.02um with keck-deimos and all three covering0.94-1.10um and 1.52-1.80um with keck-nirspec detects weak spectral featurestentatively identified as ly-alpha at z=6.95 and z=7.69 in two of the objects.the third object is placed at z~1.6 based on a 24um and weak optical detection.a comparison with the spectral energy distributions of known z&lt;7 galaxies,including objects with strong spectral lines, large extinction, and largesystematic uncertainties in the photometry yields no objects with similarcolors. however, the lambda&gt;1um properties of all three objects can be matchedto optically detected sources with photometric redshifts at z~1.8, so thenon-detection in the i+ and z+ bands are the primary factors which favors a z&gt;7solution. if any of these objects are at z~7 the bright end of the luminosityfunction is significantly higher at z&gt;7 than suggested by previous studies, butconsistent within the statistical uncertainty and the dark matter halodistribution. if these objects are at low redshift, the lyman-break selectionmust be contaminated by a previously unknown population of low redshift objectswith very strong breaks in their broad band spectral energy distributions andblue nir colors. the implications of this result on luminosity functionevolution at high redshift is discussed. we show that the primary limitation ofz&gt;7 galaxy searches with broad filters is the depth of the available opticaldata.

0704.2545	the angular correlations of galaxies in the cosmos field	we present measurements of the two-point galaxy angular correlation functionw(\theta) in the cosmos field. independent determinations of w(\theta) as afunction of magnitude limit are presented for both the hst acs catalog and alsofor the ground-based data from subaru and the cfht. despite havingsignificantly different masks, these three determinations agree well. at brightmagnitudes (iab&lt;22), our data generally match very well with existingmeasurements and with mock catalogs based on semi-analytic galaxy formationcalculations of kitzbichler and white from the millennium simulation. theexception is that our result is at the upper end of the expected cosmicvariance scatter for \theta &gt; 10 arcmin, which we attribute to a particularlyrich structure known to exist at z~0.8. for fainter samples, however, the levelof clustering is somewhat higher than reported by some previous studies: in allthree catalogues we find w(\theta=1')~0.014 at a median iab magnitude of 24. atthese very faintest magnitudes, our measurements agree well with the latestdeterminations from the canada-france legacy survey. this level of clusteringis approximately double what is predicted by the semi-analytic catalogs (at allangles). the semi-analytic results allow an estimate of cosmic variance, whichis too small to account for the discrepancy. we therefore conclude that themean amplitude of clustering at this level is higher than previously estimated.

1107.2591	insights on the formation, evolution, and activity of massive galaxies  from ultra-compact and disky galaxies at z=2-3	we present our results on the structure and activity of massive galaxies atz=1-3 using one of the largest (166 with m_star&gt;=5e10 m_sun) and most diversesamples of massive galaxies derived from the goods-nicmos survey: (1) sersicfits to deep nic3/f160w images indicate that the rest-frame optical structuresof massive galaxies are very different at z=2-3 compared to z~0. approximately40% of massive galaxies are ultra-compact (r_e&lt;=2 kpc), compared to less than1% at z~0. furthermore, most (~65%) systems at z=2-3 have a low sersic indexn&lt;=2, compared to ~13% at z~0. we present evidence that the n&lt;=2 systems atz=2-3 likely contain prominent disks, unlike most massive z~0 systems. (2)there is a correlation between structure and star formation rates (sfr). themajority (~85%) of non-agn massive galaxies at z=2-3, with sfr high enough toyield a 5 sigma (30 micro jy) 24 micron spitzer detection have low n&lt;=2. suchn&lt;=2 systems host the highest sfr. (3) the frequency of agn is ~40% at z=2-3.most (~65%) agn hosts have disky (n&lt;=2) morphologies. ultra-compact galaxiesappear quiescent in terms of both agn activity and star formation. (4) largestellar surface densities imply massive galaxies at z=2-3 formed via rapid,highly dissipative events at z&gt;2. the large fraction of n&lt;=2 disky systemssuggests cold mode accretion complements gas-rich major mergers at z&gt;2. inorder for massive galaxies at z=2-3 to evolve into present-day massive e/s0s,they need to significantly increase (n, r_e). dry minor and major mergers mayplay an important role in this process.

1108.6061	dissecting photometric redshift for active galactic nuclei using xmm-  and chandra-cosmos samples	with this paper, we release accurate photometric redshifts for 1692counterparts to chandra sources in the central square degree of the cosmosfield. the availability of a large training set of spectroscopic redshifts thatextends to faint magnitudes enabled photometric redshifts comparable to thehighest quality results presently available for normal galaxies. we demonstratethat morphologically extended, faint x-ray sources without optical variabilityare more accurately described by a library of normal galaxies (corrected foremission lines) than by agn-dominated templates, even if these sources haveagn-like x-ray luminosities. preselecting the library on the bases of thesource properties allowed us to reach an accuracy sigma_(delta z/(1+z_spec))\sim0.015 with a fraction of outliers of 5.8% for the entire chandra-cosmossample. in addition, we release revised photometric redshifts for the 1735optical counterparts of the xmm-detected sources over the entire 2 sq. deg.ofcosmos. for 248 sources, our updated photometric redshift differs from theprevious release by delta z&gt;0.2. these changes are predominantly due to theinclusion of newly available deep h-band photometry h_ab=24 mag. we illustrateonce again the importance of a spectroscopic training sample and how anassumption about the nature of a source together with the number and the depthof the available bands influence the accuracy of the photometric redshiftsdetermined for agn. these considerations should be kept in mind when definingthe observational strategies of upcoming large surveys targeting agn, such aserosita at x-ray energies and askap/emu in the radio band.

1412.0532	the galaxy stellar mass function at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 in the candels/uds,  goods-south, and hudf fields	the galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) at high-z provides key information onstar-formation history and mass assembly in the young universe. we aimed to usethe unique combination of deep optical/nir/mir imaging provided by hst, spitzerand the vlt in the candels-uds, goods-south, and hudf fields to determine thegsmf over the redshift range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5. we utilised the hst wfc3/ir nir imagingfrom candels and hudf09, reaching h~27-28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin2,in combination with associated deep hst acs optical data, deep spitzer iracimaging from the seds programme, and deep y and k-band vlt hawk-i images fromthe hugs programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometricredshifts. these have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopicredshifts in the range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, resulting in an overall precision ofsigma_z/(1+z)~0.037. we have determined the low-mass end of the high-z gsmfwith unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as m*~10^9 msun atz=4 and ~6x10^9 msun at z=7. we find that the gsmf at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 depends onlyslightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely thephoto-z, the sfhs, the nebular contribution or the presence of agn on theparent sample. the low-mass end of the gsmf is steeper than has been found atlower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probedhere. our results are very different from previous gsmf estimates based onconverting uv galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight m/lrelations. integrating our evolving gsmf over mass, we find that the growth ofstellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the sfrdensity over cosmic time at z&gt;4. these results confirm the unique synergy ofthe candels+hudf, hugs, and seds surveys for the discovery and study ofmoderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.

1412.3806	zfourge/candels: on the evolution of m* galaxy progenitors from z=3 to  0.5	galaxies with stellar masses near m* contain the majority of stellar mass inthe universe, and are therefore of special interest in the study of galaxyevolution. the milky way (mw) and andromeda (m31) have present day stellarmasses near m*, at 5x10^10 msol (mw-mass) and 10^11 msol (m31-mass). we studythe typical progenitors of these galaxies using zfourge, a deep medium-bandnear-ir imaging survey, which is sensitive to the progenitors of these galaxiesout to z~3. we use abundance-matching techniques to identify the mainprogenitors of these galaxies at higher redshifts. we measure the evolution inthe stellar mass, rest-frame colors, morphologies, far-ir luminosities, andstar-formation rates combining our deep multiwavelength imaging with near-irhst imaging from candels, and far-ir imaging from goods-h and candels-h. thetypical mw-mass and m31-mass progenitors passed through the same evolutionstages, evolving from blue, star-forming disk galaxies at the earliest stages,to redder dust-obscured ir-luminous galaxies in intermediate stages, and tored, more quiescent galaxies at their latest stages. the progenitors of themw-mass galaxies reached each evolutionary stage at later times (lowerredshifts) and with stellar masses that are a factor of 2-3 lower than theprogenitors of the m31-mass galaxies. the process driving this evolution,including the suppression of star-formation in present-day m* galaxies requiresan evolving stellar-mass/halo-mass ratio and/or evolving halo-mass thresholdfor quiescent galaxies. the effective size and star-formation rates imply thatthe baryonic cold-gas fractions drop as galaxies evolve from high redshift toz~0 and are strongly anticorrelated with an increase in the s\'ersic index.therefore, the growth of galaxy bulges in m* galaxies corresponds to a rapiddecline in the galaxy gas fractions and/or a decrease in the star-formationefficiency.

1412.5180	stellar masses from the candels survey: the goods-south and uds fields	we present the public release of the stellar mass catalogs for the goods-sand uds fields obtained using some of the deepest near-ir images available,achieved as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacysurvey (candels) project. we combine the effort from ten different teams, whocomputed the stellar masses using the same photometry and the same redshifts.each team adopted their preferred fitting code, assumptions, priors, andparameter grid. the combination of results using the same underlying stellarisochrones reduces the systematics associated with the fitting code and otherchoices. thanks to the availability of different estimates, we can test theeffect of some specific parameters and assumptions on the stellar massestimate. the choice of the stellar isochrone library turns out to have thelargest effect on the galaxy stellar mass estimates, resulting in the largestdistributions around the median value (with a semi interquartile range largerthan 0.1 dex). on the other hand, for most galaxies, the stellar mass estimatesare relatively insensitive to the different parameterizations of the starformation history. the inclusion of nebular emission in the model spectra doesnot have a significant impact for the majority of galaxies (less than a factorof 2 for ~80% of the sample). nevertheless, the stellar mass for the subsampleof young galaxies (age &lt; 100 myr), especially in particular redshift ranges(e.g., 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.4, 3.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.6, and 5.5 &lt; z &lt; 6.5), can be seriouslyoverestimated (by up to a factor of 10 for &lt; 20 myr sources) if nebularcontribution is ignored.

0804.4874	the udf05 follow-up of the hudf: ii. constraints on reionization from  z-dropout galaxies	[abridged] we detect three (plus one less certain) z-dropout sources in twoseparate fields of our udf05 hst nicmos images. these z~7 lyman-break galaxy(lbg) candidates allow us to constrain the luminosity function (lf) of the starforming galaxy population at those epochs. by assuming a change in only m* andadopting a linear evolution in redshift, anchored to the measured values atz~6, the best fit evolution coefficient is found to be 0.43+-0.19 mag per unitredshift (0.36+-0.18, if including all four candidates), which provides a valueof m*(z=7.2)=-19.7+-0.3. this implies a steady evolution for the lbg lf out toz~7, at the same rate that is observed throughout the z~3 to 6 period. thisputs a strong constraint on the star-formation histories of z~6 galaxies, whoseensemble star-formation rate density must be lower by a factor 2 at ~170 myrbefore the epoch at which they are observed. in particular, a large fraction ofstars in the z~6 lbg population must form at redshifts well above z~7.extrapolating this steady evolution of the lf out to higher redshifts, weestimate that galaxies would be able to reionize the universe by z~6, providedthat the faint-end slope of the z&gt;7 lf steepens to alpha~-1.9, and that faintgalaxies, with luminosities below the current detection limits, contribute asubstantial fraction of the required ionizing photons. this scenario giveshowever an integrated optical depth to electron scattering that is ~2sigmabelow the wmap-5 measurement. therefore, altogether, our results indicate that,should galaxies be the primary contributors to reionization, either thecurrently detected evolution of the galaxy population slows down at z&gt;7, or thelf evolution must be compensated by a decrease in metallicity and acorresponding increase in ionization efficiency at these early epochs.

0705.2266	evolution of the frequency of luminous (\geq l_v*) close galaxy pairs at  z &lt; 1.2 in the cosmos field	we measure the fraction of luminous galaxies in pairs at projectedseparations of 5-20 kpc out to z=1.2 in the cosmos field using acs images andphotometric redshifts derived from an extensive multiwavelength dataset.analysis of a complete sample of 106,188 galaxies more luminous than m_v=-19.8(~ l_v*) in the redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.2 yields 1,749 galaxy pairs. thesedata are supplemented by a local z=0-0.1 value for the galaxy pair fractionderived from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). after statisticallycorrecting the cosmos pair sample for chance line-of-sight superpositions, theevolution in the pair fraction is fit by a power law \propto (1+z)^{n=3.1 \pm0.1}. if this strongly evolving pair fraction continues out to higher redshift,~ 50% of all luminous galaxies at z ~ 2 are in close pairs. this clearlysignifies that galaxy mergers are a very significant and possibly dominantmechanism for galaxy evolution during the epoch of galaxy formation at z=1 to3.

1512.00018	rest-uv absorption lines as metallicity estimator: the metal content of  star-forming galaxies at z~5	we measure a relation between the depth of four prominent rest-uv absorptioncomplexes and metallicity for local galaxies and verify it up to z~3. we thenapply this relation to a sample of 224 galaxies at 3.5 &lt; z &lt; 6.0 (&lt;z&gt; = 4.8) incosmos, for which unique uv spectra from deimos and accurate stellar massesfrom splash are available. the average galaxy population at z~5 and log(m/msun)&gt; 9 is characterized by 0.3-0.4 dex (in units of 12+log(o/h)) lowermetallicities than at z~2, but comparable to z~3.5. we find galaxies withweak/no ly-alpha emission to have metallicities comparable to z~2 galaxies andtherefore may represent an evolved sub-population of z~5 galaxies. we find acorrelation between metallicity and dust in good agreement with local galaxiesand an inverse trend between metallicity and star-formation rate (sfr)consistent with observations at z~2. the relation between stellar mass andmetallicity (mz relation) is similar to z~3.5, however, there are indicationsof it being slightly shallower, in particular for the young, ly-alpha emittinggalaxies. we show that, within a "bathtub" approach, a shallower mz relation isexpected in the case of a fast (exponential) build-up of stellar mass with ane-folding time of 100-200 myr. due to this fast evolution, the process of dustproduction and metal enrichment as a function of mass could be more stochasticin the first billion years of galaxy formation compared to later times.

0705.3681	uncovering the near-ir dwarf galaxy population of the coma cluster with  spitzer irac	we present the first results of a spitzer irac (infrared array camera)wide-field survey of the coma cluster. the observations cover two fields ofdifferent galaxy densities; the first is a 0.733 deg^2 region in the core ofthe cluster (coma 1), the second a 0.555 deg^2 off-center region located ~57arcmin (1.7 mpc) south-west from the core (coma 3). the observations, althoughshort 70-90 s exposures, are very sensitive; we detect ~29,200 sources at 3.6micron over the total ~1.3 deg^2 survey area. we construct 3.6 micron galaxyluminosity functions (lfs) for each field using selection functions based onspectroscopic redshifts. at the bright end, the lfs are well modeled by atraditional schechter function; [m^star (3.6 micron), alpha_1] = [-25.17,-1.18] and [-24.69, -1.30] for coma 1 and coma 3 respectively. however, at thefaint end (m(3.6 micron) &gt; -20.5), there is a steep increase in the lf slope inboth fields indicative of large numbers of red dwarf galaxies. the reality ofthis population is examined using optical counterparts in sdss data withoptical color filtering (g-r&lt;1.3). the steep increase can be modeled with apower-law function, with slopes of alpha_2 = -2.18 (coma 1) and alpha_2 = -2.60(coma 3). a qualitative comparison with optical (b- and r-band) lfs shows thatwe are likely to be observing a larger population of dwarf galaxies in thenear-ir, which may be a low-surface-brightness (lsb) population that irac isparticularly sensitive to, or a population too red to be detected in existingoptical surveys down to r~20.

astro-ph;0002493	the stellar content of brightest cluster galaxies	we present near-infrared k-band spectroscopy of 21 elliptical or cd brightestcluster galaxies (bcgs), for which we have measured the strength of the 2.293micron co stellar absorption feature. we find that the strength of this featureis remarkably uniform among these galaxies, with a smaller scatter inequivalent width than for the normal elliptical population in the field orclusters. the scatter for bcgs is 0.156 nm, compared with 0.240 nm for comacluster ellipticals, 0.337 nm for ellipticals from a variety of other clusters,and 0.422 nm for field ellipticals. we interpret this homogeneity as being dueto a greater age, or more uniform history, of star formation in bcgs than inother ellipticals; only a small fraction of the scatter can be due tometallicity variations, even in the bcgs. notwithstanding the small scatter,correlations are found between co strength and various galaxy properties,including r-band absolute magnitude, which could improve the precision of thesegalaxies as distance indicators in measurements of cosmological parameters andvelocity flows.

astro-ph;0107158	a photometric and spectroscopic study of dwarf and giant galaxies in the  coma cluster -- iii. spectral ages and metallicities	(abr.) we present the analysis of the spectroscopic catalog of galaxies inthe coma cluster from mobasher et al. this catalog comprises ~300 spectra ofcluster members with magnitudes m_b=-20.5 to -14 in two areas of ~1 x 1.5 mpctowards the center and the sw region of the cluster. in this paper the analysisis restricted to the 257 galaxies with no emission lines in their spectra. thestrength of the age-sensitive indices is found to correlate with galaxymagnitude over the whole magnitude range. similarly, the metallicity-sensitiveindices anticorrelate with magnitude. by comparing the observed indices withmodel grids based on the padova isochrones, we derive luminosity-weighted agesand metallicities. we present the distributions of ages and metallicities forgalaxies in various magnitude bins. the mean metallicity decreases with galaxymagnitude and, at a given luminosity, appears to be generally lower forgalaxies in the sw region of coma as compared to the center of the cluster. abroad range of ages, from younger than 3 gyr to older than 9 gyr, is found ingalaxies of any magnitude. however, systematic trends of age with luminosityare present among galaxies in the central field. in the central mpc of coma, alarge fraction of galaxies at any luminosity (50-60% of the giants, &gt;30 % ofthe dwarfs) show no evidence in their central regions of star formationoccurred at redshift z&lt;2, while the proportion of galaxies with significantstar formation occurring at intermediate (0.35&lt;z&lt;2) and low (z&lt;0.35) redshiftsis found to depend on galaxy luminosity. faint galaxies with youngluminosity-weighted ages appear to have a bimodal metallicity distributionthat, if confirmed, would point to a composite formation scenario. finally, wepresent an interpretation of the index-magnitude relations observed.

astro-ph;0307377	the phoenix deep survey: x-ray properties of faint radio sources	in this paper we use a 50ks xmm-newton pointing overlapping with the phoenixdeep survey, a homogeneous radio survey reaching mujy sensitivities, to explorethe x-ray properties and the evolution of star-forming galaxies. uv, opticaland nir photometry is available and is used to estimate photometric redshiftsand spectral types for radio sources brighter than r=21.5mag (total of 82).sources with r&lt;21.5mag and spiral galaxy seds (34) are grouped into tworedshift bins with a median of z=0.240 and 0.455 respectively. stackinganalysis for both the 0.5-2 and 2-8kev bands is performed on these subsamples.a high confidence level signal (&gt;3.5sigma) is detected in the 0.5-2kev bandcorresponding to a mean flux of ~3e-16cgs for both subsamples. this fluxtranslates to mean luminosities of ~5e40 and 1.5e41cgs for the z=0.240 and0.455 subsamples respectively. only a marginally significant signal (2.6sigma)is detected in the 2-8kev band for the z=0.455 subsample. we argue that thestacked signal above is dominated by star-formation. the mean l_x/l_b ratio andthe mean l_x of the two subsamples are found to be higher than opticallyselected spirals and similar to starbursts. we also find that the mean l_x andl_1.4 of the faint radio sources studied here are consistent with the l_x-l_1.4correlation of local star-forming galaxies. moreover, the x-ray emissivity ofsub-mjy sources to z~0.3 is found to be elevated compared to local hiigalaxies. the observed increase is consistent with l_x evolution of the form(1+z)^3. assuming that our sample is indeed dominated by starbursts this isdirect evidence for evolution of such systems at x-ray wavelengths. using anempirical l_x to sfr conversion we estimate a global sfr density at z~0.3 of\~0.029m_o/yr/mpc in agreement with previous studies.

astro-ph;0309449	a comparison of the galaxy populations in the coma and distant clusters:  the evolution of k+a galaxies and the role of the intracluster medium	the spectroscopic properties of galaxies in the coma cluster are comparedwith those of galaxies in rich clusters at $z \sim 0.5$, to investigate theevolution of the star formation history in clusters. luminous galaxies with$m_v \leq -20$ and post-starburst/post-starforming (k+a) spectra whichconstitute a significant fraction of galaxies in distant cluster samples areabsent in coma, where spectacular cases of k+a spectra are found instead at$m_v&gt;-18.5$ and represent a significant proportion of the cluster dwarf galaxypopulation. a simple inspection of their positions on the sky indicates thatthis type of galaxy does not show a preferential location within the cluster,but the bluest and strongest-lined group of k+a's lies in projection towardsthe central 1.4 mpc of coma and have radial velocities significantly higherthan the cluster mean. we find a striking correlation between the positions ofthese young and strong post-starburst galaxies and substructure in the hotintracluster medium (icm) identified from {\it xmm-newton} data, with thesegalaxies lying close to the edges of two infalling substructures. this resultstrongly suggests that the interaction with the dense icm could be responsiblefor the quenching of the star formation (thus creating the k+a spectrum), andpossibly, for any previous starburst. the evolution with redshift of theluminosity distribution of k+a galaxies can be explained by a ``downsizingeffect'', with the maximum luminosity/mass of actively star-forming galaxiesinfalling onto clusters decreasing at lower redshift. we discuss the possiblephysical origin of this downsizing effect and the implications of our resultsfor current scenarios of environmental effects on the star formation ingalaxies.

astro-ph;0408382	bar evolution over the last eight billion years: a constant fraction of  strong bars in gems	one third of present-day spirals host optically visible strong bars thatdrive their dynamical evolution. however, the fundamental question of how barsevolve over cosmological times has yet to be addressed, and even the frequencyof bars at intermediate redshifts remains controversial. we investigate thefrequency of bars out to z~1.0 drawing on a sample of 1590 galaxies from thegems survey, which provides morphologies from hst acs two-color images, andhighly accurate redshifts from the combo-17 survey. we identify spiral galaxiesusing the sersic index, concentration parameter, and rest-frame color. wecharacterize bars and disks by fitting ellipses to f606w and f850lp images,taking advantage of the two bands to minimize bandpass shifting. we excludehighly inclined (i&gt;60 deg) galaxies to ensure reliable morphologicalclassifications, and apply completeness cuts of m_v &lt;= -19.3 and -20.6. morethan 40% of the bars that we detect have semi major axes a&lt;0.5" and would beeasily missed in earlier surveys without the small psf of acs. the bars that wecan reliably detect are fairly strong (with ellipticities e&gt;=0.4) and have a inthe range ~1.2-13 kpc. we find that the optical fraction of such strong barsremains at ~(30% +- 6%) from the present-day out to look-back times of 2-6 gyr(z~0.2-0.7) and 6-8 gyr (z~0.7-1.0); it certainly shows no sign of a drasticdecline at z&gt;0.7. our findings of a large and similar bar fraction at thesethree epochs favor scenarios in which cold gravitationally unstable disks arealready in place by z~1, and where on average bars have a long lifetime (wellabove 2 gyr). the distributions of structural bar properties in the two slicesare, however, not statistically identical and therefore allow for thepossibility that the bar strengths and sizes may evolve over time.

astro-ph;0411572	the phoenix deep survey: the clustering and the environment of extremely  red objects	in this paper we explore the clustering properties and the environment of theextremely red objects (eros; i-k&gt;4mag) detected in a ~180arcmin^2 deep(ks~20mag) ks-band survey of a region within the phoenix deep survey, anon-going multiwavelength program aiming to investigate the nature and theevolution of faint radio sources. using our complete sample of 289 erosbrighter than ks=20mag we estimate a statistically significant (~3.7sigma)angular correlation function signal with amplitude aw=8.7^{+2.1}_{-1.7}x10^{-3}consistent with earlier work based on smaller samples. this amplitude suggestsa clustering length in the range ro=12-17h^{-1}mpc, implying that eros traceregions of enhanced density. using a novel method we further explore theassociation of eros with galaxy overdensities by smoothing the k-band galaxydistribution using the matched filter algorithm of postman et al. (1996) andthen cross-correlating the resulting density maps with the ero positions. ouranalysis provides direct evidence that eros are associated with overdensitiesat redshifts z&gt;1. we also exploit the deep radio 1.4ghz data (limiting flux60microjy) available to explore the association of eros and faint radio sourcesand whether the two populations trace similar large scale structures.cross-correlation of the two samples (after excluding 17eros with radiocounterparts) gives a 2sigma signal only for the sub-sample of high-z radiosources (z&gt;0.6). although the statistics are poor this suggests that it is thehigh-z radio sub-sample that traces similar structures with eros.

astro-ph;0411578	the phoenix deep survey: spectroscopic catalog	the phoenix deep survey is a multi-wavelength survey based on deep 1.4 ghzradio imaging, reaching well into the sub-100 microjy level. one of the aims ofthis survey is to characterize the sub-mjy radio population, exploring itsnature and evolution. in this paper we present the catalog and results of thespectroscopic observations aimed at characterizing the optically ``bright''(r&lt;~ 21.5 mag) counterparts of faint radio sources. out of 371 sources withredshift determination, 21% have absorption lines only, 11% show agnsignatures, 32% are star-forming galaxies, 34% show narrow emission lines thatdo not allow detailed spectral classification (due to poor signal-to-noiseratio and/or lack of diagnostic emission lines) and the remaining 2% areidentified with stars. for the star-forming galaxies with a balmer decrementmeasurement we find a median extinction of a(ha)=1.9 mag, higher than that ofoptically selected samples. this is a result of the radio selection, which isnot biased against dusty systems. using the available spectroscopicinformation, we estimate the radio luminosity function of star-forming galaxiesin two independent redshift bins at z~0.1 and 0.3 respectively. we find directevidence for strong luminosity evolution of these systems consistent with l(1.4ghz) ~ (1+z)^(2.7).

0809.0309	agn host galaxy morphologies in cosmos	we use hst/acs images and a photometric catalog of the cosmos field toanalyze morphologies of the host galaxies of approximately 400 agn candidatesat redshifts 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. we compare the agn hosts with a sample ofnon-active galaxies drawn from the cosmos field to match the magnitude andredshift distribution of the agn hosts. we perform 2-d surface brightnessmodeling with galfit to yield host galaxy and nuclear point source magnitudes.x-ray selected agn host galaxy morphologies span a substantial range that peaksbetween those of early-type, bulge-dominated and late-type, disk-dominatedsystems. we also measure the asymmetry and concentration of the host galaxies.unaccounted for, the nuclear point source can significantly bias results ofthese measured structural parameters, so we subtract the best-fit point sourcecomponent to obtain images of the underlying host galaxies. our concentrationmeasurements reinforce the findings of our 2-d morphology fits, placing x-rayagn hosts between early- and late-type inactive galaxies. agn host asymmetrydistributions are consistent with those of control galaxies. combined with alack of excess companion galaxies around agn, the asymmetry distributionsindicate that strong interactions are no more prevalent among agn than normalgalaxies. in light of recent work, these results suggest that the host galaxiesof agn at these x-ray luminosities may be in a transition from disk-dominatedto bulge-dominated, but that this transition is not typically triggered bymajor mergers.

astro-ph;0504127	evolution of field early-type galaxies: the view from goods/cdfs	(abridged) we explore the evolution of field early-type galaxies on a sampleextracted from goods/cdfs. the galaxies are selected by means of anon-parametric analysis followed by visual inspection. we exclude thosegalaxies which are not consistent with an evolution into the kormendy relation.the final set comprises 249 galaxies with a median redshift z=0.7. thedistribution of number counts versus apparent magnitude suggests a substantialdecrease of the comoving number density with redshift. the majority of thegalaxies feature passively evolving old stellar populations. one third of thosein the upper half of the redshift distribution have blue colors, in contrast toonly 10% in the lower redshift subsample. an adaptive binning of the color mapsis performed to explore the internal color distribution. we find that most bluegalaxies in our sample feature blue cores whereas most of the red early-typesare passively evolving stellar populations with red cores. the color gradientsand scatter do not evolve with redshift and are compatible with theobservations at z=0 assuming a radial dependence of the metallicity within eachgalaxy. this work emphasizes the need for a careful sample selection, as wefound that most of those galaxies which were visually classified as early types-- but then rejected based on the kormendy relation -- feature blue colorscharacteristic of recent star formation.

astro-ph;0509526	goods, udf, and the evolution of early-type galaxies	the hst/acs images of goods-south have been used to select a sample ofearly-type galaxies, based on morphology and on the kormendy relation. theclassification scheme does not use galaxy colours, hence it does not biasagainst young stellar populations. the 249 galaxies (i_ab&lt;24) paint a complexformation picture. their stellar populations show gradients which readily ruleout a large range of ages among and within galaxies. on the other hand, thereis a decrease in the comoving number density, which suggests a strong bias whencomparing local and distant early-type galaxies. this bias can be caused eitherby a significant fraction of non early-type progenitors or by a selectioneffect (e.g. dust-enshrouded progenitors). the deep images of the udf were usedto determine the structural properties of some of these galaxies. regarding thedistribution of disky/boxy isophotes, we do not find large differences withrespect to local systems. however, some early-types with the standard featuresof a red and dead galaxy reveal interesting residuals, possible signatures ofpast merging events.

astro-ph;0509551	morphology and evolution of emission line galaxies in the hubble ultra  deep field	we investigate the properties and evolution of a sample of galaxies selectedto have prominent emission lines in low-resolution grism spectra of the hubbleultra deep field (hudf). these objects, egrapes, are late type blue galaxies,characterized by small proper sizes (r_50 &lt; 2 kpc) in the 4350a rest-frame, lowmasses (5x10^9 m_sun), and a wide range of luminosities and surfacebrightnesses. the masses, sizes and volume densities of these objects appear tochange very little up to a redshift of z=1.5. on the other hand, their surfacebrightness decreases significantly from z=1.5 to z=0 while their mass-to-lightratio increases two-folds. this could be a sign that most of low redshiftegrapes have an older stellar population than high redshift egrapes and hencethat most egrapes formed at higher redshifts. the average volume density ofegrapes is (1.8 \pm 0.3)x10^{-3} mpc^{-3} between 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 1.5. many egrapeswould formally have been classified as luminous compact blue galaxies (lcbgs)if these had been selected based on small physical size, blue intrinsic color,and high surface brightness, while the remainder of the sample discussed inthis paper forms an extension of lcbgs towards fainter luminosities.

astro-ph;0511289	spitzer observations of massive red galaxies at high redshift	we investigate the properties of massive galaxies at z=1-3.5 using hstobservations, ground-based near-ir imaging, and spitzer space telescopeobservations at 3-24 micron. we identify 153 distant red galaxies (drgs) withj-k &gt; 2.3 mag (vega) in the southern goods field. this sample is approximatelycomplete in stellar mass for passively evolving galaxies above 10^11 solarmasses and z &lt; 3. the galaxies identified by this selection are roughly splitbetween objects whose optical and near-ir rest-frame light is dominated byevolved stars combined with ongoing star formation, and galaxies whose light isdominated by heavily reddened starbursts. very few of the galaxies (&lt; 10%) haveno indication of current star formation. using sfr estimates that include thereradiated ir emission, the drgs at z=1.5-3 with stellar masses &gt; 10^11 solarmasses have specific sfrs (sfrs per unit stellar mass) ranging from 0.2 to 10gyr^-1, with a mean value of ~2.4 gyr^-1. the drgs with stellar masses &gt; 10^11solar masses and 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3 have integrated specific sfrs greater the globalvalue over all galaxies. in contrast, we find that galaxies at z = 0.3-0.75with these stellar masses have integrated specific sfrs less than the globalvalue, and more than an order of magnitude lower than that for massive drgs atz = 1.5-3. at z &lt; 1, lower-mass galaxies dominate the overall cosmic massassembly. this suggests that the bulk of star formation in massive galaxiesoccurs at early cosmic epochs and is largely complete by z~1.5.

astro-ph;0512138	the phoenix deep survey: the star-formation rates and the stellar masses  of eros	we estimate the star-formation rates and the stellar masses of the extremelyred objects (eros) detected in a 180arcmin2 ks-band survey (ks~20mag). thissample is complemented by sensitive 1.4ghz radio observations (12micro-jy;1sigma rms) and multiwaveband photometric data (ubvrij) as part of the phoenixdeep survey. for bright k&lt;19.5mag eros in this sample (i-k&gt;4mag; total of 177)we use photometric methods to discriminate dust-enshrouded active systems fromearly-type galaxies and to constrain their redshifts. radio stacking is thenemployed to estimate mean radio flux densities of 8.6 (3sigma) and 6.4micro-jy(2.4sigma) for the dusty and early-type subsamples respectively. assuming thatdust enshrouded active eros are powered by star-formation the above radio fluxdensity at the median redshift of z=1 translates to a radio luminosity of4.5e22w/hz and a star-formation rate of sfr=25mo/yr. combining this result withphotometric redshift estimates we find a lower limit to the star-formation ratedensity of ~0.02mo/yr/mpc^3 for the k&lt;19.5mag dusty eros in the rangez=0.85-1.35. comparison with the sfr density estimated from previous erosamples (with similar selection criteria) using optical emission lines,suffering dust attenuation, suggests a mean dust reddening of at leaste(b-v)~0.5 for this population. we further use the ks-band luminosity as proxyto stellar mass and argue that the dust enshrouded eros in our sample aremassive systems, m&gt;5e10mo. we also find that eros represent a sizable fraction(~50%) of the number density of galaxies more massive than m=5e10mo at z~1,with almost equal contributions from dusty and early types. similarly, we findthat eros contribute about half of the mass density of the universe at z~1after taking into account incompleteness because of the limit k=19.5mag.

(2004),indicating that the x-ray emission per unit optical flux per galaxy issuppressed in clusters of galaxies, but extends this work to a specificoff-center environment in the coma cluster. finally, we report the discovery ofa region of diffuse x-ray flux which might correspond to a small groupinteracting with the coma intra-cluster medium (icm).

astro-ph;0601202	did galaxy assembly and supermassive black-hole growth go hand-in-hand?	in this paper, we address whether the growth of supermassive black-holes haskept pace with the process of galaxy assembly. for this purpose, we firstsearched the hubble ultra deep field (hudf) for "tadpole galaxies", which havea knot at one end and an extended tail. they appear dynamically unrelaxed --presumably early-stage mergers -- and make up ~6% of the field galaxypopulation. their redshift distribution follows that of field galaxies,indicating that -- if tadpole galaxies are indeed dynamically young -- theprocess of galaxy assembly generally kept up with the reservoir of fieldgalaxies as a function of epoch. next, we present a search for hudf objectswith point-source components that are optically variable (at the &gt;~3.0 sigmalevel) on timescales of weeks--months. among 4644 objects to i_ab=28.0 mag (10sigma), 45 have variable point-like components, which are likely weak agn.about 1% of all field objects show variability for 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 4.5, and theirredshift distribution is similar to that of field galaxies. hence supermassiveblack-hole growth in weak agn likely also kept up with the process of galaxyassembly. however, the faint agn sample has almost no overlap with the tadpolesample, which was predicted by recent hydrodynamical numerical simulations.this suggests that tadpole galaxies are early-stage mergers, which likelypreceded the ``turn-on'' of the agn component and the onset of visiblepoint-source variability by &gt;~1 gyr.

astro-ph;0602163	evidence for a supernova associated with the x-ray flash 020903	we present ground-based and hubble space telescope optical observations ofthe x-ray flash (xrf) 020903, covering 300 days. the afterglow showed a veryrapid rise in the first day, followed by a relatively slow decay in the nextfew days. there was a clear bump in the light curve after ~25 days, accompaniedby a drastic change in the spectral energy distribution. the light curve andthe spectral energy distribution are naturally interpreted as the emergence --and subsequent decay -- of a supernova (sn), similar to sn 1998bw. at peakluminosity, the sn is estimated to be 0.8 +/- 0.1 mag fainter than sn1998bw.this argues in favor of the existence of a supernova associated with this x-rayflash. a spectrum obtained 35 days after the burst shows emission lines fromthe host galaxy. we use this spectrum to put an upper limit on the oxygenabundance of the host at [o/h] &lt; -0.6 dex. we also discuss a possible trendbetween the softness of several bursts and the early behavior of the opticalafterglow, in the sense that xrfs and x-ray rich grbs seem to have a plateauphase or even a rising light curve. this can be naturally explained in modelswhere xrfs are similar to grbs but seen off the jet axis.

(2002) and yun et al. (2001) have shown that ingalaxies with radio luminosities greater than 1e23 w/hz the majority of theradio emission originates from a `monster' i.e., an agn. using the chandra2msec x-ray image centered on the goods-n field and a reprocessed vla hdfa-array data plus newly acquired vla b-array data (rms=5.3microjy), we findthat radio galaxies (with spectroscopic redshifts; all have z&gt;1) withl(1.4ghz)&gt;1e24 w/hz typically have an x-ray detection rate of 72% (60% emithard x-rays suggesting an agn origin for the radio emission) in contrast to 25%for radio galaxies with l &lt; 1e23 w/hz. the acs images of these l(1.4 ghz) &gt;1e24 w/hz galaxies typically show compact rather than extended galaxymorphology which is generally found for the less luminous radio emittinggalaxies but a few appear to be ongoing galaxy mergers. we also present sedfitting for these luminous radio galaxies including spitzer irac &amp; mips 24umphotometry and 60% show distinct power-law sed indicative of an agn. initialresults tell us that the x-ray emitting radio galaxy population are generallynot submm sources but the few (~10%) that are scuba sources appear to be thesmall agn population found by pope et al. and others.

astro-ph;0701482	the cosmic evolution survey (cosmos): a large-scale structure at z=0.73  and the relation of galaxy morphologies to local environment	we have identified a large-scale structure at z~0.73 in the cosmos field,coherently described by the distribution of galaxy photometric redshifts, anacs weak-lensing convergence map and the distribution of extended x-ray sourcesin a mosaic of xmm observations. the main peak seen in these maps correspondsto a rich cluster with tx= 3.51+0.60/-0.46 kev and lx=(1.56+/-0.04) x 10^{44}erg/s ([0.1-2.4] kev band). we estimate an x-ray mass within $r500$corresponding to m500~1.6 x 10^{14} msun and a total lensing mass (extrapolatedby fitting a nfw profile) m(nfw)=(6+/-3) x 10^15 msun. we use an automatedmorphological classification of all galaxies brighter than i_ab=24 over thestructure area to measure the fraction of early-type objects as a function oflocal projected density sigma_10, based on photometric redshifts derived fromground-based deep multi-band photometry. we recover a robust morphology-densityrelation at this redshift, indicating, for comparable local densities, asmaller fraction of early-type galaxies than today. interestingly, thisdifference is less strong at the highest densities and becomes more severe inintermediate environments. we also find, however, local "inversions'' of theobserved global relation, possibly driven by the large-scale environment. inparticular, we find direct correspondence of a large concentration of diskgalaxies to (the colder side of) a possible shock region detected in the x-raytemperature map and surface brightness distribution of the dominant cluster. weinterpret this as potential evidence of shock-induced star formation inexisting galaxy disks, during the ongoing merger between two sub-clusters.

astro-ph;0701746	the redshift evolution of early-type galaxies in cosmos: do massive  early-type galaxies form by dry mergers?	abridged: we study the evolution since z~1 of the rest-frame b luminosityfunction of the early-type galaxies (etgs) in ~0.7 deg^2 in the cosmos field.in order to identify all progenitors of local etgs we construct the sample ofhigh-z galaxies using two complementary criteria: (i) a morphological selectionbased on the zurich estimator of structural types, and (ii) a photometricselection based on the galaxy properties in the (u-v)-m_v color-magnitudediagram. we furthermore constrain both samples so as to ensure that theselected progenitors of etgs are compatible with evolving into systems whichobey the mu_b-r_{hl} kormendy relation. assuming the luminosity evolutionderived from studies of the fundamental plane for high-z etgs, our analysisshows no evidence for a decrease in the number density of the most massive etgsout to z~ 0.7: both the morphologically- and the photometrically-selectedsub-samples show no evolution in the number density of bright (~l&gt;2.5l*) etgs.allowing for different star formation histories, and cosmic variance, weestimate a maximum decrease in the number density of massive galaxies at thatredshift of ~30%. we observe, however, in both the photometrical andmorphological samples, a deficit of up to ~2-3 of fainter etgs over the samecosmic period. our results argue against a significant contribution of recentdissipationless ``dry'' mergers to the formation of the most massive etgs. wesuggest that the mass growth in low luminosity etgs can be explained with aconversion from z~0.7 to z=0 of blue, irregular and disk galaxies into low- andintermediate-mass ``red'' etgs, possibly also through gas rich mergers.

astro-ph;0702424	radio observations of the cdf-south: a possible link between radio  emission and star formation in x-ray selected agn	we explore the nature of the radio emission of x-ray selected agn bycombining deep radio (1.4ghz; 60micro-jy) and x-ray data with multiwavelength(optical, mid-infrared) observations in the extended chandra deep field south(e-cdfs). the fraction of radio detected x-ray sources increases from 9% in thee-cdfs to 14% in the central region of this field, which has deeper x-raycoverage from the 1ms cdfs. we find evidence that the radio emission of up to60% of the hard x-ray/radio matched agn is likely associated withstar-formation in the host galaxy. firstly, the mid-ir (24micron) properties ofthese sources are consistent with the infrared/radio correlation of starbursts.secondly, most of them are found in galaxies with blue rest-frame opticalcolours (u-v), suggesting a young stellar population. on the contrary,x-ray/radio matched agn which are not detected in the mid-infrared have red u-vcolours suggesting their radio emission is associated with agn activity. wealso find no evidence for a population of heavily obscured radio-selected agnthat are not detected in x-rays. finally, we do no confirm previous claims fora correlation between radio emission and x-ray obscuration. assuming that theradio continuum measures star-formation, this finding is against models wherethe dust and gas clouds associated with circumnuclear starbursts arespherically blocking our view to the central engine.

astro-ph;9801132	the near-infrared number counts and luminosity functions of local  galaxies	this study presents a wide-field near-infrared (k-band) survey in two fields;sa 68 and lynx 2. the survey covers an area of 0.6 deg.$^2$, complete tok=16.5. a total of 867 galaxies are detected in this survey of which 175 haveavailable redshifts. the near-infrared number counts to k=16.5 mag. areestimated from the complete photometric survey and are found to be in closeagreement with other available studies. the sample is corrected forincompleteness in redshift space, using selection function in the form of afermi-dirac distribution. this is then used to estimate the local near-infraredluminosity function of galaxies. a schechter fit to the infrared data gives:m$^\ast_k = -25.1 \pm 0.3$, $\alpha = -1.3\pm 0.2$ and $\phi^\ast =(1.5\pm0.5)\times 10^{-3}$ mpc$^{-3}$ (for h$_0=50$ km/sec/mpc and q$_0=0.5$). whenreduced to $\alpha=-1$, this agrees with other available estimates of the localirlf. we find a steeper slope for the faint-end of the infrared luminosityfunction when compared to previous studies. this is interpreted as due to thepresence of a population of faint but evolved (metal rich) galaxies in thelocal universe. however, it is not from the same population as the faint bluegalaxies found in the optical surveys. the characteristic magnitude($m^\ast_k$) of the local irlf indicates that the bright red galaxies ($m_k\sim-27$ mag.) have a space density of $\le 5\times 10^{-5}$ mpc$^{-3}$ and hence,are not likely to be local objects.

astro-ph;9805327	star formation rates in faint radio galaxies	the decimetric radio continuum luminosity of a star-forming galaxy appears tobe directly proportional to the rate of formation of supernovae in the galaxy.since decimetric radiation does not suffer significant extinction and is notdirective, radio luminosities may thus provide a particularly straightforwardway to determine the current rate of star formation. using a sample of over 700local galaxies we confirm the utility of the radio luminosity as a measure ofstar formation rate by showing concordance with the rates predicted by u-band,h-alpha, and far-infrared luminosites. we also show that there are systematicdiscrepancies between these various indicators, suggesting that the h-alphaluminosity may underestimate the star formation rate by approximately an orderof magnitude when the star formation rate is more than 20 solar mass per year.we use this calibration and the measured radio luminosities of sub-mjy radiosources to infer the star formation rate in approximately 60 star-forminggalaxies at moderate (z = 0.1) redshifts, both as the actual rate and as thefraction of the existing mass of stars in the galaxy. for some of these objectsthe inferred current rate of star formation could increase the stellar mass inthe galaxy by approximately 10% over an interval of about 30 myr.
