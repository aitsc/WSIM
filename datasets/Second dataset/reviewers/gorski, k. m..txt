0902.4759	non-gaussianity as a probe of the physics of the primordial universe and  the astrophysics of the low redshift universe	a new and powerful probe of the origin and evolution of structures in theuniverse has emerged and been actively developed over the last decade. in thecoming decade, non-gaussianity, i.e., the study of non-gaussian contributionsto the correlations of cosmological fluctuations, will become an importantprobe of both the early and the late universe. specifically, it will play aleading role in furthering our understanding of two fundamental aspects ofcosmology and astrophysics: (i) the physics of the very early universe thatcreated the primordial seeds for large-scale structures, and (ii) thesubsequent growth of structures via gravitational instability and gas physicsat later times. to date, observations of fluctuations in the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) and the large-scale structure of the universe (lss) havefocused largely on the gaussian contribution as measured by the two-pointcorrelations (or the power spectrum) of density fluctuations. however, an evengreater amount of information is contained in non-gaussianity and a largediscovery space therefore still remains to be explored. many observationalprobes can be used to measure non-gaussianity, including cmb, lss,gravitational lensing, lyman-alpha forest, 21-cm fluctuations, and theabundance of rare objects such as clusters of galaxies and high-redshiftgalaxies. not only does the study of non-gaussianity maximize the sciencereturn from a plethora of present and future cosmological experiments andobservations, but it also carries great potential for important discoveries inthe coming decade.

0903.1229	increasing evidence for hemispherical power asymmetry in the five-year  wmap data	(abridged)motivated by the recent results of hansen et al. (2008) concerninga noticeable hemispherical power asymmetry in the wmap data on small angularscales, we revisit the dipole modulated signal model introduced by gordon etal. (2005). this model assumes that the true cmb signal consists of a gaussianisotropic random field modulated by a dipole, and is characterized by anoverall modulation amplitude, a, and a preferred direction, p. previousanalyses of this model has been restricted to very low resolution due tocomputational cost. in this paper, we double the angular resolution, andcompute the full corresponding posterior distribution for the 5-year wmap data.the results from our analysis are the following: the best-fit modulationamplitude for l &lt;= 64 and the ilc data with the wmap kq85 sky cut is a=0.072+/- 0.022, non-zero at 3.3sigma, and the preferred direction points towardgalactic coordinates (l,b) = (224 degree, -22 degree) +/- 24 degree. thecorresponding results for l &lt;~ 40 from earlier analyses was a = 0.11 +/- 0.04and (l,b) = (225 degree,-27 degree). the statistical significance of a non-zeroamplitude thus increases from 2.8sigma to 3.3sigma when increasing l_max from40 to 64, and all results are consistent to within 1sigma. similarly, thebayesian log-evidence difference with respect to the isotropic model increasesfrom delta ln e = 1.8 to delta ln e = 2.6, ranking as "strong evidence" on thejeffreys' scale. the raw best-fit log-likelihood difference increases fromdelta ln l = 6.1 to delta ln l = 7.3. similar, and often slightly stronger,results are found for other data combinations. thus, we find that the evidencefor a dipole power distribution in the wmap data increases with l in the 5-yearwmap data set, in agreement with the reports of hansen et al. (2008).

0903.4311	bayesian component separation and cmb estimation for the 5-year wmap  temperature data	a well-tested and validated gibbs sampling code, that performs componentseparation and cmb power spectrum estimation, was applied to the {\it wmap}5-yr data. using a simple model consisting of cmb, noise, monopoles anddipoles, a ``per pixel'' low-frequency power-law (fitting for both amplitudeand spectral index), and a thermal dust template with fixed spectral index, wefound that the low-$\ell$ ($\ell &lt; 50$) cmb power spectrum is in good agreementwith the published {\it wmap}5 results. residual monopoles and dipoles werefound to be small ($\lesssim 3 \mu$k) or negligible in the 5-yr data. wecomprehensively tested the assumptions that were made about the foregrounds(e.g. dust spectral index, power-law spectral index prior, templates), andfound that the cmb power spectrum was insensitive to these choices. we confirmthe asymmetry of power between the north and south ecliptic hemispheres, whichappears to be robust against foreground modeling. the map of low frequencyspectral indices indicates a steeper spectrum on average ($\beta=-2.97\pm0.21$)relative to those found at low ($\sim$ghz) frequencies.

0903.4446	the hot and cold spots in five-year wmap data	we present an extensive frequentist analysis of the one-point statistics(number, mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis) and two-point correlationfunctions determined for the local extrema of the cosmic microwave backgroundtemperature field observed in five-years of wilkinson microwave anisotropyprobe (wmap) data. application of a hypothesis test on the one-point statisticsindicates a low-variance of hot and cold spots in all frequency bands of thewmap data. the consistency of the observations with gaussian simulations of thethe best-fitting cosmological model is rejected at the 95% c.l. outside thewmap kq75 mask and the northern hemispheres in the galactic and eclipticcoordinate frames. we demonstrate that it is unlikely that residual galacticforeground emission contributes to the observed non-gaussianities. however, theapplication of a high-pass filter that removes large angular scale power doesimprove the consistency with the best-fitting cosmological model. two-pointcorrelation functions of the local extrema are calculated for both thetemperature pair product (t-t) and spatial pair-counting (p-p). the t-tobservations demonstrate weak correlation on scales below 20 degree and liecompletely below the lower 3-sigma confidence region once various temperaturethresholds are applied to the extrema determined for the kq75 mask and northernsky partitions. the p-p correlation structure corresponds to the clusteringproperties of the temperature extrema, and provides evidence that it is thelarge angular-scale structures, and some unusual properties thereof, that areintimately connected to the properties of the hot and cold-spots observed inthe wmap five-year data.

0906.0175	residual noise covariance for planck low-resolution data analysis	aims: develop and validate tools to estimate residual noise covariance inplanck frequency maps. quantify signal error effects and compare differenttechniques to produce low-resolution maps.  methods: we derive analytical estimates of covariance of the residual noisecontained in low-resolution maps produced using a number of map-makingapproaches. we test these analytical predictions using monte carlo simulationsand their impact on angular power spectrum estimation. we use simulations toquantify the level of signal errors incurred in different resolutiondowngrading schemes considered in this work.  results: we find an excellent agreement between the optimal residual noisecovariance matrices and monte carlo noise maps. for destriping map-makers, theextent of agreement is dictated by the knee frequency of the correlated noisecomponent and the chosen baseline offset length. the significance of signalstriping is shown to be insignificant when properly dealt with. in mapresolution downgrading, we find that a carefully selected window function isrequired to reduce aliasing to the sub-percent level at multipoles, ell &gt;2nside, where nside is the healpix resolution parameter. we show thatsufficient characterization of the residual noise is unavoidable if one is todraw reliable contraints on large scale anisotropy.  conclusions: we have described how to compute the low-resolution maps, with acontrolled sky signal level, and a reliable estimate of covariance of theresidual noise. we have also presented a method to smooth the residual noisecovariance matrices to describe the noise correlations in smoothed, bandwidthlimited maps.

0910.3445	frequentist comparison of cmb local extrema statistics in the five-year  wmap data with two anisotropic cosmological models	we present local extrema studies of two models that introduce a preferreddirection into the observed cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperaturefield. in particular, we make a frequentist comparison of the one- andtwo-point statistics for the dipole modulation and acw models with data fromthe five-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap). this analysis ismotivated by previously revealed anomalies in the wmap data, and particularlythe difference in the statistical nature of the temperature anisotropies whenanalysed in hemispherical partitions.  the analysis of the one-point statistics indicates that the previouslydetermined hemispherical variance difficulties can be apparently overcome by adipole modulation field, but new inconsistencies arise if the mean and thel-dependence of the statistics are considered. the two-point correlationfunctions of the local extrema, the temperature pair product and thepoint-point spatial pair-count, demonstrate that the impact of such amodulation is to over-`asymmetrise' the temperature field on smaller scalesthan the wave-length of the dipole or quadrupole, and this is disfavored by theobserved data.the results from the acw model predictions, however, areconsistent with the standard isotropic hypothesis. the two-point analysisconfirms that the impact of this type of violation of isotropy on thetemperature extrema statistics is relatively weak.  from this work, we conclude that a model with more spatial structure than thedipole modulated or rotational-invariance breaking models are required to fullyexplain the observed large-scale anomalies in the wmap data.

1007.3468	measuring planck beams with planets	accurate measurement of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropyrequires precise knowledge of the instrument beam. we explore how well theplanck beams will be determined from observations of planets, developingtechniques that are also appropriate for other experiments. we simulate planetobservations with a planck-like scanning strategy, telescope beams, noise, anddetector properties. then we employ both parametric and non-parametrictechniques, reconstructing beams directly from the time-ordered data. with afaithful parameterization of the beam shape, we can constrain certain detectorproperties, such as the time constants of the detectors, to high precision.alternatively, we decompose the beam using an orthogonal basis. for bothtechniques, we characterize the errors in the beam reconstruction with montecarlo realizations. for a simplified scanning strategy, we study the impact onestimation of the cmb power spectrum. finally, we explore the consequences formeasuring cosmological parameters, focusing on the spectral index of primordialscalar perturbations, n_s. the quality of the power spectrum measurement willbe significantly influenced by the optical modeling of the telescope. in ourmost conservative case, using no information about the optics except themeasurement of planets, we find that a single transit of jupiter across thefocal plane will measure the beam window functions to better than 0.3% for thechannels at 100-217 ghz that are the most sensitive to the cmb. constrainingthe beam with optical modeling can lead to much higher quality reconstruction.depending on the optical modeling, the beam errors may be a significantcontribution to the measurement systematics for n_s.

1012.2985	scale-dependent non-gaussianities in the wmap data as identified by  using surrogates and scaling indices	we present a model-independent investigation of the wmap data with respect toscale- dependent non-gaussianities (ngs) by employing the method of constrainedrandomization. for generating so-called surrogate maps a shuffling scheme isapplied to the fourier phases of the original data, which allows to test forthe presence of higher order correlations (hocs) on well-defined scales. usingscaling indices as test statistics we find highly significant signatures fornon-gaussianities when considering all scales. we test for ngs in the bands l =[2,20], l = [20,60], l = [60,120] and l = [120,300]. we find highly significantsignatures for non-gaussianities and ecliptic hemispherical asymmetries for l =[2, 20]. we also obtain highly significant deviations from gaussianity for theband l = [120,300]. the result for the full l-range can be interpreted as asuperposition of the signatures found in the bands l = [2, 20] and l = [120,300]. we find remarkably similar results when analyzing different ilc-likemaps. we perform a set of tests to investigate if the detected anomalies can beexplained by systematics. while no test can convincingly rule out the intrinsicnature of the anomalies for the low l case, the ilc map making procedure and/orresidual noise in the maps can also lead to ngs at small scales. ourinvestigations prove that there are phase correlations in the wmap data of thecmb. in the absence of an explanation in terms of galactic foregrounds or knownsystematic artefacts, the signatures at low l must so far be taken to becosmological at high significance. these findings strongly disagree withpredictions of isotropic cosmologies with single field slow roll inflation. thetask is now to elucidate the origin of the phase correlations and to understandthe physical processes leading to these scale-dependent non-gaussianities - ifsystematics as cause for them must be ruled out.

0709.1037	the joint large-scale foreground-cmb posteriors of the 3-year wmap data	using a gibbs sampling algorithm for joint cmb estimation and componentseparation, we compute the large-scale cmb and foreground posteriors of the3-yr wmap temperature data. our parametric data model includes the cosmologicalcmb signal and instrumental noise, a single power law foreground component withfree amplitude and spectral index for each pixel, a thermal dust template witha single free overall amplitude, and free monopoles and dipoles at eachfrequency. this simple model yields a surprisingly good fit to the data overthe full frequency range from 23 to 94 ghz. we obtain a new estimate of the cmbsky signal and power spectrum, and a new foreground model, including ameasurement of the effective spectral index over the high-latitude sky. aparticularly significant result is the detection of a common spurious offset inall frequency bands of ~ -13muk, as well as a dipole in the v-band data.correcting for these is essential when determining the effective spectral indexof the foregrounds. we find that our new foreground model is in good agreementwith template-based model presented by the wmap team, but not with their memreconstruction. we believe the latter may be at least partially compromised bythe residual offsets and dipoles in the data. fortunately, the cmb powerspectrum is not significantly affected by these issues, as our new spectrum isin excellent agreement with that published by the wmap team. the correspondingcosmological parameters are also virtually unchanged.

1101.2023	planck early results. ii. the thermal performance of planck	the performance of the planck instruments in space is enabled by their lowoperating temperatures, 20k for lfi and 0.1k for hfi, achieved through acombination of passive radiative cooling and three active mechanical coolers.the scientific requirement for very broad frequency coverage led to twodetector technologies with widely different temperature and cooling needs.active coolers could satisfy these needs; a helium cryostat, as used byprevious cryogenic space missions (iras, cobe, iso, spitzer, akari), could not.radiative cooling is provided by three v-groove radiators and a large telescopebaffle. the active coolers are a hydrogen sorption cooler (&lt;20k), a 4hejoule-thomson cooler (4.7k), and a 3he-4he dilution cooler (1.4k and 0.1k). theflight system was at ambient temperature at launch and cooled in space tooperating conditions. the hfi bolometer plate reached 93mk on 3 july 2009, 50days after launch. the solar panel always faces the sun, shadowing the rest ofplanck, andoperates at a mean temperature of 384k. at the other end of thespacecraft, the telescope baffle operates at 42.3k and the telescope primarymirror operates at 35.9k. the temperatures of key parts of the instruments arestabilized by both active and passive methods. temperature fluctuations aredriven by changes in the distance from the sun, sorption cooler cycling andfluctuations in gas-liquid flow, and fluctuations in cosmic ray flux on thedilution and bolometer plates. these fluctuations do not compromise the sciencedata.

1101.2032	planck early results. xxi. properties of the interstellar medium in the  galactic plane	(abridged) planck has observed the entire sky from 30 ghz to 857ghz. theobserved foreground emission contains contributions from different phases ofthe interstellar medium (ism). we have separated the observed galactic emissioninto the different gaseous components (atomic, molecular and ionised) in eachof a number of galactocentric rings. templates are created for variousgalactocentric radii using velocity information from atomic (neutral hydrogen)and molecular (12co) observations. the ionised template is assumed to be tracedby free-free emission as observed by wmap, while 408 mhz emission is used totrace the synchrotron component. gas emission not traced by the abovetemplates, namely "ark gas", as evidenced using planck data, is included as anadditional template, the first time such a component has been used in this way.these templates are then correlated with each of the planck frequency bands, aswell as other ancillary data. the emission per column density of the gastemplates allows us to create distinct spectral energy distributions (seds) pergalactocentric ring and in each of the gaseous tracers from 1.4 ghz to 25 thz(12\mu m). apart from the thermal dust and free-free emission, we have probedthe galaxy for anomalous (e.g., spinning) dust as well as synchrotron emission.we show that anomalous dust emission is present in the atomic, molecular anddark gas phases throughout the galactic disk. the derived dust propetiesassociated with the dark gas phase are derived but do not allow us to revealthe nature of this phase. for all environments, the anomalous emission isconsistent with rotation from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and,according to our simple model, accounts for $(25\pm5)%$ (statistical) of thetotal emission at 30 ghz.

1101.2036	planck early results xxiv: dust in the diffuse interstellar medium and  the galactic halo	this paper presents the first results of comparison of planck along with irasdata with green bank telescope 21-cm observations in 14 fields covering morethan 800 square degrees at high galactic latitude. galactic dust emission forfields with average hi column density lower than 2 x 10^20 cm^-2 is wellcorrelated with 21-cm emission. the residual emission in these fields, once thehi-correlated emission is removed, is consistent with the expected statisticalproperties of the cosmic infrared background fluctuations. fields with largercolumn densities show significant excess dust emission compared to the hicolumn density. regions of excess lie in organized structures that suggest thepresence of hydrogen in molecular form, though they are not always correlatedwith co emission. dust emission from intermediate-velocity clouds is detectedwith high significance. its spectral properties are consistent with, comparedto the local ism values, significantly hotter dust (t~20 k), lowersub-millimeter dust opacity, and a relative abundance of very small grains tolarge grains about four times higher. these results are compatible withexpectations for clouds that are part of the galactic fountain in which thereis dust shattering and fragmentation. correlated dust emission in hvcs is notdetected; the average of the 99.9% confidence upper limits to the emissivity is0.15 times the local ism value at 857 and 3000 ghz, in accordance with gasphase evidence for lower metallicity and depletion in these clouds. unexpectedanti-correlated variations of the dust temperature and emission cross-sectionper h atom are identified in the local ism and ivcs, a trend that continuesinto molecular environments. this suggests that dust growth throughaggregation, seen in molecular clouds, is active much earlier in the cloudcondensation and star formation processes.

1101.2039	planck early results: first assessment of the high frequency instrument  in-flight performance	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) is designed to measure thetemperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave backgroundand galactic foregrounds in six wide bands centered at 100, 143, 217, 353, 545and 857 ghz at an angular resolution of 10' (100 ghz), 7' (143 ghz), and 5'(217 ghz and higher). hfi has been operating flawlessly since launch on 14 may2009. the bolometers cooled to 100 mk as planned. the settings of the readoutelectronics, such as the bolometer bias current, that optimize hfi's noiseperformance on orbit are nearly the same as the ones chosen during groundtesting. observations of mars, jupiter, and saturn verified both the opticalsystem and the time response of the detection chains. the optical beams areclose to predictions from physical optics modeling. the time response of thedetection chains is close to pre-launch measurements. the detectors suffer froman unexpected high flux of cosmic rays related to low solar activity. due tothe redundancy of planck's observations strategy, the removal of a few percentof data contaminated by glitches does not affect significantly the sensitivity.the cosmic rays heat up significantly the bolometer plate and the modulation onperiods of days to months of the heat load creates a common drift of allbolometer signals which do not affect the scientific capabilities. only thehigh energy cosmic rays showers induce inhomogeneous heating which is aprobable source of low frequency noise.

0710.1873	the scalar perturbation spectral index n_s: wmap sensitivity to  unresolved point sources	precision measurement of the scalar perturbation spectral index, n_s, fromthe wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe temperature angular power spectrumrequires the subtraction of unresolved point source power. here we reconsiderthis issue. first, we note a peculiarity in the wmap temperature likelihood'sresponse to the source correction: cosmological parameters do not respond toincreased source errors. an alternative and more direct method for treatingthis error term acts more sensibly, and also shifts n_s by ~0.3 sigma closer tounity. second, we re-examine the source fit used to correct the power spectrum.this fit depends strongly on the galactic cut and the weighting of the map,indicating that either the source population or masking procedure is notisotropic. jackknife tests appear inconsistent, causing us to assign largeuncertainties to account for possible systematics. third, we note that the wmapteam's spectrum was computed with two different weighting schemes: uniformweights transition to inverse noise variance weights at l = 500. the fitdepends on such weighting schemes, so different corrections apply to eachmultipole range. for the kp2 mask used in cosmological analysis, we prefersource corrections a = 0.012 +/- 0.005 muk^2 for uniform weighting and a =0.015 +/- 0.005 muk^2 for n_obs weighting. correcting wmap's spectrumcorrespondingly, we compute cosmological parameters with our alternativelikelihood, finding n_s = 0.970 +/- 0.017 and sigma_8 = 0.778 +/- 0.045 . thisn_s is only 1.8 sigma from unity, compared to the ~2.6 sigma wmap 3-yearresult. finally, an anomalous feature in the source spectrum at l&lt;200 remains,most strongly associated with w-band.

1207.4061	planck intermediate results. v. pressure profiles of galaxy clusters  from the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	taking advantage of the all-sky coverage and broad frequency range of theplanck satellite, we study the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) and pressure profiles of62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-monthnominal survey. careful reconstruction of the sz signal indicates that mostclusters are individually detected at least out to r500. by stacking the radialprofiles, we have statistically detected the radial sz signal out to 3 x r500,i.e., at a density contrast of about 50-100, though the dispersion about themean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range.our measurement is fully consistent with previous planck results on integratedsz fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between sz and x-raymeasurements inside r500. correcting for the effects of the planck beam, wehave calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. this new constraint fromsz measurements is consistent with the x-ray constraints from xmm-newton in theregion in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1-1]r500), and is in fairly goodagreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. atlarger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than mostpredictions from numerical simulations. combining the sz and x-ray observedprofiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fitparameters [p0, c500, gamma, alpha, beta] = [6.41, 1.81, 0.31, 1.33, 4.13].using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirtswe reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profileout to 3 x r500. within the temperature driven uncertainties, our planckconstraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gasfraction in halos.

1303.4004	constraints on the topology of the universe derived from the 7-year wmap  cmb data and prospects of constraining the topology using cmb polarisation  maps	we impose constraints on the topology of the universe determined from asearch for matched circles in the cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperatureanisotropy patterns of the 7-year wmap data. we pay special attention to thesensitivity of the method to residual foreground contamination of the sky maps.a search for pairs of matched back-to-back circles in the higher resolutionwmap w-band map allows tighter constraints to be imposed on topology. ourresults rule out universes with topologies that predict pairs of such circleswith radii larger than approximately 10 degrees. this places a lower bound onthe size of the fundamental domain for a flat universe of about 27.9 gpc. westudy also the possibility for constraining the topology of the universe bymeans of the matched circles statistic applied to polarised cmb anisotropymaps. the advantages of using the cmb polarisation maps in studies of thetopology over simply analysing the temperature data as has been done to-dateare clearly demonstrated. it is found that the noise levels of both planck andnext generation cmb experiments data are no longer prohibitive and should below enough to enable the use of the polarisation maps for such studies.

1411.7616	monopole and dipole estimation for multi-frequency sky maps by linear  regression	we describe a simple but efficient method for deriving a consistent set ofmonopole and dipole corrections for multi-frequency sky map data sets, allowingrobust parametric component separation with the same data set. thecomputational core of this method is linear regression between pairs offrequency maps, often called "t-t plots". individual contributions frommonopole and dipole terms are determined by performing the regression locallyin patches on the sky, while the degeneracy between different frequencies islifted when ever the dominant foreground component exhibits a significantspatial spectral index variation. based on this method, we present twodifferent, but each internally consistent, sets of monopole and dipolecoefficients for the 9-year wmap, planck 2013, sfd 100 um, haslam 408 mhz andreich &amp; reich 1420 mhz maps. the two sets have been derived with differentanalysis assumptions and data selection, and provides an estimate of residualsystematic uncertainties. in general, our values are in good agreement withpreviously published results. among the most notable results are a relativedipole between the wmap and planck experiments of 10-15 uk (depending onfrequency), an estimate of the 408 mhz map monopole of 8.9 +- 1.3 k, and anon-zero dipole in the 1420 mhz map of $0.15 +- 0.03 k pointing towardsgalactic coordinates (l,b) = (308,-36) +- 14 degrees. these values representthe sum of any instrumental and data processing offsets, as well as anygalactic or extra-galactic component that is spectrally uniform over the fullsky.

1502.02114	planck 2015 results. xx. constraints on inflation	we present the implications for cosmic inflation of the planck measurementsof the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropies in both temperature andpolarization based on the full planck survey. the planck full missiontemperature data and a first release of polarization data on large angularscales measure the spectral index of curvature perturbations to be$n_\mathrm{s} = 0.968 \pm 0.006$ and tightly constrain its scale dependence to$d n_s/d \ln k =-0.003 \pm 0.007$ when combined with the planck lensinglikelihood. when the high-$\ell$ polarization data is included, the results areconsistent and uncertainties are reduced. the upper bound on thetensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.002} &lt; 0.11$ (95% cl), consistent with theb-mode polarization constraint $r&lt; 0.12$ (95% cl) obtained from a jointbicep2/keck array and planck analysis. these results imply that $v(\phi)\propto \phi^2$ and natural inflation are now disfavoured compared to modelspredicting a smaller tensor-to-scalar ratio, such as $r^2$ inflation. threeindependent methods reconstructing the primordial power spectrum areinvestigated. the planck data are consistent with adiabatic primordialperturbations. we investigate inflationary models producing an anisotropicmodulation of the primordial curvature power spectrum as well as generalizedmodels of inflation not governed by a scalar field with a canonical kineticterm. the 2015 results are consistent with the 2013 analysis based on thenominal mission data.

0806.3167	making maps from planck lfi 30ghz data with asymmetric beams and cooler  noise	the planck satellite will observe the full sky at nine frequencies from 30 to857 ghz. the goal of this paper is to examine the effects of four realisticinstrument systematics in the 30 ghz frequency maps: non-axially-symmetricbeams, sample integration, sorption cooler noise, and pointing errors. wesimulated one year long observations of four 30 ghz detectors. the simulatedtimestreams contained cmb, foreground components (both galactic andextra-galactic), instrument noise (correlated and white), and the fourinstrument systematic effects. we made maps from the timelines and examined themagnitudes of the systematics effects in the maps and their angular powerspectra. we also compared the maps of different mapmaking codes to see how theyperformed. we used five mapmaking codes (two destripers and three optimalcodes). none of our mapmaking codes makes an attempt to deconvolve the beamfrom its output map. therefore all our maps had similar smoothing due to beamsand sample integration. temperature to polarization cross-coupling due to beammismatch causes a detectable bias in the te spectrum of the cmb map. theeffects of cooler noise and pointing errors did not appear to be major concernsfor the 30 ghz channel. the only essential difference found so far betweenmapmaking codes that affects accuracy (in terms of residual rms) is baselinelength. all optimal codes give essentially indistinguishable results. adestriper gives the same result as the optimal codes when the baseline is setshort enough. for longer baselines destripers require less computing resourcesbut deliver a noisier map.

0705.3643	bayesian analysis of the low-resolution polarized 3-year wmap sky maps	we apply a previously developed gibbs sampling framework to the foregroundcorrected 3-yr wmap polarization data and compute the power spectrum andresidual foreground template amplitude posterior distributions. we firstanalyze the co-added q- and v-band data, and compare our results to thelikelihood code published by the wmap team. we find good agreement, and thusverify the numerics and data processing steps of both approaches. however, wealso analyze the q- and v-bands separately, allowing for non-zero ebcross-correlations and including two individual foreground template amplitudestracing synchrotron and dust emission. in these analyses, we find tentativeevidence of systematics: the foreground tracers correlate with each of the q-and v-band sky maps individually, although not with the co-added qv map; thereis a noticeable negative eb cross-correlation at l &lt;~ 16 in the v-band map; andfinally, when relaxing the constraints on eb and bb, noticeable differences areobserved between the marginalized band powers in the q- and v-bands. furtherstudies of these features are imperative, given the importance of the low-l eespectrum on the optical depth of reionization tau and the spectral index ofscalar perturbations n_s.

astro-ph;0108178	resolving gravitational microlensing events with long-baseline optical  interferometry. prospects for the eso very large telescope interferometer	until now, the detailed interpretation of the observed microlensing eventshas suffered from the fact that the physical parameters of the phenomenoncannot be uniquely determined from the available astronomical measurements,i.e. the photometric lightcurves. the situation will change in the near-futurewith the availability of long-baseline, sensitive optical interferometers,which should be able to resolve the images of the lensed objects into theircomponents. for this, it will be necessary to achieve a milliarcsecondresolution on sources with typical magnitudes k $\ga 12$. indeed, brighterevents have never been observed up to now by micro-lensing surveys. we discussthe possibilities opened by the use of long baseline interferometry in general,and in particular for one such facility, the eso vlt interferometer, which willattain the required performance. we discuss the expected accuracy and limitingmagnitude of such measurements. on the basis of the database of the eventsdetected by the ogle experiment, we estimate the number of microlenses thatcould be available for measurements by the vlti. we find that at least severaltens of events could be observed each year. in conjunction with the photometricdata, our ability to measure the angular separation between the microlensedimages will enable a direct and unambiguous determination of both their massesand locations.

astro-ph;0108362	all-sky astrophysical component separation with fast independent  component analysis (fastica)	we present a new, fast, algorithm for the separation of astrophysicalcomponents superposed in maps of the sky, based on the fast independentcomponent analysis technique (fastica). it allows to recover both the spatialpattern and the frequency scalings of the emissions from statisticallyindependent astrophysical processes, present along the line-of-sight, frommulti-frequency observations. we apply fastica to simulated observations of themicrowave sky with angular resolution and instrumental noise at the meannominal levels for the planck satellite, containing the most important knowndiffuse signals: the cosmic microwave background (cmb), galactic synchrotron,dust and free-free emissions. a method for calibrating the reconstructed mapsof each component at each frequency has been devised. the spatial pattern ofall the components have been recovered on all scales probed by the instrument.in particular, the cmb angular power spectra is recovered at the percent levelup to $\ell_{max}\simeq 2000$. frequency scalings and normalization have beenrecovered with better than percent precision for all the components atfrequencies and in sky regions where their signal-to-noise ratio exceeds 1.5;the error increases at ten percent level for signal-to-noise ratios about 1.runs have been performed on a pentium iii 600 mhz computer; fastica typicallytook a time of the order of 10 minutes for all-sky simulations with 3.5arcminutes pixel size. we conclude that fastica is an extremly promisingtechnique for analyzing the maps that will be obtained by the forthcoming highresolution cmb experiments.

astro-ph;0202271	removing 1/f noise stripes in cosmic microwave background anisotropy  observations	removal of systematic effects is crucial in present and future cmbexperiments mapping large fraction of the sky. accurate cmb measurements askfor multi-feed array instruments observing the sky with a redundant scanningstrategy covering the same region of the sky on different time scales and withdifferent detectors for a better control of systematic effects. we investigatehere the capability to suppress 1/f noise features in time ordered data (tod)by using the destriping technique described in maino et al. (1999), underrealistic assumptions for crossing condition between different scan circles andsky signal fluctuations on small angular scales. we consider as working case,planck-lfi simulated observations with few arminutes pixel size convolved withlfi beam resolutions. we also extend the analysis to high values of theknee-frequency and found a residual additional noise rms ~31% larger than thepure white noise rms at fk=1 hz which could be a critical issue in theextraction of the cmb angular power spectrum. furthermore we verified thatdestriping quality does not significantly depend on the receiver sensitivitywhereas it improves proportionally to the improvement of sampling rate.therefore given a noise level, the higher the sampling rate, the better thedestriping quality.

astro-ph;0202520	towards a model of full-sky galactic synchrotron intensity and linear  polarisation: a re-analysis of the parkes data	we have analysed the angular power spectra of the parkes radio continuum andpolarisation survey of the southern galactic plane at 2.4 ghz. we have foundthat in the multipole range l=40-250 the angular power spectrum of thepolarised intensity is well described by a power-law spectrum with fittedspectral index alpha_l = 2.37 +- 0.21. in the same multipole range the angularpower spectra of the e and b components of the polarised signal aresignificantly flatter, with fitted spectral indices respectively of alpha_e =1.57 +- 0.12 and alpha_b = 1.45 +- 0.12. temperature fluctuations in the e andb components are mostly determined by variations in polarisation angle. we havecombined these results with other data from available radio surveys in order toproduce a full-sky toy model of galactic synchrotron intensity and linearpolarisation at high frequencies (&gt; 10 ghz). this can be used to study thefeasibility of measuring the cosmic microwave background polarisation withforthcoming experiments and satellite missions.

astro-ph;0205155	topology of the universe from cobe-dmr; a wavelet approach	in this paper we pursue a new technique to search for evidence of a finiteuniverse, making use of a spherical mexican-hat wavelet decomposition of themicrowave background fluctuations. using the information provided by thewavelet coefficients at several scales we test whether compact orientable flattopologies are consistent with the cobe-dmr data. we consider topological sizesranging from half to twice the horizon size. a scale-scale correlation testindicates that non-trivial topologies with appropriate topological sizes are asconsistent with the cobe-dmr data as an infinite universe. among the finitemodels the data seems to prefer a universe which is about the size of thehorizon for all but the hypertorus and the triple-twist torus. for the latterthe wavelet technique does not seem a good discriminator of scales for therange of topological sizes considered here, while a hypertorus has a preferredsize which is 80% of the horizon. this analysis allows us to find a best fittopological size for each model, although cosmic variance might limit ourability to distinguish some of the topologies.

astro-ph;0302091	foreground separation using a flexible maximum-entropy algorithm: an  application to cobe data	a flexible maximum-entropy component separation algorithm is presented thataccommodates anisotropic noise, incomplete sky-coverage and uncertainties inthe spectral parameters of foregrounds. the capabilities of the method aredetermined by first applying it to simulated spherical microwave data setsemulating the cobe-dmr, cobe-dirbe and haslam surveys. using these simulationswe find that is very difficult to determine unambiguously the spectralparameters of the galactic components for this data set due to their high levelof noise. nevertheless, we show that is possible to find a robust cmbreconstruction, especially at the high galactic latitude. the method is thenapplied to these real data sets to obtain reconstructions of the cmb componentand galactic foreground emission over the whole sky. the best reconstructionsare found for values of the spectral parameters: t_d=19 k, alpha_d=2,beta_ff=-0.19 and beta_syn=-0.8. the cmb map has been recovered with anestimated statistical error of \sim 22 muk on an angular scale of 7 degreesoutside the galactic cut whereas the low galactic latitude region presentscontamination from the foreground emissions.

astro-ph;0302181	reappraising foreground contamination in the cobe-dmr data	with the advent of all-sky h-alpha surveys it is possible to determine areliable free-free template of the diffuse interstellar medium (dickinson,davies &amp; davis 2003) which can be used in conjunction with the synchrotron anddust templates to correct cmb observations for diffuse galactic foregrounds. wehave used the cobe-dmr data at 31.5, 53 and 90 ghz and employed cross-correlation techniques to re-evaluate the foreground contributions,particularly that due to dust which is known to be correlated with h-alpha (andfree-free) emission.the dmr microwave maps are found to contain, as well as theexpected synchrotron and free-free components, a component tightly correlatedto the 140 micron dust maps of dirbe. at 31.5, 53 and 90 ghz this emission is6.3 +/- 0.6, 2.4 +/- 0.4 and 2.2 +/- 0.4 microk/(mjy/sr) at 140 micronsrespectively. when corrected for the contribution from thermal dust followingmodel 7 of finkbeiner, davis &amp; schlegel (1999), a strong anomalous dustemission component remains, which is well-fitted by a frequency spectrum of theform $\nu^{-\beta}$ where beta ~ 2.5 in the dmr frequency range; this is thedominant foreground at 31.5 ghz. the result implies the presence of an emissioncomponent with a dust-like morphology but a synchrotron-like spectrum. wediscuss the possible origins of this component and compare it with the recentwmap interpretation. the better knowledge of the individual foregroundsprovided by the present study enables a larger area of the sky (|b|&gt;15) to beused to re-appraise the cmb quadrupole normalisation, qrms-ps, and the scalarperturbations spectral index, n. we find qrms-ps=15.2^{+2.8}_{-2.3} with apower-law spectral index of n=1.2 +/- 0.2. these values are consistent withprevious cobe-dmr analyses and the wmap 1-year analysis.

astro-ph;0303657	astrophysical components separation of cobe-dmr 4yr data with fastica	we present an application of the fast independent component analysis methodto the cobe-dmr 4yr data. although the signal-to-noise ratio in the cobe-dmrdata is typically $\sim 1$, the approach is able to extract the cmb signal withhigh confidence when working at high galactic latitudes. the reconstructed cmbmap shows the expected frequency scaling of the cmb. we fit the resulting cmbcomponent for the rms quadrupole normalisation qrms and primordial spectralindex n and find results in excellent agreement with those derived from theminimum-noise combination of the 90 and 53 ghz dmr channels without galacticemission correction. including additional channels (priors) such as the haslammap of radio emission at 408 mhz and the dirbe 140um map of galactic infra-redemission, the fastica algorithm is able to both detect galactic foregroundemission and separate it from the dominant cmb signal. fitting the resultingcmb component for qrms and n we find good agreement with the results fromgorski et al.(1996) in which the galactic emission has been taken into accountby subtracting that part of the dmr signal observed to be correlated with thesegalactic template maps. we further investigate the ability of fastica toevaluate the extent of foreground contamination in the cobe-dmr data. weinclude an all-sky halpha survey (dickinson, davies &amp; davis 2003) to determinea reliable free-free template. in particular we find that, after subtraction ofthe thermal dust emission predicted by the finkbeiner, davis &amp; schlegel (1999)model 7, this component is the dominant foreground emission at 31.5 ghz. thisindicates the presence of an anomalous dust correlated component which is wellfitted by a power law spectral shape $\nu^{-\beta}$ with $\beta \sim 2.5$ inagreement with banday et al.

astro-ph;0307507	asymmetries in the cmb anisotropy field	we report on the results from two independent but complementary statisticalanalyses of the wmap first-year data, based on the power spectrum and n-pointcorrelation functions. we focus on large and intermediate scales (larger thanabout 3 degrees) and compare the observed data against monte carlo ensembleswith wmap-like properties. in both analyses, we measure the amplitudes of thelarge-scale fluctuations on opposing hemispheres and study the ratio of the twoamplitudes. the power-spectrum analysis shows that this ratio for wmap, asmeasured along the axis of maximum asymmetry, is high at the 95%-99% level(depending on the particular multipole range included). the axis of maximumasymmetry of the wmap data is weakly dependent on the multipole range underconsideration but tends to lie close to the ecliptic axis. in the n-pointcorrelation function analysis we focus on the northern and southern hemispheresdefined in ecliptic coordinates, and we find that the ratio of the large-scalefluctuation amplitudes is high at the 98%-99% level. furthermore, the resultsare stable with respect to choice of galactic cut and also with respect tofrequency band. a similar asymmetry is found in the cobe-dmr map, and the axisof maximum asymmetry is close to the one found in the wmap data.

astro-ph;0403098	on foreground removal from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data  by an internal linear combination method: limitations and implications	we study the internal linear combination (ilc) method presented by thewilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) science team, with the goal ofdetermining whether it may be used for cosmological purposes, as atemplate-free alternative to existing foreground correction methods. weconclude that the method does have the potential to do just that, but greatcare must be taken both in implementation, and in a detailed understanding oflimitations caused by residual foregrounds which can still affect cosmologicalresults. as a first step we demonstrate how to compute the ilc weights bothaccurately and efficiently by means of lagrange multipliers, and apply thismethod to the observed data to produce a new version of the ilc map. next wedescribe how to generate monte carlo simulations of the ilc map, and find thatthese agree well with the observed map on angular scales up to l~200. finallywe make two comments to the on-going debates concerning the large-scaleproperties of the wmap data. first, we note that the galactic south-easternquadrant is associated with notably different ilc weights than the other threequadrants, possibly indicating a foreground related anisotropy. second, westudy the properties of the quadrupole and octopole (amplitude, alignment andplanarity), and confirm the previously reported anomalies. even moreinterestingly, we find that the l=5 mode is spherically symmetric at about 3sigma, and that the l=6 mode is planar at the 2 sigma level. however, we alsoassess the impact of residual foregrounds on these statistics, and find thatthe ilc map is not clean enough to allow for cosmological conclusions.alternative methods must be developed to study these issues further.

astro-ph;0404206	testing the cosmological principle of isotropy: local power spectrum  estimates of the wmap data	we apply the gabor transform methodology proposed in (hansen et al. 2002,2003) to the wmap data in order to test the statistical properties of the cmbfluctuation field and specifically to evaluate the fundamental assumption ofcosmological isotropy. we estimate the angular power spectrum locally in discsof various sizes positioned in different directions. we determine whether thespatial position of a few outliers in the angular power spectrum could suggestthe presence of residual foregrounds or systematic effects. for multipolesclose to the first peak, the most deviant local estimates from the best fitwmap model are associated with a few particular areas close to the galacticplane. such deviations also include the ``dent'' in the spectrum just shortwardof the first peak which was remarked upon by the wmap team. estimating theangular power spectrum excluding these areas gives a slightly higher firstdoppler peak amplitude. finally, we probe the isotropy of the largest angularscales by estimating the power spectrum on hemispheres and reconfirm strongindications of a north-south asymmetry previously reported by other authors. wefind tentative evidence for residual foregrounds in the range l=2-4, whichcould be associated with the low measured quadrupole amplitudes and otheranomalies on these angular scales. however, over the range l=5-40 the observedasymmetry is much harder to explain in terms of residual foregrounds and knownsystematic effects. such asymmetric distributions of power on the sky provide aserious test for the cosmological principle of isotropy.

astro-ph;0405007	low-order multipole maps of cmb anisotropy derived from wmap	recent analyses of the wmap data have suggested that the low-order multipolesof the cmb anisotropy distribution show cosmologically interesting andunexpected morphologies and amplitudes. in this paper, we apply a powerequalization (pe) filter to the high-latitude wmap data in order to reconstructthese low-l multipoles free from the largest galactic foreground modellinguncertainties in the galactic plane. the characteristic spatial distributionsof the modes of order l=2,3,4,5 have been determined as a function offrequency, sky coverage and two methods for foreground correction: using thetemplate fitting results of bennett et al. (2003) and by a simple linearprojection scheme assuming the spectral dependence of the foregroundcomponents. our analyses suggest that the k and ka frequency bands remainsignificantly contaminated by residual foreground emission for the wmap kp2mask. however, the l=3,4,5 multipole maps for the q, v and w channels indicatethat, after foreground cleaning, these multipoles are dominated by the cmbanisotropy component. we confirm the tegmark et al. (2003) result that theoctopole does indeed show structure in which its hot and cold spots are centredon a single plane in the sky, and show further that this is very stable withrespect to the applied mask and foreground correction. the estimated quadrupoleis much less stable showing non-negligible dependence on the galacticforeground correction. including these uncertainties is likely to weaken thestatistical significance of the claimed alignment between the quadrupole andoctopole. nevertheless, these anisotropy patterns are also present for incobe-dmr data, and are unlikely to be associated with instrumental systematicartifacts.

astro-ph;0406232	cosmological parameters and the wmap data revisited	several recent papers have made claims about the detection of an asymmetricdistribution of large scale power in the cosmic microwave background anisotropyas measured by the wmap satellite. in this paper, we investigate how theestimates of particular cosmological parameters vary when inferred from powerspectra computed separately on the northern and southern hemispheres in threeframes of reference. we focus our investigation on the three specificparameters to which the analysis is most sensitive, the spectral index n, theamplitude of fluctuations a and the optical depth tau. when using a gaussianprior on the spectral index n centred at n=1 with a flat prior on the opticaldepth tau, the preferred value for the optical depth (derived in the referenceframe of maximum asymmetry) in the north is tau=0 with upper limit tau&lt;0.08,whereas in the south we find tau=0.24 +0.06/-0.07 (68% confidence level). thelatter result is inconsistent with tau=0 at the 2 sigma level. the estimatedoptical depth of tau=0.17 on the (nearly) full sky found by the wmapcollaboration and confirmed independently here, could thus in large partoriginate in structure associated with the southern hemisphere. furthermore,putting a prior on tau, we find values of the spectral index which areinconsistent between the opposite hemispheres. the exact values depend on theprior on tau. while our results should not be considered more than suggestive,the significance of the parameter differences in the two hemispheres beingtypically of order 2 sigma, if they are confirmed with the higher sensitivitywmap 2-year data then it may be necessary to question the assumption ofcosmological isotropy and the conceptual framework within which studies of thecmb anisotropy are made.

astro-ph;0411737	cosmological parameter constraints as derived from the wilkinson  microwave anisotropy probe data via gibbs sampling and the blackwell-rao  estimator	we study the blackwell-rao (br) estimator of the probability distribution ofthe angular power spectrum, p(c_l|d), by applying it to samples of full-skyno-noise cmb maps generated via gibbs sampling. we find the estimator, given aset of samples, to be very fast and also highly accurate, as determined bytests with simulated data. we also find that the number of samples required forconvergence of the br estimate rises rapidly with increasing l, at least at lowl. our existing sample chains are only long enough to achieve convergence at lless than about 40. in comparison with p(c_l|d) as reported by the wmap team wefind significant differences at these low l values. these differences lead toup to approximately 0.5 sigma shifts in the estimates of parameters in a7-parameter lambda cdm model with non-zero dn_s/dln(k). fixing dn_s/dln(k)= 0makes these shifts much less significant.  unlike existing analytic approximations, the br estimator can bestraightforwardly extended for the case of power spectra from correlatedfields, such as temperature and polarization. we discuss challenges toextending the procedure to higher l and provide some solutions.

astro-ph;0507186	multipole vector anomalies in the first-year wmap data: a cut-sky  analysis	we apply the recently defined multipole vector framework to thefrequency-specific first-year wmap sky maps, estimating the low-l multipolecoefficients from the high-latitude sky by means of a power equalizationfilter. while most previous analyses of this type have considered only heavilyprocessed (and foreground-contaminated) full-sky maps, the present approachallows for greater control of residual foregrounds, and therefore potentiallyalso for cosmologically important conclusions. the low-l spherical harmonicscoefficients and corresponding multipole vectors are tabulated for easyreference.  using this formalism, we re-assess a set of earlier claims of bothcosmological and non-cosmological low-l correlations based on multipolevectors. first, we show that the apparent l=3 and 8 correlation claimed by copiet al. (2004) is present only in the heavily processed map produced by tegmarket al. (2003), and must therefore be considered an artifact of that map.second, the well-known quadrupole-octopole correlation is confirmed at the 99%significance level, and shown to be robust with respect to frequency and skycut. previous claims are thus supported by our analysis. finally, the low-lalignment with respect to the ecliptic claimed by schwarz et al. (2004) isnominally confirmed in this analysis, but also shown to be very dependent onsevere a-posteriori choices. indeed, we show that given the peculiarquadrupole-octopole arrangement, finding such a strong alignment with theecliptic is not unusual.

astro-ph;0508268	cmb component separation by parameter estimation	we propose a solution to the cmb component separation problem based onstandard parameter estimation techniques. we assume a parametric spectral modelfor each signal component, and fit the corresponding parameters pixel by pixelin a two-stage process. first we fit for the full parameter set (e.g.,component amplitudes and spectral indices) in low-resolution and highsignal-to-noise ratio maps using mcmc, obtaining both best-fit values for eachparameter, and the associated uncertainty. the goodness-of-fit is evaluated bya chi^2 statistic. then we fix all non-linear parameters at theirlow-resolution best-fit values, and solve analytically for high-resolutioncomponent amplitude maps. this likelihood approach has many advantages: thefitted model may be chosen freely, and the method is therefore completelygeneral; all assumptions are transparent; no restrictions on spatial variationsof foreground properties are imposed; the results may be rigorously monitoredby goodness-of-fit tests; and, most importantly, we obtain reliable errorestimates on all estimated quantities. we apply the method to simulated planckand six-year wmap data based on realistic models, and show that separation atthe muk level is indeed possible in these cases. we also outline how theforeground uncertainties may be rigorously propagated through to the cmb powerspectrum and cosmological parameters using a gibbs sampling technique.

astro-ph;0511384	a determination of the spectra of galactic components observed by wmap	wmap data when combined with ancillary data on free-free, synchrotron anddust allow an improved understanding of the spectrum of emission from each ofthese components. here we examine the sky variation at intermediate latitudesusing a cross-correlation technique. in particular, we compare the observedemission in 15 selected sky regions to three ``standard'' templates.  the free-free emission of the diffuse ionised gas is fitted by a well-knownspectrum at k and ka band, but the derived emissivity corresponds to a meanelectron temperature of ~4000-5000k. this is inconsistent with estimates fromgalactic hii regions. the origin of the discrepancy is unclear.  the anomalous emission associated with dust is clearly detected in most ofthe 15 fields studied; it correlates well with the finkbeiner et al. model 8predictions (fds8) at 94 ghz, with an effective spectral index between 20 and60ghz of -2.85. furthermore, the emissivity varies by a factor of ~2 from cloudto cloud. a modestly improved fit to the anomalous dust at k-band is providedby modulating the template by an estimate of the dust colour temperature,specifically fds8*t^n. we find a preferred value n~1.6.  the synchrotron emission steepens between ghz frequencies and the wmap bands.there are indications of spectral index variations across the sky but thecurrent data are not precise enough to accurately quantify this from region toregion. our analysis of the wmap data indicates strongly that thedust-correlated emission at the low wmap frequencies has a spectrum which iscompatible with spinning dust; we find no evidence for a synchrotron componentcorrelated with dust (abridged).

astro-ph;0602023	no higher criticism of the bianchi corrected wmap data	motivated by the success of the bianchi vii_h model in addressing many of theanomalies observed in the wmap data (jaffe et al.), we present calculations inreal and in wavelet space of the higher criticism statistic of the bianchicorrected wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) first year data. at thewavelet scale of 5 degrees the higher criticism of the wmap map drops from avalue above the 99% c.l. to a value below the 68% c.l. when corrected by thebianchi template. an important property of the higher criticism statistic isits ability to locate the pixels that account for the deviation fromgaussianity. the analysis of the uncorrected wmap data pointed to a cold spotin the southern hemisphere centered at (l,b)~ (209, -57). the higher criticismof the bianchi corrected map indicates that this spot remains prominent, albeitat a level completely consistent with gaussian statistics. consequently, it isdebatable how much emphasis should be placed on this residual feature, but weconsider the effect of modestly increasing the scaling of the template. afactor of only 1.2 renders the spot indistinguishable from the backgroundlevel, with no noticeable impact on the results published in jaffe et al. forthe low-l anomalies, large-scale power asymmetry or wavelet kurtosis. a trivialinterpretation would be that the bianchi template may require a smallenhancement of power on scales corresponding to the wavelet scale of 5 degrees.

astro-ph;0603308	foreground subtraction of cosmic microwave background maps using wi-fit  (wavelet based high resolution fitting of internal templates)	we present a new approach to foreground removal for cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) maps. rather than relying on prior knowledge about theforeground components, we first extract the necessary information about themdirectly from the microwave sky maps by taking differences of temperature mapsat different frequencies. these difference maps, which we refer to as internaltemplates, consist only of linear combinations of galactic foregrounds andnoise, with no cmb component. we obtain the foreground cleaned maps by fittingthese internal templates to, and subsequently subtracting the appropriatelyscaled contributions of them from, the cmb dominated channels. the fittingoperation is performed in wavelet space, making the analysis feasible at highresolution with only a minor loss of precision. applying this procedure to thewmap data, we obtain a power spectrum that matches the spectrum obtained by thewmap team at the signal dominated scales. finally, we have revisited previousclaims about a north-south power asymmetry on large angular scales, and confirmthat these remain unchanged with this completely different approach toforeground separation. this also holds when fitting the foreground contributionindependently to the northern and southern hemisphere indicating that theasymmetry is unlikely to have its origin in different foreground properties ofthe hemispheres. this conclusion is further strengthened by the lack of anyobserved frequency dependence.

astro-ph;0606088	a re-analysis of the three-year wmap temperature power spectrum and  likelihood	we analyze the three-year wmap temperature anisotropy data seeking to confirmthe power spectrum and likelihoods published by the wmap team. we apply fiveindependent implementations of four algorithms to the power spectrum estimationand two implementations to the parameter estimation. our single most importantresult is that we broadly confirm the wmap power spectrum and analysis. still,we do find two small but potentially important discrepancies: on large angularscales there is a small power excess in the wmap spectrum (5-10% at l&lt;~30)primarily due to likelihood approximation issues between 13 &lt;= l &lt;~30. on smallangular scales there is a systematic difference between the v- and w-bandspectra (few percent at l&gt;~300). recently, the latter discrepancy was explainedby huffenberger et al. (2006) in terms of over-subtraction of unresolved pointsources. as far as the low-l bias is concerned, most parameters are affected bya few tenths of a sigma. the most important effect is seen in n_s. for thecombination of wmap, acbar and boomerang, the significance of n_s =/ 1 dropsfrom ~2.7 sigma to ~2.3 sigma when correcting for this bias. we propose a fewsimple improvements to the low-l wmap likelihood code, and introduce twoimportant extensions to the gibbs sampling method that allows for propersampling of the low signal-to-noise regime. finally, we make the products fromthe gibbs sampling analysis publically available, thereby providing a fast andsimple route to the exact likelihood without the need of expensive matrixinversions.

astro-ph;0701089	hemispherical power asymmetry in the three-year wilkinson microwave  anisotropy probe sky maps	we consider the issue of hemispherical power asymmetry in the three-year wmapdata, adopting a previously introduced modulation framework. computing bothfrequentist probabilities and bayesian evidences, we find that the modelconsisiting of an isotropic cmb sky modulated by a dipole field, gives asubstantially better fit to the observations than the purely isotropic model,even when accounting for the larger prior volume. for the ilc map, the bayesianlog-evidence difference is ~1.8 in favour of the modulated model, and the rawimprovement in maximum log-likelihood is 6.1. the best-fit modulation dipoleaxis points toward (l,b) = (225 deg,-27 deg), and the modulation amplitude is0.114, in excellent agreement with the results from the first-year analyses.the frequentist probability of obtaining such a high modulation amplitude in anisotropic universe is ~1%. these results are not sensitive to data set or skycut. thus, the statistical evidence for a power asymmetry anomaly is bothsubstantial and robust, although not decisive, for the currently availabledata. increased sky coverage through better foreground handling and full-skyand high-sensitivity polarization maps may shed further light on this issue.

astro-ph;0702483	making maps from planck lfi 30ghz data	this paper is one of a series describing the performance and accuracy ofmap-making codes as assessed by the planck ctp working group. we compare theperformance of multiple codes written by different groups for making polarizedmaps from planck-sized, all-sky cosmic microwave background (cmb) data. threeof the codes are based on destriping algorithm, whereas the other three areimplementations of a maximum-likelihood algorithm. previous papers in theseries described simulations at 100 ghz (poutanen et al. 2006) and 217 ghz(ashdown et al. 2006). in this paper we make maps (temperature andpolarisation) from the simulated one-year observations of four 30 ghz detectorsof planck low frequency instrument (lfi). we used planck level s simulationpipeline to produce the observed time-ordered-data streams (tod). our previousstudies considered polarisation observations for the cmb only. for this paperwe increased the realism of the simulations and included polarized galacticforegrounds to our sky model. our simulated tods comprised of dipole, cmb,diffuse galactic emissions, extragalactic radio sources, and detector noise.the strong subpixel signal gradients arising from the foreground signals coupleto the output map through the map-making and cause an error (signal error) inthe maps. destriping codes have smaller signal error than themaximum-likelihood codes. we examined a number of schemes to reduce this error.on the other hand, the maximum-likelihood map-making codes can produce mapswith lower residual noise than destriping codes.

astro-ph;9408097	on the rms anisotropy at 7 degrees and 10 degrees observed in the  cobe-dmr two year sky maps	the frequency-independent rms temperature fluctuations determined from thecobe-dmr two year sky maps are used to infer the parameter q_{rms-ps}, whichcharacterizes the normalization of power law models of primordial cosmologicaltemperature anisotropy. in particular, a 'cross'-rms statistic is used todetermine q_{rms-ps} for a forced fit to a scale-invariant harrison-zel'dovich(n = 1) spectral model. using a joint analysis of the 7 degree and 10 degreerms temperature derived from both the 53 and 90 ghz sky maps, we findq_{rms-ps} = 17.0^{+2.5}_{-2.1} uk when the low quadrupole is included, andq_{rms-ps} = 19.4^{+2.3}_{-2.1} uk excluding the quadrupole. these results areconsistent with the n = 1 fits from more sensitive methods (e.g. powerspectrum, correlation function). the effect of the low quadrupole derived fromthe cobe-dmr data on the inferred q_{rms-ps} normalization is investigated. abias to lower q_{rms-ps} is found when the quadrupole is included. the highernormalization for a forced n = 1 fit is then favored by the cross-rmstechnique. as initially pointed out in wright et al.

astro-ph;9908070	on the non-gaussianity observed in the cobe-dmr sky maps	in this paper we pursue the origin of the non-gaussianity determined by abispectrum analysis of the cobe-dmr 4-year sky maps. the robustness of thestatistic is demonstrated by the rebinning of the data into 12 coordinatesystems. by computing the bispectrum statistic as a function of various datapartitions - by channel, frequency, and time interval, we show that theobserved non-gaussian signal is driven by the 53 ghz data. this frequencydependence strongly rejects the hypothesis that the signal is cosmological inorigin. a jack-knife analysis of the coadded 53 and 90 ghz sky maps revealsthose sky pixels to which the bispectrum statistic is particularly sensitive.we find that by removing data from the 53 ghz sky maps for periods of timeduring which a known systematic effect perturbs the 31 ghz channels, theamplitudes of the bispectrum coefficients become completely consistent withthat expected for a gaussian sky. we conclude that the non-gaussian signaldetected by the normalised bispectrum statistic in the publicly available dmrsky maps is due to a systematic artifact. the impact of removing the affecteddata on estimates of the normalisation of simple models of cosmologicalanisotropy is negligible.

astro-ph;9910138	a bayesian estimate of the skewness of the cosmic microwave background	we propose a formalism for estimating the skewness and angular power spectrumof a general cosmic microwave background data set. we use the edgeworthexpansion to define a non-gaussian likelihood function that takes into accountthe anisotropic nature of the noise and the incompleteness of the sky coverage.the formalism is then applied to estimate the skewness of the publiclyavailable 4 year cosmic background explorer (cobe) differential microwaveradiometer data. we find that the data is consistent with a gaussian skewness,and with isotropy. inclusion of non gaussian degrees of freedom has essentiallyno effect on estimates of the power spectrum, if each $c_\ell$ is regarded as aseparate parameter or if the angular power spectrum is parametrized in terms ofan amplitude (q) and spectral index (n). fixing the value of the angular powerspectrum at its maxiumum likelihood estimate, the best fit skewness is$s=6.5\pm6.0\times10^4(\muk)^3$; marginalizing over q the estimate of theskewness is $s=6.5\pm8.4\times10^4(\muk)^3$ and marginalizing over n one has$s=6.5\pm8.5\times10^4(\muk)^3$.
