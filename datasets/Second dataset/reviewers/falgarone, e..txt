0906.5025	evidence for dust evolution within the taurus complex from spitzer  images	we present spitzer images of the taurus complex (tc) and take advantage ofthe sensitivity and spatial resolution of the observations to characterize thediffuse ir emission across the cloud. this work highlights evidence of dustevolution within the translucent sections of the archetype reference forstudies of quiescent molecular clouds. we combine spitzer 160 um and iras 100um observations to produce a dust temperature map and a far-ir dust opacity mapat 5' resolution. the average dust temperature is about 14.5k with a dispersionof +/-1k across the cloud. the far-ir dust opacity is a factor 2 larger thanthe average value for the diffuse ism. this opacity increase and theattenuation of the radiation field (rf) both contribute to account for thelower emission temperature of the large grains. the structure of the tcsignificantly changes in the mid-ir images that trace emission from pahs andvsgs. we focus our analysis of the mid-ir emission to a range of eclipticlatitudes where the zodiacal light residuals are small. within this cloud area,there are no 8 and 24 um counterparts to the brightest 160 um emissionfeatures. conversely, the 8 and 24 um images reveal filamentary structure thatis strikingly inconspicuous in the 160 um and extinction maps. the ir colorsvary over sub-parsec distances across this filamentary structure. we comparethe observed colors with model calculations quantifying the impact of the rfintensity and the abundance of stochastically heated particles on the dust sed.to match the range of observed colors, we have to invoke variations by a factorof a few of both the interstellar rf and the abundance of pahs and vsgs. weconclude that within this filamentary structure a significant fraction of thedust mass cycles in and out the small size end of the dust size distribution.

0910.1766	intermittency of interstellar turbulence: extreme velocity-shears and co  emission on milliparsec scale	the condensation of diffuse gas into molecular clouds occurs at a rate drivenlargely by turbulent dissipation. this process still has to be caught in actionand characterized. a mosaic of 13 fields was observed in the co(1-0) line withthe iram-pdb interferometer in the translucent environment of two low-massdense cores. the large size of the mosaic compared to the resolution (4 arcsec)is unprecedented in the study of the small-scale structure of diffuse moleculargas. eight weak and elongated structures of thicknesses as small as 3 mpc (600au) and lengths up to 70mpc are found. these are not filaments because oncemerged with short-spacing data, they appear as the sharp edges of larger-scalestructures. six out of eight form quasi-parallel pairs at different velocitiesand different position angles. this cannot be the result of chance alignment.the velocity-shears estimated for the three pairs include the highest evermeasured far from star forming regions (780 km/s/pc). because the large scalestructures have sharp edges, with little or no overlap, they have to be thinco-layers. their edges mark a sharp transition between a co-rich component anda gas undetected in the co line because of its low co abundance, presumably thecold neutral medium. we propose that these sharp edges are the firstdirectly-detected manifestations of the intermittency of interstellarturbulence. the large velocity-shears reveal an intense straining field,responsible for a local dissipation rate several orders of magnitude aboveaverage, possibly at the origin of the thin co-layers.

0912.1751	measurement of the crab nebula polarization at 90 ghz as a calibrator  for cmb experiments	cmb experiments aiming at a precise measurement of the cmb polarization, suchas the planck satellite, need a strong polarized absolute calibrator on the skyto accurately set the detectors polarization angle and the cross-polarizationleakage. as the most intense polarized source in the microwave sky at angularscales of few arcminutes, the crab nebula will be used for this purpose. ourgoal was to measure the crab nebula polarization characteristics at 90 ghz withunprecedented precision. the observations were carried out with the iram 30mtelescope employing the correlation polarimeter xpol and using two orthogonallypolarized receivers. we processed the stokes i, q, and u maps from ourobservations in order to compute the polarization angle and linear polarizationfraction. the first is almost constant in the region of maximum emission inpolarization with a mean value of alpha_sky=152.1+/-0.3 deg in equatorialcoordinates, and the second is found to reach a maximum of pi=30% for the mostpolarized pixels. we find that a cmb experiment having a 5 arcmin circular beamwill see a mean polarization angle of alpha_sky=149.9+/-0.2 deg and a meanpolarization fraction of pi=8.8+/-0.2%.

1003.3449	energetics of the molecular gas in the h_2 luminous radio galaxy 3c 326:  evidence for negative agn feedback	we present a detailed analysis of the gas conditions in the h_2 luminousradio galaxy 3c326n at z~0.1, which has a low star formation rate (sfr~0.07m_sun/yr) in spite of a gas surface density similar to those in starburstgalaxies. its star-formation efficiency is likely a factor ~20-30 lower thanthose of ordinary star-forming galaxies. combining new iram co emission-lineinterferometry with existing spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy, we find thatthe luminosity ratio of co and pure rotational h_2 line emission is factors10-100 lower than what is usually found. this may suggest that most of themolecular gas is warm. the na d absorption-line profile of 3c326n in theoptical suggests an outflow with a terminal velocity of ~ -1800 km/s and a massoutflow rate of 30-40 m_sun/yr, which cannot be explained by star formation.the mechanical power implied by the wind, of order 10^43 erg/s, is comparableto the bolometric luminosity of the emission lines of ionized and moleculargas. to explain these observations, we propose a scenario where a smallfraction of the mechanical energy of the radio jet is deposited in the theinterstellar medium of 3c326n, which powers the outflow, and the line emissionthrough a mass momentum and energy exchange between the different phases in theism. dissipation times are of order 10^7-8 yrs, similar or greater than thetypical jet lifetime. small ratios of co and pah surface brightnesses inanother 7 h_2 luminous radio galaxies suggest that a similar form of agnfeedback could be lowering star formation efficiencies in these galxies asimilar way. the local demographics of radio-loud agn suggests that secular gascooling in massive early-type galaxies of &gt;= 10^11 m_sun could be regulatedthrough a fundamentally similar form of 'maintenance-phase' agn feedback.

1005.1671	strong absorption by interstellar hydrogen fluoride: herschel/hifi  observations of the sight-line to g10.6-0.4 (w31c)	we report the detection of strong absorption by interstellar hydrogenfluoride along the sight-line to the submillimeter continuum source g10.6-0.4(w31c). we have used herschel's hifi instrument, in dual beam switch mode, toobserve the 1232.4763 ghz j=1-0 hf transition in the upper sideband of the band5a receiver. the resultant spectrum shows weak hf emission from g10.6-0.4 atlsr velocities in the range -10 to -3 km/s, accompanied by strong absorption byforeground material at lsr velocities in the range 15 to 50 km/s. the spectrumis similar to that of the 1113.3430 ghz 1(11)-0(00) transition of para-water,although at some frequencies the hf (hydrogen fluoride) optical depth clearlyexceeds that of para-h2o. the optically-thick hf absorption that we haveobserved places a conservative lower limit of 1.6e+14 cm-2 on the hf columndensity along the sight-line to g10.6-0.4. our lower limit on the hf abundance,6e-9 relative to hydrogen nuclei, implies that hydrogen fluoride accounts forbetween ~ 30 and 100% of the fluorine nuclei in the gas phase along thissight-line. this observation corroborates theoretical predictions that -because the unique thermochemistry of fluorine permits the exothermic reactionof f atoms with molecular hydrogen - hf will be the dominant reservoir ofinterstellar fluorine under a wide range of conditions.

1007.2148	detection of hydrogen fluoride absorption in diffuse molecular clouds  with herschel/hifi: a ubiquitous tracer of molecular gas	we discuss the detection of absorption by interstellar hydrogen fluoride (hf)along the sight line to the submillimeter continuum sources w49n and w51. wehave used herschel's hifi instrument in dual beam switch mode to observe the1232.4762 ghz j = 1 - 0 hf transition in the upper sideband of the band 5areceiver. we detected foreground absorption by hf toward both sources over awide range of velocities. optically thin absorption components were detected onboth sight lines, allowing us to measure - as opposed to obtain a lower limiton - the column density of hf for the first time. as in previous observationsof hf toward the source g10.6-0.4, the derived hf column density is typicallycomparable to that of water vapor, even though the elemental abundance ofoxygen is greater than that of fluorine by four orders of magnitude. we usedthe rather uncertain n(ch)-n(h2) relationship derived previously toward diffusemolecular clouds to infer the molecular hydrogen column density in the cloudsexhibiting hf absorption. within the uncertainties, we find that the abundanceof hf with respect to h2 is consistent with the theoretical prediction that hfis the main reservoir of gas-phase fluorine for these clouds. thus, hydrogenfluoride has the potential to become an excellent tracer of molecular hydrogen,and provides a sensitive probe of clouds of small h2 column density. indeed,the observations of hydrogen fluoride reported here reveal the presence of alow column density diffuse molecular cloud along the w51 sight line, at an lsrvelocity of ~ 24kms-1, that had not been identified in molecular absorptionline studies prior to the launch of herschel.

1009.1558	ground-state ammonia and water in absorption towards sgr b2	we have used the odin submillimetre-wave satellite telescope to observe theground state transitions of ortho-ammonia and ortho-water, including their 15n,18o, and 17o isotopologues, towards sgr b2. the extensive simultaneous velocitycoverage of the observations, &gt;500 km/s, ensures that we can probe theconditions of both the warm, dense gas of the molecular cloud sgr b2 near thegalactic centre, and the more diffuse gas in the galactic disk clouds along theline-of-sight. we present ground-state nh3 absorption in seven distinctvelocity features along the line-of-sight towards sgr b2. we find a nearlylinear correlation between the column densities of nh3 and cs, and asquare-root relation to n2h+. the ammonia abundance in these diffuse galacticdisk clouds is estimated to be about (0.5-1)e-8, similar to that observed fordiffuse clouds in the outer galaxy. on the basis of the detection of h218oabsorption in the 3 kpc arm, and the absence of such a feature in the h217ospectrum, we conclude that the water abundance is around 1e-7, compared to~1e-8 for nh3. the sgr b2 molecular cloud itself is seen in absorption in nh3,15nh3, h2o, h218o, and h217o, with emission superimposed on the absorption inthe main isotopologues. the non-lte excitation of nh3 in the environment of sgrb2 can be explained without invoking an unusually hot (500 k) molecular layer.a hot layer is similarly not required to explain the line profiles of the1_{1,0}-1_{0,1} transition from h2o and its isotopologues. the relatively weak15nh3 absorption in the sgr b2 molecular cloud indicates a high [14n/15n]isotopic ratio &gt;600. the abundance ratio of h218o and h217o is found to berelatively low, 2.5--3. these results together indicate that the dominantnucleosynthesis process in the galactic centre is cno hydrogen burning.

1101.2035	planck early results: the galactic cold core population revealed by the  first all-sky survey	we present the statistical properties of the first version of the cold corecatalogue of planck objects (c3po), in terms of their spatial distribution,temperature, distance, mass, and morphology. we also describe the statistics ofthe early cold core catalogue (ecc, delivered with the early release compactsource catalogue, ercsc) that is the subset of the 915 most reliable detectionsof the complete catalogue. we have used the cococodet algorithm to extract10783 cold sources. temperature and dust emission spectral index {\beta} valuesare derived using the fluxes in the iras 100 \mum band and the three highestfrequency planck bands. temperature spans from 7k to 17k, and peaks around 13k.data are not consistent with a constant value of {\beta} over the alltemperature range. {\beta} ranges from 1.4 to 2.8 with a mean value around 2.1,and several possible scenarios are possible, including {\beta}(t) and theeffect of multiple t components folded into the measurements. for one third ofthe objects the distances are obtained. most of the detections are within 2 kpcin the solar neighbourhood, but a few are at distances greater than 4 kpc. thecores are distributed from the deep galactic plane, despite the confusion, tohigh latitudes (&gt;30$^{\circle}$). the associated mass estimates range from 1 to$10^5$ solar masses. using their physical properties these cold sources areshown to be cold clumps, defined as the intermediate cold sub-structuresbetween clouds and cores. these cold clumps are not isolated but mostlyorganized in filaments associated with molecular clouds. the cold corecatalogue of planck objects (c3po) is the first unbiased all-sky catalogue ofcold objects. it gives an unprecedented statistical view to the properties ofthese potential pre-stellar clumps and offers a unique possibility for theirclassification in terms of their intrinsic properties and environment.

1109.2544	spitzer irs detection of molecular hydrogen rotational emission towards  translucent clouds	using the infrared spectrograph on board the spitzer space telescope, we havedetected emission in the s(0), s(1), and s(2) pure-rotational (v=0-0)transitions of molecular hydrogen (h2) towards 6 positions in two translucenthigh galactic latitude clouds, dcld 300.2-16.9 and ldn 1780. the detection ofthese lines raises important questions regarding the physical conditions insidelow-extinction clouds that are far from ultraviolet radiation sources. theratio between the s(2) flux and the flux from pahs at 7.9 microns averages0.007 for these 6 positions. this is a factor of about 4 higher than the sameratio measured towards the central regions of non-active galaxies in thespitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings). thus the environment of thesetranslucent clouds is more efficient at producing rotationally excited h2 perpah-exciting photon than the disks of entire galaxies. excitation analysisfinds that the s(1) and s(2) emitting regions are warm (t &gt;300k), but compriseno more than 2% of the gas mass. we find that uv photons cannot be the solesource of excitation in these regions and suggest mechanical heating via shocksor turbulent dissipation as the dominant cause of the emission. the clouds arelocated on the outskirts of the scorpius-centaurus ob association and may bedissipating recent bursts of mechanical energy input from supernova explosions.we suggest that pockets of warm gas in diffuse or translucent clouds,integrated over the disks of galaxies, may represent a major source of allnon-active galaxy h2 emission.

1202.1672	galactic cold cores iii. general cloud properties	we examine the cloud structure around the planck detections in 71 fieldsobserved with the herschel spire instrument. we wish to determine the generalphysical characteristics of the fields and to examine the morphology of theclouds where the cold high column density clumps are found. we derive colourtemperature and column density maps of the fields. we examine the infraredspectral energy distributions of the main clumps. the clouds are categorisedaccording to their large scale morphology. with the help of recently releasedwise satellite data, we look for signs of enhanced mid-infrared scattering(coreshine), an indication of growth of the dust grains, and examine the starformation activity associated with the cold clumps. the mapped clouds havedistances ranging from ~100pc to several kiloparsecs and cover a range of sizesand masses from cores of less than 10 solar masses to clouds with masses inexcess of 10000 solar mass. most fields contain some filamentary structures andin about half of the cases a filament or a few filaments dominate themorphology. in one case out of ten, the clouds show a cometary shape or havesharp boundaries indicative of compression by an external force. the width ofthe filaments is typically ~0.2-0.3pc. however, there is significant variationfrom 0.1pc to 1pc and the estimates are sensitive to the methods used and thevery definition of a filament. enhanced mid-infrared scattering, coreshine, wasdetected in four clouds with six additional tentative detections. the cloudldn183 is included in our sample and remains the best example of thisphenomenon. about half of the fields are associated with active star formationas indicated by the presence of mid-infrared point sources. the mid-infraredsources often coincide with structures whose sub-millimetre spectra are stilldominated by the cold dust.

1202.3142	discovery of interstellar mercapto radicals (sh) with the great  instrument on sofia	we report the first detection of interstellar mercapto radicals, obtainedalong the sight-line to the submillimeter continuum source w49n. we have usedthe great instrument on sofia to observe the 1383 ghz doublet pi 3/2 j = 5/2 -3/2 lambda doublet in the upper sideband of the l1 receiver. the resultantspectrum reveals sh absorption in material local to w49n, as well as inforeground gas, unassociated with w49n, that is located along the sight-line.for the foreground material at velocities in the range 37 - 44 km/s withrespect to the local standard of rest, we infer a total sh column density ~ 2.6e+12 cm-2, corresponding to an abundance of ~ 7 e-9 relative to h2, andyielding an sh/h2s abundance ratio ~ 0.13. the observed sh/h2s abundance ratiois much smaller than that predicted by standard models for the production of shand h2s in turbulent dissipation regions and shocks, and suggests that theendothermic neutral-neutral reaction sh + h2 -&gt; h2s + h must be enhanced alongwith the ion-neutral reactions believed to produce ch+ and sh+ in diffusemolecular clouds.

1202.5637	multi-line detection of o2 toward rho oph a	models of pure gas-phase chemistry in well-shielded regions of molecularclouds predict relatively high levels of molecular oxygen, o2, and water, h2o.contrary to expectation, the space missions swas and odin found only very smallamounts of water vapour and essentially no o2 in the dense star-forminginterstellar medium. only toward rho oph a did odin detect a weak line of o2 at119 ghz in a beam size of 10 arcmin. a larger telescope aperture such as thatof the herschel space observatory is required to resolve the o2 emission and topinpoint its origin. we use the heterodyne instrument for the far infraredaboard herschel to obtain high resolution o2 spectra toward selected positionsin rho oph a. these data are analysed using standard techniques for o2excitation and compared to recent pdr-like chemical cloud models. the 487.2ghzline was clearly detected toward all three observed positions in rho oph a. inaddition, an oversampled map of the 773.8ghz transition revealed the detectionof the line in only half of the observed area. based on their ratios, thetemperature of the o2 emitting gas appears to vary quite substantially, withwarm gas (&gt; 50 k) adjacent to a much colder region, where temperatures arebelow 30 k. the exploited models predict o2 column densities to be sensitive tothe prevailing dust temperatures, but rather insensitive to the temperatures ofthe gas. in agreement with these model, the observationally determined o2column densities seem not to depend strongly on the derived gas temperatures,but fall into the range n(o2) = (3 to &gt;6)e15/cm^2. beam averaged o2 abundancesare about 5e-8 relative to h2. combining the hifi data with earlier odinobservations yields a source size at 119 ghz of about 4 - 5 arcmin,encompassing the entire rho oph a core.

1302.0143	comparing polarised synchrotron and thermal dust emission in the  galactic plane	as the next step toward an improved large scale galactic magnetic fieldmodel, we present a simple comparison of polarised synchrotron and thermal dustemission on the galactic plane. we find that the field configuration in ourprevious model that reproduces the polarised synchrotron is not compatible withthe wmap 94 ghz polarised emission data. in particular, the high degree of dustpolarisation in the outer galaxy (90deg &lt; l &lt; 270deg) implies that the fieldsin the dust-emitting regions are more ordered than the average ofsynchrotron-emitting regions. this new dust information allows us to constrainthe spatial mixing of the coherent and random magnetic field components in theouter galaxy. the inner galaxy differs in polarisation degree and apparentlyrequires a more complicated scenario than our current model. in the scenariothat each interstellar component (including fields and now dust) follows aspiral arm modulation, as observed in external galaxies, the changing degree ofordering of the fields in dust-emitting regions may imply that the dust armsand the field component arms are shifted as a varying function ofgalacto-centric radius. we discuss the implications for how the spiral armcompression affects the various components of the magnetised interstellarmedium but conclude that improved data such as that expected from the plancksatellite will be required for a thorough analysis.

1303.5070	planck 2013 results. ix. hfi spectral response	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) spectral response was determinedthrough a series of ground based tests conducted with the hfi focal plane in acryogenic environment prior to launch. the main goal of the spectraltransmission tests was to measure the relative spectral response (includingout-of-band signal rejection) of all hfi detectors. this was determined bymeasuring the output of a continuously scanned fourier transform spectrometercoupled with all hfi detectors. as there is no on-board spectrometer withinhfi, the ground-based spectral response experiments provide the definitive dataset for the relative spectral calibration of the hfi. the spectral response ofthe hfi is used in planck data analysis and component separation, this includesextraction of co emission observed within planck bands, dust emission,sunyaev-zeldovich sources, and intensity to polarization leakage. the hfispectral response data have also been used to provide unit conversion andcolour correction analysis tools. verifications of the hfi spectral responsedata are provided through comparisons with photometric hfi flight data. thisvalidation includes use of hfi zodiacal emission observations to demonstrateout-of-band spectral signal rejection better than 10^8. the accuracy of the hfirelative spectral response data is verified through comparison withcomplementary flight-data based unit conversion coefficients and colourcorrection coefficients. these coefficients include those based upon hfiobservations of co, dust, and sunyaev-zeldovich emission. general agreement isobserved between the ground-based spectral characterization of hfi andcorresponding in-flight observations, within the quoted uncertainty of each;explanations are provided for any discrepancies.

1303.5072	planck 2013 results. xii. component separation	planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bandsbetween 30 and 857 ghz. these observations allow robust reconstruction of theprimordial cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations overnearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on galactic foregrounds. thispaper describes the component separation framework adopted by planck. we testfour foreground-cleaned cmb maps derived using qualitatively differentcomponent separation algorithms. the quality of our reconstructions isevaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shownthrough various tests to be internally consistent and robust for cmb powerspectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. the parameterconstraints on lambdacdm cosmologies derived from these maps are consistentwith those presented in the cross-spectrum based planck likelihood analysis. wechoose two of the cmb maps for specific scientific goals. we also present mapsand frequency spectra of the galactic low-frequency, co, and thermal dustemission. the component maps are found to provide a faithful representation ofthe sky, as evaluated by simulations. for the low-frequency component, thespectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta &lt;-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinningdust spectrum peaking below 20 ghz, a flat index of beta &gt; -2.3 with strongfree-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.

1303.5073	planck 2013 results. xiii. galactic co emission	rotational transition lines of co play a major role in molecular radioastronomy and in particular in the study of star formation and the galacticstructure. although a wealth of data exists in the galactic plane and somewell-known molecular clouds, there is no available co high sensitivity all-skysurvey to date.  such all-sky surveys can be constructed using the \planck\ hfi data becausethe three lowest co rotational transition lines at 115, 230 and 345 ghzsignificantly contribute to the signal of the 100, 217 and 353 ghz hfi channelsrespectively. two different component separation methods are used to extractthe co maps from planck hfi data. the maps obtained are then compared to oneanother and to existing external co surveys. from these quality checks the bestco maps in terms of signal to noise and/or residual foreground contaminationare selected. three sets of velocity-integrated co emission maps are produced:type 1 maps of the co (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions with lowforeground contamination but moderate signal-to-noise ratio; type 2 maps forthe (1-0) and (2-1) transitions with a better signal-to-noise ratio; and onetype 3 map, a line composite map with the best signal-to-noise ratio in orderto locate the faintest molecular regions. the maps are described in detail.they are shown to be fully compatible with previous surveys of parts of thegalactic plane and also of fainter regions out of the galactic plane. theplanck hfi velocity-integrated co maps for the (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2)rotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky co view of the galaxy.these maps are also of great interest to monitor potential co contamination oncmb \planck\ studies.

1307.6815	planck intermediate results. xiv. dust emission at millimetre  wavelengths in the galactic plane	we use planck hfi data combined with ancillary radio data to study theemissivity index of the interstellar dust emission in the frequency range 10 -353 ghz, or 3 - 0.8 mm, in the galactic plane. we analyse the region l=20 degr- 44 degr and |b| \leq 4 degr where the free-free emission can be estimatedfrom radio recombination line data. we fit the spectra at each sky pixel with amodified blackbody model and two spectral indices, beta_mm and beta_fir, belowand above 353 ghz respectively. we find that beta_mm is smaller than beta_firand we detect a correlation between this low frequency power-law index and thedust optical depth at 353 ghz, tau_353. the opacity spectral index beta_mmincreases from about 1.54 in the more diffuse regions of the galactic disk, |b|= 3 degr - 4 degr and tau_353 ~ 5 x 10^{-5}, to about 1.66 in the densestregions with an optical depth of more than one order of magnitude higher. weassociate this correlation with an evolution of the dust emissivity related tothe fraction of molecular gas along the line of sight. this translates intobeta_mm ~ 1.54 for a medium that is mostly atomic and beta_mm ~ 1.66 when themedium is dominated by molecular gas. we find that both the two-level systemmodel and the emission by ferromagnetic particles can explain the results. theresults improve our understanding of the physics of interstellar dust and leadtowards a complete model of the dust spectrum of the milky way fromfar-infrared to millimetre wavelengths.

1312.1300	planck 2013 results. xi. all-sky model of thermal dust emission	this paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the planck 857,545 and 353 ghz, and iras 100 micron data. using a modified black-body fit tothe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, andspectral index over the 353-3000 ghz range. this model is a tightrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. it shows variations of the order of 30% compared with the widely-used model of finkbeiner, davis, and schlegel. theplanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the wholesky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared toprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. anincrease of the dust opacity at 353 ghz, tau_353/n_h, from the diffuse to thedenser interstellar medium (ism) is reported. it is associated with a decreasein the observed dust temperature, t_obs, that could be due at least in part tothe increased dust opacity. we also report an excess of dust emission at hicolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust inthe warm ionized medium. in the diffuse ism at high galactic latitude, wereport an anti-correlation between tau_353/n_h and t_obs while the dustspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. the implication is thatin the diffuse high-latitude ism tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dustcolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlationof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements onstars is strong. to estimate galactic e(b-v) in extragalactic fields at highlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead ofthe dust optical depth, calibrated to e(b-v) using reddening measurements ofquasars deduced from sloan digital sky survey data.

1312.5446	planck intermediate results. xvii. emission of dust in the diffuse  interstellar medium from the far-infrared to microwave frequencies	the dust-hi correlation is used to characterize the emission properties ofdust in the diffuse interstellar medium. we cross-correlate sky maps fromplanck, wmap, and dirbe, at 17 frequencies from 23 to 3000 ghz, with the parkessurvey of the 21-cm line emission of neutral atomic hydrogen, over a contiguousarea of 7500 deg$^2$ centred on the southern galactic pole. our analysis yieldsfour specific results. (1) the dust temperature is observed to beanti-correlated with the dust emissivity and opacity. we interpret this resultas evidence for dust evolution within the diffuse ism. the mean dust opacity ismeasured to be $(7.1 \pm 0.6) 10^{-27} cm^2/h \times (\nu/353\,ghz)^{1.53\pm0.03}$ for $100 &lt; \nu &lt;353$ghz. (2) we map the spectral index ofdust emission at millimetre wavelengths, which is remarkably constant at$\beta_{mm} = 1.51\pm 0.13$. we compare it with the far infrared spectral indexbeta_fir derived from greybody fits at higher frequencies, and find asystematic difference, $\beta_{mm}-\beta_{fir} = -0.15$, which suggests thatthe dust sed flattens at $\nu &lt; 353\,$ghz. (3) we present spectral fits of themicrowave emission correlated with hi from 23 to 353 ghz, which separate dustand anomalous microwave emission. the flattening of the dust sed can beaccounted for with an additional component with a blackbody spectrum, whichaccounts for $(26 \pm 6)$% of the dust emission at 100 ghz and could representmagnetic dipole emission. alternatively, it could account for an increasingcontribution of carbon dust, or a flattening of the emissivity of amorphoussilicates, at millimetre wavelengths. these interpretations make differentpredictions for the dust polarization sed. (4) we identify a galacticcontribution to the residuals of the dust-hi correlation, which we model withvariations of the dust emissivity on angular scales smaller than that of ourcorrelation analysis.

1402.3187	heating of the molecular gas in the massive outflow of the local  ultraluminous-infrared and radio-loud galaxy 4c12.50	we present a comparison of the molecular gas properties in the outflow vs. inthe ambient medium of the local prototype radio-loud and ultraluminous-infraredgalaxy 4c12.50 (iras13451+1232), using new data from the iram plateau de bureinterferometer and 30m telescope, and the herschel space telescope. previoush_2 (0-0) s(1) and s(2) observations with the spitzer space telescope hadindicated that the warm (~400k) molecular gas in 4c12.50 is made up of a1.4(+-0.2)x10^8 m_sun ambient reservoir and a 5.2(+-1.7)x10^7 m_sun outflow.the new co(1-0) data cube indicates that the corresponding cold (25k) h_2 gasmass is 1.0(+-0.1)x10^10 m_sun for the ambient medium and &lt;1.3x10^8 m_sun forthe outflow, when using a co-intensity-to-h_2-mass conversion factor alpha of0.8 m_sun /(k km/s pc^2). the combined mass outflow rate is high, 230-800m_sun/yr, but the amount of gas that could escape the galaxy is low. apotential inflow of gas from a 3.3(+-0.3)x10^8 m_sun tidal tail could moderateany mass loss. the mass ratio of warm-to-cold molecular gas is &gt;= 30 timeshigher in the outflow than in the ambient medium, indicating that anon-negligible fraction of the accelerated gas is heated to temperatures atwhich star formation is inefficient. this conclusion is robust against the useof different alpha factor values, and/or different warm gas tracers (h_2 vs.h_2 plus co): with the co-probed gas mass being at least 40 times lower at 400kthan at 25k, the total warm-to-cold mass ratio is always lower in the ambientgas than in the entrained gas. heating of the molecular gas could facilitatethe detection of new outflows in distant galaxies by enhancing their emissionin intermediate rotational number co lines.

1402.6619	hydrogen fluoride toward luminous nearby galaxies: ngc 253 and ngc 4945	we present the detection of hydrogen fluoride, hf, in two luminous nearbygalaxies ngc 253 and ngc 4945 using the heterodyne instrument for thefar-infrared (hifi) on board the herschel space observatory. the hf line towardngc 253 has a p-cygni profile, while an asymmetric absorption profile is seentoward ngc 4945. the p-cygni profile in ngc 253 suggests an outflow ofmolecular gas with a mass of m(h$_2$)$_{out}$ $\sim$ 1 $\times$ 10$^7$m$_\odot$ and an outflow rate as large as \.{m} $\sim$ 6.4 m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$.in the case of ngc 4945, the axisymmetric velocity components in the hf lineprofile is compatible with the interpretation of a fast-rotating nuclear ringsurrounding the nucleus and the presence of inflowing gas. the gas falls intothe nucleus with an inflow rate of $\le$ 1.2 m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, inside ainner radius of $\le$ 200 pc. the gas accretion rate to the central agn is muchsmaller, suggesting that the inflow can be triggering a nuclear starburst. fromthese results, the hf $j = 1-0$ line is seen to provide an important probe ofthe kinematics of absorbing material along the sight-line to nearby galaxieswith bright dust continuum and a promising new tracer of molecular gas inhigh-redshift galaxies.

1405.0871	planck intermediate results. xix. an overview of the polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust	this paper presents the large-scale polarized sky as seen by planck hfi at353 ghz, which is the most sensitive planck channel for dust polarization. weconstruct and analyse large-scale maps of dust polarization fraction andpolarization direction, while taking account of noise bias and possiblesystematic effects. we find that the maximum observed dust polarizationfraction is high (pmax &gt; 18%), in particular in some of the intermediate dustcolumn density (av &lt; 1mag) regions. there is a systematic decrease in the dustpolarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret thefeatures of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignmentpredictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. we alsocharacterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angledispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes,the polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated byfilamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field skyprojection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust columndensity. the polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with thedispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likelydue to fluctuations in the 3d magnetic field orientation along the line ofsight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.we also compare the dustemission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the planck lfi,with low-frequency radio data, and with faraday rotation measurements ofextragalactic sources. the two polarized components are globally similar instructure along the plane and notably in the fan and north polar spur regions.a detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust andcosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirmsthat much of the variation observed in the planck data is due to the 3dstructure of the magnetic field.

1405.0872	planck intermediate results. xx. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust with simulations of mhd turbulence	polarized emission observed by planck hfi at 353 ghz towards a sample ofnearby fields is presented, focusing on the statistics of polarizationfractions $p$ and angles $\psi$. the polarization fractions and columndensities in these nearby fields are representative of the range of valuesobtained over the whole sky. we find that: (i) the largest polarizationfractions are reached in the most diffuse fields; (ii) the maximum polarizationfraction $p_\mathrm{max}$ decreases with column density $n_\mathrm{h}$ in themore opaque fields with $n_\mathrm{h} &gt; 10^{21}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$; and (iii)the polarization fraction along a given line of sight is correlated with thelocal spatial coherence of the polarization angle. these observations arecompared to polarized emission maps computed in simulations of anisotropicmagnetohydrodynamical (mhd) turbulence in which we assume a uniform intrinsicpolarization fraction of the dust grains. we find that an estimate of thisparameter may be recovered from the maximum polarization fraction$p_\mathrm{max}$ in diffuse regions where the magnetic field is ordered onlarge scales and perpendicular to the line of sight. this emphasizes the impactof anisotropies of the magnetic field on the emerging polarization signal. thedecrease of the polarization fraction with column density in nearby molecularclouds is well reproduced in the simulations, indicating that it is essentiallydue to the turbulent structure of the magnetic field: an accumulation ofvariously polarized structures along the line of sight leads to such ananti-correlation. in the simulations, polarization fractions are also found toanti-correlate with the angle dispersion function $\mathcal{s}$.

1405.0873	planck intermediate results. xxi. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust at 353 ghz with interstellar polarization in the  visible	the planck survey provides unprecedented full-sky coverage of thesubmillimetre polarized emission from galactic dust, bringing new constraintson the properties of dust. the dust grains that emit the radiation seen byplanck in the submillimetre also extinguish and polarize starlight in thevisible. comparison of the polarization of the emission and of the interstellarpolarization on selected lines of sight probed by stars provides unique newdiagnostics of the emission and light scattering properties of dust. usingancillary catalogues of interstellar polarization and extinction of starlight,we obtain the degree of polarization, $p_v$ , and the optical depth in the vband to the star, $\tau_v$. toward these stars we measure the submillimetrepolarized intensity, $p_s$, and total intensity, $i_s$, in the planck 353 ghzchannel. for those lines of sight through the diffuse interstellar medium withcomparable values of the estimated column density and polarization directionsclose to orthogonal, we correlate properties in the submillimetre and visibleto find two ratios, $r_{s/v} = (p_s/i_s)/(p_v/\tau_v)$ and $r_{p/p} = p_s/p_v$, the latter focusing directly on the polarization properties of the alignedgrain population alone. we find $r_{s/v}$ = 4.2, with statistical andsystematic uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, and $r_{p/p}$ = 5.4 mjysr$^{-1}$, with uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3 mjy sr$^{-1}$, respectively. ourestimate of $r_{s/v}$ is compatible with predictions based on a range ofpolarizing dust models that have been developed for the diffuse interstellarmedium. however, our estimate of $r_{p/p}$ is not compatible with predictions,which are too low by a factor of about 2.5. this more discriminatingdiagnostic, $r_{p/p}$, indicates that changes to the optical properties in themodels of the aligned grain population are required.

1405.0874	planck intermediate results. xxii. frequency dependence of thermal  emission from galactic dust in intensity and polarization	planck has mapped the intensity and polarization of the sky at microwavefrequencies with unprecedented sensitivity. we make use of the planck 353 ghzi, q, and u stokes maps as dust templates, and cross-correlate them with theplanck and wmap data at 12 frequencies from 23 to 353 ghz, over circularpatches with 10 degree radius. the cross-correlation analysis is performed forboth intensity and polarization data in a consistent manner. we use a mask thatfocuses our analysis on the diffuse interstellar medium at intermediategalactic latitudes. we determine the spectral indices of dust emission inintensity and polarization between 100 and 353 ghz, for each sky-patch. themean values, $1.59\pm0.02$ for polarization and $1.51\pm0.01$ for intensity,for a mean dust temperature of 19.6 k, are close, but significantly different($3.6\,\sigma$). we determine the mean spectral energy distribution (sed) ofthe microwave emission, correlated with the 353 ghz dust templates, byaveraging the results of the correlation over all sky-patches. we find that themean sed increases for decreasing frequencies at $\nu &lt; 60$ ghz, for bothintensity and polarization. the rise of the polarization sed towards lowfrequencies may be accounted for by a synchrotron component correlated withdust, with no need for any polarization of the anomalous microwave emission. weuse a spectral model to separate the synchrotron and dust polarization and tocharacterize the spectral dependence of the dust polarization fraction. thepolarization fraction ($p$) of the dust emission decreases by $(21\pm6)$ % from353 to 70 ghz. the decrease of $p$ could indicate differences in polarizationefficiency among components of interstellar dust (e.g., carbon versus silicategrains). our observational results provide inputs to quantify and optimize theseparation between galactic and cosmological polarization.

1406.3052	first detection of [n ii] 205 micrometer absorption in interstellar gas	we present high resolution [nii] 205 micrometer ^3p_1-^3p_0 spectra obtainedwith herschel-hifi towards a small sample of far-infrared bright star formingregions in the galactic plane: w31c (g10.6-0.4), w49n (g43.2-0.1), w51(g49.5-0.4), and g34.3+0.1. all sources display an emission line profileassociated directly with the hii regions themselves. for the first time we alsodetect absorption of the [nii] 205 micrometer line by extended low-densityforeground material towards w31c and w49n over a wide range of velocities. weattribute this absorption to the warm ionised medium (wim) and findn(n^+)\approx 1.5x10^17 cm^-2 towards both sources. this is in agreement withrecent herschel-hifi observations of [cii] 158 micrometer, also observed inabsorption in the same sight-lines, if \approx7-10 % of all c^+ ions exist inthe wim on average. using an abundance ratio of [n]/[h] = 6.76x10^-5 in the gasphase we find that the mean electron and proton volume densities are ~0.1-0.3cm^-3 assuming a wim volume filling fraction of 0.1-0.4 with a correspondingline-of-sight filling fraction of 0.46-0.74. a low density and a high wimfilling fraction are also supported by radex modelling of the [nii] 205micrometer absorption and emission together with visible emission linesattributed mainly to the wim. the detection of the 205 micrometer line inabsorption emphasises the importance of a high spectral resolution, and alsooffers a new tool for investigation of the wim.

1409.5738	planck intermediate results. xxx. the angular power spectrum of  polarized dust emission at intermediate and high galactic latitudes	the polarized thermal emission from galactic dust is the main foregroundpresent in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) at frequencies above 100ghz. we exploit the planck hfi polarization datafrom 100 to 353ghz to measure the dust angular power spectra $c_\ell^{ee,bb}$over the range $40&lt;\ell&lt;600$ well away from the galactic plane. these willbring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determinationof the level of contamination for cmb polarization experiments. we show thatstatistical properties of the emission can be characterized over largefractions of the sky using $c_\ell$. for the dust, they are well described bypower laws in $\ell$ with exponents $\alpha^{ee,bb}=-2.42\pm0.02$. theamplitudes of the polarization $c_\ell$ vary with the average brightness in away similar to the intensity ones. the dust polarization frequency dependenceis consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\beta_d=1.59$ and$t_d=19.6$k. we find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the galactic$b$- and $e$-modes of 0.5. we show that even in the faintest dust-emittingregions there are no "clean" windows where primordial cmb $b$-mode polarizationcould be measured without subtraction of dust emission. finally, we investigatethe level of dust polarization in the bicep2 experiment field. extrapolation ofthe planck 353ghz data to 150ghz gives a dust power$\ell(\ell+1)c_\ell^{bb}/(2\pi)$ of $1.32\times10^{-2}\mu$k$_{cmb}^2$ over the$40&lt;\ell&lt;120$ range; the statistical uncertainty is $\pm0.29$ and there is anadditional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the sameunits. this is the same magnitude as reported by bicep2 over this $\ell$ range,which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal even inthe cleanest windows of the sky.

1409.6728	planck intermediate results. xxxii. the relative orientation between the  magnetic field and structures traced by interstellar dust	the role of the magnetic field in the formation of the filamentary structuresobserved in the interstellar medium (ism) is a debated topic. the planckall-sky maps of linearly polarized emission from dust at 353ghz provide therequired combination of imaging and statistics to study the correlation betweenthe structures of the galactic magnetic field and of interstellar matter, bothin the diffuse ism and in molecular clouds. the data reveal structures, orridges, in the intensity map with counterparts in the stokes q and/or u maps.we focus on structures at intermediate and high galactic latitudes with columndensity from $10^{20}$ to $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. we measure the magnetic fieldorientation on the plane of the sky from the polarization data, and present analgorithm to estimate the orientation of the ridges from the dust intensitymap. we use analytical models to account for projection effects. comparingpolarization angles on and off the structures, we estimate the mean ratiobetween the strengths of the turbulent and mean components of the magneticfield to be between 0.6 and 1.0, with a preferred value of 0.8. we find thatthe ridges are preferentially aligned with the magnetic field measured on thestructures. this trend becomes more striking for increasing polarizationfraction and decreasing column density. we interpret the increase of alignmentwith polarization fraction as a consequence of projections effects. thedecrease of alignment for high column density is not due to a loss ofcorrelation between the structures and the geometry of the magnetic field. inmolecular complexes, we observe structures perpendicular to the magnetic field,which cannot be accounted for by projection effects. we discuss our results inthe context of models and mhd simulations, which describe the formation ofstructures in the magnetized ism.

1410.4663	[cii] absorption and emission in the diffuse interstellar medium across  the galactic plane	ionized carbon is the main gas-phase reservoir of carbon in the neutraldiffuse interstellar medium and its 158 micron fine structure transition [cii]is the most important cooling line of the diffuse interstellar medium (ism). wecombine [cii] absorption and emission spectroscopy to gain an improvedunderstanding of physical conditions in the different phases of the ism. wepresent high resolution [cii] spectra obtained with the herschel/hifiinstrument towards bright dust continuum sources regions in the galactic plane,probing simultaneously the diffuse gas along the line of sight and thebackground high-mass star forming regions. these data are complemented byobservations of the 492 and 809 ghz fine structure lines of atomic carbon andby medium spectral resolution spectral maps of the fine structure lines ofatomic oxygen at 63 and 145 microns with herschel/pacs. we show that thepresence of foreground absorption may completely cancel the emission from thebackground source in medium spectral resolution data and that high spectralresolution spectra are needed to interpret the [cii] and [oi] emission and the[cii]/fir ratio. this phenomenon may explain part of the [cii]/fir deficit seenin external luminous infrared galaxies. the c+ and c excitation in the diffusegas is consistent with a median pressure of 5900 kcm-3 for a mean tk ~100 k.the knowledge of the gas density allows us to determine the filling factor ofthe absorbing gas along the selected lines of sight: the median value is 2.4 %,in good agreement with the cnm properties. the mean excitation temperature isused to derive the average cooling due to c+ in the galactic plane : 9.5 x10^{-26} erg/s/h. along the observed lines of sight, the gas phase carbonabundance does not exhibit a strong gradient as a function of galacto-centricradius and has a weighted average of c/h = 1.5 +/- 0.4 x 10^{-4}.

1410.6155	exceptional agn-driven turbulence inhibits star formation in the 3c 326n  radio-galaxy	we detect bright [cii]158$\mu$m line emission from the radio galaxy 3c 326nat z=0.09, which shows weak star formation ($sfr&lt;0.07$m$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$)despite having strong h$_2$ line emission and $2\times 10^9$m$_{\odot}$ ofmolecular gas. the [cii] line is twice as strong as the 0-0s(1) 17$\mu$m h$_2$line, and both lines are much in excess what is expected from uv heating. wecombine infrared spitzer and herschel data with gas and dust modeling to inferthe gas physical conditions. the [cii] line traces 30 to 50% of the moleculargas mass, which is warm (70&lt;t&lt;100k) and at moderate densities$700&lt;n_{h}&lt;3000$cm$^{-3}$. the [cii] line is broad with a blue-shifted wing,and likely to be shaped by a combination of rotation, outflowing gas, andturbulence. it matches the near-infrared h$_2$ and the na d optical absorptionlines. if the wing is interpreted as an outflow, the mass loss rate would belarger than 20m$_{\odot}$/yr, and the depletion timescale shorter than theorbital timescale ($10^8$yr). these outflow rates may be over-estimated becausethe stochastic injection of turbulence on galactic scales can contribute to theskewness of the line profile and mimic outflowing gas. we argue that thedissipation of turbulence is the main heating process of this gas. cosmic rayscan also contribute to the heating but they require an average gas densitylarger than the observational constraints. we show that strong turbulentsupport maintains a high gas vertical scale height (0.3-4kpc) in the disk andcan inhibit the formation of gravitationally-bound structures at all scales,offering a natural explanation for the weakness of star formation in 3c 326n.to conclude, the bright [cii] line indicates that strong agn jet-driventurbulence may play a key role in enhancing the amount of molecular gas(positive feedback) but yet can prevent star formation on galactic scales(negative feedback).

1412.1106	herschel survey of galactic oh+, h2o+, and h3o+: probing the molecular  hydrogen fraction and cosmic-ray ionization rate	in diffuse interstellar clouds the chemistry that leads to the formation ofthe oxygen bearing ions oh+, h2o+, and h3o+ begins with the ionization ofatomic hydrogen by cosmic rays, and continues through subsequent hydrogenabstraction reactions involving h2. given these reaction pathways, the observedabundances of these molecules are useful in constraining both the totalcosmic-ray ionization rate of atomic hydrogen (zeta_h) and molecular hydrogenfraction, f(h2). we present observations targeting transitions of oh+, h2o+,and h3o+ made with the herschel space observatory along 20 galactic sight linestoward bright submillimeter continuum sources. both oh+ and h2o+ are detectedin absorption in multiple velocity components along every sight line, but h3o+is only detected along 7 sight lines. from the molecular abundances we computef(h2) in multiple distinct components along each line of sight, and find agaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation 0.042+-0.018. thisconfirms previous findings that oh+ and h2o+ primarily reside in gas with lowh2 fractions. we also infer zeta_h throughout our sample, and find a log-normaldistribution with mean log(zeta_h)=-15.75, (zeta_h=1.78x10^-16 s^-1), andstandard deviation 0.29 for gas within the galactic disk, but outside of thegalactic center. this is in good agreement with the mean and distribution ofcosmic-ray ionization rates previously inferred from h3+ observations.ionization rates in the galactic center tend to be 10--100 times larger thanfound in the galactic disk, also in accord with prior studies.

1501.00922	planck intermediate results. xxxiv. the magnetic field structure in the  rosette nebula	planck has mapped the polarized dust emission over the whole sky, making itpossible to trace the galactic magnetic field structure that pervades theinterstellar medium (ism). we combine polarization data from planck withrotation measure (rm) observations towards a massive star-forming region, therosette nebula in the monoceros molecular cloud, to study its magnetic fieldstructure and the impact of an expanding hii region on the morphology of thefield. we derive an analytical solution for the magnetic field, assumed toevolve from an initially uniform configuration following the expansion ofionized gas and the formation of a shell of swept-up ism. from the rm data weestimate a mean value of the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field ofabout 3microg (towards the observer) in the rosette nebula, for a uniformelectron density of about 12cm-3. the dust shell that surrounds the rosette hiiregion is clearly observed in the planck intensity map at 353 ghz, with apolarization signal significantly different from that of the local backgroundwhen considered as a whole. the planck observations constrain theplane-of-the-sky orientation of the magnetic field in the rosette's parentmolecular cloud to be mostly aligned with the large-scale field along thegalactic plane. the planck data are compared with the analytical model, whichpredicts the mean polarization properties of a spherical and uniform dust shellfor a given orientation of the field. this comparison leads to an upper limitof about 45degr on the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic fieldin the rosette complex, for an assumed intrinsic dust polarization fraction of4%. this field direction can reproduce the rm values detected in the ionizedregion if the magnetic field strength in the monoceros molecular cloud is inthe range 6.5--9microg.

1502.00612	a joint analysis of bicep2/keck array and planck data	we report the results of a joint analysis of data from bicep2/keck array andplanck. bicep2 and keck array have observed the same approximately 400 deg$^2$patch of sky centered on ra 0h, dec. $-57.5\deg$. the combined maps reach adepth of 57 nk deg in stokes $q$ and $u$ in a band centered at 150 ghz. planckhas observed the full sky in polarization at seven frequencies from 30 to 353ghz, but much less deeply in any given region (1.2 $\mu$k deg in $q$ and $u$ at143 ghz). we detect 150$\times$353 cross-correlation in $b$-modes at highsignificance. we fit the single- and cross-frequency power spectra atfrequencies $\geq 150$ ghz to a lensed-$\lambda$cdm model that includes dustand a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves (asparameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$), using a prior on thefrequency spectral behavior of polarized dust emission from previous \planck\analysis of other regions of the sky. we find strong evidence for dust and nostatistically significant evidence for tensor modes. we probe various modelvariations and extensions, including adding a synchrotron component incombination with lower frequency data, and find that these make littledifference to the $r$ constraint. finally we present an alternative analysiswhich is similar to a map-based cleaning of the dust contribution, and showthat this gives similar constraints. the final result is expressed as alikelihood curve for $r$, and yields an upper limit $r_{0.05}&lt;0.12$ at 95%confidence. marginalizing over dust and $r$, lensing $b$-modes are detected at$7.0\,\sigma$ significance.

1502.01588	planck 2015 results. x. diffuse component separation: foreground maps	planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and857 ghz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 ghz in polarization.in this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical componentseparation, and process these maps within a bayesian framework to derive aconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. for the temperatureanalysis, we combine the planck observations with the 9-year wmap sky maps andthe haslam et al. 408 mhz map to derive a joint model of cmb, synchrotron,free-free, spinning dust, co, line emission in the 94 and 100 ghz channels, andthermal dust emission. full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutionsvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the skymodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. for polarization, the model includescmb, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. these models provide excellentfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 ukover 93% of the sky for all planck frequencies up to 353 ghz, and fractionalerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. the main limitations ofthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among thespinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observationsfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. themain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies areuncertainties in the 545 and 857 ghz calibration and zero-points. forpolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the100-353 ghz bands on large angular scales in the form oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digitalconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expectedto improve in the near future.

1502.04123	planck intermediate results. xxxv. probing the role of the magnetic  field in the formation of structure in molecular clouds	within ten nearby (d &lt; 450 pc) gould belt molecular clouds we evaluatestatistically the relative orientation between the magnetic field projected onthe plane of sky, inferred from the polarized thermal emission of galactic dustobserved by planck at 353 ghz, and the gas column density structures,quantified by the gradient of the column density, $n_h$. the selected regions,covering several degrees in size, are analyzed at an effective angularresolution of 10' fwhm, thus sampling physical scales from 0.4 to 40 pc in thenearest cloud. the column densities in the selected regions range from $n_h\approx 10^{21}$ to $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and hence they correspond to the bulkof the molecular clouds. the relative orientation is evaluated pixel by pixeland analyzed in bins of column density using the novel statistical tool called"histogram of relative orientations". throughout this study, we assume that thepolarized emission observed by planck at 353 ghz is representative of theprojected morphology of the magnetic field in each region, i.e., we assume aconstant dust grain alignment efficiency, independent of the local environment.within most clouds we find that the relative orientation changes progressivelywith increasing $n_h$, from preferentially parallel or having no preferredorientation to preferentially perpendicular. in simulations ofmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence in molecular clouds this trend in relativeorientation is a signature of alfv\'enic or sub-alfv\'enic turbulence, implyingthat the magnetic field is significant for the gas dynamics at the scalesprobed by planck. we compare the deduced magnetic field strength with estimateswe obtain from other methods and discuss the implications of the planckobservations for the general picture of molecular cloud formation andevolution.

1502.05710	sulphur-bearing molecules in diffuse molecular clouds: new results from  sofia/great and the iram 30 m telescope	we have observed five sulphur-bearing molecules in foreground diffusemolecular clouds lying along the sight-lines to five bright continuum sources.we have used the great instrument on sofia to observe the 1383 ghz $^2\pi_{3/2}j=5/2-3/2$ transitions of sh towards the star-forming regions w31c,g29.96-0.02, g34.3+0.1, w49n and w51, detecting foreground absorption towardsall five sources; and the emir receivers on the iram 30m telescope at picoveleta to detect the h$_2$s 1(10)-1(01), cs j=2-1 and so 3(2)-2(1) transitions.in nine foreground absorption components detected towards these sources, theinferred column densities of the four detected molecules showed relativelyconstant ratios, with n(sh)/n(h$_2$s) in the range 1.1 - 3.0, n(cs)/n(h$_2$s)in the range 0.32 - 0.61, and n(so)/n(h$_2$s) in the range 0.08 - 0.30. theobserved sh/h$_2$ ratios - in the range (0.5-2.6) $\times 10^{-8}$ - indicatethat sh (and other sulphur-bearing molecules) account for &lt;&lt; 1% of thegas-phase sulphur nuclei. the observed abundances of sulphur-bearing molecules,however, greatly exceed those predicted by standard models of cold diffusemolecular clouds, providing further evidence for the enhancement of endothermicreaction rates by elevated temperatures or ion-neutral drift. we haveconsidered the observed abundance ratios in the context of shock and turbulentdissipation region (tdr) models. using the tdr model, we find that theturbulent energy available at large scale in the diffuse ism is sufficient toexplain the observed column densities of sh and cs. standard shock and tdrmodels, however, fail to reproduce the column densities of h$_2$s and so by afactor of about 10; more elaborate shock models - in which account is taken ofthe velocity drift, relative to h$_2$, of sh molecules produced by thedissociative recombination of h$_3$s$^+$ - reduce this discrepancy to a factor~ 3.

1502.05956	planck 2015 results. ix. diffuse component separation: cmb maps	we present foreground-reduced cmb maps derived from the full planck data setin both temperature and polarization. compared to the corresponding planck 2013temperature sky maps, the total data volume is larger by a factor of 3.2 forfrequencies between 30 and 70 ghz, and by 1.9 for frequencies between 100 and857 ghz. in addition, systematic errors in the forms oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, analogue-to-digital conversionuncertainties, and very long time constant errors have been dramaticallyreduced, to the extent that the cosmological polarization signal may now berobustly recovered on angular scales $\ell\gtrsim40$. on the very largestscales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared tothe expected cosmological signal, and modes with $\ell &lt; 20$ are accordinglysuppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering. as in 2013,four different cmb component separation algorithms are applied to theseobservations, providing a measure of stability with respect to algorithmic andmodelling choices. the resulting polarization maps have rms instrumental noiseranging between 0.21 and 0.27$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 55 arcmin pixels,and between 4.5 and 6.1$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 3.4 arcmin pixels. thecosmological parameters derived from the analysis of temperature power spectraare in agreement at the $1\sigma$ level with the planck 2015 likelihood.unresolved mismatches between the noise properties of the data and simulationsprevent a satisfactory description of the higher-order statistical propertiesof the polarization maps. thus, the primary applications of these polarizationmaps are those that do not require massive simulations for accurate estimationof uncertainties, for instance estimation of cross-spectra andcross-correlations, or stacking analyses.

1503.08773	planck intermediate results. xxvii. high-redshift infrared galaxy  overdensity candidates and lensed sources discovered by planck and confirmed  by herschel-spire	[abridged] we use the planck all-sky submm and mm maps to search for raresources distinguished by extreme brightness, a few hundreds of mjy, and theirpotential for being situated at high redshift. these "cold" planck sources,selected using the high frequency instrument (hfi) directly from the maps andfrom the planck catalogue of compact sources (pccs), all satisfy the criterionof having their rest-frame far-infrared peak redshifted to the frequency range353 and 857 ghz. this colour-selection favours galaxies in the redshift rangez=2-4, which we consider as cold peaks in the cosmic infrared background (cib).we perform a dedicated herschel-spire follow-up of 234 such planck targets,finding a significant excess of red 350 and 500um sources, in comparison toreference spire fields. about 94% of the spire sources in the planck fields areconsistent with being overdensities of galaxies peaking at 350um. about 3% arecandidate lensed systems, all 12 of which have secure spectroscopicconfirmations, placing them at redshifts z&gt;2.2. the galaxy overdensities aredetected with high significance, half of the sample showing statisticalsignificance above 10sigma. the spire photometric redshifts of galaxies inoverdensities suggest a peak at z~2. under the td=35k assumption, we derive aninfrared (ir) luminosity for each spire source of about 4x10^12 lsun, yieldingstar formation rates of typically 700 msun.yr^-1. if the observed overdensitiesare actual gravitationally-bound structures, the total total star formationrates reaches 7x10^3 msun.yr^-1. taken together, these sources show thesignatures of high-z (z&gt;$) protoclusters of intensively star-forming galaxies.all these observations confirm the uniqueness of our sample and demonstrate theability of the all-sky planck-hfi cold sources to select populations ofcosmological and astrophysical interest for structure formation studies.

0805.3109	the molecular hydrogen explorer h2ex	the molecular hydrogen explorer, h2ex, was proposed in response to the esa2015 - 2025 cosmic vision call as a medium class space mission with nasa andcsa participations. the mission, conceived to understand the formation ofgalaxies, stars and planets from molecular hydrogen, is designed to observe thefirst rotational lines of the h2 molecule (28.2, 17.0, 12.3 and 9.7 micron)over a wide field, and at high spectral resolution. h2ex can provide aninventory of warm (&gt; 100 k) molecular gas in a broad variety of objects,including nearby young star clusters, galactic molecular clouds, activegalactic nuclei, local and distant galaxies. the rich array of molecular,atomic and ionic lines, as well as solid state features available in the 8 to29 micron spectral range brings additional science dimensions to h2ex. wepresent the optical and mechanical design of the h2ex payload based on aninnovative imaging fourier transform spectrometer (ifts) fed by a 1.2mtelescope. the 20'x20' field of view is imaged on two 1024x1024 si:asdetectors. the maximum resolution of 0.032 cm^-1 (fwhm) means a velocityresolution of 10 km s^-1 for the 0-0 s(3) line at 9.7 micron. this instrumentoffers the large field of view necessary to survey extended emission in thegalaxy and local universe galaxies as well as to perform unbiased extragalacticand circumstellar disks surveys. the high spectral resolution makes h2exuniquely suited to study the dynamics of h2 in all these environments. themission plan is made of seven wide-field spectro-imaging legacy programs, fromthe cosmic web to galactic young star clusters, within a nominal two yearsmission. the payload has been designed to re-use the planck platform andpassive cooling design.

1508.03801	velocity-resolved [cii] emission and [cii]/fir mapping along orion with  herschel	we present the first 7.5'x11.5' velocity-resolved map of the [cii]158um linetoward the orion molecular cloud-1 (omc-1) taken with the herschel/hifiinstrument. in combination with far-infrared (fir) photometric images andvelocity-resolved maps of the h41alpha hydrogen recombination and co j=2-1lines, this data set provides an unprecedented view of the intricatesmall-scale kinematics of the ionized/pdr/molecular gas interfaces and of theradiative feedback from massive stars. the main contribution to the [cii]luminosity (~85%) is from the extended, fuv-illuminated face of the cloudg_0&gt;500, n_h&gt;5x10^3 cm^-3) and from dense pdrs (g_0~10^4, n_h~10^5 cm^-3) atthe interface between omc-1 and the hii region surrounding the trapeziumcluster. around 15% of the [cii] emission arises from a different gas componentwithout co counterpart. the [cii] excitation, pdr gas turbulence, line opacity(from [13cii]) and role of the geometry of the illuminating stars with respectto the cloud are investigated. we construct maps of the [cii]/fir and fir/m_gasratios and show that [cii]/fir decreases from the extended cloud component(10^-2-10^-3) to the more opaque star-forming cores (10^-3-10^-4). the lowestvalues are reminiscent of the "[cii] deficit" seen in local ultra-luminous irgalaxies hosting vigorous star formation. spatial correlation analysis showsthat the decreasing [cii]/fir ratio correlates better with the column densityof dust through the molecular cloud than with fir/m_gas. we conclude that the[cii] emitting column relative to the total dust column along each line ofsight is responsible for the observed [cii]/fir variations through the cloud.

1508.04171	planck intermediate results. xxxix. the planck list of high-redshift  source candidates	the planck mission, thanks to its large frequency range and all-sky coverage,has a unique potential for systematically detecting the brightest, and rarest,submillimetre sources on the sky, including distant objects in thehigh-redshift universe traced by their dust emission. a novel method, based ona component-separation procedure using a combination of planck and iras data,has been applied to select the most luminous cold submm sources with spectralenergy distributions peaking between 353 and 857ghz at 5' resolution. a totalof 2151 planck high-z source candidates (the phz) have been detected in thecleanest 26% of the sky, with flux density at 545ghz above 500mjy. embedded inthe cosmic infrared background close to the confusion limit, these high-zcandidates exhibit colder colours than their surroundings, consistent withredshifts z&gt;2, assuming a dust temperature of 35k and a spectral index of 1.5.first follow-up observations obtained from optical to submm have confirmed thatthis list consists of two distinct populations. a small fraction (around 3%) ofthe sources have been identified as strongly gravitationally lensedstar-forming galaxies, which are amongst the brightest submm lensed objects(with flux density at 545ghz ranging from 350mjy up to 1jy) at redshift 2 to 4.however, the vast majority of the phz sources appear as overdensities of dustystar-forming galaxies, having colours consistent with z&gt;2, and may beconsidered as proto-cluster candidates. the phz provides an original sample,complementary to the planck sunyaev-zeldovich catalogue; by extending thepopulation of the virialized massive galaxy clusters to a population of sourcesat z&gt;1.5, the phz may contain the progenitors of today's clusters. hence thephz opens a new window on the study of the early ages of structure formation,and the understanding of the intensively star-forming phase at high-z.

astro-ph;0002259	the elusive structure of the diffuse molecular gas: shocks or vortices  in compressible turbulence?	the cold diffuse interstellar medium must harbor pockets of hot gas toproduce the large observed abundances of molecular species, the formation ofwhich require much more energy than available in the bulk of its volume. thesehot spots have so far escaped direct detection but observations and modelingseverely constrain their phase-space structure i.e. they must have a smallvolume filling factor (a few %), surface filling factors larger than unity withlarge fluctuations about average and comparable velocity structure in ``pencilbeams'' and ``large beams''. the dissipation of the non-thermal energy ofsupersonic turbulence occurs in bursts, either in shocks or in the regions oflarge shear at the boundary of coherent vortices. these two processes aresusceptible to generate localized hot regions in the cold medium. yet, it is ofinterest to determine which of them, if any, dominates the dissipation ofturbulence in the cold interstellar medium. in this paper, we analyze thespatial and kinematic properties of two subsets of hydrodynamical compressibleturbulence: the regions of largest negative divergence and those of largestvorticity and confront them with the observational constraints. we find thatthese two subsets fulfill the constraints equally well. a similar analysisshould be conducted in the future on simulations of mhd turbulence.

astro-ph;0103373	isocam observations of the rho ophiuchi cloud: luminosity and mass  functions of the pre-main sequence embedded cluster	we present the results of the first extensive mid-infrared (ir) imagingsurvey of the rho ophiuchi embedded cluster, performed with the isocam cameraon board the iso satellite. the main molecular cloud l1688, as well as l1689nand l1689s, have been completely surveyed for point sources at 6.7 and 14.3micron. a total of 425 sources are detected including 16 class i, 123 class ii,and 77 class iii young stellar objects (ysos). essentially all of the mid-irsources coincide with near-ir sources, but a large proportion of them arerecognized for the first time as ysos. our dual-wavelength survey allows us toidentify essentially all the ysos with ir excess in the embedded cluster downto fnu ~ 10 - 15 mjy. it more than doubles the known population of class iiysos and represents the most complete census to date of newly formed stars inthe rho ophiuchi central region. the stellar luminosity function of thecomplete sample of class ii ysos is derived with a good accuracy down to l=0.03 lsun. a modeling of this lumino- sity function, using available pre-mainsequence tracks and plausible star for- mation histories, allows us to derivethe mass distribution of the class ii ysos which arguably reflects the imf ofthe embedded cluster. we estimate that the imf in rho ophiuchi is welldescribed by a two-component power law with a low- mass index of -0.35+/-0.25,a high-mass index of -1.7 (to be compared with the salpeter value of -1.35),and a break occurring at m = 0.55+/-0.25 msun. this imf is flat with noevidence for a low-mass cutoff down to at least 0.06 msun.

astro-ph;0203192	isocam observations of the ursa major cirrus: evidence for large  abundance variations of small dust grains	we present mid-ir imaging observations of a high galactic latitude cirrusobtained with the iso camera isocam at 6" angular resolution. the observationswere done with two filters lw2 (5-8.5 microns) and lw3 (12-18 microns) thatmeasure respectively the aromatic carbon bands and the underlying continuumemission from small dust particles. three 0.05 square degree images sampleatomic and molecular sections in the ursa major cirrus. these images arecompared with hi, co and iras observations. in such a cloud transparent tostellar light (av &lt; 0.5) the mid-infrared to 100 microns and the mid-iremissivity per hydrogen are related to the abundance and the optical propertiesof small dust particles independently of any modelling of the penetration ofthe radiation. within the atomic section of the cloud, the comparison betweenisocam images and 21 cm interferometric data highlights an enhancement of themid-ir emitters abundance by a factor ~5 in an hi filament characterized by alarge transverse velocity gradient suggestive of rotation. furthermore, a dropin the abundance of the same mid-ir emitters is observed at the interfacebetween the atomic and molecular cirrus sections. we propose that theseabundance variations of the mid-ir emitters are related to the production ofsmall dust particles by grain shattering in energetic grain-grain collisionsgenerated by turbulent motions within the cirrus and inversely by theirdisappearance due to coagulation on large grains. at the atomic-molecularinterface we also observe a decrease of the lw2/lw3 ratio by a factor 2 in themolecular region. this could result from a modification of the dust sizedistribution or of the intrinsic optical properties of the small dustparticles.

astro-ph;0303139	submillimeter emission from water in the w3 region	we have mapped the submillimeter emission from the 1(10)-1(01) transition ofortho-water in the w3 star-forming region. a 5'x5' map of the w3 irs4 and w3irs5 region reveals strong water lines at half the positions in the map. therelative strength of the odin lines compared to previous observations by swassuggests that we are seeing water emission from an extended region. across muchof the map the lines are double-peaked, with an absorption feature at -39 km/s;however, some positions in the map show a single strong line at -43 km/s. weinterpret the double-peaked lines as arising from optically thick,self-absorbed water emission near the w3 irs5, while the narrower blue-shiftedlines originate in emission near w3 irs4. in this model, the unusual appearanceof the spectral lines across the map results from a coincidental agreement invelocity between the emission near w3 irs4 and the blue peak of the morecomplex lines near w3 irs5. the strength of the water lines near w3 irs4suggests we may be seeing water emission enhanced in a photon-dominated region.
