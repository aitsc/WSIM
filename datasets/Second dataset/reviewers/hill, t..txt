0909.1223	multi-generation massive star-formation in ngc3576	recent 1.2-mm continuum observations have shown the giant hii region ngc3576to be embedded in the centre of an extended filamentary dust-cloud. the bulk ofthe filament away from the hii region contains a number of clumps seen only at(sub-)millimetre wavelengths and which may host massive protostellar objects ata very early stage of evolution. we have used the australia telescope compactarray (atca) to image the cloud for the nh3(1,1), (2,2) and (4,4) transitions,22 ghz water masers, and 23 ghz continuum emission. we also utilised the 22-mmopra antenna to map the region for the molecular lines 13co (1-0), c18o (1-0),hco+ (1-0), h13co+ (1-0), cs (1-0) and n2h+ (1-0).the hii region is observed tobe expanding into the molecular cloud, sweeping up a clumpy shell of gas, whilethe central star cluster is dispersing the molecular gas to the east.temperatures are highest adjacent to the central hii region, indicating thatthe embedded cluster of young stars there is heating the gas. six new watermasers were detected in the arms of the filament, all associated with nh3emission peaks, confirming that star-formation has begun within these cores.core masses range from 5 to 516 solar masses and most appear to begravitationally bound. complementary results by andr\'e et al. (2008) implythat seven cores will go on to form massive stars between 15 and 50 solarmasses. the large scale velocity structure of the filament is smooth, but atleast one clump shows the signature of inward gas motions via asymmetries inthe nh3 (1,1) line profiles. the same clump exhibits an enhanced abundance ofn2h+, which coupled with an absence of co indicates depletion onto the dustgrain surface. the hii region at the heart of ngc3576 is potentially triggeringthe formation of massive stars in the bulk of the associated cloud.

0911.4479	physical characterisation of southern massive star-forming regions using  parkes nh$_3$ observations	we have undertaken a parkes ammonia spectral line study, in the lowest twoinversion transitions, of southern massive star formation regions, includingyoung massive candidate protostars, with the aim of characterising the earlieststages of massive star formation. 138 sources from the submillimetre continuumemission studies of hill et al., were found to have robust (1,1) detections,including two sources with two velocity components, and 102 in the (2,2)transition.  we determine the ammonia line properties of the sources: linewidth, fluxdensity, kinetic temperature, nh$_3$ column density and opacity, and revisitour sed modelling procedure to derive the mass for 52 of the sources. bycombining the continuum emission information with ammonia observations wesubstantially constrain the physical properties of the high-mass clumps. thereis clear complementarity between ammonia and continuum observations forderivations of physical parameters.  the mm-only class, identified in the continuum studies of hill et al.,display smaller sizes, mass and velocity dispersion and/or turbulence thanstar-forming clumps, suggesting a quiescent prestellar stage and/or theformation of less massive stars.

1005.1615	star formation triggered by the galactic hii region rcw 120: first  results from the herschel space observatory	by means of different physical mechanisms, the expansion of hii regions canpromote the formation of new stars of all masses. rcw 120 is a nearby galactichii region where triggered star formation occurs. this region is well-studied -there being a wealth of existing data - and is nearby. however, it issurrounded by dense regions for which far infrared data is essential to obtainan unbiased view of the star formation process and in particular to establishwhether very young protostars are present. we attempt to identify all youngstellar objects (ysos), especially those previously undetected at shorterwavelengths, to derive their physical properties and obtain insight into thestar formation history in this region. we use herschel-pacs and -spire imagesto determine the distribution of ysos observed in the field. we use a spectralenergy distribution fitting tool to derive the ysos physical properties.herschel-pacs and -spire images confirm the existence of a young source andallow us to determine its nature as a high-mass (8-10 msun) class 0 object(whose emission is dominated by a massive envelope) towards the massivecondensation 1 observed at (sub)-millimeter wavelengths. this source was notdetected at 24 micron and only barely seen in the mispgal 70 micron data.several other red sources are detected at herschel wavelengths and coincidewith the peaks of the millimeter condensations. sed fitting results for thebrightest herschel sources indicate that, apart from the massive class 0 thatforms in condensation 1, young low mass stars are forming around rcw 120. theysos observed on the borders of rcw 120 are younger than its ionizing star,which has an age of about 2.5 myr.

1005.3118	herschel observations of embedded protostellar clusters in the rosette  molecular cloud	the herschel ob young stellar objects survey (hobys) has observed the rosettemolecular cloud, providing an unprecedented view of its star formationactivity. these new far-infrared data reveal a population of compact youngstellar objects whose physical properties we aim to characterise. we compiled asample of protostars and their spectral energy distributions that covers thenear-infrared to submillimetre wavelength range. these were used to constrainkey properties in the protostellar evolution, bolometric luminosity, andenvelope mass and to build an evolutionary diagram. several clusters aredistinguished including the cloud centre, the embedded clusters in the vicinityof luminous infrared sources, and the interaction region. the analysedprotostellar population in rosette ranges from 0.1 to about 15 msun withluminosities between 1 and 150 lsun, which extends the evolutionary diagramfrom low-mass protostars into the high-mass regime. some sources lackcounterparts at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths, indicating extreme youth.the central cluster and the phelps &amp; lada 7 cluster appear less evolved thanthe remainder of the analysed protostellar population. for the central cluster,we find indications that about 25% of the protostars classified as class i fromnear- to mid-infrared data are actually candidate class 0 objects. as ashowcase for protostellar evolution, we analysed four protostars of low- tointermediate-mass in a single dense core, and they represent differentevolutionary stages from class 0 to class i. their mid- to far-infraredspectral slopes flatten towards the class i stage, and the 160 to 70um fluxratio is greatest for the presumed class 0 source. this shows that the herschelobservations characterise the earliest stages of protostellar evolution indetail.

1005.3924	the herschel view of star formation in the rosette molecular cloud under  the influence of ngc 2244	the rosette molecular cloud is promoted as the archetype of a triggeredstar-formation site. this is mainly due to its morphology, because the centralob cluster ngc 2244 has blown a circular-shaped cavity into the cloud and theexpanding hii-region now interacts with the cloud. studying the spatialdistribution of the different evolutionary states of all star-forming sites inrosette and investigating possible gradients of the dust temperature will helpto test the 'triggered star-formation' scenario in rosette. we use continuumdata obtained with the pacs (70 and 160 micron) and spire instruments (250,350, 500 micron) of the herschel telescope during the science demonstrationphase of hobys. three-color images of rosette impressively show how themolecular gas is heated by the radiative impact of the ngc 2244 cluster. aclear negative temperature gradient and a positive density gradient (runningfrom the hii-region/molecular cloud interface into the cloud) are detected.studying the spatial distribution of the most massive dense cores (size scale0.05 to 0.3 pc), we find an age-sequence (from more evolved to younger) withincreasing distance to the cluster ngc 2244. no clear gradient is found for theclump (size-scale up to 1 pc) distribution. the existence of temperature anddensity gradients and the observed age-sequence imply that star formation inrosette may indeed be influenced by the radiative impact of the central ngc2244 cluster. a more complete overview of the prestellar and protostellarpopulation in rosette is required to obtain a firmer result.

0709.3175	a deeply embedded young protoplanetary disk around l1489 irs observed by  the submillimeter array	circumstellar disks are expected to form early in the process that leads tothe formation of a young star, during the collapse of the dense molecular cloudcore. it is currently not well understood at what stage of the collapse thedisk is formed or how it subsequently evolves. we aim to identify whether anembedded keplerian protoplanetary disk resides in the l1489 irs system. giventhe amount of envelope material still present, such a disk would respresent avery young example of a protoplanetary disk. using the submillimeter array(sma) we have observed the hco$^+$ $j=$ 3--2 line with a resolution of about1$''$. at this resolution a protoplanetary disk with a radius of a few hundredaus should be detectable, if present. radiative transfer tools are used tomodel the emission from both continuum and line data. we find that these dataare consistent with theoretical models of a collapsing envelope and kepleriancircumstellar disk. models reproducing both the sed and the interferometriccontinuum observations reveal that the disk is inclined by 40$^\circ$ which issignificantly different to the surrounding envelope (74$^\circ$). thismisalignment of the angular momentum axes may be caused by a gradient withinthe angular momentum in the parental cloud or if l1489 irs is a binary systemrather than just a single star. in the latter case, future observations lookingfor variability at sub-arcsecond scales may be able to constrain thesedynamical variations directly. however, if stars form from turbulent cores, theaccreting material will not have a constant angular momentum axis (although theaverage is well defined and conserved) in which case it is more likely to havea misalignment of the angular momentum axes of the disk and the envelope.

1111.7021	herschel observations of a potential core forming clump: perseus b1-e	we present continuum observations of the perseus b1-e region from theherschel gould belt survey. these herschel data reveal a loose grouping ofsubstructures at 160 - 500 micron not seen in previous submillimetreobservations. we measure temperature and column density from these data andselect the nine densest and coolest substructures for follow-up spectral lineobservations with the green bank telescope. we find that the b1-e clump has amass of ~ 100 solar masses and appears to be gravitationally bound.furthermore, of the nine substructures examined here, one substructure (b1-e2)appears to be itself bound. the substructures are typically less than a jeanslength from their nearest neighbour and thus, may interact on a timescale of ~1 myr. we propose that b1-e may be forming a first generation of dense cores,which could provide important constraints on the initial conditions ofprestellar core formation. our results suggest that b1-e may be influenced by astrong, localized magnetic field, but further observations are still required.

1202.1413	the herschel view of the on-going star formation in the vela-c molecular  cloud	as part of the herschel guaranteed time key program 'hobys', we present thephotometric survey of the star forming region vela-c, one of the nearest sitesof low-to-high-mass star formation in the galactic plane. vela-c has beenobserved with pacs and spire in parallel mode between 70 um and 500 um over anarea of about 3 square degrees. a photometric catalogue has been extracted fromthe detections in each band, using a threshold of 5 sigma over the localbackground. out of this catalogue we have selected a robust sub-sample of 268sources, of which 75% are cloud clumps and 25% are cores. their spectral energydistributions (seds) have been fitted with a modified black body function. weclassify 48 sources as protostellar and 218 as starless. for two furthersources, we do not provide a secure classification, but suggest they are class0 protostars.  from sed fitting we have derived key physical parameters. protostellarsources are in general warmer and more compact than starless sources. boththese evidences can be ascribed to the presence of an internal source(s) ofmoderate heating, which also causes a temperature gradient and hence a morepeaked intensity distribution. moreover, the reduced dimensions of protostellarsources may indicate that they will not fragment further. a virial analysis ofthe starless sources gives an upper limit of 90% for the sourcesgravitationally bound and therefore prestellar. we fit a power law n(logm) propm^-1.1 to the linear portion of the mass distribution of prestellar sources.this is in between that typical of co clumps and those of cores in nearbystar-forming regions. we interpret this as a result of the inhomogeneity of oursample, which is composed of comparable fractions of clumps and cores.

1203.3403	the pipe nebula as seen with herschel: formation of filamentary  structures by large-scale compression ?	a growing body of evidence indicates that the formation of filaments ininterstellar clouds is a key component of the star formation process. in thispaper, we present new herschel pacs and spire observations of the b59 and stemregions in the pipe nebula complex, revealing a rich, organized network offilaments. the asymmetric column density profiles observed for severalfilaments, along with the bow-like edge of b59, indicates that the pipe nebulais being compressed from its western side, most likely by the winds from thenearby sco ob2 association. we suggest that this compressive flow hascontributed to the formation of some of the observed filamentary structures. inb59, the only region of the entire pipe complex showing star formationactivity, the same compressive flow has likely enhanced the initial columndensity of the clump, allowing it to become globally gravitationally unstable.although more speculative, we propose that gravity has also been responsiblefor shaping the converging filamentary pattern observed in b59. while thequestion of the relative impact of large-scale compression and gravity remainsopen in b59, large-scale compression appears to be a plausible mechanism forthe initial formation of filamentary structures in the rest of the complex

1203.5721	the dust properties of bubble hii regions as seen by herschel	because of their relatively simple morphology, "bubble" hii regions have beeninstrumental to our understanding of star formation triggered by hii regions.with the far-infrared (fir) spectral coverage of the herschel satellite, we canaccess the wavelengths where these regions emit the majority of their energythrough their dust emission. at herschel wavelengths 70 micron to 500 micron,the emission associated with hii regions is dominated by the cool dust in theirphotodissociation regions (pdrs). we find average dust temperatures of 26kalong the pdrs, with little variation between the hii regions in the sample,while local filaments and infrared dark clouds average 19k and 15krespectively. higher temperatures lead to higher values of the jeans mass,which may affect future star formation. the mass of the material in the pdr,collected through the expansion of the hii region, is between ~300 and ~10,000solar masses for the hii regions studied here. these masses are in roughagreement with the expected masses swept up during the expansion of the \hii\regions. approximately 20% of the total fir emission is from the direction ofthe bubble central regions. this suggests that we are detecting emission fromthe "near-side" and "far-side" pdrs along the line of sight and that bubblesare three-dimensional structures. we find only weak support for a relationshipbetween dust temperature and beta, of a form similar to that caused by noiseand calibration uncertainties alone.

1203.6307	globules and pillars seen in the [cii] 158 micron line with sofia	molecular globules and pillars are spectacular features, found only in theinterface region between a molecular cloud and an hii-region. impactingfar-ultraviolet (fuv) radiation creates photon dominated regions (pdrs) ontheir surfaces that can be traced by typical cooling lines. with the greatreceiver onboard sofia we mapped and spectrally resolved the [cii] 158 micronatomic fine-structure line and the highly excited 12co j=11-10 molecular linefrom three objects in cygnus x (a pillar, a globule, and a strong iras source).we focus here on the globule and compare our data with existing spitzer dataand recent herschel open-time pacs data. extended [cii] emission and morecompact co-emission was found in the globule. we ascribe this emission mainlyto an internal pdr, created by a possibly embedded star-cluster with at leastone early b-star. however, external pdr emission caused by the excitation bythe cyg ob2 association cannot be fully excluded. the velocity-resolved [cii]emission traces the emission of pdr surfaces, possible rotation of the globule,and high-velocity outflowing gas. the globule shows a velocity shift of ~2 km/swith respect to the expanding hii-region, which can be understood as theresidual turbulence of the molecular cloud from which the globule arose. thisscenario is compatible with recent numerical simulations that emphazise theeffect of turbulence. it is remarkable that an isolated globule shows thesestrong dynamical features traced by the [cii]-line, but it demands moreobservational studies to verify if there is indeed an embedded cluster ofb-stars.

1203.6472	cluster-formation in the rosette molecular cloud at the junctions of  filaments	for many years feedback processes generated by ob-stars in molecular clouds,including expanding ionization fronts, stellar winds, or uv-radiation, havebeen proposed to trigger subsequent star formation. however, hydrodynamicmodels including radiation and gravity show that uv-illumination has little orno impact on the global dynamical evolution of the cloud. the rosette molecularcloud, irradiated by the ngc2244 cluster, is a template region for triggeredstar-formation, and we investigated its spatial and density structure byapplying a curvelet analysis, a filament-tracing algorithm (disperse), andprobability density functions (pdfs) on herschel column density maps, obtainedwithin the hobys key program. the analysis reveals not only the filamentarystructure of the cloud but also that all known infrared clusters except one lieat junctions of filaments, as predicted by turbulence simulations. the pdfs ofsub-regions in the cloud show systematic differences. the two uv-exposedregions have a double-peaked pdf we interprete as caused by shock compression.the deviations of the pdf from the log-normal shape typically associated withlow- and high-mass star-forming regions at av~3-4m and 8-10m, respectively, arefound here within the very same cloud. this shows that there is no fundamentaldifference in the density structure of low- and high-mass star-forming regions.we conclude that star-formation in rosette - and probably in high-massstar-forming clouds in general - is not globally triggered by the impact ofuv-radiation. moreover, star formation takes place in filaments that arose fromthe primordial turbulent structure built up during the formation of the cloud.clusters form at filament mergers, but star formation can be locally induced inthe direct interaction zone between an expanding hii--region and the molecularcloud.

1301.3805	herschel observations of the w3 gmc: clues to the formation of clusters  of high-mass stars	the w3 gmc is a prime target for the study of the early stages of high-massstar formation. we have used herschel data from the hobys key program toproduce and analyze column density and temperature maps. two preliminarycatalogs were produced by extracting sources from the column density map andfrom herschel maps convolved to the 500 micron resolution. herschel revealsthat among the compact sources (fwhm&lt;0.45 pc), w3 east, w3 west, and w3 (oh)are the most massive and luminous and have the highest column density.considering the unique properties of w3 east and w3 west, the only clumps withon-going high-mass star formation, we suggest a 'convergent constructivefeedback' scenario to account for the formation of a cluster with decreasingage and increasing system/source mass toward the innermost regions. thisprocess, which relies on feedback by high-mass stars to ensure the availabilityof material during cluster formation, could also lead to the creation of anenvironment suitable for the formation of trapezium-like systems. in commonwith other scenarios proposed in other hobys studies, our results indicate thatan active/dynamic process aiding in the accumulation, compression, andconfinement of material is a critical feature of the high-mass star/clusterformation, distinguishing it from classical low-mass star formation. theenvironmental conditions and availability of triggers determine the form inwhich this process occurs, implying that high-mass star/cluster formation couldarise from a range of scenarios: from large scale convergence of turbulentflows, to convergent constructive feedback or mergers of filaments.

1304.4098	first results from the herschel gould belt survey in taurus	the whole of the taurus region (a total area of 52 sq. deg.) has beenobserved by the herschel spire and pacs instruments at wavelengths of 70, 160,250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m as part of the herschel gould belt survey. in thispaper we present the first results from the part of the taurus region thatincludes the barnard 18 and l1536 clouds. a new source-finding routine, thecardiff source-finding algorithm (csar), is introduced, which is loosely basedon clumpfind, but that also generates a structure tree, or dendrogram, whichcan be used to interpret hierarchical clump structure in a complex region.sources were extracted from the data using the hierarchical version of csar andplotted on a mass-size diagram. we found a hierarchy of objects with sizes inthe range 0.024-2.7 pc. previous studies showed that gravitationally boundprestellar cores and unbound starless clumps appeared in different places onthe mass-size diagram. however, it was unclear whether this was due to a lackof instrumental dynamic range or whether they were actually two distinctpopulations. the excellent sensitivity of herschel shows that our sources fillthe gap in the mass-size plane between starless and pre-stellar cores, andgives the first clear supporting observational evidence for the theory thatunbound clumps and (gravitationally bound) prestellar cores are all part of thesame population, and hence presumably part of the same evolutionary sequence(c.f. simpson et al. 2011).

1306.0547	low-velocity shocks traced by extended sio emission along the w43  ridges: witnessing the formation of young massive clusters	the formation of high-mass stars is tightly linked to that of their parentalclouds. we here focus on the high-density parts of w43, a molecular cloudundergoing an efficient event of formation. the cloud structure is studied witha column density image derived from herschel continuum maps obtained at 70,160, 250, 350, and 500 micron. we identify two high-column density filamentaryclouds, quoted as the w43-mm1 and w43-mm2 ridges, which both account for1.5x10^4 msun gas mass above 10^23 cm-2 and within areas of 5 and 14pc^2,respectively. we used the n_2h^+ 1--0 line to confirm that the w43-mm1 andw43-mm2 ridges are structures coherent in velocity and gravitationally bound,despite their large velocity dispersion and ~5 kms line widths. the mostintriguing result of the w43 large program is the bright wide-spread sio 2--1emission: 1--11 k kms$ stretching an area of ~28 pc^2. concentrated toward thew43-mm1 and w43-mm2 ridges and their immediate surroundings, it leads to atotal luminosity of l_sio 2-1 ~4 10^4 k kms kpc^2pc^2. we measured a steeprelation between the luminosity and velocity extent of the sio~2--1 lines andpropose to use it to distinguish the low-velocity shocks observed here from themore classical high-velocity ones associated with outflows of high-mass youngstellar objects. we used state-of-the-art shock models to demonstrate thatlow-velocity (&lt;10 kms^-1) shocks with a small amount (10%) of si atomsinitially in gas phase or in grain mantles can explain the observed sio columndensity in w43. the spatial and velocity overlaps between the ridgeshigh-density gas (n_h2&gt;10^4-10^5 cm^-3) and the shocked sio gas suggests thatridges could be forming via colliding flows driven by gravity and accompaniedby low-velocity shocks. this mechanism may be the initial conditions for theformation of young massive clusters in these ridges.

1308.6112	large scale iram 30m co-observations in the giant molecular cloud  complex w43	we aim to give a full description of the distribution and location of densemolecular clouds in the giant molecular cloud complex w43. it has previouslybeen identified as one of the most massive star-forming regions in our galaxy.to trace the moderately dense molecular clouds in the w43 region, we initiatedan iram 30m large program, named w43-hero, covering a large dynamic range ofscales (from 0.3 to 140 pc). we obtained on-the-fly-maps in 13co (2-1) and c18o(2-1) with a high spectral resolution of 0.1 km/s and a spatial resolution of12". these maps cover an area of ~1.5 square degrees and include the two mainclouds of w43, as well as the lower density gas surrounding them. a comparisonwith galactic models and previous distance calculations confirms the locationof w43 near the tangential point of the scutum arm at a distance from the sunof approximately 6 kpc. the resulting intensity cubes of the observed regionare separated into sub-cubes, centered on single clouds which are then analyzedin detail. the optical depth, excitation temperature, and h2 column densitymaps are derived out of the 13co and c18o data. these results are then comparedwith those derived from herschel dust maps. the mass of a typical cloud isseveral 10^4 solar masses while the total mass in the dense molecular gas (&gt;100cm^-3) in w43 is found to be about 1.9e6 solar masses. probability distributionfunctions obtained from column density maps derived from molecular line dataand herschel imaging show a log-normal distribution for low column densitiesand a power-law tail for high densities. a flatter slope for the molecular linedata pdf may imply that those selectively show the gravitationally collapsinggas.

1309.2332	two mass distributions in the l 1641 molecular clouds: the herschel  connection of dense cores and filaments in orion a	we present the herschel gould belt survey maps of the l1641 molecular cloudsin orion a. we extracted both the filaments and dense cores in the region. weidentified which of dense sources are proto- or pre-stellar, and studied theirassociation with the identified filaments. we find that although most (71%) ofthe pre-stellar sources are located on filaments there is still a significantfraction of sources not associated with such structures. we find that these twopopulations (on and off the identified filaments) have distinctly differentmass distributions. the mass distribution of the sources on the filaments isfound to peak at 4 solar masses and drives the shape of the cmf at highermasses, which we fit with a power law of the form dn/dlogm \proptom^{-1.4+/-0.4}. the mass distribution of the sources off the filaments, on theother hand, peaks at 0.8 solar masses and leads to a flattening of the cmf atmasses lower than ~4 solar masses. we postulate that this difference betweenthe mass distributions is due to the higher proportion of gas that is availablein the filaments, rather than in the diffuse cloud.

1311.3664	pillars and globules at the edges of h ii regions, confronting herschel  observations and numerical simulations	pillars and globules are present in many high-mass star-forming regions, suchas the eagle nebula (m16) and the rosette molecular cloud, and understandingtheir origin will help characterize triggered star formation. the formationmechanisms of these structures are still being debated. recent numericalsimulations have shown how pillars can arise from the collapse of the shell inon itself and how globules can be formed from the interplay of the turbulentmolecular cloud and the ionization from massive stars. the goal here is to testthis scenario through recent observations of two massive star-forming regions,m16 and rosette. the column density structure of the interface betweenmolecular clouds and h ii regions was characterized using column density mapsobtained from far-infrared imaging of the herschel hobys key programme. then,the disperse algorithm was used on these maps to detect the compressed layersaround the ionized gas and pillars in different evolutionary states. finally,their velocity structure was investigated using co data, and all observationalsignatures were tested against some distinct diagnostics established fromsimulations. the column density profiles have revealed the importance ofcompression at the edge of the ionized gas. the velocity properties of thestructures, i.e. pillars and globules, are very close to what we predict fromthe numerical simulations. we have identified a good candidate of a nascentpillar in the rosette molecular cloud that presents the velocity pattern of theshell collapsing on itself, induced by a high local curvature. globules have abulk velocity dispersion that indicates the importance of the initialturbulence in their formation, as proposed from numerical simulations.altogether, this study re-enforces the picture of pillar formation by shellcollapse and globule formation by the ionization of highly turbulent clouds.

1401.7333	ionization compression impact on dense gas distribution and star  formation, probability density functions around h ii regions as seen by  herschel	ionization feedback should impact the probability distribution function (pdf)of the column density around the ionized gas. we aim to quantify this effectand discuss its potential link to the core and initial mass function (cmf/imf).we used in a systematic way herschel column density maps of several regionsobserved within the hobys key program: m16, the rosette and vela c molecularcloud, and the rcw 120 h ii region. we fitted the column density pdfs of allclouds with two lognormal distributions, since they present a double-peak orenlarged shape in the pdf. our interpretation is that the lowest part of thecolumn density distribution describes the turbulent molecular gas while thesecond peak corresponds to a compression zone induced by the expansion of theionized gas into the turbulent molecular cloud. the condensations at the edgeof the ionized gas have a steep compressed radial profile, sometimesrecognizable in the flattening of the power-law tail. this could lead to anunambiguous criterion able to disentangle triggered from pre-existing starformation. in the context of the gravo-turbulent scenario for the origin of thecmf/imf, the double peaked/enlarged shape of the pdf may impact the formationof objects at both the low-mass and the high-mass end of the cmf/imf. inparticular a broader pdf is required by the gravo-turbulent scenario to fitproperly the imf with a reasonable initial mach number for the molecular cloud.since other physical processes (e.g. the equation of state and the variationsamong the core properties) have already been suggested to broaden the pdf, therelative importance of the different effects remains an open question.

1401.7871	properties of starless and prestellar cores in taurus revealed by  herschel spire/pacs imaging	the density and temperature structures of dense cores in the l1495 cloud ofthe taurus star-forming region are investigated using herschel spire and pacsimages in the 70 $\mu$m, 160 $\mu$m, 250 $\mu$m, 350 $\mu$m and 500 $\mu$mcontinuum bands. a sample consisting of 20 cores, selected using spectral andspatial criteria, is analysed using a new maximum likelihood technique,corefit, which takes full account of the instrumental point spread functions.we obtain central dust temperatures, $t_0$, in the range 6-12 k and find that,in the majority of cases, the radial density falloff at large radial distancesis consistent with the $r^{-2}$ variation expected for bonnor-ebert spheres.two of our cores exhibit a significantly steeper falloff, however, and sinceboth appear to be gravitationally unstable, such behaviour may haveimplications for collapse models. we find a strong negative correlation between$t_0$ and peak column density, as expected if the dust is heated predominantlyby the interstellar radiation field. at the temperatures we estimate for thecore centres, carbon-bearing molecules freeze out as ice mantles on dustgrains, and this behaviour is supported here by the lack of correspondencebetween our estimated core locations and the previously-published positions ofh$^{13}$co$^+$ peaks. on this basis, our observations suggest asublimation-zone radius typically $\sim 10^4$ au. comparison withpreviously-published n$_2$h$^+$ data at 8400 au resolution, however, shows noevidence for n$_2$h$^+$ depletion at that resolution.

1404.4404	the formation of the w43 complex: constraining its atomic-to-molecular  transition and searching for colliding clouds	numerical simulations have explored the possibility to form molecular cloudsthrough either a quasi-static, self-gravitating mechanism or the collision ofgas streams or lower-density clouds. they also quantitatively predict thedistribution of matter at the transition from atomic to molecular gases. we aimto observationally test these models by studying the environment of w43, amolecular cloud complex near the tip of the galactic long bar. usinggalaxy-wide hi and 12co surveys we searched for gas flowing toward the w43molecular cloud complex. we also estimated the hi and h2 mass surface densitiesto constrain the transition from atomic to molecular gas around and within w43.we found 3 cloud ensembles within the position-velocity diagrams of 12co and higases. they are separated by 20km/s along the line of sight and extend into the13co velocity structure of w43. since their velocity gradients are consistentwith free-fall, they could be nearby clouds attracted by, and streaming toward,the w43 10^7msun potential well. we show that the hi surface density,sigma_hi=45-85msun/pc2, does not reach any threshold level but increases whenentering the 130pc-wide molecular complex previously defined. this suggeststhat an equilibrium between h2 formation and photodissociation has not yet beenreached. the h2-to-hi ratio measured over the w43 region and its surroundings,r_h2~3.5, is high, indicating that most of the gas is already in molecular formin w43 and in structures several hundreds of parsecs downstream along thescutum-centaurus arm. the w43 molecular cloud complex may have formed, and infact may still be accreting mass from the agglomeration of clouds. already inthe molecular-dominated regime, most of these clouds are streaming from thescutum-centaurus arm. this is in clear disagreement with quasi-static andsteady-state models of molecular cloud formation.

1404.7142	class 0 protostars in the perseus molecular cloud: a correlation between  the youngest protostars and the dense gas distribution	we use pacs and spire continuum data at 160 um, 250 um, 350 um, and 500 umfrom the herschel gould belt survey to sample seven clumps in perseus: b1,b1-e, b5, ic348, l1448, l1455, and ngc1333. additionally, we identify andcharacterize the embedded class 0 protostars using detections of compactherschel sources at 70 um as well as archival spitzer catalogues and scuba 850um photometric data. we identify 28 candidate class 0 protostars, four of whichare newly discovered sources not identified with spitzer. we find that the starformation efficiency of clumps, as traced by class 0 protostars, correlatesstrongly with the flatness of their respective column density distributions athigh values. this correlation suggests that the fraction of high column densitymaterial in a clump reflects only its youngest protostellar population ratherthan its entire source population. we propose that feedback from either theformation or evolution of protostars changes the local density structure ofclumps.

1507.02055	herschel observations of the w3 gmc (ii): clues to the formation of  clusters of high-mass stars	the w3 gmc is a prime target for investigating the formation of high-massstars and clusters. this second study of w3 within the hobys key programprovides a comparative analysis of subfields within w3 to further constrain theprocesses leading to the observed structures and stellar population.probability density functions (pdfs) and cumulative mass distributions (cmds)were created from dust column density maps, quantified as extinction av. theshape of the pdf, typically represented with a lognormal function at low av"breaking" to a power-law tail at high av, is influenced by various processesincluding turbulence and self-gravity. the breaks can also be identified, oftenmore readily, in the cmds. the pdf break from lognormal (av(sf)= 6-10 mag)appears to shift to higher av by stellar feedback, so that high-massstar-forming regions tend to have higher pdf breaks. a second break at av &gt; 50mag traces structures formed or influenced by a dynamic process. because such aprocess has been suggested to drive high-mass star formation in w3, this secondbreak might then identify regions with potential for hosting high-massstars/clusters. stellar feedback appears to be a major mechanism driving thelocal evolution and state of regions within w3. a high initial star formationefficiency in a dense medium could result in a self-enhancing process, leadingto more compression and favourable star-formation conditions (e.g., collidingflows), a richer stellar content, and massive stars. this scenario would becompatible with the "convergent constructive feedback" model introduced in ourprevious herschel study.

1509.00318	the jcmt plane survey: early results from the l = 30 degree field	we present early results from the jcmt plane survey (jps), which has surveyedthe northern inner galactic plane between longitudes l=7 and l=63 degrees inthe 850-{\mu}m continuum with scuba-2, as part of the james clerk maxwelltelescope legacy survey programme. data from the l=30 degree survey region,which contains the massive star-forming regions w43 and g29.96, are analysedafter approximately 40% of the observations had been completed. thepixel-to-pixel noise is found to be 19 mjy/beam, after a smooth over the beamarea, and the projected equivalent noise levels in the final survey areexpected to be around 10 mjy/beam. an initial extraction of compact sources wasperformed using the fellwalker method resulting in the detection of 1029sources above a 5-{\sigma} surface-brightness threshold. the completenesslimits in these data are estimated to be around 0.2 jy/beam (peak flux density)and 0.8 jy (integrated flux density) and are therefore probably alreadydominated by source confusion in this relatively crowded section of the survey.the flux densities of extracted compact sources are consistent with those ofmatching detections in the shallower atlasgal survey. we analyse the virial andevolutionary state of the detected clumps in the w43 star-forming complex andfind that they appear younger than the galactic-plane average.

1509.01819	a possible link between the power spectrum of interstellar filaments and  the origin of the prestellar core mass function	two major features of the prestellar cmf are: 1) a broad peak below 1 msun,presumably corresponding to a mean gravitational fragmentation scale, and 2) acharacteristic power-law slope, very similar to the salpeter slope of thestellar initial mass function (imf) at the high-mass end. while recent herschelobservations have shown that the peak of the prestellar cmf is close to thethermal jeans mass in marginally supercritical filaments, the origin of thepower-law tail of the cmf/imf at the high-mass end is less clear. inutsuka(2001) proposed a theoretical scenario in which the origin of the power-lawtail can be understood as resulting from the growth of an initial spectrum ofdensity perturbations seeded along the long axis of filaments by interstellarturbulence. here, we report the statistical properties of the line-massfluctuations of filaments in nearby molecular clouds observed with herschelusing a 1-d power spectrum analysis. the observed filament power spectra werefitted by a power-law function $(p_{true}(s) \propto s^{\alpha})$ afterremoving the effect of beam convolution at small scales. a gaussian-likedistribution of power-spectrum slopes was found centered at -1.6, close to thatof the one-dimensional velocity power spectrum generated by subsonickolomogorov turbulence (-1.67). an empirical correlation, $p^{0.5}(s_0) \propto&lt;n_{\rm h_2}&gt;^{1.4 \pm 0.1} $, was also found between the amplitude of eachfilament power spectrum $p(s_0)$ and the mean column density along the filament$&lt;n_{\rm h_2}&gt;$. finally, the dispersion of line-mass fluctuations along eachfilament $\sigma_{\rm m_{line}}$ was found to scale with the physical length$l$ of the filament, roughly as $\sigma_{m_{line}} \propto l^{0.7}$. overall,our results are consistent with the suggestion that the bulk of the cmf/imfresults from the gravitational fragmentation of filaments.

1510.04360	sofia/forcast observations of warm dust in s106: a fragmented  environment	we present mid-ir (19 - 37 microns) imaging observations of s106 fromsofia/forcast, complemented with ir observations from spitzer/irac (3.6 - 8.0microns), irtf/mirlin (11.3 and 12.5 microns), and herschel/pacs (70 and 160microns). we use these observations, observations in the literature, andradiation transfer modeling to study the heating and composition of the warm (~100 k) dust in the region. the dust is heated radiatively by the source s106ir, with little contributions from grain-electron collisions and ly-alpharadiation. the dust luminosity is &gt;~ (9.02 +/- 1.01) x 10^4 l_sun, consistentwith heating by a mid- to late-type o star. we find a temperature gradient (~75 - 107 k) in the lobes, which is consistent with a dusty equatorial geometryaround s106 ir. furthermore, the sofia observations resolve several cool (~ 65- 70 k) lanes and pockets of warmer (~ 75 - 90 k) dust in the ionizationshadow, indicating that the environment is fragmented. we model the dust massas a composition of amorphous silicates, amorphous carbon, big grains, verysmall grains, and pahs. we present the relative abundances of each graincomponent for several locations in s106.

1510.09175	from forced collapse to h ii region expansion in mon r2: envelope  density structure and age determination with herschel	the surroundings of hii regions can have a profound influence on theirdevelopment, morphology, and evolution. this paper explores the effect of theenvironment on h ii regions in the monr2 molecular cloud. we aim to investigatethe density structure of envelopes surrounding hii regions and to determinetheir collapse and ionisation expansion ages. the mon r2 molecular cloud is anideal target since it hosts an h ii region association. column density andtemperature images derived from herschel data were used together to model thestructure of hii bubbles and their surrounding envelopes. the resultingobservational constraints were used to follow the development of the mon r2ionised regions with analytical calculations and numerical simulations. thefour hot bubbles associated with h ii regions are surrounded by dense, cold,and neutral gas envelopes. the radial density profiles are reminiscent of thoseof low-mass protostellar envelopes. the inner parts of envelopes of all fourhii regions could be free-falling because they display shallow densityprofiles. as for their outer parts, the two compact hii regions show a densityprofile, which is typical of the equilibrium structure of an isothermal sphere.in contrast, the central uchii region shows a steeper outer profile, that couldbe interpreted as material being forced to collapse. the size of the heatedbubbles, the spectral type of the irradiating stars, and the mean initialneutral gas density are used to estimate the ionisation expansion time, texp,0.1myr,for the dense uchii and compact hii regions and 0.35 myr for theextended hii region. the envelope transition radii between the shallow andsteeper density profiles are used to estimate the time elapsed since theformation of the first proto stellar embryo, tinf : 1myr, for theultra-compact, 1.5 / 3myr for the compact, and greater than 6myr for theextended hii regions.

astro-ph;0411727	star-forming protoclusters associated with methanol masers	we present a multiwavelength study of five methanol maser sites which are notdirectly associated with a strong ($&gt;100$ mjy) radio continuum source: g31.28+0.06, g 59.78+0.06, g 173.49+2.42 (s231, s233ir), g 188.95+0.89 (s252,afgl5180) and g 192.60-0.05 (s255ir). these radio-quiet methanol maser sitesare often interpreted as precursors of ultra-compact \ion{h}{ii} regions ormassive protostar sites. in this work, the environment of methanol masers isprobed from mid-ir to millimetre wavelengths at angular resolutions of$8''-34''$. spectral energy distribution (sed) diagrams for each site arepresented, together with mass and luminosity estimates. each radio-quiet masersite is always associated with a massive ($&gt;50$ m$_{\odot}$), deeply embedded($a_v&gt;40$ mag) and very luminous ($&gt;10^4$ s l$_{\odot}$) molecular clump, with$l_{total}{\propto}m_{gas}^{0.75}$. these physical properties characterisemassive star-forming clumps in earlier evolutionary phases than \ion{h}{ii}regions. in addition, colder gas clumps seen only at mm-wavelengths are alsofound near the methanol maser sites. these colderclumps may represent an evenearlier phase of massive star formation. these results suggest an evolutionarysequence for massive star formation from a cold clump, seen only at mmwavelengths, evolving to a hot molecular core with a two-component sed withpeaks at far-ir and mid-ir wavelengths, to an (ultra-compact) \ion{h}{ii}region. alternatively, the cold clumps might be clusters of low-mass ysos, information near the massive star-forming clusters. finally, the values of thedust grain emissivity index ($\beta$) range between 1.6 and 1.9.

astro-ph;0412053	high-mass star formation in the southern hemisphere sky	we report on a multi-wavelength (ir to cm) and multi-resolution (1 mas to 20arcsec) exploration of high-mass star formation regions in the galactic plane,at longitudes observable from the southern hemisphere. our source sample wasoriginally identified through methanol masers in the galactic plane, whichexclusively trace high-mass star-forming regions. (sub)millimetre continuum andmolecular line observations were carried out with sest/simba, jcmt/scuba andatnf/mopra mm-wave telescopes and have allowed us to identify massive ($&gt;20$m$_{\odot}$) and luminous ($&gt;10^3$ l$_{\odot}$) clumps in each star-formingregion. we have also constrained the sed with additional archival ir data, thephysical conditions ($t_{dust}$, $l$, $m$) and the chemical composition of eachmassive clump. several types of objects were characterised based on the$l_{submm}/l_{bol}$ ratio, the dust temperature and the molecular lineproperties, ranging from class 0-like yso clusters ($l_{sub}/l_{bol}\sim1%$,t=30 k) to hot molecular clumps ($l_{sub}/l_{bol}\sim0.1%$, $t=40-200$ k).preliminary high-angular resolution observations for a subset of the samplewith the atnf/atca at 3 mm, the vla at 15, 22 and 43 ghz and gemini in mir haverevealed that several (proto)stellar objects are embedded in the massiveclumps: massive protostars, hot cores and hyper-compact hii regions. we havethus identified protoclusters of massive ysos, which are the precursors of theob associations. this sample of southern hemisphere star-forming regions willbe extremely valuable for the scientific preparation of the alma and hsoobservations.

astro-ph;0506402	millimetre continuum observations of southern massive star formation  regions. i. simba observations of cold cores	we report the results of a sest 1.2 mm continuum emission survey towardregions previously identified as harbouring a methanol maser and/or an uc hiiregion, typically indicative of massive star formation. emission is detectedtoward all of the methanol maser and uc hii regions targeted, implying thatthese objescts are associated with cold, deeply embedded objects.  we have also identified a large number (253) of sources within the simbamaps, which are devoid of maser and radio continuum emission. these `mm-only'cores may be an entirely new class of source that represents an earlier stagein the evolution of massive stars, prior to the onset of methanol maseremission. or, they may harbour protoclusters, which do not contain any highmass stars (i.e. below the hii). alternatively, they may represent across-section of both, where the more massive mm-only cores are a precursor tothe methanol maser and the least massive mm-only cores will form intermediatemass stars.  analysis of the mm-only sources shows that they are less massive ({\= m} =0.9 x 10^{3} msun), and smaller ({\= r} = 0.4 pc) than sources with methanolmaser and/or radio continuum emission, which collectively have a mean mass of2.5 x 10^{3} msun and a mean radius of 0.7 pc.

astro-ph;0512589	a ch3cn and hco+ survey towards southern methanol masers associated with  star formation	we present the initial results of a 3-mm spectral line survey towards 83methanol maser selected massive star-forming regions. here we reportobservations of the j=5-4 and 6-5 rotational transitions of methyl cyanide(ch3cn) and the j=1-0 transition of hco+and h13co+.  ch3cn emission is detected in 58 sources (70 %) of our sample). we estimatethe temperature and column density for 37 of these using the rotational diagrammethod. the temperatures we derive range from 28-166 k, and are lower thanpreviously reported temperatures, derived from higher j transitions. we findthat ch3cn is brighter and more commonly detected towards ultra-compact hii(uchii) regions than towards isolated maser sources. detection of ch3cn towardsisolated maser sources strongly suggests that these objects are internallyheated and that ch3cn is excited prior to the uchii phase of massivestar-formation.  hco+ is detected towards 82 sources (99 % of our sample), many of whichexhibit asymmetric line profiles compared to h13co+. skewed profiles areindicative of inward or outward motions, however, we find approximately equalnumbers of red and blue-skewed profiles among all classes. column densities arederived from an analysis of the hco+ and h13co+ line profiles.  80 sources have mid-infrared counterparts: 68 seen in emission and 12 seen inabsorption as `dark clouds'. seven of the twelve dark clouds exhibit asymmetrichco+ profiles, six of which are skewed to the blue, indicating infallingmotions. ch3cn is also common in dark clouds, where it has a 90 % detectionrate.

astro-ph;0602294	millimetre continuum observations of southern massive star formation  regions ii. scuba observations of cold cores and the dust grain emissivity  index $\beta$	we report the results of a submillimetre continuum emission survey targetedtoward 78 star formation regions, 72 of which are devoid of methanol maser anduc hii regions, identified in the sest/simba millimetre continuum survey ofhill et al. (2005). at least 45 per cent of the latter sources, dubbed`mm-only', detected in this survey are also devoid of mid infrared msx,emission. the 450 and 850micron, continuum emission was mapped using thesubmillimetre common user bolometer array (scuba) instrument on the james clerkmaxwell telescope (jcmt). emission is detected toward 97 per cent of the 78sources targeted as well as towards 28 other simba sources lying in the scubafields.  we concatenate the results from four (sub)millimetre continuum surveys ofmassive star formation [walsh et al. (2003), hill et al. (2005), thompson etal. (2006); as well as this work], together with the galactic plane map ofpierce-price et al. (2000) in order to determine the dust grain emissivityindex $\beta$ for each of the sources in the simba source list. we examine thevalue of $\beta$ with respect to temperature, as well as for the source classesidentified in the simba survey, for variation of this index. our resultsindicate that $\beta$ is typically 2, which is consistent with previousdeterminations in the literature, but for a considerably larger sample thanprevious work.

0810.3158	spectral energy distribution modelling of southern candidate massive  protostars using the bayesian inference method	concatenating data from the millimetre regime to the infrared, we haveperformed spectral energy distribution modelling for 227 of the 405 millimetrecontinuum sources of hill et al. (2005) which are thought to contain youngmassive stars in the earliest stages of their formation. three main parametersare extracted from the fits: temperature, mass and luminosity. the methodemployed was bayesian inference, which allows a statistically probable range ofsuitable values for each parameter to be drawn for each individual protostellarcandidate. this is the first application of this method to massive starformation.  the cumulative distribution plots of the sed modelled parameters in this workindicate that collectively, the sources without methanol maser and/or radiocontinuum associations (mm-only cores) display similar characteristics to thoseof high mass star formation regions. attributing significance to the marginaldistinctions between the mm-only cores and the high-mass star formation samplewe draw hypotheses regarding the nature of the mm-only cores, including thepossibility that the population itself is comprised of different types ofsource, and discuss their role in the formation scenarios of massive starformation. in addition, we discuss the usefulness and limitations of sedmodelling and its application to the field. from this work, it is clear thatwithin the valid parameter ranges, seds utilising current far-infrared data cannot be used to determine the evolution of massive protostars or massive youngstellar objects.
