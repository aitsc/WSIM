0812.4211	towards millimeter vlbi	we discuss the present performance and the future perspectives of vlbi in the3 mm to 0.85 mm observing bands (so called mm-vlbi). the availability of newtelescopes and the recent technical development towards larger observingbandwidth and higher data-rates now allow to image with 3mm-vlbi hundreds ofsources with high dynamic range. as an example we show new images of the jetsof cygnus a. at 1.3 mm, pilot vlbi studies have proven detectability of thebrightest agn, and the existence of ultra-compact regions therein. in the nextfew years global vlbi imaging will be established also at 1.3 mm and 0.85 mmwavelength. with an angular resolution in the 10-20 micro-arcsecond range,future 1.3 mm- and 0.8 mm vlbi will be an extraordinarily powerful astronomicalobserving method, allowing to image the enigmatic `central engines' and thefoot-points of agn-jets in greater detail than ever possible before. asufficiently large number of telescopes is a prerequisite for global aperturesynthesis imaging. therefore a strong effort is needed to make more telescopesavailable for vlbi at short millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. in thiscontext, the further vlbi upgrade of both iram telescopes and the outfit of theapex telescope in chile, in preparation for later mm-/sub-mm vlbi with alma, isof high scientific importance. with a sufficiently large mm-vlbi network, themicro-arcsecond scale imaging of the post-newtonian emission zone around theevent horizon/ergosphere of nearby super-massive black holes (such as e.g. sgra*, m87, ...) should become possible within the next few years.

0905.2660	multi-frequency measurements of the nvss foreground sources in the  cosmic background imager fields. i. data release	we present the results of the flux density measurements at 4.85 ghz and 10.45ghz of a sample of 5998 nvss radio sources with the effelsberg 100 m telescope.the initial motivation was the need to identify the nvss radio sources thatcould potentially contribute significant contaminating flux in the frequencyrange at which the cosmic background imager experiment operated. an efficientway to achieve this challenging goal has been to compute the high frequencyflux density of those sources by extrapolating their radio spectrum. this isdetermined by the three-point spectral index measured on the basis of the nvssentry at 1.4 ghz and the measurements at 4.85 ghz and 10.45 ghz carried outwith the 100 m effelsberg telescope. these measurements are important since thetargeted sample probes the weak part of the flux density distribution, hencethe decision to make the data available. we present the table with flux densitymeasurements of 3434 sources that showed no confusion allowing reliablemeasurements, their detection rates, their spectral index distribution and aninterpretation which explains satisfactorily the observed uncertainties.

0909.4615	very long baseline array observations of the intraday variable source  j1128+592	short time-scale flux density variations of flat spectrum radio sources areoften explained by the scattering of radio waves in the turbulent, ionizedinterstellar matter of the milky way. one of the most convincing observationalarguments in favor of this is the annual modulation of the variabilitytime-scale caused by the earth orbital motion around the sun. j1128+592 is anidv source with a possible annual modulation in its variability time-scale. weobserved the source in 6 epochs with the vlba at 5, 8 and 15 ghz in totalintensity and polarization. the vlba observations revealed an east-westoriented core-jet structure. its position angle agrees with the angle ofanisotropy derived from the annual modulation model. no significant long-termstructural changes were observed with vlbi on mas-scales, however, compared toarchival data, the vlbi core size is expanded. this expansion offers a possibleexplanation to the observed decrease of the strength of idv. vlbi polarimetryrevealed significant changes in the electric vector position angle and rotationmeasure of the core and jet. part of the observed rm variability could beattributed to a scattering screen (37 pc distance), which covers the source(core and jet) and which may be responsible for the idv. superposition ofpolarized sub-components below the angular resolution limit may affect theobserved rm as well.

0910.4540	multiwavelength monitoring of the enigmatic narrow-line seyfert 1 pmn  j0948+0022 in march-july 2009	following the recent discovery of gamma rays from the radio-loud narrow-lineseyfert 1 galaxy pmn j0948+0022 (z=0.5846), we started a multiwavelengthcampaign from radio to gamma rays, which was carried out between the end ofmarch and the beginning of july 2009. the source displayed activity at all theobserved wavelengths: a general decreasing trend from optical to gamma-rayfrequencies was followed by an increase of radio emission after less than twomonths from the peak of the gamma-ray emission. the largest flux change, abouta factor of about 4, occurred in the x-ray band. the smallest was atultraviolet and near-infrared frequencies, where the rate of the detectedphotons dropped by a factor 1.6-1.9. at optical wavelengths, where the samplingrate was the highest, it was possible to observe day-scale variability, withflux variations up to a factor of about 3. the behavior of pmn j0948+0022observed in this campaign and the calculated power carried out by its jet inthe form of protons, electrons, radiation and magnetic field are quite similarto that of blazars, specifically of flat-spectrum radio quasars. these resultsconfirm the idea that radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies hostrelativistic jets with power similar to that of average blazars.

1101.2047	planck early results. xv. spectral energy distributions and radio  continuum spectra of northern extragalactic radio sources	spectral energy distributions (seds) and radio continuum spectra arepresented for a northern sample of 104 extragalactic radio sources, based onthe planck early release compact source catalogue (ercsc) and simultaneousmultifrequency data. the nine planck frequencies, from 30 to 857 ghz, arecomplemented by a set of simultaneous observations ranging from radio togamma-rays. this is the first extensive frequency coverage in the radio andmillimetre domains for an essentially complete sample of extragalactic radiosources, and it shows how the individual shocks, each in their own phase ofdevelopment, shape the radio spectra as they move in the relativistic jet. theseds presented in this paper were fitted with second and third degreepolynomials to estimate the frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse compton(ic) peaks, and the spectral indices of low and high frequency radio data,including the planck ercsc data, were calculated. sed modelling methods arediscussed, with an emphasis on proper, physical modelling of the synchrotronbump using multiplecomponents. planck ercsc data also suggest that the originalaccelerated electron energy spectrum could be much harder than commonlythought, with power-law index around 1.5 instead of the canonical 2.5. theimplications of this are discussed for the acceleration mechanisms effective inblazar shock. furthermore in many cases the planck data indicate that gamma-rayemission must originate in the same shocks that produce the radio emission.

1108.0152	high-frequency very long baseline interferometry studies of nrao 530	nrao 530 is an optically violent variable source and has been studied withmulti-epoch multi-frequency high-resolution vlbi observations. nrao 530 wasmonitored with the vlba at three frequencies (22, 43 and 86 ghz) on 10consecutive days in 2007 may during observations of the galactic center (sgra*). furthermore, analysis of archival data of nrao 530 at 15 ghz over the lastten years allows us to study its detailed jet kinematics. we identified thecompact component located at the southern-end of the jet as the vlbi core,consistent with previous studies. the 10-d monitoring data at the 3 highfrequencies were shown to produce high quality and self-consistent measurementsof the component positions, from which we detected for the first time atwo-dimensional frequency-dependent position shift. in addition, the repeatedmeasurements also permit us to investigate the interday flux density andstructure variability of nrao 530. we find that it is more variable for theinner jet components than those further out. we obtained apparent velocitiesfor eight jet components with $\beta_{\rm app} ranging from 2 to 26 c.accordingly, we estimated physical jet parameters with the minimum lorentzfactor of 14 and doppler factors in the range of 14--28 (component f). thechanges in the morphology of nrao 530 were related to the motion of separatejet components with the most pronounced changes occurring in the regions closeto the core. for nrao 530, we estimated a p.a. swing of $3^{\circ}.4$ per yearfor the entire inner jet (components d and e). the non-ballistic motion andchange of jet orientation makes this source another prominent example of ahelical and possibly `swinging' jet.

1108.1114	simultaneous planck, swift, and fermi observations of x-ray and  gamma-ray selected blazars	we present simultaneous planck, swift, fermi, and ground-based data for 105blazars belonging to three samples with flux limits in the soft x-ray, hardx-ray, and gamma-ray bands. our unique data set has allowed us to demonstratethat the selection method strongly influences the results, producing biasesthat cannot be ignored. almost all the bl lac objects have been detected byfermi-lat, whereas ~40% of the flat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) in theradio, soft x-ray, and hard x-ray selected samples are still below thegamma-ray detection limit even after integrating 27 months of fermi-lat data.the radio to sub-mm spectral slope of blazars is quite flat up to ~70ghz, abovewhich it steepens to &lt;\alpha&gt;~-0.65. bl lacs have significantly flatter spectrathan fsrqs at higher frequencies. the distribution of the rest-framesynchrotron peak frequency (\nups) in the sed of fsrqs is the same in all theblazar samples with &lt;\nups&gt;=10^13.1 hz, while the mean inverse-compton peakfrequency, &lt;\nupic&gt;, ranges from 10^21 to 10^22 hz. the distributions of \nupsand of \nupic of bl lacs are much broader and are shifted to higher energiesthan those of fsrqs and strongly depend on the selection method. the comptondominance of blazars ranges from ~0.2 to ~100, with only fsrqs reaching values&gt;3. its distribution is broad and depends strongly on the selection method,with gamma-ray selected blazars peaking at ~7 or more, and radio-selectedblazars at values ~1, thus implying that the assumption that the blazar poweris dominated by high-energy emission is a selection effect. simple ssc modelscannot explain the seds of most of the gamma-ray detected blazars in allsamples. the sed of the blazars that were not detected by fermi-lat may insteadbe consistent with ssc emission. our data challenge the correlation betweenbolometric luminosity and \nups predicted by the blazar sequence.

1202.4242	f-gamma: on the phenomenological classification of continuum radio  spectra variability patterns of fermi blazars	the f-gamma program is a coordinated effort to investigate the physics ofactive galactic nuclei (agns) via multi-frequency monitoring of fermi blazars.in the current study we show and discuss the evolution of broad-band radiospectra, which are measured at ten frequencies between 2.64 and 142 ghz usingthe effelsberg 100-m and the iram 30-m telescopes. it is shown that any of the78 sources studied can be classified in terms of their variabilitycharacteristics in merely 5 types of variability. it is argued that these canbe attributed to only two classes of variability mechanisms. the first fourtypes are dominated by spectral evolution and can be described by a simpletwo-component system composed of: (a) a steep quiescent spectral component froma large scale jet and (b) a time evolving flare component following the"shock-in-jet" evolutionary path. the fifth type is characterised by anachromatic change of the broad band spectrum, which could be attributed to adifferent mechanism, likely involving differential doppler boosting caused bygeometrical effects. here we present the classification, the assumed physicalscenario and the results of calculations that have been performed for thespectral evolution of flares.

1301.7087	radio to gamma-ray variability study of blazar s5 0716+714	we present the results of a series of radio, optical, x-ray and gamma-rayobservations of the bl lac object s50716+714 carried out between april 2007 andjanuary 2011. the multi-frequency observations were obtained using severalground and space based facilities. the intense optical monitoring of the sourcereveals faster repetitive variations superimposed on a long-term variabilitytrend at a time scale of ~350 days. episodes of fast variability recur on timescales of ~ 60-70 days. the intense and simultaneous activity at optical andgamma-ray frequencies favors the ssc mechanism for the production of thehigh-energy emission. two major low-peaking radio flares were observed duringthis high optical/gamma-ray activity period. the radio flares are characterizedby a rising and a decaying stage and are in agreement with the formation of ashock and its evolution. we found that the evolution of the radio flaresrequires a geometrical variation in addition to intrinsic variations of thesource. different estimates yield a robust and self-consistent lower limits of\delta &gt; 20 and equipartition magnetic field b_eq &gt; 0.36 g. causality argumentsconstrain the size of emission region \theta &lt; 0.004 mas. we found asignificant correlation between flux variations at radio frequencies with thoseat optical and gamma-rays. the optical/gev flux variations lead the radiovariability by ~65 days. the longer time delays between low-peaking radiooutbursts and optical flares imply that optical flares are the precursors ofradio ones. an orphan x-ray flare challenges the simple, one-zone emissionmodels, rendering them too simple. here we also describe the spectral energydistribution modeling of the source from simultaneous data taken throughdifferent activity periods.

0705.0298	j1128+592: a highly variable idv source	short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio quasars andblazars known as intraday variability (idv) can be explained in at least somesources as a propagation effect; the variations are interpreted asscintillation of radio waves in the turbulent interstellar medium of the milkyway. one of the most convincing observational arguments in favor of apropagation-induced variability scenario is the observed annual modulation inthe characteristic time scale of the variation due to the earth's orbitalmotion. so far there are only two sources known with a well-constrainedseasonal cycle. annual modulation has been proposed for a few other lesswell-documented objects. however, for some other idv sources source-intrinsicstructural variations which cause drastic changes in the variability time scalewere also suggested. j1128+592 is a recently discovered, highly variable idvsource. previous, densely time-sampled flux-density measurements with theeffelsberg 100-m radio telescope (germany) and the urumqi 25-m radio telescope(china), strongly indicate an annual modulation of the time scale. the mostrecent 4 observations in 2006/7, however, do not fit well to the annualmodulation model proposed before. in this paper, we investigate a possibleexplanation of this discrepancy.

1401.2151	two active states of the narrow-line gamma-ray-loud agn gb 1310+487	previously unremarkable, the extragalactic radio source gb 1310+487 showed agamma-ray flare on 2009 november 18, reaching a daily flux of ~10^-6photons/cm^2/s at energies e&gt;100 mev and becoming one of the brightest gevsources for about two weeks. its optical spectrum is not typical for a blazar,instead, it resembles those of narrow emission-line galaxies. we investigatechanges of the object's radio-to-gev spectral energy distribution (sed) duringand after the prominent gev flare with the aim to determine the nature of theobject and constrain the origin of the variable high-energy emission. the datacollected by the fermi and agile satellites at gamma-ray energies, swift atx-ray and ultraviolet, kanata, not, and keck telescopes at optical, oagh andwise at infrared, and iram 30m, ovro 40m, effelsberg 100m, ratan-600, and vlbaat radio, are analysed together to trace the sed evolution on timescales ofmonths. the gamma-ray/radio-loud narrow-line active galactic nucleus (agn) islocated at redshift z=0.638. it is shining through an unrelated foregroundgalaxy at z=0.500. the agn light is likely amplified by a factor of a fewbecause of gravitational lensing. the agn sed shows a two-humped structuretypical of blazars and gamma-ray-loud nlsy1 galaxies, with the high-energy(inverse-compton) emission dominating by more than an order of magnitude overthe low-energy (synchrotron) emission during gamma-ray flares. the differencebetween the two sed humps is smaller during the low-activity state. fermiobservations reveal a strong correlation between the gamma-ray flux andspectral index, with the hardest spectrum observed during the brightestgamma-ray state. if the gamma-ray flux is a mixture of synchrotron self-compton(ssc) and external compton (ec) emission, the observed gev spectral variabilitymay result from varying relative contributions of these two emissioncomponents.

1403.4170	detection of significant cm to sub-mm band radio and gamma-ray  correlated variability in fermi bright blazars	the exact location of the gamma-ray emitting region in blazars is stillcontroversial. in order to attack this problem we present first results of across-correlation analysis between radio (11 cm to 0.8 mm wavelength, f-gammaprogram) and gamma-ray (0.1-300 gev) ~ 3.5 year light curves of 54 fermi-brightblazars. we perform a source stacking analysis and estimate significances andchance correlations using mixed source correlations. our results reveal: (i)the first highly significant multi-band radio and gamma-ray correlations (radiolagging gamma rays) when averaging over the whole sample, (ii) average timedelays (source frame: 76+/-23 to 7+/-9 days), systematically decreasing from cmto mm/sub-mm bands with a frequency dependence tau_r,gamma (nu) ~ nu^-1, ingood agreement with jet opacity dominated by synchrotron self-absorption, (iii)a bulk gamma-ray production region typically located within/upstream of the 3mm core region (tau_3mm,gamma=12+/-8 days), (iv) mean distances between theregion of gamma-ray peak emission and the radio "tau=1 photosphere" decreasingfrom 9.8+/-3.0 pc (11 cm) to 0.9+/-1.1 pc (2 mm) and 1.4+/-0.8 pc (0.8 mm), (v)3 mm/gamma-ray correlations in 9 individual sources at a significance levelwhere one is expected by chance (probability: 4 times 10^-6), (vi) opacity and"time lag core shift" estimates for quasar 3c 454.3 providing a lower limit forthe distance of the bulk gamma-ray production region from the supermassiveblack hole (smbh) of ~ 0.8-1.6 pc, i.e. at the outer edge of the broad lineregion (blr) or beyond. a 3 mm tau=1 surface at ~ 2-3 pc from the jet-base(i.e. well outside the "canonical blr") finally suggests that blr materialextends to several pc distances from the smbh.

1504.03136	5 year global 3-mm vlbi survey of gamma-ray active blazars	the global mm-vlbi array (gmva) is a network of 14 3\,mm and 7\,mm capabletelescopes spanning europe and the united states, with planned extensions toasia. the array is capable of sensitive maps with angular resolution oftenexceeding 50\,$\mu$as. using the gmva, a large sample of prominent $\gamma$-rayblazars have been observed approximately 6 monthly from later 2008 until now.combining 3\,mm maps from the gmva with near-in-time 7\,mm maps from thevlba-bu-blazar program and 2\,cm maps from the mojave program, we determine thesub-pc morphology and high frequency spectral structure of $\gamma$-rayblazars. the magnetic field strength can be estimated at different locationsalong the jet under the assumption of equipartition between magnetic field andrelativistic particle energies. making assumptions on the jet magnetic fieldconfiguration (e.g. poloidal or toroidal), we can estimate the separation ofthe mm-wave "core" and the jet base, and estimate the strength of the magneticfield there. the results of this analysis show that on average, the magneticfield strength decreases with a power-law $b \propto r^{-n}$, $n=0.3 \pm 0.2$.this suggests that on average, the mm-wave "core" is $\sim 1-3$\,pc downstreamof the de-projected jet apex and that the magnetic field strength is of theorder $b_{\rm{apex}} \sim 5-20$\,kg, broadly consistent with the predictions ofmagnetic jet launching (e.g. via magnetically arrested disks (mad)).

1504.04141	intra-day variability observations and the vlbi structure analysis of  quasar s4 0917+624	the idv observations of s4 0917+624 were carried out monthly, from august2005 to january 2010, with the urumqi 25m radio telescope at 4.8 ghz. thequasar s4 0917+624 exhibits only very weak or no idv during our 4.5 yearobserving interval. prior to the year 2000, the source s4 0917+624 was one ofthe most prominent idv sources. our new data indicate that the previous strongidv has ceased. we analyzed the long-term vlbi structural variability usinggaussian model-fitting. from this we obtained the flux densities and thedeconvolved sizes of core and inner-jet components of the source. we studiedthe properties such as core fraction, angular size, spectral index, andbrightness temperature of vlbi core for s4 0917+624, as well as the time delaybetween 5 and 15 ghz variations, and compared them with the idv properties ofs4 0917+624. the source shows ejection of several jet components that aresuspected to have partially reduced the idv amplitude of s4 0917+624. however,during 2005-2006, the vlbi core size was comparable to the size before the year2000, but no strong idv was detected in the period, suggesting that thequenching effect due to source size changes may not be responsible for the lackof strong idv after the year 2000. the refractive scattering properties for thestrong idv phase of s4 0917+624 before the year 2000 are discussed. thedisappearance of strong idv in s4 0917+624 after the year 2000 is a mystery andcannot be explained via the quenching effect by changes in the observable vlbistructure. however, it may be caused by changes in the interstellar medium,i.e. by interstellar weather, which induces changes in the scintillationpattern on timescales of several years. further coordinated multi-frequencyobservations will be required to distinguish between the effect ofsource-intrinsic variability and changing properties of the interstellarmedium.

1509.06250	the stratified two-sided jet of cygnus a. acceleration and collimation	high-resolution very-long-baseline interferometry observations ofrelativistic jets are essential to constrain fundamental parameters of jetformation models. at a distance of 249 mpc, cygnus a is a unique target forsuch studies, being the only fanaroff-riley class ii radio galaxy for which adetailed sub-parsec scale imaging of the base of both jet and counter-jet canbe obtained. observing at millimeter wavelengths unveils those regions whichappear self-absorbed at longer wavelengths and enables an extremely sharp viewtowards the nucleus to be obtained. we performed 7 mm global vlbi observations,achieving ultra-high resolution imaging on scales down to 90 $\mu$as. thisresolution corresponds to a linear scale of only ${\sim}$400 schwarzschildradii (for $m_{\mathrm{bh}}=2.5 \times 10^9 m_{\odot}$). we studied thekinematic properties of the main emission features of the two-sided flow andprobed its transverse structure through a pixel-based analysis. we suggest thata fast and a slow layer, with different acceleration gradients, exist in theflow. the extension of the acceleration region is large (${\sim} 10^4r_{\mathrm{s}}$), indicating that the jet is magnetically-driven. the limbbrightening of both jet and counter-jet and their large opening angles($\phi_\mathrm{j}{\sim} 10^{\circ}$) strongly favor a spine-sheath structure.in the acceleration zone, the flow has a parabolic shape ($r\propto z^{0.55\pm0.07}$). the acceleration gradients and the collimation profile are consistentwith the expectations for a jet in "equilibrium'' (lyubarsky 2009), achieved inthe presence of a mild gradient of the external pressure ($p\propto z^{-k},k\leq2$).}

astro-ph;0102050	annual modulation in idv of quasar 0917+624 due to interstellar  scintillation	the quasar 0917+624 has been one of the best studied intraday variable (idv)radio sources. however, debate continues as to whether the underlying cause isintrinsic or extrinsic. much previous work has assumed the idv to be intrinsicand which implies an extraordinarily compact source for the radio emission; incontrast, an extrinsic variation due to interstellar scintillation (iss)implies a relatively larger source diameter, though at the smaller end of therange expected for relativistic jet models. kraus et al. (1999) reported amarked slowing of the idv at 6cm wavelength in september 1998, and suggested achange in the source was responsible. however, here we show that the slowing isconsistent with the annual modulation in scintillation time-scale expected foriss, under the assumption that the scattering medium moves with the localstandard of rest (lsr). the iss time scale is governed by the iss spatial scaledivided by the earth's velocity relative to the scattering plasma. it happensthat in the direction of 0917+624 the transverse velocity of the earth withrespect to the lsr varies widely with a deep minimum in the months of septemberto november. hence the slowing of the idv in september 1998 strongly suggeststhat iss, rather than intrinsic variation of the source is the dominant causeof the idv.

astro-ph;0207081	higher resolution vlbi imaging with fast frequency switching	millimetre-vlbi is an important tool in agn astrophysics, but it is limitedby short atmospheric coherence times and poor receiver and antenna performance.we demonstrate a new kind of phase referencing for the vlba, enabling us toincrease the sensitivity in mm-vlbi by an order of magnitude. if a source isobserved in short cycles between the target frequency, nu_t, and a referencefrequency, nu_ref, the nu_t data can be calibrated using scaled-up phasesolutions from self-calibration at nu_ref. we have demonstrated the phasetransfer on 3c 279, where we were able to make an 86 ghz image with 90 %coherence compared to self-calibration at nu_t. we have detected m81, ourscience target in this project, at 86 ghz using the same technique. we describescheduling strategy and data reduction. the main impacts of fast frequencyswitching are the ability to image some of the nearest, but relatively weak agncores with unprecedented high angular resolution and to phase-reference thenu_t data to the nu_ref core position, enabling the detection of possible coreshifts in jets due to optical depth effects. this ability will yield importantconstraints on jet properties and might be able to discriminate between the twocompeting emission models of blandford-konigl jets and sphericaladvection-dominated accretion flows (adafs) in low-luminosity agns.

0704.0871	the idv source j1128+5925, a new candidate for annual modulation?	short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio sources,known as intraday variability, can be explained in at least some sources by asource-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted asscintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ism of the milky way. oneof the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-inducedvariability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristicvariability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the earth. datafor the recently discovered and highly variable idv source j1128+5925 arepresented. we study the frequency and time dependence of the idv in thiscompact quasar. we measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the idvthroughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in thevariability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. we monitored theflux density variability of j1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and10.45ghz with the 100m effelsberg radio telescope of the mpifr and with the 25murumqi radio telescope. from ten observing sessions, we determine thevariability characteristics and time-scales. the observed pronounced changes ofthe variability time-scale of j1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropicannual modulation model. the observed frequency dependence of the variation isin good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. adoptinga simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequencydependence of the idv, we derive a lower limit to the distance of thescattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. thelatter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from vlbi.

astro-ph;0606049	testing the inverse-compton catastrophe scenario in the intra-day  variable blazar s5 0716+71: ii. a search for intra-day variability at  millimetre wavelengths with the iram 30 m telescope	we report on a densely time sampled polarimetric flux density monitoring ofthe bl lac object s5 0716+71 at 86 ghz and 229 ghz with the iram 30 m telescopewithin a coordinated broad spectral band campaign, centred around an integralobservation during november 10 to 16, 2003. our aim was to search forsignatures of inverse-compton "catastrophes". at 86 ghz, making use of a newcalibration strategy, we reach a relative rms accuracy of the flux densitymeasurements of 1.2%. at this frequency, s5 0716+71 showed no intra-dayvariability, but showed remarkable inter-day variability with a flux densityincrease of 34% during the first four observing days, which can not beexplained by source extrinsic causes. the 86 ghz linear polarization fractionof s5 0716+71 was unusually large 15.0+-1.8%. inter-day variability in linearpolarization at 86 ghz, with significance level &gt;~95%; sigma_p/&lt;p&gt;=15% andsigma_chi=6 deg., was also observed. from the emission variations at thesynchrotron turnover frequency (~86 ghz) we compute an apparent brightnesstemperature t_b,app&gt;1.4x10^14k at a redshift of 0.3, which exceeds by twoorders of magnitude the inverse-compton limit. a relativistic correction fort_b,app with a doppler factor delta &gt; 7.8 brings the observed brightnesstemperature down to the inverse compton limit. a more accurate lower limit ofdelta &gt; 14.0, is obtained from the comparison of the 86 ghz synchrotron fluxdensity and the upper limits for the synchrotron self-compton flux densityobtained from the integral observations. the relativistic beaming of theemission by this high doppler factor explains the non-detection of"catastrophic" inverse-compton avalanches by integral.

astro-ph;0610795	kinematic studies of the idv quasar 0917+624	for more than a decade from the late 1980s to the late 1990s, the intradayvariable (idv) quasar 0917+624 was known to be strongly variable with amplitudevariations of 10-20% within 0.8 to 1.6 days. during that period it showedfaster variability in the polarized flux and the polarization angle than intotal intensity. however, since 2000 the idv of this source has almost ceased,attaining a variability index of only less than a few percent. if interstellarscintillation was responsible for the idv in the past, one possible explanationfor the sudden change of the variability mode could be an intrinsic change inthe morphology of the source, such as an increase in the size of the structuralcomponents that are responsible for the scintillation. new jet componentsappearing at the jet base could lead to a temporarily larger size of thescintillating component when compared to the scattering size of theinterstellar medium, causing quenched scintillation. in order to test thisscenario, vlbi observations of 0917+624 from 1999 to 2005 have been analysed.here, we summarize first results and discuss them in the framework of thequenched scintillation model.

astro-ph;0611391	rapid and correlated variability of blazar s5 0716+71 from radio- to  sub-mm bands	the bl lac object s5 0716+71 was target of a coordinated and globalmulti-frequency campaign to search for rapid and correlated variability andsignatures of the inverse-compton catastrophe. here we present first resultsobtained from a combined analysis of the cm- to sub-mm observations over aperiod of seven days aiming at a detailed study of the intra- to inter-dayvariability characteristics and to obtain constraints on the variabilitybrightness temperatures and doppler factors comparing the radio data with thehigh energy emission recorded by integral. a more detailed description of thewhole cm- to sub-mm observations and our analysis/results will be presented ina forthcoming paper. our analysis reveals the source to be in a particularshort-term variability phase when compared to the past with a correlated &gt;~4day time scale amplitude increase of up to 35%, which is systematically morepronounced towards higher frequencies. the obtained frequency dependentvariability amplitudes and time lags contradict expectations from interstellarscintillation and strongly suggest a source intrinsic origin of this inter-dayvariability. a 7-day spectral evolution study indicate time-variablesynchrotron self-absorption and expansion of the emission region, consistentwith standard models. assuming relativistic boosting, our different estimatesof the doppler factor yield robust lower limits of d_var,ic &gt; 5-22 using theinverse-compton limit and d_var,eq &gt; 8-33 using the equipartition argument.although high, these values are in good agreement with doppler factors obtainedfrom recent vlbi studies and from the inverse-compton doppler factors d_ic &gt;14-16 derived with the x-ray emission seen by integral at 3-200 kev.

0809.2227	testing the inverse-compton catastrophe scenario in the intra-day  variable blazar s5 0716+71, iii. rapid and correlated flux density  variability from radio to sub-mm bands	the bl lac object s5 0716+71 was observed in a global multi-frequencycampaign to search for rapid and correlated flux density variability andsignatures of an inverse-compton (ic) catastrophe during the states of extremeapparent brightness temperatures. the observing campaign involved simultaneousmonitoring at radio to ir/optical wavelengths centered around a 500-ks integralpointing (november 10-17, 2003). we present the combined analysis and resultsof the cm- to sub-mm observations including a detailed study of the inter- tointra-day variability and spectral characteristics of 0716+714. we furtherconstrain the variability brightness temperatures (t_b) and doppler factors(delta) comparing the radio-bands with the hard x-ray emission (3-200 kev).0716+714 was in an exceptionally high state (outburst) and different (slower)phase of short-term variability. the flux density variability in the cm- tomm-bands is dominated by a correlated, ~4 day time scale amplitude increase ofup to ~35% systematically more pronounced towards shorter wavelengths. thiscontradicts expectations from standard interstellar scintillation (iss) andsuggests a source-intrinsic origin of the variability. the derived lower limitsto t_b exceed the 10^12 k ic-limit by up to 3-4 orders of magnitude. assumingrelativistic boosting, we obtain robust and self-consistent lower limits ofdelta &gt;= 5-33, in good agreement with delta_vlbi obtained from vlbi studies andthe ic-doppler factors delta_ic &gt; 14-16 obtained from the integral data. sincea strong contribution from iss can be excluded and a simultaneous iccatastrophe was not observed, we conclude that relativistic doppler boostingnaturally explains the apparent violation of the theoretical limits withinstandard synchrotron-self-compton (ssc) jet models of agn.

astro-ph;9503082	radio observations of the gamma-ray quasar 0528+134: superluminal motion  and an extreme scattering event	we report on multifrequency radio observations made with the effelsberg 100-mtelescope, the iram 30-m telescope and the green bank interferometer between1992 and 1994 of the $\gamma$-ray quasar 0528+134. we present a new vlbi basedmap of 0518+134 at 22 ghz with sub-mas angular resolution observed in november1992, which shows a one-sided core jet structure of $\sim$ 5 mas length. onecomponent, seen also previously at 8.4 ghz &amp; 22 ghz, shows apparentsuperluminal motion with $\beta_{app}$=4.4$\pm$1.7. in summer 1993 we observeda major outburst at all frequencies higher than a few ghz, which peaked a fewmonths after a strong outburst in high energy $\gamma$-rays and showed thecanonical time evolution of a cooling and/or expanding electron distribution.our data indicate that the outburst in the egret range originated very close tothe central object of the agn and that a remnant of this outburst moved furtheroutward in the jet until it became optically thin at radio frequencies after afew months. during the flare in july 1993 we observed with the effelsberg 100-mtelescope an unusually strong decrease of the flux density by about 50% at 4.75ghz and 10.55 ghz and slightly less at 2.695 ghz. this behaviour is also seenin the monitoring data at 2.25 ghz and 8.3 ghz taken with the green bankinterferometer (nrl-gbi). an extreme scattering event by a small dense plasmacloud in the line of sight is able to match the observed time lag in thelightcurves if we take into account the mas-structure of the source anddifferent spectra of the components on the basis of their brightness in thevlbi maps.

astro-ph;9505075	a helical model for the compact jet in 3c345	we present a simple model for the apparent superluminal motion along curvedtrajectories of features observed in the compact radio jet of the quasar 3c345.the model is inspired by the magneto-hydrodynamic approach of camenzind (1986),and assumes a conical geometry of the jet within about three milliarcseconds ofthe radio core. simultaneous conservation of three out of four physicalparameters is used to derive analytic solutions for the equation of motion ofthe idealized jet features. these are the jet's kinetic energy, angularmomentum, and momentum along the jet axis. conservation of angular momentum isrequired to fit the observed trajectories at distances larger than 3milliarcsec, in agreement with the kinematic predictions of camenzind's model.the best-fit model variant preserves angular momentum, kinetic energy, andopening angle, with an inclination of the jet axis to the line of sight 6.8degrees, an opening angle 0.95 degrees, and lorentz factors 5.8 and 4.6 forcomponents c4 and c5, respectively (h_o=100 km/(s mpc)). the model ignoresturbulent small-scale motion of the jet components, and it does not take intoaccount the overall bending of the jet beyond about 4 milliarcseconds,restricting it's applicability to the inner few milliarcseconds from the core.
