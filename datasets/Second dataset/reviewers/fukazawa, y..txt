0907.1468	x-ray diagnostics of thermal conditions of the hot plasmas in the  centaurus cluster	x-ray data of the centaurus cluster, obtained with {\it xmm-newton} for 45ksec, were analyzed. deprojected epic spectra from concentric thin shellregions were reproduced equally well by a single-phase plasma emission model,or by a two-phase model developed by {\it asca}, both incorporating cool(1.7--2.0 kev) and hot ($\sim 4$ kev) plasma temperatures. however, epicspectra with higher statistics, accumulated over 3-dimentional thick shellregions, were reproduced better by the two-phase model than by the singe-phaseone. therefore, hot and cool plasma phases are inferred to co-exist in thecluster core region within $\sim 70$ kpc. the iron and silicon abundances ofthe plasma were reconfirmed to increase significantly towards the center, whilethat of oxygen was consistent with being radially constant. the impliednon-solar abundance ratios explains away the previously reported excess x-rayabsorption from the central region. although an additional cool ($\sim 0.7$kev) emission was detected within $\sim 20$ kpc of the center, the rgs datagave tight upper limits on any emission with a tempeartures below $\sim 0.5$kev. these results are compiled into a magnetosphere model, which interpretsthe cool phase as confined within closed magnetic loops anchored to the cdgalaxy. when combined with so-called rosner-tucker-vaiana mechanism whichapplies to solar coronae, this model can potentially explain basic propertiesof the cool phase, including its temperature and thermal stability.

0908.4164	optical and near-infrared photometric observation during the  superoutburst of the wz sge-type dwarf nova, v455 andromedae	we report on optical and infrared photometric observations of a wz sge-typedwarf nova, v455 and during a superoutburst in 2007. these observations wereperformed with the kanata (v, j, and k_s bands) and mitsume (g', rc, and icbands) telescopes. our 6-band simultaneous observations allowed us toinvestigate the temporal variation of the temperature and the size of theemitting region associated with the superoutburst and short-term modulations,such as early and ordinary superhumps. a hot (&gt;11000 k) accretion disk suddenlydisappeared when the superoutburst finished, while blackbody emission, probablyfrom the disk, still remained dominant in the optical region with a moderatelyhigh temperature (~8000 k). this indicates that a substantial amount of gas wasstored in the disk even after the outburst. this remnant matter may be a signof an expected mass-reservoir which can trigger echo outbursts observed inseveral wz sge stars. the color variation associated with superhumps indicatesthat viscous heating in a superhump source stopped on the way to the superhumpmaximum, and a subsequent expansion of a low-temperature region made themaximum. the color variation of early superhumps was totally different fromthat of superhumps: the object was bluest at the early superhump minimum. thetemperature of the early superhump light source was lower than that of anunderlying component, indicating that the early superhump light source was avertically expanded low-temperature region at the outermost part of the disk.

0704.1603	measuring energy dependent polarization in soft gamma-rays using compton  scattering in pogolite	linear polarization in x- and gamma-rays is an important diagnostic of manyastrophysical sources, foremost giving information about their geometry,magnetic fields, and radiation mechanisms. however, very few x-ray polarizationmeasurements have been made, and then only mono-energetic detections, whilstseveral objects are assumed to have energy dependent polarization signatures.in this paper we investigate whether detection of energy dependent polarizationfrom cosmic sources is possible using the compton technique, in particular withthe proposed pogolite balloon-experiment, in the 25-100 kev range. we usegeant4 simulations of a pogolite model and input photon spectra based on cygnusx-1 and accreting magnetic pulsars (100 mcrab). effective observing times of 6and 35 hours were simulated, corresponding to a standard and a long durationflight respectively. both smooth and sharp energy variations of thepolarization are investigated and compared to constant polarization signalsusing chi-square statistics. we can reject constant polarization, with energy,for the cygnus x-1 spectrum (in the hard state), if the reflected component isassumed to be completely polarized, whereas the distinction cannot be made forweaker polarization. for the accreting pulsar, constant polarization can berejected in the case of polarization in a narrow energy band with at least 50%polarization, and similarly for a negative step distribution from 30% to 0%polarization.

0912.3664	photopolarimetric monitoring of 41 blazars in the optical and  near-infrared bands with the kanata telescope	blazars are a kind of active galactic nuclei (agn) in which a relativisticjet is considered to be directed along the line of sight. they arecharacterized by strong and rapid variability of the flux and highpolarization. we performed a monitoring of 41 blazars in the optical andnear-infrared regions from 2008 to 2009 using trispec attached to the "kanata"1.5-m telescope. in this paper, we report the correlation of the flux, colorand polarization using our data, and discuss universal features for blazars,which have not fully been established. three blazars (3c 454.3, qso 0454$-$234,and pks 1510$-$089) tended to be redder when they were brighter, only duringtheir faint states. this color behavior suggests that the contribution of athermal component is strong in the faint states for those objects. excludingthis "redder-when-brighter" phase, we found that 24 blazars tended to be bluerwhen they were brighter. this number corresponds to 83% among well-observedobjects which we observed for $&gt;10$ nights. thus, we conclude that the"bluer-when-brighter" trend is a universal feature for blazars. on the otherhand, the correlation of the flux and the polarization degree is relativelyweak; only 10 objects showed a significant positive correlation. we alsoinvestigated the luminosity-dependence of the color and polarization, and foundthat lower luminosity objects have smaller variation amplitudes both in theflux, color, and polarization degree.

1001.4531	observations of milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermi-lat  detector and constraints on dark matter models	we report on the observations of 14 dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermigamma-ray space telescope taken during the first 11 months of survey modeoperations. the fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particledark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (wimps). local group dwarfspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the colddark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches fordark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matterdominated environments. no significant gamma-ray emission was detected above100 mev from the candidate dwarf galaxies. we determine upper limits to thegamma-ray flux assuming both power-law spectra and representative spectra fromwimp annihilation. the resulting integral flux above 100 mev is constrained tobe at a level below around 10^-9 photons cm^-2 s^-1. using recent stellarkinematic data, the gamma-ray flux limits are combined with improveddeterminations of the dark matter density profile in 8 of the 14 candidatedwarfs to place limits on the pair annihilation cross-section of wimps inseveral widely studied extensions of the standard model. with the present data,we are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermalrelic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and wimps(neutralinos here) are dominantly produced non-thermally, e.g. in models wheresupersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation. the gamma-ray limitspresented here also constrain some wimp models proposed to explain the fermiand pamela e^+e^- data, including low-mass wino-like neutralinos and modelswith tev masses pair-annihilating into muon-antimuon pairs.

1002.4415	constraints on cosmological dark matter annihilation from the fermi-lat  isotropic diffuse gamma-ray measurement	the first published fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat) measurement of theisotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single powerlaw, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from darkmatter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 gev. we use the absolute sizeand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits onthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,charged leptons and monochromatic photons. predicted gamma-ray fluxes fromannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distributionof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structureformation we assess these uncertainties. we also quantify how the dark matterconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on theuniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. in reasonable background anddark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it ispossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons andpositrons measured by the fermi-lat and pamela experiments. derived limits alsostart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. inminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. for themonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only darkmatter scenarios with very strong signals.

1003.0317	suzaku observation of grs 1915+105: evolution of accretion disc  structure during limit-cycle oscillation	we present results from the suzaku observation of the microquasar grs1915+105 performed during the 2005 october multiwavelength campaign. the datainclude both stable state (class \chi) and limit-cycle oscillation (class\theta). correct interstellar absorption as well as effects of dust scatteringare fully taken into account in the spectral analysis. the energy spectra inthe 2-120 kev band in both states are all dominated by strong comptonization ofdisk photons by an optically thick (\tau ~7-10) and low temperature (t_e ~2-3kev) hybrid plasmas containing non-thermal electrons produced with 10-60% ofthe total power input. absorption lines of highly ionized fe ions detectedduring the oscillation indicate that a strong disk wind is developed. theionization stage of the wind correlates with the x-ray flux, supporting thephotoionization origin. the iron-k emission line shows a strong variabilityduring the oscillation; the reflection is strongest during the dip butdisappears during the flare. we interpret this as evidence for "self-shielding"that the comptonizing corona becomes geometrically thick in the flare phase,preventing photons from irradiating the outer disk. the low-temperature andhigh luminosity disk emission suggests that the disk structure is similar tothat in the very high state of canonical black hole binaries. the spectralvariability during the oscillation is explained by the change of the diskgeometry and of the physical parameters of comptonizing corona, particularlythe fractional power supplied to the acceleration of non-thermal particles.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1202.0741	inverse compton x-ray emission from supernovae with compact progenitors:  application to sn2011fe	we present a generalized analytic formalism for the inverse compton x-rayemission from hydrogen-poor supernovae and apply this framework to sn2011feusing swift-xrt, uvot and chandra observations. we characterize the opticalproperties of sn2011fe in the swift bands and find them to be broadlyconsistent with a "normal" sn ia, however, no x-ray source is detected byeither xrt or chandra. we constrain the progenitor system mass loss rate to belower than 2x10^-9 m_sun/yr (3sigma c.l.) for wind velocity v_w=100 km/s. ourresult rules out symbiotic binary progenitors for sn2011fe and argues againstroche-lobe overflowing subgiants and main sequence secondary stars if &gt;1% ofthe transferred mass is lost at the lagrangian points. regardless of thedensity profile, the x-ray non-detections are suggestive of a clean environment(particle density &lt; 150 cm-3) for (2x10^15&lt;r&lt;5x10^16) cm around the progenitorsite. this is either consistent with the bulk of material being confined withinthe binary system or with a significant delay between mass loss and supernovaexplosion. we furthermore combine x-ray and radio limits from chomiuk et al.2012 to constrain the post shock energy density in magnetic fields. finally, wesearched for the shock breakout pulse using gamma-ray observations from theinterplanetary network and find no compelling evidence for asupernova-associated burst. based on the compact radius of the progenitor starwe estimate that the shock break out pulse was likely not detectable by currentsatellites.

1205.6474	constraints on the galactic halo dark matter from fermi-lat diffuse  measurements	we have performed an analysis of the diffuse gamma-ray emission with thefermi large area telescope in the milky way halo region searching for a signalfrom dark matter annihilation or decay. in the absence of a robust dark mattersignal, constraints are presented. we consider both gamma rays produceddirectly in the dark matter annihilation/decay and produced by inverse comptonscattering of the e+e- produced in the annihilation/decay. conservative limitsare derived requiring that the dark matter signal does not exceed the observeddiffuse gamma-ray emission. a second set of more stringent limits is derivedbased on modeling the foreground astrophysical diffuse emission using thegalprop code. uncertainties in the height of the diffusive cosmic-ray halo, thedistribution of the cosmic-ray sources in the galaxy, the index of theinjection cosmic-ray electron spectrum and the column density of theinterstellar gas are taken into account using a profile likelihood formalism,while the parameters governing the cosmic-ray propagation have been derivedfrom fits to local cosmic-ray data. the resulting limits impact the range ofparticle masses over which dark matter thermal production in the early universeis possible, and challenge the interpretation of the pamela/fermi-lat cosmicray anomalies as annihilation of dark matter.

1206.0745	the structure and emission model of the relativistic jet in the quasar  3c 279 inferred from radio to high-energy gamma-ray observations in 2008-2010	we present time-resolved broad-band observations of the quasar 3c 279obtained from multi-wavelength campaigns conducted during the first two yearsof the fermi gamma-ray space telescope mission. while investigating thepreviously reported gamma-ray/optical flare accompanied by a change in opticalpolarization, we found that the optical emission appears delayed with respectto the gamma-ray emission by about 10 days. x-ray observations reveal a pair of`isolated' flares separated by ~90 days, with only weak gamma-ray/opticalcounterparts. the spectral structure measured by spitzer reveals a synchrotroncomponent peaking in the mid-infrared band with a sharp break at thefar-infrared band during the gamma-ray flare, while the peak appears in themm/sub-mm band in the low state. selected spectral energy distributions arefitted with leptonic models including comptonization of external radiationproduced in a dusty torus or the broad-line region. adopting the interpretationof the polarization swing involving propagation of the emitting region along acurved trajectory, we can explain the evolution of the broad-band spectraduring the gamma-ray flaring event by a shift of its location from ~ 1 pc to ~4 pc from the central black hole. on the other hand, if the gamma-ray flare isgenerated instead at sub-pc distance from the central black hole, thefar-infrared break can be explained by synchrotron self-absorption. we alsomodel the low spectral state, dominated by the mm/sub-mm peaking synchrotroncomponent, and suggest that the corresponding inverse-compton componentexplains the steady x-ray emission.

1206.1346	gev observations of star-forming galaxies with \textit{fermi} lat	recent detections of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 by gamma-raytelescopes suggest that galaxies rapidly forming massive stars are moreluminous at gamma-ray energies compared to their quiescent relatives. buildingupon those results, we examine a sample of 69 dwarf, spiral, and luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies at photon energies 0.1-100 gev using 3 years ofdata collected by the large area telescope (lat) on the \textit{fermi gamma-rayspace telescope} (\textit{fermi}). measured fluxes from significantly detectedsources and flux upper limits for the remaining galaxies are used to explorethe physics of cosmic rays in galaxies. we find further evidence forquasi-linear scaling relations between gamma-ray luminosity and both radiocontinuum luminosity and total infrared luminosity which apply both toquiescent galaxies of the local group and low-redshift starburst galaxies(conservative $p$-values $\lesssim0.05$ accounting for statistical andsystematic uncertainties). the normalizations of these scaling relationscorrespond to luminosity ratios of $\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{1.4 \rm{ghz}})= 1.7 \pm 0.1_{\rm (statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ and$\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{8-1000 \mu\rm{m}}) = -4.3 \pm 0.1_{\rm(statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ for a galaxy with a star formationrate of 1 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a chabrier initial mass function.using the relationship between infrared luminosity and gamma-ray luminosity,the collective intensity of unresolved star-forming galaxies at redshifts$0&lt;z&lt;2.5$ above 0.1 gev is estimated to be 0.4-2.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ phcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (4-23% of the intensity of the isotropic diffusecomponent measured with the lat). we anticipate that $\sim10$ galaxies could bedetected by their cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission during a 10-year\textit{fermi} mission.

0711.2831	discovery of a wz sge-type dwarf nova, sdss j102146.44+234926.3:  unprecedented infrared activity during a rebrightening phase	several su uma-type dwarf novae, in particular, wz sge-type stars tend toexhibit rebrightenings after superoutbursts. the rebrightening phenomenon isproblematic for the disk instability theory of dwarf novae since it requires alarge amount of remnant matter in the disk even after superoutbursts. here, wereport our optical and infrared observations during the first-ever outburst ofa new dwarf nova, sdss j102146.44+234926.3. during the outburst, we detectedsuperhumps with a period of 0.056281 +/- 0.000015 d, which is typical forsuperhump periods in wz sge stars. in conjunction with the appearance of along-lived rebrightening, we conclude that the object is a new member of wz sgestars. our observations, furthermore, revealed infrared behaviors for the firsttime in the rebrightening phase of wz sge stars. we discovered prominentinfrared superhumps. we calculate the color temperature of the infraredsuperhump source to be 4600-6400 k. these temperatures are too low to beexplained with a fully-ionized disk appearing during dwarf nova outbursts. wealso found a ks-band excess over the hot disk component. these unprecedentedinfrared activities provide evidence for the presence of mass reservoir at theoutermost part of the accretion disk. we propose that a moderately highmass-accretion rate at this infrared active region leads to the long-livedrebrightening observed in sdss j102146.44+234926.3.

1210.4237	giant lobes of centaurus a radio galaxy observed with the suzaku x-ray  satellite	[abridged] we report on suzaku observations of selected regions within thesouthern giant lobe of the radio galaxy centaurus a. we focus on distinct x-rayfeatures likely associated with fine radio structure of the lobe. we find thatthe spectral properties of the detected x-ray features are equally consistentwith thermal emission from hot gas, or with a power-law radiation continuum.however, the plasma parameters implied by these different models favor asynchrotron origin for the analyzed x-ray spots, indicating that a veryefficient acceleration of electrons is taking place within the giant structureof centaurus a, albeit only in isolated and compact regions. we also present adetailed analysis of the diffuse x-ray emission, resulting in a tentativedetection of a soft excess component best fitted by a thermal model with atemperature of 0.5 kev. the exact origin of the observed excess remainsuncertain, although energetic considerations point to thermal gas filling thebulk of the volume of the lobe and mixed with the non-thermal plasma. thecorresponding pressure of the thermal gas in such a case appears to be inalmost exact equipartition with the pressure provided by the radio-emittingelectrons and the magnetic field. although tentative, our findings potentiallyimply that the structure of the extended lobes in active galaxies is likely tobe highly inhomogeneous, with magnetic reconnection processes continuouslyconverting magnetic energy to internal energy of the plasma particles, leadingto spatial and temporal variations in the plasma parameters around theequilibrium condition.

1401.2151	two active states of the narrow-line gamma-ray-loud agn gb 1310+487	previously unremarkable, the extragalactic radio source gb 1310+487 showed agamma-ray flare on 2009 november 18, reaching a daily flux of ~10^-6photons/cm^2/s at energies e&gt;100 mev and becoming one of the brightest gevsources for about two weeks. its optical spectrum is not typical for a blazar,instead, it resembles those of narrow emission-line galaxies. we investigatechanges of the object's radio-to-gev spectral energy distribution (sed) duringand after the prominent gev flare with the aim to determine the nature of theobject and constrain the origin of the variable high-energy emission. the datacollected by the fermi and agile satellites at gamma-ray energies, swift atx-ray and ultraviolet, kanata, not, and keck telescopes at optical, oagh andwise at infrared, and iram 30m, ovro 40m, effelsberg 100m, ratan-600, and vlbaat radio, are analysed together to trace the sed evolution on timescales ofmonths. the gamma-ray/radio-loud narrow-line active galactic nucleus (agn) islocated at redshift z=0.638. it is shining through an unrelated foregroundgalaxy at z=0.500. the agn light is likely amplified by a factor of a fewbecause of gravitational lensing. the agn sed shows a two-humped structuretypical of blazars and gamma-ray-loud nlsy1 galaxies, with the high-energy(inverse-compton) emission dominating by more than an order of magnitude overthe low-energy (synchrotron) emission during gamma-ray flares. the differencebetween the two sed humps is smaller during the low-activity state. fermiobservations reveal a strong correlation between the gamma-ray flux andspectral index, with the hardest spectrum observed during the brightestgamma-ray state. if the gamma-ray flux is a mixture of synchrotron self-compton(ssc) and external compton (ec) emission, the observed gev spectral variabilitymay result from varying relative contributions of these two emissioncomponents.

1402.6336	a missing-link in the supernova-grb connection: the case of sn 2012ap	gamma ray bursts (grbs) are characterized by ultra-relativistic outflows,while supernovae are generally characterized by non-relativistic ejecta. grbafterglows decelerate rapidly usually within days, because their low-massejecta rapidly sweep up a comparatively larger mass of circumstellar material.however supernovae, with heavy ejecta, can be in nearly free expansion forcenturies. supernovae were thought to have non-relativistic outflows except forfew relativistic ones accompanied by grbs. this clear division was blurred bysn 2009bb, the first supernova with a relativistic outflow without an observedgrb. yet the ejecta from sn 2009bb was baryon loaded, and in nearly-freeexpansion for a year, unlike grbs. we report the first supernova discoveredwithout a grb, but with rapidly decelerating mildly relativistic ejecta, sn2012ap. we discovered a bright and rapidly evolving radio counterpart driven bythe circumstellar interaction of the relativistic ejecta. however, we did notfind any coincident grb with an isotropic fluence of more than a sixth of thefluence from grb 980425. this shows for the first time that central engines intype ic supernovae, even without an observed grb, can produce both relativisticand rapidly decelerating outflows like grbs.

1406.3451	universal profiles of the intracluster medium from suzaku x-ray and  subaru weak lensing obesrvations	we conduct a joint x-ray and weak-lensing study of four relaxed galaxyclusters (hydra a, a478, a1689 and a1835) observed by both suzaku and subaruout to virial radii, with an aim to understand recently-discovered unexpectedfeature of the icm in cluster outskirts. we show that the averagehydrostatic-to-lensing total mass ratio for the four clusters decreases from\sim 70% to \sim 40% as the overdensity contrast decreases from 500 to thevirial value.the average gas mass fraction from lensing total mass estimatesincreases with cluster radius and agrees with the cosmic mean baryon fractionwithin the virial radius, whereas the x-ray-based gas fraction considerablyexceeds the cosmic values due to underestimation of the hydrostatic mass. wealso develop a new advanced method for determining normalized cluster radialprofiles for multiple x-ray observables by simultaneously taking into accountboth their radial dependence and multivariate scaling relations withweak-lensing masses. although the four clusters span a range of halo mass,concentration, x-ray luminosity and redshift, we find that the gas entropy,pressure, temperature and density profiles are all remarkably self-similar whenscaled with the lensing m_200 mass and r_200 radius.the entropy monotonicallyincreases out to \sim 0.5r_200 following the accretion shock heating modelk(r)\propto r^1.1, and flattens at \simgt 0.5r_200.the universality of thescaled entropy profiles indicates that the thermalization mechanism over theentire cluster region (&gt;0.1r_200) is controlled by gravitation in a common toall clusters, although the heating efficiency in the outskirts needs to bemodified from the standard law.the bivariate scaling functions of the gasdensity and temperature reveal that the flattening of the outskirts entropyprofile is caused by the steepening of the temperature, rather than theflattening of the gas density.

1410.3696	the spectrum of isotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission between 100 mev and  820 gev	the {\gamma}-ray sky can be decomposed into individually detected sources,diffuse emission attributed to the interactions of galactic cosmic rays withgas and radiation fields, and a residual all-sky emission component commonlycalled the isotropic diffuse {\gamma}-ray background (igrb). the igrb comprisesall extragalactic emissions too faint or too diffuse to be resolved in a givensurvey, as well as any residual galactic foregrounds that are approximatelyisotropic. the first igrb measurement with the large area telescope (lat) onboard the fermi gamma-ray space telescope (fermi) used 10 months of sky-surveydata and considered an energy range between 200 mev and 100 gev. improvementsin event selection and characterization of cosmic-ray backgrounds, betterunderstanding of the diffuse galactic emission, and a longer data accumulationof 50 months, allow for a refinement and extension of the igrb measurement withthe lat, now covering the energy range from 100 mev to 820 gev. the igrbspectrum shows a significant high-energy cutoff feature, and can be welldescribed over nearly four decades in energy by a power law with exponentialcutoff having a spectral index of $2.32\pm0.02$ and a break energy of$(279\pm52)$ gev using our baseline diffuse galactic emission model. the totalintensity attributed to the igrb is $(7.2\pm0.6) \times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ above 100 mev, with an additional $+15$%/$-30$% systematicuncertainty due to the galactic diffuse foregrounds.

1411.4915	gamma-ray flaring activity from the gravitationally lensed blazar pks  1830-211 observed by fermi lat	the large area telescope (lat) on board the fermi gamma-ray space telescoperoutinely detects the highly dust-absorbed, reddened, and mev-peaked flatspectrum radio quasar pks 1830-211 (z=2.507). its apparent isotropic gamma-rayluminosity (e&gt;100 mev) averaged over $\sim$ 3 years of observations and peakingon 2010 october 14/15 at 2.9 x 10^{50} erg s^{-1}, makes it among the brightesthigh-redshift fermi blazars. no published model with a single lens can accountfor all of the observed characteristics of this complex system. based on radioobservations, one expects time delayed variability to follow about 25 daysafter a primary flare, with flux about a factor 1.5 less. two large gamma-rayflares of pks 1830-211 have been detected by the lat in the considered periodand no substantial evidence for such a delayed activity was found. this allowsus to place a lower limit of about 6 on the gamma rays flux ratio between thetwo lensed images. swift xrt observations from a dedicated target ofopportunity program indicate a hard spectrum and with no significantcorrelation of x-ray flux with the gamma-ray variability. the spectral energydistribution can be modeled with inverse compton scattering of thermal photonsfrom the dusty torus. the implications of the lat data in terms of variability,the lack of evident delayed flare events, and different radio and gamma-rayflux ratios are discussed. microlensing effects, absorption, size and locationof the emitting regions, the complex mass distribution of the system, anenergy-dependent inner structure of the source, and flux suppression by thelens galaxy for one image path may be considered as hypotheses forunderstanding our results.

1412.1171	astro-h white paper - agn winds	in this white paper we describe the prospects for astro-h for the study ofoutflows from active galactic nuclei. the most important breakthroughs in thisfield are expected to arise from the high spectral resolution and sensitivityin the fe-k band, combined with broad-band sensitivity over the full x-ray bandand spectral capabilities also at lower energies. the sensitivity in the fe-kregion allows to extend the absorption measure distribution of the outflow outto the highest ionisation states accessible, where observations with currentx-ray missions indicate that most of the outflowing gas is to be found. due tothe high-resolution and sensitivity it will also be able to give the definitiveproof for the existence of ultra-fast outflows, and if so, characterise theirphysical properties in great detail. these ultra-fast outflows carry very largeamounts of energy and momentum, and are of fundamental importance for feedbackstudies. we show how the astro-h observations in general can help to constrainnumerical models for outflows. the link to reflection and emission processes isalso discussed, as well as the possible relation between outflows andrelativistic emission lines. finally, we discuss the prospects for otherrelated categories of objects like bal quasars, partially covered sources andcompton thick outflows.

1412.3903	six years of fermi-lat and multi-wavelength monitoring of the broad-line  radio galaxy 3c 120: jet dissipation at sub-parsec scales from the central  engine	we present multi-wavelength monitoring results for the broad-line radiogalaxy 3c 120 in the mev/gev, sub-millimeter, and 43 ghz bands over six years.over the past two years, fermi-lat sporadically detected 3c 120 with highsignificance and the 230 ghz data also suggest an enhanced activity of thesource. after the mev/gev detection from 3c 120 in mjd 56240-56300, 43 ghz vlbamonitoring revealed a brightening of the radio core, followed by the ejectionof a superluminal knot. since we observed the gamma-ray and vlba phenomena intemporal proximity to each other, it is naturally assumed that they arephysically connected. this assumption was further supported by the subsequentobservation that the 43 ghz core brightened again after a gamma-ray flareoccurred around mjd 56560. we can then infer that the mev/gev emission tookplace inside an unresolved 43 ghz core of 3c 120 and that the jet dissipationoccurred at sub-parsec distances from the central black hole, if we take thedistance of the 43 ghz core from the central black hole as ~ 0.5 pc, aspreviously estimated from the time lag between x-ray dips and knot ejections(marscher et al. 2002; chatterjee et al. 2009). based on our constraints on therelative locations of the emission regions and energetic arguments, we concludethat the gamma rays are more favorably produced via the synchrotronself-compton process, rather than inverse compton scattering of externalphotons coming from the broad line region or hot dusty torus. we also derivedthe electron distribution and magnetic field by modeling the simultaneousbroadband spectrum.

1510.00004	search for extended gamma-ray emission from the virgo galaxy cluster  with fermi-lat	galaxy clusters are one of the prime sites to search for dark matter (dm)annihilation signals. depending on the substructure of the dm halo of a galaxycluster and the cross sections for dm annihilation channels, these signalsmight be detectable by the latest generation of $\gamma$-ray telescopes. herewe use three years of fermi large area telescope (lat) data, which are the mostsuitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of nearbyvirgo galaxy cluster. our analysis reveals statistically significant extendedemission which can be well characterized by a uniformly emitting disk profilewith a radius of 3\deg that moreover is offset from the cluster center. wedemonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends onthe adopted interstellar emission model (iem) and is most likely an artifact ofour incomplete description of the iem in this region. we also search for andfind new point source candidates in the region. we then derive conservativeupper limits on the velocity-averaged dm pair annihilation cross section fromvirgo. we take into account the potential $\gamma$-ray flux enhancement due todm sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. for dmannihilating into $b\overline{b}$, assuming a conservative sub-halo modelsetup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1.5 orders of magnitude above theexpectation from the thermal cross section for$m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim100\,\mathrm{gev}$. in a more optimistic scenario, weexclude $\langle \sigma v \rangle\sim3\times10^{-26}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$for $m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim40\,\mathrm{gev}$ for the same channel. finally, wederive upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-rayinteractions in the inter cluster medium. we find that the volume-averagedcosmic-ray-to-thermal pressure ratio is less than $\sim6\%$.

astro-ph;0611232	hard x-ray detector (hxd) on board suzaku	the hard x-ray detector (hxd) on board suzaku covers a wide energy range from10 kev to 600 kev by combination of silicon pin diodes and gso scintillators.the hxd is designed to achieve an extremely low in-orbit back ground based on acombination of new techniques, including the concept of well-type active shieldcounter. with an effective area of 142 cm^2 at 20 kev and 273 cm2 at 150 kev,the background level at the sea level reached ~1x10^{-5} cts s^{-1} cm^{-2}kev^{-1} at 30 kev for the pi n diodes, and ~2x10^{-5} cts s^{-1} cm^{-2}kev^{-1} at 100 kev, and ~7x10^{-6} cts s^{-1} cm^{-2} kev^{-1} at 200 kev forthe phoswich counter. tight active shielding of the hxd results in a largearray of guard counters surrounding the main detector parts. theseanti-coincidence counters, made of ~4 cm thick bgo crystals, have a largeeffective area for sub-mev to mev gamma-rays. they work as an excellentgamma-ray burst monitor with limited angular resolution (~5 degree). theon-board signal-processing system and the data transmitted to the ground arealso described.

astro-ph;9609191	asca pv observations of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 4388: the obscured  nucleus and its x-ray emission	we present results on the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc4388 in the virgo clusterobserved with asca during its pv phase. the 0.5-10 kev x-ray spectrum consistsof multiple components; (1) a continuum component heavily absorbed by a columndensity nh = 4e23 cm-2 above 3 kev; (2) a strong 6.4 kev line (ew = 500 ev);(3) a weak flat continuum between 1 and 3 kev; and (4) excess soft x-rayemission below 1 kev. the detection of strong absorption for the hard x-raycomponent is firm evidence for an obscured active nucleus in this seyfert 2galaxy. the absorption corrected x-ray luminosity is about 2e42 erg/s. this isthe first time that the fluorescent iron-k line has been detected in thisobject. the flat spectrum in the intermediate energy range may be a scatteredcontinuum from the central source. the soft x-ray emission below 1 kev can bethermal emission from a temperature kt = 0.5 kev, consistent with the spatiallyextended emission observed by rosat hri. however, the low abundance (0.05 zs)and high mass flow rate required for the thermal model and an iron-k linestronger than expected from the obscuring torus model are puzzling. analternative consistent solution can be obtained if the central source was ahundred times more luminous over than a thousand years ago. all the x-rayemission below 3 kev is then scattered radiation.

astro-ph;9701133	the structure of the x-ray emitting gas in the hydra-a cluster of  galaxies	the temperature and abundance structure in the intracluster medium (icm) ofthe hydra-a cluster of galaxies is studied with asca and rosat. the effect ofthe large extended outskirts in the point-spread function of the x-raytelescope on asca is included in this analysis. in the x-ray brightnessprofile, the strong central excess above a single beta-model, identified in theeinstein and rosat data, is also found in the harder energy band (&gt;4kev). asimultaneous fit of five annular spectra taken with the gis instrument shows aradial distribution of the temperature and metal abundance. a significantcentral enhancement in the abundance distribution is found, while thetemperature profile suggests that the icm is approximately isothermal with thetemperature of ~3.5kev. the rosat pspc spectrum in the central 1'.5 regionindicates a significantly lower temperature than the gis result. a jointanalysis of the gis and pspc data reveals that the spectra can be described bya two temperature model as well as by a cooling flow model. in both cases, thehot phase gas with the temperature of ~3.5kev occupies more than 90% of thetotal emission measure within 1'.5 from the cluster center. the estimated massof the cooler (0.5-0.7kev) component is ~2-6 x 10^9 m_solar, which iscomparable to the mass of hot halos seen in non-cd ellipticals. the coolingflow model gives the mass deposition rate of 60+-30 m_solar/yr, an order ofmagnitude lower than the previous estimation.

astro-ph;9806279	discovery of the central excess brightness in hard x-rays in the cluster  of galaxies abell 1795	using the x-ray data from \asca, spectral and spatial properties of theintra-cluster medium (icm) of the cd cluster abell 1795 are studied, up to aradial distance of $\sim 12'$ ($\sim 1.3$ $h_{50}^{-1}$ kpc). the icmtemperature and abundance are spatially rather constant, although the coolemission component is reconfirmed in the central region. the azimuthally-averaged radial x-ray surface brightness profiles are very similar between soft(0.7--3 kev) and hard (3--10 kev) energy bands, and neither can be fitted witha single-$\beta$ model due to a strong data excess within $\sim5'$ of thecluster center. in contrast, double-$\beta$ models can successfully reproducethe overall brightness profiles both in the soft and hard energy bands, as wellas that derived with the \rosat pspc. properties of the central excessbrightness are very similar over the 0.2--10 kev energy range spanned by \rosatand \asca. thus, the excess x-ray emission from the core region of this clusteris confirmed for the first time in hard x-rays above 3 kev. this indicates thatthe shape of the gravitational potential becomes deeper than the king-type onetowards the cluster center. radial profiles of the total gravitating matter,calculated using the double-$\beta$ model, reveal an excess mass of $\sim 3\times 10^{13}~ m_{\odot}$ within $\sim 150 h^{-1}_{50}$ kpc of the clustercenter. this suggests a hierarchy in the gravitational potential correspondingto the cd galaxy and the entire cluster.

0810.4570	detection of hard x-rays from the compton-thick seyfert 2 galaxy ngc  2273 with suzaku	we have obtained a broad-band spectrum of the compton-thick seyfert 2 galaxyngc 2273 with suzaku. the spectrum reveals the first detection of hard x-raysabove ~10 kev from ngc 2273. the broad-band spectrum is well represented by athree-component model, accompanied by both a strong iron ka line with anequivalent width of ~ 1.8 kev and several weak lines. the three-component modelconsists of a soft component, a reflection component from cold matter, and anabsorbed power-law component. the soft component can be represented by thinthermal emission with kt~0.56 kev or by a scattered component with a scatteringfraction of 0.4%. fixing the photon indices of the power law and reflectioncomponents at 1.9, we found that the power law component, heavily absorbed bygas with a column density of ~1.5x10^24 cm^-2, has an intrinsic 2-10 kevluminosity of ~1.7x10^42 erg/s. we also apply a reflection model based on amonte carlo simulation, assuming a simple torus geometry. we found that themodel fits the broad band spectrum well, and we place some tentativeconstraints on the geometry of the putative torus in ngc2273.
