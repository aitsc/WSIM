0901.1130	the many manifestations of downsizing: hierarchical galaxy formation  models confront observations	[abridged] it has been widely claimed that several lines of observationalevidence point towards a "downsizing" (ds) of the process of galaxy formationover cosmic time. this behavior is sometimes termed "anti-hierarchical", andcontrasted with the "bottom-up" assembly of the dark matter structures in colddark matter models. in this paper we address three different kinds ofobservational evidence that have been described as ds: the stellar massassembly, star formation rate and the ages of the stellar populations in localgalaxies. we compare a broad compilation of available data-sets with thepredictions of three different semi-analytic models of galaxy formation withinthe lambda-cdm framework. in the data, we see only weak evidence at best of dsin stellar mass and in star formation rate. we find that, when observationalerrors on stellar mass and sfr are taken into account, the models acceptablyreproduce the evolution of massive galaxies, over the entire redshift rangethat we consider. however, lower mass galaxies are formed too early in themodels and are too passive at late times. thus, the models do not correctlyreproduce the ds trend in stellar mass or the archaeological ds, while theyqualitatively reproduce the mass-dependent evolution of the sfr. we demonstratethat these discrepancies are not solely due to a poor treatment of satellitegalaxies but are mainly connected to the excessively efficient formation ofcentral galaxies in high-redshift haloes with circular velocities ~100-200km/s.

0902.4080	frequency and properties of bars in cluster and field galaxies at  intermediate redshifts	we present a study of large-scale bars in field and cluster environments outto redshifts of ~0.8 using a final sample of 945 moderately inclined diskgalaxies drawn from the ediscs project. we characterize bars and their hostgalaxies and look for relations between the presence of a bar and theproperties of the underlying disk. we investigate whether the fraction andproperties of bars in clusters are different from their counterparts in thefield. the total optical bar fraction in the redshift range z=0.4-0.8 (medianz=0.60), averaged over the entire sample, is 25% (20% for strong bars). for thecluster and field subsamples, we measure bar fractions of 24% and 29%,respectively. we find that bars in clusters are on average longer than in thefield and preferentially found close to the cluster center, where the barfraction is somewhat higher (~31%) than at larger distances (~18%). thesefindings however rely on a relatively small subsample and might be affected bysmall number statistics. in agreement with local studies, we find thatdisk-dominated galaxies have a higher optical bar fraction (~45%) thanbulge-dominated galaxies (~15%). this result is based on hubble types andeffective radii and does not change with redshift. the latter finding impliesthat bar formation or dissolution is strongly connected to the emergence of themorphological structure of a disk and is typically accompanied by a transitionin the hubble type.

0706.2551	the dependence of galaxy formation on cosmological parameters: can we  distinguish the wmap1 and wmap3 parameter sets?	we combine n-body simulations of structure growth with physical modelling ofgalaxy evolution to investigate whether the shift in cosmological parametersbetween the 1-year and 3-year results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropyprobe affects predictions for the galaxy population. structure formation issignificantly delayed in the wmap3 cosmology, because the initial matterfluctuation amplitude is lower on the relevant scales. the decrease in darkmatter clustering strength is, however, almost entirely offset by an increasein halo bias, so predictions for galaxy clustering are barely altered. in bothcosmologies several combinations of physical parameters can reproduce observed,low-redshift galaxy properties; the star formation, supernova feedback and agnfeedback efficiencies can be played off against each other to give similarresults. models which fit observed luminosity functions predict projected2-point correlation functions which scatter by about 10-20 per cent on largescale and by larger factors on small scale, depending both on cosmology and ondetails of galaxy formation. measurements of the pairwise velocity distributionprefer the wmap1 cosmology, but careful treatment of the systematics is needed.given current modelling uncertainties, it is not easy to distinguish the wmap1and wmap3 cosmologies on the basis of low-redshift galaxy properties. modelpredictions diverge more dramatically at high redshift. better observationaldata at z&gt;2 will better constrain galaxy formation and perhaps alsocosmological parameters.

0905.4503	the rest-frame optical luminosity function of cluster galaxies at z&lt;0.8  and the assembly of the cluster red sequence	we present the rest-frame optical luminosity function (lf) of red sequencegalaxies in 16 clusters at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8 drawn from the eso distant cluster survey(ediscs). we compare our clusters to an analogous sample from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) and match the ediscs clusters to their most likelydescendants. we measure all lfs down to m m* + (2.5 - 3.5). at z&lt;0.8, thebright end of the lf is consistent with passive evolution but there is asignificant build-up of the faint end of the red sequence towards lowerredshift. there is a weak dependence of the lf on cluster velocity dispersionfor ediscs but no such dependence for the sdss clusters. we find tentativeevidence that red sequence galaxies brighter than a threshold magnitude arealready in place, and that this threshold evolves to fainter magnitudes towardlower redshifts. we compare the ediscs lfs with the lf of co-eval red sequencegalaxies in the field and find that the bright end of the lfs agree. however,relative to the number of bright red galaxies, the field has more faint redgalaxies than clusters at 0.6&lt;z&lt;0.8 but fewer at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.6, implyingdifferential evolution. we compare the total light in the ediscs cluster redsequences to the total red sequence light in our sdss cluster sample. clustersat 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8 must increase their luminosity on the red sequence (and thereforestellar mass in red galaxies) by a factor of 1-3 by z=0. the necessaryprocesses that add mass to the red sequence in clusters predict local clustersthat are over-luminous as compared to those observed in the sdss. the predictedcluster luminosities can be reconciled with observed local cluster luminositiesby combining multiple previously known effects.

0907.3922	on the role of the post-starburst phase in the build-up of the  red-sequence of intermediate redshift clusters	we present new deep spectroscopic observations of 0.05--0.5 l_* galaxies inone cluster (cl1232.5-1250) drawn from the eso distant cluster survey (ediscs)sample, at z = 0.54. the new data extend the spectroscopy already available forthis cluster by about 1 magnitude. the cluster has a large fraction of passivegalaxies and exhibits a well defined and relatively tight colour-magnituderelation. among spectroscopic members, only six galaxies are classified as`post-starburst' (k+a). for another ediscs cluster at similar redshift and withas deep spectroscopy, no member is found to have a k+a spectrum. the lowmeasured numbers of post-starburst systems appear to be inadequate to explainthe observed increase of faint red galaxies at lower redshift, even whenaccounting for the infall of new galaxies onto the cluster. post-starburstgalaxies represent a possible channel to move galaxies from the bluestar-forming cloud to the red-sequence, but the available data suggest this isnot the dominant channel in galaxy clusters. if the galaxies at the faint endof the red-sequence in nearby clusters originate from the blue galaxiesobserved in distant galaxy clusters, the transformation must have occurredprimarily through physical processes that do not lead to a post-starburstphase. in addition, our data exclude a large population of k+a galaxies atfaint magnitudes, as found in the coma cluster.

0909.1291	on the nature of the milky way satellites	we combine a series of high-resolution simulations with semi-analytic galaxyformation models to follow the evolution of a system resembling the milky wayand its satellites. the semi-analytic model is based on that developed for themillennium simulation, and successfully reproduces the properties of galaxieson large scales, as well as those of the milky way. in this model, we are ableto reproduce the luminosity function of the satellites around the milky way bypreventing cooling in haloes with vvir &lt; 16.7 km/s (i.e. the atomic hydrogencooling limit) and including the impact of the reionization of the universe.the physical properties of our model satellites (e.g. mean metallicities, ages,half-light radii and mass-to-light ratios) are in good agreement with thelatest observational measurements. we do not find a strong dependence upon theparticular implementation of supernova feedback, but a scheme which is moreefficient in galaxies embedded in smaller haloes, i.e. shallower potentialwells, gives better agreement with the properties of the ultra-faintsatellites. our model predicts that the brightest satellites are associatedwith the most massive subhaloes, are accreted later (z $\lta$ 1), and haveextended star formation histories, with only 1 per cent of their stars made bythe end of the reionization. on the other hand, the faintest satellites wereaccreted early, are dominated by stars with age &gt; 10 gyr, and a few of themformed most of their stars before the reionization was complete. objects withluminosities comparable to those of the classical mw satellites are associatedwith dark matter subhaloes with a peak circular velocity $\gta$ 10 km/s, inagreement with the latest constraints.

0910.1612	evolution of the early-type galaxy fraction in clusters since z = 0.8	we study the morphological content of a large sample of high-redshiftclusters to determine its dependence on cluster mass and redshift. quantitativemorphologies are based on bulge+disk decompositions of cluster and fieldgalaxies on deep vlt/fors2 images of 18 optically-selected clusters at 0.45 &lt; z&lt; 0.80 from the eso distant cluster survey (ediscs). morphological content isgiven by the early-type galaxy fraction f_et, and early-type galaxies areselected based on their bulge fraction and image smoothness. a set of 158 sdssclusters is analyzed exactly as the ediscs sample to provide a robust localcomparison. our main results are: (1) f_et values for the sdss and ediscsclusters exhibit no clear trend as a function of sigma. (2) mid-z ediscsclusters around sigma = 500 km/s have f_et ~= 0.5 whereas high-z ediscsclusters have f_et ~= 0.4 (~25% increase over 2 gyrs). (3) there is a markeddifference in the morphological content of ediscs and sdss clusters. none ofthe ediscs clusters have f_et greater than 0.6 whereas half of the sdssclusters lie above this value. this difference is seen in clusters of allvelocity dispersions. (4) there is a strong correlation between morphology andstar formation in sdss and ediscs clusters. this correlation holds independentof sigma and z even though the fraction of [oii] emitters decreases from z~0.8to z~0.06 in all environments. our results pose an interesting challenge tostructural transformation and star formation quenching processes that stronglydepend on the global cluster environment and suggest that cluster membershipmay be of lesser importance than other variables in determining galaxyproperties.

0912.1853	stellar ages and metallicities of central and satellite galaxies:  implications for galaxy formation and evolution	using a large sdss galaxy group catalogue, we study how the stellar ages andmetallicities of central and satellite galaxies depend on stellar mass and halomass. we find that satellites are older and metal-richer than centrals of thesame stellar mass. in addition, the slopes of the age-stellar mass andmetallicity-stellar mass relations are found to become shallower in denserenvironments. this is due to the fact that the average age and metallicity oflow mass satellite galaxies increase with the mass of the halo in which theyreside. a comparison with the semi-analytical model of wang et al. (2008) showsthat it succesfully reproduces the fact that satellites are older than centralsof the same stellar mass and that the age difference increases with the halomass of the satellite. this is a consequence of strangulation, which leaves thestellar populations of satellites to evolve passively, while the prolonged starformation activity of centrals keeps their average ages younger. the resultingage offset is larger in more massive environments because their satellites wereaccreted earlier. the model fails, however, in reproducing the halo massdependence of the metallicities of low mass satellites, yieldsmetallicity-stellar mass and age-stellar mass relations that are too shallow,and predicts that satellite galaxies have the same metallicities as centrals ofthe same stellar mass, in disagreement with the data. we argue that thesediscrepancies are likely to indicate the need to (i) modify the recipes of bothsupernova feedback and agn feedback, (ii) use a more realistic description ofstrangulation, and (iii) include a proper treatment of the tidal stripping,heating and destruction of satellite galaxies.

0912.2741	cluster galaxies die hard	we investigate how the specific star formation rates of galaxies of differentmasses depend on cluster-centric radius and on the central/satellite dichotomyin both field and cluster environments. recent data from a variety of sources,including the cluster catalogue of von der linden et al. are compared to thesemi-analytic models of de lucia &amp; blaizot. we find that these models predicttoo many passive satellite galaxies in clusters, too few passive centralgalaxies with low stellar masses, and too many passive central galaxies withhigh masses. we then outline a series of modifications to the model necessaryto solve these problems: a) instead of instantaneous stripping of the externalgas reservoir after a galaxy becomes a satellite, the gas supply is assumed todecrease at the same rate that the surrounding halo loses mass due to tidalstripping, b) the agn feedback efficiency is lowered to bring the fraction ofmassive passive centrals in better agreement with the data. we also allow forradio mode agn feedback in satellite galaxies. c) we assume that satellitegalaxies residing in host haloes with masses below 10^12 m_sun do not undergoany stripping. we highlight the fact that in low mass galaxies, the externalreservoir is composed primarily of gas that has been expelled from the galacticdisk by supernovae driven winds. this gas must remain available as a futurereservoir for star formation, even in satellite galaxies. finally, we present asimple recipe for the stripping of gas and dark matter in satellites that canbe used in models where subhalo evolution is not followed in detail.

1002.3465	the evolution of the density of galaxy clusters and groups: denser  environments at higher redshifts	we show that, observationally, the projected local density distribution inhigh-z clusters is shifted towards higher values compared to clusters at lowerredshift. to search for the origin of this evolution, we analyze a sample ofhaloes selected from the millennium simulation and populated usingsemi-analytic models, investigating the relation between observed projecteddensity and physical 3d density, using densities computed from the 10 and 3closest neighbours. both observationally and in the simulations, we study therelation between number of cluster members and cluster mass, and number ofmembers per unit of cluster mass. we find that the observed evolution ofprojected densities reflects a shift to higher values of the physical 3ddensity distribution. in turn, this must be related with the globally highernumber of galaxies per unit of cluster volume n/v in the past. we show that theevolution of n/v is due to a combination of two effects: a) distant clusterswere denser in dark matter (dm) simply because the dm density within r_{200}(~the cluster virial radius) is defined to be a fixed multiple of the criticaldensity of the universe, and b) the number of galaxies per unit of cluster dmmass is remarkably constant both with redshift and cluster mass if countinggalaxies brighter than a passively evolving magnitude limit. our resultshighlight that distant clusters were much denser environments than today'sclusters, both in galaxy number and mass, and that the density conditions feltby galaxies in virialized systems do not depend on the system mass.

1003.3021	a semi-analytic model comparison - gas cooling and galaxy mergers	we use stripped-down versions of three semi-analytic galaxy formation modelsto study the influence of different assumptions about gas cooling and galaxymergers. by running the three models on identical sets of merger treesextracted from high-resolution cosmological n-body simulations, we are able toperform both statistical analyses and halo-by-halo comparisons. our studydemonstrates that there is a good statistical agreement between the threemodels used here, when operating on the same merger trees, reflecting a generalagreement in the underlying framework for semi-analytic models. we also show,however, that various assumptions that are commonly adopted to treat gascooling and galaxy mergers can lead to significantly different results, atleast in some regimes. in particular, we find that the different models adoptedfor gas cooling lead to similar results for mass scales comparable to that ofour own galaxy. significant differences, however, arise at larger mass scales.these are largely (but not entirely) due to different treatments of the `rapidcooling' regime, and different assumptions about the hot gas distribution. atthis mass regime, the predicted cooling rates can differ up to about one orderof magnitude, with important implications on the relative weight that thesemodels give to agn feedback in order to counter-act excessive gas condensationin relatively massive haloes at low redshift. different assumptions in themodelling of galaxy mergers can also result in significant differences in thetimings of mergers, with important consequences for the formation and evolutionof massive galaxies.

1006.0106	from dwarf spheroidals to cds: simulating the galaxy population in a  lcdm cosmology	we apply updated semi-analytic galaxy formation models simultaneously to thestored halo/subhalo merger trees of the millennium and millennium-iisimulations. these differ by a factor of 125 in mass resolution, allowingexplicit testing of resolution effects on predicted galaxy properties. we haverevised the treatments of the transition between the rapid infall and coolingflow regimes of gas accretion, of the sizes of bulges and of gaseous andstellar disks, of supernova feedback, of the transition between central andsatellite status as galaxies fall into larger systems, and of gas and starstripping once they become satellites. plausible values of efficiency andscaling parameters yield an excellent fit not only to the observed abundance oflow-redshift galaxies over 5 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and 9magnitudes in luminosity, but also to the observed abundance of milky waysatellites. this suggests that reionisation effects may not be needed to solvethe "missing satellite" problem except, perhaps, for the faintest objects. thesame model matches the observed large-scale clustering of galaxies as afunction of stellar mass and colour. the fit remains excellent down to ~30kpcfor massive galaxies. for m* &lt; 6 x 10^10msun, however, the model overpredictsclustering at scales below 1 mpc, suggesting that the sigma_8 adopted in thesimulations (0.9) is too high. galaxy distributions within rich clusters agreebetween the simulations and match those observed, but only if galaxies withoutdark matter subhalos (so-called orphans) are included. our model predicts alarger passive fraction among low-mass galaxies than is observed, as well as anoverabundance of ~10^10msun galaxies beyond z~0.6, reflecting deficiencies inthe way star-formation rates are modelled.

1006.5717	the dependence of agn activity on stellar and halo mass in semi-analytic  models	agn feedback is believed to play an important role in shaping a variety ofobserved galaxy properties, as well as the evolution of their stellar massesand star formation rates. in particular, in the current theoretical paradigm ofgalaxy formation, agn feedback is believed to play a crucial role in regulatingthe levels of activity in galaxies, in relatively massive halos at lowredshift. only in recent years, however, has detailed statistical informationon the dependence of galaxy activity on stellar mass, parent halo mass andhierarchy has become available. in this paper, we compare the fractions ofgalaxies belonging to different activity classes (star-forming, agn and radioactive) with predictions from four different and independently developedsemi-analytical models. we adopt empirical relations to convert physicalproperties into observables (h_alpha emission lines, oiii line strength andradio power). we demonstrate that all models used in this study reproduce theoverall distributions of galaxies belonging to different activity classes as afunction of stellar mass and halo mass: star forming galaxies and the strongestradio sources are preferentially associated with low-mass and high-massgalaxies/halos respectively. however, model predictions differ fromobservational measurements in a number of ways. all models used in our studypredict that almost every &gt;1.e12 msun dark matter halo and/or &gt;1.e11 msungalaxy should host a bright radio source, while only a small fraction ofgalaxies belong to this class in the data. in addition, radio brightness isexpected to depend strongly on the mass of the parent halo mass in the models,while strong and weak radio galaxies are found in similar environments in data.our results highlight that the distribution of agn as a function of stellarmass provides one of the most promising discriminants between different gasaccretion schemes.

1007.1425	the colour-magnitude relation of elliptical and lenticular galaxies in  the eso distant cluster survey	we study the colour-magnitude relation (cmr) for a sample of 172morphologically-classified e/s0 cluster galaxies from the eso distant clustersurvey (ediscs) at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8. the intrinsic colour scatter about the cmr isvery small (0.076) in rest-frame u-v. only 7% of the galaxies are significantlybluer than the cmr. the scarcity of blue s0s indicates that, if they are thedescendants of spirals, these were already red when they became s0s. we observeno dependence of the cmr scatter with redshift or cluster velocity dispersion.this implies that by the time cluster e/s0s achieve their morphology, the vastmajority have already joined the red sequence. we estimate the galaxy formationredshift z_f for each cluster and find that it does not depend on the clustervelocity dispersion. however, z_f increases weakly with cluster redshift. thistrend becomes clearer when including higher-z clusters from the literature,suggesting that, at any given z, in order to have a population of fully-formede and s0s they needed to have formed most of their stars 2-4 gyr prior toobservation. in other words, the galaxies that already have early-type (et)morphologies also have reasonably-old stellar populations. this is partly amanifestation of the "progenitor bias", but also a consequence of the fact thatthe vast majority of the ets in clusters (in particular the massive ones) werealready red by the time they achieved their morphology. e and s0 galaxiesexhibit very similar colour scatter, implying similar stellar population ages.we also find that fainter ets finished forming their stars later, consistentwith the cluster red sequence being built over time and the brightest galaxiesreaching the red sequence earlier than fainter ones. finally, we find that theet cluster galaxies must have had their star formation truncated over anextended period of at least 1 gyr.

1009.1392	the effect of thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch stars on the  evolution of the rest-frame near-infrared galaxy luminosity function	we address the fundamental question of matching the rest-frame k-bandluminosity function (lf) of galaxies over the hubble time using semi-analyticmodels, after modification of the stellar population modelling. we include themaraston evolutionary synthesis models, that feature a higher contribution bythe thermally pulsating - asymptotic giant branch (tp-agb) stellar phase, intothree different semi-analytic models, namely the de lucia and blaizot versionof the munich model, morgana and the menci model. we leave all other inputphysics and parameters unchanged. we find that the modification of the stellarpopulation emission can solve the mismatch between models and the observedrest-frame k-band luminosity from the brightest galaxies derived from ukidssdata at high redshift. for all explored semi-analytic models this holds at theredshifts - between 2 and 3 - where the discrepancy was recently pointed out.the reason for the success is that at these cosmic epochs the model galaxieshave the right age (~1 gyr) to contain a well-developed tp-agb phase whichmakes them redder without the need of changing their mass or age. at the sametime, the known overestimation of the faint end is enhanced in the k-band whenincluding the tp-agb contribution. at lower redshifts (z&lt;2) some of theexplored models deviate from the data. this is due to too short mergingtimescales and inefficient 'radio-mode' agn feedback. our results show that astrong evolution in mass predicted by hierarchical models is compatible with noevolution on the bright-end of the k-band lf from z=3 to the local universe.this means that, at high redshifts and contrary to what is commonly accepted,k-band emission is not necessarily a good tracer of galaxy mass.

1102.3186	times, environments and channels of bulge formation in a lambdacdm  cosmology	we analyze predictions from two independently developed galaxy formationmodels to study the mechanisms, environments, and characteristic times of bulgeformation in a lambdacdm cosmogony. for each model, we test differentprescriptions for bulge formation in order to quantify the relative importanceof different channels. our results show that the strong correlation betweengalaxy and halo mass for central galaxies, and the richer merger history ofmore massive systems naturally give rise to a strong correlation between galaxymass and morphology, and between halo mass and morphological type of centralgalaxies. large fractions of the bulge mass are acquired through major andminor mergers, but disc instability plays an important role, particularly forintermediate mass galaxies. we find that the modelling of disc instabilityevents, as well as of the galaxy merger times, can affect significantly thetiming of bulge formation, and the relative importance of different channels.bulge dominated galaxies acquire their morphology through major mergers, butthis can be modified by cooling of gas from the surrounding hot halo. we findthat disc regrowth is a non negligible component of the evolution of bulgedominated galaxies, particularly for low to intermediate masses, and at highredshifts.

1102.3188	the other side of bulge formation in a lambda-cdm cosmology: bulgeless  galaxies in the local universe	we study the physical properties, formation histories, and environment ofgalaxies without a significant "classical" spheroidal component, as predictedby semi-analytical models of galaxy formation and evolution. this work iscomplementary to the analysis presented in de lucia et al., (2011), where wefocus on the relative contribution of various physical mechanisms responsiblefor bulge assembly in a lambda-cdm cosmology. we find that the fraction ofbulgeless galaxies is a strong decreasing function of stellar mass: theyrepresent a negligible fraction of the galaxy population with m* &gt; 10^12 msun,but dominate at m* &lt; 10^10 msun. we find a clear dichotomy in this galaxypopulation, between central galaxies of low-mass dark matter haloes, andsatellite galaxies in massive groups/clusters. we show that bulgeless galaxiesare relatively young systems, that assemble most of their mass at low-redshift,but they can also host very old stellar populations. since galaxy-galaxymergers are assumed to lead to the formation of a spheroidal component, in ourmodels these galaxies form preferentially in low-mass haloes that host a smallnumber of satellites galaxies. we show that the adopted modelling for galaxymergers represents a key ingredient in determining the actual number ofbulgeless galaxies. our results show that these galaxies are not a rarepopulation in theoretical models: at z~0, galaxies with no classical bulge (butoften including galaxies with the equivalent of pseudo-bulges) account for upto 14% of the galaxies with 10^11 &lt; m*/msun &lt; 10^12.

1102.4269	properties of fossil groups in cosmological simulations and galaxy  formation models	it has been a long-standing question whether fossil groups are just samplingthe tail of the distribution of ordinary groups, or whether they are aphysically distinct class of objects, characterized by an unusual and specialformation history. to study this question, we here investigate fossil groupsidentified in the hydrodynamical simulations of the gimic project, whichconsists of resimulations of five regions in the millennium simulation (ms)that are characterized by different large-scale densities, ranging from a deepvoid to a proto-cluster region. for comparison, we also consider semi-analyticmodels built on top of the ms, as well as a conditional luminosity functionapproach. we identify galaxies in the gimic simulations as groups of stars anduse a spectral synthesis code to derive their optical properties. the x-rayluminosity of the groups is estimated in terms of the thermal bremsstrahlungemission of the gas in the host halos, neglecting metallicity effects. we focuson comparing the properties of fossil groups in the theoretical models andobservational results, highlighting the differences between them, and trying toidentify possible dependencies on environment for which our approach isparticularly well set-up. we find that the optical fossil fraction in all ofour theoretical models declines with increasing halo mass, and there is noclear environmental dependence. combining the optical and x-ray selectioncriteria for fossil groups, the halo mass dependence of the fossil groups seenin optical vanishes. over the gimic halo mass range we resolve best,9.0\times1012 \sim 4.0\times1013 h-1 m, the central galaxies in the fossilgroups show similar properties as those in ordinary groups, in terms of age,metallicity, color, concentration, and mass-to-light ratio.

1103.0024	the population of milky way satellites in the lambdacdm cosmology	we present a model for the satellites of the milky way in which galaxyformation is followed using semi-analytic techniques applied to the sixhigh-resolution n-body simulations of galactic halos of the aquarius project.the model, calculated using the galform code, incorporates improved treatmentsof the relevant physics in the lambdacdm cosmogony, particularly aself-consistent calculation of reionization by uv photons emitted by theforming galaxy population, including the progenitors of the central galaxy.along the merger tree of each halo, the model calculates gas cooling (bycompton scattering off cosmic microwave background photons, molecular hydrogenand atomic processes), gas heating (from hydrogen photoionization and supernovaenergy), star formation and evolution. the evolution of the intergalacticmedium is followed simultaneously with that of the galaxies. star formation inthe more massive progenitor subhalos is suppressed primarily by supernovafeedback, while for smaller subhalos it is suppressed primarily byphotoionization due to external and internal sources. the model is constrainedto match a wide range of properties of the present day galaxy population as awhole, but at high redshift it requires an escape fraction of uv photons nearunity in order completely to reionize the universe by redshift z ~ 8. in themost successful model the local sources photoionize the pre-galactic regioncompletely by z ~ 10. in addition to the luminosity function of milky waysatellites, the model matches their observed luminosity-metallicity relation,their radial distribution and the inferred values of the mass within 300 pc,which in the models increase slowly but significantly with luminosity. there isa large variation in satellite properties from halo to halo, with theluminosity function, for example, varying by a factor of ~ 2 among the sixsimulations.

1105.3880	autocorrelations of stellar light and mass at z~0 and ~1: from sdss to  deep2	we present measurements of projected autocorrelation functions w_p(r_p) forthe stellar mass of galaxies and for their light in the u, b and v bands, usingdata from the third data release of the deep2 galaxy redshift survey and thefinal data release of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we investigate theclustering bias of stellar mass and light by comparing these to projectedautocorrelations of dark matter estimated from the millennium simulations (ms)at z=1 and 0.07, the median redshifts of our galaxy samples. all of theautocorrelation and bias functions show systematic trends with spatial scaleand waveband which are impressively similar at the two redshifts. this showsthat the well-established environmental dependence of stellar populations inthe local universe is already in place at z=1. the recent ms-based galaxyformation simulation of guo et al. (2011) reproduces the scale-dependentclustering of luminosity to an accuracy better than 30% in all bands and atboth redshifts, but substantially overpredicts mass autocorrelations atseparations below about 2 mpc. further comparison of the shapes of our stellarmass bias functions with those predicted by the model suggests that both thesdss and deep2 data prefer a fluctuation amplitude of sigma_8 0.8 rather thanthe sigma_8=0.9 assumed by the ms.

1107.0963	the effect of the environment on the gas kinematics and the structure of  distant galaxies	with the aim of distinguishing between possible physical mechanisms acting ongalaxies when they fall into clusters, we study the properties of the gas andthe stars in a sample of 422 emission-line galaxies from ediscs in differentenvironments up to z~1. we identify galaxies with kinematical disturbances(from emission-lines in their 2d spectra) and find that they are more frequentin clusters than in the field. the fraction of kinematically-disturbed galaxiesincreases with cluster velocity dispersion and decreases with distance from thecluster centre, but remains constant with projected galaxy density. we alsostudied morphological disturbances in the stellar light from hst/f814w images,finding that the fraction of morphologically disturbed galaxies is similar inall environments. moreover, there is little correlation between the presence ofkinematically-disturbed gas and morphological distortions. we also study thedependence of the tully-fisher relation, star formation, and extent of theemission on environment, and conclude that the gas disks in cluster galaxieshave been truncated, and therefore their star formation is more concentratedthan in low-density environments. if spirals transform into s0s, our findingsimply that the physical mechanism transforming cluster galaxies efficientlydisturbs the star-forming gas and reduces their specific star formation rate.moreover, this star-forming gas is either removed more efficiently from theoutskirts of the galaxies or is driven towards the centre (or both), helping tobuild the bulges of s0s. these results, in addition to the finding that thetransformation mechanism does not seem to induce strong morphologicaldisturbances on the galaxies, suggest that the physical processes involved arerelated to the intracluster medium, with galaxy-galaxy interactions playingonly a limited role in clusters.

1107.4098	convergence of galaxy properties with merger tree temporal resolution	dark matter halo merger trees are now routinely extracted from cosmologicalsimulations of structure formation. these trees are frequently used as inputsto semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to provide the backbone withinwhich galaxy formation takes place. by necessity, these merger trees areconstructed from a finite set of discrete "snapshots" of the n-body simulationand so have a limited temporal resolution. to date, there has been littleconsideration of how this temporal resolution affects the properties ofgalaxies formed within these trees. in particular, the question of how manysnapshots are needed to achieve convergence in galaxy properties has not beanswered. therefore, we study the convergence in the stellar and total baryonicmasses of galaxies, distribution of merger times, stellar mass functions andstar formation rates in the galacticus model of galaxy formation as a functionof the number of "snapshot" times used to represent dark matter halo mergertrees. when utilizing snapshots between z=20 and z=0, we find that at least 128snapshots are required to achieve convergence to within 5% for galaxy masses.this convergence is obtained for mean quantities averaged over large samples ofgalaxies - significant variance for individual galaxies remains even when usingvery large numbers of snapshots. we find only weak dependence of the rate ofconvergence on the distribution of snapshots in time - snapshots spaceduniformly in the expansion factor, uniformly in the logarithm of expansionfactor or uniformly in the logarithm of critical overdensity for collapse workequally well in almost all cases. we provide input parameters to galacticuswhich allow this type of convergence study to be tuned to other simulations andto be carried out for other galaxy properties.

1109.2599	what determines the fraction of elliptical galaxies in clusters?	we study the correlation between the morphological mix of cluster galaxiesand the assembly history of the parent cluster by taking advantage of twoindependently developed semi-analytic models for galaxy formation andevolution. in our models, both the number of cluster members and that ofelliptical members increase as a function of cluster mass, in such a way thatthe resulting elliptical fractions are approximately independent of clustermass. the population of cluster ellipticals exhibit a marked bimodaldistribution as a function of galaxy stellar mass, with a dip at masses $\sim10^{10}\,{\rm m}_{\odot}$. in the framework of our models, this bimodalityoriginates from the combination of a strongly decreasing number of galaxieswith increasing stellar mass, and a correspondingly increasing probability ofexperiencing major mergers. we show that the correlation between the measuredelliptical fraction and the assembly history of the parent cluster is weak, andthat it becomes stronger in models that adopt longer galaxy merger times. weargue that this results from the combined effect of a decreasing bulgeproduction due to a reduced number of mergers, and an increasing survivalprobability of pre-existing ellipticals, with the latter process being moreimportant than the former.

1111.0830	the galaxy stellar mass function and its evolution with time show no  dependence on global environment	we present the analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function in differentenvironments at intermediate redshift (0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8) for two mass-limited galaxysamples. we use the imacs cluster building survey (icbs), at masses m_ast&gt;10^(10.5) m_sun, to study cluster, group, and field galaxies at z=0.3-0.45,and the eso distant cluster survey (ediscs), at masses m_ast &gt; 10^(10.2) m_sun,to investigate cluster and group galaxies at z=0.4-0.8. therefore, in ouranalysis we include galaxies that are slightly less massive than the milky way.having excluded the brightest cluster galaxies, we show thatthe shape of themass distribution does not seem to depend on global environment. our two mainresults are: (1) galaxies in the virialized regions of clusters, in groups, andin the field follow a similar mass distribution. (2) comparing both icbs andediscs mass functions to mass functions in the local universe, we findevolution from z~0.4-0.6 to z~0.07. the population of low-mass galaxies hasproportionally grown with time with respect to that of massive galaxies. thisevolution is independent of environment -- the same for clusters and the field.furthermore, considering only clusters, we find that no differences can bedetected neither within the virialized regions, nor when we compare galaxieswithin and outside the virial radius. subdividing galaxies in terms of color,in clusters, groups, and field red and blue galaxies are regulated by differentmass functions, but comparing separately the blue and red mass functions indifferent environments, no differences are detected in their shape.

1111.6590	the environmental history of group and cluster galaxies in a lambdacdm  universe	we use publicly available galaxy merger trees, obtained applyingsemi-analytic techniques to a large high resolution cosmological simulation, tostudy the environmental history of group and cluster galaxies. our resultshighlight the existence of an intrinsic history bias which makes the natureversus nurture (as well as the mass versus environment) debate inherently illposed. in particular we show that: (i) surviving massive satellites wereaccreted later than their less massive counterparts, from more massive haloes;(ii) the mixing of galaxy populations is incomplete during halo assembly, whichcreates a correlation between the time a galaxy becomes satellite and itspresent distance from the parent halo centre. the weakest trends are found forthe most massive satellites, as a result of efficient dynamical friction andlate formation times of massive haloes. a large fraction of the most massivegroup/cluster members are accreted onto the main progenitor of the final haloas central galaxies, while about half of the galaxies with low and intermediatestellar mass are accreted as satellites. large fractions of group and clustergalaxies (in particular those of low stellar mass) have therefore been`pre-processed' as satellites of groups with mass ~10^13 msun. to quantify therelevance of hierarchical structure growth on the observed environmentaltrends, we have considered observational estimates of the passive galaxyfractions, and their variation as a function of halo mass and cluster-centricdistance. comparisons with our theoretical predictions require relatively longtimes (~5-7 gyr) for the suppression of star formation in group and clustersatellites.

1202.0550	simulating the evolution of disc galaxies in a group environment. i. the  influence of the global tidal field	we present the results of a series of numerical simulations aimed to studythe evolution of a disc galaxy within the global tidal field of a groupenvironment. both the disc galaxy and the group are modelled asmulti-component, collision-less, n-body systems, composed by both dark matterand stars. in our simulations, the evolution of disc galaxies is followed astheir orbits sink towards the group centre, under the effect of dynamicalfriction. we explore a broad parameter space, covering several aspects of thegalaxy-group interaction that are potentially relevant to galaxy evolution.namely, prograde and retrograde orbits, orbital eccentricities, discinclination, role of a central bulge in discs, internal disc kinematics, andgalaxy-to-group mass ratios. we find that significant disc transformationsoccur only after the mean density of the group, measured within the orbit ofthe galaxy, exceeds ~0.3-1 times the central mean density of the galaxy. themorphological evolution of discs is found to be strongly dependent on theinitial inclination of the disc with respect to its orbital plane. that is,discs on face-on and retrograde orbits are shown to retain longer their discstructures and kinematics, in comparison to prograde discs. this suggests thatafter interacting with the global tidal field alone, a significant fraction ofdisc galaxies should be found in the central regions of groups. prominentcentral bulges are not produced, and pre-existing bulges are not enhanced indiscs after the interaction with the group. assuming that most s0 are formed ingroup environments, this implies that prominent bulges should be formed mostlyby young stars, created only after a galaxy has been accreted by a group.finally, contrary to some current implementations of tidal stripping insemi-analytical models of galaxy evolution, we find that more massive galaxiessuffer more tidal stripping.

1202.5212	a warm mode of gas accretion on forming galaxies	we present results from high--resolution cosmological hydrodynamicalsimulations of a milky--way-sized halo, aimed at studying the effect offeedback on the nature of gas accretion. simulations include a model ofinter-stellar medium and star formation, in which sn explosions provideeffective thermal feedback. we distinguish between gas accretion onto the halo,which occurs when gas particles cross the halo virial radius, and gas accretiononto the central galaxy, which takes place when gas particles cross the innerone-tenth of the virial radius. gas particles can be accreted through threedifferent channels, depending on the maximum temperature value, $t_{\rm max}$,reached during the particles' past evolution: a cold channel for $t_{\rmmax}&lt;2.5 \times 10^5$ k, a hot one for $t&gt;10^6$k, and a warm one forintermediate values of $t_{\rm max}$. we find that the warm channel is at leastas important as the cold one for gas accretion onto the central galaxy. thisresult is at variance with previous findings that the cold mode dominates gasaccretion at high redshift. we ascribe this difference to the differentsupernova feedback scheme implemented in our simulations. while resultspresented so far in the literature are based on uneffective sn thermal feedbackschemes and/or the presence of a kinetic feedback, our simulations include onlyeffective thermal feedback. we argue that observational detections of a warmaccretion mode in the high--redshift circum-galactic medium would provideuseful constraints on the nature of the feedback that regulates star formationin galaxies.

1206.0020	the satellites of the milky way - insights from semi-analytic modelling  in a lambdacdm cosmology	we combine the six high-resolution aquarius dark matter simulations with asemi-analytic galaxy formation model to investigate the properties of thesatellites of milky way-like galaxies. we find good correspondence with theobserved luminosity function, luminosity-metallicity relation and radialdistribution of the milky way satellites. the star formation histories of thedwarf galaxies in our model vary widely, in accordance with what is seenobservationally. ram-pressure stripping of hot gas from the satellites leaves aclear imprint of the environment on the characteristics of a dwarf galaxy. wefind that the fraction of satellites dominated by old populations of starsmatches observations well. however, the internal metallicity distributions ofthe model satellites appear to be narrower than observed. this may indicatelimitations in our treatment of chemical enrichment, which is based on theinstantaneous recycling approximation. our model works best if the dark matterhalo of the milky way has a mass of ~8 x 10^11 msun, in agreement with thelower estimates from observations. the galaxy that resembles the milky way themost also has the best matching satellite luminosity function, although it doesnot contain an object as bright as the smc or lmc. compared to othersemi-analytic models and abundance matching relations we find that centralgalaxies reside in less massive haloes, but the halo mass-stellar mass relationin our model is consistent both with hydrodynamical simulations and with recentobservations.

0711.3418	realistic simulations of gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters:  extracting arc parameters from mock dune images	we present a newly developed code that allows simulations of opticalobservations of galaxy fields with a variety of instruments. the codeincorporates gravitational lensing effects and is targetted at simulatinglensing by galaxy clusters. our goal is to create the tools required forcomparing theoretical expectations with observations to obtain a betterunderstanding of how observational noise affects lensing applications such asmass estimates, studies on the internal properties of galaxy clusters and arcstatistics. starting from a set of input parameters, characterizing both theinstruments and the observational conditions, the simulator provides a virtualobservation of a patch of the sky. it includes several sources of noise such asphoton-noise, sky background, seeing, and instrumental noise. ray-tracingthrough simulated mass distributions accounts for gravitational lensing. sourcemorphologies are realistically simulated based on shapelet decompositions ofgalaxy images retrieved from the goods-acs archive. according to theirmorphological class, spectral-energy-distributions are assigned to the sourcegalaxies in order to reproduce observations of each galaxy in arbitraryphotometric bands. we illustrate our techniques showing virtual observations ofa galaxy-cluster core as it would be observed with the space telescope dune,which was recently proposed to esa within its "cosmic vision" programme.(abridged)

1211.1005	superdense galaxies and the mass-size relation at low redshift	we search for massive and compact galaxies (superdense galaxies, hereaftersdgs) at z=0.03-0.11 in the padova-millennium galaxy and group catalogue, aspectroscopically complete sample representative of the local universe generalfield population. we find that compact galaxies with radii and mass densitiescomparable to high-z massive and passive galaxies represent 4.4% of allgalaxies with stellar masses above 3 x 10^10 m_sun, yielding a number densityof 4.3 x 10^-4 h^3 mpc^-3. most of them are s0s (70%) or ellipticals (23%), arered and have intermediate-to-old stellar populations, with a medianluminosity-weighted age of 5.4 gyr and a median mass-weighted age of 9.2 gyr.their velocity dispersions and dynamical masses are consistent with the smallradii and high stellar mass estimates. comparing with the wings sample ofcluster galaxies at similar redshifts, the fraction of superdense galaxies isthree times smaller in the field than in clusters, and cluster sdgs are onaverage 4 gyr older than field sdgs. we confirm the existence of a universaltrend of smaller radii for older luminosity-weighted ages at fixed galaxy mass.on top of the well known dependence of stellar age on galaxy mass, theluminosity-weighted age of galaxies depends on galaxy compactness at fixedmass, and, for a fixed mass and radius, on environment. this effect needs to betaken into account in order not to overestimate the evolution of galaxy sizesfrom high- to low-z. our results and hierarchical simulations suggest that asignificant fraction of the massive compact galaxies at high-z have evolvedinto compact galaxies in galaxy clusters today. when stellar age andenvironmental effects are taken into account, the average amount of sizeevolution of individual galaxies between high- and low-z is mild, a factor~1.6.

1301.4220	a research note on the implementation of star formation and stellar  feedback in semi-analytic models	we study the impact of star formation and stellar feedback prescriptions ongalaxy properties predicted by means of "stripped-down" versions ofindependently developed semi-analytic models (sams). these include cooling,star formation, feedback from supernovae (sne) and simplified prescriptions forgalaxy merging, but no chemical evolution, disc instabilities or agn feedback.we run these versions on identical samples of dark matter (dm) haloes extractedfrom high-resolution n-body simulations in order to perform both statisticalanalysis and object-by-object comparisons. we compare our results with previouswork based on stripped-down versions of the same sams including only gascooling, and show that all feedback models provide coherent modifications inthe distribution of baryons between the various gas phases. in particular, wefind that the predicted hot gas fractions are considerably increased by up to afactor of three, while the corresponding cold gas fractions are correspondinglydecreased, and a significant amount of mass is ejected from the dm halo.nonetheless, we also find relevant differences in the predicted properties ofmodel galaxies among the three sams: these deviations are more relevant at massscales comparable to that of our own galaxy, and are reduced at larger masses,confirming the varying impact of stellar feedback at different mass scales. wealso check the effect of enhanced star formation events (i.e. starburstsmodes), defined in connection with galaxy mergers. we find that, in general,these episodes have a limited impact in the overall star formation histories ofmodel galaxies, even in massive dm halos where merger-driven star formation hasoften been considered very important.

1302.3616	isolated galaxies in hierarchical galaxy formation models - present-day  properties and environmental histories	in this study, we have carried out a detailed, statistical analysis ofisolated model galaxies, taking advantage of publicly available hierarchicalgalaxy formation models. to select isolated galaxies, we employ 2d methodswidely used in the observational literature, as well as a more stringent 3disolation criterion that uses the full 3d-real space information. inqualitative agreement with observational results, isolated model galaxies havelarger fractions of late-type, star forming galaxies with respect to randomlyselected samples of galaxies with the same mass distribution. we also find thatthe samples of isolated model galaxies typically contain a fraction of lessthan 15 per cent of satellite galaxies, that reside at the outskirts of theirparent haloes where the galaxy number density is low. projection effects causea contamination of 2d samples of about 18 per cent, while we estimate a typicalcompleteness of 65 per cent. our model isolated samples also include a verysmall (few per cent) fraction of bulge dominated galaxies (b/t &gt; 0.8) whosebulges have been built mainly by minor mergers. our study demonstrates thatabout 65-70 per cent of 2d isolated galaxies that are classified as isolated atz = 0 have indeed been completely isolated since z = 1 and only 7 per cent havehad more than 3 neighbours within a comoving radius of 1 mpc. irrespectively ofthe isolation criteria, roughly 45 per cent of isolated galaxies haveexperienced at least one merger event in the past (most of the mergers areminor, with mass ratios between 1:4 and 1:10). the latter point validates theapproximation that isolated galaxies have been mainly influenced by internalprocesses.

1303.2117	an improved prescription for merger time-scales from controlled  simulations	we compare three analytical prescriptions for merger times available from theliterature to simulations of isolated mergers. we probe three differentredshifts, and several halo concentrations, mass ratios, orbital circularitiesand orbital energies of the satellite. we find that prescriptions available inthe literature significantly under-predict long timescales for mergers at highredshift. we argue that these results have not been highlighted previouslyeither because the evolution of halo concentration of satellite galaxies hasbeen neglected (in previous isolated merger simulations), or because longmerger times and mergers with high initial orbital circularities areunder-represented (for prescriptions based on cosmological simulations).motivated by the evolution of halo concentration at fixed mass, an explicitdependence on redshift added as t_merger,modified(z) = (1+z)^0.44 t_merger tothe prescription based on isolated mergers gives a significant improvement inthe predicted merger times up to ~20 t_dyn in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;2. whenthis modified prescription is used to compute galaxy stellar mass functions, wefind that it leads up to a 25 per cent increase in the number of low massgalaxies surviving at z=0, and a 10 per cent increase for more massivegalaxies. this worsen the known over-prediction in the number of low massgalaxies by hierarchical models of galaxy formation.

1305.0350	detection of galaxy assembly bias	assembly bias describes the finding that the clustering of dark matter haloesdepends on halo formation time at fixed halo mass. in this paper, we analysethe influence of assembly bias on galaxy clustering using both semi-analyticalmodels (sams) and observational data. at fixed stellar mass, sams predict thatthe clustering of {\it central} galaxies depends on the specific star formationrate (ssfr), with more passive galaxies having a higher clustering amplitude.we find similar trends using sdss group catalogues, and verify that these arenot affected by possible biases due to the group finding algorithm. low masscentral galaxies reside in narrow bins of halo mass, so the observed trends ofhigher clustering amplitude for galaxies with lower ssfr is not driven byvariations of the parent halo mass. we argue that the clustering dependence onssfr represent a direct detection of assembly bias. in addition, contrary towhat expected based on clustering of dark matter haloes, we find that low-masscentral galaxies in sams with larger host halo mass have a {\it lower}clustering amplitude than their counter-parts residing in lower mass haloes.this results from the fact that, at fixed stellar mass, assembly bias has astronger influence on clustering than the dependence on the parent halo mass.

1305.7163	the hierarchical origins of observed galaxy morphology	galaxies grow primarily via accretion-driven star formation in discs andmerger-driven growth of bulges. these processes are implicit in semi-analyticalmodels of galaxy formation, with bulge growth in particular relating directlyto the hierarchical build-up of halos and their galaxies. in this paper, weconsider several implementations of two semi-analytical models. focusing onimplementations in which bulges are formed during mergers only, we examine thefractions of elliptical galaxies and both passive and star-forming diskgalaxies as functions of stellar and halo mass, for central and satellitesystems. this is compared to an observational cross-matched sdss+rc3 z ~ 0sample of galaxies with accurate visual morphological classifications andm_{stellar} &gt; 10^10.5 m_{sol}. the models qualitatively reproduce the observedincrease of elliptical fraction with stellar mass, and with halo mass forcentral galaxies, supporting the idea that observed ellipticals form duringmajor mergers. however, the overall elliptical fraction produced by the modelsis much too high compared with the z ~ 0 data. since the "passive" -- i.e.non-star-forming -- fractions are approximately reproduced, and since thefraction which are star-forming disc galaxies is also reproduced, the problemis that the models overproduce ellipticals at the expense of passive s0 andspiral galaxies. bulge-growth implementations (tuned to reproduce simulations)which allow the survival of residual discs in major mergers still destroy toomuch of the disc. increasing the lifetime of satellites, or allowingsignificant disc regrowth around merger remnants, merely increases the fractionof star-forming disc galaxies. instead, it seems necessary to reduce the massratios of merging galaxies, so that most mergers produce modest bulge growth indisc-galaxy remnants instead of ellipticals.

1404.0811	a semi-analytic model comparison: testing cooling models against  hydrodynamical simulations	we compare predictions of cooled masses and cooling rates from threestripped-down semi-analytic models (sams) of galaxy formation with the resultsof n-body+sph simulations with gas particle mass of 3.9x10^6 msun, whereradiative cooling of a gas of primordial composition is implemented. we alsorun a simulation where cooling is switched on at redshift ~2, in order to testcooling models in a regime in which their approximations are expected to bevalid. we confirm that cooling models implemented in sams are able to predictthe amount of cooled mass at z=0 to within ~20 per cent. however, some relevantdiscrepancies are found. (i) when the contribution from poorly resolved halosis subtracted out, sams tend to under-predict by ~30 per cent the mass thatcools in the infall-dominated regime. (ii) at large halo masses sams tend toover-predict cooling rates, though the numerical result may be affected by theuse of sph. (iii) as found in our previous work, cooling rates are found to besignificantly affected by model details: simulations disfavour models withlarge cores and with quenching of cooling at major mergers. (iv) when coolingis switched on at z~2, cold gas accumulates very quickly in the simulatedhalos. this accumulation is reproduced by sams with varying degrees ofaccuracy.

1404.2942	simulating the evolution of disc galaxies in a group environment. ii.  the influence of close-encounters between galaxies	we study the evolution of disc galaxies in group environments under theeffect of both the global tidal field and close-encounters between galaxies,using controlled n-body simulations of isolated mergers. we find thatclose-range encounters between galaxies are less frequent and less damaging todisc galaxies than originally expected, since they mostly occur when groupmembers have lost a significant fraction of their initial mass to tidalstripping. we also find that group members mostly affect disc galaxiesindirectly by modifying their common global tidal field. different initialorbital parameters of group members introduce a significant "scatter" in theevolution of general properties of disc galaxies around a "median" evolutionthat is similar to when only the effect of the global tidal field is included.close-encounters introduce a high variability in the properties of discgalaxies, even slowing their evolution in some cases, and could wash outcorrelations between galaxy properties and the group total mass. the combinedeffect of the global tidal field and close-encounters appears to be inefficientat forming/enhancing central stellar bulges. this implies that bulges of s0galaxies should be mostly composed by young stars, which is consistent withrecent observations.

1407.5621	the influence of the environmental history on quenching star formation  in a $\lambda$cdm universe	we present a detailed analysis of the influence of the environment and of theenvironmental history on quenching star formation in central and satellitegalaxies in the local universe. we take advantage of publicly available galaxycatalogues obtained from applying a galaxy formation model to the millenniumsimulation. in addition to halo mass, we consider the local density of galaxieswithin various fixed scales. comparing our model predictions to observationaldata (sdss), we demonstrate that the models are failing to reproduce theobserved density dependence of the quiescent galaxy fraction in severalaspects: for most of the stellar mass ranges and densities explored, modelscannot reproduce the observed similar behaviour of centrals and satellites,they slightly under-estimate the quiescent fraction of centrals andsignificantly over-estimate that of satellites. we show that in the models, thedensity dependence of the quiescent central galaxies is caused by a fraction of"backsplash" centrals which have been satellites in the past (and were thussuffering from environmental processes). turning to satellite galaxies, thedensity dependence of their quiescent fractions reflects a dependence on thetime spent orbiting within a parent halo of a particular mass, correlatingstrongly with halo mass and distance from the halo centre. comparisons withobservational estimates suggest relatively long gas consumption time scales ofroughly 5 gyr in low mass satellite galaxies. the quenching time scalesdecrease with increasing satellite stellar mass. overall, a change in modellingboth internal processes (star formation and feedback) and environmentalprocesses (e.g. making them dependent on dynamical friction time-scales andpreventing the re-accretion of gas onto backsplash galaxies) is required forimproving currently used galaxy formation models.

1407.7867	elemental abundances in milky way-like galaxies from a hierarchical  galaxy formation model	we develop a new method to account for the finite lifetimes of stars andtrace individual abundances within a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation.at variance with previous methods, based on the storage of the (binned) paststar formation history of model galaxies, our method projects the informationabout the metals produced by each simple stellar population (ssp) in thefuture. using this approach, an accurate accounting of the timings andproperties of the individual ssps composing model galaxies is possible. weanalyse the dependence of our chemical model on various ingredients, and applyit to six simulated haloes of roughly milky way mass and with no massive closeneighbour at z=0. for all models considered, the [fe/h] distributions of thestars in the disc component are in good agreement with milky way data, whilefor the spheroid component (whose formation we model only through mergers)these are offset low with respect to observational measurements for the milkyway bulge. this is a consequence of narrow star formation histories, withrelatively low rates of star formation. the slow recycling of gas and energyfrom supernovae in our chemical model has important consequences on thepredicted star formation rates, which are systematically lower than thecorresponding rates in the same physical model but with an instantaneousrecycling approximation. the halo that resembles most our galaxy in terms ofits global properties also reproduces the observed relation between the averagemetallicity and luminosity of the milky way satellites, albeit with a slightlysteeper slope.

1410.7413	the definition of environment and its relation to the quenching of  galaxies at z=1-2 in a hierarchical universe	a well calibrated method to describe the environment of galaxies at allredshifts is essential for the study of structure formation. such a calibrationshould include well understood correlations with halo mass, and the possibilityto identify galaxies which dominate their potential well (centrals), and theirsatellites. focusing on z = 1 and 2 we propose a method of environmentalcalibration which can be applied to the next generation of low to mediumresolution spectroscopic surveys. using an up-to-date semi-analytic model ofgalaxy formation, we measure the local density of galaxies in fixed apertureson different scales. there is a clear correlation of density with halo mass forsatellite galaxies, while a significant population of low mass centrals isfound at high densities in the neighbourhood of massive haloes. in this casethe density simply traces the mass of the most massive halo within theaperture. to identify central and satellite galaxies, we apply anobservationally motivated stellar mass rank method which is both highly pureand complete, especially in the more massive haloes where such a division ismost meaningful. finally we examine a test case for the recovery ofenvironmental trends: the passive fraction of galaxies and its dependence onstellar and halo mass for centrals and satellites. with careful calibration,observationally defined quantities do a good job of recovering known trends inthe model. this result stands even with reduced redshift accuracy, provided thesample is deep enough to preserve a wide dynamic range of density.

1412.6105	the early phases of galaxy clusters formation in ir: coupling  hydrodynamical simulations with grasil3d	we compute and study the infrared and sub-mm properties of high redshift ($z\gtrsim 1$) simulated clusters and proto-clusters. the results of a large setof hydro-dynamical zoom-in simulations including active galactic nuclei (agn)feedback, have been treated with the recently developed radiative transfer codegrasil-3d, which accounts for the effect of dust reprocessing in an arbitrarygeometry. here, we have slightly generalized the code to adapt it to thepresent purpose. then we have post-processed boxes of physical size 2 mpcencompassing each of the 24 most massive clusters identified at z=0, at severalredshifts between 0.5 and 3, producing ir and sub-mm mock images of theseregions and seds of the radiation coming out from them.  while this field is in its infancy from the observational point of view,rapid development is expected in the near future thanks to observationsperformed in the far ir and sub-mm bands. notably, we find that in thisspectral regime our prediction are little affected by the assumption requiredby this post-processing, and the emission is mostly powered by star formationrather than accretion onto super massive black hole (smbh).  the comparison with the little observational information currently available,highlights that the simulated cluster regions never attain the impressive starformation rates suggested by these observations. this problem becomes moreintriguing taking into account that the brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) inthe same simulations turn out to be too massive. it seems that the interplaybetween the feedback schemes and the star formation model should be revised,possibly incorporating a positive feedback mode.

0804.2465	the galaxy and its stellar halo: insights on their formation from a  hybrid cosmological approach	we use a series of high-resolution simulations of a `milky-way' halo coupledto semi-analytic methods to study the formation of our own galaxy and of itsstellar halo. the physical properties of our model milky way, as well as theage and metallicity distribution of stars in the different components, are inrelatively good agreement with observational measurements. assuming that thestellar halo builds up from the cores of the satellite galaxies that mergedwith the milky way over its life-time, we are able to study the physical andstructural properties of this component. in agreement with previous work, wefind that the largest contribution to the stellar halo should come from a fewrelatively massive (10^8 - 10^10 msun) satellites, accreted at early times. our"stellar halo" does not exhibit any clear metallicity gradient, but highermetallicity stars are more centrally concentrated than stars of lowerabundance. this indicates that the probability of observing low-metallicityhalo stars increases with distance from the galactic centre. we find that theproposed "dual" nature of the galactic stellar halo can be explained in ourmodel as a result of a mass-metallicity relation imprinted in the buildingblocks of this component.

1503.08225	galaxy sizes as a function of environment at intermediate redshift from  the eso distant cluster survey	in order to assess whether the environment has a significant effect on galaxysizes, we compare the mass--size relations of cluster and field galaxies in the$0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.8$ redshift range from the eso distant cluster survey (ediscs)using hst images. we analyse two mass-selected samples, one defined usingphotometric redshifts ($10.2 \le \log m_\ast/m_{\odot} \le 12.0$), and asmaller more robust subsample using spectroscopic redshifts ($10.6 \le \logm_\ast/m_{\odot} \le 11.8$). we find no significant difference in the sizedistributions of cluster and field galaxies of a given morphology. similarly,we find no significant difference in the size distributions of cluster andfield galaxies of similar rest-frame $b-v$ colours. we rule out average sizedifferences larger than $10$--$20$\% in both cases. consistent conclusions arefound with the spectroscopic and photometric samples. these results haveimportant consequences for the physical process(es) responsible for the sizeevolution of galaxies, and in particular the effect of the environment. theremarkable growth in galaxy size observed from $z\sim2.5$ has been reported todepend on the environment at higher redshifts ($z&gt;1$), with early-type/passivegalaxies in higher density environments growing earlier. such dependencedisappears at lower redshifts. therefore, if the reported difference athigher-$z$ is real, the growth of field galaxies has caught up with that ofcluster galaxies by $z\sim1$. any putative mechanism responsible for galaxygrowth has to account for the existence of environmental differences at highredshift and their absence (or weakening) at lower redshifts.

0805.1145	the relation between star formation, morphology and local density in  high redshift clusters and groups	we investigate how the [oii] properties and the morphologies of galaxies inclusters and groups at z=0.4-0.8 depend on projected local galaxy density, andcompare with the field at similar redshifts and clusters at low-z. in bothnearby and distant clusters, higher-density regions contain proportionallyfewer star-forming galaxies, and the average [oii] equivalent width ofstar-forming galaxies is independent of local density. however, in distantclusters the average current star formation rate (sfr) in star-forming galaxiesseems to peak at densities ~15-40 galaxies mpc^{-2}. at odds with low-zresults, at high-z the relation between star-forming fraction and local densityvaries from high- to low-mass clusters. overall, our results suggest that athigh-z the current star formation (sf) activity in star-forming galaxies doesnot depend strongly on global or local environment, though the possible sfrpeak seems at odds with this conclusion. we find that the cluster sfrnormalized by cluster mass anticorrelates with mass and correlates with thestar-forming fraction. these trends can be understood given a) that the averagestar-forming galaxy forms about 1 msun/yr in all clusters; b) that the totalnumber of galaxies scales with cluster mass and c) the dependence ofstar-forming fraction on cluster mass. we present the morphology-density (md)relation for our z=0.4-0.8 clusters, and uncover that the decline of the spiralfraction with density is entirely driven by galaxies of types sc or later. forgalaxies of a given hubble type, we see no evidence that sf properties dependon local environment. in contrast with recent findings at low-z, in our distantclusters the sf-density relation and the md-relation are equivalent, suggestingthat neither of the two is more fundamental than the other.(abr.)

1505.04607	nifty cosmology: comparison of galaxy formation models	we present a comparison of 14 galaxy formation models: 12 differentsemi-analytical models and 2 halo-occupation distribution models for galaxyformation based upon the same cosmological simulation and merger treeinformation derived from it. the participating codes have proven to be verysuccessful in their own right but they have all been calibrated independentlyusing various observational data sets, stellar models, and merger trees. inthis paper we apply them without recalibration and this leads to a wide varietyof predictions for the stellar mass function, specific star formation rates,stellar-to- halo mass ratios, and the abundance of orphan galaxies. the scatteris much larger than seen in previous comparison studies primarily because thecodes have been used outside of their native environment within which they arewell tested and calibrated. the purpose of the `nifty comparison of galaxyformation models' is to bring together as many different galaxy formationmodellers as possible and to investigate a common approach to modelcalibration. this paper provides a unified description for all participatingmodels and presents the initial, uncalibrated comparison as a baseline for ourfuture studies where we will develop a common calibration framework and addressthe extent to which that reduces the scatter in the model predictions seenhere.

1507.04748	on the dependence of galaxy morphologies on galaxy mergers	the distribution of galaxy morphological types is a key test for models ofgalaxy formation and evolution, providing strong constraints on the relativecontribution of different physical processes responsible for the growth of thespheroidal components. in this paper, we make use of a suite of semi-analyticmodels to study the efficiency of galaxy mergers in disrupting galaxy discs andbuilding galaxy bulges. in particular, we compare standard prescriptionsusually adopted in semi-analytic models, with new prescriptions proposed bykannan et al., based on results from high-resolution hydrodynamicalsimulations, and we show that these new implementations reduce the efficiencyof bulge formation through mergers. in addition, we compare our model resultswith a variety of observational measurements of the fraction ofspheroid-dominated galaxies as a function of stellar and halo mass, showingthat the present uncertainties in the data represent an important limitation toour understanding of spheroid formation. our results indicate that the maintension between theoretical models and observations does not stem from thesurvival of purely disc structures (i.e. bulgeless galaxies), rather from thedistribution of galaxies of different morphological types, as a function oftheir stellar mass.

1509.00486	mergers and star formation: the environment and stellar mass growth of  the progenitors of ultra-massive galaxies since z = 2	the growth of galaxies is a key problem in understanding the structure andevolution of the universe. galaxies grow their stellar mass by a combination ofstar formation and mergers, with a relative importance that is redshiftdependent. theoretical models predict quantitatively different contributionsfrom the two channels; measuring these from the data is a crucial constraint.exploiting the ultravista catalog and a unique sample of progenitors of localultra massive galaxies selected with an abundance matching approach, wequantify the role of the two mechanisms from z=2 to 0. we also compare ourresults to two independent incarnations of semi-analytic models. at allredshifts, progenitors are found in a variety of environments, ranging frombeing isolated to having 5-10 companions with mass ratio at least 1:10 within aprojected radius of 500 kpc. in models, progenitors have a systematicallylarger number of companions, entailing a larger mass growth for mergers than inobservations, at all redshifts. generally, in both observations and models, theinferred and the expected mass growth roughly agree, within the uncertainties.overall, our analysis confirms the model predictions, showing how the growthhistory of massive galaxies is dominated by in situ star formation at z~2, bothstar-formation and mergers at 1&lt;z&lt;2, and by mergers alone at z&lt;1. nonetheless,detailed comparisons still point out to tensions between the expected massgrowth and our results, which might be due to either an incorrectprogenitors-descendants selection, uncertainties on star formation rate andmass estimates, or the adopted assumptions on merger rates.

0806.2872	milky way type galaxies in a lcdm cosmology	we analyse a sample of 52,000 milky way (mw) type galaxies drawn from thepublicly available galaxy catalogue of the millennium simulation with the aimof studying statistically the differences and similarities of their propertiesin comparison to our galaxy. model galaxies are chosen to lie in haloes withmaximum circular velocities in the range 200-250 km/seg and to havebulge-to-disk ratios similar to that of the milky way. we find that model mwgalaxies formed quietly through the accretion of cold gas and small satellitesystems. only 12 per cent of our model galaxies experienced a major mergerduring their lifetime. most of the stars formed in situ, with only about 15 percent of the final mass gathered through accretion. supernovae and agn feedbackplay an important role in the evolution of these systems. at high redshifts,when the potential wells of the mw progenitors are shallower, winds driven bysupernovae explosions blow out a large fraction of the gas and metals. as thesystems grow in mass, sn feedback effects decrease and agn feedback takes over,playing a more important role in the regulation of the star formation activityat lower redshifts. although model milky way galaxies have been selected to liein a narrow range of maximum circular velocities, they nevertheless exhibit asignificant dispersion in the final stellar masses and metallicities. ouranalysis suggests that this dispersion results from the different accretionhistories of the parent dark matter haloes. statically, we also find evidencesto support the milky way as a typical sb/sc galaxy in the same mass range,providing a suitable benchmark to constrain numerical models of galaxyformation

astro-ph;0310268	chemical enrichment of the intra-cluster and intergalactic medium in a  hierarchical galaxy formation model	(abridged) we use a combination of high resolution n-body simulations andsemi-analytic techniques to follow the formation, the evolution and thechemical enrichment of cluster galaxies in a lambda-cdm universe. we model thetransport of metals between the stars, the cold gas in galaxies, the hot gas indark matter haloes, and the intergalactic gas outside virialized haloes. wehave compared three different feedback schemes. the `retention' model assumesthat material reheated by supernova explosions is able to leave the galaxy, butnot the dark matter halo. the `ejection' model assumes that this materialleaves the halo and is then re-incorporated when structure collapses on largerscales. the `wind' model uses prescriptions that are motivated by observationsof local starburst galaxies. we require that our models reproduce the clusterlf from the 2df survey, the relations between stellar mass, gas mass andmetallicity inferred from new sdss data, and the observed amount of metals inthe icm. with suitable adjustment of the free parameters in the model, areasonable fit to the observational results at redshift zero can be obtainedfor all three feedback schemes. all three predict that the chemical enrichmentof the icm occurs at high redshift with 60-80 per cent of the metals currentlyin the icm ejected at redshifts larger than 1. massive galaxies are importantcontributors to the chemical pollution. the observed decline in baryon fractionfrom rich clusters to galaxy groups is reproduced only in an `extreme' ejectionscheme, where material ejected from dark matter haloes is re-incorporated on atimescale comparable to the age of the universe. we explore how the metalabundance in the intergalactic medium as a function of redshift can constrainthow and when galaxies ejected their metals.

astro-ph;0509725	the formation history of elliptical galaxies	we take advantage of the largest high-resolution simulation of cosmicstructure growth ever carried out -- the millennium simulation of theconcordance lambdacdm cosmogony -- to study how the star formation histories,ages and metallicities of elliptical galaxies depend on environment and onstellar mass. we concentrate on a galaxy formation model which is tuned to fitthe joint luminosity/colour/morphology distribution of low redshift galaxies.massive ellipticals in this model have higher metal abundances, olderluminosity-weighted ages, shorter star formation timescales, but lower assemblyredshifts than less massive systems. within clusters the typical masses, agesand metal abundances of ellipticals are predicted to decrease, on average, withincreasing distance from the cluster centre. we also quantify the effectivenumber of progenitors of ellipticals as a function of present stellar mass,finding typical numbers below 2 for m* &lt; 10^{11} msun, rising to about 5 forthe most massive systems. these findings are consistent with recentobservational results that suggest ``down-sizing'' or ``anti-hierarchical''behaviour for the star formation history of the elliptical galaxy population,despite the fact that our model includes all the standard elements ofhierarchical galaxy formation and is implemented on the standard, lambdacdmcosmogony.

astro-ph;0510405	gas infall and stochastic star formation in galaxies in the local  universe	we study the recent star formation histories of local galaxies by analyzingthe scatter in their colours and spectral properties. we present evidence thatthe distribution of star formation histories changes qualitatively above acharacteristic stellar surface mass density of 3x10^8 m_sol kpc^-2,corresponding to the transition between disk-dominated and bulge-dominatedgalaxies. when we average over subpopulations of galaxies with densities belowthis value, we find that subpopulations of all masses form their stars at thesame average rate per unit stellar mass. however, the scatter in galaxy coloursand emission line strengths is larger for more compact galaxies of a givenmass. this suggests that star formation occurs in shorter, higher amplitudeevents in galaxies with smaller sizes. above the characteristic density, galaxygrowth through star formation shuts down. we propose that star formation eventsare triggered when cold gas is accreted onto a galaxy. we have used the newhigh resolution millennium simulation of structure formation in a concordancelcdm universe to quantify the incidence of these accretion events and we showthat the observational data are well fit by a model in which the consumptiontime of accreted gas decreases with the surface density of the galaxy as t_cons\propto mu*^-1. the dark matter halos hosting massive galaxies with highdensities are also expected to grow through accretion, but the observationsindicate that star formation in bulge- dominated galaxies is no longer coupledto the hierarchical build-up of their surrounding dark matter halos.

astro-ph;0603546	modelling galaxy clustering in a high resolution simulation of structure  formation	we use the millennium simulation, a 10 billion particle simulation of thegrowth of cosmic structure, to construct a new model of galaxy clustering. weadopt a methodology that falls midway between the traditional semi-analyticapproach and the halo occupation distribution(hod) approach. in our model, weadopt the positions and velocities of the galaxies that are predicted byfollowing the orbits and merging histories of the substructures in thesimulation. rather than using star formation and feedback `recipes' to specifythe physical properties of the galaxies, we adopt parametrized functions torelate these properties to the quantity m_{infall}, defined as the mass of thehalo at the epoch when the galaxy was last the central dominant object in itsown halo. we test whether these parametrized relations allow us to recover thebasic statistical properties of galaxies in the semi-analytic catalogues,including the luminosity function, the stellar mass function and the shape andamplitude of the two-point correlation function evaluated in different stellarmass and luminosity ranges. we then use our model to interpret recentmeasurements of these quantities from sloan digital sky survey data. we deriverelations between the luminosities and the stellar masses of galaxies in thelocal universe and their host halo masses. our results are in excellentagreement with recent determinations of these relations by mandelbaum et alusing galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements from the sdss.

astro-ph;0606519	the hierarchical formation of the brightest cluster galaxies	we use semi-analytic techniques to study the formation and evolution ofbrightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). we show the extreme hierarchical nature ofthese objects and discuss the limits of simple ways to capture their evolution.in a model where cooling flows are suppressed at late times by agn activity,the stars of bcgs are formed very early (50 per cent at z~5, 80 per cent atz~3) and in many small galaxies. the high star formation rates in these high-zprogenitors are fuelled by rapid cooling, not by merger-triggered starbursts.we find that model bcgs assemble surprisingly late: half their final mass istypically locked-up in a single galaxy after z~0.5. because most of thegalaxies accreted onto bcgs have little gas content and red colours, latemergers do not change the apparent age of bcgs. it is this accumulation of alarge number of old stellar populations -- driven mainly by the merging historyof the dark matter halo itself -- that yields the observed homogeneity of bcgproperties. in the second part of the paper, we discuss the evolution of bcgsto high redshifts, from both observational and theoretical viewpoints. we showthat our model bcgs are in qualitative agreement with high-z observations. wediscuss the hierarchical link between high-z bcgs and their localcounter-parts. we show that high-z bcgs belong to the same population as themassive end of local bcg progenitors, although they are not in general the samegalaxies. similarly, high-z bcgs end-up as massive galaxies in the localuniverse, although only a fraction of them are actually bcgs of massiveclusters.

astro-ph;0610373	the build-up of the colour-magnitude relation in galaxy clusters since  z~0.8	using galaxy clusters from the eso distant cluster survey, we study how thedistribution of galaxies along the colour-magnitude relation has evolved sincez~0.8. while red-sequence galaxies in all these clusters are well described byan old, passively evolving population, we confirm our previous finding of asignificant evolution in their luminosity distribution as a function ofredshift. when compared to galaxy clusters in the local universe, the highredshift ediscs clusters exhibit a significant "deficit" of faint red galaxies.combining clusters in three different redshift bins, and defining as `faint'all galaxies in the range 0.4 &gt; l/l* &gt; 0.1, we find a clear decrease in theluminous-to-faint ratio of red galaxies from z~0.8 to z~0.4. the amount of sucha decrease appears to be in qualitative agreement with predictions of a modelwhere the blue bright galaxies that populate the colour-magnitude diagram ofhigh redshift clusters, have their star formation suppressed by the hostilecluster environment. although model results need to be interpreted withcaution, our findings clearly indicate that the red-sequence population ofhigh-redshift clusters does not contain all progenitors of nearby red-sequencecluster galaxies. a significant fraction of these must have moved onto thered-sequence below z~0.8.

astro-ph;0701407	the recycling of gas and metals in galaxy formation: predictions of a  dynamical feedback model	we present results of a new feedback scheme implemented in the munich galaxyformation model. the new scheme includes a dynamical treatment of galacticwinds powered by supernovae explosions and stellar winds in a cosmologicalcontext. we find that such a scheme is a good alternative toempirically-motivated recipes for feedback in galaxy formation. model resultsare in good agreement with the observed luminosity functions and stellar massfunction for galaxies in the local universe. in particular, the new schemepredicts a number density of dwarfs that is lower than in previous models. thisis a consequence of a new feature of the model, that allows an estimate of theamount of mass and metals that haloes can permanently deposit into the igm.this loss of material leads to the suppression of star formation in smallhaloes and therefore to the decrease in the number density of dwarf galaxies.the model is able to reproduce the observed mass-stellar metallicity andluminosity-gas metallicity relationships. this demonstrates that our schemeprovides a significant improvement in the treatment of the feedback in dwarfgalaxies. despite these successes, our model does not reproduce the observedbimodality in galaxy colours and predicts a larger number of bright galaxiesthan observed. finally, we investigate the efficiency of metal injection inwinds and in the intergalactic medium. we find that galaxies that reside inhaloes with m_vir &lt; 10^12 m_sun/h may deposit most of their metal mass into theintergalactic medium, while groups and clusters at z=0 have lost at most a fewpercent of their metals before the bulk of the halo mass was accreted.

astro-ph;0701682	modelling and interpreting the dependence of clustering on the spectral  energy distributions of galaxies	we extend our previous physically-based halo occupation distribution modelsto include the dependence of clustering on the spectral energy distributions ofgalaxies. the high resolution millennium simulation is used to specify thepositions and the velocities of the model galaxies. the stellar mass of agalaxy is assumed to depend only on m_{infall}, the halo mass when the galaxywas last the central dominant object of its halo. star formation histories areparametrized using two additional quantities that are measured from thesimulation for each galaxy: its formation time (t_{form}), and the time when itfirst becomes a satellite (t_{infall}). central galaxies begin forming stars attime t_{form} with an exponential time scale tau_c. if the galaxy becomes asatellite, its star formation declines thereafter with a new time scale tau_s.we compute 4000 \aa break strengths for our model galaxies using stellarpopulation synthesis models. by fitting these models to the observed abundancesand projected correlations of galaxies as a function of break strength in thesloan digital sky survey, we constrain tau_c and tau_s as functions of galaxystellar mass. we find that central galaxies with large stellar masses haveceased forming stars. at low stellar masses, central galaxies display a widerange of different star formation histories, with a significant fractionexperiencing recent starbursts. satellite galaxies of all masses have decliningstar formation rates, with similar e-folding times, tau_s ~ 2.5gyr. oneconsequence of this long e-folding time is that the colour-density relation ispredicted to flatten at redshifts &gt; 1.5, because star formation in the majorityof satellites has not yet declined by a significant factor. this is consistentwith recent observational results from the deep and vvds surveys.

0810.2566	lcdm predictions for galaxy protoclusters i: the relation between  galaxies, protoclusters and quasars at z~6	motivated by recent observational studies of the environment of z~6 qsos, wehave used the millennium run (mr) simulations to construct a very large (~20deg^2) mock redshift survey of star-forming galaxies at z~6. we use thissimulated survey to study the relation between density enhancements in thedistribution of i-dropouts and lya-emitters, and their relation to the mostmassive halos and protocluster regions at z~6. our simulation predictssignificant variations in surface density across the sky with some voids andfilaments extending over scales of 1 degree, much larger than probed by currentsurveys. approximately one third of all z~6 halos hosting i-dropouts brighterthan z=26.5 mag (~m* at z=6) become part of z=0 galaxy clusters. i-dropoutsassociated with protocluster regions are found in regions where the surfacedensity is enhanced on scales ranging from a few to several tens of arcminuteson the sky. we analyze two structures of i-dropouts and lya-emitters observedwith the subaru telescope and show that these structures must be the seeds ofmassive clusters-in-formation. in striking contrast, six z~6 qso fieldsobserved with hst show no significant enhancements in their i-dropout numbercounts. with the present data, we cannot rule out the qsos being hosted by themost massive halos. however, neither can we confirm this widely usedassumption. we conclude by giving detailed recommendations for theinterpretation and planning of observations by current and future ground- andspace based instruments that will shed new light on questions related to thelarge-scale structure at z~6.
