0901.1882	xmm-newton and suzaku analysis of the fe k complex in the seyfert 1  galaxy mrk 509	we report on partially overlapping xmm-newton (~260 ks) and suzaku (~100 ks)observations of the iron k band in the nearby, bright seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 509.the source shows a resolved neutral fe k line, most probably produced in theouter part of the accretion disc. moreover, the source shows further emissionblue-ward of the 6.4 kev line due to ionized material. this emission is wellreproduced by a broad line produced in the accretion disc, while it cannot beeasily described by scattering or emission from photo-ionized gas at rest. thesummed spectrum of all xmm-newton observations shows the presence of a narrowabsorption line at 7.3 kev produced by highly ionized outflowing material. aspectral variability study of the xmm-newton data shows an indication for anexcess of variability at 6.6-6.7 kev. these variations may be produced in thered wing of the broad ionized line or by variation of a further absorptionstructure. the suzaku data indicate that the neutral fe kalpha line intensityis consistent with being constant on long timescales (of a few years) and theyalso confirm as most likely the interpretation of the excess blueshiftedemission in terms of a broad ionized fe line. the average suzaku spectrumdiffers from the xmm-newton one for the disappearance of the 7.3 kev absorptionline and around 6.7 kev, where the xmm-newton data alone suggested variability.

0905.4383	the detection of broad iron k and l line emission in the narrow-line  seyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707-495 using xmm-newton	since the discovery of the first broad iron-k line in 1995 from the seyfertgalaxy mcg--6-30-15, broad iron-k lines have been found in several otherseyfert galaxies, from accreting stellar mass black holes and even fromaccreting neutron stars. the iron-k line is prominent in the reflectionspectrum created by the hard x-ray continuum irradiating dense accretingmatter. relativistic distortion of the line makes it sensitive to the stronggravity and spin of the black hole. the accompanying iron-l line emissionshould be detectable when the iron abundance is high. here we report the firstdiscovery of both iron-k and l emission, using xmm-newton observations of thenarrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707-495. the bright fe-l emission has enabledus, for the first time, to detect a reverberation lag of 30 s between thedirect x-ray continuum and its reflection from matter falling into the hole.the observed reverberation timescale is comparable to the light-crossing timeof the innermost radii around a supermassive black hole. the combination ofspectral and timing data on 1h0707-495 provides strong evidence that we arewitnessing emission from matter within a gravitational radius, or a fraction ofa light-minute, from the event horizon of a rapidly-spinning, massive blackhole.

0907.1527	probing variability patterns of the fe k line complex in bright nearby  agns	the unprecedented sensitivity of current x-ray telescopes allows for thefirst time to address the issue of the fe k line complex variability patternsin bright, nearby agns. we examine xmm-newton observations of the brightestsources of the fero sample of radio-quiet type 1 agns with the aim ofcharacterizing the temporal behaviour of fe k complex features. a systematicmapping of residual flux above and below the continuum in the 4-9 kev range isperformed in the time vs energy domain, with the purpose of identifyinginteresting spectral features in the three energy bands: 5.4-6.1 kev, 6.1-6.8kev and 6.8-7.2 kev, corresponding respectively to the redshifted, rest frameand blueshifted or highly ionized fe kalpha line bands. the variabilitysignificance is assessed by extracting light curves and comparing them withmontecarlo simulations. the time-averaged profile of the fe k complex revealedspectral complexity in several observations. red- and blue-shifted components(either in emission or absorption) were observed in 30 out of 72 observations,with an average &lt;ew&gt;~90 ev for emission and &lt;ew&gt;~ -30 ev for absorptionfeatures. we detected significant line variability (with confidence levelsranging between 90% and 99.7%) within at least one of the above energy bands in26 out of 72 observations on time scales of ~6-30 ks. reliability of thesefeatures has been carefully calculated using this sample and has been assessedat ~3sigma confidence level. this work increases the currently scanty number ofdetections of variable, energy shifted, fe lines and confirms the reliabilityof the claimed detections. we found that the distribution of detected featuresis peaked at high variability significances in the red- and blue-shifted energybands, suggesting an origin in a relativistically modified accretion flow.

0910.0367	broad iron l-line and x-ray reverberation in 1h0707-495	a detailed analysis of a long xmm-newton observation of the narrow lineseyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707-495 is presented, including spectral fitting, spectralvariability and timing studies. the two main features in the spectrum are thedrop at ~ 7 kev and a complex excess below 1 kev. these are well described bytwo broad, k and l, iron lines. alternative models based on absorption,although they may fit the high energy drop, cannot account for the 1 kevcomplexity and the spectrum as a whole. spectral variability shows that thespectrum is composed of at least two components, which are interpreted as apower-law dominating between 1-4 kev, and a reflection component outside thisrange. the high count rate at the iron l energies has enabled us to measure asignificant soft lag of ~ 30 s between 0.3-1 and 1-4 kev, meaning that thedirect hard emission leads the reflected emissions. we interpret the lag as areverberation signal originating within a few gravitational radii of the blackhole.

0911.1003	relativistic disc reflection in the extreme nls1 iras13224-3809	we present a spectral variability study of the xmm-newton and suzakuobservations of one of the most extreme narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies,iras13224-3809. the x-ray spectrum is characterized by two main peculiarfeatures, i) a strong soft excess with a steep rise below about 1.3 kev and ii)a deep drop in flux above 8.2 kev. we focus here on a reflection-basedinterpretation which interprets both features, as well as the large softexcess, in terms of partially ionized reflection off the inner accretion disc.we show that the two peculiar spectral features mentioned above can bereproduced by two relativistic emission lines due to fe k and fe l. the linesare produced in the inner accretion disc and independently yield consistentdisc parameters. we argue that the high l/k intensity ratio is broadlyconsistent with expectations from an ionized accretion disc reflection,indicating that they belong to a single ionized reflection component. thespectral shape, x-ray flux, and variability properties are very similar in thexmm-newton and suzaku observations, performed about 5 years apart. the overallx-ray spectrum and variability can be described by a simple two-component modelcomprising a steep power law continuum plus its ionised reflection off theinner accretion disc. in this model, a rapidly rotating kerr black hole and asteep emissivity profile are required to describe the data. the simultaneousdetection of broad relativistic fe l and k lines in iras 13224-3809 followsthat in another extreme nls1 galaxy, 1h0707-495. although the data quality foriras13224-3809 does not allow us to rule out competing models as in 1h0707-495,we show here that our reflection-based interpretation describes in aself-consistent manner the available data and points towards iras13224-3809being a very close relative of 1h0707-495 in terms of both spectral andvariability properties.

0911.3153	high resolution x-ray spectroscopy of the seyfert 1 mrk841: insights  into the warm absorber and warm emitter	the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk841 was observed five times between 2001 and 2005 bythe xmm-newton x-ray observatory. the source is well known for showing spectralcomplexity in the variable iron line and in the soft x-ray excess. this paperreports on the first study of mrk841 soft x-ray spectrum at high spectralresolution. the availability of multiple exposures obtained by the reflectiongrating spectrometer (rgs) cameras allows a thorough study of the complexabsorption and emission spectral features in the soft x-ray band.the threecombined exposures obtained in january 2001 and the two obtained in january andjuly 2005 were analysed using the spex software. we detect a two-phase warmabsorber: a medium ionisation component (logxi~1.5-2.2 ergs s cm^{-1}) isresponsible for a deep absorption feature in the unresolved transition array ofthe fe m-shell and for several absorption lines in the ovi-viii band; a higherionisation phase with logxi~3 ergs s cm^{-1} is required to fit absorption inthe neix-x band. the ionisation state and the column density of the gas presentmoderate variation from 2001 to 2005 for both phases. the high ionisationcomponent of the warm absorber has no effect in the fe k band. no significantvelocity shift of the absorption lines is measured in the rgs data. remarkably,the 2005 spectra show emission features consistent with photoionisation in ahigh density (n_e&gt;10^{11} cm^{-3}) gas: a prominent ovii line triplet isclearly observed in january 2005 and narrow radiative recombination continua(rrc) of ovii and cvi are observed in both 2005 data sets. a broad gaussianline around 21.7 angstrom is also required to fit all the data sets. thederived radial distance for the emission lines seems to suggest that thephotoionisation takes place within the optical broad line region of the source.

1005.4807	fading hard x-ray emission from the galactic centre molecular cloud sgr  b2	the centre of our galaxy harbours a 4 million solar mass black hole that isunusually quiet: its present x-ray luminosity is more than 10 orders ofmagnitude less than its eddington luminosity. the observation of ironfluorescence and hard x-ray emission from some of the massive molecular cloudssurrounding the galactic centre has been interpreted as an echo of a pastflare. alternatively, low-energy cosmic rays propagating inside the cloudsmight account for the observed emission, through inverse bremsstrahlung of lowenergy ions or bremsstrahlung emission of low energy electrons. here we reportthe observation of a clear decay of the hard x-ray emission from the molecularcloud sgr b2 during the past 7 years thanks to more than 20 ms of integralexposure. the measured decay time is compatible with the light crossing time ofthe molecular cloud core . such a short timescale rules out inversebremsstrahlung by cosmic-ray ions as the origin of the x ray emission. we alsoobtained 2-100 kev broadband x-ray spectra by combining integral and xmm-newtondata and compared them with detailed models of x-ray emission due toirradiation of molecular gas by (i) low-energy cosmic-ray electrons and (ii)hard x-rays. both models can reproduce the data equally well, but the timevariability constraints and the huge cosmic ray electron luminosity required toexplain the observed hard x-ray emission strongly favor the scenario in whichthe diffuse emission of sgr b2 is scattered and reprocessed radiation emittedin the past by sgr a*. using recent parallax measurements that place sgr b2 infront of sgr a*, we find that the period of intense activity of sgr a* endedbetween 75 and 155 years ago.

1007.4762	fero: finding extreme relativistic objects. i. statistics of  relativistic fe kalpha lines in radio-quiet type 1 agn	accretion models predict that fluorescence lines broadened by relativisticeffects should arise from reflection of x-ray emission onto the inner region ofthe accretion disc surrounding the central black hole of active galactic nuclei(agn). the theory behind the origin of relativistic lines is well established,and observational evidence from a moderate number of sources seems to supportthe existence of these lines. the aim of this work is to establish the fractionof agn with relativistic fe kalpha lines, and study possible correlations withsource physical properties. an xmm-newton collection of 149 radio-quiet type 1agn has been systematically and uniformly analyzed in order to search forsignificant evidence of a relativistically broadened fe kalpha line. to enablestatistical studies, an almost complete, flux-limited subsample of 31 sourceshas been defined. the 2-10 kev spectra of the fero sources have been comparedwith a complex model including most of the physical components observed in thex-ray spectra of seyfert galaxies: a power law primary continuum modified bynon-relativistic compton reflection and warm absorption, plus a series ofnarrow fe line reflection features. the observed fraction of sources in theflux-limited sample that show significant evidence of a relativistic fe kalphaline is 36%. the average line equivalent width (ew) is of the order of 100 ev,while the average disc inclination angle is 28+/-5 deg and the averagepower-law index of the radial disc emissivity law is 2.4+/-0.4. the spin valueis well constrained only in 2 cases (mcg-6-30-15 and mrk509), and in the restof the cases, whenever a constraint can be placed, it always implies therejection of the static black hole solution. the fe kalpha line ew does notcorrelate with disc parameters or with system physical properties, such asblack hole mass, accretion rate and hard x-ray luminosity.

1201.0196	discovery of a relation between black hole mass and soft x-ray time lags  in active galactic nuclei	we carried out a systematic analysis of time lags between x-ray energy bandsin a large sample (32 sources) of unabsorbed, radio quiet active galacticnuclei (agn), observed by xmm-newton. the analysis of x-ray lags (up to thehighest/shortest frequencies/time-scales), is performed in thefourier-frequency domain, between energy bands where the soft excess (softband) and the primary power law (hard band) dominate the emission. we report atotal of 15 out of 32 sources displaying a high frequency soft lag in theirlight curves. all 15 are at a significance level exceeding 97 per cent and 11are at a level exceeding 99 per cent. of these soft lags, 7 have not beenpreviously reported in the literature, thus this work significantly increasesthe number of known sources with a soft/negative lag. the characteristictime-scales of the soft/negative lag are relatively short (with typicalfrequencies and amplitudes of \nu\sim 0.07-4 \times 10^{-3} hz and \tau\sim10-600 s, respectively), and show a highly significant (\gsim 4\sigma)correlation with the black hole mass. the measured correlations indicate thatsoft lags are systematically shifted to lower frequencies and higher absoluteamplitudes as the mass of the source increases. to first approximation, all thesources in the sample are consistent with having similar mass-scaled lagproperties. these results strongly suggest the existence of a mass-scaling lawfor the soft/negative lag, that holds for agn spanning a large range of masses(about 2.5 orders of magnitude), thus supporting the idea that soft lagsoriginate in the innermost regions of agn and are powerful tools for testingtheir physics and geometry.

1201.4172	ubiquitous equatorial accretion disc winds in black hole soft states	high resolution spectra of galactic black holes (gbh) reveal the presence ofhighly ionised absorbers. in one gbh, accreting close to the eddington limitfor more than a decade, a powerful accretion disc wind is observed to bepresent in softer x-ray states and it has been suggested that it can carry awayenough mass and energy to quench the radio jet. here we report that thesewinds, which may have mass outflow rates of the order of the inner accretionrate or higher, are an ubiquitous component of the jet-free soft states of allgbh. we furthermore demonstrate that these winds have an equatorial geometrywith opening angles of few tens of degrees, and so are only observed in sourcesin which the disc is inclined at a large angle to the line of sight. thedecrease in fe xxv / fe xxvi line ratio with compton temperature, observed inthe soft state, suggests a link between higher wind ionisation and harderspectral shapes. although the physical interaction between the wind, accretionflow and jet is still not fully understood, the mass flux and power of thesewinds, and their presence ubiquitously during the soft x-ray states suggeststhey are fundamental components of the accretion phenomenon.

1203.5959	multiwavelength campaign on mrk 509 ix. the galactic foreground	the diffuse gas in and nearby the milky way plays an important role in theevolution of the entire galaxy. it has a complex structure characterized byneutral, weakly and highly ionized gas, dust, and molecules. we probe this gasthrough the observation of its absorption lines in the high-energy spectra ofbackground sources. we use high-quality spectra of agn mrk 509, located at highgalactic latitudes obtained with xmm-newton, hst and fuse. we use advancedabsorption models consisting of photo- and collisional-ionization. we constrainthe column density ratios of the different phases of the interstellar medium(ism) and measure the abundances of c, n, o, ne, mg, al, si, s, and fe. wedetect seven discrete interstellar clouds with different velocities. one is atypical low-velocity cloud (lvc) and three belong to the family of theintermediate-velocity clouds (ivcs) found near the galactic disk. these fourclouds show large deviation from solar abundances in the gas phase, mostlycaused by dust depletion. the other three clouds are ionized high-velocityclouds (hvcs) and are located either in the galactic environment or in thelocal group halo as suggested by the signatures of collisional ionization. thesimilar abundances and ionization structure of the hvcs suggest a commonlocation and origin: they might belong to the remainder of an extragalacticcloud which was captured by the galaxy. we have shown that combined uv / x-rayspectroscopy is a powerful tool to investigate the ism. in common galacticclouds, like lvcs and ivcs, the ism shows a complex structure consisting of atleast three different temperature phases.

1205.2559	multiwavelength campaign on mrk 509 x. lower limit on the distance of  the absorber from hst cos and stis spectroscopy	active galactic nuclei often show evidence of photoionized outflows. a majoruncertainty in models for these outflows is the distance ($r$) to the gas fromthe central black hole. in this paper we use the hst/cos data from a massivemulti-wavelength monitoring campaign on the bright seyfert i galaxy mrk 509, incombination with archival hst/stis data, to constrain the location of thevarious kinematic components of the outflow. we compare the expected responseof the photoionized gas to changes in ionizing flux with the changes measuredin the data using the following steps: 1) we compare the column densities ofeach kinematic component measured in the 2001 stis data with those measured inthe 2009 cos data; 2) we use time-dependent photionization calculations with aset of simulated lightcurves to put statistical upper limits on the hydrogennumber density that are consistent with the observed small changes in the ioniccolumn densities; 3) from the upper limit on the number density, we calculate alower limit on the distance to the absorber from the central source via theprior determination of the ionization parameter. our method offers twoimprovements on traditional timescale analysis. first, we account for thephysical behavior of agn lightcurves. second, our analysis accounts for thequality of measurement in cases where no changes are observed in the absorptiontroughs. the very small variations in trough ionic column densities (mostlyconsistent with no change) between the 2001 and 2009 epochs allow us to putstatistical lower limits on the distance between 100--200 pc for all the majoruv absorption components at a confidence level of 99%. these results are mainlyconsistent with the independent distance estimates derived for the warmabsorbers from the simultaneous x-ray spectra.

0712.1906	suzaku observations of markarian 335: evidence for a distributed  reflector	we report on a 151 ks net exposure suzaku observation of the narrow lineseyfert 1 galaxy mrk 335. the 0.5-40 kev spectrum contains a broad fe line, astrong soft excess below about 2 kev and a compton hump around 20-30 kev. wefind that a model consisting of a power law and two reflectors provides thebest fit to the time-averaged spectrum. in this model, an ionized, heavilyblurred, inner reflector produces most of the soft excess, while an almostneutral outer reflector (outside ~40 r_g) produces most of the fe lineemission. the spectral variability of the observation is characterised byspectral hardening at very low count rates. in terms of our power-law +two-reflector model it seems like this hardening is mainly caused by pivotingof the power law. the rms spectrum of the entire observation has the curvedshape commonly observed in agn, although the shape is significantly flatterwhen an interval which does not contain any deep dip in the lightcurve isconsidered. we also examine a previous 133 ks xmm-newton observation of mrk335. we find that the xmm-newton spectrum can be fitted with a similartwo-reflector model as the suzaku data and we confirm that the rms spectrum ofthe observation is flat. the flat rms spectra, as well as the high-energy datafrom the suzaku pin detector, disfavour an absorption origin for the softexcess in mrk 335.

1306.2330	the hot and energetic universe: astrophysics of feedback in local agn	understanding the astrophysics of feedback in active galactic nuclei (agn) iskey to understanding the growth and co-evolution of supermassive black holesand galaxies. agn-driven winds/outflows are potentially the most effective wayof transporting energy and momentum from the nuclear scales to the host galaxy,quenching star formation by sweeping away the gas reservoir. key questions inthis field are: 1) how do accretion disks around black holes launchwinds/outflows, and how much energy do these carry? 2) how are the energy andmetals accelerated in winds/outflows transferred and deposited into thecircumgalactic medium? x-ray observations are a unique way to address thesequestions because they probe the phase of the outflows which carries most ofthe kinetic energy. we show how a high throughput, high spectral resolutioninstrument like the x-ray integral field unit (x-ifu) on athena+ will allow usto address these questions by determining the physical parameters (ionizationstate, density, temperature, abundances, velocities, geometry, etc.) of theoutflows on a dynamical time-scale, in a broad sample of nearby bright agn. thex-ifu will also allow direct spectral imaging of the impact of these winds onthe host galaxy for local agn, forming a template for understanding agn athigher redshifts where wind shocks cannot be resolved.

1307.3954	echoes of multiple outbursts of sagittarius a* revealed by chandra	the relatively rapid spatial and temporal variability of the x-ray radiationfrom some molecular clouds near the galactic center shows that this emissioncomponent is due to the reflection of x-rays generated by a source that wasluminous in the past, most likely the central supermassive black hole,sagittarius a*. studying the evolution of the molecular cloud reflectionfeatures is therefore a key element to reconstruct sgr a*'s past activity. theaim of the present work is to study this emission on small angular scales inorder to characterize the source outburst on short time scales. we use chandrahigh-resolution data collected from 1999 to 2011 to study the most rapidvariations detected so far, those of clouds between 5' and 20' from sgr a*towards positive longitudes. our systematic spectral-imaging analysis of thereflection emission, notably of the fe kalpha line at 6.4 kev and itsassociated 4-8 kev continuum, allows us to characterize the variations down to15" angular scale and 1-year time scale. we reveal for the first time abruptvariations of few years only and in particular a short peaked emission, with afactor of 10 increase followed by a comparable decrease, that propagates alongthe dense filaments of the bridge cloud. this 2-year peaked feature contrastswith the slower 10-year linear variations we reveal in all the other molecularstructures of the region. based on column density constraints, we argue thatthese two different behaviors are unlikely to be due to the same illuminatingevent. the variations are likely due to a highly variable active phase of sgra* sometime within the past few hundred years, characterized by at least twoluminous outbursts of a few-year time scale and during which the sgr a*luminosity went up to at least 10^39 erg/s.

1310.0042	time lags in the ultraluminous x-ray source ngc 5408 x-1: implications  for the black hole mass	we present the analysis of the x-ray variability and spectral timingproperties of the ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx) ngc 5408 x-1, one of themost variable ulxs known so far. the variability properties are used as adiagnostic of the accretion state of the source and to derive estimates of theblack hole (bh) mass. the observed high level of fast x-ray variability(fractional root-mean-square variability - rms - amplitude of $\sim$ 30 percentin the hard energy band), the hardening of the fractional rms spectrum, and theproperties of the qpo, all resemble those of a source in a hard-intermediateaccretion state. we confirm the previous detection of a soft lag in the x-raylight curves of the source during 2006 and 2008 observations and find that thesoft lag is still present in the more recent 2010/2011 observations. using theentire available xmm-newton data set (public as of february 2012) we observethat the soft lag (of few seconds amplitude) is detected over a relativelylarge range of frequencies ($\nu \sim 5-90$ mhz), which always includes the qpofrequencies. the soft lag displays energy-dependence, with the (absolute)amplitude increasing as a function of energy separation. we find closeanalogies with soft lags associated to type-c qpos in bh binary systems(although an association to other types of qpos cannot be completely excluded),as well as with reverberation lags observed in agn. in both cases anintermediate mass bh (imbh) solution appears the most plausible.

1404.3863	multiwavelength campaign on mrk 509. xiii. testing ionized-reflection  models on mrk 509	active galactic nuclei (agn) are the most luminous persistent objects in theuniverse. an excess of x-ray emission below about 2 kev, called soft-excess, isvery common in type 1 agn spectra. the origin of this feature remains debated.originally modeled with a blackbody, there are now several possibilities tomodel the soft-excess, including warm comptonization and blurred ionizedreflection. in this paper, we test ionized-reflection models on mrk 509, abright seyfert 1 galaxy for which we have a unique data set, in order todetermine whether it can be responsible for the strong soft-excess. we use tensimultaneous xmm-newton and integral observations performed every four days. wepresent here the results of the spectral analysis, the evolution of theparameters and the variability properties of the x-ray emission. theapplication of blurred ionized-reflection models leads to a very strongreflection and an extreme geometry, but fails to reproduce the broad-bandspectrum of mrk 509. two different scenarios for blurred ionized reflection arediscussed: stable geometry and lamp-post configuration. in both cases we findthat the model parameters do not follow the expected relations, indicating thatthe model is fine-tuned to fit the data without physical justification. alarge, slow variation of the soft-excess without counterpart in the hard x-rayscould be explained by a change in ionization of the reflector. however, such achange does not naturally follow from the assumed geometrical configuration.warm comptonization remains the most probable origin of the soft-excess in thisobject. nevertheless, it is possible that both ionized reflection and warmcomptonization mechanisms can explain the soft-excess in all objects, onedominating the other one, depending on the physical conditions of the disk andthe corona.

1503.01307	the x-ray outburst of the galactic centre magnetar sgr j1745-2900 during  the first 1.5 year	in 2013 april a new magnetar, sgr 1745-2900, was discovered as it entered anoutburst, at only 2.4 arcsec angular distance from the supermassive black holeat the centre of the milky way, sagittarius a*. sgr 1745-2900 has a surfacedipolar magnetic field of ~ 2x10^{14} g, and it is the neutron star closest toa black hole ever observed. the new source was detected both in the radio andx-ray bands, with a peak x-ray luminosity l_x ~ 5x10^{35} erg s^{-1}. here wereport on the long-term chandra (25 observations) and xmm-newton (8observations) x-ray monitoring campaign of sgr 1745-2900, from the onset of theoutburst in april 2013 until september 2014. this unprecedented dataset allowsus to refine the timing properties of the source, as well as to study theoutburst spectral evolution as a function of time and rotational phase. ourtiming analysis confirms the increase in the spin period derivative by a factorof ~2 around june 2013, and reveals that a further increase occurred between2013 oct 30 and 2014 feb 21. we find that the period derivative changed from6.6x10^{-12} s s^{-1} to 3.3x10^{-11} s s^{-1} in 1.5 yr. on the other hand,this magnetar shows a slow flux decay compared to other magnetars and a ratherinefficient surface cooling. in particular, starquake-induced crustal coolingmodels alone have difficulty in explaining the high luminosity of the sourcefor the first ~200 days of its outburst, and additional heating of the starsurface from currents flowing in a twisted magnetic bundle is probably playingan important role in the outburst evolution.

1503.04870	a tidal disruption flare in a massive galaxy? implications for the  fuelling mechanisms of nuclear black holes	we argue that the `changing look' agn recently reported by lamassa et al.could be a luminous flare produced by the tidal disruption of a super-solarmass star passing just a few gravitational radii outside the event horizon of a$\sim 10^8 m_{\odot}$ nuclear black hole. this flare occurred in a massive,star forming galaxy at redshift $z=0.312$, robustly characterized thanks torepeated late-time photometric and spectroscopic observations. by takingdifference-photometry of the well sampled multi-year sdss stripe-82light-curve, we are able to probe the evolution of the nuclear spectrum overthe course of the outburst. the tidal disruption event (tde) interpretation isconsistent with the very rapid rise and the decay time of the flare, whichdisplays an evolution consistent with the well-known $t^{-5/3}$ behaviour (witha clear superimposed re-brightening flare). our analysis places constraints onthe physical properties of the tde, such as the putative disrupted star's massand orbital parameters, as well as the size and temperature of the emittingmaterial. the properties of the broad and narrow emission lines observed in twoepochs of sdss spectra provide further constraints on the circum-nuclearstructure, and could be indicative that the system hosted a moderate-luminosityagn as recently as a few $10^4$ years ago, and is likely undergoing residualaccretion as late as ten years after peak, as seen from the broad h$\alpha$emission line. we discuss the complex interplay between tidal disruption eventsand gas accretion episodes in galactic nuclei, highlighting the implicationsfor future tde searches and for estimates of their intrinsic rates.

1505.02562	anatomy of the agn in ngc 5548 iv. the short-term variability of the  outflows	during an extensive multiwavelength campaign that we performed in 2013-14 theprototypical seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 has been found in an unusual conditionof heavy and persistent obscuration. the newly discovered "obscurer" absorbsmost of the soft x-ray continuum along our line of sight and lowers theionizing luminosity received by the classical warm absorber. here we presentthe analysis of the high resolution x-ray spectra collected with xmm-newton andchandra throughout the campaign, which are suitable to investigate thevariability of both the obscurer and the classical warm absorber. the timeseparation between these x-ray observations range from 2 days to 8 months. onthese timescales the obscurer is variable both in column density and incovering fraction. this is consistent with the picture of a patchy wind. themost significant variation occurred in september 2013 when the sourcebrightened for two weeks. a higher and steeper intrinsic continuum and a lowerobscurer covering fraction are both required to explain the spectral shapeduring the flare. we suggest that a geometrical change of the soft x-ray sourcebehind the obscurer cause the observed drop in the covering fraction. due tothe higher soft x-ray continuum level the september 2013 chandra spectrum isthe only x ray spectrum of the campaign where individual features of the warmabsorber could be detected. the spectrum shows absorption from fe-uta,\ion{o}{iv}, and \ion{o}{v}, consistent to belong to the lower-ionizationcounterpart of the historical ngc 5548 warm absorber. hence, we confirm thatthe warm absorber has responded to the drop in the ionizing luminosity causedby the obscurer.

1507.02690	fifteen years of xmm-newton and chandra monitoring of sgr a*: evidence  for a recent increase in the bright flaring rate	we present a study of the x-ray flaring activity of sgr a* during all the 150xmm-newton and chandra observations pointed at the milky way center over thelast 15 years. this includes the latest xmm-newton and chandra campaignsdevoted to monitoring the closest approach of the very red br-gamma emittingobject called g2. the entire dataset analysed extends from september 1999through november 2014. we employed a bayesian block analysis to investigate anypossible variations in the characteristics (frequency, energetics, peakintensity, duration) of the flaring events that sgr a* has exhibited sincetheir discovery in 2001. we observe that the total bright-or-very bright flareluminosity of sgr a* increased between 2013-2014 by a factor of 2-3 (~3.5 sigmasignificance). we also observe an increase (~99.9% significance) from0.27+-0.04 to 2.5+-1.0 day^-1 of the bright-or-very bright flaring rate of sgra*, starting in late summer 2014, which happens to be about six months afterg2's peri-center passage. this might indicate that clustering is a generalproperty of bright flares and that it is associated with a stationary noiseprocess producing flares not uniformly distributed in time (similar to what isobserved in other quiescent black holes). if so, the variation in flaringproperties would be revealed only now because of the increased monitoringfrequency. alternatively, this may be the first sign of an excess accretionactivity induced by the close passage of g2. more observations are necessary todistinguish between these two hypotheses.

1509.00043	the evolution of the disc variability along the hard state of the black  hole transient gx 339-4	we report on the analysis of hard-state power spectral density function (psd)of gx 339-4 down to the soft x-ray band, where the disc significantlycontributes to the total emission. at any luminosity probed, the disc in thehard state is intrinsically more variable than in the soft state. however, thefast decrease of disc variability as a function of luminosity, combined withthe increase of disc intensity, causes a net drop of fractional variability athigh luminosities and low energies, which reminds the well-known behaviour ofdisc-dominated energy bands in the soft state. the peak-frequency of thehigh-frequency lorentzian (likely corresponding to the high-frequency breakseen in active galactic nuclei, agn) scales with luminosity, but we do not findevidence for a linear scaling. in addition, we observe that this characteristicfrequency is energy-dependent. we find that the normalization of the psd at thepeak of the high-frequency lorentzian decreases with luminosity at allenergies, though in the soft band this trend is steeper. together with thefrequency shift, this yields quasi-constant high frequency (5-20 hz) fractionalrms at high energies, with less than 10 percent scatter. this reinforcesprevious claims suggesting that the high frequency psd solely scales with bhmass. on the other hand, this constancy breaks down in the soft band (where thescatter increases to ~30 percent). this is a consequence of the additionalcontribution from the disc component, and resembles the behaviour of opticalvariability in agn.

1510.02798	tracing the reverberation lag in the hard state of black hole x-ray  binaries	we report results obtained from a systematic analysis of x-ray lags in asample of black hole x-ray binaries, with the aim of assessing the presence ofreverberation lags and studying their evolution during outburst. we usedxmm-newton and simultaneous rxte observations to obtain broad-band energycoverage of both the disc and the hard x-ray comptonization components. in mostcases the detection of reverberation lags is hampered by low levels ofvariability signal-to-noise ratio (e.g. typically when the source is in a softstate) and/or short exposure times. the most detailed study was possible for gx339-4 in the hard state, which allowed us to characterize the evolution ofx-ray lags as a function of luminosity in a single source. over all the sampledfrequencies (~0.05-9 hz) we observe the hard lags intrinsic to the power lawcomponent, already well-known from previous rxte studies. the xmm-newton softx-ray response allows us to detail the disc variability. at low-frequencies(long time scales) the disc component always leads the power law component. onthe other hand, a soft reverberation lag (ascribable to thermal reprocessing)is always detected at high-frequencies (short time scales). the intrinsicamplitude of the reverberation lag decreases as the source luminosity and thedisc-fraction increase. this suggests that the distance between the x-raysource and the region of the optically-thick disc where reprocessing occurs,gradually decreases as gx 339-4 rises in luminosity through the hard state,possibly as a consequence of reduced disc truncation.

astro-ph;0312250	mapping the inner regions of mcg-6-30-15 with xmm-newton	timing analysis of a ~95 ks long xmm-newton observation of the seyfert 1galaxy mcg-6-30-15 is presented. model-independent tools have been used withthe intent of resolving the different components that produce the observed fluxand spectral variations down to timescales as short as ~300 s. we find that thefractional variability is possibly due to a variable power law component in thehard band, and a slower thermal component at softer energies, but the data donot rule out effects due to the warm absorber. the most relevant result of thiswork is the first detection of a significant enhancement of the fractionalvariability in the ~4.7-5.8 kev energy band compared to the underlyingcontinuum. this represents one of the strongest, model-independent, pieces ofevidence to date for the presence of redshifted relativistic matter accretinginto the black hole. during the brightest flare of the observation, asoft-to-hard time lag of ~600 s is measured. a very significant increase of theiron line intensity is observed ~3000 s after this flare. in the framework of adisk-corona model and assuming the soft-to-hard time lag is due tocomptonization, these findings make it possible to estimate the electrondensity and the dimensions of the flare region and the disk-flare distance.

0812.1652	the xmm-newton view of agn with intermediate mass black holes	we have observed with xmm-newton four radiatively efficient active type 1galaxies with black hole masses &lt; 10^6 msun, selected optically from the sdss.we show here that their soft x-ray spectrum exhibits a soft excess with thesame characteristics as that observed ubiquitously in radio-quiet seyfert 1galaxies and type 1 quasars, both in terms of temperatures and strength.however, even when the soft x-ray excess is modelled with a pure thermal disc,its luminosity turns out to be much lower than that expected from accretiontheory for the given temperature, casting further doubts on a thermalinterpretation for soft excesses. while alternative scenarios for the nature ofthe soft excess (namely smeared ionized absorption and disc reflection) cannotbe distinguished on a pure statistical basis, we point out that the absorptionmodel produces a strong correlation between absorbing column density andionization state, which may be difficult to interpret and is most likelyspurious. as for reflection, it does only invoke standard ingredients of anyaccretion model for radiatively efficient sources such as a hard x-rays sourceand a relatively cold (though partially ionized) accretion disc, and thereforeseems the natural choice to explain the soft excess in most (if not all) cases.the reflection model is also consistent with the additional presence of athermal disc component with the theoretically expected temperature (although,again, with smaller-than-expected total luminosity). the observed activegalaxies are among the most variable in x-rays and their excess variance isamong the largest. this is in line with their relatively small black hole massand with expectations from simple power spectra models.
