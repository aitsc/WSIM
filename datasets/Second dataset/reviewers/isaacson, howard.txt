1001.0416	discovery and rossiter-mclaughlin effect of exoplanet kepler-8b	we report the discovery and the rossiter-mclaughlin effect of kepler-8b, atransiting planet identified by the nasa kepler mission. kepler photometry andkeck-hires radial velocities yield the radius and mass of the planet aroundthis f8iv subgiant host star. the planet has a radius rp = 1.419 rj and a mass,mp = 0.60 mj, yielding a density of 0.26 g cm^-3, among the lowest densityplanets known. the orbital period is p = 3.523 days and orbital semima jor axisis 0.0483+0.0006/-0.0012 au. the star has a large rotational v sin i of 10.5+/- 0.7 km s^-1 and is relatively faint (v = 13.89 mag), both propertiesdeleterious to precise doppler measurements. the velocities are indeed noisy,with scatter of 30 m s^-1, but exhibit a period and phase consistent with theplanet implied by the photometry. we securely detect the rossiter-mclaughlineffect, confirming the planet's existence and establishing its orbit asprograde. we measure an inclination between the projected planetary orbitalaxis and the projected stellar rotation axis of lambda = -26.9 +/- 4.6 deg,indicating a moderate inclination of the planetary orbit. rossiter-mclaughlinmeasurements of a large sample of transiting planets from kepler will provide astatistically robust measure of the true distribution of spin-orbitorientations for hot jupiters in general.

1004.2702	a correlation between stellar activity and hot jupiter emission spectra	we present evidence for a correlation between the observed properties of hotjupiter emission spectra and the activity levels of the host stars measuredusing ca ii h &amp; k emission lines. we find that planets with dayside emissionspectra that are well-described by standard 1d atmosphere models with water inabsorption (hd 189733, tres-1, tres-3, wasp-4) orbit chromospherically activestars, while planets with emission spectra that are consistent with thepresence of a strong high-altitude temperature inversion and water in emissionorbit quieter stars. we estimate that active g and k stars have lyman alphafluxes that are typically a factor of 4-7 times higher than quiet stars withanalogous spectral types, and propose that the increased uv flux received byplanets orbiting active stars destroys the compounds responsible for theformation of the observed temperature inversions. in this paper we also derivea model-independent method for differentiating between these two atmospheretypes using the secondary eclipse depths measured in the 3.6 and 4.5 micronbands on the spitzer space telescope, and argue that the observed correlationis independent of the inverted/non-inverted paradigm for classifying hotjupiter atmospheres.

1008.4393	modeling kepler transit light curves as false positives: rejection of  blend scenarios for kepler-9, and validation of kepler-9d, a super-earth-size  planet in a multiple system	light curves from the kepler mission contain valuable information on thenature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. to assist inexploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive,we describe a procedure (blender) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend"rather than a planet orbiting a star. a blend may consist of a background orforeground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuatedby the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometricaperture. we apply blender to the case of kepler-9, a target harboring twopreviously confirmed saturn-size planets (kepler-9b and kepler-9c) showingtransit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59-dayperiod suggesting the presence of a super-earth-size planet. using blendertogether with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to ruleout all blends for the two deeper signals, and provide independent validationof their planetary nature. for the shallower signal we rule out a largefraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. the false alarmrate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknownfrequency of small-size planets. based on several realistic estimates of thisfrequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is dueto a super-earth-size planet (kepler-9d) in a multiple system, rather than afalse positive. the radius is determined to be 1.64 (+0.19/-0.14) r(earth), andcurrent spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish itsmass.

1009.2301	chromospheric activity and jitter measurements for 2630 stars on the  california planet search	we present time series measurements of chromospheric activity for more than2600 main sequence and subgiant stars on the california planet search (cps)program with spectral types ranging from about f5v to m4v for main sequencestars and from g0iv to about k5iv for subgiants. the large data set of morethan 44,000 spectra allows us to identify an empirical baseline floor forchromospheric activity as a function of color and height above the mainsequence. we define $\delta s$ as an excess in emission in the ca ii h\&amp;k linesabove the baseline activity floor and define radial velocity jitter as afunction of $\delta s$ and \bv\ for main sequence and subgiant stars. althoughthe jitter for any individual star can always exceed the baseline level, wefind that k dwarfs have the lowest level of jitter. the lack of correlationbetween observed jitter and chromospheric activity in k dwarfs suggests thatthe observed jitter is dominated by instrumental or analysis errors and notastrophysical noise sources. thus, given the long-term precision for the cpsprogram, radial velocities are not correlated with astrophysical noise forchromospherically quiet k dwarf stars, making these stars particularlywell-suited for the highest precision doppler surveys. chromospherically quietf and g dwarfs and subgiants exhibit higher baseline levels of astrophysicaljitter than k dwarfs. despite the fact that the \rms\ in doppler velocities iscorrelated with the mean chromospheric activity, it is rare to see one-to-onecorrelations between the individual time series activity and dopplermeasurements, diminishing the prospects for correcting activity-inducedvelocity variations.

1102.0605	kepler's first rocky planet: kepler-10b	nasa's kepler mission uses transit photometry to determine the frequency ofearth-size planets in or near the habitable zone of sun-like stars. the missionreached a milestone toward meeting that goal: the discovery of its first rockyplanet, kepler-10b. two distinct sets of transit events were detected: 1) a 152+/- 4 ppm dimming lasting 1.811 +/- 0.024 hours with ephemerist[bjd]=2454964.57375+n*0.837495 days and 2) a 376 +/- 9 ppm dimming lasting6.86 +/- 0.07 hours with ephemeris t[bjd]=2454971.6761+n*45.29485 days.statistical tests on the photometric and pixel flux time series established theviability of the planet candidates triggering ground-based follow-upobservations. forty precision doppler measurements were used to confirm thatthe short-period transit event is due to a planetary companion. the parent staris bright enough for asteroseismic analysis. photometry was collected at1-minute cadence for &gt;4 months from which we detected 19 distinct pulsationfrequencies. modeling the frequencies resulted in precise knowledge of thefundamental stellar properties. kepler-10 is a relatively old (11.9 +/- 4.5gyr) but otherwise sun-like main sequence star with teff=5627 +/- 44 k,mstar=0.895 +/- 0.060 msun, and rstar=1.056 +/- 0.021 rsun. physical modelssimultaneously fit to the transit light curves and the precision dopplermeasurements yielded tight constraints on the properties of kepler-10b thatspeak to its rocky composition: mpl=4.56 +/- 1.29 mearth, rpl=1.416 +/- 0.036rearth, and density=8.8 +/- 2.9 gcc. kepler-10b is the smallest transitingexoplanet discovered to date.

1102.1730	koi-54: the kepler discovery of tidally-excited pulsations and  brightenings in a highly eccentric binary	kepler observations of the star hd 187091 (kid 8112039, hereafter koi-54)revealed a remarkable light curve exhibiting sharp periodic brightening eventsevery 41.8 days with a superimposed set of oscillations forming a beatingpattern in phase with the brightenings. spectroscopic observations revealedthat this is a binary star with a highly eccentric orbit, e=0.83. we are ableto match the kepler light curve and radial velocities with a nearly face-on(i=5.5 degree) binary star model in which the brightening events are caused bytidal distortion and irradiation of nearly identical a stars during their closeperiastron passage. the two dominant oscillations in the light curve,responsible for the beating pattern, have frequencies that are the 91st and90th harmonic of the orbital frequency. the power spectrum of the light curve,after removing the binary star brightening component, reveals a large number ofpulsations, 30 of which have a signal-to-noise ratio &gt; 7. nearly all of thesepulsations have frequencies that are either integer multiples of the orbitalfrequency or are tidally-split multiples of the orbital frequency. this patternof frequencies unambiguously establishes the pulsations as resonances betweenthe dynamic tides at periastron and the free oscillation modes of one of thestars. koi-54 is only the 4th star to show such a phenomenon, and is by far therichest in terms of excited modes.

1103.3896	a first comparison of kepler planet candidates in single and multiple  systems	in this letter we present an overview of the rich population of systems withmultiple candidate transiting planets found in the first four months of keplerdata. the census of multiples includes 115 targets that show 2 candidateplanets, 45 with 3, 8 with 4, and 1 each with 5 and 6, for a total of 170systems with 408 candidates. when compared to the 827 systems with only onecandidate, the multiples account for 17 percent of the total number of systems,and a third of all the planet candidates. we compare the characteristics ofcandidates found in multiples with those found in singles. false positives dueto eclipsing binaries are much less common for the multiples, as expected.singles and multiples are both dominated by planets smaller than neptune; 69+2/-3 percent for singles and 86 +2/-5 percent for multiples. this result, thatsystems with multiple transiting planets are less likely to include atransiting giant planet, suggests that close-in giant planets tend to disruptthe orbital inclinations of small planets in flat systems, or maybe even toprevent the formation of such systems in the first place.

1109.1561	the kepler-19 system: a transiting 2.2 r_earth planet and a second  planet detected via transit timing variations	we present the discovery of the kepler-19 planetary system, which we firstidentified from a 9.3-day periodic transit signal in the kepler photometry.from high-resolution spectroscopy of the star, we find a stellar effectivetemperature teff=5541 \pm 60 k, a metallicity [fe/h]=-0.13 \pm 0.06, and asurface gravity log(g)=4.59 \pm 0.10. we combine the estimate of teff and[fe/h] with an estimate of the stellar density derived from the photometriclight curve to deduce a stellar mass of m_star = 0.936 \pm 0.040 m_sun and astellar radius of r_star = 0.850 \pm 0.018 r_sun. we rule out the possibilitythat the transits result from an astrophysical false positive by firstidentifying the subset of stellar blends that reproduce the precise shape ofthe light curve. we conclude that the planetary scenario is more than threeorders of magnitude more likely than a blend. the blend scenario isindependently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: we measure atransit depth with spitzer at 4.5 {\mu}m of 547+113-110 ppm, consistent withthe depth measured in the kepler optical bandpass of 567\pm6 ppm. we determinea physical radius of the planet kepler-19b of r_p = 2.209 \pm 0.048 r_earth.from radial-velocity observations of the star, we find an upper limit on theplanet mass of 20.3 m_earth, corresponding to a maximum density of 10.4 gcm^-3. we report a significant sinusoidal deviation of the transit times from apredicted linear ephemeris, which we conclude is due to an additionalperturbing body in the system. we cannot uniquely determine the orbitalparameters of the perturber, as various dynamical mechanisms match theamplitude, period, and shape of the transit timing signal and satisfy the hoststar's radial velocity limits. however, the perturber in these mechanisms hasperiod &lt;160 days and mass &lt;6 m_jup, confirming its planetary nature askepler-19c.

1109.1611	discovery and atmospheric characterization of giant planet kepler-12b:  an inflated radius outlier	we report the discovery of planet kepler-12b (koi-20), which at 1.695\pm0.030rj is among the handful of planets with super-inflated radii above 1.65 rj.orbiting its slightly evolved g0 host with a 4.438-day period, this0.431\pm0.041 mj planet is the least-irradiated within thislargest-planet-radius group, which has important implications for planetaryphysics. the planet's inflated radius and low mass lead to a very low densityof 0.111\pm0.010 g cm-3. we detect the occultation of the planet at asignificance of 3.7{\sigma} in the kepler bandpass. this yields a geometricalbedo of 0.14\pm0.04; the planetary flux is due to a combination of scatteredlight and emitted thermal flux. we use multiple observations with warm spitzerto detect the occultation at 7{\sigma} and 4{\sigma} in the 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}mbandpasses, respectively. the occultation photometry timing is consistent witha circular orbit, at e &lt; 0.01 (1{\sigma}), and e &lt; 0.09 (3{\sigma}). theoccultation detections across the three bands favor an atmospheric model withno dayside temperature inversion. the kepler occultation detection providessignificant leverage, but conclusions regarding temperature structure arepreliminary, given our ignorance of opacity sources at optical wavelengths inhot jupiter atmospheres. if kepler-12b and hd 209458b, which intercept similarincident stellar fluxes, have the same heavy element masses, the interiorenergy source needed to explain the large radius of kepler-12b is three timeslarger than that of hd 209458b. this may suggest that more than oneradius-inflation mechanism is at work for kepler-12b, or that it is lessheavy-element rich than other transiting planets.

1112.4514	kepler-20: a sun-like star with three sub-neptune exoplanets and two  earth-size candidates	we present the discovery of the kepler-20 planetary system, which weinitially identified through the detection of five distinct periodic transitsignals in the kepler light curve of the host star 2massj19104752+4220194. wefind a stellar effective temperature teff=5455+-100k, a metallicity of[fe/h]=0.01+-0.04, and a surface gravity of log(g)=4.4+-0.1. combined with anestimate of the stellar density from the transit light curves we deduce astellar mass of mstar=0.912+-0.034 msun and a stellar radius ofrstar=0.944^{+0.060}_{-0.095} rsun. for three of the transit signals, ourresults strongly disfavor the possibility that these result from astrophysicalfalse positives. we conclude that the planetary scenario is more likely thanthat of an astrophysical false positive by a factor of 2e5 (kepler-20b), 1e5(kepler-20c), and 1.1e3 (kepler-20d), sufficient to validate these objects asplanetary companions. for kepler-20c and kepler-20d, the blend scenario isindependently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: from spitzer datagathered at 4.5um, we infer a ratio of the planetary to stellar radii of0.075+-0.015 (kepler-20c) and 0.065+-0.011 (kepler-20d), consistent with eachof the depths measured in the kepler optical bandpass. we determine the orbitalperiods and physical radii of the three confirmed planets to be 3.70d and1.91^{+0.12}_{-0.21} rearth for kepler-20b, 10.85 d and 3.07^{+0.20}_{-0.31}rearth for kepelr-20c, and 77.61 d and 2.75^{+0.17}_{-0.30} rearth forkepler-20d. from multi-epoch radial velocities, we determine the masses ofkepler-20b and kepler-20c to be 8.7\+-2.2 mearth and 16.1+-3.5 mearth,respectively, and we place an upper limit on the mass of kepler-20d of 20.1mearth (2 sigma).

1201.5409	transit timing observations from kepler: ii. confirmation of two  multiplanet systems via a non-parametric correlation analysis	we present a new method for confirming transiting planets based on thecombination of transit timingn variations (ttvs) and dynamical stability.correlated ttvs provide evidence that the pair of bodies are in the samephysical system. orbital stability provides upper limits for the masses of thetransiting companions that are in the planetary regime. this paper describes anon-parametric technique for quantifying the statistical significance of ttvsbased on the correlation of two ttv data sets. we apply this method to ananalysis of the transit timing variations of two stars with multiple transitingplanet candidates identified by kepler. we confirm four transiting planets intwo multiple planet systems based on their ttvs and the constraints imposed bydynamical stability. an additional three candidates in these same systems arenot confirmed as planets, but are likely to be validated as real planets oncefurther observations and analyses are possible. if all were confirmed, thesesystems would be near 4:6:9 and 2:4:6:9 period commensurabilities. our resultsdemonstrate that ttvs provide a powerful tool for confirming transitingplanets, including low-mass planets and planets around faint stars for whichdoppler follow-up is not practical with existing facilities. continued keplerobservations will dramatically improve the constraints on the planet masses andorbits and provide sensitivity for detecting additional non-transiting planets.if kepler observations were extended to eight years, then a similar analysiscould likely confirm systems with multiple closely spaced, small transitingplanets in or near the habitable zone of solar-type stars.

1202.5852	planetary candidates observed by kepler, iii: analysis of the first 16  months of data	new transiting planet candidates are identified in sixteen months (may 2009 -september 2010) of data from the kepler spacecraft. nearly five thousandperiodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumentalfalse positives yielding 1,091 viable new planet candidates, bringing the totalcount up to over 2,300. improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing tohigher catalog reliability. most notable is the noise-weighted robust averagingof multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysiswhich identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. twenty-two months ofphotometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the newcandidates. ephemerides (transit epoch, t_0, and orbital period, p) aretabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius(rp/r*), reduced semi-major axis (d/r*), and impact parameter (b). the largestfractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (197% forcandidates smaller than 2re compared to 52% for candidates larger than 2re) andthose at longer orbital periods (123% for candidates outside of 50-day orbitsversus 85% for candidates inside of 50-day orbits). the gains are larger thanexpected from increasing the observing window from thirteen months (quarter 1--quarter 5) to sixteen months (quarter 1 -- quarter 6). this demonstrates thebenefit of continued development of pipeline analysis software. the fraction ofall host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17% to 20%, and thepaucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. theprogression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each newcatalog release suggests that earth-size planets in the habitable zone areforthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.

1204.3955	the transiting circumbinary planets kepler-34 and kepler-35	most sun-like stars in the galaxy reside in gravitationally-bound pairs ofstars called "binary stars". while long anticipated, the existence of a"circumbinary planet" orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitivelyestablished until the discovery of kepler-16. incontrovertible evidence wasprovided by the miniature eclipses ("transits") of the stars by the planet.however, questions remain about the prevalence of circumbinary planets andtheir range of orbital and physical properties. here we present two additionaltransiting circumbinary planets, kepler-34 and kepler-35. each is a low-densitygas giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars.kepler-34 orbits two sun-like stars every 289 days, while kepler-35 orbits apair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the sun's mass) every 131 days. due tothe orbital motion of the stars, the planets experience large multi-periodicvariations in incident stellar radiation. the observed rate of circumbinaryplanets implies &gt; ~1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearlycoplanar orbits, yielding a galactic population of at least several million.

1301.6289	the stellar obliquity and the long-period planet in the hat-p-17  exoplanetary system	we present the measured projected obliquity -- the sky-projected anglebetween the stellar spin axis and orbital angular momentum -- of the innerplanet of the hat-p-17 multi-planet system. we measure the sky-projectedobliquity of the star to be \lambda=19+/-15 degrees by modeling therossiter-mclaughlin (rm) effect in keck/hires radial velocities (rvs). theanomalous rv time series shows an asymmetry relative to the midtransit time,ordinarily suggesting a nonzero obliquity -- but in this case at least part ofthe asymmetry may be due to the convective blueshift, increasing theuncertainty in the determination of \lambda. we employ the semi-analyticalapproach of hirano et al. (2011) that includes the effects of macroturbulence,instrumental broadening, and convective blueshift to accurately model theanomaly in the net rv caused by the planet eclipsing part of the rotating star.obliquity measurements are an important tool for testing theories of planetformation and migration. to date, the measured obliquities of ~50 jovianplanets span the full range, from prograde to retrograde, with planets orbitingcool stars preferentially showing alignment of stellar spins and planetaryorbits. our results are consistent with this pattern emerging from tidalinteractions in the convective envelopes of cool stars and close-in planets. inaddition, our 1.8 years of new rvs for this system show that the orbit of theouter planet is more poorly constrained than previously thought, with anorbital period now in the range of 10-36 years.

1302.2624	fundamental properties of kepler planet-candidate host stars using  asteroseismology	we have used asteroseismology to determine fundamental properties for 66kepler planet-candidate host stars, with typical uncertainties of 3% and 7% inradius and mass, respectively. the results include new asteroseismic solutionsfor four host stars with confirmed planets (kepler-4, kepler-14, kepler-23 andkepler-25) and increase the total number of kepler host stars withasteroseismic solutions to 77. a comparison with stellar properties in theplanet-candidate catalog by batalha et al. shows that radii for subgiants andgiants obtained from spectroscopic follow-up are systematically too low by upto a factor of 1.5, while the properties for unevolved stars are in goodagreement. we furthermore apply asteroseismology to confirm that a largemajority of cool main-sequence hosts are indeed dwarfs and not misclassifiedgiants. using the revised stellar properties, we recalculate the radii for 107planet candidates in our sample, and comment on candidates for which the radiichange from a previously giant-planet/brown-dwarf/stellar regime to asub-jupiter size, or vice versa. a comparison of stellar densities fromasteroseismology with densities derived from transit models in batalha et al.assuming circular orbits shows significant disagreement for more than half ofthe sample due to systematics in the modeled impact parameters, or due toplanet candidates which may be in eccentric orbits. finally, we investigatetentative correlations between host-star masses and planet candidate radii,orbital periods, and multiplicity, but caution that these results may beinfluenced by the small sample size and detection biases.

1302.4443	low stellar obliquities in compact multiplanet systems	we measure the sky-projected stellar obliquities (\lambda) in themultiple-transiting planetary systems koi-94 and kepler-25, using therossiter-mclaughlin effect. in both cases the host stars are well-aligned withthe orbital planes of the planets. for koi-94 we find \lambda=-11+-11 deg,confirming a recent result by hirano and coworkers. kepler-25 was a morechallenging case because the transit depth is unusually small (0.13 %). toobtain the obliquity it was necessary to use prior knowledge of the star'sprojected rotation rate, and apply two different analysis methods toindependent wavelength regions of the spectra. the two methods gave consistentresults, \lambda=7+-8 deg and -0.5+-5.7 deg.  there are now a total of five obliquity measurements for host stars ofsystems of multiple transiting planets, all of which are consistent withspin-orbit alignment. this alignment is unlikely to be the result of tidalinteractions, because of the relatively large orbital distances and lowplanetary masses in the systems. in this respect the multiplanet host starsdiffer from hot-jupiter host stars, which commonly have large spin-orbitmisalignments whenever tidal interactions are weak. in particular the weak-tidesubset of hot-jupiter hosts have obliquities consistent with an isotropicdistribution (p=0.6), but the multiplanet hosts are incompatible with such adistribution (p~10^-6). this suggests that high obliquities are confined tohot-jupiter systems, and provides further evidence that hot jupiter formationinvolves processes that tilt the planetary orbit.

1303.2150	the mass of koi-94d and a relation for planet radius, mass, and incident  flux	we measure the mass of a modestly irradiated giant planet, koi-94d. we wishto determine whether this planet, which is in a 22-day orbit and receives 2700times as much incident flux as jupiter, is as dense as jupiter or rarefied likeinflated hot jupiters. koi-94 also hosts 3 smaller transiting planets, all ofwhich were detected by the kepler mission. with 26 radial velocities of koi-94from the w. m. keck observatory and a simultaneous fit to the kepler lightcurve, we measure the mass of the giant planet and determine that it is notinflated. support for the planetary interpretation of the other threecandidates comes from gravitational interactions through transit timingvariations, the statistical robustness of multi-planet systems against falsepositives, and several lines of evidence that no other star resides within thephotometric aperture. the radial velocity analyses of koi-94b and koi-94e offermarginal (&gt;2\sigma) mass detections, whereas the observations of koi-94c offeronly an upper limit to its mass. using the koi-94 system and other planets withpublished values for both mass and radius (138 exoplanets total, including 35with m &lt; 150 earth masses), we establish two fundamental planes for exoplanetsthat relate their mass, incident flux, and radius from a few earth masses up toten jupiter masses. these equations can be used to predict the radius or massof a planet.

1312.4938	what asteroseismology can do for exoplanets: kepler-410a b is a small  neptune around a bright star, in an eccentric orbit consistent with low  obliquity	we confirm the kepler planet candidate kepler-410b (koi-42b) as a neptunesized exoplanet on a 17.8 day, eccentric orbit around the bright (kp = 9.4)star kepler-410a. this is the third brightest confirmed planet host star in thekepler field and one of the brightest hosts of all currently known transitingexoplanets. kepler-410 consists of a blend between the fast rotating planethost star (kepler-410a) and a fainter star (kepler-410b), which has complicatedthe confirmation of the planetary candidate. employing asteroseismology, usingconstraints from the transit light curve, adaptive optics and speckle images,and spitzer transit observations, we demonstrate that the candidate can only bean exoplanet orbiting kepler-410a. via asteroseismology we determine thefollowing stellar and planetary parameters with high precision; m$_\star =1.214 \pm 0.033$ m$_\odot$, r$_\star = 1.352 \pm 0.010$ r$_\odot$, age = $2.76\pm 0.54$ gyr, planetary radius ($2.838 \pm 0.054$ r$_\oplus$), and orbitaleccentricity ($0.17^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$). in addition, rotational splitting of thepulsation modes allows for a measurement of kepler-410a's inclination androtation rate. our measurement of an inclination of $82.5^{+7.5}_{-2.5}$[$^\circ$] indicates a low obliquity in this system. transit timing variationsindicate the presence of at least one additional (non-transiting) planet in thesystem.

1401.4195	masses, radii, and orbits of small kepler planets: the transition from  gaseous to rocky planets	we report on the masses, sizes, and orbits of the planets orbiting 22 keplerstars. there are 49 planet candidates around these stars, including 42 detectedthrough transits and 7 revealed by precise doppler measurements of the hoststars. based on an analysis of the kepler brightness measurements, along withhigh-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, doppler spectroscopy, and (for 11stars) asteroseismology, we establish low false-positive probabilities for allof the transiting planets (41 of 42 have a false-positive probability under1%), and we constrain their sizes and masses. most of the transiting planetsare smaller than 3x the size of earth. for 16 planets, the doppler signal wassecurely detected, providing a direct measurement of the planet's mass. for theother 26 planets we provide either marginal mass measurements or upper limitsto their masses and densities; in many cases we can rule out a rockycomposition. we identify 6 planets with densities above 5 g/cc, suggesting amostly rocky interior for them. indeed, the only planets that are compatiblewith a purely rocky composition are smaller than ~2 r_earth. larger planetsevidently contain a larger fraction of low-density material (h, he, and h2o).

1403.6831	atmospheric characterization of the hot jupiter kepler-13ab	kepler-13ab (= koi-13.01) is a unique transiting hot jupiter. it is one ofvery few known short-period planets orbiting a hot a-type star, making it oneof the hottest planets currently known. the availability of kepler data allowsus to measure the planet's occultation (secondary eclipse) and phase curve inthe optical, which we combine with occultations observed by warm spitzer at 4.5mic and 3.6 mic and a ground-based occultation observation in the ks band (2.1mic). we derive a day-side hemisphere temperature of 2,750 +- 160 k as theeffective temperature of a black body showing the same occultation depths.comparing the occultation depths with one-dimensional planetary atmospheremodels suggests the presence of an atmospheric temperature inversion. ouranalysis shows evidence for a relatively high geometric albedo, ag= 0.33 +0.04-0.06. while measured with a simplistic method, a high ag is supported also bythe fact that the one-dimensional atmosphere models underestimate theoccultation depth in the optical. we use stellar spectra to determine thedilution, in the four wide bands where occultation was measured, due to thevisual stellar binary companion 1.15 +- 0.05" away. the revised stellarparameters measured using these spectra are combined with other measurementsleading to revised planetary mass and radius estimates of mp = 4.94 - 8.09 mjupand rp = 1.406 +- 0.038 rjup. finally, we measure a kepler mid-occultation timethat is 34.0 +- 6.9 s earlier than expected based on the mid-transit time andthe delay due to light travel time, and discuss possible scenarios.

1404.2960	occurrence and core-envelope structure of 1--4x earth-size planets  around sun-like stars	small planets, 1-4x the size of earth, are extremely common around sun-likestars, and surprisingly so, as they are missing in our solar system. recentdetections have yielded enough information about this class of exoplanets tobegin characterizing their occurrence rates, orbits, masses, densities, andinternal structures. the kepler mission finds the smallest planets to be mostcommon, as 26% of sun-like stars have small, 1-2 r_e planets with orbitalperiods under 100 days, and 11% have 1-2 r_e planets that receive 1-4x theincident stellar flux that warms our earth. these earth-size planets aresprinkled uniformly with orbital distance (logarithmically) out to 0.4 au, andprobably beyond. mass measurements for 33 transiting planets of 1-4 r_e showthat the smallest of them, r &lt; 1.5 r_e, have the density expected for rockyplanets. their densities increase with increasing radius, likely caused bygravitational compression. including solar system planets yields a relation:rho = 2.32 + 3.19 r/r_e [g/cc]. larger planets, in the radius range 1.5-4.0r_e, have densities that decline with increasing radius, revealing increasingamounts of low-density material in an envelope surrounding a rocky core,befitting the appellation "mini-neptunes." planets of ~1.5 r_e have the highestdensities, averaging near 10 g/cc. the gas giant planets occur preferentiallyaround stars that are rich in heavy elements, while rocky planets occur aroundstars having a range of heavy element abundances. one explanation is that thefast formation of rocky cores in protoplanetary disks enriched in heavyelements permits the gravitational accumulation of gas before it vanishes,forming giant planets. but models of the formation of 1-4 r_e planets remainuncertain. defining habitable zones remains difficult, without benefit ofeither detections of life elsewhere or an understanding of life's biochemicalorigins.

1405.7695	three regimes of extrasolar planets inferred from host star  metallicities	approximately half of the extrasolar planets (exoplanets) with radii lessthan four earth radii are in orbits with short periods. despite their sheerabundance, the compositions of such planets are largely unknown. the availableevidence suggests that they range in composition from small, high-density rockyplanets to low-density planets consisting of rocky cores surrounded by thickhydrogen and helium gas envelopes. understanding the transition from thegaseous planets to earth-like rocky worlds is important to estimate the numberof potentially habitable planets in our galaxy and provide constraints onplanet formation theories. here we report the abundances of heavy elements(that is, the metallicities) of more than 400 stars hosting 600 exoplanetcandidates, and find that the exoplanets can be categorized into threepopulations defined by statistically distinct (~ 4.5{\sigma}) metallicityregions. we interpret these regions as reflecting the formation regimes ofterrestrial-like planets (radii less than 1.7 earth radii), gas dwarf planetswith rocky cores and hydrogen-helium envelopes (radii between 1.7 and 3.9 earthradii) and ice or gas giant planets (radii greater than 3.9 earth radii). thesetransitions correspond well with those inferred from dynamical mass estimates,implying that host star metallicity, which is a proxy for the initial solidinventory of the protoplanetary disk, is a key ingredient regulating thestructure of planetary systems.

1408.3475	empirical limits on radial velocity planet detection for young stars	we report initial results from our long term search using precision radialvelocities for planetary-mass companions located within a few au of starsyounger than the sun. based on a sample of &gt;150 stars, we define a floor in theradial velocity scatter, sigma_rv, as a function of the chromospheric activitylevel r'_{hk}. this lower bound to the jitter, which increases with increasingstellar activity, sets the minimum planet mass that could be detected. adoptinga median activity-age relationship reveals the astrophysical limits to planetmasses discernable via radial velocity monitoring, as a function of stellarage. considering solar-mass primaries having the mean jitter-activity level,when they are younger than 100 / 300 / 1000 myr, the stochastic jittercomponent in radial velocity measurements restricts detectable companion massesto &gt; 0.3 / 0.2 / 0.1 m_jupiter. these numbers require a large number -- severaltens -- of radial velocity observations taken over a time frame longer than theorbital period. lower companion mass limits can be achieved for stars with lessthan the mean jitter and/or with an increased number of observations.

1511.09097	the kepler-454 system: a small, not-rocky inner planet, a jovian world,  and a distant companion	kepler-454 (koi-273) is a relatively bright (v = 11.69 mag), sun-likestarthat hosts a transiting planet candidate in a 10.6 d orbit. fromspectroscopy, we estimate the stellar temperature to be 5687 +/- 50 k, itsmetallicity to be [m/h] = 0.32 +/- 0.08, and the projected rotational velocityto be v sin i &lt;2.4 km s-1. we combine these values with a study of theasteroseismic frequencies from short cadence kepler data to estimate thestellar mass to be 1.028+0:04-0:03 m_sun, the radius to be 1.066 +/- 0.012r_sun and the age to be 5.25+1:41-1:39 gyr. we estimate the radius of the 10.6d planet as 2.37 +/- 0.13 r_earth. using 63 radial velocity observationsobtained with the harps-n spectrograph on the telescopio nazionale galileo and36 observations made with the hires spectrograph at keck observatory, wemeasure the mass of this planet to be 6.8 +/- 1.4m_earth. we also detect twoadditional non-transiting companions, a planet with a minimum mass of 4.46 +/-0.12 m_j in a nearly circular 524 d orbit and a massive companion with a period&gt;10 years and mass &gt;12.1m_j . the twelve exoplanets with radii &lt;2.7 r_earth andprecise mass measurements appear to fall into two populations, with those &lt;1.6r_earth following an earth-like composition curve and larger planets requiringa significant fraction of volatiles. with a density of 2.76 +/- 0.73 g cm-3,kepler-454b lies near the mass transition between these two populations andrequires the presence of volatiles and/or h/he gas.

1512.03428	orbital architectures of planet-hosting binaries: i. forming five small  planets in the truncated disk of kepler-444a	we present the first results from our keck program investigating the orbitalarchitectures of planet-hosting multiple star systems. kepler-444 is ametal-poor triple star system that hosts five sub-earth-sized planets orbitingthe primary star (kepler-444a), as well as a spatially unresolved pair of mdwarfs (kepler-444bc) at a projected distance of 1.8" (66 au). we combine ourkeck/nirc2 adaptive optics astrometry with multi-epoch keck/hires rvs of allthree stars to determine a precise orbit for the bc pair around a, given theirempirically constrained masses. we measure minimal astrometric motion($1.0\pm0.6$ mas yr$^{-1}$, or $0.17\pm0.10$ km s$^{-1}$), but our rvs revealsignificant orbital velocity ($1.7\pm0.2$ km s$^{-1}$) and acceleration($7.8\pm0.5$ m s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$). we determine a highly eccentric stellarorbit ($e=0.864\pm0.023$) that brings the tight m dwarf pair within$5.0^{+0.9}_{-1.0}$ au of the planetary system. we validate that the system isdynamically stable in its present configuration via n-body simulations. we findthat the a$-$bc orbit and planetary orbits are likely aligned (98%) given thatthey both have edge-on orbits and misalignment induces precession of theplanets out of transit. we conclude that the stars were likely on their currentorbits during the epoch of planet formation, truncating the protoplanetary diskat $\approx$2 au. this truncated disk would have been severely depleted ofsolid material from which to form the total $\approx$1.5 $m_{\rm earth}$ ofplanets. we thereby strongly constrain the efficiency of the conversion of dustinto planets and suggest that the kepler-444 system is consistent with modelsthat explain the formation of more typical close-in kepler planets in normal,not truncated, disks.
