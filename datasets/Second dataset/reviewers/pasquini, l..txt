0902.0483	beryllium abundances and star formation in the halo and in the thick  disk	[abridged] beryllium is a pure product of cosmic ray spallation. this impliesa relatively simple evolution in time of the beryllium abundance and suggestsits use as a time-like observable. we study the evolution of be in the earlygalaxy and its dependence on kinematic and orbital parameters. we investigatethe formation of the halo and the thick disk of the galaxy and the use of be asa cosmochronometer. beryllium abundances are determined from high resolution,high signal to noise uves spectra with spectrum synthesis in the largest sampleof halo and thick disk stars analyzed to date. we present our observationalresults in various diagrams. 1) in a log(be/h) vs [fe/h] diagram we find amarginal statistical detection of a real scatter, above what expected frommeasurement errors, with a larger scatter among halo stars. the detection ofthe scatter is further supported by the existence of pairs of stars withidentical atmospheric parameters and different be abundances. 2) in anlog(be/h) vs [alpha/fe] diagram, the halo stars separate into two components;one is consistent with predictions of evolutionary models, while the other hastoo high alpha and be abundances and is chemically indistinguishable from thickdisk stars. this suggests that the halo is not a single uniform populationwhere a clear age-metallicity relation can be defined. 3) in diagrams of rminvs [alpha/fe] and log(be/h) the thick disk stars show a possible decrease of[alpha/fe] with rmin, whereas no dependence of be with rmin is seen. thisanticorrelation suggests that the star formation rate was lower in the outerregions of the thick disc, pointing towards an inside-out formation. the lackof correlation for be indicates that it is insensitive to the local conditionsof star formation.

0904.3199	an investigation of chromospheric activity spanning the vaughan--preston  gap: impact on stellar ages	chromospheric activity is widely used as an age indicator for solar-typestars based on the early evidence that there is a smooth evolution from youngand active to old and inactive stars. we analysed chromospheric activity infive solar-type stars in two open clusters, in order to study how chromosphericactivity evolves with time. we took uves high-resolution, high s/n ratiospectra of 3 stars in ic 4756 and 2 in ngc 5822, which were combined with apreviously studied data-set and reanalysed here. the emission core of the deep,photospheric ca ii k line was used as a probe of the chromospheric activity.all of the 5 stars in the new sample, including those in the 1.2 gyr-old ngc5822, have activity levels comparable to those of hyades and praesepe. a likelyinterpretation of our data is that solar-type-star chromospheric activity, fromthe age of the hyades until that of the sun, does not evolve smoothly. starschange from active to inactive on a short timescale. evolution before and aftersuch a transition is much less significant than cyclical and long-termvariations. we show that data presented in the literature to support acorrelation between age and activity could be also interpreted differently inthe light of our results.

0707.0788	evolved stars hint to an external origin of enhanced metallicity in  planet-hosting stars	exo-planets are preferentially found around high metallicity main sequencestars. we aim at investigating whether evolved stars share this property, andwhat this tells about planet formation. statistical tools and the basicconcepts of stellar evolution theory are applied to published results as wellas our own radial velocity and chemical analyses of evolved stars. we show thatthe metal distributions of planet-hosting (p-h) dwarfs and giants aredifferent, and that the latter do not favor metal-rich systems. rather, thesestars follow the same age-metallicity relation as the giants without planets inour sample. the straightforward explanation is to attribute the differencebetween dwarfs and giants to the much larger masses of giants' convectiveenvelopes. if the metal excess on the main sequence is due to pollution, theeffects of dilution naturally explains why it is not observed among evolvedstars. although we cannot exclude other explanations, the lack of anypreference for metal-rich systems among p-h giants could be a strong indicationof the accretion of metal-rich material. we discuss further tests, as well assome predictions and consequences of this hypothesis.

1001.1834	beryllium abundances and the formation of the halo and the thick disk	the single stable isotope of beryllium is a pure product of cosmic-rayspallation in the ism. assuming that the cosmic-rays are globally transportedacross the galaxy, the beryllium production should be a widespread process andits abundance should be roughly homogeneous in the early-galaxy at a giventime. thus, it could be useful as a tracer of time. in an investigation of theuse of be as a cosmochronometer and of its evolution in the galaxy, we foundevidence that in a log(be/h) vs. [alpha/fe] diagram the halo stars separateinto two components. one is consistent with predictions of evolutionary modelswhile the other is chemically indistinguishable from the thick-disk stars. thisis interpreted as a difference in the star formation history of the twocomponents and suggests that the local halo is not a single uniform populationwhere a clear age-metallicity relation can be defined. we also found evidencethat the star formation rate was lower in the outer regions of the thick disk,pointing towards an inside-out formation.

0708.3698	upper limit for circumstellar gas around the type ia sn 2000cx	the nature of the companion stars in type ia supernova (sne) progenitorsystems remains unclear. one possible way to discriminate between differentscenarios is the presence (or absence) of circumstellar material, the leftovers from the progenitor evolution that may be revealed by their interactionwith the sn. a new method to probe the circumstellar environment has beenexploited for the normal type ia sn 2006x, leading for the first time to thedirect detection of material which escaped the progenitor system. in this paperwe apply the same analysis to the peculiar type ia sn 2000cx, with the aim ofconstraining the properties of its progenitor system. using multi-epoch,high-resolution spectroscopy we have studied the spectral region where narrow,time-variable naid absorption features are expected in case circumstellarmaterial is present along the line of sight. no naid absorption is detected inthe rest-frame of the host galaxy to a level of a few ma, setting a stringentupper limit to the column density of the absorbing material (n(nai)&lt;=2 x 10^10cm-2). in this respect the peculiar type ia sn 2000cx is different from thenormal ia sn 2006x. whether this is to be attributed to a different progenitorsystem, to viewing-angle effects or to a low metallicity remains to beclarified.

1011.1718	li - o anti-correlation in ngc 6752: evidence for li-enriched polluting  gas	elemental correlations and anti-correlations are known to be present inglobular clusters (gcs) owing to pollution by cno cycled gas. because of itsfragility li is destroyed at the temperature at which the cno cycling occurs,and this makes li a crucial study for the nature of the contaminating stars. weobserved 112 un-evolved stars at the turnoff of the ngc6752 cluster with flamesat the vlt to investigate the presence and the extent of a li-o correlation.this correlation is expected if there is a simple pollution scenario. li (670.8nm) and o triplet (771 nm) abundances are derived in nlte. all stars belong toa very narrow region of the color-magnitude diagram, so they have similarstellar parameters (teff, log g). we find that o and li correlate, with a highstatistical significance that confirms the early results for this cluster. atfirst glance this is what is expected if a simple pollution of pristine gaswith cno cycled gas (o-poor, li-poor) occurred. the slope of the relationship,however, is about 0.4, and differs from unity by over 7 sigma. a slope of oneis the value predicted for a pure contamination model. we confirm an extendedli-o correlation in non evolved stars of ngc 6752. at the same time thecharacteristic of the correlation shows that a simple pollution scenario is notsufficient to explain the observations. within this scenario the contaminantgas must have been enriched in li. this would rule out massive stars as mainpolluters, and favor the hypothesis that the polluting gas was enriched byintermediate or high-mass agb stars, unless the former can be shown to be ableto produce li. according to our observations, the fraction of polluting gascontained in the stars observed is a considerable fraction of the stellar massof the cluster.

1011.4635	gravitational redshifts in main-sequence and giant stars	gravitational redshifts in solar-type main-sequence stars are expected to besome 500 ms$^{-1}$ greater than those in giants. such a signature is searchedfor between groups of open-cluster stars which share the same average spacemotion and thus have the same average doppler shift. 144 main-sequence starsand cool giants were observed in the m67 open cluster using the eso ferosspectrograph, obtaining radial velocities by cross correlation with a spectraltemplate. m67 dwarf and giant radial-velocity distributions are wellrepresented by gaussian functions, sharing the same apparent average radialvelocity within $\simeq$ 100 ms$^{-1}$. in addition, dwarfs in m67 appear to bedynamically hotter ($\sigma$ = 0.90 kms$^{-1}$) than giants ($\sigma$ = 0.68kms$^{-1}$). explanations for the lack of an expected signal are sought: alikely cause is the differential wavelength shifts produced by differenthydrodynamics in dwarf and giant atmospheres. radial-velocity differencesmeasured between unblended lines in low-noise averaged spectra vary withline-strength: stronger lines are more blushifted in dwarfs than in giants,apparently 'compensating' for the gravitational redshift. synthetichigh-resolution spectra are computed from 3-dimensional hydrodynamic modelatmospheres for both giants and dwarfs, and synthetic wavelength shiftsobtained. in agreement with observations, 3d models predict substantiallysmaller wavelength-shift differences than expected from gravitational redshiftonly. the procedures developed could be used to test 3d models for differentclasses of stars, but will ultimately require high-fidelity spectra formeasurements of wavelength shifts in individual spectral lines.

1104.0506	connecting rs oph to [some] type ia supernovae	aims: recurrent nova systems like rs oph have been proposed as a possiblechannel to type ia supernova explosions, based on the high mass of theaccreting white dwarf. additional support to this hypothesis has been recentlyprovided by the detection of circumstellar material around sn2006x andsn2007le, showing a structure compatible with that expected for recurrent novaoutbursts.in this paper we investigate the circumstellar environment of rs ophand its structure, with the aim of establishing a firmer and independent linkbetween this class of objects and type ia sn progenitors.  methods: we study the time evolution of caii, nai and ki absorption featuresin rs oph, before, during, and after the last outburst, using multi-epoch,high-resolution spectroscopy, and applying the same method adopted for sn2006xand sn2007le.  results: a number of components, blue-shifted with respect to the systemicvelocity of rs oph, are detected. in particular, one feature strongly weakensin the first two weeks after the outburst, simultaneously with thedisappearance of very narrow p-cyg profiles overimposed on the much wider novaemission lines of h, he, feii and other elements.  conclusions: we interpret these facts as the signature of densityenhancements in the circumstellar material, suggesting that the recurrenteruptions might indeed create complex structures within the material lost bythe donor star. this establishes a strong link between rs oph and theprogenitor system of the type ia sn2006x, for which similar features have beendetected.

(i) for the field stars wefind that the temperatures derived by means of the ldr method are in excellentagreement with those found by the spectral synthesis. this result is extremelyencouraging because it shows that spectra can be used to firmly derivepopulation characteristics (e.g., mass and age) of the observed stars. (ii) forthe ic 4651 stars we use the determined effective temperature to derive thefollowing results. a) the reddening e(b-v) of the cluster is 0.12+/-0.02,largely independent of the color-temperature calibration used. b) the age ofthe cluster is 1.2+/-0.2 gyr. c) the typical mass of the analysed giant starsis 2.0+/-0.2m_sun. moreover, we find a systematic difference of about 0.2 dexin log g between spectroscopic and evolutionary values. we conclude that, inspite of known limitations, a classical spectroscopic analysis of giant starsmay indeed result in very reliable stellar parameters. we caution that thequality of the agreement, on the other hand, depends on the details of theadopted spectroscopic analysis.

(2010) on a single order and extends the detection ofthe distortions to the whole analyzed region revealing that the precise shapevaries with wavelength. a new data reduction is implemented to deal with ccdpixel inequalities to obtain a wavelength corrected solar spectrum. by usingthis spectrum we provide a new lfc calibrated solar atlas with 400 linepositions in the range of 476-530, and 175 lines in the 534-585 nm range. thenew lfc atlas improves the accuracy of individual lines by a significant factorreaching a mean value of about 10 m/s. the lfc--based solar line wavelengthsare essentially free of major instrumental effects and provide a reference forabsolute solar line positions. we suggest that future lfc observations could beused to trace small radial velocity changes of the whole solar photosphericspectrum in connection with the solar cycle and for direct comparison with thepredicted line positions of 3d radiative hydrodynamical models of the solarphotosphere.

0802.1532	cosmic dynamics in the era of extremely large telescopes	the redshifts of all cosmologically distant sources are expected toexperience a small, systematic drift as a function of time due to the evolutionof the universe's expansion rate. a measurement of this effect would representa direct and entirely model-independent determination of the expansion historyof the universe over a redshift range that is inaccessible to other methods.here we investigate the impact of the next generation of extremely largetelescopes on the feasibility of detecting and characterising the cosmologicalredshift drift. we consider the lyman alpha forest in the redshift range 2 &lt; z&lt; 5 and other absorption lines in the spectra of high redshift qsos as the mostsuitable targets for a redshift drift experiment. assuming photon-noise limitedobservations and using extensive monte carlo simulations we determine theaccuracy to which the redshift drift can be measured from the ly alpha forestas a function of signal-to-noise and redshift. based on this relation and usingthe brightness and redshift distributions of known qsos we find that a 42-mtelescope is capable of unambiguously detecting the redshift drift over aperiod of ~20 yr using 4000 h of observing time. such an experiment wouldprovide independent evidence for the existence of dark energy without assumingspatial flatness, using any other cosmological constraints or making any otherastrophysical assumption.

1401.7945	the be-test in the li-rich star \#1657 of ngc 6397: evidence for  li-flash in rgb stars?	the li-rich turn-off star in the globular cluster ngc 6397 could representthe smoking gun for some very rare episode of li enrichment in globularclusters. we aim to understand the nature of the li enrichment by performing aspectroscopic analysis of the star, in particular of its beryllium (be)abundance, and by investigating its binary nature. we observe the near uvregion where the beii resonance doublet and the nh bands are located. we couldnot detect the beii lines and derive an upper limit of log (be/h)&lt; -12.2, thatis consistent with the be observed in other stars of the cluster. we coulddetect a weak g-band, which implies a mild carbon enhancement[c/fe]$+0.4\pm0.2$. we could not detect the uv nh band, and we derive an upperlimit [n/fe]$&lt; 0.0$. for oxygen we could notdetect any of the near uv oh lines,which implies that oxygen cannot be strongly enhanced in this star. this isconsistent with the detection of the oi triplet at 777nm, which is consistentwith [o/fe]~0.5. combining the uves and mike data, we could not detect anyvariation in the radial velocity greater than 0.95 kms$^{-1}$ over 8 years. thechemical composition of the star strongly resembles that of `first generation'ngc6397 stars, with the huge li as the only deviating abundance. not detectingbe rules out two possible explanations of the li overabundance: capture of asubstellar body and spallation caused by a nearby type ii sne. discrepanciesare also found with respect to other accretion scenarios,except forcontamination by the ejecta of a star that has undergone the rgb li-flash.

1409.0568	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of high-resolution uves spectra of  fgk-type stars	the gaia-eso survey is obtaining high-quality spectroscopic data for about10^5 stars using flames at the vlt. uves high-resolution spectra are beingcollected for about 5000 fgk-type stars. these uves spectra are analyzed inparallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. our aim is to present howthese analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe howa final recommended parameter scale is defined. we also discuss the precision(method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases with respect to thereference values) of the final parameters. these results are part of thegaia-eso 2nd internal release and will be part of its 1st public release ofadvanced data products. the final parameter scale is tied to the one defined bythe gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmosphericparameters. a set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate thephysical soundness of the results. each methodology is judged against thebenchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameterspace. the final recommended results are the weighted-medians of those from theindividual methods. the recommended results successfully reproduce thebenchmark stars atmospheric parameters and the expected teff-log g relation ofthe calibrating clusters. atmospheric parameters and abundances have beendetermined for 1301 fgk-type stars observed with uves. the median of themethod-to-method dispersion of the atmospheric parameters is 55 k for teff,0.13 dex for log g, and 0.07 dex for [fe/h]. systematic biases are estimated tobe between 50-100 k for teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g, and 0.05-0.10 dex for[fe/h]. abundances for 24 elements were derived: c, n, o, na, mg, al, si, ca,sc, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu, zn, y, zr, mo, ba, nd, and eu. the typicalmethod-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies between 0.10 and 0.20 dex.

1412.7075	tachoastrometry: astrometry with radial velocities	spectra of composite systems (e.g., spectroscopic binaries) contain spatialinformation that can be retrieved by measuring the radial velocities (i.e.,doppler shifts) of the components in four observations with the slit rotated by90 degrees in the sky. by using basic concepts of slit spectroscopy we showthat the geometry of composite systems can be reliably retrieved by measuringonly radial velocity differences taken with different slit angles. the spatialresolution is determined by the precision with which differential radialvelocities can be measured. we use the uves spectrograph at the vlt to observethe known spectroscopic binary star hd 188088 (hip 97944), which has a maximumexpected separation of 23 milli-arcseconds. we measure an astrometric signal inradial velocity of 276 \ms, which corresponds to a separation between the twocomponents at the time of the observations of 18 $\pm2$ milli-arcseconds. thestars were aligned east-west. we describe a simple optical device tosimultaneously record pairs of spectra rotated by 180 degrees, thus reducingsystematic effects. we compute and provide the function expressing the shift ofthe centroid of a seeing-limited image in the presence of a narrow slit.theproposed technique is simple to use and our test shows that it is amenable forderiving astrometry with milli-arcsecond accuracy or better, beyond thediffraction limit of the telescope. the technique can be further improved byusing simple devices to simultaneously record the spectra with 180 degreesangles.with tachoastrometry, radial velocities and astrometric positions can bemeasured simultaneously for many double line system binaries in an easy way.the method is not limited to binary stars, but can be applied to anyastrophysical configuration in which spectral lines are generated by separate(non-rotational symmetric) regions.

0705.2330	tracing mixing in stars: new beryllium observations of the open clusters  ngc 2516, hyades, and m67	determinations of beryllium abundance in stars, together with lithium,provide a key tool to investigate the so far poorly understood extra-mixingprocesses at work in stellar interiors. we measured be in three openclusters,complementing existing be surveys, and aiming at gathering a morecomplete empirical scenario of the evolution of be as a function of stellar ageand temperature. specifically, we analyzed vlt/uves spectra of members of ngc2516, the hyades, and m 67 to determine their be and li abundances. in thefirst two clusters we focused on stars cooler than 5400 k, while the m 67sample includes stars warmer than 6150 k, as well as two subgiants and two bluestragglers. we also computed the evolution of be for a 0.9 mo star based onstandard evolutionary models. we find different emprical behaviours for starsin different temperature bins and ages. stars warmer than 6150 k show bedepletion and follow a be vs. li correlation while be is undepleted in stars inthe ~6150-5600 k range. ngc 2516 members cooler than 5400 k have not depletedany be, but older hyades of similar temperature do show some depletion. be isseverely depleted in the subgiants and blue stragglers. the results for warmstars are in agreement with previous studies, supporting the hypothesis thatmixing in this temperature regime is driven by rotation. the same holds for thetwo subgiants that have evolved from the "li gap". this mechanism is insteadnot the dominant one for solar-type stars. we show that be depletion of coolhyades cannot simply be explained by the effect of increasing depth of theconvective zone. finally, the different be content of the two blue stragglerssuggests that they have formed by two different processes (i.e., collisions vs.binary merging).

1509.01523	rotation period distribution of corot and kepler sun-like stars	we study the distribution of the photometric rotation period (prot), which isa direct measurement of the surface rotation at active latitudes, for threesubsamples of sun-like stars: one from corot data and two from kepler data. weidentify the main populations of these samples and interpret their main biasesspecifically for a comparison with the solar prot. prot and variabilityamplitude (a) measurements were obtained from public corot and kepler catalogscombined with physical parameters. because these samples are subject toselection effects, we computed synthetic samples with simulated biases tocompare with observations, particularly around the location of the sun in thehr diagram. theoretical grids and empirical relations were used to combinephysical parameters with prot and a. biases were simulated by performingcutoffs on the physical and rotational parameters in the same way as in eachobserved sample. a crucial cutoff is related with the detectability of therotational modulation, which strongly depends on a. the synthetic samplesexplain the observed prot distributions of sun-like stars as having two mainpopulations: one of young objects (group i, with ages younger than ~1 gyr) andanother of ms and evolved stars (group ii, with ages older than ~1 gyr). theproportions of groups i and ii in relation to the total number of stars rangewithin 64-84% and 16-36%, respectively. hence, young objects abound in thedistributions, producing the effect of observing a high number of short periodsaround the location of the sun in the hr diagram. differences in the protdistributions between the corot and kepler sun-like samples may be associatedwith different galactic populations. overall, the synthetic distribution aroundthe solar period agrees with observations, which suggests that the solarrotation is normal with respect to sun-like stars within the accuracy ofcurrent data.

astro-ph;0008109	ca ii activity and rotation in f-k evolved stars	(abridged) ca ii h and k high resolution observations for 60 evolved stars inthe field and in 5 open clusters are presented. from these spectrachromospheric fluxes are derived, and a homogeneous sample of more than 100giants is built adding data from the literature. in addition, for most stars,rotational velocities were derived from coravel observations. by comparingchromospheric emission in the cluster stars we confirm that chromosphericactivity depends on t_eff, and mass, when intermediate mass stars (m~4 msun)are considered. the hyades and praesepe clump giants show the same level ofactivity, as expected from stars with similar masses and t_effs. a differenceof up to 0.4 dex in the chromospheric fluxes among the hyades giants isrecorded and this sets a clear limit to the intrinsic spread of stellaractivity in evolved giants. among the field stars none of the giants with(v-r)&lt;0.4 and ia supergiants observed shows a signature of ca ii activity. wefind that chromospheric activity scales linearly with stellar rotationalvelocity and a high power of stellar effective temperature: f'_k proptot_eff^7.7 vsini^0.9. this result can be interpreted as the effect of twochromospheric components of different nature: one mechanical and one magnetic.for each range of masses activity can simply be expressed as a function of onlyone parameter: either the t_eff or the angular rotation omega. for the 1.6-3solar mass stars the data are consistent with i omega=const, while lower andhigher masses follow a law similar to i omega^2=const. we find it intriguingthat vsini remains almost constant for 1msun stars along their evolution; if asimilar behavior is shared by pop ii stars, this could explain the relativelyhigh degree of activity observed in pop ii giants.

astro-ph;0107022	using the ca ii triplet to trace abundance variations in individual red  giant branch stars in three nearby galaxies	spectroscopic abundance determinations for stars spanning a hubble time inage are necessary in order to unambiguously determine the evolutionaryhistories of galaxies. using fors1 in multi-object spectroscopy mode on antu(ut1) at the eso-vlt on paranal we obtained near infrared spectra from which wemeasured the equivalent widths of the two strongest ca ii triplet lines todetermine metal abundances for a sample of red giant branch stars, selectedfrom eso-ntt optical (i, v-i) photometry of three nearby, local group,galaxies: the sculptor dwarf spheroidal, the fornax dwarf spheroidal and thedwarf irregular ngc 6822. the summed equivalent width of the two strongestlines in the ca ii triplet absorption line feature, centered at 8500a, can bereadily converted into an [fe/h] abundance using the previously establishedcalibrations by armandroff &amp; da costa (1991) and rutledge, hesser &amp; stetson(1997). we measured metallicities for 37 stars in sculptor, 32 stars in fornax,and 23 stars in ngc 6822, yielding more precise estimates of the metallicitydistribution functions for these galaxies than it is possible to obtainphotometrically. in the case of ngc 6822, this is the first direct measurementof the abundances of the intermediate-age and old stellar populations. we findmetallicity spreads in each galaxy which are broadly consistent with thephotometric width of the red giant branch, although the abundances ofindividual stars do not always appear to correspond to their colour. this isalmost certainly predominantly due to a highly variable star formation ratewith time in these galaxies, which results in a non-uniform,non-globular-cluster-like, evolution of the ca/fe ratio.

astro-ph;0310872	the sgr dsph hosts a metal-rich population	we report on abundances of o, mg, si, ca and fe for 10 giants in the sgrdwarf spheroidal derived from high resolution spectra obtained with uves at the8.2m kueyen-vlt telescope. the iron abundance spans the range -0.8 &lt;[fe/h] &lt;0.0 and the dominant population is relatively metal-rich with [fe/h] -0.25. thealpha/fe ratios are slightly subsolar, even at the lowest observedmetallicities suggesting a slow or bursting star formation rate. from oursample of 12 giants (including the two observed by bonifacio et al 2000) weconclude that a substantial metal rich population exists in sgr, whichdominates the sample. the spectroscopic metallicities allow one to break theage-metallicity degeneracy in the interpretation of the colour-magnitudediagram (cmd). comparison of isochrones of appropriate metallicity with theobserved cmd suggests an age of 1 gyr or younger, for the dominant sgrpopulation sampled by us. we argue that the observations support a starformation that is triggered by the passage of sgr through the galactic disc,both in sgr and in the disc. this scenario has also the virtue of explainingthe mysterious ``bulge c stars'' as disc stars formed in this event. theinteraction of sgr with the milky way is likely to have played a major role inits evolution.

astro-ph;0406113	detailed chemical composition of the open cluster ic 4651: the iron  peak, alpha elements, and li	we present a detailed chemical analysis of 22 stars along thecolour-magnitude sequence of the intermediate-age (1.7 gyr) open cluster ic4651. we find for the cluster a well-defined fe abundance of [fe/h]= 0.10 +/-0.03 (internal errors), with a reddening e(b-y)=0.091. we also deriveabundances for the alpha elements mg, si, ti, and ca and find a moderateenhancement of the three former elements. among the fe group elements, cr andni are slightly overabundant ([x/fe] ~ 0.05). the na abundance among the giantsis more than 0.2 dex higher than in the dwarfs. we interpret this as due todredge-up of 23na in the giants. li abundances show a well-defined pattern: thesolar-type stars have an almost constant li abundance, just below that of thehyades, and the li-dip is pronounced and well determined. turnoff stars justabove the dip have a `cosmic' li abundance, but within a very small range ofmagnitudes (0.25 mag) higher on the turnoff, li drops by more than a factor 10implying that some extra mixing is required. among the giants, two probableclump stars show detectable li, while all the other (likely) rgb stars do not.we show that rotating stellar models including the most recent developments formeridional circulation and turbulence by shear instabilities explain very wellthe observed li pattern. the possibility remains open that the giantsexhibiting the highest li abundances are actual rgb bump stars which have justbeen through the so-called "lithium flash".

astro-ph;0407524	beryllium in turnoff stars of ngc6397: early galaxy spallation,  cosmochronology and cluster formation	we present the first detection of beryllium in two turnoff stars of the old,metal-poor globular cluster ngc 6397. the beryllium lines are clearly detectedand we determine a mean beryllium abundance of log(be/h)=-12.35 +/- 0.2. theberyllium abundance is very similar to that of field stars of similar fecontent. we interpret the beryllium abundance observed as the result of primaryspallation of cosmic rays acting on a galactic scale, showing that berylliumcan be used as a powerful cosmochronometer for the first stellar generations.with this method, we estimate that the cluster formed 0.2-0.3 gyr after theonset of star formation in the galaxy, in excellent agreement with the agederived from main sequence fitting. from the same spectra we also find low o(noticeably different for the two stars) and high n abundances, suggesting thatthe original gas was enriched in cno processed material. our beryllium results,together with the n, o, and li abundances, provide insights on the formation ofthis globular cluster, showing that any cno processing of the gas must haveoccurred in the protocluster cloud before the formation of the stars we observenow. we encounter, however, difficulties in giving a fully consistent pictureof the cluster formation, able to explain the complex overall abundancepattern.

astro-ph;0505510	a substellar companion around the intermediate-mass giant star hd 11977	we report the discovery of a substellar companion to the intermediate-massstar hd 11977 (g5 iii). radial velocities of this star have been monitored forfive years with feros at the 1.52-m eso and later at the 2.2-m mpg/esotelescope in la silla, chile. based on the collected data we calculated anorbital solution with a period of p=711 days, a semi-amplitude of k1=105 m/s,and an eccentricity of e=0.4. the period of the radial-velocity variation islonger than that of the estimated stellar rotation, rendering it unlikely thatrotational modulation is the source of the variation in the radial velocity.this hypothesis is supported by the absence of a correlation between stellaractivity indicators and radial-velocity variation. by determining a primarystellar mass of mstar=1.91 msun, the best-fit minimum mass of the companion andsemi-major axis of the orbit are m2sini=6.54 mjup and a2=1.93 au, respectively.an upper limit for the mass of the companion of m2 &lt; 65.5 mjup has beencalculated from hipparcos astrometric measurements. although the possibility ofa brown-dwarf companion cannot be excluded, hd 11977 b is one of the few planetcandidates detected around an intermediate-mass star. the progenitormain-sequence star of hd 11977 is probably an a-type star. this discovery givesan indirect evidence for planetary companions around early type main-sequencestars.

astro-ph;0608160	basic physical parameters of a selected sample of evolved stars	we present the detailed spectroscopic analysis of 72 evolved stars, includingthe [fe/h] determination for the whole sample. these metallicities, togetherwith the teff values and the absolute v magnitude derived from hipparcosparallaxes, are used to estimate basic stellar parameters (ages, masses, radii,(b-v)o and log g using theoretical isochrones and a bayesian estimation method.the (b-v)o values so estimated turn out to be in excellent agreement with theobserved (b-v), confirming the reliability of the (teff,(b-v)o) relation usedin the isochrones. the estimated diameters have been compared with limbdarkening-corrected ones measured with independent methods, finding anagreement better than 0.3 mas within the 1-10 mas interval. we derive theage-metallicity relation for the solar neighborhood; for the first time such arelation has been derived from observations of field giants rather than fromopen clusters and field dwarfs and subdwarfs. the age-metallicity relation ischaracterized by close-to-solar metallicities for stars younger than ~4 gyr,and by a large [fe/h] spread with a trend towards lower metallicities forhigher ages. we find that the [fe/h] dispersion of young stars (less than 1gyr) is comparable to the observational errors, indicating that stars in thesolar neighbourhood are formed from interstellar matter of quite homogeneouschemical composition. the three giants of our sample which have been proposedto host planets are not metal rich, what is at odds with those for mainsequence stars. however, two of these stars have masses much larger than asolar mass so we may be sampling a different stellar population from mostradial velocity searches for extrasolar planets. we also confirm that theradial velocity variability tends to increase along the rgb.
