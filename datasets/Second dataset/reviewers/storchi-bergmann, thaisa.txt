0903.2798	the dusty nuclear torus in ngc 4151: constraints from gemini  near-infrared integral field spectrograph observations	we have used a near-infrared nuclear spectrum (covering the z, j, h and kbands) of the nucleus of ngc 4151 obtained with the gemini near-infraredintegral field spectrograph (nifs) and adaptive optics, to isolate andconstrain the properties of a near-ir unresolved nuclear source whose spectralsignature is clearly present in our data. the near-ir spectrum was combinedwith an optical spectrum obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrographwhich was used to constrain the contribution of a power-law component. aftersubtraction of the power-law component, the near-ir continuum is well fitted bya blackbody function, with $t=1285\pm50 $k, which dominates the nuclearspectrum -- within an aperture of radius 0$\farcs$3 -- in the near-ir. weattribute the blackbody component to emission by a dusty structure, with hotdust mass $m_{\rm hd}=(6.9\pm 1.5) \times10^{-4} {\rm m_\odot}$, not resolvedby our observations, which provide only an upper limit for its distance fromthe nucleus of 4 pc. if the reddening derived for the narrow-line region alsoapplies to the near-ir source, we obtain a temperature $t=1360\pm50 $k and amass $m_{\rm hd}=(3.1\pm 0.7) \times10^{-4} {\rm m_\odot}$ for the hot dust.this structure may be the inner wall of the dusty torus postulated by theunified model or the inner part of a dusty wind originating in the accretiondisk.

0910.2619	the gemini spectral library of near-ir late type stellar templates and  its application for velocity dispersion measurements	we present a spectroscopic library of late spectral type stellar templates inthe near-ir range 2.15-2.42microns, at r=5300-5900 resolution, oriented tosupport stellar kinematics studies in external galaxies, such as the directdetermination of the masses of supermassive black-holes in nearby active (ornon-active) galaxies. the combination of high spectral resolution andstate-of-the-art instrumentation available in 8-m class telescopes has made theanalysis of circumnuclear stellar kinematics using the near-ir co band headsone of the most used techniques for such studies, and this library aims toprovide the supporting datasets required by the higher spectral resolution andlarger spectral coverage currently achieved with modern near-ir spectrographs.examples of the application for kinematical analysis are given for dataobtained with two gemini instruments, but the templates can be easily adjustedfor use with other near-ir spectrographs at similar or lower resolution. theexample datasets are also used to revisit the "template mismatch" effect andthe dependence of the velocity dispersion values obtained from the fittingprocess with the characteristics of the stellar templates. the library isavailable in electronic form from the gemini web pages (link above).

0910.3234	feeding and feedback in nearby agn from integral field spectroscopy	i report results of recent integral field spectroscopy of the inner fewhundred parsecs (pc) around nearby active galactic nuclei (agn) at a samplingof a few pc, obtained with the gemini telescopes. in the lowest activity agns,it is possible to observe inflows in ionized gas along nuclear spirals andfilaments. in more luminous agn inflows have been observed also in hotmolecular gas (h_2) emission in the near-ir. in most cases the h_2 kinematicsis dominated by circular rotation in the plane around the nucleus, tracing theagn feeding. the ionized gas, on the other hand, traces the agn feedback. itskinematics shows two components: (1) one originating in the plane, anddominated by circular rotation; (2) another outflowing along the narrow-lineregion (nlr) whose flux distribution and kinematics frequently correlate withstructures seen in radio maps. mass outflow rates along the nlr range from10^-2 to 1 m_sun yr^-1, corresponding to 10-100 times the accretion rate to theagn, indicating that most of the nlr gas mass has been entrained from thegalaxy plane. the average kinetic power of the nlr outflows is ~10^-4 times thebolometric luminosity.

1001.3174	advection-dominated accretion, jets and the spectral energy distribution  of liners	low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (llagns) represent the bulk of the agnpopulation in the present-day universe and they trace low-level accretingsupermassive black holes. the observational properties of llagns suggest thattheir central engines are intrinsically different from those of more luminousagns. it has been suggested that accretion in llagns occurs via anadvection-dominated accretion flow (adaf) associated with strong jets. in orderto probe the accretion physics in llagns as a class, we model themultiwavelength spectral energy distributions (seds) of 24 liners (taken from arecent compilation by eracleous et al.) with a coupled accretion-jet model. theaccretion flow is modeled as an inner adaf outside of which there is atruncated standard thin disk. these seds include radio, near-ir to near-uv hstdata, and chandra x-ray data. we find that the radio emission is severelyunderpredicted by adaf models but can be explained by the relativistic jet. theorigin of the x-ray radiation in most sources can be explained by threedistinct scenarios: the x-rays can be dominated by emission from the adaf, thejet, or from both components contributing at similar levels. from the modelfits, we estimate important parameters of the central engine of liners, such asthe mass accretion rate -- relevant for studies of the feeding of agns -- andthe mass-loss rate in the jet and the jet power -- relevant for studies of thekinetic feedback from jets.

0707.4176	nuclear spirals as feeding channels to the supermassive black hole: the  case of the galaxy ngc 6951	we report the discovery of gas streaming motions along nuclear spiral armstowards the liner nucleus of the galaxy ngc 6951. the observations, obtainedusing the gmos integral field spectrograph on the gemini north telescope,yielded maps of the flux distributions and gas kinematics in the halpha,[nii]6584 and [sii]6717,31 emission lines of the inner 7x5 arcsec^2 of thegalaxy. this region includes a circumnuclear star-forming ring with radius500pc, a nuclear spiral inside the ring and the liner nucleus. the kinematicsof the ionized gas is dominated by rotation, but subtraction of a kinematicmodel of a rotating exponential disk reveals deviations from circular rotationwithin the nuclear ring which can be attributed to (1) streaming motions alongthe nuclear spiral arms and (2) a bipolar outflow which seems to be associatedto a nuclear jet. on the basis of the observed streaming velocities andgeometry of the spiral arms we estimate a mass inflow rate of ionized gas of3x10^(-4) msun/yr, which is of the order of the accretion rate necessary topower the liner nucleus of ngc 6951. similar streaming motions towards thenucleus of another galaxy with liner nucleus -- ngc 1097 -- have been reportedby our group in a previous paper. taken together, these results support ascenario in which nuclear spirals are channels through which matter istransferred from galactic scales to the nuclear region to feed the supermassiveblack hole.

1002.2534	intermediate age stars as origin of the low velocity dispersion nuclear  ring in mrk1066	we report the first two-dimensional stellar population synthesis in thenear-infrared of the nuclear region of an active galaxy, namely mrk1066.  we have used integral field spectroscopy with adaptive optics at the gemininorth telescope to map the to map the age distribution of the stellarpopulation in the inner 300 pc at a spatial resolution of 35 pc. an old stellarpopulation component (age &gt;5gyr) is dominant within the inner ~160pc, which weattribute to the galaxy bulge. beyond this region, up to the borders of theobservation field (~300 pc), intermediate age components (0.3-0.7gyr) dominate.we find a spatial correlation between this intermediate age component and apartial ring of low stellar velocity dispersions (sigma). low-sigma nuclearrings have been observed in other active galaxies and our result for mrk1066suggests that they are formed by intermediate age stars. this age is consistentwith an origin for the low-sigma rings in a past event which triggered aninflow of gas and formed stars which still keep the colder kinematics (ascompared to that of the bulge) of the gas from which they have formed. at thenucleus proper we detect, in addition, two unresolved components: a compactinfrared source, consistent with an origin in hot dust with mass ~1.9x10^{-2}m_sun, and a blue featureless power-law continuum, which contributes with only~15% of the flux at 2.12 microns.

1003.5700	long-term profile variability in active galactic nuclei with  double-peaked balmer emission lines	an increasing number of active galactic nuclei (agns) exhibit broad,double-peaked balmer emission lines,which represent some of the best evidencefor the existence of relatively large-scale accretion disks in agns. a set of20 double-peaked emitters have been monitored for nearly a decade in order toobserve long-term variations in the profiles of the double-peaked balmer lines.variations generally occur on timescales of years, and are attributed tophysical changes in the accretion disk. here we characterize the variability ofa subset of seven double-peaked emitters in a model independent way. we findthat variability is caused primarily by the presence of one or more discrete"lumps" of excess emission; over a timescale of a year (and sometimes less)these lumps change in amplitude and shape, but the projected velocity of theselumps changes over much longer timescales (several years). we also find thatall of the objects exhibit red peaks that are stronger than the blue peak atsome epochs and/or blueshifts in the overall profile, contrary to theexpectations for a simple, circular accretion disk model, thus emphasizing theneed for asymmetries in the accretion disk. comparisons with two simple models,an elliptical accretion disk and a circular disk with a spiral arm, are unableto reproduce all aspects of the observed variability, although both account forsome of the observed behaviors. three of the seven objects have robustestimates of the black hole masses. for these objects the observed variabilitytimescale is consistent with the expected precession timescale for a spiralarm, but incompatible with that of an elliptical accretion disk. we suggestthat with the simple modification of allowing the spiral arm to be fragmented,many of the observed variability patterns could be reproduced.

1007.5317	a correlation between the highest energy cosmic rays and nearby active  galactic nuclei detected by fermi	we analyze the correlation of the positions of gamma-ray sources in the fermilarge area telescope first source catalog (1fgl) and the first lat activegalactic nuclei (agn) catalog (1lac) with the arrival directions ofultra-high-energy cosmic rays (uhecrs) observed with the pierre augerobservatory, in order to investigate the origin of uhecrs. we find thatgalactic sources and blazars identified in the 1fgl are not significantlycorrelated with uhecrs, while the 1lac sources display a mild correlation (2.6sigma level) on a ~2.4 degree angular scale. when selecting only the 1lac agnscloser than 200 mpc, we find a strong association (5.4 sigma) between theirpositions and the directions of uhecrs on a ~17 degree angular scale; theprobability of the observed configuration being due to an isotropic flux ofcosmic rays is 5x10^{-8}. there is also a 5 sigma correlation with nearby 1lacsources on a 6.5 degree scale. we identify 7 "gamma-ray loud" agns which areassociated with uhecrs within ~17 degree and are likely candidates for theproduction sites of uhecrs: centaurus a, ngc 4945, eso 323-g77, 4c+04.77, ngc1218, rx j0008.0+1450 and ngc 253. we interpret these results as providingadditional support to the hypothesis of the origin of uhecrs in nearbyextragalactic objects. as the angular scales of the correlations are large, wediscuss the possibility that intervening magnetic fields might be considerablydeflecting the trajectories of the particles on their way to earth.

1105.1548	an h-alpha nuclear spiral structure in the e0 active galaxy arp102b	we report the discovery of a two-armed mini-spiral structure within the innerkiloparsec of the e0 liner/seyfert 1 galaxy arp102b. the arms are observed inh-alpha emission and located east and west of the nucleus, extending up toabout 1 kpc from it. we use narrow-band imaging from the hubble space telescopeadvanced camera for surveys, in combination with archival vla radio images at3.6 and 6 cm to investigate the origin of the nuclear spiral. from the h-alphaluminosity of the spiral, we obtain an ionized gas mass of the order of onemillion solar masses. one possibility is that the nuclear spiral represents agas inflow triggered by a recent accretion event which has replenished theaccretion disk, giving rise to the double-peaked emission-line profilescharacteristic of arp102b. however, the radio images show a one-sided curvedjet which correlates with the eastern spiral arm observed in the h-alpha image.a published milliarcsecond radio image also shows one-sided structure atposition angle about 40 degrees, approximately aligned with the inner part ofthe eastern spiral arm. the absence of a radio counter-part to the westernspiral arm is tentatively interpreted as indicating that the jet isrelativistic, with an estimated speed of 0.45c. estimates of the jet kineticenergy and the ionizing luminosity of the active nucleus indicate that both arecapable of ionizing the gas along the spiral arms. we conclude that, althoughthe gas in the nuclear region may have originated in an accretion event, themini-spiral is most likely the result of a jet-cloud interaction rather than aninflowing stream.

1105.2487	intermediate-age stars as origin of low stellar velocity dispersion  nuclear rings: the case of mrk 1157	we have used the gemini near-infrared integral field spectrograph (nifs) tomap the age distribution of the stellar population in the inner 400 pc of theseyfert 2 galaxy mrk 1157 (ngc 591), at a spatial resolution of 35 pc. we haveperformed wavelet and principal component analysis in the data in order toremove instrumental signatures. an old stellar population component (age &gt; 5gyr) is dominant within the inner ~ 130 pc which we attribute to the galaxybulge. beyond this region, up to the borders of the observation field, young tointermediate age components (0.1--0.7 gyr) dominate. as for mrk 1066,previously studied by us, we find a spatial correlation between thisintermediate age component and a partial ring of low stellar velocitydispersions (sigma*). low-sigma* nuclear rings have been observed in otheractive galaxies and our results for mrk 1157 and mrk 1066 reveal that they areformed by intermediate age stars. such age is consistent with a scenario inwhich the origin of the low-sigma* rings is a past event which triggered aninflow of gas and formed stars which still keep the colder kinematics of thegas from which they have formed. no evidence for the presence of an unresolvedfeatureless continuum and hot dust component -- as found in mrk1066 -- arefound for mrk 1157.

1107.2564	feeding and feedback in the active nucleus of mrk 1157 probed with  gemini near-infrared integral-field spectrograph	we have mapped the stellar and gaseous kinematics, as well as theemission-line flux distributions and ratios, from the inner 450pc radius ofmrk1157, using 2d near-ir spectra obtained with the gemini nifs at a spatialresolution of 35pc. the stellar velocity field shows a rotation pattern, with adiscrete s-shaped zero velocity curve. the presence of a bar is also supportedby the residual map between the observed rotation field and a model of circularorbits in a plummer potential. the stellar velocity dispersion map presents apartial ring of low-sigma values (50-60km/s) at 250pc from the nucleussurrounded by higher sigma values from the galaxy bulge, originated inkinematically colder regions with recent star formation. the velocitydispersion of the bulge (100km/s) implies in a black hole mass of8.3x10^6m_sun. emission-line flux distributions are most extended alongpa=27/153deg, reaching at least 450pc from the nucleus and following theorientation observed in previous optical emission-line [oiii] imaging and radiojet. the molecular h_2 emission is dominated by thermal processes, mainly dueto x-ray heating by the active nucleus. the [feii] excitation has a largercontribution from shocks produced by the radio jet, as evidenced by theline-ratio maps and velocity dispersion map, which show spatial correlationwith the radio structures. the gaseous kinematics shows two components, one dueto gas located in the galaxy plane and another in outflow, which is orientedclose to the plane of the sky, thus extending to high latitudes, as the galaxyplane is inclined by 45deg relative to the plane of the sky. the gas rotatingin the plane dominates the h_2 and pa-beta emission, while the gas in outflowis observed predominantly in [feii] emission. from the outflow velocities andimplied geometry, we estimate an outflow mass rate of 6m_sun/yr for the ionisedgas.

1112.4640	spectral energy distribution models for low-luminosity active galactic  nuclei in liners	low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (llagns) represent the bulk of the agnpopulation in the present-day universe and they trace the low-level accretingsupermassive black holes. in order to probe the accretion and jet physicalproperties in llagns as a class, we model the broadband radio to x-raysspectral energy distributions (seds) of 21 llagns in low-ionization nuclearemission-line regions (liners) with a coupled accretion-jet model. theaccretion flow is modeled as an inner adaf outside of which there is atruncated standard thin disk. we find that the radio emission is severelyunderpredicted by adaf models and is explained by the relativistic jet. theorigin of the x-ray radiation in most sources can be explained by threedistinct scenarios: the x-rays can be dominated by emission from the adaf, orthe jet, or the x-rays can arise from a jet-adaf combination in which bothcomponents contribute to the emission with similar importance. for 3 objectsboth the jet and adaf fit equally well the x-ray spectrum and can be thedominant source of x-rays whereas for 11 llagns a jet-dominated model accountsbetter than the adaf-dominated model for the data. the individual and averagesed models that we computed can be useful for different studies of the nuclearemission of llagns. from the model fits, we estimate important parameters ofthe central engine powering llagns in liners, such as the mass accretion rateand the mass-loss rate in the jet and the jet power - relevant for studies ofthe kinetic feedback from jets.

1203.6101	short timescale variations of the h{\alpha} double-peaked profile of the  nucleus of ngc 1097	the broad (fwhm ~ 10,000 km/s) double-peaked h{\alpha} profile from theliner/seyfert 1 nucleus of ngc 1097 was discovered in 1991, and monitored forthe following 11 years. the profile showed variations attributed to therotation of gas in a non-axisymmetric keplerian accretion disk, ionized by avarying radiatively inefficient accretion flow (riaf) located in the innerparts of the disk. we present and model 11 new spectroscopic observations ofthe double-peaked profile taken between 2010 march and 2011 march. this seriesof observations was motivated by the finding that in 2010 march the flux in thedouble-peaked line was again strong, becoming, in 2010 december, even strongerthan in the observations of a decade ago. we also discovered shorter timescalevariations than in the previous observations: (1) the first, of ~7 days, isinterpreted as due to "reverberation" of the variation of the ionizing sourceluminosity, and the timescale of 7 days as the light crossing time between thesource and the accretion disk; this new timescale and its interpretationprovides a distance between the emitting gas and the supermassive black holeand as such introduces a new constraint on its mass; (2) the second, ofapproximately 5 months, was attributed to the rotation of a spiral arm in thedisk, which was found to occur on the dynamical timescale. we use two accretiondisk models to fit theoretical profiles to the new data, both havingnon-axisymmetric emissivities produced by the presence of an one-armed spiral.our modeling constrains the rotation period for the spiral to be approximately18 months. this work supports our previous conclusion that the broaddouble-peaked balmer emission lines in ngc 1097, and probably also in otherlow-luminosity active nuclei, originate from an accretion disk ionized by acentral riaf.

1302.5124	the origin of dust in early-type galaxies and implications for accretion  onto supermassive black holes	we have conducted an archival spitzer study of 38 early-type galaxies (etgs)in order to determine the origin of the dust in approximately half of thispopulation. our sample galaxies generally have good wavelength coverage from3.6um to 160um, as well as visible-wavelength hst images. we use the spitzerdata to estimate dust masses, or establish upper limits, and find that all ofthe etgs with dust lanes in the hst data are detected in all of the spitzerbands and have dust masses of ~10^{5-6.5} msun, while galaxies without dustlanes are not detected at 70um and 160um and typically have &lt;10^5 msun of dust.the apparently dust-free galaxies do have 24um emission that scales with theshorter wavelength flux, yet substantially exceeds the expectations ofphotospheric emission by approximately a factor of three. we conclude thisemission is dominated by hot, circumstellar dust around evolved stars that doesnot survive to form a substantial interstellar component. the order ofmagnitude variations in dust masses between galaxies with similar stellarpopulations rules out a subtantial contribution from continual, internalproduction in spite of the clear evidence for circumstellar dust. wedemonstrate that the interstellar dust is not due to purely external accretion,unless the product of the merger rate of dusty satellites and the dust lifetimeis at least an order of magnitude higher than expected. we propose that dust inetgs is seeded by external accretion, yet the accreted dust is maintained bycontinued growth in externally-accreted cold gas beyond the nominal lifetime ofindividual grains. the several gyr depletion time of the cold gas is longenough to reconcile the fraction of dusty etgs with the merger rate of gas-richsatellites. as the majority of dusty etgs are also low-luminosity agn andlikely fueled by this cold gas, their lifetime should similarly be several gyr.

0801.1488	mapping of the molecular gas inflow towards the seyfert nucleus of  ngc4051 using gemini nifs	we present two-dimensional (2d) stellar and gaseous kinematics of the inner~130x180 pc^2 of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc4051 at a sampling of 4.5pc, from near-infrared k-band spectroscopic observations obtained with thegemini's near-infrared integral field spectrograph (nifs). the turnover of thestellar rotation curve at only ~55 pc from the nucleus, revealing a highlyconcentrated gravitational potential. the stellar velocity dispersion of thebulge is ~60 km/s -- implying on a nuclear black hole mass of ~10^6 m_sun --within which patches of lower velocity dispersion suggest the presence ofregions of more recent star formation. the brgamma emission-line shows norotation as well as no blueshifts or redshifts in excess of 30 km/s, and isthus not restricted to the galaxy plane. the [caviii] coronal region is compactbut resolved, extending over the inner 75 pc. it shows the highest blueshifts-- of up to -250 km/s, and the highest velocity dispersions, interpreted as dueto outflows from the active nucleus, supporting an origin close to the nucleus.subtraction of the stellar velocity field from the gaseous velocity field hasallowed us to isolate non-circular motions observed in the h_2 emitting gas.the most conspicuous kinematic structures are two nuclear spiral arms. weinterpret these structures as inflows towards the nucleus, a result similar tothose of previous studies in which we have found streaming motions alongnuclear spirals in ionized gas using optical ifu observations. we havecalculated the mass inflow rate along the nuclear spiral arms, obtaining$\dot{m}_{h_2} ~ 4x10^{-5} m_sun/yr, value ~100 times smaller than theaccretion rate necessary to power the active nucleus.

1312.1982	spectral models for low-luminosity active galactic nuclei in liners: the  role of advection-dominated accretion and jets	we perform an exploratory study of the physical properties of accretion flowsand jets in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (llagns) by modeling thespectral energy distributions (seds) of 12 llagns in low-ionization nuclearemission-line regions (liners). these seds we constructed from high-resolutionradio, x-ray and optical/uv observations of the immediate vicinity of the blackhole. we adopt a coupled accretion-jet model comprising an inneradvection-dominated accretion flow (adaf) and an outer standard thin disk. wepresent best-fit models in which either the adaf or the jet dominate the x-rayemission. six sources in our sample display an optical-uv excess with respectto adaf and jet models; this excess can be explained as emission from thetruncated disk with transition radii 30-225 rs in four of them. in almost allsources the optical emission can also be attributed to unresolved, old stellarclusters with masses ~1e7-1e8 msun. we find evidence for a correlation betweenthe accretion rate and jet power and an anti-correlation between theradio-loudness and the accretion rate. we confirm previous findings that theradio emission is severely underpredicted by adaf models and explained by therelativistic jet. we find evidence for a nonlinear relation between the x-rayand bolometric luminosities and a slight ir excess in the average model sedcompared to that of quasars. we suggest that the hardness of the x-ray spectrumcan be used to identify the x-ray emission mechanism and discuss directions forprogress in understanding the origin of the x-rays.

1401.0032	feeding and feedback in nearby agn - comparison with the milky way  center	i discuss feeding and feedback processes observed in the inner few hundredparsecs of nearby active galaxies using integral field spectroscopy at spatialresolutions of a few to tens of parsecs. signatures of feedback includeoutflows from the nucleus with velocities ranging from 200 to 1000km/s, withmass outflow rates between 0.5 and a few msun/yr. signatures of feeding includethe observation of gas inflows along nuclear spirals and filaments, withvelocities ranging from 50 to 100km/s and mass flow rates from 0.1 to 1msun/yr. these rates are 2--3 orders of magnitude larger than the massaccretion rate to the supermassive black hole (smbh). these inflows can thuslead, during less than one activity cycle, to the accumulation of enough gas inthe inner few hundred parsecs, to trigger the formation of new stars, leadingto the growth of the galaxy bulge. young to intermediate age stars have indeedbeen found in circumnuclear rings around a number of active galactic nuclei(agn). one of these rings, with ~100pc radius is observed in the seyfert 2galaxy ngc1068, and is associated to an off-centered molecular ring, verysimilar to that observed in the milky way (mw). on the basis of an evolutionaryscenario, we speculate that, in the mw, molecular gas has already accumulatedwithin the inner ~100 pc and is already triggering the formation of new stars.a possible increase in the star-formation rate in the region will then befollowed, tens of millions of years in the future, by the triggering of nuclearactivity in sgr a*.

1403.5816	the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes in the near  universe	a fundamental role is attributed to supermassive black holes (smbh), and thefeedback they generate, in the evolution of galaxies. but theoretical modelstrying to reproduce the relation between the smbh mass and stellar velocitydispersion of the galaxy bulge make broad assumptions about the physicalprocesses involved. these assumptions are needed due to the scarcity ofobservational constraints on the relevant physical processes which occur whenthe smbh is being fed via mass accretion in active galactic nuclei (agn). insearch for these constraints, our group -- agn integral field spectroscopy(agnifs) -- has been mapping the gas kinematics as well as the stellarpopulation properties of the inner few hundred parsecs of a sample of nearbyagn hosts. in this contribution, i report results obtained so far which showgas inflows along nuclear spirals and compact disks in the inner tens tohundreds of pc in nearby agn hosts which seem to be the sources of fuel to theagn. as the inflow rates are much larger than the agn accretion rate, theexcess gas must be depleted via formation of new stars in the bulge. indeed, inmany cases, we find ~100 pc circumnuclear rings of recent star formation (ages~ 10 - 500 myr) that can be interpreted as a signature of co-evolution of thehost galaxy and its agn.

1406.0927	2d stellar population and gas kinematics of the inner kiloparsec of the  post-starburst quasar sdss j0330-0532	we have used optical integral field spectroscopy in order to map the starformation history of the inner kiloparsec of the post-starburst quasar (psq)j0330--0532 and to map its gas and stellar kinematics as well as the gasexcitation. psqs are hypothesized to represent a stage in the evolution ofgalaxies in which the star formation has been recently quenched due to thefeedback of the nuclear activity, as suggested by the presence of thepost-starburst population at the nucleus. we have found that the old stellarpopulation (age $\ge$ 2.5 gyr) dominates the flux at 5100 \aa\ in the inner0.26 kpc, while both the post-starburst (100 myr $\le$ age $&lt;$ 2.5 gyr) andstarburst (age $&lt;$ 100 myr) components dominate the flux in a circumnuclearring at $\approx$0.5 kpc from the nucleus. with our spatially resolved study wedo not have found any post-starburst stellar population in the inner 0.26\,kpc.on the other hand, we do see the signature of agn feedback in this region,which does not reach the circumnuclear ring where the post-starburst populationis observed. we thus do not support the quenching scenario for the j0330-0532.in addition, we have concluded that the strong signature of the post-starburstpopulation in larger aperture spectra (e.g. from sloan digital sky survey) ispartially due to the combination of the young and old age components. based onthe m$_{\rm bh}-\sigma_{\rm star}$ relationship and the stellar kinematics wehave estimated a mass for the supermassive black hole of 1.48 $\pm$ 0.66$\times$10$^7$ m$_\odot$.

1410.6241	the narrow line region in 3d: mapping agn feeding and feedback	early studies of nearby seyfert galaxies have led to the picture that thenarrow line region (nlr) is a cone-shaped region of gas ionized by radiationfrom a nuclear source collimated by a dusty torus, where the gas is in outflow.in this contribution, i discuss a 3d view of the nlr obtained via integralfield spectroscopy, showing that: (1) although the region of highest emissionis elongated (and in some cases cone-shaped), there is also lower levelemission beyond the "ionization cone", indicating that the agn radiation leaksthrough the torus; (2) besides outflows, the gas kinematics include alsorotation in the galaxy plane and inflows; (3) in many cases the outflows arecompact and restricted to the inner few 100pc; we argue that these may be earlystages of an outflow that will evolve to an open-ended, cone-like one. inflowsare observed in ionized gas in liners, and in warm molecular gas in moreluminous agn, being usually found on hundred of pc scales. mass outflow ratesin ionized gas are of the order of a few solar masses per year, while the massinflow rates are of the order of tenths of solar masses per year. mass inflowrates in warm molecular gas are ~4-5 orders of magnitude lower, but theseinflows seem to be only tracers of more massive inflows in cold molecular gasthat should be observable at mm wavelengths.

1411.4682	short-timescale monitoring of the x-ray, uv and broad double-peak  emission line of the nucleus of ngc 1097	recent studies have suggested that the short-timescale ($\lesssim7$ days)variability of the broad ($\sim$10,000 km s$^{-1}$) double-peaked h$\alpha$profile of the liner nucleus of ngc1097 could be driven by a variable x-rayemission from a central radiatively inefficient accretion flow (riaf). to testthis scenario, we have monitored the ngc1097 nucleus in x-ray and uv continuumwith swift and the h$\alpha$ flux and profile in the optical spectrum usingsoar and gemini-south from 2012 august to 2013 february. during the monitoringcampaign, the h$\alpha$ flux remained at a very low level --- 3 times lowerthan the maximum flux observed in previous campaigns and showing only limited($\sim 20\%$) variability. the x-ray variations were small, only $\sim 13\%$throughout the campaign, while the uv did not show significant variations. weconcluded that the timescale of the h$\alpha$ profile variation is close to thesampling interval of the optical observations, which results in only marginalcorrelation between the x-ray and h$\alpha$ fluxes. we have caught the agn inngc1097 in a very low activity state, in which the ionizing source was veryweak and capable of ionizing just the innermost part of the gas in the disk.nonetheless, the data presented here still support the picture in which the gasthat emits the broad double-peaked balmer lines is illuminated/ionized by asource of high-energy photons which is located interior to the inner radius ofthe line-emitting part of the disk.

astro-ph;0001206	extended gas in seyfert galaxies: near-infrared observations of 15  active nuclei	results from an analysis of low resolution (r~250) near-ir long-slit spectracovering simultaneously the i, j, h, and k bands, for a sample of 15 seyfertgalaxies and the n5253 starburst nucleus, are presented. the seyfert galaxieswere selected as presenting `linear' or cone-like high excitation emission linein the optical, most probably due to the collimation of the central source'sradiation by a dusty molecular torus. our goal was to look for signatures ofthis torus, and to investigate the gaseous distribution, excitation andreddening. the ir emission lines are spatially extended in most cases, and wehave used the [feii]/pa(beta) ratio as a measure of the gaseous excitation inmrk573, n1386, and n7582. values for this ratio between 1.5 and 6 are found,suggesting excitation of [feii] by x-rays or shock waves in some regions.nuclear pa(beta) in n1365, and possibly nuclear br(gama) in mrk573, are broad.  from analysis of the spatial distribution of the continuum (j-h) and (h-k)colours derived from our spectra, we find redder colours for the nucleus thanthe nearby bulge in most of the seyfert 2s observed. comparison with modelsincluding emission from dust and stars shows that hot (t~1000 k) dust emissiondominates the nuclear continuum in n1365, n2110, n3281, n7582, and eso362-g18.in n1386, n5643, and n5728 the main contributor is the underlying stellarpopulation, combined with some foreground reddening and/or cool dust emission.in a few cases, the (j-h) colours on opposite sides of the nucleus differ by0.3-0.8 mag, an effect that we interpret as partly due to differences in thelocal stellar population, and possibly extinction gradients.

astro-ph;0007027	the frequency of nuclear star-formation in seyfert 2 galaxies	we investigate the detectability of starburst signatures in the nuclearspectrum of seyfert 2 galaxies by constructing spectral models in thewavelength range 3500-4100a, combining the spectrum of a bulge population (ofage ~10gyr) with that of younger stellar populations, spanning ages from ~3 myrto 1 gyr. we also construct models combining the bulge template with apower-law (pl) continuum, which is observed in some seyfert 2's in polarizedlight, contributing with typically 10-40% of the flux at 4020a. we concludethat such continuum cannot be distinguished from that of a very young stellarpopulation (age &lt; 10 myr), contributing with less than ~0.02% of the mass ofthe bulge. the models are compared with nuclear spectra - corresponding to aradius of 200-300 pc at the galaxy - of 20 seyfert 2 galaxies, in which wespecifically look for the signatures above of young to intermediate age stellarpopulations. we find them in ten galaxies, thus 50% of the sample. but only insix cases (30% of the sample) they can be attributed to young stars (age &lt; 500myr): mrk 1210, eso 362-g8, ngc 5135, ngc 5643, ngc 7130 and ngc 7582. in theremaining four cases, the signatures are due to intermediate age stars (~1gyr). we find a tendency for the young stars to be found more frequently amongthe late type seyfert's. this tendency is supported by a comparison between theequivalent widths (w) of absorption lines of the nuclear spectra of the seyfert2's with those of normal galaxies of the same hubble type.

astro-ph;0211474	stellar population gradients in seyfert 2 galaxies	we study the variation of the stellar population properties as a function ofdistance from the nucleus for a sample of 35 seyfert 2 galaxies using thetechnique of stellar population synthesis. we sample regions at the galaxieswith dimensions in the range 200 x 200 to 400 x 400 pc and compare thesynthesis results with those of a control sample of non-seyfert galaxies. wefind that both at the nucleus and up to 3 kpc from it the oldest age component(10 gyr) presents a smaller contribution to the total flux in the seyfert thanin the non-seyfert galaxies of the same hubble type, while the componentsyounger than 100 myr present a larger contribution in the seyfert's than innon-seyferts. in addition, while for the non-seyferts clear gradients arepresent, in which the contribution of the oldest components decrease withdistance from the nucleus and the contribution of the 1 gyr component increases-- we do not find such gradients in most seyferts. these results suggest thatthe agn-starburst connection is a large scale phenomenon affecting not only theinner few hundred parsecs, but the inner kiloparsecs.

astro-ph;0401414	stellar population in llagn.ii: stis observations	we present a study of the stellar population in low luminosity agn (llagn).our goal is to search for spectroscopic signatures of young and intermediateage stars, and to investigate their relationship with the ionization mechanismin llagn. the method used is based on the stellar population synthesis of theoptical continuum of the innermost (20-100 pc) regions in these galaxies. forthis purpose, we have collected high spatial resolution optical (2900-5700 a)stis spectra of 28 nearby llagn that are available in the hubble spacetelescope archive. the analysis of these data is compared with a similaranalysis also presented here for 51 ground-based spectra of llagn. our mainfindings are: (1) no features due to wolf-rayet stars were convincinglydetected in the stis spectra. (2) young stars contribute very little to theoptical continuum in the ground-based aperture. however, the fraction of lightprovided by these stars is higher than 10% in most of the weak-[oi] llagn stisspectra. (3) intermediate age stars contribute significantly to the opticalcontinuum of these nuclei. this population is more frequent in objects withweak than with strong [oi]. weak-[oi] llagn that have young stars stand out fortheir intermediate age population. (4) most of the strong-[oi] llagn havepredominantly old stellar population. a few of these objects also show afeature-less continuum that contributes significantly to the optical continuum.these results suggest that young and intermediate age stars do not play asignificant role in the ionization of llagn with strong [oi]. however, theionization in weak-[oi] llagn with young and/or intermediate age populationcould be due to stellar processes.

astro-ph;0401416	stellar population in llagn.i: ground-based observations	(abridge): we present a spectroscopic study of the stellar populations of lowluminosity agn (llagn). our main goal is to determine whether the stars wholive in the innermost (100 pc-scale) regions of these galaxies are in some wayrelated to the emission line properties, which would imply a link between thestellar population and the ionization mechanism. high signal to noise, groundbased long-slit spectra in the 3500--5500 a interval were collected for 60galaxies.our main findings are: (1) few llagn have a detectable young (&lt; 10myr) starburst component, indicating that very massive stars do not contributesignificantly to the optical continuum. in particular, no features due towolf-rayet stars were convincingly detected. (2) high order balmer absorptionlines of hi (hobls), on the other hand, are detected in 40% of llagn.  these features, which are strongest in 100 myr--1 gyr intermediate agestellar populations, are accompanied by diluted metal absorption lines andbluer colors than other objects in the sample. (3) these intermediate agepopulations are very common (50 %) in llagn with relatively weak [oi] emission,but rare (10 %) in llagn with stronger [oi]. this is intriguing since llagnwith weak [oi] have been previously hypothesized to be ``transition objects''in which both an agn and young stars contribute to the emission-lineexcitation. massive stars, if present, are completely outshone by intermediateage and old stars in the optical. this happens in at least a couple of objectswhere independent uv spectroscopy detects young starbursts not seen in theoptical. (4) objects with predominantly old stars span the whole range of[oi]/halpha values, but (5) sources with significant young and/or intermediateage populations are nearly all (90%) weak [oi] emitters.

astro-ph;0512540	radiatively inefficient accretion flow in the nucleus of ngc 1097	we present a model for the accretion flow around the supermassive black holein the liner nucleus of ngc 1097 which fits the optical to x-ray spectralenergy distribution (sed). the x-ray segment of the sed is based onobservations with the chandra x-ray observatory, which are reported here forthe first time. the inner part of the flow is modeled as a radiativelyinefficient accretion flow (riaf) and the outer part as a standard thin disk.the value of the transition radius (~225 schwarzschild radii) between the riafand outer thin disk was obtained from our previous fitting of the double-peakedbalmer emission line profile, which originates in the thin disk. the black holemass was inferred from measurements of the stellar velocity dispersion in thehost galaxy. when these parameters are used in the accretion flow model, thesed can be successfully reproduced, which shows that the line profile model andthe accretion flow model are consistent with each other. a small remainingexcess in the near-uv is accounted by the contribution of an obscured starburstlocated within 9 pc from the nucleus, as we reported in an earlier paper. theradio flux is consistent with synchrotron emission of a relativistic jetmodeled by means of the internal shock scenario. in an appendix we also analyzethe chandra x-ray observations of the ~1 kpc circumnuclear star-forming ringand of an ultraluminous compact x-ray source located outside the ring.

astro-ph;0606667	gemini/gmos ifu stellar kinematics of the nuclear region of six nearby  active galaxies	we present two-dimensional (2d) mapping of the stellar velocity field withinthe inner 5 arcsec of six nearby active galaxies, using spectra obtained withthe integral field unit of the gmos instrument at the gemini north telescope.the spatial resolution range from 20 to about 180 pc, and the observed field ofview covers a few hundred parsecs around the nuclei. the calcium ii tripletabsorption features at ~ 8500 a were used to measure the stellar radialvelocities and velocity dispersions (sigma). a simple kinematical modelassuming a purely rotating system with circular orbits in a plane was fitted tothe radial velocity data. the turnover of the rotation curve is at only ~ 50 pcfor ngc 4051 and between 200 and 700 pc for the other 5 galaxies. the sigmamaps show the largest values at the centre. in the cases of ngc 2273 and ngc3227, there is a decrease to sigma ~ 70-80 km/s at ~ 200-300 pc from thenucleus, delineating partial rings of low sigma values. a similar broken ringseems to be present at ~ 400 pc from the nucleus also in ngc 4593. we interpretthese low sigma rings as traces of recently formed stars that partially keepthe cold kinematics of the original gas from which they have formed.  the main novelty of the present work is the unprecedented spatial resolutionreached by a 2d study of stellar kinematics of seyfert galaxies using an ifu.the few similar ifu studies available in the literature for seyfert galaxieshave a much poorer spatial resolution and/or are restricted to the study ofemission line kinematics.

astro-ph;0609322	gemini near infrared integral field spectroscopy of the narrow-line  region of eso428-g14: kinematics, excitation and the role of the radio jet	we present 2d gas kinematics and excitation of the inner 300 pc of theseyfert galaxy eso428-g14 at a sampling of 14 pc^2, from near-ir spectroscopicobservations at r~6000 obtained with the ifu of the gemini near-infraredspectrograph. from measurements of fluxes and profiles of the emission lines[feii]lambda1.257, pa_beta, h_2lambda2.121 and br_gamma, we construct 2d mapsof line intensities and ratios, radial velocities and velocity dispersions.emission lines "tomography" is provided by velocity slices obtained across theline profiles, which allows the mapping of not only of peak velocities butincluding also the wings. we compare these maps with a previously publishedhigh spatial resolution radio map and find a tight relation between the radiostructure and the emission-line flux distributions and kinematics, revealingthat the radio-jet plays a fundamental role not only in shaping the nlr butalso in the imprint of its kinematics. blueshifts of up to 400 km/s andvelocity dispersions of up to 150 km/s are observed in association with theradio jet at position angle pa=129, which is also the pa of the photometricmajor axis of the galaxy. the [feii] shows the largest blueshifts and velocitydispersions and its flux distribution is concentrated along the jet, while theh_2 shows the lowest velocity dispersions and has additional flux contributionfrom regions beyond the jet. we use the 2d velocity dispersion maps to estimateupper limits to the contribution of the radio jet to the excitation of [feii]and h_2 which may reach 90% for [feii] and 80% for h_2 in the jet region. the[feii]/pa_beta emission-line ratios and the association of the [feii] fluxdistribution and kinematics with the radio structure supports a strongercontribution of the radio jet to the [feii] excitation than to that of h_2.

astro-ph;0610380	a strong correlation between circumnuclear dust and black hole accretion  in early-type galaxies	we present a detailed investigation of the incidence of circumnuclear duststructure in a large, well-matched sample of early-type galaxies with andwithout active galactic nuclei (agn). all 34 early-type agn hosts in our samplehave circumnuclear dust, while dust is only observed in 26% (nine) of apair-matched sample of 34 early-type, inactive galaxies. this resultdemonstrates a strong correlation between the presence of circumnuclear dustand accretion onto the central, supermassive black hole in elliptical andlenticular galaxies. this correlation is not present at later hubble types,where a sample of 31 active and 31 inactive galaxies all contain circumnucleardust. these archival, hst observations reveal a wide range of mostly chaoticdust morphologies. current estimates suggest the dust settling or destructiontime is on order of 10^8 years and therefore the presence of dust in ~ 50% ofearly-type galaxies requires frequent replenishment and similarly frequentfueling of their central, supermassive black holes. the observed dust could beinternally-produced (via stellar winds) or externally-accreted, although thereare observational challenges for both of these scenarios. our analysis alsoreveals that approximately a third of the early-type galaxies withoutcircumnuclear dust have nuclear stellar disks. these nuclear stellar disks mayprovide a preferred kinematic axis to externally-accreted material and thismaterial may in turn form new stars in these disks. the observed incidence ofnuclear stellar disks and circumnuclear dust suggests that episodicreplenishment of nuclear stellar disks occurs and is approximately concurrentwith the fueling of the central agn.

astro-ph;0611888	inward bound: following gas flows from nuclear spirals to the accretion  disk in active galaxies	a recent analysis of hst optical images of 34 nearby early-type activegalaxies and of a matched sample of 34 inactive galaxies - both drawn from thepalomar survey - shows a clear excess of nuclear dusty structures (filaments,spirals and disks) in the active galaxies. this result supports the associationof the dusty structures with the material which feeds the supermassive blackhole (hereafter smbh). among the inactive galaxies there is instead an excessof nuclear stellar disks. as the active and inactive galaxies can be consideredtwo phases of the "same" galaxy, the above findings and dust morphologiessuggest an evolutionary scenario in which external material (gas and dust) iscaptured to the nuclear region where it settles and ends up feeding the activenucleus and replenishing the stellar disk - which is hidden by the dust in theactive galaxies - with new stars. this evolutionary scenario is supported byrecent gas kinematics of the inner few hundred parsecs of ngc1097, which showsstreaming motions (with velocities ~ 50 km/s) towards the nucleus along spiralarms. the implied large scale mass accretion rate is much larger than the onederived in previous studies for the nuclear accretion disk, but is just enoughto accumulate one million solar masses over a few million years in the nuclearregion, thus consistent with the recent finding of a young circumnuclearstarburst of one million solar masses within 9 parsecs from the nucleus in thisgalaxy.

astro-ph;0612354	models for jet power in elliptical galaxies: a case for rapidly spinning  black holes	the power of jets from black holes are expected to depend on both the spin ofthe black hole and the structure of the accretion disk in the region of thelast stable orbit. we investigate these dependencies using two differentphysical models for the jet power: the classical blandford-znajek (bz) modeland a hybrid model developed by meier. in the bz case, the jets are powered bymagnetic fields directly threading the spinning black hole while in the hybridmodel, the jet energy is extracted from both the accretion disk as well as theblack hole via magnetic fields anchored to the accretion flow inside andoutside the hole's ergosphere. the hybrid model takes advantage of thestrengths of both the blandford-payne and bz mechanisms, while avoiding themore controversial features of the latter. we develop these models more fullyto account for general relativistic effects and to focus on advection-dominatedaccretion flows (adaf) for which the jet power is expected to be a significantfraction of the accreted rest mass energy.  we apply the models to elliptical galaxies, in order to see if these modelscan explain the observed correlation between the bondi accretion rates and thetotal jet powers. for typical values of the disk viscosity parameteralpha~0.04-0.3 and mass accretion rates consistent with adaf modelexpectations, we find that the observed correlation requires j&gt;0.9; i.e., itimplies that the black holes are rapidly spinning. our results suggest that thecentral black holes in the cores of clusters of galaxies must be rapidlyrotating in order to drive jets powerful enough to heat the intracluster mediumand quench cooling flows.

astro-ph;0612392	modelling the jet power in elliptical galaxies: support for rapidly  spinning black holes	recently, allen et al. measured a tight correlation between the bondiaccretion rates and jet powers of the nuclei of nearby x-ray luminouselliptical galaxies. we employ two models of jet powering to understand theabove correlation and derive constraints on the spin and accretion rate of thecentral black holes. the first is the blandford-znajek model, in which the spinenergy of the hole is extracted as jet power; the second model is an hybridversion of the blandford-payne and blandford-znajek processes, in which theoutflow is generated in the inner parts of the accretion disk. we assumeadvection-dominated accretion flows (adaf) and account for general relativisticeffects. our modelling implies that for typical values of the disk viscosityparameter alpha~0.01-1 the tight correlation implies the narrow range of spinsj~0.7-1 and accretion rates mdot(r_ms)~(0.01-1) mdot_bondi. our results providesupport for the "spin paradigm" scenario and suggest that the central blackholes in the cores of clusters of galaxies must be rapidly rotating in order todrive radio jets powerful enough to quench the cooling flows.

astro-ph;9711302	chemical abundance calibrations for the narrow-line-region of active  galaxies	we investigate two chemical abundance calibrations for the narrow-line-region(nlr) of active galaxies in terms of three easily observable opticalemission-line ratios, namely, [oiii]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007/h$\beta$,[nii]$\lambda\lambda$6548,84/h$\alpha$ and[oii]$\lambda3727/$[oiii]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007. the calibrations areobtained from a grid of models on the assumption that the main processresponsible for the production of these lines is photoionization by a``typical'' active galactic nucleus continuum. the chemical elements vary theirabundance together with oxygen, except nitrogen, which is assumed to be aproduct of secondary nucleosynthesis. the calibrations are calculated for therange $8.4 \le 12+log(o/h) \le 9.4$, and tested using nlr data for a sample ofseyfert's and liner's having hii regions in the vicinity of the nucleus. thegaseous abundances of these hii regions have been determined in previous works,and the nlr abundances are obtained on the assumption that they can beextrapolated from those of the hii regions. the calibrations work very well forthe seyfert's, giving abundance values which agree with those obtained from thehii regions, and can thus be used for quick estimates of the chemicalabundances of the nlr's. for the liner's, the calibrations give lower valuesthan those derived from the corresponding hii regions, suggesting that theassumptions of the models do not apply for them, and that there are differentphysical processes at work in the nlr of the liner's.

astro-ph;9801309	the stellar content of active galaxies	we present results of a long-slit spectroscopic study of 39 active and 3normal galaxies. stellar absorption features, continuum colors and their radialvariations are analyzed in an effort to characterize the stellar population inthese galaxies and detect the presence of a featureless continuum underlyingthe starlight spectral component. spatial variations of the equivalent widthsof conspicuous absorption lines and continuum colors are detected in mostgalaxies. star-forming rings, in particular, leave clear fingerprints in theequivalent widths and color profiles. we find that the stellar populations inthe inner regions of active galaxies present a variety of characteristics, andcannot be represented by a single starlight template. dilution of the stellarlines by an underlying featureless continuum is detected in most broad-linedobjects, but little or no dilution is found for the most of the 20 type 2seyferts in the sample. color gradients are also ubiquitous. in particular, allbut one of the observed seyfert 2s are redder at the nucleus than in itsimmediate vicinity. possible consequences of these findings are outlined.
